msg:There were definitely some positives and negatives about this hotel. First off, I will say the staff was very friendly. They would greet you with a smile wherever they saw you on property. I ate dinner at the poolside restaurant a few times and I enjoyed my food as well. Some negatives were that the hallway itself smelt moldy and nasty. Could be due to the carpeting, which was in bad condition, or all the old wood decor or a combo of both. My room smelt the same. The shower smelt like urine and some of the wood in the bathroom was rotting. I guess due to continuous exposure to water. I also didn‚Äôt like the fact that there was little accessibility for a stroller. Maybe I didn‚Äôt see it, but, to get down to the pool and most of the restaurants I only saw a staircase which was inconvenient to take my baby around. I did like the fact that it was right across the road from the beach, but, also somewhat far from the airport. Another positive is that they had a nice play area for the kids. My baby loved playing there. Everyone is different. Maybe you will enjoy this hotel. That is just a bit of my honest review.

A ton of Chinese and Western options. 2mins walking distance from the beach. A shopping street right in the back of the hotel. Bike rental shops as well. Very family friendly. Not the best option for solo travelers perhaps. Pretty clean. Serivce in general is great. Parts of the pools were closed though, which was not mentioned when I booked it. I do reccommend though. I would definitely go back.

Nice frog concert to fall asleep with at night.  Great for a romantic stay,  enjoy alone, as couple or family.  The concierge speaks very well English and is very helpful. 5* to him.   Great breakfast - Chinese and international food.   Near by are many restaurants with tasty food  and a few shops too and just 10 min walk away from the beach.   I would always be happy to  return.  Fun fact - I did actually return.  ü§£ü§©ü§£.

msg:Firstly the concierge at the front desk was easy to contact before arriving at the hotel. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary so I asked them to plan ahead whatever they could and they prepared some cake and a romantic bed setup. The front desk clerk was available at most times during the day if we had any questions or requests. The selected villa room was spacious and very comfortable. Room service did a good job daily and they were very understanding. The hotels facilities are pretty great. All maintained well. The location of the hotel is superb for yalong bay, it‚Äôs walking distance from the beach. The breakfasts weren‚Äôt bad either, and the breakfast time was up until 12:00 which is amazing. This was a fantastic experience and I‚Äôd recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Sanya for leisure.

msg:Warm tip - don‚Äôt book the cheapest room, those rooms are bogus ! Our adventures at Huayu resort started when we couldn‚Äôt enter our room - the card didn‚Äôt work . Instead of immediately giving us another room (I could see on the website that there were plenty of rooms available), they kept sending people that tried to open the door and failed one after another until the lock was broken. We then had to call the hotline and call the front desk 10 times until they finally picked us up to take us to the new room. We lost around 2 hours waiting at the door instead of enjoying the beach. The new room was a lot better than the one we booked , they even gave us the balcony room like we asked. In the end we were more or less satisfied with the service but it can certainly be improved. 
Breakfast is ok but mostly Chinese. Swimming pool looked pretty , unfortunately it was too cold to swim. 
Pros : super comfortable bed, spacious room (thanks to an upgrade), close to the beach , there are towels and beds prepared by the hotel . Hotel is right at the mall with plenty of shops and restaurants. 
They also have their own seafood buffet dinner that costs 300¬• per two people. Service at the restaurant was very good.
Cons : facilities are outdated , there is bathtub in the room that was impossible to use because of very small water pressure. Also , the water in the bathtub tap is not hot enough. 
Conclusion: it is definitely not Sheraton - level resort but then, it‚Äôs a lot cheaper too. If you don‚Äôt pay over 600 per room, then it‚Äôs ok. Good for families with kids, I think .

msg:We loved our stay at Huayu. We had a poolside room with a semi private lagoon and a ground floor balcony. It was really lovely to just chill there and do nothing. 

Room: The room was huge, very clean. The bed - heavenly. Good hot water pressure in the shower. Very comfy lounger on the balcony and a chaise in front. There was also a huge bathtub. It was a little humid being on the first floor. 

Beach/Pool: The beach is about 5 min away with super clean sand and very clear water. Loved swimming there. The hotel provided chairs do get taken by random people and no one is there to supervise, so that's a bit of a challenge, though we preferred lounging by the fantastic (and shaded) pool instead. 

Breakfast: Nothing to write home about but does the trick. Enough western options. Coffee is very decent. 

Around: There is an area with shops and restaurants right by the hotel which makes it super convenient for food. Plenty of western fast food and even a Starbucks if you are picky. 

Spa: fantastic massage 

Overall, I'd definitely come back to this resort!

The rooms were huge with a really comfy bed,  however it smelt a bit funny and the TV is so old,  we couldn't even connect a hard drive to watch movies on lol.  The water pressure in the toilet and shower was also a bit dodgy.  

The staff were all amazing and kind even though we just speak a little Chinese.  Steve was absolutely wonderful and helped us when we had to change hotel due to the covid outbreak.  

Breakfast is fine,  with delicious pastries.  The location is really good,  just a few minutes walk to the beach,  which has sun loungers and towels prepared by the hotel. It is also next to a shopping centre with many restaurants.  

Overall,  I would recommend this hotel more for families rather than couples,  but we enjoyed our stay a lot.

If you want decent beach access in Sanya with no rocks and the ability to have chairs provided by the resort‚ÄîÔºû this is one of the best places considering location and price point. 

If you don‚Äôt mind families and little kids around‚ÄîÔºû then you‚Äôll be okay with the pool and breakfast. They‚Äôve actually improved breakfast by adding access to the downstairs cafe. 

Miko was very helpful and kind during our stay. She helped us find a NAT testing location and then another location when we forgot to do testing in the right timeframe. If you have questions at any point she‚Äôs a great resource.

This is the first time I tried the spa and it was AMAZING! We all agreed it was one of the best massages we‚Äôve had at a hotel or at the price point it was.

If the beach and quick access to a variety of restaurants are your top priorities- this is a great place at a great value!

msg:We booked this hotel very last minute while we were in Sanya mostly for its prime location. Situated right in the heart of La Floret, an area brimming with restaurants (mostly Chinese but you do have Pizza Hut, KFC & Cocos), a small amusement park for the kids, 2 spas, a bar, some shops selling fresh fruits and summer clothes etc. Right opposite La Floret, you are spoilt with yet another two eating zones which are quite scenic and boast more exciting places to eat, chill or even go bungee jumping. You are a stones throw away from the beach and access to a number of water sport activities.

The hotel itself, well you have the low cost rooms at 480 per night and the best part about it is, it is clean. However very very old and the shower area was quite frightful. You could opt to upgrade to the villas which appear to be better maintained or the more expensive rooms at 1000 per night as this is in the newer part of the resort. On site, are 2 lovely pools which the kids enjoyed but most memorable for me was the spa experience - one of my best massages in a long time.

The breakfast at The Huayu was very good, in fact much better than The Pullman. Being a Chinese hotel, I had braced myself for no western options but I was pleasantly corrected with an array of delicious food from pancakes & its fabulous toppings to eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, heaps of veggie & fruit options, yoghurts and all the Chinese breakfast choices in addition to a wide selection of pastries. This was indeed a positive to this resort.

Our bad experience was booking a water sport package at a 1000 rmb for my son: this was to include the banana boat, jet ski, para-gliding & fly trap. We waited a while before we were picked up and taken to the area for this. When we got there, the attendant then said it would be 2 minutes for each activity despite selling it to us at 10 minute per activity. I was furious and demanded my money back which after much deliberation, we were refunded. So lesson learnt: walk around the beach and you will find you can negotiate a much cheaper rate for these activities than what is advertised at the resort.

So, will I return to Huayu? Maybe, but definitely for the more expensive room options.

msg:The place is in a good location in the heart of Yalong Bay but the property is a bit old, and much better suited for families than couples. Almost everyone staying had young kids. The room is nicely decorated, although a bit old with somewhat outdated style. The pool could use a more frequent cleaning. The room keys stop working everyday so you need to go to the front desk and get a new key almost every day, which is a waste of time. The gym also is supposed to open at 7am, but didn‚Äôt open until 9am unless you ask and then wait, again a waste of time. Breakfast is very basic- eggs, noodles, rice, fruit, and some pastries. This hotel is best suited more for budget travelers.

The hotel is not on the beach, need to walk around 10 mins.
But there are all amenities on the beach for the guests.
On the beach, the people from other hotels shouldn‚Äôt occupy the sun beds, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable when some strangers were sitting around. The security must check it.
The room was spacious, and amazing, the housekeeping made a great job.
Breakfast is more Chinese than western.
Pool is great.
Definitely can recommend this hotel.

The front desk service was slow and I felt that the staff were generally unfriendly. The pools are good for the families with children. The room with the pool was not private - the neighbours share with you and you can listen to them shouting over to the next room. The pools are a little warm. The food in the area is okay. The hotel breakfast food is okay, nothing special - better to go outside. If you‚Äôre looking for a luxury resort experience, I would not recommend this hotel. It is overpriced as it is in need of renovations and the bathrooms are growing fungus.

Hotel is situated near a large commercial area which offers plenty of dining options and a small amusement park which children can enjoy in the evenings.

Thank you, Huayu! Will definitely be back!

msg:Generally speaking, we enjoyed our stay here. Although not many English speaking staff at hand, if you can manage your Chinese or use translation tool then should be OK. The location is superb, especially the mall and the nearby amusement park, with many activities for kids. The beach is not so close and the hotel only has sun chairs and umbrellas available until 18:00. The beach itself is for public use. 
We changed room because we wanted a pool view one, and they happily helped. The indoor playground is also big, actually bigger than in other hotels we've stayed. 
The swimming pool does need some maintenance, especially the joints between tiles, which don't look very clean. 
The breakfast buffet is OK. Lots of Chinese and Asian options, not too much for Westerners. 
I didn't quite understand why they have a bar (showing some bottles of wine) within the swimming pool, but nobody serving :(
The only thing that could make me think twice before booking this hotel again is the sofa bed mattress in the family room: it's literally as hard as a board. They did help us by putting a couple of blankets on top, but didn't really make much difference.

The location is very good, near to a lot of business and very close to the beach!

- hotel has no facilities, just swimming pools, a kids play area.  
- the swimming pool is not very well clean.   
- the room smells musty, the air conditioning looked old and dirty. 
- I developed a sore dry mouth in the week and I would think due to the poor air conditioning.  
- you can‚Äôt even buy a drink at the pool, the bars closed.  So every time you want a drink you either have to order from waimai or walk to a shop. 
- I picked this hotel due to the beach,  the beach was poorly managed, smelt like toilets, filthy toilets !   I never went back to the beach.   And instead went to MGM and mangrove and used their facilites. 
- lack of hotel security in Sanya ,  so it‚Äôs best to book a very cheap room and just walk into the best hotels and use their swimming pools etc.  
- the hotel should offer better service. Lovely fresh coconuts falling from the trees at the pool or cut down,  but who drinks them ? The pool workers. :////. Five star standard would offer them to the guests not drink them in front of guests. 

The big asset of this hotel was the cleaner lady. Always happy and smiling and friendly. She should work at reception where the workers seem unhappy. 
- breakfast was on a few western options and Chinese. 
-The lady who worked as a host for breakfast was always so miserable and moody not a smile on her face. 

- overall I wouldn‚Äôt go back. Not worth the money

Our only problem was the screaming children in the swimming pool below our room. This was not within the control of the hotel, but kids were in the pool from 8:00 am to 23:00 pm obnoxiously loud. I am happy for them to enjoy their vacations but I felt like it was at the expense of mine. There is also a lack of bars and western restaurant choices. This is a hotel meant for families; they will truly love it.

msg:Super rubbish hotel. Check-in was terrible on the first day. Not only was the attitude of the front desk bad, they kept not letting us check in. It was so hot that we had to wait with our children. They left us hanging for a long time. We thought we could just go on a trip, but they told us to hurry into the room. The next morning we were going to the beach, but there was no shuttle bus. We had to walk such a long distance. We were all wet when we went back to the hotel to take a shower and have a nap. There was no air conditioning at noon, and the temperature in the room was almost 35 degrees. We called the front desk and asked them to change our room. They asked us to go to the lobby to change rooms and check in again. They told us that there were no rooms and asked us to wait. Isn't this cheating? We and our children were all wet. I asked for a refund, but the hotel didn't care. They said that we couldn't get a refund after we checked in. Isn't this cheating consumers? They said that we had eaten the free meals in the package we booked, and we had to pay more than 200 yuan. When did I buy your meals? According to your logic, should you also refund me the photography service that you gave me without consumption? Later, I called the Cultural and Tourism Bureau, but they didn't care. This was the worst hotel in Hainan. I only went there once in my life. Please be careful. The facilities and equipment are old. The service attitude is the worst I have ever encountered in all the hotels. The experience is super bad. The floor is like moldy. Is this a creative landscape painting? The bathrobe has a sense of a Samsung bath center. The bed board is harder than my temper. The quilt also smells damp and moldy. The service is also an attitude of "you can stay or not, I don't care about the guests". This is a super rubbish hotel. I can't understand how such a five-star hotel can be opened for so many years. Besides, the hotel is far away from the beach. There are many hotels nearby. There is really no need to stay here. I have been calling to complain, but the business has not dealt with it and blocked it. Please close it down quickly and stop cheating people.

As expected, there was a musty smell when we opened the room. It might be because the first floor was too damp. The takeaway food we ordered at night was very complicated. I called the front desk to ask the waiter to deliver it. I didn't expect that the service was really good. The next day, when I woke up, there was plenty of sunshine and the scenery was an unexpected surprise. I took the kids to swim directly, and it was also very photogenic. The hotel is very convenient. There is Baihua Valley Night Market outside! ! And the Yalong Bay Beach from Baihua Valley Night Market is very beautiful. There is also a children's play area in the hotel. The hotel style is very Chinese. Overall, the price is quite good.

The hotel has a duty-free shop shuttle bus to pick up, make an appoin**ent at the front desk, and wait in the lobby before 9 am. The bus is picked up by all the surrounding hotels. Huayu is the first to pick up and the first to send.

The hotel has a good environment, Chinese-style architecture, a large area, and many flowers, plants, and trees. It is very suitable for taking pictures. It was written that we should check in at 3 o'clock, but we arrived before 2 o'clock and checked in. We took the initiative to upgrade the room type. The front desk lady also took the initiative to ask if we needed to make an appoin**ent for free travel photography. The children's playground in the hotel is open until 9 o'clock in the evening. It is spacious and rich. It is not the kind of facility that fools people. The children played in it for two hours and didn't want to leave. Remember to wear socks. The most convenient thing about the hotel is probably the food. Walking down the lobby is the Baihua Valley commercial area, with all kinds of food. This layout is also a bit novel. Hahaha, I found a fruit plate when I returned to the room at night. The swimming pool service is also very good. There are several swimming pools. There is one downstairs where we live. It is very convenient. The swimming pool is very clean. I saw the staff cleaning it very early in the morning. It was very comfortable to swim. There will be a bubble party at 4:30 in the afternoon, and the children are crazy. I would like to give special praise to employee No. 75 at the poolside. He was very enthusiastic and nice. He always paid attention to the safety of the children in the pool. He took the initiative to ask the children whether they could swim and whether they needed to wear safety clothes. He helped comfort the child who choked on the water and cried. He also gave the child water to drink. In short, he was very good. [Smile][Coffee][Rose][Strong]

Originally, I booked a townhouse suite. When I got on the shuttle bus, the manager Steve found that there were old and young people. He was very proactive, enthusiastic and considerate to inform me that the townhouse room had no elevator, which was not very convenient. Then he helped to check the availability and helped to upgrade the room type with elevator. I didn't do this strategy well, but fortunately I met Steve, who was super warm throughout the whole process. Miss Grace at the front desk was very attentive, and the elderly at home said they were very happy.
As a parent-child resort hotel, the parent-child facilities are nothing to say, there is a super large indoor children's club, and adults can accompany their children to enter. The scale of this facility is only two or three hundred yuan for one adult and one child in Beijing, and it is free to play here. I stayed for four days and the children went there for three days and had a great time. The hotel has three swimming pools. The swimming pool in Area 1 is very large, mainly for parent-child play, so the water depth is 1.2 meters, not too deep, enough for adults to swim, and children can play with peace of mind. The rental of swimming pool play equipment is also cheap. If you don't bring a swimming ring and volleyball, you can rent them.
There are also many Russians in this hotel. Many places in the hotel are in Chinese, English and Russian. You can feel the overseas vacation style without going abroad~
The room is cleaned very clean every day. I want to thank Aunt Liu Mu for her enthusiasm.
The geographical location and convenience of the hotel are beyond words.
In the Yalong Bay five-star hotel group, this place has a very high cost performance. Vacation, leisure, parent-child, beach, travel photography, food, one-stop solution.

The hotel environment is very good, the bougainvillea is gorgeous and charming, the swimming pool is surrounded by trees, swimming during the day is not exposed to the sun, and there are hand-cranked boats that children especially love to play. The hotel is in a prime location, a five-minute drive from the forest park, surrounded by commercial streets, and it is also very convenient for eating and shopping. I especially recommend Liupan Village next to the tropical rainforest, the prices are touching, and the taste is also great. The beach is 100 meters away from the hotel, and there are special staff serving next to the awning. It is really worth it to enjoy such an environment at this price

There was no elevator, which was inconvenient for the elderly with poor legs and feet. I tried to communicate with the hotel and they upgraded me to a twin room in the main building for free. It has an elevator, which is very convenient for traveling with the elderly and children. The service is greatüëçüèª. The hotel has many children's activities, but the children are a little old. If they are babies, they will like it more. The hotel environment is very good, the swimming pool is large and comfortable, and next to it is the Baihua Valley Commercial Street, which is full of restaurants, and opposite is the beach. I stayed for four nights this time. It was a good stay. The elderly and children were very happy. I will stay here again when I come to Yalong Bay next time.

As soon as you enter, the scenery of the sea and sky instantly makes your eyes light up. As for the room, I can only describe it in two words: awesome! The space is spacious, the light is sufficient, all kinds of facilities are available, and the quality is excellent. Especially the sea view room, open the curtains, and you can see the unbeatable sea view. You can lie down and enjoy the sunrise and sunset, which is awesome!

Speaking of eating, the hotel's restaurant options are so many that people have entanglement syndrome, Chinese food, Western food, local flavors, everything. What I remember most is the barbecue dinner on the beach, blowing the sea breeze, watching the sunset, and eating freshly grilled seafood. Oh my, that feeling, even the gods envy it!

The service staff is even more impeccable, all of them are smiling, professional and considerate, and from the moment you step into the hotel, you will feel like home. There are also those leisure and entertainment facilities, swimming pools, SPA, children's playgrounds, etc., to ensure that adults and children can have fun.

In general, Yalong Bay Huayu Resort Hotel has successfully created a satisfying seaside vacation with its excellent geographical location, first-class facilities, delicious food and super warm service. I sincerely recommend it to everyone!

The townhouse area is full of experience, and it feels like living at home. The couplets and red lanterns at the door during the Chinese New Year make it feel like coming home after visiting every night, which makes your heart warm. Lots of surprises, highly recommended.

In particular, the hotel has many parent-child places, such as a constant-temperature swimming pool. The swimming pool staff Ni Tangbo and Huang Yongan provide very warm, thoughtful and courteous services. Very good! Especially the children at home like chatting with the pool uncle very much. Originally, children are relatively introverted and very shy when interacting with strangers. However, their character has grown through the contact with the pool uncle. It was a very good stay and experience. I will choose Huayu next time. Vacation hotel

The hotel is huge. I only stayed here for one night and I don't know how big it is. There is a children's play area. Children like to play and sand playing tools can be borrowed. The swimming pool has constant temperature and normal temperature. You can use a swimming ring for free in the swimming pool. The water temperature in the small pool with constant temperature is higher. The waiter's attitude was very good. There is only one set of children's supplies in the parent-child room. Can't see the sea, but it's relatively close to the beach. You can go to the beach through Tianyu at night, but not during the day. There is a map on the room card cover. There are also many types of breakfast. Overall good. There are hotel lounge chairs and bath towels on the beach, which is very convenient. There are fewer people on the beach.

People online say that Yalong Bay is very rough after filling in the sand, but I feel that the beach in Huayu is okay and does not irritate my feet. The hotel has an exclusive lounge area. , you can get mats and bath towels with your room card. The hotel is close to the Baihuagu commercial area, which is very convenient for eating and shopping. The decoration of the hotel may be a bit old, but it is well maintained. All facilities in the room can be used normally. Hot water is available in just a few seconds. It feels like maintenance is taken very seriously. Room service calls were answered in seconds and the service was very fast. There are two restaurants for breakfast. Haitian Pavilion is larger and seems to have a slightly more variety of food, but the difference is not big. The swimming pool is also very clean, and there are some parent-child activities during the Spring Festival. The price is very cost-effective among the Ctrip Five Diamond hotels in Yalong Bay. All in all, it was a very satisfying stay.

msg:When you first arrive at Huayu Hotel, the first thing you enter is a magnificent Chinese-style building, and this is just the lobby of the hotel! During this vacation, I stayed in Huayu for 6 nights. Because I have been to Sanya before and have seen all the things to do. This time I brought two old ladies and myself, a family of four. We are from the north and just want to have a good time. Enjoy the sun, beach and sea, don‚Äôt be too tired, and the budget is not very generous. Everything is really expensive in this season, so Huayu became my ideal choice! The price, service, location and supporting facilities are very cost-effective, including a children's castle, two breakfast rooms, three open-air swimming pools, and a private swimming pool. There are public parent-child activities every day. Just outside the lobby is the Baihua Valley Commercial Street Night Market, which is perfect for shopping and dining. Conveniently, there is a path on the south side of the hotel that leads directly to the beach, and it is not far away on foot! Back to the hotel, the room facilities are indeed a bit old, but the service is not bad. It was already past 11pm when we arrived at the hotel. There were many people checking in at the front desk. There were not many service staff, but they were all a bit busy. Inseparable from each other, it was Manager Zheng who was on duty who gave the praise. As soon as I met him, he made me feel at home with just a few words. I was really tired after traveling all day. I believe that during the peak tourist season, they have to work much harder than us tourists. ! Harbin is hot this winter. The crowded Huayu Hotel and commercial street are also full of warmth. You can take the enthusiasm of the hotel staff for granted, but when dining in Baihua Valley every day, the waiters are enthusiastic and proactive in serving you, and they will pay attention to you during and after the meal. The dining experience will surprise you! There is also a small shop selling seaside products at the end of the path to the beach. They can take fresh water showers. I personally saw two guys coming out of the sea without their mobile phones. The boss said it doesn‚Äôt matter. Tell me your mobile phone number and I will add you on WeChat. Launder the money first and then transfer it to me!
To sum up, Yalong Bay‚Äôs seawater beach is great. There are not many people, but there are many foreigners. You really know how to choose a place to play! Huayu Hotel is located in the middle of Yalong Bay Beach, seat C. You can see the panoramic view of Yalong Bay I posted, which was taken at the top of Forest Park. The restaurants in Baihuagu Commercial Street downstairs are very good, and there are ethnic minorities during the meal. There is no need to go to other places for dance, folk songs and performances. The food at other night markets is too expensive and not delicious!

The most user-friendly thing is breakfast from 7 to 12 o'clock, which is perfect for brunch. Although there are not many kinds of meals, the special rice noodles and Qingbu Liang are delicious. We were assigned to room No. 1101. The room is very large. You can also walk directly to the swimming pool and next to the poolside restaurant. It is also the closest to shopping and the beach. However, the layout of the room is not very reasonable and there are many steps, so be careful. In addition, the location of the hotel is good. There are many restaurants in "Baihua Valley", which is convenient for eating, but the prices are not low. Although you have to go to the public beach, it's not far away. It takes 7-8 minutes to walk to the beach. Finally, I have to praise most of the hotel service staff for their good attitude and considerate service.

There is also a children's playground, where children run wildly and happily. Especially suitable for bringing children to play.
Hygiene: The swimming pool is being cleaned very clean as seen from the balcony in the morning, and the room is also clean. Thumbs up to Dong Lixia, Chen He, and thumbs up to Shi Guangyou on the swimming pool!
Environment: The Chinese-style building is suitable for checking in and taking photos, and the overall stay experience is very good.
Service: The lady at the front desk was super nice. She helped me upgrade to a family room when I took care of my children, and also gave me welcome fruit. The child's sand digging tool was left outside. He took the initiative to give us the sand digging tool that other customers left behind, which made the child not sad. It was very heartwarming. The hotel also has its own beach chairs, which you can use by registering with your room card.

msg:The hotel really cannot be complimented. Except for the attentive service of the front desk staff, I am not satisfied with anything else. 1. The location is about a 10-minute walk from the beach. To put it bluntly, you have to go through a highway and a Tianyu Hotel to get to the Tianyu Hotel's private beach. 2. Breakfast. On the first day, I went to have breakfast at about 9 o'clock. The restaurant told me that there was no place and asked me to go to the three flavors below. I dined at Xuan Restaurant. There was a fat waitress at the door of the restaurant with a slumped face as if she owed her money. It was uncomfortable to look at her, because the price of my meal was a meal for two. I had to coordinate with the waiter to see if I could pack a piece of fruit to take away. , the waiter said no. After asking several times, he didn‚Äôt agree, saying that packing is not allowed. 3. There are very few double-bed rooms in the hotel, and if there are, the location is not good. I looked at three rooms on the first day and chose one. Standard room, and the hotel facilities and bedding are really old, especially the bathrobes are like disposable tablecloths. I have never seen such bathrobes. This is my first time choosing this hotel and I will definitely not stay there next time.

msg:The hotel has a beautiful environment, Chinese classical garden landscape, spacious rooms with terraces, and an excellent location. Baihua Commercial Street is right outside the door. The disadvantage is that the front desk staff has a blunt attitude. When we need to issue paper invoices, they told us that the financial invoice is not available and they lack professionalism. Literacy, why can‚Äôt customers issue paper invoices if they need them? Your hotel should prepare the paper invoice in advance. If you can‚Äôt issue it in three words, no one can answer it confidently. Besides, in the breakfast room, there are many customers, and there are often no cups or plates. You have to wait. If the fruit is gone, I ask the waiter and I am told that it is half past ten, but it is no more. I will not provide it to you for one more minute. Generally speaking, if you are looking for cost-effectiveness, you can consider this hotel. If you require high-quality service, you don't need to consider it. After all, the price is here.

msg:After looking at many hotels in Yalong Bay, I chose Huayu with a score of 4.5. I stayed for one day and extended my stay for another day the next day. I still thought it was pretty good. The five-star service was present throughout the entire process, from check-in to check-in. The room, concierge, front desk, and guest rooms all have the warmth of a five-star hotel. The room we stayed in was on the seventh floor of Building 2, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 50 square meters. The balcony looked out to an eye-catching green, and the air was so clean. In the standard room we booked, a family of four slept on beds pushed together. The guest room aunt specially laid out two layers of sheets for us and sewed the middle one up. It was so nice! On the first day we arrived at the hotel, the two kids couldn't scream when they went to play in the swimming pool. When they came back, half a tank of water was filled in the bathtub in the bathroom. The two kids were very happy to take a bath in it! However, the rooms are indeed old, but the hotels here are basically old, there are no new hotels, but the quality of the room facilities is there, so this can be ignored. . Although Huayu does not have sea view rooms, the price of less than 1,000 is really impressive. It takes about ten minutes to walk through the Baihuagu commercial area at the door to the beach. Once you reach the beach, there is the hotel's service area on the left, and lounge chairs and bath towels are available for hotel guests. , which is quite convenient. Baihua Valley is also convenient for eating. I recommend Coconut Chicken and Coconut Chicken. It tastes great and the service is good! In short, if you are not required to live in a sea view room, in fact, after living in Sanya for more than a week, I personally feel that there is no need to live in a sea view room every day. This mountain view room is also very good and cost-effective. It is good to choose Huayu. It has meals, transportation and services. Both large and small swimming pools are worth the price.

I came here with a normal heart, but unexpectedly it was very good and the room was very nice. Big, although a bit old, the hygiene is completely OK, and the service staff are very enthusiastic! It's only a three- to five-minute walk from the beach. The hotel also has its own deck chairs. There are seats available every day, so you won't be stuck without a seat. I suddenly got gastroenteritis on the third day. Because my family needed to take care of their children in the hotel, I tentatively asked the hotel if they could find someone to accompany me. The hotel actually sent a staff member to accompany me, starting at around 7 p.m. , until one o'clock in the morning, he stayed with me for medical trea**ent and infusion without any complaints. Afterward, he asked me if I was healed. It was very heart-warming and super satisfying! Come again next time!

msg:Because of the heavy rain in Haikou, I needed to stay in Yalong Bay for an extra day. I chose this hotel based on the comprehensive cost-effectiveness. The hotel is quite satisfactory and has the five-star feeling of Sanya promoted by the travel agency.
1. The facilities are too old, and the carpets in the corridors are full of stains; the room is a little damp, and the quilts are damp, but the service is good and they help with dehumidification in time.
2. Heavy rain finally has a way to kill time:
Children's sand digging toy experience for 3 hours,
Table tennis or snooker experience (30 minutes)
Naughty Castle parent-child activities
These are not bad, but the environment is very average
3. The breakfast in the hotel is worrying. It is on the level of a high-quality express hotel. There is too little to eat. I originally thought that the Westin and Hilton were so good. When I came here, I missed and cherished it.
4. The lakeside restaurant should win in terms of cost-effectiveness. Two large and one small 388, which is cheaper than barbecue outside. The environment and taste cannot be complimented. There are more choices in Baihua Valley. Nanhai Li Village is good. The food is large and can fit less than three people. Eat all 300 special dishes
However, the price is around 700 during the May Day period. The room is big enough and the location is good. I‚Äôm very grateful. Let‚Äôs bring an end to our trip to Sanya.

msg:The overall evaluation is 3.8 points.
Let‚Äôs talk about the good part first:
Next to the hotel is a commercial street with many restaurants and supermarkets. It's only a 5-minute walk from the beach, which is very convenient.
The internal environment of the hotel is well created, with small gardens everywhere. It's also very clean and the cleaning staff is always cleaning.
The service staff are very patient and have a good attitude.
The room is very large, the floor height is estimated to be close to 4 meters. This time the waiter arranged a room on the 5th floor. It is not damp at all and the lighting is good.
The mattress is moderately soft and hard, and comes with two types of pillows, one of which should be memory foam, which suits me very well.
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings:
The hotel was renovated in 18 years, but the facilities in the room look very old.
1: The paint on the hanger on which the clothes are hung has peeled off and there are mold spots. I really don‚Äôt want to hang the clothes on it. Why not replace it? It‚Äôs not expensive.
2. In the room, there is a lamp directly above the bed. It is always on and cannot be turned off. Luckily I had a blindfold on.
3. The water temperature is not too hot, and it feels better to be 4~5¬∞ higher.
4. The toiletries provided by the hotel feel very cheap. They are even inferior to some homestays. They shouldn't be and they don't cost much. Especially the cloth slippers, which are like those provided by hotels for about 100 yuan. There are water stains in the washing area and they are slippery to step on. If the elderly are prone to falling, it is considered a safety hazard.
5. The food is the most worthy of complaint. There are quite a few breakfast styles, but they are not of high quality and taste average. Desserts are like regular cake shop cheap fare. There is a little bit of Hainanese special food, which is not delicious!
The most needful thing to complain about is the buffet barbecue hot pot in the evening. There are only a few dishes, and desserts are used to make up for it.
Except for one chicken wing, the hot pot only has vegetarian dishes. There are also some frozen meatballs from the technologically advanced Sea Overlord.
Please, it‚Äôs hot pot! Get some vegetable soup! The key price is not cheap either.
From now on, you don‚Äôt need to order meals when you stay in a hotel. You‚Äôll find a commercial street right outside your door, and there‚Äôs plenty to eat!
I guess the reason why hotel catering is like this is because it can't compete with outsiders, so it's easy to settle down!

There are many restaurants nearby. You can reach the beach in five minutes' walk and near Baihua Valley. It's close to the seaside, the rooms are large, and all the service staff are very friendly and highly recommended. It's cost-effective, but there's not much food nearby. The service provided by Chen Huanhuan at the front desk was very good and the overall value for money was good.

The air conditioning is also good. The receptionist is also very enthusiastic. He says hello every time he comes in. There is free service. Parking space, five-star hotel is very upscale and elegant. I will choose this hotel next time. Manager Chen Qing is praised here by his real name and his service attitude is very good. The hotel lobby is decorated in a good style, antique and very grand. The quality is worthy of the price.

Hygiene: The hotel bathroom is very clean and tidy

Facilities: The facilities are a bit old, but overall they are OK and there are no problems.
Service: The ladies and brothers here are very enthusiastic and took the initiative to help us with our luggage when they saw us. There are several lifeguards at the swimming pool, and they are there to fish for leaves when there are no guests swimming.
 
Clown show: There are many shows for children in this hotel, which is especially suitable for bringing children to play.

Outer Space Children's Park: It's quite good, very big, and the teacher brings the children to play games and dance, and just throw them in. I originally planned to stay one night to go to Haitang Bay, but it was very comfortable and I stayed for one more night.

Hygiene: The overall hygiene is not noticeable. The water in the swimming pool is not very clear. When you swim at night, you can clearly see the floating dirt.
Environment: The environment is not bad, it is a Chinese-style building
Service: The service is okay
It is recommended to add two more shuttle buses, which are not enough and require a long wait. During the National Day period, the price is twice as expensive as usual. The usual price is more cost-effective, but during the National Day period, the price-performance ratio is lower. There is a restaurant that is very delicious. It is the Sichuan seafood at Dazhuli. The ingredients are very good and fresh. It is the most satisfying meal I have ever had. I also recommend Yalong Bay. The water is so clear.
Outer Space Children's Paradise: It is worthy of praise, there are many activities, and the young lady is very kind!

The eggs, vegetables, bacon and meat in the deli section are also good, and there are 4 or 5 kinds of pasta that can be cooked fresh. Because I am a Ctrip platinum customer, I was upgraded to a larger room type when I checked in. The room service was also very good. Zhao Ling and another unknown girl were very attentive. We stayed for 4 days and decided to stay another night due to the cancellation of the flight. I like the lounge chairs and drying racks on the balcony the most. Just down from the hotel lobby is the Baihuagu Commercial Center, and across the road is the Seafood Plaza and Yalong Bay Beach, which are very convenient for eating, drinking and having fun. I sincerely recommend staying here for leisure and family travel.

2. The TV is still an old-fashioned analog signal, and there is no digital TV. There are also many shining snowflakes on the TV sets in the guest house, which is a terrible experience.
There are 3 suite rooms, one of which has no socket next to the bed, and the desk lamp and night light cannot be used. I wanted to ask the waiter for a power outlet to charge my phone, but the waiter sternly told me that there was no one! ! ! If necessary, please go to the supermarket downstairs to buy it yourself.
4 The smell in the room is very strong, and the cause of the smell cannot be found at all. Especially when I first entered the house, there was a smell of vomit after breakfast. Don't ask why it smells like this, because someone vomited while taking a boat to the underwater world. . .
5 The hotel's water supply stopped the morning after check-in, and the rooms on the first floor seemed to be leaking. During breakfast, the staff were busy making repairs, and the scene was quite embarrassing.
6 Breakfast is very average. Breakfast cost 199 per person at the Sheraton in the last two days, but the maximum here is 68.
Buffet seafood barbecue by the pool for 7 dinners, 198 is not very cost-effective. Any store in the business district is more cost-effective than here.
To sum up, the room rate of nearly 1,700 is really not as good as staying in any hotel next to the business district. Just open the map and search for it yourself.

Very satisfied with the service and the environment, but the room facilities are outdated, it would be more perfect if it can be redecorated, the swimming pool is very clean. The surrounding area is the Baihuagu business district. It is super convenient to eat. There are many places to eat when you leave the lobby. You can go to the beach just across the road, and there is also the hotel's exclusive beach. When you go to tell the room number, the staff will help you find free beach chairs! The service manager Huang at the front desk is very good, and he helps to deal with everything in time.

The bathroom is also very spacious, with wet and dry separation, and a bathtub~ The swimming pool is amazing. The large swimming pool in the first district is very big, and it is surrounded by trees. Swimming during the day can just block the sun. It is very beautiful, and it is also very beautiful at night. The children had a great time. It was a weekend and there were bubbles. Lie~ Downstairs is the Baihuagu Commercial Center, which is very convenient for eating and shopping~ At first I didn't know how to get to the seaside, I thought it would be far away, so I took the hotel battery car, and I knew how to get there after just one ride. It took less than 10 minutes to walk. It's very convenient~ It's just that the wifi sometimes doesn't work well, and the network is always disconnected...

msg:One of the worst hotels I've stayed in for over 10 years. Waiting for a room is acceptable, but waiting for 2 hours in a dirty room is completely unacceptable. I communicated many times and said 20 minutes, and finally complained on Ctrip for a total of 2 hours before it was resolved. The curtains in the room were broken and couldn't be closed at all. Sheets are leaky. Restaurant mouthcloths are exactly the same as dishcloths. Not as good as a youth hostel. The recommended price is 45 yuan a night, and it is not worth an extra 1 yuan to stay. I booked the room for the elders. The elders couldn't bear to check out at night. They were very, very dissatisfied. Please enjoy the pictures of Yibo Hotel, hoping to avoid lightning.

This time I stayed in Huayu in Sanya, overall I am very satisfied, the price is very high, the room is big, the breakfast is also very rich, there are several swimming pools, when the sun is hot, the children swim in the shaded pool. The location of the hotel is also very good, next to Baihua Valley, it is very convenient to eat. It's also very close to the beach, 10 minutes' walk, the beach is fine and soft, very suitable for children to play. Going to the beach and returning to the room can be picked up by the hotel's battery car, which is really very convenient! The room type I ordered also comes with a hot pot set meal for two, and the dishes are also very rich and plentiful. We stayed for 6 days and 5 nights, and the service attitude of every hotel staff we met was very good. Many people commented that the facilities are old, but I personally don‚Äôt think so. Generally speaking, this trip is very satisfactory, and I will come again next time!

msg:I booked a parent-child room. The child is very happy when he enters the room. There is a swimming pool downstairs. There are at least 6 parent-child activities every day, so you can bring your child no matter what the weather is. The hotel's facilities are not very old, but they are not new, but it does not affect the experience of staying. The sanitation of the corridors really needs to be improved. I live in District 3. When the 3 elevators go out, there is always a smell of stinky feet in the corridor on the left. The sanitation of the room, swimming pool and other places is no problem. The environment is very beautiful, the overall style is Chinese style, and the surrounding vegetation is very comprehensive. It is also due to the vegetation coverage, the ponds, and the mosquitoes and frogs. The only way to prevent mosquitoes is to spray toilet water. Frogs are more annoying, especially at night. If you don‚Äôt sleep well, don‚Äôt live too low, and stay away from the side of the pond. The buffet breakfast provided by the hotel is okay. There are too many people and few seats. If the seats are outside, there are either sun or mosquitoes. The back door of the hotel directly enters the Baihua Valley. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. After leaving the Baihua Valley, walk another 100 meters to the beach. It is very close, and the hotel also provides a shuttle bus.
The overall feeling is still very good, and the price/performance ratio is very high, so there are some small shortcomings, which I think are acceptable. In short, the price/performance ratio is very high!

Compared with many hotels, Huayu has the largest area for the same room type, so I will book it Huayu family room, I was very satisfied as soon as I entered the room, it was big enough and spacious enough, I directly renewed the reservation for 5 nights, and I didn't want to bother to change hotels. The next day, I found that the clothes in the north-facing room were not easy to dry, so I went to the front desk and asked if I could change to a south-facing room. It happened that the front desk manager, Jenny, was there, and she helped me find a south-facing room when she learned that our two children needed washing and drying. Later, if there was no suitable one, they simply upgraded the room type for me for free. The hotel service is really impeccable, responsive, the location is also great, and the price/performance ratio is very high. It is very suitable for our second-child family. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Huayu again. Thanks again Jenny!

Although the location is not as good as the first-tier hotels such as Tianyu and Mangrove, it is very cost-effective. The beach of Yalong Bay is just across the Baihua Valley, but the price is only half of Tianyu. Disadvantage 1. The high cost performance results in a lot of people staying in the hotel. The hotel facilities are still a bit old, and there is no exhaust device in the bathroom. 2. The breakfast is really average, enough for two days.

The hotel is a Chinese-style garden hotel, very large, with free parking lot, free facilities, free swimming pool, etc. The hotel service is very good and the breakfast is also good.
The location is also very convenient. The Baihuagu commercial street is just outside the hotel gate. All kinds of food are available. You can't go to the room to order takeaway, so you have to go to the lobby to get it yourself.
There are three beds in the room, and the extra one is a tatami-like low sofa bed. If you mind, you should pay attention. The hotel room is air-conditioned and cooled 24 hours a day, and there is a balcony where you can dry clothes. It is relatively close to the beach of Yalong Bay, across the commercial street You can get to the beach in about five minutes. There are amu*****t facilities and self-service vending machines downstairs in the room, which are basically convenient. Recommended!

I didn't expect that I chose the right one! It was originally a family room, but the hotel upgraded it to a luxury suite, more than 100 square meters, when the hotel saw that I had brought a child. The surrounding environment is quiet and clean. It is very close and convenient to Sanya Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park and Wuzhizhou Island. It takes 5 minutes to walk to the beach. This is the most satisfying trip in recent years. I will stay here again when I come to Sanya next time. I hope it will be as good as ever!

The security guards are very responsible. When I went to pick up things in the car two nights, they would follow me and watch my movements in the car to confirm whether the car was mine and ensure the safety of the car.
In the future, I will choose Huayu if I have the opportunity. Definitely recommend.
The surrounding supporting facilities are very complete, and the Baihuagu business district has everything to eat and drink. The hotel building has very garden features, and it is very prominent overlooking the Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park.

The service is very good. The staff at the front desk gave a very detailed introduction when we checked in. There is a little brother like Chen Linong among the doormen who is very good at helping to deliver the luggage. The older lady who cleans the guest room greets me every time I meet her, and the water is delivered very quickly. .

Maybe it is because of the guest house, so Huayu took the commoner route. The restaurant does not have many kinds of food and replenishment is slow, and the plates used are all plastic. In fact, the room is pretty good, and I hope to maintain it well so that Huayu will not become a high-end farmhouse.

As expected of a resort hotel, the concierge service is very good. There are sightseeing cars to pick you up to the beach or your residence. There are also many outdoor swimming pools. Children like to play in the water here. There is also a children's playground. If the weather is too hot, you can play indoors directly; it is also close to the beach. It's very close, mainly because the seaside and the hotel's sun loungers can be used for free, which is really great. The parent-child room where I live with my baby is very big, with a bunk bed, a large balcony where you can lie down and rest, and a small triangular tent. The hotel provided a travel photo as a gift, but unfortunately I found out that I was crying after I checked out; the swimming pool and bubble baths for children and other activities are all available. You don‚Äôt need to go to the scenic spots, just lying in the hotel is enough. Walking through the hotel lobby is Baihua Valley, a street for eating and drinking. The night view is very beautiful, and the price is understandable. The only thing that made me unsatisfied was that there was no room temperature water at the breakfast buffet. I asked for a glass of cold water with a sippy cup for my child, but I was given a glass of hot water. Fortunately, I drank it first. My tongue was scalded and hurt for 2 days. Picked up again.

Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, it didn't affect us at all. Check in (it is recommended that the mattress can be changed), the breakfast is still so rich, next time I have a chance to stay again!

The room is luxurious, with a 2.7-meter large bed + a 2-meter round bed, and the decoration is high-grade.
The unhygienic, untimely cleaning, and smell problems mentioned in the previous comments do not exist at all.
Dining is very convenient
There is also a children's playground upstairs in the hall
To pick up the car to the beach, in fact, it only takes five minutes to walk by yourself. Very convenient.
We also went to Tianyu and Mangrove for a circle, very close.
Luxury quality, common people's price. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely stay at Huayu Hotel!

The beach is very close, and it takes only 5 minutes to walk there. The service is very good. There are round-trip shuttles to and from the beach, and we try our best to meet the needs of our residents. Second, the ladies at the front desk are super gentle, and the environment is still very good! In general, Yalong Bay is really cost-effective, about half of the price at the seaside. It is also very close to the forest park, and it is recommended for couples or children.

Both the ground parking space in front of the door and the underground garage can be parked for free. Typical royal garden style, pavilions, flowers, green plants, swimming pool... pleasing to the eye, worthy of being called "Sanya Forbidden City". The front desk service is enthusiastic and proactive, which makes people feel good. In particular, Wang Xin and Xiao Shi's thoughtful and meticulous arrangements left a deep impression on me and my family. The location is superior, adjacent to the Baihuagu Commercial Street, where you can find everything you need for dining, leisure, and frugality. The beach is just across the road, and it is also very convenient to go to scenic spots such as Yalong Bay Forest Park. Indeed, the price/performance ratio is very high, and I will still choose Huayu next time.

Next time I come again, I will definitely not choose other hotels. This time, in order to experience different hotel styles, I also stayed in Pullman and Atlantis. To be honest, it is really not as good as staying in Huayu for 7 days. The average daily room rate is about 800. The shuttle bus will take you to the sea, and you will be picked up and delivered by the surrounding Internet celebrity seafood stalls. You can also have a bite at Baihuagu Commercial Street later in the day. It is so convenient and comfortable. The consumption at Yate is too high, and if you stay for one day, it will cost Huayu for a week. Not to mention Pullman, too bad. Huayu's Children's Paradise is very large, children are the happiest to play, the room is also very convenient to enter and exit, it is very convenient to go to and from the sea to the room. Let‚Äôs not talk about the others, if you go on your own legs, it‚Äôs a long distance, and you‚Äôll be exhausted after playing for a while, and if you let the child hold you, you‚Äôll be invincible, as any parent knows. So to sum up, Arima is very cost-effective and can make guests feel very free. There is no butler, but it is also very convenient to do it yourself. It is very convenient to eat, and it is also very happy for children to play. Highly recommended! ! ! Next time I go to Hainan, I will definitely stay in Huayu. I hope Huayu officials can see it.

The little brother at the front desk of the hotel is very nice. The Yanoda ticket saw that the child we brought with us may be close to 1.2 meters, so he gave an extra ticket. Although he didn't go in the end, he felt very considerate. The lady who cleaned the room was very nice and greeted her warmly. Every time there was a need, she actively and quickly resolved it.

msg:I was fooled by the photos... The room is quite big and the activities are suitable, so I booked it. How should I put it... the living experience is really hard to describe! I didn't tell anything when I checked in, and I didn't mention the afternoon tea in the package I ordered. It's all up to me! Carry by yourself, find your own room and take your luggage by yourself. I live in District 2, which is so hot that I don't even want to live there! Quilt tide, house tide! A musty smell! After changing to a higher floor, it is still tide! The room is still tripping! There are too many places to complain. I don't want to talk about it! I originally wanted to stay a few more nights, but with the accommodation conditions, I quickly packed my luggage and left! But the good thing is that the problem is solved very quickly. The window and door locks were broken on the first night, so they came to fix it. After changing the room, there was no electricity in the morning, and the response was quickly resolved! The check-in hall is the passage to Baihua Valley, which is quite chaotic! Very confusing. There are still few waiters! Everything depends on yourself...but there are a lot of people staying. Maybe I'm the only one who doesn't get used to it... The comments are very tangled, it's my real experience of staying! Everyone must read the bad reviews before booking a room. Really helpful! I took photos of the good side, and I didn't take any photos of the bad ones! Sorry...

I always wanted to choose a cost-effective hotel in Yalong Bay to stay for two days. I saw Ctrip‚Äôs Huayu for many days, and it really lived up to expectations. The environment is beautiful. The scenery is pleasant. The layout and facilities of the hotel are very good. There are two swimming pools. The small one is constant temperature and is very suitable for children to play in the water. There are many restaurants and businesses near the hotel. It takes 5 minutes to walk to Yalong Bay. You only need to pass through the hotel's large swimming pool Just across a road, the service staff are very enthusiastic, especially the younger brother Wang Zexiong at the front desk, who has a great service attitude. He helped to introduce the layout of the hotel and the surrounding dining environment. Thank you very much. The most humane thing is that the hotel gives guests free of charge on the beach of Yalong Bay Deck chairs and umbrella sheds are provided, just report the room number and register, and the room is cleaned in a timely manner. I am very satisfied with the experience and will stay again next time!

Let‚Äôs talk about the flaws: the reservation was too hot, the room type was changed four times in five days, and the room was moved four times. In the end, the front desk saw that I was really tired from moving, and agreed to extend my stay in the original room for three days. Finally, I had a perfect and relaxing holiday experience.
Self-service barbecue hot pot seafood meal‚ÜíIf the seafood dishes are fresh and fresh, it is worthy of the a**osphere of this environment, even if the price is a little higher. In addition, it is very friendly to children. Various pastries, fruit cakes and desserts are enough
Objectively speaking: Humidity, do you want this atoll pool house to be humid? It‚Äôs a bit of a joke, right?
Mosquito problem can be solved with toilet water
The front desk and the waiters are very warm and patient. I feel very comfortable during the Chinese New Year.

The scene after entering the room is like the photo. There is no cleaning at all, and a large bucket of garbage is included. The dark corridor was empty, and the old man didn't come to find the waiter. He could only call me with his children in such a messy room. After I complained, the hotel sent a waiter to clean it. The elderly and children are dragging their tired bodies, unable to go to the bathroom, let alone rest, so they can only go out to find a place to eat. In a hotel, this kind of basic operation cannot be done. I really don't know how to evaluate the old people and children left in the dirty room. Please ask before booking if cleaning can be provided.

msg:We have moved from Huayu Hotel to the Yingbin Hotel not far away.
I have to say that Huayu made me want to stay again.
Very cost-effective family room (including three breakfasts) 771 a day
The location of the hotel should not be too convenient, there are various convenience stores and restaurants when you go out
The downside is that there is a resident singer at the entrance of the restaurant, which is a bit noisy at night. It will be fine after 10:30, and the sound will be much quieter when you close the balcony door
All kinds of enthusiastic services, grounded, not cold, I want to take online classes in the room, and found that the hotel's wifi speed is not very fast, the hotel sent someone to install a separate cat in my room within five minutes
A rich breakfast, a swimming pool filled with hot water in winter (children have a great time playing), this is the most important, after all, you can‚Äôt afford to go to the sea every day
The hotel has a takeaway counter, it's very convenient to order takeaway
The swimming pool is open until 10:30 in the evening. The guest house is not allowed to play at 8 o'clock, and the cold water is so cold that I didn't dare to go into the water for fear of catching a cold.
The rooms booked at the Yingbin Hotel are 400 more expensive than Huayu‚Äôs one day, but the experience is not as good as Huayu‚Äôs. You still have to stay in the hotel to know which one is better, not necessarily expensive
Suggestions: 1. The door of the room is very tight. If you try to open it, you will hit a big mirror behind the door. I was a little shocked when I touched it. Later, I put the suitcase behind to prevent it from being smashed. It is recommended to install an anti-collision *****
2. There is no towel rack in the room, and there is no place to hang the towels you bring, you can only hang them in the shower
Because the child is already big, the children's playground did not experience it
I hope Huayu will get better and better, because I will stay again next timeüòä

3. Ask the front desk to provide a thermometer, has such a big hotel informed you?
4. Not only the toilet smells bad, but even the sink smells bad, so I had to find something to block the sink. We have a lot of luggage, we have two children with us, and we are exhausted after just getting pregnant. Our family endured the smell and lived for three days (it was decided at the beginning)

msg:I seldom comment, or even give a bad review. Let‚Äôs talk about the check-in experience. I checked in at 13:40 in the afternoon. I took the room card and said that I can check in after cleaning for an hour. I put the luggage in the room and returned to the room at 15:30. , The room was still not cleaned after an hour and a half. At that time, it was really a bit over the top. I asked the waiter to argue that the waiter said you should complain, and you should go to the front desk to complain. Is this the attitude that a five-star hotel should have? Waited at the front desk for half an hour before it was dealt with. I changed to a room that had just been cleaned. I didn't find it when I entered the room. The longer I stayed, the more I felt that the smell was wrong. The smell of urine permeated the air. Dinner I told the front desk that there was a smell in the room, and I asked the waiter to deal with it. I called at 9 o'clock in the evening and said that the smell was gone. When I returned to the room at 23:30, the smell was even stronger. The air conditioner was still broken. I was really helpless and asked the front desk again I want to change the room. We are a couple traveling and said that we will give us a parent-child room. I want to ask if it is a joke? I don‚Äôt know how long after we packed up our luggage and waited at the front desk, they conjured up another room, sometimes saying no, sometimes saying no, how can this kind of hotel be rated as five stars? I spent 987 yuan to live in a hotel, which is not as good as üâêÔ∏è experience. I changed the room three times, and the smell of urine is really disgusting to me!

The window of the room I stayed in was not facing well, and I could see the direction of the Baihuagu commercial street. I was very dissatisfied with this. The room is large, with a large bathtub, and the sanitation is not bad. It's very convenient to eat and take out, because it's in Baihuagu, not far from the seaside, within ten minutes' walk. The breakfast in the hotel is not bad, there are many types, there are two places where you can have breakfast, and the people will not be very crowded. There are fewer parent-child activities, and the bubble party is now cancelled. After checking out, I don‚Äôt know why I received a call about whether to continue the stay more than two hours later. On the second day after checking out, I found that a piece of clothing for the child might have been left in the room. Can be mailed and self-collected. If you don‚Äôt take the initiative to ask, will the clothes not be kept? Why didn‚Äôt the customer service contact me after check-out? This hotel is very dissatisfied with the handling!

What I don't understand is that when I checked in to a room that was repeatedly emphasized to be quiet, I had to give me a loudspeaker facing the street that kept ringing. I made two calls to the service desk and ended up being changed to a very quiet room. Why do I have to bother when I already have a room? What about me? The air conditioner in the house is like a tractor. Fortunately, the weather in Sanya is cool recently and there is no need to turn on the air conditioner. . .

The king bed room on the third floor of Building 2 is large enough, and the garden view room has its own balcony, and the scenery is very fresh. I feel that if it is given to Building 1, it will be a bit noisy. On one side is the built-in Baihuagu business, and on the other side is the outdoor heated swimming pool, which is not too quiet. You can walk to the beach in 5 minutes. There is a large supermarket next to it. You don‚Äôt have to worry about eating and drinking. There are also several small convenience stores. Shopping is very convenient.
Let me talk about a few disadvantages, first: I arrived at the hotel a bit early, around 12:30, and I verified the check-in information in advance. The front desk said that the room has not been packed yet, and if I have to wait, I will go to the Baihuagu commercial street below Turned around, ate a Danjia seafood, and went to the front desk until it was almost 15 o'clock, and told the room that the room hadn't been cleaned up... I don't know what the registration information is for, and I didn't arrange to clean the room first, which made it difficult Luggage and so on have been unable to be placed; second, there are only stairs from the underground parking lot to the room, about 10 steps, in case of pushing a stroller, wheelchair or something, it is basically impossible to go directly from the underground parking lot; third, if Figure 6. The TV is too old, or the signal equipment is too old. You can basically see the figure and listen to the voice. After watching for a long time, the eyes can't stand it...

The room was large, clean overall, had a refrigerator, a large bathroom, and the accommodation was comfortable. It was not as bad as some reviews said. The musty smell was not strong and no mosquitoes or cockroaches were seen. Looking at your phone after turning off the lights will attract very small flying insects, but not many. You can ask for the sheets to be changed every day, but there were a few holes in my sheets on two days. All are within the acceptable range. However, there are not many types of breakfast, and there are relatively few Western-style meals. I prefer freshly cooked noodles and Baoluo noodles. Overall, it matches the price very well and is a good choice for people with an average budget.

Next to it is the commercial street of Baihuagu. It takes only 2 minutes to walk to the public beach. It takes no more than 5 minutes to walk there. Put on your swimsuit, bathrobe, snacks, swimming ring, sand digging tools (sold along the road), where can you stay for a day?
The water is a bit cold, but it is very sunny. You must wear sunscreen clothes and hats.
It is recommended that when traveling, book a room for 2 days and play with peace of mind

The children are so happy that they swim for three or four hours every day. The hotel is very close to the seaside, about 500 meters on foot. The most important thing is that it is very close to Baihuagu Commercial Street, the only commercial street in Yalong Bay. It is just at the entrance of the hotel. The service of the hotel is also very good. The room is super big and well equipped. Will choose again next time.

When there is no blue sky and white clouds, this hotel is very suitable for transition. On the contrary, Cai Die Xuan, a Chinese restaurant, has made some progress this time. I moved to other hotels in Yalong Bay. I also like to go to Baihua Valley to eat at this restaurant. After all, I do nucleic acid every day. After eating, I can drop by. A "free enough" supermarket, suitable for novices.

This time Haitang Bay came here to experience it specially! The perfect combination of the hotel's antique flavor and modernity gives people visual enjoyment!
    The location of the hotel is superior, it is perfectly integrated with the commercial street, and it is quiet in the middle of the bustle, enriching the multiple choices of food, leisure and entertainment!
    The happiest thing was to meet the manager Wei who received us. She took the initiative and enthusiasm to provide customers with high-quality services within the scope of her authority, and made people feel more comfortable in the communication process. His speech and demeanor fully reflect the professionalism of high-end hotel practitioners! impressive!

    I will choose here again on my next trip to Yalong Bay!

msg:The price/performance ratio of this hotel is really high. I originally booked this hotel in May, but because of the renovation, I was changed to the Guest House, and I missed it. I originally wanted to book a one-day itinerary this time, but I didn't expect the child to refuse to change as soon as he entered the room. The little yellow duck parent-child room is very warm, there are building blocks toys that children like, small tents, and super cute children's toiletry sets, little yellow duck bathrobes. The details of the hotel are also in place, the toilet has a toilet mat for children, and there is a footstool for the washstand. The room is spacious, more than 60 square meters, and the balcony faces the garden with a panoramic view. The Kids Club is even the favorite of children, and they can't get out after soaking in it. The price is also very shocking, more than 300, including breakfast. The most gratifying thing is that the waiters, the front desk, etc. are very enthusiastic. They prepared small dolls for the baby, delivered fruit to the room, and upgraded the room type for free. Special thanks to Xiaofu on duty at the front desk, Wang Xin, waiters Lu Jin, and Li Chunli for their warm and thoughtful reception. Will definitely visit again next time

It is in the Baihuagu business district, and it is very lively at night. Manager Fu at the front desk upgraded the room for us. The room is very spacious, with a balcony, a bathtub, and when you open the window, you will see coconut trees and the swimming pool. It is really beautiful. Manager Fu is very serious and responsible. Wechat consultation can be done whenever you want, and he also contacts us with the guest room on rest days. Thank you very much. There are also free Internet celebrity swimming rings available, and those with children can also experience fish feeding and other activities in the area. The hotel is very cost-effective, and it is also very close to the forest park. I will choose and recommend it next time. Finally, I would like to thank Manager Xia Fu for his enthusiastic service in the past few days.

Hygiene: Hygiene is acceptable, without fault.
Environment: The environment is not very good. Although the Baihuagu commercial street supporting the hotel is in the hotel, it is very convenient to eat and drink, but the overall privacy and security are greatly affected. Free entry and exit of the hotel, the security aspect is really worrying.
Service: The hotel at this price has no high service requirements, and it can only be said that it is slightly better than the economical one.
Room type upgrade: When checking in, ask the front desk if there is a room upgrade, and the front desk informs it that it is a deluxe double room. When I took out the order and showed it to the front desk to see the confirmed room type upgrade benefits, the front desk reluctantly said that I will upgrade you one level. , I don't care about upgrading or not, just as a hotel, what does it mean that you don't give the guests the courtesy?
Yuerui Club Spa - 100 yuan SPA voucher: There is no voucher for check-in, and there is no introduction to how to use the package included in the reservation.

msg:This time I stayed at the Sanya Huayu Resort Hotel, and I felt that it was excellent value for money. After the room we booked, we upgraded it for free. Because the hotel is an old five-star hotel, the air conditioner is an old-fashioned air conditioner, and the cooling is not very ideal. , contact the front desk Lin Mingying to change the room again, the air conditioning of the new room is obviously much better. During the whole process of changing rooms, the service attitude was very good, and they also helped with luggage.

Part of the hotel swimming pool is open, and part of it is under maintenance. Because of the low occupancy rate, very few people come down to play in the water, in twos and threes. There is a hammock in the yard, no one will come back anytime, the experience of few people is really great.

The hotel breakfast is very simple, with pasta, bread, fruit and milk drinks, but there are very few choices. The restaurant only provides pasta for lunch and dinner, but the taste is good. The noodles are freshly made and very chewy. I ordered tomato egg noodles, oil splash noodles, and eggplant meat sauce noodles!

There is a nucleic acid testing point near the hotel. It takes less than eight minutes to walk. If you don‚Äôt want to walk to the front desk, there is also a free battery car. The concierge manager Steve Li Kangjun, who is driving, is very helpful and will introduce you to attractions near the hotel. Ask if you need mineral water, and you can ask the battery car to wait when you come back from the nucleic acid. It is specially reminded that because the nucleic acid detection point is at the seaside, you can also go directly to the seaside to play after the nucleic acid is done.

If you go to the beach to play with your children, you can ask the staff of the children's park to borrow sand digging tools. The hotel borrows sand tools for one hour for free. When we came, the occupancy rate was very low and there was no stipulated return time. Pretty happy. The hotel has a 600-square-meter children's playground that is also open for free. You can also get fish food to feed the fish for free here, because the child wants to feed the next day and buy it here, but the hotel does not sell fish food. I gave a pack for free. I am really grateful. I forgot the name of the young lady. In short, I am very grateful to the staff of the children's park. Only the small details can feel the attentiveness and caring of the service.

The hotel as a whole is a Chinese garden style, one step at a time, no matter how you take it, it looks good. There are many wedding photographers shooting here.

Pertinent comments The hotel is definitely worth the money now, but the hotel is not a new hotel, the room facilities are a little outdated, not as comfortable as the new five-star hotel bedding, and the air conditioner is also an old-fashioned air conditioner. In addition, the hotel's environment and The service is absolutely superb. Close to the beach, it is also convenient to do nucleic acid.

The price is right and the service is in place. There are also free travel photography and flamingo swimming rings. The rental cost is fifty to sixty-one hours, and it is also free. Next time, I will continue to explore interesting and delicious things. I really regret that I didn't continue my stay, and I changed the city to catch a plane.

msg:The hotel is located in Baihua Valley. After looking through the photos for 15 years, I found that I had taken pictures at the gate of the hotel at that time. The air-conditioning is sufficient, the air on the 6th floor is good, the sun is good, and it is very quiet. The room feels a little outdated, but it is still clean. The cleaning lady who was in charge of the floor in those days was very serious and responsible, very kind and patient. It's a pity that I forgot to ask the name. It's the eldest sister who is serving on the 6th floor of Building 2, No. 21-28. I would like to give a big compliment.
Besides, the hotel is generally good, and the staff responds to questions in a timely manner. It is very busy to catch up. It is really difficult for the service staff to be comprehensive, which may cause some guests' dissatisfaction, but they are very understandable and watch them answering questions non-stop for a minute. , Check-in and check-out, after all, you only have one mouth, two eyes and two hands, right? With more tolerance and understanding, your feelings will be different. There are three swimming pools in the hotel. I only went to the two below Building 2. I didn't go there with the children's slide. The swimming pool is very clean and the design is very reasonable.
The beach service also surprised me. I have been to Tianyu and other hotels before, and the beach service is nothing more than the registration room number of the mat and bath towel, but Mr. Wu Xurong is very enthusiastic. He looked at me and the child and helped me find the swimming ring. Moderate Ask if you want to play marine projects. When we say no to play, there is no unpleasant feeling, no over-selling, you can choose according to your own preferences, and add chicken legs to Master Xu~
I booked a pool room for 2 nights, which was not satisfactory. The comment should be placed in another order, but fortunately, the hotel also solved it.
The overall price/performance ratio is not bad. If you care about services and facilities, and pursue perfection with children (under 10 years old), it is recommended to choose a five-star or higher hotel, and don‚Äôt ask for the facilities and services of a few hundred yuan for the five-star standard. Then give a bad review, it is not fair to the hotel, in all fairness, personal opinion.

In the king-size bed room at the swimming pool where I stayed, two children screamed until 2:40 in the morning on the first night, and they even cursed the child's mother in Cantonese. The second night was even more speechless. I was sitting on a pool chair, and a man next door came in from the bushes of the pool next door... During breakfast and check-out, a customer was making noise, making a loud and cussing sound. The hotel service is very good and the location is also very good, but the quality of the customers is generally very poor. If you are traveling alone or as a couple, do not book that room type because the children will keep screaming.

I booked a poolside room in the summer, and I was looking forward to it with the elderly and children, but I was assigned to the underground room in the annex building. There was a strange smell in the corridor, and I was even more shocked when I entered the room. The so-called swimming pool is a small pool of several square meters, and there is sewage all around. Overflowing, completely inconsistent with the room type promotion. I communicated with the front desk immediately to confirm. The front desk said that it would be randomly arranged + no room replacement, and then it was ruined. I had no choice but to communicate with Ctrip‚Äôs customer service. Ctrip‚Äôs attitude was very good. After many repeated communications with the merchant, I was changed to a swimming pool room in the main building the next day. The environment of the rooms in the main building and the swimming pool are basically consistent with the promotional pictures. After checking in this time, I felt that there was a problem with the front desk service of the business. As the first window of contact with guests, it represents the image of the hotel. However, it was not at all proactive in dealing with customers' needs and had an attitude of being in love with them. Later, Manager Wang of the Guest Depar**ent came forward to coordinate. It made us feel better, and we didn't check in until the evening. I hope the hotel will strengthen staff training. Figure 123 is the swimming pool room in the annex building, and Figure 4 is the swimming pool room in the main building. Finally, I would like to thank Ctrip customer service Jiajia and Huayu manager Wang Xin for their coordination, otherwise the holiday mood would have been ruined.

msg:It is a very cost-effective hotel in Yalong Bay. The building is Chinese, but it is a bit old, including the wooden furniture and doors of the rooms are broken and painted. But for the average person price is king. The reception hall is very transparent. To the south is the Baihuagu Commercial Center, and across the road to the south is the Tianyu Hotel. In the past, it was the beach. Before 6:30 p.m., Huayu also had his own beach chairs to manage. Compared with the mangrove Bodhi in Sanya Bay, where we stayed the night before, the advantage is that the sand in Yalong Bay is white and fine, the water is very clean, and it is close to the beach. The shortcomings are obvious and the room conditions are not as good. The swimming pool is not deep, only 1.4 meters, and the room rate includes 1 hour of net red swimming rings, flamingos or unicorns, not many, sometimes you need to wait for others to return before you can borrow it. However, from the front desk to other waiters is still very good, the service awareness is relatively strong. If you don't have breakfast, you can buy it yourself in the commercial street, or take out from Grandpa McKenzie's house. The younger brother at the front desk booked a trip to Yalong Bay Tropical Forest Park, which is 5 kilometers away, which is cheaper than buying tickets online, and there is also a special car.

msg:Come on, I finally have time to comment on the hotel today. The overall evaluation of hotel hardware, software, location, etc. is good, the following is my dog blood experience
At noon and the child (the hottest time) came to the hotel to check in, because the mother and daughter took the child, and hoped to be closer to the lobby and easy to access. When I entered the room, I was shocked, there was a door, I didn't know that the hotel had a connecting door, it felt strange for a while (picture 1), so I took my child to the front desk and hoped to change to a room without a connecting door. Well, the strange experience began. I remember it very clearly. She was a big-bellied front desk sister who helped me find it for a long, long, long time, and finally found a room with no connecting door. However, in the main building is the furthest from the lobby. Well, I accept that there is no connecting door. Half an hour after entering the house, I wiped the bathroom and other places with disinfectant wipes (before the epidemic, it was safer to disinfect it, after all, the toilet, remote control, bedside table, etc. were used by countless people). Later, it became hotter and hotter. I went to the corridor to ask the staff who cleaned the room, and learned that 501 and 502 were the only two air conditioners in the hotel that were broken. (At this point I got angry all of a sudden). It took so long for the big belly to give a room without air conditioning (the hotel's excuse is that they don't know either. Well, you don't know, the consumer will pay). Then change the room for me. Why do you have all the rooms when I get on fire? (At first, the excuse was that the room was full, and the room would have to wait. What should I do!!!)
I have always thought that women who are pregnant and want to be mothers will definitely become more kind, but not all of them are. In the end it is not intentional to give me a broken air conditioner, there must be no solution here. Go to the front desk to be reasonable, the front desk still doesn't believe me, and said to check whether the air conditioner is broken (I really want to **** here, am I lying to you if the air conditioner is not cooling? Do I need it on a hot day?) The front desk (no That big belly) accompany us to sit in the room and wait, and he couldn't stand the heat, so he muttered to himself, "It's quite hot." Why wait in the room? Because I spoke loudly in the lobby, they thought it would affect the hotel's face, and a slightly fat employee who was carrying luggage said, "Go back to your room and wait." I really thank your family, a room without air conditioning, in the hottest noon in Sanya, this person can tell, I really appreciate his big physique.
The room has been changed and the air conditioner is also available, but what about the mood? Finally, at the end (not the beginning) the lobby manager was called out, why didn't you call the manager out in the first place? Why? The manager came out to solve the problem, okay, solved it. However, I still have to give a bad review of the pot belly unit at the front desk.
In the next few days, I didn't play in the hotel. When the child was swimming, I met the lovely lifeguard Shi Guangyou. He told us some delicious, fun and interesting places in Hainan. Only on the second day and the third day let my anger calm down a little, and the praise is only for Shi Guangyou.

Hygiene: average
Environment: Going out from the swimming pool and crossing the road, you can go to the seaside of Tianyu, which is a very good location
Service: Poor review with a big belly,

msg:After choosing on Ctrip for a long time, and seeing everyone's comments, I was unanimously satisfied. Finally, I chose Huayu Hotel, which deserves its name.
Although the hotel facilities are not as novel as new hotels, the hardware conditions are very online. It is particularly good that the swimming pool has many trees and shades, so it is not easy to be exposed to the sun. It is also convenient to eat, next to Huayu's own Baihuagu commercial center, breakfast also has hot and cold dishes and drinks, and the price is good. It takes about six or seven minutes to walk from the beach. Register the hotel room number and there are beach loungers, which is very convenient.
Especially commendable is the hotel's soft service is particularly good. The customer service staff are professional and friendly. Our family of three stayed with children and helped us upgrade the parent-child room for free. The children were very happy and gave a fruit plate. Special thanks to Wang Xin from the front desk customer service depar**ent, the hotel feels like a monk.

msg:The first impression of the hotel was not very good. Because of the high occupancy rate, there was a queue to check in. Fortunately, we met the beautiful Xiao Zhu at the front desk, which changed our view of the hotel. From arranging room check-in to receiving the QR code of the free product in the room, everything went very smoothly. Xiao Zhu took the initiative to let me add her WeChat account. If I have any questions, I can consult her. WeChat replies are also very fast and helped us solve many problems. We first booked two rooms for three nights on Ctrip, and then asked Xiao Zhu for help to extend our stay for three nights. Because there is the Baihuagu commercial area at the door and not far from the beach, it is very convenient to eat, drink and have fun. The most important thing is that the room price is cheap, so we finally extended our stay for 5 nights. We stayed at the Huayu Hotel for 11 days of our 19-day trip to Sanya. . The pool room assigned to us was a suite, which was very large and had two square private pools. The hotel has been open for some years, and the facilities in the room are a bit outdated, but the price/performance ratio is still very high. There is a vending machine at the elevator entrance, and the prices of drinks are very reasonable, cheaper than in stores outside. It is a hotel with good value for money, location and convenience in the Yalong Bay area.

It must have fallen somewhere, and there is no way to find it in person. The price of a pair of glasses is equal to the room rate for 3 nights, which is depressing.

msg:It's extremely bad. The facilities are old and the service attitude is poor. It's all trivial matters. I stayed here for 10 days and 9 nights in total. I experienced being kicked out by the waiter and having the power cut off and tripped. The desolation of Building 3 and the child's broken hands. Headache and bleeding. It also allowed me to see the hotel's attitude towards handling the situation. That is, it has nothing to do with the hotel. Pool video covered. However, I was unable to take a clear picture of who hit my child on the head, which resulted in my original ticket being refunded on the 22nd. The matter was not resolved and I could not go back. Need to stay at this hotel again. Finally, I want to negotiate with the other parent. Others know that the video was not captured clearly. Ask me directly, what evidence do you have to prove that we smashed it. You bring the evidence. That's right. The hotel video was not clear. I really have no evidence, so I can only suffer the loss of being dumb. It was as if my child had broken his head on his own and was playing with a basketball as a volleyball in the water. Throwing it back and forth in the sky is so dangerous. What you hit now is my child, who is 8 years old and only broke his head. What if it was a younger child? How hard is a basketball? ? The consequences could be disastrous. Why didn't the hotel stop it? Why can basketball be played as volleyball? As a family resort hotel, shouldn‚Äôt it allow customers to play with peace of mind? ? There are great safety risks. Friends who want to stay must always take care of their children. The hotel said they were having fun. Hit the head. It has nothing to do with the hotel. We are not asking him to smash the child's head if you fall to death on the road. Do you want to go to the government? The hotel can say such things and handle it with such attitude. Whatever is responsible. Still humane, this hotel is also a leader in the tourism industry. Don‚Äôt you have children? Don‚Äôt you have any willfulness? As a consumer. Money was spent. I still have to suffer from you. Not even a word of comfort or apology. These comments are all facts and I hope you will consider them carefully.

This time I chose Yalong Bay, which can go to the sea and has beautiful beaches. Recently, the prices of air tickets and hotels in the summer peak season have risen. After careful consideration, it is very A wise choice of Yalong Bay Huayu Hotel! First of all, the hotel is located in Baihuagu, with convenient catering and transportation. There is a supermarket next to it. It is very convenient to enter and leave the hotel with different exits. Moreover, it is only a few more steps to go to the beach than a first-line 5-star hotel, and the price is only 1/3. Isn't it delicious to eat seafood dinner every day? (By the way, there is a seafood restaurant diagonally opposite the hotel, and Dianping has group purchases, all of which are fresh ingredients.) It is not far from the hotel to take a taxi to the nucleic acid point! No one has this value for money! Children and husband are satisfied! I will definitely introduce it to my friends when I go back! Finally, I would like to thank the customer service lady, who took the initiative to contact me for a delayed check-out, and gave enough time to make the trip very calm and comfortable on the last day! so sweet

msg:Because of the unblocking and the winter vacation, there are many families with children on the plane, and almost all of them in the hotel are with children. The location of Huayu is good, Chinese style, and the Valley of Flowers is just outside the lobby, so maybe the business of the hotel restaurant will be affected? I arrived quite late. Fortunately, the front desk upgraded me to a family two-bedroom suite, more than 100 square meters, with two balconies. It is very spacious for a family of four. The equipment in the room is a bit old, and several TV channels are snowflakes. The villa may be newer, but it will be far away from the children's amu*****t park and children's swimming pool, so I didn't try it. The children's playground on the second floor of the lobby is very fun, and there are activities arranged. Although parents must be accompanied, at least it can be a little easier. It would be even better if there is a child care like Clubmed.
     The temperature is a bit low these days, and the constant temperature swimming pool only dares children to enter the water. I gave up after touching it. Overall it's good, although it's a bit far from the beach, but it's not too far, and it has its own beach chairs and blankets. I come to Sanya every year, and next time I come, Huayu will be the first choice.

msg:Huayu is probably the king of price/performance in Yalong Bay! I also consulted a lot of reviews before booking, and the reviews were mixed. I booked for two nights with the attitude of trying it out. After staying, it was really good! The exterior style and the room are all Chinese-style, which is very grand. The details of the facilities in the room are very clean. Although some facilities are a bit old, it does not affect the overall stay experience. The waiters are very enthusiastic. The room on the first floor is a bit wet in the rainy summer in Sanya. I told the front desk that I wanted to change the room, but because I was outside for two consecutive days, I couldn't go back in time to change the room. Miss mmmiko helped me keep the room for two consecutive days. Easy to go back and exchange. The service is really nice~ The hotel has a beautiful landscape, as if you are in a garden. The hotel has its own Baihuagu commercial street, you can have everything you want, and there are many must-eat restaurants. Every meal is solved here, saving a lot of time. If you want to go to the beach and cross the road from the hotel restaurant, there is a public access to the sea, and the surrounding is very lively! Finally, I hope the hotel can update the old facilities, the parking lot is bigger, and install the charging pile to become Yalong Bay yydsü´∞üèªü§òüèª

msg:I just transferred from Haitang Bay Tianfang Intercontinental Hotel. Tianfang is worth every penny, and it feels great. The Huayu Hotel is the hotel with the worst experience in Sanya, staying for two nights, more than 1000/night. The room is very old, the faucet and hair dryer are all broken. The bedding is not clean, and the balcony smells like urine. The breakfast is very poor, it feels like a bunch of people are looting. The only convenience is that the commercial street is just outside the lobby, and the commercial street can lead directly to the beach. It's convenient to eat, and the hotel is so poor that it can't even be called a four-star hotel.

msg:Stayed in Huayu for three nights, the first day was a two-bedroom family suite, which was very large, enough for two more people. The parent-child room I stayed in for the next two days had a bunk bed and a small tent, which the children liked very much. It is more convenient to go to the beach and more convenient to eat. On the third day of our stay, the child's face was injured due to a boat accident. In the evening, the hotel's DM lady came to ask, gave us a fruit plate, and helped us arrange a late check-out. I would also like to praise the hotel service staff on the beach for returning some inconvenient belongings to the hotel when we hurriedly took the children to the hospital. On the last day, because the children could not touch the water, they spent most of the day in the indoor children's playground, and also participated in the activities of the cosmic camp. The overall experience is still very good, the staff is also very humane, the room facilities are still outdated, but the cost performance is already very high, and I will consider Huayu next time I go to Yalong Bay.

Genius to enjoy shopping discounts. The management of beach chairs is chaotic. Guests who are not hotel guests can also take beach chairs.

msg:Originally booked for 3 nights, but encountered a typhoon and stayed for another night. A few days ago, there were few people, and the service response was very timely, but it was slower when there were more people, which is understandable. The only thing that bothers me is the room card. The room card is a plug-in room card. The way of inserting the card is also exquisite. I was locked out several times. Fortunately, the customer service solved it in time. But this room card is really inconvenient. Sanitation is basically done once a day, which is good. The key garden is beautiful. The swimming pool feels that there are some fallen leaves, and there is still a gap compared with the MGM in the back, but the price is also there. The air conditioner is good, and it is very quiet at night because it is not facing the street. The best thing is the convenience. It's close to the beach, just a few minutes' walk, and then Baihuagu is very convenient to eat and shop. I have personally stayed in the second phase of Tianyu, and I feel that the room facilities are similar to the old and new. Tianyu has more parent-child activities and has a tree-shaded swimming pool, which is friendly to babies. Others, the feeling is not much different, the service is similar. In all respects, Huayu is very cost-effective.

I changed to a room with the same type, but it still smelled musty. There were cigarette butts in the pool, and there was a piece of dried bread by the pool. Asking the hotel to change rooms, a female lobby manager surnamed Zhang said indifferently that there is no room, or you should check out! Is this a problem-solving attitude? Still a five-star standard? Contact Ctrip, the customer service is very responsible, and coordinate to check in the little yellow duck parent-child room.
The hotel was opened 18 years ago, and the waiter said that Ctrip's video and photos were all from that time. This is really a "photo deception"! The only gratification is Ctrip's coordination and timely cleaning of the rooms. There is nothing else worth recommending. When I left the store to pick up the luggage, I ran into a female manager surnamed Zhang again. When I told her that I needed to pick up the luggage, I didn't even raise my head or say a word. Immediately rang the bell, and the staff of the concierge came. Just for her service, I will never stay again!

This time, because the plane arrived late, and I knew that the hotel's breakfast was relatively average, I booked the most basic room, only 255. It even helped to upgrade, surprise!
The room was clean, spacious and comfortable as always. Our family of three didn't even want to change the hotel the next day [laughing] [laughing]
Because it is right next to Baihuagu Commercial Street, eating is not a problem at all, it is as convenient as possible, and it is extremely convenient to order takeout. Because the hotel is relatively large, there are also several swimming pools, which are comfortable no matter how you play, and the garden-style landscape is especially featured.

The first person to stay is the pool room, which is connected to the large outdoor swimming pool, and you can even swim to the street from the room. The landscape arrangement in the courtyard is very beautiful, the plants and landscape are layered, and even if the sun is noon, the swimming pool and corridor of the hotel will have gentle and silent shade.
It is also a good experience to enjoy floating afternoon tea in our own water area, thanks to the careful preparation of the restaurant staff.
The next day, I stayed in the parent-child room. The room is very large, reasonably furnished and warm. Everything in the room, such as tents, bunk beds, and small dolls, is loved by children.
There are many entertainment facilities in the hotel, including playgrounds, various children's activities led by teachers, multiple swimming pools with different characteristics, game consoles and all kinds of artifact to coax babies that can be imagined.
The hotel is surrounded by Baihuagu commercial street, and you can switch between tropical rain forests and lively cities at any time, which is a very fresh and happy experience.
The hotel service staff also presented fruits, cakes, milk and other meals in the room, which gave us more surprises.

Thank you very much for the arrangement of the hotel, which made us feel the sunshine and joy of Sanya.

The hotel has put a lot of effort into the service, service staff can be seen everywhere, and every waiter is very kind, especially Xiao Wu, who is seen on the beach every day, has meticulous and thoughtful service, and maintains the order of using beach chairs and responding to the needs of guests; The service staff of the constant temperature swimming pool are also very responsible. They keep an eye on the swimming pool at all times, reminding the children not to dive, because the water is very cold, and they specially give warm towels that have just been coaxed; the hotel doorman also helps to pick up the luggage in time.
In short, Huayu is a hotel that I will choose again next time I bring a baby alone.

It's very convenient to eat and go shopping! It is very close to the seaside, and it is there through the tree-lined path next to the Tianyu Hotel. If there is still a chance to go to Sanya in the future, Huayu is the first choice! Just to remind our recent travel partners that there is only one free nucleic acid testing point near the hotel, and the results will take 24 hours to come out. Because we did not expect it to take so long, in order not to affect the boarding, we had to go to a farther hospital for nucleic acid testing at our own expense. , everyone pay attention to set aside time.

I asked the hotel how to deal with it, and the hotel said that the room rate was 50% off, which is to pay me more than 100 yuan! In fact, it's not the room rate that's bad, but that the hotel didn't give a reasonable explanation and handling method at all! And the hotel manager Zhang Shuai had a very tough attitude when he came to check the room, and he didn't have the attitude to solve the problem at all! I travel all the year round, work, and live in a star-rated hotel or a small express hotel.

üçÉEnvironment: Although the hotel is a Chinese-style building, you can feel the strong Southeast Asian style when you walk in. The green plant environment is very good, and the whole is very comfortable. Don't worry, you can buy it in the store in the hotel.

üîîService: Hotel serviceüíØ, from the reception in the lobby to the daily cleaning, I am very satisfied, and I also gave you drinks and fruits, my parents are full of praise for the hotel

The room environment can see pictures and videos. There are very few parent-child rooms in hotels. The children's bed can be so big. The older children are very satisfied. My favorite is the balcony. The family can sit and make tea and chat, which is very comfortable~ The hotel has a good breakfast. On the last day, I was upgraded to the hotel next door, and I had breakfast while watching the underwater world. There are too many, the ingredients are not fresh, but after all, it is delivered, I still have to thank the hotel üò¨

Overall satisfied, will come again next time~

The lights of the square at night are beautiful. There is a large swimming pool downstairs, and the warm water pool is downstairs on the 3rd floor. There are many children, but the temperature is suitable, the pool is not small, and it is enough for daily exercise. The actual measurement of breakfast is ok, with a little change every day, bread and pasta, fried eggs and bacon, enough for a small appetite. Overall it's still a good value for money. The only downside is that there is only one bathroom in the double bedroom, which is a little inconvenient. The service of the staff is also very good. Thanks to Wang Xin, the guest depar**ent, for helping us to check out late because of our late flight.

2. Hidden benefits: I finally know why everyone is returning to stay (because the hotel hardware is really average) because the hotel is very close to Tianyu and the sea, so you can play.

I booked a pool room, and the price was more than 800 per night. I had high expectations, but when I entered the room, it was just a small square swimming pool, and it was not on the same side of the building as the big swimming pool, so the children didn't want to go into the water. Because the swimming pool rooms are all on the first floor, although the pillows and quilts in the rooms look clean, they all have a very pungent musty smell. After asking the waiter to replace them all, I think it can be tolerated. I tried my best to prevent mosquitoes from coming in during the day, but after turning off the lights at night, I still felt that there were several mosquitoes buzzing around all night. Including two breakfasts, if you bring a child over 1.2 meters, you will be charged the full price. There are very few types of breakfast, and in the raw cucumber salad that the child took, I saw a long, twisting red worm. . . The child looked at his plate petrified and couldn't speak. . . It happened that Sanya‚Äôs global static management happened to happen. After breakfast, the whole family packed their luggage and checked out immediately, and changed to another hotel.

msg:The commercial street next to the hotel is very lively. At first I thought it would be very noisy, so I insisted on the original reservation and went to the villa area to live there. You need to take the shuttle bus. It will be there in one minute. It is not very far away. , The night is good! But I was worried about mosquitoes and the inconvenience, so I switched back to the floor, close to the pool, and the environment is good. The buildings are a bit old and not so comfortable. The decoration is still ok. I applied for it with the front desk and delivered fruits. Not bad! The breakfast is quite plentiful, there are all kinds of them, and there are plenty of ready-mades, which is not bad, but overall it is not bad! It is recommended to issue tickets in advance, as special tickets will be slower!

Every time I go in and out of the room, I have to call the waiter to open the door. The weather is very hot Every time I have to wait for a long time before someone comes, I don't know what's the point of giving us the room card? The room was dirty and called for cleaning. No one came for a long time. The takeaway garbage was put at the door, and no one cleaned it the next day!
  In short, this hotel will not come again for the second time, not even the three-star service, it is extremely bad.

msg:This time I came to Yalong Bay for the first stop to stay at Bohou Village Wujie Meiju. The child was pleasantly surprised when he saw the swimming pool at first sight and thought it was very beautiful. After staying for two days, only the swimming pool was the selling point. After playing for a long time, it would be boring. . And the breakfast is too bad. I went to Alang Seafood for lunch. After 10 minutes of eating, I started to vomit. The seafood taken out on Meituan was salty, oily and expensive. Only go to the night market to eat food stalls. My personal impression is that Bohou Village is suitable for people who want to take pictures by the pool to stay in the circle of friends for one night, no more is necessary. Stayed in the Bird's Nest for one night, it is convenient and fun to go to the Forest Park, and the service is also very good. In the end, I stayed in Yalong Bay and stayed at Huayu Resort Hotel for five nights. I just planned to stay here next time I come to Yalong Bay, and I won't go anywhere else. This hotel has a large park and many green plants. The rooms in the townhouse we stayed in were clean and tidy, with many swimming pools and good service. The lifeguards at the pool are very serious. Thank you for the lifeguard named Ma Fengyan, who helped me today Help my little ones sterilize the bag for small wounds. The guys who serve the beach are also very serious. It can be seen that the management and training of the hotel are in place. The hotel is three to five minutes away from the beach, and it is really convenient to go out to the Valley of Flowers! No matter the size of the environment or all aspects of service, Bohou Village's online celebrity shop is incomparable. It is very good to stay here if it is a family vacation or a vacation with children.

The waiter sees that we like to drink water, so he puts a few more bottles of drinking water every day, and when there are children, he puts the children's toiletries. Waiting for the elevator to go upstairs and seeing us carrying a lot of things, we will take the initiative to help. The hotel has a swimming pool (shooting in the water), a gym, and a kid's club, etc., so that children can have fun and parents can feel at ease. If you are tired from playing, the hotel has a buffet, etc. You can solve the problem of eating on the spot without changing clothes. It is very suitable for families with children. The hotel is very close to Baihua Valley. There are many places to eat and play in Baihua Valley. Every meal we eat is different. It is also close to the beach.

msg:This is the first time I have come to Sanya to bring children with my friends. To be honest, it's hard to complain. I want to write a review. First of all: the hotel is indeed old and poor, but the elderly brought children. Place, second, we booked a pool room for 4 nights, and the stay was all musty. At that time, we downgraded and replaced the 6th-floor big bed room facing the street to let us temporarily stay for one night, and then the waiter asked that we need to confirm or clarify at that time. If you change the pool room late, you can change the room directly for four nights. Later, because the bar downstairs is too noisy, I hope the front desk will change the room. I called us at about 2:00 noon on the third day and said that we can change to the same room type in Building No. 3. At that time, we With children outside, the hotel can only stay until three o'clock and then give up, and there is no refund and reimbursement of the room price. There are none, no children's products, and the hotel will send them by phone, but they repeatedly told me to look in the cabinet, and I also reminded ‚è∞ I have searched several times. Fourth, when I go to the bathroom, the toilet lid is just one touch. Immediately, I would like to ask if the waiter did not give feedback when cleaning. In short, look at the floor and the details of the facilities. It is definitely not as good as finding a famous hotel in Sanya. The conditions are many times better than Huayu. Finally, I will emphasize the room 1329 where our friends live. It is recommended not to stay in this type of apar**ent. In order to make themselves no longer depressed this Spring Festival, the two families resolutely changed their flight tickets, delayed their return home, and rebooked a brand hotel for four days to complete the Chinese New Year in Sanya in 2022. I also hope that Huayu Hotel can consider the guests' new experience needs

msg:To sum up in one sentence: a hotel with high cost performance without price increases is worth choosing.
The hotel is an old 5* or 4* hotel, and the hardware facilities are indeed a bit bad. At most, it is the standard of 3* or high-end hotels in county-level cities. After all, it has been an old hotel for many years.
The location of the hotel is very good. It is adjacent to Baihua Valley in Yalong Bay. It is very convenient to eat, shop and play. The hotel does not rely on the seaside beach, and there are many garden-style landscape designs, water features and swimming pools. To get to the beach, you need to cross a road, enter from the public beach access, and walk for only 10 minutes.
Service: The hotel staff are very polite and enthusiastic.
Environment: Garden landscape, birds and flowers are fragrant in the morning, there are multiple swimming pools, children like it very much, and the security guard is also very responsible.

The hardware is really bad, the bathroom is very long, the toilet is smelly, the very picky daughter doesn‚Äôt like to go to the smelly, 2. The front desk service is very general, slow, and the attitude is not good Well, in order to renew a room card, I ran back and forth several times. 3. The swimming pool is not bad, but the surrounding sanitation is average. The bath towels provided are very old, and I really don't want to use them. There are good ones too. 1. It must be said that the big sisters who clean up are very kind. They respond to every request and are responsible for their work. They provide water several times a day, and even stack swans with towels for the children. The two sisters surnamed Dong also wrote cards. Wish us Have a great trip, really, this is the best review for this hotel. If all the employees have such an attitude, the hardware defects can really be ignored, however, I ran into these two people. 2. The children's playground is good, you can save snacks with your baby, and the indoor and outdoor activities are arranged alternately. 3. Finally, the cost performance is high and it is cheap. But in the end, I have to say that the epidemic has been in the past for several years, and it is rare to come out. If the budget allows, it is still better to choose a hotel among the five stars in Haitang Bay. After all, it is really worth every penny. We regretted staying in Yalong Bay for too long in the end.

There are three areas in the park, and each area has its own swimming pool. The weather we went to was not very warm, and the sea could not go underwater. The heated swimming pool in the children's area became the best place for everyone to play in the water. I visited Huayu ten years ago and was shocked by the Chinese-style lobby and conference center layout. Ten years later, I feel that the hotel is much more friendly to the people, both in terms of price and service. Xiao Lu at the front desk was very helpful in helping us contact the room, and considering taking the child to upgrade the villa suite to a parent-child room, thank you very much!

What's more annoying is that the room is relatively old and the musty smell is relatively strong, we still live with the children. The bathroom was also smelly and was sprayed with thick toilet water. The highest room is on the 6th floor, so the noise is relatively loud, and the pool below is quite noisy. I only slept for three hours at night, and the most powerless thing to complain about is the hot pot in the set menu, which is not even as good as Mala Tang.

You have to queue for breakfast, and there are not many meat dishes. As a seaside hotel, you can't even see prawns or fish. The restaurant is here. Sorry for the hotel at this price, I feel that it is still a problem of carrying capacity caused by too many people.

msg:This is the first time I came to Yalong Bay to stay in a hotel. I used to live in Haitang Bay. This time I chose several. I chose this one because it looks more Chinese and I want to experience different hotel styles. Because there is no double bed for No. 1, I booked a double bed. The location of the hotel is very easy to find, and the road turning into the hotel is also very beautiful. This is Building One that I stayed in today. Downstairs is the commercial street, very convenient for eating, various restaurants. Going out behind the hotel lobby is the commercial street. Going out across the road is the seaside. Three to five minutes to the beach. I casually took a few pictures of the hotel's scenery. The service staff are very good, I came here on holiday by myself, and the welcome service and room service are all in place. The hotel has a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop. There are restaurants. It's all a star-rated hotel in Yalong Bay with super cost-effective. The swimming pool is very clean, but it has been slightly cool in the past two days. I haven't got into the water either, but I saw children and men getting into the water. You can refer to it. In short, it is recommended.

msg:The first time I gave a bad review, I really couldn't bear it. Self-criticism first, he booked because of his cheap price. It's really what you pay for what you pay for. The key is whether the service is not good or the facilities are not good. I can accept these. After all, the price is there. The unbearable point is the decoration style of this hotel, is it a weird style? Picture one is the restaurant. Are these cloths made by the law? There are so many hangings. Picture two is the bed for sleeping, four are not close, one bed is in the center. Behind the bed is a row of mirrors, on the right is a large mirror, on the left is a very strange painting, a very ancient dress, there is a woman's head under the dress! I'm going to collapse, turn over in the mirror and look at myself at night? Turning over again is a glass painting with reflected light, and it seems looming that someone is standing there, but there is no head! I want to go to the toilet, a row of mirrors, I don't want to say how I got through these two nights, I really dare not sleep and I can't sleep. Yesterday, I tripped twice and suddenly the light near the door turned on. That's right, it turned on suddenly. I don't know how to set it up, but the light is on when it trips. I was scared at first, but when I came here, I was really speechless. Look at the floor of the bathroom for yourself, does it look like blood stains, don't blame me, I was really scared these two nights. Look at the others for yourself, unable to spit out, and don't know how his praise is up. It scares me to death. I am anonymous because I am afraid that the hotel will trouble me. Is it because the other reviews are brushed, I am a conscience review.

A mask is less than a dollar, and it's screeching (when I checked in on the first day, there was no mask, and the male front desk gave it to me). I checked out today, and I have to leave. That's the attitude. It's really disgusting. Female receptionist at 8:40am on June 28th, ü§Æ
üßπHygiene: The room is too damp, short-sleeved shorts and underwear will not dry for three days, the washbasin is blocked by the hair of the front guests, the water is slow, and the toilet toilet stinks.

No wonder the hotel is so cheap. Just get some formalism. If you really want to make the guests feel comfortable, think about what you can do. You don't need to send two doormen to open and close the doors.

You said that if there is a better location, why didn't you open it to me at the beginning? I was in a bad mood.

msg:Ten years ago, the hotel should be one of the best resort hotels in Yalong Bay. Why do you say that, and evaluate:

üöó Transportation: There is no need to say the location, although it is not close to the seaside, you can walk to the seaside within 10 minutes without having to (walk through the commercial street, one road is the Yalong Bay Beach Plaza)

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel is very large, composed of rooms and villas in several buildings, and has a high landscaping rate. There is a swimming pool in front of the parent-child room (there is a small heated pool), and there are two at the back! It is maintained by staff.

üîîService: We arrived at 4 in the morning, and the little brother from the concierge helped with the luggage and led the way to stop the car. The reception was also very enthusiastic. During the epidemic, he was skilled in business and quickly helped with the check-in procedures so that we could rest early. The bellboy helped take to the room.

üßπHygienic: Because of the bath and the leakage of the sink, the bathroom floor and room floor are more water-stained, and the guest room can be cleaned every day. I am very satisfied.

Add some advantages: Behind the hotel is the commercial street of the hotel group, you can eat, drink and shop on foot. There is a hotel lounge chair service area on the beach by the sea. You can find the staff to bring cushions and lying towels. The hotel has a children‚Äôs playground. A place to walk the baby, just the next day when the typhoon rained, I left the child in it for a long time (the children‚Äôs playground still has activities every day, the key is free), the breakfast is also quite rich, and there are many choices.

Finally, let me talk about the shortcomings: the hotel has been too long, and some facilities have begun to be damaged. The 3526 room I lived in had a leak in the sink, the hair dryer was not working smoothly, and there were too many people at breakfast, which seemed a bit chaotic.
The exterior of the hotel is decorated in Chinese style, so it will give people a shabby feeling. Hope it can be refurbished.

Summary: The price of a five-star hotel with three stars is really cost-effective. Of course, the premise is that if you are not so concerned about some of the room facilities and the appearance of the hotel, I recommend this Huayu Hotel with 5 stars.

I live in a hotel, and I am more concerned about the attitude and sense of service of the staff as to the level of the hotel. Huayu Hotel has a lot of staff, and everyone is polite. I think it can offset the lack of old facilities.

The last one, looking out from the balcony of the room, I really like it! Next summer, come to Yalong Bay and stay here.

msg:A very good accommodation experience. After 8 years, I came to Yalong Bay to stay at the seaside again. For 8 years, I stayed at Tianyu Hotel. This time I booked the opposite Huayu Resort Hotel. The hotel is very large and the decoration style is a bit Chinese garden style. It feels like, the young lady who likes Hanfu can bring clothes and take photos. It‚Äôs very photogenic. The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool is very large and there are swimming pools on both sides. I live in Building 1. The swimming pool is for adults and children on the other side. Pools, hot spring pools, small beaches for children, and large slides. In short, it is a hotel that is very suitable for parent-child travel. The baby in the hotel‚Äôs parent-child room yells as soon as he enters the door. It is required to sleep in a small tent every day. Haha. The room is also very good. Big, downstairs of the hotel is Baihua Valley. Don‚Äôt be too convenient to eat. Baihua Valley goes out across a small road to the seaside plaza. Haidilao, DQ, Ajisen Ramen üçúCoconut Chicken has everything, it‚Äôs really a complete set of eating, drinking and having fun, haha, The hotel experience is superb, but the hotel is an old 5-star hotel, and the decoration is a bit outdated (please take a detour if you mind) but the price is right, the staff is also very attentive, especially the little brother Xiaofu here must be particularly grateful , I went back to the hotel at night, and the baby fell asleep. Thanks to my brother Xiaofu‚Äôs patience to help us find a wheelchair, he helped send the sleeping baby back to the hotel safely üòÇ Because of the late flight, I delayed the check-out time, very Caring serviceüåπ will come again next time, ‚ù§Ô∏è

The beautiful environment, like being in a garden, attracts many photographers. The service is enthusiastic, problems can be solved immediately, and cleaning is also timely. Children have a small bubble pool that is constant temperature. It would be great if the swimming pool is also constant temperature. It is a pity that the swimsuits you bring are useless, and the water in the pool is cold and I dare not enter the water. I especially like the outer space children‚Äôs school camp in the children‚Äôs paradise. There are different activities every day for a few days. The children have to report every day. The two teachers, Wenwen and Juanjuan, are very nice and take the children to do things patiently.

I really didn't eat anything after eating for 2 days. I decided that I didn't have breakfast for the next few days. I read many reviews and I was not very satisfied with the breakfast. I hope it can improve the food and drink, that would be even better. Overall satisfaction.

msg:A very, very enjoyable trip. The baby was 1 and a half years old for the first time. He was worried about all kinds of things before. The result was very pleasant. To a large extent, the hotel is very suitable for vacation. The price, environment, management, personnel, all aspects are very good. intimate. During the one-week stay, the butler‚Äôs WeChat guidance was provided throughout the stay, which was clear and clear. Auntie sees that we take the baby to make milk powder, and put a lot of water in the room every day. Sometimes we keep the room very clean and don‚Äôt need to be cleaned. Auntie will insist on cleaning. We will also take the initiative to change the sheets, saying that this is what she should do. The literacy is very high and I am very touched. The room is very big. Our three and one small children don't feel crowded at all. The baby is pushing his car in the room every day. Lying on the balcony at night listening to the wind, the breeze is breezy, very affectionate. There are several large swimming pools in the hotel, and the babies run around every day by stepping on the water and feeding the fish. They are very happy. Later, because it was a return flight at 9 pm, the hotel thoughtfully delayed the check-out until 4 pm, and said that it would be okay if I wanted to be late. I was very moved. The hot pot delivered by the hotel also tastes very good. At that time, I was entangled between Tianyu and Huayu. At that time, I thought that the hotel where the baby was still small could go directly to the beach, but I later found out that I was thinking too much. First of all, the two hotels are similar in location, just across the road. Secondly, the private beach is also a public beach, you can play it at will, but the hotel will have a rest area, and Huayu also has it, but the price of Huayu is much more favorable than that of Tianyu, especially the price difference of family room is very outrageous. It proves that choosing Huayu is definitely a wise choice, and the price-performance ratio is very high. Yalong Bay Beach is really good, the sand is fine and the sea is clear, so it's perfect for babies to tread on the water. The baby is very happy this time and will come next year. Huayu will still be his first choice!

Within a few days of check-in, I will receive the manager‚Äôs every day. Greetings and inquiries were all satisfied, which made our honeymoon trip more joyful.
      I regret that I don‚Äôt know the real name of this lady. I only know that her online name is Cuckoo Pig. I hope that the hotel‚Äôs reply message will inform this meticulous service lobby manager Fang name. I sincerely thank her!
      I would also like to commend the management of this hotel. It is not just a good one, but I see that the other staff in this hotel are very enthusiastic in their services. When meeting guests in the corridor, they will put down their work and greet you with a smile. Seeing you have any hesitation, they will take the initiative to ask what can help you? I am very moved. I know this must be the request and wisdom of hotel managers. Let every guest staying at Huayu feel at home and leave a very good impression on Sanya City and Yalong Bay. Next time you come to visit, you will choose this resort hotel.
üçÉEnvironment: Huayu-worthy of a five-star resort hotel, the style of the hotel is an ancient house and a long pavilion, graceful into the forest, where you are like an emperor's palace. The hotel also has modern leisure facilities, swimming pools, gyms, and children's castles.
üßπHygienic: I walked in the hotel all day, and I saw a master cleaning the dead leaves on the lawn from the trees, picking up the fallen flowers in the pool, using a long rod to wipe the floating ash on the top of the promenade, and giving the pillars Waxing maintenance. These blind spots that are not easy to attract people's attention are carefully cleaned, which makes me admire.
      Not to mention the hygiene in the room. The aunt who cleans the room every day will change the bedding and wash the scarf in the house. Also spray sanitary ware with detergent. Before I leave, I will bow and bid farewell to see how Huayu's service and training are unconvincing.
üöó Transportation: In terms of transportation, Huayu is definitely the ceiling of the hotel in Yalong Bay, right next to the intersection of Yalong Bay Central Square, and Baihua Valley Food and Drink Shopping Center at the foot, a 5-minute walk from the sea. The hotel in Yalong Bay, a golden place, turned out to have free parking (I also drove to other hotels in Yalong Bay and charged them), which surprised me, so happy, hahahahaha.
       In summary, this is the most considerate hotel I have stayed in during my 20-day honeymoon trip, and I will choose a hotel whenever I come to Yalong Bay, Sanya in the future.

The only bright spot is that when you check in, there will be a staff member who will send you to the door, and sometimes they will be sent to the room, add WeChat, and then promote it. It feels like the kind of public hotel of Spring Airlines.

The hotel environment is also good, two of the three swimming pools are open, and the other is currently under maintenance in the off-season. Parent-child activities are also arranged during the National Day holiday.
Because our flight time is relatively early, and it is not convenient to get up early with the elderly and children, so we negotiated with the hotel to refund the room for the last night, the hotel was very considerate to help deal with it, and also helped to delay the check-out until 14 o'clock, which is really a point. Like it.
Huayu is really cost-effective, and the service has exceeded our expectations. I will choose here next time I have the opportunity

msg:This hotel has been in business for a long time, but it has been well maintained. When it first opened, it was managed by the Crowne Plaza brand under InterContinental, but later the contract expired and was changed to self-management. The design, facilities and products are all excellent, the surrounding natural environment is beautiful, and leisure shopping is very convenient.

üîîService: Generally speaking, the service is good. There are a few places where you can do better. 1) The guest room aunt didn't know that I had renewed the stay. When I didn't have time to respond, she opened the door and entered the room, and then asked if I needed to clean it. Explain that the process is lacking, and the communication with the front desk is insufficient or not timely. 2) When I renewed my stay, I stated in the Ctrip order that I would need to check out until 3 o'clock. When renewing the stay at the front desk, the little girl at the front desk said that you should give a five-star praise to your check-in last night before you can delay it to 3 o'clock. It may be a requirement of the hotel to strive for praise in this way, but the practice is too much and it will reduce the guest experience. 3) There are welcome fruits written on Ctrip. I haven't received it for three nights. But it was a pleasant surprise to receive a mousse cake the next night. The cake is pretty, but it's a bit big, and the cream is a bit too much, so I can't finish it. Thank you Xiao Lu, the attentive guest relations manager.
üßπSanitation: Generally speaking, if the standard is up to the standard, the room may be too large, the cleaning task of the aunt is heavy, and there is room for improvement in some details. Continued cleaning is slightly casual. The swimming pool looks very clean.
üçÉEnvironment: First-class environment. Courtyard design, the floor is not high, and the balcony is large. Eaves dense bamboo, small bridges and flowing water, winding paths lead secluded. The hotel has good facilities. There is a children‚Äôs play area on the third floor where the lobby is located, and there is a place in the garden where children can dig sand. There are two very big swimming pools. However, there are no lockers by the swimming pool and no waterproof bag for mobile phones, which is a bit inconvenient.
üöó Transportation: The transportation is very convenient. It is very convenient whether it is self-driving or taking a ride.

I chose Huayu because the price-performance ratio of this hotel in Yalong Bay is too high, and the service is also in place. This time I still chose the pool room package. At the beginning, I stayed in a room with a private pool. Because the pool was too small, it was requested to change the room next to the public pool. The hotel quickly replaced the room. The feeling of being able to swim anytime, anywhere is really great. Although it is close to the swimming pool, the dehumidifier is still good, and I even feel a little dry mouth after sleeping all night.
The open-air buffet dinner presented by the last set meal may have been criticized by customers. This time I replaced Caidiexuan‚Äôs buffet hot pot. The taste is quite satisfactory, but at least the hygiene is guaranteed ü•∞
There is no difference between breakfast and the last time I came. I am a bit tired after eating so many times. Next time I will consider booking a room without breakfast. I recommend Baoluo Lu Yi Noodles, I have a bowl every morning.
Finally, compliment the hotel service staff again! The clothes I left at the hotel were immediately sent back to me, praise!

At the beginning, I was worried about children‚Äôs sleeping problems, so I brought my own pillowcase and a small quilt cover. After check-in, it was found that it was completely redundant, and the bedding of the children's bed was like new, very clean and refreshing.
Traveling in the off-season, there are fewer tourists, and the breakfast category is similar to the peak season.
Whether it was the bellman, the front desk, or the room staff, I arrived at the hotel early with my baby and checked in after ten o'clock to upgrade the room type.

msg:On September 12 alone, more than 30 five-star reviews appeared in this hotel. Wouldn't Ctrip check it out? Let me tell you the true face of this hotel!
1. The hotel has only opened 2 buildings, and the other buildings are being renovated. The so-called renovation is just painting, and the whole yard is full of paint.
2. Breakfast has shrunk seriously. The whole restaurant only has a small plate of hot dishes in the photo, not even cold dishes.
3. Most of the parent-child rooms are connected rooms. You must worship Buddha before you come. I hope that the front desk will not arrange a noisy stay.
4. I hope that all the relatives who bought the small hot pot by the pool will come to defend their rights. The hotel will say that it will not open because it rains in Sanya, but it is two concepts that it is impossible to eat outdoors and the restaurant cannot be opened at all. Everyone must protect their rights!
5. When I saw people at the front desk, the managers (the surname Zhu I met) hid in the office and pretended to be bigwigs. They didn't deal with things, and they were all confused and fooled.
6. The children‚Äôs swimming pools in the three buildings of the hotel are not open. Only one and two are open. The depth is 1.2 meters. If you can‚Äôt find the waiter, you can get the swimming ring on the side of the pool. He came to let you pay the first time.
7. Don't stroll around in the hotel yard or building. Don't stop without writing. The concierge (the surname I met) will scold you loudly and follow you back to the room.
8. Don't post bad reviews, the hotel will flood you with hundreds of five-star reviews overnight. If you can think of a hotel that can do this kind of thing, you can imagine what else you can't do!
It is hoped that Ctrip can effectively guarantee the authenticity of hotel reviews, and conduct strict inspections on hotels with more than 30 five-star reviews in one day.

If you don't pursue high quality, you can consider this hotel. The overall facilities are quite contemporary. The room is actually quite big, but it is more uncomfortable that the toilet has no ventilation. The swimming pool is not big, but it is enough, and the children are happiest. The hotel does not have a private beach. You need to walk to the public beach on the opposite road. It takes about five minutes, which is also convenient. Many people commented that the breakfast was not enough. I think the price is really good, and there are enough categories. Whether it tastes good or not depends on the individual. When we arrived, it was delayed and it was already more than one o'clock in the morning at the hotel. The check-in at the front desk was too slow. The overall check-in experience is actually ok, and a hot pot was given when booking. At this price, I think it‚Äôs ok

        Located in the center of Baihua Valley, it‚Äôs super convenient for eating and drinking. It‚Äôs just across the road facing Tianyu, next to the public beach passage, and it takes only three minutes to walk from the hotel lobby to the sea. The third floor of the lobby is the naughty castle, so you need to bring socks for your children.
        When checking in, the little girl Lu Luyin at the front desk was super invincible, patient and meticulous, and thoughtful of all kinds of guests. She gave a lot of suggestions and left a particularly good impression on me.
        The room facilities are similar to Tianyu, with a long history and a more traditional design. What I care more about is that there seems to be a sneak shot camera, the spotlight on the bedside, only this spotlight emits a yellowish light after the light is turned off at night, because I am not sure, there is no alarm. Put it forward here and hope that the store will check it carefully!

msg:This is our second stay at Huayu. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and patient. There is an indoor swimming pool and a large children's playground. There are activities in the park every day, and reservations need to be made one day in advance. Children can spend a day in the children's playground, and breakfast is also very good. This time I went to coincide with the child‚Äôs birthday, and the hotel specially prepared a cake. It was a unique birthday. The hotel is located in the Baihuagu Commercial Center. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. It is also very close to the seaside beach. It takes only 5 minutes to walk across the road. Of course, if you don‚Äôt want to walk, the hotel also has a car to the beach. Since we were returning to Shanghai by an early flight, the hotel also helped to book a taxi to the airport in advance, and also helped to pack two breakfasts. I believe that I will definitely stay in Huayu again next time I come to Sanya.

msg:The beach in the hotel is very close and it is about 10 minutes walk away. Below is the commercial street. It is very convenient to eat and buy things. It is expensive. It is not recommended to buy things in the commercial street. We are 2 adults and a child who is nearly 2 years and 5 months old. It‚Äôs all complete but it‚Äôs relatively humid, but the room is equipped with a dehumidifier, but the sound is a bit loud for us. Our family sleeps very clearly, especially when the children sleep with a sound. Although it is a large pool bed linen, it is not a separate pool link to the public swimming pool. I personally think it is not Very private, of course not very clean, the waiters are very polite, in general, you can still take the baby out to play, if you don‚Äôt pay attention to the details, you can still drop breakfast.

msg:The environment is good, the service is also very good, the most important thing is that the price is too high! It's totally beyond my expectation! Passing through the Tianyu Hotel on the opposite side is the seaside. Get up in the morning and go to the beach for a walk. The private beach is very relaxing! The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool also had fun. I originally planned to stay for a day. I stayed there for a total of three days. It‚Äôs worth it!

msg:The experience of staying at Huayu Resort Hotel this time is very good. Let‚Äôs talk about the facilities first. Many hotels in Yalong Bay are old hotels. They are certainly not as good as newly renovated hotels, but after all, they are good old hotels and they are not much worse. The room facilities It's really old, but I don't think it will affect the stay. There are everything that should be there. Going to Sanya is originally a vacation, and the room is comfortable. My daughter and I like the hotel‚Äôs breakfast very much (there is a picture below, you can take a look), I also like the hotel‚Äôs external environment, it is antique, the swimming pool is also good, and I have played happily with my daughter for a long time (you can also play water volleyball) Oh). Another important point is the location. It‚Äôs Baihua Valley. It‚Äôs very convenient for eating and shopping. It‚Äôs very close to Paradise Forest Park and the Magic Show, and it‚Äôs also close to the sea. We spend a day on the sea, diving in the morning. I was a little tired. I took a battery car back to the hotel for a few minutes to rest. In the afternoon I went to the beach to play the rest of the project. The attitude of the hotel staff is very good and responsive. In short, the experience is great!

msg:The environment is super good, just a few minutes away from the beach, there is a battery car to pick up and drop off. The breakfast is good. The room is big and tidy. The atoll swimming pool has its own characteristics. What I feel most deeply is that the waiters, restaurant, guest room, and reception lobby are extremely diligent and polite. I can see that the hotel management is level. The waiters at the reception desk are all pretty girls.

msg:I went to Hainan for the first night. The hotel is not big, but the location is great! The main entrance is on Baihuagu Commercial Street. It is very convenient for eating, shopping and shopping. It is also close to the Cactus Hotel (the coconut chicken), and it‚Äôs only ten yuan by taxi. The hotel is Chinese style. The pool room that the beauty gave me a free upgrade, although it was too late to come back, I didn't go in for a swim, but it was in a good style! It is recommended to find a way to dehumidify the room! It's a bit stretched to stay in, arriving at night, the absolute first choice for transit. This price feels a two-hundred-percent price-performance ratio! After all, the location is good, there is a children's playground, swimming pool, and breakfast!
