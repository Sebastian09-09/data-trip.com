msg:Zhangjiajie Blue Bay Borg International Hotel is recommended for stay! 👍👍👍
This hotel was recommended to me by a friend. It has convenient transportation, is close to the airport and high-speed rail station, and is convenient for travel. 
The hotel design style is very grand, the lobby is low-key and luxurious yet simple, the room layout is beautiful and stylish, clean, sanitary and comfortable, with complete facilities, very fast Internet speed, and warm and thoughtful waiters.
It is really beautiful to look out from the window at Tianmen Mountain surrounded by clouds in the morning🌹. The buffet in the Chinese restaurant is rich in variety, the ingredients are fresh, the taste is very good, and it is great value!
This time I only saw Tianmen Mountain, and there is also the beautiful Wulingyuan Tianzi Mountain waiting for me. I will definitely stay at Blue Bay Borg Hotel next time! ❤

The lady at the front desk was very patient in explaining the precautions one by one, and was thoughtful in calling us early. The breakfast was delicious and had a wide variety. The authentic beef brisket whistle rice noodles were simply amazing. The most important thing is that the hotel is very close to the Seventy-two Wonders Towers, about 2 kilometers away by taxi, and the starting price is only 10 yuan. After a tiring day of traveling, I settled down and checked in at the Seventy-two Wonders Towers in the evening. It was really a good deal!

This hotel should be prepared for tour groups. They are all tour groups. Buses park in front of the hotel every day. There is a strong musty smell in the room. The carpets are old. The bathroom facilities are very old and the towels are old. Sorry, the breakfast in the hotel is not even as good as Home Inn. The breakfast room is also full of tour groups. Regular guests and tour groups eat the same breakfast, which is the level of the tour group meal. Moreover, the floor in the breakfast room is sticky to the feet.

msg:I booked it based on 5 diamonds, thinking it was a five-star level. When I arrived in the lobby, there was no familiar scent of aromatherapy, and it smelled like freshly pickled sauerkraut. When I entered the room, there were basically no facilities. The water for the shower was ice dew. At that time, I discovered that it was a two-in-one shower and shower... Isn't this the one used in hotels? The pillows were also uncomfortable. This time it was a surprise.

Breakfast is also rich, the only drawback is that all meals are canceled at 9:30
The hotel has parking lots in Buildings A, B, and C, but they are all connected. You can use the elevator to go directly to the front desk.
Next time I travel to Zhangjiajie, I will stay at this hotel again

I was woken up in the middle of the night and thought it was a thief who opened our door, so I didn't sleep well all night! Shampoo and shower gel are actually mixed. There is no conditioner and body lotion. There are no plastic slippers. The hair dryer is also very poor. You have to press it all the time to blow out the air. There is no sofa, only chairs. It is a configuration that is advertised as a five-star hotel. It’s so bad!

msg:The first feeling when I came to Zhangjiajie was that the people here are very warm and hospitable. It is not far from the airport, train station, and urban area. It was the first time I experienced the ropeway from the urban area to the mountain with an altitude of more than 1,500 meters. It was really shocking. I paid attention to Zhangjiajie Hotel on Ctrip and only booked a room for more than a month. It is a big thing to book a room when traveling. First of all, you can live comfortably before you can have a good mood. The first feeling when you arrive at the store is warmth, the hotel is warm, joyful, and charming. Xiangxi is really a performance worth seeing. The actors have profound skills and perform well. This trip to Zhangjiajie is perfect.

The surrounding restaurants are of good size and taste, and are economical and affordable. The key is the short distance. Especially the aunt in the guest room saw our clothes hanging in the bathroom and offered to help us. I didn't expect this and I want to say thank you very much! The gift from the front desk we really liked. All in all, the service concept here far exceeds expectations, and the service awareness comes from the heart. I will continue to choose this place next time in Zhangjiajie!

There are quite a lot of restaurants nearby. If you need to eat and walk for a few minutes, it is quite convenient. Hygiene: clean. Environment: The room is quiet and comfortable.

The windows are large, The lighting is bright, the bedding is very skin-friendly, and the free disposable products are of good quality. All the supplies are very comfortable to use. I feel that the hotel is a person who pursues quality. The key is that this price is too surprising, the price/performance ratio is great!

The single room I ordered from Ctrip was snapped up. The decoration and facilities were good, and it had everything you need. 2 I thought the breakfast would be simple, but I didn’t expect there were many varieties. I had to catch a train, so I got up early and went down at 6:40. I didn’t expect that breakfast had already been prepared. The chef inside was still very enthusiastic and allowed me to sit down and eat. Very attentive service! 3. Not far from the train station, it takes less than 10 minutes to get there by taxi.

The quality of the waiters is not good, they don’t even know what Type-C is, and the service attitude at the lobby reception is relatively cold. When I called the guest room at 11:30, I could clearly hear that I was sleepy. There are basically no lights in the hotel lobby and it is quite dark. Although the room is large enough, the overall spatial layout is quite inadequate, and it can even be said to have no design. The overall arrangement of the breakfast is also relatively random. Perhaps because there are so many Koreans here, the breakfast is not to my liking.

The most frustrating thing is the toothbrush, which is definitely harder than a shoe brush. There is no conditioner in the bathroom, and the slippers are too thin to wear to breakfast.
