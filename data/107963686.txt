msg:Basically, the products of Huajiantang must be boutique. The hotel is in a very good location. Behind it is Yumatou, the Grand Canal, and Hua Street. It is quiet in the bustling city. There are noisy gongs and drums outside, and the voices are bustling, but it is very quiet in the hotel, which is very suitable for vacation.
The facilities are very new, it is very comfortable to live in, the room is large enough, and the scenery is very good, not to mention the service, which can be ranked among the top domestic hotels. Basically, the front desk is responsive. I originally wanted to stay for one day, and then I extended it for another day because of the service.
The young lady is very enthusiastic and actively recommends delicious and fun things around, and pays great attention to various service details. For example, when my wife had a birthday, the young lady took photos for her, printed the photos and put them in a wooden frame to give to my wife. I give full marks for this wave of service.
The mineral water used is of the same grade as that of Qingdao St. Regis (Qingdao St. Regis is a top luxury hotel in our Shandong), and the various drinks in the small bar are the same as those used by Beijing Bulgari, and there are also various snacks, all free.
The only downside is that the parking lot is a bit far away. It is said to be 150 meters away, but it is conservatively estimated to be 300 to 400 meters. The breakfast is good, but the dinner ordered in the restaurant is indeed average.
This is basically the best (most expensive) hotel in Huai'an, so whether you are on a business trip or a vacation, you can't go wrong here.

There is also probably the best coffee in Huai'an☕️. The evening desserts are different twice but they are delicious. The most rare thing is the consistency of service. In short, I will come again.

msg:It's so nice!! Seeing that there were no negative reviews and a perfect score, I booked Huaian Huajiantang, which was full of surprises. The housekeeper contacted me one day in advance, and I felt the enthusiasm of the hotel from the moment I entered the door. The service was particularly good, considerate, attentive and warm. The cold brew tea at the front desk was super delicious. We were going out to play, so we took handheld electric fans, paper towels, and water for the children. The most convenient thing was the floral water in separate packages, which was very practical. They took cold brew tea for us adults and we went out to play happily. Speaking of the room, we booked the Yanbo King Room, the fruits were very fresh, there were many kinds of mini water bars (all free), and snacks (all free), all of which were liked by children. It was more than 4 o'clock when we came back from playing, which was the time to replenish energy. The snacks were very suitable, especially the dried strawberries, which were planted and can be repurchased unlimitedly. The roses and bath salts in the bathroom were exquisitely placed, which made us happy physically and mentally, and the dry and wet separation was very thorough. There were also good night desserts in the evening, which could be delivered directly to the room. We went back at more than 11 o'clock and they were delivered to us. The hotel also had a lot of activities. My baby and I made flower arrangements and incense seals, and my husband tasted tea on the side (the tea ceremony of the hotel was also very OK The hotel arranged a night tour of the Grand Canal.

The hardware facilities are very good, and the feeling of a five-star hotel, whether it is the lobby, restaurant, or room. What surprised me even more was that all the service staff I met were warm and thoughtful, and I almost wanted to give it six stars. The snacks and drinks in the room are all free, and the quality of these snacks is also quite good. This hotel can be said to be the most satisfactory hotel I have stayed in in China in recent years. If you consider the price, it is simply a great value for money! Highly recommended!

msg:The hotel opened not long ago, so it is very new, and the decoration style is also very distinctive. The hotel is in a prime location, and the starting point of the Grand Canal Cultural Corridor is right outside. It has its own characteristics during the day and at night. The main thing at night is the beautiful lights. The scenery along the lake during the day is also very good. I personally prefer the beautiful scenery during the day. The car was parked in the parking lot of the scenic area, and it was not far to walk to the hotel. On the first day of check-in, because there were few people, the buffet in the morning was not open, and it was ordered. I felt a little disappointed. It was simple and had no characteristics. The next morning was a buffet breakfast, and the level went up immediately. There were many varieties and the quality was very good. It was also very delicate and distinctive. It was different from other five-star hotels. It has its own unique style, but there are not enough pictures. I will stay here next time I come to Huai'an. It is a half-hour drive from Hexia Ancient Town and other attractions. The hotel environment is good, clean and sanitary, and the front desk service is enthusiastic. The girl in the coffee bar is very professional and the latte art is very beautiful.

Environment: Right next to the Canal Square, very convenient for travel
Service: Friendly service, gifts were given when checking in, and gifts were given again when leaving the hotel. When leaving the hotel, my bag was left on the sofa in the lobby. I took a taxi to the station and the front desk called me. I hurried back to get it, and the front desk sent it out enthusiastically.
Hygiene: The hygiene is very clean everywhere
Facilities: The hotel was opened only last year, and the facilities are very new.
The buffet breakfast is very good, and the coffee is made freshly at the coffee bar on the first floor. It is much better than the self-service coffee machines in other hotels. I drank two cups and still couldn't get enough👍

msg:I am very honored to come to such a warm city and meet many warm hotel reception service staff. One of them is particularly touching. After my friend and I checked in, we asked her about the ancient canal cruise. She answered our questions very sincerely and in detail. Even when we had walked out of the hotel, she still followed us in the cold wind and patiently finished the remaining words. She was smiling all the time, without a trace of perfunctory, which made us feel that as guests, we were respected and valued by the hotel. I was very moved. I have to say that the service of many five-star hotels is not so good.
Hygiene: The hotel sheets are cleaner than I thought, because I am a little clean, and I have to bring disposable bedding travel sets every time I go out, but this time, I feel that it is a bit redundant. But there are still some small details and room for improvement. For example, the table is a little dirty, there are water stains in the kettle, etc. It may be that the aunt did not notice it, and I personally have higher requirements for hygiene and have higher expectations for hotels.
Catering: We ordered a lot of food for the morning delivery service, and the juice was definitely freshly squeezed and tasted good, but the steak was cold. I think it's winter now, and the kitchen is a long way from the room, which is understandable. Generally speaking, it's pretty good.
Having said so much, I am still very satisfied with the hotel. The service is good. There are some small details, which I think are acceptable. The above are my real feelings about staying in the hotel. I highly recommend everyone to stay in this hotel. The reason why I wrote some small details is because I have higher expectations for the hotel, and I sincerely hope that the hotel can do better and better. A service staff can support a hotel, but it may also ruin a hotel. The foundation of service lies in people, and to make the hotel better and better, it is not the guests, but every service staff in the hotel. Feel it with your heart, put the needs of customers first, and think in their shoes. Then you will be moved in an instant.
Once again, thank every service staff of the hotel for their hard work. You are really great!

The service of the staff is particularly good, everyone can see that they are very happy from the bottom of their hearts, and I feel very good. There are always handicrafts to do in the store, and you can also drink tea. On the first afternoon, because I didn’t do the intangible cultural heritage handicrafts when I went to the ancient town, I experienced Xiangzhuan on the second day and arranged a New Year dragon box handicraft for the children, which was great.
There is welcome tea when you enter the store, and tea, drinks, fruit snacks and snacks in the room are free, as well as goodnight sweet soup, which is very warm. The breakfast experience is also very good, and the service staff will take the initiative to ask you if you want to eat staple food or coffee.
A souvenir was also given when I left the store, I like it very much, and I will continue to stay next time I come to Huai'an!

Seeing the snow, they also helped the children book the hotel's internal handicrafts and sent boat tickets. In short, the service is super considerate! 

The mini bar in the room is free, there is a fruit platter when you come, and there is sweet soup in the evening, which is great! Breakfast is also very good. When there are not many people, you can order it and let the service staff deliver it to the room at the agreed time. The taste is also very good! 

The room facilities are very new, because it is a new hotel, but there is still a little smell to dissipate. There is a Xiaodu smart robot in the room, and the hotel TV projection is very convenient. 

Because of the itinerary, you need to check out one day in advance. The front desk also very considerately guides the operation and refunds in seconds. 

The check-in experience is very good, but it’s a pity that I forgot to take pictures. I will definitely stay next time I come to Huai'an.

Facilities: The hotel is located right next to the Royal Pier and the scenic spot. It is very easy to find. The door is low-key and luxurious. The parking lot is in the scenic area, with many parking spaces and easy access. The hotel has two floors, with a quiet environment and complete facilities. The air conditioning in the room is sufficient, and there is an air purifier. There are many varieties of snacks in the tea bar. There are also four or five kinds of drinks in the water bar. The complimentary drinking water is Bama Platinum Spring, and the quality is still very high. The complimentary fruit plate is also very rich. The breakfast is very rich, with many choices in addition to local famous food, and the food supply is also replenished in a timely manner. The beef noodles have a lot of beef and taste very good. I accidentally found prawn tempura in the morning, which is rare.

Service: Special praise for the service. Everyone in the store has a strong sense of service, which shows that the management is standardized and the employees have a positive and serious work attitude. First of all, after placing the order, I contacted you one day in advance to communicate the arrival of the car and other information. The service staff at the store were dedicated to greet you and carry your luggage. Check-in was also very fast, and someone was sent to the room to give a detailed introduction to the use of room facilities. He also took the initiative to provide quilts, etc., and prepared special toiletries and teeth for the children. The experience of entering the store feels very intimate, and I feel that the store service staff are present throughout the entire process. They will take you illustrations in the afternoon and take you on a canal tour in the evening. There is also sweet soup and a little wine before going to bed. There was tea tasting in the morning, and afternoon tea was also very rich, with many people checking in.
There are many activities in the hotel, the details are as follows: Hello, dear Dihuahua.

服務方面，接觸到的員工都十分熱情主動，從入住到離店，都有賓至如歸的感覺，特別感謝小花安排的母親節鮮花。
酒店早餐，不論自助還是套餐，品質都很高，融入了當地特色美食，咖啡口感很好。
酒店位置，離御碼頭美食街、裏運河遊船、花街都近在咫尺，離清晏園也不遠，是遊玩清河浦區域的好選擇。

建議： 
1. 個人覺得窗外擺設的人造花有點減分，還不如不放。
2. 酒店自帶的餐飲、酒吧好像沒有看到太多的介紹，所以此次沒有體驗。

早餐：可以坐在室外吃，看着街景真的無比愜意。雖然品種比起常規星級酒店，不算多，但是都很精緻，牛肉麪特別特別好吃，牛肉都是入味的軟爛大塊，一頓吃兩碗沒問題，還有煎牛排，第二天還吃到了煙燻三文魚！
房間內有五六種小零食，冰櫃的飲料有五種：可樂巴黎水椰子水橙汁和蘇打水，歡迎水果也很豐盛，還有晚安甜湯！
總的來説，十一節假日呆在淮安這個美食小城，住着超值的精品酒店，真的無比舒服，聽説酒店還在建設二期，希望將來可以帶着長者再次來住！

缺點：房間太熱，一直在26-28度，冷氣沒有，，熱的孩子凌晨1點才睡着。工作人員解釋是中央空調沒有開，也沒有電扇提供。當然這不是工作人員的問題，但作為淮安最高檔的酒店，做不到按氣温提供冷氣是有點不應該的。當然提供了一日額外的早餐作為補償，這個態度還是非常值得肯定的。

總體：非常值得推薦體驗

再説説酒店的區位，就位於裏運河文化長廊，看裏運河夜景非常方便。附近有有軌電車站，去河下古鎮非常方便，非常適合作為來淮安旅遊的落腳點。
此外，酒店房間隔音非常好，不用擔心附近人潮洶湧帶來的噪音。
整體五星好評，下次來還會住這裏。

我們來的已經凌晨，而且還下雨，前台小哥小徐熱情接待，早早佈置好房間，送了水果和孩子洗漱用品玩具。
酒店所有服務人員都是彬彬有禮，主動服務，這是我在國內外居住過各種類型賓館酒店，包括美國日本，希爾頓還是萬達，不論幾星都沒有遇到過的。
房間智能化語音控制，落地窗賞心悦目。早餐水準也很高，看圖即可，一碗牛肉麪説明一切。
酒店免費停車也很方便，目前正在造新停車場，等到新停車場建好，就更加近。
地段處在景區中心位置，可以深入淮安人民生活，所配圖片視頻皆為原始素材，沒有美化。最後走的時候，服務員小姐姐小金送到我們車上，很是感動。
希望酒店越來越好，來淮安旅遊衹選這一家足夠。本身就是御碼頭景區，夜遊裏運河穿拖鞋步行5分鐘，到西遊樂園半小時車程，到肥貓島50分鐘，到盱眙小龍蝦90分鐘。自駕遊毫無壓力。
酒店價格對於淮安來説是比較高的，但是獲得了旅行的滿足感，這些錢不貴，一天少住宿幾百塊，多花其他地方几百塊，心情還不好，錢也沒少花，不值得。
所以衹有一句話結尾，強烈推薦！
最後聲明，本人不是託，衹是如實評價。來淮安的遊客自己體驗便知道了。也希望酒店能保持高水準，不要曇花一現。

環境：酒店環境很好 是獨棟的二層樓建築  古色古香的風格  周邊地理位置不錯  就在花街和裏運河旁邊  晚上去裏運河看夜景非常方便

衞生： 酒店保潔真的超讚  房間打掃的非常細緻  我們放在桌上的外賣垃圾 保潔員會仔細分辨 沒吃完的給我們留下  所有的一次性用品包括mini bar的飲品零食甚至水果盤每天都會補齊 非常讓人驚喜

服務： 服務是這家酒店最讚的一項  大堂的每位工作人員態度都很友善  第一天辦理入住時給我們提供飲品  還為我們準備了歡迎水果（第二天還送了一份新果盤）浴球 漱口水 精油 等等  晚上會提供晚安甜湯  最後一天退房時因為天氣炎熱送了小電風扇和酒店大堂同款香薰  真的超貼心！
下次來淮安玩還要定這家酒店😄

房間挺大的，唯一不足的就是附近的廣場上晚上有放音樂的，在房間裏能聽見，有點影響。

2.活動豐富，帶孩子出遊，天氣悶熱不出門的時候體驗酒店的活動，插花、做淮陽美食～孩子很開心。
3.房間有送體驗喝茶，喝着茶看外面的景色超美。很喜歡店裡的茶具，還買了一套。
總之不虛必行，期待下一次的相遇。
