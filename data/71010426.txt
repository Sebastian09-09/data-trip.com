msg:I have long wanted to check out LUX Secret, and finally had a perfect birthday here this time. The hotel is very big. As soon as you enter the gate, you will see a beautiful cycling path, which is much more beautiful than the Mingshi countryside outside. There is a small welcome ceremony and homemade ice powder when you get off the car, which tastes good. The scenery in the lobby should attract most people to go there, it is really beautiful and photogenic. In fact, the whole hotel is full of beautiful scenery, banana road, infinity pool, restaurant, and every path is beautiful. This time I stayed in the only and largest pool villa of LUX, with complete hardware facilities, and a lot of food and drinks were given, including several bottles of wine, snacks, and drinks, which were all delicious. The hygiene of the entire hotel is strictly managed. Someone has been wiping the elevator all the time. There are air conditioners in the elevator and it smells delicious. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the service, which is the most satisfactory of the entire trip. The housekeeper Alyssa is beautiful and sweet. She arranged all the matters for the check-in day before going. WeChat replied at the speed of light, afternoon tea and dinner were arranged very well, and Yunzui Wine Cellar also made a cake on the birthday. Thank you again to LUX and Miss Alyssa for giving me an unforgettable birthday.

msg:Facilities: 1. Free yoga classes, the teachers are more professional, and you will feel refreshed after morning exercises. 2. The hotel's welcoming etiquette is in place at this price, and the smile of the Zhuang aunt can infect you. 3. The room facilities are complete, and the daily fruits and drinks in the refrigerator are fully replenished. 4. The breakfast is relatively rich, focusing on southern food, but it suits my taste. 5. The starry sky bar and the open-air cinema environment are also very good. You can go to the bar to have a cocktail in the evening. 6. The free rental bicycles must not be missed. You can also rent a ** car outside the hotel to go to Yulingba and Mingshi Tianyuan for a whole day.
Hygiene: Clean and tidy, and the hotel's groundwater is particularly good. The water is slippery when you wash and bathe, like underground natural hot spring water. This is indeed rare in high-end hotels in China.
Environment: The unique geographical advantage is indeed attractive, and the hotel is very good for taking pictures.
Service: The service butler added WeChat in advance, thoughtful and considerate, and basic matters will be informed in advance, including the weather forecast for the next day, which is particularly considerate.
But I also talk about the shortcomings and hope that the hotel will improve. For a hotel at this price, you must check the bathroom and bedding. The bathroom facilities are high-end, but not friendly to women. The height between the washstand and the wash basin is very large, which is not convenient. In addition, the bamboo raft afternoon tea is a bit rushed at 45 minutes. In fact, for most people, they just want to take pictures first, so the tea time is almost not enough. Finally, the expensive Detian Tea House, the desserts and bamboo raft afternoon tea are from the same hotel, so they are very different, and the taste is really average. But the nuts are not fresh enough, either the skin is broken or it is rotten, which does not meet such a high-end price. And the scenic spot tours and services should be improved, and guests do not enjoy too many preferential policies.

msg:It is definitely the ceiling level of domestic resort hotels! The hotel is located in the green mountains and clear waters, and it is worthy of the word "secret place"; the guest rooms are spacious and bright, with a reasonable layout and particularly good lighting; the beach slippers in the guest rooms are very comfortable to wear; the fragrance is high-end; the self-service laundry room is very convenient; all the waiters are very polite and have a bright smile; the hotel's food level is super high! We ate in the Chinese restaurant, private customized restaurant, buffet breakfast, and starry sky bar in the hotel, and there was nothing wrong with it! If you stay a few more days, you will definitely gain ten pounds! 

By the way, the hotel's tea room in Detian Waterfall is also worth experiencing! Every afternoon tea set is delicious! The scenery is beautiful! 

Finally, I praise the hotel's service team again! Needless to say, the timely response is the key to almost meeting all requests! Too powerful! 

For such a hotel with impeccable hardware and software, I still picked out a "problem"-the hotel has no shopping area! Hahahaha! Who told me that I am a person who loves shopping? Such a great hotel, if there are some original products, such as postcards, hats, small bags, notebooks, it would be even better!

Because of this hotel, we all fell in love with Chongzuo!

msg:This hotel is so popular. We made this trip plan because we saw that there were vacancies this week. We didn't expect to catch up with BMW's corporate activities. Ctrip took the initiative to contact us and some areas were unavailable, so more than 2,000 a night was more cost-effective.

Service: Before we checked in, the housekeeper Alyssa took the initiative to contact the group and introduced the various activities and consumption items of the hotel in detail. It was very considerate. Before arriving, register the license plate number in advance and drive directly into the hotel. There was a battery car to pick up and the traditional LUX welcome ceremony. After arriving, the housekeeper accompanied and introduced the whole process. You can ask the housekeeper all questions in the hotel. The service is warm and thoughtful. Because it happened to be our wedding anniversary, the hotel also prepared a surprise cake, which was full of touching. Thank you housekeeper!

Environment: Not to mention the hotel scenery, you can spend a day in the hotel. I thought I had stayed in many luxury brands and resort hotels at home and abroad, but I was still shocked after coming here. You can also ride the hotel's free bicycles to visit Mingshi Manor, the scenery is beautiful. The scenery in the room is invincible, and the wood and stone used in the decoration directly feel integrated into nature.

All in all, I am very satisfied with this stay. The environment is excellent, the service is considerate, and for people who have lived in the city for a long time, it feels like returning to nature. At the same time, the facilities are very complete. It was a perfect travel experience. If I have the opportunity to come to Chongzuo next time, I will definitely choose to stay again.

msg:I won't say much about the advantages. It is one of the top resorts in China.
The key point!!! If you come to Chongzuo or even Guangxi Province, just go for it without considering the budget!!!

The disadvantages are as follows:
1. The communication and service capabilities of the front desk during the peak tourist season are insufficient. The explanation of the customer service by phone is not soothing enough. There are many WeChat customer service numbers.
2. There are still some large flying insects, which is definitely not as good as the independent island resort.
3. The independent swimming pool of the suite has a smell similar to disinfectant, and after raining, substances such as shellac will float. I didn't go to the public swimming pool, so I don't know.
4. The hair is dry and unbearable after washing.

They called in advance to confirm the check-in time and check-in habits, set up a WeChat group for easy communication, and grasped the details well. Secondly, the environment and facilities are good. There is no need to say more about this. Just see the picture. It is definitely worth the money. Finally, the food is good. All three meals of the day were solved in the hotel, and the taste was not bad. The two-day stay caught up with the high temperature of 38 degrees. The ice jelly at the entrance of the hotel was put with more osmanthus and roses for three bowls, which was simply refreshing. The hotel's slippers are linen, very comfortable to wear, and my dad praised them again and again. When changing rooms halfway, my parents were anxious to check in, and the staff also rushed to clean up a room. I am really grateful.

It is very private and has good light control. The most noteworthy thing is the visual enjoyment brought to guests by the beautiful scenery outside the balcony.
For the elderly, the room has the following shortcomings: (1) there are two steps on the second floor, which can easily cause falls; (2) the bed is on the inner side, which is inconvenient for living. There is a problem with the passage, and two steps need to be lowered, which makes it more risky to get up at night.
The dining arrangements are rich and perfect. For the elderly, the dinner is too rich and wasteful. It is recommended to choose exquisiteness rather than quantity. The third option, namely the elderly meal, can be considered.
Chongzuo has inconvenient transportation and it is not easy to get a taxi. The overall environment needs to be improved. It is recommended that the resort moderately improve the transportation conditions and make suggestions for the convenience of the elderly.
The overall service level is very high. Every employee is dedicated and enthusiastic. They greet or say hello when they meet. It is rare. All the needs of the guests can be fully met.
Thanks to the 7-person housekeeper team represented by Amanda and Lidia for their warm reception and service. This is what it means to make guests feel at home. The 3-day and 2-night experience at the Secret Lux Resort was wonderful. I hope to have the opportunity to meet again.

The food feels oily overall, but I personally have a light taste, and my friend thinks it's good. The Western dinner in the wine cellar is generally good. The steak is the most satisfactory. It is recommended to pair it with some refreshing food to relieve the greasiness.
There are cycling, bamboo rafting, gym and other entertainment facilities and hand-made inside the hotel. It is also good to choose to play in the hotel instead of going out to visit attractions.
Overall, the service is very good, and all supporting facilities still have room for improvement, such as food can be strengthened üòä

msg:A super hotel, whether it is service or environment, you will definitely be impeccable! The hotel is 26 kilometers away from Detian Waterfall. There are charging piles in the hotel parking lot, which is very convenient! ! ! The welcome was very ceremonial, and I quite enjoyed the walk from the door to the front desk. The lobby was like a moving landscape painting! The sugar orange provided by the hotel is really sweet. You can‚Äôt get anything this delicious in Beijing! The rooms are also thoughtfully designed, so comfortable! Checking out today coincides with the third anniversary of the hotel, and I also gave a small gift! Will come again if I have the chance! The kids took a lot of photos, they are really beautiful!

msg:After checking in, I found out that the price matched the room. The most beautiful scenery in Chongzuo is exclusively occupied by Lishi. The room is large and comfortable, with a large balcony with great views. The snack minibar in the room is free, and the fruits are washed and delivered very sweet. The housekeeper arranged everything before check-in. While waiting for the room to be cleaned, the housekeeper took a tour of the entire hotel and gave a detailed introduction. During the tour, he saw that I was uncomfortable wearing high heels and thoughtfully gave me slippers to change into. Whether it is the scenery, restaurant dishes or staff service attitude, it is second to none among domestic high-end hotels.

msg:Because of this resort, I arranged for my whole family to travel to Guangxi during the Spring Festival. We came to Chongzuo, a warm and spring-like border town. It is indeed a veritable "secret place"! The resort is located on the bank of the Mingshi River in the Mingshi Pastoral Scenic Area. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers. It can be said that every step of the way is full of surprises. The architectural design and natural landscape are full of surprises. What is particularly worth mentioning is the extremely powerful butler service team! Before check-in, a service group will be established on WeChat to respond quickly to guests' needs and respond to all requests! There is a drift bottle project in the hotel regularly every day. Customers who find a drift bottle will be given a small gift. We missed the time that day, and the housekeeper also specially arranged to hide an extra drift bottle for the children and experience a small Happy and special thanks! In addition, our daily dinner was half an hour earlier than the normal meal time. The butler helped us contact the chef to prepare the meal in advance. Because the flight was very early on the day before departure, we needed to have breakfast half an hour in advance. The butler made arrangements for these special needs one by one. Proper, very considerate and safe! By the way, the welcome ceremony at the resort is worth mentioning. The oil tea that the guests tasted was particularly delicious and left an unforgettable aftertaste! I heard that a hotel can bring about a city, and it is indeed well-deserved, haha

msg:Continuing from the previous article, the staff provided very good service and were very polite.

Personally, I think the scenery of the hotel is much better than that of Mingshi Tianyuan. It is better to stay in the hotel for half a day to enjoy the scenery and take pictures.

I took a bath on the balcony at night, and it was a different enjoyment to watch the moon and mountain scenery, but I had to be careful of mosquitoes.

The only drawback: It is recommended to travel by car. It is generally difficult to call a car in that area. The hotel car is limited to the airport pick-up station, and the price is expensive.

msg:It has been suggested by major travel platforms for a long time, and finally the trip took place. It was the end of March and it was not yet the peak season, so I bought a Ctrip package for RMB8,600, which included two breakfasts and two dinners. The hotel prices were not the cheapest, but they had not yet completely increased. Chartering a car from Nanning East Railway Station to the hotel takes 2 and a half hours. The journey is picturesque and the road conditions are very good. After arriving at the hotel, the Zhuang sister sang ^Ma le Ma le^ at the door and put Zhuang hydrangea on the guests. They could also taste Zhuang oil tea, which was a full welcome ceremony. As Sister Zhuang walks into the hotel, it is as mysterious as the name of the hotel. The hotel lobby is designed as a semi-open design, and what directly comes into view is a landscape painting. I was lucky enough to be assigned to a hotel room on the third floor. It is said to be an Internet celebrity room. The most satisfying part is that I can do my makeup facing the landscape. In the morning, it is also a pleasure to connect the phone to the speaker, make a cup of coffee, draw the scenery, and put on makeup. We recommend several activities in the hotel. The most recommended is the bamboo raft afternoon tea, especially at three o'clock in the afternoon, when there is plenty of sunshine, and it will not affect your dinner even if you are full. The second is to use the hotel's free bicycles to go around the Minshi countryside. Five or six are recommended. Before the sun goes down, watch the sunset illuminate the pastoral scenery and take pictures of fish scales. In addition, the hotel library is also worth a visit, and you can also do yoga and go fishing as you like! Overall, this stay was very satisfying! Special thanks to all the housekeepers for their warm hospitality, especially to sister Amanda for her warm welcome! ‚ô•Ô∏è

With beautiful mountains and clear waters, and numerous mountains and hills, the hotel is a large landscape picture whenever you take a photo.
I accidentally checked into the hotel's Internet celebrity room 3302. According to the waiter, it has the best view in the entire hotel. I'm happy.
The hotel housekeeper established a WeChat group well before check-in. If you have any requirements, you can put them in the group and they will be solved immediately. The communication is very smooth.
Every staff member in the hotel is very nice and greets guests with a smile.
The hotel will deliver desserts and fruits every day. Although there are not many varieties of breakfast, it will change a little the next day, which is basically satisfactory.

Highly recommended, the second is the hotel‚Äôs bamboo raft afternoon tea, which is a bit too short, only 45 minutes. It is recommended to travel by car, otherwise the transportation is not very convenient. The hotel has a chartered car service, the price is slightly higher, you can choose according to your own situation. The other experiences are really nice. I would like to praise the hotel again.

The only drawback is that many local farmers in Guangxi are burning straw, and the smell of smoke on the last day was really strong. In fact, burning straw is banned in many places because of serious air pollution. However, this is not the hotel's problem. There is also a private customized dinner in the hotel, which is very cost-effective, but the portion is a bit large, and one person really has to hold on to the wall to finish eating. In addition, the lights at the hotel's sink could be brighter, it seems a bit difficult.

msg:Service: All, every staff member smiles and greets you sincerely. They may not be able to speak Mandarin accurately, but their sincere and simple attitude makes people feel warm and healing. This is unmatched by other hotels and must be praised!
Hygiene: good. It can be seen that the hotel is very considerate and the employees work hard to create a comfortable and hygienic environment.
Environment: It's a world of difference compared to the outside. It is a good place for leisure and vacation. The hotel provides bicycles for riding around, and the pastoral scenery is also good.
Facilities: Everything else was good. The only thing was that there was a splashing sound from the water outlet upstairs and downstairs in the middle of the night. I was woken up and thought there were fireworks. But later I felt it was not the case. I was scared and had to wake up my husband to check. I don‚Äôt know if other guests have reacted. It would be best for hotel engineering to check whether it is a common phenomenon or a special cause.
Meal: Very goodüëç, exquisite, rich and delicious. My set meal includes dinner, which is not sloppy at all. Especially the pre-dinner snacks, delicious, my favoriteüòç

The room is on the first floor of Building 5. I am very satisfied with the equipment and cleanliness. The only regret is that it only has a mountain view. If you can live in the second building, it will be perfect. The breakfast is very unique, the buffet is rich, and you can order food.

The hotel management is in an orderly manner. We call in advance to understand the guests' preferences. When checking in, the front desk has basically mastered the guests' main information.
The guest rooms along the river are designed to have one room and one view, each with its own characteristics.
The guest rooms are spacious and have a good living experience. Especially sitting on the big balcony, drinking water, listening to music, and becoming one with the mountains and rivers...
The dining options are strong, with good Chinese, Western and local specialties. The breakfast is reasonably arranged, accompanied by the natural beauty outside the window and delicious food.
The hotel staff took the initiative to help carry luggage and were always on call.
Objectively speaking, two days of stay is a perfect travel experience.

You can take pictures of beautiful scenery everywhere. 2 The hotel has complete facilities, such as swimming pool, library, billiards, board games, and chess and cards. You will not feel bored. It has many activities, meditation, yoga, etc., and there are also bamboo raft sightseeing afternoon teas, of course some of which are paid 3 The hotel has a strong sense of design, with modern tables and chairs that are as warm as home where you can rest anywhere, as well as solid wood floors, cement-toned walls, and walls made of concave and convex stones. In addition, there are natural scenery and some staircase glass. The lines are not abrupt at all and make people stop everywhere. Although I know nothing about architecture or design, I feel the importance of designers. 4 The hardware in the room is very good, mostly solid wood furniture, from kettle to wash basin to hair dryer The toilets are all first-class brands. The mini bar is rich and has free 5 services. The attitude of all the staff is friendly and natural. The breakfast is rich and the hotel restaurant tastes good. In short, it is highly recommended.

msg:We booked three days and two nights on New Year's Day in advance. After arriving at Nanning Wuxu Airport, we took a seven-seater business car to the hotel. The journey took less than two and a half hours. (Based on this experience, it is recommended to reserve a hotel vehicle in advance to pick up the airport. In this way, the cost is relatively fixed. We took a business car by ourselves and it was more than 100 yuan more than a hotel car.) Because the newly built expressway was opened to traffic, the road was very smooth. The 360-degree mountains surrounding the entire road were quite beautiful. After arriving at the hotel, the ethnic minority lady Hydrangeas and oil tea will be presented to you, and then you will be guided through the wooden plank road, wooden house, and banana forest, and take the elevator to the second floor. When you open the door, you will see a big wishing tree. After passing the wishing tree, you will find the hotel lobby. A landscape painting in front of you is still very shocking. , the person who received us was sister Amanda from the hotel. If we had any problems with her during our stay, she would always respond to our requests and try her best to find ways to coordinate and resolve them. Big thumbs up! During the three days of New Year's Day, the hotel arranged many more activities than usual. On New Year's Eve, we got on a bamboo raft at around 5 o'clock and went to the bonfire party. It was a truly secret place in the hotel that was not open to the public. At night, we were under the starry sky on the third floor. It was a Karst New Year's Eve party. The hotel specially invited a beautiful DJ and a foreign band. Finally, there was the New Year's Eve countdown and the grand Karst Fireworks show. The New Year's Eve countdown and fireworks show were quite shocking, especially when the laser lights illuminated the LUX* font and countdown numbers. When hitting the mountains in the distance, it‚Äôs really beautiful~

Hospitality?

First of all, thank you to Ctrip, especially our Xiaoyue, who communicated with us throughout the entire process and immediately made cash compensation for this extremely disappointing stay.

The main theme of the store every day is construction site noise (8:30 to 18:30 every day) and construction dust. How can the booking page not mention this at all? ?

‚ö†Ô∏è By all means AVOID this place, which has intentionally concealed its disturbing on-going construction during the booking process.

When making the reservation, the store deliberately concealed the fact that large-scale building construction was underway. When we drove more than 1,000 kilometers with our parents to arrive, we were very disappointed to find that the hotel was undergoing renovations in many places, and the 2 riverside villas (8103/8104) we booked were actually located next to the 7th building that was under construction. Living next door to a construction site, LUX* hospitality?

The most disgusting & stomach-churning thing is ü§¢ü§Æ
The store‚Äôs Ctrip booking page makes no mention of this matter;
At check-in, nothing was mentioned about this;
After being led to the door of the room, I "accidentally" saw the bustling large-scale construction site;
A piece of generic A4 white paper was placed in the room in a relaxed and low-key manner, "Oh dear, since you have moved in, I want to say that we are under constructionüèóüë∑‚ö†Ô∏è"

Construction is done to attract more business, but what about the business that was deceived because it was kept in the dark? It‚Äôs less noisy when you close the doors and windows. Is this LUX* hospitality?

Throughout the day, if you want to rest in your room, the doors and windows must be closed. It is completely impossible to use the outdoor seating area, viewing area and swimming pool of the villa type.

btw, how did we quickly identify our room next to the construction site? Our luggage was left alone on the slate floor 1.5 meters away from the door (yes, not put in the guest room that claims to be more than 150 square meters). Is this LUX* hospitality? ?

A terrible start. Intentionally concealed the truth for making immediate moneyüí∞ A total lost of enjoyment :(

Ctrip After Ctrip assisted in the communication, the young management of the hotel push began to put out firefighting customer relations and avoid the loss of chargebacks. But it is a pity that the hotel, which does not hesitate to deceive consumers for the sake of income, gives these children extremely weak support and allows them to complete the meal without rice.

8105 was repaired urgently, but door handles and spray-painted railings were still being installed at noon the next day; the total compensation amount was 0; the compensation method for in-store activities was the minimum (the 2 free activities squeezed out, the hotel‚Äôs own quotation added up, not enough for accommodation) 7% of the fee).

After checking out, the restaurant compensation method continued the store's deceptive style, making vague verbal promises and trying to get away with it. I feel sorry for the children who have returned from overseas and are trapped like shadow puppets, struggling to move forward. These children, who take care of the guests and play the vanguard, are unfortunately not empowered and can only spend a lot of personal time apologizing for the hotel's mistakes again and again. Thanks again to Ctrip for paying for our 3 meals.

Will we go back to this resort?
NEVER.
China is such a big country, and new and beautiful hotels are emerging one after another. It is impossible for us to return to an opportunistic hotel that is dishonest, does not abide by the rules of the hospitality industry, takes chances, and tries to get by to make small profits.

Our advice: Avoid it at all cost.
Our tip: The hotel has verbally stated that the construction work will continue until next year.

Service: We drove to the door of the hotel by ourselves. There was a welcome ceremony with local ethnic characteristics, and welcome sweets were made on site. The customer service staff at check-in were very good. When checking out and driving away, they waved until the car was out of sight of the guests. The details were indeed well grasped.

In addition to the sofa at the end of the bed where you can sit and watch the view, there is also a leisure soft sleeper area on the side. The bathtub in the toilet can be used to take a bath and watch the view. You can even enjoy it while sitting on the toilet. landscape.
Food: Dinner was delicious. I ordered Vietnamese noodles, shrimp, and eggplant, which all tasted great. The breakfast is semi-buffet and you can order or pick it up yourself. One suggestion, you can actually make the rice noodles in the egg rolls in the kitchen. If you fry them directly in the restaurant, the air will be filled with a greasy smell, and your hair and clothes will be smelled after breakfast, which is not the most friendly.
Activities: You can experience free yoga activities in the morning. I am the only one taking the class in the morning, which is equivalent to enjoying one-on-one personal training with the original price of about 500. There are billiards, chess, backgammon, etc. in the activity room. There are also many paid activities such as painting and crafts, and at night I even watched the fireworks that others paid for.

Check-in includes fruits, afternoon tea, white wine in the room, and turndown service in the evening. I also created a group before moving in. If I need anything, I can always ask the housekeeper. The hotel occupies a large area, but there are not many rooms. Each room is more than 80 square meters. You can do yoga, swim, exercise, read books, and go to the spa without going out. The day after you check in, you can just take photos in the hotel. Walked more than 4,000 steps. The breakfast at the hotel is also good. It costs 198 per extra person. The room price is sky-high in the local area, but it is still worth a try.

There will be a traditional welcome ceremony of the Zhuang people after entering the hotel. There will be movies played in the Starry Sky Cinema every night. Unfortunately, I was there only two days. Because of the rain, we moved indoors. There will be a yoga class by the infinity pool in the morning. Although I am the only one in the class, the yoga teacher Monica is still very serious. It is a good experience to do sun salutations in the green mountains and green water. The hotel has bicycles, and you can ride on the cycling routes around the hotel, which is very pleasant. It‚Äôs just that some places are remote, so be careful. The housekeeper Lidia was very considerate in helping me arrange and coordinate meal services because of my schedule.

Chongzuo is a small secluded town on the border between China and Vietnam. The resort is located among the beautiful karst mountains and the bright landscape environment opens like an ink painting scroll.
All rooms have spacious balconies to enjoy the sunset. The hardware facilities are good, and the snacks and minibar in the room are free~
It takes 40 minutes to drive from the resort to Detian. I also contacted the front desk in advance to book the resort‚Äôs VIP waterfall teahouse in the scenic area. The scenery is amazing!
Thank you to the butler Sherry for your considerate and considerate service.

But there are still a few comments:
1. The service response was not very timely. I asked for the room to be cleaned at noon, but I didn‚Äôt come until I pressed again in the afternoon. The next day, I had breakfast and asked for an a la carte menu. I pressed for it about a dozen times before it came.
2. There is only one restaurant and there is no takeout nearby. The food options are a bit limited and the price/performance ratio is not very high.
3. As a high-end hotel with a price similar to that of Bulgari in Shanghai, the selection of mini bar is a bit perfunctory. I hope you can refer to Bulgari‚Äôs minibar.
4. There should be many parents bringing their children to this hotel, but it is a bit inappropriate to charge for parent-child bicycles.
5. The water temperature of the swimming pool is really cold
6. There are some bugs in the room design that are not friendly to families with children. The marble steps are easy to fall on (especially at night). There is a wooden board behind the bed and you may hit your head accidentally. There is also a sharp wooden board behind the sofa (connected to the bed) and you may hit your head accidentally.
7. I hope the children‚Äôs playground will open soon

Lushi Secret Land is located in the Mingshi Pastoral Scenic Area and can be arranged together with the scenic spot, passing through the rice fields and the river is hidden in the mountains. After parking the car and picking up your luggage, there is an aunt in local ethnic costumes at the door who will give you a welcome dessert, which is very kind! After passing through the banana forest and the wooden plank road and taking the elevator to the second floor, when you open the door, the landscape outside the lobby opens up like an ink painting scroll. Remember to book various activities in advance. When the hotel called me the day before, I was shivering on the magic carpet (yes, I'm slightly afraid of heights) and didn't react. Fortunately, there was still the last fishing spot left. It was my first time fishing. , only two came up, and the "Kid Brother" we met by chance learned about it, one Tilapia and a tall catfish. "Kid Brother" even took out an oxygen machine to help us rescue the small fish (although he did not save the fish) ) You can also paint oil paintings, do pottery, and swim by the mountains. There are free bicycles at the entrance of the hotel. You can ride to the scenic spots outside the hotel (save money on renting a car) and go out to eat roast pig. On the way back to the hotel by bike, I looked up at the starry sky. It was a sky full of stars that I couldn't usually see and the Milky Way that could be seen with the naked eye. When you return to the hotel in the evening, you can go to the Star Bar to watch a movie (there is wine, it‚Äôs fun to have a drink and watch a movie in the evening breeze).

The children were more serious, so the hotel arranged for staff to take them to the health center for examination. The main reason was that three people who were sleeping on the bed were bitten. A bed for ten thousand and one night during the National Day should not have such hygiene problems.

All kinds of snacks, drinks and alcohol in the room are free, and night meals are also provided for free. The room was very comfortable, with a big and comfortable bed. There was also a small courtyard outside the villa where I could sit and watch the scenery, but because it rained when I went there, I couldn't experience it. There are a lot of things to do in the leisure area, and fruits and tea are provided for free. Overall, the vacation is very comfortable and enjoyable!
Bad: There is a stipulation for extra occupancy, and you have to pay extra. Even if you don‚Äôt add quilts and pillows, you will still be charged. Breakfast is the same. We are three adults and one baby, and breakfast will cost 198 for one extra person. This is really true for such an expensive hotel. I don‚Äôt understand. I stayed in more than a thousand five-star hotels during the same period and didn‚Äôt need to add a separate breakfast fee. When I was having breakfast, I was offered various promotions, asking if I should buy this or that, and they were told that the breakfast was semi-buffet, which I never did. I've experienced it, it's too commercial, it feels like catching a fat sheep and slaughtering it. Because there is no restaurant near the hotel and you have to drive 15-20 minutes to get there, we have lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant. To be honest: it is really expensive and not recommended. Of course, if you are not short of money, you can experience eating and watching the scenery. Feel it!
Summary: It is suitable for really rich people to live there. It is not short of money. Ordinary families or middle-class families may not go there again after experiencing it once!

msg:Six thousand one night at Xiatou Hotel, the worst hotel experience

It‚Äôs hard to imagine that the most anticipated part of this trip was actually the worst. After reading the overwhelming praise from Xiaohongshu, I can only say that the hotel may have spent all its money on the initial lobby hardware facilities and subsequent promotion.
After staying for one night, I immediately decided to cancel my subsequent reservations and change hotels decisively.

First of all, there is advertising fraud in the hotel, and the actual room type is seriously inconsistent with the picture. We booked a Select LUX Suite, and the picture on Ctrip shows a river view on both sides. When I opened the door, I was shocked by a bright gray wall. The only thing left facing me was the "scenery" where I could see the noisy crowds in the swimming pool and the ceiling.
In addition, the structure of the bathroom is also very different from the picture. The mirror is smaller, the basin is lowered, and you have to bend down to get skin care products.

After negotiating with the hotel manager, including Ctrip, the hotel insisted that there are various room types for the same room type. I have been seeing you for a long time and admire the hotel‚Äôs domineering character.

From the moment I checked in, I encountered at least two customer complaints. One complained that the hotel room was too noisy, and the other complained that the transfer to Detian was delayed for several hours, causing the elderly to wait for a long time. Not far away, I heard the service staff dealing with birthday arrangement bugs.
Of course, we are not immune.
I swiped the POS machine at the front desk to pay the deposit, but several of them were broken and I had to wait there for a long time. Checked in on the 24th, and the so-called housekeeper did not apply through WeChat friends until after checking out on the 25th... The air conditioner in the guest room blew directly towards the bedside, and the design was unscientific. The wood would make a strange squeaking sound from time to time at night. Hotel dinner disaster, the product is sorry for the hotel's positioning. (However, it is understandable that this hotel has nothing to offer except the basic service staff and the lobby view)

In short, only the scenery in the lobby is worth it. I believe many people are attracted by this beautiful scenery and yearn for it. But does the moon shine on the ditch? Is the leek taken advantage of?
Go read the negative reviews posted by amateurs on Xiaohongshu. That is the most authentic side of the hotel.

Finally, I would like to commend the hotel manager Dave Shaw. Your English is very standard and you very much support and defend the hotel‚Äôs hegemony. I wish you a happy job and trouble the guests every day.

We hope that guests staying later will avoid room 2201.

No amount of photos can show the beauty of LUX, and we don't feel the same about the online service saying that the service can't keep up. I felt the small ceiling of the afternoon tea (bamboo raft afternoon tea), played in the infinity pool, played billiards, played Go, read a book, and ate the hotel‚Äôs own restaurant (recommended dishes are all online, especially white rice , this taste has never been tasted before), rode a bicycle around the countryside, watched a movie under the stars, watched fireworks, and most importantly, found a drift bottle of LUX‚Äôs reserved item with the children, and exchanged two ice creams.

The hotel looks like it is in a painting, with beautiful scenery, excellent food and beverage products (especially the rice grown by the hotel itself, which is very delicious), and it is worth the money. Most of the customer service staff are locals, which not only solve local employment, but also have local characteristics. All customer service staff are simple and friendly, making people feel at home. Especially Rita at the front desk, when I arrived at the store after a long journey, due to the high occupancy rate that day, I waited until 4:00 to rest at CI, which affected my emotions a bit. Rita was very professional and careful, and introduced the hotel to me on the way to the room. Smiling soothes my emotions. When I ran out of sunscreen and asked if there was a boutique in the hotel, Rita lent me her own sunscreen to keep me warm. The details are quality, fruits are placed everywhere in the hotel for guests to enjoy, and the butler-style service of Jianxiaoqun is easy to contact, answer every question, reply in a timely manner, full of experience, and look forward to the next meeting. highly recommended!

msg:The scenery is online, the service is online, a wonderful resort. It was amazing the first time I came, but when I came for the second time, I felt that the current management team had tampered with the original designer's conception, and the changes were nondescript, which affected the aesthetic feeling.
       The view and landscape of the room are not as beautiful as before. The original designer's idea was to have a panoramic view of the outdoor landscape into the house. There are three windows in the room, like a picture frame, and the scenery from every angle of the outdoors becomes a unique scene into the room. There are many households, but now white screens and heavy beige curtains are added to each window. This beauty was severely damaged abruptly, and the curtains of each window were pushed and pulled left and right, each occupying more than 20 centimeters. The three windows forcibly blocked the scenery with a width of more than one meter, and broke the structure and balance of the entire room.
      The biggest highlight of vacationing in this hotel is the view from the room. If you want to protect your privacy, just lift the original blackout curtain up and down! When the curtains are raised, the scenery is really pleasing to the eye. I really don't understand what is the function of the horizontal screens? The scenery of three window angles is cut vertically and horizontally, which is definitely a waste of the beauty of the artist's design.

The second point is that there is already a round table in a room, and there is no need to add a new round table outside the balcony. When I stayed in the past, the balcony was full of sofas, and a corner was placed on the side, leaving a larger space for activities on the balcony , Art also emphasizes the effect of blank space. As a designer hotel, it is inappropriate to fill up the balcony and tamper with the original designer's style. Hope to improve together!

One is that there are some obvious spider webs on the stairs outside the room. The other is that our room is on the 2nd floor. We saw that there is an elevator, but it is not open. Usually, forget it. The weather was hot these two days, and it was still a bit difficult to climb by myself. Finally, there is the bicycle outside the hotel. The two of us wanted to ride the tandem bicycle that we rode together, but it turned out that there was a charge, because in fact, we didn‚Äôt really want to ride it.

For the first time, they said that the western menu could not be ordered, but another waiter said that they could order it, which was very confusing. The front desk is also the same. I found a few local elder sisters to be in charge, and I moved it by myself when I got off the bus. Many waiters don't know what to ask, and hope to strengthen training.

Environment: The entire resort is located in the depths of Chongzuo, covering a large area, with enough space for tourists to explore. On the way to the hotel, there are also many scenery where you can stop and check in at any time.
Service: I can see the care of the service. I noted that I don‚Äôt eat coriander beef when checking in, and I took care of it when I was eating. It was too late the next day and I didn't go to the restaurant, so I called to ask and help us deliver the meal directly to the room. Welcome fruit and red wine are also prepared in the room, and tremella soup is also included in the evening, as well as many thoughtful details. The overall experience is very good, but as a luxury hotel, the overall service training needs to be improved. You can always hear the waiters chatting loudly, and the restaurant service is a bit chaotic.
Facilities: The room was upgraded for us when we checked in, and the overall check-in experience was very good. Walking in the hotel, fruits and refreshments are prepared in every corner to allow guests to stop and enjoy the beautiful scenery. The only thing is that the material and size of bath towels are slightly worse in this level of hotel. At the same time, many places have posted the words "please contact the front desk if you want to buy... It's really unnecessary, it feels like selling goods."
The overall feeling is a very worthwhile trip, and the experience will be better if the weather is good.

I found that the room we lived in above the swimming pool is the room with the most beautiful view in LUX*!
No wonder I fell in love with this hotel at first sight, no wonder all my friends recommended her to me...

Disposable items are basically made of wood, and the toiletries are Oulong's pomelo fragrance, which smells really good!
P3-10, beautiful view inside the hotel. When I visit the resort in the morning, the waiters I meet will take the initiative to smile and say hello~ Every step in the resort has a different view, each angle has a different beauty, it is recommended to spend most of the day here~ Unfortunately, it was a rainy day when we came, probably It's not the most beautiful time yet, and the time is a bit rushed, too late to appreciate and experience the resort...
P11-P16, located in Detian Waterfall Scenic Area, is a tea room operated by LUXE, with a VIP environment (and no need to climb mountains, it is very suitable for the elderly). You can drink champagne, eat afternoon tea, listen to music, and overlook Detian Waterfall. Such a time is really pleasant...Because it is the dry season, the water flow of the waterfall is not large, otherwise the scene will be very spectacular!
The experience of coming to Lishi this time is really great! If I have a chance, I will think of a second brush to make up for the regret that I didn‚Äôt realize this time~

Guests who sleep on the inside of the big bed have to get up at night and need to go down two big steps and bypass an irregular ellipse The coffee table needs to go up two big steps to enter the bathroom. After going to the bathroom, you have to go through the same steps. It is not safe, and it is easy to disturb people with insomnia. Style; the third is the lack of training of service personnel, whether it is welcoming guests or room service, the image of the personnel is not good, the attitude is relatively indifferent, the expression of Mandarin is not clear, and the taste of dialect is too strong. In particular, the welcome staff in the parking lot suggested improving service initiative and paying attention to image and verbal expression when selecting candidates. Of course, the hotel environment is indeed worthy of the word "secret place", especially the land and rivers in front of the hotel have been requisitioned by the hotel, and a wetland environment has been built. This detail is worthy of appreciation. In addition, the service of the housekeeper Kiki is also very thoughtful and pays attention to details.

msg:Not to mention the environment and service of the hotel, everyone has seen it, and the overall level has been maintained at a consistent level. Staying for a few days, the more important thing is that the hotel manager can understand what people who come to vacation in the city now need. There are many extra services, etc., which are charged, but you feel that it is worth the money. For example, in the VIP tea room in Detian, it is worthwhile to enter the special rest area to eat and drink after playing; there is also a bonfire on the seat of the Starry Sky Bar, have a glass of wine, or BBQ, listen to DJ or watch a show The movie has the feeling of camping. I heard that there will be more activities in spring and summer. In addition, the food and beverage taste of the hotel is also very good.
All in all, it is a place where I think I will come again next time.

msg:The architectural design of the hotel is very good. The space and the scenery are perfectly integrated and complement each other. It is a complete resort style and has good privacy. Some decoration design and facility details in the room can see the shadow of Maldives.
Mention a few deficiencies:
1. The operating capacity appears to be insufficient. For example, there is a large library space by the swimming pool, which has not been used. It is a bit wasteful to be empty (except for books and sofas). There are also spaces such as the wine cellar... The cafe next to the lobby is dark and dark, which is strange. There is no good guidance and space application scenario planning for guests.
2. There are many locals in the hotel service staff. It can be seen that they have received pre-job training, but they must lack experience in the luxury hotel service industry. From the perspective of service awareness and service actions, they are lacking. For example, the service staff warmly smiled and brought us welcome tea, and there were two cups of tea on the tray. We need to wait for our guests to put away the things in their hands and then bring them down and put them on the table. The waiter was there silently watching us with a tray. It's not that I'm hypocritical and I don't want to do it myself. These details cannot withstand horizontal comparison. In my opinion, the service staff is not to blame, because they are all local residents, and they may never have seen any hotel of the same level except LUX. The lack of training, service design and SOP implementation is a management problem.
3. There was a small problem in the maintenance of the facilities in the room I stayed in. I won‚Äôt mention the details. The service responded in a timely manner and the service attitude was also very good. However, the problem is still due to the lack of experience of the service staff and the failure to predict the problem.
There are quite a lot of places that can show that the service details are not in place, so I won‚Äôt talk about it. Usually, I basically don‚Äôt post reviews, and the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of this stay are very contradictory. just sauce

msg:It is the worst experience among hotels of the same price! ! „Äënone of them! Most of the staff are sleepwalking, especially the interns in the restaurant. How is the hotel managed? ? Do those interns know what they are doing? ?
[1] At dinner on January 22, an intern knocked over the lemonade on our table without a word of apology. In the end, regular employees (in different costumes) came to clean up the table. During the same meal, I asked the intern, "The soup in the hot pot is gone, please add some water." After the intern answered, there was no follow-up response for a long time, and an official staff came and said to us, "Add the bottom of the pot 48". Who wants to add the bottom of the pot? ? The three of us have already ordered three pot bottoms, what more pot bottoms should we add? ? Even if you glance at the table, you won't be able to say such a thing. Except for these two things, there was no way to respond to any of our requests. After the interns responded, they either looked confused or slipped away.
[2] On January 23rd, coffee was ordered for breakfast, but the interns forgot about it after listening to it. It took a long time to get the order list for breakfast. At the other tables eating at the same time, there were also residents who were angry because of this.
On the way back to the room after breakfast, I met a male intern in the room depar**ent, who was pushing a cart with towels, and was walking around with a towel. Do you think you are handsome?
Another time, on the way back to the room, I met three or five interns from the housekeeping depar**ent, playing with their mobile phones and laughing together.
At the hotel dinner on the same night, the intern I met was the only one who was normal throughout the whole process.
I am very satisfied with the series of services in the Detian Tea Room on the same day, which is the only satisfactory place in the whole journey.
[3] On January 24th, when I checked out, I was missing an item in the bill, and I was missing the drop-off station after I left the store. After I proposed it on my own initiative, it took another communication to confirm that the hotel had paid for it according to my requirements. I booked the terminus service, but it was half an hour earlier than I requested. Fine.
[Summary] What does the hotel's training/manager do? If you don't want to do it, don't do it. It's the New Year's Eve to exercise the patience of customers, right?

I stayed at this hotel in June 2022, and it was also booked by Ctrip. I should still see my last review of this hotel. At that time, except for the difficulty of communicating with the front desk when checking in (barely within the normal range), the whole trip was wonderful. This is why I arranged this itinerary. Except for the smooth communication with the front desk when I checked in, and the smooth itinerary (housekeeper and driver) at Detian Tea Room, [the whole process was extremely bad].

msg:Finally, I have been looking forward to the long-awaited "Lishi" vacation trip to Chongzuo. It was canceled several times because of the relationship with YQ. This time, I chose 6 days and 5 nights to enjoy the Wonderland! Although it is also due to YQ ~ many scenic spots on the border (such as "Detian Waterfall", etc.) are closed ~ the maintenance of the river near the hotel, the net red bamboo raft afternoon tea can not be experienced; but these will not affect our resort trip this time experience comfort.

The hotel provides paid airport pick-up service (Ôø•1200). Drive from [Nanning Wuxu International Airport] (Wuwei Town, Jiangnan District) to Mingshi Village, Daxin County, Chongzuo City, where [Guangxi Chongzuo Secret Land Resort and Villa] is located. 2.5 hours drive. At present, during the YQ period, nucleic acid is required first after landing at the airport, and nucleic acid is required again when driving to Daxin County for border inspection. After all, the border (China-Vietnam) town must be strictly controlled (during the visit here, nucleic acid is maintained every other day, i.e. Yes, the hotel arranges free nucleic acid testing at the rest area of the 3F elevator every morning from 10-11 am). The hotel also upgraded us to 2 opposite LUX* suites in Building 1, which is convenient for us to visit each other!

The benefits of choosing a 6-day stay are really many ~ the weather changes a lot, first the rain brings a misty wonderland, then the clear sky and the beauty brought by the changing clouds! There are different views to enjoy every day, and the suite's own terrace can sit on the karst landscape.

The purchased accommodation package includes daily champagne breakfast (semi-buffet) ~ free noodles ‚ûï dinner (package) Chinese, Western, Vietnamese, Guangxi style optional ‚ûï food and beverage coupons, etc., the price is very good!

There are also many interesting places in the resort. For example, the hotel butler will publish information on the "Drift Bottle" activity on the public account every morning, look for hidden treasures, and win various benefits for free! Or if you want to be quiet, you can go to the "Yunman Library" by the river; or wait until night falls to watch a movie at the terrace cinema here at Starry Sky Bar, and there will be a sky full of stars waiting for us!

msg:I spent the cleanest birthday here, unforgettable for the rest of my life

Location traffic:
Chongzuo itself is a border city, adjacent to Vietnam. The hotel is about 40 minutes' drive from Detian Waterfall, in a small mountain village. From Nanning Airport, it takes 2 and a half hours to come by car, and 6 hours to come from Guiyang.

Room view and room facilities:
The room is a very large suite, with an outdoor pool, everything in the room, and a quiet reading corner, which I like very much. Sitting outdoors, you can quietly watch the lake and mountains by yourself, which is very comfortable.

Serve:
Butler service, very considerate. Knowing that I am alone, the room arranged is also a quiet corner, and I try my best to meet the requirements for dining in the room. If you meet a waiter anywhere in the hotel, you will have a sincere question mark, and even the boa**an is very enthusiastic. I felt their warmth and simplicity.
The hotel's activities are also very rich, bamboo raft afternoon tea, cycling, handicrafts, outdoor movies, barbecue bars, hiking, etc. However, the hotel's coffee bar does not open until 11 o'clock. Too late.
swimming pool:
The infinity pool is their feature, not constant temperature, but it is still very comfortable to swim in this weather.
Breakfast and other meals:
The breakfast is very rich, and here you can eat all kinds of noodles from Guangxi. The meals at other time periods are also more refined and the prices are more reasonable. Only the meal of the bamboo raft afternoon tea, I personally feel that it is average. After all, the price of 888 is such an afternoon tea, and the voyage is also a bit short, so it means that it is just a photo and punch card, which is not enough to worry about.

Cost-effective:
In general, I am very satisfied and comfortable in all aspects, even if I am alone, it is not abrupt at all. Had an unforgettable birthday here. Thanks again LUX~

The word "secret realm" is quite in line with the location of the hotel. As soon as you enter the lobby, you are attracted by the picture-like scenery in front of you. The layout and soft and hard decoration of the rooms and various areas of the hotel are quite brilliant!
The key is that as a resort hotel, it can meet the needs of us and our children. Swimming, cycling, billiards, chess, movies, bamboo rafts, etc. are all available. Children hardly need our company and can always find their own activities and playmates. , I don't want to go back to my room until I go to sleep!
The inside of the room is actually quite comfortable, spacious, and the scenery is beautiful. It is a place to enjoy going out and not going out!
The a**osphere of the western wine cellar is very good, the bread is very delicious, and the Southeast Asian dishes that are changed the next day are also authentic!

Overall it was a fantastic getaway, can't wait to come back!

We went through various epidemic prevention and border inspections on the highway, and finally arrived at LUXI, which is hidden in the karst landscape and mountains and waters through fields and villages. Vacation hotel. Under the guidance of Mrs. Yingbin, walk through the welcoming corridor with banana trees on both sides, and take the elevator to the hotel lobby. The lobby is very cleverly designed, and the scenery in front of you is like a landscape painting embedded in the hotel building, which is really beautiful. After checking in, the lady at the front desk took us to the room. According to the little sister, the hotel mainly has 7 buildings, the lobby is Building 1, and our room is in Building 2. Probably in the off-season, the lady at the front desk arranged a room with a perfect location for us. Downstairs is the infinity pool. At a glance, there are landscapes and rice fields. Except for the beautiful landscapes, there are no unfinished buildings and incongruous sundries that pollute the vision. It seems like you are in a fairyland. Although the sky is not beautiful, it almost rained on the two days we stayed, but the scenery in the rain also had a different artistic conception. I rushed to the hotel from Nanning Airport all the way. I was a little hungry without having lunch on the way. The lady at the front desk recommended bamboo raft afternoon tea, and we decided to try it. At about 3 o'clock, we got on the bamboo raft to open the champagne, the boa**an paddled the bamboo raft quietly, we looked at the scenery on both sides of the strait, tasted delicious snacks, and spent an unforgettable afternoon. We booked a set meal including breakfast and dinner. Before dinner, the housekeeper who added WeChat in advance asked me how well the beef tenderloin, the main course of the dinner, should be cooked. Of course, we chose 5. Before our meal, we opted for a red wine paired with the pan-fried beef tenderloin, the tenderloin was really well done at 5 medium, and it can be said that the quality and quality of the dinner did not disappoint. During the two days we stayed, because there were not many guests, the buffet style was cancelled for breakfast, and it was changed to a la carte menu. The breakfast is very rich, both Chinese and Western styles can be ordered. We ordered chicken porridge, fish porridge, and Guangxi delicacies snail noodles, old friend noodles, and authentic French croissants and other breads. A table full of food, Looking at the beautiful scenery outside the window and enjoying it slowly, this holiday is really beautiful. I think the food and desserts in the hotel are commendable, and it is worth the trip to enjoy the food in the beautiful secret hotel. The morning we left the hotel, the weather cleared up. After breakfast, we walked around the hotel and found that many facilities were not available in time. If given the chance, I think I will come again.

üîîService: Hotel butler style. The service is particularly good. After check-in, there will be a private dedicated service group. The younger brothers and sisters in various depar**ents are always ready to answer various questions and provide help, and book activities. I also gave me birthday cakes, supper desserts, and I kept feeding them üòÇ very caring
Because 48 hours of nucleic acid are required for the return journey, the hotel specially arranges a free shuttle bus to the county hospital, which is very convenient.

üçÉEnvironment: The environment has nothing to say, the secret hideaway, the room is very spacious, the privacy is good, the bathtub is like a bath, you can watch the stars, capsule coffee and Marshall speakers to meet the small hobbies in the city. The infinity pool is beautiful, but it‚Äôs a pity that there is not enough sunshine in winter and the water temperature is cooler, and it is impossible to enter the water, but it is still a large area.

Activities: There are quite a lot of activities after check-in. There are daily activities to find drifting bottles in the hotel and exchange for small gifts. There are üé£, straw ropes, paintings, stargazing at night, cycling around by bicycles, and movies every night. Activity. There is also a children‚Äôs playroom for those with children. In short, have all the types you want, and even read the book quietly.

I visited Mingshi Garden 6 years ago, and I had a peaceful weekend, but LUXE gave me a surprise that far exceeded my expectations. In the case that the epidemic cannot go abroad, the two-person package is still very cost-effective, and there are only a handful of senior resorts in Southeast Asia that can find services in China. Li Shi Chongzuo definitely counts as one. Highly recommendedüíï

After staying at LuX for 2 nights this time, Johnny specially arranged a room with a superb view. Looking out from the window, the swimming pool and the landscape blend together. The whole scenery, the hotel is not only good hardware environment, but also very good service. After each meal, the restaurant supervisor will ask the diners how they feel. The first meal in Lux was steak. When I asked for the steak to be a little older, the restaurant To apologize, I sent delicious pineapple fried rice and a fruit platter to the room. The snail noodles, pho and xiaolongbao for breakfast were also delicious. The room attendant provided drinks and snacks in the refrigerator at any time, before leaving. At that time, the front desk also offered to ask you not to leave early, you can check out late. If you don't want to rush to the next trip, I really want to stay in the hotel for an extra afternoon. In short, the Lux trip left a good memory of travel. The hotel facilities are very complete, with a starry sky cinema, study room, game hall, and children's playground, suitable for families and couples.

msg:It might be better not to have high expectations. The price doesn't match up with some things. The photo spots of Internet celebrities are really good-looking, but they don't post them anymore, and they say something bad. Duplex, package, see pictures for details. There are no special items in the Ctrip package, there is no mention of decoration, even if I go to the official wx, there is no explanation. Even if there is no checkin, the first meal details in the picture are given during checkin. The maintenance notice in the second picture can only be seen at the bed position on the second floor of the duplex building. This led to the peripheral decoration of the breakfast restaurant, and the curtains of the bed were pulled throughout. The Starry Sky Bar was originally a meal in the set menu. The hotel created the original flavor of dining under the starry sky. Then, it's decoration. In the end, all meals are in one restaurant for three days and two nights. From Ctrip booking to successful booking (successful booking means non-refundable), and then to my birthday request to contact the headquarters in advance by email, the headquarters forwarded the email to the hotel, and the interior communication did not inform the decoration information in advance. It was not until the review that I found out that the butler ticket circle informed that the gym was unavailable. From the addition of a butler to the checkin, the drift bottle has not introduced what it is. 2. Do not fly drones, bring your own anti-mosquito products, etc. Please write it on the booking page and supervise it, because on the day I checked in, I heard that there was a bee, who knew there was a drone, and it was on my second floor. Fortunately, I just watched from the balcony on the first floor. It is said that privacy is important, guests who do not stay in the hotel cannot enter the gate, and the hotel design is that there is no door in the toilet, and there is a large balcony facing no one. 3. Catering, ipad price 800set meal, the experience is not enough a**osphere. Not enough local features. Dinner was not as good as breakfast. It was not told that if the set meal does not meet the taste, you can order more in the price and then make up. The order of serving needs to be improved. On the bread, Tom Yum Goong soup, and then a big bowl of Vietnamese soup and pho... 4, TV, not for the housekeeper, the housekeeper is only in accordance with the regulations, cable TV is no longer popular for young people, but it is fine, at least the remote control of Samsung TV The device has to be equipped in the room, the TV can be projected, but it is not given because I am afraid that the guests will not change the signal source and adjust the wrong channel? The guests who can ask for the original remote control and have already answered that they are not sure which device to use to cast the screen will not be the guests who know nothing, right? Should the customer service be responsible for holding the remote control to help me cast the screen? So does adjusting the volume also require the customer service to hold the remote control? Has he been sticking beside the bed (no TV on the first floor of the duplex, bed and TV on the second floor)? Is it reasonable? Even if the signal source may be wrongly pressed by a guest, it is not difficult to print a user manual. The hotel is really heartbroken in this regard. On the contrary, the wifi that was too slow to cry, with a speed measurement of only more than 80 megabits was too weak to be tolerated, and did not focus on processing. The whole hotel is slow, public dining and rooms are slow. Sometimes it breaks. That small degree, when playing a song, there is always a line and a pause. For 3 days, I ran my own mobile phone traffic. The socket is also a problem. The sockets on the first floor are pitiful, and the old-fashioned five holes have no U ports, so they are not misplaced. There are a lot of equipment, this one has to climb the second floor to charge, there is a u port 2.1A on the second floor. There is no phone on the first floor, only on the second floor. 5. The design of the hot water knob of the washbasin faucet is very difficult to solve. It must be adjusted to a reasonable temperature and the water volume is large enough to wet the whole body. Toiletries and hand washing products are poorly branded. Bathrobes and slippers in general. Balcony chair cushions moldy. The matches can't be struck either. 6. The free hotel bicycles are outdated and the brakes are average. It's not as good as the new bicycles that the staff put downstairs. 7. The instructions for self-driving guests are not clear after entering the gate, because the parking lot will arrive first and then the reception entrance. We thought we would wait in the parking lot, but who knew we had to drive to the cabin, unload our luggage, drive to the parking lot to park, then walk over to the cabin, and then perform a simple welcome ceremony. To sum up, it is lower than expected, after all, other reviews are written too high. I ran into it all bad? There are many repairs, the entertainment for adults is not enough, and the birthday cake given is very beautiful, but the room layout, I don't know if I understand it wrong, the love towel on the bed like the swan and the elephant on the wedding anniversary. . Banyan Tree will spread HAPPY BIRTHDAY with leaves and roses. Advantages, the most praised by the night cat is the breakfast until 11 o'clock. It can be seen that Ctrip's previous bad reviews have improved. But the staff uniforms are really not good looking. At checkin, I sat and drank ginger soup, and the front desk squatted next to me with the confirmation sheet to explain. But authentication still needs to stand in the foreground. Every hotel customer service is very polite. The environment is good, the hotel design is good, but the software and catering and system management need to be strengthened.

msg:I booked LUX half a year in advance and brought my parents to experience this newly opened wild luxury hotel that has been established for a long time and allows you to "live in the scenery". The locals call it a "secret place" rather than its brand. "Luxe" is indeed a "secret place". The most amazing moment is when you get off the bus. The local aunt Cindy in ethnic costumes hangs a welcome hydrangea for you. As she walks through a sugar cane forest and enters the stone wood After seeing the structural house and traditional skills display, you then pass through a long and narrow plank road of banana trees, take the elevator directly to the lobby on the second floor, and you will see a huge real-life dark green "landscape painting" in front of you, it is so beautiful! I especially admire LUX's ingenuity in environmental design, which allows guests to have a very good secret experience from the moment they step into the hotel door. Manager James Chen at the front desk has very good service, is thoughtful and professional, and can respond to guests' needs in a timely manner. Other service staff are also very kind and will take the initiative to say hello to guests when they see them. My parents were very satisfied with the hotel's view and room. The most interesting experience is riding the bicycles provided by the hotel for free on the nearby cycling routes. Although it is a bit sunny, the warm wind blows and it feels good to ride in the deserted countryside surrounded by mountains. !

The service staff are all from the local village. Very simple and honest. Although there is room for improvement. For example, room service delivery is a bit slow, but it‚Äôs good to be able to do this soon after opening.
Manager Chen in the lobby lobby is good. There were some minor problems during check-in. Finally, Manager Chen coordinated and dealt with it and sent an afternoon tea very enthusiastically. Later, he also helped us to book a car and arrange airport transfers, etc.
The hotel also offers a lot of activities, so you won‚Äôt be bored every day. There are also Mingshi Garden and Detian Waterfall Scenic Spots. You can also go for a walk.
Overall it is worth coming for a holiday and leisure travel. There are no disadvantages except for being expensive. It is worth coming again.

What a strange place name, I found out that it was close to Detian Transnational Waterfall when I looked it up on the map. I have been longing for it. This time I drove to Hainan to take a special detour to experience the Chongzuo LUXE Resort. When you enter the hotel parking lot, there are enthusiastic waiters. We greet and arrange luggage directly to the room. I especially like the plantain promenade at the entrance to the hotel. I also specially recorded a video (posted to the circle of friends and asked where it is? Such a charming place). Entering the lobby makes people‚Äôs eyes brighter. , The spacious and somewhat exotic lobby side is greeted by the pastoral scenery of Mingshi River. It is so beautiful. The room I lived in is very large. You can enjoy the tropical rain forest outside the terrace by lying on the extra-large bed. Breakfast and dinner are tasteful and delicious. Swimming in the hotel's infinity pool is even more enjoyable. The staff are all courteous and welcoming. But there are also shortcomings: the lunch time of Bamboo Pai is too short, I hope to do better, will recommend it to friends and will come again.

msg:I have always planted this LUX because I have an obsession with this brand. Maybe LUX is not very famous in China, but it is actually a representative of high-luxury hotels overseas. The year before last, I went to the Maldives and compared a lot of islands. Finally, I chose the island of LUX. Stars also visited LUX‚Äôs service and design sense at that moment. I was very impressed. I stayed in many hotels in China. This LUX in Guangxi can be described as high luxury.
The first is the location, the privacy is strong. Although there are more roads, the mountains and rivers accompany you all the way. When you arrive at the hotel, you will be surprised by the location of the hotel. It is not like Yangshuo, which gives people a sense of business and crowds. A good place for meditation;
The second is the design sense of the hotel, which continues the modern, original and high-end design with a little bit of Vietnamese characteristics, especially the rectangular frame in the lobby, which is like a famous landscape painting frame. The interior design of the hotel room is also modern. Some careful thoughts
The third is the service of the hotel. The butler service is very considerate and is basically on call. I can satisfy everything I want. Whether it is room selection or some special needs for personal reasons, I will try my best to satisfy the service staff who will meet you Take the initiative to smile and say hello, it will make you feel the feeling of being cared for and taken care of all the time
The last thing is the hotel‚Äôs dining. I tasted breakfast, Chinese restaurant, Western restaurant and starry sky bar. They were all distinctive and not very flavorful, and the taste was good. By the way, I also experienced the bamboo raft afternoon tea and the evening self-barbecue at the hotel. Festive a**osphere
The last time I saw the long-lost fireworks here, I am very happy!

msg:The hotel likes it so much, the actual experience is more beautiful than looking at the guide photos! It is the only hotel in China that has a sense of foreign vacation experience. The hotel staff are well-trained and have a friendly attitude. Everyone will greet guests when they see them. The room is highly intelligent and convenient. It is generous to provide drinks, snacks, instant noodles and fruits! Both breakfast and Chinese food in the hotel restaurant are delicious, with large portions and delicious flavors. The hotel details are very good. For example, the air-conditioning in the elevator is very cool, and many homemade mosquito repellents are given to guests at any time. There is a starry sky cinema at night, and the effect of watching movies in the open air is great. Be sure to experience the special cycling routes around the hotel. Will come again and would highly recommend it to friends! I hope the hotel can maintain the same quality.

msg:The first resort hotel opened by Radisson Hotel in China is really too embarrassing. It is very close to Vietnam. There is a border checkpoint on the way to the hotel, next to the Mingshi Tianyuan Scenic Area. The site selection is true. Not bad üëç Needless to say, the design of the hotel is low-key, simple and luxurious. The hotel entrance is greeted by the unique hydrangea in Guangxi. The front desk of the hotel is also very suitable for taking pictures. The room for us is the room with the hotel's promotional map. The scenery is really invincible. It‚Äôs really a paradise, everything is in the picture, and the scenery doesn‚Äôt need filters

msg:As soon as they arrived at the door of the hotel, they were greeted by aunts from the strong family and greeted by singers with folk songs, which made the Nanning people feel the feeling of coming home.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel room is also quite big, and the environmental facilities are No.1. At night, the starry sky cinema is very beautiful, you can see the stars in the sky, lying on the tatami, it is very enjoyable, and when you go back to the room and pass the pool, it is also very beautiful! A dream like a pool full of stars‚ú®.
üîîService: There is also that thoughtful and complete round-the-clock service. We have a lot of luggage. As soon as the car arrives at the door, the luggage is arranged in the room. The bath water should have negative ions, and the water is soft and comfortable! Super refreshing!

I am also very grateful to Manager Chen for his warm reception ü§ùü§ùü§ù, he will remind him of the meal time intimately. As soon as he checked in, he said, "Then you can call me 24 oncall at any time." Help appears right away üåπ Sunglasses fall in the pool, and they can be quickly found and sent out, doing things efficiently! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

msg:The hotel is so beautiful, very quiet and comfortable, and the service is very attentive. Now that you can't go anywhere in the epidemic, it is really rare to have such a good resort hotel in Guangxi. It is recommended that you can arrange more leisure activities, such as getting a mini zoo to raise some alpaca bunny or something, and those with children will like it very much. The only downside is that the uniforms of the employees are not very good-looking. I hope to do better! National Day will come again!

msg:My lover chose to go to LUXE on her birthday. Just stepping into LUXE, I was amazed by the huge movie-like wonderland in the lobby. The hotel housekeeper Johnny was very enthusiastic and caring. He prepared birthday cakes and room decorations for the lover. The room view is so beautiful. Photos No matter how you shoot, it is beautiful. Every detail reflects the world-class ability of the hotel designer. Breakfast and dinner are served in the restaurant. The level is completely on the first-class line. It is worth recommending. The hotel staff speak softly and softly, which really makes people feel the luxury and lightness of the hotel. It is very comfortable, so we did not choose to stay in the hotel at the scenic spot. Thank the hotel for bringing us a good memory and experience, next time Will come to stay.

msg:I booked the LUXE Suite a long time ago, and I was very satisfied. On the day before I left, I was lucky to find a drift bottle and delivered ice cream. I really liked this idea for finding a drift bottle. In addition to the scenery, the food at the hotel is also super delicious, the breakfast is great, and the steak is also good. It is worth mentioning that the manager at the front desk of the hotel Pu is very enthusiastic. Everything is customer-oriented, attentive and considerate, and he will share his own experiences. It feels like a vacation with us. Like it.

Also, the transportation cost is too high. The round-trip fare is 3,000 and it is a bit expensive. I hope the hotel can be improved! Others are very good, will recommend friends!

msg:First-class environment! You can see such a beautiful view in the room, which is not available in other hotels. The resort is full of beautiful views and the design is excellent. It is worthy of the work of a Spanish master. Meals are also good, whether breakfast or dinner. It would be better if there were more dishes with local characteristics! The infinity pool experience is great! The service is not bad, and the response speed can be improved. The strange thing is that the BMW logo that can be seen everywhere in the hotel spoils the scenery, which is a bit off the appetite. I don't know if this is the Cosmo Hotel or the BMW Hotel. Even if the boss has a relationship with BMW, he must pay attention to this problem. The feelings to the customers are the first thing, not the adverti*****t.

It was very uncomfortable to ask if I could adjust the front desk, and the attitude was very bad. I booked the bamboo raft and said that I would contact you in advance the next day, because there was a light rain and no one noticed, let alone the so-called butler service. From the time I made the reservation to the departure, I didn‚Äôt see where the butler was. In general, this The price is not worth it!

It is a pity that some facilities such as spas and shopping stores are still under construction, and I look forward to experiencing them next time I visit.

msg:Bad review, the hotel is deceptive. I booked a suite. When I arrived at the hotel, I asked the front desk if it included bamboo raft afternoon tea. I asked twice, they said yes, but I checked out today and charged me 888 afternoon tea separately. The cost is not about the money. The key is that it is not included if it is not included. Tell me clearly, this kind of deception is bad! The butler also pushed hard for the blame
