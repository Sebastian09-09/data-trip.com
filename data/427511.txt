*****************************
Good day Sir/Mdm,

I have an excellent and enjoyable 15th Wedding Anniversary stay in Executive Suite (King- bed) at Hilton Zhongshan from 1 Dec-2 Dec. Services provided by the staffs were outstanding. Everything was smooth from check in, during stay and check out. I would like to compliment the following staffs for their wonderful service provided by them. Names are shown indicated as below; I definitely will come back here to celebrate our wedding anniversary at this hotel again next year. I would like to sincerely thank you to all the staffs in Zhongshan Hilton especially the guest service manager, front counter, executive lounge and housekeeping for making our stay an enjoyable experience. Thanks and regards.

Staff Name: 
黄一敏 | Chloe Huang
宾客服务经理 I Guest Service Manager

Service provided:
• Arrange an romantic Executive Suite for our wedding anniversary celebration on 1 Dec
• Appreciate the effort to do decoration for our room to make our special day.

Staff Name: 
吉婷 | Kate Ji
Executive Lounge officer

Service provided:
• Warm welcome us to our seats with patience and courtesy 
• Ensure drinks are served promptly and appropriately.

Suggestions:
• It would be good if both televisions are replaced with the better ones as I could see intermittent distortion on screen (lose connection intermittently when watching)

Best Regards,
Eric Ng

I checked in hotel at the same time a big conference group in front of me and waited quite long to complete the process.  The front desk was so nice to upgrade me to a biz suite, which has 4 time normal room size.  I was stunned but did not have enough time to enjoy the facility.

The room is invincible, with a large bathtub, and a mountain view on the high floor. I want to give a special praise to the quilt, which is very comfortable. It is the most comfortable quilt I have ever had in so many hotels. It is thin down, not stuffy or hot, and light and soft. The quilts in many hotels are either thick or heavy, which is uncomfortable, but the one in this hotel is really comfortable, at least it is suitable for summer.

The service attitude is very good. The whole building is very high. You can go up to the top floor 60 to check in. It should be the tallest building in Zhongshan. The swimming pool opens at 6:30 in the morning. There are many high-altitude restaurants on the 50th floor, which is suitable for couples.

msg:This is the worst experience I've ever had staying in a five-star hotel in the world, bar none: I went to Zhongshan to collect a room during the holiday, and spent an afternoon there. I didn't want to rush back, so I searched for the most expensive five-star hotel in Zhongshan city directly, and there was no guide.

As soon as I entered the room, there was a stale musty smell. I upgraded to a deluxe room before, and all four windows were sealed with glass glue. There was no limiter, and there was no natural ventilation. The minimum wind speed of the central air conditioner was also very strong, blowing directly at the bed, and I felt that the oxygen supply was insufficient when sleeping. The air in the corridor was fresher than the room. When you walked to the corridor and came back, you could feel the feeling of a room full of water vapor mixed with musty smell. In the morning, you could only open the door for ventilation... unheard of

We forgot to bring earplugs, OK Hotel did not provide them. We ordered takeout, but they didn't let it be delivered. There was no robot, and the room service said "We don't provide this service." What?

The small refrigerator in the room was closed, and the small card inside told you that you needed to call the customer service number, and there would be instructions to tell you how to open it? ? What?

The carpet already had a lot of spots.

I dare not choose this brand in the future. Who will serve whom? Choose a hotel as a father? Completely blacklisted. The only one I can advise is one.

It takes about 20 minutes to walk back to the hotel from Fengyuan Pedestrian Street and Zhongshan Museum. When the weather is good, you can take a city walk and eat and drink near the hotel. It's so pleasant😌
The air conditioning of the executive king room we stayed in this time is very powerful, and the sanitary conditions of the washing area are good. The entrance carpet is a little dirty, but it doesn't affect it because you don't walk barefoot. The view is not bad, and you can see most of the city scenery of Zhongshan from a distance. It's a pity that the weather has not been good these days, otherwise the view outside the window and the observation deck will definitely be better.
The only drawback is that the use of the room facilities is not stable, the faucet can't produce hot water♨ and there was a power outage. Fortunately, the staff responded immediately and helped us solve the problem quickly. The pillows that needed to be replaced were also delivered quickly, and the service attitude was very good, nothing to pick.

Although the hotel is old, the overall cleanliness and maintenance of both the lobby and the guest rooms are very high.
The front desk and concierge services are very good, especially Xiao Lin at the front desk. He is friendly and professional in introducing the hotel group's membership system and benefits. Zhong You helped us upgrade the guest room. The room is on the 40th floor with a sweeping view of the city and a large window. Bathtub, very comfortable. The only thing is that the wind was too strong at night and there was strange noise from the window. It frightened me to sleep at night, so I had to get up and continue sleeping silently.
Will stay here again next time I go to Zhongshan!

After an hour, the front desk called to change the two rooms to another floor.
Overall, I am satisfied with the hotel. However, there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of equipment, because the facilities are also relatively old, and the manpower arrangements are not as fast and in place as those of ordinary new hotels.

msg:I was disappointed as much as I expected. The price of a luxury hotel and the service of an average hotel. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed.
You have to wait more than ten minutes to check in at night. The most surprising thing is that the bathroom in the lobby is limited 🙂↕️🙂↕️! It can't be used without a key card. . . In such a big five-star hotel, it feels a bit stingy to have such trouble to use the restroom 🤷🏻♀️.
The concierge guy greeted me proactively when I checked in, but he just helped me store my luggage. Can't help send luggage to the room. . . I don't mean to ask for a nice attitude at the front desk, but it's too speechless to not have a single smiling face. There was not a single smile during the entire check-in process. For me who paid a little more to experience it, it was really disappointing. . .
It’s not good to finish talking.
What I like: The room is comfortable and the space is large enough. The hotel also meets the room requirements. It would be nice to have an extra box of tissues on the bedside table/desk. There are paper towels in the entire room except the toilet and sink. It's not available anywhere else, which is a bit inconvenient. I have to praise the housekeeping attendant. He rang the doorbell at around 10 o'clock in the morning and asked if I needed laundry (it was actually a ward check). When I said I would come back for cleaning in the afternoon, he took the initiative to suggest me to turn on the do not disturb light. I think it is because I am afraid that I will be disturbed by other colleagues.
Based on the entire stay experience, I feel that there are many areas that can be improved.

1) The panoramic room is bigger, but the view is really poor. It is not recommended to spend more than 100 yuan.
2) There is a shopping mall next to it, so there is really no need to buy breakfast.
The most important thing is that the breakfast is really not worthy of the title of a 5-star hotel. Although at first glance it looks like there are both Chinese and Western food, the taste and appearance make you lose your appetite.
The attitude of the service staff was okay, but it felt like they were put on the job without any training, which was weird.

The location is okay, the equipment is okay, the bed in the room I stayed in was in the middle, and the sleep quality was average. Except for the design of the panoramic room, which is a bit awkward, the rest is okay.

msg:You really made the right choice to stay at the Zhongshan Lihe Hilton Hotel during this Spring Festival trip! ￼The luxurious and majestic appearance is eye-catching enough. Brother Xiaolin who checked in at the lobby was so polite and even helped me upgrade my room. This is really great for families with children! We stayed in a panoramic deluxe double room. It was really big. The layout of the room was in the style of a five-star luxury hotel. The bathroom was the highlight. The dry and wet areas were separated. The two side-by-side wash basins met the needs of family members using the bathroom at the same time. The highlight was also There is a large bathtub, which is round. We usually don’t bathe in hotels, so we actually bathed for two nights in a row. After bathing, we felt extremely comfortable! Not to mention hygiene, it fully meets the standards of a five-star hotel. I will still choose this place next time I come to Zhongshan. Although it is a bit more expensive, this kind of experience and service is not something that ordinary hotels can enjoy.

msg:I book this hotel every time I come to Shiqi, Zhongshan. It has complete facilities, unparalleled views, a bathtub in every room, and the beds are moderately soft and hard.
The rooftop on the highest floor is open to housing users, where they can enjoy the breeze and overlook the night view of the city.
Below is the shopping mall, where you can eat, drink and have fun.
The only flaw is that the waiting time for check-in is too long. The room is not available until 4pm and check-out is at 12pm the next day. The lady at the hotel front desk gave me a box of small gifts as an apology. There are also welcome fruits during the Chinese New Year.

msg:The room is compact, the facilities are poor, and the hygiene is also poor! First, the place where bath towels are placed in the bathroom is under the wash basin. It is very narrow and feels unhygienic. There is no place to put the used bath towels and towels, so I have to put them behind the unused bath towels. As a result, the aunt who was doing hygiene on the first day forgot. It was taken away and I felt very bad; secondly, on the first day I checked in, someone's used bathrobe was left in the closet, and the cleaning lady didn't clean it, which felt very unhygienic; thirdly, there was no place to hang clothes in the bathroom. You have to ***** naked to take a shower, which is very inhumane; fourth, the air conditioner in the room cannot be adjusted, and it basically depends on luck. It is too hot to lift the quilt at night, and it is cold during the day to find clothes. I don’t know who is in control; fourth, I stayed for two days in a row. As a result, I went back at around nine o'clock the next night and the room card was invalid and could not be used. I took BB and waited at the door for more than ten minutes before he came to help open the door. BB kept making trouble. First of all, the room card should have expired (I was staying consecutively, not continuing). (Stay), after the failure, the service could not keep up. There are eight elevators in the hotel. I don’t believe you even if you say you have to wait for the elevator. As a five-star hotel, this kind of supporting facilities and service levels cannot keep up with the times. Although the location of the hotel is not bad, the facilities are a bit old (it took too long to open). I was attracted by this at the beginning, but It still disappoints me. I will neither stay at this hotel nor recommend this hotel to my friends and family when I come to Zhongshan in the future.
In addition, the corridor lighting in this hotel is too dark. If the hotel is renovated, it is recommended to brighten the lighting.

It was a bit surprising that there were no wine glasses in the room, so I had to call customer service to get them, but there might have been a lot of guests that night, so it took almost an hour for them to be delivered.

The bathroom is very beautiful, but the curtain remote control is broken and needs to be repaired by maintenance personnel.

However, when they went up, they were stopped by the staff at the transfer area on the 57th floor to collect tickets. Later, they were asked to contact the hotel manager. This I was led up by the manager. After taking a look, I immediately came down and refused to participate. I was angry. Second: There is a hygiene problem in the bathtub. I don’t know if it’s because the guests don’t use it very much or for some other reason. There are hairs on the wall of the bathtub and small bugs on the bottom of the bathtub. Don’t the cleaning staff usually clean the bathtub? Third: The ceiling shower head and bathtub shower head are leaking.
Advantages: The front desk staff are very enthusiastic and can provide guidance.
Summary: To be honest, I am a bit disappointed. The experience is really disappointing for this star rating and brand.

If there is a toilet, it must also be equipped with a child's toilet board. Children must be supported by an adult when going to the toilet, which is very inconvenient! !
However, the hotel service is very good. I am most satisfied with the reception staff at the door. Everyone is very nice, proactive and helpful. It is worth adding chicken drumsticks!

The 50th floor has a wide view, the room is well soundproofed, clean and tidy; the hotel is located in the business district, and there are many dining options downstairs. It's not far from residential areas, so you can feel the local street characteristics and taste local food.

When I checked in, the front desk knew my birthday, so I could go to the executive corridor to eat first, and then they quickly went to decorate the room, gave me a little surprise, and even sent a cake in the evening. Give it to me the next day, and you can check out at two o'clock, so the surprises along the way feel very good!
And there is an online celebrity check-in point on the top floor, which overlooks Zhongshan. The Qing Bar on the 59th floor has billiards and resident singing. The experience is especially their swimming pool. There are swimming pools for adults and children. There is also a hot pool in which you can play for two hours! It is worthy of being the Top 1 hotel of luxury hotels in Zhongshan!

msg:I have stayed in many Hiltons, and it is not the first time that a deluxe double room has been upgraded to an executive suite. Let me see that the upgraded executive suite is only mediocre! Let me talk about the facilities first: the things in the dining cabinet are empty for Hilton. There is a socket next to the kettle and the base, but the dining cabinet is too high to be used at all. The bedside tables on both sides are charging my mobile phone. In the end, I was I took it to the desk to boil water (I thought I would take it to the sink to refill it), and the towel cotton on the teacup has a lot of scratches (the scratches were not photographed), and this old employee should also retire. Let’s talk about the service: I called the housekeeping depar**ent at 7:30 in the morning to ask for a large towel to be brought up. After waiting for 15 minutes, I continued to sleep. I was woken up by a knock on the door at 10:00, thinking that the towel had finally arrived. , fell into a drowsy sleep, and staggered to open the door. It turned out that the staff asked me if I plan to stay longer today and when to check out. The room did not send towels up. When it comes to check-out, because in the past, the hotel did not charge a deposit for fast check-out. This time I almost did the same thing. I suddenly remembered the deposit and went to the front desk to check out. The front desk told me to return it in the same way within 1-3 hours. I checked out the room at 11 o'clock in the afternoon. After dinner, I called the hotel and asked for a reminder before returning it. Later, the hotel called me and said to send a text message to my mobile phone, next time I come to give me a free upgrade to a higher room type, I refused, so there is no need!

I booked a 40-square-meter room and was very happy to be upgraded to a 60-square-meter room for free. The round bathtub is great to watch the night view while soaking! ! Very good staying experience! !

msg:This time I checked into a hotel in a relatively central area of Zhongshan and booked an executive room. There was no wine in the executive lounge 😅😅, so I had to go to the 59th floor to drink. There is a shopping mall downstairs in the hotel. Children especially like it. Shopping is super convenient! The hotel is not very new, it feels a bit old, and it is not comfortable to live in! Only a little takeaway can’t go upstairs. The waiter also said that it’s because of the privacy relationship, so he’s convinced. It’s the first time I’ve lived in so many hotels. Now many 5-star hotels have robots to deliver meals. Why can’t expensive hotels have them? ?

I understand that, but I knew the parking lot was very winding and I was impatient to give directions. So I casually said to turn to the sign in front and told me to leave quickly. Is this service not as good as Home Inn? The front desk also had a general attitude. Especially when I checked out of the room the next day and wanted to use the restroom, when I went to the gym, I was asked if I was a resident. That suspicious look, what kind of attitude was that? When the facilities are already very old, shouldn't they provide better services? I have stayed in five-star hotels in so many cities, and this is one of the worse ones. I suggest you give it a good training.

msg:This time I stayed at the Hilton with expectations. After all, the Zhongshan Hilton is also the benchmark for Zhongshan hotels. We booked a princess fantasy themed parent-child room. We arrived at the lobby and checked in. The guy at the front desk said that the room had been cleaned. We went up to the room and the door was open. At first we thought we had gone to the wrong door. But the master said that the toilet light was broken and he was repairing it. The master kept saying sorry to us. . Originally, we were tired after driving here and wanted to take a rest. After waiting for a long time, the repair was still not completed, so we had to ask the master to stop repairing it. We had to go out in a hurry. Go back to the hotel and get ready for bed at night, oh my god! The bed was full of musty smell, and the air conditioner kept buzzing loudly. Even turning the switch was useless! I couldn't fall asleep after tossing and turning, and I fell asleep after being too sleepy around 2 a.m. Almost all the sockets in the room have problems and cannot be charged. In addition, the parking lot in front of the hotel is even more outrageous. When checking in during the day, the security guard enthusiastically said that parking was not allowed during the day when someone was holding a wedding, but that it was OK at night. As a result, when I went back in the evening, there were many spots in the parking lot at the entrance. The security guard made a 360-degree turn and blocked the car from parking. After arguing with him for a long time, I heard what he wanted and only the leader could park the car on the ground. If you are not convinced, you can complain to me! We talked for about 10 minutes, and finally, under the verbal threats from the security guard, I had no choice but to drive to the ba*****t again in the middle of the night. By the way, I asked the security guy if there are any charging stations near the hotel? Brother, let me tell you, I don’t know! Check the navigation yourself! I was very surprised! Is this what Hilton Group calls service and quality? This is the worst time I have ever stayed at a Hilton. It can be said that there is no worst, only worse! The facilities and services are extremely poor. I will definitely not choose Hilton again next time!

I couldn't open the window and had to turn on the air conditioner. The child caught a cold when he kicked the quilt while sleeping. When I checked in, I called for the bed cover, but it was not delivered very late, and I called again to ask that it was used up, and I was so angry. There are no tables and chairs in the room when another lathe is placed, and the place to store luggage is small. The lights were dim. There are few varieties of breakfast, and the coffee machine does not have latte cappuccino options. I have stayed in so many hotels and think this is the least favorite, and I don’t want to have it again.

The hotel environment is tall and full of fashion and pride. The girl at the front desk is beautiful and nice. She upgraded to the executive double room for free and gave welcome fruit as a gift. I was moved and heart-warming. The first impression upon check-in was good. The executive double room on the 50th floor is luxurious and oversized, and each functional area is very spacious. The facilities are complete and modern, the curtains are electric, and the bathtub is large and round. Dining is very convenient. The Chinese restaurant is on the 5th floor, and the dishes taste good. The breakfast is on the 3rd floor. The environment is good, the service is good, and there are many varieties of Chinese and Western styles. The hotel's cafeteria is very friendly to the elderly, and seniors over 65 years old enjoy a 50% discount. The seafood is rich, the grilled oysters are huge and fat, and the price is super high. Hilton is the first choice for hotels in Zhongshan.

The front desk staff helped us upgrade the room type to the executive floor on the 47th floor, but the hotel room is old and there are many signs of tatters, such as the corners of the wall, the shower curtain card cannot fall... And the room feels very long No one lives and no cleaning, there is dust in many places, the sink faucet is tight and so on.

msg:This parent-child trip stayed in an executive room. The executive room is about 60 square meters larger than the deluxe room. The layout of the room is very spacious. It is divided into two by the TV background wall. The hygiene of the room is not picky. The most satisfied is the design of the bathtub, which covers the scenery of Zhongshan. Happy hour menus are also abundant. Finally, I would like to thank Eggasy, the duty manager of the front office, for receiving Ocean Skyler at the front desk, and the concierge Donnie, who brought me an umbrella in the rain. This is a good hotel for family travel and it is worth recommending.

Take the child to live in the room on the 42nd floor, the view is very good, the room has a big mattress, quilt, and pillows are more comfortable. The top floor of the hotel's 60th floor is open for viewing, overlooking the entire city. The only thing I'm not satisfied with is the breakfast, not much variety and average taste.

The most impressive thing is that the attitude and courtesy of the staff are very good. From the moment of check-in, the staff at the front desk have been very efficient and courteous. The presented fruit even walked to my side and handed it to me. After arriving in the room, I called the service because I needed a red wine glass, a bottle opener, etc. The center is now, the operator is also very polite and patient to repeat the required items, and the employees who deliver the items are also smiling; during the stay, I took the elevator up and down the stairs many times, and encountered all the employees (including employees with different uniforms in different depar**ents) during the stay. ) will greet you politely, and take the initiative to let guests go in and out of the elevator; when checking out, the front desk staff will also warmly remind the time to leave the venue after the parking fee is waived. .
Personally, I really like staying in hotels where the staff are very polite.

What can be improved: The ground is slightly stained when the door is opened to enter the room. Although it is not serious, I hope the hotel can pay attention to it. In addition, it will be more professional if there is a tray when the room service delivers the required items.

The overall experience is still good.

1. The decoration is outdated. Not to mention the dim lights, the yellow and dirty carpets, and the glass glue and floor joints in the bathroom are old enough to change color. The most frightening thing is that the sockets have become loose and deformed, and I worry about safety risks all night.
2. Sanitation is worrying. There is no picture, there is no truth, everyone click on the picture to see. Indoors, even if the sheets and quilts have holes in them, there are still stains. The dust of the drawer, the stains of the TV station, the inexplicable crumbs in the menu, really please take care of it.
3. Backward supporting facilities. Many new small hotels are already very smart. They still deliver things manually. Although the attitude is very good, it is really not necessary.
4. Breakfast is not included. I saw that it generally does not include breakfast, and the included is only one, then it is better not to provide it.
To be honest, Atour is better than here.

msg:Poor service attitude, will never stay in this hotel again! A 5.5-meter commercial vehicle actually made the security guard in the hotel lobby "play" three times: the first time, I told the hotel that there was no parking space, because there was a car behind it and honked its horn (it should be after Didi has delivered the guests and waited to leave) , I had to drive away after I could not get a reply from the security guard for parking in three minutes; the second time, the car drove off the avenue, turned twice, and took six minutes to return to the entrance of the lobby. The security guard handed me an underground parking lot. The road map, I also told my brother at the time that my car is five and a half meters long, can it stop? Is there a dedicated hotel parking space? (It's not my first time staying at Leigh and Hilton) The security guy said go ahead and can find a location. According to this, drive out of the avenue, turn right at 150 meters, and follow the convoy down to the parking lot on the first floor (on the Dragon Boat Festival, the hotel's ground floor area A is connected with the Lihe Plaza shopping mall), there is no parking space in the A area, and the parking space is again It's small and short, I can't stop the Mercedes-Benz commercial car at all. When I'm angry and tired, I call my wife to contact the front desk of the hotel. Maybe the front desk heard me talking in a loud voice, and urgently informs the lobby manager to contact the security at the door, usually within five minutes. After the negotiation, I was told to drive up to the first floor, and the security gave up the reserved parking space on the ground. The third time I was tricked: It took me 27 minutes to go through two times. I drove the commercial car to the ground floor to reserve a parking space. An old security guard came up and asked if I was a temporary parking lot or a hotel guest? when are we leaving? I was so angry that I asked if I could park the car? ? After I parked the car, I told the old security guard to follow me to the lobby manager. I complained to the lobby manager to the security guard in person. I was furious on the spot: Where do I live, can you communicate internally, don’t you know that I can’t park the car, and I don’t even know which room card my wife has? ? Then, I wanted the security to take my luggage from the car to my room, and I was turned down because it was to host a convoy of guests who had a wedding tonight? ! God, a five-star hotel, managed as a service that is not as good as a country hotel, instead of trusting the hotel guests, it keeps making the guests busy looking for parking and not helping the guests with errands. This is the service that a five-star hotel should have. ? I hope that guests who drive by themselves should be careful when choosing this hotel. After all, staying in the hotel is for rest, not for being unnecessarily exhausted by the hotel!

msg:This time I went to Zhongshan to meet friends. I decided to stay one night in order to enjoy the food in Zhongshan and book a quality-guaranteed and trustworthy hotel. Naturally, I found the Zhongshan Lihe Hilton Hotel, which is ranked first in Zhongshan City. When we arrived at the hotel lobby, the receptionist received us by a beautiful lady Clara. She was enthusiastic, caring and attentive in service. After understanding our needs, she arranged for us to stay in a non-smoking floor and warmly told us not to miss the scenery on the roof. The rooms are comfortable and tidy, and the beddings are clean and hygienic. It also helped me delay my check-out time, and parking was free. A very good experience, come again next time.

Later, when the Macau epidemic broke out, Macau was temporarily changed to Zhuhai Zhongshan Tour. I didn’t expect Zhongshan to feel good, mainly because there were few tourists. Livable very comfortable feeling. This Hilton is basically the best hotel in the area. It's good in every way and I'm very satisfied!

msg:Good service attitude! But the management of the hotel was a mess, and we didn’t check in until after 5:00 pm. The hotel told me that the sanitation was not done well. Later, they said it was done. They gave me a room card and told me that it was on the 51st floor. When I went to the 51st floor, I found that the room card was on the It said 5015, and I went down to 5015 again, but the door couldn't be opened at all. Then I called the front desk, and the front desk said my room number was 5105, which was on the 51st floor. Well, I guess you just made a mistake......., I turned back to room 5105 on the 51st floor, opened the door and found that the room was a mess, the last guest had just left, it was really irritating, at this time It was almost 6 pm, and I was exhausted, so I went to the lobby and changed a room again. There has never been such a chaotic management. What's even more ridiculous is that we opened another room. When we returned to the room at night, we found that there was a backpack with a red envelope for no reason. I was scared to death... As for the breakfast, it is even more irritating, like a big stall, there is nothing to eat, we should not add more than one hundred yuan for breakfast per person, it is not worth ten yuan. Ctrip really makes people complain, my child is 1.2 meters, and I also bought breakfast for the child. As a result, there is no need to buy it at all, and Ctrip says that 1.1 needs to be purchased separately. There are more than 1,000 rooms, which is not cheap in Zhongshan.

At that time, the lady at the front desk was very nice (I’m sorry if I forgot to call it) and was upgraded to a corner house for free. The bathtub can directly see the Zhongshan scene, which is great. There are also biscuits and fruits, great!

Later, I bought 2 boxes of Hilton moon cakes because I was staying in and bought moon cakes. The taste was okay. Very pleasant stay ~ recommended!

The most important thing to complain about is hygiene. The two beds in the room given to me were moldy! moldy!
Called the service desk and replied: impossible. Without going to the scene, I arbitrarily said that it was impossible. Could it be that I made trouble out of nowhere?
A waiter was sent and said: wipe it for me.
There are a lot of hotels that I stay in every year. I didn't expect that "Hilton" would be such a rubbish.

但酒店是一個綜合體。除了酒店以外，還有其他的商業設施。人羣比較雜。所以如果是純粹尋找酒店居住的感覺。那麼這個酒店就有點複雜。

整體來説作為希爾頓這個價位其實大毛病沒有，但體驗不算太好。

設施：
外賣沒有機器人，要自己下樓取，有時候要走到電梯邊的外賣櫃，非常不方便。
電梯需要刷房卡到達對應樓層，房卡不靈敏，需要插卡，幾次插卡都是紅燈。
床墊不算特別舒服，房間內沒有體重秤，手機充電插頭衹有一側床頭有位，書桌側面有電源位。
房間另配抽濕器，冰箱製冷基本無效，浴室有固定位天花板花灑。
泳池一米二到一米六同泳道逐漸加深，有温水泡池和汗蒸，需要房卡進出，服務人員不是很積極，浴巾毛巾要特別找人要。
沒有洗衣房，洗衣另外收費。


環境：周邊就是商場，城景高層，距離知名美食店都不算太遠。

服務：入住要排隊，填寫郵箱送伴手禮，伴手禮是不好吃的杏仁餅。

另預訂房間要先付全數按金，登記入住期間又另付房租，不能用按金扣，此舉不甚便利住客，要是住上幾天，也要預留多些被扣款項。
本人沒有連房間預訂三樓餐廳早餐，但房客亦可入內用餐，每位九十八元，也不貴，食品多種選擇。

約3點到達，很多車都是泊大堂出面，看見有很多位置，但就是不給我泊，堅持要去隔離泊商場停車場。
3點check in，6點先可以取房🤬，這是中山自稱最好的酒店嗎？留了聯絡方法也沒用，有房也不會聯絡你，我不停等，等到要你忍不住去Check in counter 查詢，才答你：可以了，根本沒有打算通知我。那5點Check in 的人，會幾點鐘才可以取房間？

交房的那天，中午約十二點多，有一個清潔呀姨叩門，然後求其找個理由，問你有冇衫要洗(廢話)，我答冇後，佢就說正題，那你夠鐘要退房啦。這是大酒店提醒客人退房的方式嗎？唉！完全沒有Training過。

第二天，我轉住附近幾公里的公寓，泊車在樓下免費，清潔乾淨，復式兩層，有河景，400人仔，兩房，平你一半有多，房東都會聯絡你說：早，今天會繼續住嗎？我回：不用，房東會說謝謝，遲退房，一句：可以，就解決問題，光明正大，有禮大方。

原來酒店就是這質素。

msg:希尔顿一直是我到中山的首選酒店，酒店附近的配套亦十分齊全。酒店員工服務十分到位，上至前台，下至清潔的員工對客人都十分有禮，亦會主動打招呼。特別想表揚前台員工-Arron，他的服務態度非常好，很有同理心，在check in期間見有小朋友同行，建議加錢升級到行政房，沒想到房間環境及景觀都非常好，孩子很喜歡，樂而忘返。值得欣賞的是自助早餐款式很多，而且味道都很好，比其他四/五星級酒店還要好，希望可以一直保持！下次到中山還是會選這家酒店。
设施：室內游泳池十分好，不會受天氣影響。美中不足是有游泳堂，影響酒店住客游泳。
卫生：很好
环境：景觀好
服务：十分好

不過她有一個最大短板：與商場共用停車場，而且沒有自己酒店專屬停車位，這是我見過的五星級酒店裡唯一的存在。想象一下你在繁華商場裏找停車位的感覺，對自駕住客十分不友好。

利和附近就有一個大巴站點，去周邊城市，特別是深圳很方便。

這個轉換沒有了水果供應(49樓本來是有的)，我們沒有特別要求，反正沒需要但看出不夠細心。
房間很大，有獨立沖涼及用厠位，也有企及浸浴用的，地点很好附近有很多東西吃。

這次我也去了游泳池，非常滿意！救生員一直有人當值，這是很多泳池都沒做到的。感覺就是安心！
早餐品種很夠，中西都有。唯一不足點，就是那位在做蛋的廚子。我從沒看過那麼差的態度。蛋是早餐基本都會點的。就一個人，安排可能就有問題，但我沒見過點兩衹太陽蛋的，你分開一衹一衹做，這真的搞不懂！其實外面有些都提前煎好或增加爐頭這類辦法。你們那位廚師衹能每次煎一粒蛋，又不能再接單。人就一個人，跟他説一句，他就做一個他在做事情，別煩他的動作。這真的不太好的感覺！希望有待改進吧

2. 説好的恆温游泳池，應該説衹是常温吧………感覺水冷的
3. 廁所竟然沒放垃圾桶………也沒手機託盤………無語…………
4. 房間袋子也沒給一個……想裝東西都得自己想辦法……

住：床墊、寢具一如既往的希爾頓品質，沒得説。房間隔音堪比七天如家，隔壁的衞生間洗漱聲聽得一清二楚; 走道里路過能清晰的聽到每個房間裏面談話聲——房門隔音不達標。
行：地面有停車場，保安會非常有禮貌地指揮入位。地下停車與購物中心共用，車位充足。中山本也不大，酒店基本上市中心，出行便利。
大堂、客房裝修風格中規中矩，沒特色也無甚缺憾。客房衞生間淋浴、馬桶標配獨立隔間，方便。健身房器械充足，滿足基本健身需求。泳池、宴會廳未去客觀不評。頂層觀光層、餐廳裝修，客觀不評。
服務：基層保安、保潔、用餐、客户服務沒得説，有求必應。接待前台比較冷漠，不能換港幣也就算了，人民幣零錢也不換，真是好樣的！沒有商務中心，打印要2.30元/A4，我兩間客房連住五晚，不配打印張A4黑白文件，實在是幹得漂亮！

環境：周邊很繁華，吃喝方便。酒店內部環境簡約大氣。
餐食：早餐品類多，味道不錯。家人很喜歡西式早餐麪包蛋糕。我偏中式多點，隨大流的預製包子有點遺憾，不過基本所有的酒店都是這樣了。方便了，卻缺點手工製作的味道。
設施：泳池非恆温，娃遊了兩天嫌冷。
其他：停車方便，到周邊景點公園步行街都不遠。附近有核酸點，充電樁也不遠開車5分鐘內。
總體非常推薦，我們住了5天，滿意。

早餐就很豐富，很高級，游泳池也有冷水池和熱水池之分，裏面還有汗蒸，不錯！

msg:很久都沒有點評酒店了，真的是感覺一個方面做得好都算了，可是真的要吐槽
缺點基本集中在客房服務，前台的服務既不熱情也不冰冷，算是及格。客房裡的抽紙本來不多，薄薄一包，應該50抽左右？？？根本就不夠用，加上本身有過敏性鼻炎，所以就打電話去前台多要兩包，送來了一包，再問，沒有。送來的員工含含糊糊的就衹會重複衹能給一包。不怪員工，畢竟這是有規定的吧，可是希爾頓酒店是個五星酒店，在中山幾年裡基本上除了新開的艾美酒店之外就是獨家了吧，即使是沒有鼻炎，一小包抽紙，不能再給？？？實在是理解不了，看來下次入住貴集團酒店除了手帕紙還要把抽紙捲紙一起帶上，免得打擾了。
第二，剪刀的問題。去了那麼多地方也知道有一兩家酒店是不讓送剪刀的，據説怕自殺？不知道。可是吧，既然貴酒店能夠提供剪刀，為何要像看犯人一樣非在門口盯着客人用完，拿回來，才可以呢？我衹是衣服爛了縫補一下，或者是我的縫補技術不入流，你限時十分鐘之內我還真的搞不定，所以，我以後入住貴集團酒店應該自備剪刀。
第三，我明明在房門外寫了請勿打擾，請問，為何三番四次來敲門（未到交房時間），這個按鈕你們可以去掉了，形同虛設
最後，應該是不會再入住了

環境：周邊環境好，酒店環境一般

進入房間後，明顯感覺到這個酒店確實有些年頭了，但是它保養的很好。
優點如下:
1. 花灑連接處沒有水垢，噴頭也較乾淨。
2. 房間的温度適中
3.浴袍舒適
4. 提供健身室🏊🏻
5.酒吧氛圍到位


可惜沒有拍房間
為了評"五星"，頂樓的酒吧可以看得出管理者的用心。員工的禮節不錯，但是細節上需要注意。
