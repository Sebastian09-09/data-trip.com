Room is neat and tidy with great panoramic view. It is awesome and wonderful. Everyone must enjoy this.

A little queue up during check in but it was fine. Front desk staff were polite. But unluckily, the soundproofing of my room (locate as Room No.10) is very bad. I kept hearing the next door come in-and-out with door opening and closing. I understood that it cannot blame the guests but the door hinge doesn't work effectively. It is so ironic that St. Regis aims to provide the guests with good sleeping but the real was not. The sound made my sleep very bad and it was really ruined my stay.

Keep avoiding to be allocated the room facing north.

Checking in room on 96/F, overseeing the amazing view of Shenzhen CBD. 
First we was arrange to room 1801, but we are staying to celebrate valentine day, we would like to have the bath top next to window. 
The butler, Alice arranged to us to stay at the room and informed price detail for upgrading. 
The process was smooth, we switched to different room within 10 mins, meanwhile we took some stunning pictures with those turndown amenities. 
After dinner at KK mall, we experienced the gym and swimming pool on 75/F, everything is so 5 stars, water and towel can be access easily. 
Morning buffet on 95/F offered many different options , western pastry to Chinese noodle bar and so on. We had some delicious eggs. 
The overall experience was great, even the hotel generously offered us a late check out at 4pm. 
I love the kindness of those staff and St.Regis brand name.

Room was small and hot, there is a iPad but if you need any item still need to call‚Ä¶ A/C keep 24 degrees even I set 16. I didn‚Äôt ask for change room because after check in I went out, when I was back is already 1am.
Someone ring the bell at 11:30 morning asking do we need laundry service. But we check out at 12pm
So disappoint to this hotel, st Regis and ritz Carlton HK was so nice can‚Äôt believe Shenzhen one will be like this.

The decor of the hotel lobby is modern and grandiose.  However, the hotel room is a bit dated and could have been refurbished and modernized bit. But overall, it is a very pleasant stay in st Regis in shenzhen. The panoramic view alone is worth everything. I will definitely come back again.

I‚Äôm particularly impressed with the warm reception from all staff (especially Oscar of front desk and my butler), thankful to them all. The facilities and St Regis Bar are all good and should be visited. Butler service is another highlight of the entire positive experience 

I have no hesitation in highly recommending St Regis SZ. Would definitely visit again when I‚Äôm in town.

msg:My wife and I just returned from a ski trip in Japan, where unfortunately, both of us sustained injuries that limited our mobility. We chose to stay at the St. Regis hotel, expecting a high level of service and care. However, our experience fell short, particularly in terms of the staff's attitude and responsiveness.

Perhaps our expectations were influenced by our recent stay at the top-notch Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong, where we were treated with exceptional service. The contrast between the two experiences highlighted the significant differences in hospitality and attention to detail.

Upon arrival at the St. Regis, we were initially impressed by the grandeur of the building. However, it quickly became apparent that the hotel lacked the warmth and friendliness we had experienced at the Mandarin Oriental and other luxury hotels. During check-in, no special attention was given to our condition, and the staff seemed indifferent to our needs.

In the evening we decided to order from a popular local food delivery service. We called our butler to arrange for the door-to-door delivery from the lobby. The interaction with the staff was disheartening. When we confirmed that the delivery contained food, the butler outright refused to send it up to our room. Despite explaining that I would be willing to go downstairs to retrieve it myself, considering my condition, she still insisted that it was not possible and suggested that my wife should do it instead. It felt as if I were conversing with an emotionless AI rather than a human being. After persisting, she reluctantly agreed to send the food up but claimed that we needed to sign a waiver, which turned out to be unnecessary.

To make matters worse, when I politely asked for her name, she flatly refused to provide it. This lack of transparency and accountability was deeply disappointing and added to the overall negative experience.

However, I must note that the hotel did provide a wheelchair to our room, which was appreciated and helped with our mobility challenges.

If you are seeking a hotel that truly values its guests and provides exceptional service, I would recommend considering other options. This particular St. Regis property did not live up to the standards and expectations we have come to associate with luxury hotels.

msg:A stay at the St. Regis for the whole family was planned for some birthday celebrations. There‚Äôs a saying that ‚ÄúA good plan is a success half-done but not a crystal ball‚Äù. But the St. Regis Shenzhen management led by the General Manager, Ronald Wang and the Butler team has made it happen! The trip was perfect, most enjoying and memorable; the quality of service is excellent and as expected. The hotel facilities are in top condition and the buffet is delicious with a lot of varieties. The Butler service is unique and does live up to our expectations. 
When I mentioned to Faust, the Chief Butler, that it‚Äôs a very rare opportunity the whole family could get together, he personally handled our hotel arrangements down to every little detail. Alice, the Assistant Chief Butler who is very pleasant and helpful, also got involved to answer our needs when we arrived. The Front Desk staff was also informed, Harris, attentively checked us in and upon availability, offered a Loft Suite to us so to accommodate the group for the birthday celebrations. Every need is so meticulously addressed. The room is well prepared with cakes and wines! What a great surprise! We have all enjoyed every moment, as if all the St. Regis Butlers and staff have lined up to serve us like HOME, comfy and elegant! Last but not least, when I dined at the Social Restaurant, I was walking with a stick, Wilson Fan, thoughtfully offered to take the food back to my table! What a considerate act! 
At the St. Regis Shenzhen, we were spoilt with the scenic views, the hotel facility, the gourmet food and the service!  Gazing down the Shenzhen city as from the mountain top! What a free and relaxing experience! We have enjoyed the family celebration to our total satisfaction with the taste of the hotel gourmet food and wine, the luxurious stay in the rooms and some shopping in the KK Mall! After a fun filled day, we left the St. Regis Shenzhen and took home with lots of sweet memories and laughters, there‚Äôs nothing we feel missing at the St. Regis Shenzhen but to come back for more! Thanks to Faust, the Chief Butler and the St. Regis Shenzhen management for a job well done!

We travelled with a 1 year old and sent an email to the hotel butler in advance who promptly replied.  They prepared our room with a cot and whatever amenities we needed, they were readily available.

From checkin to checkout, we didn‚Äôt have to lift a finger, royalty treatment. The chefs were also very considerate, offering to cut up food for the baby even though there was a line at the noodle bar.  

It‚Äôs a shame we didn‚Äôt have more time to enjoy the rest of the facilities at the hotel.

Overall service is good and we enjoy our stay with few things for improvement. (1) Lady's Sauna room was out of order. (2) The chair inside room is not ergonomics. (3) Hot coffee was only at room temperature due to adding cold milk.

msg:The location and view of St Regis Shenzhen are superb. It is situated in one of the CBDs of the city, with a few large shopping malls nearby. The service is also impeccable. The butler of my room is very helpful and gives some suggestions of my stay in Shenzhen (including tourist spots and restaurants). She also helps to reserve places at restaurants. 
Furthermore, the morning buffet breakfast of the hotel is one of the best I have tried. It offers a wide spectrum of cuisine including Cantonese, western, Japanese and Indian cuisines. 
I would definitely come back in the near future. And thank you, St Regis üòä

I needed to have a last minute meeting. They offered their staff seat for me to charge my laptop for my meeting. I have been to many 5-star hotels. This hotel, tho a bit old, comes with the top-notch attitude and service quality. I would rate 11 out of 10. Highly recommended!

msg:Coming back to St Regis Hotel after 4 years was the best decision I took for this travel to Shenzhen. Me and my family were traveling out of China via Hong Kong International Airport, for the first time after the pandemic, so we wanted to have a good rest before beginning the long journey overseas. 
Even after to our arrival to the hotel, we received a huge help from the E- Butler service , that helped us send all our heavy luggage from our home in Fujian Province to St. Regis, and later help me buy the Shekou Cruise tickets to the airport, to book a good limo service that could fit all our luggage and help us with the luggage in the Cruise Terminal (we are traveling with our 15 months baby). 
While doing the check in, we were introduced to Heather, which took a very good care of all our needs, brought our kid toys and bathroom amenities, and introduced us to our room and all the extra services from St Regis. We also got the placer to meeting Loka, which help us with the check out process , and waiting for our car the that that we went to the cruise terminal. Overall, this is the best hotel that I had ever visited in China. Lots of congratulations for the whole team.

My butler brought me a lovely cake with a bottle of wine. Later there was also a tasty coffee as a gift. We checked out at 3 pm. The hotel is near the park, shopping malls and metro station. If you are in Shenzhen,  KK 100 is a must see building, if you can stay there, do it!

msg:This is a very nice hotel with nice facilities and beautiful views. If you stay at this hotel you are paying for luxury and getting it. My room had stunning views over the river and waterways from the 84th floor. Nice. The tallest hotel in Guangdong, I am told.
Staff were friendly and helpful at all times.
Breakfast was nice, with a wide selection. 
The only small thing that held it back on the occasion that I was there was that there seemed to be no air conditioning in the bar which was on the same level as reception. The ambient temperature was probably a little high for me here, to the extent that I stayed for a shorter amount of time than I might have done otherwise. It may be the case that other people prefer a slightly different ambient temperature, but nonetheless, I suggest that it is given some consideration. 
They managed to get the ambient temperature right in the St Regis Zhuhai, which I stayed there recently, for example.

Views are also amazing - if you want to see the city directly from your bathtub, I would recommend booking a Fortune room. Can also recommend the breakfast, there's plenty of both Chinese and Western options.

However, there are some small things that are not perfect: I must say that the room is not as spacious as in some other 5 star hotels, and you can sort of see that the hotel is not brand new - for example the room carpet does show some discoloration here and there. Despite these small things would definitely recommend this hotel.

msg:The view from the 85th floor cloud room is very open, and the room hardware is impeccable. There was an episode due to a minor hygiene problem when checking in. The hotel manager on duty immediately dealt with it and upgraded the room, and gave us gifts and happy hour. I also received free red wine the next day. It was just a small problem, but the hotel took it very seriously, which made me feel valued and was a pleasant surprise. Room service is also a feature of St. Regis. During the check-in process, the customer service Mia was responsive and responded promptly, and even applied for a late check-out for us. This time I had a very pleasant stay at St. Regis, and I hope to stay again next time I come to Shenzhen

msg:I stayed at the St. Regis Hotel many years ago. This time when I came to Shenzhen, my daughter came with me and I booked the St. Regis Hotel specifically to let her experience the feeling of living in the clouds. As a result, I had a bad impression as soon as I checked in. The shower in the toilet was leaking, and the chair was very old. When the waiter came to deliver water, I casually mentioned it. I thought I would just stay for two nights. I never expected that the waiter would directly report my complaint to YOYO at the front desk. She immediately contacted me and helped me change to an upgraded suite. I was really touched, and my daughter was especially happy. Thank you very much YOYO for treating guests as family members and making me feel at home. Next time I come to Shenzhen, I will stay at the St. Regis Hotel

They also arranged for a champagne opening ceremony with a saber at dusk. Where can I enjoy this special program? In the evening, at We had a buffet on the 96th floor of the hotel. The young and beautiful female manager of the restaurant arranged a rose petal birthday cake for us, which was very surprising and satisfying. In addition, Alice in the lobby on the 97th floor also helped us register for late check-out, and the elegant Evie in the lobby was also very polite.

They will also considerately arrange the children's toys into cute shapes. But the aromatherapy in the lobby is too pungent; there are not many types of breakfast; the anti-slip towel outside the bathroom door can't be put in place because the door is too low, and a lot of water will come out when you come out; the wastebasket under the dressing table and the bathroom share one, which is very inconvenient.

It's a pity that I didn't have time to go to the happy hour on the 100th floor this night (it is not open during the day). I will definitely go next time.

msg:Stayed at the St. Regis Shenzhen this time
Enjoy the high-altitude accommodation experienceÔøºÔøº
In the lobby, you must first go to the 96th floor to check in.
I met a very good employee Audrey Ma during my stay this time.
Very polite and friendly to others and explain carefullyÔøº
Upgraded my room for free to give me a better experience

As soon as you enter the room, there is a minibar on the left. Unexpectedly, there is a cloakroom on the right.
Then go straight in and you will see the big bed and floor-to-ceiling glass to see the scenery on the 89th floor.
Opposite the big bed is the bathroom. As soon as you enter, you see a large bathtub.
Because there are two wash basins after the upgrade, it is very convenient for you and your partner to have one each. The toilet and shower room look out at the view on the 89th floor.
It was the first time in my life that I went to the toilet at high altitude at the same time.
That feeling is really novel and interesting
Free bath salts and sponges are provided in the bathtub. You can also watch TV. When you turn on the TV, it will enter movie mode and the lights will be dimmed. I feel that the hotel is very attentive.
When I opened the daily necessities, I unexpectedly found a floss pick to use. It was really thoughtful.
I really like the shampoo and conditioner in this hotel. My hair is very smooth.
I immediately went online to check where to buy it
The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean
The sound insulation is very good and you can't hear the sound from the corridor at all. There is really nothing to fault.

We also visited the gym
It is also a good experience to exercise while looking at the sky
People who like fitness may wish to try itÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº
The scenery there is also beautifulÔøº

When I checked out the next day, I happened to meet Audrey Ma again.
Then I found out he was the front office manager
His staff helped check out and their service attitude was really goodÔøºÔøº
They checked to see if we had any complaints about the room and they were very polite.
Call us immediately to check if there is any problem with our room, and we will refund the check-in depositÔøº
Works super fast
Because I stayed in other hotels before, the refund might take a day.
I didn't expect it to be that fast. You can arrange to return it directly as soon as you check outÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº
They also gave us small gifts

I've stayed in many different hotels
This experience really opened my eyes
Although many five-star hotels have very good services or hardware
But the service and hardware are both very good. It‚Äôs really rare.
And the price is very cheapÔøºThe price/performance ratio is really highÔøº
Let me have a really happy dayÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº

They helped us press the elevator and sent us takeaway. From the first time I entered the hotel, their concierge depar**ent was very polite and helped us send takeaway. Helped us press the elevator directly to the 85th floor. After reaching the 85th floor, their front desk checked in for us and gave us a small flower. Then before I booked this hotel. There was one. The hotel staff was very patient, helping me answer all my questions, preparing the flowers for me in advance, and I asked him to help me draw the curtains, and he did it. He also gave me a lot of suggestions on how to create romance. Overall, I must praise this lady. Thank you very much,

2. Service: Although it is a business hotel, there is no care for children or content to attract repeat stays for parent-child/family groups. This is purely a personal opinion. The overall quietness feels cold.
3. I wanted to go up to the 100th floor, but I couldn‚Äôt. I was told that it was not open to the public.
Personal summary: This trip was purely to take the children to see the scenery, have a buffet dinner, and take pictures. The glass is still reflective... There is no need to stay

Environment: The view of Shenzhen city from the hotel is quite good, but this time the hotel gave me a room that was almost on the bottom floor. If I want to upgrade the room, I have to pay extra. I think this hotel is not friendly to guests who book through non-Marriott channels, and you'd better be a high-card Marriott member so that your stay experience will be perfect.

After so many years, the decoration style is a bit old school, but it is well maintained.

The fact that this hotel is on the 96th floor is one of its selling points. Unfortunately, it was completely white the day I stayed.
Service and cleanliness are very good. There are many breakfast options, including Japanese and Indian breakfast. Western style and Egg Benedict, only you can‚Äôt think of it and you can‚Äôt eat itüëçÔøº
Another worthwhile additionüëç is the roaming WiFi, which allows you to freely access the world‚Äôs networks including WhatsApp, FB, YouTube, that‚Äôs why most of the guests are foreigners.

The disadvantage is that for takeout, you have to go to the 1st floor to pick up the food, and you have to lift on the 96th floor. So you have to lift every time you go out.

msg:Overall it's very good, I like it! Sometimes renting a hotel with thousands of dollars to celebrate the festival is a good choice.
It would be nice if the weather was better, the scenery would be even better~ Thank you to the hotel for providing us with birthday decorations and gifts.
The food at the buffet was good, but we didn't eat until 8 o'clock. It felt like the chefs were getting off work soon. There were many types of food to choose from, and the desserts were surprisingly delicious (I'm not a girl who likes desserts).
The desserts are not too sweet and taste good. I tried 7 or 8 kinds, and the small ones won‚Äôt put you off! Thank you.

It‚Äôs a bit lacking that the 100th floor is not open.

When I went up to the lobby on the 96th floor, the receptionist smiled kindly. When I checked in at the front desk, my father's room was upgraded for free. The butler sent him to the room and made arrangements. After the introduction, I gave a welcome fruit in the afternoon. Although it is an old hotel for more than ten years, the facilities and equipment are well maintained. The view is very wide because of the high floor. The city scenery of Shenzhen is unobstructed. The cleaning lady in the room is very polite. The next day When renewing the room, the beautiful woman at the front desk continued to give the old father a free upgrade. The breakfast was rich and there was no need to queue. Overall, the hotel's hardware equipment and staff standards can represent the St. Regis brand. It was a pleasant stay experience and I will still choose to extend my stay and come again. Check in.

However, the New Year's Eve party information is very confusing. It was originally said that every guest who checked in could participate in the sky 100 party for free... but it was later corrected that it was no longer available because the reservations were fully booked.

There is a nightfall ceremony in the clouds at 630pm every night! You can enjoy the scenery and champagne on the 96th floor!

msg:Take your baby to the safari park and choose to stay at the St. Regis Hotel~
I don‚Äôt know where all the bad reviews come from? This is my first time staying at St. Regis Shenzhen. I‚Äôm used to living in Rosewood and Jumeirah. This time I chose St. Regis, which is convenient for eating, drinking and shopping. Downstairs is Kingkey KKMALL. Nanjing cuisine and Xuji Seafood are good. Jiang Hudong Barbeque is good. Delicious, cold noodles are okay!
Before departure from Guangzhou, I called the hotel to confirm. Although the Ctrip housekeeper said that everything had been arranged, I was psychologically affected by the improper arrangements made by the Ctrip housekeeper when I stayed at the Atlantis Hotel in Sanya... so I confirmed it myself.
Answering the phone is very friendly! We just arrived at the hotel and parked the car in Area A. We took the elevator and went upstairs. When we came down, we were greeted by a handsome guy who helped us carry our luggage. We declined with the small suitcase. It‚Äôs not that pretentiousüòÑ. We took it to the elevator entrance and pressed the elevator guide to go up to the 96th floor to check in. I was greeted by a female employee with a ponytail who just got off the elevator~ I sat down for a while and didn‚Äôt wait long. 15 minutes? Because there were some guests checking out at 12:30, I brought water and asked where it came from. Are you tired from the journey? Just a few words of warmth~ I saw a cold face on the negative review. I didn‚Äôt encounter it. I guess it‚Äôs improved! I took the room card and a handsome guy took me to the room. What cordial greetings do I need to provide? Praise the housekeeping depar**ent cola? Mian Shan kindly arranged the whole room to be very comfortable and brought water and towels because he was very attentive when checking in with a baby~ I stayed in St. Regis for a few days in Shenzhen and it was very comfortable. The decoration is not as good as the Rosewood Jumeirah Guangzhou, but at least the attitude is great! Check-out was also very fast. Special praise to jack Liu! The processing was quick and nice. I also gave my princess a giftüéÅ

Everyone‚Äôs stay experience is different, but our first trip in the new year felt the enthusiasm of all the staff at St. Regis Hotel~

Criticize the swimming pool for poor design! ! ! The baby was wearing hotel slippers and fell down. There was a bang on the back of his head and he cried out in pain...T.T The St. Regis Hotel should learn from Jumeirah Hotel and lay a mesh anti-slip mat next to it! ! !
Also, the elderly are not allowed to enter the children's swimming pool! ! ! Very disgusting, spitting and poking mud...

The height is also one of the hotel's most unique selling points. The St. Regis butler service was very attentive. There was scale in the kettle in the room. I thought it was mold at first. After calling the housekeeper, they brought a new kettle directly from the warehouse, which exceeded the customer's expectations. The hardware facilities are well maintained. Although they have some age, it can be seen that the quality is relatively high. The only minor flaw is that the floor mat will shift after the glass door of the bathroom shower room is opened, and water seeps out seriously.

After hearing this, she was very detailed and attentive in helping us make reservations and arrangements.
Arrangements for receiving cakes and sending them to the bar for freezing
Not long after we got to the room, she called us and asked if there was any problem with the room.
Knowing that there were three of us, he said he would add an extra set of toiletries for us.
He also said that there will be a small cocktail party in the hotel for the evening scenery.
But we couldn't participate because we were going out for fun. They asked us carefully when we would go out.
We came over to serve and add things after we were out.
In the evening we went to the bar. The table we booked was decorated with rose petals, which was a surprise.
Many thanks for their service

The view outside the hotel window is really beautiful. We stayed with a city view.
The lights of thousands of houses at night are really beautiful. Check-in is first-rate.
After we checked out, we checked in on the 96th floor and enjoyed the river view outside the window.

msg:It was my first time to stay at the St. Regis Shenzhen and I got a free upgrade to the five-star rating. I gave it to the front desk and bellboy services. I can‚Äôt say enough about George Chen at the front desk when I checked in and Vera who greeted me when I checked out. Their attitudes were very warm and very good for special reasons. I really couldn't rush back to the hotel in time to pack my luggage and applied for a late check-out. The hotel readily agreed. Thank you again to all the service staff. This five-star review is dedicated to you.
Another slightly uncomfortable thing is the hotel's breakfast. The restaurant on the 95th floor has a very nice view. It's such a wonderful thing to look at the beautiful scenery and eat a delicious breakfast before going out to do errands. But what I ate really made me feel better. Down for a day. The bread under the poached eggs is hard and the sliced ‚Äã‚Äãbread does not taste fresh. The cucumber juice is very bland. The overall dishes and ingredients do not match the hotel's brand. Compared with other hotel breakfasts of the same level, it is really lame.

I originally wanted to call the hotel a few days after booking to propose a birthday celebration.
Arrangements were made but there were 5-6 fights and no one listened.
Later, I checked in at the hotel and was given a room upgrade and complimentary wine and fruits as compensation.

Arrive at the check-in lobby on the 96th floor of St. Regis around 10:30 am on 22/7/2023. There are five of us, including two elders. Booked three rooms. ÔøºManager Ma assisted us in checking in. She was friendly, helpful and had a genuine smile the whole time. Although it was not possible to arrange a room due to the early hours, she did her best to accommodate us. Intimately let us stay at least one of the rooms around 1:00 pm (the original pick-up time was 3:00 pm). Let the elderly have a comfortable environment to rest. Ôøº

When we went back to the front desk to pick up the room key at around 1:30 in the afternoon, Ms. Ma was not at the front desk, but when she learned that we returned to the hotel to pick up the room, she came back to help us check the arrangement. As tourists and first-time guests to this hotel, we were very impressed because what she provided to hotel guests was not a regular service, but a warm heart and gentle care. Also, we met some staff in the 96th floor lobby and they were all polite and helpful. For example, Ms. Heather assisted us in arranging our luggage, and guided us to our room and explained the hotel services in detail. Another female counter staff who was said to be a new colleague also went out of her way to help.

We also participated in the St. Regis Hotel's traditional cloud ceremony. very interesting.

The room the hotel gave us was also very nice. Two of them have been upgraded. The three rooms have three different views. Let our family enjoy different beautiful scenery. Really very considerate!
ÔøºThere are welcome fruits in the hotel room, as well as 24-hour butler service, you can call the butler at any time, and enjoy free coffee, hot tea, fresh milk, etc. Very thoughtful and convenient. Feel at home. Ôøº

Thanks also to the Ctrip app for giving us free breakfast and late check-out discounts. The buffet at the St. Regis is of a very high standardÔøºand we had a rich and deliciousÔøºbreakfast in the morning. ÔøºThe room for improvement is to speed up the speed of refilling coffee for guests. Ôøº

 Our overall impression of the hotel and service is great! Of course, the environment and facilities of the hotel are very good.

The hygiene of the room is really not very good, the trash can is covered with oil. There was a coffee machine, but there was only one coffee cup, so I called and asked for an extra cup. When the cleaning lady brought it, she said naggingly: It's not a suite, so there's only one cup. üôÉ This is a twin room, so does it only come with one cup? So two people want to share a cup?

For example, when you enter the room, you will not take the initiative to ask if you want coffee or tea (I read the introduction on youth tube). Buffet breakfast and dinner are all available. There are many types and the taste is very good. This stay is to celebrate a birthday, and the hotel has been informed earlier that cakes can be arranged and delivered. At the last check-in, no cake was arranged, but the housekeeper took good care of it and arranged it again. After entering the room, I saw that it was arranged as three balloons and one card. I don‚Äôt want a red wine, but I added a cake, which is delicious.

The waitress, the little girl, helped to adjust it in various ways. The breakfast is also good, which is considered an upper-middle level in hotels of the same level.

I chose a parent-child themed room with children and made appropriate arrangements (unfortunately, the arrangement is in a boy's style, and the children pointed it out ), the hotel is located in a bustling area, it is very convenient for shopping and eating, the hotel breakfast is also very rich, and the dining environment is first-class. The housekeeper, Li Xia, is very attentive and thoughtful. She gave the children many surprises, made them happy, and gave her five-star praise. There is also a handsome guy in the luggage service (whose surname seems to be Du). The service is also very good.

The night view of the bar is very beautiful, drink some wine, just go upstairs to sleep, there is a band, the piano is great!
The afternoon tea waiters are average, and the layout can be opened up a bit. When taking pictures in the afternoon, the waiter at the afternoon tea was a little rude, saying that I had turned on the flash, but after I turned it off, I was still staring at it, not very polite, I took a photo of the grand piano, and hurriedly followed me, afraid that I would play his piano , To drive away, we hurried away. In fact, I am not bad at playing the piano. It‚Äôs not good for a long distance. In short, I was driven away all the way, and I was disgusted all the way. It‚Äôs quite embarrassing.

Food: There are many types of breakfast food but the taste is not special

Facilities: You have to wear a swimming cap to swim in the swimming pool. There is ice water in the fitness room, but the treadmill is old. The treadmill is the same as the room. You can only connect to the iPod, but not Bluetooth. There is an electric switch in the room, but no electricity.

Generally speaking, it can reach 5 stars, but not that 5 stars

msg:Unexpectedly, my experience at St. Regis Shenzhen was very poor this time.
1. The package booked on Ctrip does not include a 300 spa voucher.
2. After arriving at the hotel, I ordered food in my room, finished my meal, and went downstairs for a walk. I told the front desk that the food in the room could be collected. However, when I came back from the walk, the dining table was still in the room. There was a smell of food in the room, but I still ended up with it. Start packing up and push the dining cart outside the room
3. The fruits delivered to the room are all bad.
4. On the third day when I left the hotel, I had to catch the high-speed train at 6 o'clock. I received a phone call the night before to tell me to prepare the room bill and invoice. The housekeeper added WeChat and sent him the invoice information. However, in the morning I went to the front desk to get the invoice, but I was told that the room was Ctrip. I can understand that the booking was made directly on Ctrip, but I was not mentioned about the charges for my room. I didn‚Äôt ask too much because I was on the high-speed train, and the room deposit has not been refunded yet.
5. The toilet is not a smart toilet at all. It feels so cold when you sit on it and it feels so cold.
There are still two days of breakfast for two because I didn't get up on the first day and I didn't catch the high-speed train at 6 o'clock the next day. I don't know how the breakfast is like. Let's leave it like this. I won't have any thoughts of staying in the hotel after that.

I was surprised by the series of things after that. The whole hotel knew us, because we informed in advance that we arrived at the hotel in the afternoon. When we checked in at the front desk, as soon as we mentioned our name, the boy at the front desk immediately seemed to know us, and introduced us to the hotel, places to visit nearby, room view and orientation, etc. Wait, very cordial and enthusiastic, the whole person is happy. Afterwards, it should be the manager of the lobby. He was very generous and wanted to send us back to the room. He smiled very beautifully and was generous. When we met again in the check-out lobby, he said goodbye. Overall it was a perfect stay, starting from the phone call, thank you butler Nina for being impatient to introduce the hotel and room arrangements, friendly and attentive, too sweet, Nick at the front desk and Yoyo, the lobby manager, hope to see you next time you come to Shenzhen.

At night, you can also watch the countdown of Shenzhen's central axis at the bar, which is great! !

Sleep until 9:30 the next day and go up to the 95th floor to enjoy the buffet breakfast. The meals are quite rich and delicious! !
After breakfast, take a nap and get back to sleep. At noon, it‚Äôs lunch time in the guest room again.

2. Let me talk about why the service is given a bad review. I checked in at the front desk on the 96th floor at about 21:40. The room type I booked was 1260 yuan. This little brother recommended me the room type 1460. The room size and facilities are the same but the orientation is different. The scenery of 1460 is said Even better, after I refused, he told me again that the room at 1260 hadn't been packed yet, and I needed to wait for 40 minutes, and the room at 1460 could be checked in immediately. Maybe because the floor is too high and the mobile phone signal is not good, the procedures are a bit slow, and there are people behind, so I moved to the side and let the people behind go through first, and suddenly thought how could the room not be cleaned out so late? I went to another front desk to check in, and ended up checking in [sweating]. In order to sell expensive room types to play tricks, I will send you a real-name negative review. Finally, the scenery is still very good.

The St. Regis Hotel Shenzhen is located on the 75th to 100th floor of the Kingkey Building and is still the tallest hotel in Shenzhen so far. Enter the magnificent lobby on the 96th floor to go through formalities and feel the famous butler service of St. Regis Hotel. NICK WANG answered questions with a smile at the reception, and his warm, patient, and meticulous service left a good impression on people. From the room on the 78th floor, you can have a close view of the bustling city streets of Shenzhen and a distant view of the verdant border of Hong Kong. The configuration of room facilities is different from other ordinary five-star hotels: the mattress is KINGKOIL, which was founded in 1898 by the world's top ten famous mattress brands. It also provides nine kinds of pillows with different functions for guests to choose from. The high-end brand Axor faucet (Axor) of the German company Hansgrohe, which has won 300 international design awards, is a well-known skin care product Remede from the United States, and the famous German brand WIK kettle. Surprisingly, the hotel also gives a gift Founded in 1899, the Italian famous San Pellegrino natural mineral water for drinking. The only regret is that the old-fashioned toilet was not replaced with a smart toilet, which is related to the improvement of hygiene and civilization. The infinity swimming pool on the 75th floor of the hotel is extremely eye-catching, making people linger and forget to return. The delicious dishes from all over the world are delicious, and the hotel's butler service is very good. Staying at the St. Regis Hotel will give you a high-end luxury enjoyment.

The waiter in the lobby who received me didn't know what she looked like or what her name was, but the service attitude was straight-forward, which made me a little uncomfortable. Not as warm as the elevator lady and restaurant waiter this morning. After registering and arriving in the room, I didn't see any butler service, and I didn't know who the butler was. Also, the fruit that was given at check-in was not delivered. I called the room service twice at 12 o'clock and no one answered. Later, it took 10 minutes for someone to call back, and I told me that the fruit was not delivered before it was delivered. This year, the number of guests staying in the hotel without mentioning this service will only become less and less. I hope the hotel can pay attention to this aspect of management.

msg:The first time I stayed in a hotel on the 87th floor, the St. Regis Shenzhen was so powerful. I arrived late at night, and I deliberately looked at the room in the direction of Hong Kong. In the morning, I could see the sunrise, which was super shocking. At night, the glass was full of fog, and the scenery when I opened my eyes was particularly beautiful. Next time will come to stay, try the room with city night view.

Donald took the trouble to answer all kinds of questions and took me to choose a variety of rooms. The final room was very satisfying! ! The scenery is absolutely amazing, and it really still has to be high in the sky. Isn't it a panoramic view of Shenzhen's central axis! ? Girlfriend is very satisfied happy wife happy life hahaha!

msg:Everything else is just a minor problem, but there is a very embarrassing rule that little boys over 2 years old cannot follow their mothers into the women's locker room of the swimming pool to take a shower or change clothes. According to the staff, unless they are still Babies who can't walk will not be allowed in! On the first day, we talked a lot and saw that we wanted to complain about discrimination, so we asked the boss for instructions. At least they provided a SPA room for us and our son to take a shower, which barely solved the problem (it was actually inconvenient). The next day, we changed people. The attitude was very tough and we couldn't even provide a SPA room. As a result, after swimming, we, mother and son, had to wrap wet bath towels and walk through various corridors in full view of everyone. We took the elevator back to the room to take a shower and change clothes. The feeling along the way was... It was wet, cold and slippery. I was worried that the child would be cold and I was very tired from holding him around all the time and almost fell! ! !
       First of all, as a woman and a mother, I definitely won‚Äôt worry or care about any evil thoughts or harassment that a baby who is just over 2 years old will have for me. I can‚Äôt understand what the people who made this rule think; secondly, even if I am afraid of other individuals, Women have this concern. As a well-established five-star hotel in Shenzhen, it should have other solutions, such as setting up family rooms, instead of simply saying no! I have stayed in countless high-end hotels at home and abroad, and I have never encountered such a problem in a hotel! If you are abroad, you can directly complain about discrimination in this situation! In this society where women are the main caregivers, five-star hotels in first-tier cities in China have not yet put themselves in the shoes of female mothers. It‚Äôs no wonder that St. Regis‚Äôs ranking has been getting lower and lower in recent years! Anyway, I won‚Äôt go there again!

I almost caught a cold after taking a shower, and the swimming pool was rescheduled to open at 10 o'clock without informing the guests who checked in, which made my son and I have a wasted trip.

msg:The hotel is in a famous building called Kingkey 100. The front desk is called the St. Regis Hotel on the 96th floor of the building. You need to ask the doorman on the first floor to help you press the elevator to the 96th floor to check in. After that, you can take the room card and change it to the elevator downstairs. Privacy is handled very carefully. I came to Shenzhen to live for three days, and the overall feeling is not bad. The night view is worthy of the price. What is worthy of praise is his transportation: [Taxi] You can play and you can go to play in all directions. [Subway] You don&#39;t need to go out of the station, you can go directly to the hotel by going through the underground tunnel. Exceeded my expectations. Quite convenient. The hotel room will have options with or without breakfast. Special attention should be paid to breakfast. Personally, I think it is quite rich. Some items are very good and taste very good, especially the strawberry Napoleon. There is sausage powder. The night view of my room on the 90th floor can be seen across from the tallest building earlier. There is also Dongmen Old Street, you can walk there, and high heels can be tolerated. Similar to a small commodity market, the online celebrity shop Wenheyou is also in that direction. The hotel has a bathtub, and I really like the floor-to-ceiling windows of their home. The basic accessories are complete, and the coffee machine is an additional bonus. It is a pity that it is equipped with so many spare items, such as makeup remover for girls, and no nail clippers. Nail clippers must be dealt with quickly because of the barbs. This time I went out and took the facial cleanser into a makeup remover. Although it is very convenient to go downstairs to the shopping mall, I had a hotel in Shanghai before and it was very considerate to have a complete set of cosmetics. A sample, but basically not many hotels will do it comprehensively

When we arrived at the lobby on the 96th floor, the view came into view!

Listening to the accent, Loka speaks the vernacular, and I speak it too, but Loka is cute and thinks I speak Mandarin, so he always communicates with me in Mandarin haha üòÑ. Entered the room and found that my butler Coco had prepared gifts for us. In the evening, I picked up my girlfriend to the hotel and went back to the front desk on the 96th floor. The handsome Nick gave us the room key! My girlfriend also thinks that the service of the St. Regis Shenzhen is very unusual! In the evening, the housekeeper Elph... (didn't see the name clearly) brought the bathtub cover very quickly, and left very quickly haha, so I didn't see the name clearly. What surprised me the most was that I went to have breakfast the next morning. I also took pictures on the 95th and 96th floors. I actually met the manager Nina who was on duty at night. She was a beautiful lady, she said that because she was on duty. The night shift can't meet us in person, but I believe her colleagues will take good care of us, and I can feel that my girlfriend's Mandarin is not very good, so I immediately turned to the vernacular to help my girlfriend take pictures, the poseüëç is really great and considerate La! Melissa also took good care of us when we dined on the 95th floor. There were a lot of customers, but I felt her kindness to us.

msg:The hotel service is very good and very good. This is the second time. The clean and hygienic rooms also come to ask what you need from time to time. It's like going to the Maldives for a honeymoon with her boyfriend. Especially Nick's service is very good and so polite, just polite. He is still so handsome, and he gave me the room type. It feels as happy as a star awarded a champion award. Thank you for your service! The software and hardware of the hotel are very good, which makes people addicted, and will come again next time.
But afternoon tea made me embarrassed.

Catering and service are the highlights of the hotel, which are commendable. The breakfast is complete, and the standard and warm service of the Japanese waiter, Kelly Jia, is impressive. It would be better if the male staff at the front desk on the 96th floor were friendly towards the guests.

msg:üîîService: Very considerate service! Thanks to the housekeeper Spenser Xiao who took care of our 2 girls very much ;)
When we arrived at the hotel, Sunny, the housekeeper on the first floor, and Annie, the housekeeper on the 96th floor, warmly entertained us and answered our various questions.
Chloe who checked in at the front desk was very efficient, and also briefly introduced the hotel's facilities and the opening hours of its restaurant, which was convenient for us to arrange our itinerary.
As soon as we entered the room, Jay's butler carefully prepared cakes, red wine and fruits for us.
When I went back to my room to rest in the evening, I received St. Regis Bear (forgot the name) biscuits, macarons and chocolates prepared in advance by Kellys butler, very delicious :)
The view of the bar on the 96th floor in the evening was really good. Marco, the bar manager, gave us advice on wine selection and drank a good white wine. Good wine paired with a beautiful view, perfect for a whole day!
Dan Zou brought us coffee in the morning, their coffee is also available and they offer different tea options
Thanks to Sakura for arranging our late check-out and Nick for checking out so that our schedule will not be rushed

üçÉEnvironment: very comfortable The view is very pleasing to the eyes both in the room and in the Bar day and night
Quiet setting perfect for weekend relaxation

üßπHygiene: neat and tidy

On the 96th floor to check in, the beautiful Chloe at the front desk warmly entertained us, very considerately changed us to the twin room on the highest floor, explained a series of precautions, and the first impression of the store was particularly good. The housekeeper loka took us to the room, the person was very warm and nice, and it was a warm reception. On the way back, the housekeeper Spencer heard that we didn't receive a bear gift, so he made a special trip upstairs to bring us two cute bears. Although they were small, they were a kind of good fortune. Allen was with us. He brought us water while waiting for the bus. The whole process is very good. For those who can't leave Shenzhen and can only travel in the city, the St. Regis is a good impression and experience.

msg:One-sentence evaluation: a high-end old hotel with absolute barriers in location, the main selling point is the height of 100 floors.

transportation:
The Metro Grand Theater Station is directly accessible, and the surrounding area is one of the bustling business districts of Luohu, which is highly accessible.

facility
As an old hotel that has been around for some years, the facilities in the room are remarkable, and the iPad controls the intelligent environment system, which is basically the optimal solution for that year.
The furniture is well maintained, it looks old but not broken.
Is the old hotel is always too soft mattresses, pillows too high.
The swimming pool environment is good, the water temperature is 26-28 degrees a bit cold in winter.
The gym is fully equipped.

Serve
The response speed of the butler service is still very fast, but the delivery of things is as slow as the average hotel.
The software is very good, better than 90% of hotels. Such as the thickness of the towel, the comfort of the slippers, etc.
Maybe the positioning is business, and there are no children's facilities to borrow.

health
It is rare for a hotel to be checked by the waiter after cleaning, and the room is clean.
Carpets are a little dirty.

food
I only ate breakfast, there are not many categories, but the quality is very good, and the details are also good. For example, all kinds of freshly squeezed juices and fruits are very fresh, and there are various choices of salted and unsalted non-dairy butter for the bread.

msg:Having stayed in so many Luxury hotels, the experience given by St. Regis Shenzhen is really bad, except for the better city view.
ü•£Breakfast: very poor. The choice is worse than the buffet breakfast in a four-star hotel where I stayed in Shenzhen for several hundred yuan. All semi-finished products are used. The baked beans in the American breakfast are very thin, and the potato cakes are still cold when you order them for the first time. The Cantonese-style breakfast wontons and siumai are much more unpalatable than the quick-frozen ones bought in cheap supermarkets. This breakfast with a luxury hotel is a bit confusing.

üîîService: Our package includes afternoon tea and bathing ceremony. After afternoon tea, we called the housekeeper at 3 o'clock and told the housekeeper to deliver it to the room at 6 o'clock. Thinking of returning to the hotel after exercising, we can take pictures before night falls. As a result, the afternoon tea service was half an hour late, it was dark when it was delivered, and the afternoon tea was normal. As a luxury service, at least on time should be required.
The taste of Welcome drink cocktails may not be acceptable to ordinary people, mainly sitting there at night and enjoying the night.

üçÉEnvironment: The scenery is okay, give us a free upgrade, deluxe city view room, the night on the 88th floor is okay, and hygiene is OK

Facilities: We stayed in Room 8810, the two sockets at the bedside were broken, only the USB port could be charged, and the sound of the air conditioner was roaring in the middle of the night, affecting the quality of sleep.

The indoor heated swimming pool has a good view, but it is not very constant temperature and it is cold.

To sum up, although it is normal for a hotel that has been in operation for ten years, it is normal for the equipment to age, but in terms of breakfast quality and late arrival, it is not recommended to stay.

31st day of check-in

No one opened the door, no one took the initiative to unload the luggage
After a long time to find someone to come, there are several cars waiting there to unload luggage, only one person came to help, a concierge at the door told him to stay still and hang up.

2. Poor breakfast service
Bad breakfast mess
Except for the doorkeeper
From the beginning to the end, I have never seen a waiter who took the initiative to provide service. There was a super long line in the presidential suite, and there was no preferential service at all. The breakfast restaurant was like a food stall. .

3. Swimming üèä Poor facilities and services
The pool attendants didn't see a single one
Dirty pool
The locker room is also dirty
The steam room is small
The temperature can't rise for half a day
There is no waiter

4. Poor room service
health service
Called for a long time and no one came
It's not good if people come here to do hygiene for a long time.

5. Poor room experience
The facility has been renovated for more than ten years
  Very poor bed experience

In a word, the quality of various services on New Year's Eve is super poor. But the price is very expensive. It has doubled than usual, like a small homestay, which is unheard of in a five-star hotel üè®.
in addition
The king bed in the master bedroom of the presidential suite that my friend booked offline actually collapsed seriously and couldn't sleep at all, so I had to go outside to sleep on the sofa in the back. According to my friend's experience of staying in the hotel for more than 300 days a year, this is the international five-star hotel with the worst experience for him.

The poached egg in the picture can only be considered a sweet egg at best
For the time being, I think it is more familiar with epidemic prevention and food safety.
But the omelette next door is too low in price
The same as the eggs in the roadside rice noodle shop
Hope to improve breakfast

I never expected that I stayed up all night...Every three hours or so, the phone in the bathroom rang inexplicably, and I was alone in the middle of the night. It was really scary to be awakened several times. In addition, the lights can be completely black, but the control panel is very bright, the room is very dry, and the ceiling does not know whether it is fire-fighting equipment or something. There are two white lights flickering and flickering. The room is very dry, it is difficult to breathe without ventilation, and it is noisy to open the exhaust. The pillows are also very high. All four pillows are equipped with high pillows. Later, I couldn't stand it at 6 o'clock in the morning, thinking about ordering room service to change my pillow. Even more bloody things happened, and the phones were all broken. After responding to the problem, the hotel arranged for me to change rooms. Strange toss, thank the warm-hearted staff very much.

No one added food for about forty minutes. I asked three times and said to wait until the food was closed. No one added it. The management was too messy. Not the quality and service that a five-star hotel should have. Not as good as social catering, the overall experience is very poor.

The next day it happened to coincide with the first anniversary of falling in love with my wife. I specially chose the St. Regis Hotel owned by Marriott, overlooking the St. Regis in Shenzhen. The butler Verena, Kristin , And Cora‚Äôs service attitude is super good, the caring service prepared me in advance for a sweet photo during the love period and printed it out and put it in the room, and also gave free red wine to decorate the room. It was a perfect stay experience. Regis will never disappoint me. Give me a sense of home

One of my Lancome foam facial cleansers was newly opened, and it clearly fell in the bathroom. Call the hotel to ask the hotel and say no, take me a facial cleanser and make a fortune, is it right? The quality of the basic three-star hotels in China is very good. Anything left in the hotel will be returned immediately. You are a five-star hotel. , Take me a bottle of facial cleanser and don't give me. It's disgusting. It makes me very, very angry. The following is the original picture of my neck allergy.

Every staff member of the hotel is very enthusiastic, taking the initiative to greet and greet each other. Although I am not the most enjoyable in this aspect, I believe most people will feel the warmth.
There are many types of breakfast in the hotel, probably because of the Cantonese buff bonus, and the quality is more guaranteed.
The last is the high-rise scenery, if you have a unique utility in this area, it is highly recommended

msg:This is a vacation experience beyond imagination. I am very grateful to the St. Regis Hotel for meticulously arranged and arranged this parent-child holiday for us, allowing my family and I to spend a very enjoyable weekend. I experienced St. Regis's "butler service" for the first time, and I was very moved because it was special and pleasantly surprised, warm and heart-warming. We check in on Friday and check out on Sunday. In these brief three days and two nights, we need to thank the staff of St. Regis Hotel, because they let us experience and feel the difference of St. Regis. Sophisticated and elegant. Here, I would like to especially thank some friends who have provided services to us:
1. Thanks to Ni Lei for providing us with the whole reception service, from the initial selection of entry into the store, selection of room types, introduction of hotel functional areas, surrounding supporting facilities, greetings to the store, room layout and other services, to the warm reminder and follow-up of the final departure Services such as advancement and blessing.

2. Thank you Wang Ning for providing us with services such as check-in and check-out procedures, luggage placement and placement, room type recommendation and arrangement.

3. Thanks to the butlers Cora and Loca for their enthusiastic help and introduction, paying attention to and caring for my children and my mother, paying great attention to politeness and etiquette, which makes us feel very happy and comfortable, and have a feeling of returning home.

4. Thank Sakura for his care and love for the children. The encounters and encounters on the 96th floor made us feel cordial and familiar with the brilliant smile. The building block toys presented with heart are very considerate and practical, adding more fun to children's leisure time.

5. Thank you Eaka for the guidance and care of the swimming pool depar**ent. Because the children are very young, they need to be reminded of issues such as ground sliding and safety hazards. The children are safe and comfortable during their play.

6. Thanks to the help of Sunny, the concierge, because the luggage is very large and heavy, so this beautiful girl is very sorry to carry the luggage, but her sincerity and enthusiasm deeply affect us, even if we have to leave the store We are very reluctant to give up, she also gave us the last warmth and care.

The staff at St. Regis is really attentive and professional. We are residents living in Shenzhen. We usually choose to take our children and family to stay in different hotels to experience different feelings, but the experience of St. Regis is very Strongly, although there are not so many holiday feels and children's facilities here, we are deeply impressed by the invincible landscape and warm and thoughtful service. We will pay special attention from now on and will definitely come back for a little stay. There are still many staff names provided. I couldn't write them down. I'm really sorry, but your service and image represent the St. Regis Hotel, so you are all great! For example, the service sister who provides us with house cleaning, the service sister who serves buffet breakfast, the butler sister who provides butler service, and many service staff in the reception depar**ent, as long as they meet each other, they will greet politely, which makes people feel comfortable and attract attention. Thanks again to the staff of the St. Regis Hotel, thank you for your hard work and sweat, we will see you next time, there will be a period later.

Second, the sanitation of the hotel rooms is very poor, and there are scattered hair on the bed and on the sheets. Such sanitation during the epidemic prevention and control period is very angry;
Third, the room facilities are outdated, the power switch is basically unavailable, and the lights are all on and off suddenly when no one is touching it. It looks like a ******* house. If it weren't for the husband, I would be scared to death in the middle of the night;
Fourth, the service attitude is also very poor. After a problem occurs, it is required to be dealt with. The person in charge has not appeared for a long time. It is simply a bully!

C/I could meet me on the same day, including the small cards prepared in the room and the complimentary fruits and red wine. It was really great! (The red wine was finally returned to the hotel and I didn't drink it because we brought wine ourselves) The card prepared by Alice from the housekeeper team was so heart-warming, and Jay was very caring and enthusiastic.
After playing in St. Regis for a day, talk about the following points:
Switchboard, dial the phone in the room, and the switchboard lady answered the phone and said Happy Birthday is great! Feeling smiling across the phone!
At the front desk, I must mention that after C/I, when I took the initiative to take my friends to make up the registration, the FO female front desk was very cold and uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs in a bad mood. After all, it‚Äôs St. Regis, how about serve all? I have stayed in a lot of hotels, so I guess you won‚Äôt be so indifferent if you receive mysterious visitors? Regardless of professionalism, the use of customer skills is equally important, isn't it? But as soon as I enter the room, my mood is instantly good, so I have to praise the butler team!
Cloud buffet
On the night of check-in, the self-service market was fully booked, so I chose to eat at noon the next day. We walked in and told the waiter who took the guests that they had booked in advance and reported the room number and stated that I need to pay for the room. Half of the boy came to ask us if we had to buy a ticket... I didn't hand it over. But the food is good and delicious.
The overall is still very good, this is a five-point praise for the housekeeper team and the switchboard! Deliver Amplified Service is very touched hahahaha

For example, the two large three-hole universal sockets on the left and right sides of the bed have been plugged in unstable flat plugs at both ends.
In short, the level is still the same, but slowly can't match the years.

The guy was playing with his phone and chatting in the elevator the whole time, and he didn't help with the luggage. And!! There were two female staff members standing behind the receptionist who checked in. They should have just finished their shift. They were actually talking about the guests' privacy, saying that the guest had an affair with a mistress, and talking about the guest's dress. They were actually talking loudly, talking and laughing!! No other staff stopped them the whole time! Also, I booked a room fee of 1,500 yuan with breakfast. When I ordered breakfast in the room, the room manager did not tell me that breakfast could not be delivered to the room, so he charged me two extra breakfasts. In addition to the messy charges in the lounge, the room fee was about 1,500 yuan a night, and I was charged for two nights, a total of 3,200 yuan a night, which was really impressive. Figure 2 is the check-in fee plus deposit, and Figure 3 is the additional fee charged when checking out. The service is also average, much worse than the service I went there before.

msg:I had been staying at St. Regis and was quite satisfied with it. Other staff members were very nice until I met a female lobby manager who was very arrogant and bitchy. She didn't arrange my extension and arranged a worse double room for me because it was full. The facilities were outdated. It's ok that she was irresponsible, but she didn't try to solve the problem and used official language to fool guests. She was arrogant. Is such poor performance and behavior worthy of serving in a five-star hotel? Where is her quality? Where is her professional accomplishment? Where does she feel superior to treat her guests arrogantly? How did she get to be an account manager? By her skills? By connections? By her looks? By the relationship with her superiors? Or what?
