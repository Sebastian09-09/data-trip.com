msg:We always stayed in this Hotel every time we go to Xiamen. I think that it is the best hotel so far, not far away from the airport and also great location. The hotel is clean and smells good. Some staff can speak english but it will be a lot lot better if all of them can speak english. Overall it’s a 9/10 experience.

I would like to give compliments to the reception staff at this hotel, especially Beck and Wendy.

Beck had guilded and helped us to book our ferry tickets to Gulangyu and made payment using his local identity. Kudos to his good services, we had a very good experience staying in Xiamen.

Wendy had helped me with my Accor membership registration. 


Thank you for the good services Pullman Xiamen. I will bring my family back again at this hotel.


Kind regards,

Alex Chua from Singapore.

msg:This hotel was fantastic, especially for the price. We were here in the off-season and I'm not sure what the normal price is, but we paid almost 1/3 of the price for a hotel of equivalent quantity just last week in Shanghai.

The breakfast buffet was great, they have lots of options and have chefs preparing noodle and congee bowls on request.  I highly recommend the Japanese restaurant here as well, some of the best meals we had were there.

The pictures did not show it, but our room also included a large bathtub which was a big plus.  We were working while we were here and there were plenty of comfortable places to work.

My only complaint is that they allow smoking in the lobby and in rooms close to ours; this seems to be the case in other places we've stayed in China, but was difficult coming from the USA

msg:We booked a 3-night stay here, and one of the main reasons was the indoor pool. Unfortunately this was out of service for the duration of our stay, something which might be worth mentioning on their website/beforehand (I was only told when I asked the receptionist after checking-in). 
The room itself was fine and a decent size (we almost had a little bit of view from the lake) except for the fact that it was uncomfortably warm and stuffy, especially at night. Even more surprising as it was pretty cool temperature wise when we were there. We tried opening the window but there wasn’t enough breeze and the mosquitos. The AC did not work seem to work, reception was notified and we were told a repairman would look at it. There seemed to be slight improvement in the second night but by the final night it seemed to have become as hot and as stuffy as the first (not sure how they would manage in the hot summer if it is like this in winter). Hopefully this will be addressed or it was only an issue with our room.
The location is very good, next to a park and by the lake, less than a ten-minute walk from Hubin Middle Road subway station (take exit 2) or a short taxi drive to most places in town. You can also borrow umbrellas from the hotel, handy as it was raining for the majority of our staying. 
The hotel will also ask for a 1000 rmb deposit on arrival which should be returned to you after you check-out.

The location is excellent as it's on a small island surrounded by kish vegetation and you get the feeling of being out of the city. The service was decent. We booked a room with executive benefits but the executive lounge was closed. They offered the executive benefits at the regular downstairs lounge but the staff were unprepared and didn't know what the benefits were. In the end all worked out but it did take 30-40 minutes of confusion.

The Science and Technology Museum and Gulangyu Island were not far away. The concierge service staff would help open the car door and carry the luggage every time. The air conditioner had a slight smell of smoke, but fortunately the ventilation was good and the air was fresh when the window was opened, so I simply didn't turn on the air conditioner. There is a heated swimming pool indoors, but I didn't experience it due to the rush of time.

There is a tour guide service desk for Gulangyu Island at the front desk. It is not recommended. The tour guide will have some recommendations. The included ferry ticket is an economy ticket, and the seats are very crowded. It is recommended that families with children buy comfort tickets by themselves.

The room is small, and the toilet is even smaller. Because of the small area, the bath towel is placed in a very small space, far from the bathroom, which is very unreasonable. The toilet is in a very small cubicle.
The room facilities are old, with various scratches and cracks. The color is like this and it is still so dirty.
Then the breakfast is really not good. Except for the bread, the taste of other freshly made food is unimaginable. The most weird five-star hotel has no cold milk for breakfast. I decisively gave up staying the next day.

msg:It is a very surprising old hotel. It is located in Bailuzhou Park in Siming District. It is quiet and convenient to go anywhere. Although the rooms have a sense of age, they are well maintained. There is a lake and Pigeon Square around it. The front desk is considerate. They gave me pigeon food, which my daughter liked very much. She played all afternoon, and the service was very considerate. She also gave me Su Xiaotang, which was delicious and not boring.

The service was very good, and the staff had a strong sense of service. The environment was very good, in Bailuzhou, next to the pigeon park. The front desk gave the children a bag of pigeon food, which gave us a good place to go in the afternoon. The breakfast was quite rich, with many choices and a long time, so we were not afraid of sleeping in and missing breakfast. The disadvantage was that the room was relatively small and the lighting in the room was too dim at night. There were not many places to choose from for eating or shopping around, and it was not far from the scenic spots, but every road was congested during the Spring Festival, and it took a lot of time to get a taxi.

1. The hotel room is extremely dirty and messy, and the executive lake view king room I booked for nearly 2,000 yuan was completely different from the promotion.
2. The Chinese restaurant on the second floor is a sinkhole. A plate of ordinary tofu costs 138 yuan, and a plate of rice and scrambled eggs costs 2 yuan for 108 yuan😭
3. The breakfast is dirty and messy. I will tell you after watching the video.

msg:Considering travel convenience and hotel facilities, I chose this hotel during the Spring Festival. The hotel is in Bailuzhou Park. The environment is quiet and the air is very good. There is a bus stop at the door. Routes 8, 97, and 26 pass through many popular attractions, but the stop where you take Route 26 is about 700 meters away from the hotel. During the Spring Festival, there are musical fountains and light shows in the park. Many people come to watch them, so we can just walk there. If you take a taxi directly to the scenic spots on the island, it will basically cover the area in ten to twenty minutes. The front desk arranged a lake view room on the 9th floor with a good view. Fruits and drinking water were replenished in time every day. The executive lounge is also on the 9th floor. Due to my schedule, I only tried it the day before check-out. The afternoon tea and evening happy hour with the viewing seats are still worth it. When I booked a room before, I saw a comment saying that the lighting in the room was dark. After checking in, I found out that it was indeed the case, and it was all spotlights.

However, the protection of residents’ privacy at the front desk needs to be strengthened urgently. Without my knowledge, my roommate only provided my name and reservation channel and checked in before me, which surprised me.

The facilities are complete, but relatively old, for example, the drinks in the room are very low,
The curtains are not automatic, the room is small, and the bathroom is very narrow. The bathtub is a child's favorite. The swimming pool is small, there are not many people, and it has been splashing for a long time, mainly because the baby likes it. Generally speaking, the cost performance is average, more than 700, not as good as the room package of more than 400, and there is no welcome fruit or drink. The buffet is ok. The level of reception is still at the level of five stars. Come on, Pullman!

Finally, I have to complain about the breakfast, which is basically nothing. If the hotel did not include breakfast, we would not come here to eat this breakfast with a unit price of more than 100, which is almost the same price as the buffet lunch and dinner. The ingredients are not rich enough, the cups are not replenished, the coffee machine's coffee seems to have been watered down, and the omelette stall is understaffed and there are many complaints. It is strongly recommended that hotel managers pay out of their own pockets to experience it.
In the case of a hotel with an excellent geographical location, the hotel can actually make its own characteristics, reflect the advantages of service, and become more competitive.

On the island in the middle of the lake, the shower room of the hotel is not well drained, the breakfast content is not rich enough, and the dishes are not good enough. My best impression of the hotel is the lobby manager of the hotel, a tall man, warm, polite, and proactive. This is my best impression of this hotel. In short, this hotel is still very cost-effective. If It is a good choice to choose a vacation. If you are traveling, it is a little inconvenient here, because there are not many places to eat and shop around, but the natural environment is excellent￼.

msg:This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. I don't know if it's Pullman's staff who are willing to lie or Xiamen is willing to lie. When I arrived at the hotel very late, the security guards didn't allow me to park in front of the door and told the fire exit and tomorrow morning seven Point crane operation, can not stop! You need to find a place to park at the back! The parking location is very far away, and no one arranges it. When I went out at 7:00 in the morning, there was no construction work at all. When I came back from errands after 10:00, there was no work. I searched around the back parking lot and there was no space. Check out and leave, the security guard can’t do it, said that the leader’s notice will come soon, I asked Min CSS206 car, told the group sales director’s car can be parked freely, the sales director can park and occupy the fire exit, and we have to walk more than 100 with luggage m to park the car and carry the luggage! There is only a security guard at the door who walks around at will, manages the car, and there is no bellman. After entering the store, there is no service at all. I really have a new understanding of Pullman through Xiamen Baolong! I began to see on the Internet that the service of Xiamen Powerlong Pullman is particularly poor! If you think about it, the five-star hotel is not much different. I chose him because it is far away from the pier and relatively quiet. Unfortunately, the service is suffocating!
Service: Extremely poor, especially the concierge and security
Hygiene: clean
Facilities: general
Environment: beautiful external environment
I didn't see any construction work until I left at 11! The big liar in Turkey, don’t believe the words of Powerlong Pullman, garage construction, they are all lies

It took half an hour from payment to phone call to change it. They said they couldn't change it (I offered to make up the difference). I will call the hotel front desk first. They said they wanted me to find Ctrip. When they called Ctrip, they said they needed to communicate with the hotel. It’s not that the small problem of changing rooms can’t be solved. In the end, no one called or gave tickets to go on a cruise (when feeding the dog). The hotel Around 8:30 in the swimming pool, the lifeguard asked to collect auxiliary supplies. When I asked, they said they were outsourced. They were not given to the students. Others are tougher and don’t give him ******** and dare not bully an honest person. A five-star hotel bath pool bathroom does not provide towels. Don’t ask me, your staff just said they don’t provide towels. This is the first time I heard that five-star hotels do not provide towels. Towels. The door of the bathroom in the room can’t be closed tightly enough that water is everywhere in the shower. This is the first bad review in my life for you guys! Lightning warning

Arrived at the second floor of the hotel at 8:10 p.m. to prepare for dinner, I was told that I could not eat, and the waiter was eccentric and had the lowest consumption. The reason may be that I wanted to leave work early. (Mark at 9:00 on the Internet)
The breakfast was quite satisfactory. The lady at the front desk said that the four of us only had three breakfasts, but I clearly booked two rooms with double breakfast on Ctrip. The attitude was bad. The entire service staff gave the impression that they were arrogant and fearless. Overall experience is poor!

Her loud shoe sound was there to help, but it wasn't. 2. The overhead light is intermittent, the air conditioner is not heating, there is a hole in the bed sheet, and the toilet paper is pulled out as shown in Figures 5 and 6.

msg:Xiamen Powerlong Pullman, as a five-star hotel under Accor, the facilities, sanitation and environment of Pullman need not be repeated, and they are even better among hotels of the same level. It is worth mentioning the location and landscape of the hotel . Adjacent to Bailuzhou, surrounded by commercial districts, and a few steps away from the subway station, it has the best lake view in Xiamen, which is the only hotel in Xiamen.
What impresses me even more is the hotel's service. The hotel really cares about the guests and absolutely pays attention to any needs of the guests. Especially Xiao Wen at the front desk, who called in advance to confirm the check-in matters, actively asked the guests about their room preferences, and helped handle everything from check-in to check-out. In the evening, I was also invited to visit the executive lounge. The rest of the hotel staff are also very professional and polite. The water quality of the hotel swimming pool is clean, the water temperature is comfortable, and the real constant temperature! The breakfast dishes are rich and cost-effective. The room view is almost invincible, whether it is day or night, it is beautiful.
Xiamen Powerlong Pullman left a deep impression on me. The service level is absolutely top-notch among peers. Thanks to Xiao Wen at the front desk of your store for leaving the best memory for my trip to Xiamen.

There is No. 8 bus at the door to Zhongshan Road Snack Street, which is very convenient. But because it is in the park, it is about 600 meters to 1.2 kilometers away from the surrounding business district.
Hotel facilities; the lobby looks a bit old, but the bedding in the room is very clean. The room feels like a Wanda Hotel, and the windows can be opened for ventilation, which is great during the epidemic.
Service: Thank you Mr. Wang at the front desk for upgrading the lake view room for free, and the room cleaning lady is also very good.
Breakfast: There are fewer varieties, and the little chaos is good.

msg:1. There seems to be no doorman or concierge in a five-star hotel. You get out of the car with your luggage, enter the door, check in, and the front desk is not serious. Wait a few minutes, ignore me.
2. After applying for upgrade privileges, my friend checked in early and confirmed again and again. The male front desk said that it was definitely an upgrade. When I checked in, I asked again. The male front desk hesitated for a long time before saying that there was no upgrade, and I forgot it before.
3. The hotel's breakfast is very average, and it can even be said to be a bit unpalatable.
4. I called and asked for two bottles of water, but they didn't come after waiting for half an hour.
5. The hardware is a bit old, the lake view is very pale, and the roll paper drum is broken.
6. On the day of departure, I had to leave very early in the morning, so I asked in advance to pack my luggage.
Then, the milk cup packed by the hotel spilled out, spilled in the bag, on the suitcase, it was a disaster. The reason is that the cup can only be held by hand and cannot be bagged.
Honestly evaluate, strongly recommend, go to other better five-star hotels at the same price, and give up this Pullman.

msg:The room is the size of a seven-day chain hotel, and the staff are quite indifferent and polite. Is there no one in this hotel? One, when I take a shower inside, I bump my butt. I have a standard body shape, but take a look, can I move in the shower? Second, half of the toilet seat is so narrow, how do you use it? 3. The countertop, the left and right space is so small, do you think it is bigger than the countertop of Seven Days Inn? Four, when my child came out of the bath, there was a little water on the ground, and he almost slipped and fell to his death in the bathroom, which scared me to death. The whole bathroom floor is smooth. Five, on the glass door in the picture, you slipped carefully logo? I've been looking for it for a long time, oh my god, it's pasted on the wall next to the washbasin, which means that when you wash your face, you can look to the side and you can see that there is no shower room. What do you think of this hotel? Sixth, the space in the room is only so big, two people in it, there is no space for activities, it will be depressed, like being under house arrest. You shouldn't sell it at this price, this is the key, you have this condition, just rely on the word Pullman? Five or six hundred and one nights? No fruit was given. When Ctrip reported that my child was almost dropped, the so-called manager on duty, like a standardized copy, called to ask about it, and said goodbye to the coping one. If your hardware is poor, you can either change the hardware, take away the bathtub, reinstall the entire bathroom, and the available space will increase. If the coffee table and sofa are replaced with practical ones, it can still be so expensive, or you can use software to make up for service. It may be okay to take care of the customer's feelings, take the initiative, non-replicative service, solve problems and do practical things. But you are not, indifferent, indifferent. I don’t recommend you to come here. It’s not because it’s Pullman, it must be good. There’s a reason why it’s only 4.5 points. I’ve booked another hotel before, but I was struggling all night and changed to Pullman. I originally planned to stay for three nights, but on this condition, do you think I can stay for three nights? The hotel has no capital to be so arrogant and indifferent.

The only thing that can be recognized: the breakfast is okay, at least there should be a variety of products, now someone is talking about people, the chef (I see he is wearing a black chef uniform, the default is the chef) can still be present, inspect, and talk to the guests Words, written in that Zhang, this is called telling people's words from facts. This is what it should be, and it has indeed become the only thing I wish for.

msg:On the third day in Xiamen, this Powerlong Pullman was chosen for visiting Bailuzhou Park. It is quite convenient to walk from the hotel to Bailuzhou Park.

I booked a superior lake-view room, and it was more than 500 yuan, and afternoon tea was also provided. Generally, I don’t have high requirements for hotels at this price. I don’t talk about the design sense, as long as it doesn’t affect sleep, and the hygiene is in place, travel is fine. I didn’t expect it I was very disappointed when I actually stayed. The experience of staying here is not as strong as Novotel of Accor Group.

It was 2:00 in the afternoon when I went there, and the room was not cleaned until 3:00 in the afternoon. When I entered the room, it smelled very bad. The so-called "superior lake view room" is very small, and the window is only a small area. Looking at the lake view, living in it is very depressing. I don't know where the "advanced" is? There is a large piece of pen marks on the desk and stool. It seems that it cannot be cleaned, and it will remain on it forever. It makes people afraid to sit.

The minibar is empty, but the deposit is charged. When I took a shower at night, I found that the bathroom door could never be closed tightly. At first I thought it was because I didn’t close it, but later I found out that it didn’t. No matter how many times I closed it, the bathroom door would open automatically , It will never be closed tightly. In order not to flood Jinshan, I had to spread a large towel on the ground. There are noises from the road outside when sleeping at night. If you are a person with poor sleep, you should consider making a reservation.

The complimentary afternoon tea is very unpalatable. Since it is a gift from the hotel, I will not write a separate negative review. I was so scared that I went out for breakfast and dinner, and I didn't dare to eat and drink in the hotel.

The most amazing experience came from the manager of the afternoon tea lobby bar who didn’t wear a mask, admonishing the staff in front of the guests. You must know that when I went to Xiamen, YQ’s prevention and control was the most stringent, and I was also drunk. I used to ask Ctrip about the gift of afternoon tea when I made a booking, but the other party didn’t check the relevant event schedule, and said “We never engage in activities with Ctrip” without even thinking about it. I showed her the Ctrip reservation form, and the person said I didn't make a reservation in advance. It clearly didn't say that the afternoon tea needs to be booked in advance. In the end, although the afternoon tea was served to me, the result was still quite unpleasant. It made me feel like I wanted to blackmail the hotel for an afternoon tea.

At the end of the check-out, the young lady's service was very good. She gave me a late check-out and gave me a box of Xiamen souvenirs. I will definitely not go there again next time.

Various small requirements during check-in were also met as much as possible.
The swimming pool is great, rarely 2m; not many people, the water is very clean! I have been swimming for two days without any discomfort. I like it very much.
[Naughty] The facilities in some rooms are a little bit worse. The bathroom door of the room I live in is a little bit lax, which makes the bathroom floor full of water. It is easy to slip and fall. It is recommended to take a look.
Overall, I am very satisfied. I am a fan of this brand.

First of all, when we checked in, the lady at the front desk was not professional enough; secondly, the swimming pool of the hotel was outsourced to provide a swimming training class; and, the most difficult thing to accept is that the door of the shower in our room could not be closed. It caused serious water in the toilet area, and the engineering depar**ent could not repair it. Originally, we had to change the room or upgrade the room standard... These routine operations will make the customer experience from crisis to good, but unfortunately the front desk only helps us open We just took a shower in Room 508 next door. During this period, we repeatedly urged whether we could clean up when we ran out of it. The key is that we did not take customer satisfaction as our service tenet, and no supervisor came forward to take responsibility. The gap between five-star hotels is too big. I hope this is just an individual phenomenon and will not affect Accor's brand image.

msg:First of all, in the bathroom, I just checked in and washed my hands, and found that the water pipe in the sink was leaking. After 5 phone calls, the operator didn't have any feedback on the repair time. He said that he would ask the assistant manager in the lobby to deal with it, but he didn't even call to ask about it. In the end, the master was halfway I only came to repair it when I was young. Fortunately, the master has good skills and finally managed to fix it. When I came back to take a shower at night, the temperature of the bath water was very low. The more I washed, the colder it got. It was hard to dry the floor with a bath towel and blow dry your hair. The socket of the hair dryer is also very loose. You can only press the socket tightly with one hand and hold the hair dryer with the other hand. It’s so embarrassing.
Let’s talk about the guest room, it’s okay if it’s small, and there’s nothing you can do about it. After all, it was built more than ten or twenty years ago, but the software is really bad. The international five-star hotel owned by Accor does not have similar latex pillows available, and the room switches are several. The bad one is that there is no socket at the head of the bed, it is impossible to charge the mobile phone, and the desk socket is obviously not enough. The windows are not sealed, the cold current outside is strong and the wind is blowing in the room, and the air conditioning is extremely insufficient. You must wear a sweater and down jacket, otherwise it will be a bit cold, which is not even as good as a budget hotel.
The breakfast is indeed very local, with very limited varieties, not even as good as the local five-star restaurants in Quanzhou. There is no cheese, no jam, and no local specialties. The chef probably came here because he couldn’t get along in a foreign hotel.
It felt good to live in this hotel ten years ago. I didn't expect it to be so bad ten years later. After staying for two days, I was on an adventure, and I had unexpected bad experiences every moment.
Will never consider staying for a third time! It is estimated that other Pullman hotels will not consider it!

msg:This review is for the general manager of a hotel in the same company who stayed for a total of two days.
Room section:
1. The check-in process was smooth, but the front desk forgot to remind you how to use Wifi when checking in.
2. Room service delivery (charger) time exceeds 5 minutes
3. There is no shower cap and men's razor in the bathroom
4. The continuation of the stay did not take the initiative to clean up (poor review)
5. Soft drinks, fruits, cakes and snacks in the executive lounge are almost equal to none (poor review)
6. Hygiene details need to be strengthened

Dining section:
1. The variety of hot dishes for breakfast is too small, and the 6 hot dishes do not meet the standards of five-star hotels
2. The toppings of the Ming file have slag left on the first day, and no slag on the second day.
3. The service staff's service awareness is insufficient, and it is recommended to strengthen training

Service section:
1. Give praise to the morning shift GSM (Men) on May 3
2. Give a bad review to the parking lot position of the Security Depar**ent on May 2

According to my strict requirements, this stay is not enough to reach 5 stars, and giving 5 stars is to hope that your hotel will continue to work hard.
May the epidemic be over soon.

The natural landscape environment is very good, quiet, and the executive lounge on the ninth floor is suitable for receiving friends , the waiter reception is also very professional and cordial; but the interior decoration is a bit old and lacks a sense of ceremony; the lobby bar and executive lounge on the ground floor have few dining options and the standard is not high; the content of breakfast does not match the star-rated hotel at all, and it is not worth it ; used to be in Beijing but went to Pullman for brunch buffet on weekends! The buffet breakfast of a star-rated hotel is a facade, it may not be cheap, but it must be worth the money

This time, I got a comfortable and comfortable experience, especially the gym and swimming pool. The staff on day and night shifts are very sincere and friendly, which further enhances the hotel experience. This kind of genuine hospitality makes me believe that even though there are more luxury hotels in Xiamen today, Pullman Powerlong is definitely an option not to step on the thunder. Yundang Lake has fresh air. If you come, you can bring your running shoes and sportswear to run along the lake. Looking forward to next stay.

I have seen the corners of the rooms, there is no dust, and there are no countertops and floors in the toilets. Water stains, you can especially praise the aunt. The doorman is rather indifferent. He didn't take the initiative to help when he saw me go to the trunk to pick up the suitcase. It was only when I saw that I couldn't move it. Isn't it a standard procedure to help guests with their luggage? Another point is not well done. On the day of check-in, a person who claims to be a manager called me to report my personal information and room number. He also mentioned that we had been out, pretending to ask about the check-in experience, but in fact promoted the buffet. First of all, I have a feeling of being monitored. If I can't get out, I need your hotel to take care of it? Secondly, there is a feeling of being interrupted. I leave it to you to contact me with a private phone number, not for you to sell. It is also very important that the check-in return visit should not be done after leaving the store? Shouldn't the buffet promotion be called on the room phone, or should be reminded by the front desk when checking in? An inexplicable man who reported my personal information, room number, and told me that I was not in the room. Doesn't he think it would make traveling women feel very scared?

What is worthy of recognition is the security staff at the door. The service is very timely, especially in such hot weather. The front desk service is average, there is no smile, and no name is heard from check-in to check-out. The front desk If no one answers the phone many times, you can continue to improve.

The breakfast is quite satisfactory, you can have a full meal, and you have cooked noodles and flat foods. The front desk gave an upgraded lake view room. The noise on the bridge outside the window was slightly louder, and the curtains could not completely block the light (light leakage from the surrounding area), which slightly affected sleep.

msg:The room is very small, and the publicity is completely different from staying. The overall environment is okay, it is located in Bailu Lake, but there is nothing around it, so you have to go a little farther to have a living area. I booked a lake view room. I gave it to the lower floor when I checked in. I don’t know where the lake view is. The window is facing the hotel’s own platform. This is the so-called lake view. I went down to look for the front desk. I didn’t have a good attitude. The manager who went up to take care of things came and changed, but it was only one level higher, and I could barely see a little bit. In fact, it is correct to say that this is a road house, downstairs is the main road, and the lake is on the opposite side of the road. The room is especially small, the bathroom is also small, the bathroom mosaic is beautiful, but the water is leaking outside, and the floor is overflowing outside. I went to Xiamen twice and stayed in North Bay Wanda, Anshida, and Hualuxe. None of them are so bad. The hotel is very old, the decoration is old-fashioned, the room has no paper, the bed is one meter small, the light on the top of the window is also broken, flashing and flashing affect the light, will not stay here again.

在酒店內，我要説的是，這裏的服務真的是超級棒！每一個員工都非常熱情和專業，讓人感受到了家的温暖。特別是在入住和退房的過程中，他們總是面帶微笑，讓人感到非常舒適。

酒店的設施也是相當完善。房間寬敞明亮，床鋪舒適，讓人一覺到天亮。還有那美味的早餐，真的是讓人回味無窮！姐妹們，答應我一定要試試！

當然，每個人的需求和喜好都不同，所以在入住前，建議大家提前做好功課，瞭解一下酒店的具體設施和服務，以免踩雷。但總的來説，我真的是非常推薦大家去廈門寶龍鉑爾曼酒店體驗一下，相信你一定會愛上這裏的！

所以，家人們，如果你下次去廈門旅遊，一定要考慮入住這家酒店哦！相信我，你絕對不會失望的！😊🏨

酒店早餐不錯，適合住3-4天，這個時間長度的話可以吃到不重樣的早餐模式，有本地特色，也有五星酒店常規配置，用餐環境良好。
酒店服務風格是温馨、親切而不打擾，我得感謝前台的ROSE，給了我很良好的入住體驗。
酒店設施稍微有些年頭了，不過保養得不錯，服務上的上心也補足了一些設備上的感受，當然，如果能有一些設施上的更新，確實會更加加分。

小小投訴一下11月3日晚23時左右抵達酒店辦理入住時，前面3位醉酒男士辦理入住時在前台抽煙。希望五星級連鎖酒店還是不要抽煙的好。不過仍然感謝給我們升級到11樓湖景房（可能因為入住時間確實很晚）

酒店地理位置不錯，交通便利，住宿環境比較清幽舒適，周邊環境優美，客房安靜整潔。

前台服務人員Rose態度熱情有禮，對於入住的注意事項均有及時提示，還免費升級了房型，誠意與關懷滿滿。

早餐餐品相對齊全，能夠我的需要，味道也相當不錯。

酒店的住宿價格令人滿意，結合地理位置交通和環境因素整體考慮，相較同級級酒店，房費性價比較高親民友好。

總體印象不錯，值得推薦。

如果要説哪裡可以提升的話，就是早餐感覺不太好吃，雖然選擇挺多的，但是不是很合我胃口，除了現煮的麪和咖啡還可以。

地理位置優越，離鼓浪嶼碼頭，中山路，廈門站等位置僅十幾分鍾車程，二號線衹有500多米，直達廈鼓碼頭；
房間乾淨整潔，房間床品舒適，前廳服務優秀，入住和退房快捷，並且會介紹廈門旅遊訊息，表達得體大方，甚至還有四輪自行車可以免費騎，騎到鴿子廣場喂鴿子，小朋友很喜歡

직원 분들은 소통이 어려운 상황이나 기본적 서비스 요구에 노골적으로 불쾌함을 드러내는 경우가 있었습니다.

깨진 유리 조각이 있다거나, 객실 청소가 제대로 되어 있지 않았습니다.

코로나 때문이라고 하는데, 비지니스 센터나 내부 아케이드 상가도 모두 문을 닫아 있습니다.

위치는 좋으나 그 외엔 4성급 호텔이라고 하기엔 개선할 점이 많습니다.

如果是特價房或事先有説明就罷了，顧客付的正常的價格辦理入住，這樣非常不合理。
附近酒店選擇性很多，這種服務不會第二次再去了。

入住當晚房間温度高，很悶熱，客房沒有冷空調，讓送了電扇，但沒用，一個晚上都沒睡好。第二天早餐7點去吃的，孩子吃的麪包布丁是冰的，告訴服務員後去加熱了，自助的熱菜都是涼的，除了現煮的麪是熱的，早餐連橙汁都沒有。下午回酒店後跟大堂經理溝通後給我們換了房間，但還是沒有冷空調，酒店設施太不友好了。
第二天吃早餐，孩子吃粥的瓷勺上有個缺口，還好發現了，否則孩子的嘴脣要劃破了，告訴了服務員，服務員把勺子拿走了，喝牛奶的杯子有很多都是有茶漬的，衞生情況也非常的糟糕。晚上6點多打電話讓你們送牙刷來房間，等了2個多小時還沒送到，再打電話去後你們接電話的人員又找了藉口來搪塞我。
住過好幾家的鉑爾曼酒店，你們這家是目前來説最差的沒有之一，如果以後還來廈門的話，基本上是不會再住你們酒店了，我花錢住你們酒店不是來享受的，覺得是來遭罪的！！！

房間：房間整體非常整潔，沒有找到一絲衞生死角以及瑕疵，滿足我們的需求。所在房間隔音效果好，除了一點走廊比較嘈雜的聲音基本滿足安靜睡覺的需求。設施還是很齊全，有一點小瑕疵是浴巾衹給我們兩人配備了一條。但不要緊，我們一般自備浴巾。相信這衹是小小的失誤。在第二晚居住的時候，沒有再補充新的礦泉水，也可能是小失誤或者是酒店規定衹能入住時有礦泉水。
服務：服務人員態度好，回答問題高效簡短清晰。有打電話事先了解一下住客需求，酒店在我們離店還會電聯我們丟了東西在房間。外賣在門口有外賣櫃，外賣方便。停車場位置也很充足。
一定注意早餐是十點就結束了，晚起星人比較頭疼。
整體酒店很優秀，就在白鷺洲旁邊，飯後還能散步。
