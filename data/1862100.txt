msg:I’m so glad I picked the Nanjiang Global for my stay in Kashgar. It exceeded my expectations, and my stay was really pleasant. After long days exploring, it always felt good to come home to my room. And given the summer heat, I loved that there was ice cold lemon water always waiting for me in the lobby. The check-in service was great and my room was upgraded. The suites are really comfortable, with amenities by Shanghai Tang. I also saw the standard double rooms, and they were spacious and nice too. The front desk manager who goes by the name Hunter was excellent and so helpful, as were others staff members. Hunter’s English is great and he answered all my questions with patience and kindness. Ask him to write down the hotel’s name in Uyghur for you if you’ll be taking taxis. It’ll be a big help. The hotel is very clean, and breakfast was much more than basic. I hope I have the chance to visit Kashgar again, and I’d be happy to return to this hotel.

After checking in, Aiti and Piredan at the front desk provided thoughtful service and gave me a cute Uyghur flower hat and camel pendant. They also reminded me that there was a very rich afternoon tea, and the taste of Western pastries was amazing! The breakfast was also very much beyond my expectations.

Because I had to go to Ta County in the middle and came back, I checked in again. There was an older brother at the front desk. For the upgraded suite, I was also given a small Uyghur hat as a souvenir. In the middle, I gave the beautiful Nurbia wood lady who handled late check-out and luggage storage, and the name of the check-out procedures when leaving the hotel, which was easy to remember. Miss Li Xue is a very lovely person. In short, the people here make people feel friendly. If I come to Kashgar again, I will choose here again.

When checking in, I enjoyed the welcome dance of the beautiful lady. The hotel also provided welcome fruits. There are many types of breakfast to choose from. The most heartwarming thing is the enthusiasm and meticulousness of all the staff, in addition to the hotel's super heating. Because it happened to be my birthday, I also prepared a birthday cake🎂Wow, Zundu is very happy🥳
Hotel environment: The hotel is clean, tidy and bright, the warm-colored pearl milk tea🧋 color matching is quite healing, and the two large mirrors are simply the gospel of narcissistic people. A casual shot in the mirror is comparable to the fashion blogger hhhhhh...
Then I really like the combination of table lamps and floor lamps. Isn't this ambiguous a**osphere overlooking the night view of Kashgar under the tipsy light?🫣

I stayed at the Radisson, but I was very disappointed. The service and decoration were not online. Global Harbor and Radisson Blu are a bit older than the facilities, but it can be seen that they were decorated according to Shanghai’s standards at the beginning of the construction. The maintenance is good for nearly ten years, but the flaw is the service. I haven’t seen the waiter smiling and the business is not good. Familiar with the mantra of responding to very basic services, I want to ask if Radisson and this one choose me or choose this one. Note: I usually live in Shanghai

The hotel's service attitude is very good, bringing warmth to the guests. recommend.

msg:Before booking, I read the comments and said it was a hotel built in Shanghai. I felt that the style should not be bad at least. As a result, I found that there was no coffee machine at breakfast the next day. It was made of instant coffee and it was sweet. I chose the breakfast option deliberately when I made the reservation. There were 10 minutes left the next morning and the restaurant was not allowed to enter. Not to mention that there was no breakfast in our room, including the fruit in the room. Go to the front desk to find the staff to make up. This management level shouldn't be the Shanghai level...

The ones I bought on Ctrip included farewell fruit discount coupons, afternoon tea and other services. I didn’t enjoy the call to consult about the fruit and so on. I didn’t send it over. I continued to live the next day. The front desk upgraded the house and the fruit and other services are still not available. I think there is still a big problem with the management. After all, the service is not cheap. Going up at the front desk, I heard other guests asked to deliver things. Never sent

There was a special porter in the hotel lobby to help us deliver our luggage to the room. The front desk manager gave us all three rooms upgraded for free, breakfast It is also very rich, this breakfast is very suitable for our taste, very good 👍👍! I also gave me two small gifts when I checked out. Just remember to take a parking ticket when I check out.
