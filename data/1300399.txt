msg:Great stay at Eden Club House. Staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. The entire check-in process was smooth and hassle-free as our luggage was picked up by the staff at the service centre, and there was also a buggy ride that dropped us off directly at the hotel. We were served snacks and tea at the waiting area while the staff helped us with check-in paperwork. One of the staff also explained in detail to us about the various attractions nearby and which ones to visit first. We were also given complimentary pudding. Service during breakfast next day was fantastic as well. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and the service was impeccable, on par with some of the best 5-star international hotel chains (or maybe even better). Will definitely recommend to all who are visiting Wuzhen. A big thank you to 小金 and 小许 for such a memorable stay at Eden Club House!

Service: The service is very good. The housekeeper will contact you in advance before check-in, and will send you a parking guide. You will wait in the parking lot in advance on the day of check-in and lead you to the park to check in. There will be tea and desserts when you arrive at the hotel, and the housekeeper will lead you to the room. (I forgot to ask the lady's name, special thanks!!)
Environment: The environment in Wuzhen is really good. The hotel is located in the middle of the scenic area. The whole hotel is beautiful, clean and quiet.
Facilities: The facilities are good, not very old, but there is no night light in the room, which is inconvenient to get up at night.
Breakfast: Order the set meal in advance, the set meal is very large and tastes very good.

In short, this hotel is very good. The service attitude of the staff in the whole hotel (the whole scenic area) is very good! Good reviews! ! ! Recommended! !

Speaking of the hotel, I was a little surprised when I entered the door. It was very stylish. The fragrance decoration combines modern and ancient, and it feels thoughtful. The room is large and adjacent to the main street, but it doesn't feel noisy. Seeing that we have elderly people, he decisively helped to upgrade the room type to a king-size bed room on the first floor to save us from climbing stairs back and forth. It has its own private back garden, which is small and exquisite with a unique flavor. The breakfast is very rich and tastes very good.

No wonder the rating is so high. It is an unforgettable stay experience, which adds a lot to our trip to Wuzhen.

We booked a superior standard room with a small balcony facing the water, and the hotel sent fruit, which was very comfortable.

I especially want to praise the excellent service, from the shuttle in and out of the scenic area to the front desk and concierge, they are all very nice. Especially the waiter Liu Huifang at lunch, she was very caring and patient with the children, manual thumbs up!

msg:I visited Wuzhen on the eve of May Day this year and stayed at Yiyuan Boutique. I was generally satisfied and had the following feelings:
Good aspects:
1. The environment is quiet and private. It is located in the core position of the central and southern part of the scenic area. There is a private garden and the rooms on the first floor are facing the water.
2. Western breakfast, three adult packages + one children's package, rich in content, can also be replaced by the morning tea guests in the scenic area from 7:30 to 9:30 (unlimited self-service, ordinary limit is 30/person), or it will be reserved for lunch, until 12:00 on the same day.
3. It is specially pointed out that all service staff are online, with one-to-one butler docking. There are inquiries about room cleaning before each trip (according to personal needs), and they will answer any questions.
Things to note:
If you choose a room on the first floor facing the water, pay attention to choosing a room other than the Pillow Water Inn opposite, so that you will not be easily affected by the working sound in the morning. If you have good sleep quality, you can ignore this point, and the flaws do not outweigh the merits.

The housekeeper personally picked us up at the entrance of the scenic area and arranged everything properly. When we followed the housekeeper to the hotel, we were shocked by the environment and rooms of the hotel. It was really great. The hotel is in the best location of Wuzhen Xizha Scenic Area and is in the central location. So we stayed for another day and toured the details of the whole Wuzhen. I felt very satisfied with this trip to Wuzhen Xizha Scenic Area. I was even more satisfied with the hotel's service, which was full of detailed services and a home-like feeling! Next time if my friends, colleagues, or relatives come to Wuzhen, I will definitely refer them to Yiyuan Boutique Hotel in Wuzhen Xizha Scenic Area!

I saw Yiyuan Hotel from Ctrip. I just like the style of this hotel and the beautiful small courtyard. If you want a five-star accommodation experience and attentive butler service, then this hotel is a good choice. The whole hotel is biased towards European style but has Chinese elements. From the hotel From the outside, it looks like a hermit's residence, but when you enter the hotel, it has a unique European style.
The service attitude of the entire hotel is also very satisfactory: the dedicated butler will be arranged in advance to contact the license plate and personnel information. Knowing that we have children, he will prepare children's supplies and children's slippers in advance. I must not mention here that the butler Xiaoyu has been there since we arrived in Wuzhen. He helped us carry our luggage, picked up tickets in advance, and recommended us places to visit and specialty restaurants. He was very attentive and polite, and the arrangements were very thoughtful! Like 👍
I also really like the hotel room. The balcony facing the water is very comfortable to sit on. I also like the Western-style breakfast.
This trip to Wuzhen was particularly satisfying with the hardworking hotel staff. I will choose Yiyuan next time I come back.

Facilities: The hotel is beautifully decorated and has complete supporting facilities. There is also a beautifully designed garden, which is very suitable for spending leisure time in it.

Because it was off-season, we were upgraded to a deluxe king room for free. The housekeeper works well and is responsible. The restaurant waiter Xiao Chen is also very professional. Perfect living experience!

The only thing worth rushing may be that the bathroom in the room needs to be upgraded, but overall it is a great experience!

The hotel room is special Clean, the breakfast is also very good, better than a five-star hotel

We have stayed in countless hotels at home and abroad, and this is recognized as our number one hotel with impeccable room types, facilities, and services. The welcome and drop-off service is very good, full of praise. The floor heating is very comfortable, and there is no need to turn on the air conditioner in 0 degree weather. The breakfast was so rich that I had to pack it in the end...

When we were greeted and dropped off, a young girl helped us carry 2 pieces of luggage. I felt sorry for her and said that we should carry it ourselves, but she insisted. Mention, very touched. The front desk not only upgraded our room for us, but also suggested that we go to the floating market early in the morning to experience the fireworks on earth and have morning tea in Wuzhen, and change the hotel's breakfast to lunch, which was thoughtful and heartwarming!

In fact, I know that the wool comes from the sheep, but I still think the hotel is quite generous 😂😂😂 The breakfast is good, included in the room rate, and the meal time starts from the morning From 8 o'clock to 1 o'clock, you can make it as you go, the quality is good, you can go to the morning tea shop for breakfast, go shopping and then go back to the hotel for brunch.
The best choice for this trip to Wuzhen is to stay in the Xizha Park. It is easy to get in and out, and you can visit as many times as you want.

It was a temporary stay but it was a very good experience. From check-in to the smooth arrival at the hotel, we were accompanied and received by hotel staff. Check-in was also very smooth. We met the lovely front desk lady who patiently answered every question we had about the hotel room. It is very quiet and quiet in the bustling area. It is also very convenient in the scenic area. After scanning your face, you can enter and exit the scenic area at will. You can see the pictures of the hotel environment. btw. The breakfast was great. We had a comfortable breakfast in the back garden. Next time I come to Wuzhen, I will come to Yiyuan again. !

Check in at the service center and have someone deliver you to the hotel. The hotel service is very attentive. After taking the battery car to the hotel entrance, there is already a waiter waiting here. Linlin, the receptionist at the front desk, helped us get the gifts, made detailed reservations for breakfast for the next day, and sent us to the room. She took very good care of us. They also took care of us during breakfast the next day, and helped us pick up gifts and put them on the battery car when we left the hotel. Thank you Linlin and other service staff at the hotel.
The hotel is very well designed and very private. The bedding and linens are very attentive and very clean. The hotel has its own garden and promenade, and the hotel's breakfast is also very tasteful. It is very comfortable to sit in the quiet garden and enjoy a delicious brunch. The restaurant waiters are also very warm and considerate. All in all, I had a great experience during my trip to Wuzhen. I will recommend my friends to check in at your hotel.

Excellent privacy, one-to-one butler-style service, right in the Xizha Scenic Area, the location and service are unbeatable, the service is attentive and meticulous and very heartwarming
Our exclusive waiter Xiao Wang asked our license plate number in advance to reserve a free parking space, booked breakfast for the next day after entering the store, and served Tremella, wolfberry and red date soup after entering the room... What satisfied me most was that we didn’t need to do it ourselves. Check-in and reserving a parking space are all handled by Xiao Wang.
During the epidemic, various inspections, registrations, and signing of commi**ent letters... Xiao Wang helped us all the way, which saved us a lot of time and trouble. Otherwise, we would have to wait in long queues with other hotel guests and tourists, one-on-one The butler service is great! Thank you for your hard work, Xiao Wang! grateful!

🌸酒店的每一位服務人員都很有愛，態度非常友好。餐廳前台的兩位女孩，感謝你們對我的關心，温暖的不止是薑糖水，還有一顆心。
🌸花園餐廳服務的兩位女孩，你們特別棒！如果我説一位是圓圓臉會不會傷人😂😂哈哈！温柔又有愛，我很喜歡你！還有瘦瘦的那位姑娘，胸前好像寫着主管？可惜我沒記住你們的名字🌸但因為你們，給我們短暫的烏鎮旅遊增添一抹亮色🌸
💚💚好吧，最後😂作為一個摩託姐姐，我最大的驚喜是，啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！王一博居然住過這裏😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🌸去之前沒抱希望，去了以後反而這麼多的驚喜！美景，美食，還有最受關注和最温暖的服務…

     五一小長假一家四口從深圳來到烏鎮，衹為小開心第一次選定旅遊目的地，這次入住體驗給我留下了深刻的印象。首先，酒店的地理位置優越，交通十分便利，無論是情侶出行還是親子休閑旅遊，都是一個理想的選擇。
    一進入酒店大堂，我就被其温馨舒適的氛圍所吸引。管家小美非常熱情友好，提前就建了微信羣，提供24小時貼心服務，小美從我們下高鐵就聯繫我們，並接到了景區外的停車場，帶着為我辦理了入住手續和入園手續，帶着我們走貴賓通道電瓶車直接到酒店門口，並詳細介紹了酒店的各項服務和設施。我入住的房間寬敞明亮，床鋪舒適柔軟，讓我們一夜好眠。房間內設施齊全，包括浴缸、迷你吧（免費享用哦）等，滿足了我日常所需。
房間設施完備，很多超值服務，歡迎水果、瓶裝水、直飲水一應俱全，膠囊咖啡，烏鎮明信片，洗護用品用的是歐舒丹馬鞭草香味。我們因為行李比較多，入住和離店都由工作人員為我們運送行李。酒店自帶園林，長廊繞湖，樓閣對望，相當別緻。酒店位置也非常不錯，出門幾步即到烏鎮主河道，過橋的河道北側就是西柵大街。宜園，真是店如其名，住得適宜適宜。再去烏鎮，必須首選。

     酒店的早餐也非常棒，早餐提前一天晚上確認好，非常豐盛，出品也相當棒，服務也很及時周到，此外，酒店還設周邊有網球場、游泳池等休閑設施。

     值得一提的是，酒店的服務非常到位。無論是客房清潔、還是禮賓服務，都讓我感到非常滿意。員工們總是面帶微笑，熱情周到，讓我感到賓至如歸。
     再次感謝小美、小宇等，感謝他們兩個無微不至管家服務，下次過來烏鎮還住這裏。
     如果你計劃來烏鎮旅遊，我強烈推薦你選擇宜園精品酒店。我相信你一定會像我一樣，愛上這個温馨舒適的家園。
     期待下次再來體驗！

        酒店有兩個入口，都很低調完全和水鄉古鎮融為一體，推門進入大堂，則能撲面而來感受到黑金配色的奢華的氣場。這家酒店據説是昔日船商富家泊岸休憩聚會之所，有自己的小花園，白牆墨瓦，荷塘月色，小橋流水穿插其中，迴廊、露台、天井、假山、涼亭等景緻相映成趣。
        在大堂辦理簡單的入住手續（驚喜：客房免費升級）預訂好第二天的免費早餐小哥哥就會送你去房間，空調早就幫你開好了，歡迎水果也放好，minibar也裝滿了可以喝的飲品，甚至電蚊香、防蚊花露水都準備好了，房間有個大大的浴缸，可以泡去一身的疲憊。
        酒店房間的夜床服務會為你打掃房間拉起窗簾，將整潔的被子掀起，墊好地巾，還送了一個香囊喜歡的顏色好聞的味道。
        退房後小姐姐和小哥哥會幫你送上去服務中心的車，如果你想繼續在景區遊覽，他們也會幫你把行李送去服務中心。
        總體感覺非常滿意，值得推薦！！！

高檔酒店該有的設施衞生環境不同一一再説了，肯定是非常棒的，宜園的優勢就是在於服務。
帶父母坐遊覽車到酒店門口，早有管家琳琳在守候，搬運行李不説，到了大堂就有茶水遞上，和我們講解景區情況，免費升級房間，房間有免費水果甜羹堅果和酒水且品質一流，我們出門就趕緊遞上礦泉水和魚食，替我們預約遊覽車；預約健身房，早就開好空調備好礦泉水等着客人去健身；早餐也是該酒店的特色，提前預約菜品和時間，可以當作早餐也可以當作午餐且品質非常不錯，所以我們選擇一天8:30早飯一天11:30午餐；離開酒店時也是琳琳，送了我們當地的特色茶葉、一路替我們拎箱子送我們去車庫。哦！酒店客房還送了每個房間一個非常漂亮的香囊。
説實話，琳琳的優質服務衹是宜園的一個縮影，從酒店大堂服務開始，到餐廳服務，到客房服務，我家在酒店內碰到的每一位工作人員都非常專業暖人心；哪怕是國際知名酒店，每個細節服務也不一定真的可以做到這麼完美吧，我反正是在宜園體會到了。
延伸到烏鎮西柵的服務，感覺這個景區的確是經過大場面接待的歷練的，烏鎮西柵是我玩過這麼多江南古鎮裏最出彩的一個景點了，值得推薦。

        位置也不錯，出門過橋就是西柵大街，又是在大街的中間，去兩頭都可。
        唯一有點不足的是房間的設計，真的是全透明啊！不是起霧玻璃，也沒有任何遮擋措施，一點點私隱都不給人留。能不能想些措施避免一下尷尬，即使再親密的關係，畢竟都是文明人，不是亞當和夏娃。

缺點：我們的房型沒有船，之前看評價以為有船。
客服提前加微信，提前預留了地下停車場車位，不過建議優先停遊客大廳附近的地上停車位，地下的作為備用，因為拉着箱子到地下真的很遠。房型淋浴間和衞生間都是透明玻璃

🧹衞生：酒店設施設備一流，天花板級別，物品一應俱全，有任何額外需要找管家都能滿意！
🍃環境：酒店環境高端大氣上檔次！地處西柵景區高地位置水系源頭，是益大絲業會館原址！鬧中取靜，曲徑通幽，距離各個古蹟遺址博物館距離都近，而且進酒店有船，出酒店有擺渡車，長者小孩非常方便！
早餐 酒店🏨早餐是半自助點餐，三文魚🍣和黃魚麪非常推薦，早晨映着陽光☀️坐在中庭花園，喝咖啡☕️或者紅茶，無比愜意時光，服務也是非常親切熱情；
🔔服務：酒店管家沈棟傑服務一流無微不至，長者過生日幫忙買生日🎂蛋糕，定生日宴包間，還親自取送蛋糕取飯店，感謝🙏，住店期間還給長者安排擺渡車，回程幫忙打包行李，還給長者準備淋浴使用的座椅，非常感謝👉👏
🔔服務：攜程客服713919，要特別感謝，幫忙協調酒店安排行程，貼心高效👍

🍃環境：益大絲業會館烏鎮西柵景區最好的酒店

是烏鎮行程的最大亮點

宜園的私家園子
讓你在這到處都人山人海的十一假期中
還能愜意得享受江南園林的獨特魅力

夕陽西下
坐在房間臨河的露台裏
看着烏篷船緩緩駛過
人間值得

宜園的服務也是絕絕子！
在景區入口碰到了一些小插曲
恰巧遇到宜園的工作人員
很熱心的幫助我們解決了

酒店的早餐味道也非常的不錯
會提前問好想吃的食物
避免了很多浪費的情況

總而言之 
來烏鎮
宜園是最好的選擇

I don’t know if check out is at 12 noon? Need you to urge me? It's fine if you didn't say you didn't call me to wake me up for breakfast or pack breakfast. Is this the service attitude your hotel should have?
Fortunately, I think it is a rare service attitude with high emotional intelligence among all staff. I recommend it to my friends.

I can't give you anything that looks nice.

Look** I just came back to China and I feel so good. I like the service attitude of the boys in your hotel and the attitude of the waiters in the restaurant.
I have a good tone when I send you a WeChat message, but I don’t have emotional intelligence if I just send it to you?

On the first day, I didn't rush to eat until after twelve o'clock.
I feel like this hotel is nice, polite and discerning.
Just buy it with an attitude. You can’t understand what you want.
