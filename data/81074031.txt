msg:I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton hotel, it truly exceeded all expectations in terms of customer service and facilities. From the moment I walked through the door, I was greeted with warm smiles and attentiveness. What made my experience even more remarkable was the fact that they graciously upgraded my room without any additional charges, providing me with a breathtaking view and a sense of luxury. The hotel's facilities were exceptional, offering a diverse range of amenities such as a well-equipped fitness center, rejuvenating spa, and a stunning pool. However, what truly stood out for me was the captivating live music that filled the hotel. The talented musicians created a vibrant and unforgettable atmosphere, adding an extra touch of charm to my stay. All in all, this hotel's exceptional customer service and outstanding facilities made my experience truly unforgettable.

The “Executive Lounge” is located in the lobby and contains a fair selection of Whiskeys and Wines. 

This was my first time staying in a Hilton, this hotel has now set a bar for my hotel experience.

Sometimes there are live performances! This time I stayed in a suite, which was pretty good, and the executive lounge was also okay. The gym is pretty good, with a separate yoga room. Nongmin Lane is right at the door, so I must have a bowl of authentic Lanzhou beef noodles!

You can check in at Zhongshan Bridge at night, and when you return to the hotel, you can also enjoy the night view of the busy city (the sense of Manhattan at night). It is very photogenic. I went to the 52nd floor for breakfast in the morning and was lucky to see the first ray of sunshine in the morning... The 11th floor is a fitness center, with flexible and convenient 24-hour business hours (there is no staff after 22:00 in the evening, and it is very convenient to enter with a room card). There is also a swimming pool on the 11th floor. Next time, you must bring a swimsuit and swimming trunks to experience it. The hotel staff is very friendly, warm and polite, just right. The first choice for next stay.

I would like to thank the short-haired beautiful manager at the front desk for arranging the room for me, avoiding two moves within the store (I booked three orders for six days); and I would like to praise the tallest guy in black with a flat head in the breakfast room, who loves his work from the bottom of his heart. The downside is that the noise caused by the high-speed elevator on the 52th floor is like a plane taking off.

msg:This trip to Lanzhou Marathon greatly exceeded my expectations.
In addition to the very enthusiastic marathon volunteers,
the feeling of 400,000 people watching 40,000 people running is also the first in the country.
In addition,
the service of Grand Hilton is commendable.
It is not terrible to have problems, but to avoid problems.
When I first checked in, there was a little problem.
Because of the different understanding of the package,
I think it may be re-marketed by Ctrip.
Immediately, the first call was Ctrip;
The second call was the hotel.
Ctrip naturally needs to be said, and the handling is as powerful as always.
But the handling of the on-duty manager Ma of Grand surprised me greatly...
Let me tell you a few details.
Since this misunderstanding is not unilateral, he is willing to handle it with greater sincerity to satisfy me;
At this time, I have received Ctrip’s reply and Hilton’s handling,
I am very satisfied.
The critical hit came, Manager Ma also specially upgraded me,
Knowing that I want a suite with a river view,
I upgraded me again...It is close to perfect at this time.
After that, Manager Ma also learned that I was here for the competition and a trip at the same time. He patiently introduced Lanzhou and Lanzhou cuisine. It was over. I fell in love with Lanzhou completely. Just like the slogan of Grand Hilton, if you stay in the right place, everything will be right. The following photos show the unbeatable view of the upgraded suite.

The view from the high-altitude window was nice, the bathtub helped me relieve fatigue for two consecutive days, the double basins were very friendly for double occupancy, the bathroom and shower were separated, the jbl sound effect was also good, and it was only a few minutes' walk from the subway station, which was very convenient. It was a pity for my friend who didn't win the lottery.

First of all, as soon as I entered the lobby, I was deeply attracted by the spacious and bright space and the luxurious and elegant decoration style. The smile of the service staff was super friendly, which made me feel the warmth of home.
The room I stayed in was spacious and comfortable, and the bed was so soft that I didn't want to get up. The facilities in the room were all available, from comfortable sofas to high-definition TVs, from exquisite tea sets to spacious bathrooms, every detail showed Hilton's high-quality service.
The hotel's restaurant is also a place I especially want to recommend! The dishes there are not only rich in variety, but also taste super good. Whether it is the breakfast buffet or the dinner order, I feasted and had endless aftertaste.
In addition, the hotel's location is also very superior, with convenient transportation around, shopping and sightseeing are very convenient. I especially like to walk along the Yellow River near the hotel, enjoying the beautiful night view, and it feels very comfortable.
In general, Hilton Lanzhou left a deep impression on me. Whether in terms of facilities, services or location, it is a very excellent hotel. If you come to Lanzhou, I highly recommend you to stay in this hotel! 😊

The hotel lobby is on the 51st floor. You cannot go directly to the guest room on the first floor. To go from the room to the first floor, you have to go to the 51st floor to transfer to the elevator and then go down, which is very inconvenient. The hotel also has no lobby, and there is almost no service throughout the whole process. When encountering a conference reception, the hotel price has risen sharply, and the manager said that your stay is already cheap... The difference between the two days before and after is huge! I feel that the hotel is very ugly. When communicating, the attitude is arrogant and the words are unpleasant. Such a problem-solving ability and method are contrary to the original intention of being a leader. I don’t know how he was hired as a general manager by the boss. Customers will be offended sooner or later. The front desk pushes the manager and the manager pushes the general manager, and they don’t solve the problem at all.

msg:Lanzhou Shengda Hilton Hotel has the worst overall experience among Hilton hotels, bar none. I rarely write accommodation reviews. Mainly because everyone's accommodation experience is different, so untrue and objective reviews will lead to different understandings of the reviews. This stay experience compelled me to write a review and share it with you. It’s not specifically slanderous, nor is it slanderous. You can take a closer look. I hope it can provide some help to everyone's accommodation. I also hope that this so-called top luxury hotel can provide more customers with services that match high-end luxury hotels because of my stay experience. This is the usefulness of this comment. I will attach a picture to each question to prove the authenticity of my comments. Of course, there are some service items but there are no photos. I can only objectively restore the services.
First check into the hotel. Check-in is not on the first floor, but on the 51st floor. However, there is indeed no obvious signage in the lobby on the first floor. Only when you get near the service desk can you see a check-in sign on the 51st floor on the wall. However, when I arrived at the hotel, there was no service staff in the entire lobby. Another resident told me that the waiter had gone to get something, which meant that there was only one service staff in the entire lobby at that time. I waited here for five minutes before the front desk clerk came over and told me that I could go to the 51st floor to check in. We booked a YOYO theme room. Just think about it, if two people live in an ordinary family, why would they choose a bed with a width of 2m7. I think at least as a top luxury hotel in the world, he should have thought of at least bringing a child. I think this is the minimum. Of course we were traveling with two children. One is three years old and the other is eight years old. The height of a three-year-old child is 96mm, and the height of an eight-year-old child is 1.28m. This is the main reason why we stayed in this room. The 2m7 room is enough for us to sleep.
————————————————————
Here comes the point.
There are no children's items in the entire room. I'm talking about children's products. There are no children's toothbrushes, no children's slippers, no children's bathrobes, no children's towels, no children's pillows, no children's toiletries, no children's care products, and no children's toilets. You may not understand that there are no pillows or towels, but what I want to say is that children are light in weight, and large pillows allow children to basically sleep semi-inclined. But there are no children's toiletries. There were no children's bathrobes and slippers, so the whole child walked around the room barefoot. It is very easy to slip. Okay, everyone may say that the slip and fall was because the child was running around, and it was nothing. So in the attached picture below, please take a look at the various facilities in this room. Are there any potential dangers? I have attached pictures below. The height of the sharp corners of various copper products is exactly the same as the child's face and face. Because there are no children's toiletries, our older children use adult ones. Because the basin itself is designed to be higher than the sink, the toiletries are placed on the countertop, and the glass is poured on it during use. The basin exploded and exploded. We immediately apologized to the front desk and offered to compensate for the cup.
Lanzhou was relatively dry that day. All the windows in the hotel could not be opened and had been locked. The whole room was unbearably hot. When the air conditioner was turned on, there was no cooling. The air volume was set to the lowest level and the wind blowing out was also hot. At our request, Customer service delivered a cylindrical floor fan to us. The fan was turned on all night long and faced the wall to blow air. Even so, our family of four did not cover ourselves with quilts, but covered ourselves with large bath towels. There was an episode. At about 11 o'clock in the evening, we wanted to open the door to ventilate and cool down, only to find that the door of house 3512 is directly facing the corridor, so anyone who enters or exits the elevator has the same view of this room. There was no way we could close the door again. Two adults were bitten by mosquitoes at the same time. When we asked customer service for mosquito repellent liquid, we were told for the third time - it was out of stock! ! !
So what were the first two notifications that it was out of stock? When we opened the minibar, the entire minibar was empty. I called the front desk to ask about it and was told that everything in Mini Bali was out of stock! It’s not that I won’t give it away, it’s that it’s out of stock. Okay, we just understand that this is a feature of the Hilton Hotel in Lanzhou. The second time I found that there were no children's products, and when I needed children's slippers, bathrobes, toiletries and other supplies, I was told again - out of stock! ! There are two things to note here. At our insistence, mosquito repellent liquid was delivered at around 12 o'clock in the morning; as for children's items, only bathrobes were delivered before we checked out...
I work at a desk for a long time and have cervical spondylosis. I need the customer service to provide a harder pillow. I hope to provide a latex pillow. The customer service said that they only have buckwheat pillows. At our request, I hope to find one, but I found a latex pillow for free. I came over and would like to express my gratitude to the customer service depar**ent.
——————————————————
The most important thing is back.
This morning we went to the 52nd floor for dinner. When our family of four walked into the restaurant during the meal, the concierge checked our family room and let us in. My wife was wearing slippers delivered by the hotel and asked to change, so she returned to the room. . I was waiting at the door with my child in my arms. At this time, the concierge and the waiter in the restaurant rushed over and told me that I had to make up for a breakfast, otherwise one person would not be able to sit down. I asked a question and was told that my eldest child was taken away by them. The first visual inspection is over 1.2m, and a full meal ticket is required. I am very confused. According to national standards, all children aged 6 to 14 years old need to purchase a child ticket, which is half the full price ticket. Height standard: Children between 1.2 meters and 1.5 meters tall need to purchase a child ticket, which is half the price of an adult ticket. Why do you need to make up the ticket? I said I didn’t think you were joking about providing services. If you book a parent-child room, at least three people can stay there, and you have to supplement breakfast for one adult. So what parent-child rooms and services are you offering? The service staff informed us that there is a group purchase, and the group purchase is the quotation. Ah, that’s it. The supplementary tickets for adults are at the group purchase price, and the supplementary tickets for children are also at the group purchase price. In this way, I still want to thank you. Thank you for launching the group purchase. If there is no group purchase one day, you will have to make up for an adult ticket! Then I solemnly told the waiter, don't worry, I won't enter the restaurant, but let the children get some bread to eat first. I need to accompany the two children and stand without taking a bite. The waiter said that's okay. After my wife arrived at the restaurant, I described the situation and we insisted on paying for the restaurant's breakfast coupons before entering the restaurant to eat. When we sat down, there was a kid (around 6.7) who kept shooting around the restaurant with a slingshot without any service staff to stop him. Because I was sitting behind my 3-year-old baby, I finally called the service staff. The attitude of the chef in the restaurant was even more bizarre. When I wanted a bowl of beef noodles and asked how to get it, I was told not to talk and just stand here...
Afterwards, the restaurant manager informed the duty manager Sarah Yu of my questions. Sarah Yu contacted me immediately and I recounted the situation. There was also good communication between us. I am also very grateful to Sarah Yu for her professionalism. I made it clear that I was not trying to gain any benefits, I just wanted the subsequent parent-child families to see the real situation and avoid some problems and situations, that’s all. I also hope that you will truly be on the same level as Hilton hotels across the country and not become a special Hilton hotel in Lanzhou.

The hotel is located in Lanzhou New District. There is a Mogouyan Ramen 🍜 five minutes downstairs, and the spicy pepper is very fragrant.
The hotel check-in is on the 51st floor. The executive lounge has a nice view and a wide field of vision. There are resident singers in the evening.
As a Ctrip member, the guy at the front desk stayed on the 38th floor after upgrading the room type. The room service was also very good. My baby suddenly had a fever in the middle of the night. I was given a thermometer and the fever subsided after taking medicine. There are robots for ordering takeout.
There is a swimming pool + 37° small swimming pool on the 11th floor of the hotel, a gym, and a very convenient locker room. # Parent-Child Travel[Topic]# #兰州酒店[Topic]

The hotel lobby on the 51st floor needs to take the same elevator as the hotel restaurants to go upstairs. Every time the elevator door opens, there will basically be three or five drunk men staggering out. If girls are alone, it is recommended to avoid it. I personally felt that the hotel room was too stuffy and I basically didn't get a good night's sleep in the past two days. However, the hotel's price/performance ratio is quite high. Compared with other hotels of the same level, the price is already very low.

Service: It feels like if there is no feedback, you will not be able to experience it. If there is a problem, the service will apologize...

1. When we arrived at the hotel, there was no one to help carry the suitcases.
2. At the beginning, no one told the front desk that the front desk was at the top, which was very confusing.
3. There are no slippers for bathing in the bathroom and the non-slip mat is moldy and even has hair strands on it.
4. The floor of the bathroom in the room is very slippery. Basically every time you go in, you will get slipped.

msg:Because I had to fly back to Shandong at Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport, I arrived in Lanzhou one day early. I originally wanted to choose the Hyatt Hotel. I had a bad experience staying there before, so I chose the Hilton Hotel. Let me tell you about your experience this night. Enter the lobby. . Because I had a lot of scattered luggage with me, I asked the concierge to help me load my luggage in the cart. A young man wearing glasses at the concierge enthusiastically helped me load my luggage and transport it to the lobby. He gave me a card and asked me to give it to the front desk when I checked in. The service of transporting luggage to the room is very good, and the concierge is also very helpful. Thumbs up, there were too many people checking in at the front desk, the management was a bit chaotic, there was no guidance, people queued up casually, and it felt messy. Ctrip saw that the room was 45 square meters, and it felt pretty good. However, I was disappointed. The room was very depressing. It may be due to the room type, but it’s very awkward anyway. I went to the front desk to upgrade to a room, but there were no rooms available. I wanted to survive for one night. When I booked on Ctrip, I specified two adults and an eight-year-old child. As a result, Hilton In the backend depar**ent, can you carefully look at the Ctrip booking information? If you have children, should you prepare a set of children's supplies? Children's toothbrushes, slippers, toiletries, nothing. I called the guest room center, and it took a long time to answer the phone. When I came over, there was a male waiter. I told him that the air conditioner in the room didn't work and it was too hot. He said he didn't know how to do it. I said you should find someone who knows how to do it. The result was gone forever. Bad review. After breakfast in the morning, when registering at the door, tell the receptionist that you need a cup of American coffee. It was never given to me, so I had to ask for it myself, and I couldn’t get a seat. There weren’t many people at that time. Bad review. Everything else is fine

Especially the bathroom space is very large. The combination of shower and bathtub meets the different needs of adults and children. Thumbs up!
A few shortcomings:
1. The hair dryer is really not good and is particularly prone to overheating;
2. The room service is probably too busy and requires constant urging + patient waiting;
3. Even if there is no chair in the double bed room, the refrigerator is placed on the table?

The child asked if he could have more beef. We were rejected directly...sometimes we couldn't even order, so we were asked to wait...with various expressions~ This is really the first time I have seen this kind of service attitude in domestic star hotels~ It greatly affects the brand image!

The bath liquid in the bathroom was empty and no one changed it, and there was a lack of responsibility; 2. The reading light by the window in the guest room was broken and no one repaired it. The flash looks like a will-o'-the-wisp 3. The shaving mirror that is standard in five-star hotels is replaced by a countertop mirror. 4. The pillows do not meet Hilton's standards at all, and the indoor air conditioner is too loud. 5. The smell in the bathroom is very strong, which is not what a new hotel should do. In addition, the lights in the hotel lobby are turned off at 11pm, which wastes such a good view on the 51st floor. In short, apart from the lobby view, there is nothing else to mention.

msg:I came out to take a short break and chose the Gannan Line for a three-day walk. Landed in Lanzhou. When booking the itinerary, I drew lots between Hyatt and Hilton and chose Hilton. In fact, they should be similar. The quality control of regular hotels is relatively guaranteed, and I am not a picky person.
The room is overall very good, the hardware is ok, the bedding and hygiene are fine, and the room service responds quickly to needs. It would be weird for me to choose a twin bed when I go out alone, but twin beds are so cheap! The floor above the clouds will be higher and the view is very good, especially the night view, which is very good. The breakfast was good, the roasted baby potatoes were very fragrant and had the unique sweetness of the ingredients. There is also freshly pulled beef noodles, which tastes pretty good. Ginseng fruit is very sweet. If I come to Lanzhou next time, I will most likely stay here.
If you drive here, parking is convenient and hotel accommodation is free. The elevator to the parking lot is easy to find and very close.

msg:First, the newly renovated formaldehyde smell is everywhere in the public areas of the hotel. The walls and floors are not even cleaned, and they are all traces of decoration. Second, I asked the hotel for pillows and quilts, and the answer was no, because there were too many guests and they were used up. Don't five-star hotels have extra supplies? Thirdly, because I had an elderly person and a child with me, I was asked to be on the same floor when checking in. As a result, I waited for an hour and failed to coordinate. In the end, I stayed on two floors thirteen floors apart, which was very inconvenient. Fourth, although the hotel is on the 52nd floor, it is equipped with a low-speed elevator. The speed is very slow, and the waiting time for the elevator is very long. The overall experience will be much worse. Fifth, the brightness of the night light in the room is equivalent to the brightness of the lighting, and I dare not sleep with the night light on. Sixth, the hotel is equipped with ice dew mineral water, and the quality of disposable toiletries is comparable to that of express hotels, which is the worst quality among the five-star hotels I stayed in. Seventh, the sliding door of the bathroom in the room can't be pulled at all. It seems that I forgot to install the pulley during the decoration, so I have to sleep with the door open. Eighth, the quality of the waiter is so poor. When he came to deliver something in the middle of the night, the waiter conveniently locked the door with the door lock and left it open. When he came again, he didn't knock at all and just pushed the door open. I was seen wearing pajamas in the house. Nothing left. Ninth, breakfast for six-year-old children is not free. I was asked to sign the bill and charge for it. Those who bring children to stay in this hotel should pay attention. Tenth, the quality of the food is very average. The fried dough sticks are not even fried. The Lanzhou Ramen stall also cooks vegetables. They use the same pot of water and soup to cook the vegetables and cook the noodles. This seriously affects the taste of Lanzhou Ramen. Is it possible? Shouldn't it be a nod to the local staple, Lanzhou Ramen? Twelfth, even if you want to be cooler and have better air flow, the air conditioner in the room can't adjust the temperature to the lowest level. I tried adjusting the temperature to 16 degrees and went out to play during the day. When I came back, the room temperature was still the same. 25 degrees, no change at all, indicating that the power of the central air conditioner is not enough, or the indoor temperature adjus**ent panel is simply a decoration, useless. Thirteen, the gaps in the blackout curtains are so large that they cannot fall to the bottom, and the room is brightly lit, so there is no blackout effect. Fourteenth, the fruit plate sent by the hotel turned out to be rotten and smelly when opened, see the picture.

msg:Staying for two nights, when I was packing my luggage and preparing to leave the room, I accidentally discovered that the soap stone was uneven on the bathroom sink where the soap was placed. I moved the stone out of curiosity and was surprised to see an unimaginable condom... ripped open. ... I could see the real thing inside... At that time, everyone was confused and felt it was incredible... After thinking about it for a while, my heart beat faster, I mustered up the courage to call the hotel to inform the matter and ask them to come over and deal with the matter. ..
A few minutes later, a male waiter came to the scene to confirm (with photos and certificates), and also expressed his apology... but did not make any solution to the impact of this incident on my body and mind...
Since I had to catch the bus, I didn't ask the male waiter for a solution on the spot. I thought I would go to the front desk later and give him an explanation! So the male waiter left immediately, and I went to pack the rest of my luggage...
About 10 minutes later, I went to the front desk to check out. There was a girl at the front desk. I gave her my card and paused deliberately. She didn't take the initiative to mention the previous "incident", maybe she didn't know about it yet. Then, I said very unhappily: "There is a problem with your hotel, I will complain to you..."
After many phone calls, we could not reach a consensus! The hotel insists that it can only reduce the room fee by 200 yuan. I proposed that the hotel should apologize in writing (email is also acceptable) or reduce the room rate for two days.
This embarrassing check-in experience left an unspeakable shadow on my body and mind! The hotel's attitude and professionalism when dealing with people are also unsatisfactory...
Such an incident is bizarre and unspeakable...but it happened and we can't avoid it! What is the purpose behind the incident? Something can also be reflected from the hotel's attitude...
The statement of events is true! The negative reviews are undisputed! For everyone to identify!

If it's time for dinner, you can invite friends to the Chinese restaurant on the 8th floor at noon and enjoy the dishes carefully prepared by the chef in peace.

The shortcoming for me was that I couldn't stay in the original room type and left in a hurry! I am a little careful about staying in our hotel. I personally think it could be cleaner, such as the bathroom walls and placemats... The service is very enthusiastic.

During our stay, she was responsive and assisted with any questions or needs, providing us with many helpful suggestions with professionalism. I will recommend this hotel to friends and family.

Everything in the hotel is very good, the staff are especially enthusiastic

It's just that the floor leaked water that night, and the electric curtains also had problems, and they couldn't be pulled down.
Objectively speaking, as a Hilton, this should not be ⚠️ The few hotels I stayed in the small county town of Gannan two days ago did not have similar problems
Fortunately, the cleaning/maintenance is timely and the service staff are very nice and enthusiastic
Hope the hotel takes warning

I checked in on August 9th. My parents-in-law, four elderly people, and my brother and sister booked a total of 4 rooms. The front desk helped me assign floors 34, 37, 41, and 50. Thank you very much for your special "consideration"! And because the trip was postponed, I specifically renewed my reservation on Ctrip for one night before check-in. I asked if my floor could be changed? The man on duty said without even raising his head: "Then you can change the room when you renew your reservation tomorrow night"! I'm not bothering you, am I?
What's even more ridiculous is that our elderly are over 70 years old. I want to go to their room to see if there is anything that needs to be taken care of. I didn't ask for the elderly's room key card in advance, so I have to call the elderly to wait for me on the 51st floor. I also After meeting me from the 34th floor to the 51st floor, the old man could take me to his room on his own floor. Isn’t that a mouthful? Because in this hotel, no matter which floor you live on, if you want to go downstairs and leave the hotel, you have to press the upstairs button to take the elevator. Go to the 51st floor and transfer to the downstairs elevator. 😇😇😇 After staying for two days, the elevator button is quite weird anyway. , swiped the card, the green light was on, and the floor button seemed to be on, but it just didn’t move, or went up or down again. Anyway, it was a mess. I couldn’t complain, and my language organization ability was limited... The executive lounge is located in The elevator entrance is also a mess. Don't call it the administrative corridor, just call it the lobby.

From the moment we arrived at the entrance of the hotel, the security guard at the entrance was very enthusiastic and directed the vehicle to park and helped us with our luggage (the check-in lobby is on the 51st floor, which is very distinctive), from the first floor to the front desk After checking in and going to the room, all the staff are serving the guests with smiles. It can be seen that the staff training of this hotel is in place, and everyone is implementing it seriously! The room is also very satisfactory. Since this is a newly opened hotel, all the facilities are very new and complete. The room is also very clean and warm, and the room has a good view and a good view, especially at night! All in all, it was a very good stay experience, and I will continue to choose Hilton Lanzhou 👍👍👍 next time I travel (especially the point of praise is that there is a nucleic acid testing point only for guests and employees on the first floor of the hotel, the guests are free, the front desk Very thoughtful, I will call to remind us to go downstairs to do it, this is a very heart-warming move in this extraordinary period👍, it also saves running around to find nucleic acid to do it, and you can live with peace of mind 👍)

When I checked out, the car was at the door and the concierge didn’t help with the luggage. The temperature of the bath water was not high. This may be because it was only -2-5 degrees in Lanzhou on the day I came. The hair dryer cut off the power after blowing for a while, and I was electrocuted three times by the elevator button. To go downstairs, you must first go up to the 51st floor.

msg:Lanzhou Hilton and Lanzhou Hyatt both belong to the newly opened five-star hotels in Lanzhou. Let’s compare and evaluate:
Advantages of Hilton: The underground parking lot is more convenient, and the wider Hyatt stereo garage cannot park;
The room decoration details are relatively better than Hyatt. Hyatt is Hansgrohe hardware, Hilton is Grohe hardware, and the toilet is the basic model of Duravit;
The quality of towels, bathrobes, and toiletries is higher than that of Hyatt;
Room windows can be opened;
The room is equipped with a Bluetooth speaker, and Hyatt needs to ask the front desk;
The toilet area is equipped with an independent sink, and the damping texture of the toilet door is better than that of Hyatt;
Hilton Cons:
Compared with Hyatt, the sky lobby is very inconvenient, but it can avoid the interference of catering customers. Personal factors have always disliked the setting of the sky lobby;
It is an absolute disadvantage of Hilton to not be able to see the Yellow River landscape due to its location;
The area of the basic room type is smaller than that of Hyatt, the floor height of a single floor is lower than that of Hyatt, and the size of the king bed is smaller than that of Hyatt;
The overall room design and planning is not as reasonable as that of Hyatt. You can see the bed when you enter the door. If there is sound in the public area of the corridor, it will directly affect the rest of the guests. This is very dissatisfactory;

The last time I came to Lanzhou, I booked their own dinner at the cloud restaurant on the 52nd floor. Sitting on the 52nd floor and watching Lanzhou, it really feels different, especially the sunset, which is very beautiful. Then when I came to Lanzhou this time, I wanted to experience the accommodation first. The hotel is located on Tianshui South Road, which is very friendly and convenient for travel. There is an underground parking lot, and parking is very convenient. After parking the car, take the high-speed elevator and go straight to the reception hall on the 51st floor. The environment is nothing to say, the check-in process is very fast, my room is on the 45th floor, and I have to take the elevator to the 51st floor to transfer to and from the hotel, but fortunately, the high-speed elevator is very fast . The room is large, and the facilities and equipment are also very new. The accommodation area, washing and bathroom area, toilet, and cloakroom are directly divided into partitions, and they do not interfere with each other. There is a small bar, but the drinks inside have to be paid for. I brought my own tea, so I am not interested in drinks. The mattress is relatively soft, very comfortable to sleep on. The shower room is very big. It is the largest hotel I have stayed in so far. There is a big bathtub, but I haven't tried it. The city view of the hotel is good, but if the floor-to-ceiling windows probably have a better perspective good! The restaurant on the 52nd floor where I clocked in for breakfast had a very rich variety. It was still dark after we entered, but gradually dawned, and it felt very beautiful! The hotel has a swimming pool and gym, but I still haven't tried it, it's a pity!

The coffee and snacks on the first floor are very good, high quality and low price. But the dim sum can't be heated, I pointed to the oven and asked, will this work? The answer is "broken 😂"

The lobby is on the 51st floor, and then change to another elevator to go down to the room to check in. You may be a little dizzy for the first time, but it will be fine later.

I like the horizontal curtain very much, it is the same as Xi'an Intercontinental, simple and easy to use. 👍🏻

Service: The aunt who cleans the house has a very good attitude and likes it very much. The quality of the food delivery personnel in the concierge depar**ent is also good, I think it is the golden key certification. 👍🏻

But I still have to say where I have opinions: 👎🏻
The main reason is that the attitude of the front desk can be more positive and enthusiastic. I haven’t seen a smile or warm words in general. The main reason is that I just lived in InterContinental Xi’an a few days ago, and the gap is still relatively large. Isn’t it a level? I don't quite understand.
Anyway, the three nodes (check-in, passing by, check-out) feel relatively indifferent😒

msg:This is the first time I have written such a review very seriously: I want to praise every staff member of Hilton Lanzhou.
The beginning of the journey: There are many high-end hotels in Lanzhou. I called them one by one. The others were probably too troublesome. Only Hilton can maintain normal reception capacity, report and check in according to government regulations. The location is also very convenient, the bus and subway shopping malls are very convenient
Arrived in Lanzhou: Although I am from a city in a risky area, I am not from a medium or high risk area, and according to the national mini-program, the relevant area has also been downgraded, and I have been repeatedly inquired by the epidemic prevention staff of Lanzhou Station. The hotel staff called immediately. And active communication, with some harsh epidemic prevention requirements. Guaranteed normal check-in
check in to a hotel:
The hotel upgraded the room type for me according to the room condition, and the view was very good.
During the Mid-Autumn Festival, Ms. Liu Jia also thoughtfully put moon cakes in the room.
The hotel's food delivery service is very convenient, and the Kung Pao Chicken is really delicious.
The scenery of the executive lounge is also very good, you can overlook the whole Lanzhou from several angles
bathtub is big
Check-out: The staff of the executive lounge has issued invoices and consumption bills in advance, and the check-out is very fast.
Hilton Gold Service Club is a very good choice for business travel and travel, thanks for Hilton's service
Attached are some landscape pictures

msg:The hotel is very new. It is located in the center of the city, next to the subway station, and it is very convenient to travel. The hotel originally arranged the room close to the elevator. Due to poor sleep, I asked to change to a room farther away from the elevator. However, the room I changed to was very smelly of smoke, and I asked to change to a non-smoking room. The service staff were very enthusiastic and patient. It was replaced, and a few days of free breakfast was also given to express our apology for the trouble caused by the room change. Such a sincere and considerate service must be praised. I often go out and stay in luxury hotels of various brands. The service of Hilton Lanzhou Shengda far exceeds my expectations for inland hotels. It is a must-choice hotel for me to go to Lanzhou in the future.

Before this trip, I analyzed the evaluation of the hotel, and I feel good, but after personal experience (staying for two nights), I feel that the shortcomings are still Obviously, one is that the service awareness is not strong. We arrived at the hotel at 10 o'clock in the morning and told me that the hotel lobby is on the 51st floor. Not yet, let me come back in the afternoon, where do I put my luggage? He said, go to the first floor to store it. I said the first floor is not your lobby, why can't it be placed in your lobby on the 51st floor? His attitude is not good, and I am a little angry. The luggage agreed to be placed in the lobby, which made people feel very uncomfortable. In the end, another waitress knew about this and helped us check in (it was still a double bed room, according to her, the room type was adjusted). In addition, the breakfast is average, and the breakfast waiter feels listless.

🔔Service:
1. The front desk forgot to report the public transportation time to the airport, which almost caused flight delays
2. The restaurant deliberately prevaricates and delays the call, resulting in the dishes being sold out, unable to meet the needs of the guests, and the delivery service is completed after midnight
3. The lobby manager (I will not name names here, I hope you can give me a reply before I leave Gansu) is arrogant in hospitality, has a head-on conflict with the guests, and does not formally apologize

🧹Hygiene:
1. Dishes are delivered with hair

msg:The worst 5 star luxury hotel I've ever stayed in. Let’s talk about the staff service first. We went earlier and told the front desk to inform us that there was a room. I went to talk after nine o'clock, and said that I could clean the room in one to one and a half hours. Give us a call and we call back at 11 o'clock to know it's ready to move in. I don't know if we were forgotten or if we didn't take it seriously. Except for the guy with glasses, the concierge is very general. I took two large luggages in the trunk. The concierge just stood by and watched. Go swimming that afternoon. The washbasin also only has the little things in picture 1. There was no headband or rubber band for a lady in the executive room. Breakfast is 168 per person. There is no freshly squeezed juice, only instant. There are not many dishes, so I won't mention this. All in all, it was a bad experience these two days. Today, I got a 145 deduction for the deposit for no reason. I called it and found out that the mini bar is charged. There is no price list when I use it. In the evening, four kinds of fruits were delivered, two of which were not ripe. I don't know how this kind of service can be worthy of this price.

msg:The 400th Hilton Hotel in Greater China is magical! 😄The lobby is on the 51st floor, the restaurant is on the 52nd floor, and the guest rooms are from the 50th floor to the 32nd floor. Through the floor-to-ceiling glass windows of the rooms, you can overlook the city and the city skyline. Nice view! The most enchanting is the shower room, with the same huge floor-to-ceiling glass windows, you can enjoy the night view while taking a bath. 😄The hotel opened last year, all kinds of supplies are very new, especially the linen is awesome! The front desk service is very warm, and the room attendants need to strengthen training! Tea bags and coffee bags were not replenished in time, and the experience was very unpleasant! Stayed for two nights, and overall I was satisfied and praised.

msg:I went to Lanzhou to do business and left Lanzhou for five or six years. I never thought that most of the luxury hotels in the rankings were newly built in the past two years. In the end, I chose Hilton, which is relatively close to my alma mater, Lanzhou. The hotel rooms are all on the upper floors, with a good view. The restaurant is next to the farmer's alley, and it is very close to the railway station and civil aviation bus. The bathroom design is very creative, with completely floor-to-ceiling windows, you can take a shower at night and watch the night view to wash, but I don't know if you will see it downstairs. The slight inconvenience is that the front desk is on the 51st floor, and the guest room is on the 50th floor and below. When you get out of the guest room, you need to go to the front desk and then change the elevator to the next floor. There are too many delicious food in Lanzhou. I eat out every day from morning to night, so I don't know how to eat in the hotel. Another small disadvantage is that the toothbrush and toothpaste kit is too bad, not worthy of the five-star standard. Because other hotels are newly designed, they have modern facilities and first-class convenience. Especially, there is a connection area next to the sofa that can connect HDMI to TV, which is very convenient. The switch you bring is useful.

I have been in contact with the hotel before going, and I have given patient answers every time, and I have not refused reception because I am from the city where the epidemic occurred. After being informed on the afternoon of the 4th day that the flight had a close connection and required centralized isolation, the hotel was very considerate and informed how to change the booking information, reducing unnecessary economic expenses. Trustworthy hotel, will stay again next time. Special thanks to Sarah for her help.

After turning around, I finally found it, but I found that if I went to the left, I could go faster. Hey, the experience is really bad! Also, when I booked a room for breakfast, I said no when I checked in. I went to eat breakfast in the morning and said that I didn’t register. After waiting with the customer for a long time, I was told that our room price included breakfast, and said, “Now you can go in and eat!”, hahahaha! Fun experience! 5 star experience!

msg:Five star Hilton? I don't know where to live up to the five-star standard. Let's go through them one by one. First of all, let's talk about the environment. After entering the room, we found that there are hairs on the floor of both the bedroom and the bathroom, not one or two, but a circle. I called someone to come and clean it, and I explained that the vacuum cleaner is not working well recently? Okay, that's okay, just clean up.
As for the service, I am also the least satisfied. The front desk is like a wooden man. When the guests pass by, you don't ask you to nod and bow to say hello, but you stare straight at people without expression, from top to bottom. I glanced, excuse me, do I have flowers on my face? Is this the etiquette you should have as a five-star hotel facade? Not to mention that the service industry needs more attention, it is not polite to stare at others all the time, and you have taken up the job without training?
Come again, I'm a little hungry and want to order a meal. I started to call at 18:00. No less than 5 calls were made and no one answered. Since it's useless, the phone line should be unplugged.
After leaving the store, I received a call back and raised questions, and told me that I would reply after the investigation, but there is no explanation until now.
In short, Hilton did not leave me any good impression, I will not choose to stay here next time

msg:結論： 服務差評
論據：
             1. 雖然辦理入住在50層，但是不代表1層的迎賓不重要，服務人員（女）在上班時間玩手機，不和客人打招呼是不是不太合適 ？
             2. 不允許穿酒店房間拖鞋去吃早餐，讓穿了拖鞋的客人必須換鞋，跑兩遍。問服務員是什麼原因？ 服務人員（女）的迴應則是震耳欲聾的沉默。如果是在入住時候告知，我能接受。能給我一個合理的解釋，我也能接受。規定的目的是 ？讓客人多跑一次？這樣的服務水平實在難以讓人尊敬。
   
評價： 用一句歇後語總結吧，鄰居門前撒花椒。

其次，不足點是在辦理了入住後，出門進門仍需換乘電梯，有可能的話其實辦理後，在一樓有兩部專梯刷房卡可以直接到樓層減少了很多繁瑣

最後，雖然換乘電梯比較麻煩，但是前台袁經理專業熱情的服務，以及為房間做了免費升級，讓我覺得有機會還是會選擇該酒店。袁經理的服務證明了硬件設施的不足，是可以被服務所彌補的。再次感謝袁經理的升級服務。

msg:半年前預訂了希爾頓，滿懷期待，一行六人住了三晚，實在是有很多想説的。
首先，酒店的位置很方便，離地鐵站步行大概三分鐘就能到，旁邊是農民巷，美食很多。早餐很豐富，東西很好吃，早餐的服務人員都很熱情。禮賓部的服務也很周到，迎賓主動開門，幫忙寄存和郵寄，很便捷。
下面來説下我的酒店服務及設施的一些意見和建議:1.酒店房間的洗手枱下水有故障，下水池的塞子是壞的，洗手池下面的台櫃面板居然是活動的，可以自行打開，裏面是鋼鐵結構件，這個對小朋友來説是很大安全隱患；2.第一天辦理入住時，跟前台交待，需要一套小童洗浴用品，前台説稍後送到房間。從下午5點10分進房間直到晚上近8點送到，中途我打了兩次電話催促，不懂為何客房服務是這樣的效率；3.我們一共開了3個房間，一間房間淋浴間淹水，一間房間空調不製冷，工程部的師傅過來維修，淋浴間地漏全是頭髮堵塞，空調不製冷是因為灰塵，師傅在吸塵。然後晚上12點多，床頭的鬧鐘居然自己響起來！整個被驚醒。在我認為，房間的定期維護應該也是酒店需要做的，定期清理應該是有標準的，不應該是下一位住客入住後發現問題才進行維護吧。半夜響起的鬧鐘、護髮素用完連續兩天沒有添加，這些應該是客房服務在前一位住客退房後應該都檢查好才對吧；4最後就是隔音問題，在房間可以聽到走廊的聲音，其他房間按門鈴的聲音。，走廊可以聽到別的房間放歌的聲音。希望硬件設定可以改善吧。
以上就是我本次入住的一些感受，希望可以幫助酒店進行管理方面的提升，給住客帶來賓至如歸的體驗。

攜程二坑：在攜程訂的酒店無法積分在個人賬户（意味着滿10晚免費換一晚等優惠），無法享受行政酒廊等服務，平台間協調不好。

泳池體驗感極差，小孩像下餃子一樣沒法遊，正常應該是快遊、慢遊、遊玩區是分開的，熱水池水很涼，而且熱水池水不是循環的。

早餐還是保持了希爾頓一貫的風格，也兼顧了本地特色，服務很到位，小哥jerry Liang很貼心的忙前忙後把需要的餐點和湯勺等送過來，感覺很不錯，服務到位了，心情就會好，總的來説還算滿意吧。

感覺好久沒有酒店進出門開門 拿行李了 前台小哥很帥氣 出發前還幫着送到門口 必須好評
酒店位置非常好不用特意打卡網紅美食 周圍拉麪烤肉就不錯 酒店的餐飲就很好吃了 酒店位置不錯 來蘭州的朋友可以放心充
酒店提供了多種枕頭選擇 真不錯 客房服務
客房服務也很貼心還有冰桶 性價比無敵 感覺2-3k的酒店也沒這個服務性價比高

msg:首先，酒店的停車非常方便且車位很多，這一點雖然是基礎設施，但在蘭州能做好的屬實不多，包括某些豪華酒店，來過蘭州很多次，某些酒店一到節假日就沒車位的情況並不少見。
酒店前台在51樓，這種設定在蘭州也不是第一次遇到了，需要換乘電梯去房間，問題不大。登記時前台給免費升級了房型，房間佈局非常不錯，視野也很好。服務方面，雖然當天酒店有婚禮在舉辦，前台非常忙碌，但辦理入住時也沒有馬虎，主動詢問登記了車牌。賓客服務也響應的很快，冰塊很快就送到。
説一下缺點:1.拖鞋質量非常需要改進，完全不符合酒店定位。2.淋浴房門口也需要一塊地巾，衹有一塊放在浴缸那裡了。3.投屏不太先進，需要連接到電視的wifi，如此一來就無法用酒店的wifi來播放電影，衹能用流量。4.洗澡時發現護髮素空了，或者是瓶子有問題，總之是壓不出來。
總的來説，是我目前來蘭州的首選，希望能在細節方面多多改善，在蘭州樹立起豪華酒店的標準。

2.Housekeeping太垃圾。浴缸裏的水沒有放，浴室垃圾桶內的垃圾沒有清理，喝了牛奶的杯子沒有洗更不要説還原了。
3.樓層奇葩。要先到51樓然後換乘電梯才能到房間。
4.早餐奇葩。去的早了些，但無法理解為什麼廚師也會參與到現場吃麪環節，一個個的都來。
沒有寫到的都是優點，但這幾個問題簡直讓我驚呆，好歹你是希爾頓啊，就這種水平嗎？

朋友幫忙裝飾套房，call前台幫忙送五雙拖鞋拿了三雙過來。。。
諸如此類的吧，服務可進步空間不小。

值得吐槽的是酒店前台在51樓，要想去一樓要從入住樓層先上去51樓再繞大堂半周換另外的電梯下去，且，其中幾部電梯不到停車場，就挺不科學浪費時間的。

地段:地理位置特別好，旁邊就是農民巷，附近美食很多。離東方紅廣場、黃河都不遠。樓內還有一些美食，還有電影院。

設施：酒店感覺非常新，房間分佈在33-50層，衹是需要從1樓上來後無法直通房間，需要在51層換乘，使用房間用電梯。電梯速度非常快，倒是沒有什麼影響。酒店的視野非常開闊，景色非常棒，可以俯瞰蘭州。特別適合登高望遠，許願望。

服務:如果滿分衹有10分的話，我會給打100分。和服務員衹要了一瓶水，結果驚喜的送上來一箱。意外的看到了床墊的標識，發現使用方式和標識所講的一致，説明管理維護非常用心到位。

停車:停車場在酒店地下，住房即可獲得免費停車。

周圍配套也不太行，感覺回到了90年代…唯一的優點可能就是還算安靜了，當然也可能是入住率不高…
