We brought an elderly person with limited mobility. Our hotel contact Lin Shirui reserved a parking space for us in advance to facilitate the elderly to enter the hotel, and also prepared a luggage cart and wheelchair in advance. It was the Spring Festival, and there was a long traffic jam in front of the hotel, blocking our way. Xiaolin also came out to direct traffic for us and let the traffic jam team make way. The next day, we went to the ferry early, and Xiaolin asked the kitchen to pack breakfast in advance and delivered it to our room in person. After we left the hotel, Xiaolin also kept caring about our traffic jam and whether we returned home safely. I was very touched that the hotel had such caring service staff, which made us feel the care and warmth of family.

Since we booked a double bed, the hotel made it a king-size bed room when we confirmed it, and directly upgraded us to a parent-child room. The hotel's breakfast was also very rich. If I was not in a hurry to go to Sanya, I would have stayed in Haikou for a few more days. There were no places to eat around. I originally wanted to go to the seafood restaurant recommended by the hotel, but halfway there, I was intercepted by another Xia restaurant.

msg:I booked a parent-child room for two nights. The room is big and has a big balcony. I feel really good! 1. The hotel service is meticulous and warm. A housekeeper surnamed Wang took the initiative to add WeChat as soon as he checked in, responded to various questions in a timely manner and followed up in a timely manner. Fruits, snacks, toys, and small gifts are all available in the room. In particular, when I went out to play in the afternoon, it was raining heavily. I was worried that the clothes hanging on the balcony would get wet. When I returned to the room at night, I found that the attentive waiter surnamed Wang had taken the clothes back to the room in advance, and left a small paper *****. 2. The hotel is on the edge of Wuyuan River National Wetland Park, next to the estuary of a river, about 5 minutes along the plank road next to the hotel to the beach, a long coastline (absolutely first-class for those who like morning jogging), and the beach The view is still very nice. 3. Since I basically run outside during the day, the hotel facilities such as swimming pools have not had time to enjoy. 4. I think I will still choose him next time.

msg:Just state the facts:
1. When I checked in at around 14:30 in the afternoon, I was told that the room had not been cleaned. I asked how long it would take, and the answer was half an hour. Please call or notify me via WeChat after the cleaning was completed. I waited for a long time, and only at 15:58 did I get notification on WeChat that the cleaning was completed.
2. When checking in, the two front desk staff were bickering. They kept their heads down while working, ignored the users, and had no welcome words.
3. I bought a pack of cigarettes at the lobby bar around 18:00 in the evening. A girl in a white T-shirt was on duty. She did not actively greet me during the whole process. I was unfamiliar with the business and overcharged (discovered by myself). After informing me, I promised to refund the money, but the refund was not given on the same day. No one told me how to deal with it. I informed the hotel front desk about the matter at midnight and said they would get a response the next day. However, I didn’t return before 11 a.m. the next day and no one responded. I went directly to the lobby bar to find someone to handle it. The process took 25 minutes.
Just describe the feeling:
Of the hotel staff I met during the entire check-in process, only the young man at the door of the gym had a little sense of service. The overall service level of the staff is not positively related to the hotel room price.

I took out the order and told me that there was a mistake. I was in a hurry to take my baby to bed. At 1:59, the downlight behind the door suddenly turned on. It had been turned off and on automatically the night before, and I stayed up all night. I called the front desk at around 2 o'clock in the middle of the night to communicate. They said they would send someone to repair it. It would definitely be inconvenient to have two children in the middle of the night. After I went to the front desk to complain today, I was told over the phone that their inspection was fine and that it was emergency lighting. They were wronged. I would like to ask which hotel fire depar**ent allows the installation of emergency downlights in the room? Is Haikou special? I happen to be engaged in hotel decoration, so I still have some common sense. I'm trying to find an excuse for this low price. I am a Ctrip diamond member and have never given a negative review to a hotel. This experience has made me completely disappointed with the hotel's service. Instead of solving the decoration problems, I have wronged the customer. This is unreasonable! Ctrip is requested to participate in the investigation, and all guests staying here should keep their eyes open. The above remarks are all true, and I swear on my integrity.

msg:What can I say about the hotel? I stayed in a hotel with a small courtyard. The room was large but empty. Many of the designs were not detailed enough. For example, the washbasin was so small that it was almost impossible to put the cosmetics I brought with me. The faucet would spray onto my face when it was turned to the maximum setting. Outside the basin; although the bathroom is large, the ventilation fan is not good, and the sewer smells bad; the door lock to the yard is very crude and bolt-type, giving people a very unsafe feeling; the bedside light switch is messy and not very good If you use it, the light control will still not work... It feels very rough and inferior. Breakfast also feels the same. For example, the coffee machine can only produce American coffee, but there is no milk next to the coffee machine. If you want to add milk, you can only consider the milk next to the soy milk for breakfast. It is really strange... There is no water in the soaking pool outside, and there is a lot of moss. , I think even if there is water, I will not wash it. The service of the waiters is the same as the facilities. On the surface, it looks okay, but it always feels like they are not responsible and a little impatient. When the card was swiped to open the door, the cover of the card reader fell off, exposing the battery inside...

msg:I don’t know where Ctrip Yishui’s good reviews come from. The swimming pool is basically just a decoration. Because not many people live in the swimming pool, the water is very shallow, only one meter. I don’t know if it is for feeding fish or for bathing. Anyway, you can’t swim. And if you want to swim, don’t come to Haikou to swim. The sea water environment is similar to that of the Bohai Sea. It is recommended to go to Sanya. It is very far from the city center to watch the sea and swim, and there are no shared bicycles, let alone eating and taking out, so it is recommended to go to the city center to find a hotel. Breakfast is very average for a hotel in this price range.

酒店是海馬開的，在西海岸雖然不是超豪華，但是服務比之前住的西海岸萬豪好多了，泳池也很大，就是記得必須要帶泳帽。
旁邊就是濕地，5分鐘就能走到海邊，外海和內河交接處，水流也不小，可以傍晚去看個日落，很愜意。
總體來説，非常棒！也謝謝katy貼心的管家服務。

其實在此之前就已經住過紅燕堂，服務一直如此用心細心。
再次感謝三天裏紅燕堂工作人員對我們旅客的關照，感謝家在澄邁的打掃阿姨，感謝耐心接待的前台，感謝疫情防控人員的付出！

msg:早餐不錯，米粉，炒飯好吃，椰汁好喝，到的時候晚了，10點多點了一份牛腩飯和煎餃，味道都很地道。環境和服務都強烈推薦，尤其是管家王延明，提前就問好我們旅遊的類型，幫忙準備好孩子用的牙刷，浴袍，拖鞋，還幫我們升級了房間，硬件也很不錯，TOTO的衞浴，裝修大氣，泳池有成人和小孩的，還有温泉，雨天晴天都適合。去海邊也很方便，旁邊就是濕地公園，可以看到河流入海，沙灘的沙子很軟，沙灘很寬。因為下小雨，拍的照片不太多，也沒有排出酒店的好，下次來海南旅遊，還要選擇這裏

3個欠缺的地方：1，房間的冰箱製冷聲音太大了，第一天夜裡被壓縮機啟動的聲音吵醒好幾次，必須拔了插座才行。2，房間電視其實不小，但床距離電視太遠，讓人感覺電視尺寸不夠，而且即便是免費的點播也播放不了。3，早餐太過簡單，和酒店檔次不匹配

msg:"Golden outside, rotten inside" is my most honest evaluation of the hotel.
During the whole trip to Hainan, I saw the beautiful sea and stayed in many hotels. The feelings were different, but all of them had their merits and left a good impression. I wanted to praise Hainan's tourism service quality as an excellent player in China, but this hotel took a scumbag route, which deeply discredited the people of Hainan and the attitude of tourism service. Five-star listing, poor service, terrible, "Northern Myanmar" fraud-like communication, delaying customers' time, dawdling, waiting, ignoring, delaying, it seems that the hotel does not have a complete management system...
After clearly receiving my friendly communication and the poor feedback from the guest room, the hotel did not attach importance to the trust with me. During my stay, there was no care and warm condolences for us. Instead, they stared at my Ctrip evaluation rights, escalated and created contradictions, until I checked out and left, they were still entangled. This low practice is disgusting and infuriating.
In the morning of check-in, I asked through Ctrip whether the room would be upgraded. I was still on the highway. In the morning, a housekeeper, Miss Chen, called first and said that it was impossible to upgrade to the room I wanted, and I could only upgrade it to the next level. The reason was "We have to wait until the evening if we haven't sold out before we can upgrade you, but you don't have to wait that late!" In fact, we arrived at the hotel at around 5pm. They were not willing to prepare a room, but gave me a bad room with poor hygiene (as shown in the picture), poor air quality, and mold. They also turned on the air conditioner in advance to remove the odor.
On WeChat, she told me that the hotel had made the bed and made some preparations for the child. I was still immersed in the good impression of the hotel housekeeper in Sanya. I accepted their arrangement on WeChat and expressed my gratitude.
When I arrived at the hotel, the front desk had no smile and charged twice the room fee without saying anything, a total of 900 yuan. When I asked questions, there was no polite explanation, but it looked like we were going to pay so much money. I checked the order and agreed. When I entered the room, I did see the prepared disposable small pieces, disposable bathtub cover, toilet ring, a bag of sugar, small toys, and I felt very happy facing the swimming pool🥳...
The nightmare began after checking in.
First of all, the welcome fruit did not welcome us on the table. After calling the front desk, I waited in the room for 40 minutes. I wasted so much time helplessly, I was supposed to visit the duty-free city.
Second, with such a long waiting time, the child wanted to do homework first, so he asked the guest room to borrow a pen; the waiting time was 30 minutes. At this time, we didn't use the room.
The waiting time for calling the service was too long, and the room was in the front desk building and not in other locations. The distance was very close. There were very few customers that day, Qionghai, Lingshui, Wanning, and Sanya. I really don't know what mentality this hotel is run with, even the service has become a decoration... It's a rip-off! Compared with Wyndham Hotel, it was full of tourists and the response was delivered within 2 minutes.
Third, Dad took the children to swim, it was dark, and there were not many people in the swimming pool. They told us that they must have swimming caps (because each hotel has different management). We expressed our understanding and were willing to buy swimming caps on the spot. However, because the hotel had deposited hundreds of yuan from us, it asked for a sky-high price, selling swimming caps for 35 yuan each, and a family of more than 100 yuan. It was really speechless. After I contacted the housekeeper, the housekeeper said that if we didn't wear swimming caps, others would think that we were favored, and hypocritically raised the price for us by 20 yuan. Finally, we bought some takeout for 6 yuan each and went swimming. It's ridiculous. Compared with Hilton, swimming caps are 10 yuan and swimming goggles are 30 yuan. This hotel can charge exorbitant prices and do whatever it wants with a few hundred more deposits!
Fourth, after swimming, I found that the hygiene in the guest room was as shown in the picture. There were five fingerprints on the windowsill. How long has it been since it was cleaned? Looking at the gray in the corners and the moldy floor mats, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow... Are you scared? Can you swallow the candy that was given to you?
It was already night, so I contacted the housekeeper. The housekeeper asked if we wanted a waiter to clean. We considered that it was 10 o'clock in the evening, and there were various things such as swimming and bathing. It was not convenient to change rooms with children. Besides, the hotel would think that we had checked in and were not necessarily willing to change rooms.
The housekeeper replied to me Prepared a small gift for us (a few bags of sugar and a headrest (we didn't need it); also said they would send us breakfast.
Then, they told me not to give a bad review because of the assessment.
Until now, I still have sympathy, understanding of the work of young people, and the hotel has some opportunities for improvement during the travel process.
Fifth, the problem of room design, the bathroom has a threshold and a door. But the large area of ​​the bathtub and the wash basin is not designed for drainage. Therefore, when using a disposable bathtub cover, how to prevent water from splashing on the ground, keep the outside of the bathtub dry, and the bathtub can also drain? Because there is some water on the ground, the bathroom is facing the bed, and the shoes are on the bathroom floor when you walk out, so I asked the service to get a mop Come.
The waiting time at this moment is still half an hour or more.
I notified the housekeeper again, and it was already 11:30 pm, when someone came. The waiter was very unhappy and did not serve with a smile.
When she came in, I explained to her that I was sorry that the child wet the floor in the bathtub and bothered her so late.
She said with a dark face that the child had wet the bathroom, not the bathtub. Before leaving, I thanked her, and she said unhappily that when she delivered the floor mat, she saw the child taking a bath and the water was outside the bathroom. She asked her for a quilt and something else. . . . . . This is the first time I have seen such a waiter complaining to others.
The service time is more than half an hour, and you are still serious?
Compared with all In the hotel, the waiters all smiled at the children and said it was okay, that children are all like that.
Sixth, when we went out to swim and unplugged the electricity card, we found that after turning off the air conditioner, the musty smell spread in the room, which made our throats hurt. Considering that the waiting time for service was too long, we did not ask to change rooms.
As a result, the quilt rustled and the bed was very soft, which was far less comfortable than other hotels.
After a whole night, the whole family had sore throats, backaches, and headaches.
Seventh, the breakfast was also unsatisfactory. The front desk originally sold it for 88 yuan per adult and 48 yuan for children; it cost more than 200 yuan for a family. Because they did not do a good job of hygiene, they gave it to us as a gift. As a result, the greater the expectations, the greater the disappointment. Fortunately, it was just a gift The food was not fresh, and there were not many hot dishes. We only had a bowl of noodles. The family did not find anything to eat, slept well, and were in a bad mood.
You can look at the breakfast varieties of Hilton. Children under 1.4 are free. All the hotels along our way include breakfast. Even the manager personally serves us when we bring children. This place is less than one-third...~
Eighth, in the morning, I told Ctrip and the hotel room manager about the check-in situation. The housekeeper, the housekeeper and the waiter arrived in the room. The waiter did not admit what he said. I suggested that if it was in another hotel, the waiter would greet the child with a smile. Only then did the waiter apologize.
But the housekeeper just started to make a hard start on the compensation I and Ctrip proposed.
There was no condolence or care for our sore throat. No action was taken.
When we learned that we were in a hurry, we did not solve the problem as soon as possible. Maybe we did not want to solve it at all.

Ninth: We checked out at 9:30, ensuring that the room was intact. The deposit was 900-room fee 455, and the remaining 445, but the deposit was not received until 11:00. (Compared to the Wulan Hotel, which charged a 500 yuan deposit and received a refund message within 30 seconds when I handed in the room card)
No one explained or informed me during the whole process.
Tenth, the hotel had already charged me the full room fee of 455 yuan. They knew they did not do well and admitted their mistakes on the spot, but played the pity card and said that they had applied for the highest internal negotiated price with the higher authorities.
The superficial gentleness was accompanied by a cruel heart. Then they proposed another plan,
First, they asked me to agree to cancel the order on Ctrip (actually, they induced me to lose the right to comment).
They said that only in this way could they go through a process and apply for a refund of 105 yuan, which is 350 yuan.
In this case, why didn't I directly ask for a refund of 105 yuan as compensation when I left the hotel? At the scene where I took the initiative to communicate again and again, when did the housekeeper actively deal with the problem and open the door to welcome guests?
Even if I understood it as "apology" or lack of work experience, I did not take the initiative to appease our dissatisfaction with the stay first,
and there was no guarantee of our rights.
Until the subsequent phone calls and WeChat contacts, they were asking me to agree to cancel the order, not out of respect for the passengers.
Too much, too much.
We gave the agency negotiation rights to Ctrip.
They told Ctrip unilaterally that they had solved the problem when I raised it. (I guess I will be defended by the official after I write this bad review)
Before leaving, I heard the housekeeper say that breakfast was given as a gift. At that time, I felt that I really needed to help this girl.
So why should the hotel management embarrass their employees? ! ? !

Later, I was already at the port, and received brainwashed words from Ctrip customer service to negotiate with me, "The hotel has dealt with the unsatisfactory hygiene in time, and also gave you a breakfast of more than 100 yuan. You have also stayed for one night, so the hotel cannot refund the fee. If you agree to cancel the order, the hotel can give it to you at a price of 350 yuan, which is equivalent to you only paying 238 yuan for the room."
I was instantly furious! ! ! !

This kind of disguised coercion and coercion is really unbearable.
This hotel thinks it is the leader in northern Myanmar.
Do tourists have to be ripped off? !
Are you so short of money?
455 yuan for one night, and you chose so carefully!
There is a housekeeper who explains everything, worries about everything, and makes us run into obstacles everywhere. But he is absolutely not biased towards us.
We can testify here.
Many hotels have upgraded us for free, and also give us the right to choose and adjust the rooms. At the end of August, it is not the peak season, and there are many vacant rooms.
The hotel is willing to upgrade if it wants to, and it is not willing if it does not want to. We just go with the flow.
Besides, didn’t I pay the room fee? Is the hotel hygiene very good? My opinions are so precious, but the hotel is messing up,
and wasting my time!

The most annoying thing about traveling abroad is wasting time and energy. The most annoying thing is that I have done nothing wrong, but some people want to ruin our blessings and hurt my rights, which makes me angry outside!

I have complained to Ctrip customer service here!
I think the service of Haidilao for booking hotels for travel is good.
Do you think I am asking the hotel to give me a discount for no reason? Do you think the hotel is doing charity and pitying me?
Why doesn't the hotel include those coupons from the duty-free shop in the room rate?
I accept such a bad stay experience.
Is there a special decoration in the lobby?
No.
Does the hotel have smart services?
No.
Is the service smiling and responsive?
I can't do it...
Is the cleanliness of the guest rooms clean and tidy, making us feel like home?
No, no, no! The health of our whole family has been affected!

Compared with this journey, I stayed in more than 20 hotels with pleasant scenery.
All hotel services are very gentle, upgraded rights, free breakfast, timely service, cute robots, pool security guards, and we have always believed that we are also very qualified travelers, so we have such a wonderful journey.
And this hotel ignored us, which is unbearable to watch.
Send me breakfast,
I feel regretful,
Lose the big for the small, small favors,
Because we stayed for one night, our throats are very sore:
Now they have come up with such a bad idea that travelers should pay for their own evaluation rights. Who do you think you are? Are you the only smart ones? !
Playing so many tricks,
It's too much! Too much!
You lack money, and even more lack a heart that respects travelers and is serious.
Because I didn't agree to cancel the order,
the other party didn't offer the so-called internal negotiated price for compensation.

A well-deserved bad review for you, such a dark and hypocritical hotel!
