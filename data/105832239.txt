msg:Saw it on the way to Qiongku****ai. The location is very good. You can see the snow-capped mountains and the undulating peaks. It is a very beautiful hotel.
Pictures 1 and 2 were taken on the day of check-in. It was sunny.
Pictures 3 and 4 were taken the next day. It was cloudy.
The restaurant is very good. The dinner and breakfast are both good👍
The hotel waiters are also very good.
The only problem is that the door of the room cannot be locked. I asked the front desk and they said that the electronic door lock cannot be opened from the outside.
The overall feeling is very good and worth recommending! ! !

Facilities: A newly opened hotel, still under expansion, equipped with smart toilets, shower rooms, and electric heaters with full heat

Service: The service staff is very enthusiastic. They drive the luggage to the room. The breakfast is rich and the hotpot for dinner is good.

Hygiene: Everything is very good, but the hygiene is poor because there are mice in the room and a lot of debris on the floor. This is the only shortcoming.

The only regret is that I only stayed for one night and left in a hurry. In the morning, the smoke from the herdsmen's cooking outside the tent was curling, cattle and sheep were drinking water on the grassland, and occasionally horses were heard neighing... The starry sky at night was so beautiful that I didn't want to fall asleep. It was a night in a fairy tale wonderland^_^ Great experience! ! If possible, I would like to experience every room type, looking forward to staying next time~

You can stay in the camp for a day, and the room type is also good. The downside is that one of the wash basins leaked, and the towels were all wet. A wash basin outside was blocked and the water could not go down. One of the toilets was smelly. It was so smelly that I put a water bag in the floor drain to block the odor.

msg:Location: On the roadside of the only way from Tekes to Qiongku****ai, it is very easy to find.
Environment: There is only one camp around them, so there are only their own guests around, which is relatively quiet.
Decoration: The room arranged for us is a Japanese-style double bed room in a mountain cabin, which is very simple and elegant.
Service: The housekeeper and the front desk are very professional, they answer all questions, and the service is very considerate.
Dining: There are normal Chinese stir-fried dishes and earthen hot pot, which taste very authentic. In addition, you can go to their forest book cafe to experience hand-brewed coffee~
If I have the opportunity to come to Qiongku****ai again next time, I will still choose their house, which is very cost-effective!

msg:It's still very good, the facilities are of good quality, and the bedding is very comfortable. It was windy outside at night, but the tent was not cold with the electric heater on. The clouds started to rise at 12 o'clock in the evening, but it was cloudless after 2 o'clock. I saw the Milky Way and shooting stars in the starry sky. I also saw the moon when I came out at almost 5 o'clock. Although it is a public bathroom, the water in the bathroom is large and the heat is sufficient, so it is very convenient to take a shower.
The breakfast is relatively simple, and coffee needs to be ordered separately, but there are also some special flavors. There are several kinds of jams, all of which are delicious, and the stir-fried dishes taste very good. There is no yogurt.
Disadvantages: There is a water heater in the bathroom that drips a little and needs to be repaired.
Overall, it is worth recommending and cost-effective.

msg:As the number one luxury hotel in Ili, it is true to every word. It is not only wild enough, but also luxurious enough. In order to experience it, I stayed in a very cost-effective double tent this time, so that I could experience the feeling of camping without setting up camp by myself. Compared with other tents priced around 2k, this double tent is a great value. There are public bathrooms and toilets at the highest point of the camp, which is very convenient! There are two single mattresses in the tent, with power supply and heater! It is high enough to stand up, not depressing, and is also the quality of a big brand tent! The tent has a plank platform and a private awning where you can sit inside! The friendly butler at the front desk is handsome and considerate, and the luggage is delivered to you! An all-day restaurant and a specialty restaurant, the taste is absolutely delicious and the price is very reasonable! They are all landscape level! Of course, the most interesting thing is the book cafe. There is a small cabin there, and there is also a business cat. It is said that it is the general manager’s cat and he is called the best employee. Guest update! Hahaha, it’s so cute~ The campground is located in the core area of ​​Qiongkush Terrace. When you walk to the top of the mountain, you can see the beautiful scenery of the back mountain~ There is coffee and coffee, and it is quite good. The coffee in the all-day restaurant is fragrant, and the book cafe is good. Chong, the barista is a warm girl, a little beauty~ Listening to the wind at night is very warm, there are cows mooing, dogs barking, birds chirping, and there are people haha, it's quite fun! [Exquisite wild charm, lying on the grassland, looking at the mountains and sea] A unique holiday feeling, I give it full marks 💯, especially the management service team's attentive group service, the general manager personally serves, responds to all requests, and is very respectful!

Service: The housekeeper and front desk staff are all young, very humorous and easy to communicate with. I like them very much~
Environment: It is still a little far away from the village of Qiongkushtai, but the scenery is also very good and the view is very broad.
The forest book cafe is great for taking photos, it is full of quaint a**osphere, and I could sit here all day with a cup of coffee.
Catering: Each room provides two buffet breakfasts🥣. You need to order other meals by yourself, and the overall price is acceptable🉑️.
There are various stir-fried dishes, and there is also a barbecue area where you can order mutton skewers. We also ordered the local hot pot, which tastes good👍🏿
Overall: Recommended

We stayed in many unique homestays during the Xinjiang loop, but only this one was great value for money. So as soon as we got here, we quickly canceled several of the following trips, slowed down here, and slowly felt the beauty here. Next time I come to Qiongku, I will choose Wild Luxury again, and I must stay a few more days next time. Cows will knock on the door in the morning, and the rooms and facilities are very good. The coffee here is also superb. It is really a happy thing to be able to drink coffee in more than half of the Xinjiang trip.

The lady at the front desk also upgraded our room type (tent). The mattress and pillows were very comfortable and clean. It was almost twelve o'clock and I had to trouble the guy to get the lights and chairs several times. The weather was very good and the starry sky was so beautiful. It was fun to stay in a tent for the first time, haha. But the small heater didn't work very well. It was still too cold at night. 
When I woke up in the morning, the view outside was superb. The breakfast was also delicious. It was a pleasant stay. Recommended!

msg:I have followed the trend and become addicted to camping. Although it was windy and rainy for half the night, I needed to turn on the heater to cool down. The quilt was good in winter. The quality of the tent was good and there were no near misses. The camp environment was very good. The back mountain is a pasture. You can ride horses and be woken up by the cows in the morning to watch the sunrise. It is also very rare. My experience is that the facilities in the tent are ok, but the bathroom is shared and I can’t take a shower. The toilet near the camp has hot water. The toilet is actually a shepherd’s haven. The environment is average but understandable, so I wash up in the toilet of the restaurant. PS: There is room for improvement in breakfast. Emergency urine bags should be provided for guests staying in tents. It is very necessary for those who cannot leave the tent to go to the toilet on rainy nights. Overall, I am satisfied.

We paid extra to stay in the forest cabin suite. There is a terrace at the door of the room, which is very holiday! And every window in the room looks like a painting. It is definitely the most comfortable hotel in the whole Xinjiang trip~ I heard that a barbecue area is being built now. If there are more choices of food in the future, it will be more worthwhile to come~ It is very suitable to stay here for a few days. If you have requirements for hotel facilities and environment, you must come~~

2. There is water left by the previous guest in the kettle, and it is not poured out!
3. The towels and foot mats are stacked together, which is outrageous
4. The bathroom is extremely smelly. It was okay when I first checked in, but it started to smell bad at night after I checked in, and it was useless to close the tent.
Other dogs barking, cows barking, sheep barking all night, etc. are understandable, but they can't keep it clean

管家的服務也非常的奈斯，熱情以及會給予一些比較周到合理的遊玩攻略

營地環境超級漂亮，感覺就是一個濃縮版的瓊庫什台，可以看到草原，森林，小溪，還有秋千可以坐，營地裏面有書咖，還可以點燒烤，不得不説的是，土火鍋真的很好吃！營地有自己的一個後山，爬上去可以看落日，往下看營地好像一個愛心的形狀，在山頂全身心感受到自然帶來的震撼。
營地的服務人員都很熱情，房間配有管家，有什麼需要聯繫管家，他們都會盡力幫忙處理，讓人感覺很貼心，也能感覺到他們的關係很好，整個氛圍很融洽。
住在這裏又有高級酒店的設施和服務，也能感受到民宿的熱情和温馨，我們一行人都很滿意。

msg:住的帳篷房，應該是住過最好的單人帳篷，透氣防水卧具五星。但最大的安全隱患是竟然帳篷裏有交流電插座，據説是為了充電和取暖設備。估計管理人員沒有經驗，這些裝置為了客人方便。但帳篷裏空間很小，水瓶啥的一倒容易走電，取暖燒水裝置容易引起火災。已經向工作人員反應，態度很好表示會向領導反映。另外就是公共衞生間和淋浴間有很大提升空間，衞生間很臟和普通民宿沒啥大區別。男淋浴衹有一間，非常非常小🚿是壞的，水一放直接從開關處直噴出來，洗了個⛲️浴。酒店的選址很好，風景不錯，雪山雲杉林，看得到人體草原。早餐食材很新鮮。希望以後能做得更好

msg:設施：為了舒適選擇了套房…浴缸我入住時是擺設…沒有接上下水，但並未提前告知。套房的水吧那一組插座沒通電，也導致了一夜沒有暖氣。晚上蠻冷的。這也沒有告知。
衞生：床品不錯，衞生不錯。
環境：硬件不錯。整個瓊庫什台很美。
服務：槽點滿滿，整個旅行中最失望的一家，與價格嚴重不符。從入住開始拿行李箱就説等一會兒。同行定的房間味道很大，配置的管家説“或多或少都有的”，然後她們換了帳篷房，離譜的是，在她們入住後，我們站在餐廳看到兩名工作人員在帳篷門口的桌椅上坐着休息打鬧，然後兩人還鬧着進了房間，過了一會兒又出來坐着…反饋給前台，前台回覆再打掃衞生。
再説我的房間，行李放在車邊沒人管，説過會兒來拿…然後等了半個小時後送到了，進來説過會兒給我發酒水單及菜品，我到離店也沒發。詢問有無小童牙刷和拖鞋，直接回答沒有，後在我的質疑下説“幫你問一下，我不太清楚”，後出門用餐的時候拿過來了。詢問的問題四五十分鐘後給予回覆，打了前台，前台説一會兒我加微信發給你，離店也沒有收到好友通知。總的來説客房人員不專業，不能解決問題，讓人非常失望，一晚房價近3k的服務完全不掛鈎，我們不需要誇張的服務，至少需要能幫客人解決正常問題的能力…
後我在小紅薯吐槽後，負責人聯繫到我，有道歉，也讓管理人員跟我溝通了一下，説人員新來的，培訓沒有到位。也提出了想要補償一下，雖然被我拒絕了，但至少管理層是想為錯誤負責的。
還是那句話，希望你們的管理能夠完善，不誇張的説，這一路的住宿，服務體驗最差的一次。導致我現在入住了新的住宿，管家的熱情又形成了更強烈的對比。雖然也許是個別員工現象，但對客人來説，真的很不理想。
大美的新疆，美麗的瓊庫什台，不要誤了這麼美的風景。

景色是沒得説了   就是棒   就連停車場都是觀景位      要是天氣好就很無敵 
服務人員也都很熱情  能感受到年輕人的朝氣   
晚上在餐廳小酌了一杯  先問了能不能做某種特調  答覆是可以   但是實際因為材料不夠  等於就上了一杯基酒   而且是按原價收費的    
可以理解為經驗不足  當時因為心情不錯也就無所謂了   但是實際操作可以有更好的應對方式   讓客人更加滿意
希望店家可以不斷進步  越做越好

   歡迎來到中國新疆！！這次從賽里木湖過來到喀拉峻，來到瓊庫什台周邊最終決定在柏雅瓊谷灣這個營地住下。整個營地區域很大，但是感覺很多東西還沒完善。聽管家説是還在試運營階段，不過已經能感受到他們的定位了，個人感覺算是輕奢型的。
    房間軟裝設計這塊兒真的很贊👍🏻有點想要設計師的聯繫方式以後我自己開民宿的時候諮詢一下嘿嘿
    餐廳很大，吧枱做的很不錯，可以喝咖啡喝調酒，這次還遇到了新人拍婚紗照，不錯不錯，感覺這兒以後會大火！主要是場地夠大可以接得住！

環境：前有草原背靠雪山，環境如圖！

設施：剛建好，還沒正式對外營業，試營業階段，智能廁所，熱水器儲水，洗澡舒暢，重點是還有地暖！！！

服務：因為是第一個客人，試營業衹有前台和管家，兩個小姐姐，服務很貼心！還會詢問睡得好不好，有沒有需要的東西等等～

衞生：因為剛試營業看着都很乾凈，但是早起看到阿姨在挨個房間打掃，所以應該日常維護不錯！

缺點：走路的時候衞生間的門會輕微晃動，可能是因為搭在鐵架上，不過影響不到睡眠。

總體：整體能在周圍住宿條件很差的地方找到一個這麼舒適的酒店還有美景還是很值得的！
