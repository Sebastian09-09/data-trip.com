msg:This is the most beautiful hotel in China. The experience that we have is unforgettable. The hotel itself  is a major attraction inside the Westlake. There are tons of thousands of tourists visiting Westlake, but only the guest of this state guest house can enjoy the gardens and attractions inside the hotel. It offer a unique experience that you can find calm and peace visiting Westlake. ￼

Comes with a compliment of the right weather as well as the fresh air. Location wise I’ve rated 5 stars because it is also situated very close to a few popular restaurants. 
Highly recommend this place even if you travel with young kids.

Area inside the hotel is extremely quiet. Staff and service are excellent. Foreigners may have trouble with communication, as staff speaks Mandarin mostly. However that is expected, as the hotel is typically reserved for Chinese state officials.

The hotel offers everything a traveller may need which makes up for its location which is slightly isolated. Do note on weekends taxis may be reluctant to travel there due to road closures and congestion. Service wise I would advice you have a basic grasp of mandarin as the staff don’t speak English- hyatt or 4 seasons would be a better fit for English speakers

The dishes in Ziwei Hall are worth tasting with color, fragrance and taste, and the service is also delicate and thoughtful.

The facilities in the room of Building No. 1 this time are complete, comfortable and high-end. Every utensil and decoration are carefully crafted works.

The first garden of West Lake is really worthy of its reputation, steady and far-reaching, and is on par with the world's first-class high-end boutique hotels.

msg:This time I stayed in Building 8, and I felt more comfortable than I did in Building 7. The room was spacious, bright, high, and breathable. Two bowls of fruit were given upon check-in, which were cherries and blueberries. They were quite big. Four bottles of Nongfu Spring were given in the room, but the taste of boiled tap water was also very good, with a slight sweetness at the first sip, indicating that the water quality was good. The room also had a paid 4-liter bucket of Tiger Run water, and the price was acceptable. But there were some things I wanted to complain about this time. First of all, the slippers in the room were very special and comfortable, but there was a "squeaky" friction sound when walking in places without floors, and it was easy to disturb others when getting up at night. The room was not cleaned very carefully, and there was a large clump of hair wrapped around the water pipe of the shower. I thought it was left by my mother before, but then I thought that my mother had short hair and didn't have such severe hair loss, so it could only be left by the previous guests. (Horrible), the sound insulation of the room was a bit problematic, the guests next door talked and made some movements, and the bear children downstairs threw stones and laughed and played in the courtyard, including someone smoking on the balcony (with an ashtray), and the smell of smoke would drift over. The thing I want to complain about the most is the front desk check-in staff. It seems that they have not been trained. They either shout loudly to each other like they are buying vegetables in the market and laugh happily, or they are indifferent to the guests. I don't feel the warm and thoughtful service at all! Do these people match such a beautiful scenery? Are they all front desk staff hired through backdoors? The waiters in Ziwei Hall are also indifferent and seem to have not been trained. They are cold, stiff and abrupt. Changing dishes is very stiff and does not match the soft, delicate and gentle city image of Hangzhou. And the dishes in Ziwei Hall are hard to describe. There is no such thing as color, fragrance and taste. It is very ordinary and ordinary, not as delicious as the Internet-famous tea restaurants in Shanghai. The service is not good either. It's hard. What needs to be praised is that the courtesy guards sent us to the door of the room. We wanted to go to Maojiabu and enthusiastically recommended that we go through the middle door to get closer.

Needless to say, the overall service, from check-in to the attentiveness of the housekeeping aunt and the humane service of Ziwei Hall, makes people feel more cordial.

The catering quality of Ziwei Hall is really good, worthy of the quality of the state banquet. I tried classic dishes and new dishes, and none of them were disappointing, which was very satisfactory~
Daily welcome fruit: good quality varieties, cherries, mangoes🥭, lychees, and sugar apples, quite a surprise.
MINIBAR in the room: All varieties are free to enjoy, including the beer inside~ I thought it was only once, but I didn’t expect to restock it the next day~
Service: The hotel’s overall service is good, whether it is service reception, cleaning aunt, restaurant service, or even armed police security. The concierge car is available on call, which is convenient for entering and exiting the park; the travel photography service provided by the package, Asen was very patient, took beautiful photos, and did not deliberately promote buying more photos, the experience was very comfortable. Finally, he helped me send the forgotten sunglasses, thank you very much! When we checked out, we used the business car provided by the hotel concierge. The service attitude of Master Jiang was also very good. He took the initiative to introduce various local customs and practices along the way, which made my mother happy all the way. In short, except that the room was a little small, everything else was a good experience. I will come again.

Facilities: The suite is a true inside and outside room, with a separate guest bathroom in the living room. There is a small yard outside the bedroom, which feels good. The bathroom shower room is more modern and comfortable than in Building 1. It is said that there are only two sets of this room type, which is relatively cost-effective among suites. Many utensils, furnishings and decorations in the restaurant and rooms are very elegant, revealing the sophistication and care of Jiangnan people.

Environment: The hotel campus is large, but quiet and comfortable, with both ancient elegance and modern aesthetics. The State Guesthouse really has an extraordinary temperament. It feels like living in a park, which is very suitable for long-term recuperation. (Think of its historical uses)
Service: Friendly, warm and professional. I especially want to praise the waiter in the Chinese restaurant, but unfortunately I didn’t write down his name.

Xiaowan Travel Photography: It is a travel photography company that cooperates with the hotel and is highly recommended for hotel guests. This company also provides door-to-door make-up (clothing, make-up, hair accessories) at the hotel for an additional fee. It seems a little expensive at first, but after enjoying the service, it feels like it’s worth it. This kind of collaborative service between the photographer and makeup artist under one company has a tacit understanding in terms of prop matching, follow-up and makeup retouching, etc. The travel companion in another room took photos the day before and was very satisfied with it, so he booked it again the next day. It happened to be raining. As the name suggests (and also the name of the company), the photographer Lele is always smiling. While waiting patiently, he negotiated with the hotel for indoor shooting. Then he let me hold an umbrella while he shot in the light rain. The rain stopped. Later, we took a limousine car to select the location based on the costumes, which was delayed for more than an hour (it happened to be that there were no guests later), which was touching. The makeup artist surnamed Tang Yuan Zhuangzao was more meticulous and more patient than me. He also matched my hair accessories with the outfits I chose elsewhere, and also modified my makeup according to different outfits. Thank you very much. By the way, I would also like to thank the photographer Lele for matching the costumes with rich and appropriate props, and guiding the movements to create a very different style of effect, which was amazed by relatives and friends.

The attached video is of the unexpected lobby, and the photos are of afternoon tea, breakfast room garden view and travel photos.

msg:The West Lake State Guesthouse, which I have long admired, is the first famous garden. I booked a three-day and two-night trip during the off-season after the May Day holiday. It was a very pleasant stay! The courtyard environment is very good. We stayed in Building 3, which is only 200 meters away from Building 1 and Building 2. It is directly close to the West Lake and enjoys the beautiful scenery of the West Lake! We brought our children, and the children can jump on the green lawn to their heart's content! We are in a garden view king-size bed room, which is decorated in an antique style with magnolia wall decorations, very classical! For dining, we ordered a double set meal in the Ziwei Hall, which felt pretty good! The buffet is also OK; we also experienced the red food box in the red bar, and the children were very happy! In short, two words: worth it!

I thought the rooms in Building 8 were old, but after checking in, I found that the facilities were very new, the rooms were large, and there was a small yard where you could drink tea outdoors. The hotel's garden is very beautiful. There are Mao Zedong's snow-watching place and Mao Zedong's English learning place in the garden, which is very historical. Because the hotel itself was rebuilt from the original Liu Garden, a famous garden in West Lake, Liu Garden itself is a famous place. Standing in the yard, you can see the entire Su Causeway and Leifeng Pagoda, which is very worth staying.
I was impressed by the breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet, which tasted very good.
The hotel room is very clean, and two kinds of fruits are delivered every day.

msg:We were originally traveling from Shanghai to Huzhou, passing through Hangzhou, and wanted to see the West Lake, so we came to the long-awaited Hangzhou State Guesthouse. First of all, the environment is really top-notch, worthy of being known as the first garden of West Lake, with a view at every step. At first, my mother was a little entangled in choosing which building number, but the little brother at the front desk patiently asked us to look at the lakeside room in Building 2, the Qingyi room in Building 7, the courtyard room in Building 8, and finally the Qingyi room in Building 7. The room has a balcony, and you can overlook the West Lake in the distance from the balcony. It is so beautiful, and it feels like an exclusive courtyard.
Walk around the park to see the West Lake, the exhibition hall, and the history of the State Guesthouse. It took an afternoon to walk around and see. The breakfast was also very rich. I ate so much that I couldn’t eat lunch, hahahaha.
It happened that the May Day holiday was coming soon, and the West Lake was already crowded. However, the State Guesthouse is large and the West Lake is rippling with green waves. It is comfortable and pleasant. The most important thing is that you don’t have to squeeze with others to take pictures. The hotel has travel photography, and brother Lele helped with the photography for more than an hour. He took a lot of good pictures, and added a lot of photos at the end. It was a very pleasant trip. Next time I go to Hangzhou, I will stay here again.

There are two beds but only one plug at the bedside. Any sound from the corridor can be heard in the room. The door of the room is very loud and noisy.

Traveling alone, plus I don't have a big appetite, it's difficult to order food, so I ordered room service, and the three-fresh wontons were surprisingly delicious. The day I left Hangzhou was Saturday, and the traffic was limited. The taxi app couldn't locate the hotel, which was an accident. Next time I stay in the hotel, I will try to avoid weekends and holidays.

Afternoon tea for two: I didn’t have the right to use it because of the tight time, but the environment is still good.

In short, it is a hotel worth traveling with your family and suitable for all ages.

msg:I have stayed in Building 8 and Building 2 of the State Guesthouse. This time, I booked Building 7 for cost-effectiveness and was still very satisfied. Building 7 is located near the north gate and is quiet. Some of the Qingyi rooms face the West Lake, but the trees are too high and too dense to cover them. The situation of each building: Building 2 is the newest, Building 8 is second but the garden is the most beautiful, and Building 7 is slightly older, which is in line with the pricing of each room type. In Building 7, only the carpet is dirty and old, and the sofa with footstool has a smell of oil on the headrest. Everything else is satisfactory. The room has no odor, which is particularly rare and well maintained! The quality of fruits, supplies, and towels is very good. There is a night bed service, and the room service is responsive. Fruit knives are provided according to my request. The hotel will have limited traffic on weekends and holidays, and takeaways need to be picked up by electric vehicles at the south gate. The room I live in now has a smell of smoke. I have also encountered a smoke-smelling room when I stayed in Grand Hyatt before. I hate the smell of smoke the most. I still have it when I open the window for ventilation. There are earplugs for noise, and the smell of smoke really drives me crazy. I will probably only book the State Guest House in the future, as I have never encountered a room with a smoky smell here. Overall, the State Guest House has a first-class green location, and the staff I met are of high quality, so it is worth the price.

Environment: The room environment is okay ~ 8121 ~ There was a gecko on the first day of check-in. I didn't call the front desk immediately ~ Mainly, I know they will definitely say that you live in a luxurious courtyard with mountains and water. This is the case. (Sure enough, after checking out, I asked if you had any measures in place, and their answer was exactly what I thought)
Service: The lobby service is OK~The aunts who clean the room are also OK~I want to complain about the food chefs at the buffet, none of them has a smile on their face! I know that until now at the buffet, when people asked you questions, you would respond with a smile, but they were almost indifferent. I didn't like this very much.
Meals: Eating the buffet once is enough~ Why? I’m going to complain again~ I ate it twice, once at noon and once at night. I want to see the difference~ The fried steak at night (it’s almost not on the table, it’s all fried fish~ The steak only needs to be fried for one round~ The following ones Fry the fish for at least two rounds~ Anyway, you want to eat steak~ The probability is 20%), let’s talk about steamed seafood~ Xiao Qinglong, haha ​​I have to complain again, maybe for the sake of hunger marketing, I don’t want everyone to eat too much. You can’t steam a few of these things when steaming them. Once they are steamed, they take a long, long time. I think they are deliberately not eaten. Otherwise, you can put them in several drawers and steam them!

Ziwei Hall: It’s worth it to eat here once! But you do need to make a reservation~

Finally, I complained about the courtyard of my room. Workers were coming and going. When I checked out, I asked the front desk. They told me that this is indeed the case in my room. Damn it, I definitely don’t want this room if it is like this. There is no privacy. Got it~

I will choose this place again when I come to Hangzhou in the future.

The hotel environment is as beautiful as ever, like a big park.
In the misty drizzle, the air is fresh and moist, and it is very pleasant to stroll in the garden holding an umbrella.
The service at West Lake State Guesthouse is becoming more and more warm. I hope to arrange a room with a good view. The window opens onto an inner lake. Waking up to the chirping of birds in the morning makes me feel like I am living in a painting.
I still choose Building 3. Although the room is not too big and the furnishings are no longer fashionable, the advantage is that the layout is reasonable, everything is available, and the details are warm.
There are welcome fruits every day, as well as safety and security packages.
This time I found that the slippers of the State Guesthouse have been upgraded. They are cute plush shoes that fully cover the feet and are very comfortable.
Of course, it would be even more perfect if the toilet could be replaced with a heated smart toilet seat.

It is beautiful to get up early to watch the sunrise. The magnolias are in full bloom and are a joy to behold. The environment and service are very good, worthy of the word "state guesthouse".
The hotel is designed in a courtyard style and is relatively large. There is a shuttle bus between the buildings. I ordered takeout to be delivered at the gate, and the bellman helped deliver it to the room. Even if a taxi or online car-hailing company makes it clear which building to pick you up from, you can enter the courtyard. When entering the hotel gate, you will be asked which building you are in and whether you are a hotel guest. The door of the building also requires a room card to enter. The security is still good.
In terms of catering, the breakfast is rich and tastes okay. The dishes at Ziwei Hall can only be considered average, not amazing.
The second building where I live has a lake view outside the window, which is beautiful. The guest room is not big, but it is very refreshing, and the equipment is from Bvlgari. Equipped with a capsule coffee machine, there are four capsules of Starbucks coffee, as well as blueberries and Harumi with fruit, all of good quality.

First, why does the room need to be large? Although I clearly knew that the room area was only 28 square meters when I booked the room, after I checked in, I found that the design of this room type is too user-friendly, and the dressing room and bathroom are all sufficient.
Second, the service is definitely of luxury hotel standards. This is also what I am overjoyed about.
Whether it is the mineral water provided in the room, it is supplied in sufficient quantity, and the fruit provided is actually high-quality blueberries, which is not available in all other luxury hotels. Also, the turndown service is also of high quality, and there is nothing missing. Complete.
In short, West Lake State Guesthouse is really awesome now, and it is the first choice when visiting Hangzhou.

There are several buildings in the entire State Guesthouse, all of which are independent and provide free shuttle buses. The main building is No. 8. Some major restaurants, activity facilities, recreational facilities, etc. are also here. Building 2 is newly renovated and is directly opposite. West Lake view. We stayed in No. 7 this time and it was overall very good.
The facilities in the room are also very good, and some snacks are also provided.
Breakfast is a traditional buffet style, with quite a lot of choices, and many local specialties are available for breakfast. This time, I also checked in at Hangzhou's numerous award-winning "Ziwei Hall", which is powerful and beneficial!
Every service staff is very enthusiastic and provides very warm service.
I will continue to choose this restaurant next time I come to Hangzhou.

This time I stayed in Building 8. The overall environment and facilities were perfect.
The room is also very big and the service staff is very friendly.
The only negative comment I have to give is to the service staff at several stalls in the breakfast buffet. The attitude of the chef making sesame cakes is really not friendly because the existing sesame cakes at the stall are cold and hard. I want to ask the chef to see if he can help heat them up. I asked him how long he had to wait, but he didn’t answer. Then he asked loudly and said a few minutes. After waiting for a while, he went to get them. His attitude was not very good. Then he made noodles and wontons. The attitude of the female chef at the stall is not very good. My family wanted to have wontons and vegetables, but her attitude was a bit bad and she said no. I can only order the same separately. I think the attitude of the chefs at these two stalls really needs to change the attitude of other staff. They are all very friendly and enthusiastic.
Finally, because I bought a travel photography package, I would like to give a big thumbs up to the handsome travel photographer Xiao Wu. He took a family portrait that our whole family was very satisfied with. Although it was raining lightly, his dedicated attitude and the photos he took were also perfect. It is recommended that everyone take photos with Xiao Wu Photographer

Living in Xihu Guobin, you almost don’t need to leave the garden. You can experience every plant and tree, pavilions and pavilions, and rocks in the garden all day long. You can take a leisurely stroll and enjoy the natural vitality. In addition, the historical heritage of the garden gives you a sense of satisfaction. Jiafu's wonderful life brings peace of mind and comfort.
It is worth mentioning that in addition to good artistic design and cultural aesthetics, the State Guesthouse also has excellent services. For example, Master Jiang from the Ministry of Commerce who sent us to Lingyin Temple to pray for blessings the next day was the highlight of this trip. It is hard to imagine that the driver has such accumulated knowledge. His kind words and cordial exchanges along the way also prayed for us. The execution adds to the wonderful situation, so I am happy and grateful.

Ms. Xiao Wu from GRO is warm and friendly, and her service is attentive. She will take the initiative to contact her when checking in. If you have any questions, you can contact her at any time. The next morning, she will also ask if you need replenishment of mineral water and toiletries. She is super considerate.
At noon, I went to the famous Hangbang restaurant Ziwei Hall for dinner. I ordered a set menu for two. After tasting it with my friends, I thought it was super delicious.
It was my first time to have a good experience from check-in to check-out. Every service staff I met, from the front desk, concierge to the shuttle bus boy and the restaurant lady, were all proficient in their work, warm and controlled in attitude. Wherever I meet them, I will nod and greet them, but they are not overly enthusiastic. I plan to bring my family to stay here again next time.

msg:This hotel contributed to the worst stay experience I have had in many years. This is the first time I have seen a five-star hotel where the quality of the rooms is not up to standard and the bad rooms are being sold.
When I picked up the room, the front desk agreed to reserve the middle room on the first floor, so that I could go out and play first, and then when I came back to check in, it would become a corner room on the second floor. The bathroom shower in the room was leaking, and the bathroom hook was missing. After searching for a long time, I found the nail hole. The toilet function remote control was there, but all functions were broken, leaving only the heated seat cushion and automatic flushing. I laughed when I looked at it. It is said to be the newly renovated Building 2, but the room has no soundproofing at all, and all the sounds in the corridor are clear. Do you call this a good hotel? The most ridiculous thing in the world.
I changed rooms on the second night. The sensor light in the bedroom closet was broken and stayed on all night. The flushing nozzle of the toilet can directly flush the back.
I have stayed in many state hotels in various places, and this is the first time I have encountered a situation where no takeaways are allowed in or delivered. Guests are asked to take a car and go to the gate to pick it up. It’s been a long time since we entered the 21st century. A casual hotel can’t even order takeout. What’s the point of being casual?
In addition, the dishes at Ziwei Hall are solid, but are you really embarrassed to hand over the menu? I couldn't order a few dishes at all.
I see that with your level of hardware and the way you make guests suffer, why don’t I stay in the Zen room in Lingyin Temple? They even only charge RMB 80 a night and eat vegetarian food every day. The key is that the service is really similar to yours.

However, this time I spent two perfect nights at the West Lake State Guesthouse... Whether it is hardware facilities or software services, this hotel is worthy of its reputation as the No. 1 garden in West Lake! What is satisfying is that the hotel's service quality and details are well done. The turndown service every night makes guests feel comfortable, warm and romantic...

It’s a century-old brand with a lot of stories here, such as Chairman Mao picking tea here to learn English, etc. It’s also the former residence of Kang Youwei, so you can experience and learn a lot with your children. .

1. Beautiful environment. The West Lake has blue waves, scattered ancient trees, pavilions and generous lawns. The arch bridge is reflected in the running water, and some rocks and tree leaves are faintly revealed in the arch bridge hole. From time to time, Haiou crosses the water and spreads its wings to fly into the distance. The environment here is beautiful.
2. Superior hardware. Whether it is the hotel lobby, buffet restaurant, coffee shop, various restaurants or guest rooms, there are four words "generous and safe" displayed (it is said that Buildings 1 and 2 have been newly renovated, and the building we live in is not particularly new. , but without the slightest sense of staleness). All house structures, furniture, door and window glass, carpets, etc. are spotless. The level of hardware here is superb.
3. Excellent service. During the three days of my stay, all the staff at the State Guesthouse gave me a deep impression on me and my family by providing proactive inquiry-style services with smiles + proactive greetings + if you need help... I can’t help but sigh: If everyone could do this, the world would be a better place!
I would like to express my special thanks to the assistant manager in the lobby on the evening of the 15th. As soon as she noticed eye contact between me and her, she got up to receive me with a smile and immediately coordinated to help me solve my need to increase the temperature of the room. At the same time, we would also like to express our special thanks to Teacher Xiao Sun (photographer) who enthusiastically, patiently and painstakingly helped us take photos during the trip on the morning of the 16th, allowing us to take very satisfying photos in the garden.

These are included in the stew, and the fruits are also carefully selected. They are all sweet and will not be perfunctory. It is worth coming again.

But I still had to wait for more than an hour to get the meal. The business is booming and the food in Ziwei Hall is delicious. It's pretty good.

Facing the West Lake Sudi and Leifeng Pagoda, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of flying egrets and morning glow when the weather is good. 😄

For my wife’s 80th birthday, I took my daughter to the State Guesthouse and the whole family praised it! We have stayed in more than 100 hotels at home and abroad, and the scenery here is unique and second to none! There is no end to the solitude on the banks of the West Lake, and the unique experience of hundreds of years is even more worthy for the elderly to come here to reminisce about the past! The foyer in building No. 2 where we live is elegant and well-decorated. The room is well-equipped with exquisite supplies. The window has a view of green trees and lakes. The interior is warm and comfortable. We have decided that we will come here as a family again one day! The young people in the shuttle bus kept delivering our luggage to the room. I really felt the enthusiasm of the hotel service. They smiled and said hello when we met, and responded to our requests. We felt even more warm and comfortable in the antique hotel with gardens everywhere! I walked around the park and felt that if the hotel maintained a large garden, there would be pros and cons. It would be rare to see everything beautiful. Guests in the Octagon Hall should be able to visit it. The little information in the drawer in the room is quite good. For those who are curious, Very useful! In short, it is a wonderful experience to stay in the picturesque State Guesthouse, we give it a thumbs up!

Overall, I felt that the courtyard was more beautiful, and many services have been added to keep pace with the times, such as free afternoon tea. There is free travel photography. The photographer Xiao Yu took him around the entire courtyard and captured many precious moments of the mother and daughter. Thank you very much. Stepping into Building 8, you are faced with the wide floor-to-ceiling windows, which introduce the scenery of the outdoor pavilion and pool. View, when checking in, the front desk met all my room requirements when booking, including wishing to stay in the newest building No. 2, with an elevator and a balcony. All service staff were polite, gentle and thoughtful, and there were no accidental comments in the comment area. The frosty phenomenon. There are battery cars to pick up and drop off between several buildings. Except for meals, they are basically on call. Walking along the side of the West Lake is very leisurely. It is very suitable for taking the elderly to stay in the garden for a whole day, eating, resting and admiring the garden scenery. It is slow-paced and not tired. The only regret is that the Ziwei Hall is too difficult to book! This should be mentioned when booking. The service staff in the restaurant are very nice. They actively suggested that the Zhangtiao in the set meal could be replaced with vinegar fish, which was so considerate.

msg:Many years ago, I learned that the hotels and homestays in Hangzhou’s tourism industry are very distinctive and exquisite, and they are among the best in the country. I have already collected must-see homestay hotels. This summer, I want to take my children on a trip. The weather is hot and I immediately thought of the West Lake State Guesthouse in Hangzhou. The software and hardware should be of more help to me (I’m glad I have such a clear understanding). I booked the garden-style room in Building 7 through Ctrip two days in advance. The room is very spacious and the height of the floor is the highest I have ever seen in a hotel. There is a balcony where you can sit and drink tea or coffee. The room is equipped with a coffee machine. It is very comfortable to stand and watch the scenery outside without being crowded. You can monopolize the beauty of the West Lake. Although this is not the most beautiful season for flowers to bloom, the garden plants and landscaping are a huge Jiangnan painting. Walking around and taking pictures is an immersive experience.
The service is butler-style. Any needs can be quickly resolved. Go to Building No. 8 for dinner. There is a special tram for free pick-up and drop-off. The breakfast is very rich and the scallion noodles are delicious. I personally like it very much, but I went late and had to wait in line for a seat. On the first day, I bought a performance ticket for Impression West Lake and went to eat at 5 o'clock, but I was told that it would not be until 6:30. The performance driver is also awesome. He waited at the door early to go to other scenic spots or go shopping. There is a comfortable commercial vehicle to pick up and drop off, which saves a lot of trouble. I must praise the driver for being very dedicated and responsible! In short, I have experienced the State Guest House, and I will definitely choose it again next time I come to Hangzhou

Every day is a different scenery, with lush and diverse vegetation. , there are many varieties of fruit trees, and August is the season when the lotus flowers are in full bloom and the lotus pods are ripe. Although there is no lotus feast, there are also dishes to taste lotus seeds and lotus roots. Have relish! The buffet is also very suitable for her appetite.

msg:Finally, we arrived at the West Lake State Guesthouse that we had been longing for. The location and green environment of the hotel are really amazing. The greenery is so beautiful that you can’t finish it in one day. If you don’t have money, it is recommended to experience it for at least two days. Then we brought the elderly and children and booked a courtyard twin room in Building 8. The front desk very thoughtfully upgraded it to a family suite, which made our stay more comfortable. The service staff of the hotel are also good, and breakfast can be packed.
Let’s talk about the areas that need improvement. First, the hardware. The price is the price of a five-star hotel, but the hardware cannot keep up with the five-star hotel. Building 8 is newly renovated, but the toilet is not a smart toilet. Then the light in our room had a bad contact and kept flashing. Then there was the Tiger Fountain. We looked at it again and again, but it didn't say that we had to pay. We checked out at the front desk. It was only when I was informed that it cost 30 per barrel. The hotel should fulfill its obligation to inform. Then there is the breakfast. Although it is delicious, it is not exquisite enough. It is not as delicious as the buffet breakfast at Huanglong Hotel where I stayed the day before.

Facilities: Building No. 2 is the newest building with open guest rooms. The facilities are relatively new. The lake-view rooms face the inner lake. It is walking distance to Lakeside Tea House and Liuzhuang Pier. The battery car is on call, and the heat fades away after dinner, and it is also very comfortable to walk back from Building 8.
Hygiene: very clean, the cleaning aunt is enthusiastic and professional, kind to people and has a sense of boundaries, great service


Environment: Enjoy the beautiful scenery of West Lake privately and listen to the stories of famous gardens

Service: Feel at home, warm and considerate without losing freedom. The ladies in the Ziwei Hall are professional, and the recommendations are great!

You must experience the Liuzhuang cruise ship. In the hot summer, you can enjoy the leisure of the West Lake privately, and listen to the beautiful scenery and stories introduced by the waitress.

Fortunately, I made the decision decisively and the experience after check-in was very good. The room was very quiet and I would not be disturbed by noise when I rested at night. The hotel service was also good. The waiters were polite and the receptionist at the door was very good. The same goes for the staff. Every step in the garden brings you a view. All in all, it’s a satisfying experience.

msg:During this trip, I stayed in budget hotels, B&Bs, real five-star hotels, and the West Lake State Guesthouse. This is really the worst hotel, not in terms of dirty rooms or anything like that, but in terms of value for money! Its price-performance ratio, which is open to ordinary people, is completely inconsistent with its status as a state guesthouse. Most people will stay there just to show off and be picked off. I suggest ordinary people not to spend this wasted money. It is really unnecessary. The service can only be said to be average. It was the first time I met the waiter who helped deliver the luggage and finally forgot about it. If we hadn't reminded him, he would have pushed the luggage and left. The only rooms available for selection are those in Building 8. The other buildings are not open, and there is no room for negotiation. There are only rooms with the worst views and the worst views. I originally chose the first floor to see the lake view, but opposite is the Ziwei Hall, where people inside can visit each other with you in the room. In the end, we had to ask to change rooms. The front desk acted quickly and arranged a room with a shaded side. Instead of watching each other with other people, we now looked at other people's yards and eaves. There was also a camera on the eaves. I can only say that it was lucky that there was an unlucky person next to me who was assigned a room facing the wall of the house. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to see even that bit of the yard, and we would have to look at the wall during our stay for a few days. As for the good view room in Building 8? Yes, there is one, but I don't know who it is for. After checking in, I made a special observation and found that someone's room number light will go out after checking in. During my entire stay at the hotel, the lights in the row of sunny rooms with a good view were not turned off, which meant that I was not allowed to stay in those rooms with a good view.
As for the welcome snacks, this is a state guesthouse after all! The welcome snacks only include two small packs of soda crackers that I bought at some point. The water is the cheapest Nongfu Spring (I don’t mean to say Nongfu Spring is bad, but it’s really cheap to put this in a hotel like this). After my mother filled the table with the wool she collected from other hotels, we came back from the trip the next day and found a small bowl of green grapes and a lotus pod on the table that was obviously given to someone else and was not intended for us. , the lotus pod has some oxidized black spots, and a corner has been torn off a small piece. I’ve seen people who didn’t give welcome snacks, and I’ve seen people who gave them that weren’t very good, but this is the first time that they only gave welcome snacks on the second day of check-in, and they included a welcome snack that others didn’t want at first glance. It's my knowledge that is shallow.
When we first arrived, we encountered a situation where the manager came out to pick up guests. At that time, we wanted to ask for a shuttle bus to the gate, but the manager didn't even look at us. Then the doorman who helped to pick us up also ignored us with a wink. We, the big shots who got out of the car after both of us served eagerly, treated us like nothing the whole time. After we waited for five or six minutes and no one came to serve us, we decided to call for a taxi. Maybe the doorman felt that such a good-tempered sheep could not let go of the opportunity to collect wool, so he pulled a small car with the same green brand name as the white car from the online booking service and the driver came over to talk to him. Our car was a commercial vehicle, so we asked him to take us there. The price was 20% more expensive than taking a taxi.
This hotel is worth seeing only for its garden, but whether it is worth the price is up to everyone. The older generation may think it is worth it. In the words of the older generation in my family, "The hotel is a good hotel, but it is not for us." But after all, I am a young man with a strong spirit, and I think this time I stayed in the hotel. The price/performance ratio is really low, and it is a classic way of giving money to people but it also depends on the person’s face.
The food at Ziwei Hall can only be said to be neither good nor bad. Just try it in the past. The famous West Lake Sour Fish that is the only one served by people is actually just tasteless sweet and sour fish. Dongpo Pork is not even as good as Zhiweixuan's Liushui Restaurant. It is not even fat but not greasy. As for the matsutake fried rice, it is also very greasy. And for some reason, our tableware was covered with cigarette ash. Before eating, we had to constantly ask the waiter to change the tableware. The waiter didn't even blink. She would change one tableware for another, and she wouldn't change it unless asked.
Finally, be sure to pay attention! The location of West Lake State Guesthouse is too remote. Even traveling there without driving is a problem. I would never recommend staying here! It is better to choose a hotel in a prosperous area, which is convenient for traveling, sightseeing and eating.

Location: Located in Xili Lake of the West Lake, rebuilt from a private garden, it is quiet and elegant, with a unique cave, the lake and the sky are the same color, and the birds sing and the cicadas sing, which makes people forget their worries. Building No. 1 is facing the lake, you can directly see the Chenghuang Pavilion of Leifeng Pagoda, and live by the lake, nothing better than this.
Room service: The service at the front desk is in place, and it doesn't make the social fear look ugly. The manager who introduced the equipment is also very patient. There is also a night-time turn-off service. After dinner, the light greets you. The bed is full of warmth, and the curtains are all down. The fluffy slippers are very comfortable, and there is a kind of childishness when stepping on the carpet. The mattress was comfortable, the pillows and shower head really need improvement.
Meal service: The desserts of the afternoon tea are very rich, and the presentation is eye-catching. It is in Building 6, from the entrance of the West Lake State Guesthouse Cultural Exhibition Hall to the second floor. All dinners are served in Building 8. For dinner, you can go to Ziwei Restaurant and Michelin Restaurant. You need to grab the number when you release the number at 16.30 on weekends. The buffet in the cafe offers a discount of 286 at night. regret series. The breakfast is also in the coffee shop. If you go late, you need to wait for a seat😅The famous snacks are really delicious, and the kidney beans are also delicious. The coffee beans are deeply roasted, and the American-style 2-bean concentration is delicious without bitter taste. The plates are very retro.
Transportation service: The 24-hour shuttle bus between buildings in the park is very good. It is also very convenient to park a private car, but some small bridges and road sections are narrow, and the novice is not friendly ☺️ Online car-hailing cars can also come in.
Travel photography service: The travel photography service in the package can be reserved one day in advance, the photographer is very professional, and the soap flakes we wanted were taken in 15 minutes, and we must also give a thumbs up🤩

There is a promenade near the lake where you can overlook the Leifeng Pagoda, which is very pleasantly surprised. Stayed in Building 5, the room can see the lotus pond and garden, the scenery is beautiful. Building No. 5 has not been renovated and is a little old, but it is relatively clean. The attitude of the service staff is very good, and they are well-trained at first glance, making people feel at home. Tried the pool with only one or two other guests, which was fine. Because they only received high-end business in the past, the service staff were not familiar with tourism projects and did not give accurate suggestions, such as the timetable of the West Lake cruise, the location of the docks of different ships, and so on. I would advise the concierge to add some information as appropriate. There are not many dishes in Ziwei Hall, and I didn’t try too many dishes. Personally, I think Hupaoquan matsutake rice and Dongpo pork are not bad, but eel paste is generally salty. Lily and water chestnut tasted fresh, but not amazing. This time, I took my children on an in-depth tour of the west bank of the West Lake and Lingyin Temple. I feel that the location of the hotel is very close to these attractions. You can visit them several times in the morning and afternoon, which is suitable for young children.

There were many touching moments during the check-in process, and there are also areas that need to be strengthened. I hope the hotel will get better and better, so I just want to mention a few points!
The supervisor helped us delay check-out and took care of our time. Thank you very much!
Xiao Sun, the travel photographer, is very good and warm and considerate. In the morning, my family had something to do and even took time to help take a few more photos. The service is very good!

msg:Environment: The No. 1 garden in the West Lake is worthy of its name. Staying in the State Guesthouse, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the West Lake in private, and enjoy the sunset of Leifeng without crowding. It is an excellent location. There are also many landscapes in the park, and it is very pleasant to take a walk in the park before and after meals.
Service: Greetings are warm, the shuttle bus between buildings arrives quickly, the lake tour in the park will start after July 10, and the guided tour service charters 1500.
Facilities: Buildings 1, 2, 7, and 8 can be reserved inside and outside the park. Building 8 is the main building, where the coffee shop, red bar (afternoon tea for Internet celebrities), and Ziwei Hall are all located here. The first floor is facing the lake, and building 2 is on foot Two or three minutes away from the lake, next to it is the lakeside tea house, both of which have rooms facing the lake. The facilities in Building 2 are relatively new, including washlets, Dyson hair dryers, jacuzzi bathtubs, double basins, and Bulgari lotion. Building No. 7 is the farthest from the main building, but it has a good view of the lake.
Meals: Soft drinks in the refrigerator are free, there is a coffee machine, the free 💦 is 380ml, and one fruit per day, currently grapes and lotus pods. The hotel breakfast is from 7:00 to 10:00, and the category is average. There is a 10% discount for lunch and dinner at the buffet restaurant. There are the same West Lake Vinegar Fish and Hupao Matsutake Rice in the Ziwei Hall, and there are also crayfish.
Surroundings: 1 km out of the park, there are Huagang Guanyu and Zhiweiguan, and the transportation is convenient by taking a taxi.

msg:I was looking forward to it before I came here, maybe because it was a weekend and there were so many people and it was hot and noisy after entering the lobby.
You need to get water by yourself. It was not cleared by the 14:00 check-in time, so I didn't check in until 14:41.
When checking in, you need to push your luggage in and find a room by yourself.
I went to the Red Bar, Ziwei Hall, and Lakeside Tea House, but relatively speaking, only Ziwei Hall was worth it.
I can’t understand why the afternoon tea at Red Bar and Lakeside Teahouse charges 15% service charge? What did you serve? Pour me a glass of water? I don't think it's worth it
The service is half and half, half of the people passing by don’t say hello, and there is no shuttle bus because my legs hurt from walking.
The landscape in the park needs to be optimized to look like a big park.
If there are more customers, we should increase the manpower, instead of asking you to push for everything. It is better to have four seasons.
The breakfast was very incomprehensible. When the time came, he started clearing away the dishes? None of the customers inside have finished eating, right?

msg:First of all, I would like to thank the hotel for upgrading the room because of the family's birthday, and upgraded it to the main building on the 8th.
Building No. 8 is very convenient for dining, recreation and travel. There is a small yard in the room. Although the weather is too hot and it is useless, it is very pleasant to open the curtains and look at the small yard!
Needless to say, the environment of the hotel is indeed matched with the No. 1 garden in the West Lake, so beautiful! The family has taken many walks in the hotel. The landscaping is very good, and the location of the hotel is also very comfortable facing the West Lake Su Causeway.
The Ziwei Hall did not make an appoin**ent, so I experienced a buffet dinner at the hotel. Although the hotel's food and beverages cannot be said to be rich, they have their own characteristics.
I originally booked for two nights, but later changed it to one night, but I regretted that I booked less when I stayed in the hotel~ I wanted to continue staying, but unfortunately there was no room.
Leave some regrets, there is still a chance to come again.
There is a painting boat at the west gate of the hotel, which can be chartered for a tour. It costs 1700 to charter a boat to visit the West Lake for an hour. It seems that more than a dozen people can be seated. The hotel’s shuttle bus can be sent there directly. The air-conditioned boat is still very comfortable in such a hot weather. Although the price is It's a bit more expensive, but it still saves a lot of trouble on such a hot day!
Hangzhou State Guest House, I will come back again~ When the baby is older, I will bring her to experience the beauty of West Lake.

The No. 3 building I stayed in had simple facilities, which reminded me of the five-star hotels in the 90s. Fortunately, the hotel facilities are well maintained.
The hotel is very large, and it takes a few minutes to walk from Building No. 8 where you checked in to the rest of the buildings. The hotel is equipped with a battery car, but you need to wait for a while during peak hours. I waited for nearly 25 minutes at most.
In terms of diet, the breakfast is complete, as well as freshly made Dingsheng cakes, scones, and freshly squeezed orange juice. Praise! In the evening, I ordered dishes at the Ziwei Restaurant, West Lake Vinegar Fish, Dongpo Meat, Matsutake Rice, Fresh Water Ling, Fresh Lotus Seeds, Fresh Chicken Head and Rice Roasted Shrimp, and Mrs. Song’s Fish Soup. It depends on personal taste. I like all of them, but my children I only like Dongpo pork

I said no, there are many people on holidays. Well, come here on time at 2 o’clock. I asked if the room had breakfast. The face that was just frozen in the freezer told me that it can be deducted from the prepaid deposit. , I don’t know the rest, the front desk next door is telling her guests, sir, I will arrange the second floor for you, because the view can be better, so I asked my front desk, does my room have a second floor? Tell me that your room type with twin beds is only on the first floor, and I said ok, after checking in, I pointed to the sofa at the back and said you wait 20 minutes on the opposite side, and I said, are you going to delay paying for my room? Then that face twitched and laughed, and immediately took out the room card and swiped it for me. I said you answer me, and then said very unhappy that I am making a room card for you, and you can go right away. I was very upset at the moment, thinking while walking, because we are poor people and only stayed for one night. The gentleman on the second floor at the front desk next door has been promoted, but I haven't. After getting on the courtesy car, the young man from Jilin who drove the car had forgotten his name. The service was very good. After a little relief, he entered the room. Sure enough, he gave me a card right away. The room had a different view, just beside Building 1. It’s the closest to the West Lake, really 😂, I asked the service staff if my room type only has the first floor, and they answered that I also have the second floor. Really, the room fee is 1700, 1500 is for the landscape, and 200 is for the facilities and service fee. If it wasn't for the broken foot, I wouldn't live here. No matter how good the other details are, I wouldn't be happy, too ****ing. I won't be coming in the future. The previous night's B&B 500 was near Shangri-La, which was much better than this, and we responded to every request. Everything is clean and tidy, at least not cold.

The room 2105 in Building 2 where I stayed can see a little bit of the West Lake, but after experiencing it, I found that I don’t have to worry too much about where to live. It’s ok to go out of the room to see the scenery.
The whole hotel is a big park. You can check in many scenic spots with the map on the room card. It’s really enjoyable to see lotus flowers in summer and maple leaves in autumn!
The products of Ziwei Hall are good. Except for some dishes, the overall is great. I have no experience with the red box afternoon tea. The complimentary afternoon tea is too ordinary and can be completely given up. Those who want to drink tea can go to the lakeside tea house, which is just beside the West Lake, which is quieter than the teahouse on the other side of the lake.
In short, just stay here and stay in a hotel, it's so worry-free! Next time you must bring your children to stay again, especially suitable for leisure travel with children!

Dining and swimming are all in Building 8. There is a shuttle bus, which was very convenient in the past. 5. The morning and evening buffets are of good quality. Let’s talk about the evening. Generally, the hotel’s late buffet is really tasteless. The quality of the special hot dishes is not high. Except for the sashimi, many seafood here are steamed, very fresh, and there are many varieties. Fried yellow croaker, pomfret, and steak are all very good. tasty. Children like to eat matsutake fried rice and tomato soup, which are very rich in taste. Mom likes to drink all kinds of fish soup every night, which is not fishy at all and delicious. Hubby likes the sweet shrimp in the sashimi. 6 The hotel can charter cars and boats, have a spa, afternoon tea, and handcraft classes with children every afternoon.

msg:The West Lake State Guesthouse was booked very early for this trip. Let’s make an objective evaluation from the following aspects.
Hygiene: From Shanghai to Suzhou and then to the State Guest House, it can be said that it is the best one in terms of hygiene. It is really clean and safe, even if we bring an 8-year-old child with us
Environment: You can see the pictures on the Internet. The park is quiet, and it is a beautiful scenery. It is on the West Lake, next to the Turtle Lake, and facing the Leifeng Pagoda.
Service: The service from the front desk to the concierge to the car to go out is very good. They also gave the children disposable toothbrushes, slippers, and toys.
Facilities: We live in Building 7, and the environmental facilities are very satisfactory

msg:It is the first time to bring children, the elderly come to Hangzhou, the first choice for visiting the West Lake! First of all, in the hotel, you can see the West Lake, and when you go to Su Causeway, you can also look at the hotel! Such a location is incomparable!
Second, there are views everywhere in the hotel! The extremely beautiful Jiangnan gardens!
Third, earlier, it is the standard of a five-star hotel! ! ! Realized the freedom of bayberry and lychee! Every kind of fruit feels carefully selected and very delicious!
Fourth, let me add that the hotel's Chinese restaurant! The price is relatively expensive, and you have to wait for a seat, and you have to wait for an hour before you go in. Saw a lot of empty tables, waiting to be cleared, but made us wait for an hour... Hey...
There are few places in the Chinese restaurant, the service is average, and there is an additional service charge, more than 700 meals, and more than 200 service charges...beautiful😍

However, the taste of the dishes is okay! There is one thing to say, it's time to complain, it's time to like it! The last picture, with West Lake Vinegar Fish! The taste is still delicious! Quite like it!

msg:The West Lake State Guesthouse is said to be the number one park in West Lake. It has a Chinese-style garden of 360,000 square meters and dominates the shoreline of the West Lake for more than 2,000 meters. Although it is large, it can be reached by battery car between each building, and it is basically on call, and the service is in place.
The location and landscape of each building in the hotel are different, so please pay attention to this if you have requirements. The hotel is not open to the public and is very quiet. By the lake, you can overlook Yanggong Causeway and Leifeng Pagoda, and it was also the place where Chairman Mao read books and enjoyed the snow.
The restaurant Ziwei Hall has two Michelin stars, typical Hangzhou cuisine, which may not be suitable for foreigners. Personally, I think the Hupao spring water matsutake rice is not bad.
Family travel, worth living.

Hygiene: quite satisfactory, the basic bedding is hygienic and clean, and the state-run work is steady and steady!

Service: Although it is far away from the busy city of Su Causeway, there are shuttle buses to pick up and drop off at various locations, which is convenient and fast!

Speaking of which, the service of Ziwei Hall is really good. It was late at noon, and the West Lake vinegar fish that I went here for the name was gone. I showed my intention to come, and the waiter brother even specially sent another plate. I would like to thank you very much!
Environment: live on the 7th floor, the legendary Kangzhuang. It can be said that 2/3 of the room fee is paid for the beauty of the West Lake. There are scenery and stories everywhere in the park! The implicit and introverted culture of our Chinese garden is expressed most appropriately. This is the other side of the rare tranquil orchid in the West Lake, and this is the rare luxury of Chinese style! No wonder great people also like to read and study here!
If you have the opportunity, you must work hard to make money, and come to live longer!

It rained a few days during the stay, but this is also the most beautiful scenery. After getting rid of the heat, I thought it was spring by mistake. At that time, I wrote a poem : The willow branches lightly brush my clothes, and the small raindrops drip into the pond. I don't know that Jiang Nanchun has passed away, but looking back, the garden is full of lotus flowers. The beautiful scenery and quiet feeling here far surpass the West Lake Scenic Area, and I will stay there again. To quote Bai Juyi's Yi Jiangnan, we will meet again sooner or later!

msg:I read the word-of-mouth reviews in advance, and stayed at the State Guesthouse as the first stop in Hangzhou with a happy and expectant mood. Record a few real feelings:

1. The girl who checks in at the front desk is very nice. She carefully introduces the details of the hotel’s supporting facilities. There is also a handsome and upright man at the service desk for luggage storage to help book cruises and Song Yun activities (sorry, I forgot to read the name); help to deliver Zhang Huadong in the room was very enthusiastic and attentive. He recommended surrounding attractions and food for us, and helped us call a taxi. He was very patient, thank you very much! And the teacher of Song Yun's Chinese Studies class is also great, patiently taught the children an hour and a half of lessons;

2. I read the comments before saying that some service staff introduced several famous places in the hotel (such as the place where Chairman Mao read English, the place where the head of state met, etc.), but two days before and after check-in, I didn’t meet anyone who actively guided and introduced these places remind?

3. The hotel has a free cruise ship as a gift, and others can go with them at their own expense. The journey is 1 hour. The service and the hardware of the ship are very good. The only shortcoming is that there is an accompanying explanation, but the guide may be inside the hotel The staff is not professional and detailed enough, and the sound may not be heard clearly due to the possible space and wind on the ship (it is recommended to equip the guide with a small bee)

4. Finally, talk about the worst experience at the end of the itinerary! ! Because I want to invite about 9 friends to dine in the Ziwei Hall, I have communicated with the front desk of the hotel lobby, the switchboard, and the restaurant in advance. The big table reservations cannot be made in advance, but you can go to the Ziwei Hall in advance to queue up. When you arrive at the Ziwei Hall at 5:00, you will be waiting. First come first served.
So, when I checked out at noon that day, I communicated with the front desk again about the situation of the large table and the waiting time, and pre-deposited enough for the dinner, and I went to wait for a seat on time at 4:30 (ignoring the fact that I was cut in the queue because I knew someone inside. ), the seat was ranked fourth, but after entering, I was told that the two big tables had been reserved in advance! I said that in the past two days, I have repeatedly confirmed that the big table can only be waited on the spot and is first come first served. How can there be a saying that it is booked in advance? The answer is that the whole hall is reserved... Then why didn't I inform that there are no big tables tonight when I repeatedly confirmed with various depar**ents in advance? The manager of the restaurant said that they had no choice... because they had invited friends to make an appoin**ent to dine at the Ziwei Restaurant, and in the end they had no choice but to accept being divided into two tables;
(There is another detail: when I checked out, the sister at the front desk kindly offered discounts for hotel guests to dine in the Ziwei Hall, so the prepaid fee was deposited into the account of the room number. As a result, when the Ziwei Hall paid the bill, the settlement staff with a normal attitude complained about it after I reported the room number. After a few words, I checked out at noon, and I printed the bill with a reluctant attitude. I took a look and saw that I spent four to five thousand yuan, and the discount was reduced by a total of 68 yuan. This discount for in-house guests is really unbearable to mention...)

The cooperation, hardware and software of various depar**ents of the hotel represent its image... If the overall score of the Ziwei Hall for the State Guesthouse is 8 points before the meal, then after the service experience reflected in this meal, Really can only give 6.5 points.

I hope that such a hotel with a unique geographical location and a profound historical heritage can go further in service management🙏

It was not practical for the recommended driver to transfer to the scenic spot. Later, I played by myself, and the others were okay. I lost a pair of sunglasses in the restaurant the night before. After checking out the next day, I called the room customer service and said no. Later, I recalled whether I lost it in the restaurant and called to confirm that it was. It was sent to me and I had to pay the courier fee, which is very inhumane. If I didn't chase the phone and go back to the restaurant, the sunglasses would be lost.

msg:I am really full of praise for the hotels in the State Guesthouse series.

Environment: The State Guest House is always better than having an invincible location and view that cannot be matched. Quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, the great hermitage in the city (not the kind of hermitage in a place where birds don't ****) is believed to be a brand shared by all kinds of state guesthouses.

Service: In addition to the itinerary confirmation and inquiries needed one day in advance unlike the international hotel group brands, everything from CI at the front desk to breakfast guidance, and then to the battery car connection, are all highly praised. Overall no problems.

Facilities: Building No. 2 has just been renovated as a whole, and both outdoor and indoor facilities are very up-to-date, especially the Dyson hair dryer.

Hygiene: Because it is new and well maintained, the indoor hygiene is very good. The outdoor garden is also clean and tidy.

Tucao: It's a little regrettable that I don't know why, even though I registered the license plate number after checking in, I still charged 10 yuan for parking when I drove out of the hotel compound for the first time not long after CI. By the way, when I was handling the CO, I mentioned that the front desk recorded the Alipay parking payment screenshot very thoughtfully, and also said that it will be refunded in the near future, but it may be reduced or exempted during the pre-authorized deduction, and I did not take the initiative to care about it. However, compared to the parking fee, you have to confess your identity every time you enter and exit the hotel. The experience is indeed not particularly good. I understand the need for the staff at the entrance of the compound to maintain the order of the hotel, but if the front desk issues identification objects to driving customers during check-in or other more optimized identification schemes such as electronic railings at the entrance and exit, dream recognition, registration of license plate numbers, etc., the check-in experience may be better.

5: Ziwei Hall The dishes in Ziwei Hall need to be further improved. After we went to the Jinsha Hall, we visited the Ziwei Hall again, and found that the service staff in the Ziwei Hall had a dull attitude, messy organization, and were very loud when cleaning up the dishes: In addition, the Mrs. Song’s fish soup produced by the Ziwei Hall had a lot of pepper on the day, and the fish and rice Not hot enough either. Of course, they saw the three of us sharing the two-person set meal (the elderly don’t have a big appetite, and we usually order smaller portions), so they kindly provided an extra slice of cold food and four servings of fruit.
The flaws are not hidden, and I very much hope that when we stay next time, everything will be the same, and the Ziwei Hall will be improved to a higher level, with very good dishes presented.

Without leaving the store, you can have a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery of the West Lake. All kinds of gardens, mountains, and waters are connected together, bringing the Chinese style to the extreme. No wonder the great Chairman Mao chose this place as his holy place for reading and vacationing.
The hotel occupies a large area, and activities such as breakfast and swimming almost require a battery car to be picked up by a dedicated person. It's a bit of a hassle, but the response is fast.
Except that some facilities are a bit old, there is nothing wrong with it.

She has always had a wish to stay in the West Lake State Guesthouse for two days, and see the West Lake from the perspective of the State Guesthouse. Taking advantage of her birthday, I booked a room here for her. In the past two days, she visited all the scenic spots in the State Guest House, and she was very excited and happy. Although the room facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained. The house is at the foot of the mountain, and it is the moldy rainy season, so there is no musty smell at all. The service attitude of the front desk and the restaurant is also quite cordial. Recently, I plan to travel to Guangzhou. I searched all the hotels and hotels in Guangzhou on Ctrip, but I couldn't find anything comparable to the price of 1,000 yuan per night at the State Guest House. Really great value.

msg:The C-position landscape of Nexi Lake is unique. The decoration style of the State Guest House is of course dignified. If you stay in a suite in Building No. 7, the room faces north so the courtyard view is average. The internal facilities of the room are quite satisfactory, but the soft service is very good. All the staff who come into contact with it, from the welcome to the front desk, the restaurant, and even the room service, are just right and just right. It is at the level of a state hotel. It must be praised!

msg:We finally arrived at the West Lake State Guest House, which has been planted for a long time. The car was driving slowly on the tree-lined road, and everyone exclaimed from time to time. It is said that this is a hotel, but it is more like a quiet park. When we came to check-in in Building 8, the welcome staff and waiters in light gray uniforms received us politely. Xiao Chen, the foreman at the front desk, learned that the six of us were traveling as friends, and gave us a free upgrade to 8 in her authority. The courtyard room in Building No. 1 is a big surprise for everyone. The welcome fruit after check-in is also carefully prepared. Ugly tangerines, blueberries, and lychees are all fresh. The small biscuits and protective bags are very considerate when the bed is turned down. Although the room is on the ground floor, it is very dry, free of flying insects, and soundproof The effect is good. When we had dinner at the Ziwei Hall, we only ordered Pianerchuan (because we enjoyed it at the Four Seasons Hall at noon and were very full), but the service was very thoughtful and meticulous, and the attitude was very enthusiastic. If we go next time, we will try other special delicacies . We also ate the buffet in the coffee shop. Since we are hotel guests, it only costs 285 yuan per person. The dishes do not look dazzling, but the ingredients are fresh and carefully selected, such as matsutake fried rice, grilled lamb chops, steak, and spring water tofu , grilled small yellow croaker, etc., made our group full of praise. The scenery of the hotel is even more unique. You can see the Su Causeway near the lake, overlook the Leifeng Pagoda, Dengdingjia Mountain, visit the cruise ship wharf, small bridges and flowing water, pavilions, terraces and buildings. Take about two hours. Its geographical location is also unique. From the north gate, you can walk to Maojiabu, and from the south gate, you can reach Huagang Guanyu, which makes people linger and forget to return. If you come to Hangzhou in another season, you will still stay in the State Guesthouse.

msg:The hotel has a beautiful environment and a long cultural history. Immersing in it can make people feel calm. Read the books provided in the hotel room carefully within an hour and a half, and then visit the Goose Nuanshi Road preserved on Dingjia Mountain and the Octagonal Pavilion by the West Lake. I have an immersive experience of Liu Zhuang's vicissitudes through history and the role he played in the history of diplomacy.

The hotel is located in the West Lake. It is not only based on Liu Xuexun's Water Bamboo Residence by the West Lake, but also includes Kangzhuang, the place where Kang Youwei was born and lived in seclusion. You can climb Dingjia Mountain/Kang Mountain surrounded by ancient trees, and visit the hotel that is only open to hotel guests. Historic monument, it is an honor.

The only small bug is that the service attitude of the staff needs to be improved during check-in. First, they actively introduced that the hotel has vacant room types that can be upgraded, and then when asked about free upgrades in other comment areas, they were very prevaricate and said that it was just The benefits given on a specific event day and the hotel’s room shortage on that day (if the room is tight, why would it introduce new room types and suggest upgrades) the room is indeed small as the staff said, and the corridor has a pungent smell. Because it is the room I booked, there should be no discomfort, but the behavior of the staff to make comments on the reserved room in order to sell a good room type made the expected check-in a bad experience value. In particular, it is very different from the experience that the West Lake Villa next door gave free upgrades without consultation. It is recommended that the staff improve their service awareness and training~

msg:I have always liked staying in the State Guesthouse. When I went to Hangzhou West Lake, I booked the West Lake State Guesthouse that I really wanted. It was really great!
The environment is great! "The First Famous Garden of West Lake" belongs to the C position in the West Lake. From the hotel, you can overlook the Leifeng Pagoda and Su Causeway. The hotel itself is a park with few people and beautiful scenery. It is suitable for enjoying a comfortable vacation time.
Great service! Walking in the park, the service staff will always say hello, the battery car service is on call, and the guest room provides good night service and gifts thoughtfully, reflecting the service concept of being at home everywhere.
The rooms are amazing! Book the best priced single room, which is bigger than expected, and there is a separate "small study room". Although the room is decorated with nostalgia, it is not outdated. The wallpaper is light green fabric wallpaper, which is very elegant. The bathroom supplies are from L'Occitane. The only thing I complain about is that my friend thinks that the sink and toilet are too close, making it inconvenient to wash. The room is located in Building No. 3. The West Lake is just a few steps away. Mao Zedong's English learning center is by the lake in front of the building. It feels very good.
The buffet was a pleasant surprise! In addition to the Chinese and Western dishes in the five-star hotel buffet, the best thing about the buffet is the special dishes of Hangbang cuisine such as West Lake Vinegar Fish and Dongpo Pork. The taste is very good.

Walking by the lake in the morning and evening is really refreshing. The attitude of the service staff is very professional, enthusiastic but not excessive. There are fruits in the room every day, blueberries and lychees alternately. Toiletries are L'Occitane's almond series.
If there is one downside, it's the breakfast. In fact, there may not be many varieties, but the taste can really be improved. It was the first time I was put off by bread pudding in a five-star hotel.

We arrived at 12 o’clock and there are vacancies for us. They helped us arrange early check-in and told the hotel guests that there is a discount for meals. We applied for an extra bed service. The extra bed was also very good. Okay, let me tell you about the unsatisfactory things: 1. The facilities in the No. 8 building of the main building are a little old. The room rate at this price is a little bit inconsistent. 2. When we were taking pictures in the park, a security guard chased us away many times. When we left, no vehicles passed by and we didn’t disturb others, which brought us a bad experience. 3. The buffet is 248 per person, but many dishes are cold and the styles are not many. I feel that the price does not match the real thing. Generally speaking It's still good to experience it with satisfaction

I drove from Shanghai on Saturday and came back on Sunday. I only had a one-day and one-night itinerary. Because the information provided by the hotel was wrong, I didn’t even get to sit on the rowing boat on the first day. The itinerary for the second day was compressed, and I was very tired.

The facilities are quite satisfactory, slightly old-fashioned and outdated, and the price/performance ratio is not high.

There is a small road along the West Lake in the restaurant where you can swim, and you can overlook the beautiful scenery of the West Lake. Check-in in Building 8, and the restaurants are all here. There are battery cars in the hotel, which is very convenient to play in the park. The breakfast is acceptable, and the restaurant has an outdoor table for dining and enjoying the view, which is very comfortable. This time, my friends came here because they were curious about the State Guest House, and secondly, they were interested in the Ziwei restaurant, which is the second diamond restaurant. On the first day of my stay, I was told that dinner would be served at 4 p.m. Go to the Erzuan restaurant at 3:30 and queue up to get the number, and you can enter the restaurant for dinner at 5 o'clock. I ignore the discomfort of queuing up to get the number excitedly. Soaked broad beans in oil. For the second meal on Monday, there is no need to get a number in line at 4:30, West Lake vinegar fish, fresh razor clams, and fried wan beans. The fish is fresh, but it is sour and greasy. It takes half a bag of dried mangoes to suppress the nausea at night. The razor clams are also fresh. In addition to being spicy, the more you eat, the more you eat. Fortunately, Wandou can also be eaten with rice. My companion did say that the stir-fried Wandou is not as delicious as the one at home. The third meal is Dongpo pork, fried clams with bamboo shoots. Dongpo pork haha..., are the fried clams with bamboo shoots served in the canteen at noon and warmed up at night? Don't say that Hangbang cuisine is light, no matter how light it is, it must be tasty. Second diamond? Who's mouth has eaten such a dish and given it a second diamond? The appetizers and small melons in the evening are the delicacies of the three meals in these three days. It's really unbearable, and the surrounding farmyards are all delicious. I personally think that the chef let the customer define the meal should be not to praise it after eating, nor should it be nausea. Stop being creative and get down to earth. Eating three meals in a row is definitely because of laziness and unwillingness to toss about, and also because there is a little hope for the second diamond report. How did the second diamond last for three consecutive years? Puzzling to really queue up, make an appoin**ent in advance. Are they all attracted by the second diamond? I will never follow the trend blindly in the future, and I will be convinced by IQ and tax payment. Leeks, let's grow some snacks. Embarrassing smile...Ziwei Erzuan gave you a bad review.

Choose to live here, look up to the east, and you can have a panoramic view of the lake for ten miles. You can see the "Sudi Spring Dawn" up close, and the "Leifeng Sunset" in the distance. It is convenient to reach all scenic spots in Hangzhou. There are sightseeing cars in the park connecting various residences. The service is warm and thoughtful. The buffet breakfast is rich in dishes and balanced in nutrition. It is very good. Except that the room facilities are a bit old but very clean. Unfortunately, Ziwei Hall, which is famous for its delicious food, has a personal experience meal The food is really average. But all in all, the flaws do not conceal the advantages. I give it a full five-star check-in experience this time. I have already planted grass in my heart. We are not finishing Hangzhou State Guesthouse to be continued...

msg:Daily welcome fruit: Although it is relatively small, it is quite delicious every day. The regular guests are ugly oranges, and the random ones may be blueberries or lychees.
Breakfast: good and delicious.
Facilities: A little bit old, but it doesn't affect it. As soon as I entered the park and saw the West Lake, I thought it was worth it.
Hygiene: It is cleaned by a special person every day, which is okay.
Environment: nothing to say
The service was excellent

It is a good choice to take my mother on a trip. To be honest, I like the state guest very much. I will come to Hangzhou for the state guest in the future.

msg:The West Lake State Guesthouse, according to the introduction, is a combination of Liuzhuang, Kangzhuang, Hanzhuang and Tangzhuang, designed by Mr. Dai Nianci.
To enter the park, you need to check in at Building No. 8. Once you enter the door, the scenery is infinitely beautiful, and there is a large area of water outside the open floor-to-ceiling windows. After checking in, there is a shuttle bus to take you to the building where you check in. This time I stayed in Building 2. There is also a water area under the window. From the window in the morning, you can see red koi swimming by in the lake, and big black and white magpies jumping around in the trees.
I am very happy that Building No. 2 is not far from Building No. 1. I went to see Building No. 1 where Chairman Mao once stayed with admiration. Building No. 1 has an independent butler reception. It is said that when Building A opens the door, it is Lixi Lake. The pillow water West Lake. The garden of the West Lake State Guest House is indeed very large, with pavilions and pavilions, lush greenery, a small tea garden, and a hill (Dingjiashan). In the morning, walk along the Lixi Lake to Dingjiashan. There is a reading place for Chairman Mao on the mountain. The environment is quiet, next to the "hidden rock" inscribed by Kang Youwei. As it had just rained the day before, the air in Dingjia Mountain was humid and the vegetation was lush.
Next to Building 6 is a museum exhibition hall, which exhibits G20, China-France, China-US, China-Russia and other banquet porcelain; it is a pity that I did not find the octagonal pavilion that initialed the "Sino-US Joint Communiqué".
The breakfast is very good. In the water area of Building 8, there are beautiful scenery and rich varieties. The more distinctive ones are Dingsheng Cake, Mei Cai Cake, Scallion Wrap, Jiuqu Hongmei Tea Egg, and Three Fresh Shrimp Noodles? ? , There are also a variety of regular hotel bread and cakes.
Overall, a very good experience, and I will come again if I have the opportunity!

msg:The experience is incomparable to Grand Hyatt. First of all, in such an expensive hotel, you have to pay for everything. How can I get the confidence to pay 88 for a cup of coffee (Grand Hyatt gives it away for free and can take it away). Secondly, the hotel is extremely inconvenient. I got lost twice when I returned to the hotel. In the end, I didn’t want to look for it anymore, so I just took my luggage to the front desk. It is recommended that hotel managers stay at Hilton Hyatt and experience the huge difference for themselves. In addition, the welcome fruits are only two very small🍊, which is insincere. I will not stay here again, and I will not recommend it to my friends.

msg:Environment: The hotel was booked one month in advance, and the environment is even more beautiful than I imagined. When I checked in on Friday, I hardly saw any guests. I walked around Nexi Lake in the afternoon, and it was very quiet and comfortable. The greening maintenance is very good, better than the two state guesthouses in Shanghai 👍I went to the Red Bar in the afternoon to drink afternoon tea, watched the rain scene and drank Longjing, and experienced happiness.

Facilities: After reading the reviews before coming here, I was somewhat prepared for the obsolete facilities, but as a hotel person myself, I had to make complaints about it. I stayed in Building No. 3, which is really the oldest state hotel room I have ever seen (I have also stayed in the eastern and western suburbs of Shanghai). It is also possible that the house price we set is cheap. And as a five-star hotel, there is no elevator in this building! It really shocked me! Even if it's only on the second floor, I hope the front desk can inform customers when they check in. Female customers generally have more luggage. There is no service staff at the front desk of Building No. 3 to assist us. And the front desk is basically unmanned, which is really a deduction.

Service: The front desk and lobby services are still within the standard. After the room is cleaned, there will be a call to inform the check-in. The No. 3 building I stayed in basically didn't see any service staff (except for the cleaning aunt). The humanized service of the State Guesthouse was really disappointing.

Summary: Try to stay in Building No. 2 and Building No. 8 (the facilities introduced by the service staff are relatively new). The scenery is beautiful. If you are not picky about the service, you can still experience it.

msg:It is really the worst hotel in this trip. Almost all the hotels I stayed in during the trip were five-star or above. The service at the State Guesthouse forced me to write a review. First, the service staff did not speak a word when I met them. They were very indifferent. ! Secondly, it is understandable that the hotel facilities are outdated, but the bed board is actually a seesaw. I can't bear it. The most unbearable thing is the air conditioner. The temperature in the room is 28 degrees when the air conditioner is turned on. I called the service desk and was told that there is no air conditioner, which caused my family's blood pressure to rise. , I want to know if the five-star hotel does not have air conditioning in a 40-degree weather! It’s a bit funny! In short, as a state hotel, the soft service attitude is too shameful and makes people feel very cold! Later, we stayed at the Zhejiang Provincial People's Hotel, which was a breath of fresh air. Ctrip's service was very good and they made timely adjus**ents for us!

The bedroom is facing the inner lake of the West Lake. Every morning when I open the curtains, I will be impressed by the beautiful scenery in front of me. The bedroom is made of white marble with various Chinese items in Morandi green. Aesthetics are in place.

The room fee booked this time also includes 1 hour of travel photography. The photographer @Photography📷Xiaoyu (WeChat name) is a very tall and cute handsome guy. He is serious, patient, and super nice. He will always teach you how to pose. When choosing photos on the spot, they will help you choose together. The photos are very satisfying!

Strongly recommend West Lake State Guest Building 2 and travel photography! Remember to bring a good-looking cheongsam or Hanfu.

There are more and more people in West Lake in recent years. If you want to visit West Lake in peace, this is an excellent choice, and you can enjoy a section of West Lake for yourself. On the other side of the hotel lake is Leifeng Pagoda and Su Causeway.
The hotel is located in the depths of the West Lake. It is Yanggongdi, near Yuhu Bay, Prince Bay, and Turtle Lake. It is one of the most beautiful locations in the West Lake.
The history and culture of the hotel is also a highlight~

msg:Worthy of being a state guest house, the West Lake among the West Lakes [强]

The West Lake State Guest House began in the late nineteenth century and is located in the core scenic area of West Lake. The hotel itself is a scene of the West Lake, which vividly reflects the beauty of Jiangnan gardens, and contains ancient Chinese charm everywhere.

The hotel was rated as a golden diamond by Ctrip, which is indeed superior to ordinary five-star hotels.

The hotel was full on the day we checked in, but everything from the doorman, concierge, guest room to restaurant service staff was in order. It can be seen that the hotel has indeed hosted big events (such as the G20 summit).

The hotel has a scene at every step, and the environment, service, and catering are all excellent. Ziwei Hall, a Chinese restaurant in the hotel, has been rated as a two-star black pearl, and there is an endless stream of diners.
Surprisingly, there is even a turn down service.
The hotel is also very good at parenting. The room is equipped with children's guardrails, and there are special children's suits for babies.

The only downside is that the hotel is really old, the rooms are small, and the facilities inside are outdated.

However, in order to enjoy the beauty of the West Lake, this is still a good choice for Hangzhou!

It is very enjoyable to sit in the small pavilion with a cup of West Lake Longjing 🐲. Longjing is prepared in the room.

      In the evening buffet, you can drink all kinds of famous wines, and you can be ecstasy for a few hours.

      The furniture in the room is the old-fashioned solid wood decoration of the State Guest House, which is a bit out, but that is the feature of the State Guest House, isn’t it?
       The environment is first-class, and you can see the scene through the window. On a sunny day the next day, I went to the Su Causeway. There were a lot of people, and I walked back from the Huagang Fish Viewing Scenic Area. The interior of the State Guesthouse is even more beautiful than the Su Causeway, but it is actually facing the Su Causeway. You can have a good time. Also visited the place where Chairman Mao lived.

MINIBAR in the room: There are a lot of drinks, probably worth about 156 yuan, and I didn't finish it, so my friends took them away.

Appoin**ent: very good shot, super cost-effective


Service: The yard is huge and there is a shuttle bus. Each of us ordered a set of Bulgari body wash and hand cream. The price of a set is two to three hundred, which is very high-end.

Environment: How should I put it, it's like living in paradise, just in the West Lake scenic area. I don't know why, I haven't seen any birds in the hotel, it feels very rare. The exterior photos of the hotel are very nice.

Will go to the hotel to live in the future. As for the rooms, I personally think they are pretty much the same. It is okay not to have a room with river view. After all, there are very few people in the hotel, and there are views everywhere.

What I like most is the environment of the entire hotel, which is private and quiet. Living in the West Lake, looking at the Sudi Leifeng Pagoda on the opposite bank, taking a walk and climbing a hill, it takes 5 kilometers to walk around.
For breakfast, tofu nao and scallion pancakes are my favorites, and Dingsheng cakes are steamed on the spot. Pianerchuan is average.
The service is also very good.
Ziwei Hall is a must-eat every time you come, and the overall cost performance of taste, environment and service is slightly higher than other Black Pearl restaurants.

Unfortunately, the beauty of the garden is still the same, and the service and food are not satisfactory, but the price has soared without hesitation. I booked the pro-lake room in Building 2. The so-called scenery outside the window of the lake is just a pond, due to poor maintenance, the water is full of floating objects. The hotel replied to the inquiry that such a room belongs to the top three lake-friendly rooms in Building 2. It can only be hehe. Hotel breakfast standard is very average. The taste of Ziwei Hall also feels that its reputation is greater than its substance. The garden is still very beautiful. It's just that the current business spirit of blindly looking at money and blindly pursuing cost reduction has already diluted the reputation of the State Guesthouse. It can only be said that today is not what it used to be.

msg:The West Lake state guest would like to stay here next time he comes to Hangzhou. The service and environment are fine. There is no end to the garden. The flowers are in full bloom. The only thing that is lacking is that the room is a bit small. I will stay this time. Building No. 7 is very quiet and elegant. It is very convenient to check in. There are courtesy cars to pick you up and drop you off. The front desk told us that Building No. 2 has just been renovated and the rooms are relatively large. Next time, you can choose the lake-view room in Building 2 or Building 1. By the way, although there are not many varieties of breakfast, every ingredient is fresh and made with care. All in all a great memory!

The room is very clean and convenient. Outside the window is lined with trees and birds are singing and flowers are fragrant. If you want to eat, you need to go to Building 8. If you don’t want to leave, you can call The hotel's battery car pick-up service is very good. Before I checked in, I heard that the Ziwei Hall of the hotel was very good. Sure enough, I had to queue for a long time, but the restaurant was very good and did not disappoint. The location of the hotel is also very convenient. We basically took a stroll around the beautiful scenery of the West Lake. We also took a boat and swam in the lake. In short, it is highly recommended

msg:The hotel is a garden hotel that can be enjoyed for a whole day. It is full of scenic spots where you can taste and gain historical knowledge. This is the third time you have stayed in this hotel. When you checked out and waited for the bus, you found that the garden workers of the hotel were in Building No. 8 ( Picking tea leaves at a pavilion next to the front desk). When approaching the pavilion, I found a stele and a photo with an inscription inscribed by a former leader of Zhejiang Province. It is the place where Chairman Mao Zedong picked tea.
        After the taxi arrived, the door attendant habitually helped us carry our luggage to the trunk of the car, and asked me if I was sitting in the passenger seat or the back row, and opened the door for us, which reminded me of a handsome guy who drove a battery car to see us off on the afternoon of the 26th. Not only got off the car to help us with our luggage, but also sent us to the guest room on the second floor.
     The beautiful scenery of the garden, the history and humanities, the footsteps of the chairman, and the excellent staff of the West Lake State Guesthouse make us never forget it. Although we only stayed three times for a total of six days in three years, it made us want to stay for a long time and return to enjoy this happy place. time.

I live in Building 7, which is just facing Sudi’s room. The room is very spacious because of its high ceiling. The newly renovated facilities are relatively new, but I don’t know if it’s because the wall heater has been turned on for a long time. I don’t feel anything. The air conditioner is turned on...the bathroom is also very large, and there is a jacuzzi 🛁, and you can have a battery car to pick you up from other buildings or the gate.
I went to Ziwei Hall for a meal. The West Lake Vinegar Fish is delicious😋 Others are okay, maybe my expectations are too high. The fruits I gave are cherries and red beauties, which are still delicious

msg:This is the first time I want to seriously write a review. Before I set off, I had to choose the State Guest House or the Xizi Hotel for a long time. Because I am very afraid of very old, musty rooms. I saw netizens say that Building 2, Building 7 and Building 8 of the State Guest House have been renovated. So I finally chose the State Guesthouse. Then Building 2 was full of rooms. I saw someone say that Building 8 is here because of the restaurant, and check-in is here. So I chose Building 7. Well, let's talk about the experience of staying here, for the reference of netizens:
1. Location: Right on the edge of the West Lake, we live on the first floor of Building 7, and the West Lake is just outside the balcony on the first floor. However, it is still 3 kilometers away from Su Causeway and Leifeng Pagoda, so you still need to take a taxi.
2. Room condition: The room smells musty! ! And there are obvious large areas of mildew in the bathroom. This is beyond me and I cannot understand. I don't know about other buildings, but there are rooms on the first floor of Building 7 where I live.
3. Service: It can only be said that the service at this price can not be regarded as high-quality, and of course it is not bad. Just one thing, I booked two rooms, and I was given one when I checked in around 12 o'clock. The other one was not given to me until 1:30, so I went to the front desk to urge it. The front desk was a little impatient at the time, and they were perfunctory on the grounds that they all checked in at 2 o'clock. Then ask again at 2:30, I thought to myself
It should be almost the same. but! ! ! not at all. The room was cleaned, they forgot to check the room, and then no one remembers about my room. I can only say that this detail is really not well done.
4. In addition, if you can book Building No. 8, I don't think it's bad, because the hotel is very big, and you need a shuttle bus to go to and from it, for meals and so on. It's so inconvenient.
5. The hotel can't deliver the takeaway, we have to do it ourselves
Pick it up at the hotel gate. You can walk to the door, basically it takes 10 minutes to walk. Or you can call a shuttle bus to take you to pick it up. Not too convenient. For your reference.
6. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, neither good nor bad. can eat. Nothing particularly amazing dishes either.

The south gate is close to the fresh fish in Huagang, the north gate is close to Maojiabu, and the middle gate is in the middle (nonsense). I stayed in Building No. 3, which is generally old and has a smell in the building. Fortunately, there is no smell in the room. The room is a star-level layout in the 1990s with complete facilities.

msg:On a misty and rainy day, I temporarily stayed at the West Lake State Guesthouse by the West Lake, building No. 3. The room is not big, but you can walk a few steps to the lake. The garden view is really superb. I recommend taking a walk in the garden at night. It's super itchy, Yang It feels good to breathe freely after Kang. Building No. 8 has a rich buffet breakfast, and the dining environment is also good. For dinner, you can go to the nearby Zhiwei Restaurant. Turn left at the gate and walk for 7 minutes. The hotel customer service is very friendly, and I will stay again next time! recommend! 🍀

msg:West Lake State Guest House yyds, Building 2 of West Lake State Guest House yyds!
The environment of West Lake Country has been summed up overwhelmingly on the Internet, and all the good reviews are correct. That’s it, Hangzhou No. 1, West Lake with a thousand years, Liuzhuang with a hundred years, the hotel is a scenic spot.
The old building of the State Guest House may have the style of old cadres, but there must be no problem in Building 2, with new Chinese decoration, Bulgari bath products, Dyson hair dryer, Jacuzzi, surrounded by lakes on three sides.
I won't go into too much detail about Ziwei Hall, it's delicious, delicious, and not expensive. I hope every friend who stays here will taste it.
As soon as he lived in the West Lake country, he became involved in poetry and painting.
Due to the epidemic, the room will not be cleaned for two consecutive days, but the equipment will be fully prepared.

The pavilions, pavilions, small bridges and flowing water in the park are all worth visiting, and there is actually a museum. This time I booked for my parents. The room in Building 3 is a bit old, but it is said that the view from the window is very good. The new building is Building 78 (the picture is No. 7). The breakfast is delicious, and the waiters are kind and courteous. The whole hotel occupies a large area with few rooms. It has a private West Lake line. Looking at the Su Causeway in the distance, while watching the bustling tourists on the Su Causeway, while strolling around the lakeside of the hotel, it has a special taste~

msg:This is the second time I have come to West Lake State Guesthouse. The 6th is my birthday and I checked in on the 5th. The garden is still very beautiful, you can go shopping for half a day, the hotel is far away from the Su Causeway Leifeng Pagoda, and there are Yuhu Bay Su Causeway and other scenic spots around. Booked a view room in Building 7, the yard faces the hillside. The room is quite big, the facilities are a bit old, and the supplies are good. Mouthwash and rubber bands for hair are also prepared, which is more detailed. On the 6th birthday, I had lunch at the Ziwei Hall. The environment is elegant, the dishes are delicious, and it meets the five-star standard. Much better than a buffet. The hotel delayed check-out by one hour, which is very good.
But the overall experience of this stay is average. Hotel service is the norm, but you don't feel at home. In addition, the air conditioner in the room roared very loudly, and it was still the same after debugging, because it was too late, and I didn't want to bother, so I had to turn off the air conditioner. The next day I informed the front desk, the purpose is just to hope that the hotel can pay attention to it, so as not to make the next guest feel uncomfortable. Mr. Ke returned to the room, and housekeeper No. 7 came to check, not to solve the problem, but to repeatedly emphasize our debugging problem. The husband was unwilling to entangle, and clearly told us that we would check out at noon, not for any other purpose, there must be something wrong with the air conditioner motor or the machinery inside. In the end, we didn't receive any feedback on this matter when we checked out! There are comments that birthday cakes will be given, but this time there is no such thing.

The rooms are high in height, separated from wet and dry, and have a special cloakroom. But check in fruit is too bad. In the 3,000-night room, there are many things in the box of coffee and tea bags that are not free, and even the Hupao spring water is not provided, which is a bit petty. Also, when I checked in, the temperature of the room was adjusted to 22 degrees so that I caught a cold. I planned to play for two days and checked out early because of the cold. The free travel photography service is good, and the service of the photographer surnamed Sun is satisfactory.

It is the West Lake when you come out. The scenery is still very good. You can walk to No. 8 in less than ten minutes Dining upstairs. The buffet is still very good. Seafood hairy crabs are very fresh. The ingredients are great. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant are not flattering, they are called black pearls. The three of us ordered three dishes. Two vegetarian dishes and one chicken dish totaled 454 The main reason is that the taste is not good, so I think it’s not worth it. The service is still good. The environment is also good. But the buffet is 240 and a child under 1.2 is not charged. It’s quite a deal. The breakfast is superb. .
The room is a bit small. Go back to that kind of old hotel. It has been renovated. The bathroom is smaller. It doesn’t affect the check-in, because the hotel is really beautiful. It’s still very comfortable to walk around in the morning. The fruit in the room was given to cherries.

The dishes in Ziwei Hall are a little expensive but definitely worth it. Every dish is carefully prepared and tastes great! The only downside is that the breakfast is too simple and the same every day. After staying for four nights, I feel that the breakfast is too monotonous!

The integrated West Lake State Guesthouse. As a garden-style hotel, West Lake State Guest House provides us with a variety of choices. The new Chinese-style Building No. 8 is misty and rainy; The colors are integrated, blended with historical highlights, bounded by the misty mist of the West Lake, and become a state guest in winter. It is worthy of being the first garden in the West Lake.
[Service] It is very humane, and makes people feel the way of hospitality like a state banquet. All employees are very temperamental and have high professional skills, and they treat guests very enthusiastically! Especially Xiao Zheng in the front office and Xiao Xu in the member depar**ent have been giving feedback on the accommodation situation, and the experience value is full! The hotel's shuttle bus is on call, and the little brother of the shuttle bus is also very handsome. This service is completely unfeeling except in West Lake State Guesthouse.
[Room] Although the room is relatively old, all the hardware facilities are just right and have everything you need. The bed was quite soft and very comfortable for a good night's sleep. The bathroom is very spacious, and the bathtub is also very new. Building 1 also provides Bulgari toiletries, which are very high-end and generous! At the same time, the hair dryer is also a Dyson hair dryer, and the State Guest House is also very careful in software and hardware. The setting of the sofa is very high-end, with a sense of a**osphere, the taste of old money, the experience is really different~

msg:Before the trip, I was moved by seeing all kinds of good reviews at home. Before the trip, I specially booked two hotels to change my feelings. I lived in Dahua for the first three days, and stayed in the State Guest House for the next two days. I booked two rooms at the State Guest House, one twin room in Building No. 8 and East Building No. 3. Building No. 8 is the most convenient. Check-in, meals, and swimming pool are all in Building No. 8. The breakfast is the worst buffet breakfast I have ever seen. The breakfast priced at more than 140 yuan, there are few varieties, and the area for the breakfast table is very small. There are three small square tables. The summer vacation in July is not the off-season. I don’t know. Was it like this before, anyway, it was like this when I came here. Dahua's breakfast is priced in the 60s. The breakfast variety is at least double that of the State Guest House, and the dining area is also larger. For this breakfast, I will never stay again and recommend the State Guest House to friends and family. I don't pay to live here just to see the scenery, but also to eat well, okay? I just feel that the State Guest House is expensive because it occupies a large area. Building No. 3 is really old and poor. There is not even a waiter in the whole building of Building No. 3, and there is no elevator. I read the reviews before and some people said it was bad. I still don't believe it, but this time I completely believe it. If you want to stay, don't choose Building 3. The only bright spot is that the hotel's travel photography is not bad, and the photographer Lele is very good. Each room has a limit of five photos for free, and you can buy more if you like it.

The East Building is so dark that you can shoot a ghost movie. Turning around on this small road requires some driving skills. After waiting for a long time, no staff came to rescue us, so we had to save ourselves. The hotel is old and smells everywhere. It took me until 3am to take a shower. I woke up at 10am. I asked the hotel what time breakfast was, and it ended at 10am. The humanized service was so bad that I wanted to curse. There are so many hotels in Hangzhou, I had to find a hotel by the lake. The mirror on the dressing table in the room faces the bed. It scared me to death. The faucet was running at the same time.

       This time I invited others (one of them is my sister) to live in Liuzhuang, West Lake (in building No. 8), because they happened to go to Zhejiang to play.
       The Ctrip order told me that the hotel will have a welcome fruit worth 40 yuan. After they moved in, I asked them how they felt, and they said that the scenery was nice and the courtyard was beautiful. I casually asked what the 40 yuan welcome fruit gave me, but it turned out that there was no welcome fruit at all. I wonder, can a hotel of this level not afford to lose even a little bit of fruit? Originally, I wanted to know whether the welcome fruit was fresh, but it turned out that I didn't give it at all.

msg:From check-in to check-out, the experience is very good! First of all, the location of the hotel is very good. It is on the Yanggongdi of the West Lake. It is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, and it feels like a big hermit in the city. The decoration design of the hotel is also very in line with the characteristics of the garden landscape. The lake and evening pavilions complement each other, and the residual lotus listens to the rain, which is very artistic. What impresses me the most is the service of the hotel. The service staff in every link are very sunny and positive, and the room service staff is also very gentle. The service makes you feel like a spring breeze.
The hotel's own breakfast has a lot of categories, which is acceptable. However, the cuisine of Ziwei Hall does not meet my personal taste, and it is worthless, but the environment is good. After eating, you can take a walk along the paths around the hotel to digest your food, which is very pleasant.
(Personally, I would like to make a small suggestion. I hope to update the hair dryer in the hotel. It really takes a long time to dry the hair.)

The next morning, when I opened the window and saw snow falling outside, I packed my luggage and went out to take pictures. Garden gardens, small bridges and flowing water, corridors, pavilions and rockeries, one step at a time, one scene, and you can also walk to the West Lake. When you check into the hotel, there are service staff delivering fruit and snacks. When you return to your room at night, they put your shoes by the bed, and your nightgown from the closet to the bathroom. These are the most convenient places to use at night, and the bathroom is also paved. The carpet is soft and comfortable to step on.
The lobby is some distance away from each building where you live, and you need to take a tram. The service is all handsome and polite young men in black coats, gloves, and scarves.

msg:The environment is very good, but the service needs to be strengthened
1. Tell the front desk to register the invoice information, and the invoice will be issued in advance on the morning of the check-out day to reduce the check-out time. This is the routine operation of most hotels, but they are firmly told that it can’t be done, and the invoice can only be issued after check-out. Worried about consumption, only the room fee can’t work? What's the point?
2. There are too few meals. The Chinese restaurant does not provide any convenience for hotel guests to make reservations, and all outsiders line up to get a number. The business is good. The buffet is noisy, and there is no other food.
3. The breakfast service is not good. If you ask where something is, you will only point your finger. After eating a tofu brain, you have to search a few times, and you have to be trained by the waiter to line up with the cake collector. Shouldn’t this be placed in the self-service Well, why hide it.

The Dyson hair dryer is also high-end, but the chocolate used in the bullet coffee machine does not seem to match the orange-flavored drink. You can enjoy free beer, beverages and snacks in the refrigerator. Although I didn't drink it, it was very heartwarming.

Environment: first-class environment, lush green coverage accounts for most of the area of ​​the State Guest House. Let you be immersed in the green plants. Walking is very pleasant and comfortable.
Dining Hall: The Hangzhou cuisine in Ziwei Hall is not flattering. The per capita consumption is high, so-called black pearls, but the chefs have not shown the level of Hangbang at all. The West Lake vinegar fish sauce was too thick and the fish had a strong earthy taste. Shrimp is also overly starched. The taste of bayberry soy shrimp is a little less sugar. The only Sister Song Fish Soup is the authentic Hangzhou taste. The only regret is that this dinner gave the State Guesthouse a lower score. I hope that the dishes can be improved next time to enhance the image of West Lake State Guesthouse.

It is really beautiful and unexpectedly beautiful. The chef also impressed me deeply. Afternoon tea at Red Bar, buffet dinner at hotel, Lagerstroemia hall and breakfast at coffee shop are all amazing. The West Lake vinegar fish in the Ziwei Hall of the State Guest House is my favorite. There is also Dingsheng cake for breakfast, which is full of a ton. The room is a little small, and the next time you increase the experience, change to another floor. You can hang out in the hotel with the elderly, no need to go out to visit the West Lake

The hardware facilities in Building 7 where I live are very good, and the West Lake can be seen vaguely from the balcony. The hotel itself is located in the West Lake Scenic Area. The Su Causeway and Leifeng Pagoda are across the water from the hotel, and the beautiful scenery is unobstructed.
The point is, the service of the hotel is very good, everyone is very polite, and all kinds of services are in place. There is one special thing here, which makes me super moved. The hotel where my daughter and I stayed on July 4, we did double nucleic acid and antigen tests when we left the airport. We just went to the nearby nucleic acid test after eating at noon the next day. It was less than an hour after the nucleic acid was finished, and I suddenly found that the Hangzhou health code had changed from green to yellow. We contacted the epidemic prevention service number, but for nearly an hour, we could not get through or we could only check and not change. In this case, we will go anywhere. No, I can only wander on the street, and I had no choice but to call the hotel. After the hotel learned about the situation, they told me to go back to the hotel to rest first. They contacted the epidemic prevention depar**ent to help solve it. When we returned to the hotel room, the hotel called to say that it was over. After the coordination was settled, the epidemic prevention depar**ent also called to verify the situation. After 10 minutes, the code changed back to green. The hotel is still calling to ask if the problem has been solved. I am really touched, otherwise I will not be able to go home.
In terms of diet, the hotel's breakfast is not only rich, but also delicious. Ziwei Hall is worthy of being a black pearl restaurant. The taste is delicious, and the West Lake vinegar fish is especially delicious.

The toilet is an old-fashioned flip toilet with no heating function, and it is cold to sit on. The three most annoying points: there are few varieties of breakfast, and almost all of them are unpalatable; dinner is 286 yuan per person, but the ingredients are almost all made of very cheap, and they are also unpalatable; At dinner, I saw the male waiter in the restaurant holding the head of a large metal spoon for the soup with his bare hands, and then placed it on the table like that. These should be the spoons we used for breakfast the next day. So is the service attitude. Compared with the room rate of more than 2,400 yuan, the price/performance ratio is too low. And travel is extremely inconvenient. Apart from taking a taxi, there is no other way to travel, because the bus has to walk at least 1.3 kilometers after leaving the hotel gate. There is no restaurant around, not even a supermarket or a convenience store. You have to take a taxi when you go out to eat. car.

If you wake up early to watch the sunrise, it will be even better if you smell the fragrance of sweet-scented osmanthus and enjoy the beautiful scenery. After reading the comments of netizens, I chose Building No. 8. Later, I realized that Building No. 8 is not the best location, but it is more convenient for restaurants and gyms to be located in Building No. 8. The twin rooms in Building 8 are said to be garden view rooms. The garden view is a little different from what I thought. The courtyard is enclosed by solid walls; the privacy is very good, but in comparison, I prefer a little more Transparent design. Next time you come, you can try other buildings, the scenery should be better.

I was about to say "Why don't you take me to find a place", but the little brother didn't wait for me to say it, did you stop like this outside? Did you not think before you said this? But it's Chinese New Year, I'm too lazy to argue with this kind of person. Later, after I asked him to take me to a far distance to park, the little brother came over with a blank expression and said, do you want me to take you there.
2. On the night of New Year's Eve, I had dinner at the Ziwei Hall, which was said to be open until 10 o'clock. Just after 9 o'clock, a kind of service staff ran out anxiously, calling home for the New Year while walking. Of course, I can understand the eagerness to go home for the New Year, but since it claims to be open until 10 o'clock, can we consider the customer's feelings, just like this, how dare you charge a 15% service fee?

The overall feeling is that I want to pretend but reveal a petty air. learn from others

I also had to take a bottle of water away, but I said it wasn't available and didn't want to help. It was really not as enthusiastic and energetic as the young front desk at Atour.

🚗 Transportation: Entering Yanggongdi, there are the South Gate and the Middle Gate. The middle gate is usually the passage for employees, but there are bicycles for rent. The next morning I went in and out of there and rode a bicycle to Sudi, and then walked to Quyuan Fenghe Then go back to Yanggongdi and bike back to the hotel.

🧹Hygiene: It may be because it is in the garden, there are 🐜 on the floor-to-ceiling windows in the lobby, and there are 🦟 in the room, of course, these are understandable. The room is clean and the decorations are quite delicate.

🔔Service: The self-service hall in Building 8 of the hotel, because of the heavy rain that night, I chose to have dinner there. 5.30 pinch points to let people in, there are few categories, the taste is average, and the attitude of the clerk is also relatively lazy and negative. Overall, the experience is average, not recommended.

msg:I learned about the rich history and excellent scenery of the West Lake State Guesthouse from the Internet, and decided to see it believing. After moving in, I felt well-deserved. West Lake State Guest House is located on the west side of the West Lake. The hotel is surrounded by mountains and lakes. Although there are several popular attractions nearby, it is very quiet. The hotel is lined with trees, green grass, and the water of the West Lake flows through it. It is a beautiful place in itself. The beautiful gardens, coupled with the excellent lake view, make a stroll through it an excellent sightseeing experience. The decoration is a combination of Chinese and Western, which is very elegant and low-key, making people feel comfortable. The hardware is of normal standard and quite satisfactory. It may be a few years old, and the floor has been hollowed in some places, but it has little effect. The details are in place, all kinds of utensils that guests may use are prepared in the room, and summer and cleaning supplies are also presented, which is very good. The service of the staff is also very comfortable. All the service staff have basically met and greeted each other with attentive service and a friendly attitude, which is better than that of most hotels, and also changed my impression of the rigid and rigid Chinese-run hotel in my heart. It&#39;s just that the concierge rarely seems to take the initiative to help guests open and close the doors and pull luggage. I don&#39;t know if there is no requirement in this regard. It would be better if they could be more enthusiastic and active in this regard. Finally, a small comment, because the ecological environment of the hotel is very good, and I live on the first floor. When I went to bed at night, I suddenly found a big reptile on the floor that I had never seen before. It was really disgusting and bad. . Hope the hotel can do more frequent and meticulous in insecticide. If you are afraid of bugs, it is also recommended to choose to stay on the second floor, which may be better. All in all, this stay is still a very satisfying experience, the stay at this hotel is a great vacation in itself and highly recommended.

I was a little worried about the room before I came. The package is a courtyard view, and I guess it may be the old cadre style. After arriving, I found that the room was also renovated. It is in the east area of Building 3, very close to the West Lake; relatively speaking, Building 7 and Building 8 are relatively new, but far from the West Lake. So there are pros and cons to each. The style of the room is also very nice, and the bedding is very comfortable.

The hotel is very big, not to mention the landscape, yyds

(Although it is not very good to step on one and hold one, but...) I have lived in the same type of Wangzhuang before. Comparatively speaking, the rooms in Xihuguo are much better. The basic rooms in Wangzhuang are completely veteran style; The management and service still have the feeling of an old state-owned enterprise, while the service staff of Xihuguo make people feel very educated, restrained, and more professional.

To bring children under 6 years old, and families with elderly, this hotel is the best choice for vacation.

Also, there were people wearing robes for breakfast before, and no one bothered to remind them. Pay attention to basic public dining etiquette. In addition, there is a restaurant in the hotel, the price is not cheap, but the ingredients and taste are very good, especially the matsutake rice and wild kale, which are very delicious, and the red bar for afternoon tea, the taste is very good, the whole hotel is very big, It's just by the West Lake, if you don't want to go to the West Lake, the yard is not bad. On May 1st, there are many people who bring the elderly and children on vacation. Overall, this is an excellent resort hotel, you can stay in the hotel all day, eat, drink and go shopping, the quality is very good, recommended! !

msg:The experience is as good as ever. I feel that the hotel is very attentive. The last time I came to express my opinion, I hoped that there would be more steamed snacks suitable for children for breakfast. This time I really added Chinese snacks such as barbecued pork buns and millet cakes. Then the dishes in Ziwei Hall are not salty after the remarks to be light, and the taste is just right. The room hardware, service efficiency, children's playground and scenery experience are all very good, and the children's duck toys are also given. Although the buffet dinner is not particularly rich (the reasons for the epidemic are understandable), the quality of the products is very good, and there are many desserts, and I am generally satisfied. During the epidemic, the hotel management was very strict, so you can stay at ease and comfortable, and will come again when you have time.

It reflects the high-quality requirements of hotel management for personnel!

The front desk said that after the license plate was reported, I could enter and leave for free, but the security guards were delayed when I went out. Give it, reverse the car back and forth, toss for a long time, and slowly call for review. All kinds of bad experiences. Early in the morning, in a hurry, a fire.
Worst experience in Hangzhou hotel stay. This is the feeling of a big shop bullying customers. The service is really bad. It's a pity that such a good location. Is it worthy of the various reputations it boasts of? The first time I gave a bad review, I couldn't bear it.

On the first day of check-in, it happened to be my child's birthday. I didn't mention it because I celebrated my birthday at home earlier. The staff took the initiative to bring my child flowers and cakes, as well as blessing cards. We were very moved. The little brother at the front desk helped us open the door and saluted us.

Buildings 1 and 7 are the closest to the West Lake, but you still have to go to Building 8 if you want to eat or something, but there will be a car to pick it up. So from the point of view of convenience, it is the most convenient to live in Building 8! I originally booked a room in Building 7, but later the hotel helped me upgrade to a courtyard room in Building 8, but in fact there is not much difference in price between Building 7 and Building 8! Although I didn't take any photos, the overall impression is that it is really very good! After getting up in the morning, my wife and I walked around the West Lake in the hotel. It is very beautiful, and the key is not to squeeze in the scenic spot! By the way, don't go to scenic spots on Saturdays and Sundays, the traffic is so congested that you have to believe it!

msg:Continuing with the previous comment, I stayed for 7 nights in two buildings. Let me talk about the difference. Because in the second half of the Spring Festival holiday, there are very few residents in Building 3, so it is very quiet. Building, you have to carry your luggage by yourself, there are only 4 parking spaces in front of the building. Building 8 is a residential building. It is very convenient to go to eat. There are waiters to carry luggage. There are many parking spaces, but there are many guests. There is an obvious sound, I don't feel it during the day, but it is especially obvious at night when it is quiet at night. I live in room 8115, and there is a block in front of the room. For several days, I was woken up by this sound after 4 am. I was a light sleeper. Glue all loose floor tiles firmly. The room in Building 8 is larger, the facilities are obviously higher than those in Building 3, the lighting is comfortable, and there is a coffee machine, but the water output of this coffee machine is obviously less than that of other models of the same brand. I brought my own coffee machine, but I still use it. My own, coffee capsules taste sour. The refrigerator in the room is furnished, not refrigerated, and the drinks in it are charged, so I brought a dual-use refrigerator and soda in the car, and a can of iced drinks after taking a shower is the most comfortable. Building 8 has fruits delivered every day, and epidemic prevention gift packs are delivered every other day. The green tea hand cream inside is good. During the epidemic, go to the front desk every day to report to check the health code and check the temperature. If I like quiet, I still live in another building. It is convenient for those with inconvenient legs and feet to stay in Building 8.

Although I did not stay in a family room but a courtyard room, I sent children's supplies when I saw children. There are five types of pillows to choose from, and the lavender and children's neck pillows were chosen that day. But the bed was hard and the whole family couldn't sleep well. Sound insulation is not very good. As for the buffet, the richness of the dishes is average (compared with the World Trade Center and Sheraton), but the pudding has 120 likes, which is not sweet or greasy. The next day, I went to the Ziwei Hall at noon, and I ordered it more homely. The drunken shrimp with bayberry wine also received 120 likes.

The restaurant, the red bar of the Internet celebrity afternoon tea, the swimming pool and the gym are all in Building 8, which is very good👍! On the seventh day of the seventh day of the first ***** month, it snowed in a hard-to-see goose feather in Hangzhou. I enjoyed the snow scene at the same place where the great leader Chairman Mao enjoyed the snow. The entire State Guest House was so beautiful! It is really the West Lake in the West Lake! Thanks to my persistence and the company of my husband, Mr. Luo Yimin's book Liu Zhuang Centennial allowed a Hangzhou citizen to calm down and study history.

msg:First of all, let's talk about the satisfaction
1. The hotel doorman is very professional and patient! Assist the elderly to quickly check the health code and itinerary code
2. The hotel doorman is very active to help with luggage
3. Every employee at the front desk of the hotel is very polite, thoughtful and enthusiastic
4. The scenery of the hotel is very good, and my parents are very satisfied with the environment of the hotel
5. During the Spring Festival, the hotel gave children a lot of small gifts, and the children were very happy
Next, let’s talk about areas for improvement
1. Continuous check-in, room drinks, bathrobes are not updated in time
2. Children's toiletry bag did not send the whole set the next day
Both of the above were improved immediately after calling room service
Finally, let's talk about the hotel's food and beverages
1. I ate 2 meals in Ziwei Hall, and the dishes are basically OK. Among them, "West Lake Vinegar Fish" has been recognized by the whole family. It is sweet and sour, not greasy, fresh and smooth. Although the "Hangzhou Zhan Yuyuan" fish ball is freshly made, it is too salty to eat, and the salty taste overwhelms the umami. We ate it on the evening of 1/29, and I don't know how other guests taste when they eat it at other times.
2. During the stay, the hotel offers afternoon tea. The tea is packed in large ceramic cups, and the waiter should be called to store the water. The dim sum is not as good as the city bakery's. Sincerity is too perfunctory. . . The last picture is a picture of the afternoon tea
3. After experiencing the free afternoon tea, I feel that the tea, drinks, and snacks in the hotel's red bar are much better, and the service is much better. At least it is a tea set for afternoon tea, and a small storage kettle is also provided. The most recognized by the whole family is the caviar stinky tofu and crab cakes, which are very unique and delicious.
4. The breakfast variety in the hotel is not rich enough. It is estimated that there are few foreign guests during the epidemic period, there are too few Western-style varieties, and sliced bread has not been updated in time.
This Spring Festival coincides with the outbreak of the epidemic in Hangzhou. The hotel provides epidemic prevention kits every day, and the hotel has a strong taste of the New Year. I am generally satisfied with the environment and service of the hotel. Hope the epidemic in Hangzhou will pass soon 🙏🙏🙏

msg:A hotel in the fragrance of birds and flowers, it occupies a section of the West Lake shoreline. This time I live in Building 7, which is very cost-effective. Although it is not the latest decoration in the entire hotel building, it was renovated in 2014, but the hardware is still very good. The design of small details is good, the TV in the bathtub, the small counter for the mobile phone in the bathroom, etc., are very user-friendly. Every day on the balcony of the room, you can see the little squirrels on the trees outside the balcony and the West Lake not far away. Dingjiashan is behind Building No.7, the hill is not high, and there are many historical sites such as the Great Man’s Reading Place. If you want to breathe in the fresh air by the lake, you don’t need to take the hotel’s on-call shuttle bus to the restaurant in Building 8. It’s not a long walk along the lake. Breakfast, Internet celebrities, afternoon tea and red bars are all in August. Building No., but you don’t need to go to Building No. 8 for check-in and check-out, you can do it at the front desk of Building No. 7

The No. 3 building I stayed in this time is relatively old, and the soundproofing is not good, but the overall price-performance ratio is very high, it is worth living! If there is no epidemic, housing prices can be imagined hahahahahahahahaha!

msg:The scenery of the hotel is really great, the facilities in Building 8 are relatively good, and it is very convenient for dining and travel. The whole hotel is just a small West Lake. Don’t worry about which building you live in, whether it’s a pro-lake view room or not, as long as you go out a little bit, it will be beautiful. The hardware facilities of the room are not top-notch, but everything is meticulous and warm. The tea cups are different and can be distinguished. The hygiene is also very clean. The restaurant environment is very good, the service and dishes are excellent. Next time I come to Hangzhou, this hotel will definitely be my only choice.

It’s worth it, with a small bottle of wine, it’s beautiful, I’m a little bit reluctant to leave here, next year I will have the opportunity to embrace this beautiful lake view again, and finally I would like to thank Zhang Xibo and Xiao Wang’s beauty in Building 2 for their diligent care.

msg:🍃Environment: This is the place where I dream of returning to a thousand revolutions, and the land I can't bear to leave, the Jiangnan water town, there is a paradise above and Suzhou and Hangzhou below. This is what I am talking about. It is really beautiful. The State Guest House also gave me a deeper understanding of Hangzhou. In the prosperous city in the depths, I came here as if a mortal had entered heaven, making me linger and reluctant to leave. Going out of Building One is the quiet promenade of the West Lake and the quiet boats passing by, which is really comfortable.
Stayed for 2 nights, one with a lake view room and one with a lake view, which were all amazing. I have already noted these 2 room numbers, and they will become my exclusive must-visit room in the future, hehe. Next time, I will undoubtedly choose here.

🔔Service: The courtesy car picks up quickly, and the various service settings are also very thoughtful. There are also gyms and swimming pools. I especially like the swimming pool. Room service is also very attentive.
Food: The restaurant's buffet is very appetizing, just by the lotus pond, the environment is full. Both lunch and dinner are in the Ziwei Hall. It may be my mouth. I haven’t eaten it for 2 days. The vinegar fish is not to my Cantonese’s appetite. The most amazing thing is the Dongpo meat, which melts in one bite, and fish soup. It's also very good. The most worth mentioning is the afternoon tea, the environment is also a must, and the dim sum is also delicious.

🚗 Transportation: The entrances and exits are guarded by door guards. Check the green codes of the guests strictly. It feels very safe.

msg:The long-awaited guest of state has always been unwilling because it is expensive. On weekdays, I happen to see activities in the hotel. Courtyard Room No. 7 has one parking and two meals, 2280 per night. You can choose buffet lunch or dinner, and you can place your order immediately. It is really convenient to go to Hangzhou now. The high-speed train is very fast in one hour.
There are really few people on weekdays, the hotel is beautiful and big, and the experience is very good. There is no need to wait in line for breakfast. The quality of the breakfast is very good. We recommend the freshly baked Meiguicai pork dumpling scones, which are fragrant and delicious. The taste of chopped green onion is not very good.
I like the quiet and different West Lake. The State Guest House is definitely worth visiting. I stayed in it for three days and haven't been out of the hotel.
But the air conditioner in Courtyard Room No. 7 is too loud. Maybe there are not many people on weekdays. When I called the reception desk, I immediately changed my room and upgraded it to the new building No. 8. The room is much larger and the facilities are new. Restaurants, fitness and entertainment are all in this building. If you didn't change the room, it would be unworthy to have a good rest for more than 2,000 nights. I originally came to take a vacation and rest. I hope that the hotel will be adjusted.
Think about it this time because of the upgrade. After all, it’s 3,000+ per night to choose Building 8, or choose this hotel when the weather is cool. Do not open the air-conditioning and open the windows, otherwise this The roar of the sky at night is really unbearable.
But the overall hotel is really good, and the environment and food can be adjusted.

It can be said that it is the foundation of thousands of years of Chinese civilization and the accumulation of hundreds of years of history to create today. The West Lake guest of China is fortunate to be able to experience his beauty immersively today. It is really an honor to thank this great era for giving us this opportunity. The small bridges and flowing water here, every plant and tree are stories, can make you awe-inspiring, you need to spend time and mind to listen little by little, a day is very short, but it also makes my trip worthwhile.

msg:The location of the hotel is excellent, because the garden-style hotel doesn't want to go out and stroll around in the hotel, so I chose to live here many times. First of all, the experience is good. I said that the location is better, and then it’s on the edge of the West Lake. The disadvantage is that the garden-style building rooms are relatively small and the internal facilities are relatively outdated. In addition, I feel that there are more cars during this stay. The traffic impacts the experience of visiting the principal, especially if it is not safe to bring children. Can you consider centralized parking? Furthermore, I hope that Ctrip will show on the Internet that the building numbers are available for guests to choose. I used to live in Buildings 7 and 2 that felt better, but this time Building 5 feels worse. The inexplicable noise is too much, and the room facilities are poor.

The No. 7 building where I live has a balcony, which makes it very comfortable to see. There are trees and streams, no mosquitoes! The only drawback is that it is a bit biased. It means to drive or take a taxi when you go out. The hotel’s buffet catering is good, although it is a bit expensive and there are not many things, but the quality is very good. The seafood is fresh and there are plenty of them. There are not many types of breakfast, but even the porridge is cooked carefully. Afternoon tea is not cheap, but it's okay. It's 15% service charge, which is not a big deal. There are more than 400 teas for such a set. There is a little distance between the building and the building, but you can call a battery car to pick you up at any time. The only thing that can be thorny is that the service is not enthusiastic enough, which is a bit different from other five-star + hotels. Next time I want to live, I don’t have to go to the scenic area. The hotel is full of scenery. When you go out, there are several couples who take wedding photos, and you know how beautiful the scenery is.

msg:This time I took the elderly and the children to play together. I saw the location of the West Lake State Guest House. I thought about enjoying the beautiful scenery of West Lake without going to the scenic area, and I decided the room. When I arrived at the hotel, when I checked in, there happened to be a team around the front desk. I couldn’t squeeze through. I was thinking about asking someone. A gentle beauty asked me if I was checking in and guided me to another counter. It went through quickly. When I arrived at the room, I also felt very satisfied. I booked the second building, which was newly opened this year, with elegant decoration and complete facilities. The scenery outside the window is pleasant and you can directly see the West Lake. The toilets are separated from wet and dry, and they are large, equipped with smart toilets, Dyson hair dryers, etc. The towels and bath towels in the hotel are fresh and clean, and everything is clean and tidy. The toiletries are from the Bulgari Blue series, which smells pretty good. Sanitation and cleaning were done quickly and in time. After I went to eat breakfast in the morning, the room was cleaned when I came back. Every day, fresh lotus and small fruits I don’t know what they are called. All the tea cups and tea sets used are porcelain sets for the state banquet. Elegant without losing the a**osphere. The mini bar is included in the room rate, with beer, orange juice, Sprite and two snacks. The father drank beer the first night, and asked someone to make up a beer the next day. As a result, they brought a whole set of mini bars to eat and drink. The hotel also has a pillow menu, guests can choose their favorite, and there are very intimate pillows for children. The bedding is clean and comfortable, and the air conditioning is very powerful. Before you came back to the hotel from outside in a profuse sweat, you would immediately cool off as soon as you entered the second door. The hotel’s yard itself has a good view and is called the West Lake in the West Lake. My parents took a stroll in the yard every morning after eating, and they also felt very comfortable. The hotel has an introduction booklet, there are stories about celebrities here, and there are also introductions to the small animals here. You can stroll around and find it by yourself. From time to time, little squirrels or birds fall by your side. The children are so happy. The hotel also has a wealth of parent-child activities and a children’s playground. Adults can also participate in scripture copying at night to settle down quietly. In order to live up to this beautiful scenery, I specially looked for a follower to take a family portrait for everyone. It's really good to take photos casually. Building No. 2 also contains a place for visiting the Liuzhuang. You need to make an appoin**ent in advance. This is the only high-end yacht on the West Lake. It is air-conditioned to tour the West Lake. It is more suitable for taking elderly people and children on board than the boats outside. The local tyrants can charter boats with the hotel, and the Liuzhuang number can also be chartered, even if it is more expensive, the hotel can also help guests to order an outside charter service, and the hotel can take you to the pier in front of the hotel. The hotel has a wide variety of buffets, you can eat local snacks, you can also go to the Ziwei Hall, and net red afternoon tea. In short, it is very suitable for vacation, relaxation, and parenting with a baby. I think it is excellent value for money. Parents and children agree. Later in Hangzhou, I will definitely stay here.

Hangzhou is limited on weekends. You can contact the hotel front desk in advance to make a vehicle report. Normal traffic can be carried out within 4 hours after the report.
The hotel’s service is very good, and the parents are very satisfied. It is said that every waiter, regardless of male or female, has an outstanding image. Every passing employee and cleaning aunt will say hello gently, which reflects the first-class standard of the State Guest House.
The swimming pool, buffet dinner, parents and friends rated it very well, with full marks. The weather is hot, if you are playing in the park, you can ask the front desk to arrange a battery car to pick you up, or you can drive around by yourself.

The room rate is getting higher and higher because of the popularity. Can it be cheaper? I can't afford to live in it.

But as a high-standard hotel, the hotel’s concierge, the front desk, and the service staff of the cafe and restaurant need to be improved. After staying for two days, I did not encounter a guest who took the initiative to greet the guests. Every waiter was sullied and completely faceless. With a smile, it doesn’t meet the standards of a five-star hotel at all.

2. Service. The service staff in each position have demonstrated excellent qualities. Basically, you can think of the front of the guests.
3. Dining. The business in the Chinese restaurant is very good. It opens at 5 pm and the taste is good. The buffet, everything is very delicious. Dongpo meat, matsutake bibimbap, etc. are excellent. There is freshly squeezed orange juice in the morning.

Only had breakfast in the hotel, but did not taste the lunch and dinner, because it only arrived in the evening, so the order was delivered to the room. The staff is very enthusiastic. They took the elderly and children to live in Building 8 with a price increase. It was too hot to change rooms. Remind everyone, the food outside the building is too unpalatable. None of them are delicious. I don’t know how the online reviews come out. The service is average and the tableware is not very clean. I don’t feel like eating back and forth is worse than eating at the hotel. Or order takeaway, or go to the surrounding area, I went to nearby Yintai for dinner, which is much cheaper than the building outside. I like the black cat of the State Guest House~

I don’t understand. What happened that day when Chairman Mao walked from Building One to Ding’s Mountain to study? The door is closed and there is no detailed introduction. I am very curious what books his old man read that day.
There are many reminders of "wild animals infestation" on the mountain. For good trea**ent, see the little leopard who has not been whereabouts! 😁 It’s a pity that except for mosquitoes, it’s just tweets. There are so many beautiful birds in the hotel, so beautiful!

msg:去年8月份來過酒店體驗了下午茶，感覺國賓館的景色一絕，可以在不受打擾下，盡情享受迷人的，優雅，安靜的西湖美景。
這次入住3號樓的房間，説實話，房間是有點舊，小，剛進去不太能接受。但想想也就一晚。
第二天的早餐，讓我感到有點意外，雖然品種不算很多，但是可以説是用心的在做，從五穀雜糧飲品，拌麪，到水果，特別要説的是水果都是鮮切的，沒有幾家可以做到。
總體來説，環境，服務，菜品都是無可挑剔的，配得上國賓館的抬頭。

對服務提點建議：我們這次是公共交通走到的南門，不知道其實有電瓶車可以接送，走了很長一段路到8號樓。我覺得門衞完全可以留心多問一句，告知有電瓶車可接送。對於國賓館這樣的品牌和價格，服務可以更上一層樓。

服務：服務特別值得一提，辦理入住的小哥、餐廳服務、禮賓都微笑服務，耐心解答，非常nice

入住期間在餐廳用餐很愉快，出入有專車接送服務到位，菜品雖然貴但味道不錯，訂單套餐贈送了下午茶顏值高味道好。
特別感謝入住1號樓的前台服務，因為外出不慎扭了腳，前台叫總枱送來了雲南白葯噴霧劑，用了效果不錯，沒有影響第二天的外出行程。前台還很耐心的介紹周邊可玩的地方，入住2天有賓至如歸的感覺。

最後旅拍的攝影師小武服務很好，很會引導調動被拍攝者的情緒。照片拍的也好。

msg:2間3晚8號樓房間，2.6k的單價絕對算不上便宜，按理説要獲得相應的服務應該至少是貴賓級別。不過國賓館的培訓工作似乎並不統一，觀感十分逆天。
首先是打電話前台諮詢，態度算不上不卑不亢，但也夠不着陰陽怪氣，估計是政務接待太多的毛病。不過幸好基本回答了我的疑問，屬於無功無過。

杭州的限行政策非常複雜，由於功課未做足，差點因為車牌單雙號的問題，無法進入西湖區域，幸好交管放行。無論是攜程或是國賓館本身都沒有任何提示，當然要求有些吹毛求疵。進入酒店後的體驗，相當反差，本着不被鼻孔看人的預期，結果前台態度特別好，看到父母年邁腿腳不好，積極幫我們找靠近大堂的一樓房間，非常感動。迎賓態度大多不錯，開關車門、提行李、甚至幫母上開合輪椅，做到眼中有事。

房間本身佈局合理，衞生間乾濕分離，有獨立衣帽間。但是卧室區化粧桌偏矮，無鏡子，小圓桌亦無法簡單辦公，略有遺憾。其餘毫無缺點，尤其一樓對外小天井絕對神來之筆。唯一需要注意的是天井門窗隔音一般，隔壁住客但凡在天井或陽台大聲説話，必定影響睡眠。歡迎水果藍莓車釐子蘋果橘子交替出現，很是精緻。某天服務人員提前收走了母上的水果，結果她提了一嘴，酒店立刻送來眼罩加以補償。由於帶小孩，喝水量較大，酒店也即是多放了瓶裝水。酒店也有開夜床服務，貼心準備了腳墊和小餅乾，讓人舒心。

大環境來説，8號樓最為便利，包含了大堂、餐廳、小童圖書館、健身房等設施。5號樓內有小童活動區，海洋球滑梯與商場內的配置無意。可惜酒店非親子類型，少見其他小朋友一起玩耍。1號樓附近是西湖堤岸與蘇堤平行，私享西湖風景。晚間酒店及西湖本身燈光極為剋制，呈現微弱光點。不同樓之間電瓶車通行，8號樓可直接讓迎賓安排，其他地點需要打前台電話。大體還算方便，需要吐槽的是某天打算去丁家山爬山，迎賓姑娘死活覺得應該從8號樓附近登山之後走完全程，但我認為從北門附近上山更好，最終説服迎賓安排車輛。結果證實猜想，北門上、5號樓下比較合理，先看景點後行步道，結束後回房間方便，無需再叫電瓶車。迎賓可以提出建議，但沒必要替住客做決定。

餐飲的話，早餐正常五星級水平，比較有特色的是定升糕，現場蒸制。片兒川與外面麪店無異。午市自助則略有不值，刺身三文魚普普通通。有幾道菜與紫薇廳的菜單重合，值得嘗試。重點還是紫薇廳，需要提前預訂，不上生猛河鮮的話，人均可以控制在400，否則無上限。烹調和做法都還不錯，比較有印象的是魚圓湯、魚膠、茄子和松茸飯。更多的是傳統菜的精工做法，個人非常滿意。

個人認為，40平方的房間是最佳選擇，25平雖然便宜一些，但肯定侷促。若無預算限制則可考慮更大房型。酒店本身原因導致出行不算特別方便，建議進出開車。當然如果使用酒店電瓶車到大門，再轉公共交通也是不錯的選擇。景區附近的飯店性價比一言難盡，還是以果腹標準看待即可。

總體而言，達到心理預期，小處仍有改進空間，值得再次入住。

設施：二號樓是近年來全新裝修，設施很新很人性化。
衞生：帶小月齡寶寶住店對衞生要求很高，國賓館真正讓我很省心，離店時也看到保潔阿姨全屋消毒。

環境：國賓館環境不用多説，與西湖融為一體，既有自然環境的宜人更有人文歷史的加持。
服務：尤其要説到服務方面，不愧是接待國內外政要的首選酒店，帶長者小朋友最看重出行便捷和服務周到，遇到禮賓部孫經理，一路觀光車帶着轉完整個賓館並隨行講解，也積極聯繫了西湖全線旅遊安排。整個入住體驗感非常棒！

以後會常來，尤其打算安排父母每年的西湖養生旅遊選在此處～很推薦

鑒於酒店服務不錯，誠心提些建議（如果覺得普通民眾並非主要客户羣，可忽略）：
1、請提前向住客説明中門、南門衹出不進，或務必對已辦手續的住客提供出入憑證，住客無義務承擔不禮貌的喝斥；

2、據説北門的是便衣武警，但，軍隊是人民的軍隊，尤其在大眾入住的賓館門口時，需加強基本禮貌用語培訓，可制止但不可喝止，可威嚴但不可倨傲，不能脱離羣眾藐視羣眾，多一個“請”字不影響威嚴，至少我在別處從未遇見過如此倨傲的；

3、不要區別對待，或者，至少不要讓住客感受出來，若説為安全考慮不讓人隨意進入，那麼，如果我的刷卡付款記錄都不可靠，僅靠拖鞋、幾分鐘前的記憶，是不是漏洞更大？能確保拖鞋不是此前住客帶出去換人來穿？又或者出去再進來的六七個人你都確切記得長相，確保沒有換人？

服務一流，夠pro又個個靚仔靚女，有禮貌。夜晚幫我地開床，行李check in後本來call車去房，但係個靚仔工作人員話幫我地送房，咁我地可以即刻就出去玩，服務夠體貼。

房間設施好正，玩左佢個按摩浴缸，Dyson風筒一流。特別提下對拖鞋，真係超舒服。我都驚係幹部風，好彩2號樓新裝修，新中式，唔錯。走廊夠光猛。

早餐選擇好多，好豪氣有龍井、菊花自己泡茶，唔係茶包！

初初book驚地點偏僻，其實佢南門出去好快就可以call到的士（酒店可以幫手call的士或者佢地合作既商用車，去西湖銀泰附近架商用車都係50人仔，坐得舒服又唔貴），出去就係西湖網紅景點：烏龜潭、太子灣、浴鵠灣。我覺得位置其實OK窩。

住國賓館感覺好安全，雖然有非住客可以入到黎，仲要地方咁大，但係其實入面保安嚴密。

我覺得比5星酒店抵住，性價比超高。下次黎杭州一定要再黎，仲要住多晚！

問題在於，北有釣魚台，南有國賓館，這麼高的價值酒店，我遇到兩種問題。第一，入住的時候在房間發現上一個人客人留下的兩衹襪子，分別在房間的兩個不同角落，瞬間感到特別噁心，真懷疑有沒有一客一消毒。當然跟酒店反應後酒店也送了一份水果作為彌補。第二，大家留意圖5這張照片，是我們沏了一壺茶，我當時沒發現茶嘴是壞的，退房的時候要我們賠茶壺，但經過大家解釋最後沒有賠，我回來的路上才想起這張照片是個證據，但這明明是他們客房服務的問題呀，才會引起這些誤會，還讓客人退房的時候在眾目葵葵之下顯得那麼尷尬。
這裏表揚酒店用車服務，商務車價格合適，師傅很健談，熱情温暖。用車價格也很適中，普通人都能接受。既然是接待國家領導的，希望你們重視每個細節問題。

設施：房型設施有點陳舊，但該有的設施也都有，還有春節歡迎禮，很有愛。


衞生：很棒，每天還會有人多次打掃。


服務：非常專業，1號樓還有專門的管家，貼心也很贊。

唯一不足的就是出行困難，可能是在景區又是春節，很難叫車也很堵，這點大概是最大的不足了。

不過作為頂級酒店，還是存在一些瑕疵，首先早飯質量明顯還可以改進；其次西湖衹能看到蘇堤西側，不如汪莊開闊；電瓶車數量不少但服務人員數量跟不上，動不動等十分鐘以上，大夏天還是挺讓人鬧心的；房間單台盆設計，使用不方便；這個價位的房價，礦泉水數量有點摳門了，泡茶水還要另外收費略顯小氣
總體還是很不錯的酒店，希望越辦越好，下次來能有更好的體驗

酒店管理好，服務到位，看得出來服務員姑娘小夥兒都是精挑細選的，態度和善、形象出眾。
最讚的是酒店的園林景觀，坐擁西湖西岸美景，擁有私家湖岸，靜謐悠遠、一步一景。
早餐豐盛，但中規中矩，沒有驚喜。紫薇廳名聲在外，價格高昂，用料講究，但口味並不十分突出，性價比一般。
酒店遊船300/位，要提前預訂，我們沒訂上，衹能通過攜程訂了私享搖擼船，因為船速慢，去不了幾個地方。建議還是提前訂酒店的。
總之，不愧是國賓館，水準超一流。大家要相信領導們的品味，衹要肯花錢，不會讓你失望。

服務也沒得説，隨叫隨到。
設施扣1星是因為吃飯。如果攜程有單獨飲食的評分那我一定打1星。
諾大一個國賓館，吃飯的地方就兩個。黑珍珠的紫薇廳和早上吃早飯晚上開自助餐的咖啡廳。
紫薇廳是在點評上預訂的，週末的時間需要提前才能約上。住店客人沒有排隊優先我可以理解，但是想讓餐廳給我排上號，我在房間等，到了電話給我也不行：因為預訂是通過 大眾點評，要麼就去現場（服務員原話😂😂😂）。
咖啡廳的自助晚餐真的不提也罷。住店客人還是優惠價280/人（還要加收15%服務費）。食物品種少的可憐不説，2兩大小的清蒸大閘蟹還是限量的：清蒸海鮮區就兩個蒸籠，尺寸目測直徑35cm左右。規則上是不限量的，但大閘蟹一次就蒸17、8隻，一下子就拿完了。然後就換別的品種蒸，所以下一輪要等很久。我吃了一個小時左右，進去的時候前一輪正好拿完，吃到快結束出現了一輪我拿到一衹，然後就沒有了。
點外賣衹能放門口，要麼自己走出去拿要麼電話客房部派接駁車送過去拿。反正都不怎麼方便。
當然外賣放門口是為了維護酒店內環境，讓住客更加舒服，這能理解。但賓館是不是應該在餐飲方面也要改進一下。難道住酒店不想出去吃的時候，就衹能麻煩的點外賣或者餓死麼？！

msg:1.出於食品安全考慮，要客人自己去大門取外賣，要知道里麪很大，走路要走很久，對於一個已經洗完澡的女生來説坐禮賓車去大門取外賣很痛苦。
2.8號樓接電話的女工作人員請問你接客人電話得態度是認真的嗎？客人是欠你錢沒還還是怎麼了？
3.衞生間馬桶異味很大，淋浴的手持噴頭是不能旋轉的，衹能筆直的朝向衞浴門沖水，請問是我洗澡還是門洗澡？洗完澡出來水從門縫裡麪已經漏出去了，整個衞生間就非常崩潰的感覺。換頂噴，好，換了頂噴發現頂噴的水的噴射路線都是非常有想法的，天女散花，就是那種感覺，最後能落到頭上的水少得可憐。
4.整個房間非常老舊，開關面板已經舊得發黃了，整個房間沒有USB充電口。聽説2號樓都是戴森吹風機，而8號樓衹有一個非常舊的，還需要用大拇指按着開關才能有熱風的吹風機。看來還是得要有“元”才行啊！但是這個價位的住房在別的五星級飯店可以享受到更好的服務。
5.從頭到尾沒有人提前聯繫我入住詳細事宜，也沒有管家。
6.景色是真的不錯，園林也維護得很好！
7.總的來説，感受到了國企的傲嬌，非常傲嬌！下一次去杭州不會再入住貴賓館了！

設施：房間裝修有點老了，但保養不錯。
衞生：打掃乾淨，打掃衞生的阿姨很熱情。
環境：好得沒話説。住在公園裡呀，一大片西湖盡收眼底，還沒人打擾。
服務：前台的，打掃衞生的服務人員都很熱情。我們把保温杯落在前台去吃飯了，前台小哥哥幫忙收好還給我們。

飲食：吃的方面，自助早餐口味一般般，品類也不算多。中餐廳（紫薇廳）雖然份量不大，但是味道不錯，值得一試，而且內廳的景色很棒，推薦！酒店附近也有一家知味觀，從酒店閘口開始步行，大概10-15分鐘。

服務：酒店內的工作人員基本都挺nice的，會主動打招呼幫忙搬運行李，需要時叫電瓶車的速度也蠻快。

衞生：比較一般，我們房間的桌上茶壺裡的茶葉放了兩天都沒倒，但是喝的還剩一口咖啡的咖啡杯立刻就倒了換新杯子？？床鋪也衹是第一天有整理，第二天感覺就沒動過了。

設施：比較舊，但也是能接受的範圍。裝修風格是我過住的酒店裡比較亮堂的一家。現在很多酒店搞什麼氛圍感，燈光都是黃黃暗暗，真的不喜歡。隔音比較差也是真的。

整體來説，如果下次去杭州還是會考慮再次入住，因為環境真的很棒，但不會住2號樓的第一層，私密性不太行。

分享我們在西湖國賓館的難忘經歷和感動瞬間，感謝給予我們幫助和照顧的酒店同事。

msg:西湖國賓館的環境毋庸置疑，住一晚根本不夠逛，定的一號房，湖景很絕，設施略老舊，沒有淋浴房是站在浴缸裏洗澡。書桌牆面上的插頭也有松落。床太軟了，老公睡覺翻個身，我感覺自己都彈起來了，半夜嚇醒好幾回。康體中心很不錯，游泳池又大又乾淨，還沒什麼人。住店客人送咖啡廳自助餐的優惠券，去吃一下很划算，品種雖然不是很多，但是味道都不錯。紫薇廳打電話預訂説都滿了，結果一早去排隊，發現根本沒人，但是菜品和服務都是很好的。下次有機會住下別的樓。

msg:房間很新，但不大，現代風格，浴室很寬敞，按摩浴缸體驗不錯。早餐品質不錯，種類有點少。第一天晚餐嘗試了紫薇廳，低於預期，可能是有些吃不慣的原因。酒店內部挺大的，風景不錯，第二天吃過早飯，在酒店轉了一圈，很愜意。

msg:説説酒店的餐廳，紫薇廳，黑珍珠二鑽，價格合理，可以吃午飯和晚飯。還有個吃自助餐的咖啡廳，中午晚上都有自助餐，價錢合理，跟紫薇廳和入住的大堂圍成一個小內湖，園林景緻，所以酒店用餐環境相當好。再説説康體中心，有單獨的瑜伽房，有窗，窗外也是設計過的園林景觀，運動也會看見美景，讓人心情舒暢

紫薇廳的東西沒有想象中的那麼好，但是水準還是很高的。
