msg:To be honest, I am a person who doesn't like inns and prefers hotels. I am a bit picky about accommodation. But the Tengchong "Space Aesthetics" inn amazed me! ! This is the first time I want to write a review from the bottom of my heart! !
👉 Facilities and hygiene: It was just renovated last year, and all the equipment is new. It can be ranked in the top ten inns, so these hardware equipment are naturally nothing to say! ! And the design is simple but novel, and the owner's ingenuity can be seen! 
👉 Environment: The ten rooms have their own characteristics, but they do not interfere at all. They are all very quiet and private. There is a private hot spring on the balcony of the room to relieve fatigue. Of course, there are more beautiful views! Just sitting on the terrace, you can see the green mountains, hear the insects and cicadas singing, and the fresh wind brings a faint fragrance of flowers. You can feel the good time of the ancient city! (The terrace of the inn is the local Internet celebrity check-in coffee shop "Yunli Ka") At the same time, the inn is located in the center of the ancient city. It only takes a few minutes to walk to eat delicious food, go shopping, enjoy the mountain scenery, and take beautiful photos! !
👉 Service: Perfect! The humorous and talkative boss and the kind-hearted boss lady are warm and hospitable, and the brothers and sisters in the inn are even more considerate (I met a colleague from the company in the ancient town. After she patronized our inn, she decisively packed up and moved in 😀).
The room was upgraded on the first day we arrived; when we were drinking tea on the terrace, they took the initiative to deliver various fruit desserts; when we went out at night, they took the initiative to pick us up for fear that we would get lost; not to mention the night barbecue, sweet fruit wine, breakfast packed for the early flight, etc., are all small details, but full of care! ! Even the cat "Yuanbao" in the store would come to act coquettish from time to time😍

The five-day happy vacation passed in a flash. Thank you very much for the care given by everyone in the inn, thank you for meeting, and see you on the next journey! ! ❤️

The driver who picked us up will contact us one day in advance. It seems that the boss picked us up. You can also ask them to help send us to various attractions. When I went to the second hotel, I informed them in advance and I could book a car in advance.

Environment: As shown in the picture, the decoration is very good~ It looks good

Sanitation: Clean and hygienic, and basically everything is available. Their private sulfur hot spring is very comfortable~

It is very quiet and overlooks the beautiful scenery of Wild Duck Lake. The internal facilities are complete and the bedding is very comfortable. It is so comfortable to soak in the private hot spring every day after playing. The boss and the guys are very good and make people feel at home. Every night in the restaurant, we gather around the stove, roast tea, roast beef, tofu, corn, potatoes, etc., and everyone chats about everything. The breakfast is also delicious. The soy milk is freshly squeezed, the rice noodles are freshly made, the cakes are baked by myself, and there is even jackfruit in the breakfast fruit sea. In short, I am very satisfied.

There are brothers to pick you up and drop you off. The service is thoughtful. All the staff are very considerate. The small garden in the public area is very exquisite. It is a happy thing to make a pot of good tea in the evening and enjoy the quiet time in the ancient town. The boss and his wife are sincere and enthusiastic. It feels like home. I strongly recommend it to friends who come to Tengchong.

msg:🌟Design style:
The overall design of the hotel is simple and fashionable, while incorporating the traditional cultural elements of the ancient town. When you enter the hotel lobby, you will be attracted by the a**osphere here. The combination of pure white and wooden elements not only shows a sense of modernity, but also warmth and comfort. And those exquisite decorations and artworks add a bit of literary and artistic a**osphere here.
📷Photography and check-in holy place:
For friends who like taking pictures, this is definitely a good place not to be missed😀. Every corner of the hotel is full of design sense, which is very suitable for taking pictures and checking in. Especially the clear water platform on the top floor is a great place for taking pictures❤️. Here, you can enjoy the tranquility and beauty of Heshun Ancient Town while taking pictures with great artistic conception.
♨️Hot ​​spring experience:
The hotel is equipped with a private hot spring for each room, so that you can experience the fun of hot springs while enjoying a comfortable stay. Imagine what kind of experience it is to soak in a warm hot spring in the cold winter and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the ancient town outside the window?
🌄Sunrise beauty:
What's even more surprising is that in the hidden room where I stayed this time, I could enjoy the beautiful sunrise in the morning. When the first ray of sunlight☀️sprinkled into the room and illuminated the entire space, it felt as if the whole world was still for you.
Summary:
[Tengchong Space Aesthetics Hot Spring Hotel] is not only a place to stay, but also a space where you can relax and enjoy a good time. Here, you can feel the perfect fusion of design and nature, enjoy the beauty of the ancient town, experience the fun of hot springs♨️, and see the beautiful sunrise in the early morning. The boss is also very talkative and will talk about some of his own design concepts. If you happen to like architectural space design, you will definitely be in love with him~
The hotel will have a free airport pick-up or drop-off service. Since the ancient town is very large, if you are tired of shopping, you can also call the housekeeper when you are not busy and ask them to pick you up and take you back to the hotel to rest.

msg:The best experience of staying in a hotel in the past two years. For me, it should be better than a five-star hotel.
The first is that the decoration style is very quiet and relaxing. The various decorations are very attentive. Drinking coffee in the sun on the balcony of the room makes people feel integrated into Tengchong.
The second is that the service is very good. There were some small episodes on the first day and I was injured. The staff of the homestay accompanied me to the hospital. In the following days, I went to the surrounding area to play. Not only did they help me book the tour projects, but they even accompanied me almost all the way. At night, the staff on the first floor boiled tea around the stove, and also gathered with other guests around the stove. People with different experiences chatted and felt very relaxed.
The boss and his wife and the staff who got along with us more were very nice. I highly recommend it.

msg:The B&B is located halfway up the mountain, and you can see the Wild Duck Lake. The housekeeper will contact you in advance to find out where your car is parked, and drive a battery car to pick you up. The hot spring pool is on the roof, but unfortunately it is not separated from the public area, so the privacy is a bit poor, and the sound insulation is not very good. If you want to soak at night, the downstairs will complain that there is noise when you drain the water. I forgot to change the batteries of the candles in the pool twice. There is no elevator to climb to the 4th floor, so forget it. The service is still very enthusiastic. You can pick up and drop off when you go to the ancient town. The breakfast is a bit simple, not much to eat, and you can add some categories. Afternoon tea is provided. The room price is a bit high 🙂

There is a coffee bar, exquisite courtyard, and spacious and bright lobby at the entrance, which makes people feel refreshed. The leisure terrace on the second floor overlooks the entire ancient town. Each room has an independent terrace. You can open the window in the morning to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the ancient town. Worth recommending👍

msg:When I was doing my homework before booking, I had a good impression of this store. It turns out that choosing the aesthetics of the space was the right decision. For those who pursue comfort during the trip, a lot of the fun of traveling is related to food, accommodation and travel, and the aesthetics of the space is quite outstanding in these three aspects. 
Food: Although the breakfast stalls are not as numerous as those in a five-star hotel, the freshness of the single items is definitely worth scrutiny. Their breakfast includes thin bean powder, rice noodles, rice noodles, soy milk, porridge, milk, yogurt, fried eggs, sausages, grains, buns, fresh fruits, coffee... When eating breakfast the day before, the store also brought a piece of fried local specialty rice dumplings to each table (but fried rice dumplings should not be a standard breakfast). There are welcome refreshments and afternoon tea with a view on the day of check-in. In the evening, there are roasted tea and roasted tofu in the store. It is said that a guest spent 198 yuan to drink roasted tea outside, and came back to find that the store is the same thing. Maybe the tea outside is not as good as the century-old tree tea in the store. In addition, as long as you walk around the public area, the store manager will always greet you warmly. If you have time to sit for a while, he will ask about food and drink. It's a pity that every time I eat out, I don't have the chance to taste the free food in the store. 
Accommodation: The room is extremely beautiful. I'm even more fortunate that this time I got the good luck of the generous store. The two nights I booked were all upgraded to their highest-end big bed room for free, with an unbeatable viewing terrace. The store will place flowers on the terrace every day. There is an open-air hot spring bath on the terrace. Yes, I would like to call it a bath, not a bathtub🤭. The water flows out very quickly. After a day of visiting the ancient town, soaking in the hot spring soup before going to bed is very refreshing and helps sleep. The big bed is facing a floor-to-ceiling window. You can see the Wild Duck Lake by opening the curtains. It is really "looking far away at the green fields from a high place, and smelling the birds singing and the fragrance of flowers in the quiet room". I also like their mattresses. It's soft and supportive to sleep. It's a pity that I didn't leave a beautiful photo of the room, but the photos shown by the store are real shots.
Travel: Their location is very convenient. It is located in the west of the ancient town, very close to Wild Duck Lake, and there are many attractions nearby. It is very convenient to visit the morning market and eat. Free airport pick-up and drop-off service is provided. The price of the hotel and car charter is reasonable. They really care about the guests. It feels like a worry-free trip. The above is a personal real hotel evaluation. I recommend everyone to stay in Space Aesthetics for a short stay and taste your own experience. Finally, thank the store again for the hospitality. The trip to Heshun has become particularly beautiful because of your generosity and kindness and pursuit of service quality.

As soon as the booking information was confirmed, the boss called us as soon as possible to confirm the check-in time and whether we needed to be picked up. The hotel was very timely and thoughtful. The location of the hotel is in Heshun Ancient Town. Just walk down the stone path and you will find the Wild Duck Lake. The environment is quiet and quiet. There is a dedicated shuttle bus to pick up and drop off guests in the ancient town. There is also a business car for easy pick-up and drop-off. You can also ask the boss to ask for a ride to go to tourist attractions. The guy in the store is both a driver and a guide. He talks humorously and has a very pleasant experience. We were upgraded when we checked in. After checking the room type, the lady at the front desk also showed me around the public area. There is a coffee bar and restaurant on the first floor. There is a dedicated leisure area, fitness corner and terrace on the second floor. The hotel also thoughtfully prepared afternoon tea. It is very pleasant to drink coffee and enjoy the scenery of the ancient town. Many tourists come here. Check-in and take photos. There is also a large platform on the fifth floor of the hotel that is only accessible to hotel guests. It is especially suitable for enjoying the scenery, watching the sunset and watching the stars. I stayed with my best friends for three nights. All the employees in the hotel were very enthusiastic and very considerate. They prepared breakfast and washed clothes for us in advance. He took the initiative to help us dry the food on the platform connected to the room. We had barbecue takeout with our best friends in the restaurant. He also cut fruit for us and baked tofu wrapped in milk. It was a pleasure to get along with us for a few days. We will come back next time!

和順的日出藏在翻湧的雲霧裡
薔薇色的霞光把層層疊疊的羣山擁入懷中
它用這一池流光喚醒了和順的清晨
原來，這不是宮崎駿動畫裏的夢境


去見你的路上
有古樹懷抱、有彩舟雲淡
林間有霧，走過光影交織的石板路
霞光為鄰，近雲端，是空間美學

入目及下是古鎮居民錯落的院落
瓦片之下，是這座小城一生的柔軟和煙雨
於是，我決定多留一日
為眼前的景，也為這空間裏的故事

老城舊巷，青磚灰瓦
順勢而建、順巷而建、順其自然
就地取材，火山石築牆、楠木造屋
不刻意雕塑、不彩繪裝飾、不上油漆
四和三順、古樸厚重、隨意隨和

老闆娘笑盈盈的臉龐
管家貼心周到的下午茶
傍晚，在露台上等待一場日落
入夜，圍爐夜話、温酒煮茶

你要不要跟我一起去吹吹曠野的風
在觸手可及的時間裏熱情搖蕩
我期待自己有足夠的運氣和勇氣
去見生命裏各種不同的風

在這裏，聽風、看雲、做個懶骨頭
和順很慵懶、空間美學很爛漫
而TA，太特別了，我再等等

下飛機，被早早等候的阿松接到，自此行李再沒需要自己搭過手。一路回到酒店，等待辦理入住手續期間，老闆親自奉上香茗，熱情的歡迎我們“回家”！
酒店在和順古鎮的最高處，出行的陡坡對老年人不太友好，但酒店的服務碾壓這一切微不足道的困難，衹要有需要，古鎮內任意位置都能隨叫隨接，無比貼心。
出於對他們的信任，第二天，通過酒店預約了地熱公園的熱氣球和高黎貢山的親子徒步，靠譜的服務同樣讓我們如此踏實、放心並讚歎不已。
酒店房的温泉據稱是每天從熱海用車拉回的火山地熱温泉，確實聞起來一股硫磺味。入住期間泡湯也不限次數。
每天晚間，酒店還有圍爐烤茶、宵夜點心。品老闆娘親自準備的桃花釀，和同座的人們一起山南海北的聊天兒，看孩子們滿院子逗貓，這就是夢想中的慢生活！
再次點贊酒店的團隊，從老闆到員工，每一個人都發自內心的熱情、温暖，名副其實的賓至如歸！
雲南之旅的最高評價就在此間！
