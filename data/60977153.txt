msg:The whole family is very satisfied. It is very suitable for traveling with the elderly and babies. The housekeeper is very enthusiastic and gives timely feedback if there is any need. The service is very good. We stayed in Room 3, which has a beautiful view. It is also very convenient to eat and can be called. It's a pleasure to eat in the room. Anyway, I will come again.

msg:A very nice single-family villa. They contacted me several days in advance and told me some precautions. The car drove directly to the door. The elder sister was waiting early and introduced the room in detail. I was really surprised after entering. I enjoyed it so much. You can see the mountain view when you look up. There is a tram when you go out. There is no problem except for a little more than 5 people. If it is not too expensive, I really want to stay for a few more days. There are two separate bedrooms with bathrooms. There is no problem for a few more people. Even if I have children, my favorite is the small attic. The scenery of Jiuru Mountain is also very beautiful. There are barbecues and performances in the evening which are very exciting. There are too many people in May. You all have worked hard. Thank you for your service. I will go again if I have the opportunity.

msg:I really like this style. There is also a loft, which the kids love! The housekeeper service is also very good. The only regret is that I can't soak in the outdoor pool now. I will definitely go there again when the weather warms up in a few days.
