msg:To be honest.. after visiting several hotels in yunnan. This probably the worse one. Firstly, we arrived at hotel, no staff there to do check in/ help us with our luggage. There‚Äôs no one at all.. After awhile, A lady from restaurant/other department came and check in for us. And then‚Ä¶ no room keys no breakfast voucher/coffee voucher given (my mum went to redeem the free coffee but they said it require voucher). The only thing the staff text me was.. it‚Äôs time to check out. No service at all during the whole stay. And the price of this hotel is double triple of other great hotels. Mentioned this to our driver, he said his previous client told him the same thing as well. Regret choosing this hotel.

This hotel under the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in Lijiang
is the best choice for my trip
The room is very large üà∂about 100 square meters
I have to say that the designer üßëüé®'s aesthetics are really great ü•π
Every detail reveals the pursuit of quality
The panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows really make people feel bright
When you wake up in the morning, you can see the golden mountain in the sun üèîÔ∏è
Ps.üì∑It's really beyond the movie!!!

Away from the hustle and bustle of the city üåÜ, enjoy the scenery at the foot of the mountain
This is the poetry and distance I want
If I can ü•π, I should waste my days here

msg:The Wen'erli Hotel is the most surprising hotel in my Yunnan trip. There are thousands of homestays in Lijiang, but only "Wu'erli" has the greatest staying power. 270-degree panoramic view of snow-capped mountains, super large area, Korean-style cafe, buffs are stacked up directly.

Hygiene: spotless, new like banknotes just taken out of the bank!
Facilities: The bathroom and sink are actually electronic screen temperature control, audio, projector, whole house air conditioning, bathtub are all available.

Service: The hotel was designed by two young people of the same age, so it is very easy to communicate. The boss personally came out to help carry luggage and recommend local restaurants. Breakfast will also be delivered to the room, which is considerate, relaxed and pleasant.

Environment: The environment must be emphasized in particular. It is amazing. No matter what style you want to shoot, you can find a home here. The room faces the snow-capped mountains, and you can watch the sun shining on the golden mountain without any pain. The courtyard looks particularly quiet and comfortable in the evening, especially suitable for a few days in Lijiang.

In short, I will definitely come to this city again for this room.

Every corner of the hotel was very beautiful! Needless to say, the hygiene was very clean! You can also go for a coffee, and the view outside the room was even better, the countryside, the snow-capped mountains... You can stay in the hotel for a whole day, slowing down time, which was very healing!!! I heard that you can also see the sunrise on Jinshan Mountain, but unfortunately the weather was not good, I will come to see it next time! After dinner in the evening, we also took a walk to Baisha Ancient Town. The evening breeze was blowing, so comfortable~ Recommended!!!

I looked at many good homestays on the Internet, and finally stayed at the Wen'erli Homestay. I liked its design style and wide view at first sight. The service at the store was also in place. I contacted in advance and arranged our itinerary. The housekeeper was very attentive. I was even more amazed when I arrived at the store. Facing the snow-capped mountains, the floor-to-ceiling windows are open, and the night view is even better! The store provides afternoon tea, and drinking coffee and watching the sunset made my trip to Lijiang come to a successful end. Next time I come, I will choose Wen'erli, this romantic and distinctive homestay.

The room offers a view of the snow-capped mountains. Every day when I wake up, I feel better when I am bathed in the sunshine.

The owner of the B&B invites everyone to eat barbecue, roast suckling pig, hold bonfire dances, add some fun activities, and the coffee and drinks in the cafe are free, and there is afternoon tea, which adds some fun and memories to my leisure vacation.

Overall, if you are also looking for a place to relax and unwind, this will be the best choice.

I chose this homestay because I wanted to "see the golden mountain while lying down". First of all, the homestay service is very good, and they can pick you up to the nearby Baisha Ancient Town for free. I had some altitude sickness during the stay, but they also provided oxygen cylinders for free. There were children with us, and they gave them cakes to eat while we were waiting in the cafe. They also prepared an extra breakfast for the children, which was very thoughtful! The afternoon tea was also delicious~ The coffee was unlimited.
The room was very spacious and large. I could see the golden mountain when I opened the curtains early in the morning. In summary, it was a very satisfactory accommodation experience~

Thank you to the boss for upgrading me to a room with a snow mountain view for free. The room is super large with a 270-degree floor-to-ceiling window. It's really beautiful! The curtains and lights in the bathroom are all smart. The sound system in the room is very advanced. There is unlimited coffee refills. The cappuccino is delicious~ The breakfast and afternoon tea are also very rich. The cakes are amazing. The most worry-free thing is that there is an airport pick-up service, so you don't have to take a taxi yourself. Yesterday, I was also sent to Baisha Ancient Town for free. The car was clean and tidy. The service was really amazing. It's a pity that I have to catch a flight today and can't stay for two more days. The weather has been average recently. It's a pity that I didn't see the sunrise and golden mountain. I will definitely choose your hotel when I come to Lijiang again this year!

The room is very large, and you can see the owner's thoughtfulness in many places. For example, nail polishing tools are prepared, and the TV and projector can be used~
The service attitude of the lady who makes the coffee is also great.
The only drawback is that the sanitary environment needs to be improved (see Figure 6).
Thank you to the owner of the B&B for offering us a free room upgrade. I hope the business of the B&B will get better and better~

The staff of the homestay also provide good service. One day I felt uncomfortable, and they made noodles for me. I will stay here again next time I come to Lijiang.

The black corn is especially delicious.

msg:On this spring day, I visited WUERLI B&B at the foot of Yulong Snow Mountain in Baisha Ancient Town, Lijiang. It was like walking into a secret place isolated from the world.
üè° The B&B is located at the foot of the mountain. When you wake up in the morning and open the window, Yulong Snow Mountain stands quietly in front of you. The white snow peaks shimmer in the morning light, as if within reach. Standing on the balcony, taking a deep breath, the air is filled with the fresh breath of snow-capped mountains.
üå∏ WUERLI in spring is even more unique. Surrounded by lush trees and various wild flowers, it adds a touch of vitality to the land at the foot of the snow-capped mountains. In the afternoon, sitting in the yard of the B&B, bathing in the warm sunshine and feeling the spring breeze, it is really comfortable.
üçµ Here, time seems to slow down. You can leisurely taste a pot of good tea, read a good book, or chat with friends and enjoy this rare tranquility and relaxation.
üåü Overall, WUERLI B&B is a great place to relax and feel the nature. If you also want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and come here to enjoy the spring scenery at the foot of the snow-capped mountains, then don't miss it! #Lijiang Baisha Ancient Town #Yulong Snow Mountain #WUERLI B&B #Spring Snow Mountain #Natural Secret Realm
I hope this copy meets your requirements and I wish you a happy visit!

It is quiet, facing Yulong Snow Mountain, the coffee in the B&B cafe is very authentic, with a full variety, the overall design is grand, and the public area is large. The unit price feels high, but it is actually cost-effective: 1. The room area is large. 2. The afternoon tea is of high quality. 3. Free coffee. 4. The disposable items in the room are of good quality. 5. The quality of the souvenir tea is online. 6. The audio and other electronic equipment in the room are very fashionable, and the audio-visual effect is good. 7. The room has a good view. It is definitely worth buying for guests on vacation, parents and children, couples, etc.
