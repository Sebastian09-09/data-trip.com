msg:The key card is very nice, made of wood, and very creative. I took it with me. The room is quite large and has a balcony facing the stage door. It's super comfortable to sit outside when the sun is shining!
The hotel is about 2km away from Colorful Beach. You can go to the beach and play there. There are not many people.
I would like to give a thumbs up to Mr. Zhang at the front desk. He actively meets the needs of customers and is extremely caring. It makes me feel a little warm in a foreign land.

Especially the service is really good. I would like to thank the general manager sister of the hotel and sister Qin in the lobby. They are patient, have a good attitude, and respond quickly. If there is any problem, they will help solve it as soon as possible! The recommended places to visit are also very good, and other service staff are also great!

The room is very large and the terrace is also very nice. The most important thing I want to praise is the breakfast delivery service. Because the children slept late and couldn't make it to the restaurant for breakfast, the hotel also arranged for someone to deliver the food. There is a fishing boat pier next to the hotel, which is very a**ospheric for taking photos.

The service staff was worried that there would be too many people and the service would not be good, so they sent fruits and greeted us. They were worried that we would have nothing to do with the children, so they gave us the KTV box to sing for free. Although the check-in was a bit slow at the beginning, they kept up with the follow-up.

There is also a free beach (Waimen Beach) next to the hotel, and the children had a lot of fun. It’s not hot enough these days. If the weather is hot, you can also play in the hotel swimming pool, which is suitable for family outings. In addition, there is Taimen Pier next to the hotel, so it is also very convenient to go to nearby islands.

msg:The surrounding cities were extremely busy during the Spring Festival, so I happened to visit the Island Hotel and changed my route to the eastbound. Just after booking, the customer service contact added WeChat to facilitate inquiries about relevant information. It is very important to know the terminal and timetable in advance. If you miss a bus, you will have to wait for a long time. I originally wanted to catch the sunset, but unfortunately it was cloudy and I couldn’t take any photos. Fortunately, we waited for the perfect sunrise the next day, so the trip was well worth it. I would like to thank the hotel manager for helping to upgrade to the room type I wanted. The service was great! Although the hotel is on a small island, the facilities are new, the rooms are large, and the sanitation is good. If you have a chance, come back in the summer to experience the East China Sea style.

I looked around on Ctrip and chose this Alahai Hotel, which is on a small island with good privacy. I checked in at the front desk. The service staff was very enthusiastic. They left me their WeChat and sent us to the room. The moment I opened the door, I was amazed. The room was very large. In addition to the big bed, there was also a double bed. You can play on the slide and hammock in the room. There is also a terrace outside where you can drink tea and enjoy the sea view. The whole room is controlled by Xiaodu smart, which is very convenient. The hotel's breakfast is also delicious.

The hotel is well equipped, the scenery is beautiful, and the housekeeper is very enthusiastic~
The breakfast variety is a little small but delicious!
If you go to Liuheng Island, it is probably the only hotel worth staying in the island~
In addition, if you eat at a local seafood stall on Liuheng Island, it is strongly recommended to confirm the price before ordering, otherwise the checkout price may be beyond imagination😥 It is better to stay in the hotel for dinner
