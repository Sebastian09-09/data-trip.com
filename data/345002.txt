Only had experience with a few service stuff at the front desk, the service was media-core, you won‚Äôt feel the warmth of the service staff as compared to other big hotel chains that I stayed before. The hotel room is decent enough, and the bed is comfy.

But when my girlfriend arrived at the breakfast venue, the 2 girl staffs infront of the breakfast hall told her breakfast was not included in the booking. What the hell??? Do the staffs need a pair of glasses to check properly or was she discriminated because of her skin color??? I had to come back from an hours drive to confront them, wasting my precious time for their incompetence. Didn't expect such a **** service from Hilton, absolutely disgusting service. Rubbish hotel. Checkout took more than 30mins because they were understaffed. Don't book this hotel, Marriott or Park Hyatt offers better service and have better location.

I guess with the wide selections of takeouts on **, it‚Äôs really difficult for them to sell a RMB 150 plate of fried rice.
During our check out, the manager came over to ask for feedbacks, we expressed our dissatisfaction for him to tell us that we should understand it‚Äôs a very busy hotel haha, he then just casually without saying a word, walked away.

On top of that they were very accommodating with our 3 month old. they provided a crib for her to sleep in as well as an early check in and  late checkout time.

The location is very convent if needing to go to the consulates and is very close by Guangzhou East railway.

There are several locations nearby that are family friendly like the Guangzhou zoo that was abouty a 30 minute walk from the Hilton or a 10 minute drive.

We were told our room was still not ready, so we decided to leave our bags behind and returned to the hotel after dinner.  Another incident happened at night: I went to the concierge around 11 pm and just wanted to borrow a charging cable.  They was one staff at the counter and he was not serving any one.  I was next in line.  There were few other staff walked pass by.  All of them seemed didn't care to offer help.  I had to stand there for over 15 minutes until another staff finally approached me.  That was not good especially I wanted to get rest after a long day.  Having said that, the hotel is nice; the room was quite big and clean.  The air-condition worked very well; in fact, we had to switch it off because it got quite cool later at night. The buffet breakfast was good with a wide selection.  The service was good (sorry I forgot the name of the waitress who served my table).  When we checked out, it caught me by surprise that they gave a small gift as a birthday gift to me.  Will return to stay here again.

msg:The staff were excellent. There was no trouble  finding a staff member who spoke English.  I traveled with my gf and requested romantic decorations in the room. The staff member I.spoke to agreed immediately. They created swans using towels and left rose petals on the bed.

The gym was one of the better gyms I've been in at a hotel.  There's a rooftop pool as well , however there are older buildings right next to it.  Which brings me to some negatives regarding the location. Although the area is centralized,  the surrounding area is a bit old and the hotel shows its age.  
The breakfast buffet was pretty good, although for the price I would have expected more of a selection,  fitting of a 5 star holiday. 
Overall the service was excellent and the room was comfortable.

Check in alone took 30 minutes. The person doing the check in spoke so softly that I couldn't hear what she was saying. 
The sound proofing in the room was really bad. I could hear the elevators, people arguing in the room next to me and also the TV from another room.
The room in general was dirty and could use some TLC. There were cobwebs in my room.
The room service menu was ridiculously expensive 150rmb for a sandwich?!?
There were guests spitting in the pool and none of the staff said anything. There was also a really strong smell coming from the changing rooms that is very obvious to everyone outside.

msg:Stayed at the Hilton for two nights with my friends, from April 5-7 and it was a lovely experience. Staff were kind in helping me get settled. 

The pool is nice, but one thing I wish I knew before I booked the hotel was that around 11am the sun goes behind the hotel and there is no sun on the pool. I mainly came to use the pool, so keep this in mind if you want that too. You also need a cap to go into the pool, my hair was up but they wouldn‚Äôt let me in the pool. 

The breakfast was good, if you plan to go for breakfast, go before 9, as it was very busy when I went. When I was there, some food needed to be refilled, I love my cheeses and there were 3 left on a plate when I arrived. Eggs and beans were also cold.

A few minor things from my perspective, but it was a nice stay. My room was also very nice and I had a lovely tub. The hotel asks you to bring your own toothbrushes, pastes, etc. so it‚Äôs eco-friendly.

The chaise longues are in a weird spot, where the water from the pool keeps dripping and splashing. Other than that, the room was clean and the bed comfortable. The hotel is in a quieter area and offers decent prices. The picture attached is the pool at 9 am and the ‚Äúchilling area‚Äù is lower, on the other side of the pool.

The bed was king size and huge, the room was clean and had everything you needed. The TV was placed in an awkward position as the bed was a little too high for the tv height. But other than that our stay was awesome. Room service was quick and served good food!

msg:This is my first time stay at Tian He Hilton, I was WOW by the hotel staffs where  i meet them. they are very helpful and attentive.specially thanks to pretty lady Suki from front desk.She is a very polite and nice lady which makes stay become a memorable experience in Hilton. She kindly told me where I can shop and which restaurant  i can try. no matter what I ask she always replied with patience and big smile even with face mask. She clearly told me the hotel directions which makes me easy to find the restaurant's I feel really kind and at home. There is a handsome guy named Jason from Housekeeping are super professional, I meet him in the elevator and just ask him where I can get power bank due to my phone was almost out of battery, He immediately told me hotel had provide phone charger and will deliver to my room in 5 minutes later. I was shocked by his hospitality, he personally send the charger to me later on and a comb as well which I mentioned in our short conversations. He really focus on the customer needs. because of them I definitely will comeback next time and this wonderful stay experience I will share to all my friends who will travel to GZ. Tian He Hilton will be us first choice ever after.

msg:My last stay at the Hilton in Guangzhou was okay. It was not very English friendly (not a big deal for me just an observation) and the room smelled a bit like mildew but it was great for a one night stay. Also the location was a bit of a walk (30 minutes) from the center of Tianhe, which could be great if you‚Äôd like to avoid crowds.

Location: It's my first time in Guangzhou, so I'm not very familiar with it, but it's about 300 to 400 meters away from the subway station of Line 1 and Line 3, and there is a large business district. I personally think it is very convenient. It takes about 60 minutes to take a taxi to Shunde, and about 30 to 40 minutes to the airport
Service: Very thoughtful, whether checking in or checking out, it provides great convenience
There is a faint fragrance when entering the hotel, which makes people feel very comfortable. The restaurant is also very good. If you are too lazy to go out, you can solve it in the hotel!
Next time I will choose Hilton Tianhe

msg:I had to stay one night in Guangzhou. I hesitated for a long time and finally chose Hilton because of the good reviews and because I had a good impression of Hilton in Shenzhen.
After booking, ula took the initiative to call to ask about my needs and upgraded my king-size bed room. I had booked various executive suites before and was not treated so seriously. The service was quite good.
The location is very close to the East Station and you can walk here. Don't think about taking a taxi at the East Station during peak hoursüòÇ. Although it has been more than ten years, the things inside are not old. The surrounding buildings are also very old, and there is a courtyard next to it, so the location is quite good.

* Very typical American old money style, very distinctive. It is completely different from the newer Hilton Nanhai Hotel. Although the furniture is dark, it does not feel gloomy and helps sleep. I read a book on the desk and felt that the light of the desk lamp was not strong enough. I am used to the smart desk lamp at home. I personally hope that the desk lamp can be brighter.
* The bathroom is quite large, the water pressure of the shower is very high, and the shower room and every corner including the floor drain are very clean. It can be seen that this hotel is really attentive.
*The bedding is also very comfortable, which suits my habits very well, soft and supportive. Needless to say, the sheets are silky and the mattress is really great‚ò∫Ô∏è
It‚Äôs a pity that I couldn‚Äôt stay long because I was in a hurry to have breakfast. It is recommended not to go too early for breakfast, because the egg rolls I want to eat the most are not yet availableüòÇ The coffee and sushi are delicious~
I recommend everyone to stay here, and I‚Äôll end with a picture taken by my childhood friend 2 years ago.

(Off topic: In addition, I hope that all five-star hotels of various brands can use takeaway robotsü•π)

msg:I would like to urge the Hilton Group to pay attention to the manpower deployment issue of the Hilton Hotel in Guangzhou Tianhe.

This check-in experience is a bit hard to describe... Overall it is an ok hotel, but the check-in efficiency of the hotel is not high. When I checked in, I waited in line for fifteen minutes, and there was already a long queue of customers waiting to check-in at the front desk. Most of them were foreign guests, and they were all waiting. To a certain extent, they treated everyone equally, haha.

The strange thing about this hotel is that despite the stipulated check-in time of three o'clock, not even one of the elegant rooms has been packed out, and the staff is so short.
p.s. I would like to thank Sheng at the front desk for the upgrade offer, but this Hilton hotel is quite weird: the elegant room has an open view, a spacious area, and the overall style looks like an executive-level one, while the deluxe suite looks like an ordinary room type with an opening in the corner. , quite confusing room configuration. So I finally communicated with the front desk and changed to an elegant room.

Facilities: It is a hotel with a certain age and is well maintained in all aspects. However, it is a bug that the TV cannot project the screen.

Hygiene: The hygiene condition is quite good, and it can be seen that there is care in cleaning.

Service: The attitude is satisfactory. I would like to thank Sheng, Jackson, Cathy and the ladies at the executive lounge at the front desk. Although I encountered various problems when I checked in, when I changed to the elegant room, the original executive benefits were not added. As a result, the room card could not be swiped to access the executive lounge, but at least I felt a sincere service attitude.

My child ordered pasta and salad, and it felt like they were delivered to the room in ten minutes. This is really efficient. The floor attendant also brought the child's dental kit and slippers. The bed should be a large bed with a width of two meters. There is no need to worry about the child falling out of bed in the middle of the night. The bedding is also quite comfortable and the four pillows are both soft and hard. Breakfast was eaten in the lounge on the 24th floor. There were fewer varieties. The advantage was that the environment was not noisy and the location by the window was quite popular. The hotel is about 1 km from the nearest subway station and about 300 meters from the bus station. Online taxi hailing is very convenient. You wait in front of the lobby. When you go out and return to the hotel, there is a concierge to help open the door and pick up things. Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to Jolin for his very enthusiastic service. I wish you all the best in your work.

Secondly, let me talk about two areas for improvement. First: The lights of the air conditioner controller could not be turned off, and the consultation service center could not solve the problem. For people who are sensitive to light when sleeping, it was difficult for three nights. They tried to cover up some of the bright lights that were too dazzling. Second: mattresses and pillows are not friendly to us northerners, they are too soft. I didn't sleep well for almost three nights. On the fourth morning, I finally got angry and finally wanted to leave. Of course, the overall situation was still good. It would be best if the above two points could be improved.

Serve:
I checked in at 13:30 that day and was told that the room was being cleaned. It was understandable that we came early. So I took a room card holder with the room number written on it (without the room card) and went to the place mentioned at the front desk to store my luggage.

We played until 16:00 and came back to get our luggage and room card. Another guy told us that we hadn't checked in at all! What happened to the room card holder with the room number written on it? WeChat also deducted 800 deposits... The front desk looked at us holding the room card holder with a look of disbelief, asked us to hand over our IDs, and disappeared for ten full minutes with the IDs.

Ten minutes later, the guy came back and told us that our original room smelled of cigarette smoke and asked us to move to another room. Didn't they say that we didn't check in before? They also said that the room smelled of cigarette smoke... I doubt it was a lie. In fact, we were moved to a lower room on the seventh floor, and it was also a room at the end of the corridor.


health:
It‚Äôs really bad. You can look at the picture to see if this is really the hygiene of a five-star hotel? It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm demanding and need you to clean every corner. After all, I will be lazy in the details when I clean it myself. But you can see the place at a glance, so why don‚Äôt you plan to clean these places if you want to do some cosmetic work...?

I originally wanted to take a bath so that the environment would be hygienic, but I couldn't imagine how dirty the bathtub would be.

facility:
There is an unlicensed toilet and no electric toilet seat. It feels really cold to sit down on it in the middle of winter. The TV turns on quite quickly. The card slot for inserting the room card almost fell out, and it took several times to insert the card before the call came.

breakfast:
Breakfast is really chaotic. I wonder if there is a group purchase for breakfast, it is a noisy environment. There are some meals that you need to order from the chef. Don‚Äôt expect to be able to order them. You are simply competing to see who can jump in line and who is louder. Maybe going to the canteen to get food is more orderly than thisüòÖ

The taste is so-so and there aren't many choices. If I didn't live here, I would go to an ordinary teahouse to eat.

other:
Every time I take the elevator, the staff standing near the elevator are looking down at their phones and never say hello or guide.
We stayed at another five-star hotel the day before, and we were not asked to find our way there even once. They all greeted us warmly. After switching to this Hilton, my family even joked that we might have chosen a Home Inn with the Hilton brandüòÖ

The lobby was decorated in a Chinese New Year a**osphere, the service was very good, and the hotel facilities were okay. I would especially like to thank the manager Wang Sheng at the front desk who helped check in. He was very handsome and nice. , because we, 3 adults and 1 child, were only provided with 2 breakfasts per day (staying for 4 consecutive nights), so he sent us 2 separate breakfasts every day, and the whole check-in process was very efficient.

The staff member Nicole added WeChat in advance and kept in touch from before check-in to after check-in. If you talk to her about anything, it will be solved quickly. Other staff are also very good. The panoramic suite in the hotel we stayed in this time was great, large and clean. The food provided in the executive lounge, breakfast room, and Chinese restaurant are all delicious. The hotel also arranged a dragon dance performance on the morning of New Year's Day, which was very impressive. I will come back and stay here next time I come to Guangzhou.

After a busy day, I arrived at the hotel at 12:30 in the morning, already a little sleepy. Special thanks to the front desk lady Qing for checking in very efficiently and helping to upgrade the room. A warm start to the trip.

Although it has been open for more than ten years, the hotel's original equipment was very sophisticated and well maintained, so it does not feel old. The bedding was very comfortable, the curtains were thick, and I slept well. I woke up naturally in the morning and watched the hotel's lion dance performance, which was great. At noon, we had morning tea and lunch at the hotel. The dim sum is indeed authentic Cantonese cuisine, and the yellow croaker I ordered is also delicious. Really deserves praise.

A very good experience. I will choose this hotel next time I come to Guangzhou.

What I did better was that the hotel staff contacted me in advance before checking in. The food at Suixuan Chinese Restaurant is pretty good. The weak point is that some guests bought a package without breakfast. The front desk said that as long as they leave a positive review online, they can receive breakfast for free. This is very unfair to guests who purchased the original price with breakfast and treated them differently. Feel. It takes at least ten minutes to walk to the subway station, which is not particularly close.

msg:I'm speechless. It's the first time I write a negative review for a hotel, and it's a hotel I often stay at when I come to Guangzhou on business... I came in a hurry this time, and I booked the hotel myself before coming here. I arrived at the hotel at 9:50 pm on January 25. There were many people queuing in the lobby, and there was only one person at the front desk handling check-in, so there was no need to wait in line. After I queued for a few minutes, two or three more people queued up behind me. The hotel staff successively took the people in line behind me to the 24th floor to check in. This was acceptable. Maybe everyone in line started to go to the floor from that time on. I was just unlucky when it came to check-in. Then something strange happened. The hotel staff came around again and asked the person in front of me to go to the 24th floor to board the plane. They skipped me directly. I couldn't understand this at all. You have to say that you have checked in. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the message is that the people on the executive floor are calling to go upstairs. If you call blindly in order, can you jump me over? ? ?
A few minutes after queuing, the check-in counter had extra staff, so the process went a little faster. When I checked in, the double bed room I booked was probably gone. The front desk asked me if I could change to a twin room. I said it was OK but the price difference would be refunded to me. Then the front desk actually said, "Then I will upgrade you to a deluxe twin room" (the same price as a double room)... OK, OK, if I don't ask for a refund of the price difference, they will just default to changing me to a cheaper room... I've never seen this happen. When a hotel room type is no longer available, the first solution for guests is to reduce the room type without refunding the price difference...
The magic is not over yet. It was already 10:25 after I checked in and entered the room, which meant that it had been half an hour from queuing for check-in to entering the room. We were given a non-smoking room, and there was a huge smell of cigarette smoke when entering... In addition, there were many water stains and urine stains on the toilet. You can see it under the light. There were yellow body fluid stains on the edge of the bathtub. I didn't see it clearly and thought it was old. I had a dent, but when I wiped it I found it was a stain... I really vomited... I didn't want to change rooms, I just slept for one night anyway, so I wrote a bad review overnight and pasted it into the review after I check out tomorrow. Never come again...

First of all, special praise to Kino and Vivi at the lounge. Their service was incredible, always smiling and willing to go the extra mile. Whether they were tasting tea or answering my questions, they all showed professionalism and enthusiasm. I felt right at home spending time in the lounge and their service definitely added to the whole experience.
The facilities and environment of the hotel itself are also very satisfactory. Whether it's the comfortable rooms or the food and beverage service, I felt that every moment I spent here was luxurious and peaceful.
At the same time, I also want to mention an unexpected incident. In this incident, Huang Xiaoting at the front desk gave me very enthusiastic help. Not only did she resolve the issue quickly and efficiently, she also showed great patience and care throughout the entire process. Her professionalism and meticulousness made me feel that the guest-first service concept was reflected.
Overall, Tianhe Hilton Hotel gave me a warm and comfortable stay experience. Special thanks to Kino and Vivi for their service in the lounge, and Huang Xiaoting for her enthusiastic help in emergencies. I look forward to choosing Hilton Tianhe again in the future and continuing to enjoy such rare quality services.

Then I went over at about 4:00 and was told that the available rooms were still being cleaned and asked me to wait for about an hour.

I got the result that it had been cleaned, so I hurriedly went upstairs)

The photos taken from this height are also very beautiful (if the weather is good, the photos will look good). Service Not bad, and the food was...

In addition to free room upgrades and fruit plates, she explained everything very clearly. She also introduced the nearby food and entertainment in detail. She was very professional. The only thing I wanted was to It can improve the problem that the windows in the room cannot be opened at all. Because the weather is too cold, the hotel only has heating, but the windows cannot be opened. The room is very stuffy. At least like other hotel window designs, the windows can be opened slightly to allow air circulation. It wasn't too stuffy inside. Fortunately, the housekeeping staff immediately sent a fan. I commend their service. I will choose Tianhe Hilton next time.

The entire hotel is quite gorgeously decorated, and the warm-colored Chris**as tree lights create an a**osphere that matches the upcoming Chris**as a**osphere.
Facilities: The hotel facilities are complete and very new
Hygiene: The sanitation is clean and tidy. The cleaning lady is very kind and warm. She comes to the room every day to change the bath towels and make the beds to ensure a comfortable experience for the guests. Including having a late-night snack with friends in the room on the last night, I made a call to the front desk, and the service from the health aunt arrived quickly and was very efficient.
Service: Every waiter works hard to provide warm and considerate services to the guests. Thanks to the lady in the hotel, May, my room was upgraded from an ordinary king bed room to a deluxe king bed room on a higher floor.

msg:The experience of staying at the Hilton Hotel in Guangzhou is quite satisfactory. First of all, the hotel is located on a high floor, overlooking the entire city of Guangzhou. The floor-to-ceiling glass windows allow me to enjoy the charming city scenery, which is intoxicating. Special thanks to Miss Candy for her warm service. She not only upgraded me to a deluxe room for free, but also gave me a carefully prepared welcome fruit, which added a lot to the entire stay experience.

The cleanliness of the deluxe rooms was also impressive, giving me a sense of the hotel's high standards of hygiene. However, it is also worth mentioning that the hotel's hardware facilities are slightly outdated, and the wires of lights and telephones are damaged. Although the staff repaired them with black tape, they still appear to be slightly inadequate. It is expected that the hotel can update the hardware maintenance in a more timely manner to ensure that every guest can enjoy a perfect stay experience.

Overall, the Hilton hotel stands out for its unique location, beautiful city views, and attentive service. Although there are some minor flaws in the hardware facilities, this does not obscure its excellent performance in terms of service and comfort. Thanks to Miss Candy for her meticulous care, which made my time in Guangzhou more enjoyable and unforgettable.

msg:In the past when I went to Guangzhou on business, I would always hesitate between Four Seasons and Hilton. I would almost always stay at both. As a loyal fan of Hilton hotels, I checked that I have stayed at Hilton hotels in at least 11 cities this year. This time, due to the confusing operation of the Guangzhou Hilton, I will never stay here again. After a day of meetings, I returned to the hotel room in the evening as shown in the picture. When I left in the morning, I had replaced the do not disturb indicator light and the sign outside the door. I turned on the phone after returning to the room. I called the front desk 4 times to tidy up the room, clean up the trash, and get some toiletries. It took 50 minutes to deliver them. I asked the waiter who brought them, what is your name? Can you take out the trash for me? The waiter rushed directly to me, grabbed his work badge and said my name is XXX, you can complain to me, then turned around and left. Later, he called the front desk again. The manager on duty was still very friendly and said it was due to a work error and he was really sorry. I can help you clean it up immediately, especially this room attendant, who felt extremely emotionally unstable and caused me great psychological pressure. Therefore, I will never stay at the Guangzhou Tianhe Hilton again!

msg:The Guangzhou Tianhe Hilton five-star hotel does not have professional service staff at all. At least, they do not have the etiquette and communication skills to interact and communicate well with customers. No real respect!
After I confirmed that the reservation on Ctrip was successful and paid the full amount of the room, I called the hotel front desk on the way to confirm my arrival at 2 a.m., and then called the front desk again to make a note to reserve a room on the same floor. This meant that after three calls, a room was available. I just set out, but when I arrived at the hotel to check in in the early morning, I was told that all the rooms were sold out. The attitude was extremely bad and all problems were the responsibility of the consumer. The manager on duty told me to cancel directly or arrange a hotel with him, and said that Hilton had already paid for me in another hotel, so Hilton would use the money I paid for the five-star hotel to book a hotel that was not a five-star hotel for me. That was it. The plan is yours to choose! I waited until 3:30 in the morning at 2 in the morning and the problem was still not solved. Finally, with Ctrip's communication, I checked into another "five-star" hotel in Yuexiu District as mentioned by the manager on duty. The problem was solved by using my five-star payment. Class hotel prices for a shabby hotel. I was exhausted until four o'clock in the morning, and the way I dealt with it seriously damaged my rights and interests. According to Item 10 of Article 5 of the "Measures for Penalties for Infringement of Consumer Rights and Interests" formulated by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce: defrauding consumers of prices or fees without providing or failing to provide them. Providing goods or services as agreed is an act of fraud. Article 55 of the "Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law" stipulates: If an operator commits fraud in providing goods or services, he shall increase the losses suffered by the consumer at the request of the consumer, and the amount of the increased compensation shall be the purchase price of the consumer or the amount of the service received. Triple the fee and penalize the hotel.
It is hoped that the Tianhe Hilton five-star hotel will follow my country's corresponding rules and regulations and effectively protect the rights and interests of consumers in accordance with the law.

Overall, the hotel facilities are a bit old, especially the cabinets, which are creaky. The floor tiles were also cracked. The washbasin is also relatively short. The elevator is also very old. The elevator door can be seen shaking while the elevator is running. But there are robots delivering goods to your door, which is very convenient. The socket corresponding to the Xiaomi hair dryer in the toilet is also a little loose, and it stops working when blowing hair.
Breakfast should have more varieties. Luncheon meat feels very cheap. There is only one kind of sushi, and it doesn‚Äôt look very tasty. There are no dessert cakes either. Because the breakfast on the second floor was full, we were recommended to eat in the administrative area on the 24th floor. However, the table in the executive area is a bit small, and the height of the sofa and table do not match well.
In short, many places need to be replaced and improved.

msg:Today at the Canton Fair, I had a very bad attitude when I went to renew my stay. I was already in line, but a manager rushed me out to line up again in order to receive foreign guests. I left immediately thinking that they would call me to renew my stay, but then no one contacted me. At 6:30, they told me that half the day's room fee would be deducted directly. I thought it would be better if I just phoned to apply. , and then they said they would double the price today. Then why didn't you say it earlier? Let me know when the price increases. The words are hard to hear. Does it mean that Hilton is a foreign brand and only accepts foreigners? Aren‚Äôt we Chinese human beings?

msg:An experience that subverts cognition. I didn‚Äôt expect Hilton‚Äôs service to be so bad now! ! First of all, not long after I checked in, a cleaning lady knocked on the door and opened the door directly into the room. I was scared to death! When asked what she was doing, she said she wanted hot water? ! I called the front desk to complain, and the next day I got a call to apologize!

We ate at the buffet on the second floor at noon on the first day. I asked about the cost in detail when I walked in. The receptionist said there was a discount for hotel guests. Since it was almost 2:00 pm, the four of us went straight in to eat. I didn‚Äôt even see the bill after the meal, so I put it directly on the room account. At noon on the third day, four people ordered food at the coffee bar in the lobby on the first floor. One of the pasta dishes was not served for more than half an hour. In the end, everyone else finished their meal and waited, which got boring. Ice cream, but the ice cream didn‚Äôt come. My companion joked that he had gone out to buy ice cream.

On the morning of the fourth day, I checked out and asked the front desk for a consumption list, but they only provided a total cost. After adding WeChat, the total cost was still sent. I repeatedly asked for a list until it was sent in the afternoon of the same day, and found that there was no lunch for the next day. There was a discount, so I pointed out that the charge was incorrect and asked them to check it! At this time, I realized that the hotel's signature orders did not have detailed lists, so there was no way to check them! For a 5-star hotel, this is totally inappropriate!

Then the most outrageous thing happened, before I received the detailed list of consumption and verified the discount. The hotel will automatically deduct the payment! I asked the front desk lady on WeChat, how can you do this? Without final verification and confirmation of the order and fees, you deducted the money and the transaction was over? ! The front desk lady just asked: Do you need an invoice?

A very bad hotel experience. As a five-star hotel, Hilton's customer experience and service are really bad!

The room was quite clean, but overall it was an old hotel. The bathroom door made a loud noise, and the water pipes also made a loud noise when running water. The hotel is in a good location, very close to Guangzhou East Railway Station. Parking at the hotel is very convenient. Parking is free for guests who drive there. The hotel concierge was also great and offered to help with luggage many times. When I checked out, the process was very fast, but the receptionist at the front desk was probably in a bad mood early in the morning. She was embarrassed the whole time and didn't look at me. She asked me to go to the concierge to report my car number. I came back to ask her after I finished it. , check-out is all done, right? Without raising her eyes, she squeezed out the word "yes". Then I left. I was the only one checking out at that time, and the entire front desk was not busy. The receptionist looked resentful and asked the leader to pay more attention to this employee, otherwise the guests would have to look at her face, and we were quite innocent. A smile and a goodbye may be important. Next time I go to Guangzhou, I will try other hotels and make comparisons.

msg:This is my second time staying at the Tianhe Hilton Hotel. The room type I stayed in last time was an elegant suite, which felt very good. This time I booked an ordinary double bed room, and the experience was much worse than when I was in Shenzhen. The services and facilities at the Hilton are far different. I was initially assigned a north-facing room. The view and facilities could be described as terrible. The facilities were old and there was no bathtub. The whole room was small, broken and dirty. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was at the level of a Hilton hotel, as shown in Figure p1p2. , after I couldn't accept it, I reported to the front desk and asked to change rooms. I changed to a south-facing room, and the check-in experience was barely five stars. The south-facing room is larger, has a good view, and has a bathtub, which is quite comfortable, but there are still problems with the facilities. There is a problem with the drainage system of the bathtub. Every time the water is drained, it leaks all over the floor. It is easy to slip. The hair dryer in the room is also broken, causing my hair to dry naturally. It is very annoying. I may go there next time I come to Guangzhou. Choose another hotel.

msg:The hotel is close to Guangzhou East Railway Station, about 300 meters away in a straight line. There is an obvious depression around the hotel.

When I arrived at the hotel to check in, I happened to meet two Chinese people, holding their passports and speaking English, and checked in.

There was a male and a female waiter at the front desk. They took a long time to complete the process, and there were several people waiting in line behind them, but they were still indifferent.

It didn't show up. There were a lot of guests checking in. Please increase the number of front desk handlers or use other methods to coordinate.

The front desk clerk also chatted with two people about various things.

Finally, the two men didn't know how to leave the front desk, and they didn't want to leave.

When I was having breakfast at the hotel, I saw other guests still eating. A waiter ran to pick up the guests‚Äô plates and asked, do you still need them?

No matter what your mentality is, it is impolite to go and take away the guest's plate while the guest is eating.

Hotel breakfast, variety, food taste, very average

I have stayed at Hilton hotels in Kunming, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Guiyang, and I obviously feel that the service and level are worse than other five-star hotels.

The core of hotel services is health, front desk, catering,

The hardware facilities of a five-star hotel are not too bad, unless the hotel is old and lacks maintenance.

The PK of hotels is service. Once the service cannot keep up, the occupancy rate and all aspects will be reduced.

My service score is low because I don't agree with the service at the front desk. If it happens to me once, countless customers will encounter this situation.

If there are too many people who have bad check-in experience, it will be very difficult for the hotel to operate well.

I hope to give hotels a reminder that to value service is to value efficiency.

First of all, I would like to express my appreciation to a front desk clerk who is polite, courteous, attentive and has a good appearance! ÔøºThe room has the layout of a traditional five-star hotel and is just the right size. I use a brand of body products that I really like. Then I would like to praise the cleaning lady on the 14th floor where I stayed. She was polite and very enthusiastic. The 10-cent breakfast is rich and can be purchased on-site for only $98. The location is very good, right between Tianhe city center and Guangzhou East Railway Station! In fact, the defense cost is only about $1,000! One more thing, I forgot to take away the mouse when I was eating breakfast. The restaurant took good care of it at the same time! In short, I recommend it to everyone! ÔøºÔøº

Regarding after-sales issues, I waited for five days and made three phone calls, but there was no reply. What's the use of only using polite words and not caring about customers' business?

msg:The hotel is located in the center of Tianhe. The location is very good, but the equipment and services are not worthy of the 5-star positioning. The equipment should be from the last century, and it is too old. The service is really hard to describe. I booked through Ctrip and checked my ID card for a long time. They said I had no booking information. I asked if my name was misspelled and pronounced "Jue". Sure enough, I found it. There was no apology. I forgot to remind me that the name on my ID card was "Jue". There is Pinyin, but if you put a little thought into it, you will not ask questions to the guests, and it is very disrespectful. You also did not ask if you need a toiletry bag. It was only when you fell asleep and brushed your teeth in the middle of the night that you discovered that Beijing had a ban on plastic bags. After such an experience, do you have the nerve to say that you are a Hilton? ? ?

1. We started queuing up to check in at two o'clock, and it took a full thirty minutes to completeüòÆüí®
2. They said the room had not been cleaned yet, and they promised that they would call me at 3 o'clock to pick up the room card. However, there was no call at 3:45, so I was in a hurry and had to queue up again at the front desk. They would give it to me as soon as I asked. Got the room card ü§•
3. There is no welcome fruit or coffee machine in the room.
4. I found out that two wine glasses were missing in the evening. I was worried that I would be wronged and my deposit would be deductedüò∞
5. The air conditioner makes a loud mechanical sound every once in a whileüò©
6. The pillow was too thick, which made my girlfriend and I sleep very uncomfortableüòµüí´. I only found out in the morning that there were 4 types of pillows to choose from. Why didn‚Äôt the front desk tell them when I checked inü§î
7. Go to the front desk to purchase the buffet breakfast in the morning. If you ask the staff, please come one day in advance! Oh my God! Obviously the front desk suggested when I checked in that I can decide whether I want breakfast tomorrow morningüò°
8. Finally bought the breakfast buffet. My girlfriend and I didn‚Äôt eat any food that was deliciousü•∫. The noodles were overcooked and the wontons were not yet cookedü§¨. The 98 yuan for a breakfast is half price. If I had known it was free, I wouldn‚Äôt eat it!
9. I got a room upgrade for free, but the room didn‚Äôt surprise me at allüòë

This time the experience is very good, the service is in place, May‚Äôs smile is very sweet, and the other staff are very good, so I cannot introduce them in detail. May be we are traveling with 2 small children and were upgraded to a deluxe room which was spacious and clean. There are many choices for breakfast, the taste is good, and the children are very happy. We did not choose the wrong hotel, and we will stay at Hilton Tianhe again next time we come to play.

msg:The worst Hilton experience ever came from the Tianhe Hilton. Except for the front desk staff and the manager on duty, who knew nothing about the Hilton Honors membership system, they had no sense of service to guests traveling alone with children. On the night of February 16th, the lady at the front desk wearing a white overalls and a ponytail sneered at my four-year-old‚Äôs question, which I still can‚Äôt let go of.
 
As a Hilton Diamond member who is about to enter his sixth year, I have stayed at many Hiltons at home and abroad, from Waldorf Astoria to Hampton Inn. This is the first time I have been treated with such indifference. I am shocked but also full of disappoin**ent.

Hilton Honors members or guests who want better service are recommended to consider DoubleTree or other hotels with the same price. Tianhe Hilton is not suitable for families and guests, nor is it suitable for guests who have high service requirements. At the same time, we sincerely recommend that hotels strengthen internal training to improve employees' service awareness and personal qualities.

msg:The furnishings of the hotel are relatively old. When I checked in at 2 pm, I was told that the reserved room had not been packed out yet. The packed room was in the north. If I needed to increase the price, I could check in immediately. I had no choice but to increase the price. Later I found out that the front desk and several groups of guests were saying the same thing. It feels like it should be a hotel sales routine. The surrounding environment of the hotel is relatively average, the rooms are small, and the bathroom floor is not very clean. In addition, after checking in, I found that the hand sanitizer was empty. It really felt average and felt a bit like a guest house.

2. When ordering takeout, they will not be sent upstairs. If there is a robot, it will not be delivered by robot. I remember that the Hampton by Hilton where I stayed before would have takeout delivered upstairs.
3. When you have breakfast in the executive lounge, there are not many people. The waiters wander around and refuse to take away the empty plates on your table.
4. I had a buffet dinner at the hotel on Valentine's Day. There were few varieties and the ingredients were not good. It was a big mistake.
The aunt who cleans the executive floor and the front desk staff are still very good.

Facilities: It has everything you need. There is nothing to be picky about. The swimming pool and restaurant are very exquisite. Unfortunately, I am too tired to have time to play at night.

Environment: It is not too far away from various attractions and transportation facilities, which is quite convenient

Service: The service staff is very warm and polite. When we first checked in at the hotel, a lady named May came over to ask our needs enthusiastically, and gave guidance and help. I am very grateful~
During the check-in period, the waiter thoughtfully presented fruit. Although it is not an expensive thing, it is still very healing for us who are tired and thirsty after a day of playing.

However, it would be perfect if the check-in speed at the front desk of the hotel could be a little faster...
In short, this hotel is very suitable as a transit point for summer travel. It is very quiet and you can get a good rest at night. It is very suitable for people who want to go to the Guangzhou Tower the next day or leave to take a plane

There are many people waiting for the room at the front desk. Although it took time to wait for the room, the front desk who received our family was very considerate and helped me and my family to arrange a room on the same floor. I feel that they are very busy. He received guests with a smile and was very patient and responsible. Thank you Elvis Xiaozhu for his service. The room is clean and tidy, and the service is considerate and warm. When I was received, I felt that I was valued by the front desk. I believe that you are getting better and better.

When it was our turn to report to the staff, they pretended not to hear and ignored you. I chose to celebrate here for the anniversary, so I called the hotel in advance to ask for the decoration, but when I checked in, it said that the room was full and it was too late to decorate, and we had to go out to help with the decoration. What's the point of such a surprise? ? ? What is the meaning of the arrangement? ok. fine. When I came back after eating, I found out that this thing was arranged, seriously? ? ? ? I was really laughed at, as if it was childish children's manual work that didn't cost 5 minutes. The room facilities are also very old, as you can see from the *****ped and stained washbox. In the future, I will never choose or recommend the Hilton brand to people around me when I travel.

When we arrived in the early morning, she directly said that I was upgraded to a deluxe double room for free. Once I entered the room, I was shocked. It was a very small room and it was the most corner on the 7th floor. I guess the room was pushed to me because no one else could bear it. Later, I went downstairs to the front desk to ask her to change rooms. Before I even asked her, she knew my intention. It directly proved my guess. Let‚Äôs talk about the soundproofing of the room. Let's put it this way: I can hear the coughing next door clearly, and the noise of talking and opening and closing the door. In short, the two nights I stayed there were almost sleepless nights, and the sanitation was so messed up. Let me directly upload the picture. The child scratched all night and found the bed sheet in the morning. There are still dirty stains on it. In short, everyone must be cautious before choosing a hotel!

1. The worst thing is of course the service. From the person who checked in to the person who stood in the lobby, everyone seemed to be working part-time. When I checked in after 5 pm, I was told that only one of the two rooms was available. It was simply unbelievable. When I was out between 6 and 9 pm, there was no call. I informed the room whether it was cleaned well. I went to the front desk to get the room card for another room after 9 o'clock. They actually gave me the duplicate room card for 2 rooms. I went back and reported it to the male waiter at the middle counter. He didn't take it seriously. Haha, I'm sorry. It's amazing that the service provided by the robot is better than that of this store.
2. I asked for a pair of scissors to be delivered to me at 10 o'clock, but it was not delivered at 11:30 and I kept saying that I was busy...
3. The hotel hardware is also very poor and old. There are only two bottles of mineral water, which is not hygienic. The charger is only on one side.
4. Breakfast was mediocre. The location is also average.
Overall, this is a hotel that is highly not recommended. I stayed at Atour two days ago and was instantly beaten by Atour. None of it is a strong point. I highly recommend it! ! ! A bad impression of this hotel will directly affect the city and its power.

I couldn't follow this advice. I got up early the next morning and as soon as I left the room There was a sister at the door who asked me if I was checking out and wanted to help me with the room immediately. It was 8 o'clock in the morning. I wanted to go downstairs and have breakfast. I checked out at 12 o'clock. It seemed like I was chasing away guests. The location was far away. It's quite a distance from Zhoudong Station. I will never stay in this hotel again next time!

msg:I recently stayed at a hotel and wanted to share my experience and review. Overall, my stay experience was good, but there are still some minor issues.

The first is the Check-in process, I think they can improve it. Although the waiters are very polite, the whole procedure takes a little longer. Maybe they could do more training to be more efficient and make the check-in process smoother.

In addition, I want to mention that because I booked the room through the Trip platform, the hotel cannot provide an invoice. This can be a minor annoyance for business travellers, I hope they fix this and provide better service to their guests.

The breakfast is one of the things I was most impressed with in the hotel. They offer a great selection and it tastes good too. Both western and Chinese breakfasts are delicious. I believe it will be a good experience for travelers who like to enjoy food.

The only little problem is that the hotel is located near the exhibition hall, so there will be more tourists during the exhibition period. Although this is not the fault of the hotel itself, it may cause some inconvenience to everyone's check-in experience. However, I still think the hotel room is comfortable, especially the beautiful bathtub, which allows you to enjoy a beautiful bubble bath.

Overall, I have a good impression of this hotel. I hope they can improve the check-in process and work on providing better service to guests. If you are looking for a comfortable hotel, this is an option to consider.

msg:Booked two rooms and had a very bad experience. I originally planned to stay for two nights, but after staying for less than 3 hours, I decided to cancel the 3 rooms for tomorrow night and change hotels. I originally booked a twin room, but when I arrived at the store, I was told that there were only rooms in the smoking area. Since the child's respiratory tract is sensitive, the front desk helped me change to a double room in the non-smoking area and promised to help me with an extra bed for free. After entering the room, there is a big bed room where the suitcase cannot be spread out. The room is too small to add a bed, so I have no choice but to change rooms with my family. The room was slightly larger after the change, but the power was cut off after the water was boiled. I called the engineer to go upstairs to check the problem and waited for a few minutes. During the period, the cleaning lady asked us if we had boiled the water? ! Power failure trip caused by boiling water? There is nothing to say about the safe use of electricity in this hotel, which makes people helpless. At the beginning of the project, we couldn't find the reason for the power outage. During the period, we went to the manager on duty, and it took half an hour to get on the phone with the manager on duty. From helplessness to anger. won't come again, no next time

It can be seen that the hotel's management level is high, and the training is in place, which is worthy of praiseüëç At the same time, there are groups of other companies holding conferences and activities, so there are many guests, and the store also provides a shuttle bus to the Canton Fair.
- I often stay in different types of mid-to-high-end hotels on business trips and trips, and the experience is quite rich. This time I went to Guangzhou because I was not familiar with the road, this is already the second hotel for this trip, and I only stayed for two nights for a short time. Since I haven't stayed in this Hilton hotel, I booked a basic double bed room to try, so I won't be picky like some negative reviews.
- On the first day I arrived in the evening and went out for a stroll. Because I was not familiar with the road, I went in the wrong direction (to the gate of the competitive sports center) and saw a busy main road. Later, I took a taxi to the subway station. The next day I found out that there is a shopping mall linked to Shenzhen East Railway Station after walking 5-10 minutes to the left after leaving the hotel, which is very convenient. Will patronize again.

On the first day I came, because I arrived in Guangzhou early, the lady at the front desk also took the initiative to help me check in early. In the afternoon, there was a small problem with the equipment in the room. The maintenance personnel came quickly, and then contacted Cliff, the manager on duty that day, to help me change the room. I changed to a room with a better orientation and a bigger room. I gave my sister and I breakfast for two days as a gift. The service attitude of him and another manager, Candy, is super good, and the environment of the hotel is also very good, which made me like Guangzhou a little more~ If you don't pursue top-level hotels, you can consider this one~

We arrived at the hotel around 12 o'clock in the morning. It was very close to the East Railway Station and just a short walk away.
The hotel checked us in immediately, and we quickly went to room 30 on the 12th floor to rest. The hotel is very clean. The staff in the lobby are very friendly and make you feel at home. The rooms are also very nice with separate dry and wet rooms.
There are many snack bars around, and eating is very convenient and cheap. At night, the hotel is brightly lit and dazzling, and the scenery is unique.
Especially Andy Wei, a staff member of your hotel, also helped us call the hospital. We are really grateful for providing a lot of convenience to the elderly.

The only shortcoming is that the quilt in the hotel is too thick and it is a bit hot at night. I hope there can be a blanket to give the guests a choice, that would be perfect.

When I entered the room, there was a lot of garbage in the bathroom. I called the service hotline and asked for help to clean it up. They promised to help. However, when I came back in the evening, I found that it had not been cleaned at all. The fruit they were given as compensation was still bad.

The security guard did not allow the delivery boy to enter the lobby, and there were few take-out counters at the door. The delivery boy waited for more than 20 minutes, and made 4 or 5 calls to ask the concierge to go out and take two steps to get it. In the end, he did not help, and then There is no follow-up text. I communicated with the lobby manager the next day, and he shied away from responsibility and said it was a problem with the takeout platform. I was so unfavorable! In a hotel that costs 1,000 yuan, you can‚Äôt even help with takeout. It‚Äôs ridiculous!

There was no one to pick up the luggage at the door. The luggage needs to be carried into the room by yourself. Is this a five-star hotel?

There are people calling you and adding you on social media to keep urging you to give good reviews. . It was said that it was a free room upgrade, but the room was old and old, and the toilet was not automatic, but an old-fashioned toilet. The shower in the bathroom made a high-pitched chirping sound when it was turned on. I washed it for ten minutes and screamed for ten minutes. In the end, I couldn't wash it anymore. Got it! My ears are ringing even after washing! There was a queue at the front desk and it took ten minutes just to check in. I originally thought I'd forget it and just decide on this hotel next time. But the hotel staff kept asking me if I could give you a five-star rating. If your service reaches five stars, would I not give it a five-star rating?

But staff training is average.
The check-in efficiency is extremely low, with an average of more than ten minutes per guest
As a result, there were not many guests waiting to check in, but the extremely low efficiency led to a long queue behind, and even when there were many waiting guests, there was still a counter with half of the people who checked in and disappeared. The check-in staff at the front desk who are checking in are also very unskilled and often disappear.

msg:After the epidemic, I came to Guangzhou for the Spring Festival, and chose Hilton among the thousand-yuan hotels. No nonsense, let me complain first: The hotel has been open for a long time, and the facilities are a bit outdated, but fortunately, it does not affect the use; the types of buffet breakfast are quite satisfactory, the booth layout can be more reasonable, and some signs can be added to guide guests; the restaurant uses the slippery hotel slippers as an excuse Refusing hotel guests to wear slippers is certainly correct from the perspective of the safety of the guests, but it seems more positive to upgrade the slippers to non-slip ones. After all, the real safety hazard is not the slippers but the slippery floor of the hotel. During the Spring Festival, the guests were full. There were some small problems about the room type when checking in, but they were quickly resolved with the intervention of Ctrip. The communication between different depar**ents of the hotel needs to be strengthened. Praise the hotel's executives. During the Spring Festival, the general manager and executive chef are understaffed to serve customers in the cafeteria. This attitude is admirable. Finally, I would like to thank the hotel for allowing our family to have a happy Spring Festival. The hotel decoration is full of New Year's flavor, the New Year's Eve dinner in the Chinese restaurant is warm and lively, and the lion dance on the first day of the new year is warm and grand. I hope we can meet again in the future.

After checking out, I was charged 100 yuan. I called the front desk and asked why the money was deducted. They said that I used a box of condoms. Is this Pengci?

The hotel's service is also relatively good, and if there is anything missing, it will be delivered quickly. What about breakfast? Things can be considered complete. Overall 95 points. Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will choose it again.

The pillows and sheets were stained. The manager came up to deal with it. It was a head of the housekeeping depar**ent who came. Apart from apologizing and changing the room, there was no remedy, not even a polite piece of fruit. This management and service level are really sorry for the five-star hotel. Overall, it is not good satisfy.

The front desk promised that it would take 1 and a half hours and up to 2 hours to scan out the room, but it took 2 hours! Not only was he not asked to come out, but the front desk said angrily: "Twin-bed rooms in our hotel are in short supply!" Haha! Are these two things related?
Forget it if the hardware is not good! Even the basic slippers have a very thin base and will become slippery if water sticks to them!

msg:I chose this hotel during the Canton Fair purely by chance, because this hotel is close to the East Railway Station. If you go to the East Railway Station, you can walk there in about seven or eight minutes. It is quite convenient to stay in this hotel. The staff at the front desk were small My sister Yingzi came to introduce me to the hotel‚Äôs facilities and equipment. There is a gymnasium and a laundry room on the fourth floor. Although he was in the Canton Fair, the hotel had a lot of people and it was very lively, but the hotel‚Äôs overall income and facilities are still It's pretty good, for example, like the room, its equipment is quite complete and clean. Clean and tidy, everything that should be in the room, facial cleanser, gel water, shower gel, shampoo, scale, umbrella, and smart Xiaodu can control some birthday equipment in the room, I think it is quite intelligent and simple It‚Äôs a style that looks pretty good on the whole, er, even this price may be relatively high, of course it‚Äôs understandable, after all, it‚Äôs during the Canton Fair. Then this hotel is also quite introverted, and then it provides afternoon tea and supper, and then it is free, the type of afternoon tea is, uh, I don‚Äôt know, because I used to check in at a relatively late time Yes, but the young lady told me that I could have a free supper, and then she offered to pack it for me because of the rush of the next day's schedule. Then it is very considerate, the room facilities and equipment are very complete, and there are fruits in the room at night, the whole is very considerate, and like the restaurant on the first floor, the overall decoration style is quite comfortable, such as Speaking of his supper, although I didn‚Äôt go there to eat, I heard from the lady that the restaurant has a big screen playing music, and the variety of dinner is relatively small, but it is also to meet the needs of the guests if they are hungry at night. Personally, I think the overall is very good. The gym and laundry room on the fourth floor are also quite good. Although the gym on the fourth floor is not very big, it has some basic facilities and equipment, such as treadmills, large bath towels, mineral water, etc. The thing is to meet a basic need for fitness. I think a business-oriented hotel in this area has done a good job, and there are also mineral water placed in their corridors, whether it is you Sometimes the waiting time for the elevator is too long and you can get it. Anyway, it‚Äôs free. Then, the staff in the lobby are really good at serving. The young lady and the young brother at the front desk are very beautiful and handsome . , When I left the store today, it was probably because I left too early. His breakfast and dining time started at 7:00 in the morning, so I had to leave at 7:00, so I didn‚Äôt have time to eat. His staff, Ms. Yingzi, was very caring to help me prepare a breakfast in advance. When I left the store, I could just pick it up at the front desk. The invoices were also prepared for me in advance, which was very convenient. Reliable, I personally think that although I only stayed in this hotel for one night by accident, I only stayed for one night, but the overall feeling is very good, very nice. I hope that next time I have the opportunity to experience the afternoon tea, dinner, and breakfast introduced by Ms. Yingzi. The trip was too hasty this time, and I didn‚Äôt fully appreciate the charm of this hotel. I hope that I will come again if I have the opportunity next time. Come and experience it for yourself. Many thanks to the staff for helping me. Will definitely come again next time I have a chance.

It takes less than 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to Dongfang Baotai. It is a very large shopping mall, where there are supermarkets, restaurants and various shops.
Finally the hotel room was very spacious and clean. When checking in, the front desk was very attentive and provided my daughter with a toothbrush for children.

The check-in procedure is super slow, many people are waiting and clamoring, and the front desk business capacity is seriously insufficient. The air conditioner is broken and has not been cooling. I invited maintenance personnel to the room for maintenance, but to no avail. In this hot summer, the indoor temperature is still 26 or 27 degrees. At 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, I put on my pajamas and changed me to the guest room on the 21st floor. During the process, I waited for the elevator in the elevator room for about two minutes, and I was speechless. Originally, I stayed for two consecutive days, and I paid all the fees. After coordinating with Ctrip, I canceled it. I transferred to the elegant hotel at noon the next day, which was not a first-class experience at all. I hope that the hotel can sum up the lessons well, strive to be refined, and make rectifications, which is worthy of the three words Hilton.

msg:Shocked, there are four people in the lobby of the well-known Hilton Hotel. There are oil and salt in the front desk and they will not enter the small reception desk. Zhonglai is arrogant and fake manager, and then he goes out and neglects his duties and two security guards. At 3:30 in the middle of the night, four women, three adults, did not have the right to bring a college entrance examination graduate who was three months short of adulthood into the room, and the girl stayed in the room for the afternoon without anyone caring, but was faked in the middle of the night. The manager kicked him out of the hotel lobby and let him go home alone. In the end, we expressed a strong resistance, believing that the rules were too rigid, and the personnel could not be flexible, the methods were very weak, and the ideas were very stubborn. The four were all women and friends. One of the adult women had her birthday on the same day. Under such a festive a**osphere, she was faced with the regulation of refusing to stay at midnight. It was only because the minor could not ask the parents to inform the hotel in the middle of the night. Check-in... Besides, this underage girl's check-in was also approved by her parents, and we promised to let her call the parents in front of the hotel owner during the daytime tomorrow morning to express the parents' approval. Authorized, but the hotel manager insisted that he would not be flexible. He had to prove that the woman called the parents in the early morning and got permission to check in, or let him go home and say what happened on the road, or that the woman was arguing with her parents. They are all sitting on the sidelines for the family hotel. I would like to ask about the law on the protection of minors. The original intention of this law is to protect minors, but under such circumstances, our three adult girls have the ability to take this underage girl to the hotel After one night, the underage girl went home alone at three in the morning. I would like to ask which of the two can really make this law have the effect it should have, and which action will make this girl Women's personal safety is not guaranteed?
In the end, under the stalemate, the girl called her own father who was insomniac at 4:00 in the morning. He was asked to get up to find a pen and ID card to take a photo, and handwritten authorization and consent to his daughter. The picture is transferred to the lobby manager to get the confirmation of the visitor registration. In this way, after an hour has passed, we spent this time in the lobby, and maybe we can make everyone fall asleep early.
Extremely disappointed with the Hilton Hotel, even more disappointed with the Tianhe Hilton Hotel, and most disappointed with these four overbearing people. What kind of international talents has Hilton cultivated to give the residents such a rubbish experience, and the lobby manager wearing an N95 mask is extremely excessive, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, and what is under the hypocritical mask? The hypocritical face keeps repeating that it doesn't make sense to tell you, and you don't believe what you searched for on the Internet. Even speculating on the psychology of customers and maliciously judging others, is such a person worthy of being a hotel manager? At that time, two other customers who were present couldn't stand it anymore, and begged the front desk manager to know how to change the overall situation, but Yumu's head is Yumu's head after all. Very bad experience! Hilton Tianhe will never meet you!

The attitude of the receptionist at the front desk is generally acceptable, but the worst is that the waiter at the door of the restaurant is outsourced? It is not convenient for the hotel to order takeaway but the restaurant is not tasty and the service attitude is not good.

The location of the hotel is not bad. I don't know if it is because of the distance from the Military Sports Institute. It is very quiet at night. There are very few quiet hotels in the bustling city center. The disadvantage is that the lobby is quite small, the room is not small and the bed is huge, and there is no peculiar smell. Generally speaking, it is ok.

msg:There are two aspects of the hotel that are not very satisfactory. The first is the instructions for the parking lot. There is no clear sign of minus three. I always thought that minus two was minus three. It took 25 minutes to find a parking space there! Second, the water drained from the bathtub in the room flowed out, making the entire dry area of the bathroom wet. I was still absorbing water at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night... (considering that I didn't call the front desk late at night), other aspects are ok, even in the morning Swim early!

msg:I chose Hilton Hotel because I trusted this brand everywhere, but this time I was very disappointed. My wife came out of the shower and put on a bathrobe, and then she became allergic. It started at 10 o'clock in the evening, and then her skin was red, swollen and itchy all night, and she couldn't sleep. The hotel said to take the bathrobe to test, take the bathrobe away -.- take it out and change it, who knows? Itching, swelling and pain all night long, the hotel arranged to go to the nearby hospital at 6 in the morning, saw the doctor, the doctor confirmed that it was a skin allergy, and then returned to the hotel, the sound insulation of the next room was really bad, by 10 in the morning Just fell asleep! The allergy was not resolved after waking up, so I informed the hotel, ignored it, and questioned that it was not the bath towel! Fortunately, my wife only wears a bathrobe when she is wearing clothes, otherwise it must be more than a neck allergy! Now is the issue of your hotel hygiene! Everyone thinks it over carefully, the duty manager Yu xx Zheng xx also said to compensate us for a buffet, but we don't want this. I came to your hotel to relax, not to stay up all night and go to the hospital by myself in the morning! No one wants to encounter their own uncomfortable situation, the hotel's solution attitude is really not good! Delayed my whole day's itinerary, this hotel is so rubbish that it won't solve the problem!

Although it is near the station, it is not noisy, and the grade is much higher than that of Hilton Hampton not far away, especially the customer's bathing area, which is relatively isolated but has a sense of design. In short, it is quite good experience. PS. It would be better if a mouse pad can be used for the glass writing desk in the guest room.

After checking out the next day, I found that the child‚Äôs electronic watch was left behind in the hotel. I took a taxi to get it, and asked them to deliver it to the door. I would like to call and ask someone to deliver it when I arrived. When the car arrived at the door of the hotel lobby, there was no one answering the phone. When I went to the front desk to ask, the lady at the front desk told me to wait patiently, because she didn't know, she didn't answer the phone, and she had to receive other guests, so I waited for five minutes before they went to get it. This service is really top-notch, really a five-star service standard

. First of all, let‚Äôs talk about service. We booked three rooms that night. We were a little late when we arrived at the hotel, and we were tired. When we checked in at the front desk, we urged the waiter to ask if we could hurry up, but the waiter actually replied, ‚ÄúAlright. What are you urging in less than 6 minutes?" I'm really amazed, can't it be done in less than 6 minutes? I asked the waiter why he had such an attitude, and the waiter replied something even more unexpected: I am responsible for my actions! . I am completely speechless.
As for hygiene, I won't say much, you can look at the gray in the picture

msg:Ctrip members have rarely commented and rarely expressed their opinions for many years. I am very disappointed with this hotel. This brand, this price, and this service really can‚Äôt be said that one person can stay at night and directly give it to the room at the end of the corridor. It's really speechless The sound of the door of the cabinet opening is really similar to the dubbing of a ghost movie. It is recommended to stay at night. Don't open the cabinet door. Paranormal events The dim lighting in the bathroom and the black glass door make people dare not close the door to take a shower. What makes people speechless is that the shower room is so big that the flower nozzle is attached to the wall. The design makes people only have to take a shower against the wall. Brother Huo said that there is a problem with the management of this hotel. Takeaways cannot be placed in the front hall of the hotel, let alone let the hotel service staff deliver them. Compared with other services such as robot meal delivery from other hotels that are not particularly good, this hotel feels really managed. There is a big problem. I feel that customers owe others money. I will not consider this hotel next time. Remember to check in and don't open the cabinet door easily.

I went shopping at Dongfang Baotai in the afternoon. It took 6 minutes to walk to the hotel. After 15 minutes, Amanda, the lady at the front desk, patiently helped us to check the housing situation, and even gave us a free upgrade. The overall environment is clean and tidy. During the period, the TV was in a small condition and a little brother came to repair it immediately. The buffet breakfast on the second day was quite satisfactory, although the dishes were updated in a timely manner with many people, it was eaten directly as a brunch. The sun is out in the morning, and the landscape of high-rise buildings is still ok. Generally speaking, it is still ok.

msg:The experience of staying at Hilton Guangzhou Tianhe this time is very good. 1) The service attitude of the front desk, restaurant waiters, cleaning staff, etc. is very good. I have stayed in many hotels, but it is very rare to have such good and friendly service. Especially when I went to the western restaurant on the 2nd floor for three times, the service staff remembered us, what we ate last time, and what my daughter didn't like to eat. It makes people feel that they really like the job, so there is a special kindness in the service. 2) The location of the hotel is very good. It is very close to the surrounding shopping malls and special food points. 3) The room is quite big, and the facilities and supplies are very good and convenient. The view from the floor-to-ceiling windows is amazing. 4) The gym, infinity pool and spa massage on the 6th floor are very good. 5) The buffet dinner on the 2nd floor and the Italian restaurant are both great!
If speaking of improvement suggestions, I hope: 1) The buffet breakfast can be changed more. 2) Lights that can provide bright spots in the room. (We happened to need to work at night and forgot to ask if the hotel had bright lights.)
Next time I come to Guangzhou, I will stay at Hilton Tianhe.

I don't have to worry about the problem that the general swimming pool disinfectant is heavy and the air is not good. it is good. The bedding in the room is comfortable and stylish. I was fortunate to meet Jason, the executive housekeeper, in the lobby, asking about my stay experience and inviting me to stay next time, which attracted much attention. The Chinese food is good, especially I like a bite of marble. After eating it, I can't forget it. The breakfast is especially fireworks. I like the tender tofu flower the most.

msg:The value for money of the hotel is really high.
It takes about 15 minutes to drive from the vicinity of Zhujiang New Town.
The outside of the hotel is very beautiful at night. There is a pool on the side of the lobby. The reflection of the lights in the water looks like the stars in the night sky. Open the curtains in the room to see the night view of the city.
They pay more attention to environmental protection, and the garbage bags, bathtub covers, pens, and even toothbrushes that are used in daily hotels will be equipped in the room. They don't, they will give you a toothbrush alone, and even the pens used are made of paper.
The itinerary code is required to enter the lobby, and it is also required for check-in. When entering the elevator in the room at night, two staff members ask and confirm whether they are customers who have already checked in. They also need to swipe the card to enter the elevator to the floor. Makes people feel safe.
There is a small robot in the lobby cleaning the ground back and forth, but it rained yesterday, we walked in near the front desk, and it was indeed easy to slip when we stepped on it, so it is recommended that the front desk check in as much as possible on rainy days. measure.
When I woke up in the morning and looked out the window, I found that there should be a school downstairs, with a basketball court and a football field. When I was about to leave, I looked to the other side of the building, and it seemed that there were troops running neatly.
There are no obstructions in the front and rear, and it is relatively quiet.
After checking out, in the afternoon, there are still people who call them to ask about the check-in experience, and they feel that they are also collecting and improving.
It is worth recommending. Next time I go to Guangzhou, I will really stay here again.

msg:If you have a negative score, you will give a negative score. The praise of this hotel is all brushed. It is recommended that you read more of the negative reviews. Including my room upgrade is also a "exchange" of praise, not a direct upgrade of Hilton Diamond Card rights, and I need to take the initiative. There was a problem during the stay. When I was telling the truth in the Ctrip review, the staff began to change their faces. The preferential price became a high price, and the price was indiscriminate. The official website has even lower prices. Lee, this stay really made me feel Hilton's arrogance and rudeness, and the spicy chicken is extremely spicy! Kitty Cui Yanrong is even more outrageous, her service awareness is weak, and she doesn't know how to pass Hilton employee training. If it is age and qualifications, I can understand. Otherwise, dealing with problems is not like dealing with children. This person likes to make small things bigger and intensify customer conflicts. Because of small disputes with friends, I went back to my room to sleep, and when I was half asleep, Kitty Cui called me and told me that the door frame was damaged. Quoted a high compensation price, made a random quotation before the third-party report came out, spoke too much on the phone, and even told my colleague Lee that I was provocative! What's your status? I provoke you? Not only that, Kitty Cui also asked me to call the police. I negotiated compensation for the door frame and asked: Can a small piece of the door frame be broken, can I find someone to repair it myself? Kitty Cui has a bad attitude and said no, I said I don‚Äôt know who damaged it and how it was damaged. Yes, I didn't say no compensation, I wanted to know the ins and outs and asked to check the surveillance, because it was a blind spot, I was in the room, Kitty Cui said you don't know how your friend got into your room? I'm sleeping, so you don't have to get excited. As a hotel service worker, can you control your emotions? Later, I asked him to tell me my name. Kitty Cui refused to tell me that I tried to avoid responsibility and not face my mistakes head-on. , In fact, even my pets have Chinese names. Later, I found Kitty Cui's name from other employees, so I won't disclose it, lest Kitty Cui's curvy nature will make you troublesome! I will still complain to Hilton HQ! You also said on the phone that you are willing to complain! After that, I handed it over to my colleague Lee. There is still a problem with the quotation this time. Wouldn't you ask someone to repair it and then quote it? If you quote a high price, you won't see what's broken. When negotiating with Lee, Lee ran the train with his mouth full, thinking that I was writing a bad review to express my emotions, I think it was you who had emotions! What else did you say aside from your identity, let me tell you Lee: now you are solving a problem, not playing a house with you, you need to recognize the reality! If you put aside your identity, you may not be able to say a word, you may not be able to see it, and it is not your turn to speak. In Ctrip's comments, I am expounding the facts, and the eyes of the masses are sharp. When negotiating, the compensation for the carpet is thousands of yuan per square meter. If you don't say it, I still don't know that the carpet is dirty. There are pictures below. It also said that this hotel is different from other old hotels. Some leaders and employees have shaken hands with the leaders. Some hotels have shackles. Does this have anything to do with me? Does it have anything to do with you Lee? Haha, I have already given you a five-star review according to your needs. If I can cancel it, I will definitely cancel it! In the follow-up, Lee said that Kitty Cui had the heart to admit that he was overly aggressive. I think if you, Kitty Cui, sincerely admit that you were wrong, you should apologize in person instead of asking me to come down to find you on the phone? You are so powerful, did you make a mistake? Lee also persuaded Kitty and Cui to be old, so if he was too old, he would not recognize him, find someone to come over to the unclear rounder, and hide himself. If this is the case, I can understand it if it is menopause! Being old is not the reason why you can rely on the old and sell the old. Age does not represent experience. Some people are still giant babies in their 30s and 40s. The follow-up issues that should be dealt with have not been dealt with well, and you will not return the phone after calling Kitty Cui over and over again. I will find you personally as you said, and I am still waiting for your apology from Mr. Kitty Cui! No answer to the phone, no reply after repeated calls. Start to run away. I suggest you don't come here. The surface is five-star, the facilities are outdated, and the service is one-star. From the security guard to the manager, it is full of yin and strange and uncomfortable emotions. Except for the staff in the executive lounge, which is a little better, the others are not as fast. Hotel, really ashamed of your service! ridiculous! I hope you will memorize Hilton's core corporate values! In the follow-up simple matter, because Cui Yanrong ignorantly escalated the situation to the police station, Cui Yanrong did not communicate and directly called the police, and Cui Yanrong did not cooperate in the follow-up, and did not coordinate with the police station. Isn't it the one you called the police? In addition to wasting time, he said that he was not answering the police station at work. Before that, Cui Yanrong lied to call the police, but a patrol came to defraud the guests. We need to find Cui Yanrong's superior, she did everything possible to stop her, and asked her peer Lee and Lee's side. And Reply Choi ignored us and started to run away. He didn't hand over the work. In the end, Cui Yanrong told us to deduct the compensation fee from the deposit privately, and refused to apologize again. It's not that we didn't pay but you didn't have a reasonable process, and the quotation was false and shameless. Speaking of the engineering depar**ent of the engineering depar**ent, I didn't even see a person. The price is one day, three hundred today and five hundred tomorrow. Are you an aunt in the vegetable market? After negotiation earlier, Lee disappeared again. In the end, instead of paying 100 yuan, it was a waste of the guests' time. Cui Yanrong said, you didn't waste my time. It's funny, you upgrade yourself. The employees in the executive lounge felt that it was unnecessary. Hilton really needs to train and train employees to deal with emergencies. Is it possible to have employees like Cui Yanrong? She also kept saying that she was a Hilton employee and cultivated such ignorant employees. Unethical!

A small suggestion is to hope that the hotel has a unified management for the guests' take-out, and the food and drink can be sent upstairs, otherwise it is really inconvenient

msg:The first time I stayed at the Hilton Tianhe, the experience was very good, and the service was very thoughtful. Because I didn't inform in advance that a smoking room was required, I waited at the front desk for a while. The front desk of the hotel sent us two drink rolls. After the room inspection was completed, I contacted us. We took the room card, because the remark was that we needed a bathtub and we also contacted the hotel by phone. It was very considerate to upgrade us to a deluxe double room. The hotel also gave us a delay to check out until 2 pm, and we were still at the elevator door when we returned to the hotel in the evening. Check the room, this is enough for our safetyüëçüëç

As long as it's not too personal and differentiated comments, such as service and bedding experience, I don't care so much, but this is not soundproof and the noise is too loud, and the people upstairs are the same as dancing at night. The next room is also talking like a quarrel. I just want to have a good rest when I go out, but I didn't fall asleep at 3:00 in the middle of the night.
The other is this quilt, the sound is almost like a raincoat, () There is no problem with softness and lightness) If you move it a little, it will be scary to death

The first night I slept in the middle of the night and the bedside light suddenly turned on, woke up, turned it off, and continued to sleep, but after sleeping for half an hour, the light automatically turned on again, 3 times in a row, and soon the air conditioner automatically turned off again, and then turned on again when I woke up. , I didn't sleep for one night, and I changed to another room the next day, which was even more ridiculous. I was very angry and called the front desk to complain. I just finished talking, and the power went out again. What kind of ghost hotel is this? The house price is still different every day. If you are like me, if you only renew the room the next day, you should ask about the room price in advance, because it is different every day, and the difference can be 3-4 hundred yuan.

The little brother who greeted the guest was very enthusiastic to help with the luggage, and helped to carry the luggage up the steps. The room service is also excellent. Every time I help you keep it in good order. Then I found that the observation was very careful. Because the winter was dry and I brought children, I kindly helped to add water. By the way, in fact, I think it is very good to book an executive room, because the dim sum in the executive lounge is really amazing, and I like the dim sum of the hotel very much. Every afternoon, you can enjoy free afternoon tea time and eat all kinds of delicious dim sum. great. The price is also moderate. It is very convenient to eat, travel and shop around downstairs.

The next day the hotel's return visit staff asked if they had any suggestions for the hotel. When they put forward the small suggestions to solve the above two problems, the telephone return staff kept refuting and refuting the explanation. I just made suggestions as required. The practice and language of the returning staff made me seem to be making a complaint call, as if my suggestion was an unreasonable request. If the suggestions are always refuted, what kind of fancy phone calls is your hotel doing? The suggestions made can be improved or not, is it bad? Will never choose this hotel again!

üçÉEnvironment: The same hotel as the Sheraton Guangdong. The Westin Hilton by Marriott near the sports center is the first choice Hilton. The location is good, the scenery is open, and the facilities are well maintained. It can be seen that the hotel has taken a lot of effort to maintain it.
If you make a reservation, it is recommended to book a panoramic suite or an elegant suite. This time I booked a 270¬∞ panoramic panoramic suite. The view is not too good, the view is completely unobstructed, and you can see most of the dimly lit night view of Zhujiang New Town. The room is huge, even if you don‚Äôt get out of the room, you don‚Äôt feel bored at all, hahaüôà

üîîService: I would like to thank the little brother MAX, the front desk manager, for the super caring and kind service. In addition, there are Suki and Shawn in the front office, Chris, the switchboard manager, and Candy in charge. And every service staff who gave me quality service during my stay. how to say? It's really love. Probably because the experience of staying here is too good, the next hotel will be transferred from the nearby Marriott Depar**ent.

In addition, it blows up the hotel‚Äôs breakfast, whether it is the executive lounge with a wide view or the buffet restaurant with 7 or 8 open kitchens on the second floor. The nutrition is comprehensive and not repeated, even üà∂ my favorite pancake fruit and fresh meat ravioli. üòã

Concierge A deliberately closes the door and I hold it in one hand. After the luggage pushed the heavy back door with one hand, I noticed that the front desk was on the left. Concierge B insisted that I go to the right and take me to the C (Xie) concierge to take my temperature and read the health code. I would like to ask whether the C concierge is an uncle. Ancestor? I toss and toss with my luggage and go there. I asked the C concierge. Have you ever seen the health code? Do you want to see it at the front desk? He said that I have seen others and don‚Äôt need to look at it. The tone is very strong and the attitude is very arrogant. I stand in front of the C concierge. He is right. I am gesticulating and telling me that you point over there. These words are very bad attitude. I am in your way. Where is the pride and confidence of your hotel staff? This hotel is not very good. I moved here to save money. No matter how good the hotel is, your employees don‚Äôt have much capital to be proud of. Let‚Äôs meet them and go to the front desk. It can be seen that the hotel service is extremely poor. No one helps guests with luggage and assistance.

Poor soundproofing, upstairs footsteps, voices of women in the room on the left

Facilities are old

The room light is very dim

The air conditioner is very noisy

The quality of slippers is similar to that of a small street hotel

Check out a total of three staff members, one of whom can only issue invoices, and then at 14:00, a lot of people need to queue up. The place is about 4 meters away from the front desk. The order in front of me is very poor and there is no one to manage. Only two staff at the hotel front desk can handle it

msg:One of the most affordable five-star hotels in Tianhe, Guangzhou, is a business-style hotel. The deluxe double room was only 618 a night, which is why it is so popular.

Welcome: There is no sense of ritual of opening a car door, as expected.

Lobby: It is spacious and requires scanning code and temperature measurement. Unexpectedly, you would have to line up to check in at four o'clock in the afternoon. Fortunately, there are 6-8 people on duty at the front desk, which is pretty fast. Because the rooms on the smoking floor have not been cleaned, you have to wait in the lobby for about 1 hour. However, the front desk also made compensation, and you can check out until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, which is more humane. The only minor episode was that 45 minutes later, the front desk asked me to call me whether the room was ready. I didn't wait until I was impatient and went to consult by myself.

Room: Arranged on the 10th floor, the room type is still good, the regular layout, no surprises or surprises. However, the accident finally happened the next day. The drain of the bathtub leaked, and the floor was wet, and the experience directly declined.

üßπSanitation: Look at the picture, the details are not in place. Maybe the hotel is a little old, and there are signs of mildew in the tiles in the bathroom.

Suixuan Chinese Restaurant: The products are quite good, and registered members can also get a 10% discount. Will definitely visit again, delicious and delicious. The per capita is about 300. Of course, if you don‚Äôt order big seafood, if you only drink morning tea, it is estimated that the per capita is about 150. For those who serve the bar, the waiters are very polite and mainly communicate in Mandarin.

Summary: In terms of personal feelings and experience, the first impression is the price discount, and other experiences and feelings are defeated by the details. For the same price and star rating, Sofitel and Grand Hyatt are even better.

Easter eggs: For those who like to take out, neither Sofitel nor Hilton has a takeout station. If you receive a call, you have to fly downstairs to get it. Secretly tell you, Grand Hyatt has a takeaway station on the first floor, but the downside is that all guest rooms have to turn to the elevator on the 20th floor. Personal staying experience, 600 (Grand Hyatt) park food, 800 (Marriott) buy buy buy, 1100 (Ritz-Carlton) Canton Tower, and more than 1400.

Children can‚Äôt enter the gym. This is a disadvantage. We two adults just wanted to take the children out to play. We wanted to go to the gym together, but the children were not allowed to enter the gym. In the end, the adults couldn‚Äôt enter the gym.
The rest are okay.

There are many people at breakfast, which is very good, the waiters are very polite, and there are many kinds of meals.
The afternoon tea on the executive floor is on the first floor. The place is dark and crowded, and there is no outside view.

Very good, the price is very high!

I arrived late at 11 o'clock in the evening, and the female colleague next to him was pretty good except for the first man who was not good. When I arrived at the front desk, the man kept on the phone. I waited until he finished the call, but he ignored the other person after the call. He walked straight behind him. I was really baffled. Behind him was the female colleague next to him. I received five-star praise from that female colleague. The aunt who does hygiene is also very good. There is still interaction every day. If you come back next time, you should also stay at Hilton. Overall feeling pretty good

msg:This time I stayed at the Hilton Hotel and felt that I received Hilton‚Äôs arrogance and rudeness, especially unfriendly to parent-child travel, not a parent-child hotel. 1. I got off the plane and arrived at the hotel at 9:30 last night, pushing the stroller with my luggage, holding the child, and there was no welcome at the door, and no one helped with the luggage. After we checked in at the front desk, we drove the car with our children to the elevator, and unexpectedly found that many people were jammed at the door of the elevator, and a waiter in the lobby blocked everyone to check their identities. I showed my room card and said I wanted to check in quickly, but he actually stopped us and asked us to queue for information. I expressed my disapproval, and I was suddenly shouted fiercely by the lobby staff. It was the regulations of the Guangzhou Municipal Government. I would like to ask: (1) Why didn't I check it clearly when I checked in at the front desk, and blocked everyone in the elevator. (2) The first time I stayed in a five-star hotel, the hotel staff was murdered. Why are you Hilton? Do you feel that we are not worthy of staying in your Hilton Hotel with our children? (3) Where did the Guangzhou Municipal Government stipulate that we should be blocked in the elevator to check our identity. I took a plane and landed at the airport without being asked. (4) What is your status and why do you talk to me like this? Did I spend money to make Hilton kill you, let alone we brought the children. You didn't say to help us with our luggage, but you still treated us like this. The above elevators have monitoring to check the video. 2. After swimming the next morning, the child was still sleeping. I wore hotel room slippers to eat breakfast from the 20th floor to the 2nd floor. I was actually stopped and said that I am not allowed to enter in the hotel slippers. I would like to ask: (1) Let's apply. When you checked in, you knew that I bought breakfast. Why didn't you tell the front desk that you cannot wear slippers to enter the restaurant. (2) I said that I went in and made a porridge for the child and took a piece of bread and came out. The Hilton service staff actually rushed to us and stopped me, as if I was a beggar, afraid that I would rush in and disturb the noble dining customers inside. Show Hilton's rudeness vividly. (3) If my shoes are broken and I don‚Äôt have shoes, can I not eat breakfast anymore? If the problem arises, I don‚Äôt help the customer to solve the problem. I just force the customer to take the elevator from the 2nd floor to the room on the 20th floor to change shoes and eat again. apology. 3. I had breakfast at the hotel. I said whether I had packed the bag or not. The child was sleeping. When we woke up, we drove the car, hoping to bring something to eat in the room. The breakfast service manager actually said that he couldn't pack it, so he had to come down to eat. I brought a 2-year-old child. The Hilton Hotel is powerless. 4. We stayed in the executive room, and the drinks in the executive room were charged. The drinks in the bar away from you for the first time I stayed in a five-star hotel will be charged separately. In this case, what is the difference between your Hilton executive room and the ordinary room! 5Finally, I stayed in five-star hotel chains such as Marriott, Kempins, and Sheraton. For the first time, I felt so powerless and arrogant, and angry at the child and the bad hotel. If I hadn't taken the child, I couldn't check out because I just got off the plane and caught the high-speed train the next day. In short, Hilton, really rubbish!

Like we often travel on business, we know whether the bedding is high-end as soon as we lie in bed. The quilt in a hotel is soft and not stuffy. Very comfortable. And when I get up in the morning, there is almost no noise outside, and the parking lot is quite clean. It is very good to park and go directly to the lobby. The overall hotel planning is very good. And there is no smell of carpet in the hotel. The point is that this location is very good, and the price is very reasonable. The hotel staff is also very active and enthusiastic. Very good next time I go to work and will choose to stay. It‚Äôs just the price of breakfast. I don‚Äôt know what to eat. It feels a bit high, so I chose no breakfast. I also hope that the swimming pool will be opened soon after the epidemic.

The sofa in the room was bought from the second-hand market. When I went out to do business, I came back after three o'clock in the afternoon, and the room was not cleaned. The overall evaluation was not as good as that of the Express Hotel. The last thing I want to say is that Hilton has indeed gotten worse and worse in recent years.
