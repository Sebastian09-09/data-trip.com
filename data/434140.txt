When we arrived the hotel management including GM welcomed us and Nancy from guest relations, she is brilliant! She helped us everything during our stay. Booked spa, restaurants, guide tour to temple.. Our room was very special, decoration, ambience, towels, bed linens, pillows all are so nice, comfortable! All the hotel staff are very helpful and smiley all the time. You must try SPA ! We tried Vegetarian restaurant and Steam House. Both are great! All in all fantastic experience and another proof that you can not go wrong with Aman group

msg:Aman in Hangzhou is the perfect staycation destination. The environment is calming and beautiful, relaxing and natural. The staff and service at Amanfayun is probably the best second only to the hotel grounds itself. The room was beautiful and had probably the best sleep I‚Äôve had in a long time as the room becomes completely pitch black and the bed is super comfortable. The spa was unreal, with an ensuite for every service (1 or 2 people). The spa is located next to the pool which had to be my favorite thing about staying there - the afternoon tea by the pool was amazing, delicious, and so cute. It wasn‚Äôt hard to feel comfortable or communicate because the majority of staff speaks English. The hotel has 6 places to eat, but I will say as someone who doesn‚Äôt eat meat it was a little hard to find options at the hotel but super easy to order food in! If you do eat meat, no problem, there are many options. Definitely recommend Amanfayun to anyone but especially anyone looking for a weekend away with family, a friend, or a loved one. Thanks Aman!

The environment is also impeccable, the best choice for quiet and refreshing. The cats who love leisure are not afraid of people and have their own attitude of the owner. The beef hot pot in the steamed food house is unexpectedly delicious! 
Personally, I think there is room for improvement in the hardware and privacy of the bathroom area. You can consider adding a washlet. Although it was the turn of spring and summer when I went there, the coldness of the toilet cover was still surprisingly uncomfortable. Thinking of the picture of sitting on it in the winter... The bathroom has no sound insulation, and every sound of sitting on the toilet can be transmitted to the whole room, and the a**osphere is instantly awkward. Although we are family, the necessary decency and privacy must be taken care of. For this point, you can look at Zixuan's design.

msg:Amanfayun has once again refreshed my understanding of hotels. It is no longer just a hotel, but a high-energy field that transcends the world. In particular, every work of Master Yuanxin of Fayunshe brings a deep shock to people! There are also original boxes.
Here is not only enjoyment, but healing, and nourishment for the body and mind. The Feng Shui treasure land surrounded by 7 ancient temples, everything is the original ecology of Fayun Ancient Village. Here, every blade of grass and every tree has Buddha nature, which can make the mind stable and enlightened, which is something that no amount of money can buy.
All the facilities in the room make you feel that you are talking to the ancients. The pure wooden door and window design and the antique bed are not only very safe, but also the bedding is of good quality, and you fall asleep very quickly. The Longjing tea and Master Yuanxin's paintings are great. Each snack has its own style, and every bite is amazing.
I am also very grateful to the enthusiastic and sincere service staff, especially Manager Hong of the Security Depar**ent, who sent us to Feilai Peak on a rainy day to explain to us the stories of the surrounding ancient temples and Amanfayun. What is amazing is that the Longjing wooden barrel bath and the mugwort bath make people feel like they are in another world and relax their whole body and mind. This kind of relaxation is hard to experience in other places. In addition, the customer service is also attentive online 24 hours a day, which is quite good.
In short, Amanfayun is worth coming again. Each season is different. It is suitable for practice, for nourishing the heart, and for healing. As long as you are good to yourself, you must come to Aman!

Four seasons of West Lake. The rankings are indeed correct. Needless to say, the hotel environment is good. The service in the ancient village next to Lingyin Temple is very good. The guy from Fayunshe is happily doing handicrafts with the guests after work. As for accommodation, since we have booked a farmhouse, we can adapt to it. The arrogant cat master is very cute.

üåøThe environment is really good~The air is super fresh~Everyone should love the feeling of living among the birds and the fragrance of flowers~When the sun comes out, there are mottled light and shadow everywhere~It‚Äôs so beautiful~
üíÅüèº‚ôÄÔ∏èThe service is really attentive~ You can receive warm greetings from the hotel staff at any time~ The rooms are full of Chinese New Year flavor~ The room service can be said to be responsive to all requests~ Due to renovation restrictions, there is no bathtub in the room~ The spa provides free baths~ Night hotel The staff will come to the door of the guest room with a flashlight to pick you up ~ The floor heating in the room is very warm ~ it will make your feet hot üòÇ There are different experience activities every afternoon ~ The guest room also provides scriptures and manuscripts for everyone to copy ~ There were not many guests when we checked in ~The hotel also thoughtfully provided airport drop-off serviceüëçüèª
üè°The design is really unique~ Entering the hotel seems to be in a paradise~ It is in sharp contrast with the hustle and bustle of the surrounding scenic spots~ Adhering to the concept of restoring the old as before~ The designer basically retained the original style of Fayun Ancient Village~ The garden landscape is natural~
üìçThe location is really convenient~ The main road of the hotel leads directly to Lingyin Temple, Faxi Temple and other temples~ When you check in, you will get tickets to Feilaifeng Scenic Area~ We got up early to go to Lingyin Temple~ We can finish at 11 o'clock when we return to the hotel breakfast üçΩ
A few shortcomings:
üí°In order to restore the life of the ancient village ~ there is no TV in the room ~ the lighting is indeed a bit dark ~ there is no bedside table and I have to use a chair instead üòÇ
üêûBecause there are many green plants and there are many mosquitoes~ even in winter~
üöΩThe bathroom design is a bit anti-human ~ You should really consider adding a glass partition or something ~ at least it can isolate the smell üòÇ
üößBecause the main road is a municipal road open to the public ~ the security personnel are always checking whether you are a hotel guest ~ of course to protect the privacy and security of the guests ~

Overall, it is a special experience. It makes people calm down and completely relax. It is not easy to feel the current design purpose. I still miss the hotel's environment and considerate service. It also makes me want to experience other Aman hotels. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hygiene: Normal five-star level, there may be bugs, but if you live in a village, don‚Äôt expect so much.

Environment: It is located in the West Lake Scenic Area, next to the temple. I heard that there is a morning recitation service at Lingyin Temple, but it was canceled when I came. It was a pity.

Service: There is a small shuttle bus in the hotel area, which is on call and the staff is professional and attentive.

Catering: Breakfast is a la carte, and many Hangzhou snacks are exquisite beyond expectations. The steamed vegetable restaurant for lunch is well cooked and suitable for healthy people. Dinner was the only failure, Ye Ye Bodhi (not directly operated by Aman), the Beijing branch was treated to a meal at a business bureau and felt relatively new at the time. I saw a rating of 4.9 on the public and an average of 500 to 600 people, so I went to try it. However, because of Valentine‚Äôs Day, I could only use the designated set meal for 1,500 per person. I have not researched on vegetarianism and have only eaten Jingzhao Yin. After eating, I felt like 200 per capita cannot be more.

During the festival, Lingyin Temple is bustling with people, and here is a paradise far away from the hustle and bustle, with green eyes, gurgling streams, and the fragrance of sweet-scented osmanthus on both sides of the Fayun Trail. Feeling relaxed and happy!

msg:This is an unexpected resting experience, peaceful, quiet and full of the fragrance of grass and trees (please don‚Äôt mind my lack of knowledge), tall and lush trees, lush shrubs, and the proud owners‚Äô postures of cute cats. I am completely relaxed. I am not the center of attention in this resort among tea gardens and ancient temples. The service staff are always at hand, and they are almost invisible in no time. I stayed in 4 suites this time and experienced the different feelings brought to the residents by the different structural buildings of the year. The slightly dark hall of Tianjing, which is in one courtyard, and the spacious and bright upper and lower floors that are climbed up are like a palace in a small village. , the mood suddenly brightened. For me, who is far away from the farming society, and for Westerners who are longing for the mysterious East, it may be the closest way to get closer to that kind of life. At night, beyond the dotted street lights, there is a silent night. Nights without the pollution of city lights are a distant memory. The point that many people complain about is our favorite part of this living experience. Just imagine leaving the city for ten minutes. How lucky you are to be able to shield yourself from the pervasive interference and consumption within a drive. Finally, I would like to say that Hangzhou Fayun Amman may be the most luxurious hotel in Amman. Relocating an entire village and living next to the temples in Hangzhou is an impossible task without the support of the local government, laws and regulations. Of course, it was a good time to catch up. It was an era when everyone was eager to climb up more than ten years ago.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at the "Aman" series. The last time I stayed at Aman in Shanghai, I was quite impressed. It maintained the Aman standard as always. Each Aman has its own characteristics. This one in Hangzhou used the previous one. Fayun Village was built to retain traditional features as much as possible.
Location: Next to Lingyin Temple... There is a direct entrance to the scenic spot, and the hotel will also prepare tickets. I checked in just in time for the first grade of junior high school, and went to Lingyin Temple at 7 o'clock. It was excellent...the flow of people was just right.
Environment: There is a "main road" that foreign tourists can walk on, but not many people know about it, and Aman has a lot of security guards patrolling it all the time to ensure the privacy of staying guests as much as possible.
Facilities: You can‚Äôt say it is new or luxurious, but it is suitable for self-cultivation. There is neither TV nor Bluetooth speakers, and the Internet is average... hahahahahaha... but it is quiet (suitable for impetuous urbanites, such as me). The bathing equipment is from a British brand It‚Äôs a high-end brand (I don‚Äôt know it, but after checking it, it‚Äôs really expensive). Not to mention Dyson, it‚Äôs no surprise that it‚Äôs a must-have for luxury hotels. There is no bathtub in the room, but you can make an appoin**ent for a bath in the spa center and pick up and drop off by battery car, which is very convenient.
Service: The electric car you reserve is never too early or too late. It arrives on time. It won‚Äôt disturb you but is on time! The hotel's middle-level management is still capable of coordinating and resolving emergencies online. The online car-hailing service we ordered was stuck in a traffic jam, so they would ask for a battery car to take us to a compromise location. They have a strong sense of problem-solving.
The only drawback: the hotel's breakfast, how can I say... I don't know if it has something to do with the title of Hangzhou's food desert, but it is really average, and the variety and the value of the ingredients can only be said to be average.

msg:The suite we booked has been upgraded to a luxurious suite. Picture 1 is the appearance.
Pictures 2, 3 and 4 are rooms with poor lighting.
The room is very large, probably because it is too large and has no partitions. The room is located on the first floor and has a flat roof, so the floor height appears to be very low (actually it is not).

[Staying in a hotel is all about service]. Friends who are considering whether to choose this Aman hotel can refer to my evaluation of the service of this hotel.

Serve:
1. Before check-in, the front desk staff told me how to check into the hotel under traffic restrictions, and gave me two addresses: Xiaoyawu Bus Station and Health Service Center. I needed to take a taxi to one of the addresses, and then the hotel arranged a car to pick me up. I. After comparing the taxi prices and duration, I chose to go to Xiaoyawu Bus Station and informed the hotel front desk. A male staff member quickly called me and told me, "It's more convenient to go to the health center. That's how previous tourists came." After I indicated that I checked the real-time traffic conditions and rejected his proposal, his attitude made me feel "annoyed". There was no specific offensive words, but the tone and attitude were unfriendly. I hope he can understand that [his job is to arrange for a car to pick me up, not to arrange for me].
This is the eighth Aman I have stayed at. Except for the Mumu villa housekeeper whom I met before in Phuket (although Mumu is also very gentle), every other employee is very smart and gentle. This is the first time. It's quite surprising to meet a staff member who doesn't express himself in a gentle way.
2. The rest of the staff are very friendly, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because there are too many guests or tourists. When I met the staff in the hotel during the day, they didn‚Äôt even give a hint. However, when I met the staff at night, they all said hello.

facility:
1. The color temperature of the spotlights in the room is not uniform, and the two bedside lamps are also different, giving people a very make-shift feeling.
2. I understand the bathroom style restrictions on the style of basin faucets, but this faucet is too close to the basin. It is okay to wash hands, but it may be inconvenient to wash your face in the morning.
3. The hair dryer has been replaced with a new one (Picture 5), which is quite surprising. The Amans of the same year that I have stayed at before have not replaced it with Dyson.

environment:
The environment is very good, but there are many mosquitoes. Pictures 6, 7, and 8 were taken of other courtyards while strolling around the hotel.

FOOD:
1. Picture 9 shows the room service, which is very fast. The pasta provided by the Western restaurant tastes good, but the steamed shrimp provided by the steamed restaurant is very old.
2. Pictures 10, 11, and 12 are breakfasts. The overall quality and taste are great, and the beef noodles and wontons are especially delicious.
3. It is difficult to locate the hotel‚Äôs outsourced restaurant Lan Xuan, so I was not able to try it.
4. Ye Ye Bodhi is very good, from the environment to the dishes to the service, picture 13.

other:
1. Picture 14 shows the welcome fruits and snacks.
2. Picture 15 shows the turn-down gift on the first night. The turn-down gift on the second night is different (I forgot to take a photo).

Secondly, during this period, every room had a damp smell. I couldn't help but wonder whether a hotel of this caliber had routine maintenance.

msg:The epidemic has been unable to return to China for four years, and the child grew up in the United States at once, lacking the influence of Chinese culture and the United States. When I returned to China again, I chose Fayun Aman to stay for two days.

The style of Aman is full of Chinese aesthetics inside and out. The independent small courtyard is blown by the wind and the shadows of the trees. The plaque of the house is written in Bada Shanren style, which is very commensurate. Because it is a village house style, although the details are not as good as the high-end hotels in the city, it can also highlight the simple beauty of the Chinese countryside. Tried the three restaurants in the hotel one by one and liked them all. The external environment is even more rare, Lingyin is only three minutes away, but Qingling Youjing and Lingyin are originally in the same line, in fact, most of the people who come to Aman come for this spirit and Yin.

In just two days, we climbed the mountain to write, chatted with the masters of the Buddhist Academy, and learned Chinese painting. This kind of peace is really rare for us, but we were worried that our son would feel bored. When he left, he told me that he must come back next year.

I hope this brief image can plant the cause of Chinese beauty in the hearts of children. In fact, the effect is already there. When we returned to Suzhou, our son saw Chinese painting being taught in the studio opposite the house, and actively asked to learn. This initiative surprised us.

What should be thanked more is the young ladies at the front desk. Their service is thoughtful and meticulous. The sincerity begins before arriving at the store and ends after leaving the store. The son also became friends with them because he is also a cat lover!

Mr. Li of the hotel helped us to book the next hotel, which is also a superb design hotel, but that is the next review.

One month after leaving the store, I recalled the Jiuqu Hongmei tea in the hotel. I wrote to buy it, but received a free gift! I am very grateful, and I hope that the summer vacation next year will come soon, so that we can revisit the old place and experience the peace and beauty again!

msg:Objectively evaluate Aman:

‚ë†Excellent location

Traveling to Hangzhou in spring means a lot of people and traffic jams. This time I took my parents to Lingyin Temple. I don‚Äôt want to be stuck on the way to Lingyin Temple, and I don‚Äôt want to wait in a long line before Lingyin Temple opens at 7 o‚Äôclock. Then stay at Aman is preferred. Because you can just walk over from the room, save the time of traffic jams on the way and the physical strength of queuing at the door, in exchange for more time to visit and a happy mood.

‚ë° Hotel hardware facilities

As a person who has been to 30+ countries in the world and stayed in thousands of hotels at home and abroad, I think that the hardware facilities of Aman are still excellent. ‚ë†The temperature, humidity, ventilation, and even oxygen content of the room are handled just right; ‚ë°The bed The instant comfort and slow wrapping degree of the cushion when lying on the human body are also passable; ‚ë¢The touch and friction noise of the bedding is also well controlled; ‚ë£The floor can echo the design in terms of overall decoration, excellent anti-slip, and has floor heating. And the temperature is moderate, you can give a high score ‚ë§ The items in the room are placed in an orderly manner, the refrigerator drinks are facing the same direction, and the ice cubes in the ice bucket are estimated to be about 1 hour before check-in. The time is about 40-45 seconds

‚ë¢About service

‚ë†Every employee is professional, friendly and enthusiastic
‚ë°24-hour front desk, 24-hour butler, 24-hour security in the accommodation area
‚ë¢Fortunately, I met an employee who joined the company on the first day. The young man wrote on his face: the word "sincerity, modest and enthusiastic attitude"
‚ë£Dining in western restaurants and steamed vegetable restaurants. The environment is perfect. The food is perfect.
‚ë§ The front desk manager, foreman, porter, and welcome will wave goodbye for the second time when checking out


Summary: If the budget is enough, I still recommend everyone to experience it. I hope that Aman will get better and better~

msg:Ever since I knew about Aman, I have a longing that I can‚Äôt let go. Aman Fayun is my favorite first Aman. I want to wander on the Fayun Path, with ancient cottages, tea gardens on both sides, and unexpected encounters. The master of the monastery... really came to Fayun Path, the emerald green, simple and quiet makes people calm down instantly, this trip is worthwhile. Since our car number is limited, we can only park the car in the parking lot outside the restricted area. The hotel sent someone to pick us up and arrived at the hotel near noon, so we first went to the hotel's steamed restaurant for dinner. The restaurant is quiet and elegant, with exquisite dishes , Delicious taste, attentive and warm service. After dinner, we went to visit Lingyin Temple and Feilaifeng Scenic Area, where the hotel sent tickets. During this period, our luggage had been put in the room. The waiter knew that we were coming back, and greeted us warmly and gave us the room key and took us to the room. The key A small section of bamboo is tied in the buckle, and the signs of the old house are in the details. The room surprised us even more. It retained the appearance of the old house very well. We walked up the steps on the ground with green moss between the bricks and walked into the room. The light-colored solid wood furniture in the house brightened the slightly dark interior. But it is not obtrusive and feels comfortable. Because we are tired from walking, we made tea and lay on the sofa faintly and felt very comfortable.
In the evening, we went to the SPA center to take a wooden barrel bath to wash away the dust and fatigue of the day. After returning home, we had a good night's sleep. It felt like a small mountain village outside, but the house enjoyed low-key luxury. The next day we were woken up by the chirping of the birds, and we went to the western restaurant. The breakfast was not a buffet style, but an a la carte style. In short, I am very satisfied with the first experience of Aman, and I am not in vain of the obsession of Aman fans. I will continue to experience one Aman hotel after another.

The day before check-in, the hotel called the guest and made an appoin**ent for a wooden barrel bath. After check-in, there is a WeChat account from the housekeeper, and the reply is very timely.
A stone road in the hotel runs through all the rooms and public areas. It takes less than 5 minutes to walk straight down the mountain to Lingyin Temple, and Yongfu Temple is on the left hand side of the hotel.
The rooms are all decorated with antiques, and the modern decoration is almost invisible. The a**osphere created by the dim lighting seems to go back to the past, and everything slows down.
Participated in the hotel's traditional cultural activity - rubbing, the little brother is very patient, and the calligraphy is beautiful. It would be better if there is a frame.
I would like to make a small suggestion, it would be better if some facial cleanser can be provided in the SPA barrel bath. The shampoo is super good, the hair is smooth after washing without conditioner, and it smells like plants.
The overall feeling is very good. Let me know if there are promotions! Ha ha! Hope to stay again.

Our luggage was pulled directly into the room from the parking lot next to the Buddhist College. We checked in in an old room that served as the lobby. The stray cat "Fan Tong" squatted quietly on the threshold with a pot of newly brewed Jiuqu. Hongmei is waiting on the table. The cottage No. 20 we stayed in is called "Jiqing". The 60-square-meter house has floor heating. The shape and look of the floor tiles are a bit like the Lu Mu gold tiles in the three main halls of the Forbidden City. It has an exposed wooden gable beam roof and a Ming-style mahogany bed. , it seems that he has traveled through time and become a Wang Mojie or Su Dongpo in an instant. The rain is gurgling outside the curtain, the mood of spring is fading, and it coincides with the Qingming Festival. I can't help but think of "Han Shi Tie", and I started to write and unfold the scroll - "The spring river is about to enter the house, and the rain is coming incessantly. The cabin is like a fishing boat, in the misty water clouds..." That's it. Forget it, if you are here to travel, you still have to "try new tea with new fire, and enjoy poetry and wine while you are young"!
    I made an appoin**ent at the spa at 20:30. It was already dark. The lights on the alley in Fayun Lane were dim and the signboards were not obvious. I almost missed it. Fortunately, the lady at the front desk of the spa called me softly from the street and she was already waiting here. It's better to call a courtesy car to take you there so you won't miss it. There are a total of three bathroom rooms in the spa, each with a small living room, toilet, and bathroom. You can choose to put essential oils, Longjing, etc. in the bathtub. Drink tea, pour water, wait until the water temperature is right, put the tea into the bucket, and sweep away the travel dust.

Two people can't take a bath one after another, because the water heater can't supply enough hot water, which is okay. However, the shower holder in the bathroom fell off the wall and almost hit me while I was taking a shower, which is just too much. After informing the hotel, the service staff only said sorry, asked me if I wanted to repair it now, and never mentioned it until I checked out. I didn't pursue it, but I am very disappointed with this handling attitude.

The other staff are also good, most of them are hardworking and dedicated, especially the food is delicious, and the steamed vegetable restaurant is cost-effective

Fayun Aman sums it up with two words: Zen and origin.
To sum it up in the vernacular: the public area at night is not dark, everything can be seen clearly, and it is quiet, with just the right lighting. The room is not cold or even very hot, and the bathroom insists on its own insistence but is not difficult to use. The service attitude is friendly and just right. The breakfast was delicious.

Tea is brewed around the stove, accompanied and explained by a tea artist. The sweet potatoes baked outside the oven are not cooked for three hours. The tea artist here discussed and solved this problem with his colleagues: boil the sweet potatoes before roasting, so that they are cooked and fragrant. . And when we sat around the fire, Suwei also talked about life from tea to life, an unforgettable afternoon tea.
The spa center is also very thoughtful, not only there are shower caps but also rubber bands for tying hair, the water level is also adjusted just right, more than half of the space is reserved for guests to add water by themselves, too much pre-filled water is afraid of cold, and the water level is too high Add pressure on the heart. Using an hourglass instead of a timer fits perfectly with the environment. Small cakes and tea are for fear that guests will faint when they take a bath when they are hungry.

msg:The legendary Aman Fayun Hotel is surrounded by more than a dozen monasteries. It is simple and Zen-like, worthy of five-star praise, and the service is really good. I stayed with the elderly at home for two nights during the Chinese New Year, and I felt a strong sense of the New Year, especially the New Year's Eve Yongfu Temple New Year's Eve prayer event led by the hotel manager. We burned incense and rang the bell, which was really lucky and happy. Every activity during the Spring Festival is carefully arranged, and the food in the restaurant is also delicious. This high-end hotel is the best choice for Buddhist believers and friends who love traditional Chinese culture. However, it is not recommended for those who have bad legs and do not like to climb mountains, and those who like luxury and luxury. Because it is estimated that they may not be able to accept this simple and low-key luxury. This time I took the old people to play, so I didn't move around much, and I will come back next time to take a good look.

‚ÄãIn the morning, I opened the door bolt and got straight to the point. When I looked back, my mother was combing her hair under the dim light. I thought I was back to my childhood in a trance~

‚ÄãThe hotel service is very meticulous and considerate, which is also the unique hotel culture of the Aman system.
‚ÄãAfter taking a bath in the evening, I drove back to the room from the spa. Transparent plastic curtains were pulled up on both sides of the car to block the mountain wind at night. I was very moved and amazed by this detail: it turns out that things can be so meticulous!
‚Äã
‚ÄãToday, the traffic control in the mountain scenic area, the car that was called could not get in, the front desk immediately took action to solve the problem.
‚Äã
‚ÄãGood service, quiet environment, really feel at home.
‚Äã
When we arrived at the West Lake in the afternoon, Peng Peng told me that she had already started to miss Aman, and in fact, I also started to miss it.

I hope that Pengpeng can pass the double hundred exam this semester, and I have promised her that the reward is to come to Aman again during the summer vacation and experience the charm of the outdoor swimming pool.

msg:Location: The parking reservation of Lingyin Temple Scenic Spot is reported in the applet in advance. After arriving at the parking lot, the hotel will drive a car to pick it up, which is easy to find.
The front desk prepared hot towels and hot tea, which was very warm. The staff can remember our surnames and greet us warmly.
In the middle of the hotel is a small road, called Fayun Road, along which there are rooms on both sides. There are hotel cafes, spas, restaurants, etc. on the adjacent road. This middle road and the shops on both sides are open to the outside world, and tourists can come in. At the end of the road is an iron gate ticket office, which is the entrance to the Feilai Peak Scenic Area. If you just want to visit this small road, you don't need to stay in a hotel.

There are small paths on both sides of the road to enter the hotel area, there are signs, non-resident guests cannot enter.
The village villa for 3 people has an extra bed on the first floor, and there is a separate toilet and shower room on the first floor, so it is suitable for 3 people. Upstairs and downstairs do not disturb each other. If it is 2 people, it is not recommended. The house is a bit big and I am afraid, especially the massage area, I dare not enter. And because the room is too big, there are some inexplicable areas, which are not used anyway.
The light is indeed a bit dim, everyone should go to bed early. Originally I felt scared, but I didn't expect it to be the best night I slept after traveling for so many days.
The interior of the hotel is relatively boring, and it is boring to take pictures for a day, but it is really good to go around. Especially the path to Faxi Temple, it's so quiet and beautiful...

The breakfast is in the form of an order, the taste is good, and the variety is also rich.
In general, there is nothing wrong with it. I have to say that I am not satisfied. There is no bathtub in the room, so I can only go to the spa to take a wooden barrel bath. Although the hotel will arrange it well, the car will be picked up and delivered, but I still feel that it is not as convenient as the inside of the room. Spa trea**ent There are no additional programs to sell throughout the center and no time limit.
It is really a very suitable place to be in a daze and empty.
I heard from the hotel staff that the room I was staying in was my eldest brother who lived for a month... When I left, I didn't take any cigarettes in the room, a lot of fruit bought by my eldest brother, and gifts from the hotel, so my eldest brother just walked away. Yes, it seems to be cured.
The gym equipment is relatively old, and it is quite scary to be alone. It is recommended to climb the mountain during the day and go to bed early at night.

Environment: The whole hotel is under the shade of green trees, every step is a scenery, very beautiful
There will be personnel at the intersection of the guest room where we live. After arriving, we will help you carry the boxes and guide the way. It is very considerate. We do not live very far. In the middle of the tree-lined path, you can walk or take a shuttle bus. Next to it are the Fayun Club and the Steamed Vegetable Restaurant. , very close

Housing hardware: There are still many drinks in the minibar, free of charge. It is said that the house is relatively dark, but I think it is his characteristic. The Chinese style uses furniture to make different partitions. In summer, the weather is hot and there are mosquitoes, so it is recommended to sleep. time to put the mosquito net down
The toilet is relatively old-fashioned, not as smart, but a little interesting
As soon as you enter the door, there are plenty of snacks and fruits, and the tea is good, including black tea and green tea
The ginger taste of the bathroom products is more exciting haha, the audio Bose, the map is very thoughtfully prepared on the table, and there are scriptures that can be copied,
The bedding is relatively soft, in fact, I hope there are many things to choose from

Catering and supporting: The breakfast is semi-self-service. There are many people who explain to us one day in advance. Order in advance. How can you know that the portion is large and the variety is very rich.
The gym, boutique, coffee shop, and spa are in one area. I am alone all day. The service attitude is very good when booking in advance. The gym is not big, but it has everything it should have, and it is very functional.

Features: The hotel provides tickets for Lingyin Temple and Feilai Peak. You can walk through the hotel to reach the scenic spot, and go in for a walk in the morning. It is very good to pay homage.

The overall is quite satisfactory, there are some small problems in the details, and there are messages in the room, but it is harmless, it is very suitable for emptying and relaxing. Hidden in the city

At 3:30 in the morning, I was awakened by the "indescribable" sound next door. I thought that the child was noisy, and after a while, the elderly and children at home were awakened, but the indescribable voices from the next door were still one after another. Helpless to make continuous calls to hotel guest service, but no one answered. Gradually I understood what the voice was, but some words came, and it seemed that there was "force", and the urge to call 110 arose. Finally, I dialed the hotel reservation number, and the hotel service staff who answered the phone was tired and impatient. After I explained the reason, I asked the security guard to take a look. At that time, I was really angry, and I said on the phone that although it was late, it was still inappropriate to have no one answering. I didn't receive any reply the next day. I confirmed with the front desk at night, saying that I didn't want to sleep in the middle of the night the next night. The front desk said that the guest next door had moved out. When I talked about why no one answered the phone, he said, when I check out, check if the phone in the room is broken. Disappointed and reluctant to say more, I left, just having doubts about Aman's purpose. Others are still very pleasant, for your reference.

msg:If you want to experience it for one night, it shouldn't be continued for 2 days. The service is really joking. (The security guard at the door pointed the wrong direction of the hotel and the parking lot 3 times. It took a long time to wait for the luggage to be delivered. When leaving, the guests had a lot of luggage and did not know how to help. The breakfast is not self-service, and it is inconvenient to book a day in advance)
The environment is really good, it feels like living in the deep mountains, close to Lingyin Temple.

Aman Fayun is located in a quiet place, with shadows of trees, stone paths, clouds steaming and clouds, and it seems to have a fairyland feeling. After staying for one night, the lights are dim, and it seems that I can't see what is inside. I have been thinking, how to check the health status? When I wake up in the morning, the sun shines in, as if I have an intersection with the world...
    The breakfast is a buffet, which is very rich and worthy of the price of staying in a hotel. It is recommended that those so-called gifts should be less and more refined.

msg:The price and service are definitely out of this world, highly not recommended!
1. When checking in, the front desk was probably a novice and was very flustered (is this also training?) and nervous.
2. The whole room was so dark that it seemed like there was a power outage, making it inconvenient to organize or take things.
3. Here comes the biggest problem! The waiter said that there should be a gap of 10-15 minutes between two people taking a shower because there is not enough hot water. I would like to ask, do consumers need to understand this issue? Then why don‚Äôt you solve the problem of such high-end services? If the price is not solved, the price will be lowered. The price is still so good, but the service cannot be provided. Isn't this a loss of your own brand?
4. The old equipment in the gym can be regarded as ancient. The waiter said that because we have been in Aman Ancient Village for a long time, the equipment is also very old. Is there a cause and effect? Can‚Äôt I buy new equipment? Equipment is not real estate. As soon as you enter the gym, no one has been there for a long time. It smells very strong. The hotel has not updated the equipment that cost tens of thousands. How is the brand built? It's like not having a gym.
5. On the day of check-in, the water pipe burst and the water was cut off. Do you dare to imagine that a hotel that costs more than 5,000 yuan a night has no water for bathing and flushing toilets? The hotel did not apologize or reduce prices. Such a large hotel has no emergency measures to deal with this.
Apart from being located in a village, there is nothing special about it. This is just relying on the mountains to make money, relying on the beautiful scenery of nature. What does Aman have to do with you? If a foreign tourist comes to West Lake and stays at a high-end hotel like yours, you will damage the image of China's service industry. Aman Hangzhou is not worthy of the price of 5,000+, bad review! Don‚Äôt contact me to delete comments!

msg:I finally had the opportunity to experience the favorite Aman in China, Aman Fayun. As an Aman Junkie, I have always been nature-oriented and Zen-like. In terms of environment and location, sitting quietly among the seven major Buddhist temples is uniquely endowed by nature, with a favorable location and people.
Aman Fayun is misunderstood by too many people. Those guests who complain about the dilapidated environment, improper repairs, quiet and creepy, or even weird and other factors can directly detour to Aman Venice.
The original intention of the founder, Mr. Adrian Zecha, is to integrate the original ecological environment and local culture, so that Aman's ultimate service concept can make guests as close as home. Compared with the luxurious five-star hotels with jewels, Fayun's plants and trees, bricks and tiles are more authentic and simple, and the staff are simple and lovely. I'm used to vanity and snobbery, but these are enough to impress me. In particular, I would like to thank the housekeeper Allan for choosing a room, arranging a pick-up, and booking a restaurant and spa for me in advance. He led a tour of the village. When checking in, he introduced Fayun‚Äôs geographical environment, historical stories and concepts in detail, which instantly made me curious about Fayun. , he made me feel Aman's ultimate service once again in China.
The fly in the oin**ent is that the socket by the bed is full of lights, and the humidifier sent has to unplug a desk lamp, and it is inconvenient to charge the mobile phone. When the match was lit, it burned so vigorously that it burned the fingers... Allan, the caring butler, also brought scalding oin**ent. In addition, I wanted to buy AMAN's aromatherapy, but the boutique store was not enough.
Everything has the beauty of imperfection. If you also want to come to AMANFAYUN to experience it, you might as well experience it with your heart and true heart.

The evaluation of Aman on the Internet is extremely extreme, and there is no point in the whole process of escaping from the world. But business travelers are not recommended to live at all, it will collapse.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel is located in the ancient village of Fayun. The decoration and the overall style are Chinese and Japanese, which is very healing. Especially the lighting, the room only retains the necessary lighting, as is the road lighting at night, which makes people feel slow down. The candle lighting at the entrance of the western restaurant and SPA center is too dreamy.
üßπHygienic: Mosquitoes are hard wounds, but they are equipped with mosquito repellent (including DEET, the effect is obvious). After cleaning the room, I noticed that the waiters dragged their shoes, so the dirt from the outside would not be brought in. Pay attention to details.
üîîService: There are staff at every intersection of the aisle, and the shuttle bus is available on call. Room service is also very fast. Breakfast is not rich, a la carte plus buffet, not many people do not have to wait in line, which is great, a la carte staple food is delicious, especially Pianerchuan and beef noodles, the taste is absolutely perfect. The Fayunshe activity was very characteristic. The staff continued to continue tea during the whole process, and it passed in less than 2 hours.
Many people complain about the toilet and TV. The TV is a little too small, so it doesn't matter if I don't watch it at ordinary times. The toilet is old-fashioned. The water tank is on the top, and it is relatively small. A man who is more than 1.8 meters above it feels like sitting on a small horse, and the flushing sound is loud, which is a bit unpleasant. The daily fruit and tea are quite good, the fruit is fresh, and one person can't finish it at all. Every day, the pile is high. The tea is Longjing, not in tea bags, so it‚Äôs not fooling at all
There is no such thing as an escape from the world. It is suitable for staying for a few days without going anywhere during the holiday, which perfectly avoids the crowds on holidays. It should be comfortable in winter without so many bugs. The National Day holiday is over, the fat family will continue to move bricks, looking forward to it again in winter

msg:Staying in Aman Fayun for the second time, I was very satisfied.

The biggest advantage and disadvantage of this hotel are one: it is very special, location and architectural style determine this, for the sake of beauty, part of the comfort is given over.

For example, the toilet is old-fashioned, and I don't care about the size and operation of the TV... But I came out to stay in a hotel on vacation, is it to heat the toilet and watch TV? Don't you have that stuff at home? üòÇ

Personally, these bugs that are often complained about are part of the characteristics, so don't play if you are unhappy. But it is too distinctive, and it will never be confused with other hotels, I just love this.

Aman is positioned as a luxury, but it is very different from general luxury hotels. It is more humane and more like some foreign hotels. The hardware is not completely self-sufficient and comfortable. It needs service to supplement, but the service is really good. The housekeeper and staff (including restaurant, SPA, coffee shop) are warm and thoughtful as a whole, and the sense of unity is better than the one in West Lake. .

The service belongs to the kind that is willing to go. For example, I moved a chair, soaked my feet in the bathroom, put up clothes, and didn't tell the waiter, nor would I move it back to you robotically (some hotel room cleaning staff will really force you back to factory settings). For example, the snacks are also changed every day. The matcha puffs delivered on the first day, and the cream is not fresh the next day, they are silently replaced with homemade cookies. These details are very intimate.

Therefore, it is recommended that if you find it inconvenient, you must not hold back and let the butler find a way for you. It's not a foreign country, there is no language barrier, let's just say it.

For meals, it‚Äôs nice not to leave the hotel:

During the decoration of the steaming restaurant, you can eat it in the western restaurant or deliver it to the room. The speed is very fast and the taste is guaranteed. Dongpo meat, steamed mandarin fish with pickled vegetables, steamed dried Chinese sausage with dried tea, and steamed meat are all delicious.

The cafe recommends summer special drinks. Black coffee with syrup and lemon juice is better than Starbucks.

The black pearl and two diamond Lanxuan is suitable for two people or more. It‚Äôs not good for one person to order, but it‚Äôs really delicious.

If you go outside, there are more Internet celebrity eclipse days for about one kilometer to eat (it tastes worse than Lanxuan, but the price is half cheaper) and some coffee and tea. Next to the main entrance of Linyin Temple, you can call the hotel's car to send you.

Fresh fruits will be given out every day. If you don‚Äôt finish eating them, you will fold them up. More and more, each of them is very sweet and of good quality.

In SPA, bathing is generally a little ordinary, but the body and facial massage (160 minutes) is very good. The Longjing tea bath and Aman's own essential oil products are used for massage. The physiotherapist's techniques are good, and the shoulders and necks are much easier. In particular, the effect of the facial care exceeded my expectations, and the complexion and pores of the face were improved.

Hotel tour, this is also beyond expectations.
I chose the West Lake Cruise. The route I took was private and exclusive to the hotel. The same type of rocking boat for the Xu Xianbai Lady, which is rarely seen now, mainly takes the one-way waterway of Lixi Lake and Xinxi Lake. The scenery is very beautiful and there are few people. Quiet, very healing, I took pictures of my meditation in the next year hahaha. Very suitable for posting in Moments. Two sets of afternoon tea were given, and the little brother served them for a long time. The pastries were sweet and salty, and the presentation was exquisite and delicious. The price is not cheap, but it is worth it. It is an unforgettable memory.

Every day after breakfast, go to the temple to stroll around, go to participate in hotel activities, have dinner at the hotel in the evening, a good place for a relaxing holiday. Away from the hustle and bustle, hiding in the mountains, surrounded by ancient temples for thousands of years, a good auspicious place!

msg:Aman hotels with their own characteristics. Although the hotel is directly connected to Lingyin Temple, it is quiet and not noisy. The layout of the Fayun House is very Japanese, which is very suitable for burning time. It is recommended to bring your own book. The activities in the afternoon are very rich, with different day-to-day and more local characteristics, which is better than raising clouds. Compared with the hotel‚Äôs tea room and coffee shop, although the caf√© is spacious and the noisy environment is unbearable, it is recommended to choose the tea shop next door. Since the dinner at Yangyun Hotel left a shadow, the first reaction was to find a restaurant nearby. After all, Hangzhou is so delicious. However, due to various reasons, he chose Lan Xuan nearby. After all, the price of Lanxuan is more acceptable than Ye Ye Bodhi. Two other points to mention: 1. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is an a la carte system, coffee and garland, which is great, but the cooking skills need to be improved. 2. Parking is next to the Buddhist academy. It is recommended that the staff remind you to eliminate it when you need to checkout or eliminate it directly when you check in.

The staff is very nice, the mosquito-proof water in the room is very effective, extra beds can be provided, Lingyin Temple, breakfast (the spring rolls are really delicious), the room comes with a straw hat woven bag and luggage tag, and a small handball is very nice! The front desk can help you post the hand-painted postcards in the room.

Being able to be so close to the Sanskrit meditation, the pillow will bring the light of Buddha! Suitable for two days of leisure and retreat from the world~ The famous Hechaguan Fayun shop of Hangzhou tea culture in the hotel, the Yeye Bodhi of Su Zhai, the realm of eating and drinking, and the cultural taste, suitable for the tasteful and elegant, the service is very good, and it is very safe.

msg:The service is okay, but the environmental hardware is not worth the price. I rarely stay in hotels and write reviews. I really don‚Äôt recommend this hotel. Fortunately, I only stayed for one night. Don‚Äôt go there with children. There are so many mosquitoes. You won't be able to sleep if you share a room with one person at night. The lights are very dim and you don't feel safe. Whoever goes will regret it!

Moreover, this farmhouse has not given employees proper wages and training, and the employees' mental outlook is not good. This may be the Zen we need to experience.
