msg:We arrived in the afternoon and were quickly checked in. We were delighted to receive a free upgrade and some gifts for the children.
The rooms were spacious, well kept and bright. We had a great view of the lake despite the rainy weather.
The children's play room was very impressive. There was hours of fun for the younger one, who visited every day of our stay. The staff were particularly kind and helpful. Kate and Huan were very helpful. They were super friendly and looked after our child well.
Breakfast and dinner was extensive. There was Chinese and Western options so everyone was pleased.
We would definitely stay again. Thank you to all staff for such a lovely stay.

msg:The hotel was newly opened last year. I bought a voucher for a deluxe twin room during an event. The price was very good.
The room was on the second floor, so there was no view of the lake. It was a bit noisy when the bus stopped below, but it didn't affect much.
The twin room was super big. It felt like 4 adults could stay there without any pressure. There were 2 air conditioners in the room, which was very comfortable.
The bathroom was Bulgari, which was still very high-end. The overall hardware facilities were very good (except that it was not only a toilet).
The hotel has a super large children's playground, comparable to Nelbao, with sand digging, trampolines, carousels, slides, supermarkets, climbing frames, etc. It is definitely the first choice for children. The children refused to come out in it, and the staff inside were very friendly. The carousel was open at a fixed time. If the children missed the time period, they could discuss with the staff. If there were other children who wanted to sit, they could accommodate them.
Because our room couldn't see the lake view, we went to the executive lounge on the 7th floor for afternoon tea. The taste was okay. There was an event on 618, the price was also very good, and the waiters were very good. We said we wanted to watch the sunset, and they enthusiastically told us that it would be better to go after 6pm. However, the sun set late that day, and we really didn't want to wait until 6:30, so we had to go for dinner. The breakfast variety was OK. Their homemade Qiandao Lake yogurt was very good. Although we went on a weekday, there were still many people at breakfast. We were given a small gift when we left the hotel. The housekeeper Xiaofen also provided good service and responded to every request. The downside was that they didn't contact me in advance. I didn't know that the water park was open, and I didn't bring a swimsuit and a swimming ring for the children. The hotel built such a large children's park, which must be the main focus of parent-child activities. In this regard, the supplies in the room can be improved. In addition to children's toothpaste, toothbrush, slippers and bathrobes, children's mouthwash cups, children's toilets, etc. are also recommended. If the number is limited, it is recommended to list them in the room in advance. If necessary, you can contact the front desk or the housekeeper, which is better. Overall, it is good and I will consider staying in the future. If you don't go to the attractions, it is a good place to lie flat and walk your baby for 2 days in the hotel.

The hotel has intelligent facilities and is also equipped with intelligent clothing care machines on the floor, which doubles the comfort of travel. The hotel has welcome fruits and snacks, as well as free cycling around the lake. The souvenirs at the end make people feel warm. There are many varieties of breakfast, and you can make your own milk tea and yogurt. Whether it is the front desk or the restaurant, guest room, gym, or lobby service, the housekeeper Xiaotian can provide thoughtful service and consultation before departure and after arrival. The excellent service makes people feel at home. There are 2 cruise ship terminals around the hotel. It is very convenient to go sightseeing on the island in a few minutes. The food in the hotel and surrounding restaurants such as "Chunzhiyu" is delicious. The surrounding shopping is convenient. It is a good place for relaxation and leisure. It is worth coming again and again.

msg:Impeccable, these four words are really a high evaluation, but I think it really lives up to the reputation, inside and out, it is really impeccable. On the night of check-in, I recommended it like crazy in the family group, because we all have children~ We took a taxi from the high-speed rail station. As soon as we arrived at the hotel gate, two waiters greeted us warmly. One opened the door for us, and the other asked if we had any luggage in the trunk. When they learned that there was, they took action immediately and pushed us all the way into the hotel to check in. The service staff at the front desk who checked in also explained the hotel activities and various directions in detail and were very patient. After that, they arranged for the staff to take our luggage all the way to the room. They were polite and patient throughout the whole process (because we brought children, we walked a little slower). The details of entering the room also won my heart, the fruit plate, the welcome message on TV, everyone brought it. We booked a deluxe sea view parent-child room. The small washbasin in the room is very friendly to children. The room is also quite large. The toiletries are all Bulgari, and I like the color of the bathtub very much. Let's talk about the hotel's recreational facilities. The children's playground is really big, comparable to Nai'erbao. The hygiene is also good. There are staff watching inside. There will be an hour of disinfection time between the morning and afternoon of the same day. There are also many activities. We stayed for three days and two nights and I think we can't play it all. The scenery of the hotel is also very good. The attitude of the service staff at each position is also very good. It is convenient to eat. If you don't want to eat in the hotel, there are many takeaway varieties. There are also several restaurants within a ten-minute walk. The taste is also good. If you drive here, there are too many restaurants within three kilometers nearby. The hotel breakfast variety is also very rich. Our only regret is that the hotel water park is not open. It will not open until July. But after my recommendation in the family group yesterday, I guess my brother and sister will drag me here again during the summer vacation. Hahaha, friends with children can close their eyes and enter! Butler Xiaotian also answers all questions and is very patient. The messages are all replied in seconds.

msg:Before coming to Qiandao Lake, I looked at almost all hotels. After checking in, I felt that I made the right choice. Because I was traveling with my kids and the elderly, it was not easy to choose a hotel that was convenient for dining, had complete facilities around, and had the right parent-child content. My kids were no longer toddlers, so I didn't choose Kaiyuan (plus Kaiyuan was a bit old).
This perfect experience at Minghao is absolutely inseparable from the hospitality of the housekeeper, Jane Dongdong~ From check-in to dining, all arrangements were very thoughtful.
Minghao is relatively new, so it is a small hotel in the center of Qiandao Lake, but it has done a good job of providing a feeling of almost one step at a time. From the doorman to the cleaning lady, they all took the initiative to smile and serve. In just three days and two nights, I was still not satisfied. I also found that the check-in for individual guests and the group are separate, so although I saw a group check-in at Minghao these two days, it did not affect our individual check-in experience at all, which is particularly good. Finally, a small detail, the hotel toothbrush is the best in recent years among all hotels, big and small, haha

Hygiene: The room is very clean and tidy, there is no dead corner of hygiene, and there is no unpleasant smell. The Armani green tea fragrance used in the hotel is very fresh. There are no visible stains on the bedding, seats, toilets, etc. And Bulgari's toiletries are really nice.

Intelligent, large shower water, and bathtub 🛁 bathing, the hotel has a constant temperature swimming pool and a children's playground on the first floor, and the children have a lot of fun. It is very convenient to order takeout at night, and the robot delivers it to the door of the room.
Service: When I checked in at the hotel, a waiter helped to send the luggage to the room, and added WeChat with the hotel lobby manager-David. He will inform various precautions, travel strategies, and various details. Such good service is really rare. There are rich breakfast varieties, go out to play, the hotel has free parking, free cycling, check-out and souvenirs, and the perfect trip is given by Minghao.

The baby also liked this auntie very much. Thank you very much to the restaurant manager! We went to eat twice during our stay in the hotel. The food was very tasty and large. The price of stream fish was similar to that of restaurants outside, and the price of beer was also similar. There was also group purchase, which was very cost-effective for many people. In addition, the housekeeper Xiao Ou was also enthusiastic in answering questions and replied to my message at 11 o'clock in the evening. Thank you very much! Environment: The environment of the hotel and the restaurant is one of the best. The baby can't get out of the children's playground after entering. It is too attractive for babies. The hygiene of the baby playground needs to be strengthened. There are small insects on the crawling mat. The hotel environment is beautiful. It would be great if there was a group purchase of a lake view room with a king bed. I hope the hotel can offer this group purchase. Come again next month!

msg:A parent-child hotel that is super suitable for traveling with children
First of all, the location is very good. Although it is not a sea view alone, it is only separated from the lake by a road, and there is no obstruction to the lake from the fourth floor and above. In addition, it is only a three- to five-minute walk from the famous Fish Street. There is everything you want to eat, and you don’t have to go to a distant place to eat.
The second is that the hotel has a good view. Whether you live on the side of the lake view room or not, there is a large platform where you can see the Qiandao Lake view you want to see at any time. You can move a chair and lay a yoga mat to enjoy the scenery comfortably. The inner courtyard of the hotel is also very large, with a nine-curve corridor and a fish pond. Children like to watch groups of fish wandering around, and there is also a small hill that is not too high.
The third is that the parent-child park is really big. On B1 of the hotel, one side is the video game area and the other side is the parent-child park. There are supermarket shopping areas, gas stations, police stations and other role-playing landscapes, as well as a huge trampoline area, ocean balls, sand digging, and surprisingly, there is also a cute pet area. The child stayed for four days and didn’t play all the projects.
The fourth is that the breakfast category is very complete. The breakfast meets the five-star standard, with both Chinese and Western food, and even a children's dining area - the cakes are made into cartoon shapes, equipped with handrails and ladders so that children can take their own meals, and there are enough children's plates and tableware.
The fifth is good butler service. Before arriving at the store, the butler Xiaozhe informed me of the check-in details one by one, and asked me if I needed help every day. The room where the children live specially helped to install the bed guard, and also arranged children's bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, etc., which is really considerate. Free shoe covers are also distributed at the entrance of the parent-child park, two pairs of adults and a child. The young ladies in the park also take good care of the children and pay attention to the safety of the children at all times. For example, Sister Xiao Huang and Sister Xiao Ling are very nice. The only drawback is that the hotel occupancy rate may be high recently, and the room service staff is too tight. There were two days when the room was cleaned late in the afternoon.
Suggestions on room selection. High floors are better than low floors. The lake view room faces Qiandao Lake without any obstruction; the inner lake view room can see the hotel courtyard, the music lake view fountain and water curtain movie at 7:30 every night. In fact, I highly recommend the inner lake view room with a better cost-effectiveness. First of all, it is cheap, and secondly, it is very convenient to watch water curtain movies. If there are children, generally speaking, this kind of dynamic picture can attract their attention more than the endless and calm Thousand Island Lake view.
Some suggestions: The hotel's bathtub and bath water are very good, you can bring your own bath bag to enjoy it. The price of the hotel's main meal is high, and the average price per person in the surrounding good restaurants is not more than 100. The foot massage shop downstairs is more favorable. Don't use the coupons given by the hotel directly, so as not to be a sucker, but my family said that the massage is average. If there is free cycling time, it is recommended to take advantage of the rules to ride around, the scenery is good.
Some shortcomings: The hotel receives many groups, and there are many people when you go to eat. The air conditioner blows directly on the bed, and the air conditioner baffle can be provided. The gym and swimming pool were not used at all. It was a pity that they were repaired during those days. Although the parent-child park is disinfected and cleaned three times a day, the ground is still very dirty. Looking forward to improvement.

msg:I have been to Qiandao Lake about three or four times. The last time was eight or nine years ago. At that time, there was no high-speed rail. You either drove for four or five hours or took a bus.

I stayed at Hilton Binjiang several times before, which was already very beautiful. I didn't expect to stay at Minghao this time. The waves beat the waves.

Minghao has been open for several years. Since its opening, it has actually been in my favorites. I have never had the opportunity to come. This time I finally got the chance to come. I was not disappointed and the experience was excellent.

First of all, I would like to praise the housekeeper Miss Dong (Jane Dong) this time. After adding WeChat the night before check-in, she sent me a detailed arrangement of the hotel's activities during the May Day holiday, as well as the hotel's restaurants and the opening schedule of various facilities. After communication, I found that we were with a young child, and they helped upgrade a very good room. The floor was high and the view was good. I asked the guest room to put the bed together and add a fence in advance. After arriving in the room, I found that the children's bathrobes, toothbrushes, slippers, etc. were prepared in advance. Throughout the three-day and two-night trip, the hotel staff showed very high professionalism. Whether it was the staff at the entrance of the children's playground, the cleaning lady, the big brother of the concierge depar**ent, and of course the front desk staff, they were all polite, enthusiastic and polite, with some professionalism and dedication that even higher-end hotels may not have. This made me admire the hotel owner very much for being able to manage this team so well.

The hotel has many advantages. To be honest, I used to be a hotel employee, and I really like to experience hotels of different styles around the world. I am also a frequent visitor to chain hotels such as Hilton and Marriott, but this hotel really impressed me because it was so sincere, not only in terms of facilities (a guest room has three washbasins, including a low platform for children and a sink with adjustable faucets), aesthetics (peacock green washbasin bathtub with golden bronze partition faucet, there is a water curtain show at night, and jade sculpture screens can be seen everywhere in the public areas of the lobby), service (take Miss Dong as an example, there was an emergency at home, and she did not forget to ask the guests if they were satisfied with their stay and what they needed at night), children's playground (3,000 square meters of playground, only in Pu I have seen similar-sized hotels with large amusement parks in the Borui in Dong and Shangri-La in Sanya, and there are even cute pet parks and indoor and outdoor swimming pools, so luxurious!), breakfast (I plan to write about breakfast separately, because breakfast is also one of the most abundant hotels I have seen. Although it does not provide very high-end ingredients, such as the whole plate of honeycomb provided by the W Hotel in Singapore, and coconuts can be taken at will in several major hotels in Hainan, but they cost hundreds of yuan per person), and finally the price (the price is really low, the group purchase price is only 600-700 yuan, and the whole package includes the room, breakfast, and one-hour bicycle rental. The minibar is not just a few bottles of juice, but beer, Evian, and nut chocolate, and it also includes unlimited children's playground and 50 coins). .

I hope Minghao can open a chain, of course, the quality should not decline, I can really recommend this hotel, the cost performance is really very very very high!

msg:I am a guest who has the honor to stay at the VIP Hotel recently. As soon as I arrived, Xiao Zheng from the hotel housekeeping depar**ent automatically added me on WeChat, and then he showed me his concern, which made me feel at home and very warm. In the following time, you always maintained a high level of professionalism and service enthusiasm, and provided me with thoughtful and meticulous service. Whether it is helping me solve accommodation problems or providing me with travel advice, you have demonstrated excellent professional ability and rich experience. Let me decide to extend my stay for another two days to make the trip more enjoyable and fulfilling. You do have a strong housekeeping team, which is worthy of praise.
I have been to Qiandao Lake many times, and I am sure that the high-area lake view room of this hotel is the ceiling for leisure and vacation. This time is the best choice for me. Sitting on the balcony every day to watch the lake and the sunset is as beautiful as watching the lake by boat. You can avoid the hard work of taking a boat, save the boat fare, and enjoy a feast in the restaurant downstairs.
The daily breakfast is also genuine, with rich varieties and perfect color, fragrance and taste. The only drawback is that the coffee machine is a bit slow and you have to queue for 10 minutes every time.
Of course, the Chinese restaurant Mingxuan Pavilion is also very good. The dishes are delicious, the ingredients are fresh, the dishes are exquisite, the portions are moderate, and the prices are reasonable, which fully meets the choice of middle-aged and elderly tourists.
Finally, I have to praise the staff team. In addition to the excellent housekeeping depar**ent, Aunt Hong, who serves the room on the 7th floor, is also very good and careful. The waiters at the front desk and the security guards at the door are proactive and enthusiastic with a smile on their faces. It fully meets the 5-star standard.
I believe that with your efforts, Minghao International will definitely become the first choice for more guests.

Although there was a little incident when checking in, the front desk manager solved it in seconds, and gave us 4 rooms with delayed check-out, gave us many small gifts, and upgraded the room. The room facilities are new and large. I like it and will stay there again next time I have the chance.

The Minghao Hotel I stayed in has a superior location, and it is very convenient for eating, drinking and playing, which is much more convenient than the InterContinental. The hotel has a large children's playground, and my baby likes it very much and goes there several times a day. Thank you to the housekeeper Leo Xiaofei, who has a great service attitude and helped to negotiate the upgrade of the room type, making our stay very comfortable these days. I recommend it to my friends. It is very suitable for parent-child travel.

msg:Guests who had no choice but to change rooms three times in two nights will share their experiences.
I arrived at the hotel early on the morning of May 3rd. I had booked an ordinary deluxe double room. As soon as I opened the door, I saw a huge glass dome standing very close to the outside of the balcony glass. It felt very depressing. I contacted the front desk and was told There is only a 108-degree lake view room, and the price difference is double that of a lake view room. Considering that we will not be in the room for long and will leave home at 6 or 7 in the morning the day after tomorrow, the price/performance ratio is not high, so I contacted the housekeeper and asked if there would be one in the afternoon. As a guest who canceled his reservation, we paid extra to upgrade to a lake view room. After putting down our luggage, we went out for a lake tour. When we returned to the room in the evening, we discovered a big bug. As soon as the bathroom light was turned on, the exhaust fan would automatically turn on (we couldn’t help it yet). Turn it off separately), the sound of the exhaust fan sounded like decoration construction (I recorded the video below), my husband used the tuba in the bathroom for 20 minutes and we listened to the noise for 20 minutes. It was already past 7pm. Considering that upgrading to a 108-degree room for two nights at this time is equivalent to losing the value of one night, because it is already dark outside and there is no view at all. I sent a video of the noise situation to the housekeeper and asked if I could upgrade to 108 degrees for the price of one night. I was told that there was a regular lake view room, and then I still had to upgrade at the normal price difference of two nights, even though I knew that this would be equivalent to losing a day. The lake view was valuable, but I immediately agreed. I just wanted to quickly escape from this depressing and noisy room with a ball view. After being taken to the upgraded lake view room No. 8565, I found that the actual area was smaller than the noisy room with ball view. Because the area was so small, there was no room to put the sofa, so it was placed in the aisle between the window and the TV (No. I once saw a hotel sofa placed under the TV), but I thought it would be better than the one downstairs, so I packed up and moved it up. As a result, the classic is here. Not to mention the poor sound insulation of the balcony sliding door, because the street is right at the entrance of a bridge. Every time a car passes by, you can clearly hear the sound of the car accelerating away. This is We endured it, but at 5 a.m. we were woken up by inexplicable continuous noises. For example, the exhaust fan of the downstairs ball-view room continued to make noises in the room through the door, because the child was sleeping soundly and did not want to wake her up. , I endured it until 7 o'clock in the morning when I heard the voices of two housekeeping aunts at the door, and quickly pulled them in to listen to what was going on. After hearing this, the aunt immediately said to help me find the leader for feedback, but it was not until we finished breakfast at 8:45 I ran to the front desk to find the lobby manager and was told that he had heard about our situation early in the morning, but he was too busy and had no time to deal with us. He also pointed to the guests next to him and said that he had very urgent matters to deal with now. , but what’s interesting is that the guest next to me said, “It’s okay, you go first, my people haven’t arrived yet”, but the lobby manager still acted very impatient and asked us to take our children to the children’s playground downstairs first. (The items included in our package were not provided by the hotel), and they said they would come to us later. Until the housekeeper contacted us at noon when he went to work, the lobby manager never showed up again. The solution given by the housekeeper (probably also the boss’s instruction) was to exempt us from the price difference for one night that we had to pay for the “Unlucky Dark Lake View Room” we moved into last night, and also gave us a sample set of off-brand toiletries (as shown below). Pictured, the manufacturer is called Zhuhai Jenny Cai Cosmetics Co., Ltd. 😂) Then they changed us to a room, and the price difference was still charged. It wasn’t until about one o’clock in the afternoon that we finally settled into a normal room, but unfortunately it kept raining. , we set off at around six o'clock the next morning. In this way, we packed our bags three times in two nights and slept for one and a half nights. However, because it was my husband's birthday to check in, he was given a 6-inch cake as a gift. The quality of the cake was impressive. The security in the underground garage and at the hotel entrance were also very enthusiastic, and the housekeeper was also polite. But the hotel itself still has a lot of flaws, such as the faucet and basin in the room leaking, I don’t know how many rounds of toiletries were canned repeatedly, half-person breakfast packed in advance after leaving early, etc.

msg:A satisfactory arrangement for my daughter's May Day trip. After the Spring Festival, I started looking for a hotel and saw Minghao right away. Because I hesitated, the group purchase package could not be booked during the May Day holiday. So I looked at all the hotels near Qiandao Lake again, and still believed in my first impression. I booked two rooms with lake views. My family of seven, including the elderly and children, just stayed. The hotel service is really good. During the holiday, the lady's flowers and children's toys were sent. The butler added my WeChat very early and helped to upgrade the room. So David, the butler for food, drink and play, provided a detailed introduction and gave a lot of suggestions. I was very satisfied. The room is really good, clean, spacious, and has a big lake view. This is the feeling of a vacation. Sitting on the big balcony, the lake view opposite is cozy. The toiletries are Bulgari, and I like the taste very much. The hotel is in a good location, close to the pier and Fish Street, very convenient. There are also bicycle rentals at the door of the hotel, but it is recommended to rent a car from the nearby rental company, which is cheaper. There is a Starbucks franchise in the lobby on the first floor. My daughter bought an ice chocolate, which is said to taste average. There are many types of breakfast. With breakfast coffee, Starbucks is not needed. The coffee in the buffet, as well as thick coconut milk, ice sucking syrup, brown sugar syrup, homemade hot and cold coffee, are great. Homemade yogurt tastes good too. I tried the seafood buffet for dinner. It cost more than 200 yuan per person. It's ok to eat casually. There are still many types. I have said these in bits and pieces. The overall evaluation is very good. If I go to Qiandao Lake again, I should choose it again.

The only drawback is that the bathroom in the parent-child room is not soundproof, and it is impossible to wash quietly after the child goes to bed. It would be better to improve it and make a soundproof shower room.

There are many types of breakfast, and the plates are all hot. What is rare is that they are willing to provide coffee cups. You can take a cup of coffee out after breakfast, which is great.
Talking about the shortcomings, I booked a loft, and there is no curtain in the upstairs room, which is a bit embarrassing. There is no clothes hanger in the bathroom, which is not very convenient to put on clothes after taking a shower. The water pressure of the shower head is very strong, which is suitable for adults, but it is a bit too big for children, and it cannot be adjusted. In addition, the hotel swimming pool is at least 1.2 meters shallow, which is a bit deep for children.

msg:Finally checked into the popular hotel. No matter what others say, your own feelings are the most important! We stayed in the loft courtyard family room. It was spacious for three adults and two children. It was a little regretful that we didn't get the slide room. The sanitation was timely and clean. On the first day of arrival, the room was being cleaned, so I went to the Chinese restaurant of the hotel and had fish soup. It was delicious. Even the baby who didn't like fish drank three bowls and tasted the fish. The service was too enthusiastic. The butler-style service made people feel cared and warm everywhere. Here I especially like the butler Xiaodong, who sent a lot of services and thought of places that guests couldn't think of. The service was thoughtful and enthusiastic. The buffet restaurant in the evening has a rich variety and is super value. The baby played in the children's playground for three consecutive days, gave socks, and went to play again after checking out. The waiter Xiaoling checked the situation and let the children in. Thank you! The three-day and two-night trip to Qiandao Lake was perfect.

The housekeeper Xiaofen contacted me one day in advance and asked me to prepare in advance. I was very opposed to loft rooms. Most of the rooms of this type in many hotels I have stayed in are not good, but this one does not seem cramped at all, and the two large beds are reasonably laid out. The separate small courtyard faces the inner lake, and you can watch the fountain and water curtain movie at the door at night. The room is very clean and equipped with a dehumidifier. The hotel's breakfast is very good, and the buffet in the evening is also very cost-effective! The children fell in love with the playground, and the staff were very enthusiastic and basically helped me take care of the children.
What I am most satisfied with the hotel is the service, which is basically responsive. I booked a room on two platforms and had to change rooms once in the middle. The hotel handled it very smoothly, and there was a little brother to help me move my luggage. Although the weather was bad and it rained, the whole family agreed that it was good to stay at the hotel, lounge in the yard to see the scenery, walk around the hotel to participate in activities, and play in the playground.

Unfortunately, the schedule was rushed and I didn't have time to experience it. I'll leave it for next time. My parents were very satisfied.

The housekeeper Xiaofen arranged it very well this time. She added her WeChat account half a month in advance and asked us what our room requirements were. When we arrived, we were very satisfied with the location of the room. It had a first-class lake view and the two beds were big enough for two large rooms. Just in time for a nap.

It is super beautiful to go out and take pictures of the sunset at the hotel entrance. It is important to mention that the service is a one-to-one butler service. Butler Xiao Wang contacted me one day in advance and confirmed the arrival time and needs one by one. In the evening, he also specially prepared white fungus soup and desserts, and finally there were souvenirs. Come to Qiandao Lake to experience the beautiful scenery and the hotel. The hotel has a great view and location, and the toiletries are all Bulgari. Butler Xiao Wang is also really super. I hope the hotel will give such butlers more opportunities and keep the quality service. I will definitely choose here next time I go to Qiandao Lake.

The security guards at the gate and underground are very good. Others are normal.
(ps: underground parking can be directly accessed, very convenient)
Relaxing alone. When I booked, there were only twin rooms. Fortunately, there was a big bed, which was not affected. After booking, three people called to ask what time to check in. I feel that the internal management is a bit chaotic. Overall, I can't find any faults. The cost performance of 1300 is not high.

The terrace is very large. It is a pity that the wall is too high, blocking part of the lake view. Another suggestion is to add some seafood, shrimp and the like to the dishes. This trip to Qiandao Lake is generally satisfactory. I went to Tianyu Mountain and Beer Town. The Internet celebrity lighthouse is very filmy. The weather forecast said it would rain for two days, but it didn't rain at all. It was very lucky.

Manager Lu also introduced the hotel’s cost-effective ocean buffet on weekend nights. After we made the reservation, Manager Lu immediately booked our dining seats.
      Qiandao Lake Minghao International Resort Hotel is located on the edge of the central lake area of ​​Qiandao Lake tourist attraction, facing Qiandao Lake with beautiful scenery. ． . The hotel is clean and the staff is hospitable. The breakfast snacks are very rich and there are a variety of fruits.

I originally wanted to choose some old hotel, but after looking at the photos, it looked really old. This hotel was built not long ago. Everyone chooses it!

Originally there were only 2 breakfasts, but Xu Liqin, the foreman at the restaurant, saw that my parents were old and gave us an extra breakfast.

Moreover, the hotel’s Western restaurant has rich breakfast with various varieties and a good environment. The waiters are very enthusiastic. Xu Liqin was very helpful and introduced local specialties to my parents. They were very satisfied [strong]

Personal butler Xiaotian met all my requirements, including a room on a high floor and in the middle of the lake, and kept asking me if I needed anything. The snacks in the mini bar are also provided to us for free.

This experience is really good. There is a fish street next to the hotel and there are various restaurants to choose from (although which one is authentic is a matter of opinion)
There are also small gifts given before leaving. You can really choose with confidence. It’s great to just sit in the hotel and relax facing the lake. You can also drink tea and watch the sunset in the evening.

The security guard will help you to open the door. The front desk service can help you with your luggage. The hotel buffet is cost-effective and the taste is okay. The taste of fruit is average. There are too many guests for breakfast and it is a bit awkward to queue up for a seat. The children's play area is quite good. Children like it very much. The hotel has a swimming pool and gym, but the outdoor swimming area is not big. They also gave a souvenir after leaving the hotel. It is a very good family hotel.

msg:A very good weekend vacation experience. First of all, I would like to thank the front desk lady who answered my call early in the morning. I asked a few questions about the itinerary and she responded to me very clearly, which made me feel the standardization of this hotel's management. Placed the order without hesitation. After checking into the hotel, I was not disappointed. I paid more attention to the details of the hotel, such as hotel supplies, bedding, breakfast, the freshness of the fruit plate, and whether the lake view room I requested was consistent with the description (it was actually better than the photos) ), and we would also like to thank our butler Dawei, who gave us guidance and suggestions from the beginning, as well as reminders about eating, drinking and entertainment, as well as our small requirements for our stay. Our sophomore in high school said this weekend was quite enjoyable.

When you arrive at the hotel, there will be a waiter to carry your luggage and everything will be arranged for you! The service aspect is great!
I chose their home mainly because of their parent-child amusement park, which is large, clean and tidy, and a great place to walk your kids! If you go there in the morning, there will be fewer friends and it will be more comfortable to play!
They also have a water curtain show, and the housekeeper specially arranged a suitable room for us. When the show starts at 7:30 in the evening, we only need to sit on the balcony to watch it, which is very good!
The breakfast buffet is also quite rich, and there are also local specialties to try! There are many restaurants around the hotel, and travel is convenient!

  Room service is on call and your reasonable requests will be met in a timely manner. Butler Xiao Dong has excellent service. He communicated our room requirements in advance, carefully and patiently understood my needs. He is very kind and really helpful. Feel free to ask questions, feel free to answer. He also personally sent us upstairs to check in.
  Regarding service, everyone in the hotel takes it very seriously. To go to other floors in the hotel, you need to use the elevator card to swipe the floor. As a result, my friend can't get up to the one downstairs, and I can't get off the one upstairs. If I want to go , I need to go to the first floor to find help. (Will I be able to access 2 floors with one card in the future?) However, when I met the room service guy, he proactively discovered that I needed help in a timely manner and helped me check the elevator floor. He took the initiative to care about me. , and took the initiative to help solve the problem. I have not experienced this in other hotels, and it is still fresh in my memory.
  The breakfast at the hotel is the best breakfast I have ever had. Not only are there many varieties, but they also taste great. For example, those leek pancakes and radish pancakes are not pre-made products. They are made and fried on site, so the taste is natural. Very good, Huainan beef soup, I drank 3 bowls of clear soup in one go, and the large floor-to-ceiling glass windows in the dining area are quite beautiful, with small bridges, pavilions, and transparent fish ponds. While sitting and dining, You can enjoy such beautiful scenery and start the day in a good mood.
  On the ba*****t floor of the hotel, there is a large swimming pool and a gym. There are 2 table tennis tables at the door. Further inside, there is a children's playground of more than 3,000 square meters. Entry is free by swiping the room card, and non-slip socks are provided. The playground There is actually a small animal viewing area at the end of the park, and I can't help but wonder what's in it. Opposite the amu*****t park is the game machine room and go-kart driving. In the words of my daughter, it is so fun here that I don’t have enough time to play in a hurry.
  The location of the hotel is also very good. Just across the road when you go out is Fish Street, which is full of restaurants. There are many choices and they don't rip off customers. It only takes 3 kilometers to take a taxi to the pier, and you can get to the pier with the starting fee, which is very convenient.
  There is a dessert takeaway near the hotel that is delicious. When you order takeout at the hotel, it is delivered upstairs by a robot, which is very smart.
   To sum up, the hotel hardware (facilities) and software (services) are excellent, and the location is very good. I will definitely stay at Minghao next time I go to Qiandao Lake, and Xiaodong will welcome me.

The amusement park is on B1, and the passage leading to the amusement park is quite interestingly designed. The amusement park has rich items, and there is also a cute pet park where you can observe small animals, including chinchillas, hedgehogs and parrots.

Thank you to the housekeeper Xiaofen for your thoughtful daily reminders during your stay. If you have any questions, please contact Xiaofen for quick response and answer all questions.

The overall stay experience for three days and two nights was not bad. I have a suggestion: the quality of the toys given to children when checking in needs to be improved and they need to match the hotel's positioning.

msg:The room is very comfortable, especially suitable for parents and children, because there is a large amusement park where children can play for a while every day. There is also a heated swimming pool where you can swim twice a day, and a place where you can feed koi fish every day. If you want to check in, there are also cycling, mountain climbing, light and shadow shows, etc. It is very interesting. The fish head soup in the hotel is very delicious. Special thanks to the butler Xiao Zheng for the special fish head coupons and the timely and enthusiastic service throughout the whole process. Children are welcome.

First of all, when they heard that we were 3 adults and 1 child, they upgraded the room type for us and also helped us. We applied for the corresponding number of breakfast portions, which was super considerate♥️. We stayed in a lake view king room, with two 1.8cm king beds, and a great view. Although the cleaning depar**ent and the front desk may not have the correct information when we arrived, they were being cleaned, so we didn’t mind too much. The cleaning lady The people are very nice and solved the cleaning problem for us in a timely manner.
Children like to swim.

She also taught our children how to swim, especially likes. She doesn’t even have a name. tell us……
It is worth mentioning that the hotel's service is excellent, from getting off the bus, being warmly greeted by the security guard at the door, taking the initiative to carry luggage, to checking in with the beautiful lady. It can be seen that the hotel owner likes jade items very much. They are all low-key luxury. The most eye-catching thing is the Jiuqu White Jade Bridge outside the hotel. After walking past it, you will see the Huaguo Mountain. It is so thoughtful! It is very suitable for bringing the elderly and children. You don’t have to go anywhere. An in-depth tour of the hotel is enough for you~

I feel that Minghao International should be a local hotel that can be on par with InterContinental. The hotel is in a good location. It is very convenient to go out to eat. The hotel's parent-child facilities are also very good and complete. !
This time I am very grateful to my personal butler Xiao Zheng, who helped me upgrade to an executive lake view twin room for free. From the location of the room, I can see the beautiful view of Qiandao Lake! The supplies in the room are also from Bvlgari, which is great😎

The robot is sent to the door of the room. Looking at the lake view, it is beautiful. The room area is so large. The two of them and I have a very generous living, and the decoration is also very new. The room faces the lake, the scenery is pleasant, and the baths are all Bulgari. There is still a gift to leave. In short, the children are very happy. The swimming pool is 1.2-1.3 meters. When we go to swimming, we are basically a charter, haha. The playground by the lake is suitable for low young children, and big children above 1.4 are no longer interested, but babies will definitely be crazy ... Meng pet park sees many hedgehogs, birds, small pheasants, Totoro and gold silk Bear, baby likes it, these are all good places to liberate parents. The observation deck on the corridor is too good to watch the sunset. The hotel has enough to play in the past two days. We did not go out to the island to play. The children did not feel boring and were very casual. There are children's meals for buffet breakfast. Baby likes, we basically don't want to eat at noon. Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Ou, for helping me apply for a delay check -up, seamlessly connecting with the subsequent schedule, the overall service is very good. Bye, come again later.

My family took a fancy to this hotel, and when they arrived, they found it to be really good. The hotel was very luxurious, the facilities were very new, and the bath liquids were all from Bvlgari. Secondly, the location is also very good, facing Qiandao Lake. The terrace lake view room we booked was upgraded to a deluxe lake view room because it was the off-season of Qiandao Lake. Although the area was smaller, the floor was higher and the view of Qiandao Lake from the balcony was even better.
The hotel's breakfast buffet is also good. There are many choices and the taste is good. Children like it very much.
The hotel also has scheduled water curtain shows and cycling activities, you can also consider participating.
Finally, the housekeeper Xiao Ou was very enthusiastic, because both of our families have children, and he asked a lot of children’s needs, and he tried his best to help meet them. I need to give him a thumbs up 👍!

One Aunt Yu took the children to their seats and the other guided the children to the snack area to assist in getting meals. They really cared about the children and the housekeeper Xiao Zheng answered all questions and provided solutions in a timely manner. Scenic spot tour tickets I also booked the hotel's full set of toiletries through Zhang Xuan, a staff member in the lobby tourist area. The hair dryer is from Bulgari and the airfly caviar hair dryer. Don't forget to install the essence ring. I will stay at this hotel again next time I come to Qiandao Lake.

When traveling as a family of three, I usually like to book newly opened hotels, and I am a bit of a germophobe and am a bit picky about hygiene and bedding. After comparing for a long time, I chose Minghao International. The two-night stay was a great experience. Before I checked in, the housekeeper Dawei contacted me and upgraded the room from a lake view to a 108-degree lake view. It was so comfortable for my children to sit on the balcony and watch Qiandao Lake. During the stay, Dawei paid special attention to the guest's stay experience. When leaving the hotel, he sent me a WeChat message to ask about my stay, which made me feel at home. The hotel's breakfast buffet is also complete in variety and caters to children's tastes. The hotel's hardware facilities are attentive, and the bathrooms, bedding, book bar, and swimming pool are all complete. There is also a children's city swimming pool, which takes care of parent-child travel.

The room has a direct view of Qiandao Lake and is well-equipped with facilities. The bathtub and children's sink are my favorite retro green color, and the toiletries are all Bulgari, which is super easy to use!
Of course, the favorite for parent-child tours is the 3,000-square-meter children's city, which is really suitable for parents and children to walk with their children!
Just go for this "There is a paradise by the lake"🎠
It is worth coming to Qiandao Lake Minghao again❗️
 Especially families with two children
It’s so fun to walk with your baby❗️
A great place to eat after dinner🛝
Cross-dressing, grocery shopping, games, climbing, sand digging, trampoline, movie 🎬Merry-go-round
The child refused to go back to the room after playing [Lol]
Of course, there is also the outdoor Jiuqu Bridge, which contains many koi. Children can feed the fish and interact with them, which is very fun.

The hotel's service is the best I have experienced when traveling and staying in recent years.

In particular, the housekeeper Xiaotian was very professional. He contacted us about the check-in one day in advance and gave us a free upgrade to the invincible lake view room. During the two days of our stay, he not only asked about the accommodation experience, but also enthusiastically helped provide the necessary items, so the family had a great stay during these two days. Comfortable.
Huang Xiuying from the children's play area is also very enthusiastic and eager to help the children with the play facilities. When the child had a nosebleed, she promptly and enthusiastically dealt with it and asked about the child's condition afterwards.
Overall, I felt very good staying at this hotel for two days, and it felt like it was a hotel run with care.
I will choose it again when I visit again in the future.

msg:In a newly opened hotel, I stayed in a room facing the inner lake. It was very spacious and comfortable. It faced the water curtain show at night and I could enjoy it from the balcony. The hotel is five minutes away from Fish Street. That street is full of fish eaters, which is very convenient. The butler Xiao Ou greets you every day, provides warm and thoughtful service, and responds to any inquiries in a timely manner, which is great

msg:It was my first time to go to Qiandao Lake. I brought my husband, children and parents together and booked two rooms in Minghao, one for parents and children with lake view, and one with king bed for lake view. Both rooms are very good, and the balcony for parents and children is larger. On the way, the housekeeper Xiaotian contacted us on WeChat. Although he didn't contact us one day in advance as everyone said, he was still in time and everything that needed to be arranged was arranged for me! Xiaotian said that the last time they call is 21:00, so they don’t have to make a day in advance. In fact, it doesn’t matter as long as they get in touch and make arrangements! The children who were super looking forward to the playground also had a lot of fun, but its area is not a large area, it is a corridor type, with one corridor to the end, so it doesn't seem that great, but for a 3-year-old child Everything you need is already there. Those who are older may get bored and need to go to the nearby amu*****t park to play at their own expense! The child was bitten several times while playing in the playground. The biggest one was on his arm. After reacting to the housekeeper, he said that the disinfection would be in place and he gave me fruits. All he had to do was to do a good job of hygiene. The service was very considerate. At 7.15pm There is a fountain in the lobby, and there is a so-called curtain movie at the entrance of the hotel at 7:30. Of course, we Shanghainese people will not find it good-looking if we go there. There are too many musical fountains at the entrance to the Aegean Sea, but the overall experience of this hotel is still very good! The service is in place and the breakfast is rich. The balcony of the lake view room is really super comfortable. You don’t have to leave the hotel and you can enjoy the fun of vacation in the hotel. It is a hotel that you can buy twice if you have a group purchase hahahaha! It is worth mentioning that the corners of the room were very clean. I took a special look and found that the room was very clean. There was no dust in the corners. I hope the playground will be cleaner.

msg:This Christmas, I booked the very popular 🔥 Christmas dinner at Qiandao Lake Minghao International Hotel in advance. The 2-day and 1-night trip was well arranged in the hotel. I had enough to eat and have fun. It was like a lying-down baby-walking ceiling in Qiandao Lake. Got it!

🎄About Christmas dinner:
From Santa Claus and cello playing in front of the igloo to welcome guests, to Christmas decorations and band performances everywhere, every detail exudes warmth and joy! The meal can be said to be a true experience of the No. 1 buffet in Qiandao Lake. Sashimi, Roche shrimp, abalone, snow crab legs, Pipa shrimp... The steaming hot pot is cooked in a festive atmosphere🆙There are also Buddha jumping over the wall, garlic oysters, Christmas turkey ...The styles are so rich that I can’t eat them all🤣Fruit mangosteen, strawberry, pineapple, jackfruit come in turns, as well as exquisite desserts for children. It is said that it is a five-star ⭐️taste bud feast. In short, it is the highest level of buffet - holding on to the wall I did it
	
🏨About room service:
We booked a deluxe twin room with lake view, extra large bed + small bed, Kingkoil neck mattress, children's washbasin, large bathtub, Bvlgari toiletries, AIRFLY caviar hair dryer (very disgusting) , all are light luxury lines, focusing on a "super five-star" configuration
The private terrace has a first-line lake view + stunning sunset. Teammates lamented that this is the correct way to check in to Qiandao Lake.
	
🍽️About eating:
The standard buffet breakfast🈶more than 200 dishes, the taste is online, especially the vermicelli soup and local specialties👍🏻, there is also a children's area, very attentive
	
🎠About playing:
￼What surprised me the most throughout the whole journey was the hotel’s parent-child paradise. I would like to call it the “Nairbao” of Qiandao Lake❗️It has a total area of ​​3,000 square meters, and it is fully soft-packed and clean.
￼ Fish watching at Jiuqu Yubai Bridge: feeding koi in a small and beautiful Chinese garden
￼Walking on Huaguo Mountain: running and jumping on the hillside scattered with small animals
￼Cycling: I want to ride citycycle internet celebrity family bicycles for free
￼Boating: Exclusive access to the large inner lake, where you can experience kayaking and yachting🉑
￼Water Curtain Movie: The show on Neihu Lake every night, don’t miss it
￼Water curtain light and shadow: combined with the satin-like light ***** in the hotel lobby, it is beautiful

This is the ideal vacation life for a family of three, right?

msg:It takes half an hour to take a taxi to the hotel after getting off the high-speed rail Qiandao Lake Station. Check-in is easy and we also get a free upgrade to a 108-degree supreme ocean view room. The balcony view is great! After putting down the luggage, the baby couldn't wait to feed the koi at the white jade Jiuqu Bridge at the hotel entrance. I made a guide in advance and brought half a catty of fish food. Then I went straight to the hotel B1. There is a park by the lake with slides, trampolines, etc. suitable for children. Projects for 1-year-old babies to play until they are so happy! (There are paid projects such as kart real-person CS and other projects next to it.) Kate Huang Xiuying, a staff member in the park, loves her job, is dedicated to her service, treats children enthusiastically, and is patient and worthy of praise! Next to the park is the gym and swimming pool, which is great! The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety. When you enter the restaurant, the staff will help arrange seats and bring baby chairs, bibs, tableware, etc. I especially commend Angie Zhou Hengxia, a waiter in the Western restaurant on the 1st floor, for being enthusiastic and patient with babies, tidying up the table in time, and a pleasant dining experience! After staying for two nights, I contacted the micro-housekeeper Xiao Ou to ask if I could delay my check-out. I readily agreed that I could delay my check-out from 11:00 to 2 p.m. at the latest. Great! After check-out, the front desk of the hotel also provides souvenirs of sparkling water and fragrance! The overall stay experience was great! Will recommend to friends! !

The butler Xiaotian has very good service. He will ask about the accommodation situation and help solve problems. I like the bathtub in the room. After a day of playing, it is very comfortable to take a bath. When checking out, I was given a souvenir, local oranges. Originally, the package also included a one-hour bicycle ride on the first day, but it was too cold and windy that day so I didn’t ride. Will come again next time if I have a chance😊

msg:It was my first time to come to Qiandao Lake and I chose a half-day hotel. I chose this one and it really exceeded my expectations. All the hotel's facilities are very high-end and classy. From the overall environment, room layout, decoration, equipment furnishings, to all kinds of small details, they are very attentive. The overall style of the hotel is a combination of Chinese and Western styles, luxurious and charming, high-end yet comfortable. The view from the Deluxe Lake View Room is stunning and relaxing. The whole family likes the small garden of the hotel. The white marble stone bridge and railings are exquisitely carved, and the koi carp swim freely in the water. The scenery is unique.
My butler, Mr. Dawei, was warm and thoughtful. He contacted me one day in advance and patiently informed me of various matters. After check-in, he also provided us with various considerate services and suggestions.
Hong Xia from the Recreation and Sports Depar**ent is also very enthusiastic. The children had a great time in the Recreation and Sports Depar**ent.
The hotel has convenient transportation and is adjacent to Fish Street, so dining is very convenient. The Chunyuanwai restaurant outside the hotel has a good environment and good food.
After staying for two nights, I really couldn't bear to leave, so I changed to the H Hotel for the last two nights (I am also a global member). But I really feel that I still prefer the stay experience in Minghao. Will definitely come again!

msg:This store must have a 5-star rating
First of all, the hardware facilities are amazing: a beautiful 108-degree viewing platform, where you can watch the sunset 🌄 without having to go to other mountains to see it, and the sea view is even more beautiful;
The room has a fully automatic toilet 🚽, a Dyson hairdryer, a large bathtub, a humanized shower room, a sink specially suitable for children (although I don’t have children 😄), and particularly comfortable Jinkoer mattresses and bedding..., There is also an executive corridor on the 7th floor, where you can enjoy afternoon tea while enjoying the lake view, which is not too comfortable;
The breakfast is extremely rich, and I heard that their buffet dinner is also very good. I just go out to play every day and can't keep up with the meal. It's a pity that I will leave it for this time;
The lobby is also very beautiful, especially when the water curtain lights and shadows begin, it is truly magnificent;
There is a water screen movie outside the lobby every night, so you can take a walk out and watch it after dinner;
By the way, the Jiuqu White Jade Bridge outside the hotel is very beautiful, and there are many and big fish inside. I really saw the largest koi in my life.
Let’s talk about software services~ Ms. Dong Feiying’s service is very touching and can be said to be meticulous. One day, the room was cleaned late. When Xiao Dong found out, he went to the scene in person to urge the aunt to clean it quickly, and then gave us afternoon tea. I apologize; the aunt made the bed for us with great care, which made us an old couple feel embarrassed😄;
When we finally checked out, Xiaodong also gave us a souvenir. While we were waiting at the airport, we were able to taste the specialty of Qiandao Lake ~ Button Orange😄
The hotel was very welcoming from the front door to the security staff. They opened the door to carry our luggage and told us the tour route...they took the trouble to answer all our questions.
In short, I stayed in a lot of five-star hotels, and I was really moved by Minghao in Qiandao Lake.
If you come to Qiandao Lake again, you must choose this place.
I wish this store a prosperous business and abundant financial resources💗

The hotel's children's playground is 3,000 square meters, which should be the largest in the Qiandao Lake Hotel. In the executive lounge on the 7th floor, you can have afternoon tea and watch the sunset. The water curtain light and shadow in the lobby and the musical fountain water curtain movie are quite shocking. The room accessories are all from Bulgari. Very good experience.

msg:As soon as I entered the door, I was attracted by the scenery outside the balcony. The children screamed with excitement. It felt like they could take in the beautiful scenery of Qiandao Lake without leaving the hotel. It is definitely the most family-friendly hotel in Qiandao Lake. It has a children's playground of more than 3,000 square meters. There is also a water curtain movie in the evening, and there are water curtain lights and shadows in the hotel lobby, so the children can enjoy it. It is worth mentioning that the restaurant in the hotel is very delicious. We had dinner at the hotel for both days. I ordered the braised Qiandao Lake fish head, which was so delicious, and the other dishes were not inferior to those in other restaurants. Praise. The koi in the hotel are really big and scary, which is an eye-opener. Finally, I would like to praise the butler Xiao Wang. He was very enthusiastic in introducing delicious and fun attractions around him from the time he checked in. He also thoughtfully gave toys to the children. He greeted us every day about the day's itinerary and helped us arrange our play time reasonably. Because we were in a hurry, I thought We were unable to enjoy the afternoon tea provided by the hotel. Unexpectedly, Xiao Wang packed the afternoon tea for us to take away when we checked out. What a surprise. The service was really heartwarming. All in all, whenever I come to Qiandao Lake in the future, I will definitely stick to Minghao.

Arrange a spa in the evening to eliminate the fatigue of the day. The free items included in the booking package are very cost-effective! The hotel's heated indoor swimming pool is fully equipped and impeccable! The daily buffet breakfast has many varieties and tastes great! The trip to Qiandao Lake ended perfectly and was unforgettable. Thank you to all the staff at Minghao International.

This trip coincided with two birthdays, so we made two consecutive reservations. In the room, Xiao Zheng carefully arranged birthday cakes for us every day and asked the guest room to decorate the birthday room. Aunt Wang who cleans the guest room (if I remember correctly) is also very serious and responsible. The hotel has complete facilities, and children can have fun in the amu*****t park and indoor swimming pool. There is an administrator in the swimming pool, Hong Xia, who also takes special care of the children's swimming. She stays with the children throughout the swimming process. Thank you very much. There is a fish street around the hotel, which is very convenient for eating. I was very satisfied with this trip and the children said they wanted to come again.

It was my wife's birthday during the stay. , helped with the decoration in advance and applied for the cake.

There are water lilies in the center of the lobby, and it is a lake view hotel in the center. The hotel also has an inner lake. There are musical fountains and water screen movies at night. During the three days of stay, there were no problems with customer service and hygiene. On weekends The buffet is also worth having, with many varieties. Thanks again to the hotel housekeeper, Lu Xianzhi, for his service. If I have the opportunity to come to Qiandao Lake again, I will choose Minghao again.

I also gave my child a magical toy. The room is spacious and bright, and the bathtub is very big. My son clamors to take a bath every night. The housekeeper Xiao Zheng is responsible and responsive, and the toothbrushes and slippers needed for the children after check-in are also delivered as soon as possible. There is a large children's playground on the first floor of the hotel. I took my children there on the day I checked in. When I went there the next day, I saw that the props and costumes the children had played with the day before were missing. I asked a worker whose work badge said Huang Xiuying. The eldest sister said that she took it to wash. She felt that the children's health and safety were taken seriously here. The eldest sister was also smiling and very friendly to the children. There are many and big Baiyuqiao koi in front of the hotel, which is a better experience than going to West Lake Huagang to watch fish. Finally, I would like to mention that there is a lady in the hotel lobby who is responsible for purchasing tourist attraction items. After comparison, I found that the discounts for hotel guests are indeed greater than those for purchases on the platform and attractions. I bought Moonlight Love and took a boat to the island. The next day after seeing the light show, I also bought a go-kart in Beer Town through WeChat. The experience was good. I felt that the lady was very professional and very patient. The front desk also gave a bag of local specialty oranges as a gift when leaving the store. Generally speaking, Minghao's software and hardware are complete, and the staff are well-trained. It is very suitable for family travel. I will most likely choose to stay in Minghao next time I come to Qiandao Lake.

The children played in the big orchard in front of the hotel for most of the afternoon! The professional butler service is still so considerate. Special thanks to Butler Lu Xianzhi👍👍👍. Seeing that we had an extra baby at the moment, we were upgrading the room and adding a crib. It really solved our biggest problem and also gave us a small gift. We are very happy😜 Of course, the most satisfying thing is the super large indoor playground. The children had a lot of fun and couldn’t even scream to leave🤣🤣I would also like to thank Aunt Huang Xiuying. Our children are young and have been watching over us while playing on the trampoline.

I would like to suggest that it would be even better if there was an outdoor activity area. Of course, this is a private request of a mother. After all, she must ensure time for outdoor activities for her baby🤭

msg:This time I brought the elderly at home to Qiandao Lake to celebrate the Double Ninth Festival. The reason I chose Minghao was because it was a newly opened hotel last year, and the price of the pre-sale package was more in line with my expectations. The housekeeper Xiao Zheng contacted and added WeChat one day in advance. They also responded very positively to my request. The reply was quick and considerate. They upgraded us to a Neihu viewing room on the 6th floor. It was very comfortable to lie on the balcony and watch a water screen movie at night.
The room is very big and new, and many aspects are well designed: temperature control switch beside the bed, electric curtains, wet and dry slippers, a full set of Bvlgari toiletries, a caviar hair dryer, and even the tea cans are cute
The breakfast is very rich and has everything you need. There is also a special area of ​​Chun'an. The Qiandao Lake yogurt is particularly delicious. When I checked out, I was given two bags of button oranges. It was sweet in my mouth and in my heart.
I especially want to say something about the aunt in the room service. Every time she brings me something, she smiles so brightly and is so kind.
But there are still some small details that I feel could be improved: the bathtub does not have a disposable bathtub cover, the curtains are a bit short, and light will come in in the morning, and the public bathroom in the hotel lobby does not have a disposable toilet seat.
Overall, it was a great stay experience. If I have a chance to come here next time and the price is right, I will still choose to stay at Minghao International Hotel.

Maybe it was due to traveling at off-peak hours, but the butler, concierge, front desk, housekeeping, and restaurant services were all good.
When the housekeeper was cleaning the house, the clothes scattered on the children's bed were folded neatly, which was better than mine. Great!

The hotel's children's playground is very large, and children love the water park. The heated swimming pool is visited every night and is well maintained.
The child forgot where he dropped his shoes, whether it was the water park, the swimming pool or the children's park. He didn't find it until he checked out, but he quickly helped to fix it. Thumbs up.

Give the housekeeper Xiaoyu a thumbs up!
Helped us book children's meals in the Chinese restaurant in advance, arranged late check-out, etc. great!

In addition, Bvlgari was stunned when washing!
The fountain show at night, the love of my life, I love it so much!
Finally, I gave a small gift for the baby and a Qiandao Lake souvenir, and I went home happily, ^_^.
I will come again next time I come to Qiandao Lake for one-stop babysitting!

I like the big sofa, facing the lake view, so comfortable to lie down on. Three sinks, also very child friendly. It is recommended that you use a small square towel for the sink in the bathroom, which will be more convenient. There are plenty of food items in the Minibar, and the first round is free.
The butler, Mr. Lu, was very considerate in his service. He gave us a birthday gift for the child's birthday. Another child who was traveling with us also gave us a gift. He picked us up in the lobby and saw us off personally. We were very touched. Other service staff in the hotel are also excellent, and the children's playground also has dedicated staff in several places.
The hotel's breakfast is impressive. One stall is full of local Qiandao Lake specialties, such as leek rice noodles, tofu buns, etc. There is also a stall in the children's area, which has taiyaki, egg tarts, and barbecued pork that children love. Crisp and so on. I saw some dishes that are not common in other hotel buffet breakfasts, such as various drinks, fried beef dumplings, durian cakes, homemade yogurt, etc. They were all delicious. The sweet potatoes also melted in the mouth and had the feeling of sweet potato and taro puree.
The hotel's parent-child feature lies in the 3,000-square-meter indoor children's playground, which has various areas necessary for indoor children's parks. The trampoline is a special feature. There is also a small animal display area and a self-paid area. This package includes 15 The air pistol is a very novel experience. It can be promoted more, and if there are many people, you can also play real-person CS. In addition, the koi at the Jiuqu Bridge were also astonishing. They were so big. It is not recommended to buy 10 yuan a pack of feed because the fish prefer to eat bread and biscuits.

There are always staff patrolling and reminding the swimming pool. Safety is very good. The first dinner we had at the hotel was at a Chinese restaurant. Personally, I felt it was average. Steaming the fish head takes time, so the serving speed was slow. On the second night, there were many people in the cafeteria, so it was a little messy, but the staff cleaned it up non-stop and provided good service. Overall it was a satisfying trip.

msg:I was very lucky to book a double 11 discount package (if there was no double 11 special offer, I would have booked the same type of room). I didn't believe it when I made the reservation, so I called the hotel to ask the difference between the two rooms, and I was relieved after being told that they were the same room type. The price of 599 is to stay in a deluxe lake view king bed room with an original price of more than 1,200. When I arrived at the hotel front desk to check in, the front desk staff (who didn't remember the name) told me that our room had been upgraded to a suite. I specifically asked, is the suite still a lake view room? Answer: Yes, let me ask again: Is it the inner lake or the outer lake? Answer: Outer lake. Continue to ask: Is it facing the outer lake? Answer: Yes. However, when I entered the room to pack my luggage and change my clothes, I opened the curtains and saw that the room was not facing the outside. The room was located in the last corner room on the first floor. The balcony faced Fish Street and Qiandao Lake could only be seen diagonally. I saw a corner at an angle, which was seriously inconsistent with the photos on the website or the front desk's answer to my questions. It was already dark and I hadn't eaten yet, so I didn't want to go through the trouble of changing rooms. However, I give full marks to the service of the butler Xiaotian. He has been patiently solving our problems and also presented us with an exquisite fruit plate. I don’t know if the girl at the front desk is too unfamiliar with her business or if she did it deliberately because I got a special room on Double 11. I will never choose your home again

The view is very good when you go out. There are buses, rental cars and restaurants nearby. This experience is still very good!

After riding along the lake, you can go to the 7th floor of the hotel to watch the sunset. In the evening, take the elderly and children to watch the water curtain. Movies and water curtain movies. There is an oversized bathtub to relieve the fatigue of the day, which is very suitable for a family resort hotel.

I will choose this hotel next time😚😚😚

msg:It was my first time to go to Qiandao Lake and I did a lot of guides online. I struggled with choosing a hotel for a long time. I saw that the Minghao International Resort Hotel was newly opened, so I thought the facilities should be new. As expected, the stay experience was very good and the butler service was great. They are also very considerate. They added WeChat in advance and will ask if we have any needs. I heard that we are staying with elderly people, so we arranged them on the same floor. They also upgraded the room. There will be a musical fountain in the hotel at night, and the housekeeper will provide the hotel with information in advance. The project list was sent in advance, which is very considerate! After returning from the tour, there are fruit plates, drinks and snacks provided by the hotel. You can see jade carvings everywhere in the hotel. It is also located at the central lake. The pier is right outside, making it convenient for travel.

msg:It is really great. First of all, the location is very good. Although it is not in the center of the county, the surrounding facilities are also very complete, which is very convenient.
More importantly, Manager Wang upgraded us to a lake view room, my goodness! The view of the lake from the large balcony is absolutely unbeatable. You can see the beautiful view of Qiandao Lake from the room, especially the sunset - just look at the picture! It feels more beautiful than watching the lake view from the Qiandao Lake observation deck downstairs!
The hotel room is also super large, clean and hygienic, with complete facilities. The bathtub is large enough for taking a bath, and the shower gel, shampoo, etc. are all from Bvlgari!
Let’s talk about the food. The breakfast is very rich and tastes very good. Just look at the picture. The sister Xu Liqin in the restaurant is great. Not only is her service warm, but she also gave us breakfast as a gift. The sister who is responsible for collecting the plates is also very attentive.
We also have a Chinese meal in this set meal. Emma said it was a meal for two people. I think it is enough for four people, but the three of us didn’t eat it anyway. And the cooking is very delicious. Even the fried vegetables are well cooked, which shows that the chef is very skilled, not to mention the super delicious fish head king. It is super big. It’s a pity that I didn’t eat enough. Let’s just look at the picture. .
The scenery inside the hotel is beautiful, very impressive, and there are koi fish to feed.
The waiters at the front desk also provided excellent service. Before leaving, they even gave us a bag of oranges, a specialty of Qiandao Lake, which were quite delicious.
Most importantly, the set meal is really affordable!
All in all, very satisfied with everything and I have already shared your link with my friends 😂
This is my first time to visit Zhejiang Province, and I really have a very good impression. It is worthy of its name as a pioneer demonstration zone for common prosperity!
Will come again in the future😘
Finally, here is a video of the lake view taken from my house for your reference.

He was very attentive and the butler Andy's service was super good and his attitude was very serious. He would do it every day. It was really considerate to ask me how my stay was today and if I needed any help or advice. [Children's Facilities] The hotel's children's playground is super large, almost half of the Nairbao Park. There are two ocean balls and slides to climb, a large trampoline area, and unlimited free rides on the merry-go-round. , so conscientious, and the staff inside are also very enthusiastic. The hotel has indoor and outdoor swimming pools. I didn’t have time to go to the outdoor swimming pool. I took my baby to the indoor swimming pool the next night. The water temperature in the indoor swimming pool felt a bit cold, not the warmer constant temperature.
There is an inner lake outside the hotel. You can watch fountains and water curtain performances at night. It is quite interesting. The children really like it anyway.
Then there is a beautiful pavilion and white marble bridge in the garden outside. It is full of classical aesthetics, and there are so many fish inside that the kids are reluctant to leave even if they feed the fish. There is an automatic fish food vending machine in the lobby, which is very convenient. [Room] We were upgraded to a parent-child lake view room. The lake view is really beautiful. The hardware and software facilities in the room are up to international five-star standards. The toiletries are Bulgari, not to mention the baby's children's toothbrush and children's sink. The details are really perfect. The baby loves his own sink so much that he goes to wash his hands there every day when he returns to the room. The parent-child room has one large bed and one small bed. The mattress and bedding are also very comfortable and soft. And there is a clothes drying rack on the balcony, which is very considerate.
The location of the hotel is also great, facing the invincible lake view. Across the road is Fish Street. It is absolutely super convenient to eat, as all kinds of restaurants on the list are there.

🏞️Minghao is located on the bank of Qiandao Lake. You can enjoy the beautiful sunset over the lake from the room window, as if the whole world has quieted down. The whole hotel is very new and the air is very good. There is no damp and musty smell like other hotels.
👩🏻💼The service staff are very positive and attentive. I would like to mention in particular that the loft I stayed in on the first night was a little noisy, but the housekeeper very thoughtfully changed me to a deluxe lake view room, which was very nice!
🍰This hotel has many surprises. The toiletries are from Bulgari, the hair dryer is from Dyson, and the tea in the suite is of good quality. In addition, there is a luxurious buffet breakfast in the morning; a free ride around the lake, which can save the cost of renting a bicycle! !
Overall, this hotel is really great! From the location to the service to the facilities, I am very satisfied

The structure of the room is slightly complicated, and the scenery on the balcony is very pleasant. You can have a panoramic view of the lake. You can relax and enjoy the comfort of the natural scenery.
The two wash basins and independent makeup mirror may be more concerned with the needs of family travel, so the design is well-intentioned.
The breakfast is very rich and there are many seats in the restaurant. Although it is a popular period during the National Day, there is no wait for a seat.
Finally, I am very grateful to the housekeeper, Ms. Dong, for her considerate, thoughtful and professional arrangements. From the room arrangement to the turndown decoration, from the welcome fruit plate to the souvenirs, she was very meticulous and thoughtful. Very patiently answered my transportation and travel questions. Thank you for the professional butler’s care!

msg:We checked in on Friday. It was rainy when we first arrived. I thought this trip was over. First of all, I would like to thank the hotel housekeeper Xiao Yu. She worked hard to help us communicate and arranged a room with a beautiful view outside the window, allowing us to stay even while we were there. Even on rainy days, you can enjoy the scenery outside in the room. During the entire stay, they also tried their best to help us answer and solve various problems, and thoughtfully prepared a small guide🥰
       In addition, the hotel's environment is great, and the staff in each position are also considerate. There are many types of buffet breakfast. The one that impressed me the most was the leek and tofu cake. I personally like it. I tried Chinese food one time and the fish head was really delicious. , was swept away, but the water spinach was worse among them, probably because of the vegetables. The leaves were tender, but the roots were old. Overall, it is indeed not comparable to ordinary low-star hotels!
       The hotel also has facilities such as a gym, swimming pool, and amu*****t park. Children in the amu*****t park like it very much. On rainy days, in addition to watching the scenery in the room, I take my children to play in the amu*****t park at other times!

msg:#Convenient transportation
#Room is quiet
#parent-child travel
#luxury decoration

Booked a one-night lake view twin room package, with breakfast included, come to check in on weekends, the transportation is very convenient, the location is in the city center, opposite the hotel is Qiandao Lake, there is a viewing platform where you can see the lake at 270 degrees, The hotel is 600 meters away from the pier. It is very convenient to take a boat. There is a food stall next to the fish, and it is 300 meters away from the hotel. The decoration of the hotel is very luxurious. With seven landscapes, it can be compared to luxury hotels in Macau. The rooms are all marble paved, and even the toiletries are Bulgari. After staying in the hotel, I found that this is a hotel very suitable for parent-child travel. The hotel comes with 7,000 square meters A children's paradise, there are many items for children to play, and there are swimming pools, both outdoor and indoor. In the hotel, you can rent bicycles for free with your room card, and you can also buy fish food for 10 yuan to feed the fish. In the lobby at night You can watch water curtain movies everywhere; if you are obsessed with taking a boat, you can also rent a cruise at the hotel or buy tickets at the front desk, and hotel guests have discounts.

Having said so many advantages, let me talk about the disadvantages of the hotel. The room is basically quiet, but if there are children yelling in the corridor, you can hear it clearly. The side of the room that looks at Qiandao Lake is next to the road, so you can sit at night The balcony will be disturbed by the street lights; in addition, if you come by car, the parking location is at B1. When there are many guests, the parking space is still a little far away from the hotel elevator entrance. The parking lot, swimming pool, and children's playground are all on B1. different direction.

I am very grateful to the hotel manager Xiao Wang for his help. The staff are very nice, and I will recommend friends to check in in the future! This is really a hotel very suitable for parents and children~

If you want to see the lake view, you should choose a high-end lake view room, because I don’t care. Anyway, in the room, there is a high probability of lying down and looking at the phone. It is very suitable for parents of children aged 4-7 to bring them to play. It is estimated that the indoor playground can play for a long time

This is better than the Hilton Hotel in Hainan in terms of details ~ I didn’t think about it because I was tired. When I went to a restaurant to dine, I called the front desk many times to inquire and confirm whether I could dine in the room. The front desk clearly said that it was possible, and then made an appoin**ent for a meal delivery time. However, there was a big communication problem between the front desk and the restaurant. I called the receptionist many times. The front desk (who contacted the Chinese restaurant but did not answer the phone) apologized in various ways for the agreed meal delivery time being more than an hour late. I hope all depar**ents can do a better job in communication! The Chinese fish head is quite delicious~

The sound insulation of the hotel is good, the room facilities are relatively new, and the details are in place. The buffet has a rich variety, and the daily dishes change slightly. Sitting on the balcony watching the sunset, every day is a big visual sense.
On the third night, I changed to a loft courtyard room. Another feeling is also very good. The design of two bathrooms is very convenient.
Experienced cycling, cocktails, gym.
The location of the hotel is very good. It costs 7 yuan to take a taxi to Qilong Lane, and it is very easy to take a taxi.

When I left, I forgot a piece of clothing. Xiao Dong from Minghao helped us express it to Hangzhou with SF Express, and his attitude was very good.

In short, five-star hotel, five-star recommendation.

msg:#transportation
The hotel is located by the Qiandao Lake. It is the best place to shoot the sunset when you go out. There is a glass plank road. The hotel is only 5 minutes away from Fish Street and food stalls, which is very convenient.
#Room
I booked a deluxe twin-bed terrace lake view room, and I was amazed as soon as I opened the door. The balcony is so big that you can see the lake from a distance. Because the floor is a bit low, the best view is to go to the executive lounge on the 7th floor, and the photos are first-rate.
The room is huge and the supplies are even more amazing. The toiletries are all from Bulgari, and the toothbrush for children is do clear, not disposable. It is full of style~ Although it is a twin bed, there is a big bed and a standard bed, which is very considerate. There is also a huge bathtub and sofa inside, which shows how big the room is.
The most worth mentioning is the bedside air-conditioning switch. Few hotels will set the air-conditioning switch on the bedside, and sometimes you have to get up in the middle of the night. Minghao is the only one I have lived in that has the air conditioner switch at hand, which is very user-friendly.
#FOOD
The hotel's breakfast hall is so big, so you can hardly feel the congestion in the morning rush hour. There are various types of breakfast. I especially like the "local specialties" section. There are many local delicacies: corn cakes, tofu, steamed buns wrapped in wine, etc., and homemade yogurt And coffee, too delicious~
#children's play
"There is an amu*****t park by the lake." The children's playground on the first ba*****t floor has more than 3,000 square meters. Children go there several times a day. Guests staying in the hotel can play for free. There are ocean ball pools, role-playing, trampoline slides, and carousels 🎠Basically a shopping mall The park has all the facilities
"Indoor and Outdoor Swimming Pools" Children love outdoor swimming pools. It is most suitable to go there after 4 pm. One pool is a little cold, and the other is just right for the sun. The indoor heated swimming pool is still a bit cold overall.
If you live here, you don’t need to go to the island anymore, and you won’t feel the same after playing for a whole day.
#Serve
Although it is the peak tourist season, the housekeeper Xiao Wang contacted and added WeChat in advance, and very considerately sent the itinerary of the rides, confirmed the arrival time, and arranged the room. During the stay, if there were any questions, Xiao Wang would inform and reply as soon as possible, so I felt very at ease.
When we arrived, the family members were surprised by the welcome and security services in the ba*****t. There were staff guiding them almost all the way, and they thoughtfully helped you find the parking space closest to the elevator (you don’t have to turn around in the garage yourself). There are still people getting off the car. Help open and close the door, take luggage, the service is simply 💯 points.
#bar
There is a small bar on the side of the first floor of the hotel lobby, and now there is an event to buy one get one free. But the essence is by no means ambiguous. The bartender, Build Wang, is very interesting. He recommended two suitable wines for us. The taste is very refreshing and summery. Although it is a little bit hot, it is delicious~

I have given Amway to many friends, and they have planted grass~ The old man at home said that this hotel is the most satisfying to live in so far, and I will come here for vacation in the second half of the year~

First of all, I would like to thank the housekeeper A Chao for his meticulous arrangements and responsiveness. The details of the hotel are done very well
The first thing to be attracted is the 3,000-square-meter indoor children's playground, outdoor water park, and indoor swimming pool, which can liberate yourself and have someone to watch your baby!
Later, I found out that there are many special parent-child activities for the summer vacation (there is a display board in the lobby on the first floor), there is a clown 🤡 performance, there will be stickers ✍️, chess ♟️, reading 📖 activities in the book bar on the second floor, and making candied haws 🍡 , Marshmallow some activities [victory]
When I came here, I found that all the toiletries in the room were from Bulgari, full of details [OK]

msg:It is very suitable for short trips. The hotel facilities are very complete. You can stay for one night without going out for two days. The children's playground and outdoor and indoor swimming pools inside are enough to play. Children like it very much. There is a waiter named Huang in the children's playground. The service It is in place, and the prompts for dangerous actions are in place, and children can stay in it for a day. The bicycle ride is also very good. In the evening, the family rode out to ride around the lake. It was very interesting. The white jade corridor for watching fish along the mountain scenery was also good, but it was too hot in August.

As soon as you arrive at the hotel entrance, the two welcoming guests will open the door for you and carry your suitcase. When you check in, the front desk Take the initiative to upgrade the lake view room for you. You can enjoy the beautiful sunset on the lake from the balcony of the hotel. It’s so beautiful. Seeing that we have two children, they also give us an extra bed for free. The butler, Chao, is very enthusiastic and sent us off personally. Go to the room and help us apply for a discounted price for children's breakfast. They also help us order afternoon tea and consult us about cruise ships. From time to time, they come to ask us if we want help. I am very satisfied with the hotel's service. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich. I especially like roasted sweet potatoes. Hahaha, the toiletries in the hotel are very high-end, or Bulgari, highly recommended

The high-speed rail arrived very late. The front desk of the hotel took the initiative to upgrade the lake view room. The staff Xiao Wang Added WeChat to send fruit and pastries to express greetings, and often take the initiative to contact if there is any need, and is on call. After staying for three nights, the whole family is very satisfied with the service of the hotel. Whether it is the security guard or the cleaning staff, the guides and the staff at the front desk are very kind and enthusiastic. I have booked a few times in the hotel room and the food delivery is very convenient. I went to the Chinese restaurant, which is also exquisite and delicious. The children in the hotel The paradise is very big, and the two children like it very much. In short, it is very convenient to eat inside and outside the hotel. It is close to the fish street and the pier. Qiandao Lake is still the first choice in the future~

Among the 4 people traveling. During our stay, 3 people had fever.
Also infected with COVID-19.
The air conditioning in the hotel lobby and restaurant was extremely cold.
It's extremely hot outside. The temperature difference is extremely large.
The reason why this hotel gets a bad review is that the front desk phone never gets through. Like a radio hotline, you have to make countless calls. I finally got through and asked the concierge to find a courier for me. Said to find and call me back. There is no more content. No call back for two days.
I'm really speechless.
The parent-child hotel is full of children, which is extremely noisy.

msg:The newly opened hotel last year has relatively complete facilities and almost no peculiar smell in the decoration. It is mainly a parent-child hotel, which is very suitable for bringing children. There are a lot of people checking in on weekends, and you need to wait in line, and you also need to wait for the room. Fortunately, the housekeeper took good care of the whole process, and I would like to praise Leo Xiaofei.
The size of the room is quite large, the bed is very comfortable to sleep on, but the layout is a bit strange, the bathtub and shower are right next to the door, there is no shelter, and the amenities are all Bulgari. There is welcome fruit when you check in, and there are souvenirs when you check out.
If you want to see the Qiandao Lake view, it is best to book a lake view room with a high floor. We live on the third floor, which is covered by many trees, or you can walk out of the hotel and there is an observation deck downstairs. The view is quite wide, and it is very good to watch the sunset.

When you come to Qiandao Lake, you must stay in a hotel, 360 degrees are beautiful
Sitting on the balcony can enjoy the lake view, and it is very pleasant to sit on the balcony in a daze all day.
I have been to Qiandao Lake many times, and this time I chose Minghao International Resort Hotel located in the central lake area.
Sitting on a 360-degree lake view, the location is perfect.
Come here for vacation, stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city, enjoy a moment of tranquility, open the window and have a panoramic view of the lake. In the evening, the sun sets, don't miss the beautiful sunset. facility:
The room facilities are very good, Bulgari toiletries, caviar hair dryer, oversized bathtub recommended
Check-in point: water curtain movie:
Enjoy the tranquility of Qiandao Lake with the super shocking water curtain light and shadow show. There are two shows at 7:30 and 8:30 every night.
Jiuqu Baiyu Bridge:
It is made of high-quality white marble carving, and feeding fish on the Baiyu Bridge is also a kind of enjoyment. 3 Strolling Huaguo Mountain: Baiyu Bridge connects Huaguo Mountain, and 48 kinds of Zhejiang fruits are planted on the mountain. It is also good to walk Huaguo Mountain. "travel alone

The baby toilet utensils, slippers, cotton shoes, bathrobes, toiletries, and room toiletries are also rare Bulgari series products. What needs to be praised the most is the thoughtful service of Dong Feiying, the housekeeper of the room. He prepared extra bathtub sets and bubble baths for us, as well as heating eye masks and baby golden water to relieve fatigue, which are so heartwarming! I brought my two treasures out on this outing, and I only remembered to prepare multiple pillows and quilts for Dabao before going to bed at night. I contacted around 23:00, and they still responded to the information and arranged in seconds. The service is amazing! Great experience 👍
        The hotel also arranges a lot of activities that children can participate in, and also has its own water park, but it can only be played after 2 pm. We were in a hurry this time, so we couldn't go to play. There are swimming pools and amu*****ts on the first floor of the hotel In the field, if you don't want to go out, it's still good to take your baby for a walk.
        Next time I come to Qiandao Lake, I will definitely choose this place again.

This time I stayed in a loft family room. Although I sacrificed the lake view, it has more space for two adults and two children. There is a small courtyard at the entrance, which is very quiet. The hotel is very new and has all the necessary facilities. It is also very clean
The customer service manager Xiao Wang contacted me the night before check-in and added WeChat to send me all the hotel’s summer vacation activities, so that I can arrange my itinerary for the next few days more reasonably
For kindergarten children, the 3,000-square-meter playground is still very attractive. Although the outdoor swimming pool is not very big, it is enough to play.
There are also various hotel free activities, and children also like it very much.
It is worth mentioning that the location of the hotel is first-class and travel is extremely convenient. The lake view opposite the hotel is very good
Xiaowang's is really professional and always shows up when needed. In the evening, he also specially delivered summer drink Guiling jelly and peach jelly white fungus. Knowing the high-speed rail time for us to return to Shanghai, he was very considerate and gave us a postponement. A big thumbs up
Looking forward to your next stay

From getting off the car, they provide all kinds of attentive services, except that the room is not cleaned when check-in, and an ice cream is given to the children. The hotel lobby is bright and luxuriously decorated. There are modern water curtain light shows inside and outside the hotel, which is amazing. There is a huge children's playground in the underground. It is a pity that the CS is broken and useless. It is very suitable for families under the age of 10 to take a parent-child vacation. The hotel set meal included his home restaurant set meal, which was too much for 2 people to eat, so we asked the waiter to cross out a dish, and finally gave us a drink. The restaurant is very good. The floor-to-ceiling windows at position C are facing the promenade Lijin outside. The dishes taste very good and I enjoy it very much. The one-hour bicycle provided in the package, the staff is very nice, constantly suggesting the riding time and helping to get water. (PS: The hotel provides 4 bottles of water every day, we almost don't have to find a place to buy water by ourselves, it is very convenient, like it 👍). The location of the hotel is very good. You can take a boat to watch Moonlight Love within walking distance. There are various restaurants, food stalls, Xiushui Street, etc. nearby. In the end, because the cycling path along the river was very narrow, it was just enough to accommodate a tandem bicycle, and some places were almost impossible to pass. We accidentally smashed the handlebar of the tandem bicycle against the guardrail and damaged it. We thought we needed compensation. The hotel staff was very concerned about whether the child was injured, and did not ask us to pay for repairs. We were very touched. It is recommended that families who choose tandem bicycles be more cautious, and don't hit the guardrail like us. Finally, before leaving, the hotel thoughtfully presented a small drink gift, and the bicycle management staff helped us find a car and sent us to a taxi. Although I don’t know his name, I am sincerely grateful. This service, it should be said that the service of the Hilton Hotel I just checked in (booked a few hotels for a week of vacation to experience life😊) is not as good as that of Minghao, like it 👍👍👍👍

msg:I booked Minghao Hotel without looking carefully. Only when I arrived did I realize that there is a Menggu Road from the lake view, unlike other first-line lake view hotels that are actually located by the lake. The advantage of the location is that it is close to Fish Street and food stalls, and it is convenient for dining. Because the cleaning time is tight before check-in during the peak tourist season, it is a little insufficient, but after the proposal, the room attendants improved quickly, praise! In addition, Ms. Dong Feiying, the housekeeper of the room, is warm and thoughtful. She introduced the environment and various activities in the hotel in detail, and can solve the complaints of the guests in a timely manner. After the guests leave the hotel, the after-sales service also adds luster to the hotel. Personally, I think the design of the hotel rooms is a major flaw. The island-style sink is located at the entrance, which is actually a safety hazard for hotel rooms that focus on parent-child use. Not to mention water leakage, it is easy for children to bump their heads. Although the owner or designer of the hotel may think this is a bright spot. Because the restaurant has opened soon, the service personnel of the restaurant need to strengthen training, and they must serve the diners diligently, and chatting in groups cannot become the norm.

I wrote this review based on the mentality of the original picture, and gave some references to tourists who are going to travel to Qiandao Lake: The most important thing for me to stay in a hotel is the comfort of the room. Minghao gives me the feeling that it is not inferior to a luxury hotel, and With the blessing of beautiful scenery, this night in Minghao was very unforgettable.
Washing and care is a full set of Bulgari, and even bathing has become a kind of expectation and enjoyment. There are scenery everywhere inside and outside the hotel, the rooms are very picturesque, and there are koi ponds and small courtyards with Suzhou garden style outside the door, which are full of poetic and picturesque. I had dinner and breakfast at Minghao. The ingredients were fresh and delicious, which brought a taste bud enjoyment to this trip. It is important to mention that the service staff are very enthusiastic and thoughtful, and they feel like coming home. Next time I come to Qiandao Lake, I will still choose Minghao!

msg:I started to travel to Qiandao Lake by car with my children and their baby in the summer vacation. I booked 2 2-night lake-view rooms at Qiandao Lake Minghao International Resort Hotel through Ctrip in advance. The car was still on the way. The hotel housekeeper Xiaoqian called us to inquire about arrival Time and what needs, after arriving at the hotel, the check-in procedure was completed quickly and the children were provided with children's slippers and toiletries. The location of Minghao Hotel is good. You can directly enjoy the lake view on the j floor of the hotel. There are water screen movies every night. There are two indoor and outdoor swimming pools and a 1500 square meter indoor children's playground in the hotel. The hotel's western restaurant has a big breakfast There are so many varieties of buffet, children can't get enough of it. The dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant taste very good. After staying in the hotel for 2 days, we basically ate lunch and dinner in the Chinese restaurant. The hotel is very close to the cruise ship pier in the central scenic spot of Qiandao Lake, and it can be reached in a few minutes on foot. Walking along the lakeside trails, you can enjoy the beautiful view of Qiandao Lake.

There are also boat cruises near the hotel, and it's not far to play projects. It can be said that eating, drinking and having fun can be done.
        It is worth mentioning that there is a super large playground downstairs in the hotel, the baby treasure place~ the staff member Huang Xiuying is also very responsible, very kind, and very friendly to children. Extra points for the playground and hotel !
        Finally, I would like to thank Xiao Jiang at the front desk. He is serious in his work and has a very good attitude. Not only did he upgrade the room for us, but he also helped me consider the needs of my second child in advance.

The seafood buffet is also good, but there are many people on weekends, so you need to book early. The swimming pool is also crowded on weekends, but it is fine on weekdays.

Super new hotel opening in 2022 with first-class facilities Robot food delivery directly to the room
Located in the super city center of the Central Lake area, the Qiandao Lake coastal trail is just outside the door, and there are various restaurants next to it
The 3,000-square-meter underground playground inside the hotel is suitable for little ones and primary and secondary school children. It is a paradise for children. There are also small open-air attractions such as water screen movies, Jiuqu Yuqiao fish feeding, etc. Stay in the hotel without leaving home
There are many types of breakfast. Although the taste is average, it is very immersive. There are children's tableware, cartoon snacks, etc. There is also a Starbucks in the lobby bar on the first floor yyds
There is also a bar on the first floor of the hotel, suitable for guests who need to let go haha

I feel that the hotel is not very good at publicizing. Except for the name soil, the promotion uses Bulgari care. The Bulgari care is in a large bottle. I personally think it is unhygienic and tasteless, but the hotel itself is really good. It is suitable for those who like urban areas and destinations. That is to say, it is not suitable for people who like privacy, because there are indeed many people in parent-child hotels, and those who like quietness may have to detour

When I left, the front desk gave me a sample of toiletries and drinks, and I also waived the cost of bicycle rental, which is very considerate

It is very cost-effective for non-holidays, cheaper than Intercontinental, and much better than InterContinental in terms of location

Before leaving, I received a call from the manager Xiaobo and asked about the need for accommodation. I told him that I was going out because of my husband's birthday. When you arrive at the hotel, from the doorman to the front desk to the waiters you meet, all greet you with smiles, not mechanical and rigid, and feel very homely. The check-in at the front desk was fast and the lake view room was upgraded. Opening the door and facing the vast expanse of blue waves, you can watch the clouds and smoke, the sunset and the sunset, it is really happy. The hotel environment is beautiful, the facilities are relatively new, the toiletries are very high-end, the breakfast is good, and I especially like Chun'an's special breakfast. Xiaobo also specially customized a birthday cake for us, and sent a car aromatherapy pendant when he left the hotel reception - see the warmth for details, it was a pleasant trip.

I just thought the location was good, but I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived! The facilities are really friendly to parents and children. The fish pond in the yard, the largest children's playground in Qiandao Lake, and the swimming pool all make the children very happy! The water curtain movie is even more creative. The bathroom is even more considerate with a small ladder for the baby. It was really embarrassing to go out and wash your baby's hands before. Every detail of the hotel is very good! The housekeeper Xiaobo and the guide Xiaowu are very caring, and they will be willing to stay if there is a chance in the future.

This time I chose Qiandao Lake Minghao International, mainly because there is a children's playground where I can play, so that my family of four can soak in the hotel and spend the weekend comfortably.
The hotel is located on the lively street of Qiandao Lake, and it is very convenient to eat and take out.
The room is very comfortable, two big beds can sleep two big and two small, the only fly in the oin**ent is that the bath is not covered, it is easy to get wet and slippery on the floor, it will be even more embarrassing if someone opens the door during the bath.
The breakfast is until 10:30, which is really family-friendly. The breakfast style is not bad, and there are special snacks of Qiandao Lake.
In the evening, I specially ate the buffet dinner. The only seafood was fresh crayfish. The other seafood was really hard to describe, and the meal styles were quite small.
The main recommendation is the Children's Paradise, where you can play for two days. There is also an outdoor swimming pool slide in summer. It is a pity that it is not open this time.

Basically, I take my children out every month, and I always choose a five-star hotel. This is the first time I have taken the initiative to give positive reviews (except for bad reviews! I can’t help complaining), the overall feeling is that the service is good and very generous! Those hotels that cost two or three thousand are not as grand as they are, and the price/performance ratio is very high!
Before check-in, Xiao Wang, the assistant manager of the lobby, first added WeChat to inquire about the arrival time and upgraded the room. During the check-in period, he also responded in time and responded to every request!
We stayed for three nights in total. During the stay, the room attendants and aunts were very attentive and lovely. Xu Yueying, Chen Ailian, Shao Yuexian and so on.
Bulgari toiletries, I don’t feel much about this, I especially want to praise toothpaste and children’s toothbrush and toothpaste. Adults use Ora2, and children also use imported toothpaste! This is simply great! The hair dryer is also very powerful!
For breakfast, there is nothing wrong with it, but what is different from other hotels is that the mantou has steamed buns made on the spot, not the unpalatable steamed buns that are frozen and heated.
The takeaway robot is so friendly, it can help me get five or six takeaways in one morning!
The hotel room is also very big! The parent-child park is very large and has many projects. It is worth mentioning that the park has play attendants who are very dedicated! This is something that other hotel-style parks do not have!
No matter who comes to Qiandao Lake! I definitely recommend it highly!

msg:Environment: The hotel is big, beautiful and clean. The children's paradise is also very clean and super big, and the baby doesn't want to come out after entering it haha. There is also a water screen movie in the hotel~

Facilities: The room facilities and equipment are very convenient and easy to use, and the air conditioner is also very powerful. The room is very big and super comfortable. When traveling as a family, you must choose a parent-child room!

Service: Here comes the important point. Every staff member is very kind and friendly. Because they came from other provinces, they specially contacted the hotel switchboard to inquire about some relevant information before departure. Special thanks to the lady named Cindy, who directly said to add WeChat to communicate, and answered many questions on WeChat. And also helped to upgrade the room, so that our family can enjoy a more beautiful lake view. The little brother at the front desk when we checked in was also super nice, he spoke very gently, and introduced us to the hotel in detail. The young lady at the check-out was also very concerned about the check-in experience and gave a small gift. There are also many aunts and other staff in the guest rooms who will greet each other when they meet on the road. It really makes people feel at home. Will come again next time! !

msg:I came to Qiandao Lake on May 1st, and I am very satisfied with all aspects of the hotel, especially the service. We met with our butler Lu and contacted us one day in advance. All questions were answered and arranged in time. After checking out, the children still want to go The butler Lu of the Paradise took us down to make arrangements, and finally gave a popcorn to the children before leaving, so considerate! The buffet breakfast is very good, as well as Xiaoqinglong. I also tried the buffet dinner, which was not as good as the reviews. In general, there is no hot pot now, and the price/performance ratio is not high. I don’t recommend it.

msg:In the past, when I came to Qiandao Lake, I always stayed in foreign-funded five-star hotels. This time I was traveling with three-year-old twin babies. I wanted to choose a hotel close to the central lake area that is convenient for travel. Unexpectedly, the experience of staying in the hotel is beyond five stars. The hotel not only has a superior location, a wide view of the lake, first-class service, but also brings many surprises: ingenious bed settings, smart water curtain light and shadow show, welcome fruit and considerate service... The hotel is only a few steps away from the lakeside or Take a night tour of the pier, at sunset, take a walk or ride around the lake or take a night cruise on an ancient boat, leisurely and comfortable. I can't see enough beautiful scenery, and I can't say enough thanks. Special thanks to the housekeeper Cindy for contacting us in advance and making arrangements. He also upgraded the room type for us. We were able to enjoy the beautiful sunset, and we were so excited to say goodbye to our children with the sun. There are also staff at the front desk, children's playground, restaurant, and room service depar**ent, who are enthusiastic and meticulous, and respond to requests. Special thanks to Zhou Xueqin in the western restaurant. Seeing that it was inconvenient for me to have breakfast with my twins, I was busy helping me with the food. Before I left, I packed snacks and fruits for the children to feel warm.

When you come to Qiandao Lake for a parent-child trip, Minghao is the first choice!

msg:In the three days after the May Day holiday, I took the children and parents to have a vacation. The lake view family room was booked more than a month ago, and we were upgraded to a luxurious lake view family room on the day of check-in! ! The landscape is invincible! !
By car, the location of the hotel is very easy to find, very close to Fishing Street, next to the Xiushui Bridge, across the road is the lakeside greenway, very suitable for enjoying the scenery and walking.
Service: The hotel manager Xinya contacted me the day before check-in, confirmed the relevant matters, added WeChat, and sent me many tips. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I was warmed up by several security masters who received me all the way. They were very simple and enthusiastic. They guided me where to drive and ordered me to park. The housekeeper, Sister Chen Ailian, was very considerate and gave welcome fruit and a small gift for sleeping. There is an indoor swimming pool and a large children's playground on the first floor of the hotel. Had a great time for three days. The child forgot to bring a swimming cap, and sister Ma at the service desk gave one and lent us a swimming ring to inflate the child's armband. The pregnant lady at the service desk of the Children's Paradise was also very enthusiastic and sent them floor socks of very good quality. What is especially commendable is that the children's playground is open at three time periods a day, and it is suspended for a period of time at noon and afternoon. It needs to be sorted and disinfected, which is impossible for professional large-scale amusement parks. On the last morning, I went to ride a bicycle. The little brother at the front desk upgraded us to a four-person family car. Riding along the lake is a special experience. My mother lost the room card while riding, and the little brother at the front desk immediately opened a new one after confirming the loss. We are still very sorry, and the little brother comforted us. It has been a long time since a hotel staff loved it. on a hotel.
Facilities: Newly opened in 22 years, the facilities are of course not to mention, they are all up-to-date, with humanized design, suitable for vacation and leisure.
Environment: The a**osphere reveals pride. There are everything you need indoors, and there are Huaguo Mountain, Baiyu Corridor, Fish Watching Pond, and an outdoor water park outside. A small map clearly introduces the hotel's features. You can stay for a week without leaving the hotel. Anyway, I can't fault it, it's just a comfortable one.
Hygiene: Whether it is the restaurant or the lobby, the entertainment area or the rooms, everything is clean, and it feels like there are staff cleaning all the time. The room is very clean, especially the bathroom. The aromatherapy in the room smells good. Bulgari's body wash has been used for a few days, and my body smells fragrant every day!
Minghao's breakfast buffet is also highly recommended. It has a rich variety and sufficient supply, and there is also a Qiandao Lake special food area. It's a pity that I misremembered the time and didn't eat the legendary Qiandao Lake Seafood Buffet Ceiling, Minghao Buffet Dinner.
The children said that three days is not enough, they have to stay for five days, and they will come again during the summer vacation. It's been a long time since I posted a comment. It was really a pleasant trip, and I am grateful to every Minghao staff member I met.

It is very convenient to go anywhere, there is a pier, and there is a street with stalls. The fish heads outside Chunyuan downstairs are delicious, and the per capita is only 100, which is quite sufficient
The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, the facilities are very new, and there are many activities in the morning and evening. There are music fountain performances, which is very good.
There is also the night bed made by the hotel lady, which is a very cordial and warm experience. The quality of the welcome fruit is also good, and they are double

msg:I stayed in three hotels in Qiandao Lake. This one had the highest price and the highest expectations. I was very disappointed. The parent-child room I booked did not have any children's elements except the child's toothbrush and bathrobe. The room was not big and the decoration style was ordinary. The toilet was It's like an ordinary express hotel. All the facilities are worth over 1,600, and the open bathtub has no meaning for a parent-child room. Only the lake view in the morning makes up for it a little bit. There is nothing to visit around the hotel, so it is really not as leisurely and comfortable as staying at Kaiyuan Resort.

      On the day of check-in, the whole family was pleasantly surprised, and the beautiful scenery of Qiandao Lake was unobstructed, as picturesque. In the parent-child room, children's toiletries, small slippers and bathrobes are thoughtfully prepared, as well as welcome fruit and free water. In addition to disposable slippers, there are also non-slip slippers. Bulgari's toiletries are safe to use. Overall very clean and thoughtful. The room comes with a large balcony with a reclining chair and a seat, which our father and brother occupy almost all the time. The configuration of one large one, one small, two beds and one sofa made our stay very comfortable.
      When checking out, the hotel also gave a drink and the same type of aromatherapy in the room, and the parking is free. For the trip of three days and two nights, whether it is the hotel location, service and environment, or the nearby food stalls and night tour pier, I am very satisfied, and I will definitely choose it next time.

Then I told the front desk that I wanted a room with a higher floor and a better view. The front desk told me that they only have three lake rooms in the hotel. The room type has a good view and the location and floor are not good. I was impatient and could only choose one of the three. I don’t believe it. I went to the hotel after two o’clock and wanted a better room. The check-in time listed above is in the afternoon. At three o'clock, I arrived half an hour early and was told that there were only three rooms outside the lake, and the attitude during the communication with her was not very nice and blunt.

The scenery of Qiandao Lake is beautiful, it is worth the trip. The small biscuits given as a check-in gift at the end were very delicious. I didn’t have enough friends, so I asked for a few more. Ctrip's check-in is very convenient, no deposit is required, and payment is made upon departure.

I was worried that the service would not be good due to the large number of people during the May Day holiday, but the staff were very enthusiastic and answered every question patiently. Even the security guards in the ba*****t were very dedicated, making people feel very comfortable. Booked an executive room, you can see Qiandao Lake when you open the window. The hotel sends fruit and snacks every day, and I can't finish it, haha. The hotel's toiletries are Bulgari, which is quite high-end. Nearby is Fish Street, there are many restaurants to eat. I ate a few places. In fact, I think the Chinese restaurant on the second floor of the hotel tastes the best, but the online rating is not high. I guess it is because it is expensive, haha, but the environment and taste are good. The location of the hotel is also very good, just in the central lake area, convenient for travel and sightseeing. We booked a hotel-packed yacht from the travel agency in the lobby to go to the lake. There are fewer people and there is no need to queue up. It is recommended to consider. In general, I am very satisfied with the food, accommodation and play this time.

Secondly, the environment is first-class, facing the lake area of Qiandao Lake, and the front and back are lake areas, just like a boat sailing in the lake. The third view is invincible, whether it is the lake view or the view room, you can see the lake view, and the green mountains and green waters have their own advantages. The last is the facilities. The 22-year-old new hotel has all kinds of electric curtains, constant temperature swimming pool, video game park, and high-end equipment. Of course, the most impressive thing is the service. The May Day peak season experience can still be maintained first-class, responsive to requests, proactive and enthusiastic, and I would like to give a big thumbs up!

msg:I have stayed in five-star hotels countless times during my travels, and Minghao's service is so satisfying! Two key points of praise:
1. Xiao Wang, assistant manager of the lobby. Before moving in, Manager Wang contacted us, which made the whole family very at ease. Just after checking in, I have already notified the hotel's various activities in WeChat in time. On the day of check-out, because we had a cruise, we even delayed our check-out by an hour. This kind of service is really great!
2. A sister named Shao. The baby went swimming twice on the first day, and the swimsuit was not dry. She took us to the laundry room to dry it. I was really touched!
In short, every hotel employee is very enthusiastic. We left something in the room when we checked out today, and the girl at the front desk ran to help us find it. A small gift was also given when checking out.
In addition to the staff, the other facilities of the hotel are also very good, there is a children's playground, there are bicycles, you can feed fish and climb mountains in the hotel, and there are water screen movies at night.
Next time I come to Qiandao Lake, I will definitely choose Minghao!

You can see the lake view when you lie on the bed and open the curtains. The room was cleaned very clean, which was a good experience for us who have a slight cleanliness. The children's equipment in the room is very complete, with high and low basins, footstools, toilet stools, and also installed fences on both sides of our bed. Because the hotel is separated from the lake by a road, Xiao Fu thoughtfully prepared earplugs for us because we were worried that we would be affected by passing vehicles at night. If you need to contact Xiao Fu, you can give a timely response and solve it properly, which is great!
The buffet I ate at the hotel on the night of check-in, the seafood was very fresh, and the freshly squeezed juice was also good. The service that Manager Zhou gave me was very heartwarming. Seeing that it was not very convenient for me to pick up meals with my baby, he arranged for me to be near the dining table and helped pick up the meals. In addition: I suggest that I can choose the next day Avoid the peak breakfast period and come to dine, the service is great!
The hotel also has a large children's playground, which is cleaned and disinfected regularly, perfect for walking the baby.
Although the location of the hotel is a bit flawed (it is across the road from Qiandao Lake, it will be a bit noisy if you book a lake-view room outside), but the service and facilities make up for it, and I will choose it again next time.

msg:The holiday itinerary is for parent-child travel for three days and two nights. The parent-child theme room is booked for one night each in the 108-degree lake view room and the business suite. The day before the trip, Ms. Taozi from the hotel contacted me to inquire about the purpose and needs of the trip and offered to provide according to the needs. The room type is upgraded for free, so the surprise trip has already started in advance
We took the high-speed rail to Qiandaohu Station and arrived at the hotel by online car-hailing. As soon as we entered the hotel, we were shocked by the whole row of white marble railings and the huge water curtain in the lobby. When the door of the room was opened, the automatic curtains slowly opened. unobstructed lake view
Enter the comment mode below:
The location of the hotel is excellent, it is in the middle of the lake, the decoration is magnificent, the elevator is wide and quiet, and it is quick to swipe the room card to protect the safety of guests. The carpet in the corridor is soft, and if the trolley box is heavy, there are some barriers to rolling. all perfect
Second, as a resort hotel that focuses on parent-child, various parent-child rooms, parent-child suites, super large playground, warm swimming pool, water curtain movie, etc. are very friendly to guests who are interested in parent-child travel. At the beginning, I was not very comfortable with a male employee who took the trouble to lead and help the child, and also gave the child a gift from the frustration at the beginning, so that the child felt a sense of accomplishment later. On the first day of the non-weekend afternoon, there were not many children playing in the venue. A female employee was afraid that the child would be alone. Accompanying the baby during the game, the other two female receptionists greeted the guests, registered information, introduced items, etc., were friendly and professional, and the disinfection and cleaning three times a day really ensured that the children’s socks were still spotless after playing for a whole day. The water temperature in the swimming pool is 29 degrees. According to the customer's request, the indoor air conditioner is heated and the child will not catch cold after warming the water
The breakfast in the three food and drink parts is quite satisfactory, no surprises or accidents, normal five-star standard, there is a special parent-child area that provides baby tableware and some baby food, here are some suggestions for parent-child area, like many parent-child themed hotels that provide special baby dining tables and chairs, plastic table mats repeat Use a rag to wipe the table. After turning over the table, the hygiene of the guests behind cannot be guaranteed, especially children who are easy to pick up and accidentally drop food. The egg stall needs to be improved. The noodle stall has a little ingredients and there is no tray.
The replenishment of food is slow, especially in the drink area. The two breakfast juices are empty cans. The Chinese restaurant on the second floor. The hotel’s fish head set meal is great and cost-effective. It is worth recommending. The second meal is a little disappointing. It is recommended that the hotel improve the overall level of the chef
4. Room service responds in a timely manner, is polite and professional, and every day when the bed is turned down, there will be a small greeting card and a gift eye mask, which is very considerate
5. The front desk received a lot of guests on the first day of check-in. It may be that they are very responsible for each guest and the detailed introduction gave me the illusion that the efficiency was a bit low. This impression was reversed when I checked out because the room was delayed to two When I clicked check-out and it was the peak of check-in, when the patrolling front desk staff saw that I was holding the room card, they quickly helped me complete the refund in seconds. The concierge was also very friendly during the gift period and borrowed the umbrella to return it. Umbrella gives full trust to guests instead of being as strict as some hotels
Liu Taozi’s care and greetings from the time of check-in to the safe arrival home. This receptionist who has never met and does not know his real name runs through the entire three-day and two-night itinerary. Even before and after the itinerary, he arranges and handles almost everything through WeChat. The details and problems made me look forward to staying in this hotel again and I will sincerely recommend this hotel to friends who want to come to Qiandao Lake
7 The owner of the hotel belongs to hearsay and personal conjecture. If it does not match the facts, it is irresponsible. It is said that the hotel owner is a successful businessman in Yiwu who is generous and generous. Why did he invest in this hotel? Free birthday cake in the room. Desserts in the executive lounge. Haagen-Dazs Bulgari bathing companion gifts, etc. are everywhere. As long as the guests are happy and comfortable, the boss seems to be happier...Here is a lot of praise for the boss for three days and two nights surprise thanks

Three days and two nights are very short. I hope to have the opportunity to stay again to experience other facilities and services that I didn’t have time to experience this time. I also hope that the hotel can be more perfect so that more guests can make their trip worthwhile.

Upon entering the hotel, there will be a cordial and polite greeting from the doorman, and parking guidance will be provided. The lobby is full of design, gorgeous and elegant, and the RGB lighting effect is eye-catching.

Xiao Wang, the deputy manager of the lobby, also gave us travel suggestions throughout the whole process, and answered questions at any time, thank you very much

The breakfast is rich in variety, with a wide variety of tastes, and it is clean and hygienic, and there is no need to queue up.

What impresses us the most is the music and light fountain every night. It is extremely pleasant to drink cocktails and enjoy the light fountain while blowing the night wind by the lake.

msg:Because I went with my friends on Thursday, there are relatively few people in the hotel. The location of the hotel is very good next to the lake. I booked a theme room. Because there are two children, the hotel has prepared a crib in advance. The service is very considerate, and the waiter will say hello when they see it. On the first afternoon, I took my children to play in the playground. I was very happy. I watched a water screen movie in the room at night. I went to the indoor swimming pool the next morning. However, the shallowest part is 1.2 meters. The overall is very good, suitable for traveling with children.

msg:1. In fact, what I am not very satisfied with is that the room we booked does not include children's playground and other activities. When I took my children to the amusement park to play, I was told that they could not enjoy this activity, which was very heartbreaking! 1,350 per night does not include a children's paradise. The next day's check-out rate is half the price and includes a children's paradise and other items. My son cries at night and must go to the amusement park. It is rare to take children out to play, but it makes it unpleasant. Chinese and Western food are not special. I thought that choosing a newer hotel would be better than a hotel like Sheraton. I will not stay there next time. .
2. There was hair in the bathtub and the floor was dirty. The towel used to wipe the hands and dry the water on the floor was black.

There are hills to climb in the yard, a fish watching bridge, and a water screen movie at night. The whole hotel is quiet and the children play in the hotel Just very happy.

Service: One day before check-in, manager Xiao Wang, the lobby manager, called to confirm the check-in time, and added a V letter. You can communicate with him at any time if you have any questions. Manager Wang handles the feedback very quickly and has a good attitude.

msg:Domestic hotels roll up and there is no other five-star thing!
Because the baby needs a crib, I wanted to communicate in advance, so I called the hotel and added the hotel lobby assistant manager Xinya WeChat. By the way, I asked if the baby was one year old, if there are some decorations, I didn't expect that not only the warm decorations, but also helped prepare the cake, and asked intimately when she hoped to get it. Seeing that we are three adults, we also directly upgraded 3 breakfasts.
When we arrived at the hotel, everyone was very enthusiastic from the service parking at the door, even the cleaning lady, who was very kind. Seeing that we had a baby, they gave us an extra pack of tissues for cleaning the next day, fearing that it would not be enough. I went to the Sheraton before, and the crib was a very impersonal iron bed, but this hotel uses a wooden crib, and the height is also suitable. The spare parts are indeed Bulgari, but I didn’t expect the toothpaste to be Olebe.
Finally, I would like to emphasize that this hotel is really very friendly to young babies. There are 2 water screen movies in the hotel at night, which will not hurt the eyes and let the baby watch it fresh, not to mention the 3000-square-meter children's amu*****t park that comes with it. We have upgraded it for unlimited play during our stay at the hotel, and can be accompanied by 2 adults. It is estimated that the playground is too big, and no matter how many people enter, this may be the ocean ball that my baby has seen the most. It is really suitable for adults and children. roll! ! And even for older children, the park also has projects such as go-karts, so you can discharge without going out. In addition, there are too many big fish in the fish pond at the entrance of the hotel. They are really big fish, which attract all kinds of children to watch.
All in all great value for money! ! !

msg:Minghao, I want to give a serious review, because. . . After writing, maybe a hotel will come to me for a free trial stay? Well, let’s get down to business, let’s start talking about the hotel, let’s talk about the advantages first. First of all, the location is very good. It should be the center of the entire tourist area. It takes about ten minutes to go anywhere. The location facing the lake view is also very good. You can see the photos, except for the inner lake. Restaurant, western restaurant, book bar, coffee shop, exclusive swimming pool (because there are no people there), playground, gym, big fish pond, etc. It’s great that there are few people, and you can enjoy it all alone. The boss likes jade, and there are jade everywhere. The decoration, the Great Wall part is very reflective of the boss's strength; in the end, the butler service is quite good, and the manager Xiaofang replied and solved the problem in a timely manner. In addition, Xiaozhu (nicole) in the playground is also very considerate. So most of my friends who come to Qiandao Lake to find Minghao should be satisfied. Here are a few suggestions: 1. Take care of the bathing in the parent-child room and the privacy of the bedroom. 2. Improve the smart facilities in the room, such as the smart toilet seat, otherwise it will look a bit old-fashioned (the express delivery robot is very cute) 3. The soundproofing of the balcony should be improved. 4. The restaurant is relatively quiet. Should we consider more preferential measures? There are too many options outside. The invisible toothpaste left by the last guest 6. You can put more stools in the room, because there are many people in the parent-child room. Finally, if you want to watch my full video, you can come to the video account: Zou Zou Zou You You ah ah ah.

You can see the water curtain show from the balcony of the room at night. It will not be boring to soak in the hotel for two days and one night. After breakfast, you can go to Huaguo Mountain to feed the fish! I would also like to praise Xiao Bo, the lobby manager, for his considerate and enthusiastic service, and will patiently answer any questions during the stay! Summer will continue to come to check in, and the outdoor children's pool park will only open in summer.

I decided to go to a newly opened hotel to try something new. There was a group purchase of 859 yuan. I didn’t expect to upgrade the inner lake view room directly after arriving at the store. In the evening, you can watch the water curtain show directly on the balcony. The service standard of the hotel is very high. The delivery from the parking lot to the room is very warm, especially the assistant Li Xinya in the lobby. After adding WeChat, you can answer all questions quickly.

msg:I went to Qiandao Lake for a trip in early spring. I looked for a hotel for a long time. I saw that it was newly opened last year and thought it should be pretty good, so I booked this hotel. I saw the comments saying that the decoration tasted very strong, so I thought it might be newly opened. It should be better in half a year now, so I don't care too much. As it turns out, I was wrong. When we opened the door to our room for the first time, there was a strong pungent smell blowing over us. I couldn't take it anymore, so I told the front desk to change the room. I saw 2 rooms, one was an upgraded room type, but the front desk said that there was no one staying there for a few days, and the smell was as strong and pungent after opening the door. I looked at the second room, which was checked out by the guests the day before, and it was relatively light, so let’s take this room after thinking about it. On the second morning of my stay, my friends and I both experienced eye discomfort, which slowly disappeared after several days. Such a hotel is too scary, it is said to be a 5-star hotel, but... there will be no next time

msg:Be cautious if you don't come to live.
First of all, the hotel is new, but the smell is super big, so you must be cautious when bringing children, especially babies. Adults feel dizzy and their eyes are hot, let alone children. Stayed for two days and opened the balcony door all the way, and it smelled uncomfortable if it was not opened.
Secondly, the service of a five-star hotel is really not good. We arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock, and the first sentence at the front desk said that our hotel normally checks in at 2 o'clock, which means that we are blaming us for being early. Let's come early, let's wait, during the opening period, our two families have 5 children, and the children are required to provide their ID cards, health codes, and fill in their ID numbers. Your hotel, is it so troublesome for the children? You have to take a photo with your ID card, just provide it, let us wait for 40 minutes. Let's go out to have a meal first. When we came back after 2 o'clock, the room hadn't been cleaned yet. It was really annoying. The baby was going to sleep. He told us that it would be cleaned in 40 minutes. It hasn't been cleaned in nearly two hours. What kind of service is this? ? It was a bad experience on the first day.
Then I asked for a crib, but I was told that there was no one. If there is no one, I don’t have it. I said to keep it for me the next night, but the sound disappeared the next day.
Also, the sound insulation is really poor, and I don't know how bad it is. Talking to the next door, making a phone call is like being in your own room.
And there are children's noises in the corridor in the middle of the night and in the morning, which can be heard clearly. Not well rested.
There is also breakfast, and I was told that we will be charged for over 1.2 meters. For this breakfast, there is also a breakfast fee of 69, which is really weird.
The so-called outdoor swimming pool, a little big
won't come again

msg:It is said that a good experience will not write a review, and a poor experience will write a review. I'm the one with the worst experience. I have stayed in almost all the five-star hotels in Qiandao Lake. I went to Minghao this summer, and the reviews are all full marks, and it is a newly opened hotel. I was hesitating between CLUB Med Joy and Minghao for a long time. Three thousand square playgrounds and good reviews went to Minghao. I expected to have a wonderful experience, but who knew that I was blinded by the experience at the beginning. When we checked in, it was around one o'clock in the afternoon. The front desk said that the room hadn't been cleaned up yet, and asked us to wait after we got the card. We waited foolishly at the front desk until we checked in after 3:40. At that time, the room hadn’t been cleaned thoroughly. As soon as I entered the room, I saw the nail shells and hair cut by others under the sink. I hurriedly asked the waiter to clean it up again, and turned to the balcony. I held back the remaining paper towel and asked the waiter to clean it up. I wonder if your waiters have not been trained, so obviously the paper towels on the balcony are not cleaned up? Hold on, I went to the bar on the first floor after dinner at night. I was really drunk. I ordered songs by myself, but there was no waiter in charge. As a result, the songs we ordered at the front were cut in line by the unqualified people. , kept putting their songs on the top, and we waited for over an hour without our turn, I was really convinced. Feedback to the bar brother, but there is no solution, forget it, can't you stop singing?
I went to have breakfast early the next morning, and I was shocked by the service of this five-star hotel. The two women at the door said that my child had to pay for breakfast. We booked a family room, so I asked if the family room was not allowed. Do you have children? The waiter said in a cold voice that our room only provides two breakfasts, and you have to pay for more than that. My little girl is only in the first grade of elementary school. Although she is 1.1 meters taller, the breakfast is like a kitten. Two mouthfuls of porridge and a sweet potato or something, this female goalkeeper insisted on paying for it, I am really, I lived in various five-star hotels in Qiandao Lake for the first time to pay this baby for breakfast, it really refreshed my understanding of Minghao cognition. Pay it, pay it, admit it. Well, just after entering the restaurant, I picked up the plate and wanted to pick up the first thing, and suddenly found a hair lying quietly in this ball. I accept it, and I accept nothing. I will accept my experience in Minghao. I really don’t know this. How did the five-star praise come out? I can only say that I admit it. You Minghao Hotel wants to check what I said, check it yourself. Don't call me to change the good reviews or anything, I won't change it.

一些美中不足，入住和退房都放在同樣的櫃枱，所以11點退房的時候有些擁擠，建議在退房時間分開獨立的櫃枱。房間可以看到湖景，但是沿着馬路，玻璃推門的隔音一般，早上車多的時候會比較吵。而且隔壁陽台的煙味會飄散過來，略微不舒服。
早餐品種豐富，晚餐自助餐也不錯，就是人實在太多了，車釐子和山竹經常一搶而空。
總體來説，算是千島湖高端酒店這一點毋庸置疑，還是值得推薦的。

酒店的中式設計漢白玉橋（裏面錦鯉超多），夜晚水幕秀也很出彩！

由於是自駕，下午3點多到的酒店，直接停在了酒店地下車位，有一排充電樁，電車可無憂充電，全時間段1.5元/度。-1層就是游泳館、健身房、遊樂園。上了一樓大廳見到了呂經理，全程協助並帶領進入房間。房間很大、2米大床房一家三口入住無壓力。小童拖鞋、小童洗漱用品一應俱全。呂經理又幫忙安排了湖邊騎車，絕對的給力，情緒價值方面覺得的拿捏住了。
酒店1樓大廳自助早餐種類繁多，第二天的環湖自駕就靠早餐的咖啡維持了。酒店出門對面就是湖邊觀景平台，落日餘暉晚霞美景盡收眼底。晚上酒店大堂水簾演示，户外水幕電影也很不錯，小孩子還是喜歡的。
第三天酒店小童樂園+餵魚，最終還送了伴手禮。整體入住體驗很不錯。

入住時因為提早到，週末本來人就多，管家David耐心協助我們入住登記，送行李，解釋流程和時間安排，還貼心地送小朋友禮品安撫等待，讓我們有多種方案渡過等待時間。出發前一天管家已經聯繫我，把酒店情況，交通路線，周邊設施飲食都推薦過來，非常周到。諮詢的問題都能迅速而準確地給出滿意的答覆，在入住前就能讓人獲得一份安心。入住期間也給了很多及時的幫助，確保我們的需求得到滿足。很舒服的是，客房打掃阿姨看到我們大熱天帶娃出門，主動送上幾瓶水和酒精棉片，很用心。

聽説酒店也有户外水上樂園，因為之前沒做過功課所以走之前才知道6月底開，以後再來吧。

酒店對小朋友很友好，除了小童樂園，水幕電影和大堂的水簾光影很受小朋友歡迎。週末還有各種親子娛樂活動，光泡酒店也不會無聊。

酒店對面就有觀景台，看日落人也特別多，跟天嶼不一樣的感受，還有環湖騎行道，酒店就有各種車型選擇，聯繫管家有驚喜福利。邊上過橋就是魚街，很多私房菜特色菜館選擇，很方便。去其他景區打車也比較近很方便。

建議是早餐餐廳的自助區域菜品可以再擺開點，用餐高峯可以不用擠在一堆取餐，菜品也能再豐富點就更好了。

衞生：衞生方面還可以吧。

酒店位置優越，三面臨湖，旁邊有碼頭，有餐飲街，非常方便。駛入酒店地庫後有保安一路指引，停車妥當後耐心等待我們整理並幫助我們搬運行李，酒店房間非常大，裝修設施維護較好，洗護用品品牌是寶格麗。早餐也非常豐富。
退住時還送我們伴手禮，正逢母親節，送了我們康乃馨和飲料。

msg:酒店的位置非常好，就在湖邊，離漁街很近，吃飯買東西非常方便。房間很大，管家leo小飛提前一天加了微信，告知各種訊息，幫忙給娃申請了早餐免費，並主動給了成人早餐的優惠，正好趕上生日入住，還給送了鮮花和蛋糕🎂到房間，意外驚喜。酒店早餐很豐富，中西餐和當地特色都有，自製酸奶很好喝，補餐非常及時，還能調製各種咖啡，高峯期用餐也沒有等位。客房服務也很棒，每天吃完早餐回來房間就已經收拾好了，需要的東西打個電話很快就送來了。還有娃最愛的遊樂場，很乾凈，一直有人在打掃，娃每天都要去，進去就不肯出來，親子活動也很豐富。住了四晚非常滿意，如果要説美中不足，就是這個親子觀湖房樓層太低，觀湖實在有點兒勉強😂

非要説缺點的話，就是泳池的水28-29度，這個季節還有點冷，遊了一會，太冷了受不了，孩子嘴脣都發紫了。
還有就是五一旺季，平台送的升房券沒用上，沒能住上湖景房，微微有點遺憾，留着下次再來吧～

沒開車，交通很方便，鎮中心步行可至，開車的移動半徑更大，叫滴滴也很快。
設施方面帶娃必定會去-1 的巨大小童樂園，乾淨空間大可玩性高。房間內該有的都有，寶格麗洗護牌子大不好用…掛衣架空間大好評。
服務反而是最好的部分，這點頗意外…管家小芬全程呵護，遇到一些小意外很貼心地幫忙安排，是連小朋友都喜歡的管家。遇到的其他所有工作人員都很友好且幫忙，不少似乎都喜歡小孩…難道這是親子酒店招聘要求？
附圖陽光很好的陽台，連狗狗都很快樂。感謝有小芬和明豪的完美假期。

酒店很適合親子帶娃。自帶的小童樂園很大很新很乾凈，工作人員一直在整理。感覺就是簡化版的奈爾寶。特別是海洋球，很乾凈沒有異味。小童樂園裡還有一塊小動物的天地，裏面的無毛河馬很可愛。對我主要就是能讓小月齡的孩子在酒店玩的開心的旅遊目的來説，我覺得已經很好了。
酒店會提供小童的牙刷和浴袍、拖鞋。酒店泳池也不是很冷，門口還可以借各種尺寸的泳圈。

位於負一樓的小童城一點都不像其他帖子説的陰暗潮濕，相反我覺得比洲際酒店的好很多了好吧！玩的設施多樣，小朋友玩的不亦樂乎！明豪是我之後還會二次三次多次選擇的一家酒店！

雖然硬件不錯，但是軟件服務還是有待提升。房間退房時間是11點不是正午，早上吃完飯就要退房，非常不方便。另外房間沒有咖啡機衹能送速溶上門這點比較奇怪。

小童樂園很大很大，能抵得上奈爾寶了，這點沒想到。原本預訂的小黃鴨主題房，但升級了湖景房，去樂園的時候説房間不包含，雖然最後沒有折騰我們而是小童樂園前台的小林直接解決了問題，但也覺得比較奇怪，因為看攜程預訂的所有房型都包含了小童樂園，幾大千訂的房間難道還不包括小童樂園嘛？樂園工作人員小黃非常認真負責，對小孩子友好，值得表揚！
另外日月西餐廳工作人員也不錯，因為下雨吃了兩晚自助餐，各方面都還不錯。
就是房型有點奇葩，進門正對洗漱台不是太方便，運氣不好一開門就能見到同房人在洗漱，很奇怪。其他都很好

B1有超大小童樂園，裏面還有可愛的小動物～真的適合遛娃
B1還有健身房和恆温泳池，小朋友游泳圈租金20元/個，家裡有的話可以自帶。泳池整體很乾凈～
酒店的房型，一種是面向千島湖、可看湖景（價格也略貴） ，另一種是面向酒店另一側，視野肯定沒有湖景好，但是也還不錯，性價比高些～

入住前一天，大堂副理大偉提前跟我聯繫，詢問了我的需求，並向我説明瞭我預訂的房型因陽台不是玻璃無法直接看湖，並主動為我升級了房型。入住當天又貼心告知我出行路線及費用，並親自為我們辦理入住、提行李送到房間，又贈送了免費的水吧，服務非常熱情，必須給大偉大大的好評！

説回酒店房間情況，房間很寬敞，足夠兩大一小住，窗户直面湖景，非常漂亮，房間裝修很新，衞浴設施很好用，按鍵切換出水方式，出水量很大，洗澡舒服，配置的洗護用品都是寶格麗的，以上種種足見酒店的品味。

總之，這是一次很滿意的入住體驗，以後住在中心湖區首選明豪。親們有住店需求記得找大偉😊

服務：服務挺貼心周到的，我們房間的管家小芬有求必應，響應非常及時迅速。小童遊樂區幾乎是我們住過的親子酒店的頂配了，孩子在裏面玩得不願意出來。小童樂園服務的黃阿姨也很友善，在海綿池裡一會兒幫孩子找襪子，一會兒幫大人找手機，照顧着每個人。

工作人員David安排的loft 位置也不錯，一樓就可以足不出户的觀看夜晚的水幕光影表演。

酒店所處的位置也很好，麪靠湖邊，離碼頭也不遠，1.6公里左右。 也處於城市中心，周圍餐飲購物也方便。 

酒店的中餐廳的很多菜品超乎預期，比大多數的五星酒店的好吃很多。呆了三天，光顧了三次。除了價格貴些，味道比旁邊魚街美食街的味道好太多。 

保持當前水準，這是家可以再次光顧的酒店。

入住前一天管家小汪就很貼心進行了入住確認，特地還幫我房間進行了升級，這點讓我很意外，以前衹以為民宿會有，沒想到酒店還有管家一對一提前對接。週五當天因為出發比較晚，從上海到千島湖自駕大概開了4個小時，到千島湖已經18:30，所以直奔先去吃飯了，等辦理入住的時候已經是晚上20:30了，雖然晚，管家小汪早早就幫我們安排好房間，入住時房間內都備好了水果！房間的裝修、空調都很不錯！特別誇一下浴缸，真的很大！泡澡很舒服，湖景房就是那種躺在床上看窗外湖景一覽無餘，特別治癒！超適合我這種泡酒店的人！補充一下，這邊的服務真的從一進酒店的保安指引，到B1停車場的指引，他們都是環環相扣，沒有遺漏的，讓人感覺特別舒服！第二天不是因為滿房了，我還想要再續住一天！這個不是旺季的時候還能滿房，大家應該能懂吧！退房的時候還送了伴手禮，我這個細節控被控到了，哈哈哈！贊哦！
最後還要特地再贊一下這次為我服務的管家小汪，服務超nice、細心、貼心，棒棒噠！

房間面朝千島湖，視野無遮擋，落日真的無敵漂亮。房間又大又乾淨，酒店配套也很不錯，小童樂園很大，還有室內泳池，户外的魚池有很多魚。
我的套餐裏沒有騎行，跟小芬管家説了後立刻幫忙安排了。退房時小芬特意來前台送行，並給小朋友們送了小禮物。以後有機會一定再來明豪。

入住的2晚，我們體驗了酒店的早餐和晚餐自助餐，感覺早餐很豐富，還有千島湖本地特色，晚餐238一個人，有海鮮小火鍋，性價比也很可以，對於不想出酒店的擺爛遊的我們非常合適。
帶孩子住酒店，首選親子酒店，當然要有一個夠大，夠乾淨的小童樂園啦，把孩子扔進去撒歡，寶貝們樂此不疲。
偷得浮生半日閑，孩子扔在樂園玩耍，我當然要在房間補個美容覺，躺在陽台上，靜靜看着湖邊的美景，放空發呆。
愛了愛了，下次還會再來，希望服務和衞生繼續保持哦！

辦理入住時就會添加管家，管家小歐很熱情，有問必答，過年期間有親子活動，小歐主動把流程圖發給我，整個酒店的工作人員態度都很好，主要酒店地理位置很好，到景點也很近。唯一美中不足就是過年期間 人多 早餐供應有點不及時 不過也能理解。
小朋友説還想續住，可惜時間不充裕，下次千島湖肯定再來玩～還是想住明豪。 特別誇一下 我們定的雙床房 可以合併起來 而且配了小孩子洗手盆 真不愧是親子酒店。

首先説一下服務，入住前一天，管家小田就悉心詢問達到時間，人員，並推薦了春節期間酒店安排的年俗活動，周邊景點，入住時，幫我們免費升級，小童洗護也準備齊全。給小田點贊（我們住其他酒店，一般都是打電話到前台詢問是否有小童拖鞋和洗護用品）。第二天，在我們吃早飯的時候，快速收拾整理好房間，這服務體驗感真棒。
再説一下酒店環境和設施，有個超級大小童樂園和游泳池，每天上午在大堂還安排了年俗活動，入住後的第二天適逢下雨，小朋友在酒店玩了一天，意猶未盡。很適合遛娃。
最後説一下飲食和周邊。早餐很豐富，有小童專區，有當地特色，看得出來很用心在準備。周邊風景不錯，餐館也很多。

剛剛到酒店時，外圍的一圈商鋪使我們捏把汗，看上去沒有度假酒店的氛圍啊，很不像五星級酒店，車子轉彎進去酒店內湖的大堂門口時總算安下心來😂衹能説外觀過於低調。
陽台景觀不錯，可惜隔着一條車水馬龍的路，酒店的優秀服務和豐富的娛樂項目完美彌補了這一缺陷。
餐廳出品優秀，是此行最好吃的早餐，有很多當地特色小吃，牛肉粉絲湯好好吃；中餐廳的魚頭湯比魚街的好喝，實話説我很後悔晚餐跑去魚街吃飯😂

入住前，管家大偉提前一天主動添加了微信，到店後，在春節期間還升級了房間，期間主動告知酒店各種活動，噓寒問暖，還贈送了延時退房。退房時，韓經理得知我們是晚上的高鐵，還特意引導我們到行政酒廊休息，安排了茶點，服務非常熱情。
酒店非常新，入住的湖景露台房景觀一流，泳池、健身房以及小童樂園能滿足一家人度假的各種需求，7樓行政酒廊的下午茶非常推薦，景觀無敵。酒店邊上就是漁街，吃飯非常方便。

msg:節前太忙了，沒時間做攻略，但又想帶爸媽出來放鬆一下，走走看看，臨時選擇了這家酒店，就在千島湖核心旅遊區，馬路對面就是核心湖景，出遊非常方便，環境也非常好，房間大，乾淨，視野開闊。最值得一提的是管家服務，我們的管家是小歐，他特別負責，在我出發前一晚，就打電話親自確認行程、需求、旅遊人員的年齡段等等，把一切可能需要的服務內容都提前有了準備，到了酒店，管家一直協助住宿、加床（我們5個人，加定一間不方便，有未成年青少年）等等事宜，還特地申請了春節加床免費，由於要確認加床位置，我們其餘4人就先去了酒店餐廳（到酒店已經7點多了，選擇在酒店餐廳用餐的），管家一直陪同我爸爸，安排好加床事宜，又親自把我爸送到餐廳（第一次來酒店，地方比較大，餐廳稍微有些難找），很是貼心，決定推薦大家入住這家酒店。

酒店自助餐真的不錯，很豐盛，雙十一買的自助餐優惠券真的超值。

很適合帶小朋友，酒店自帶的遊樂場很大，小朋友玩的很開心，游泳池人也不多，可以遊得很暢快，不過小朋友因為遊樂場玩得太開心了，帶了泳衣都沒去。酒店的錦鯉超大，可以去曬曬太陽，喂喂魚，很舒服。

酒店不愧是新酒店，房間很新，設施都不錯，適合度假。

酒店不錯，房間也挺大，設施都還挺新。酒店還有噴泉表演，水幕電影。小童遊樂場很大，小朋友玩的很開心。早餐也很豐盛。
點名表揚管家大偉，真的很貼心，送我們到房間，介紹設施，還送了minibar，幫我們延遲退房，有任何問題都可以找他。
想親子出遊的可以訂這家酒店，真心不錯。

總之 家人們讚不絕口，期待下次再相聚。

房間升級過，滿足了我們兩大兩小的空間需求。超大浴缸，孩子很喜歡。
酒店管家，加了微信，隨時聯繫，解決問題。
酒店乾淨亮堂，酒店外有小橋假山流水，行走舒適。水簾，水幕光影獨具酒店特色，咖吧書吧，有文化氣息。
早餐相當豐盛，時間點也比較晚，滿足睡眠需求。
千島湖之行，因為天氣原因，匆匆走了。如果再來，推薦入住。

房間設施:住過不少豪華酒店，明豪的床墊感覺背部承託的非常好。都想問問什麼牌子了。房間內為住店客所想到的貼心之處細節滿滿。真的真的非常用心。十分滿意。電視劇，衞洗麗，淋浴設備等都非常好。

房間景觀:湖景房電動窗簾打開的那一刻，一副極美的水墨畫映入眼簾。可惜天氣不好。如果晴天估計更美。還能看到落日。還有老鷹🦅在空中盤旋飛過!

服務:車子駛入的第一刻起，門口的師傅就非常禮貌熱情，歡迎入住幫忙指路，到達地下車庫也有人員指路。前台check in也很棒效率高，周到。還有管家服務。

本次三天兩晚家裡老小都很滿意。希望酒店保持啊~

msg:到千島湖來玩，習慣性想找一個舒適的酒店，看了很多家（喜歡看圖片和差評並從中辨別酒店的狀況），最後選擇了名豪國際度假酒店，沒有失望。
一，酒店房間面積比較大，陽台也大，空間舒適感很好。
二，房間很乾凈，床上用品，吹風機戴森，洗漱用品也是很好的品牌，使用舒適度比較高。
三，前台服務比較好，不管是入住還是退房，可以有比較好的服務感受。
四，送的下午茶挺豐盛，風景好。同時入住提示冰箱迷你吧裏麪食品可以免費。
五，位置比較好，離千島湖風景區開車四分鐘，步行也比較近。
六，停車很方便，早餐比較豐盛，有本地特色食品，中餐廳味道也不錯。
建議:前台電話最好能及時有人接聽，如果餐廳上菜速度快點就更好了。
總之，入住有非常不錯的體驗，以後來千島湖還會選擇該酒店。

特別提到酒店的管家大偉。大偉真的非常熱情，給人一種賓至如歸的感覺。他對酒店的各項設施和服務都瞭如指掌，總是能在第一時間滿足我的需求。
在我入住期間，大偉不僅為我提供了周到的服務，還為我提供了很多當地的旅遊建議和美食推薦，讓我的旅行更加豐富和難忘。
其次，我對房間的整潔和舒適印象深刻。床鋪十分舒適，房間的設施一應俱全，而且房間的裝飾也很有品味。

總之，我對這家酒店的體驗非常滿意，強烈推薦給大家！

我們是從上海自駕來的，一進來就有保安指引，這兩天天氣很冷，外面的保安凍的鼻子都紅了，但還是能夠很熱情的迎接我們。停到地下車庫，立馬就會有工作人員等在那兒指引我們停車，幫我們拿行李。行李比較多，工作人員也沒有抱怨，並且表示能為客人服務是他們的榮幸。在等電梯過程中，也會關心我們。入住手續也很簡單，行李幫我們送到房間，大偉貼心的為我們介紹房間設施，入住全程衹要想問都可以找他，他都會很熱心的幫助我們解決。
酒店的環境也很乾凈，隔音效果很好，機器人送餐、電視投屏都很便捷，對於來度假擺爛的人來説很合適，樓下就有特色魚頭、按摩，很適合放鬆。酒店還能夠借自行車🚲可以自由騎行。酒店早餐也很好吃，工作人員也都能夠微笑待人。
整體入住的體驗感非常好，值得推薦，希望春天再來還能夠訂到心儀的房間。

出發前一天，管家大偉加了微信聯繫，有困難有疑問能及時幫忙解決👍

小童城挺大的，可以充分放電，工作人員小方、小黃工作很認真，第一次看到擺得這麼整齊的沙坑玩具，而且都很顧着孩子安全，甚至比某些專心滑手機的家長靠譜。

房間設施很新，有小朋友洗手池好評！而且配品都不錯，不是一次性的便宜貨。

msg:這次酒店的性價比特別高，我們住的是海景房，住的非常舒服，本來是普通的雙床房，免費升級為含有一張1.8米大床和一張單人床的雙床房，關鍵是服務也非常好，值得一提的是管家大偉，不論是從需求還是從提供的服務來説，都是一級棒，酒店裡麪的需求隨叫隨到，還熱情的為我們推薦了吃和玩的小攻略，所以去千島湖玩，住明豪是最佳選擇，下次去了還住這裏

msg:入住前一天管家大偉就積極和我們溝通並添加微信，並告知酒店各種事項，讓我們出行有個充分準備，特別贊下管家大偉小夥子待人熱情、專業性強、素質高。入住期間遇到酒店的工作人員都是笑臉迎人，展現了酒店的專業性，早餐豐富品種眾多，口味適可。酒店的湖邊有個樂園面積大，游完東西眾多，小朋友玩得開心的不了，管理員小伍熱情好客、態度特別好，小朋友都喜歡她。這次千島湖之遊入住明豪感覺特別好，值得λ住。
