Dark green as the main color, brass lamps, intangible cultural heritage wood carvings, luxurious gold, ochre red and other wonderful retro color combinations. There are cow elements everywhere in it. The housekeeper said that it originated from the Chaozhou "鉎牛" culture, and the various shapes are deeply memorable. In addition, the service is very good, and many needs and room benefits can be customized by yourself. The local cultural experience also adds points to the hotel, and the fusion cuisine for dinner is also very colorful. In general, for friends who have requirements for travel accommodation, it is still worth experiencing!

After arriving at the site, the hotel style is basically the same as the online promotion, and the design is indeed very unique. From the room equipment, butler service, local activities of Chaozhou culture, etc., it can be seen that the hotel is thoughtful and attentive. The hotel also has SPA services. When you are tired from playing, you can just come to the SPA and relax. It is worth recommending!

The butler's service attitude is very good, just right enthusiasm and considerate greetings. The tea room was also equipped with my favorite drinks and snacks when I checked in, and bird's nest warm soup was also delivered in the evening. How can you not drink tea when you come to Chaozhou? The tea room is equipped with a tea table and tea sets, so you can relax and drink tea. After a night's rest, I followed the butler on a food hunt the next morning, walked around the streets of the ancient city, and ate a lot of local specialty snacks. This activity is worth recommending! Convenient to travel!

I heard that the predecessor was renovated from a Chaozhou depar**ent store. Let's talk about the service. The housekeeper contacted me promptly to find out my specific arrival time, and also informed me about the parking problem here. He also reminded me of the situation on Archway Street that day. He provided considerate and enthusiastic service from before and after check-in. I stayed in the Tea Room. The whole room is mainly green and gold, which is more luxurious. It is equipped with a Kungfu tea table, where you can drink tea comfortably. The small items in the guest rooms are low-key, exquisite and ingenious. Minibar, fruits and snacks are all equipped, the hair dryer is from Dyson, the bedding is clean and comfortable, bird's nest warm soup is delivered in the evening, and there are various types of breakfast to choose from. The whole experience is very satisfying. Just outside the door is Paifang Street, which is very convenient for visiting scenic spots.

The hotel has a unique design with very rich contrasting colors. There are many Chaozhou cultural decorations inside, including wood carvings, bridges, lanterns, Guangji Bridge models, etc. The guest rooms can be customized. Not long after the order was placed, the housekeeper sent a check-in questionnaire. After arriving at the store, he enthusiastically helped deliver the luggage to the guest room and walked around the hotel to experience the design concept. Then, drinks and fruit snacks are arranged in the room. It is a tea ceremony-themed room, so it is equipped with a Kung Fu tea table, so you can drink tea comfortably. Just outside the hotel is Archway Street, which is very close to Guangji Bridge and Zhenhai Tower. It's a good place to watch the light show there at night. Anyway, this stay is worth the price.

After looking at several hotels, I finally chose this hotel with a good reputation in Chaozhou. My experience after staying was consistent with the reviews I saw. The butler's service was very good. After filling out the check-in questionnaire, the room was arranged according to what I filled out. The guest room has a coffee machine, Gongfu tea set, a rich minibar, and fresh fruits. The most eye-catching thing in the room is the soaking pool. It's really big. It's very comfortable to watch a drama while eating fruit. The cultural activity was Teochew opera, and I also experienced the feeling of putting on costumes. In the morning, I ate a lot of authentic snacks with the housekeeper. My favorite was rice rolls and candied scallion pancakes. The taste of the pancakes is very unique. The mung bean pancakes were so delicious that I didn’t have time to buy them before I left. The butler even helped buy them for me, which was so considerate.

The only thing is that the extra bed is not very stable. As soon as the old man sat on it, it turned over completely. It was very dangerous. It would be better not to let the old man sleep in the extra bed next time.

But at this price, it is really not worth it; it is deep in the bustling city and has a superior location. Wrong, but it is also noisy; the breakfast seems to be diverse, but in fact it is too simple; there is a gap between it and the brand five-star hotel. Send a message in advance, it seems caring, but in fact it is to arrange check-out earlier, don't affect your next order ; After checking out, the invoice will not be given to you without reminders. Do not go to the hotline tourist attractions during holidays. I will definitely not choose it next time. If you do more homework, you will definitely get twice the result with half the effort.

Because of the electronic lock, the privacy of the guests is also well protected. Breakfast can be delivered to the room, the bath is very clean, and there is bird's nest good night tea in the evening, which is delicious. There are many service activities in the hotel, including watching Teochew operas, taking photos, making red peach barley, making Teochew porcelain, and watching Kung Fu tea. As long as guests are willing, they can avoid the crowds and experience Teochew culture. However, the shortcomings are also obvious. Due to traffic control, guests' cars have to be parked in a parking lot far away. No matter how expensive your suitcase is or how many large luggage you have, you still have to queue up with ordinary tourists to wait for the tourist shuttle bus, and then the luggage is thrown on For the shuttle bus, you pay per head. Although the hotel paid for the shuttle bus, the experience was very poor. The queue time was long and the luggage was heavy. The hotel customer service was good, but if you paid a very expensive price to book a hotel, you should have a hotel shuttle bus. Please study hard with Sanya.

It was renovated from an old depar**ent store and is now a "Drama Museum Hotel". Sure enough, the entrance is the stage: emerald, royal gold, Forbidden City red, Hermès orange, paired with glass, crystal, brass, wood carvings, painted lacquer paintings, etc., with rich colors and complex elements.
Chaoshan decorative art is handed down in an orderly manner, but it is not organized in such a pile. Just like "Colorful Clouds Chasing the Moon" or "The Most Dazzling Ethnic Style", which one is more ethnic? I checked the information and found that it was designed by Hong Zhongxuan. There are a lot of titles on the Internet. The representative work is the club on the top floor of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Okay.
But having said that, the hotel is in an excellent location, with Guangji Bridge and Kaiyuan Temple within walking distance. And the service is quite good, breakfast, fruits, snacks, drinks, pillow experience, etc. can be customized. Teochew opera, Dai Banquet, and street breakfast are great points.
Overall, it is still a hotel worth experiencing in the ancient city of Chaozhou, especially for those who like liveliness.

There is a large-scale traffic restriction in the ancient city. Self-driving parking is 2 kilometers away. You need to transfer to a shuttle bus to get to the water. Then walk a short distance to the hotel. If the weather is hot, it will be very sunny. If it rains, it will be very troublesome to carry luggage. 2: It's very noisy. It's still very noisy outside at 12 o'clock during the National Day. It may affect people who have poor sleep. There are always sanitation trucks next door, and there is always a smell when going out. 3: The hotel is a depar**ent store renovated, taking the small boutique route, but it also has relatively few overall facilities. The hotel has arranged some activities, Teochew opera, tea tasting, etc., but overall it is really not suitable for bringing children, and is more suitable for couples. 4: The outing and tasting activities are considered innovative, but they are relatively perfunctory for guests dining in the hotel. The five set meals have relatively little content, not many varieties, and the taste is mediocre, and overall very weak. There are also advantages, the location is very central, the hotel design is luxurious but not plain, and the supplies are not very good. As the best hotel in eastern Guangdong, there is a long way to go. Choose your holidays carefully.

msg:The room with a price of more than 2800 is small and cannot be turned around. There is a large swimming pool in the room, which makes it even more compact. I bumped into it several times and had to move the chair away before walking. The overall decoration design of the hotel is green and looks quite high-end. The shampoo and conditioner is Hermès, but there is only one set. It is not enough for a girl to wash her hair. I asked the waiter to get it, but the waiter said, ah? Don’t you already have a set? Want more? Extremely uncomfortable. The fruit for breakfast was spoiled. I asked the waiter to come in and close it. He said that it had been reported and there was nothing more to say. It was really inappropriate for a hotel like this. As for being so reluctant to throw away such a small piece of fruit, it was 280. hotel? At the final checkout, I charged 80 for the child's breakfast. The next day, my child went to participate in an activity to make colored porcelain, but he didn't come back at 12 o'clock. I was asked to check out at 12 o'clock on time. I said that it would only take 20 minutes until the child came back. The waiter said, no, it's time. I asked her how to get the luggage. , she replied, asking me to pack everything and wait on the first floor. I was really speechless.

It took 2 hours to wait for the pool to be filled with water. Arch Street 9 Cars can pass freely before 1 p.m., and there are no restrictions against honking. It affects resting after 6 p.m., there is no privacy in the bathroom and bathtub, the table for watching TV is a wooden bench, and the opposite side of the curtains is a residential building, which is not suitable for family travel, plus The bed fee is 350 yuan, and the guest surcharge is an additional 80 yuan per person. The hotel does not have any facilities except breakfast, and the breakfast is not good. It is cold. It is recommended to eat outside.

辦理好入住，管家會把行李送到客房。因為入住會提前填寫問卷，所以客房裡配備的東西，都是提前選好後酒店配齊的，minibar配的東西挺豐富的，咖啡、茶、酒飲都有，泡池感受和評論裏得到的訊息一樣，超級大，感覺能容納2-3個人，還配了入浴劑舒服的泡個澡。早上跟着管家去古城尋味，吃了很多潮州本地小吃，一趟下來吃撐了，午飯都沒吃，太滿足了。值得推薦！

位置就是離步行街很近挺方便的，李停車場有點遠，每次找不到酒店都會有人來接，服務周到，提前加好微信，到停車場去接，幫拿東西，有個小男孩服務很好。
説是給我們升了房型，估計古建築的緣故房間不大，天然石材接觸起來都很舒服（洗澡和泡澡的地方。）
住了兩天第一天是在外面吃早餐，挺有意思的，體驗感比較好，帶我們去的小姐姐服務也很好，第二天在酒店吃的，感覺整體早餐一般，提前打了電話確認時間卻也比説的時間完了一刻鐘。

雖然沒有氣派的五星級酒店大堂，但辦理入住過程完勝，坐在沙發上喝着茶就可以享受完入住確認。
我們帶中娃（7歲）入住的房間大床2米，3個人躺毫無問題，床邊的超大浴缸適合親子，個性化的mini bar服務，酒店的特色贈飲，暖心入眠飲品（燕窩）都透露着低調的奢華，不露聲色的高檔。
酒店的地址絕佳，牌坊區的核心地段，下樓即是逛吃逛的節奏，廣濟橋、開元寺都步行幾分鐘可達，大熱天逛完了景點，逛一下就回到酒店休整一番，入夜後再去領略夜晚的牌坊風光實在是美。

值得一提的酒店的潮汕粵融合私房菜，主廚有心了，嚐遍了廣東美食的我們很少吃到這樣的，每一道都驚艷，創新的味道融合了傳統食材的鮮美，味蕾跳動，回味久遠。

店內的服務也是五星水準，出入均有工作人員的照顧，電話那頭對服務的響應永遠及時，微信的私人管家式聯繫服務也非常到位。

如果來潮州玩，牆裂推薦這家御酒店，五星的設備五星的服務五星的美味，棒棒噠！

酒店本身有努力地提供服務，房間類似於悦榕莊的悦心池房型，但是房間太小，硬傷太明顯。

按個人經驗，作為小眾酒店，房間在800-1200/夜勉強能接受（主要是地段好），與奢華酒店相去甚遠。

我也是被網上評論忽悠來拔草。
