The temperature of the hot water in the room (bath/shower) is also just luke warm, but not unpleasant. One can use the laundry room to wash clothes and the beaches and shops are walking distance from the hotel. The Western Sanye hotel is absolutely wonderful. Great food and not overpriced. Wonderful deck view of the bay.

msg:This time I stayed in the Bailu Mountain View Terrace King Room of Tomaya¬∑Shenzhen Buruolin Resort B&B.
The overall environment of the hotel is clean, the rooms are large in size, and the entrance faces the inner garden. It feels clean and comfortable, and it is very suitable for couples to spend two days away from home.

The bed in the room is large, but the sleep is not very comfortable. It may be due to personal sleep quality problems. When it rains in the early morning, the sound of rain hitting the machine on the other side of the room also affects sleep.
It is commendable that the hotel is equipped with complete supplies, and the supplies are all high-end, such as acqua di parma bath sets and dyson hair dryers.
The package chosen this time includes breakfast, afternoon tea, evening dessert and photography services. The food and drinks are pretty good, and it‚Äôs obvious that the B&B has put a lot of thought into it.
The photography service relieves your boyfriend of a lot of burdens. The photographer is very professional and will teach you how to pose. He will also send you all the photos after taking them, and he will add five more to help you refine them.
It is worth mentioning that the B&B has a butler service who can arrange all activities for you in advance, and the staff is also very hospitable upon arrival.
There are generally more mosquitoes in the mountains. There is a mosquito repellent device in the room, which not only provides a delicate fragrance, but also helps to repel mosquitoes. But the location here is relatively remote. We booked a sea view restaurant of the same group for dinner that night, but the hotel did not provide any shuttle bus to the restaurant, and because it was too remote, it was not easy to take a taxi, so in the end we had to walk For the sea view restaurant on the upper half of the mountain, it is recommended that the hotel add golf carts to transport diners from the hotel to the restaurant. Those who are interested can travel by car, and there are parking spaces outside the hotel.

The room was spacious and bright, and the quality of various supplies was good. The air conditioner was very quiet at night, although there was a little cold wind blowing on the head.
Breakfast was rich in content for each person, the afternoon tea cake tasted good and was rare not too sweet, and the sweet soup at night was not repeated. The taste and quantity of the restaurant dishes were satisfactory.
The butler service was very thoughtful and meticulous, and would ask in advance about the next day's dietary arrangements. I made a few suggestions for improving the hardware, and they wrote them down and said they would improve them in the future. I hope that they will be different if I stay in the future.
I experienced all the special projects, including a photographer taking beautiful photos for 30 minutes & 5 refined photos, good night sweet soup, and aromatherapy as a souvenir.

The first thing to say is the service. I originally booked Tianlu Miyue for my birthday, but Miyue forced me to leave in anger. The service level is far worse than before (the housekeeper didn't reply to messages for a long time, there was no one on duty at the front desk at night, the breakfast I ordered was not delivered to the room until 11 o'clock in the morning, and when I left, he looked arrogant and didn't help with the luggage when the elevator was broken, etc.) After a quarrel with Miyue, I refunded and moved to this place. There is no comparison, no harm. As soon as I arrived here, I was told that I could upgrade the room type for free on my birthday, and the replies in the group were instant. I got up later than the normal breakfast time the next morning, and they asked the restaurant to make rice noodles for us 
Let's talk about their room soft furnishings. They are all five-star standards. The mattress is super comfortable, the hair dryer is dyson, the toiletries are Acqua di Parma, and the sound insulation is also super good 
There is a small hill and a small forest behind the B&B. It's so comfortable to climb the hill in the morning 
In general, it's really good value for money. I will try their other stores next time. It's worth it

Even though the room is a little smaller, the view outside the bathtub window is picturesque and very relaxing. The most regrettable thing is that there is a very serious disadvantage, which is their privacy. Extremely low! Almost every unit can also see the activities of people in the opposite room from the window! During the entire bathing process, the curtains on the terrace must be closed. There is no ventilation and it becomes a dark room, greatly reducing the view! The two rooms on the other side of the swimming pool are directly opposite each other. The design flaws are so big that there is nothing to say... For a hotel with such high requirements for receiving guests' rest and overall aesthetics, this is an absolutely unacceptable shortcoming. What a pity!

msg:The staff seemed to be all young and handsome guys and beauties. They were very attentive and enthusiastic, and the service was very good. From the moment I got off the bus, the housekeeper came out to help with my luggage. I heard that I was going to pick up a friend from the hospital and asked if I needed help with my friend‚Äôs leg. We were injured and had difficulty moving, so the hotel restaurant made an exception and sent us meals to our room, only telling us to pay attention to oil stains. I packed breakfast in the morning when I was in a hurry...

The room facilities are also very good. The toiletries provided are Aqua de Parma, the hair dryer is Dyson disposable toothbrush, and various small supplies are very good. The windows in the room are large during the day, and the sunlight shines on the gauze curtains. The branches are shadowed and the leaves rustle in the wind. , I stayed in the hotel, took a bath, drank afternoon tea and took a nap. The stay was very comfortable and relaxing.

Below are some photos taken by the hotel for free ‚ù§Ô∏è

My little boy is actually very naughty. He threw small stones all over the yard, but the service staff was not annoyed at all and was full of kindness.

The bedding is comfortable, but a little thick, but the temperature in Shenzhen is hard to predict when it gets cold or hot.
When I soak in the bathtub during the day, I can see beautiful tree shadows outside the window, which makes me happy.
The back mountain is beautiful, with wild charm and carambola trees. I picked some carambola and it was delicious.
On the contrary, it is Sapphire Beach, with many people and average sand.

It is a suitable choice for vacation.

There is a constant temperature swimming pool, and there are lychees and longans in the back mountain. This time it was not in time for the picking season, so it is very suitable for parents and children, and family gatherings. It takes about ten minutes to walk down the mountain to reach the first sandy beach in South Australia and Sapphire Beach. The housekeeping team is great. Before and after check-in, they provide timely and meticulous suggestions for dining and surrounding entertainment. My family likes it very much!

I am afraid that the soft furnishings will be watered down and the service is difficult to standardize. This time I just left at the last minute, but I didn't expect that a rational person like me could not help but "wow" and change my stereotype. Only thatch is fine. Thank you for your hard work, being able to accompany me attentively, being quiet and not disturbing, always being there for anything, meeting individual needs, and making it worth relaxing after every busy day. The only thing I forgot was to ask the name of our classmate who served us at the front desk. Highly recommended.

As a high-end B&B, the air conditioner does not cool down, and it is summer in Shenzhen for most of the year. After taking a shower and blowing my hair, I was sweating... The staff reported the situation and brought a refrigerator. The room is a bit small and there is no view from the room

msg:The hotel is built against the lychee forest on the top of the mountain, and the parking lot is right in front of the B&B. When entering the B&B, you first pass by their external seafood restaurant, then go uphill to the B&B lobby.

The room is spacious and tidy, with a special geometric structure of the ceiling and reasonable circulation design. The mattress is slightly soft and the bedding is comfortable. The shower head has strong water pressure and plenty of water. It is equipped with Parmesan water for cleaning and care. It is very comfortable to take a bath. It has a Dyson hairdryer, so you can wash your hair without pressure. The bathtub comes with a bathtub cover. There is a hot water kettle and special water for making tea. There is no coffee machine. It comes with manner hanging ears and twg tea bags, a small refrigerator with 3 kinds of soft drinks, small biscuits and fruits.

Set breakfast is delicious.

You can go up the mountain along the trail from the lobby of the B&B to the viewing platform and look out at the sea.

Service: The housekeeper will contact you one day in advance, and the air conditioner will be turned on to adjust to a comfortable temperature before check-in. Helped me make a reservation at Tomaya Cliff Restaurant. There are good night desserts.

Facilities: The resting sofas by the swimming pool are a little dirty on the edges. They may be damp and prone to mold. There are some floating objects in the swimming pool and we did not go into the water out of caution.

I have always been unimpressed with B&Bs. I feel that the service and facilities are not up to date. I was not satisfied with the ones I stayed in before, and the price was too high. But this time staying at Buruolin B&B has changed my mind a lot. First of all, when you arrive at the B&B, the butler is waiting at the door. The work of guiding, luggage service, and introducing B&Bs is already better than DoubleTree by Hilton. Secondly, the B&B facilities are not only elegant in design but also highly functional, thanks to the fact that the facilities have just opened in good condition. Thirdly, the supporting toiletries of the homestay are complete, and the welcome fruit, good night sweet soup, and breakfast set are in place, and there are no shortcomings. Finally, the homestay housekeeper specially set up a WeChat group, and introduced everything from vehicle restrictions to surrounding attractions carefully, and the group responded quickly to any questions. Bu Ruolin B&B is the most satisfying of the B&Bs I have stayed in in the past five years, and I look forward to staying again.

The room is not big, the color matching is very comfortable, clean, and the equipment is very new and easy to use, but the newly renovated wall paint is not detailed enough. 3. In the restaurant of the hotel, I ordered non-seafood, the taste is relatively light, the ingredients are fresh, and the air volume is moderate. 2 people, 3 cases, 1 case of soup + half a dozen dim sum, I can't finish it. When I checked out, I found that the appetizers were charged. 4. If you want to go to the beach, you can walk for more than ten minutes, but you must go up the hillside. Go up from the Seaview Silver Beach B&B. The view is much wider, and the sea breeze is blowing in your face. It is comfortable. The parking lot is actually designed under the hillside , the beach is extremely small and poorly planned. 5. Drive to the beach of Xichong for half an hour. 6. There is a hill in the hotel, and a camping platform is designed. When the weather is cool, it should be quite comfortable to drink tea, chat, play cards and camp in the hotel.

First of all, the toiletries, TV audio equipment, and hair dryer in the homestay are all at the level of a five-star hotel. As soon as you check in, there is welcome fruit, drinks in the mini bar are free to drink, and tremella soup is available at night. The bed is also very soft and comfortable. I think the homestay looks much better than in the photos. I like the decoration style very much. The pool and swimming pool are also clean.
The hotel's service is also in place, responsive. We wanted some ice cubes and gave us a big bucket. The swimming pool was closed early at night and told the housekeeper to reopen it for us to play. The transparent boat in the swimming pool is very fun!
The most important thing is that the breakfast in the homestay is really big. The pearl grouper and squab in their restaurant are delicious, better than some seafood restaurants in South Australia, and the soup is also delicious. This time I had a good time I am happy that the whole process was very comfortable. I also gave body lotion when I left the store. Next time I go to Nan'ao, I will go to Tomaya!

The whole homestay is in the mountains and forests, very peaceful. The decoration can also be seen to be very careful.
Service: The butler service is also very good, the staff are very enthusiastic and respond quickly.
Meals: I think breakfast is OK, and dinner is also eaten in a Chinese restaurant. The price is normal and the taste is OK. You can order ** takeaway.
Location: Probably because it is in the mountains and forests, the location is still a bit biased, and there is nothing to do around. It is 1.3 kilometers to the first beach of Nan'ao, and there is a small Nanbao Beach nearby, but because it is a bit troublesome to drive there, I finally decided to stay at the hotel Play.
Nearby projects: There is a 30-minute follow-up shoot, and there are also some clothes to choose from. The clothes are quite OK and very new. Although I didn't change clothes, it was just a natural snapshot. I think this service is also very good!

msg:The most comfortable hotel I have stayed in so far! ! In addition to the sound insulation is slightly worse
In addition, one last thing to mention about the dishes in the restaurant
The drunken crab is too bad,,, the Huadiao wine was heated without adding a little rock sugar, which caused the taste of the crab to be covered, and the original taste of the crab could not be tasted at all, and the strong Huadiao wine exploded like a bomb in my cavity.. It was a bit difficult Accept... (The proportion of Huadiao wine is not very good, the right amount of rock sugar can increase the thickness of the drunk crab)
Shrimp balls should be the worst dish I have ever eaten tonight... If fresh prawns are used with salad dressing... I think it is too perfunctory and wasteful.. I can't just focus on the presentation, and the side dish is also a salad The sauce will lead to a single style of the cuisine. It is recommended to soak the shrimp balls in salt ice water after taking the meat. After absorbing the water, add some xo sauce and stir-fry for a few sides. Drizzle a little cognac before serving, which is better than matching with salad dressing.

Even if three people get together, it will not affect each other's washing; Dyson's hair dryer is a light luxury homestay The standard configuration; Marshall's removable Bluetooth speaker can satisfy the music experience when resting in the room, taking a bath in the bathroom, drinking tea and reading in the courtyard; the Shanghai-style retro kettle is something I like and have not bought;

Hygiene: The overall experience of hygiene is better. The bed cover is made of light and thin hemp material, which will not fall off the ground as easily as satin material, and it feels more hygienic.

Environment: The hotel is independent of the mountainside, with a natural oxygen bar. There is a kind of quietness isolated from the world. When there is a little rain, you can lie on the bed and watch the mountains and listen to the rain. You can listen to the cello and guqin with the Marshall bluetooth speaker. The spiritual infiltration of words.

Service: The butler provides one-on-one service. From the moment of departure, the butler provides one-on-one service and responds quickly. After getting off the car, the butler will receive and explain the hotel's facilities and activities. The recommended places are very good, both in terms of scenery and food;

Catering: This is something I must praise, because my body has not recovered after the A-flu, and I am very weak, so I choose to come here to cultivate my body and mind. The price-performance ratio of the hotel's meals is very high for a person who likes to eat Cantonese and Chaoshan dishes! I haven't eaten more than one bowl of rice for a long time. I ate a bowl and a half of rice and a big bowl of soup for a serving of pork belly with scallion oil that night.

I will go next time!

The B&B is built on the mountain. The overall style is fresh and modern. The brand of bathroom and toilet is commendable. The most surprising thing is the outdoor heated swimming pool, which can still be enjoyed in January weather. There is a small mountain behind the hotel. You can take your baby to climb the mountain in the morning. The whole journey takes about half an hour. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel has delicious dinner and the price is very affordable. You can walk to the seafood market and the pier, and you can go to the first beach in ten minutes by taxi. The sand is fine, there are not many people, and the weather is good. It is really a perfect end to our trip to Shenzhen. Long-winded sentence: The coffee in the lobby bar is very fragrant and delicious!

It is a pity that the time relationship was not wasted this time.

suggestion:
1. The signboard turning into the small road can be designed to be more recognizable in color (the first time I went through the intersection)
2. In my impression, there is no smart toilet seat, so there is no heating function, which is just needed in winter.
3. Increase the text version of warm reminders for room facilities, not just the housekeeper's introduction.

This time I came to Shenzhen to play, I want to relax and let my impetuous self be quiet.
I recommended this homestay through a friend's introduction, Tomaya¬∑Buwakabayashi.
The location is located in a small forest near Nan'ao Street, Dapeng New District (personal feeling), hidden in the forest. It takes about two hours to drive from downtown Shenzhen, so the traffic is very convenient.
When the sky is clear, I feel much better. Brew a pot of tea in the small courtyard of the room, and slowly enjoy a moment of tranquility, leisurely and leisurely.
The decoration style of the homestay is very beautiful and attractive, and it is said to be from the hands of masters. No wonder there are many young ladies here to take pictures and check in.
The supporting facilities in the room are complete, it should be said that everything is available üòÑ
The housekeepers, sisters and brothers are very enthusiastic, and will introduce some things about the homestay.
The sanitation of the guest rooms is also relatively clean. It can be seen that they are very attentive.
There will be fruit supplements every day, which I prefer, because I prefer to eat fruits. üòÄ
It is also very close to the beach from here, and those who like to swim can also take a swim in their heated swimming pool. After all, the taste of sea water is not good,,‘æ^‘æ,,
When you get up in the morning, you can also climb the small hill behind.
After staying for a few days, I still feel very good, quiet and comfortable environment, warm and hospitable people.

Hygiene: very clean

Environment: The homestay is located in a lychee forest. It is built along a small hill. There are also many entertainment venues. There is a mid-level activity platform and a super beautiful constant temperature swimming pool. Various activities can also be held by the pool. In the morning, the air is also very fresh. At night, you will not hear various sounds of closing and opening doors, and the sound insulation from the outside world is very good.

Service: The service attitude of the hotel staff is very good, they will be very considerate and provide what we need in a timely manner. He will also patiently answer our various questions. And there is also sweet soup in the evening, which is very considerate.
Catering: The B&B has its own restaurant, about 300 per capita, but the products are very good.
The only thing I would like to suggest is that the signboard from the road turning into the B&B is too small. Our cars missed the intersection perfectly. I hope the signage can be made more eye-catching next timeüòâ

msg:Let me talk about the conclusion first, there is no doubt that the ceiling of Shenzhen homestay.
The B&B is located on a hill close to the seaside of Nan'ao, very close to the main road, but occupies a small hillside, and the location is superior. There is a forest trail that goes around the B&B, so it‚Äôs very interesting to walk around when you have nothing to do.
There is nothing to say about the design and hardware of the homestay. Compared with other Internet celebrity homestays that are only suitable for taking pictures and punching cards, it is not at the same level. It can be seen that they have put their heart into it. The only disadvantage is that because of the barrier-free design, the water in the bathroom is very dirty when taking a shower. It is easy to flow outside and make the ground wet.
The temperature of the swimming pool is constant, which is great. The children went swimming in the rainy weather in November, and they were very happy. The uncle who manages the swimming pool is also very stylish. He took the initiative to help us get bath towels in case we caught cold, and his enthusiasm was just right.
In addition, I feel that the training related to service awareness in the store can be further strengthened. For example, the package purchased includes afternoon tea, but it is already dinner time, and it is only provided after I ask; The guests did not take the initiative to say hello after walking to meet each other. After all, the positioning and price are placed here, which makes people have this expectation.
The products produced by the restaurant are as everyone said, the taste is good, and the price is very high. I ordered a few dishes casually and didn't feel bad.
In short, there is still room for further improvement, but the flaws are not hidden, everyone is very happy to live, it is a place that will be missed after leaving, and will definitely go back.
I wish better and better.

He thoughtfully pointed out the path up the mountain and the approximate time it would take to reach the viewing point, So sweet! The breakfast is very rich. After eating, the waiter in the restaurant will greet you warmly and ask if we are full. During this vacation, I experienced two stores in Tomaya. Fuwakabayashi may be more popular because it is relatively new, and I am more willing to recommend Fuwakabayashi to relatives and friends.

msg:A Surprising and Lucky Journey - Tomiya ¬∑ Buruolin

During the last vacation, I inadvertently passed by a restaurant that seemed out of tune with the surrounding environment. Curiosity drove me to go in. Later, I found out that it turned out to be a homestay with a unique flavor - Tomiya ¬∑ Weiminghai. After our visit, we decided to explore on the 11th holiday. In the follow-up exploration, we found that there was Tomiya ¬∑ Buruolin, which was newly opened this year, and decided to book a room.


I have seen a lot of photos and reviews on Little Sweet Potato and Ctrip, and I am full of expectations for the homestay. I chose to travel off-peak during the 11th holiday, and the overall comfort is full. After arriving, the whole view is the panoramic view of the homestay standing on the mountain. In the afternoon, the overall environment is covered by the lazy afternoon sun, and the quiet and comfortable feeling of escaping from the city hits like waves. There is a housekeeper to carry luggage and give directions throughout the arrival, including various check-in guides and guidance on surrounding facilities, which is very considerate.

After staying in the room, I am even more pleasantly surprised. The overall environment is comfortable and clean, and the layout and design of the room are highly online. The scenery of the three sides of the floor-to-ceiling glass completely presents the mountains and the sea in front of the eyes. The beauty cannot be described in words, and the whole person relaxes. During the period, I also felt the warm hospitality of the friends of the homestay. I liked this a**osphere very much, drinking, chatting and welcoming the sunset together.

Very wisely, I chose to travel off the peak. There were no other guests in the first two days. The whole environment was quiet and peaceful, and the scenery at night was also very colorful. The combination of light and darkness is very beautiful. There are also photography services (forgive my little trash photography skills), and friends who like to take pictures and do not want to take pictures are highly recommended to go, and the pictures are abnormal!

The overall check-in experience is full, not looking forward to the next encounter, but also looking forward to the surprise of the new store, must be collected!

2. Just playing in the homestay, watching the sea and the mountains, the scenery is unique, and I took a lot of photos.
3. The wind is cool at night, and you can see the stars when you look up. Remember to close the windows and doors, there are a few small bugs, but there is no problem with closing the doors and windows.
4. The restaurant tastes unexpectedly good and the price is reasonable. We recommend pigeon, cowboy bone and dry fried beef. The only downside is that there are too many people for breakfast, and it takes a long time to wait. It is recommended to eat early.
5. I like Huawei TV and Marshall stereo the most. Connected to Bluetooth, it has the same a**osphere as a five-star hotel. There are also skylights on the roof, blue and white are intertwined, you can watch for a long time in a daze. Oversized washbasin, comfortable bathtub, and Dyson, orange-flavored water of Parma hand sanitizer... Satisfied!

msg:The homestay hidden in the lychee forest is very comfortable, suitable for vacation and relaxation, and the mountain pool is surprising. The design is based on the natural wabi-sabi aesthetics. The facilities and services are very good. The restaurant tastes good, the ingredients are fresh, and the price is very high. It is worth experiencing.

msg:The experience was very good. The housekeeper had already contacted us in advance to help us arrange the itinerary, and was very careful. The room facilities are very good. The water of Palma is used, which smells so good. This place is especially suitable for two or three days of vacation. The facilities of the homestay are also very complete, including swimming pools, restaurants, bars, and a camping area. Looking forward to it! will stay in the future

msg:I have always liked to live in a homestay with a sense of a**osphere. I just wanted to go on a trip these days and I didn‚Äôt want to visit this ceiling homestay in Shenzhen. The facilities and equipment of the homestay are amazing to me. There are Dyson hair dryers that even five-star hotels don‚Äôt have. Toiletries are all available, the independent balcony to watch the sunset, the privacy is not too good, there is mainly a large swimming pool, it is a little kid's paradise, the butler service is also very thoughtful, on call, a homestay like Shenzhen is really unique, very advanced!

msg:I stayed at Tomakana Wakabayashi B&B again, and I feel that compared with the last time, it has greatly improved.
The butler service is very attentive, and the butler informed us to drive the car to the front desk of the hotel. In this hot summer, let's reduce the chances of getting tanned.
We were guided through the check-in process. Take us to the reserved room, and carefully introduce the equipment and facilities of the room, as well as the value-added services provided by the homestay.
Welcome fruit was prepared for us, and soft drinks were prepared in the refrigerator. There are Fat Boyshui and Zhenzhen.
Facilities: The supporting facilities in the room are relatively complete, and the bedding is the standard configuration of a five-star hotel. The toiletries are also branded Eau de Palma.
In the evening, sweet soup is also prepared. In the service group, I will ask the guests if they need it, and if necessary, it will be delivered to the room as soon as possible. If you eat in a restaurant, it will be delivered there. As long as the customer needs it, it will be delivered.
There is also a swimming pool in the homestay, which is open for homestays. It is very friendly for beginners.
There is an orchard behind the homestay, where you can pick lychees, yellow skins, and longan. It is also provided free of charge to staying guests. You can also take a little bit away.
There are a lot of people taking pictures here, as well as filming.
It is especially suitable for ladies who like to take pictures. If you like quiet people, you can choose here. Get away from the hustle and bustle and let yourself relax.
