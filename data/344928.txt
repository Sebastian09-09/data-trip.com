msg:Loved this hotel! Room was fantastic, nice view of the sea and great bathtub. Resort is beautiful, pool is great and as it was cold I had the whole top tier of the pool to myself 2 days in a row. Breakfast was great, lots of options and I liked that they had staff show you to a seat so you didn‚Äôt have to spend ages looking for a spare seat. However, the rest of the food was downhill from here. I ate at their beachside restaurant and the steak sandwich was terrible, and the Oreo milkshake was literally just milk with Oreos mixed in. I also had a few things in room service; you can see the Parma ham pizza was very sad, and the tiramisu was inedible. I would suggest popping over to the Ritz for their restaurants, they‚Äôre much better. Also I saw reviews saying this hotel had a private beach- this is not true. It has private access to a public beach. The Marriot section of the beach looked beautiful, however, in the 1.5 hours I sat there I had 9 people come up to try and sell me things. Really annoying. Also the guy selling go kart rides kept spitting into the sand, which was disgusting. I couldn‚Äôt go back to the beach after that first day because the idea of walking on that barefoot made me feel sick. Spa was great, I had the best hot stone massage I‚Äôve ever had. Overall I would suggest the hotel improves the quality of its food, and try and do something about the beach situation.

msg:Sanya Marriott Yalong Bay is by far one of the best resorts I've stayed. For Sanya it would be difficult to find a more complete hotel - amazing facilities, amenities, location, and food. 

Rooms are spacious and well designed. Beds are comfortable and each room is equipped with a shower and separate bathtub. TVs offer a wide range of movies, channels, and other options. 

The buffet breakfast is enough to justify staying with many western and Asian offerings. It also has extended hours, 630 AM to 11 AM for early and late risers. 

The pool is large and beautiful with a variety of pool toys to rent. Each set of lounge chairs is accompanied with an umbrella, which makes for a great place to relax on a sunny day. 

Yalong Bay is by far the best bay in Sanya for swimming. The large Sandy beach is filled with lounge chairs and umbrellas for guests to enjoy. The multi-colored blue water is magnificent to gaze upon or enjoy a dip. Waves are moderate and the water is shallow to about 25 meters from shore.

The grounds of the complex is exquisite with great attention to detail in the flowers, plants, and trees. If visiting Sanya the Marriott on Yalong Bay should be on the top of the list.

Excellent location right on the beach, great service with some English speaking staff, clean and modern room, delicious breakfast with lots of choices, live band playing in the evenings, and general relaxed atmosphere. Only problem was there was heavy construction going on right on the beach which was noisy and caused pollution so we had to walk further down the beach to get away from it. Other than that we had a great time and would definitely stay again!

It is rather pricey, but immediate access to the private beach, a spectacular view, great breakfast and staff that is courteous, very helpful, and always smiling certainly makes up for it.
Our contact person at the from desk is Barry and he was just incredible, helping us with all sorts of things and giving us special rates, when we decided to extend (twice)...
Room service also comes around twice per day.
There is literally nothing bad to say about this hotel.
We will be back!!!

Room service just amazing and quick. Each person pay attention to your request. Was only one upset about beach reconstruction, which must and at 15 July. But they didn't rich at time , so David from Trip.com and hotel made a late check out for us , offer a nice supper and bottle of wine. Also two breakfasts in a row there was no chicken ( cause I didn't eat any other meat) and manager made for me grilled chicken breast by my request at the first day . And second day I was not asking for it , but he made it again. It's really nice and professional move from staff. I'm really grateful for this. Territory just amazing and clean. Rooms always clean and without any smell. I didn't expect such a good service if to be honest. I'm amazed by it. Will come back for sure ! All my sadness about Intercontinental and beach reconstruction was covered by behaviour from this hotel. Thank you, it was a great short vacation because of this people and this hotel

The room was to our liking.Ôøº Everything was clean. Our room was spacious ‚Äî note there was no desk and the hair dryer was a bit on the hot side. There was enough to do for our kids between the Kids club and kids pool with slide, they were easily entertained. For reference, their ages are four and seven. Sadly the beach was under construction during our stay which was one of the reasons we chose the Marriott, and they did not mention it until we checked in and only noted in a letter in the room. 
In the lobby there‚Äôs a lounge area where you can sit with the ocean scenery over food and/or drinks. We ordered lunch at the lounge and it did take a little bit longer than we expected. The food was just OK. Ôøº
The breakfast buffet is a mix of western and Chinese. It was good ‚Äî good enough. 
The pools were my favorite. The locals don‚Äôt come out during the day time so the pools were empty, and also bc there are so many pools.

If you‚Äôre looking for lots of things convenient to do outside the hotel, this is not the location as the Yalong Bay area is pretty secluded. But if you‚Äôre looking for a place to park and enjoy, this is definitely it!

A small remark to the management: the food on the menu cost now double or triple as it was in 2021 so a lot of people eat outside. Maybe this move reduces the order quantity (so you can have a better quality) but I think it is almost too expensive...worth to check again maybe üòè

The breakfast buffet was amazing! I'd recommend getting it included in your package. There isa small "shopping mall" on the hotel premises that does have a few restaurants and shops.

The swimming pool and beach front area were also well maintained. The staff at the hotel were super accommodating, especially Alisa. We also enjoyed the food they served during breakfast and dinner buffets. There were a lot of choices both western and Chinese food. The hotel also gave us complimentary voucher for an in-hotel photoshoot. The photographer was named Ocean and he took marvelous pictures of us. He was friendly and easy to talk to.

The rooms are clean and modern. Nothing to complain.

The beach bar ‚ÄûFishbar‚Äú is very cool, but with high potential in service.
Also the lobby bar is too ‚Äûopen‚Äú, because it‚Äòs one big space with the reception and when a bus arrives, it is very loud and not convinient for having a relaxed drink.

The beach set up is the best since you have the long chairs plus beach umbrellas at sea level so I could watch my (big) kids in the water while relaxing at the beach. The beach bar also served us drinks and food at the beach and this is what we couldn‚Äôt find in the hotels nearby. 
Room are modern and clean but a bit small and they don‚Äôt provide extra beds, so when staying in 3 people, you have to share the full size beds. 
Breakfast was good, besides the slow line to get coffee. The Japanese restaurant was the best and dinner buffet was also a good option so we appreciated not having to leave the hotel for dinner.
Overall was a great experience and I would go back to the same hotel every  year.

The pool is clean and all the areas have a nice privacy that don‚Äôt make you feel that you‚Äôre out in the open. Beach is suuuper swimmable. The food is really nice in the resort. Be careful to not over order at the Fish Bar- a couple times, when we received our set meals, it was served in generous portions! Last but not least, there are some markets nearby where you can buy stuff cheaper, shop around etc. Location is convenient! 
We loved it and would visit again!

The only thing to wish is a separate room for yoga/pilates (at the moment there‚Äôs a little space within the gym) as there is not much space at the gym which can be pretty crowded during peak hours. So Hilton still offers a much better experience for sport lovers:)

The rooms are soundproof so couldn't hear any of the other neighbours. I would have preferred a slightly softer bed, but my friend enjoyed the firmer mattress. The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of Chinese and Western food. It was quite busy, so had to wait a few minutes for inside seating during breakfast time. There is a supermarket 5min walk from the resort which is convenient. I really enjoyed staying here and would stay there again.

The Marriott service is needless to say. Every hotel employee is full of enthusiasm, especially the doorman brother. He always actively helps to open the car door and move the luggage. I believe that the first meeting will leave a very good impression on customers. In addition, the hotel has a heated swimming pool, which is very large and adults and children can play happily. Marriott is very close to the forest park and it is convenient to take a taxi.

msg:After comparing many hotels, I finally chose this one. Seeing the good reviews, I decided to give it a try. From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I could feel the friendly atmosphere. I was supposed to check in at 3 pm. Seeing that I was in a hurry to change clothes with my children, the front desk immediately notified the guest room to clean up in advance, and upgraded me to a super deluxe sea view room for free. I can see the entire sea from the room. I feel happy and thank you very much. This hotel is very close to the beach. It takes only 3-4 minutes to walk out of the lobby. The beach is very clean and clear.
What my children like most is the hotel's swimming pool. There are several types, and there are 2 constant temperature swimming pools. Like hot springs, they can have massage functions, and the water temperature is super good. Towels, various swimming rings, water curtain caves, children's paddling pools, and children's playgrounds are provided inside the hotel. It is a paradise for small children. There are also irregular organized activities inside, which can be participated in, so that parents can let go and children are satisfied.
It is very close to the Tropical Forest Park. It takes more than 10 minutes by taxi. The rafting inside is worth going. It takes a long time and is exciting. Children can also play. Free raincoats are also distributed.
What touched me the most was the service of this Marriott Hotel. It was really great. The hotel was very big and I often got lost. No matter which staff member I met, even those coming out of the kitchen, they would ask me if I needed any help. When I was having breakfast, I felt that the hygiene was very good. The children loved the swimming pool, and even the sand digging project on the beach was shortened, haha... They told me that they would definitely come here next time. Thanks again to the Marriott Hotel staff for their efforts. In such hot weather and with such a large flow of customers, it is really not easy to provide perfect service to every guest. Thank you!

In recent years, I have not been to Marriott because I did not choose to stay in Yalong Bay. This time I decided to stay in Yalong Bay for a few nights. I chose Ritz first and Marriott later. They are all Marriott series. It may also be that I just stayed at Ritz before going to Marriott. To be honest, it is indeed a level lower in all aspects, especially when I checked in, I encountered a little unpleasantness. However, Marriott's problem-solving mechanism is still worthy of recognition. After feedback from the check-in specialist, I immediately coordinated to solve the problem and followed up on the solution experience results at any time. I can feel that Marriott is still very attentive to solve problems for guests and serve guests seriously.
The weather in Yalong Bay was good during the two days of stay, and it was very photogenic. See the pictures for details~

msg:I have been to Sanya countless times and this is the first time I encountered a hotel like this. I stayed at Yanlord Haitang Bay for the past three days. After checking out, I went to the Marriott. The hotel lobby is on the third floor and the crowds are like a wet market. The day before check-in, a Marriott staff member added our WeChat account to inquire about the arrival time, and he was truthful. I was told that I would arrive at the hotel around one or two o'clock in the afternoon, but when I checked in, I was informed that there were no rooms and that I would need to arrive after three o'clock. Isn't it unnecessary to ask about the expected arrival time the day before? ? Let‚Äôs talk about upgrading the room type. We booked two rooms and wanted to upgrade the other room with a king bed with a view. We also informed the Marriott hotel housekeeper one day in advance. When I got to the front desk, I asked if I could upgrade, but I was told that there was no room. Then I said there is no need to pay the price difference? So there are rooms that can be upgraded! Wow, my eyes were really opened. A five-star hotel actually looked like this. Forget it, we finally entered the room at around three o'clock or almost four o'clock. There were a bunch of bugs on the wall of the curtain box, the table was not wiped clean, and the staff came to clean it, but can't we really pay attention to such details? Bad hygiene review! Then I talked about the hair dryer. After I took a shower and dried my hair for half an hour, I couldn‚Äôt dry it. I asked if there was a high-power hair dryer and was told that one would be sent to the room. When I came to see it, it was smaller than the original one. I was speechless. ! Not to mention that the standard equipment in five-star hotels now is Dyson, but it can also be Leifen after all! When I made the reservation, I just said that the hotel should be newer in 2020, but this is the result. Let‚Äôs talk about service. The front desk informed us that the breakfast location is on the first floor. We checked the location in advance because we were afraid that our aunt and her children wouldn‚Äôt be able to find it the next day. There is a Marriott Cafe on the first floor, which felt like a breakfast place, so we asked about it. The waiter, I was told, didn‚Äôt know! I? ? ? have no idea? ? Later, another staff member came to inquire and confirmed that it was here. It‚Äôs unacceptable for hotel staff not to know where breakfast is located! I‚Äôm really convinced! The experience was extremely poor from the moment I checked in! I can't find a reason to recommend it at all

msg:Sure enough, it echoed the sentence on the small üç† "Only in Yalong Bay can you feel like you are on vacation." After staying in the urban mangroves for two nights, we already felt pretty good. After staying at the Yalong Bay Marriott, we felt really great!
1. Free upgrade to deluxe sea view room, which is probably from the 3rd floor to the 4th floor. It is located in the center of the hotel and has a good view.
2. The waiter helps unload the luggage and delivers the luggage to the room. When I left, I asked if I needed help with my luggage, which was very considerate.
3. Because I have a 1-year-old baby, the room comes with a child care set and a children's bathrobe. Although it's not suitable for babies, it's still trying.
4. The room is very clean, as far as the eye can see. In the words of my wife, everything in the room is reassuring to use. Although it is indeed smaller, we are not big enough to stay on the balcony. .
5. Bathrobes, towels, and pillows are all good and comfortable to use. I even asked for a latex pillow.
6. The breakfast is quite rich. But when I went there at 8:30, I still had to wait for a table. .
7. The barbecue buffet is a bit unsatisfactory. We got it as a hotel package. It cost about 3-4 per person, but the quality of the seafood, especially the food, is a bit poor. However, the dining popularity is very high and the dinner a**osphere is also good.
8. Some things to do in the hotel. 1Ô∏è‚É£The jungle park is not big, but it is very clean, and the service is very good; 2Ô∏è‚É£The go-kart is just okay, but not fast; 3Ô∏è‚É£The travel photography service is average, and I finished the photo in a few clicks, all thanks to the filter; 4Ô∏è‚É£The little train is very nice! 5Ô∏è‚É£The swimming pool is very fun. When the weather is good, there is no need to go to the heated swimming pool.
9. In the evening, I went for a walk at the nearby Sheraton. There was a wedding there and the a**osphere was lively. However, the interior of the Sheraton is generally dark, and there are not many people staying in the hotel. In contrast, the a**osphere here at Marriott is completely different. There are always a lot of people in the lobby and the bar next to it. There are also resident singers in the evening, two foreign girls.
10. There are a lot of foreigners here at Marriott. The proportion of foreigners is quite high when eating and on beach chairs. This is a basis for judging the characteristics of the hotel. But overall it feels like Marriott is not big, but like a nice big community. I took a look at the nearby MGM Resorts and saw that it was much larger in size and grandeur.
11. Just outside the Marriott is the food court. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt have time to go there for lunch or dinner, and the ice cream given to members in the afternoon was all missed due to lunch breaks.

Overall, my wife and I are very satisfied with this stay, and the baby is also very happy. He is very happy as soon as he goes out. The first trip to Sanya is coming to an end, looking forward to the next time!

msg:The hotel reception and check-in experience was good. Due to the off-season, I was upgraded to a sea view room in the middle. The swimming pool facilities were average. There were only two split-level swimming pools, and only half of them were open. The water clarity in the beach area was good. The breakfast and dinner buffets were mediocre compared to hotels of the same level. The service attitude of the service staff at the catering stalls needs to be improved. There is a butler-style tracking service. The overall cost performance is good and can be recommended.

msg:After searching for a long time among many hotels in Yalong Bay, I finally chose Marriott. It feels really great. It is mainly renovated. The rooms are very new. The hardware and supplies are very good. Children's toiletries are also provided. The fence was also installed before we arrived at the hotel. It was decorated for us, and the birthday gifts were also very good. The birthday decoration and cake delivery were perfect for the ceremony. The butler service was super good. They contacted me in advance to confirm. It really made the experience perfect.
The seafood buffet included in the set meal is also very good, with a lot of seafood varieties. The children's park is also very good, very new, a small Nairbao. The children's park is called Changyuan. It includes an indoor children's park and various parent-child camp courses, as well as a children's swimming pool. My kids love the bubble queuing activity, which makes them very high. There are also seaside oil paintings, which are super romantic. Then the swimming pool is also great. There are many swimming rings for children, which can be borrowed for free, and you can see the sea from the swimming pool. It feels like a vacation.
The hotel's exclusive beach area is also great. The free beach chairs are great. Coconuts are quite expensive, 48 for two. The travel photos I received are also very good, very impressive.

msg:Marriott brand is always trustworthy. Yalong Bay Marriott was newly renovated in 2020. As always, it has a low-key and luxurious temperament, and it integrates the tropical style decoration of Southeast Asia, which is refreshing. The welcome decorations at check-in are made of bamboo leaves and petals, which are cute. The room is clean and tidy, and the service is responsive. Every time you get on and off the car at the lobby door, there is a brother to help open and close the car door and carry the luggage (Hainan's service industry is really good in this regard). There are buffets, Japanese cuisine and Chinese restaurants to choose from. I ate in the Chinese restaurant once. I recommend grilled lamb chops. The dessert tastes good. There is also a food street within a three-minute walk nearby for late-night snacks. The main purpose of going to Yalong Bay is to see the sea. Among the hotels on the coastline, I chose the Marriott with a superior location. From the room, you can see a corner of the private beach. When you walk down the steps through the open lobby, walk through the exquisite gardens and open lawns, the unique tropical sea water of Sanya will hit you. In the daytime, the layers of emerald green and blue sea water flash in the sun, and occasionally the headlights of the babies who participate in the hotel's crab catching activities break the silence at night. Due to the limited time, I didn't spend too much time at the beach. I will definitely come to Yalong Bay Marriott again to watch the sea and listen to the waves if I have the chance.

It feels good because it has been renovated, and there is no damp smell. P.S. The TV can cast the screen! This is really important to me, and it is also the reason why I finally chose Marriott. Breakfast: I stayed for three days and four nights, and the breakfast was really bad. There was no change in the dishes every day. Gold card members will get freshly squeezed juice. In the peak season, you may have to queue or sit outside at 9-10 o'clock. Public area: It can be seen that it is carefully maintained, very clean and tidy, suitable for taking photos and checking in. The lobby on the third floor has a wide view and you can see the sea at a glance, but because it is open, it is hot without air conditioning. Facilities: The swimming pool is small, and it is not easy to swim if there are many people. The slope of Marriott's beach is particularly large, which is not convenient to go up and down, and the sand is very co****. I suggest wearing shoes to feel it.
Complaint: I don't understand why the minibar is charged. It's just a few bottles of Coke and Sprite, 3 yuan each. Fortunately, it's convenient to get takeout nearby, with food and drinks (but you have to go downstairs to the takeout cabinet outside the lobby to get it yourself).
A few days before departure, the butler will call and add WeChat to understand the itinerary. If you have any questions, you can also contact the butler on WeChat. The problem is solved relatively quickly, but the check-in is very slow. I just got off the plane and took a taxi to the hotel, and I wanted to go to the room to rest. When there were not many people, I was exhausted waiting at the front desk to check in. I hope it will be improved.

The hotel gave 2 adults and 2 children a buffet breakfast and dinner. Although the dishes were not very colorful, the overall cost-effectiveness was high and exceeded expectations.
The hotel's service is also remarkable. Knowing that we have 2 adults and 2 children, they immediately sent children's toiletries and pajamas.
The travel photography provided by the hotel is also great. The photos taken are of high quality, and 5 photos are given as a gift. You can buy a few or dozens more by yourself. It is up to you to choose your own way, and it is not imposed on others. The service is very good. I couldn't help but buy a lot of extra photos.

The king-size bed is large and comfortable. The service staff I met are polite and enthusiastic, with a caring smile. The swimming pool has two floors, and swimming rings are provided free of charge. The lifeguards are kind and responsible, and they are disinfected after 10 pm every day. There are lounge chairs on the exclusive beach. The hotel is directly across the grass to the beach. After swimming in the evening, you can go to the beach for a walk in a bathrobe. I also encountered the Ping An Insurance fireworks show next to the Sheraton Hotel, which was very beautiful. The hotel has rich breakfast food, with a variety of Chinese and Western food. You can sit in the living room or outside. Cappuccino, coconut milk, black tea, bread, snacks, fruits, there are changes every day, no repetition.

msg:This is my first time staying in a Marriott hotel. It is good in all aspects. First of all, the hotel has new and complete facilities after renovation in 2020. The hotel room is very new. We stayed in a deluxe sea view king room. When we opened the curtains, we could see the view of the hotel and the sea not far away. It is very suitable for lazy people to relax and lie down.
The hotel service is very good. The staff will take the initiative to help open the car door and take the luggage, and greet us with a smile. Every day when entering and leaving the hotel lobby, we see a lot of luggage. The work is busy and it is still very hard. When we checked in, because we were two people staying but the room only included one breakfast, with the help of the hotel front desk staff, we adjusted it to two on the same day. Thank you very much.
Because the travel photography given by the hotel was full on the morning of our departure, we could only make an appoin**ent at two o'clock in the afternoon. After contacting the housekeeper, we delayed the check-out for two hours, which was very considerate. In general, it is reassuring and worth staying. Like üëçüèª

The public area is beautiful and suitable for taking photos and checking in; the breakfast is rich and the dinner is great. Parent-child friendly, the children had ice cream every day during their stay, which tasted like Haagen-Dazs, and the daily parent-child activities were also full. Due to time constraints, I only experienced catching crabs and go-karts, and the children liked it very much. The bubble party in the swimming pool made the baby not want to go home. There were foreign singers singing in the lobby bar at night, and the a**osphere was very good. The housekeeper helped to solve the problem in time on WeChat, which deserves praise. Overall, I felt satisfied.

msg:A classic is a classic. Although Yalong Bay is a bit older than the hotel group in development, its flaws are not concealed. Marriott has Sea View Seat C, and the unrivaled sea view in the lobby captures the hearts of guests in one second‚ù§Ô∏è Let‚Äôs talk about the room first, because it was renovated in 2020, so the room is not old, the style is simple but feels like home. The shower and toilet are in separate areas. The water pressure of the shower head is very stable, the temperature is comfortable and the water flows quickly. It was a very comfortable stay. All the staff in the room corridor will say hello as soon as they see you. They clean frequently and will replenish supplies in a timely manner. Let‚Äôs talk about the public area. The garden design of the hotel‚Äôs public area is full of Southeast Asian style, with sea breeze, beach, and coconut trees, which satisfies my longing for the ocean as a northern girl. It only takes three minutes to walk to the beach from the hotel, so you can go to the beach anytime. The double-layer heated swimming pool is large and has long opening hours, so you can go there when you wake up. The weather in late March is so pleasant. Originally, the weather forecast said it would be cloudy these days, but after I came here, I realized how nice the weather is. There is no particularly strong sun and it is not cloudy. The temperature is just right, neither too cold nor too hot. It‚Äôs a real treasure to come here at this time! ! ! Finally, let‚Äôs talk about service, 100%! A customer service specialist will contact you by phone and WeChat the day before your stay, send you a map of the hotel, various activities and some precautions, and ask about your requirements. Although we did not book through official channels, we were given all the Gold Card benefits (except room upgrade, which was not upgraded due to high occupancy rate). We arrived at 12:30 the next day and the room had not been cleaned yet. The service specialist Ann took us to the lobby and gave us afternoon tea and welcome fruits for two. Maybe because it was the off-season, the cleaning efficiency was very high. I was informed around 1:20 that the room was ready and you could move in. In the past few days, if I send a question to the housekeeper via WeChat, I will get the answer right away. Ann will help me with all the reservations. Thanks again for her warm service. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Marriott üòÉ

1. There was an extra housekeeper for the service, and you can contact me at any time if you have any questions during your stay.
2. There are many activities in the children's playground. You can collect a stamp on your small passport by participating in an activity, which stimulated the children's enthusiasm, so that they basically didn't play in the water at Marriott.
3. Marriott Travel Homesick members with children can get unlimited ice cream from 14:00 to 16:00.
4. Every place with a swimming pool in Marriott can use swimming rings and inflatable floats for free.
The park is smaller than Sheraton Haitang Bay, and there are relatively fewer swimming pools.
Although the dinner buffet in the set meal is for two adults and two children, it will be charged for those over 6 years old. Although the clerk reminded me that there is a group purchase online, the food does not match the hotel grade and price.

There are also many free activities in the children's playground of the hotel. The naughty castle is also enough to play when there are no activities. There are also children's swimming pools and sand pits outside the children's playground, which are especially friendly to little friends.
The hotel also provides free shuttle buses to the airport, and there are discounts to Atlantis and duty-free shops, which are very playable.

I took my children and the elderly here and bought a twin bed with sea view. The room was clean and tidy, not damp, and the bedding was comfortable to sleep on. It was my favorite decoration style. We helped carry our luggage throughout the journey, and our butler Jill would also send us hotel-related content and activities. We forgot to make a reservation one day in advance for the beach photo shoot, and the appoin**ent for that day was already full. The butler specially sent us a fruit plate to express our apology.

She also took the initiative to ask if there was anything needed before getting off work. The breakfast buffet has a full range of categories, is of good quality, and is delicious. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and afternoon tea can all be catered for in the hotel. If you are greedy, you can go out to eat at a seafood restaurant in the evening. There is a food court on the roadside outside the hotel, with a supermarket and a pharmacy inside, which is very convenient. The scenery of the hotel is beautiful, with large lawns, grassy slopes, coconut groves, and the beach just across the lobby. The drinks in the lobby lounge are also delicious! There is also a resident singer in the evening, which is full of charm!

There is a snack plaza in front of the hotel, and there is a supermarket on the b1 floor of the plaza where you can buy some small things or Hainan food.

I would like to make a suggestion, it would be more convenient to have a small refrigerator in the room. You can have the fruits and drinks you bought iced.

msg:I have been to Haitang Bay several times in Sanya. This time I wanted to see Yalong Bay. Many people at Marriott recommended it as it is family-friendly. Well, the nigh**are started when we arrived. I booked a sea view room and had to wait almost two hours for check-in during the off-season at the end of March. Finally, I asked myself and was told that a room was available. I upgraded the floor. I got the room card and went to the room. I kept walking. Keep walking, the room is at the end, and most of the view you can see is the balcony of the hotel opposite, which is full of other people's clothes to dry. Downstairs, there is the sound of a lawnmower like a tractor. I contacted the bed fence a day in advance and waited for so long. I didn‚Äôt see it either. When I checked in, I also emphasized that the bed rails should be installed. The children had to take a lunch break after entering. I called the front desk to discuss it. The first thing the front desk said was that they would upgrade the floor for you. I would really like to thank you. I just said it. Instead of the floor you upgraded, just give me the one with normal viewing angle. Finally, I changed to a room with a slightly better view. I continued to wait for almost 40 minutes and made countless phone calls. The bed surround finally came, and it can be said that it was stained. It was full and smelly. I was too lazy to bother with it and just wanted to go to bed quickly. I had no choice but to put it away.
The bath towel was placed on the bedside for cover, and the bedside was very unstable. A child could fall into the gap at any time. The gap was so big that two pillows and ten pillows were stuffed inside. The toilet is half a square meter, the bathroom is one square meter, and it smells like urine. It is difficult to turn around even after bathing a child. The whole room is cramped and cramped. Both sides of the corridor were filled with takeout boxes thrown out by customers. The smell made the dark children reluctant to go downstairs.
The children's playground is in a separate building. When you walk there, you have to change to the elevator to bask in the sun for a while. The children's heated swimming pool is really hilarious. It's only as deep as your calves...‚ãØLittle Train
There is a charge, and there are paid children's water cups in the room. The breakfast is even more difficult to describe, the variety is pitifully small, the meat dishes are obviously leftovers from the buffet the night before, and the freshly cooked noodles are thick and hard noodles mixed with juice. , yogurt comes in bulk, I‚Äôm really worried about hygiene issues. Putting aside the taste, the quality of the dishes is at the level of roadside stalls...

Very satisfied with our stay
1. The housekeeper contacted me via WeChat one day in advance, asked about my needs, and helped to book the buffet on the day of check-in. Because I had an appoin**ent at 11 o'clock on the day of check-out for travel photography, the housekeeper took the initiative to help delay check-out until 1 o'clock, and said that he would contact me if it was too late. We asked no more.
2. We arrived at the hotel at 12:15, and after queuing for a few minutes, it was our turn to check in, and then we were upgraded to a deluxe sea view room on the 4th floor. The view from the room was P4, which I think is very nice and beautiful.
3. Except for two days when I had breakfast, I felt there were too many people (I had to wait in line for two or three minutes to arrange a seat). At other times, I felt that there were not many people. At about 9:30 in the morning, there were almost no people in the children's pool of the children's park, and the children's park was quite crowded. Clean. There were not many people in the swimming pool at four or five in the afternoon, so the experience was quite good.
4. There are children's activities, but we participated in a crab catching activity. The staff were very enthusiastic and loved children.
5. There are many swimming pools but they are relatively small. The deepest is 1.2 meters, the shallowest is 0.5, and most are 0.9. It is very suitable for children who are timid and afraid of water. The temperature of the constant-temperature swimming pool is very high, and it will not get cold around five o'clock. But it's a bit too high, like taking a bath in a hot spring.
6. Clean rolled towels and swimming rings can be found everywhere by the swimming pool. You can get them by registering your room number. There are sand digging tools on the beach and you just need to report your room number.
7. The breakfast is average, and the buffet dinner is even more average, but it‚Äôs not that bad. Let‚Äôs just leave it as it is. It‚Äôs included in the set meal anyway, so the requirements are not high.
8. The room is indeed not big, but the double bed room has a sofa and a round table with chairs. The balcony has two chairs and a small coffee table. It is very convenient to eat takeaway in the room without being unable to sit down. The room was quite clean and tidy, much better than the Seaview Pullman anyway.

If we didn't want to have breakfast, the housekeeper also exempted it for us. Sand digging tools were provided for free and a fruit welcome necklace was provided. Ice cream has been arranged.
The most important thing is that if you don‚Äôt want to walk, you can directly ask the hotel to drive a battery car to your destination. This is the best, the service is impeccable, but the sand at the nearest beach is not good and it hurts your feet. But when I walked a few steps to the beach next door, the sandpaper was very fine. I don‚Äôt know why.
If the weather is bad for a travel shoot, you must make an appoin**ent two days in advance. If you make an appoin**ent one day in advance, there will be no time. The weather was not good, and I said I would take a few random photos, but they turned out to be very casual and unsightly. I received a bad review from my travel photography. Not as good as my photo
Hotel check-out: Generally, you can delay check-out, and a delay of 2-3 hours is no problem.
The ice cream provided by the hotel was not very tasty, and the children stopped eating it after a few bites. Finally, I bought ice cream in the lobby, which tasted pretty good.
Breakfast is okay, with both Chinese and Western food.
Parent-child activities that children really like

msg:The first stop in Sanya is the Marriott. It‚Äôs really nice to come to Sanya in the off-season. The overall rating is really worth it!
It was already past seven o'clock in the evening when we arrived at the hotel. When we got off the bus, my luggage was pushed away and stored by the boy, who also gave me a necklace. The front desk upgraded me to a suite for three nights, and I was really surprised to be given an upgraded room type. Thank you. The room is large and comfortable. It has two balconies. The scenery outside the balcony is beautiful and pleasant. But I would like to mention, if you have the opportunity, can you change your hair dryer to Dyson or Leifen? It takes a long time to blow your hair with your hair dryer. It‚Äôs too tiring...
The only shortcoming and disappoin**ent is the food... I can't call it not delicious, it has reached the level of unpalatable. Hahahaha, I didn't even want to eat breakfast one day. I didn't believe in evil and went to eat with my boyfriend. After ordering the buffet dinner, I was thinking how bad it could be, but I made a mistake and it really tasted bad again. Hahahahaha, it was really unpleasant to eat. But when I came to Sanya, I realized that it might not be because the hotel was unpalatable. The food in Sanya seemed to be really average.
Seeing many foreign friends, I strongly recommend paying attention to catering and not letting them think China is unpalatable! no! Ah ah ah ah ah
Cleaning came every day. Even after staying for three days, he didn't show up. We knocked on the door to ask about the cleaning while we were still in the room. It was really nice because many hotel cleaners would knock on the door to ask if they wanted to clean quickly. It felt really good. Not good, Marriott is doing great!
Not only is the room very comfortable, the hotel facilities are also great, with a separate swimming pool and beautiful greenery. It takes less than five minutes to walk to the beach. The location is really good.
The hotel sent 5 travel photos as a gift. The filters were adjusted so well, with blue sky and white clouds. The extra photos cost 30 yuan, which I think is acceptable.
Overall, Marriott has really achieved five-star standards. I am very satisfied. I will give priority to Marriott next time and hope to stick to it.

msg:The Yanlord in Haitang Bay I stayed at a few days ago was a bit more expensive than here. I chose the Marriott in Yalong Bay because it had been renovated. I thought there would be a difference when I moved here from Yanlord, but it turned out there was no difference at all. You can see the lawn and beach from the lobby, balcony and corridor, and it was pleasant to check in. I told the housekeeper that I wanted to delay check-out, and the housekeeper also arranged it and gave me a dinner. I was very satisfied and the food was very good. It happened to be my son's birthday. I used a small cake from the dessert table as a birthday cake during dinner. I was given a coconut shell necklace as a gift when I checked in. All the service staff were very friendly. In short, I will recommend it to my family and friends. It is definitely a good choice to choose Marriott in Yalong Bay.

I took my children to stay here a few years ago and it felt very good, so I chose the Yalong Bay Marriott for this trip to Sanya. The twin rooms with full ocean views really have an unparalleled view and are firmly ranked as the king of buildings! The kids were very satisfied. Rich parent-child activities, my little one loves catching sand crabs the most. The teacher who explains is very kind and caring, thumbs upüëç. The beach is clean and tidy, but the sea activities are a bit expensive, although they are fun. Next time you come to Sanya, you will definitely choose Marriott!

msg:I stayed at Marriott for two days and then at Hilton for two days. Generally speaking, Marriott is better. From the airport bus to the luggage reception at the entrance of Marriott Hotel, Marriott is very active, and the overall service staff are very enthusiastic towards guests. Hilton does not receive many people. It feels very lazy. Marriott's breakfast is far better than Hilton's. Marriott doesn't finish at 11:00, while Hilton starts telling guests that it will finish at 10:40. I feel that Marriott's breakfast is very quiet and enjoyable. Hilton is very busy and noisy, probably because there are so many children. More importantly, Marriott's swimming rings and sand digging tools are free for guests to use only if you report your room number, but Hilton doesn't matter if you are a hotel guest. Even foreign guests need to rent a swimming ring for 30 yuan an hour. This must be a bad review for Hilton. The swimming pool of Marriott Hotel is cleaner than that of Hilton. Hilton has a dumpling-like feeling, and the swimming pool of Marriott is not as clean as that of Marriott. Maybe it‚Äôs because there are so many children. In fact, I think children who are not particularly noisy must stay at the Marriott. It is quiet and hygienic, and the children's playground is also very clean. The lawn behind the Marriott is beautiful. The toiletries used by Marriott are from Herborist, which has a refreshing fragrance of grass and trees. Marriott will also prepare toiletries for children in advance, and the toiletries are much better than those of Hilton. The details of the disposable slippers beat Hilton instantly. If you ask me what is the advantage of Hilton, it may be that the room size is larger, and the others are incomparable with Marriott. In terms of in-room facilities, Marriott's is better, but Hilton's is a bit old. Because I told Hilton staff that I would compare and evaluate the two hotels, Hilton staff upgraded me to a sea view room for free. However, my friend who went with me was not so lucky. In the end, Hilton's job The staff also gave some small gifts, so the good reviews of Hilton Hotel were pasted and copied by the staff. Marriott didn't upgrade any room for me, but I have to give Marriott a thumbs up for the overall review, because not everyone is so lucky. When checking out at Marriott, the people who picked up and dropped off luggage were very proactive in helping guests pick up their luggage and open the door. As for the beach, a large part of Marriott's beach is very fine, but the Hilton is generally rough. Marriott has many deck chairs on the beach, while Hilton only has a few and they are very unhygienic. The overall lounge chairs for resting are not as good as Marriott's. Next time you take your kids to a hotel, Marriott is your first choice. Marriott's bus to the duty-free shop seems to provide free pick-up and drop-off. If you stay at Marriott, you can get a discount on tickets to Atlantis Water World, which is cheaper than buying at the ** live broadcast room. Every afternoon between 2:00 and 4:00, children can get free ice cream. The cheapest ice cream at Hilton is 30 yuan. Although Marriott is a little more expensive than Hilton, the overall environment, service and comfort are definitely worth the price. Hilton is a little sorry for their pricing, and Hilton still has a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe swimming pool that is under repair and cannot be used. Guests are charged for swimming rings, and the rental prices for swimming rings vary, with the cheapest being 30 per hour.

msg:Every time I come to Sanya, I always stay in five-star hotels, and Marriott is the worst experience. For hotels of the same class, I highly recommend the Evergreen Crown Hotel in Haitang Bay. It gives children a full sense of ceremony. The Evergreen Crown Hotel is great. Let me briefly describe my objective evaluation of Marriott Hotels: 1. Hotel service is not guest-oriented. When encountering problems, they will first say that it is not the hotel's responsibility. For example, if guests in other rooms talk on the phone loudly on the balcony from 23:00 to 12:00, which is very disturbing to everyone's rest, the hotel will not intervene to coordinate. The answer is that this is not a problem of the hotel management. 2. The hotel breakfast has few varieties. The soy milk is heavily mixed with water and the taste of the soy milk cannot be tasted. Many mangoes are raw, which feels very cheap. 3. The hotel facilities are old. A cheap kettle is so worn out that the lid pops open in less than a minute and stops when the water is dry. 4. There were many mosquitoes, and the hotel refused to provide two mosquito repellent liquids, causing the child to be bitten twice. 5. No rest is allowed in the hotel lobby consumption area. You must consume, otherwise you will be evicted. 6. There is no welcome fruit, Marriott Hotel is very stingy. There is only one go-kart ticket, and families with two children need to apply several times before it can be given to them. 7. There is a food court in front of the hotel. Don‚Äôt go there to eat, it‚Äôs a rip-off.

The environment is very good. The overall feeling is that the Marriott lawn is very grand and the view of the sea from the lobby is superb.
The only drawback is that the breakfast variety and features need to be improved. Compared with other similar breakfasts, it is a bit ordinary.

The facilities and quality in the room are of the standard expected from Marriott, which is very good. Dadonghai, where I lived before, was too noisy, but resting here is very quiet and sleeping very comfortable. The breakfast buffet is very complete and tastes great. You don‚Äôt need to have lunch until 11 noon. There was only one breakfast in the reserved room, and the butler gave one as a gift. Because the hotel provided free travel photos at one o'clock in the afternoon, the butler also delayed check-out until two o'clock. It was very user-friendly and the service was considerate. The sand on the beach is very fine and the sea breeze is very comfortable. My stay at Marriott this time was a surprise beyond my expectations. I will make it my first choice next time I come to Yalong Bay!

msg:It was my first time to take Mama to Hainan Island for vacation. After looking at the hotels, I finally chose the Marriott's deluxe sea view room. The facilities in the room were very new and very clean. Standing on the balcony and looking at the sea view in front of me was refreshing! After staying for 3 days in a row, I could see a different scenery every day. The breakfast for the three days also had different dishes to meet various needs. After breakfast and lunch every day, I go for a walk on the beach and around. It is very pleasant. The concerts in the lobby and fish bar in the evening are also very a**ospheric. It is the first choice for slow-paced travel.
My family is also very satisfied with the hotel's service. The guest specialist's point-to-point service has met our needs as much as possibleüëç. The hotel staff I met along the way were all very kind, and my mother said she was very satisfied;-) I will choose Marriott Hotel next time I go on vacation~

Unfortunately, I didn't have time to experience it. The service of the hotel cannot be overemphasized. The butler also added relevant information on WeChat in advance to provide help. The attitude was very good~ The beach in Yalong Bay is a bit worth complaining about. The part near the hotel is still very thin, but it is much thicker near the seaside, especially It is a shallow water area after entering the water, and there are even many large rocks. This is not as good as Dadonghai, but it is said that the Marriott area is relatively good. Regardless of the faults, it was a very satisfying Chris**as trip~

msg:I come here several times every year. My child said he wanted to try another one. On the first day, he went to the Hilton next door. As soon as he entered the sea, he was scolded by the lifeguard, saying that the waves were too big. He meant well, but he was very rude. At that time, he decided to go to the Hilton the next day. I switched to Marriott, but the sound was not good at night. There was a crying baby next door and I couldn't sleep well. The overall service was very poor and Marriott was missing at least one star. At Marriott Beach, the lifeguards will remind the children and the person in charge will keep an eye on the children and sit very close to them. The most important thing is the attitude of the service staff rather than the tone of the instructor. The breakfast is also much better. Although we are a little tired of staying here, the service quality makes us choose this place again and again. When I was in college, Marriott had just opened, and this was the only one in Yalong Bay. When I was in love, I brought my girlfriend here. After I was promoted to daughter-in-law, I brought my whole family here. I have a lot of affection for Marriott. This time at the dinner buffet, the waiter saw that the child didn't eat much so he didn't charge the child. It was very humane. A hotel affects the image of the entire brand. I believe that not every Hilton is of that standard, but it will still make us avoid this brand elsewhere in the future, and we will tend to choose Marriott wherever we travel. Hope we can maintain such a high level of service.
PS.
The ocean ball projection game in the children's paradise has become the main factor for children to choose a hotel... We are not staying in a hotel, but in the ocean ball... üòÖ

I fell in love as soon as I opened the door and walked in. The room had no peculiar smell and was clean and tidy. You can see the sea from the balcony, and I feel so good. I decided to extend my stay less than an hour after checking in, and extended it for two more days.
Cleaning sister, you really take care of the details. Look at the picture of the charging cable.
The housekeeper is also very good. He doesn't bother me too much, but he always responds to my needs.
The lobby is really comfortable. You can see the sea directly. You can hear the sea breeze when sitting in the cafe or on the balcony of your room. It really makes you feel like you are on vacation.
I didn‚Äôt go out for three days in the hotel. I ate and slept. After I got up, I went for a walk on the beach. After the walk, I went back to my room to rest, then went to eat. In the evening, I went back to the hotel to listen to music in the cafe. I enjoyed the slow life I wanted.
All the servers are super nice and polite
The breakfast is also very rich, with both Chinese and Western food. The most important thing is that it ends at 11 o'clock, which is very suitable for people like me who stay in bed.
The three days at Marriott were really a plus in this trip.
Don't be scared by the bad reviews, this hotel is great

The service is also super good. In addition to a waiter delivering luggage to the room when checking in and a waiter coming to the room to help with luggage when checking out, what impressed me most was a small detail. The breakfast time is very long from 6:30-11:00.

Busy and orderly, very well managed, not like some hotels where there is a swarm of people vying for seats and food. The dishes are also very rich.
The hotel has arranged a wide range of children's activities for children, which are basically free. If you get tired of playing at the beach, you can also participate in various activities at every time in the hotel. We went to play our favorite go-kart, and the children said it was fun!
The room facilities are also great. The clothes drying rack on the balcony is so considerate. The children change several clothes every day. It is very convenient to dry clothes. I was deeply moved!
All in all, it was a great stay experience and highly recommended to friends who come to Yalong Bay!

There are many posts that describe Marriott as very unsavory. After checking in, I feel that although I can‚Äôt Compared with five-star hotels in China, at least it is clean, the service is friendly, and the room does not smell musty. It has a luxurious sea-view king bed, and when you open the balcony door, you are indeed facing the sea. Because it is not a parent-child hotel, there are not many children, which is very satisfactory. Although some parent-child activities have been given up, there is no need to worry about children catching the flu together. In addition, it may be the off-season, so check-in is also very fast. Because we have children, we installed extra bed guards.
The housekeeper Lyre is enthusiastic and responsible. She took the initiative to contact us before traveling. If we encountered any problems during our stay, she was able to help us solve them in time. Thumbs up to her.
Renting a stroller is 60 yuan per day, and there is a free shuttle bus to and from the CDF duty-free shop in Haitang Bay every day.

I had to sign a lot of documents at the front desk and pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan. I was very unhappy. Is it just that? Who wants to drink the bottles of broken drinks in the minibar? A hair dryer bag costs 50 yuan. Why don‚Äôt other hotels pay a deposit? The minibar also offers free drinks. I feel unhappy, and the service staff I met in the lobby are basically basic. No one took the initiative to say hello, which is not worthy of a 5-service hotel. Let's talk about the room. Anyway, it's the standard of a fast hotel. It's too small for a 5-star price. Even though it's been renovated, it's still shabby. There is only one tissue in the room, and it is only in the bathroom. There is no tissue on the table in the room. When I asked the front desk clerk, I was told that there is one in the bathroom. I was speechless. The tissue did not match the box. The tissue was in a rectangular box or a square box and could not be drawn out. The greenery on the lower floors of the hotel is probably too good, but there are so many mosquitoes, flies and insects that the child was bitten as soon as he entered the hotel. The only thing worthy of praise is that the service staff at Changyuan Children's Club are very enthusiastic, the children also have a lot of fun, and the breakfast is not bad.

The service is particularly good. As soon as you look around at the front desk, a staff member will immediately come up to ask you what help you need.

The beach has nothing to do with the hotel, but the beach in Yalong Bay in recent years is really hard to describe. It used to be white and fine, but now people don‚Äôt dare to go barefoot, and people grimace. But the hotel is so close to the beach, it is very comfortable to lie outside every day.

All things considered, highly recommended!

The small train drove half a circle for us and continued to lie to us. Anyway, we really felt bad. Various reasons, various excuses, various lies, yes, one breakfast per room was compensated.

msg:I don‚Äôt usually write negative reviews unless it‚Äôs too outrageous. On the first day of my stay, I was charged an extra 10,000 yuan deposit for no apparent reason. Ctrip had already charged the deposit. When I arrived at the hotel, I was asked to pay another deposit. I paid two deposits for a room. Jin, forget it. After checking into the room, it became even more amazing. Let‚Äôs take a look at the pictures. Secondly, the mold spots and stains on the walls in the three pictures have been treated. I forgot to take pictures before because I was so shocked. So scared that I forgot. But what was even more frightening was the hairy mold spots at the back, which we accidentally discovered when we were about to check out and pack our luggage. I stayed with my child for 4 days in such an environment. I blamed myself very much. No wonder the child suddenly I couldn't stop sneezing when I entered the room! After eating breakfast at the hotel and not eating again that day, I couldn't stop vomiting. After that, my temperature rose. I went to the hospital to get fluids. Before going to the hospital, I called the hotel to ask if they could provide an ear thermometer to measure my temperature. I wanted to seek help. , the hotel replied that it does not provide such services, and there was no staff to help during the period. The reason for not providing temperature guns was because they were worried about hygiene issues. I thought it was quite ridiculous. The room hygiene was so bad, and the breakfast buffet was full of stains. I almost missed it several times. I slipped and fell. The waiter couldn't tell whether the drink cup used by the guest was used before putting it back in the clean tableware area. I didn't want to write it down anymore. This is not Marriott. It almost made me mistakenly think that I had stepped into the Hanting Hotel!

msg:The Marriott Hotel is located in Yalong Bay. The airport pick-up booked by Ctrip takes about 40 minutes. There is a waiter at the hotel entrance who will help you carry your suitcase and take you to the front desk to check in. The hotel has an appoin**ent before ten o'clock every day to go to Haitang Bay the next day. There is a free shuttle bus from the duty-free shop. The room is clean and tidy, with a clothes rack on the balcony. The sand on the beach is a bit harsh on the feet. The sea is still beautiful. The hotel has many parent-child activities and sand digging tools are provided for free. It is fun to dig crabs on the beach.

We brought two 28-inch suitcases, one on the luggage rack and one on the floor, as well as a stroller, so the room didn't feel cramped. The bed is comfortable, the sound insulation is good, and the room is cleaned twice a day. The quality of the breakfast and dinner buffets is also very high! The swimming pool with different levels is very beautiful, and the landscaping is also beautiful. The butler Lyre also provided very good service and even arranged for a doctor to come and see me when I felt unwell.
The hotel also does a great job with families! I caught up with the new opening of the children's playground and swimming pool, which is super new! The children's swimming pool is shaded and has a sand pit to play in. The indoor park also has a dedicated baby toilet and shower area. Sand digging tools can be borrowed for free on the beach, and there is a bubble party every other day.
There is a big gap from the beach to the sea right in front of the hotel, like a cliff, and the beach is quite rough, but the sand close to the hotel is okay. The waves are big, but there are areas set aside for swimming.

msg:This time I was traveling alone and wanted to stay in a hotel for two days, so I chose the Marriott's full ocean view room. The housekeeper Jill was very enthusiastic and professional, and she responded promptly to problems. When I checked in, I told the front desk that I wanted a room with a better view, but still It's half blocked, so you have to turn sideways to see the panoramic view. Maybe the room with a good view has been booked, which is a pity.

The service staff who greet guests at the door will help open and close the door to retrieve items. The hotel's breakfast variety is pretty good. It's different every day. It has Chinese and Western dishes as well as Hainan specialties. During peak hours, there will be service staff to guide you to the seats so it won't be messy. The restaurant staff can learn the meaning of tableware placement. I want to eat alone. I took some more things and placed them in a triangle, but they were still taken away, which was a bit embarrassing.
The overall facilities of the hotel are quite new, and the hygiene is OK. When I checked out, I saw that the cleaning staff next door used alcohol and a vacuum cleaner to clean it little by little, but the smell in the toilet room has not been resolved. Then there are some oil stains on the curtains and the sliding door next to the bathtub. There were a lot of fingerprints on it, but there was nothing wrong with the rest of the bedding and bathtub. Some suggestions were that the pillows were too soft and it was difficult to lean on them. In addition, there was no paper towels on the bedside table.

The hotel's beach is half fine sand and half hard sand mixed with broken shells. The scenery is still very beautiful, and there are safety guards on the shore. It is most beautiful in the evening and morning, and it is not hot.

Overall, it was a very pleasant trip. This was my first time staying at Marriott, and after experiencing it, I think it will be a second time!

Special thanks to lyre, who sent us the hotel map in advance the day before departure, as well as warm tips. After check-in, you will be asked every day if you have any special needs and the comfort of the bedding. üëç
The hotel has complete facilities, and I slept very comfortably. I also like the height of the pillows. I am not used to sleeping on high pillows. This is just right, and the hardness is also suitable.
The hotel environment is very good, there are very few mosquitoes, the room cleaning staff is very polite, and they will warmly say hello when they meet in the corridor, which leaves a deep impression.
The children liked the four little things in the children's room very much, and named them respectively. Little one is ko ni ji frog, little two is peach, little three is gurgling chicken, and little four is bulubulu. The hotel has parent-child activities every day, so you can experience it next time you have plenty of time.
Looking at the sea on the beach is so pleasant, I want to stay from sunrise to sunset.

The hotel does a better job and puts fragrances in the room. However, this hotel is also more expensive üòÇüòÇüòÇ

The hotel beach is quite big and there are security guards. There are also tools for digging crabs available for free for a limited time at night.

Hygiene: Very clean, no flaws found


Environment: The environmental greening is the best in the vicinity, with a high rate of green plant coverage, and there are little squirrels


Service: The service is very good. When you get off the car, the concierge will open the door and help you take your luggage to the room. The service at the front desk is very good, and you will be informed of all the precautions when you check in

Breakfast at Marriott Cafe is quite rich.
The only drawback is that I was looking forward to the buffet barbecue for dinner, but there was no freshly grilled barbecue. I was told that the kebabs were only available on Fridays and Saturdays. This was very disappointing. They were all grilled before. I hope to be informed in advance next time.

Before check-in, the hotel arranged an exclusive butler Lyre. He helped us make an appoin**ent for dinner in advance, and also sent fruit thoughtfully.
The hotel room should be renovated and the facilities are newer. We had a great few days. On the day of check-out, since our flight was at night, we asked the housekeeper Lyre to apply for a late check-out with the mentality of trying it out. Due to the peak season for True Value Hotel, the rooms are quite tight. Lyre still helped us explain the situation to the room manager very seriously, and made a late check-out. Thanks again

There are restaurants, supermarkets, and food stalls at the Dongrong Food Court at the entrance. You can eat whatever you want. If you are willing to take a walk, you can walk about 1.5 kilometers along Haitang North Road at night to eat at Baihuagu Commercial Street, where there will be more choices.
There is still a lot of room for improvement in the front desk service of the hotel. Free welcome tea, used tea cups, and unused ones are mixed together and no one cleans them up. I checked in early, but the room hadn't been cleaned yet, and when I was ready to check in, I went back to the front desk, but was told that I had to queue again. Now that I have already checked in in advance, why do I have to queue up again to get the room card, which not only wastes my own time but also the time of other guests, which is worth improving.
However, these problems are all thanks to the hotel service specialist Lyre for helping to solve them in time. The young lady is very beautiful, very professional in solving problems, very responsible, very careful, and responds in a timely manner. As an intern, it is very rare to be able to do this, leaving a deep impression. I hope Lyre can find a satisfactory job in the future, and the future is bright!

After the renovation, it will focus on parent-child activities. As long as you have enough energy, you can play from 10 am to 9 pm. Daai offers free ice cream for children every day üç¶ Key points: unlimited times.

msg:This time I stayed at the Marriott for 5 days and 4 nights. I chose a hotel for a long time before I came here. Because I stayed at the Marriott in Shenzhen and felt good, I booked the Marriott in Sanya with doubts. It turned out to be a wise choice. First of all Marriott is in Yalong Bay. It is cost-effective, convenient, and has a good service attitude, especially the housekeeper Lyre after I checked in. He responded to every request and informed me of the weather in time to make me travel carefully. It feels very warm. There are more opportunities to eat at a Chinese restaurant for lunch and dinner Many, because it is not convenient to go too far away with children. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant are also delicious. Children like the children's set meal and cumin lamb chops. In addition, the photography provided by the hotel should not be too good. It is optional in the hotel There are also many places to take pictures. As adults, we found a traveler outside to take pictures before, only to find out later that the photography they sent from the hotel is very technical. Dear friends, don‚Äôt miss it. By the way, I accompanied the children to play on the beach and get sunburned In addition to the skin, the hotel also has a very perfect skin care program, in short, it is very NICE

msg:Summary: Deluxe full sea view twin room. The overall experience is good, the service and facilities meet consumer expectations, and you can consider staying again. The quality of the Yalong Bay beach may affect the hotel experience.
Service: The housekeeper will take the initiative to connect with you one day in advance, and you can explain to the housekeeper about any matters during your stay. (I would like to thank the housekeeper Iyre for the service provided during the stay. During the stay, the family had stomach discomfort. Iyre provided more comprehensive services within the scope of the hotel's capabilities, including arranging breakfast and dinner delivery, late check-out, etc.) Room cleaning was timely and proactive , in place and quickly. From opening the door, picking up luggage to seeing off passengers, the doorman will actively and enthusiastically provide help. Towels and tea are provided at check-in, and the check-out process is simple. Room delivery and water delivery are relatively fast, and additional rice dumplings will be provided during the Dragon Boat Festival.
Meals: Meals will be served at the hotel during the stay. The breakfast is rich in variety, and the plates are heated and dried. You need to queue up during the peak meal period, but the order is orderly. The price/taste of the Chinese restaurant is slightly high, and the waiting time for some dishes is too long, but the service is meticulous and in place.
Public area: Although there is no air-conditioning in the lobby, it is well ventilated and free from sunlight. You can sit and chat for a long time in the lounge. The room corridor has air conditioning and dehumidification, and the air has no peculiar smell. You can order takeout and pick it up from the takeout counter in the lobby.
Room: The hardware facilities are in good condition. Hot water in the shower, sliding doors, bedding, TV, Internet, seats, etc. are satisfactory, the remote control is clean, and the room has no peculiar smell. Although the weather is hot and humid, the balcony scenery is very healing.
Travel: It is very convenient to call a car, and basically accept orders in seconds.
Others: Although I have some understanding of the overall state of Yalong Bay after sand filling, it is still beyond imagination. It is inconvenient to go through a steep slope to walk to the beach. The waves are slightly larger and the sand is thicker. In addition to the bluer sea water, the water experience of Yalong Bay is not as good as that of Sanya Bay.

Since it is the peak tourist season, the room was not cleaned when we arrived at the hotel. The little brother at the front desk arranged for us to rest in the lobby bar first. He generously gave us 3 cups of refreshing drinks and contacted the room for urgent cleaning. Finally, we were allowed to check in before 3 o'clock. üëçüèª
The hotel service is very good and there are many entertainment facilities. The butler Lyre arranged everything properly and even gave a special welcome fruit. Five-star praise!

msg:I came here after staying in Hualuxe for two days. The experience was terrible and the price was higher than that of Hualuxe. You have to queue up for check-in and breakfast. The room environment is poor and the space is small. When you check in, you are told that you will be upgraded, but the room is moved to the north. It is very cold at night. When you check out, there is no one to help you with your luggage. It costs 2,000. There is no corresponding service at all. The chairs on the room balcony and the hotel beach loungers were very dirty. The view from the balcony was poor, and only a small part of the rooms could see the sea. Drinks and snacks in the HUALUXE hotel room are free and can be replenished at any time. In Marriott, only specified water is free, and other water and drinks are charged. Whether it is the front desk or restaurant staff, there is no service awareness. The beach provided by the hotel has rough sand and is not suitable for babies. In short, during my three visits to Sanya, this time the Marriott Hotel had the highest price and the worst experience.

They specially upgraded the semi-sea view room for us, and there is fresh coconut milk service for two people. It is very convenient to walk to the food court. There is also a supermarket behind the food court, where you can buy some daily necessities. The sand on the private beach is pretty good. Those who have been to Sanya many times come to relax. It is recommended to go out to the beach after 4 o'clock to play in the water. We ordered Buzaike's seafood set meal at noon and ate it in the room. It tasted good. I got up too early in the morning to fly, rested at the hotel in the afternoon, and didn't go to the beach until 5 o'clock. The suggestion is that the hotel can consider installing a disposable plastic film for the bathtub, freshly squeezed juice for breakfast drinks, and a small refrigerator for the minibar. In the evening, the pink sky accompanied by the sea and the beach is beautiful!
Service: Satisfied üëç
Weather: hot, it is recommended to go out after 4 pm, otherwise you will have to tan

The butler service is in place. The butler nitis understands our needs before check-in and reports to the hotel.

The hotel is much more refined after decoration, and the room corridors are very comfortable. Room service is in place, cleaned on time every day, polite and thoughtful.
The outdoor swimming pool is very large, with a two-story design, swimming rings, various balls, and bath towels for free use. There is also a basketball hoop, which is very parent-child and meets the needs of all agesüëç.
The breakfast is relatively rich, and there are many favorites. I hope that the vegetables can be changed a few times a day. There is a Chinese restaurant for lunch and dinner, as well as a buffet, which is very good.
The reason why I chose Marriott this time is that the Dongrong Seafood Market is just down the road. It is very convenient to shop and eat. You don‚Äôt have to go to Baihua Valley, but you can also taste delicious food. Seafood is free, and the size is super bigüòã
It's a pity that I was affected by the typhoon for a few days and couldn't go to the sea. It's a pity...
We are very satisfied with the Marriott Hotel this time.

Outside the lobby, there are various tropical green plants and large green lawns, interesting children's play items, and a clean and crystal clear swimming pool.

üõèRoom facilities: The room is spacious and bright, with complete facilities, convenient to use, and a balcony, which is beautiful. The bathroom is super large, with wet and dry partitions, and plenty of hot water. The single bed size is very large, enough for adults and a child to sleep.

üçΩFood recommendation: The breakfast restaurant in the hotel is very good, with a variety of varieties and good taste, and the freshly made noodles and noodles are very delicious. Remember to go early for breakfast, or you will wait for a seat. There is also Dongrong Food City next to the hotel. I recommend Xijia, which is delicious and not expensive.

üëçMost recommended: The hotel staff has a kind attitude, they take the initiative to help with luggage and give directions, and the check-in and check-out procedures are very fast. In particular, I would like to thank the housekeeper nitis, she is very thoughtful, she called in advance, helped us arrange parent-child travel photography during the stay, and the warm and meticulous service made us feel at home.

üìùPay attention to tips: The hotel provides three free shuttle buses to the duty-free shop every day. Remember to make an appoin**ent in advance and wait at the entrance of the lobby on time. It will take about ten minutes to arrive. On the return trip, wait directly at the entrance of the duty-free shop according to the shuttle bus time. Friends who are in a hurry can take a taxi back by themselves. There is also a karting field in the hotel, children can try it.

After many years, the house was too old and gave up. After the epidemic, I read the reviews that the house was renovated, and I couldn't help but choose Marriott again. The sea view is still invincible, really beautiful, the service is very good, and the breakfast is not as good as before. If you want to see the beautiful scenery, I suggest you stay at the Marriott. There is a free bus to the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop every day. It is very close to Atlantis, and you can go to the Atlantis Hotel by taking a taxi for 10 yuan. Atlantis where I stayed the year before last, the lobby looked like a supermarket, it was so lively! The beach there is sandy and there is no way to go into the sea. You can only play in the water park in the hotel. The Tropical Paradise Forest Park in Yalong Bay is very interesting. There are glass planks and beautiful scenery everywhere. Flying in the rainforest is also fun. You can find a photographer to come to the hotel to take artistic photos of the seascape. It costs 398 yuan for one hour of intensive repair, and the results are very good.

The most interesting thing is to go to the beach to dig for crabs at night. We dug up a very small crab ourselves, and we were very happy. In terms of food, Chinese food is better than Western food. One day I ordered a beef brisket noodles and a seafood pizza at the lobby bar, which was a disaster (the seafood part consisted of canned tuna). The kids love the hot tub and play there every day. The unlimited supply of bath towels by the hot tub is great. SPA is not interesting. We have a chain in Chengdu called Changle Massage which is far ahead of hotel SPA.

Before departure, Marriott arranged for a guest specialist, Lyre, to pick us up. I was a little worried about the length of check-in at Marriott when I read the reviews. Because of Lyre's thoughtfulness, the room was arranged before we arrived. The room type has been upgraded from the 3rd floor to the 6th floor (the higher the floor, the better the view), so it only took about 15 minutes for us to check in (including a bunch of coupons, introduction of experience coupons).

Lyre also arranged welcome gifts for us, including delicious pastry, Chilean red wine and Heineken. Children and adults were very happy.

Marriott's lobby deserves to stay longer, the wind is blowing very comfortably. When we had afternoon tea, it was also a new experience to encounter China Southern Airlines' official website doing a live broadcast.

Marriott's swimming pool is very suitable for taking pictures. The children had a great time in it, and there are fun programs such as bubbles.

It is worth mentioning that Ivy, who helped us decorate the room, is beautiful and skillful, because I saw a heart in the hotel opposite the room, Ivy was there at the time, and when we came back at noon the next day, we watched it in our room When I arrived at the hearts and swans that Ivy arranged for us, it was very considerate, thank you Ivy.

There are also go-karts in the package, the venue is not big, but it feels good for us two dolls to book the venue.

Marriott's check-in experience is really good, thanks to Lyre's thoughtful help and Ivy's ingenuity.

msg:This time I stayed at the Yalong Bay Marriott. I really chose it out of thousands of choices. After looking at hotels for a week and comparing them, I finally chose it. After the real experience, it lived up to expectations. I am so satisfied. My son didn‚Äôt want to leave. The service is very good. Thoughtful, the facilities are also very complete. As soon as you walk out of the lobby and pass through the garden and swimming pool, you will see the white sand beach üèñÔ∏è and the blue sea. Especially when you left the store today, the sun was shining on the beach and the sea. It was just like a beautiful painting, and the camera took it I can't tell its beauty. I have a good experience after staying for three days. I will choose it next time I come to Sanya. After all, there is a gourmet city outside the door. It is convenient to eat. The most important thing is that the buffet breakfast is unimaginably rich. I really hate my stomach too much Small, after three days of eating, I didn‚Äôt try all of them üòõ You can also pick lotus mist in the garden

The perfect experience made people not want to try other hotels again. They continued to stay and continued to stay. They stayed in Marriott for the whole vacation, staying for 7 consecutive nights until they left Sanya. The strength of a classic old-fashioned hotel is reflected in every detail, it can keep guests, and there is nothing else to love! There is love only when there is comparison. From Capella, Park Hyatt, Mandarin to Marriott, Marriott has the best cost performance!

When I arrived, the upgraded room type was gone, so I thought it would be fine, but I upgraded to a better sea view room on the 5th floor. In the middle of the whole building, there is a semicircular large platform from the balcony, with a proper first-line sea view. After all, it opened in 2004, the room is relatively small, but it is still clean after redecoration. The landscaping is good and the sea is clear, but the sand is indeed not as good as it was more than ten years ago. Breakfast has room for improvement. Finally, thank you nitis and lyre for their enthusiastic service. I added WeChat one day in advance to help make dinner reservations and a bus to the Duty Free City.

The staff who participated in the parent-child activities were responsible for their friendliness. Haitang Bay Hotel didn‚Äôt have crabs at night. 20 Crabs began to crawl all over the place at 1:00, and I felt the kindness and friendliness of the hotel staff during this stay. The hotel has clean and brand-new rooms, beautiful gardens, and a charming sea view. You can see the sea from the swimming pool, which is bluer than Haitang Bay. There is also a beautiful swimming pool with a water depth of 1.2m suitable for children. Rich and delicious breakfast, many parent-child activities, lobby The scenery is even more invincible. No matter in terms of hardware, bedding, toiletries, room decoration, or variety of parent-child activities, it is better than parent-child hotels. The main reason is that the staff are friendly and responsive, and they can exchange many gifts. The dolls are well-made and catch dolls The machine only needs a few coins to catch the big doll. I also exchanged cakes and coffee in the lobby. I lived in Shangri-La and Sheraton in Hainan. In comparison, I found that Marriott is really number one. The blue water of Sanya Bay is more beautiful than Haitang Bay. Moreover, most of the marine activities in Sanya Bay can be launched into the water. After walking out of the room, you can go to the grass to drink on the beach. It takes 10 minutes to walk to Haitang Bay to go to the beach.

There are blue waters, and the sea and sky are the same color. Deck chairs, awnings, swings, and surfboards really satisfy all your fantasies about the beach. Marriott's travel photography level is also good, very professional, and will not forcefully sell. The most important part is Marriott's service. Jill, the housekeeper, added me on WeChat one day in advance and met all my requests with a very good attitude. The lady at the front desk, Judy, is really great. She helped us upgrade to a super-large room. Although it is a side suite, this room is very large. It passes through a promenade, and the side wall is a garden view, and the balcony is a sea view. The equipment in the room is relatively new, and I was really amazed. What's more, Marriott also helped us arrange our honeymoon. Although it was a little dusty, haha, it was very thoughtful. I am especially grateful to Ms. Judy for giving us a bottle of honeymoon red wine. Looking at the night view at night, I feel slightly drunk while drinking the little red wine, and the holiday experience is full. The last time I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton next door, the overall service and experience were not as impressive as Marriott. There are many types of breakfast in Marriott, and Western and Chinese styles can satisfy your taste. All five-star praise, will come again next time

msg:The room is relatively small, and the deluxe sea view I booked is the sea view on the balcony side. After booking, I found that there is a panoramic sea view, so there is a difference. The consumption in the lobby bar is a bit high, 108 for a bowl of local Baoluo noodles, it hurts. The butler service is very enthusiastic before check-in, and it is Buddhist service after check-in and check-out, which is very realistic. Some complimentary services during the corresponding stay were not fully informed. Breakfast is average, in a large banquet hall on the first floor with no view. But the service attitude of the hygienist and the room attendant made me feel very good. Give it a thumbs up, get used to praise

msg:Marriott, a brand engraved in my heart, I went to Marriott only after staying in other hotels. As soon as I entered Marriott, I felt at home. Miles, the concierge, had a good service and was very enthusiastic. He took the initiative to help us with our luggage; what impressed me the most was Fu Afei and Fu Ruiai, the waiters in the room depar**ent, I don‚Äôt remember who is who, but I remember the big white teeth, the smile, and the constant in and out of the room, and they kept greeting, I can‚Äôt tell who is who. The guest room is very clean everywhere, without any peculiar smell. They have paid a lot. The paper towels in the room are covered with roses folded in paper towels. I‚Äôve added it up, and thought I‚Äôd leave it at that, but I took my son back to the Children‚Äôs Paradise. The room was clean and tidy. I told my husband: Look, this is Marriott! Every time I got in and out of the elevator, I saw Marriott's logo and flowers on the white stone above the trash can. I said to my husband: Look, this is Marriott! Even when cleaning the elevator entrance on the floor, I will remove the cabinets and trash cans for cleaning, and I will tell my husband, look, this is Marriott! It feels like they treat this place like home. There is also Marriott's coconut, which has the Marriott logo on it, so beautiful, and Marriott's breakfast, unlike other hotels that are perfunctory to guests, there are at least three chefs guarding them every day, one makes egg pancakes, one makes noodles, and one Making pancakes is not afraid of labor-intensive, just so that we can eat fresh meals. When the breakfast is about to end, there will be a waiter at the table to remind us to close the meal, which is great! The last time I was in other hotels, no one reminded me, and I didn‚Äôt check the time, so I didn‚Äôt have enough to eat, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about this when I come to Marriott, haha, and the switchboard Leo‚Äôs service is also very good, very kind, and will arrange to drop off the children as soon as possible Bathrobes, slippers, toothbrushes, great, I hope Marriott will get better and better, in another 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, 100 years, you still have such a great service, thank you for every smile and greeting to me , will come again next time!

It has a great view, good service, and delicious cocktails! The old mother and father quietly watching the beach and the children eating hamburgers are so comfortable... I have reached the state of forgetting to bother me... I have to say that the lobby of the hotel has a beautiful view. After reading the introduction, it seems that it is made by a famous designer... The hotel There are several small pools in the swimming pool, and the children are very high. Every day, the hotel gives ice cream to the children. The baby goes to the restaurant on time every afternoon to report on the hotel‚Äôs water sports. The service is also very convenient. We have a sailing boat, which is an exciting experience, and we have to. The price-performance ratio of the small train is too high! This is how a comfortable hotel makes you feel without any discomfort...moisturizes everything silently...just spent five days and four nights lying down, eating and drinking...the baby is naturally unwilling to go back...but there will be a next time! There will be a period later :-)

Then, the 3 sets of items stamped and collected by the children can be redeemed for fruit skewers, but they were not redeemed and they were told that they could not be returned until 2 p.m. I have to check out at noon, should I wait until 2 o'clock? Then there are charges for everything including the minibar in the room. 1200 a day is not cheap either. The package included a go-kart for my two children. I asked if I could get an extra go-kart, but they refused me directly. Cannot be sent. In the end, I didn‚Äôt take any children with me. There is a charge for the minibar. The minibar we stayed at the previous few days was free. Even the hair dryer bag is written to be charged. Is anyone still using your hair dryer bag? Xiaojiaziqi. The bathroom is also very small, a little bit. It's a bit crowded for kids to go to the toilet. The bathroom is also very small. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the seafood buffet dinner. There is a so-called seafood buffet for more than 300 people. I asked the waiter if there was any freshly squeezed juice. The two waiters looked at each other and finally said, no. I asked a waiter again and he said that only Marriott members can drink it. I said I was a gold card member. He said he would ask. The results told me that there was no dinner, only breakfast. I really laughed. Then the room is not worth the money and the standard of a fast hotel.

Amanda, the housekeeper, added WeChat early and installed all the necessary children's facilities in advance. During the check-in process, everything was detailed and answered every question, and she was very patient. I would like to praise the Changyuan Baking Class again. I didn‚Äôt expect there to be such a large pile of biscuits, full of fragrance and rich in molds. Odelia and other little brothers and sisters are very kind to the little pot friends

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at Marriott. First of all, the location of the hotel is good. You can stroll around the seaside of Yalong Bay in the morning and evening. The scenery is very good. When you arrive at the front desk of the hotel, the service is warm and check-in is fast. The hotel rooms are relatively large and the facilities are very clean. There are many varieties of buffet breakfast There are both Chinese and Western tastes. You can have lunch and dinner at the hotel or at the Dongrong Seafood Food City next to the hotel. There are more choices. It is worth recommending.

Marriott's location is also very good, with Hilton on one side and Sheraton on the other, especially there is a dining plaza just outside the hotel entrance, it's very convenient to buy some bottled water, and you don't have to go as far as Baihuagu
In April, I feel that the temperature of the sea water is still good after 15:30 every day. It is a good choice to bring a swimming ring üõü to float with the waves üåä
There will be a free shuttle bus for those who need to go shopping in the duty-free shop, which is also very convenient

msg:We went to Sanya on the last stop of our honeymoon trip. We booked this hotel for the first-line sea view. It is about 100 meters from the hotel to the beach. It is very close, and the beach facilities are also very good. The swimming pool is clean and the scenery is very good. Walk 200 meters from the hotel lobby to the gate, and you will find coconut chicken in the online celebrity shop. It is strongly recommended as a must-choice hotel for lazy vacationers.
The most important thing is that I have to say that the service is very good and considerate. From the day before check-in, someone called me, added WeChat one day in advance, confirmed our itinerary and arrival time at the hotel, and confirmed the check-in time. Everything was very careful~ Named and praised the commissioner Amanda, from before check-in to when we left the hotel, she sent us travel guides, duty-free shop guides, and asked whether the bedding and services were in place every day, which was really considerate. And to my surprise, we were upgraded to a full sea view suite for free on the day of check-in. It was upgraded to our hearts. There is a big terrace outside. It is really open to the sea. Thanks to the guy at the front desk for his patient service. I forgot his name Yes, where can I go to the beach, the opening hours of the swimming pool, the opening hours of breakfast, etc. are all introduced in detail. Indeed, the service is worthy of special praise.
By the way, because we had an early return flight, we didn't have time to eat breakfast, so we reported it to the guy at the front desk, who asked the hotel to prepare a breakfast bag for us to eat on the way, so there's nothing to say about being considerate~

msg:Marriott is really an old hotel in the C position in Yalong Bay, this time it is a revisit of the old place. The main reason is that the previous hotels I have lived in have been opened for a long time, but the Marriott has recently been renovated. I am very glad that I made the right choice, the location is really good, the equipment is new after the renovation, the service is very good, and Ann, who is similar to the butler service, is also very thoughtful.
The breakfast is not luxurious but it is enough to eat, and there are many restaurants to choose from. We stayed in the hotel for three days and never left the hotel. We insisted on eating three dinners at Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant, the quality and environment are very good. Afternoon tea is at the lobby bar, with a good view and Starbucks to choose from. A great place to lie flat for a holiday. It is convenient to go to the beach, and it is also very close if you like water sports. Will stay again next time.

When I asked if I could continue to stay the next day, I was sorry to inform that the room was full, because there was Meeting, ok, it's okay, just treat it as an experience

Facilities: Because it has just been renovated, the overall facilities are still very good, but it may be because there are many families with children, and there will be a map display on the sofa. I don‚Äôt know what kind of liquid was sprinkled on it. The curtains are also manual, and there may be no wiring at that time Change it again.
Hygiene: As always, it is clean and tidy, even though there are so many guests, there is no dirty thing in the corner! great!
Environment: The first-line sea view is the most attractive part of these hotels in Yalong Bay, and Marriott is no exception. There are also many restaurants. There is a Japanese food restaurant here, Aolige, which tastes good! Because the lobby is on the third floor, you can also take a rest on the third-floor terrace and take pictures of the distance.
Service: In this regard, Marriott has always been very considerate. I would like to talk about the SPA in particular. There is a young girl who is super skilled. Needless to say, the strength is very good. It can be said that the technology is first-class. I will show her pictures later. The name, because it is an English name, I can't remember it! After doing it for two hours, my exhausted body suddenly relaxed a lot! Like it üëç
SPA no-threshold voucher 100 yuan: the price is also very reasonable

Facilities: Fortunately, I was upgraded to a sea view room. The view is very good. The room is not too big, but the comfort is still acceptable. It's quite soundproof, at least I haven't heard the sound from the corridor outside or the next door, but the air conditioner in the room is a bit loud. The swimming pool has two floors, and the jacuzzi is quite comfortable.

Environment: The sand on this beach is not very fine. I didn't try it without taking off my shoes. I don't know if it will hurt my feet. There are many beach chairs!

Diet: The buffet dinner is not bad. I like to eat the freshly fried seafood at the door, but there are not many kinds of seafood. Had a great breakfast!

Service: The attitude of the service staff I encountered was quite good. During the stay, Eve, the customer service specialist, was very thoughtful and responded in a timely manner.

msg:First talk about traffic
It is easy to park and drive by car or take a taxi. The hotel area is quite large, and the main entrance is easy to find on the side of the road. Public transportation did not find it
Secondly, let's talk about the environment
The overall environment of the hotel is good. There is a swimming pool with blue sea, blue sky and tropical trees, and an open-air leisure sea area. Everywhere is clean. There are shovels and small buckets for children to play on the beach. It is very user-friendly. The beach area of the hotel is connected to the hotel next to it. , The Marriott section feels that some places are more piercing, and there are more broken shells. The children's swimming pool is at a constant temperature, and the rest of the water is very cold. When the daytime is around 25 degrees in early January, the scenery at the buffet breakfast is also very good, and there are many seats. The travel photos I sent are good, 5 photos are free, and each photo will be 30 yuan after that
Talk about service again
The service staff are very friendly, basically responsive, and respond quickly. Some babies even gave children travel bath products. There are quite a lot of service staff in the entire hotel area, and they can be found at any time in the morning and evening. What I have to complain about is that the check-in process is very slow , because the previous one did not check out. The check-out process is very fast, there is no need to queue up, there is a fast check-out channel, and you can store your luggage after check-out
Finally, let's talk about the room
The parent-child children's room is a connecting room, which is very suitable for a family, but there is no sea view. One of them has a lot of children's facilities, suitable for children, but the overall area is slightly smaller, but both have bathtubs and showers, which are convenient for bathing.
It is recommended to put a children's stool as a washstand in the children's parent-child room, otherwise it is not enough to brush your teeth and wash your face, and you can prepare a children's toilet

It can‚Äôt be that I only know that I‚Äôm going to pick up a team on the day of my stay, right? The behavior of notifying me after check-in made me feel that I was being played.

msg:Yalong Bay Marriott was booked in the first half of this trip, because the last time I came to Sanya, I lived in Pullman Yalong Bay and Ritz-Carlton. Choose Marriott. Let me talk about the room first. I booked a deluxe sea view room this time. Because it was full when I checked in, I was a little disappointed that I couldn‚Äôt upgrade the room type even if I was a Marriott gold card. The room I was given this time was on the 6th floor, which was slightly out of the way Some, you can still see a good sea view, so you don't care. The room is indeed a bit smaller, the bathroom is a split design, and the side of the toilet is a bit cramped, and it is good to choose Herborist for spare parts. I think the bed in the room is soft and hard. It is not as hard as some people say. The 1.4-meter window width is barely enough to sleep a big and a small. The pillow is a little soft, but it is good to call to change the pillow. The telescopic hanger for the TV is very good, and it can be easily plugged into game consoles such as SWITCH, which is better than the Yanlord Crowne Plaza where I lived later. The drying rack on the balcony is very practical. The swimming pool is divided into upper and lower floors. The few days we went there were relatively warm. It was great to be able to swim in the normal temperature pool. There are many children in the constant temperature pool, which is a bit small. The hotel's breakfast variety is still very rich, and there are not many changes. Gold card members and above can have breakfast at the Edo Silver Restaurant, which avoids a lot of queuing and crowding. Children have free unlimited ice cream from 2-4 pm every day, which is very good. I would like to talk more about the evening buffet on the Central Lawn. First of all, there is a fee. This time, the child I brought here is only 1.2 meters tall and 5 years old. Generally, restaurants are free, and children really can‚Äôt eat much. They have to charge half price here. There is no shortage. The 200 yuan makes people feel uncomfortable. In addition, it is a limited-time discount of 498 people for 398 people, but the dining discount for gold card and above members is gone, which is also uncomfortable... In addition, I went When taking the seat, we need to focus on criticism. It‚Äôs okay if no one greets us when we enter the door. We found a table and sat down (there is a large empty table next to it), and the lead was late after we sat down. The first reaction was not to greet us, but to go to the table and look through her own order book to see if the table we were sitting on was booked out. It took 3 minutes to read it. If there is a reserved table, you will not make a table in advance. sign? So it was a bad feeling to come up, and there was no light on the table after dark, it was a bit dim, and the current weather was indeed a bit cold at night. The dishes themselves are pretty good. There are not many types but the freshness is enough. Basically, it can meet the self-service standard of more than 200 in Beijing. Compared with Sanya in the peak season, the price of 398 is acceptable. Overall, I am relatively satisfied with the hotel. The flaws are not hidden. The children really had a pleasant 4 days in the hotel. I think I will come again next time. In addition, I would like to thank my room butler, ANN, for being responsive and fast ~Looking forward to the next meeting!

He was unhappy and ignored even if he asked more questions. The room was sticky, the carpet was dirty, and the waiters who cleaned the room would not replenish the room's consumables. It is said to be a family hotel, but the smell of the family park is too strong for the children to play, and it is inconvenient to go to the swimming pool at night. When I got there at 9 o'clock in the evening, the waiter started urging them, saying that they would turn off the lights and get off work at 9:50, because they got up at 8 o'clock early. Just went to work. I can't understand it at all. Even if the breakfast is terrible, the attitude of the waiter is also bad.

The service of the butler Ann is very considerate. I have already contacted me in advance to ask about my needs and arrival time before arriving at the hotel. This is really considerate! ! Everything you need can be delivered in time! For me who just came from Tianyu, I feel that the service is a world of difference! !


Facilities: It really has everything that should be there, but I would like to make a suggestion for baby-related things such as slippers, bathrobes and footstools. Can you prepare them earlier. Also, the swimming pool is really dirty. Although I know it‚Äôs outdoors, I‚Äôm mentally prepared, but it‚Äôs understandable that there are leaves and sand in it. It‚Äôs disgusting to see too many flocculent floating objects~ I saw it when I was swimming. There are adults spitting in it, would it be better if more staff were placed to watch over it?

Hygiene: This is really a must üëçFull marks for the room service attitude! We have a baby who is very messy, but the young lady is very careful and conscientious without any impatience!
Environment: The environment is as shown in the picture: Every time I come to Marriott, I am attracted by this huge "seascape painting"! Really never tire of watching it, indulging in it! So beautiful!
Service: The little brother at the front desk is a bit rigid, and the action is so slow! When I first came to check in, the experience was not very good. I can be more enthusiastic. After all, I have traveled all the way here, and I am already very tired. If I keep waiting, I will really collapse.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about catering: breakfast üëçIf you have a Marriott membership, children under 12 are free! This is really good. I have everything I need, but I am not very satisfied with the fruits. There are too few varieties, and the mangoes are too sour. Should the quality be improved? After all, the fruits from Hainan are absolutely sweet! I bought coconuts several times in the hotel, but none of them tasted good. The purchasing manager should check it out after seeing it!
The Chinese restaurant was my failed choice this time. A group of 11 people sat down and no one greeted tea. It might be too busy to ask for boiled water. In the end, I got a few cups. In fact, for Marriott, tea is not required by customers. The food was served very slowly! After eating for more than an hour, there are still two dishes that haven't been served yet. The table next door has been turned over, and the new dishes are all ready to go! Really makes people very angry! The little brother said that my dishes will be slower, my God, I am a scrambled egg and steamed grouper, do I still go to the sea to catch it? I really feel that if you forget it, forget it, but I can't accept this kind of rhetoric. Does it take more than an hour to scramble an egg? The pomfret next door was eaten with only bones left!
The waiter is always missing, like "hide and seek", which makes it easy for me to find for a while. It can only be said that the Chinese restaurant is the worst place I have experienced this time.
Finally, I would like to thank Ann! üëçThe service is thoughtful and enthusiastic
Although there was a bit of an unexpected episode, my overall experience is still five points! üëç
Let's see you in Yalong Bay at the end of June! !

msg:The hotel has been renovated so the room facilities are very new and the hygiene is very good. The garden is full of sense of design, and the garden needs to be cultivated for many years, which is beyond the reach of new hotels. The beautiful scenery in the garden shows the nearly 20-year history of this Marriott. I really like this fusion of old and new. I have eaten in three restaurants, all of which are of a high standard. I did not expect such good Japanese food in Sanya. The swimming pool is amazing, there are many large and small ones, Kangle Eric Wang is handsome and enthusiastic. The hotel service is a five-star hotel with no discounts. You will have the exclusive service of the butler when you check in. Our customer service specialist Eve is very considerate and solves all kinds of small questions. In Yalong Bay, the refurbished Marriott is definitely the most cost-effective.
Let me also say that the mirror of the sky is really good, and it is worth paying to take a shot. Marriott's travel photographer is the best among the three families who took photos during this trip.

Since we went to CI relatively early, the staff checked in patiently. Marriott has more guests and is very popular. We went to the beach to experience it while waiting for the room, some guests were swimming in the sea. The environment of the whole hotel is very good, I like the building color of Marriott very much. The equipment provided by the hotel is from Herborist, which is very comfortable to use. The sand on the beach of Yalong Bay is too thick and the waves are relatively large, which is not conducive to going into the sea. There are many activities on the beach. If you are not short of money, you can try them all. The variety of breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the price/performance ratio is not very high.

msg:Ctrip has been a business traveler for many years, and it is the first time to give a negative review on Ctrip. After Yangkang, I wanted to find a beach for a vacation during the New Year's Eve. After weighing it, I chose Marriott in Yalong Bay. The deluxe twin room selected online is 1600 yuan/night. Because it is a five-star resort hotel, and looking at the picture in the introduction, there are coconut trees and a piece of green, which is acceptable.

I went to check in after five o'clock that day, and was dumbfounded after the room was allocated. The lobby is on the third floor, but the room is on the second floor. After getting the room card, I was told to go downstairs, which felt very strange at the time. After opening the door, he was even more dumbfounded. The window was facing the parking lot. As a resort hotel, the user spends 1,600 yuan a night just to show you the car in the parking lot? No holiday mood at all, feeling like a parking lot security guard.

Call the room service depar**ent on the same day to change the room, or spend money to upgrade the room type. The customer service was a woman, and she directly refused, saying: "Sorry, the rooms are full these two days, and there is no way to change the room type. And we only provide upgrade services for members." I told her directly that if I didn't change the room, I would give a bad review. Paying such expensive money is not to see the parking lot. So she told me that she would help to see if there was a chance to change the room the next day. I called her again at night, and she said that there was a chance to change the room, and she would contact me the next day, but she didn't say when to change, she just asked me to wait. At 12:00 noon the next day, I called the housekeeping depar**ent again and asked about changing rooms. The customer service said that it is currently being cleaned up and will contact me when it is cleaned up. I asked her how to contact her and she said she would call the room number. I directly said, if you can't clean up the room for a long time, I have to wait for you in the room all afternoon? The customer service said that you can pack your luggage first and store it in the lobby. After the new room is ready, you can go to check-in on the same day. I mentioned that it would be inconvenient to pack my luggage, so I left a cell phone number and asked her to call me after the room was vacated. At around 3:30 in the afternoon, the customer service called and said that I could go to the new room. The new room was on the upper floor of the old room, and the view was just similar to the photo in the reservation. Other than that, there are no compensation measures.

After staying here, I have several questions:
1. As a resort hotel, the customer spends such an expensive amount of money to come on vacation. What is the significance of setting up this kind of parking lot room? If you just live in a five-star hotel room, just find one in the urban area that costs 700-800 yuan.
2. It is understandable if the room type has a price gradient, but it should be clearly informed when booking. The photo in the reservation is a green coconut tree, and finally gives a view of the parking lot. Is there a problem of false propaganda? Customers have already spent 1,600 yuan to stay in a hotel. If they know that they are staying in a parking lot, would they care about spending another 200-400 yuan to upgrade the room type?
3. During the entire room change process, I took the initiative to contact the customer service, and the housekeeping depar**ent never took the initiative to contact me. Even if you take the initiative to contact, you just say that you will make a phone call in the room. Do you want the customer to stay in the guest room in the parking lot and wait for your notification? I still proposed to reserve a mobile phone number myself, and contacted by mobile phone. Is this the service attitude that a top five-star hotel should have?
4. Call the customer service that night and say that you want to change rooms or upgrade the room type, even if you pay the difference. The customer service directly refused and said, "I'm sorry, the guest rooms are full these two days, and there is no way to change the room type. And we only provide upgrade services for members." Let alone the question of whether you can change, the meaning of your sentence for members is that What? Indicates the superiority of member users? Non-members are only entitled to live in the parking lot?
5. During the rights protection process, the hotel did not express anything, and did not even think that it was its own problem. Throughout the problem-solving process, as a client, I felt a deep sense of powerlessness.

Finally, I would like to give some advice to those who want to come to Sanya for vacation. Do not book hotels for multiple days in a row. Even if you want to take a vacation for more than five days, it is best to book for 2-3 days first, and then renew if you feel comfortable. If you feel uncomfortable, you can change hotels. If this happens to me, even if I change the room later, it will affect the mood of the vacation because of the previous unhappiness. In addition, remember not to come to Sanya during the peak tourist season. The store is bullying customers and there are too many tourists. As a service provider, you don't care about the feelings of individual customers.

The hotel only provides 4 bottles of water as standard, and the rest will be charged. Delayed check-out is only delayed until 1 o'clock, there is basically no door opening service with fewer doormen, and there are fewer children's amu*****t facilities and more charges.

When I arrived at the hotel early in the morning, the king at the front desk welcomed us very carefully and made arrangements in advance I got a room and got an upgrade. This time is too important to me. I can take a good shower and go to the duty-free shop. I don‚Äôt need to store my luggage and leave with sticky skin. The guest specialist, Sue, is also very enthusiastic. Marriott counts It's an old hotel with a very good location. I feel like I'm getting used to it. It's like coming home. The new hotels don't seem to be so attractive anymore. Have a chance to come again.

Very good attitude! The swimming pool is also great, and the breakfast is good too! Can score ten! Unfortunately, there is a fly in the oin**ent that the beach is too steep, and it will be unsafe for children and adults who cannot swim! Going to the beach to play, you have to go to the sea to feel it! But this is not a problem with their family. The Sheraton Tianyu Mangrove next to it is in front of it, and the beach is filled with heights, it's all like this!

msg:A perfect trip, this is the second time I have come to Marriott, because the first impression was good, so I chose Marriott for this trip. It was off-season and there were very few people, so it was a VIP service throughout the whole process. Thank you, Sue, the guest commissioner for your enthusiasm throughout Service, I asked if I had any special needs before I traveled, and I was kindly upgraded to a full sea view suite with two large sea view balconies. Children have enough space to play, and adults can stay in a daze on the balcony from morning to night. We stayed for two days. Basically all room service, eating in a daze facing the sea view. On the day of check-out, because I had no place to stay after checking out with my children, SUE helped us apply for a late check-out, thank her very much! Every staff here is very helpful, and I should choose Marriott without hesitation next time!

I only stayed for three days this time, but I felt very comfortable. After the decoration, the hardware also followed up, which is good. The service level of the hotel has always been very high, especially the service commissioner sue, and the service is meticulous. There is nothing that can deduct points for the stay experience. Next time you come to Sanya, you should still choose Yalong Bay Marriott.

Service: Not to mention service, the concierge in the lobby ignores any answer, and even sells sales items in private. It costs 180 for an extra breakfast, but the quality of the breakfast is not worth the price at all. A lot of things are missing, or they are all lacking.
What's even more ridiculous is that after I checked out, the hotel staff harassed me through WeChat and phone calls and asked me to give the hotel a five-star review. I really don't know where their faces came from.

As shown in the picture below, I booked a double bed room with sea view, and then they arranged for me a room with no view of the sea at all, a room full of coconut trees, and then I called To the front desk, they said that the sea view room is such a room, I asked them that this is to deceive customers, the picture is completely different from the real thing, because I am a Marriott member, and then I can upgrade the room for free, they always said that there is no room (in fact, there is a room) Yes, I have seen all the major platforms that can be ordered, but they are not willing to give it to me) I said then I will check out, and then I said that I would be upgraded to a room that was exactly the same as the picture, and I laughed angrily at the time Oh, what is this called? The room I originally booked should be like this. Give me the worst, and then give you a so-called room upgrade. At that time, I just wanted to leave this so-called five-star hotel. Finally, the manager called and said immediately Upgraded from the new house, why do you think it's necessary, the matter is finally settled, and I'm in a bad mood
And the service staff is also very average. When I stayed at the Westin Hotel before, everyone greeted you very friendly. The people here basically don‚Äôt take the initiative to say hello.
The choice of hotel for this honeymoon trip was really wrong.
By the way, WeChat customer specialists are still available, and the others are fine.

msg:Yalong Bay Marriott Hotel is simply wonderful! The room facilities are good, clean, the sea view room can see the sea, the hotel has its own beach, there are several swimming pools, and there are many restaurants, all of which are great!
The hotel took the initiative to upgrade to a sea view room, the service is very meticulous in all aspects, and the attitude is very good.
Many kinds of breakfast are delicious (Figures 10-13).
The Chinese restaurant is a bit expensive, but it tastes good in enough quantity. There is a group purchase package for two, which seems to be 380, with a lot of varieties. (Picture 19) There is a big fish in the picture. This package is definitely no problem for three people.
In the evening, I went to the fish bar by the sea and ate the 799 set menu (pictures 16-18), which included steak, lamb chops, lobster, meat skewers, fish, shrimp, grilled mushrooms, grilled eggplant, as well as bread and salad. Enough for four people. The taste is great, eating skewers and seafood at the seaside, drinking beer in a particularly good mood, and also very good. The Japanese restaurant may be closed due to the epidemic, and it is a pity not to eat.
Afternoon tea in the lobby bar is delicious and inexpensive (pictures 14-15), 288 for two. The scenery outside the window is super beautiful.
The water in the swimming pool is clean, and swimming is very comfortable; the gym is 24 hours, unattended, you can enter by yourself, and the facilities are also good.
The last picture is the food area in front of the hotel. There are supermarkets, food courts, Ye Xiaoai coconut chicken, and Korean restaurants. The hotel battery car can be reached immediately.
We came to Sanya for our honeymoon this time. Unexpectedly, the epidemic broke out as soon as we arrived. We were trapped in the Yalong Bay Resort. Thinking of static management, we could not go anywhere.
During the static management period, the price proposed by the hotel is also very satisfactory, and I feel that we have earned it! Thank you Marriott for giving us such a good environment and service. Although we encountered an epidemic on our honeymoon, we felt that our stay in Marriott was worthwhile! Will stay at Marriott in the future!

2. The pillow was so soft that it was very uncomfortable. I had a stiff neck and my wife had insomnia all night. It was very, very bad.
3. For a room that costs NT$2,000 for a bowl, the small refrigerator does not come with Coke and 7-up. A can of NT$30 is too much.
To sum up, I won‚Äôt stay here again, it‚Äôs rubbish

The bedding, tables and chairs, floor tiles, tableware, doors and windows, and sanitary ware all reveal an antique a**osphere. You may just scratch the white, and feel cheated The hotel's dead duck insisted that they were newly renovated, and felt that they were deceived by Ctrip's promotion. It's Chinese New Year... the service is quite satisfactory; the Sheraton, MGM, and Ritz-Carlton next door are just what they are. Never over-promoted, Ctrip also has a big problem

Because it is a gold member, the front desk will upgrade the sea view room for free. The only shortcoming of this stay is the construction of the Yalong Bay beach, which makes the hotel beach unable to go to the sea. Everything else is very good, I will choose Marriott next time I come to Yalong Bay.

msg:From the day before check-in, guest commissioners Ellen and Sue provided cordial and warm service and asked about my check-in time. Checked out at 12:00 at the next hotel at noon, and checked in immediately when we arrived at the Marriott. The children were able to catch up and take a nap, which was super comfortable.
This is my second visit to Yalong Bay Marriott. The first time was in January 2020. My child was just one year old and was about to leave Marriott when the epidemic broke out. It can be said that Marriott is my last good memory before the epidemic. Revisited again this time, and it's still beautiful.
The child has also grown up. He has participated in the Doctor of Plant activity in the hotel, and has learned a lot of plants and learned a lot of knowledge. In particular, the iron watermelon impressed him deeply. The crab catching activity at night was also very interesting. Brother harry and brother boss took them to play together and learned to catch crabs. The children were very happy.
In the swimming pool, you can borrow swimming rings and hand-cranked boats. The children of the hand-cranked boat can‚Äôt stop playing and unlock new postures.
There are free sand digging tools to borrow on the beach, and there are many beach chairs. You can just lie down and watch the baby dig sand, saving effort and bringing the baby.
There are indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds, various projects, and children's pools. The beach is very soft, and it is very easy to bring children.
Now I'm going to nitpick. The arrangement of the children's project is not the same as the schedule, which makes me confused. In addition, there are too many mosquitoes in the children's area. When participating in the ultra-light clay, the children were flying around by mosquitoes, and they ran away after a while. The outdoor children's playground is also not cleaned, it looks dirty. There are many mosquitoes when swimming in the evening. People who are afraid of mosquitoes can't bear this, and they are bitten several times in an instant. Hope to improve

msg:I originally booked a parent-child room, but when I arrived at the hotel with two big babies, I found that this parent-child room is only suitable for a family room with a child under 5 years old. The room layout is very suitable for children, but there is no balcony! No balcony! No balcony! I went to the front desk to coordinate with the mood to try it out. Thanks to George, after understanding the situation, he gave us a free upgrade to the invincible sea view room. The large balcony not only has a good view, but is also suitable for children to hang their clothes after playing in the swimming pool üòõ I stayed a lot on this trip to Sanya Hotels, but the best service is Marriott, Tina always cleaned the room and changed the bathrobe and towels in time after we went to the pool. Maybe because of the construction of the beach, there are not so many people in the whole hotel, it is very quiet, and there are many activities by the swimming pool in the hotel, which is suitable for children and not so noisy. If you want a clean and beautiful holiday, it is recommended to come to Marriott!
PS: The child won the championship in the pool shooting competition and won a free afternoon tea (see Figure 1). I like it so much! The breakfast is also very rich ü•∞

If I had known this, I would have changed hotels.
Originally, I was also a Marriott Platinum member. Fortunately, the jw Marriott in Haitang Bay brought back my impression that I was a Marriott this time. Otherwise, I would not choose Marriott‚Äôs brand again in the future. It‚Äôs really too bad.
After checkin, I saw that others seemed to have lost their afternoon tea.
I just asked the hotel by the way, do we have one?
The hotel says that there are sea view rooms, but not garden view rooms, so isn‚Äôt the beach a facility that all guests of your hotel can use?
I feel that the attitude is very average, it's the same as being graded
I won't choose again next time, and the hotel didn't inform me in advance, and I didn't tell the truth when I asked...
I'm really speechless. Isn't it just a picture of a beach in Yalong Bay, can you go to the sea?

msg:I brought my family to Sanya for vacation and chose Marriott. The check-in queue was too long and there were two queues. I arrived at the hotel at 2:00 pm. The first time I finished the check-in procedure, it was 2:58 pm. I was told that the room had not been cleaned, and I was told to wait for about 15 minutes when the room was cleaned. I will be notified by phone. We went to have lunch first, but after lunch, we went to the front desk to get the room card and continued to line up. (This feeling is very bad, it takes too much time to check in)
The hotel environment is very good. It's a pity that this time I came to catch up with the government's sand mining construction, and I couldn't swim in the sea. It's a little regrettable. Swimming in the hotel pool every day is also good. What impressed me about Marriott is that from the doorman to the waiter, they are very polite and have a super good attitude. They will take the initiative to say hello when they meet.
The housekeeper Xirong arranged the room for us very carefully and gave us a surprise. Thank you Xirong for your attentive service!
Also great service from guest specialists Sue and Ellen!
The Edo Silver Japanese Restaurant in the Marriott Hotel is delicious, you can try it, especially the volcano beef rice is very delicious üòã
Finally, a small suggestion. The hair dryer in the room is too old and not easy to use. It can be replaced with a new one, which is not worthy of the grade of a 5-star hotel. And swimming every day requires shampooing every day, and the frequency of use of the hair dryer is quite high.
All in all a great holiday!

msg:Lying down is the best way to travel in Sanya. Going on vacation in Sanya is basically a "bubble" hotel. I have always liked Yalong Bay. After all, the best beach in Sanya is in Yalong Bay. The hotels here have their own exclusive beaches. The sand is coral sand, as fine as flour, and you can swim in the sea at any time, which is a good feeling!

This time, I stayed at Yalong Bay Marriott Resort Hotel with my children. The location of the hotel is really good. It is very comfortable facing the sea. It takes about 2-3 minutes from the room to the beach. Through the garden, we can see the beautiful sea view of Yalong Bay. Renovated in 2019, the room is very new, the View is beautiful & beautiful, the room is quiet, we live in a twin-bedded room with a view, 2 beds of 1.4 meters; independent balcony, three of us are not crowded, Marriott is Yalong Bay The newest and youngest five-star hotel among the five-star hotels;

Here are five special things that make Marriott Resorts Special:
1. Breakfast from 7:30 to 11:00 (super long time), with an outdoor location, full of casual style;
2. Folding cool clothes rack on the balcony,
3. As soon as the balcony door is closed, the air conditioner will automatically turn onüîõ;
4. The toiletries of Wucaoji are really the light of domestic products in my heart;
5. Hotel-specific travel photography, one-to-one travel photography service by professional photographers and 5 exquisite electronic photos;
Where it shines:
The net red seaside swing is worth punching in. It looks quite ordinary. When the photo is taken, it is immediately vivid.
The service is goodüëç, the customer specialist Sue "connected" with me in the shortest time, the service is thoughtful, every time I encounter a problem, there is a solution, including Ellen;
Amenities around the hotel:
1. Dongrong Food Court:
It only takes 2-3 minutes to walk from the Marriott lobby to the popular food court, Dongrong Food Plaza. There are seafood stalls and barbecues on the entrance square. There are many restaurants in Dongrong Food Plaza, Wang Sicong's coconut chicken, seafood, and Thai food. , Korean BBQ, Anhui Cuisine, Sichuan Cuisine, Hong Kong-style Tea Restaurant, Qingbuliang, whatever you want to eat here;
2. Yalong Bay Outlets;
3. Baihuagu Commercial Center

Although there are some areas in the room that need to be improved (for example, a small trash can should be placed near the sink), the sea view is amazing!

It happened that it was renovated during the epidemic, and Marriott lived in a relatively comfortable place. Although the room area is not large, it can be seen that the designer has brought the minimalist style to the extreme. All the designs are easy to use, the space is maximized, and it is very comfortable to live in. Sea view room is a must, the view is amazing. The swimming pool here is very large and of various types, suitable for children to play. The hotel provides various swimming tools and sand digging tools for free for hotel guests to use, which is very good. Needless to say, the beach in Yalong Bay is the most delicate, and the sea water is also the best. The breakfast is slightly substandard, and the ingredients are the most basic and common, which needs to be improved a lot. Overall evaluation: Yalong Bay is the most cost-effective and the most comfortable parent-child hotel.

I usually write travel guide posts to share on various platforms, and this experience is completely thunderous! !

Similar to the whole season, the old facilities in the room are also very poor, moldy and moldy, broken and damaged, and the room is changed in the middle. There is a room full of smoke smell. How can children stay? Asked to change rooms and made me wait in the aisle for thirty or forty minutes without any apology from the staff? Pulling~ Then, the staff seemed to be awake one by one. When they asked, they didn't answer. They looked very worried. Or just be as super strong as the front desk manager, that's all! Can't do it!

breakfast:
My God, the attitude is cold and amazing. It is the first time I have seen such a resort hotel at home and abroad. It completely ruined the mood of going out for vacation. The last is the meal. The breakfast was too unpalatable to eat at all. For lunch at the Chinese restaurant, the fish was undercooked and bloody! What else can I say, at this level, it is not an exaggeration to be positioned as a fast hotel. Quickly come to see the sea, and there is no way to compare with other Marriott hotels in Sanya. The only good thing is that the staff and cleaning aunts in the hotel's children's playground are very friendly. I am a Marriott Platinum Card member. If I ask about any activities, I can only help ironing clothes? Absolutely! Thousands of dollars to live in the heart, living here is a big resen**ent! It's utterly dilapidated! In addition to spending money on review scores, can't you improve your management level? No pictures, no truth, welcome to watch!

Especially children's activities, I don't know why so few children participate, but it is very interesting. The little brothers and sisters are also very enthusiastic and responsible. The children are very happy to catch crabs, draw and golf. Thank you housekeeper ellen for your hello, praise!

The service meals are all up to the standard, that is, there is no indoor parking lot and the car is too hot. The full sea view room is also very beautiful, the decoration is relatively new, and the exclusive guest housekeeper Ellen is enthusiastic.

It is also the first time I have a new understanding of this international brand. On the first day, I put a Do Not Disturb light in the room. The waiter knocked on the door twice. My biological clock was reversed, and I had a bad temper when I got up. The second time I told the waiter not to knock on the door again, and the cleaning team would inform the front desk. The result was that the next day, it was totally different. Please hang up. After turning on the do not disturb light, the hotel room service depar**ent called me at 3:10 pm and said, Sir, your room has a do not disturb light. I called to ask if it is convenient for you to disturb me. Haha, such an excellent hotel is really amazing.

Marriott&#39;s guest specialists Ellen and Sue contacted me before I left, and they responded to me promptly when I had any questions, very nice! The old mother explained that she will continue to stay at Marriott for vacation in Sanya this coming year. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is very good. I eat dinner in the Chinese restaurant every day. My favorite is the fried razor clam with ginger and green onion. The fish bar restaurant was very good last year, but this year it is a bit out of standard. I have done SPA twice in the hotel, the price is OK and the environment is also very good, the service of the physiotherapist Connie is very good.

I thought that Qiming‚Äôs services in the old hotel are more mature, but I didn‚Äôt expect to check in at 4:30 in the afternoon. The smell of smoke in the room was very strong, and the elevator smelled of smoke. After changing the room, the hotel tried its best to like the money. There is no free one in the minibra, and there is a charge. The breakfast is hard to describe. When I booked, I didn‚Äôt see breakfast for only one person. (It‚Äôs full of routines, please pay attention) On-site extra breakfast is 180, which is the worst breakfast I have eaten. It is always a hotel with no sense of service and no attention to hygiene, 10,000 yuan A thousand yuan is not cheap. I hope that the merchant will do business honestly. I must tell the truth if I don‚Äôt comment much.
Please order carefully.

msg:From Connian, EDITION, Atlantis, Ritz-Carlton to Marriott, Marriott's rooms are the smallest, and the pool is not so clean compared to the others, and the minibar in the room has to be used for drinks. There is a charge, 60 yuan for two cans of Coke, which is not available in other Sanya hotels, and other hotels are free of minibar drinks. It can be seen that Yalong Bay Marriott still stays in the service standard of previous years, and even puts it in the room. Charged drinking water is also a value-added service that has been slowly removed from high-end hotels in the past two years. Others are generally ok, the room has been renovated and compact and reasonable, the breakfast is rich, and the beach is relatively close, but the swimming pool and the beach also do not have free drinking water, and a bottle of water has to be charged. This time Sanya has lived in so many beaches. The drinking water for the swimming pool and the hotel is provided for free by the hotel. It is really puzzling. The rooms can get free drinking water. Why are there no beaches and swimming pools? Let's hope Marriott can keep up with the times. In addition, because the hotel spa indicated that there is a manicure and hairdressing service, I spent more than 300 yuan to do a nail. It's puzzling too expensive.

The 398 set meal for the first night, lunch and dinner, fish and meat taste 80 points, the small amount is scary. 50 points for other dishes, the white cut chicken is really unpalatable! There is nothing to eat for breakfast. The hotel has few guests due to the epidemic. It is understandable considering the cost. The chef's attitude is very black-faced, ordering a Xiaolongbao is not steamed, and eating a mouthful of raw meat is really enough. Upon seeing this, the waiter in the dining hall sent two days of freshly squeezed juice, which is highly praised! Two days later, I transferred to MGM. The sea view suite was 399 more expensive, the room was three times bigger, and the balcony was ten times bigger (see picture 2)! The 498 set meal at Zhongdian is really delicious. The two of them couldn't finish eating and packed two dishes back to the room. From the price of the room, to the meals produced in the dining hall, to the service, MGM is perfect! Goodbye Marriott.

Mealsüçö: The hotel meals are quite good, especially the Chinese-style two-person set menu, which is cost-effective and tastes good. The pizza and barbecue are also beyond expectations.
Room üö™: The size of the room is enough for couples to travel. The room is cleaned and replaced in time. The sea view is very good, and you can see the usage of the swimming pool, which is convenient for going down when there are few people.

Minor shortcomings:
The small wall lamp at the entrance of the room is not very friendly to the small 158, and it is easy to bump into it. During the stay, it bumped three times üò¢;
Buffet breakfast, freshly squeezed juices presented by Gold members are sometimes absent.

The commercialization of tourism in Sanya is more serious, and the best way to vacation should be hotel tours. There are many hotels here, the competition is fierce, and the hotel facilities and service level, Marriott should be regarded as the leader. Standing in the lobby bar of the hotel, looking at the blue sea and blue sky, coconut grove lawn, and the feeling of being in Miami... Two days before the check-in, I received a service call from the guest commissioner Ann and Jean Wan, and everything was arranged early. , and then the concierge Jay and Anna took the initiative to follow up to greet me and help me upgrade my room. It was a god-like trea**ent. The hotel environment is good, the breakfast is rich, the price of afternoon tea is beautiful and the value is high, and the buffet is arranged for dinner, so there is no need to join in the fun and be slaughtered!
Anyway, I spent the whole day in the hotel, and I was not wasting at all. The beautiful photos I posted made many friends envy, jealous and hate.

The facilities in the room are relatively new, and the baby is equipped with its own toiletries. Since the overall catering business in Yalong Bay is still relatively small, the hotel's catering prices are actually not much different from those outside, especially the baby's package, which is rich and delicious. However, the seafood hot pot barbecue for dinner in the hotel has a few varieties, but the overall quality is relatively fresh. The hotel's own beach is very good, the sand is soft and the waves are small, unlike the rough waves of Haitang Bay. The hotel swimming pool is also very clean, and hotel members can use the swimming ring for free. The children's playground is in a relatively remote place, which includes a children's water world, an ocean ball area and a sand digging area, as well as a place for renting bicycles. About a three-minute walk from the hotel is the self-operated commercial dining area. The price is slightly higher and group purchases are available. The hotel service staff was kind, gave the baby a tiger doll, and added consumables in the room according to our requirements. Gold members are also presented with an afternoon tea. Overall it's still pretty good.

As a result, I could only see a small part of the room from the balcony, which is a lot worse than the previous experience of staying in MGM. Compared with the price of the same room type : First, the size of the room is too small; second, the sea view is relatively small; third, it took a long time to check in; the service at breakfast was especially poor, the waiter with the seat assigned the seat, and when I raised an objection to change a seat , has been pulling her face, as if others owed her (of course, this is also an individual waiter, not killed with a stick, but this also shows the defect of the five-star hotel in service). Finally, I have to mention the issue of the hotel's Edo Yinri restaurant, because the dinner is included in the room rate on New Year's Eve, I made a special call to confirm, and the hotel also called me to explain that I can go directly at 6:30 pm , It has been confirmed that it is a guest who has made an appoin**ent at 18:30. As a result, the waiter said that we were not sure and needed to wait for the manager, so he put us aside. dishes, otherwise I don't know if I have to wait a few hours to confirm. The only thing I feel happy about is that there are fruits, two apples and sugar oranges on New Year's Eve (I posted the picture). In short, next time I choose the old Hilton, I won't choose Marriott again.

1. Although the room complains that it is "all season", it may be mainly because the walls are bare. But the comfort and convenience of use is still the standard of star-rated hotels. There are different lighting modes in the room, and the bedding is also very comfortable.
2. The lobby bar is very comfortable, you can see the sea, and it is very close to the sea.
3. The breakfast is very rich, and there is basically no queue, which is much better than Sofitel Lee and Man.
4. Probably the largest beach in Yalong Bay, the beach is very cool.
5. The bad place: the entertainment part is scattered, the swimming pool is on one side, not very open.

On the whole, if you live in Yalong Bay, the comfort of Marriott's new decoration is correct.

When booking the room, I didn't know that the sea view big bed room was actually a corner room, and basically all I saw was the garden landscape. , you can directly choose the deluxe double room if you mind.

msg:I booked a trip to Sanya in December, and I also booked it with Marriott. As a result, Hangzhou canceled the flight due to the epidemic and had to cancel the trip. The epidemic in Hangzhou was under control, and it was scheduled again in January. Marriott Hotel will call in advance to care about the flight situation and service. Very good, we added money to upgrade the full sea view room, and sure enough, the price is one cent. Thank you to the staff kitty for helping to upgrade the room. We have been communicating by phone and have a good attitude. You can see the sea as soon as you enter the room, and you can also use it on the bed. Seeing the sea, it's great, sitting on the balcony looking at the blue sky and white clouds on the beach, all the troubles can disappear, the room is newly renovated, it is relatively new in Yalong Bay, the room is relatively small, but it is acceptable , will come again next time!

The seaside is good, it‚Äôs very good, but the price of your sales of marine entertainment items is very messy. If you don‚Äôt play at one price for a while, you can still get a discount.

I made a reservation two weeks in advance, but because there was no room on the day, I arranged a room on the first floor. The waiter said that he had never brought a guest to live on the first floor, and he didn't know him. . The room smells like damp! Changing rooms only gives lower and lower grades. . The water from the tap in the room was dirty. . The night before, we agreed that breakfast would be delivered after 10 o'clock, but we knocked on the door at 7 o'clock in the morning and called. . . When we went out of the room to the swimming pool and came back, the room card was invalid. The waiter asked us to wait outside the door for half an hour in swimming clothes before opening the room door. . . Never seen such a poor five-star hotel. . Big shop cheating? ? ? ?

It was originally a Marriott Gold Card, but there was no upgrade arrangement during Chris**as and New Year's Day. You can use your gold card to get discounts at the lobby bar, which is great üôÇ The hotel has a beach. When there are many people, you can‚Äôt get beach chairs. There are many vendors selling coconuts and drinks on the beach. It is not part of the hotel, but it is convenient and cheap.

The first greeting staff went to the front desk, then to the housekeeping depar**ent, and then to the brothers and sisters in the children's activity depar**ent! Rooms were very tight for Chris**as. When we arrived, there were almost no rooms left. Two days later, Judy at the platinum card front desk upgraded us to a suite! Just seeing this name and all the other front desk staff were very nice and patient! ! Aunt Gao from the customer service depar**ent also did a great job cleaning and even folded small animals in towels for the children! What moved us the most was that when we first arrived in the room, we had two babies with us because we were afraid that they would fall when they were playing around on the floor. We wanted to put something on the floor. We went downstairs for dinner and came back to find a handsome little guy using a white floor mat to put it on the floor. The room is paved with patchwork shaped carpets! If this kind of Suguo is not a hard-working person, he will never be able to do the little things that our parents may not even think of! I am so touched... This handsome guy from the customer service depar**ent seems to have the last name Xu. If the hotel sees this, please be sure to reward this handsome guy from the housekeeping depar**ent! In fact, everyone is very nice! A few brothers and sisters who came to the hotel to organize activities for children felt that they were too patient and asked them for their names! Judy Leo Rex Haley ula odelia really feels that Marriott's service can definitely do everything before the customer asks for it. She is so patient that we were constantly moved during this trip...Thank you again to all the Marriott staff! ! ! Congratulations to you for doing such a good job with your work in mind! !

It is very commercial, and the room is full of all kinds of things for sale and details of charges. The breakfast was good and rich. Universal service is also good, but spotty. When booking, confirm twice if the Marriott Gold Card has a room, can it be upgraded, the answer is yes. After I came, I said that there was no room, and there was really no way. But the next day, a phone call came to the room asking for the card number. First of all, I gave it when I checked in. I asked why I should provide it again. Anyway, I didn&#39;t enjoy any rights. I replied that it would be used to check out when I could delay it. I don&#39;t understand this, does this require a card number? Then I asked casually if I couldn&#39;t upgrade for a few days. At this time, the answer was slapped in the face, saying that the gold card cannot be upgraded to a suite, and I already booked the highest level that the gold card can give. Why didn&#39;t you say twice before you can&#39;t upgrade? If I didn&#39;t, I would book a luxury sea view and then upgrade to a full sea view. Why do I need to spend more money to book it? Then many ants in the room responded to the situation with Sue on the day they checked out. She listened carefully and solved it. She also contacted me in advance, and the response speed was also very fast. I am satisfied. Just when I thought this hotel might not be that bad, there was a staff member in the swimming pool who kept staring at it with extremely uncomfortable eyes, and even walked over to look at it a few times, not to mention professionalism, not even basic quality? ?

msg:The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated, and the front desk brother has a very good service attitude. He also reminded the breakfast location and elevator location very carefully.
The room facilities are new, and the decoration is high-end and stylish, and it feels like living in a log cabin when you enter the door. However, there is no exhaust fan in the toilet, which caused a bad smell in the room after going to the toilet.
The waiter in the restaurant has a good service attitude, and the service is proactive and enthusiastic, but the facilities in the breakfast room are slightly old, and the dishes in the cafe are slightly more expensive.
The hotel has a beach. The sand is very fine and clean. The hotel provides free beach tools and swimming rings.
The hotel park is very large, with good greenery and a slightly small swimming pool.
The concierge in the lobby recommended a car to Yalong Bay Forest Park, but did not explain in detail that it was through someone else buying tickets and arranging the car.
When I checked out on the last day, I paid a half-day room rate and said it was delayed until 18:00, and the room was cleaned very clean, but I came to urge check-out just 10 minutes after 18:00, which was not very good.
Summary: The hotel has a good environment, new facilities, good service, and it is worth staying.

msg:1. When checking in, the front desk was not very enthusiastic or professional, and some small details were not very comfortable.
2. On the way to the room, I saw two real estate agents in Sanya, a row of claw machines with clay powder and clay powder. The whole lobby is not for commercial use. Entering the corridor, it feels like a fast hotel. Open the room and the decoration is indeed relatively new, but The space is narrow and narrow, like an all-season with a bathtub. Can't believe this is the standard of a star hotel.
3. A row of retail water is placed in the most conspicuous place of the room, with a price list next to it. Let me dream back to the guest house in the fringe of urban and rural areas. In fact, these things can be put into the minibar, and you need to pick it up. It feels like staying here is more like staying in a certain store. Before opening the hotel's equipment, you have to check if there are any marked prices.
4. The water presented by the hotel is a small bottle, and the packaging is really not as good as one dollar of Master Kong. I can't believe that this is the level of a star hotel.
5. I have arrived at the room, and I call to inform me to pay the deposit. Isn't the deposit required to be determined when you check in. The phone said two thousand deposits, and then another two thousand five. It feels very unprofessional, and not everyone needs to pay a deposit. I asked the staff, they explained it for a long time and I didn't understand it. He said that Ctrip didn't need to pay for it, but Fliggy had to pay it. But I was set by Ctrip.
6. At 7 o'clock in the morning, I was awakened by the voice of the staff in the corridor. I felt that two or three people were talking all the time. The soundproofing was really worrying.
7. There is no view on the balcony of the room. Looking back, the sea view room is about a hundred or so far behind our reservation, but the front desk does not remind you that the experience of staying with other hotels is completely heaven and earth.
8. The beach in front of the hotel, the sand is hard, and the sea is full of buoys. They are all kinds of commercial boats. The beach is messy, and it is completely impossible to stay by yourself. All kinds of sales and harassment will not be driven away. The experience is very poor. The hotel is uncomfortable, and the beach outside is uncomfortable.
9. So I hurried to change hotels after staying for one day. When we checked in at another hotel, we found that our ID was still occupied by their backstage. We called and asked to go through, but the other party did not apologize, and asked if we did not return? Which room are you in? After a little communication, it would have been good for a few minutes. We waited for a long time, and the front desk of the new hotel helped us check in in other ways.
Summary: Define the standard of star rating, the installation standard of fast chain hotels, and unprofessional service. See quality for details, but this one has no quality.
The first bad review in my life, given to Marriott, it's worth it! !

Service: Some are good, some are rigid. Not all the freshly squeezed juices for breakfast are provided, only members can provide it, so I don't feel good. Later, another waiter gave special trea**ent to arrange juice. However, I still feel that Marriott's breakfast in other cities comes standard with juice, and members are required here, which is a bit unpleasant.
Check-in experience: The room is 45 square meters, which is relatively small in Yalong Bay. The children's club is a little far from the main building. However, although there are activities listed during May 1, there are no children there at all. My family took the children to a private venue, and I didn't feel very good, and there was no company.
In general, I don't think it is suitable to take children, especially under the epidemic

The hotel upgraded my room type for free. The breakfast is rich in variety and the quality of the dishes is high. If you miss the breakfast, you can switch to a full-time breakfast, which means you can come here for lunch and dinner.
The beach and sea water of Yalong Bay is the best in Sanya, and the hotel is just like a private beach when it walks out of the sea.
The hotel also presented moon cakes on the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival.
In general, the only thing that made me more satisfied with this trip to Sanya was staying at the Marriott Hotel.

Self-driving/renting a car is more convenient, and parking is easy to park during the Mid-Autumn Festival.
üßπHygiene:
The cleaning aunt is very good, she will ask if she needs a turn-down when she passes by on the way, and she cleans it very well.
However, some of Marriott's facilities are not good. First, why is there no trash can under the washbasin? I have been to so many hotels, but there is no trash can under the washbasin. There are trash cans in the toilet and bedroom in the whole room. It's not a big deal, but it's very inconvenient. Secondly, the soap tray where the soap is placed has serious accumulation of water. Why don't you use one with better hydrophobicity? It feels sticky every time I use it, and the experience is very bad.
üîîService:
In addition to the fish bar, Marriott‚Äôs other basic services are good, but the small place is not detailed enough and lacks humanity, which makes it inconvenient. Back to the fish bar, we ordered the order in the evening. The waiter forgot the order. We asked ourselves. He only found out that he didn't do it. The waiter mentioned that the food was no longer served at 9:30. When we went, it was around 8:30. I suspect it was deliberate. I either just said it was too late and couldn't do it, or I quickly apologized. Marriott's other services are good, but this one is really bad.
üçÉEnvironment:
The greenery and beaches of the hotels on Yalong Bay are better than those of Dadonghai and Xiaodonghai. The gardens of the old hotels can still be strolled at night. Along the beach, I saw other hotels MGM, Sheraton, and finally I felt like Marriott. The design is more comfortable. Marriott's other things are okay, but they are not humane enough.
ü•óFood:
The breakfast was bad. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I set it expensive or in time for the holidays. The quality of the meal is not good, but the mussels taste okay. The desserts are really not delicious. The caramel bread pudding is crying and crying. Desserts and bread are not delicious, and there are few types. The rooms on a certain mountain and certain island are large, with a panoramic sea view of about 1500, and the Marriott is faster than 2500. The room is not big, and the breakfast is not as good as the mountain‚Äôs.

It also depends on the location and infrastructure, and the rest is very mediocre. Rooms, catering, and a home away from home are just four words, which is too difficult to do.

The first three times were May 2018, June 2018, and November 2019. This time is September 2021

This time staying in room 3022.

üßπHygienic: The free partridge tea cup at the entrance of the lobby is very dirty, and there are lipstick marks used by other guests. Reflected on duty manager Anna He, I hope you can be more serious about cleaning the cups.

üçÉEnvironment: Good as always, very comfortable, beautiful, and the beach is clean. The decoration of the spa is a bit outdated, but the technicians are very good.

üîîService:
1 house keeping: very good
2 Restaurant: Edo Gin's occupancy rate is 40% when it is full. 3 The cafe service is very good, enthusiastic and positive.
4 Chinese restaurant Wanhao Xuan: service is acceptable.
5 Lobby bar: service is acceptable.
6 room service: acceptable.
7 Swimming pool: good service
8 Crane machine: The service is terrible! The No. 19 children's machine that grabs colored small bags, and those children's machines, eggs, carts, etc., can be said to be money scams. I have reflected my opinions to the store, but I haven't seen any rectifications, so I can only post my opinions here. I caught Pikachu with 2 coins, and the rabbit with 5 coins. I am a master of doll catchers, but I couldn't catch the pink bag of the 19th machine with more than 40 coins. Because the place visited by the 19th machine, the colored small bags, except for the one in the middle, are all placed out of the reach of the claws. I found the problem on the first day and went to the store for advice. The store promised to adjust, but there was no improvement on the second day, third day, and fourth day. Then I have to expose the complaint here.

Parents with children, please be careful not to be fooled by the child's high-level claw machine. Too cheating.

üí©Food quality: On the whole, the decline is quite obvious.

For breakfast in the cafe, all fillings of pasta are substandard. Wonton five big three thick skin is very thick and sticky to the teeth. The dumplings have thick skins and small fillings. The stuffing is small and tasteless.

Cafe night seafood hot pot: The coconut chicken soup base is delicious, but the hot dishes in the dinner buffet, fried crabs, are salty, too salty. The overall taste is northeast. If I want to eat Northeastern cuisine, I will go to Harbin, and I will not come to Sanya. Who doesn't want to eat the local specialties of Sanya?

Man Ho Chinese Restaurant: The taste is also northeast. Can't you cook authentic Cantonese food? The yellow croaker is especially fishy, and the sauce is very salty. Spinach in the soup, it takes too long to cook. Unfortunately, this restaurant is too bad for Cantonese cuisine. Compared with the JW Marriott Shunde cuisine in Haitang Bay, there is a gap.

Lobby bar: The trea**ent of elite members has been severely reduced.
Canceled Friday‚Äôs free cocktail party for happy hour elite members.
The afternoon tea that I once sent, all kinds of snacks are gone. Just give coconut jelly. That's terrible.

üòòThe techniques of the Spa technicians are well received. Connie is very good and very professional and skilled. I did the Spa for three days in a row. Recommend hot stone spa.

The fitness swimming pool in the children's club is always well received. It's just that the lifeguard is there sometimes, and sometimes not. It should be there all the time. First, if a guest has a problem with swimming, the lifeguard can help. The second is that it is too close to the children‚Äôs club. If a child enters the adult swimming pool, it is not good if it drowns.

Picture 1 Picture 2 Afternoon tea for former elite members. Picture 3 The crude afternoon tea is quite different in comparison.

Picture four five six, I recommend Marriott [Spring] Spa

Picture 789, the yard has always been so beautiful.

msg:After looking at the hotel for a long time, I chose the Marriott Hotel, which is located in the C of Yalong Bay. The hotel has a quiet environment, good facilities, a clean beach, swings on the beach, hammocks, and excellent service. The barbecue ordered by the hotel tastes good. Too tired to play and don‚Äôt want to go out to eat. I ordered the restaurant to eat in the room. It‚Äôs very convenient. The toiletries are surprisingly useful from Herborist. Special thanks to the service commissioner Crystal, who helped us arrange everything before arriving at the store. I learned that it‚Äôs the morning flight. We can check in at 10 o‚Äôclock. Because we are members of Marriott and Ctrip, we have upgraded our sea-view room, late check-out, and delivered afternoon tea. We also want to thank Sue and the young lady moma who checked in at the front desk for explaining the facilities to us. The use and location, in short, will stay at Marriott next time

msg:I brought my parents to Sanya for the first time. I chose a hotel for a long time, hoping to make my parents feel more comfortable. Before check-in, Miss Jessie contacted me in advance, and I also informed of the needs. I hope that the floor that can live on is higher and the scenery is better, because parents like to watch the sea~ After arriving at the store, the room arranged by the room has a very good view. Very satisfied, Jessie will follow up the demand in time. The dinner in the Chinese restaurant is also very good~ Mom and dad said they would choose this one in the future~

The hotels in Yalong Bay are relatively old and have been in business for a long time, but Marriott may have been renovated in recent years and the hardware is pretty good. It's a pity that the TV is not smart and cannot be cast. Others are very satisfied and would recommend to friends. The effect of this trip is also very good!
Finally, I would like to thank Crystal, the housekeeper of the hotel. There were some small episodes when I checked in, but she was very timely to help solve the problem and the service was very good.

It is completely different from the experience of not being able to go to the sea in Haitang Bay. The outdoor projects are very good.

In one building, the children‚Äôs pool is also there. It would be perfect if it could be improved.

It is highly recommended for those who like sun, sand, and leisure to experience it. It will definitely give you a perfect vacation.

msg:After copying a lot of the work of the little red book babies, I barely distinguished the bays of Sanya. Faced with thousands of hotel strategies, my eyes were darkened. I was so entangled that it was confirmed that it was Yalong Bay Marriott the day before the trip.

After I went, I still felt that I didn‚Äôt choose the wrong picture. The pictures are all the scenery inside the hotel. I never thought that the tourist hotspot city could be so deserted, which brought us an unprecedented sense of comfort.

The room is a twin room with a full sea view. The view is good because there are not many people and there is no problem of poor sound insulation. I have to call the housekeeper for something. This time, the receptionist is the little sister of Crystal, who is almost responsive. Everything is for our sake.

As an island fanatic, I have great expectations for the sea in Sanya. I found that there is no one at all. The whole sea is yours. The feel of the private dining room is the coolest, isn‚Äôt it?

The most surprising thing is that CDF Hainan Duty Free Shop has a lot of discounts online! ! ! Download APP LAMER/SKII/Lancome is almost 30% off. Members can also directly mail to home for free. This service shouldn‚Äôt be too good! Lie down on the hotel‚Äôs beach chair, place an order, stalking wool, and savor your products! This trip to Sanya is really wonderful

msg:As a loyal fan of Marriott, Sanya Yalong Bay Marriott is really disappointing! 1. I booked a deluxe garden view room. Every day I see vehicles coming in and out, it&#39;s the parking lot! There is also the noise of pedestrians pulling trolley boxes, and occasionally looking at people downstairs, either you are embarrassed or I am embarrassed. This kind of architectural design leads to a very good view on the side facing the sea, and the landscape on the back is really powerless to complain. What a broken design! If you live in this hotel, it is best to spend more money and choose the beach facing the sea, otherwise there will be no scenery and cleanliness at all. And the floor must be high. I live on the 6th floor, and I still feel so bad. I can imagine the sensory experience of floors below 6. 2. Heated swimming pool. Don&#39;t think about swimming in the heated pool at this hotel. The two heated swimming pools are big enough to soak your feet, so you really want to swim. If you want a refreshing swim, don&#39;t expect this. Other normal temperature swimming pools are a bit cold in this weather, and it is also very troublesome during the epidemic. Other than that, there&#39;s not much to play. Beach travel photography, any hotel will do, the beach is not exclusive, not a feature. 3. For dinner, the Chinese restaurant package is ok, but it has a smell and needs to be ventilated. How good is it to eat outside like breakfast? You&#39;ve already gone to the beach, and you&#39;re still bored at home. Chinese restaurants don&#39;t support eating outside. Bad review. Compared to the Marriott restaurant in Bali, it is a thousand miles away. The price should be about the same. In addition, Uncle Da&#39;s BBQ at the back of the hotel is really pitiful, and it is strongly recommended to order outside. I&#39;m afraid that Uncle Da&#39;s BBQ thinks that you are all big **** and willing to eat here. I spent more than 200 casually (I think it&#39;s too boring, and it&#39;s not too much anyway), and I feel lonely after eating. Small portions, average service, and no set menu. Personally, I think Uncle Da&#39;s BBQ should think that the food in the past was all big **** with a lot of money, and it was quite unpalatable (baked chicken wings are woody and tasteless, so I will cook it for you), there is no taste at all, and the portion is small. . Our two little bellies are not full, what a fool. Of course, you can work harder with more money. The next day, I ordered Wenchang chicken and bullfrog takeaway from Outlet, as well as various dishes, which were more than 10 times better. Pros: Great breakfast until 11am. This is a place that reflects the five-star standard. Juice, milk, fruit, noodles are all very good. It&#39;s just that the omelette chef is not very professional, and the egg juice flows out. The point is, you don&#39;t know whether his eggs are raw or not, and the seasonings in them are not cooked. The doorman is good, pick you up and take you to the car, and will take your luggage for you. won&#39;t make you work hard. The travel photography is good, although it costs a little money, but it is really happy. The back was changed to a hotel that was only one-third of the price of Marriott, and the view was much better. A lot of comfort. In general, we didn&#39;t miss eating, living, and playing, and there was nothing to play or explore in the hotel, which was boring. TV quality is ok. Shouldn&#39;t come again next time. I hope Marriott maintains the standard, otherwise it will be very difficult to visit again. We went to Bali Marriott before, and we were a little reluctant when we left. The food was good, the stay was very comfortable, and the swimming pool was great. You can&#39;t do anything here. It&#39;s also called Marriott. It&#39;s really hard to describe~

msg:Since the Spring Festival, the whole family has come from afar to stay twice. Love is not without reason, I owe the hotel a serious review.
The goodwill and cordiality towards Marriott is derived from the experience of many years at home and abroad, and the Marriott in Yalong Bay attracts us to come again and again because of its strong human touch and high comfort. In terms of hotel architecture and facilities, Yalong Bay Marriott is not very luxurious among five-star hotels, but the overall experience far exceeds our expectations.

First of all, the hotel is located in the center of Yalong Bay, with a wide view, and the blue sea and blue sky are within easy reach. The layout of the building is that the two wings face the sea at 140 degrees, and the rooms facing the sea can basically see the sea. The main hotel building is relatively close to the beach, and the walking distance is within a comfortable range, which is very important in summer. In addition to the sea view, the garden view is even more beautiful. The inner garden is particularly visually rich, with hills scattered high and low and carefully constructed trees and flowers, and occasionally a few simple statues of the Li nationality conceal the theme of Hainan‚Äôs culture in the tropical atmosphere. The garden outside the hotel is huge, except for a few functional buildings, there are large lawns, hillsides, and towering coconut trees. Echoing the mountains in the distance, you will not be lonely if you live in the guest room outside.

In terms of architecture, the lobby is very open, and you can see a complete sea view as soon as you step into the lobby. Pick up a sofa and sit down, have a drink, watch the clouds, listen to the ebb and flow. Under the noon sun, you can see from a distance and feel the sea breeze. At night, there are Filipino singers singing softly, immersing in the land of gentleness. Children also have a small corner where they can play games, watch animations, and enjoy their own time for a while. The hotel rooms were renovated and completely renovated during the 2020 epidemic, and they have been fully completed by the time of the Spring Festival. The newly renovated rooms are very user-friendly. We stayed in three generations, and the front desk arranged two connecting rooms. One of them is equipped with toilet facilities that are convenient for the elderly. Although it is not available, it still feels very intimate. The guest rooms adhere to the design principles of beauty, comfort and practicality. There are no big surprises, but they meet the needs.

Hotel dining is very convenient. There is no need to move downstairs by the elevator in the guest rooms. Chinese food, Japanese food, and all-day dining restaurants are lined up. Due to the high occupancy rate, the breakfast is always very lively. Fortunately, the restaurant is relatively large and there is no need to wait for the basic seats. The food variety of the morning buffet also covers Chinese, Western and Japanese styles, taking into account local characteristics. Since our usual breakfast habit is that the variety is small and fixed, such a large selection is already very sufficient for us. Children especially like pancake. Only this stall will have two or three people line up in the morning. The atmosphere of the Chinese restaurant is completely different. The design should be regarded as a new Chinese style, with a bit of classical cultural elements, but warm and not solemn. The Chinese restaurant specializes in Cantonese and Hainanese local cuisine. During the Spring Festival, we booked a table for the New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner in advance. The restaurant staff sent us a photo of the seat very thoughtfully to confirm, so that the whole family could enjoy a wonderful reunion dinner with peace of mind. Going there in the summer, the choice of set meals is more abundant, and the price is more affordable. Compared with external restaurants, the level of catering service here is more competitive. There is also a barbecue bar by the sea, mainly seafood. When there are many people, the restaurant will place a few tables on the lawn next to it. Drinking with the lights swaying in the evening is also a pleasure.

In terms of entertainment, the swimming pool is very distinctive, with large and small heights and lows full of cheerful visual experience. Some relatively independent areas allow a family to have a relatively free space from outsiders, and they can freely come and go to experience the fun of different swimming pools. Because most of them are shaded by trees, there is no fear of the scorching sun at noon in July. During the Spring Festival, the water temperature is very low. The heated swimming pools here are much larger than other hotels, giving children a place where they can still play in the water. The hotel‚Äôs spa is hidden under the hillside opposite the Chinese restaurant, surrounded by flowers. The price is fair, the technicians are very good, and the girl at the front desk is also polite and relaxing.

Finally, I will talk about the service. Maybe because we spend more time in the hotel, the familiar waiters will talk to us kindly. The waiters in the Chinese restaurant even remember where we sat for the New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner, which is really amazing. During my stay in July, there was a customer service lady Vicky who called in advance to ask about our preferences, added WeChat to ask about our needs every day, helped us to reserve seats in our restaurant, and made reservations for various services, which was very considerate. When we checked in, we found that we had chosen the wrong room type due to our own negligence. Through various adjustments, the front desk manager finally figured out a way to help us arrange a satisfactory room. Thank you very much. I was in a hurry on the day of check-out, and left a beloved bracelet in the room before I left. After talking to Vicky, I delivered it to my home for free in less than three days, and I really felt warm.

Overall, Yalong Bay Marriott is not luxurious in terms of hardware, but judging from service and overall comfort, this is one of my favorite resort hotels. Finally, I would like to mention the general manager of the hotel. He is often seen patrolling around in the hotel. On the first day of the ***** New Year, he led the entire management team to pray for everyone in a very traditional ceremony in the lobby, and to send benefits to the hotel guests. It makes an international hotel full of Chinese-style humanistic care. I think this is the fundamental reason why I love this hotel.

msg:Very nice family resort hotel with beautiful beaches. During the peak summer vacation, there is basically no need to queue for breakfast. Before the trip, the hotel guest service specialist Vicky contacted in advance to confirm the arrival information and time. From check-in to departure from Sanya, she gave reasonable suggestions and best recommendations in all aspects of travel, accommodation, and catering. Jane, the check-in manager, was also very nice and quickly helped us to check in. The panoramic sea view room is really beautiful, and you can see the beautiful sea from the balcony. It would be even better if there was an indoor swimming pool. You can swim indoors in the rain or the hottest time.

Checkin's Martin service was also good in the evening ~ There is a parking lot, there is a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, there are organized parent-child activities, and breakfast I think is not bad~

msg:After his son went to the Marriott Hotel in Yalong Bay after the high school entrance examination, he chose Marriott for this college graduation trip. It is newly renovated and the facilities are refurbished and better. There is also an improvement for breakfast, which can be eaten until eleven o'clock, which is too practical for people who like to sleep late, and all the service staff have a good attitude. The only thing I don‚Äôt feel is that it‚Äôs not as good as before. It used to be that you can see the sea directly when you lie in the infinity pool. Now there are a lot of beach chairs and parasols in front, which block the view, which is a pity. The room we stayed in had a nice balcony, with facilities for drying clothes, and the air-conditioning effect in the room was excellent. The waiter saw that we didn't have enough drinking water, so they gave us more every day, and sent someone to deliver the eco-friendly bags if needed. There are also service specialists and WeChat to contact in advance to introduce matters related to accommodation. I hope Marriott will maintain this enduring state.

Haha üòÉVicky, the service specialist, added WeChat one day in advance, and also helped us make an appoin**ent for a trip. Various precautions are very considerate ‚ù§Ô∏è. The breakfast is good, with many varieties and good taste. Especially the salted chicken in the Chinese restaurant, it is highly recommended, it is so delicious, the child is a basic CD. Anyway, I had a great time at Marriott. The only catch is that there is too little drinking water in the room. There are only 3 small bottles of more than 300 ml. The rest are charged. It is not enough to drink in this hot summer.

msg:Location: Located in the Yalong Bay Hotel Group, it takes about 40 minutes to charter a car from the airport, which is closer than Haitang Bay! Hotel environment: The hotel has a lot of green plants, lush, public areas are good, the lobby is spacious and bright, from the lobby to our room is also very close, the room to the swimming pool, dining restaurant, beach are much closer than the previous two! Room: Since we are living with relatives with children, we booked a suite. This room type is still good. The middle door is closed and two separate rooms are not disturbed. They are open and interoperable. There are plenty of mineral springs every day. Water is provided, as well as children‚Äôs wash kits, which are very exquisite! The only thing is that there are 4 adults and 2 children. In this room type, only one balcony and one drying rack is not enough. I have already made suggestions to the housekeeper! Breakfast: It's pretty plentiful. Anyway, I think it's enough. Starting around 9 o'clock, there will be a lot of people and there will be a queue, so I suggest you go early or later! Swimming pool: At first I felt that there were few swimming pools, but later discovered that his swimming pools were divided piece by piece but connected into one piece. So in fact, there are quite a lot of them. Some of them are relatively shallow, which is suitable for younger children! There is also the kind of pool for children playing in the water behind the hotel. It is relatively small and may be too hot. It seems that there are not many children playing! Children‚Äôs activities: The daily activities are arranged very tightly, but there is only one table, that is, less than 10 children. I think it is small for the number of residents. Our children are already full when they go, and a small stool is added. On the side, the child is not very good at doing it, so he doesn't want to play, so he goes to play in the sand next to it! Children‚Äôs favorites are Bubble Show and Crab Catching, and they refuse to come out after playing. They say they will live here to play Bubble and Cat Crab next time! Finally, the butler: Vicky, the butler, added me when he was not in Sanya. He was very enthusiastic and thoughtful. He would take the initiative to send out an activity sheet every day, pay attention to our itinerary on the day, ask her any questions, and give us answers in time. The sense of service and attitude are top-notch. ! And the cleaning staff in the hotel smiled when they met us in the corridor and took the initiative to say hello, so this time staying at Marriott, I feel very good, and I want to continue to live here next year!

msg:After booking the flight tickets, browse the webpages of major hotels every day to see introductions and reviews to compare the price-performance ratio. I placed an order at Yalong Bay Marriott Resort Hotel two days before departure. Before I checked in, Vicky, the guest service specialist of the hotel, contacted me on the phone and asked me what time I would like to arrive at the store and added WeChat. After check-in, I will send the children's activity table to my hotel and ask if I need to book a table (the room I booked includes one dinner per day). On the days when I stayed in the hotel, Vicky sent me the daily children's activity sheet and asked if he had any needs as soon as he went to work. I call Vicky the butler who never meets. A good staff can give guests a great sense of experience.
Overall, Yalong Bay Marriott Hotel has done a good job of hardware and software. The children said that the weather in Sanya is not good and too hot, but the hotel is very good and it is very fun to have fun.

msg:Due to the unreliable operation of a previous third-party platform, my entire itinerary was missing 2 nights of hotels. After several comparisons, I booked Marriott on Ctrip. It turns out that this choice is too correct. There are many five-star hotels in Yalong Bay, but In terms of hotel facilities, service standards, parent-child, catering, and cost-effective comparisons, Marriott is a win. From the beginning of the check-in, ANNA at the front desk gave me various coordinations, which gave me a sense of experience as a gold card member. After that, Vicky, the service specialist, helped the whole process, children's activities, various meals, and travel shooting. She helped to make appoin**ents, and I didn‚Äôt need to do it myself. Worry about, even the daily temperature, pay attention to sun protection, insect prevention, are reminded meticulously. On the day of check-out, when the room was almost full, Vicky, Anna, and Dastiny helped me postpone it until 2 pm after coordination. I was really touched. Marriott‚Äôs travel shots are also very popular. The Sky Mirror is well-deserved and has a great mood. Marriott‚Äôs garden scenery itself is an excellent shooting location. Although the room is small, the layout is reasonable. The breakfast is also very rich in flavor online. In short, Yalong Bay Marriott will choose next time. Thanks again for the help of the above three beauties.

The hotel I stayed at this time was also excellent, and I didn't have to choose the scenery/service/sanitation. The meals are also quite OK, will consider staying again.

The room was small and the view was great. I stayed in Sanya for eight nights and stayed at Sheraton and Wuzhizhou Island. Marriott was the most satisfied. Whether it is from hardware facilities or software services, it is great. The room is cleaned very frequently, twice a day, and the turn-down is also on, and the waiter can be seen cleaning the room at any time in the corridor. The breakfast is not too rich, but everything is exquisite. The desserts are freshly made. My husband still misses the solid lean meat in the preserved egg and lean meat porridge, hahaha. Except for the swimming lap in the swimming pool, I have experienced all the items in the hotel package and I am very satisfied. The hotel is very close to Baihua Valley, about 15 minutes walk. I took the wedding photos in the hotel and there is no additional cost. Just sign the agreement at the front desk and I will check in for the second time.
