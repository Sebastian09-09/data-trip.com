msg:Very convenient with direct access subway from airport. Eateries are limited around the hotel. Walk 200m toward the TV tower & u may find some. I stayed in a midsize suite for a night & on my return 2 nights, they upgraded to the biggest suite.

The mid sized suite face the TV tower which the largest suite they give me face a construction site which run 24hrs. Light sleeper do take note. Mattress is softer & more comfortable in the big suite. Toilet bowl for the midsize suite are in a separated room away from bathroom. Breakfast not worth mentioning but the staff are polite. I would rate this as a good basic business hotel. Not the luxurious type u are looking for. Very good price tho.. 

The main downside for me would be the renovation smells that linger strongly in part of corridor & room. There is a pungent plastic burning smell that bothers me. Secondly, the aircon blower was shut in winter period. I susposed to save cost. Only a small air vent above the window. The air is still & stuffy in the room. I had to left the main door ajar to get some breeze in the room. 

Pictures are the 80meter square room. Last 4pics are the midsize suite. Prices in chinese dy website are way cheaper.

msg:Five-star experience: the dual charm of hotel service and professional standards

In busy urban life, occasional leisure time is always cherished. This time, I was fortunate to stay in a five-star hotel, whose service is so good that it can almost be described as "amazing". It not only meets all my expectations for high-quality accommodation, but also shows an indescribable warmth and professionalism in the details.

As soon as I walked into the hotel lobby, I was greeted by a warm atmosphere. The lobby is decorated in an elegant and modern style, making people feel as if they are in an exquisite art space. What impressed me most was the round-faced manager. Her smile was as warm as the spring breeze, and her words and deeds revealed an extraordinary professional level. Whether it was a detailed introduction to the hotel facilities or a warm recommendation of the surrounding attractions, she seemed to be at ease, making people feel cordial and trustworthy.

Under the guidance of the manager, I came to my room. The room is spacious and bright, and the layout is both comfortable and luxurious. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the magnificent views of the Color TV Tower and Qingnian Lake are in full view. During the day, the sun shines on the lake, sparkling like a moving picture; and at night, when the lights come on, the lights of the color TV tower shine in the night sky, adding a mysterious charm. Whether it is day or night, the scenery here makes people linger.

In addition to the beautiful scenery in the room, the hotel's service is impeccable. Whether it is room cleaning or catering services, they all show the high standards of five-star hotels. Here, I seem to enjoy an unprecedented noble experience, which makes people happy.

During my stay, I also went to the Youth Park. The park is shaded by green trees and filled with fragrance. It is a good place to relax. At night, the lights in the park are dazzling, and they complement the surrounding buildings, forming a beautiful night scene. Strolling here, you can not only enjoy the beautiful scenery, but also feel the prosperity and vitality of the city.

This experience of staying in a five-star hotel made me deeply appreciate the charm of professional standards and high-quality services. It not only allowed me to get enough rest and relaxation during my trip, but also gave me a deeper understanding and understanding of the hotel industry. I believe that in the days to come, such a wonderful experience will become an indelible bright spot in my memory.

msg:When visiting Shenyang, the most correct choice is to stay in this hotel [strong][strong]
Transportation: Very convenient. You can reach the airport and train station directly when you go out. You save a lot of money, mainly because there are no traffic jams. It's very friendly to us who don't have much luggage.
Room: We booked a deluxe double room, but we arrived too early and there was no clean room. Because we didn’t want to wait, the lady at the front desk recommended a view room to us and asked us to check if we were satisfied with the room before making a decision. When I got to the room, I saw the scenery just like the picture. I decisively added 150 yuan to upgrade. I felt it was a great value. The room size was doubled and the layout was also very good.
Service: Very considerate. He will consider the issue from the customer's point of view. He recommended an upgrade after seeing that we didn't want to wait. He even asked us to go and see if we were satisfied first.
Breakfast: The restaurant is not very big, and all the food is concentrated in one area, which makes it easier for us to get food. To be honest, I don’t like that some hotel cafeterias are very large and the food is scattered. In fact, it’s just those things, but it’s very difficult to hold them. I would like to commend the service staff in the breakfast room. Now there are not many five-star hotels that can help you enter the restaurant, find a seat for you, and get coffee for you. It’s not that this service is not provided, it seems that there is a shortage of people [呲呲]
Food: Unfortunately, time was limited and I didn’t dine at the hotel. Plana seemed quite atmospheric, but we went to the Old Four Seasons and Color TV Tower night markets next to the hotel. The Old Four Seasons may not be to my liking, but there are still many specialties in the night market.
But the coffee in the lobby bar is pretty good [strong][strong]

msg:It was my first time coming to Shenyang from the Northeast. I checked many places on Ctrip and finally chose this place. I heard my best friend in Shenyang said that the location of his house is good and it is close to everywhere. Indeed, there is the subway downstairs. I took the subway to the Forbidden City Shuaifu in Zhongjie, which was really close. In the evening, I went to the Caita Night Market next to the hotel. It seems to be an internet celebrity night market in Shenyang. The Caita Night Market where my best friend took me to eat has a good chicken rack and fried stew. After eating, I walked back to the hotel in a few minutes. We arrived at the hotel relatively early, around 11 o'clock, and the room had not been cleaned yet. The lady at the front desk was very enthusiastic and helped with coordination. It didn't take long to arrange a clean room for us. When I saw the Color TV Tower, I should say that the night view of Shenyang is really good! The morning breakfast seemed to be around ten o'clock, and my best friend and I caught up with the last one. It was quite rich, and the handmade wontons are recommended. It was a bit hot in the back room, but my friend didn't like the cool breeze from the air conditioner. After telling the front desk, a room lady was arranged to help us open the fan window. The fresh air was more comfortable than the cool breeze from the air conditioner. Service It really kept up with us, and we were both very satisfied with our stay. When we went out to play, the guy at the concierge would also tell us the route and which subway number to take. It was comparable to Baidu Maps. Hahaha, not bad. I will stay here again next time I come back! Also, takeaways can be delivered upstairs by robots, which is quite convenient, because many hotels now require you to go downstairs to pick up takeaways yourself.

I was given a room facing the Color TV Tower, and the surroundings were very close to the Color TV Tower Night Market. There are some restaurants in the surrounding area. It's on Qingnian Street and close to the subway station. The overall hotel, especially the layout of the new rooms, looks very simple. I like it very much. I slept well at night. I booked this time. Breakfast is not included, and we didn’t go to the swimming pool. There is a beer bar on the first floor of the hotel, where you can drink some beer and eat some German sausages. The decoration is quite unique. It is very German or Swiss overall. The style and culture also retain some Swiss styles. These elements are quite interesting. @Swisshotel Shenyang

The most speechless thing is that this hotel seems to have micro-business activities every day? ? ? It feels that the people coming in and out are very messy... The room is also very strange, all the facilities are low, the bathtub, table, washbasin are not friendly to those over 170, do I have to kneel to use them?

msg:I went to Shenyang to apply for a visa, so I wanted to find a hotel close to the consulate. I also wanted to take the opportunity to apply for a visa and have some fun in Shenyang. In this way, I had to carefully consider the location of the hotel. After searching and comparing, I chose Swissotel Shenyang is right next to Youth Park. It's right in the city center and its location is absolutely amazing. Everything I want to go is within walking distance, which means it's quite comfortable.

Compared with other hotels, the Swissotel Shenyang where I stayed was the most cost-effective. I walked there to apply for a visa, which took about 15 minutes. It was very windy in Shenyang, so I couldn’t walk very fast; the door was Metro No. 2. Line, can directly connect to the airport and train station; within ten minutes' walk you can reach Vientiane City and Color TV Tower Night Market. In the evening, I went to the famous Old Four Seasons Noodle House, which is less than 10 minutes' walk away. By the way, I praised the delicious chicken rack; I don't want to go far. If you go, the surrounding food, drink, entertainment and shopping are completely sufficient.

It is said that the hotel was renovated last year, and the hardware facilities are quite good. It is a simple and light luxury style that is popular nowadays. The TV can project the screen. The bathroom is very big and has dry and wet separation. It is very comfortable to use. Since I came early, I made a reservation when I arrived. There was no clean room in the room, but the front desk was very helpful and helped us upgrade to a large lake view room, which overlooks the entire Shenyang City and Qingnian Lake. The scenery is really beautiful.

Also, the day before check-in, the hotel's front desk called me to confirm my itinerary. When they learned that I was going to the consulate and surrounding areas, they specially placed a tourist map of Shenyang in the room. No matter where I went, I could feel the enthusiasm of the hotel staff. I was very moved by this aspect. Thank you, my lovely friends. Because I didn’t know how to use the screen projection function of the remote control in the room, I called the front desk and asked the front desk. In less than 5 minutes, a waiter came to debug it. The service efficiency was very high and super. Thumbs up. The breakfast is excellent, with a wide variety of varieties, a combination of Chinese and Western styles, and the environment is also very good, impeccable.

Highly recommend Swissotel Shenyang, the king of overall cost performance, yay!

The staff in the lobby are very enthusiastic, proactively informing me of the subway location, and helping to review food and beverage takeaways. The cleaning lady in the corridor will also take the initiative to say hello. The breakfast we had for two days was also very rich. There were Western salads, desserts and fruits that I liked, as well as Chinese food that the elderly liked. When you enter the restaurant, a waiter will greet you with a smile and take the initiative to take your seat and help you make coffee and tea. In short, I visited Conrad, Grand Hyatt, Westin and Shangri-La before arriving in Shenyang. Reading the reviews, there are pros and cons. This hotel has good value for money and service level👍. I hope it will continue and I wish you a prosperous business! Will visit again next time.

It is very spacious for three people to sleep with children. The hair dryer in the bathroom is indeed a bit small, and the wind is also weak, so it takes a long time to blow. The breakfast at the hotel is rich and delicious. The swimming pool is a bit small and the water temperature is a bit cold during this season. The soundproofing of the hotel is quite good. You can't hear the sound from the next room or corridor. It's quite quiet at night. But there is a new building opposite the hotel, and the construction starts at 6 or 7 in the morning, so there is noise, which is not very good. I recommend this place when traveling to Shenyang, the price/performance ratio is very high.

When I checked in, I was told not to stay in a room that is very close to the road. They said they would arrange a high floor, but they arranged the 17th floor. Is that high? There was a very unpleasant smell of wooden floor when I entered the room. The service staff said that it would be fine if I opened the window for a while. However, the noise of cars coming and going outside was very loud. The service staff said that it would be fine if I closed the window at night, but it was still the same at night. I didn't rest well at all in 2 nights.
And the breakfast was really not good at all.
I will not consider staying here again.

As a native of Shenyang, she gave us a lot of tips for reference for subsequent shopping and travel, saving us the trouble of using our brains😁🤗 , thank you again for this kid.
The hotel's buffet options are relatively lackluster, especially for pasta. I don't know if it's due to regional differences or something else. The noodles or wontons are cooked directly and placed there. It may be a bit challenging for those who like to cook and eat freshly and have taste requirements. .
Overall, staying in the hotel is very comfortable and cost-effective. It can be salty or sweet, and is a good choice for business and travel.

msg:The Swissotel is about 500 meters away from my grandpa’s old house, which has now been demolished. This time I came back and did not stay at home. I took my mother out to stay in a hotel. Firstly, I didn’t want to have to work hard for my mother to cook during the New Year. Secondly, I really wanted to relive the food and youth park on the lively road. The breakfast at the hotel was great and the water temperature for swimming was great. The staff knew that my mother was from Shenyang and would be staying at the hotel for the Chinese New Year, so they specially upgraded her room to a high floor with a first-class view. We also borrowed it. During the festival, the guest occupancy rate is very high, including many elderly people and children. However, the restaurant is in good order and the dishes are replenished in a timely manner. The hotel's bakery should be very good, which can be seen from the quality of the breakfast desserts. I converted every piece of dessert I ate into euros, so it was really worth it. The old lady was very happy after hearing this and said that we would stay here next time we come back.

The new decoration and new style are indeed much younger and more fashionable, but I would like to emphasize the hairdo manager at the front desk. Her service is really great and she not only helped me. They arranged a beautiful and spacious room, and also prepared a birthday cake and longevity noodles for me. They are considerate and warm, and I feel comfortable. I will stay here again next time I come to Shenyang!

There is also a Paulaner restaurant and bar on the first floor of the hotel, which has my favorite Weiss Beer and Schnitzel. The room was a bit stuffy. The air conditioner seemed unable to be adjusted to a temperature that suited me, and the windows couldn't be opened. Although it was November and the weather outside was only a few degrees, the constant 27 degrees in the room was really unbearable. The room I stayed in this time also faced the construction site of the new building behind me. At night, I didn't know whether it was the wind or workers working overtime. There was a constant sound of hammering, but it was not too disturbing to sleep. Depending on the area I go to on my next business trip, there is still a chance to stay here again.

We went to both the night market and the morning market next to it. It is a paradise for foodies. The duty manager's service was also very good, and he also gave the children homemade biscuits that the children couldn't forget. The room window can see the beautiful scenery of Qingnian Lake and the TV Tower in the night. Highly recommended!

msg:I took my children to Shenyang during a staggered trip. I chose Swissotel after comprehensively comparing location, price and reviews. However, this was the most correct and unforgettable experience for me during the entire trip. The hotel has been renovated. The room is not very large, but the facilities are new and fully functional. The large bathtub is a source of happiness for my son. As expected of these five star hotels, the service was unforgettable. Maybe it was because I didn’t eat well at Caita Night Market, an Internet celebrity night market next to the hotel. My son had a severe stomachache at night. I couldn’t help him stay alone in the room to buy medicine. I contacted the manager who greeted me when I checked in, and he was very disappointed. Unfortunately, she was off work, but she immediately contacted her colleagues in the hotel and came to my room in less than 5 minutes. According to my request, she went to an outside pharmacy to buy medicine, which alleviated my son's pain. But the service didn't stop there. I went to have breakfast the next morning and after reporting my room number, the restaurant manager immediately came to me, asked about my child's physical condition, and thoughtfully prepared millet porridge for us. The small details of these services are really unforgettable for me. I don’t like to write reviews, but I really hope everyone can feel the service of Swissotel Shenyang.

I have to specially mention Aunt Jiang Shouying from the room depar**ent on the 18th floor. She is super enthusiastic｜ She took the initiative to ask if we still need to bring water to go out. She has a very good attitude~ The only disadvantage is that the drinks in the refrigerator are charged, but there is no explanation. Because I am used to staying in a high-star hotel, I drink everything in the refrigerator when I open it. When I checked out, I was told that the Sprite in the living room was 18¥.

First of all, the location is very good. This is the first time I came to Shenyang to play. Compared with Zhongjie, I finally chose this place. It is also convenient to have the subway, and the taxi is also ok. The main reason is that it is so close to the Color TV Tower Night Market, which is convenient for shopping and eating
In terms of sanitation, we didn't encounter any problems. All the reasonable ones are reasonable. The room is a suite, which is spacious enough, and the infrastructure is gradually being upgraded. Look forward to it.
The service is very good, from the reception of people to the big and small things. It is important to mention that Annie Xiaoan was very considerate when she checked in. She spoke generously and decently, and her professionalism and professionalism are excellent. The most important thing is that I hope to choose a room with a lake view and a color TV when I check in. The room in the tower, but there is no way to realize it because there is no vacancy, but it was quite late when we returned to the hotel after shopping the next day. After a day later, Xiaoan still remembered our request on the first day, and took the initiative when conditions allowed. He offered to help us change a room that meets our requirements. He is very considerate. Please give us a good review. If you have the opportunity to come to Shenyang in the future, you will choose this place again.

We are taking a 100 year old family on holiday for a weekend. The staff were very accommodating in handling issues and responding to our needs. The only thing that needs to be improved is the wifi in the room. Sometimes the signal in the room is poor. Others are very satisfied. Thanks again

The beauties at the front desk were very enthusiastic when I checked in, especially Annie. She was professional and considerate and answered a lot of questions for me. The hotel's service is indeed five-star standard. I hope to have a better experience next time.

Visiting the famous night market in Shenyang, etc., the service is really good. They even contacted me in advance to help me arrange a room, and even upgraded me. I heard that I took care of the elderly, and offered to arrange my room on the same floor, so that I can take care of my family. , The services of all depar**ents of the hotel are very good. I really feel at ease staying in this five-star hotel when traveling with my family. I will stay here again next time I pass by. By the way, the slightly fatter gentleman at the gate directing the parking is also very nice. He helped us get the car out of the car and pushed the box to the hotel lobby. The service of Xiaolin in the concierge depar**ent is also very good, warm and thoughtful service, The room card was sent again and again during the send-off, and I would like to express my gratitude to them again! The service in the breakfast room is also very good, there are chairs, the waiters are quick to collect the dishes, and the chef is also quick to add food. Unlike some hotels, the regular dishes and food are empty, and they haven't been filled for half a day. During breakfast Western food is available, and it would be better if there were more varieties. There is a small suggestion, the bottle of fresh air water or something in the hotel corridor and room, it really smells bad, the three rooms, my family members think the smell is bad, I feel dizzy, I will The door of this bottle of water must be closed in the bathroom. When checking out, it was taken out and returned to its place. This is just the opinion of a few people in my family.

msg:The hotel is highly recommended, and the price is very affordable among international five-star hotel chains. I usually stay in Marriott and Crowne Plaza hotels, and I live in Accor hotels less, but this time the Accor Swiss Hotel gave me the experience Exceeded expectations.

One is service, the most considerate and useful service, from Wu Tingting, the manager on duty that day. Before I arrived at the store, I made a phone call to inquire about various needs enthusiastically and carefully, and arranged for me the room that suits my needs the most. I didn’t forget to send welcome fruit. It can be said that the details are very attentive, and I really want to provide good service for the guests. Excellent service, we can feel her responsibility to customers and seriousness to work.

In addition, I would like to mention the sister Jiang Shouying who cleans the room on the 22nd floor. She is very warm and friendly, serious and responsible. She is very friendly to the guests and leaves a good impression. I would like to live on the 22nd floor next time. The room is also very clean.
Furthermore, when Icon Weng in the breakfast room withdrew the dishes, he took the initiative to ask whether he would like coffee or tea. Breakfast is also good.

The second is the scenery and rooms. Most of the five-star hotels in Shenyang have stayed in these years. I think the Swiss Hotel is the best viewing hotel in Shenyang to see the TV Tower and Youth Park.
Compared with the two higher-end brands next door, I personally feel that the Swiss Hotel has a better view. The room is also very classic and distinctive, and the robot delivery food is very good. The lobby is also quite a**ospheric and beautiful.

The third is the location. The subway is at the door of the downstairs, and the bustling Caitv Tower Night Market is just three to five minutes’ walk away. The Youth Park is just downstairs. It can be said to be an invincible location.

A lot of good things have been said above, let’s talk about the shortcomings:
(Important point) The toilet in the room I live in does not have a slow down, and my ears startled when I put it down, I hope to improve it, or consider posting a reminder label on the wall next to it? Tell the customer to be careful and slow down, otherwise who would have thought of a snap... If it is a heart disease, it can't stand it

When she arrived at the hotel, she was already waiting to help us check in, and tried my best to satisfy the few of us. Ask to be arranged on the same floor, carefully remind the check-in procedure, the room facilities are better than expected, clean and refreshing, the bedding is high-end and comfortable, the large floor-to-ceiling windows provide a very wide view, the Xiaomanyao TV tower is in front of you, and the colors change constantly at night. It's really beautiful, the breakfast variety is very rich, and the service is also very good. This is a hotel that matches 5 stars, and it's the same level of hotel. This Swiss hotel has obvious advantages, high cost performance, and the experience of staying is very nice, the best I am satisfied with Tingting, the manager of the lobby. She provides proactive service, is pragmatic and responsible, and treats guests with great care. With such staff, the hotel will have a better future. If I have the opportunity to come to Shenyang again, I will definitely choose Swissotel Shenyang.

I booked a room with twin beds. I can see the scenery of Qingnian Street and the color TV tower. The location Super good, I have been to many cities and stayed in many hotels in the past few years, this place is definitely worth recommending. After breakfast in the morning, go back to the room and make a cup of morning tea. Although life is not very gentle, there is always a goodness that will heal us. For example, find a quiet place in the afternoon to relax. The time at this moment is simple, casual, without the trouble of hustle and bustle, only the spring breeze is comfortable, and it belongs to oneself. Although it is still cold outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of the hotel, the interior is indeed warm and comfortable...

msg:I rarely write reviews, but I really want to say something about this one. Good things: the location is very good, it is located on Qingnian Street, downstairs is Qingnian Park Subway Station, diagonally opposite to the TV Tower, it is very convenient to go to Mixc City and Caita Night Market. The service at the front desk was very good. They were warm and patient when checking in, and gave small gifts to the children. But, the good things end there. The following are the worst experiences in my opinion: First, in a five-star hotel, the comfort of the bedding should meet the minimum standard. The mattress in this hotel is so hard that the whole body hurts, and there is no stability at all. , Lying on it is shaking, I am very curious about how bad the mattress is. When I opened it, it turned out to be a very simple spring mattress without any brand logo, far inferior to Atour and Meihao. Wait for a four-star hotel. The most important thing for a qualified five-star hotel is to allow guests with various habits to obtain comfortable bedding. This hotel has not done it, at least for me. The second is that the windows of this hotel cannot be opened, and the ventilation depends on the baffles of manual switches. The baffles of this hotel are not well sealed and cannot be closed at all. In short, this hotel made me sleepless all night, and I didn't leave a good experience.

Before I arrived at the hotel, I felt the service of the hotel. Shirley called me in advance to communicate with me about the check-in time and the number of people. Because I was driving on the expressway all the time, I added WeChat after talking about some situations. When I was free to check WeChat, I found out that her service is really thoughtful, because she heard that we had children and was afraid that the room we stayed in was not suitable, so she took the initiative to upgrade us to a suite. And it's very well organized. The hotel room is also comfortable to stay in, and the view is super good. After this service, this is the first choice hotel in Shenyang

After a comprehensive comparison, I chose Swissotel Shenyang because it is newly renovated, located in the center of the city, and has a great location, and the online review service is very considerate. But what really touched me was the personalized service and care of this hotel, which made me, a person who doesn't like to write reviews, write about my feelings. When I arrived at the hotel, it was already time for thousands of lights. Although it was cold outside, it was as warm as spring when I entered the hotel lobby. The young man at the concierge said "Happy Chinese New Year", which made me feel very cordial, and the fragrance in the lobby was fresh It is elegant and elegant, and the check-in process at the front desk is also very smooth, and I gave my daughter a gift box of Swiss-style cookies, and came to the room with the first gift of the new year. When I opened the room, I saw a brand-new light and luxurious decoration , With the opening of the electric gauze curtain, I saw the brightly lit Qingnian Street and the continuous flow of traffic. This scenery really made me feel the warmth and beauty of my big Shenyang as a person who has not been home for three years. But what makes me even more delighted is that there is a handwritten welcome letter on the coffee table by the window, simple language, sincere blessings, and a special intention such as a Shenyang tourist map and Bulaolingtang (after asking the front desk I learned that this gift was specially prepared by the Shenyang Bureau of Culture and Tourism for the guests who came to Shenyang, so I would like to give it a big thumbs up here). Although I only stayed in the hotel for one night, I really like this hotel. All the handmade bread and pasta for breakfast, and all kinds of health drinks are delicious and amazing. This trip to Shenyang was short but wonderful, because I chose the right hotel, which made my journey smooth and comfortable. I heard from the hotel's service staff that this year's hotel will continue to upgrade its products. I hope that next year's Spring Festival will bring me a better feeling. I also wish Swissotel Shenyang's business in 2023 to a higher level!

The sofa in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room is my favorite place. I can lie on the sofa leisurely and watch the night view of the color TV tower, feeling comfortable physically and mentally.
There are many business districts around the hotel, shopping is convenient, the hotel parking lot has a good environment, and the two entrances are very convenient. From all aspects, it is a hotel worth experiencing.

msg:The floor I live on should be newly renovated. It smells full of formaldehyde. There is a construction site outside the window. The shower room is too small. Squeezing out the toiletries is a process that tests one's patience. The drinking cup is also placed directly on the table, which is really unhygienic. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in Shenyang. I couldn't stand the smell of formaldehyde and ran away at dawn.

msg:The experience is extremely poor, and I strongly do not recommend it. The room is compact and the facilities are not complete. There is no refrigerator, scale, and hair dryer, but they are placed on the bedside table. All the items on the display are charged items. Ctrip users charge a deposit, and breakfast for a 9-year-old child is charged extra. The key breakfast is even more miserable with a small variety, and the clear soup of the noodles is watery and is second-guessed by chain hotels. The location is in the middle of a T-shaped intersection, and the entrance is congested and it is inconvenient to travel. It is one of the worst experiences among all the five-star hotels I have been to. Personal experience is for reference only. Please feel free to use it.

msg:I stayed here at the beginning of the month, and stayed for two nights. Later, the front desk sent a message asking me to write a good review, saying that they had a task request. They sent me messages for two consecutive days on 2.6 and 2.7. I was too busy to write at the time, and I just remembered today . I don't want to write good reviews blindly. As a student who likes to travel and has lived in at least dozens of hotels with this price and this star rating and has received professional hotel management learning and practical training, I want to make my own objective evaluation. Of course, my evaluation only expresses my personal feelings and is for reference only. First of all, the check-in was too cumbersome. At that time, I was very tired after getting off the plane and arrived at the hotel at night. There was no one else who checked in except me and my other companion. Doing marketing on my own, asking to add WeChat and the like, compared to the quick check-in at other hotels, to be honest, the experience is not very good. I didn’t expect that it would take so long to check in. I think if the guests have already waited I'm bored, you don't have to worry about scanning the QR code and adding WeChat. There are plenty of opportunities. Fortunately, the concierge service is very good. There are people who help you with the big and small bags. Otherwise, it will take so long to check in after a long journey. Got it. Then there is the sanitation of the hotel. I think it is quite average. The suite we booked, there are still dust in many details, the bathtub is not clean, and the cleaning lady is also outrageous. It doesn’t matter if there is or not the next morning No one came to open the door. Fortunately, I locked the safety lock from the inside, but I was woken up, and then my aunt came over in a while, around twelve o'clock, we ordered takeaway, and urged us, saying that she would return in the afternoon There were other rooms to be done, and if she didn’t clean them, it would affect her going back to work. Then we rushed out of the room after lunch and let the aunt clean it. I have never had such an unpleasant feeling in a hotel of the same level and price before. The so-called lake view room is also very tasteless. I won’t describe it in detail. If you are interested, you can go and have a look. But there is one thing to say, the night view is quite beautiful, and the view is very good. The waiter in the hotel lobby is also the same. My companion and he are looking for something. Ordinary female college students are not competitors. I don’t want to go into details. Besides, it seems that I have a bad review from my peers. In short, the experience is really average. There is neither a feeling of being at home nor any desire to live again. Too many details make people uncomfortable. Oh, by the way, the hotel provides two free bottles of water, but they are placed in the innermost corner that is not easy to see. The water that is placed in a place that can be seen at a glance is 28 a bottle, and the price is actually not bad. , but I don’t think it’s necessary to keep the free water so hidden. It’s not good to let customers choose whether to drink free or pay~ I hope the hotel will pay more attention to service details and customer feelings, and hope to do better~

msg:The smell of the newly renovated floors of the hotel is outrageous. When I first entered, my eyes were irritated and my nose was irritated. I could smell it even with my N95. Later, I changed the room to the undecorated floor on the 29th floor. It was tasteless, but it was really too old. The bed was so hard that he hiccupped. Let’s talk about the service. When ordering takeaway, I called the front desk. The front desk said it was in the concierge depar**ent and asked the concierge depar**ent to deliver it. The concierge depar**ent said that it would not be delivered and I had to pick it up by myself. This is the first time I have lived in so many hotels and asked customers to go downstairs to pick it up. The attitude and speed of the service staff at the front desk is really unflattering. The attitude almost thought I was a waiter, and the speed was so slow that it took five or six minutes to check in for my room. Never again.

2、需要“闖關東”的勇氣入住！因為大堂側門我們沒有給關上，被禮賓員【訓斥一頓】，差點幹起來！各位自行腦補。
3、從安排房間、能否免費升級等方面充斥着【傲慢】的態度，以及前台的小心思。幾經周折才換到同樣窗户的房間（前台説是升級安排的雙床房，在預訂頁面雙床房衹有一種）。
4、沒有詢問是否吸煙，被安排到無煙樓層，到房間了才知道。

設施：這個酒店沒有【一次性紙杯】請大家自行攜帶。房間窗户有的有遮擋，衹露半個，被牆體遮擋。換了好幾個房間後才發現的【貓膩】
衞生：衞生堪憂，個人感覺不符合五星級標準。有圖有真相！

之前在網上就看到評論説酒店前台Yolanda服務特別好，這次很巧的是正好碰上她辦入住了，房間幫我安排的不錯，説話温柔服務熱情，為客人考慮，主動介紹周邊吃喝玩樂，體驗很好。

打掃房間的阿姨也非常體貼關心人，見我喝葯，主動多送了兩瓶礦泉水。這些細節讓人覺得很温暖。

工作人員很熱情，入住當天送了小朋友花燈，還專程補了小童牙刷和拖鞋，比較貼心。房間裏每天都補礦泉水，完全喝不完～
不足之處是，設施略老舊了，淋浴房下水比較慢；自助早餐比較一般。

酒店位置：去哪兒都很方便，親測彩燈塔夜市走路3分鐘，萬象城商區步行12分鐘，故宮、大帥府、中街步行街打車10-15分鐘，918紀念館打車20分鐘，連最遠的遼博和北陵公園打車也是30分鐘以內。
客房環境：定的基本雙床房型，房間設施和環境也超級棒，乾淨整潔！
早飯：不算豐富，但是對比起房價的性價比，我和媽媽都覺得很OK，還有熱攤提供雲吞、餃子、麪條等。
服務：工作人員都很熱情，服務周到，點過外賣以及要求多要飲用水，都及時送到，特別感謝大堂經理Yolanda Wu和團隊工作人員的協助，非常專業又令人舒適。
下次再返回瀋陽的話，果斷再選擇瑞士酒店！

游泳池雖然不大，但很乾凈哈，地理位置優越 過了馬路就是地鐵， 臨環湖的那個公園也很近； 趕上下雨，酒店沒有多餘雨傘借出了，建議給每個房間都配備帶酒店logo的雨傘，夏天來了也能防曬哈， 前台小姐姐都很漂亮服務也好，打掃衞生的阿姨也很好，下次還會再入住！

第二天早上一家三口去早餐廳吃了早餐，有一位戴眼鏡娃娃臉的小姑娘服務很熱情，幫我們接了茶水和咖啡，也及時幫我們收走了空盤子，還給小朋友送了糖果，體驗很不錯！

環境：酒店位置很好，離市區內主要景點都在3公里內，窗外就是地標建築彩燈塔晚上有燈光秀。酒店旁邊是青年公園，可以呼吸新鮮空氣


設施：冬天暖氣很足，熱水也很穩定。就是淋浴房下水有點慢。酒店內健身房器械種類很多，温水泳池我去的時候沒啥人，玩的很開心。
服務：酒店服務很貼心，特別要表揚酒店經理董小姐，我們南方人最怕乾燥，小董就給我們送來了加濕器和水果真的特別開心。下次去瀋陽還要入住瑞士酒店

但退房當天前台打電話説沒有給備註上延遲到兩點退房，希望能改進一下服務吧，也不知道攜程和酒店怎麼協調的單子~明明花了積分兑換的服務，實際入住的時候還是有挺多問題的。
外賣不能送上樓也挺不方便的，希望能改進叭，很多連鎖酒店都可以送到房間了呀，要是以後可以有機器人之類的送外賣到房間門口還會再來這裏住。

但是一樓那個什麼德式餐廳有點坑。廚藝太糟糕，價高質次。直接影響原來對酒店的不錯印象。
