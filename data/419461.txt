Everything is fine except the deco is “0ld School”. 

One comment the hotel should update the room Access Card system.  It too old.  

Room lighting is abit too dim , even with all the lighting on .. it difficult to see things.

Bus 111 stops right across from the hotel and it takes you to Jingshan park to have a bird’s eye view of the Forbidden City. The hotel breakfast was OK for Chinese standards, though it lacked cheese and ham variety. The room was spacious enough and although the bathroom needs some repairs it is well cleaned. Room service was efficient and the food wasn’t bad at all! -although westerners without Chinese language skills might struggle a bit to order food by phone. Staff is attentive, polite and friendly. Overall, we liked this hotel and our Beijing visit.

The only complain I have for this hotel was the room service. It takes 1hour and 17minutes for your order to arrive. The food quality is like it came straight from a microwavable instant food. The potato from the Malaysian curry dish we ordered was like 1 step to becoming a mashed potato. My suggestion is just order outside using you Wechat or Alipay App, it will arrive 30mins.

It is only a few minutes' walk from Jinyu Hutong Station on Metro Line 8. It is very convenient to travel! The hotel atrium is very grand! The service attitude is really great! From check-in to the concierge in the hotel lobby, everyone's face is full of smiles! I especially want to thank the hotel housekeeper, Sister Han! She is so warm and thoughtful! Kind and warm! It was Children's Day, and she also gave my baby a doll! The children's slippers are also full of Chinese elements! It's really nice! Next time I come to Beijing, I will still choose this one! Super cost-effective! Of course, it would be better if the minibar was free for the first round...

The bathtub seemed to be in a dead corner, and there was a layer of mud after scrubbing. Showering was a benefit. It was very quiet at night, and the bed was very comfortable. There was no desk in the room, which was inconvenient for those who like to write. The swimming pool was smaller than that of an average five-star hotel, and it was good to swim in the morning. The protein food in the breakfast was chicken and duck meat, milk, and chicken sausage. The price was fair. There were also some ordinary fruits.

Food and eating are very convenient. There are 3 underground lines (lines 1, 5, 8) to choose from. (The school is not very close to the underground, but can walk) The hotel is clean, the room is spacious, but the lights in the room are a little too bright.

msg:Location: Wangfujing Street, next to the Catholic Church, relatively close to Jinyu Hutong subway exit B, so it feels like a big hideaway in the city. The entrance of the lobby is very hidden, you only see it when you see various vehicles coming and going😆
Environment: Neat, clean, spacious and bright. The Dynasty Plaza used for breakfast makes people look forward to the feeling of holding a wedding here😅
Decoration: It has been around for a long time. Many people think it is old-fashioned. They were worried at first after reading other people's comments. After moving in, I found that the decoration is very simple, the furniture is in place, everything is available, the color scheme is grand, and the decorative paintings are also very stylish. There is a shower with a fixed nozzle, which is quite reassuring🤣Also🛁The apar**ent has an area of ​​30 square meters and a reasonable layout, so you won't feel bored if you stay for several days in a row. The bedding is also very good 👍
Scenery: Those facing the street on the 6th floor can see the rolling hills in the distance, and those on the 7th floor can see Jingshan Park and Beihai Park😁
Service: Polite and considerate🥹Don’t bother, invoices are issued in a timely manner. A middle-aged woman with unknown surname at the front desk and a handsome guy named Deng need special praise👍👍👍The procedure for storing luggage at the concierge is simple and quick, but it is reassuring and saves trouble. Otherwise, it would be so stupid to travel around the world with a suitcase😆🤣🤣🤣
Price: King bed rooms and standard rooms are 699 per night. Ctrip can cancel on the same day. Compared with Dianping, which can confirm immediately and cannot cancel, it is a bit more expensive, which is understandable. After all, business trips are often uncertain, so you need to A little freedom of choice, and this sense of relaxation requires money to achieve.
Feeling: Very good, highly recommended if you are not short of money😆

This location is very convenient for friends and relatives to visit or for us to go for a walk in the old alley. We can also go to nearby Wangfujing Street, Tiananmen Square, Houhai Jingshan, etc. to walk around the Forbidden City. The parking fee at the hotel is not expensive. If you rent a car, you will have no worries about entering and exiting the hotel. The sanitation and catering services are pretty good. The lobby and atrium are grand. It's convenient to receive friends and get together for a short time, leaving a good impression.

Hygiene: Cleaning is very clean every day. The room has a lot of water and is comfortable to take a shower. The only downside is that the shower room is too narrow, and it is not convenient for girls to turn around after taking a shower~

Service: The waiter will put two more bottles of water every day, and leave a message saying that the weather is hot and pay attention to replenishing water. If the clothes want to dry quickly, you can turn on the exhaust fan, which is very considerate~

Overall, I am very satisfied. The old-brand StarWorld Hotel has settled down, and I can feel it from the details. I am very satisfied with my stay.

msg:The location of this hotel is not bad, but the room is very noisy. I don’t know whether it is outside or upstairs at 10 o’clock in the evening. There is also a knocking sound. I called the service desk, and the front desk staff was also very arrogant. They said to respond to the manager, and then disappeared. No audio! Every day I can't swipe the room card to get in, I have tossed up and down several times, on a hot day, I have to go back and forth several times to open the door, and there is no one! I won’t mention the facilities of the hotel. The biggest feature is just one, noisy!

On the way back to the room, I went to the waiter on the floor to get the water and black tea I needed. The black tea bag prepared in the hotel, when I opened the room, I was surprised to find that the waiter had prepared the items I needed very carefully. Seeing this message, I was touched to the depths of my heart. I was really touched. I wanted to ask who Han Haiying was, but it happened that I was asking her. I asked the child to thank her, and Han Haiying even gave the child a gift 🎁, my God, the people of Beijing are so caring, considerate and loving! A very warm trip❤️❤️No luxury hotel can compare to warm service, because there are dedicated waiters like Han Haiying to make the five-star hotel more warm and less distanced.

3. When I checked in, I found footprints on the sheets, and the customer service replaced them in time, explaining that they were not washed clean🤔
4. The sewer in the bathroom is poorly drained, causing water to flood Jinshan when taking a shower. The situation is the same when changing another room. We can only notify the engineering depar**ent to clear it. Don't other guests report similar situations?
5. When these situations arise, the hotel does not express anything other than calling someone to deal with them. It is not the service of a five-star hotel.

The atrium is huge, with a European style and momentum. The sightseeing elevator swipe the card to go directly to the floor, and you can see the scenery of the atrium in the passageway on the floor. The girl at the front desk was very enthusiastic and helped me choose a room with a view of the Forbidden City (although it can only be seen from a distance, and there is a construction site in front). The interior of the room is small, even the deluxe double room is small, and the decoration and facilities are relatively old. If you pay attention to the details, there will be more problems, after all, it has been a long time. Although the room can order food delivery, but told that there is no Chinese food delivery, only some western food can be ordered. It seems that the advantage of changing the hotel is still the location.

msg:Yes, the location is convenient, especially suitable for visiting Beijing. The coffee hall on the third floor is a rare and spacious meeting place. The Chinese food on the second floor is authentic Beijing style, quiet and noble, in stark contrast to those restaurants in the Wangfujing area that are mostly overcrowded. Room details are also taken care of. It is a good value for money hotel in this area.

msg:930 on a Saturday night, this price should not be too low
Service: When I made the reservation, I booked two rooms, one promised early check-in at 10.00, and the other promised to check-in at 14.00, but when I arrived at 12.30, it said that it hadn’t been cleaned. Let’s go out for a meal. We finally found a clean room first. Checked in, the sanitation is true, it usually looks dusty, I went out to have a meal and came back, it was almost 4 o'clock after 3 o'clock, and I told me that the other room hadn't been cleaned yet, so what kind of cleaning should I do? Seeing that we are not easy to deal with, I said to clean it as soon as possible and send the room card. Does it mean that if you don’t make a fuss, you have to wait to check in at night?


Facilities: The room we were given was very far away from the elevator, and it was very old. It can be considered a four- or five-star hotel. The shower can’t be removed. The shower cubicle is very small and disappears when you stand alone. The room is very small , I originally booked a twin bed for the sake of bringing children because the big bed would be crowded, but the double bed is only 1.2 meters, adults can easily turn over, and it is even more crowded when bringing a child. The bed is still high, and the child will be green when he falls. , Originally, the family came out to have fun, but because of the good mood of the hotel, they fell into the bottom of the valley. I know that when I bring children, I return the room so far away. When I went there, the hotel held activities and it was very noisy.

In summary, this is a so-called old 5-star hotel with an old and dilapidated environment, and the price is not cheap. The only advantage is that it is close to Wangfujing, so I might as well live in a quicker and cheaper place. I am really speechless.

msg:This time I brought my parents to Beijing. I saw that this hotel was very close to Wangfujing and it was still a 5-star hotel. I chose this hotel to stay for 4 days. Unexpectedly, the experience was very bad:
The waiter was extremely unenthusiastic. There were four of us, two in their 60s and two in their 80s. We brought three suitcases, one large, two small, and four backpacks. When we arrived at the hotel, there was no waiter to help arrange the luggage cart, so we asked for it when we checked in. We arranged for a more convenient room, but when we got the room card and went upstairs, we found out that it was the room at the farthest end from the elevator. Because it is a zigzag building, there was only one way to go around when the elevator came out. We dragged the suitcase by ourselves and went around 3 times. We walked to the end of the room, but there was a construction site opposite the window. We were speechless. We were asked to change rooms only after our strong request. For breakfast the next day, the variety was small, and the hot porridge and pasta were all available. It's not hot. If you look carefully, there are no flames on the bottom that should be heated. The coriander at the freshly made noodle stall is rotten and turned black. I told the waiter and then took out another portion of coriander. The next day it was again. It's the same as before; the hotel's TV can't be watched, and every channel is unclear and snowflake-like. The waiter said that the hotel is old, and people from the engineering depar**ent couldn't solve it, saying there was a problem with the computer room; the waiter also had to deal with cleaning the room. Errands, the soap for washing hands was rotten and was not changed for several days. The room was not cleaned. The quilt was arranged haphazardly while we were eating. There were not all towels in the bathroom... All of the above, I finally reported to the hotel that there was a man who claimed to be Ma. The manager on duty in the lobby was also very unfriendly and asked the booking platform Ctrip to resolve the problem. This kind of hotel needs to reach the stars!

msg:Location: Excellent. It is very convenient to travel by subway. It is only six to seven hundred meters away from the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City. Other scenic spots can be reached within seven or eight subway stations.
Food: The breakfast variety and taste are indeed average. For people who love coffee, the coffee tastes sour and astringent, which may be a problem with the roasting of the coffee beans. One thing to say, the breakfast is indeed not up to five-star standards. The Chinese restaurant on the second floor tastes pretty good, and I personally feel it is more Cantonese cuisine.
Accommodation: After all, the hotel has been built for a long time, so we can't be too picky. The bathroom layout is slightly small, and I don't know if the automatic toilet was newly replaced in recent years. The bath products have no special brands or features. They are really average. Guests with higher requirements are recommended to bring their own. The room has a low ceiling, which is completely different from modern hotels. It must have been a fashion in that era. The bed is quite comfortable. To sum up, although it is not up to the five-star level of new hotels now, it is still very good as an old hotel.
Marketing: Because we checked in on New Year's Eve, the hotel lobby layout and the behavior of the staff did not have a festive feeling. Even if we walked face to face, there would be no "Happy New Year", and there were no welcome fruits or small souvenirs. Blessings like that. It’s not that it’s necessary to have something or give it as a gift, but I feel that if you choose your hotel to celebrate the New Year or New Year, even if the hotel just puts a few small blessing characters on the bed in the room or even gives a red envelope with the hotel’s logo, it will It feels more nostalgic and festive.
In the end, the overall stay experience was quite satisfactory, and I would consider staying here again if I go there again in the future. All the staff worked hard during the Chinese New Year👍

msg:I always stay in this hotel every time I go to Beijing, but I was disappointed this time. Due to the epidemic, the Beijing Health Treasure window popped up the next day after I arrived. I found it at 5 o'clock in the morning. After asking at the front desk, I was asked to come back at 8 o'clock. It was a bit inexplicable. Doesn’t every front desk staff know the local epidemic prevention policy? I went there at 8 o'clock. After asking, I was asked to go for a test every three days. Due to the pop-up window, I was not allowed to take any means of transportation, and there were regulations for the place where nucleic acid was done. The nearest one was the Sixth People's Hospital, which was 2.7 meters away. Kilometers or so, we who haven’t cycled for a long time can only bite the bullet and ride shared bicycles. On the day we arrived on the 26th, the nucleic acid test done at 4 p.m. was reported at 00:08 on the 27th. After asking the front desk in the morning, we set off on our bike to do the nucleic acid test. Without thinking too much, we went back to the room, and then went downstairs to inquire. Is it possible to eliminate the pop-up window after the report made by the front desk in the morning came out? I found out that the report made in the morning came out after 3pm, so the two reports issued on the 27th did not meet the requirement of two inspections in three days. I had no choice but to ride out again at 4pm. I asked the front desk when the Sixth Hospital would end the nucleic acid test, and was told by the insurance center that we could go there at 4:00 or 5pm. It turned out that the Sixth Hospital could do it 24 hours a day, so the two of us girls Wandering on the road, I waited until 8 o'clock before doing nucleic acid tests to ensure that the report came out on the 28th. I also feel that now that the epidemic is normalizing, Tianlun Dynasty's service is beyond words. Should the five-star standard be based on the normalization of the epidemic? It has changed based on the situation. At least it is humane. Even if the front desk asks more carefully, after all, we all showed our mobile phones to the front desk, neither of us will be like this. And if you ask, everyone seems to have a clear understanding of the epidemic prevention policy. It's very inexplicable. Our pop-up window is 1, but the front desk said that most of the pop-up windows are 3... But the pop-up windows are not under our control. Can we only deal with 3? The next day, my companion called the front desk to ask if they could help us cancel the pop-up window for registration. One of the front desk staff had a very bad attitude and said, why didn’t you come to the front desk to report the pop-up window? You can imagine the professionalism of this. In the end I have stayed here for the first time. It is an old five-star hotel and I feel it is not worthy of it. Good service is not just a cleaning lady who can say hello or store luggage and provide warm hospitality. Now that the epidemic is normalized, I can tolerate the old facilities here. There is no such process for helping guests solve problems. I reported my room number repeatedly, but no one ever came to ask if they had done the nucleic acid test or if they had reported it for us. I had to go to the front desk to ask. There are many good hotels around, and they are only a hundred or two hundred more expensive than here. I will never choose here again. After reading the reviews of surrounding hotels, I feel that the guests' feelings are very good, and they are solved quickly, instead of being anxious like us. Wait and rely on yourself for everything.

Because the child’s time is limited at noon, the service center manager Wei and her colleagues specifically instructed the restaurant to serve meals as soon as possible and deliver them to the room in time. I was really touched, thank you very much!

At the beginning, I was still entangled in choosing the crown or the family. After staying, I felt that the family was very good and sensitive to sound. I arranged a large bed room with a window next to the atrium, which was very comfortable.
The sanitation of the guest rooms is also very good, and the clothes are folded for help when I go out, very careful.
The swimming pool water quality is also good

Outside the window of the room is a large construction site, and construction is done at 8 o'clock every day! In short, a terrible experience!

The renewal cost is 1,558. The one I booked online the night before was 637, which was more than doubled at once. Then I said if I can’t check out, I’ll have to pay half a day’s money, you say What's the point of this! You should call before 2 o’clock to ask if you can refund or check out. If you don’t ask, just increase the fare and force you to check out. You can rent it to a higher-priced person. Oh my god, it’s a five-star next to Huangchenggen. Hotel, think about it...

msg:一個充其量三星水平的掛牌五星老酒店，房間小得兩個人轉身就能相撞；電視是用來擺設的，衹能看他們家酒店自己的廣告，別的內容沒有，遙控器全英文（難不成來住他們家酒店的必須都得英語過四級才有資格?）。最可笑的是沐浴房的花灑🚿，不知道是哪年的哪個設計師作品，我在想，它到底是給人洗澡用的呢，還是專門用來沖洗對面玻璃牆用的，沖個浴還得緊貼着玻璃牆，要麼就根本沖不到水，花灑頭還是固定的，角度得跟着它走。

服務真的很好，衹要你有需要。大概在三點左右，服務人員電話都接起來很快，大概10分鐘以內送到房間。
如果行李多，一定要跟前台説，千萬千萬讓他們分配離電梯近的房間給你！！！
酒店背面就是核酸檢測點，很近，人不多
對港澳台人士沒有別的要求
離王府井步行街超級近，走路2-3分鐘到達，地鐵站也差不多

가구나 카펫 색상으로 인해 방은 전체적으로 어두웠음. 
위치.서비스.수영장.식사 괜찮음. 방은 좁음. 가족이라면 더 큰방 추천 .

msg:I force you to check out. The room charge for 24 hours is what people are used to. Remember that accommodation is charged for 24 hours. If the tenant leaves early, there is no problem. If it is 12 o'clock the next day If I urge you, that's the overlord clause. Don't worry about him. You can choose to call the police and keep the evidence.
