msg:Overall nice, historical hotel with, great location to explore Tianjin. However during our stay there were some drawbacks:
- The rooms to the rear of the old part of the building are really noisy, even though the windows and doors have been replaced with modern ones. It's not understandable to me why a five star hotel replaces windows and balcony doors with insufficient ones if they decide to do so.
- We wanted to use the pool/wellness area, which was closed due to "technical issues". No further explanation, compensation etc. was given and this has not been communicated during the booking or elsewhere.
- We showed up at 10:30 sharp for breakfast (which was until 10:30 at least) and were sent away since "there's nothing left". Also, no compensation was offered except for some cheap fridge magnet from the hotel's museum. 

Overall, value for money is questionable (1600 RMB for one night). Next time I will choose a hotel of an established international chain, such as Shangri-La.

The lobby floor extends its wing to a spacious restaurant with semi-transparent chalky glass ceiling through which natural light casted from the above and a cozy Japanese eatery.  A few steps out of its facade is a thoroughfare alongside beautiful river; wherefrom you see high Shangri-La signage across the river.

On June 7th, a male staff member in a white shirt in the breakfast room took the initiative to help us prepare crispy rice noodles and tofu curd. We would like to express our gratitude.

Health: Very clean, both in the lobby and in the room. It feels like the bathroom floor could use some more water stains.

Environment: The historical atmosphere is very strong, especially the museum. After listening to the professional explanation, I like it even more. One of the rooms we booked was lived by Tan Kah Kee, and there were introductions and books by Tan Kah Kee in the room.


Facilities: Overall good. There was a problem with flushing the toilet in Tan Kah Kee's guest room in the Museum Building at first, but later I fiddled with it and it was no longer a problem. We can also check it regularly.

Summary: Overall good, I like it very much! Will continue to stay in the future

The location of the hotel is also very good, right by the Haihe River and not far from the Fifth Avenue.
The room facilities are a bit average, but after all, it is a 160-year-old hotel and a key cultural relic protection unit. It is impossible to make major changes.
What you are experiencing is history. When someone walks around in the next room, the floor in your own room creaks. It feels very historical.
It is recommended to experience the stay. If you are looking for comfort, it is a different matter.

After completing the formalities, a young man came to help with the luggage and guided us to the room. Along the way, we explained the functional areas and historical background of the hotel. It seemed as if we had entered a museum. The corridor was quiet and comfortable. The room was right next to the century-old elevator. The room was comfortable, spacious, tidy and clean, and there was a big bed with a sense of age. I rented a cheongsam in the hotel museum, put on a cheongsam and took cheongsam photos in the hotel for a morning. At 14 o'clock in the afternoon, I listened to the tour guide explain the development history of the hotel museum. The experience of staying for one night was full of memories. It is worth recommending to friends who love Ming Guofeng. Come to the hotel to take photos and check in. üè®

The hotel is still well maintained, with a heavy historical flavor, but all kinds of facilities are very useful, and the supplies and linens are of high quality.
Except for the girl who helped me check in in the middle of the night, the other service staff were very polite and courteous.
I was deeply impressed by the service staff in the breakfast restaurant. Because my elderly family is in a wheelchair, and there were a lot of people dining during the May Day holiday, I received extra care from the breakfast restaurant service staff throughout the whole process. It was more enthusiastic, caring and thoughtful than the butler service in luxury hotels. I sincerely thank all the staff in the breakfast restaurant! I will stay at Lishunde next time I come to Tianjin, because of you!

msg:As a hotel with a long history, it is understandable that some places are old. However, a hotel called Tianjin Luxury Hotel, which was renovated in 2010, not only has poor sanitation, but also many stains on the carpet, and garbage that is not cleaned up in time. There is visible dust in the corners of the guest room floor, and even the seal ***** of the shower door in the bathroom is aging and missing, which leaks seriously when in use. Moreover, the floor of the bathroom is higher than the floor outside. In order to avoid affecting the floor, the tenants have to wipe it with a towel constantly. The flush toilet needs to be turned on and off several times to store water, otherwise it will leak and cannot be flushed. Because it was very late, the hotel was not asked to repair it. I just spent one night there. The check-in experience was really bad. The wall tiles were broken and in a dilapidated state. How could it be worthy of the title of a star-rated luxury hotel? It is just a false name and is completely maintained by eating old capital. In addition, the breakfast is also very average.

There is a 1.5-meter bed, which is inconvenient for people to pass on both sides. The bedding is clean, but the mattress is soft. There is a big balcony outside the house. I wanted to sit there and drink some beer at night, but I didn't expect that due to neglect, the iron chairs were rusted. I wiped it for a long time but it didn't help. Finally, I had to give up. Two tickets to the hotel museum were given when I booked the room. There are many things with historical marks that can be visited. The service is satisfactory. If you need anything, it is best to go to the front desk in person. If you call, you will have to wait for a long time.

Lishunde's unique museum contains many precious collections and cultural relics, embodying profound cultural heritage and describing the changes in modern history and the past of historical figures. The exhibitions and explanations are fascinating. The old lobby of the hotel is even more dazzling: the split wall-mounted telephone, the grand and simple fireplace, the imported precious piano, and the gorgeous and elegant chandeliers are all amazing. In particular, the wide palace-style wooden staircase and the revolving wooden door marked "1863" are more noble and mysterious, as if telling the story of the entrance and exit of Chinese and foreign celebrities such as Sun Yat-sen, Yuan Shikai, Xu Shichang, Hoover, Mei Lanfang... ‚Ä¶
       The service at Lishunde Hotel is also very good. The lady at the lobby front desk who adjusted our room on the 20th (probably surnamed Lu) and the man who handled our check-out procedure on the 21st (surnamed Huang) worked hard and had a warm attitude.

The hotel was built in 1863, 161 years ago, and has hosted many celebrities in history. If you want to immerse yourself in the history of a hundred years ago, it is recommended to choose a room in the museum wing. The only drawback is that some of the facilities and decorations in the room have a certain "history". For example, the cracked tiles in the bathroom are quite obvious.
The atrium of the hotel can be used for afternoon drinks and is also suitable for taking photos. There is a museum underground where you can intuitively understand the historical changes of the hotel over the past century. The museum has a guide at 14:00 every afternoon. The explanation given by Mr. Wang Chen this time was very interesting. The Tianjin dialect combined with the popular language is like a stand-up comedy, and it is worthy of being the best.

It is floor-mounted. The air outlet partition is twisted and the noise from the air affects the rest. Because the room is a river view room, it is next to the road. Although the hotel and the hotel were not connected when we checked in. There were not many people and cars on the road, but the surrounding environment was very noisy during the lunch break, making it difficult to sleep. It must be because the sound insulation of the room was not good; the headboard of the bed in the room was in the west, which was unacceptable, so I did not extend my stay. I chose Lishunde because of its history and its museums, just experience it.

The Victorian rooms are also very good. They have a sense of age and are well maintained. You don't have to worry about them becoming unsuitable due to age.
The terrace in the guest room is great. We also encountered spring snow during this trip, which fully satisfied the surprise and yearning of snow for southerners.
Of course, there must be imperfections. For a follower of the Prime Minister, not visiting the Xihua Hall is the biggest regret of this trip.

It's very high, the details are in place, and it has the tone of an old hotel.
The breakfast is also good, the place is small, but the variety is complete and the quality is high.
We also tried a Western restaurant, and the bread was super delicious.

msg:The hotel is quite good, and the experience is generally good. It is similar to the Licha Hotel in Shanghai and the Xinxin Hotel in Hangzhou, both focusing on the British style of the Republic of China. It is a pity that Licha is no longer a hotel, but has become a securities museum. It is really rare that Tianjin Lishunde can continue to operate. The original English names of both hotels were ASTOR house hotel, so the north and the south echoed each other. The quality of 1863's Western restaurant needs to be improved, but the front desk service is very good, with proactive upgrades and some unexpected surprise services. It is very proactive and professional üëç

My only suggestion is that the tea table next to the closet is a bit cramped and inconvenient to operate. You can consider moving it near the desk.

The rich sense of history will take you through time in minutes. All facilities are well maintained and will not affect the experience of staying because of their age. The hotel has its own museum. Guests of the hotel can also visit for free; it is located in a historical area by the Haihe River, and you can see the scenery wherever you go; the service staff of the hotel are friendly and natural. When we went there, it was snowing heavily in Tianjin, so the hotel called in advance to ask if it was necessary to visit in advance. After checking in, the buffet breakfast arranged Tianjin specialties, and the service staff also took the initiative to guide us in the preparation. It was super delicious! All in all a highly recommended hotel!

I was impressed that the hotel had a museum and was full of Tianjin's history. Moreover, the room they prepared for me was a room where a great person from the Republic of China had stayed a hundred years ago, which was also wonderful.
Overall it was good, but I feel that the facilities need maintenance. The toilet paper holder was loose, the air conditioner sounded like a truck, there were no instructions on how to operate it, the outlet on the bedside was at an angle, and other small details need to be checked carefully.

The suite is very large. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry areas. There is a TV in the bathtub. It is very suitable for bringing children. The room temperature is very high, so just wear half-sleeves. We visited the museum and the old hotel building, which enhanced our stay experience. I am very satisfied with the breakfast buffet. Firstly, the seats are arranged, so there is no trouble of finding a seat. Secondly, the food tastes very good. The pancakes and fruits are much better than those in Beijing. You can roll fried dough sticks and fruit sticks, which is full of sincerity. The fly in the oin**ent is that the museum specially bought a stamped passport, but all the special stamps inside were stamped, and there was no sense of experience. In addition, in the sunroom, restaurant, cafe, bar, etc., either there was no stamp, or it was during non-business hours, and only the restaurant was stamped. During this period, I consulted the front desk but did not understand the matter of stamping, which means that the hotel and the museum do not share information and do their own thing.

When staying at Lishunde Hotel, you can visit the hotel museum, which is very helpful for understanding the modern history of Tianjin. The hotel itself is a witness of a century-old building and is a national key cultural relic protection unit. The hotel still retains the style of European classical architecture and the characteristics of European medieval pastoral rural architecture. It is a unique representative building of Tianjin's original style at that time. The current main entrance of the hotel is on the Haihe River, which is convenient for viewing the scenery of the Haihe River. The museum entrance of the hotel is on the Financial Street of Jiefang North Road, where you can visit century-old buildings. When traveling to Tianjin, staying at the Lishunde Hotel is very convenient for understanding Tianjin's nearly century-old history and for visiting the Haihe River and Tianjin's Five Avenues.
If you want to experience the old house when staying at Lishunde Hotel, remember to choose the Victoria room.

If nothing else, the wooden floor will creak as it ages. Pancakes and fruit tubes for breakfast. enough! Consumption is lower than that of Imperial City! I will definitely recommend Tianjin Wei as a resort!

Because I came on a Thursday night, there were very few people, and I felt like I was in an old castle! I especially like the bar here. It has a shadowy and charming beauty at night, and there is also a band performance. It is such an amazing experience! The most important thing is that I like everything about the hotel and the considerate service. I am also very happy to meet the front desk staff Amanda this time. She is very sunny and warm.

msg:I came here to feel the historical and cultural a**osphere. I was not disappointed. Overall, I was very satisfied and praised it!
[1]. The hotel is located on Taierzhuang Road. The driving navigation first passed the old building on Jiefang North Road, then turned around and arrived. It is very convenient. Although the courtyard is not big, there is always a parking space.
„Äê2„Äë. Entering the hotel, looking around, the interior is full of history and British style. Facing the flower stand with the words "Lishunde" written on it, Phalaenopsis orchids are blooming. In the domed Victorian garden atrium, accompanied by a piano and flowing water, people can enjoy afternoon tea leisurely. Because of its reputation, weddings are often held in the banquet hall here. It was the weekend, so there were many wedding guests, old and young, in the hall, taking pictures one after another. Indeed, in Lishunde, everywhere you look you can check in and take pictures.
[3]. Under the guidance of the Indian concierge who is proficient in Chinese, I have already booked a balcony room outside the old building. After checking it, I hurriedly took two photos and finally chose the inner balcony room facing the dome patio. Mainly because of these few The temperature in Tianjin is too cold every day. If the weather is warm, you can sit on the wicker chair on the balcony, have a cup of afternoon tea, hold a book, and look at the bustling people outside. You must be in style.
„Äê4„Äë. Stepping on the wooden floor and passing the 1923 OTIS elevator, we arrived at our room. Because I had done my homework before coming here, I had an expected impression of the overall feeling of the room. The mottled solid wood door, old-fashioned furniture and carpets, and the copper chandelier with withered yellow light gave me a sense of returning to a hundred years ago.
„Äê5„Äë. The room is well heated, very clean, and the facilities are complete and convenient. It is said that the entire building was renovated in 2010. My favorite is the curved writing table. There is also an old-fashioned telephone on the table, which is very Republican-style. It reminds me of scenes in spy dramas. There is no shower room in the bathroom, and the shower faucet splashing everywhere above the old bathtub is a little helpless. Fortunately, I have been mentally prepared before the trip. It is just an experience, and we cannot demand perfection.
„Äê6„Äë. Just like the online reviews, Lishunde‚Äôs breakfast is very good, with a full range of varieties and very fresh, but the noodles in the open stall did not conquer me, who loves noodles. Because there was a phone call, breakfast had to be completed before nine o'clock. The waiter thoughtfully packed a large cup of coffee and took it back to the lounge chair on the hotel balcony to enjoy it.

msg:5.1 Traveling, it is said to be an ancient hotel, so I came here because of its reputation. First things first: the front desk service was good. We arrived at around 1pm and the room was not available yet. There was a wedding in the hotel and the parking space was very tight. The waiter patiently guided us to find a parking space. Including introducing the hotel surroundings, etc. Just across the road from the hotel is the Haihe River. The scenery is good and there are few people. It is suitable for leisure vacation. There is Hisense Plaza around the hotel, which is also very convenient for eating and shopping. I booked a room in the new building. The room including the bathroom is very large. The hotel breakfast is okay, the pancakes and fruits are really delicious. Besides, it doesn‚Äôt feel so good: the hotel is indeed a bit old. Even if I live in a new building, the facilities in the room are also old. For example, the floor creaks when I first enter the door. I often can‚Äôt tell whether it is the floor or the door opening. The water in the toilet is very slow, so even if the toilet is rushed, there is still a smellüí©. The hot water in the shower is directly proportional to the volume of water. If you want hot water, the volume of water will be huge. If you want small water, the water will be cold. I don't know who designed it. The breakfast environment was average, the tables and chairs looked old and not that clean. The countertop where the soy milk pot is located is filthy.

A female forty-year-old short-haired foreman at the front desk said with a straight face that there was no water at the front desk, but in the room. It is normal to say sorry to the hotel guests at this time, rather than embarrassing the guests to prove that there is nothing wrong with the way you work. Generally, the hotels I have stayed at will prepare bottled water at the front desk. I won‚Äôt mention too many specific names, but in this state-owned hotel, the free tea at the front desk is sweet sugar water or hot, and there is no water prepared for departure. Customers take it to drink on the road. It‚Äôs done right but it‚Äôs too rough. It‚Äôs rare for the service industry to have no service. It doesn‚Äôt cost much mineral water money to improve it. Give some suggestions so that merchants can see it and it will become a new KPI.

msg:Friends, before I come to Tianjin, I must stay in Lishunde for a day and experience the oldest high-end hotel! At that time, I was still hesitating between the Ritz-Carlton and Banyan Tree, but later I was obedient and chose Lishunde!
Before I checked in, GRO called me and asked me about my room arrangement needs. I saw on the Internet that the hotel's river view room has two sets of windows. I told her that I wanted to live in this kind of room, and she also told me very gently. Arrangements can be made once vacancies come out.
The room is large, and the window faces Lishunde Pier. On the opposite bank is a row of old buildings, which is very beautiful. The bathroom is very large, with two sets of wash basins, dry and wet separated. The room has a sense of history, but is not shabby. It has a normal old hotel style and does not need to be too harsh. The bedding is very comfortable and the central air conditioner is a little loud. Low consumables are of average quality.
The hotel has its own museum in the old building, which is worth visiting. There are the oldest elevators, revolving doors, telephones... This hotel has witnessed the most complex and legendary history in the late Qing Dynasty and the early years of the Republic of China. All the famous figures, generals and celebrities gathered here. Pu Yi, Yuan Shikai dined here, Li Hongzhang Meeting foreign envoys, various capitalists, and warlords also held meetings here. Mei Lanfang and Ma Lianliang both lived here. Hoover, Panchen Lama, Liang Qichao, Huang Xing, Xu Shichang, Gu Weijun, Cai E... there are too many... There is a nameplate next to the house number of many rooms in the old building, which writes the history and story of this room!
Since its opening in 1983...Astor has witnessed half of modern Chinese history...**!
The hotel's western restaurant is very famous, but I was too late to enjoy it. I ordered food delivery before leaving, and it was very fast. The Lishunde Big Burger was delicious, and the children would like it very much!

When I was about to get on the bus, the girl at the front desk hurried over and handed the handbag to me. I was very touched and appreciated their actions of not knowing how to find money.

msg:We have almost stayed in all the top hotels in Tianjin. This time I chose the "No. 1 Hotel in China". The museum is just an introduction and promotion, and it doesn't seem to have any special highlights. There is an Indian doorman at the main entrance of the new building on the Haihe River side. The wooden revolving door of the old building on the Jiefang North Road side is magical. There is also a senior greeter after entering the door. That emphasis is like traveling back in time!

After some research, the Victoria Room is in the same row as the celebrity guest room. The rooms are the same. It can be considered as neighbors with celebrities. I specially booked a street-view balcony room, which is very comfortable. It is soothing to drink tea on the balcony and look at the castle view in autumn.

The toiletries are decent. Although they are not from a big brand, the shampoo and conditioner are very useful, and the moisturizer is especially easy to absorb.

It‚Äôs hard to describe the shower head. The shower head on the top is like a fountain. I didn‚Äôt notice it when I washed it for the first time. After washing, the floor was completely covered with water. It even wet the solid wood floor of the living room. As a resident of a century-old building, I couldn‚Äôt bear to waste it like this. I rushed Mop the floor. The suspension of the small shower head is very low. After discovering the problem with the overhead spray, I could only wash it while squatting with the small shower head... It was difficult and miserable...

It was very quiet at night, and the mattress was a bit soft, which I can accept. However, the pillows and quilts were really uncomfortable. The pillows were low where they lay, and high elsewhere. My neck felt tight after lying on it for a while. The quilt was hot when I covered it. Open to cool, not breathable. I woke up irritated until midnight.

In addition, the room is a bit dark. I am young but can‚Äôt see clearly...

Although I mentioned the bad points above, I can feel that the hotel room is very carefully decorated and has everything it needs. The quality of the supplies and tea bags is also acceptable.

Overall, the location of the hotel is quite downtown, but the compensation is that there are not many places to eat nearby. There is Qishilin and Ma Zilu not far away, but not much else. There is nothing to order from the takeaway. It's okay to stay fresh and fresh for a while. Although the balcony is good, from the perspective of overall comfort, I really wouldn't choose this hotel again.

I arrived at noon, and then I wasn't allowed to check in. I had to wait until 3 or 2 o'clock. The luggage was placed on the edge of the front desk. The people at the front desk were busy communicating with others. Even if no one was watching, no one would notice if it was taken away.
The hotel is based on culture, so the facilities will be simpler and older, with only one small window.
In short, average. It‚Äôs more of a gimmick than an experience.

It is a hotel with a long history that has witnessed Tianjin‚Äôs colonial history for more than a hundred years. When visiting the Five Avenues, the tour guide also I specifically mentioned that this hotel museum is worth visiting, and I immediately felt that choosing to stay in this hotel was worth the money! The location of the hotel is very good. It is right on the river. Walking at night is also a very good feeling. The hotel room is very large, and the dressing room and bathroom are very large. They are much larger than ordinary hotels. The best thing is the double room. The beds are all 1.5 meters large, which is a very cost-effective choice for a family of three.

But I feel that for such a famous hotel, the service still needs to be improved. It was raining, and at the steps of the lobby, the service staff just opened the door when they saw me, and no one came to help me carry my luggage. Check-in took a long time, but check-out was quite quick. The museum is pretty good and can be visited in about 20 minutes.

The wooden floor in the room creaks when you walk in. The toilet handle could also be maintained as it is very difficult to open and heavy. Anything else is fine

Having stayed at the Ritz-Carlton across the street, I felt that the hardware facilities were very good, but the staff service training was insufficient. But in Lishunde, when we opened the door to the room, we were all pleasantly surprised, and I was not disappointed! First of all, the room is very large, so several people in one room will not feel cramped. In addition, although we did not choose the Victorian room type, the decoration and layout of the room is also very unique. Just outside the room is the Lishunde Pier, and I watched a wonderful fireworks show on the night of the 15th day of the first ***** month! The room attendant is very nice. Every time I ask for bottled water, he will add a message and let me know if I need anything. Compared with other five-star hotels, the breakfast is quite satisfactory but everything is delicious. Next time you go to Tianjin, you don‚Äôt have to worry about it anymore, just close your eyes and go in!

During the Spring Festival, I took my elder to visit relatives in Tianjin and booked the hotel one month in advance. The original reservation was from February 8 to February 16. Due to the elder's physical discomfort, I checked out one day in advance on February 15. Due to the room payment, When I checked in, the payment had been completed until the 16th. The check-out front desk said that due to the holiday financial break, I would have to wait until work for one day to refund the room payment. I waited patiently until I went to work on February 19 and called twice to ask, and told the general manager that he had not signed. Until now, he has not signed. Didn't receive refund!

After arriving at the hotel, the attitude of the front desk is very good, and the welcome is also very good. I live in a new building, the decoration style is my favorite. My friends have stayed in both the new building and the old building, and I feel that the new building is more comfortable. After visiting the museum, you must marvel at the rich history of the hotel! The location is also very good. After checking in, you can walk to experience the vicissitudes of Jiefang Road in Tianjin.

After visiting the museum on the first day, I became more fond of this hotel and upgraded to the celebrity suite without hesitation. Although I knew it was just a number and a story, who doesn't want to hear a story? How about entering the story? The balcony is beautiful, the room is very comfortable, and the bed is so big that our whole family can lie down without being crowded. The service in the hotel is very good, warm and polite, but! The sanitation and facilities here are a problem. The facilities may be due to the building structure or other reasons. It is understandable that they are a bit old, but it would be rude if they are broken. In addition, the balcony outside is covered with a thick layer of soil. Although it was explained that this It was dirt from outside, blown by the wind, but it was not cleaned up when you checked in. This is not good. After all, the balcony is so attractive, big and spacious, and in the end, the children were not allowed to play on the balcony. , it‚Äôs so dirty that it feels like it‚Äôs hundreds of years old, which is not appropriate.

From the development of the hotel to related historical celebrities and historical events, the development and changes of Tianjin City will be presented one by one. Most of the museum exhibits are historical collections, which are worth seeing. And I was honored to visit the suite where Mr. Zhongshan stayed three times, and feel the interlacing of time and space in an instant. Of course, if you book in advance, you can also stay in the suite for one night for an in-depth experience. The double room I booked in the new building is spacious and the facilities are slightly outdated, but the maintenance and service levels seem to make up for the shortcomings. Guests really experience the responsive service of a five-star hotel. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich. I especially like pancakes, fruit tofu nao and homemade bread with chilled milk. They all taste good. Of course, the price is also good, breakfast is more than 140 per person, so it is better to book a room with breakfast. In addition, children between the ages of three and twelve are charged half price for breakfast, which is a bit different from the fact that many hotels do not charge children for breakfast. The location of the hotel is far from the starting price of a taxi at Tianjin Station, and it takes 20 minutes to get on the train without pressure. The experience is close to full marks, looking forward to seeing you next time

Needless to say, the historical and cultural value it carries, the experience of staying in it is incomparable to other hotels. The price is definitely worth it.
But there are pros and cons. The level of modernization and comfort of facilities in old hotels is definitely worse than that of modern luxury hotels. Friends who are used to the sense of fashion and modernity of international chain hotels may have to be prepared. And the sound insulation of the old house is slightly worse.
All in all, definitely worth the experience for a night or two! But manage expectations well.

msg:Traveling from Beijing to Tianjin, I specially selected Astor Hotel among many hotels. Not because it is located by the Haihe River, not far from the famous Five Avenues, but because of its rich history. The gate near the Haihe River is actually the back entrance of the newly built hotel. Although it is still magnificent, entering from the back of it really gives people a sense of time travel! 1863 is written on the revolving door, that is to say, the hotel under your feet has a history of 160 years! According to the hotel boy, this is not only a 3A-level scenic spot, but also the only national key cultural relics protection unit among the tens of thousands of hotels in China.
The Astor Hotel is also a museum, where you can see the real scene of the signing of the Sino-French Tianjin Treaty between Li Hongzhang and the French Minister in 1884. You can see the table where Yuan Shikai, governor of Zhili, entertained the rich and distinguished guests. You can still see the piano played by Ms. Zhao Si. It was in the ballroom of this hotel that Zhang Xueliang met the young and beautiful Zhao Si, and thus performed a love affair... The first floor of this hotel is still intact. One of the earliest elevators in China in 1924, touching it is touching a century-old history.
The biggest highlight of Astor Hotel is that you can also own guest rooms where celebrities have stayed. For example, the only presidential suite in the hotel was the one that Mr. Sun Yat-sen stayed in. It is undoubtedly a great luck in life to meet historical celebrities here!
Before I checked into the Astor Hotel, the front desk director took the initiative to call and told me that I was upgraded to a deluxe double room with an inner balcony for free, which moved me very much. As far as personal experience is concerned, the hotel's breakfast is really delicious! There are not only pancakes and fruits with Tianjin characteristics, but also smoked salmon...
I highly recommend this hotel for its unique added value. After you visit the underground museum, touch the nameplates in front of the celebrity rooms one by one, as if Liang Qichao, Huang Xing, Cai E, Gu Weijun and other famous Chinese historical celebrities are right in front of you! This kind of crossing between today and yesterday is impossible for you to feel anywhere in China...

The breakfast doesn't have many varieties, but it tastes good, especially the pancakes and fruits, which are much better than the other two restaurants in this trip. While waiting for the pancakes and fruits, I chatted with the chef of this stall for a while. It was humorous, and it was like listening to a stand-up comedy. , like him!

msg:I took my daughter to travel to Tianjin during the holidays. It was a very good check-in experience. Since the room was still being cleaned when we arrived, the front desk upgraded us to a celebrity suite and gave us breakfast. After depositing my luggage, I went to check in the museum of the hotel. It was really unique, and I gained a new understanding of Tianjin during the Republic of China. The hotel rooms are full of the style of the Republic of China. In addition to the bedroom, there is also a study room and a large balcony, from which you can view Tong. The disadvantage is that the facilities are a bit old, especially the bathroom is relatively small, there is no separate shower room, you can only shower in the bathtub.
In addition, I would like to praise the hotel's breakfast. The place is not big, but there are many varieties. Tianjin's special Gaba dishes, pancakes, fried tofu, fried cakes, etc. are all available, and the taste is also good!

The room type I originally booked was dark and cramped, and it only represents my personal opinion. Therefore, 300 was added to upgrade to the Hanxu celebrity room.
Slot 1. The Chunyue mineral water used in the five-star old-fashioned historic building hotel at 1,300 yuan a night is true and should not be true.
Slot 2. It is no longer the epidemic period. The hotel staff told any staff that they are not allowed to touch takeaway food, or they can walk for three minutes to get it by themselves (Ctrip can only upload 30 seconds of video, you can feel the truth by yourself .), or just order the food provided by the hotel to deliver to the room, please take a look at how big your hotel is, such rules are simply too humane!
Slot 3. The staff can say that they don‚Äôt have any sense of service, and they are indifferent throughout the whole process. They can‚Äôt find their way back with the takeaway. Ask the front desk if they can guide them, and the front desk is eating takeaway for supper? wow~
There will be no next time, Li Shunde is disappointed. The brand story is not used well at all, the price is not worthy of the service, and you can't even catch up with the service of Home Inn.

The bathroom has a bathtub and a separate shower room, which is convenient to use and has a large amount of water. After the meal, the restaurant is next to the Haihe River, and the scenery is particularly beautiful. It is about 4 kilometers away from Tianjin Eye, and the Five Avenues, Fengqing Square, and Jingyuan are all within 2 kilometers. You can walk when the weather warms up. I was pleasantly surprised by the bedding such as the mattress and pillows. The sound insulation of the old house is superb. Couldn't hear anything from outside or next door. I am very satisfied. The breakfast service is in place, and the dishes are quite satisfactory. It would be perfect if the variety and quality of West Point were improved. In short, I am very satisfied. The Astor Museum on the ba*****t floor of the old building is also worth seeing.

Service: very considerate. Response to complaints was quick.
When I checked in, because there was an event the next morning, the atrium was building things all night, so noisy that I couldn't sleep, so I complained in the early morning. The hotel manager responded quickly and immediately arranged another room to rest. When I arrived, I found out that it was still a suite.
Although it is annoying to be too noisy to rest, but the arrangement is still very good

Astor Museum Tickets: Itinerary related, only go after check-out. It is not necessarily used during the stay. This is very good.

Next time I have a chance to come to Tianjin, I will still choose Astor

msg:The first day was full of surprises. The hotel upgraded from the "Victoria Street View Room" to the "Celebrity Room". The most famous guest in the room was Xu Shichang, President of the Republic of China. The hotel has an exclusive webpage video to introduce Xu Shichang's life and the history of the room. It is worthy of the 135-year history of the room. The corridor turns around, and the compar**ent is the suite of the American President Hoover, who caused the Great Depression, when he was making money in China.
The interior, exterior and night views of the hotel are nothing to mention. It is comparable to another Astor Hotel in China and also the hotel with the longest history - Shanghai Waibaidu Qiaotou North Bund Pujiang Hotel (now the China Securities Museum), each with its own advantages.
The breakfast in the hotel is the richest in its class. The fritters and pancakes are salty and the same as the local pancakes in Tianjin. It is a pity that there is no cheese counter. I drank four glasses of double espresso for breakfast.
There is nothing to say about the service, and the service staff are very enthusiastic to take pictures; I didn‚Äôt get the room card, so I went to the museum and just said it; I called the hotel‚Äôs calendar card and gave me one directly; left the charger, the hotel Send someone to retrieve it.
The facilities in the old building of the hotel are the old ones. I love the Victorian balconies, doors and windows. The last time I encountered such a hotel building was at the Fairmont Tree House Hotel in Abu Dale, Kenya (the base of the Queen of England).
Let‚Äôs talk about the hygiene of the hotel. Anyway, there are no water stains on the dinner plates and toilets. This is really rare in northern China where the water quality is hard. The last time I stayed in the old building of the Beijing Hotel, I couldn‚Äôt achieve it.
In the end, when I left, I didn‚Äôt have the emotion of ‚Äúshooting all over the railing‚Äù, but seeing the mirror sky in early spring on the balcony reminded me of Wang Bo‚Äôs last two lines in "Preface to the Pavilion of King Teng": "Where is the emperor in the pavilion now? Outside the threshold The Yangtze River flows by itself."

It is recommended to experience different rooms in the old building every time you stay, although the facilities in the new building are better. If you have time, you must visit the museum - free for hotel guests, usually 50 yuan per person. The Victoria Garden here is very suitable for various activities. The usual English afternoon tea and the 160th anniversary afternoon tea are also great. The hotel service is very good, from the manager, the chef to every waiter, they always try their best to satisfy the customers.

The only improvement suggestion is the ventilation of the western food kitchen in the old building, hoping to completely solve the problem of cooking and barbecue smell in the corridor.

msg:The Astor Hotel, which I have longed for for a long time, finally came to stay this time. The hotel with a museum should be the only one in China. When you come here, you must choose the Victorian style room in the old building.
Hygiene: Hygiene is actually not bad, the room is clean and tidy.

Facilities: Because some of the facilities in the old building are slightly outdated, there are some small areas in the room that need to be maintained.

Service: The service is very good, the staff can be said to be on call, very satisfied.
If you want to feel the style of the Republic of China and the sense of history in the hotel, Astor is really not to be missed.

msg:The most famous hotel in Tianjin in modern Chinese history, go to Five Avenues, an Italian-style neighborhood, and stay in history at night. Looking at the museum in the old building, stepping on the wooden stairs, and looking at the nameplates of the rooms where historical celebrities lived, it feels like time travel. A new building on the side of the Haihe River, with a five-star standard. The waiters are very kind. They upgraded our twin beds for us when they saw our two big ones. The two 1.5-meter beds are enough for sleeping. The view of the Haihe River is also great. Parking points were deducted for the facilities: I came from Beijing, and my family almost voted against this place because it was not easy to park. There was no parking space at 10 a.m. on Saturday, so I turned around Fifth Avenue and came back and stopped quickly. very satisfied with the accommodation

msg:This hotel has been established for nearly 160 years and has carried the vicissitudes of history. The design of the hotel lobby has a sense of age, and there is also a modern history museum that can be visited for freeÔΩû

Environment: Under the window of the room is the exhaust outlet of the restaurant, several large exhaust ducts are very noisy, the room is not soundproof at all, the two young people next door have been tossing for half a night, and they can hear clearly what they are talking about. When I was in the room, I found that there was a big gap between the door and the door frame of each room, especially the lower edge of the door~

Facilities: The furniture is worn to varying degrees, the corners of the tables and chairs are mottled, the drain of the shower room is a stainless steel plate, and the water splashes on it very loudly~ This hotel is really far-fetched in the list of luxury hotels!

Service: Check in at around 4 pm on Saturday, the waiter said that you can enter the room, but there may be no sheets and quilts, because the cleaning has not been delivered~ This is the first time I heard...

The location of the hotel is easy to find. It is about two kilometers away from Tianjin Railway Station. It is very close to Wudao Avenue, Xiaobailou, and Italian Style Street. You can choose to feel the history and culture~

msg:It is a century-old hotel with a good location, facing the Haihe River, and the Astor Wharf at the door. The tourists who live here usually come here for stories, so you have to ask for a pure five-star standard at the same price. It is recommended to choose the one next to it. Ritz-Carlton or Shangri-La, if you stay here, it is recommended to choose the old building, because the new building has a back cover, so there is no such a**osphere. I chose a balcony room at the time, and the hotel gave it to Xu Shichang, the president of the Republic of China. The celebrity room is also a surprise. The next door is the room where Fu Zuoyi lived. It was a bit cold when we came here. You can take a photo in the hotel with a cheongsam, and the special film will be produced! Buffet breakfast is 130 per person. Frankly speaking, the dishes inside are not rich. There are more options like Grand Hyatt at the same price. The service is really good. The breakfast is mainly for convenience. Children aged 3-7 are half priced at 70 per person , not recommended. There was a small episode in the morning when we were leaving the next day, because the waiter sent water to the wrong room, we were forced to "call earlier" than the scheduled time, and woke up an hour earlier. I felt uncomfortable at the time and checked out The hotel staff took the initiative to admit the mistake and presented a Wenchuang refrigerator magnet as a gift. It is not expensive, but I appreciate the initiative to admit the problem, so it can be seen that the concept of hotel management is very good. The child is very reluctant, saying that next time I still want to come to Tianjin and stay in Astor. I think this is the meaning of choosing a hotel for travel. It is not just about living comfortably, but making the hotel an unforgettable memory of your trip!

Guests staying in the hotel can visit the Astor Museum in the hotel for free. The elegant architectural design style and the aura of historical celebrities have created the unique charm of this complex that combines museums and five-star hotels.

msg:A hotel worth living in China. The hotel itself is a witness to the modern history of Tianjin, and it has a longer history than the Peace Hotel. If you have the conditions, you must live in the old building. Celebrity rooms are recommended. Celebrity rooms are for celebrity guests who have lived in them. They are randomly assigned. We were allocated the room where Han Xu and Guan Datong lived, and the room next door was Sihanouk‚Äôs. The next room is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's suite. The facilities in the old building may be outdated, but the room itself is history. The experience downstairs is not available in the rizt room next door. The museum is especially recommended. It is worth listening to and taking a look. I personally think it is more worth seeing than the famous attractions of the porcelain house. Here Li Hongzhang practiced the Westernization Movement to save the country. The Chinese and Western menu he led is worth seeing. Puyi is here for his last free and happy life. Zhang Xueliang met Zhao Si here. Some people complain about the service, so don't have too many requirements for the service in the north. We old people and children stay here, and the service can be satisfied, such as free water and more bath towels can be provided in time. The breakfast tastes good and genuine. I wanted to experience the old menu of the 1863 restaurant. Because of the epidemic and the Spring Festival dishes are very limited, I am a little regretful. I hope that I will have the opportunity to experience it again after the menu is restored.
A hotel worth living in China.

msg:Very historical value, historic hotel! It is divided into old buildings (all the Victorian style buildings written on the reservation are old buildings, unfortunately this time I didn‚Äôt book them this time) and more recent buildings, and there is a supporting apar**ent (building) next to it, which itself is equipped with a The museum is well worth a visit. We live in a modern building. Although it is not as historically valuable as the old building, it still has a very good decoration style and layout, and its room is much larger than the old building. The only downside is that the bathroom is a bit old, but does not affect. The service is also very good! Great location! It is very close to Wudao Avenue, Tai'an Road Fifth Courtyard, nearby European-style buildings (very, very beautiful!), Zhang Xueliang's former residence, porcelain houses, churches, Italian-style scenic spots, etc. Will choose next time, hope to book the old building.

msg:Come here especially, walk into history, walk into the story. It has been three days since I came to Tianjin for sightseeing. I wanted to give it a try and contacted the front desk of the hotel if I could check in earlier. The lady surnamed Liu who answered the phone was very enthusiastic and gave a satisfactory reply. When I checked in at the store, the young lady helped to upgrade the room type, which gave me an unexpected surprise! Putting down my luggage, I couldn't wait to go to the museum, watch it carefully, and listen quietly, as if time has stagnated, and a hundred years have passed...
The wonderful experience and happiness were shared with family and friends in time, and I will definitely come again if I have the opportunity!

However, the hotel upgraded the Huangxing suite. It is next to the Sun Yat-sen suite, facing a small road, and you can see the Haihe River , the experience is very good. The area is very large, very quiet, and I like the decoration very much. The pancakes and fruits for breakfast are also good. The front desk also took a tour of the Sun Yat-sen Suite and the Hoover Suite. The museum is also worth a visit, you can learn about the history of Astor and Tianjin, and will stay again in the future!

msg:The beautiful scenery outside the window is the shaft facing the atrium of the hotel. You have to turn on the lights at noon to see what is in the room. The so-called Victorian deluxe double room, the lighting effect is probably similar to that of a Victorian prison. It is such a room. The lobby manager said it was reserved for other guests, and gave me priority in taking care of me.
Considering that there are a lot of guests on holidays, they came to check in after 5:00 pm, and there was another big family who checked in at the same time, and they checked in smoothly. When it was my turn, the service center confirmed it twice: check in alone, breakfast not included, repeated the second time, I have a feeling that staying alone is not an important customer, and she told me that the room was not cleaned properly, Let me just go somewhere else for dinner and come back.
I said that I can't accept it. If it is not cleaned at 3:30 in the afternoon, I will accept it. If it is not cleaned at 5:30, there is a problem with hotel management.
The lobby manager was found at the front desk, who said that the room was not ready at 5:30, and it was the hotel's problem, but not her problem, without any apology. After a quarrel, the manager of the lobby "kindly" arranged him in a prison room with no light and a shaft outside the window.
The hotel relies on the old to sell the old, and the front desk staff really serve the guests. It is time to abandon the old house with outdated facilities. The service is worse than the outdated facilities.

The room is on the third floor, and the Haihe River can be seen through the gap. The floor drain in the bathroom is not smooth, the bath water overflows seriously, the bedding is obviously damp, and I feel uncomfortable all over. I will leave the store at dawn after a night. The century-old Astoria, the check-in experience is unsatisfactory, I hope to improve it, not an opinion but a suggestion.

The sound insulation effect of the room is very good, and it is relatively quiet. Due to the limitations of the building structure, the rooms and guest room corridors are not well ventilated with the outside world, which instead creates a "warm in winter and cool in summer" effect. Even if the outdoor temperature exceeds 30¬∫, the air conditioner (central air conditioner) is not turned on in the room , and the temperature is only 20¬∫. The English afternoon tea in the hotel's Victoria Garden is also very good. The only downside is that the piano music is played in a loop, which feels a bit blunt.

It was not until the morning of the third day on the 8th that I called the hotel and told me that there was a short sleeve. Forget about the room, although the so-called century-old hotel, the service level is worth two stars. Please tell me that the guest has dropped something, why didn't the hotel inform the guest and ask the guest to ask.

msg:The old-fashioned hotel located by the Haihe River has always wanted to experience it. This time, it was sealed outside the community and could not go back, so I could just stay in a local hotel. It's a pity that I couldn't book my favorite room during the weekend due to the epidemic. There is a restaurant and an auditorium on the first floor. There are many people at the wedding banquet, which is a little chaotic. It is comfortable to enter the room. Although it is not very big, the details are in place. The entrance hall and cloakroom have both and are not small. My favorite is the soft light that makes the whole room full of warm a**osphere. The decoration is a bit retro, and some facilities are not very new but It's very clean, the breakfast is rich in variety, tastes good, and the service is warm and thoughtful, but the museum is not open, collect the tickets and visit it after the epidemic.

It would be better if the carpets could be swept cleaner or replaced with thicker carpets. It's good to have a description at the door of the room where the celebrity lived, but the bronze medal used for the description is too ugly and unclear. It would be better if it was changed to a more innovative and intuitive way.

The original building of the hotel is well preserved, and some of the facilities that have been renovated are also original, with a strong sense of historical substitution. The room booked is not large, with English-style decoration and furniture, high ceilings and a terrace. The small episode is that the door handle of the balcony is not very easy to use, and it will be unscrewed accidentally. The water pressure of the shower in the bathroom is too high, and the curtain cannot block the water and it is easy to leave it outside. The front desk and service staff of the hotel are very professional. At this price, it is good to live in a key protected building and understand the history.

When you enter the room by elevator from Victoria Garden, it seems to enter the real and misty Republic of China life. The bathtub, the wooden floor, the study, the balcony, the bedroom, the bed curtain, all tell you about the song and dance that was once a drunken fan...
       First of all, after my friends and I arrived earlier than the check-in time, we received the meticulous and considerate service from the little brother at the front desk.
       Secondly, while waiting for the room to be cleaned, we visited the Lishunde Museum downstairs and deeply felt the turbulence that a century-old hotel has experienced. From Mr. Sun Yat-sen to Mr. Mei Lanfang, those who can only be found in People who can only be seen in history textbooks live in the same hotel as me. For people like me, they are full of happiness and joy.
       So after the normal check-in, I decided to upgrade the celebrity suite. After weighing it, I chose Jingwu Hall where Mr. Huang Xing lived, and the hotel's little fairy Yan, who thoughtfully and enthusiastically led us to choose and upgrade. Once again feel the dedication and enthusiasm of the hotel staff.
       Finally, when I walked to the balcony and looked at the sunlight through the plane trees, I could feel the historical charm of the past. The light boat has passed thousands of mountains, and the Taotao Haihe River has seen the vicissitudes of the modern century, and it also shines with the sparkling light of today's prosperous world. Perhaps only in such a hotel can you really feel the charm brought by time...

The whole hotel really has a sense of retro culture. The underground museum collects many things used by celebrities, and it is very interesting to stroll around. However, I personally think that if you come to the museum specially, the experience may not be so amazing, but if you stay in a hotel, you will visit the museum and think that you have stayed in the same hotel with so many historical figures, and the experience is still great.

Service: We arrived at the hotel after four o'clock in the afternoon, but the room was not ready, and we waited for more than half an hour to check in, which made me very unhappy

Transportation: It's very close to the train station. It's convenient to take a taxi or subway. Nearby is the Fifth Avenue, which is very suitable for hanging out. The traffic location is very convenient.


Environment: There is a sense of age, I feel that I will become a wealthy lady of the Republic of China when I live in it üåö
But because the hotel is still relatively old, the facilities are not as convenient as modern hotels, the refrigerator is not cold enough, the toilet flushing is also problematic, and the room is still crowded
Overall, if you want to feel the historical a**osphere, it's good to live once and feel it.

I stayed in the Victoria Suite two times before. This time the child said that he wanted to live in a balcony room. The large terrace is really special. Well, the child likes it very much. The room number is 226. Next to it is the Sun Yat-sen suite. I experienced afternoon tea. The desserts are not very sweet, which suits my taste. It has its own museum, which can be visited for free when staying, wooden stairs and old-fashioned elevators. It has a sense of age. Opposite the hotel is the Lishunde Pier. You can walk around the Haihe River at night. The only disadvantage of the old building is that the sewer pipes may be in disrepair for a long time. A hotel with historical and cultural characteristics, I hope to have the opportunity to bring children together next time.

Two times with colleagues, they were treated differently. The health code and itinerary card were checked. Do you live here? Do you have a room card? Colleagues did not ask anything, and felt severely insulted and treated differently. Just because I am a young woman, I seriously doubt that the hotel does provide special services to customers directly or indirectly? Spent 1000+ nights in the hotel, even if the facilities are bad and old, this kind of service attitude has never been encountered in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. I am sorry to stay in this hotel.

The overall environment is good, but the service attitude, I dare not go anyway. After all, I have been discriminated against...

The next day I asked to change a suite with a wooden balcony. Due to the heavy snow, I applied for an extension of check-out and left at 2 pm. Early breakfast is more abundant. If you are recommended by friends from other places to try their pancakes, it is quite authentic. Don't worry about the rice dish, it tastes like lo mein hahaha. The service is very good, I left the room card for us as a souvenir before leaving. The bed was comfortable, the quality of sleep was super good, the soundproofing was good, there was no sound in the house because of such heavy rain, such heavy snow, and such strong wind.

It is the only luxury hotel in China with an exclusive museum. Its glorious history makes Lishunde the oldest hotel in China, and it is well-known at home and abroad as the first store in China. The legendary Peace Hotel in Shanghai, the Beijing Hotel, one of the top three in Beijing, and Tianjin Lishunde, the oldest hotel in China, are known as "the paradise of Chinese luxury hotels." The experience of staying in is very good. First of all, the transportation is very convenient, and it is convenient to travel. The second is by the Haihe River, with good views, the third room is spacious, comfortable bedding, and complete and advanced facilities. The fourth breakfast is rich in Chinese and Western fusion.

In the new building for more than 800 nights, the room is very large and the windows are facing the Haihe River. That day, there was a wedding for the newlyweds on the first floor, and it felt great that the band played live in the lobby!

üèõLocation-Within 3 kilometers of Tianjin Station, the taxi fare can be reached in about 10 minutes, and you can also walk around and watch the street view and old houses! (You can go to the Tianjin Post Museum along the way), because it is far from the commercial street to take a taxi to the ancient culture street at 20, and the environment is relatively quiet. There are restaurants around, not far from the Five Avenues, ride a bike and stroll around, it's great to film! There is a parking lot at the front entrance of the hotel, making it easy to call a car by car.
üçµBreakfast-pancakes, garba dishes, Chinese and Western collocation, can satisfy the elderly and children who want to eat hot food. The dishes are not particularly exquisite, but it's okay to eat well! The service was cleaned up in a timely manner, but I found that the placemats are generally not changed, and I feel that it is necessary to improve.
üõèI have nothing to say about the internal environment of the hotel! An immersive experience in the style of the Republic of China! The ventilation effect of the toilet in the old building is not particularly good! The rooms in the old building and the corridor are not very soundproof, but fortunately, the guests are relatively quiet. TV channel 1 introduces the history of the hotel, it is worth watching!
üì∑If you like to take pictures, you can bring more clothes!

msg:There are many good hotels in Tianjin, but not every store has a century-old history. Li Shunde has almost witnessed the entire modern history of Tianjin. Pu Yi, Zhou Enlai, Mei Lanfang, Cai E, Yuan Shikai, and U.S. President Hoover have all stayed in, so It is indeed a special feeling to experience the room in the old building. The room is beyond imagination. The furnishings, oil paintings on the walls, and wooden stairs are full of the Republic of China style, as if you are in an old movie. , It's really great, the only flaw is that the shower door design is not sealed, and the water will leak out in the bath.

msg:The hotel breakfast is very rich and the service staff is in place. I live in an old building, well-preserved and well-decorated. The TV in the room has a documentary about the hotel, which is very nice to watch. There is a small introduction sign at the entrance of the celebrity suite, which is very interesting and makes people want to check it out. The bad thing about the staying experience this time is that the faucet in the bathroom is too difficult to use. It takes a lot of effort to pull it to the hot water position, and the temperature cannot be fine-tuned. There is a cool facility "mirror TV" in the bathroom, but unfortunately there is no signal and I can't enjoy it.

msg:The old building really feels like the Victorian twin room with the kids. It‚Äôs pretty good. The room is quite big. I‚Äôm not satisfied that the bath water is a bit small. The room temperature doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to be adjusted.

msg:A hotel with a sense of age, the rooms are spacious, clean and hygienic, and the service is very good. The waiter enthusiastically took me to the room. There is also a small museum in the hotel. On the Dragon Boat Festival, I saw a dragon boat race opposite the hotel. It was a good experience.

msg:Historic buildings, Republican style, modern five-star hotel, well-deserved reputation. Upgrade the Tan Kah Kee celebrity room to enjoy the early summer style. The view outside the window is invincible. In fact, the stay is good, the breakfast is good, it has the taste of Tianjin, and the western food is so authentic, enjoy!

msg:It was a pleasure to stay in Tianjin Lishunde on the anniversary. The hotel also gave me a room with a balcony, but there is one thing I can't forget. I accidentally left a small mulberry silk shirt in the room when I left. I was very sure that it was left in the room, but I called afterwards but couldn't find it. Such a thing really shouldn't happen in such a big hotel. No reputation, will not go again, and do not recommend staying. It's too unsafe.

msg:Very distinctive historical building, the old building has a great a**osphere, it looks like a ship with portholes and many chimneys on the wall...the turnstiles, stairs, and chandeliers are all beautiful, and I saw a lot of antiques in museums, silver ones The keys do represent an era.
I live in a new building, the room doesn't look big, but the bathroom is really huge, a deluxe version. The walk-in cloakroom and tea room are well separated. The bed is very big and comfortable, and the accessories are complete. The room is clean and tidy, but the air conditioner is a bit loud.
The surrounding area is relatively quiet, the streets are full of high-end buildings, it is very comfortable to walk casually, the Haihe River is also very suitable for walking, and it is very cool in the evening. It is also very convenient to go to the city. It is within walking distance from the Fifth Avenue and the train station.
There is no meal included, but the Victoria Garden Cafe in the lobby is very comfortable, the light is great, and the colors are very eye-catching. Both cafes and museums sell cute ice cream.
