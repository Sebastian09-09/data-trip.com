But here are a few things that raised the hotel experience above ordinary:

🌟 Easy and swift check-in process, even for a foreigner. Front desk staff also spoke some English. So if you're a foreigner, don't hesitate to choose this hotel 😊
🌟 Free mini-bar in the room, and free refreshments in the lobby lounge 24 hrs a day - snacks, coffees and soft drinks around the clock, and also wine available in the afternoon
🌟 You can order this cute robot to deliver some snacks and small travel items directly to your door! The robot called the room phone when it arrived, was easy to use, and just super cute 😂 Totally recommend!

All in all, really liked it, and will stay here again if I have the chance.

No deposit regulation whatsoever, and their lounge will give you free food and snacks, starting at 10 PM. The gym is small but good enough to have daily exercises. However, there is no pool at the hotel. 
Overall, I would love to recommend this hotel to my friends and family. Will surely revisit this hotel next time.

The foreigner asked me why the hotel changed its name this time: Is it for business reasons?
I said it should be for upgrading reasons, for higher-level development!
After checking in, I felt it was right, definitely optimized and upgraded!
The breakfast is great! There are two levels of greatness: 1) There are a wide variety of items suitable for all kinds of people 2) The breakfast is really changed every day, which is definitely a blessing for guests!
The hotel is in a good location, but my partner and I are attending the Canton Fair and have a busy schedule.
Next time I come, I must take a good walk around the surrounding area

This time, the front desk upgraded me to a suite, thank you very much. The suite is very large and spacious, and the hygiene is good. At least there is no dust in sight. The children can have fun in the room, and there is a tea table, which is very convenient for ordering takeout. The only shortcoming is that the sewer smell in the shower room and bathtub is too strong, and the engineers came up to repair it but it did not improve it. I hope this problem can be solved.
The hotel also prepared slippers and toothbrush sets for children, which the children like very much.
The breakfast is standard, and there are fewer afternoon tea categories. The hotel has free parking, and the parking lot is right next to the main entrance of the hotel, which is very convenient to drive.
Several front desk staff are very enthusiastic. I only remember one Yove, and I don’t remember the names of the others.

She doesn't even raise her face to look at the customer when checking out, let alone look at her! It may be that the hotel training is not in place, it is a bit unusual in the Pearl River Delta. When taking a shower, the water from the shower head is extremely small and cannot be washed at all. It will be repaired later. I'm a little scared to come next time.

msg:On February 5, 2024, I stayed at Guangzhou Huaxuan Meilun Hotel on a business trip. I stepped on glass shards with my bare feet while taking a shower in the bathroom that night, causing a deep wound and continuous bleeding. I asked for personal injury compensation to the individual, and the hotel's handling attitude showed the arrogance and inaction of the large chain group Huazhu Club. 1. The hotel refused to pay me personal compensation. 2. After the accident, they never contacted me to discuss how to deal with the accident before or after I left the hotel. When I contacted the hotel, the hotel said that the manager was not in the hotel. He called me back later. After waiting in the lobby for half an hour, there was no feedback. After I left the hotel due to work schedule, I never received a call from the hotel for feedback. When I called again, I deliberately did not answer the phone. 3. After I complained to the 12315 platform, the hotel Fang Huazhu Group also The relevant law enforcement agencies argued that they could not prove that glass shards were present in the room. The presence of glass shards in the bathroom is already a major cleaning mistake made by hotel management, and the hotel avoids and does nothing. As such a large hotel group, it later lied to 12315 that it could not prove that glass shards were in the room.

We also got free access to the executive lounge for two days and afternoon tea for two people. We were half an hour late and we were allowed to enter the venue. The front desk service is excellent and impeccable. ￼

The best thing about the hotel is the location. It takes less than 5 minutes to walk to Huachenghui and Huacheng Square. While staying at the hotel, we walked to nearby check-in points such as Xiaomanyao and Haixinsha many times. The transportation is very convenient, and the subway station is nearby.

But the floor is not high. The best place to overlook the night view of Zhujiang New Town or the night view of Xiaomanyao is the upper floor of Four Seasons Hotel. The night view from the hotel room is average.

4. The staff in the lobby who help with check-in and check-out have a very good service attitude.
5. I accidentally discovered that the restaurant (Huachengyuan) next to the lobby is delicious and convenient.

shortcoming:
1. There is no sign at the entrance on the first floor. I almost couldn’t find it when I took a taxi nearby. I asked the security guard at the entrance and found out that the lobby is on the fifth floor.
2. The water pressure of the bathroom shower is not enough, the water is not big enough, and the bath is not comfortable enough. The hot water adjus**ent is a bit complicated, which made me confused at first.
3. The TV remote control is not sensitive and difficult to press.

msg:This is the first time I have given a negative review on Ctrip in so many years. My stay experience can be described as horrible!
I came to Guangzhou to attend a conference and specially booked the Grand Mercure Hotel on December 17.
Checked in at ten o'clock in the evening. The lady at the front desk arranged room 1027. I was very happy to check in.
Why give one point

First: The hotel facilities and equipment are poor. On the scale, a 160-pound man weighed more than 80 pounds. This was considered a joke. Later, I looked at the emergency flashlights that were completely out of power, which shows that the hotel operators have no regard for the quality of operations. and equipment maintenance.
The second thing is the sound insulation that is the most embarrassing. The sound insulation of the room on my floor is really unbearable. It is basically the same as a face-to-face meeting in the company. At 4 o'clock in the morning, a large group of people next door (at least three men and one woman) were playing and playing wildly. At first I was woken up and thought someone had broken into my room. Later I found out that it was the room next door. The sound was so loud that it could be described as deafening. At first I thought It got better after a while, and I endured it for an hour without any reduction. However, at 5 o'clock, the sound became louder and louder, so I called the front desk to complain. The lady at the front desk politely replied that they had reminded guests to keep their voices down but they had no right to stop it! Those little cuties kept making noisy noises until they checked out at around six o'clock, and they couldn't sleep anymore, which seriously affected the next day's itinerary.
I thought about three points. First, why can four or five people enter a room? Has the hotel done its due diligence and registered one by one? How is the safety and privacy of other hotel guests ensured? Second, when encountering such a special situation, at least there is a security guard who politely reminds the other party, but the result is only a phone call. Is it because the hotel has omitted the security guard to save costs? Third, the operator knows that there are big problems with sound insulation. Does the hotel have an emergency plan when encountering such a situation? ? After thinking about it over and over again, I think that the management ability of the general manager of this Grand Mercure is really mediocre. I have experienced most of the five-diamond hotels in Guangzhou. This check-in completely reflects that the hotel is extremely lacking in high-quality operation and management. It deserves more. Not worthy of the Five Diamond title!
Because of a failed experience, a consumer was so disappointed in an Accor Grand Mercure that he would never stay again!

Finally, I would like to thank Rose Song at the front desk, who apologized after learning about my experience, which made me feel a little comfort in the thick cold.

It was very cold in Guangzhou in December, and the check-in experience was even more chilling. The trip was originally pleasant, but an unreliable hotel and unreliable management added another layer of haze!

One of the reasons why I still chose this hotel this time is that the bathroom has three separated dry and wet spaces. It is very convenient to use, and each functional area does not affect each other. In addition, the hotel's service is as comfortable as ever. Especially Eric's service attitude is impeccable, crisp and polite. When I first checked in on the first day, I wanted to change rooms. The hotel arranged for two staff to show the room. Eric's attitude made me feel comfortable. I like it~
The only drawback is that the executive lounge is being renovated, which is not a coincidence.
Will stay again if there is a chance in the future

msg:Location: The location is very good, next to Huachenghui, very convenient! ! I will choose this hotel next time I come.

Service: The service is super good. Jennie upgraded our room type and gave us coupons for afternoon tea and evening tea. The service staff were all handsome men and beautiful women. When ordering takeout, call the front desk and a robot will deliver it to you.

Hygiene: clean and hygienic, smart toilet, super big bed, I like it very much!

Disadvantage: The Internet in our room is not good 😭 cannot cast the screen, but the public network is not bad.

msg:1. The location is very good, it is definitely in the center of Guangzhou, you can see PWC; it is super close to Xiaomanyao, you can see it when you get out of the subway station; 2. When you arrive at night, the front desk will give you a coupon for the executive lounge, so you can sit down and rest, Have something to eat 😄 The syrup in the lounge is very authentic, and the fruit is also very rich; 3. When I checked out, I caught up with the heavy rain in the scenic area. After returning to the hotel, I would like to thank the hotel lady @Jennie for being very considerate and warm-hearted to help apply for a late check-out. You can tidy yourself up in the hotel and avoid embarrassment~ This is a perfect ending to this short trip in Guangzhou💗

Because I was in a hurry and didn't have time to experience the gym, when I passed by, I felt that the facilities were quite new and should be pretty good. Because I have to do business at the consulate the next day, I went to the front desk in the early morning to print documents. Allan's service was very thoughtful and meticulous.

The service consciousness of the doorman at around 1:00 noon on the 17th was a bit poor. He neither offered to help with the luggage, nor greeted me when I entered the door.

msg:As a long-term member of Huazhu and a long-term business travel customer of Ctrip Business Travel, this is the first time I complain about a hotel of this level. I feel uncomfortable in the morning. I don’t want to have breakfast in the restaurant. I want to choose some to take back to the room. I was told: I can’t take it by myself, "There are regulations ", I gave two eggs, two boxes of yogurt, and some fruit bread. The manager's tone was undeniable; I opened my eyes, and it's not as good as an ordinary plane meal. There is no hot food, but the money is not less. A breakfast is more than 100 ;This typical behavior of putting "hotel regulations" before "reasonable demands of customers" is a precursor to going downhill; the hotel is nothing more than worrying that if I take it myself, they will empty out their entire kitchen, and then there will be ten hungry people hidden in the room. Let's hold a party together with Han; not to mention how unlikely this possibility is, the solution to this problem can be very simple: give a fixed-sized packing box, and take as much as you can, which is what other hotels do. It was not eaten and closed down. Won't be coming back, can't enjoy the "rules" here.

When I checked in in the afternoon, I told the front desk that the air conditioner was not cool. I called someone to measure the temperature and the wind was 18 degrees. It would gradually cool down, but then nothing happened. It only dropped 2 degrees Celsius until check-out at noon the next day. This hotel is always blacklisted. The design of the shower room and cloakroom is also weird, and the position of the light switch is also weird. Blacklisted forever!

You can reach Huacheng Square just across two roads. We recommend that tourists who want to take a night tour on the Pearl River can directly buy the ferry ticket to the Haixinsha West District Pier. It is very convenient to stay in this hotel. One-stop solution for all your needs. The hotel also offers free afternoon tea and evening wine. Breakfast is also good and very cost-effective. Hotel staff will help pick up takeaways, which will be delivered by robots. I also gave the children gifts when I checked in. It was a very satisfying stay.

msg:I thought the location of the hotel was very good. After all, it is in the CBD area of the central axis of Guangzhou, the subway station is convenient, and the service is very nice. I went to the hotel to taste their afternoon tea. The mattress is also very comfortable, with moderate hardness, but at night From one o'clock in the morning, a bunch of taxis started to honk their horns downstairs, and the noise continued until four o'clock in the morning. It was a torment for people with poor sleep quality. It refreshed my understanding of Guangzhou CBD and Guangzhou taxi industry. Yes, I have stayed in a hotel in this area in Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen before. It was the first time I found such noise. I called the front desk and they also complained and called the police many times. However, it was still noisy. It is said that it is not an occasional situation. If It’s like this every night. It’s really tormenting the guests. It’s really speechless to spend one or two thousand to suffer. Although the hotel has made soundproof glass, the sound of the horns keeps coming and going. It lasts for about three hours. I’m afraid People who are noisy are cautious. If you don’t target this hotel, the nearby Hyatt may not escape bad luck. I really don’t know why there is no relevant depar**ent in charge, which affects the image of Guangzhou’s civilized city

It's definitely not a five-star photo. It's only ¥200 different from the Grand Hyatt opposite, but the quality is completely different. The mattress is very uncomfortable! The sound insulation is very poor, and I can hear the sound of sewers all night long, which makes it difficult to have a good rest! I was deceived by xhs! The price-performance ratio of this grade Atour is better and better. Otherwise, you can just pay an extra ¥200 and go to the Grand Hyatt opposite, which is a five-star. This 4-star is too much.

msg:The decoration style is good and the hygiene is OK, but I still have to complain about the following three issues:
1. Sound insulation! I can hear every little sound in the corridor clearly, just like sleeping with the door open all night; I live on the executive floor, and the sound of flushing in the apar**ent above is very clear.
2. Air conditioning! No matter how high the wind speed you turn on, how low the temperature is, or how long it stays out, it will never go below 25.5 degrees when there is no one in the room, and it will never go below 26.2 degrees when there is someone in the room. (Last night, I seriously suspected that there was a rat in the air outlet. The engineering staff checked and said there was no problem. They suggested changing the room. It was really scary in the middle of the night. The front desk didn’t even bother to say hello...as if nothing happened)
3. Breakfast! If you can tolerate the first two, I can only give you a friendly reminder not to book a breakfast room! Breakfast is cooperated with the hotel. It belongs to the service area. The food is extremely unpalatable. You can imagine how the restaurant's dinner will taste... When the meal is collected, the sound of all the tableware is used to tell you that you can leave.
There is a Starbucks downstairs, so you can choose at your own discretion. In addition, the large number of positive comments from the staff in the reviews also make people doubt that the implementation of services is fundamental.

msg:After reading a lot, I finally decided to live in this hotel. The hotel is near Zhuhai New City, not far from the Li subway exit. The Huacheng Plaza is downstairs. The facade is not obvious. It is opposite a Starbucks. The front desk is on the fifth floor. I need to change the elevator, but I can't. trouble. I was a little worried after reading many reviews, but after checking in, I found that the overall environment is quiet, clean and tidy. The staff at the front desk, the waiters in the restaurant and the cleaning lady are very friendly and will take the initiative to help you, which is very touching. Decided to stay one more night. The room facilities are relatively new, the windows can be opened for ventilation, there is a lot of hot water, there is a coffee machine, refrigerator, ironing machine, it feels very convenient, the breakfast is also very rich, and the taste is also good, maybe it is not the peak season, the service will be relatively better.
The only downside is that because there is a road building downstairs, there is noise at night, and it will last until around 21:30. If it is repaired, it will not be so noisy.
Overall, I am very satisfied and recommend staying. The coffee in the picture is a latte made with the coffee machine in the room and the buffalo milk I bought in Shunde. The last two pictures are breakfast

msg:Bad review! Bad review! Bad review!
This is the first time I have given a negative review online. After checking in, I decisively canceled my reservation for the next day. It was too bad.
Facilities: Slightly better than a business hotel, just a typical apar**ent hotel, not worth the 1,000 yuan price.
Service: Check in at the hotel at 17:44 and reserve a double room one day in advance. The front desk kept emphasizing that there were no double rooms and they had to be replaced with single rooms. After rejecting it twice, I was told that the double room had not been cleaned and I had to wait for 20 minutes. What kind of logic is this? Double rooms are much more expensive than single rooms.
Environment: The hotel lobby is on the 5th floor. To get to the room, you need to go to the 5th floor and take the elevator. The hotel does not provide takeaway service. Takeout can only be delivered to the 1st floor, not the 5th floor. You can only go to the 1st floor to pick it up yourself. The hotel provides robot service, but takeaway service is completely refused.

But when I arrived at the hotel, I found that the little brother at the front desk still gave me not only the blue room type, but also the last room of the hotel. Completely against me. This is the first time I have stayed in so many hotels. I went to change the room again, and the front desk said that if I want to change the house, I need to pay for an upgrade. All right, I'll add money. Nothing else, this hotel is quite satisfied with the lighting in the room, which looks good for taking pictures, the location is prosperous and convenient, and there are many options for ordering takeaways. On the fifth floor, free snacks are provided to hotel guests throughout the day. There is also a smart toilet in the bathroom of the room. Overall is good.

This will keep a little air convection tight in the room. But the circuit design of the room is terrible! If you want to turn on the exhaust fan, the bedside light in the room cannot be turned off! In order to maintain a tight air convection, the face was illuminated by the light of the bedside lamp all night! Extremely uncomfortable and unhygienic for sleep!
      I have stayed in hotels such as Grand Hyatt, Four Seasons, W, Ritz-Carlton, Mandarin Oriental, Grandview Marriott, Sheraton, Hilton, Crowne Plaza, White Swan, Westin, InterContinental Poly, Guangzhou Garden, Nansha Garden, etc. No other 4-star hotel has ever encountered such a need to turn on the room lights to run the bathroom exhaust fan!
   There are other problems with the circuit design of this hotel room, so I don't want to dwell on it here. Not satisfied with it anyway!

1. The breakfast variety is pitiful, and the taste of cheap ingredients is mediocre
2. The service awareness is poor. When checking in and the front desk asked for dental kits to be delivered to the room, they did not send them to the customer service to urge them; the restaurant service foreman has no service awareness, and did not move after calling several times, and kept looking at his phone...
3. The gym is the smallest I have ever seen, with few equipments, not even a dragon gate...

Sometimes he even went to the corridor to smoke... The whole 8th floor was filled with the smell of cigarettes, speechless...

There was a very nice lady at the breakfast place. On the first day, she remembered that I only drank jasmine green tea. In the next two days, she prepared and served it to me without me saying anything. Such a thoughtful girl should be promoted. I hope her boss can see this comment.

msg:Book a message and want a quiet high-rise room.
As a result, rooms on the lowest floor facing the road and tunnel were arranged. Was woken up at 6 o'clock, really collapsed, and I don't know what the sound was, there was a noise similar to large-scale construction outside.
This time, the waiter at the front desk did not know whether it was a new batch or what, and the service attitude was very poor. Did not take the initiative to help guests check in. I wanted to mention that about the room, before I said it, I was already rejected and said that the room is more tense on holidays. . . Because I stayed in this hotel more than ten times before, I believed in the room that was arranged. It turned out really bad
By the way, the electronic scale in the room is out of power, and the battery is still moldy and swollen, and no one has replaced it?
will not stay again

msg:Grand Mercure Huaxuan, the service is very poor, very poor!

The first point of poor service: I booked the classic double room. But when we checked in at the front desk, a male front desk with glasses kept asking us if we would like to add 99 yuan to upgrade to a superior double room. It is said that we have only cleaned two room types. If you don't add 99 yuan to upgrade to a superior double room, the room type you have booked will be very poor, and you can only stay in a corner room. At that time, there were also many guests waiting to check in. When the front desk wearing glasses kept selling me, as a guest, should I agree to upgrade or not? This makes me very embarrassed. I don't know how the guests next to me look at me. Am I someone who is poor by 99 yuan hahahaha?

The second point is poor facilities: Can you believe that a five-star hotel's air conditioner leaks and wakes guests up? What is the experience of a person with poor sleep quality? It is estimated that at about 5 or 6 in the morning, the air conditioner first made a sound like a huge drain, and then immediately made a "bang" sound, and the water erupted to the ground. In such a quiet environment, it can scare people to death!

The third point is poor service: the front desk of a 5-star hotel has no emotional intelligence? My room was to check out at 2 pm. At about 1 pm, a female front desk called me and asked me if I would continue to stay or check out tonight (I understand this), and I replied that I would leave today. room, and then the female front desk said, "Your room is to check out at 2 o'clock, it is 1 o'clock now, it will be 2 o'clock soon!". Are you trying to drive me away? Or are you afraid that I will stay in your fake 5-star hotel?

The only problem is that the water pressure in the shower room is not enough and the water is not hot enough. Also, there are no robots to deliver food, so you have to turn the elevator to get down to the first floor, which is very troublesome.

房間香氣很舒適，也夠大。
地理位置很方便，步行2、3分鐘就是地鐵站（婦兒中心站apm線），到省博物館、廣州塔很近。
送了雙人自助下午茶，2大2小都吃好了。
還送了晚上大堂茶飲。
夜晚10點後在5樓大堂報房號就能免費享用宵夜（陳村粉、粥等）。
用了攜程積分申請了下午2:00退房權益
下次來廣州還會再住美爵。

msg:房間設施裝飾都非常完美，單獨的廁所，淋浴房，馬桶是智能的，房間寬敞明亮，窗外高樓林立。大堂服務熱情，有咖啡機可以自助操作。最大的缺點是門口標誌不明顯，走過幾次後仍然轉向找不到北，無語😓酒店沒有自己的地面大堂，要到五層辦理手續，再轉電梯到房間。酒店所在大廈叫僑鑫大廈，離地鐵3/5號線步行5分鐘（出門左轉再右轉過馬路直走到置地廣場）

畢竟是在花草密集的核心區，且樓層不算高，房間內有蚊子但還好沒影響到睡眠，早上起來才打到哈哈。

電動窗簾遮光效果非常好，對我這種亟需睡眠的人來説太重要了，衹是若遮光窗簾能設定成可控制開啟高度，那就更好了，有時候早上想開大概1/3哈哈。

有膠囊咖啡機對於我來説非常加分，傍晚或者早上來一杯，太愜意。

總體來説在珠江新城核心區就還是蠻推薦的，樓下就有很好的餐廳和酒吧，交通也便利。點贊！

但在廣州的一大堆五星級裏配套屬於非常一般的，沒有浴缸和游泳館。而且和隔壁Hyatt貼的過於近，都能互相看到房間裏的人，所以全程不敢開窗簾。
花城苑之前是黑珍珠，現在被撤掉了，嚐了一下感覺一般服務也不好，在珠江新城這一圈屬實是不夠看。

msg:1、早上11點半左右到，被告知現在要等多一小時左右才有房間，但是加100元就可以給我升級房型。升沒升級我不知道，開了兩個多小時車累死不想等就“升級”了。當然我也知道這是我自願的。但這種加價不用等的操作挺膈應人的。
2、最差勁的屬實是晚上一兩點睡着，樓下的車一直按喇叭，非常影響睡眠。可以説是根本睡不着！打了給前台，前台告知是有酒吧，基本上也向酒吧反映了無果。但前台也送了一對耳塞。 其次是睡覺時候，應該是空調的風管口有雜音。 
3、總結説實話，這個酒店不值這個價位，最讓人火大的是被樓下的車吵得睡不着覺，按喇叭持續至少一小時。

msg:床品很舒服，房間佈局好，寬敞整齊，乾濕分離，酒店位置好。但空調聲音非常大，風速調到最小還吵到睡不着覺，房間隔音效果也不好，不到早上六點走廊（或隔壁）傳來響亮的fusion音樂。最離譜的是見到好幾位工作人員，衹有房務阿姨主動微笑打招呼，別的都沒有反應，包括酒廊服務人員都需要我先出聲，我出了電梯後和前台打個照面，他一點反應也沒有，我以為這是前台的風格，結果我剛轉身去乘到一樓的電梯，他見到後面的顧客就主動問好了……
