msg:The room card can't open the gate of the swimming pool. The same card was used to enter the house in front of us. The front desk of the swimming pool received several guests who went in to buy things, but they disappeared. I called for a long time in front of the gate with my child, but no one came. The scene was really embarrassing and infuriating. When I returned to the room, I saw a chewing gum on the bedside. I immediately reported it to Ctrip and the hotel. The hotel kept saying that they would help clean it up. I think they just wanted to destroy the evidence. The hotel was asked to check these two major problems later, but the hotel was too lazy to check and just perfunctorily dealt with them. There was basically nothing to eat for breakfast. I only had a few bowls of noodles in two mornings. The hotel keeps saying that it pays attention to customer satisfaction, but the lobby manager's WeChat only perfunctorily replied one or two sentences out of ten sentences I sent. Kaiyuan Mingdu is really not worthy of its name. In June last year, I booked the Nanshan Heyuan Kaiyuan Mingdu Resort. When I arrived at the store, they gave me another room type, but I found out. I booked the Liyang Kaiyuan Mingdu Hotel on New Year's Day this year, but I was asked to check out a few days later, saying that my room was booked in advance. It was really bad. Let me ask, is the name Kaiyuan worthy of the service and price?

You can quickly answer the room phone next to the toilet and call for help. The bathroom is large, but there are no disposable slippers. It is recommended to provide disposable slippers. In addition, it is quite close to Badujie, so it is not bad to stay and play here. You can eat at the nearby Dongyu Fang

Xiao Shang, who helped me check in, was particularly enthusiastic and gave me a small souvenir. I also chose this hotel when I came to Changxing for the second time. The room space is also clean and the facilities are good. The breakfast is rich and there are some local specialties. It is definitely not worse than an international five-star hotel. Highly recommended.

You can see the north of Changxing City, many hills, Guangsha Park, and the yellow and red leaves in late autumn. It is a wonderful and comfortable environment. The location is among all hotels in Changxing. China is far ahead. The hotel environment is very good, clean and tidy, high-end yet elegant.

The lobster for dinner was not fresh. I went in late, and the roast duck, oysters and other dishes were gone, but the cost was still the same, which was not cost-effective.

msg:51假期到都和家人一起遊玩，路途中在長興開元名都大酒店入住。前台的小飛接待了我們，51假期在這個酒店住的挺好的，酒店員工服務熱情。人很多但是前台接待辦理入住有條不穩，沒有等多久。酒店入住過程很順利，房間住的舒適安逸，昨天休息設備齊全，還有游泳池，健身房。人太多可能停車不是很方便但酒店車位還是蠻多的，畢竟昨天整個都接待滿了。早餐種類豐富多樣，還送了小朋友的洗漱用品和拖鞋，很貼心

酒店地理位置也非常優越，周邊吃的也很多，去哪都方便。

雖然沒用到，但是還是很感謝小尚主動告知幫我們延遲了退房。我們離開時候還送了小麪包在路上吃。
孩子玩具小熊落在酒店，然後工作人員幫忙找到，放到袋子裏，同時在袋子裏面放了兩瓶礦泉水，真的很貼心了。
整體還是很不錯的，有機會會帶家人再過來♥️

衞生：乾淨
環境：一級棒
服務：前台服務非常好，主動升級，還特地送了城山溝的門票，有求必應。但三月底突然升温，房間裏晚上熱得出汗，就是開不出空調，服務人員也沒辦法。幾年前在慈溪開元也遇到過，看來是集團的管理問題。
