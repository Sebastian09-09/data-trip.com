msg:Good location near the entrance of Gubei Water Town. Bought the hotel package with breakfast and complimentary tickets to hot spring and ticket entrance to Gubei town. 
Beautiful room with good choices of breakfast. Swimming pool looks good but the ladies shower head and sprinkler needs to be repaired and have shower curtain for more privacy. There should be an attendant in locker room to assist in sauna, jacuzzi and heater room. There is only one hair dryer. In addition there is no lifeguard nor anyone to tell that the swimming tube needs to pay rmb 20 each (I can't read Chinese) even though a man that appeared suddenly from nowhere at swimming pool told me much later about it. Overall, it's a good experience.

msg:Very nice hotel, very clean rooms, and well appointed. The staff were lovely and had translator devices at hand for English speakers. For westerners, what‚Äôs not explained in the hotel description. is that while this hotel is outside the ‚Äòscenic area ‚Äô, it‚Äôs a two minute walk to the front entrance. And my advise is while room check in is at 3pm once you arrive go check in, as while they may not be able to give you your room keys they will add you to the facial recognition ticketing system which means you can come and go to the scenic area as many times as you wish. If you, like me, arrive early thinking it‚Äôs too early to check in and buy a ticket at the counter, you can only go in once, and once your out, your out, unless you pay again. Hope this helps people. Also the hotel pool is massive., the outside pool seems to be not in use. And also bring a swim cap, or buy one at the pool reception.

The breakfast is acceptable even if old bread was served. If you like mazes you will have fun by finding the pool. Unfortunately we had to buy the most expensive bathing caps in our life. The outdoor pool is closed at 7pm without any information about the opening hours. The guests have to use the indoor pool instead until 10pm. Especially in Covid times not comprehensible.

The price of this hotel is much too high related to the quality and the service. We cannot not recommend this hotel.

The hotel breakfast is also very good, very rich, and there are many options.
The only drawback is that it is too far from the guest room to the swimming pool, just like walking in a maze~

At the same time, it eliminates the trouble of walking with luggage in the parking lot. It goes all the way to the hotel parking lot, equipped with underground garages and charging piles.
Service. When handling the room card, the lobby manager Zhang Yizhuo was professional and sincere. The initial room was not satisfactory and he personally accompanied the room to change. After returning from the water town, I wanted to buy cakes in the lobby. Manager Zhang saw it and gave me one for free, so I also left a message here to express my gratitude.
Facilities. Booking a room will give you hot spring tickets, double breakfast, and unlimited tickets for two people. It is cost-effective. At the same time, the hotel is equipped with banquet halls, conference rooms, indoor gardens, gyms, swimming pools and other supporting facilities. At the same time, after entering the face, you can enter and exit the scenic area 24 hours a day with a room card, and there is a 24-hour free shuttle service. I will come here in the future.

As soon as I placed the order, the hotel lobby manager Li Sijia called and reminded us that the weather in the water town was relatively cool recently, so we should bring more clothes. Fortunately, with the reminder of Manager Li Sijia, the weather was very cold and we brought enough clothes. Thank you ^_^
After arriving at the hotel, as soon as I entered the door, I saw a table of green rockery at the main entrance of the hotel, and I was in a good mood immediately.
Front desk: The little sister-in-law who checked in at the front desk was very enthusiastic and gave us a detailed introduction to the attractions in the scenic area and the hot spring reservation
Guest room: Excellent hygiene standards, the carpet was very clean, and the service efficiency of the guest room was very fast. I asked for 1 children's slippers by phone, and it was delivered in less than 2 minutes. Less than two minutes! It was really god-like efficiency! The room arranged a standard room with a view for us. Standing on the balcony of the room, the water town and the Great Wall were unobstructed, which was worth the trip! !
Breakfast: Abnormally rich, old Beijing snacks, multi-grain pancakes, duck blood vermicelli, etc., fully meet the standards of a five-star hotel.
Lunch: At noon, we chose the Chinese restaurant on the 5th floor of the hotel. The front desk gave us a coupon. The two of us ate more than 300 yuan, and we got a discount of 60 yuan. ^_^ Ha, Juhuasuan, the dishes tasted very good!
Small details: What touched me even more was Miss Li Sijia. Because I caught a cold, she actually prepared ginger tea for me to drive away the cold. I was so touched. After drinking the ginger tea, I immediately felt warm and my body felt much better.
In short, everything is so excellent. Water Town Hotel is my first choice when I come to Gubei Water Town in the future. I hope the hotel will get better and better!

I bought a parent-child package, which includes the Children's Playhouse, hot springs, and Simatai Great Wall. I chose to stay on Monday when there were fewer people. The Children's Playhouse was equivalent to a private room. The kids had a great time. The hot springs were also very good, with many indoor and outdoor pools. The hotel service was very good. Knowing that there were kids staying, they put two single beds together to make a super wide bed of 2.7 meters, which was great! The food in the Chinese restaurant was also very good! I will go there next time!

When I checked in, the front desk upgraded my room to an executive suite. The room is spacious and bright, with two balconies and two bathrooms. The room is luxuriously decorated, clean and hygienic. Everything you see is shining, reflecting the style of a five-star hotel. It will still be my first choice when I come again in the future!

msg:The hotel has complete facilities and considerate service. The reserved superior double room was temporarily upgraded to a deluxe king suite upon check-in. The breakfast variety was also very rich. However, the price of the Western restaurant on the first floor was on the high side. The Chinese restaurant on the fifth floor closed early and was closed at night. I didn‚Äôt catch up when I got back from the tour, and the price is unknown.
The hotel is very close to the water town. It's easy to get in and out by swiping your face, and there are many shuttle buses. Since there are very few tourists during the off-season, cruise ships don't operate. Only one hot spring is open, and many stores are closed. We went to a snack street for lunch, and the prices were pretty good. The same goes for drinking coffee at the top of the mountain. In the evening, I watched a water dance show and Kongming's lantern show which were pretty good. The next morning, I took the free ticket from Shadian to tour the Simatai Great Wall. It cost another 200 yuan per person to go to and from the ropeway. The price for a one-way trip of about 5 minutes is really high! After leaving the hotel, you have to pay a parking fee of 25 yuan when you exit the highway gate outside the scenic area. In short, the cost of food, accommodation and entertainment here is relatively high. If the weather is windy and bad, it will be even worse. The aerial performance in the evening may be cancelled. I personally think that ordinary working-class people should be cautious when visiting here based on their spending power. consider!

The hotel basically has luxury hardware conditions, the overall design style is calm and grand, the hotel lobby has a high floor, the rooms are large, and the beds are made of soft materials.
The entire ancient town feels antique, with a unified overall style and full of traditional folk aesthetics. The drone performance at night has been going on for many years, showing the charm of technology in the winter night sky.

Because I checked in on a Sunday, the front desk took the initiative to upgrade my room type and checked into a Great Wall view room. Picture 2Ô∏è‚É£ shows the Simatai Great Wall seen from the room. The service attitude of the hotel staff was very kind and made me feel like a family. The hotel breakfast is great! The hotel is very convenient to get in and out of Water Town. If I come back next time, Water Town Hotel will still be my best choice!

It was very convenient to book a hot spring sap using the mini program. Check-out was also very fast. Great service. Very nice and kind. They even upgraded us to a suite, which made our trip a little more happy. We received Ping An fruit when we came back from the soup on Chris**as Eve. It was super warm. The breakfast was also rich and the ramen was delicious! Pancake fruit is delicious! Overall, I am very satisfied. I will choose Shuizhen Hotel again when I come here in the future. It is quiet at night and it is very convenient to go to Shuizhen. I strongly recommend this hotel! !

Not only was Santa Claus in the restaurant, Santa Claus also delivered Chris**as gifts to every room where guests stayed. What a surprise!
When we checked in, the front desk upgraded our room type. Now from the balcony of the room, we can see the scenery of the ancient town and the Simatai Great Wall in the distance. At night, we can not only see the lights of the scenic spot, but also the drones. Performing light show. very happy! Will go again!

It's been the coldest few days after the snow this year. It's super warm inside, so just wear short sleeves.

Service: Like Miss Zhang Yali! It was so considerate and sweet. He took the initiative to contact us in advance on the day of check-in. After arriving, he assisted us in the check-in procedure and sent it to the room. He also helped prepare the children's utensils. These little slippers are too cute.

Breakfast has both Chinese and Western options, and the meal time lasts until 10 o'clock, which is very friendly to those who have difficulty getting up in winter.

Come back when the weather gets warmer!

The key is that the hotel's managers and staff do not have a positive attitude to solve the problem. They just delay it if they can, and they have an attitude that it has nothing to do with them.
Serious bad review!

Could you please be careful and order a few more fruits? They don‚Äôt prepare some children‚Äôs medicines. Even if they prepare some commonly used medicines, there is also a swimming pool. I take my children to swim. I opened the door for ventilation. I already reminded to close it but ignored it. Then I thought about dry steaming and wet steaming. Both of them were furnished and could not be used, which completely affected my experience. There was also a child who wanted to eat a banana. I contacted the front desk three times but couldn't solve it. The restaurant didn't answer the phone at noon, and I ordered a fruit plate myself. They told me that the fruit plate would be delivered to the room at ten o'clock in the evening and asked me to go to the restaurant to eat the fruit plate. I wonder if the service should be optimized. We chose your hotel and we just enjoy our vacation. To experience the service, what services did you provide to the guests? I will have another comment later.

The hotel room package is very awesome, and it also comes with hot spring tickets and water town tickets. You can enter and leave the water town twice in two days, and you can basically visit all the places you can visit.
We ate directly at the hotel's Chinese restaurant in the evening. The portions were large and the taste was very good. I was full...
Special thanks to the handsome guy and girl at the front desk. Check-in was very smooth. Because our children are older, we were upgraded to a room with more space. The child is reluctant to leave and insists on staying for two more days, but he has no choice but to go to school. He may come back if he has the opportunity in the future.
In fact, this is my second time to come to Shuizhen. The last time was seven years ago, and I also stayed at the Shuizhen Hotel. Although the decoration style is traditional, all the hardware is very high-end, and the service is especially warm.

The hotel does not provide parking coupons when checking out. There are only two small bottles of mineral water in one room. When calling customer service to ask for water, It took four phone calls before it was delivered. They also explained a lot of reasons, saying that the customer service staff had gone to eat. The breakfast varieties were similar to those of ordinary three- and four-star buffet breakfasts. I checked in in the middle of the week and went through the formalities at 11 o'clock in the morning, but nothing happened. The room was vacant. After two urgings, the room was adjusted. That's about it.

The water town tickets you get when you check in are a great deal, so you can come in and out multiple times.

The hotel check-in front desk staff üë©üíº provided enthusiastic service. Because they were afraid that we would not be able to come back in time, check-out was delayed for an hour.

Moreover, the tickets and hot spring tickets included in the hotel are quite worthwhile. In addition, the breakfast is also worth mentioning. The whole family is very satisfied with it. There are many varieties, and there are also mutton soup pancakes and tofu curd. It makes me feel very friendly as I often go to the south for business trips and stay in hotels.

The package includes Gubei Water Town tickets (unlimited entry and exit for two people to the ancient town, free tour bus rides, and hot spring experience coupons for two people), which is economical and affordable. Very suitable for my needs. We chose Gubei Water Town Hotel for accommodation. The hotel is outside the ancient town, 50 meters away from the entrance of the ancient town. It is very convenient to enter and exit the ancient town. When we checked in, the hotel manager surnamed Wang (female) upgraded our room to a room where we could see the water town and the Simatai Great Wall in the distance. The night view was even more beautiful! Thank you to the hotel for your sincerity! The hotel lobby is bright, with a swimming pool and gym. The rooms are clean and tidy. The breakfast buffet is rich, with both Chinese and Western food. The freshly ground coffee is very good! The waiters proactively and enthusiastically greet guests during meetings, which shows that the hotel management is in place! We arranged to go to Yuda Hot Spring (please bring a swimsuit). The environment and service are very good. There is also an open-air hot spring. I enjoyed soaking in the hot spring and watched the Simatai Great Wall at night (the Great Wall is lit up). The small bridges and flowing water in the ancient town are quaint, and the half-red autumn leaves are beautiful. Drones, water show dances, acrobatics, opera flash mobs and other performances are all free to watch. Thanks to the Ctrip platform and Gubei Water Town Hotel for making our trip very enjoyable!

Service: OK, not that homely feeling, slightly attitude
Affinity

The only thing I want to complain about is that the location of the hotel room floors is too chaotic. It's like walking in a maze, going around and around. It's easy to find the room without looking carefully at the road signs.

The hotel balcony is a great location to watch the drone show

Also, the room is not very soundproof, you can always hear the sound of the door opening and closing next door.

msg:I stayed for two nights from October 5 to October 7. First of all, the hotel is not in the scenic area, but it is very close to the tourist service center, about 200 meters.
Another special feeling is that you must try to live in high-rise ‚ùó high-rise ‚ùó high-rise ‚ùó try to live in standard rooms or suites. The king-size bed rooms are located in the corner, far away from the elevator. The entire hotel is in the shape of a "back-to-back", with the elevator in the middle. If you live on either side, you have to walk a long way to get to your room. Walking around the water town every day is very tiring, so you need a nearby room!
We stayed in a 2-story double room on the first day. I didn't take any pictures because there was no experience at all and there was no scenery. It took almost 10 minutes to walk from the lobby to the room, which was so tiring!
The next day, I went directly to the front desk and asked to adjust to a room with a view near the elevator. The hotel's service attitude was very good‚ùóvery, very good‚ùóThe front desk was very attentive in helping me choose a room. According to my request, I chose the 9th floor, and then all the rooms close to the elevator were It was a standard room because it was inconvenient for us to have children, so we upgraded to a suite. The room was literally just around the corner from the elevator. The room has one bedroom, one living room, and two bathrooms. There are doors between the living room and the bedroom, and there is a balcony. The space is large and convenient. ‚ùóThe main point is that you can see the drone show in the room‚ùóIt is very suitable for lazy people like me. It is great to watch it leisurely in the room.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs food and beverages:
The hotel breakfast has quite a variety of Chinese and Western food. There are more types of Chinese food, such as boiled noodles, pimple soup, fried liver, pancakes, stir-fries, pastries, etc. Generally speaking, coffee, milk, cheese, bread, salad, and fruits are also available. Personally I think it‚Äôs enough
There is also a buffet for lunch, and it is very cost-effective when there are activities. There is no charge for 298 for two children. There are many kinds of fried seafood, spicy hotpot, and barbecue (I was too tired at lunch to take pictures [sweat])
Comparatively speaking, dinner was a bit expensive with only a la carte, so I went to check it out. The dumplings were priced at 88 yuan for 25 pieces, which was a bit unacceptable, so I didn‚Äôt eat them. I suggest that dinner can be more friendly to the people.

It takes about 7-10 minutes to walk to the entrance of the scenic spot. We booked the night view of the Great Wall and it was beautiful at night.
Environment: The lobby is very big, breakfast is on the first floor, the swimming pool is very nice, the room size is not very big, after all, it is not a new hotel, the equipment is a bit old, (bedside tables, wardrobes, doors, windows, desks, etc.) The price of nearly 2,000 is a bit Shabby, could be improved.
Service: The answers to questions and answers are very detailed. There is luggage storage in the lobby, which is very convenient. The items that can be used when traveling are also clearly explained, which is great.
Catering: Because I only had breakfast on the first floor, I only talked about breakfast. It was quite satisfactory and nothing special. There were slightly fewer types than hotels in the same price range. Breakfast can be packed into the room to eat. The disadvantage is that you cannot choose the food you take away. You can bring the hotel's packaged breakfast, which consists of a small pancake, three breads, two sausages, an egg, and a banana. It's not very user-friendly. You can choose by yourself, but there are more choices, which can be improved.

It‚Äôs rich and the venue is large, but there are too many people, and there are also many people when dining during the off-peak period. After all, it‚Äôs understandable during the National Day holiday, and I hope to do better.

Parking is available at the hotel, and you can directly scan your face when checking in. You can also scan your face in conjunction with the scenic spot. There is a swimming pool on the 7th floor, which is clean and spacious. You can see the drone show in the premium standard room at night, but you can't hear the live music, but it's still great. It's different from the perspective seen in Sun and Moon Square, and it has a more overall sense. The breakfast is very rich, and the Chinese restaurant Dragonfly on the first floor provides it. It is affordable and delicious, with a rich variety and is suitable for all ages. All in all it's very convenient and I will stay here again next time.

You can park your car directly in the underground garage of the hotel. There is an elevator directly to the lobby. The check-in procedure was very fast. We were also upgraded to a superior view room. The room where Fruit is welcomed is clean and bright, with a comfortable temperature. You can see the Simatai Great Wall while sitting on the sofa or lying on the bed. The hotel has a rich breakfast, and the reservoir fish head soaked cakes in the Chinese restaurant are very delicious. The hotel is close to the entrance of the water town, and you can enter the water town unlimited times. On the night of your stay, you can take a boat to Riyue Island to watch the drone show. The night view along the way is beautiful, and the Simatai Great Wall at night is very impressive from a distance. In the morning of the next day, we entered the water town again and walked to Tanghe ancient village. Along the way, in addition to the scenery of the water town in the south of the Yangtze River, we also enjoyed the Pingshu Yang Jiajiang and Peking Opera Shajiabang. The time is in a hurry this time, and the trip to the water town is still unfinished. I will come again next time when I meet with my family.

As a result, the restaurants were closed in the evening, so a banquet hall was opened with performances. If you want to eat, you have to queue up. Finally, go to the scenic spot to eat without having to queue. For breakfast on New Year's Day, there was nothing to eat. There were queues for all kinds of staple food. The waiters were busy running around. There were so many guests that they couldn't serve it. This was a problem with the hotel's top management. Some chefs who had not yet finished their meal went over to take away the remaining juice in their own water bottles, and the customers could only watch helplessly.

I bought a standard hotel room with scenic spot tickets, breakfast for two, and scenic hot spring ticket packages on Ctrip.

The waiter went to clean up after the customers left. He didn't have the awareness to clean up the leftovers on the table in time, so he called a few times and didn't respond. Dinner hotels are too expensive and there is little room for choice. If the price can be lowered and the environment is good, the number of diners will naturally come up. The overall feeling is OK.

There are not too many people checking in during the Dragon Boat Festival, and you can check in at the hotel after 8 o'clock in the morning. Guests staying in the swimming pool can swim for free, and tickets can also be sold outside. There are two pools, indoor and outdoor. The outdoor water is quite cool in June. The shallowest indoor is 1.2 meters and the deepest is 1.6 meters. You can bring something to play with in the water. The hotel's restaurant is doing activities, divided into two prices, and there is also a one-hour experience of billiards and table tennis. It's worth it! The hotel also provides a free buffet breakfast for two people. Because children need to make up one, children 68/person, adults 128/person, 7-10 in the morning. The variety of buffet breakfast is not bad, such as noodles, rice noodles, pancakes, fried rice, fried eggs, bread, coffee, milk, fruits, cold dishes and so on. The room was cleaned very clean, the toilet did not smell, and the equipment was a bit outdated.
Generally speaking, the service of the hotel is very good, the hygiene is good, the rooms are clean, and the price is not expensive compared to other hotels in the scenic area.

‚õ±Room type
Upgraded to a deluxe standard room, the room is quite big, clean and tidy. There are bathtubs and desks, and the small terrace can see the mountains outside. The overall sound insulation is good, not too loud.
‚õ± breakfast
Breakfast meets the standard of 138! Very delicious. Hyun off for an hour with two friends.
‚õ±Scenic distance
Although it is outside the water town, it is a three-minute walk from the gate, which is very close. When you go in, you can take a commuter car for free and free your legs. The commuter car runs for 24 hours. After soaking in the hot spring, I took the car back after 11 o'clock. It feels no different from living in the water town.
üéàOverall evaluation
Very recommended to stay. The scenic wine package is cost-effective, and a hot spring ticket is provided. Hot springs and the Great Wall are the most worthwhile experiences. There is really nothing to do in the water town, it is all inns and restaurants.
The water town is still very dark at night, and I personally feel that staying in a hotel outside is safer and more comfortable than staying inside.

After arriving at the hotel, he took the initiative to greet him and upgraded the suite for free. It was amazing! My daughter-in-law was very satisfied with Gubei Water Town this time. The hotel, Yuda Hot Spring, Kongming Lantern, and drones are all very good.
Analyze the price for everyone.
1. After check-in, you can go in and out of the scenic spot unlimitedly with the receipt until 6:00 p.m. on the day of departure, that is, just go in before 6:00 p.m. Regular tickets are 140 for one person, 280 for two people, and 2 days can be counted as 560 or 420. The advantage of staying for 2 days is that you don't have to rush to the scenic spots, you can go wherever you want, and you can feel it when you stroll slowly.
2. After checking in, you can go to Yuda Hot Spring. It is a hot spring city. It is recommended to go during the day. The open-air hot spring on the 3rd floor can see the Great Wall. It is very pleasant. There are a bunch of various pools on the 2nd floor. Since we are in the water town, we always have to soak in the hot springs. The hot spring is 298 per person, and about 600 for 2 people.
3. After check-in, you can take the scenic spot shuttle bus unlimited times. It is usually 10 yuan per person. If you go to the church on the top of the mountain and the hot spring city, you have to take 2 times. 2 people are 40.
4. Breakfast in a five-star hotel has many types of dishes. Let‚Äôs count it as 50 per person, and 100 for 2 people. It is very convenient to sleep late and eat breakfast and lunch to save lunch.
This adds up to 1160, and the room fee is 1260, which is about 100 for the room. There are also fruit and viewing balconies. Super cost-effective, odd value.
The 15 yuan fried tofu in the scenic area is delicious, and the juice is well adjusted. I ate it for 2 days. All questions about hotels and scenic spots can be answered by Li Sijia, the service steward of Water Town Hotel, who likes her with her real name. The hotel and hot springs are very good. I will come again next year.

We also got a hot spring, which was very comfortable. You can see the Great Wall from the outdoor hot spring. The breakfast is also great, with a wide variety and delicious taste. It is a hotel worth recommending.

Originally wanted to book Gubei Light, but found that the twin room over there has a 1.2 bed, and this side has a 1.3 bed, and there is no bathtub between the Gubei Light, so this side is more comfortable.
The breakfast is also relatively rich. We went there on weekdays and there were not many people.
Special praise to Wang Ruxin, the staff member of the No. 1 parking lot. Our family includes young and old. She helped us with services and carried luggage. She has a good attitude and is enthusiasticüëç

In the evening, smelling the unique smell of the mountains on the balcony, overlooking the Great Wall of Simatai, the body and mind are really relaxed here, the breakfast is very rich, and the dinner at the Chinese restaurant is really delicious. The most memorable thing is the light breath of the hotel Incense, it smells fresh, natural and elegant.

The hotel environment is perfect, and the front desk service is perfect.
The rest are standard five-star hotels, and the cleanliness of the rooms is average;
The room size is average; the room is full on weekends, and the room service is average.
Breakfast was mediocre, restaurant ditto. Swimming pool was unusable, poor. Gubei Water Town and Simatai Great Wall are still worth visiting, especially the night tour of Simatai, with a few photos attached.

The hotel rooms are generally larger than the hotel rooms in the water town, but the sound insulation of the room is poor, and the snoring next door can be heard clearly. There were a lot of people catching up with the meeting for breakfast, but the dishes were replenished in a timely manner. The steak in the set meal is not pure steak mixed with beef stuffing on the first night, but it is pure steak on the second night. Maybe it was because no one ate it on the first day, but there were so many people on the second day that it was pure meat steak.

Reasonable requests made to customers are not based on how to make customers feel comfortable and solve problems for customers; rather, the first priority is to make the hotel and waiters convenient and trouble-free.

It has its own underground parking lot. People in the town can't drive their own cars. Where can I go with a tour bus? It's very convenient. If you live in a hotel, you can scan your face and go directly to the entrance. There are few people in line. The breakfast is very rich. Compared with the two restaurants in the town, the Chinese restaurant for lunch in the hotel tastes a little lighter (actually, it is a normal taste, but it is in the two restaurants in the town. The food at this restaurant is a bit salty) It is more friendly to the elderly and children. The only thing is that at night, when the neighboring residents sleep late, there will be a loud noise when opening and closing the door. I don‚Äôt know if it is a sound insulation problem or a door problem. The experience is okay

There is no way to order takeaway in the scenic area. It is also very troublesome to drag a suitcase and enter and exit the ticket gate.

Because the children have to take online classes, we were arranged to check in at 10:00 on the first day. Thank you very much for helping us arrange it when the room is so tight.

msg:The scenery of Gubei Water Town is really good, especially the night scene. Kongming lanterns and drones have suspended the performance, which is a pity. I booked the Pig Man Family Room at the Water Town Hotel. The hotel is located at the entrance of the scenic spot, which is very convenient. It is noted that the room with a view needs to be a bed. The front desk has arranged a 3-story room with a small balcony where you can see the water. In part of the town's landscape, when I arrived at noon, the front desk said that the room was not out. After completing the formalities, the luggage was stored in the concierge, and you could go into the scenic spot with your face and play without any influence. The room is ready in advance, and the staff will call to inform you, which is good. Let's talk about the room, the layout of the pig man, the child likes it very much, there is a small tent and a pony, and there is a building block table, but there is no matching building block, which makes the child feel very disappointed. This table can not play, but also takes up space, very In the way, the toilet has a considerate baby escalator, which is also very good. There is no adult toothbrush and toothpaste in the room, you can get it from the front desk. As for the breakfast the next day, we went there from 7:00 am to 10:00 am, and we went there around 9:45 pm. The hot milk, hot soy milk, and cartoon buns were already cold. Given the current weather, we must not give them to children. Eat, the variety of dishes is OK, the types of buffet breakfast in ordinary 5-star hotels, both Chinese and Western style and usually eaten, the taste should not have too high requirements, the bacon is relatively hard, the pancakes have no taste, the bread is not tasted, only children eat a little. I can say that there is almost no service, or maybe we are late. The free hot spring experience, in the city we chose, needs to be reserved in advance, and the experience feels pretty good. By the way, the hotel's homepage says that there are nucleic acid spots near the door. You should pay attention to this. There are no nucleic acid spots nearby. Now, I have to go to the town to do it. The first time I came here, I didn‚Äôt know where the town was. I asked the front desk for the specific location, and I was told ‚Äúyou can search it on the map software‚Äù, alas, the nearest nucleic acid point found is about 100 meters away from the hotel. Five or six kilometers, so I remind you that if you live for several days, doing nucleic acid will be a problem. It is not very convenient. We only stayed for one night, so it was relatively good, and it was a troublesome toss.
These are the common problems of most hotels, which do not affect the interest of this visit. Overall, it is still good. It is recommended and will come again next time.

[Environment and transportation]: Although it is outside the scenic spot, it is almost the same as in the scenic spot. It is very convenient to record human faces and enter and exit the scenic spot an unlimited number of times.
The hotel has its own parking lot, and it is very convenient to carry luggage in and out of the hotel on the ground and underground, eliminating the trouble of parking the car in the large parking lot outside, taking the shuttle bus and checking luggage;
[Cost-effectiveness]: The double room for more than 1,000 nights is very cost-effective, with tickets for the scenic spot (adult tickets for the scenic spot 160 yuan, senior tickets 80 yuan), two hot spring tickets, and the next day's buffet breakfast, which is also the most attractive of the hotel. In my place, there are dozens or even hundreds of types of breakfast. From 7:00 to 10:30, the restaurant is very large. When there are not many people, there is no time limit. After eating, you can enter the scenic spot beautifully. very comfortable
Service: The lady who checked in at the front desk was very enthusiastic. The hotel itself checked in at 3 o'clock. We arrived at 12 o'clock. As long as there was a free room, we could check in. The waiters were very friendly. What the hotel lacked, I called the front desk and was very helpful. will be delivered soon;
[Facilities]: The facilities in the room are a bit outdated, but the overall is clean and the sound insulation is good; people with bad legs and feet can suggest to the waiter to arrange a room closer to the elevator, because it is really big and there are many rooms, turn left Turn right, live in a quiet place, it's really far;
All in all, it was a very good accommodation experience. Because of the time constraints, I forgot to take pictures of the hotel room and breakfast. I will stay here next time, very satisfied!

There are also all kinds of dead bugs and bed bugs all over the house. , It is said that it is a five-star hotel, but even the basic cleaning of the room is not done well.
2. Service: On October 4th, the service cost of more than 2,000 yuan a night is not as good as the service of 200 yuan. The doorman has no service consciousness. The front desk is also very irresponsible. The hot springs and ferry tickets that come with the package are not mentioned. When you enter the scenic spot by yourself, ask the uncle at the hot spring front desk to tell you the specific reservation method. The management of the parking lot is chaotic. There are many parking spaces underground and in the front yard, but they are not allowed to park, so they let themselves go around the building to find a parking space.
3. Facilities: In order to save electricity for the guests, the bathrooms are made of glass. The shower curtain is just a decoration. It is not pulled. People in the room can see clearly when taking a shower, and there is no embarrassment at all about privacy.
4 Poor sound insulation, a bunch of children in the hallway shouting and running around can hear it clearly, which affects sleep.
The service is completely unworthy of the price. People who specialize in tourism will not stay in this hotel when they go to Gubei Water Town in the future.

msg:I have visited Gubei Water Town about 5-6 times before and after, and every time I choose to stay at the Gubei Water Town Hotel. Frankly speaking, the experience of this stay is much worse than before. When we arrived nearby, it was lunch time, so we went to eat nearby first. Halfway through, I wanted to call the hotel to politely let us know that we had arrived. I planned to check in after the meal. At the same time, I wanted to ask what time it was possible to check in before, but I kept calling and was in a waiting state, so I couldn't get in touch at all. Besides the parking space, the underground parking lot is blocked and no parking is allowed. There are also cone columns directly opposite the hotel. We ask why and tell us what VIP is needed to park there. We have to walk along the road to find a parking space. , I searched around the hotel for a close circle and finally stopped at the westernmost side of the hotel. There is no access to the hotel lobby at all. I can only drag my luggage and endure the sweltering heat. My clothes are soaked and I walk to the hotel. In the lobby, who told us not to be a so-called VIP... Besides, check-in, because it is the peak season for tourists, it is normal for people to queue up, but I don't know if it's the reason for the back or what, I queued up late I didn't move the nest, and I finally got in line. The long wait for inquiries was caused by the many questions from the previous customers. I just wanted to say, can a hotel as big as ours arrange a reception channel dedicated to handling customer inquiries? Finally, let's talk about the Chinese restaurant on the fifth floor of the hotel. The price is expensive and acceptable, but the service attitude is poor. We had a friend who felt uncomfortable eating in the scenic spot and wanted to ask the waiter for a head of garlic, but the waiter responded indifferently, and the back kitchen was off work. It's really speechless, we are not braised garlic, do we need a chef to have a head of raw garlic? It seems that Gubei Water Town is really not something that ordinary people can afford. It can compete with the abbreviation of "ICBC Love Deposit", which is typical of me, I can't stop loving itüòñ

The room manager on the 9th floor thoughtfully provided me with a humidifier. Thank you!

Sing and laugh all the way to go, sweep away the fatigue of the journey. Checked into the hotel, Manager Zhao warmly received him, introduced the play strategy in every possible way, saved a lot of time, and sent a lot of discounts, wow! The baby said: Mom, this uncle is so nice! I want to stay here next time! The next two days of carnival: climbing the Great Wall, soaking in hot springs, eating snacks, ice slides, swimming in the hotel, two days off, it was a lot of fun. Thank you hotel for providing excellent service.

msg:Seeing that the price has finally come down, I hurried to play while my children didn't start school.
The fee includes: room fee, entrance fee, hot spring ticket
The room is quite big, with a bathtubüõÅ, the first hotel in the ancient town is here, the car can park in the underground parking lot, and the check-in is convenient! Other hotels and inns have to park here and take the scenic bus to get there.
Take pictures when you check in, and enter the scenic spot to brush your face unlimited times.
Disadvantages: The elevator needs to go very far to the room, and it is very winding. Sometimes the signs are not clear, and there is no sign from the swimming pool to the room. Needs to be improved! ! ! The hotel swimming pool, breakfast, and hot spring all need to be reserved in advance, but I found that there is no difference between reservation and no reservation. The breakfast is overcrowded and can't find a seat. Going to the swimming pool the next day is like eating dumplings. There are so many people that the swimming ring is rented out! Evacuate decisively and divert to the hot springs. Fortunately, there are not many people in the hot spring, but it is very inconvenient to arrive by scenic bus, wearing heavy clothes and carrying a bunch of things. If you live in the light of the ancient town, you can go directly to the Chengshang Hot Spring Pavilion from the hotel.

The service is very good, I lost my mobile phone in the bathroom and found it in the service center after a while. Every time you enter the door, you have to scan the health treasure and itinerary code. This is more troublesome, but it is also for epidemic prevention and control, which is understandable. I also gave 2 hot spring tickets, but in the scenic spot, we didn't go there, we just went swimming with the children. The swimming pool is very big and clean. There are locker rooms, bathing pools, and unlimited shuttles. It's really convenient. Will choose this hotel. The night view of the water town is beautiful, don't miss it.

msg:I took the elderly and children to Gubei Water Town for a vacation to avoid the Chinese New Year. This is the second time. It is convenient and cost-effective to stay in a self-operated hotel.
üöó 5üåüTransportation: Because it is a self-operated hotel about 50 meters away from the scenic spot, you can drive to the hotel parking lot by car. When we arrived at 14:30, the underground parking lot manager said that it was difficult to find a parking space, so we went around The hotel has a parking space along the road, and it is convenient to walk for two or three minutes from the hotel entrance. The parking fee üÖøÔ∏è is 10 yuan per time.
Check-in can only be given to 2üåüüè®: If you arrive at 14:30, you need to be stuck at 15:00 before you can give the room card, saying that it is not finished, please wait, wait, wait, wait until 15:20 and still not finish, but check out will take 12 You have to leave before ordering. Finally, another front desk helped to change a room that had already been tidied up before moving in, so originally 1üåü, the extra 1 was for the flexible front desk. I don't know how long it will take to clean up. Such a big hotel can't be cleaned up in three hours, which is really inefficient.

üßπHygiene 4üåü: The overall hygiene is good, the bedding is relatively clean and comfortable, but there is hair on the small chair.
üõèÔ∏èBed 4üåü: The overall is clean and comfortable. The material of the pig man's theme quilt is not pure cotton, the static electricity is very large, and the child's hair is blown up.

üçÉEnvironment 5üåü: The overall environment is the configuration of a large hotel, and dining is also very convenient

üçúBreakfast 4üåü: Self-service breakfast before 10 o'clock. The lobby on the first floor is of average type, and there are too many people in the peak season. It is very popular after 9 o'clock in the morning, and there is no seat, so it is very difficult to find.

üîîService 4üåü: The epidemic prevention and control verification code is very strict. Every time you enter and exit, you must check it, and your child will also check it on your behalf; you will be presented with tickets to the water town for two people, and you can swipe your face to enter and exit at any time before 6:00 the next day; We will give you two hot spring tickets (choose one in the city or the Duan family compound). We didn‚Äôt go to soak, but we let the children play with water in the bathtub of the hotel. It is relatively clean and safe during the epidemic.
Plus points üåü If you live in a self-operated hotel, you can take the shuttle bus in the scenic spot at will with your room card or yellow check-in slip, which is also a good choice. Living outside without having to walk around with luggage is still a good travel experience.

Taking advantage of the Spring Festival holiday, I stayed at the Gubei Water Town Hotel for the first time. The children like it very much. The bed for three people is not crowded at all, there is a bathtub separated from wet and dry, and the breakfast buffet is Chinese and Western. Due to the large number of people during the Spring Festival, children over 1.2 meters pay 68 yuan, and the taste is quite satisfactory. Due to the ample time of three days, the shopping is very pleasant and full of flavor.

It was so noisy that I couldn't sleep, and the children in the room were also woken up. I kept crying, I really had no choice but to call the landline in the house to the front desk, but no one answered. I called it countless times, but no one answered. Helpless, I checked the hotel phone number from Ctrip, AutoNavi, Baidu, and various channels, and no one answered the call. Huge "five-star" hotel? No one answered the phone? You are all asleep, I will not sleep. I contacted Ctrip customer service, called the hotel, but no one answered.
Ctrip changed three or four customer service staff and kept contacting me, but they couldn't get in touch with the hotel. Until the next afternoon, the hotel finally called. I told the hotel (a man) what happened next night. The man He was quite rushed, saying that it was impossible for no one to pick up, I must have not called, and I would lie to him again.
What more can I say? ? ?
Can't see the call log? Ctrip also called countless times and couldn't get through. Could it be that Ctrip and I teamed up to deceive the hotel? ? ?

msg:I have been in Beijing for the last three years, and I stayed at the Gubei Water Town Hotel last year and this year, and I have always been quite sure of their hotel facilities. But the first day of the new year was very uncomfortable. I booked 3 rooms and already made a complaint call.
1. There will be an extra charge for extra mineral water in the room, please prepare more water for parents with children
2. The management of the parking lot was chaotic, and there was no on-site command, which led to parking on the aisle. The owner of the front and rear parking spaces only left 20 cm, and there was no call to move the car. In the end, it took 1 hour and 30 minutes to move the car out and rush home. It's getting dark
3. Staff service is not active, indifferent. The guy who took the luggage and the parking lot staff reported that the car was blocked by the front and rear cars and could not leave, but they actually told me to call 114 to find the owner of the car (later, I called the complaint phone, and the parking lot management staff of the scenic spot rushed When they arrived, they really began to help us solve practical problems. They had recordings and photos at the scene, and Ctrip can help to verify)
Another, while waiting for the car to move, the child was crying loudly for nosebleeds, and no one cared about it from beginning to end.
4. The hotel pool management is loose. There is no security guard in this swimming pool, and the water temperature is not the constant temperature advertised by the hotel. Please pay more attention to this aspect.

The breakfast is also very messy. From the meal, the selection of ingredients, and the cleaning of the table, it can not be seen that it is the service system of a big hotel

The swimming pool is very small. I don‚Äôt know why the reservation is divided into men and women. It is mixed inside. The passenger elevator marks the swimming pool, but the actual guidance inside is very poor.

msg:First of all, I am a person who likes to travel around. Due to the epidemic, I chose to stay in Beijing this Chris**as. I didn‚Äôt know what fun places to visit. I read Little Red Book‚Äôs recommendation and came to Gubei Water Town and chose Gubei Water Town Hotel. Since there were a lot of people on Chris**as Day and we couldn‚Äôt book a big room, we booked an ordinary twin room with a price of around 1,200. Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first‚ùóÔ∏è
1. Compared to most other hotels or B&Bs, the location is good but not the best and comes with tickets and hot spring vouchers.
This is the only advantage I can seeüòê
Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages‚ùóÔ∏è
1. This hotel is positioned as a five-star hotel. First of all, I feel that various staff have not received systematic training. For example, when we arrived by car and arrived at the door, the staff stood there motionless and did not open the door for us or pick up our luggage. I personally think this should be the case. It is a service that every high-end hotel should have. Even the taxi driver who solicits customers at the train station will open the door for us.
2. Room problem. I have sensitive skin. After staying in bed for a while, I developed erythema all over my body. After reading hotel reviews, I am not the only one with this kind of allergy, so the hygiene on the hotel bed needs to be strictly paid attention to. Secondly, the table was not wiped clean. There was a previous wave. The water cup mark left by the guest is in the bathroom. The double eyelids of the guest are on the wall. The handprint of the guest is on the wall.
3. Breakfast has very few varieties and only one meat dish, but the taste is okay.
4. After checking into the hotel, there was no toothbrush in the room, and no one told me when checking in. Some staff had a bad attitude. "You must check out before 12 o'clock tomorrow." This is the staff's original words.
5. After checking out, we went to play in the water town. We walked to the entrance of the water town and found that we had left our mobile phones in the room. The doorman asked us to scan the code because we didn‚Äôt bring our mobile phones, so he asked us to show our room cards because we had already checked out and we didn‚Äôt have the room cards. Then he He said to us, "Then you can't get in."
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èSummary‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
Because I have mysophobia, I rarely stay in B&Bs. Most of the time I choose hotels. Since I have high hygiene requirements, I usually only stay in five-star hotels. I think this hotel is the worst in terms of hygiene among all the five-star hotels I have ever stayed in. The service is in place and has not been systematically trained. It is not an exaggeration to rank it as a three-star hotel. If you have friends who want to come to the water town, you must not choose this hotel üôÇ

The room was set as a water town business big bed room. The room is quite big and there is a balcony, but the view is not so good. You can see the Simatai Great Wall, but you can't see the water town. You need to lean out to see a little. There are a lot of stinky sisters, be careful not to open the screens on the balcony.
The hotel package includes breakfast, the variety is very complete, Chinese and Western food are available, but some things are cold, we went at 8:30, maybe we were late.

The hot spring and scenic spots each include two tickets. The area of the room in the scenic spot at the same price is doubled, with a balcony with a view of the mountain view. The variety and supply of breakfast are incomparable, with star-rated service. The only regret is that the long-awaited Duanjia Hot Spring was not opened for maintenance on the 18th from 13:00 to 19:00, but it has been reasonably resolved. Will choose to stay next time.

There are also two hot springs in the city and the Duan‚Äôs courtyard. The outdoor hot springs in the Duan‚Äôs courtyard can be shared by men and women. Children have less things to play with, and the water is a bit hot.
The children's play hall is okay, the area is not small, there are not many people, and the children are quite happy to play.
Xiao Yulin's meal is huge, I can't finish it at all.
The hotel‚Äôs own swimming pool is too cold to swim.
The overall feeling is satisfactory, Gubei Water Town is suitable for a leisurely stroll.
There is a Jingyue teahouse in the water town that is super expensive and unpalatable, so I took it too.

2. The hotel is large in scale, there are many types of breakfast, the Chinese restaurant tastes online, 2 swimming pools, 1 indoor and 1 outdoor. Although there are not many entertainment facilities, the water town is rich in food and enjoyable. It is very convenient to enter and exit the ancient town. The things in the ancient town are more expensive, but the quality and taste are justified.
3. The package provided by the hotel is very cost-effective, especially for a family with a small baby. For example, the children‚Äôs play hall in the package is very large and full of types. It‚Äôs no problem to play for a day, plus climbing. Great Wall, hot springs, etc. It‚Äôs no problem to play for 2-3 days.
[Insufficient] 1. The service and sanitation are very general, and it is basically a simple collection of garbage every day.
2. There are only 2 bottles of bottled water, which is not enough.
3. The package program is not friendly enough for two-child families. If you only stay for one night, with only one package card, you will have to add money for many programs.
4. The hotel's breakfast, swimming pool, etc. must be reserved. It seems serious, but in fact, I have a lonely appoin**ent and will not check it seriously.

msg:Nice place
Haven't stayed here in Gubei Water Town before
Just left after playing for more than a long time
It will take more than a long time to finish shopping
The premise is not to climb the Simatai Great Wall
Come here this afternoon
Not many people
Said it rained yet
The weather is super sultry
See that Gubei Water Town Hotel has a relatively high evaluation
Then definitely come and live for two days to play
It turns out that there is moderate rain
Then just brush the hotel
Suite environment is very good
Enough space
Sent a fruit plate
The toothbrush needs to be picked up at the front desk with the room card
Hot springs and swimming pools are also super good
Very satisfied for three days
The old man and the little boy are happy

msg:A person took his parents and children to Gubei Water Town. Because he had set the wrong room type, the two rooms were not adjacent, which was very inconvenient. After asking the front desk manager Wang Huan and the service staff Ge Mengrong, they helped me upgrade the room type in time. Thank you very much for their warm service, so that my parents and I can arrange the rooms together and take care of each other, which is very convenient. I had a great time for two days, and the hotel service was very warm and in place.

Gubei is very beautiful. It is very hot in summer from 10 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon. It is more comfortable to get up early and at night.

The hotel's breakfast is delicious, there are many choices, parking and getting in and out of the ancient town are very convenient. The hotel rooms are also clean and tidy. It just so happened that the hotel also sent a cake for the child's birthday, which was very considerate!

msg:It's actually not easy to get such a cheap hotel in such a suburban attraction. This hotel is even better than most hotels in downtown Beijing, but there are still the following certainties.

1. Although the hotel says that the water from the tap here is reservoir water and can be directly drunk, not all guests in the house can accept the water from the tap. Therefore, it is still necessary to put two bottles of free mineral water, instead of letting the housing guests spend 6 yuan downstairs to buy the Nongfu Spring which is twice as expensive as in the scenic spot.

2. One of the bulbs is broken, and the night light is too dim. The breakfast is not rich enough, and you need to pick up the money and scan the code to book, which is a bit troublesome.

3. For high-floor guest rooms, you need to take the escalator twice and then change the straight, which is not particularly convenient.

Hope to have a better experience next time you stay.

msg:The hotel is located at the entrance of the park in Gubei Water Town. It takes about 800 steps from the hotel to the ticket check-in. The hotel has its own parking lot, not parking in the exclusive parking lot of the tourist area.
The hotel check in was fast but there was also a wait when there were many people. There are seats in the waiting area.
The room was spacious and the bathroom was spacious.
The room also has a small balcony with floor-to-ceiling windows that allow you to breathe the fresh air of the mountain area.
Breakfast can be reserved for the meal in the time period, Chinese and Western varieties have, not many varieties, but very special, especially Chinese food categories. And the restaurant is still open 24 hours.
Check in the hotel to brush your face can go out directly and unlimited times to visit the ancient town. Very convenient.
Suitable for bringing families to stay.

msg:Traveling during the May Day holiday, the Great Wall view room booked in advance, the room is large, clean and comfortable. Parking is very convenient, and the fee is charged according to the number of times out of the scenic spot, 10 yuan each time. The front desk staff is enthusiastic and patient. After checking in, you can swipe your face in and out of the Gubei Water Town scenic spot as many times as you want, and take the scenic spot battery car for free. Friendly reminders that you should carry your room card with you! The location of the hotel is very close to the entrance of the scenic spot, which is very convenient. It is important to choose the big hotels in the scenic area (such as Disney Hotel, Penguin Hotel, etc.) every time because you bring your children to play. Although it is expensive, it is convenient to live and have fun. The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool is superb and strictly managed. There are other children who are not allowed to go to the pool without a swimming cap. This shows that the hotel is very responsible for the guests. It is worthy of being a star hotel and is worth recommending.
