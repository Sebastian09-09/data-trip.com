The hospitality of the staff is excellent.
The hotel staff is very friendly to the children, they gave me children's amenities and Zootopia merchandise as gifts.
The food in the park of Shanghai Disneyland is not very good, but the food at the Disney hotel is very delicious and very satisfying.
There are many staff who can speak English.
Hotel room is clean and very comfortable. 
I will definitely stay at this hotel again!

Not only was the food and wine first class, but when the fireworks begin, the lights dim and the soundtrack plays. It is almost as good as witnessing the display from the park! 

There were 3 English channels n the TV (Discovery, NatGeo and AXN - an English movie channel) which were three more than I was expecting. Getting to that park was very easy by either boat or bus. 

The staff was extremely friendly. And I was always able to find a staff member who spoke English. 

I highly recommend this hotel for everyone planning a multi-day visit to Shanghai Disneyland (and you really do need at least 2 days to fully experience this park. It is HUGE!)

msg:It might be a 5 start hotel but it’s certainly not 5 star service! 
I was given a bill at breakfast I supposed to sign for even though breakfast was included in our room fee and when I asked about it they said it was a receipt. I’ve never been asked to sign a receipt for something that I’ve paid for in a package deal. Also my kids wanted to go to the swimming pool so wanted to buy swimming tubes. We were told we needed to wait until 9am for the store to open and I asked many times, if they were sure the store sold swimming tubes before we waited and they assured us they did but when 9am can the store had no swimming tubes.  The only solution the pool could offer was to order them to the hotel, this would have been fine if we had have done that in the beginning instead of waiting for a store that didn’t even sell them to open. So we didn’t even have time to go to the pool since deliver would take 45 minutes and checkout was coming.

The hotel has a beautiful environment and gorgeous decoration, like a beautiful manor. I had the opportunity to take photos with Disney stars and friends, which was a great experience. The standard room in the park defaults to two adults and one child. One more person needs to pay a head fee of 230. Breakfast and dinner can be solved in the hotel, but the price is expensive, after all, it is a tourist resort. At night, you can enjoy the fireworks of the castle from the balcony outside the hotel lobby, which is great! It's enough for the children to have fun!

There were staff members who helped me take my luggage and store it. Every staff member was very enthusiastic. I went to the town to take the shuttle bus for lunch. When I came back, I found that the view outside the room was a construction site. I quickly contacted the staff to change a room. I bought a one-and-a-half-day ticket at the hotel, and I could take the Star Wishing Lake ferry into the park in the afternoon. I watched the float show and brushed some small projects during the first fireworks. I watched the second fireworks, got up early at 7 o'clock the next day, went downstairs and rushed straight to the park's Soaring Horizon and Zootopia, then went back to the hotel to rest for a while, and returned to the park at noon. I spent less time in the hotel. Breakfast and breakfast conflicted a bit, so I didn't eat the hotel's breakfast. I didn't see any interactive characters in the lobby. The hotel environment is still good, and it is very convenient to enter and exit the park. My son hasn't played enough, and I will choose Disney Hotel next time I come to Disney.

msg:I booked an ordinary garden room from Ctrip. After arriving at the hotel, because there were too many people checking in, the hotel thoughtfully registered everyone's phone number and notified them in order, which reduced everyone's irritability due to the large number of people! Our hotel upgraded to an executive room. Although it is much cheaper than booking directly, it is estimated that the executive courtesy should be different! Let me talk about the first room given after the room upgrade. It is said to be a lake view, but after entering, although you can see the lake, there is a large construction site. I decisively asked the front desk to change the room. Because I wanted a bed with my baby, the hotel said that there was no such service. For a parent-child hotel, the most basic facilities were not asked at the front desk. They explained that there was a safety accident. I asked to change the big bed. Because the room was full that day, it was changed the next day. This is still quite satisfactory! The breakfast in the executive building is average, and my favorite is the noodles in his breakfast! Finally, let me talk about the dissatisfaction. You must eat at Lumia Restaurant to take pictures with Mickey Mouse. Guests staying in the hotel cannot take pictures. I am also convinced! It feels a bit like a franchisee! Just experience it~Don't expect too much

msg:First of all, it goes without saying that the hotel, facilities, hygiene, and environment are very good, but that's all.
I booked a room on Ctrip. Because my company had to arrive in Shanghai very late on the day of the team building, I discussed with Ctrip whether my friend could book a room first. Ctrip said no, and the hotel said no. I asked them to book a standard room. I didn't fill in the name of my roommate when I booked the room. I must be present in person to check into the room. So far, I have slowly accepted that it may have been my own negligence. No friend's name was added.
 An emergency, an emergency. My son went downstairs at night and was hit on the head by a metal door. He had to go to the children's hospital for a CT scan. I contacted the hotel again and asked if I could apply for my friend to check in first. I would arrive later. Ctrip customer service and I said that the Disney Hotel just couldn't change it. I had no choice but to be there in person. I really didn't know what the regulations were. It wasn't even considered a special situation because of safety. I contacted them again and asked them to help me check out. I have to go to the hospital now. Can I come? Urgent, I am really speechless. The store is bullying customers, and the Ctrip platform is also the store bullying customers. In the end, I have no choice. After making arrangements for the children, I went to Disney. When I arrived at the site, I asked the lobby manager of Disney and said that I can refund if I provide proof of special circumstances. This is not possible with Ctrip. I don’t know what went wrong.

msg:It was my first time staying at a Disney hotel. I was really disappointed. The room costing more than 3,000 yuan, but there was a door on the wall between it and the next room. Therefore, the sound insulation was really hard to describe. I could hear the neighbors talking, taking a shower, and even flushing the toilet clearly. There was no privacy at all. There was no shower in the bathroom, only a bathtub, and a big cloth curtain from the 1980s. Of course, people who don't mind standing in the bathtub to take a shower can ignore it. The mirror frame in the bathroom was peeling off, and the wall bed design in the room was also very weird. The children had to sleep under their parents' feet, and there was a central air conditioner above their heads. After the wall bed was put down, the already cramped room became more suffocating. In short, I was very disappointed. Disneyland is fun, and the only saving grace of this hotel is that you can enter the park through the hotel passage, and that's it.

I want to talk about the service, starting from getting off the car, the reception at the door, the reception in the lobby, the front desk, the concierge and the check-in corridor. The service staff and cleaning staff I encountered were very good and greeted my children very warmly. The only thing I wasn't happy about was the interactive Disney characters in the hotel lobby. I could understand that they had to queue up after being out for ten or twenty minutes. However, I met them in the lobby three times and when I was about to queue up, I was told that the queue was over. I had to talk to the waiter. They said that we had missed the line three times and no one wanted to take a photo with us. Could we stop for a few seconds to take a photo? The children were very disappointed and I was a little angry. It wasn’t until the fourth time I bumped into each other while waiting to check out that I took the photo (Picture 1). The second picture was seen at the entrance of the restaurant downstairs. The service staff said that only when dining in the restaurant can you take a photo. Otherwise, you can only stand outside the queue and take a picture by yourself, so I took a picture. I hope it can be more humane, or give guests a card to remind guests when they check in. After all, many people stay here just to make their children happy. Most people don't know that there is such interactive content. They will be disappointed if they miss the interaction between children and Disney characters.

msg:I stayed at Paradise a few years ago, and I was surprised by the cleanliness when I stayed there again this year. I found a hair on the bottom of the bathrobe hanging in the bathroom on the night of check-in. It was obviously left by the previous guest. They didn't clean it properly, so I left the hair on me. This kind of problem shouldn't exist in a hotel of this price.

msg:It was the first time I brought children to Disney, so it was also my first time to stay in a hotel. I found that Disney Hotel is the first window and bridge to officially enter the park. All the staff treat everyone as "children" who have returned to their childhood. From the moment I checked in, From catering, parent-child activities to check-out, there is a "Disney Smile" to greet, serve, answer and provide help everywhere. The hotel is like a big garden, full of green and vitality. Although the rooms are not as spacious or modern and intelligent as new hotels, they are full of small details, including beds, lights and layouts with many Disney elements. The children like it very much, and the interior of the room Many supplies can be taken away as souvenirs. It is very convenient to take a car or a boat from the hotel to the park. You don’t have to worry about playing too late or being too tired. It is suitable for families and children.

Luggage storage can be sent directly to the room. After buying a half-day ticket, you can take the Star Wish Lake Ferry directly from the hotel back garden pier at 2 o'clock to enter the park, which is very convenient.
Early access to the park (up to 1 hour in advance): You can take a bus directly to Disney Town in the morning and enjoy early entry, with almost no queues.
You can buy sales peripherals in the hotel, and the experience is still very good.

msg:A Disney theme hotel worth visiting twice.
I'll write a small guide by the way, hoping it can help those who want to go later.
Time/Weather:
April 6-7 (the last day of the Qingming Festival and the next working day)
Weather: cloudy on April 6 and light rain on April 7

Day1
1. Immersive experience of the princess entering the castle and exploring the magical world. Fortunately, I upgraded the closet room for free, which is a little surprise that children like. After arriving in the room, I changed my clothes and started the princess's joy.

2. Do small handicrafts in the children's activity room, explore the Hakura Matata Park, and the theme characters will interact intimately from time to time.
Highlights:
Small handicrafts can be taken away, full of Disney elements, and children like it very much.
At 7 o'clock in the evening, I met Gao Fei in the hotel lobby Pluto group photo,
The outdoor lawn is very big and nice. In the evening, when the lights come on, children can have fun.
There will be live performances by a pianist in the lobby from time to time, which creates a good fairytale a**osphere.

2. At 8:15 or 9 pm, you can enjoy the gorgeous fireworks from the rooftop terrace of the hotel, with synchronized sound effects (disadvantages: the distance is a bit far, there is no shock of the scene, and expectations cannot be too high)

3. The hotel has a swimming pool, which is very clean. Those who do not enter the park on the same day can go there to play (we did not bring swimsuits so we skipped it)

4. You can buy limited edition dolls in the hotel fairy shopping center. You get one chance every night you stay. You can choose one of each style. You can only check out at the same time and cannot use them separately (limited edition dolls can only be bought by queuing in the park by lottery, which is a rare opportunity)

5. You don’t need to buy tickets in advance when staying in the hotel. The hotel can guarantee accommodation Guests can buy tickets for the period of stay, and can buy half-price tickets to enter the park at 3 pm. The real-name system for staying in the hotel is not allowed.

6. The hotel can enjoy an hour early entry to the park, bus transfer/Wishing Lake ferry, round trip is very convenient

Sweetly fall asleep at night, looking forward to starting the next day's park trip...

Tip: The hotel has a buffet, which is a bit expensive. The rich can do it as they please. Ordinary people can take the ferry to Disney Town to stroll around and find food

Day2
Special note: You must get up early and don't sleep in
1. Take the shuttle bus at the hotel entrance at 7 am, take the hotel entrance channel, enjoy early entry, and rush to the projects you want to play as quickly as possible.

2. The projects we have played and route guide:
Dwarf Mine Car-Crazy Zootopia Hot Pursuit (we played it twice in a row, it was great)-The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh-Spinning Crazy Honey Pot-Tomorrowland Flying Machine - (The originally planned Color Celebration Street Party performance was cancelled due to rain) - Immediately changed the reservation to Mickey Mouse Book Tour (a great show) - Mickey Mouse Special Train Parade (Luckily, we came out of the show at about 12:10, just in time to watch the 12:15 parade floats, the kids got into the first row, super happy) - Small town Coucou Hotpot to replenish energy (I would like to praise my companions for being so awesome, I accompanied the little princess to watch the parade floats, and my friends went to Coucou to order some dishes, and after the show we sat down and started eating directly in the restaurant) - After eating, we entered the park and encountered the Color Celebration Party at 2:00 pm (just made up for the Color Celebration that was cancelled in the morning due to rain, and occupied a great position, right opposite the fixed stage, and in the first row. We waited for about 10 minutes, and watched it happily and interactively. The main point was that we were happy and satisfied) - Rope Challenge Course (a bit high and has expansion challenges , Thunder Mountain Rafting is more recommended, but because of the rain, the princesses didn't want to raft and skipped it) - Shipwreck Treasure - Captain Jack (If the time can be stuck, you can go to Jack first, then go to the shipwreck treasure, the route is smoother) - Flying over the horizon - Taking pictures at the big castle (it's time for the princesses to go home, go through the castle to the town, buy gifts at the world store, and take a boat to the hotel to pick up the luggage and go home)

3. In addition:
The Speed ​​​​Light Wheel is very fun, but there is a height requirement of 122
The Hug Dragon Sky Racing, the height requirement is 120,

Additional details:
If it rains, the hotel concierge can provide umbrellas that can be taken home, the quality is super good, super considerate

The hotel is not cheap, but for the convenience of the whole play and the experience of the little princesses, it is definitely worth it
For the old mother, only the moment of paying is heartbreaking, and the rest is happiness!

I don't know if it has not been used for a long time or it has not been cleaned (I washed it several times before I used it). The water that comes out has a smell. I vomited after drinking two sips... It was my baby's birthday that day. I checked in at the hotel in the afternoon and said that they would send a small cake. As a result, it was not delivered until after 9 o'clock in the evening after many urgings. The children had to go to the kindergarten and rest early the next day. I don't know how to arrange the time. The breakfast is also hard to describe. It's not delicious, not to mention the quality. Most of them are ordinary semi-finished products. The wontons still have a meaty smell. It's enough to fill you up... I thought there was IP interaction for breakfast, but it turned out that I had to line up outside to take a photo... It's really unnecessary to spend nearly 1,000 for breakfast for two adults and one child. It's not worth it! ! ! The most important point is that the sound insulation is very poor! ! ! The child was woken up after 11 o'clock in the evening, and continued to sleep for a while. After 12 o'clock, there was a noise outside and a banging sound from the next room, and he was woken up again. The hotel said that there was no way to verify it at night, so they could only delay our check-out for two hours...

It's quick and convenient, and the comfort of returning to your room at any time when you're tired is endless.
But, but here it comes
1. The soundproofing of the room is not good. The two children next door were chatting and joking happily at 12 o'clock in the morning, and cried for an hour at 3 o'clock in the morning... The busy footsteps and anxious urgings of late arrivals and early flight tourists. As well as the sounds of things falling upstairs and the switches next door banging, you will enjoy an exciting sleepless night.
2. The bathing facilities fully consider the happiness of the baby in the bathtub. Although disposable bath bags are not provided, you can ask the guest room staff to disinfect the bathtub a second time. Adults can only stand in the bathtub and take a shower. There is only a small shower head, not a large shower head.
If you only stay for one or two nights, adults can just make do with it. After all, you value the happy time in the hotel more.

The waiter in the restaurant had a bad attitude. He came to collect the plates while we were eating. He said he would collect them later and rolled his eyes🙄️. A negative review of 1 point is for the terrible food in the breakfast restaurant and the extremely poor service from the waiters. I spent over 4,000 just to see your face.
The hotel front desk, concierge room and everyone else I met gave it a five-star rating!

Shuttle Bus/Wish Star Lake Ferry: The 5-minute ferry journey is very convenient.
Checking into a hotel is hassle-free and you don’t have to spend a whole day in Disneyland. After finishing your favorite projects in the morning, you can go back to the hotel at noon. It’s suitable for those with children and also for beauties who love to dress up and take photos.
During the hotel breakfast, you can interact with the Disney dolls in the hotel, and there is also an interactive privilege for the boss and wife to take a photo alone.
Generally speaking, it is not suitable to go there if you are worried about the price comparison. Some people say that the internal environment of a hotel with the same price is indeed far better than this one, but the unique geographical location and some benefits cannot be matched. Different people have different opinions.

It is very friendly to bring children, and the hotel also has many activities, which is very suitable for children. It is great to be able to enter the park an hour early and basically play all the activities you want to play. By the way, my toenail fell off while walking, but I didn’t bring any nail clippers. I asked the hotel if they had any, and they gave me a new one. Really, at that moment, whenever I come to Disney in the future, I will definitely book this hotel.

msg:My friend said that the hotel looks very old at first glance, but if you look closely, you will see that the materials are exquisite and a lot of valuable building materials such as solid wood and brass are used. Some details, including the door handle of the toilet and the production of the room number, are both sophisticated and elegant. Reflects Disney elements. Cartoon characters come out to interact with each other from time to time in the hall; in the fireplace room where we live, the closet on one side can be lowered and turned into a 1.64m long bed. My baby will exceed 1.64m in a few months, which is also a big drain on our wallets. The important reason why you must come and stay here is to seize the tail of your childhood. I turned off the lights in the room and there was a light show like the one in the first video next to the bed. I played it no less than 10 times. It was very dreamy. The overall service is great. The hotel's waiters and telephone guest service center are very friendly and gave many small gifts after leaving the hotel.
      Let’s talk about the shortcomings. The room is a little small, and the shower and bathtub are together, so there is a potential risk of slipping. A larger area of ​​10-20 square meters will be fine. I was so excited on the first night that I didn’t fall asleep immediately. I can sleep from time to time around 12 o’clock. I heard the sound of the sewer flushing upstairs.

msg:Avoid the busiest Spring Festival and take your children to Disneyland on the weekend after the holiday. The price of the park hotel has dropped to normal. Although it is not cheap, it should still be worth it. After all, I don’t come often. Advantage 1: Excellent service, every staff member smiles sincerely, and room service responds promptly. Advantage 2: There is a special shuttle boat behind the hotel, which can shuttle hotel guests to and from the hotel, the park, and the town non-stop from 11:00 noon to 11:00 pm. It only takes five minutes, which is much faster and more convenient than the shuttle bus! Advantage 3: This is also the biggest advantage. You can enter the park one hour in advance. You can use this time to play several popular activities, which is equivalent to giving each person a free express pass. Disney prices are really expensive, and the souvenirs are not that exquisite, so just buy some.

msg:This is my first time coming to Shanghai. Since my baby is about to have his 3rd birthday, I want to give him a meaningful birthday. This time I chose to stay at the Disneyland Hotel. Not to mention the price, someone will greet you as soon as you enter the hotel. Compared with other The service in the hotel is so much better. There is a statue of Mickey Mouse when you enter the hotel, as is the elevator in the hotel, and Goofy and Pluto appear in the lobby on the first floor.

The Lumia restaurant in the hotel is very high-end. You can take pictures with Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, and Pluto when you eat at Lumia restaurant. There is no need to queue up to take pictures at the entrance of the restaurant like in Disney. The chef of the restaurant also gave us a piece of rich fish, which was so thoughtful.

The hotel can also buy Disney tickets and give you an exclusive card to choose 1 out of 7. You can also enter the park in advance, and it is very convenient to take the ferry.

The small details in the hotel room are also well done, including a Mickey lamp beside the bed. The waiter's service was also excellent. He looked at me holding my child and carrying my luggage and offered to help me with my luggage.

But the only drawback is that the hotel is not soundproofed. When I lie down and sleep in the room, I can clearly hear the sound of the shower faucet turning on and flushing upstairs or next door.

In short, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I am very satisfied with my stay at the Disneyland Hotel. See you next year.

How can I put it~ The so-called theme means that there are more decorations~ There are quite a few Frozen elements~ The Mickey theme is very ordinary~ In addition to the themed gifts in the iron box, there is a refrigerator magnet and a small square towel (these two should be among the most popular). Ordinary) There was nothing else except a cup. I was disappointed that there were no Mickey themed gifts. Frozen also has some other gifts~ Luggage covers, cushion covers and the like. There is a locked door in Mickey's house that looks like a partition door~ I feel like someone is knocking on the door at night~ The soundproofing is much worse than Frozen~ Some Noisy~
The hotel provides a 24-hour ordering service~ After going to Disneyland, I always order at the hotel~ The quality of the food is okay~ The price will definitely be a bit more expensive, but you are here~ Just eat
Living here is very convenient to go to Disneyland. Both 🚌 and 🚢 are available~ Very convenient~

msg:The price of the hotel is destined to provide enough added value. I think this can basically score 90 points, which is still worth it.

Let me talk about the good experience first. 1. Most of the service staff in the hotel are very enthusiastic, including the front desk check-in and children's playground. They are full of smiles throughout the process, and the staff will take the initiative to say hello when they pass by. 2. The transportation is convenient, especially the ferry. The time is short and you can save a lot of walking. The early entrance to the park + the green channel of the hotel is really delicious. We finished breakfast at around 7:20 and entered the park at 7:33, which saved a lot of energy. 3. There is no need to crowd around when shopping. You can buy limited edition Linna Bell. Each room has a purchase opportunity.

The experience is not very good, but it is the executive floor where we upgraded this time. 1. The attitude of the VIP restaurant staff is rather stiff, no smiles, very unhappy, and the food is very mediocre. I originally upgraded in the hope of better service, but I don't think so; 2. It's a little noisy during the dining peak, maybe it's a holiday, and there are a lot of children. The location for watching fireworks is good, with background music, but the immersion is still different from watching it in the park. It's just not cold and there are few people, so everyone can enjoy it.

Although the price is expensive, we got a very convenient entrance (the ferry is the closest!), a full fairy tale a**osphere, fireworks viewing on the rooftop, abundant children's activities, and a very warm reception from the staff~ We booked the Qiji Garden In the Dream Child Fun Room, I was not very satisfied with the garden view at the back of the hotel, but I am sure the children liked the closet bed. I would like to remind everyone that if you want a room with a lake view or a paradise castle view, you can also request a closet bed (but it may not be the case) 100% satisfied)

msg:Facilities: The bathtub in this room type is very small, so children can only take a shallow dip. And I took a shower while standing in the bathtub. This is the only unreasonable thing about the room. Both beds are large, 1.4 meters tall, and can fit two adults who are not fat. There is no problem sleeping a child of about 10 years old in the small bed in the cupboard.

Environment: You can watch the fireworks show on the ninth floor rooftop of the hotel. However, from the sound effects to the light and shadow effects, it is not as good as watching it in the park. It is still recommended to go to the park to watch the fireworks. But it is highly recommended to visit the hotel garden, where you will meet the Lion King, Cinderella, and the childhood in your dreams.

Service: The hotel service is very good, everyone greets me warmly. The buffet is not as bad as the online reviews, at least the tempura in the buffet, which is easy to overturn, is quite satisfactory. Smoked fish is also good. And when you eat in the restaurant, you can take photos with the boss and his wife.

The Paradise Hotel has a better location and a better environment. It is very convenient to go back and forth by boat. This birthday month, I even got a refrigerator magnet for my stay.

Even though room prices soared during Chris**as, I still chose to stay at the Disneyland Hotel because it was really convenient. This time, the hotel’s slippers were all Zootopia-themed, and I also gave small gifts around Zootopia. It was better than last time. Of course if you go more often, it might be just in time for Chris**as🎄. This time I chose the room delivery service for breakfast (I forgot to take a photo) and it felt very good. It is a good choice for lazy people ^^ In short, coming to Happy Hometown is the best choice for lazy people like us who don’t want to get up early in the morning and queue up to stay in a Disney hotel.

We went in at 9 o'clock and didn't see any Disney characters interacting in the restaurant. We could only take pictures at the door. It felt so worthless.

Because I was so tired after playing for 2 days, I slept until about 10 o'clock the next day. I ordered a package with breakfast. The customer service said that breakfast ends at 10:30. I was afraid of eating it. No, later the beautiful guest relations manager postponed breakfast to 11 o'clock and check-out of the room to 1 o'clock. The experience was super good. We returned on the same day and played for a while in the Paradise Hotel. There is a children's activity room, physical examination and coloring. During the trip, the hotel staff also took the children to play games, a maze picture-finding activity, and there were small prizes. The children liked it very much. We just happened to catch up with the handicraft activity. Because we were catching the train, the little beauty gave us handmade raw materials. My sister was very satisfied with this visit to the Paradise Hotel and said that she would stay at the Paradise Hotel next time she comes to play 😂 By the way, cartoon cups are given in the hotel room. There are also small gift boxes for children, which are very beautiful. I am very satisfied with this experience and praise the staff.

There were not many people on Monday morning, so I had a very comfortable meal. I also saw Mickey and his friends dancing and taking photos. It's especially convenient if the ferry opens normally on Sunday night. It just takes a little longer to wait for the hotel's special car from the subway exit. It depends on luck. The room is a bit small, but I don't spend much time in it. Call Didi from the hotel to Pudong Airport, and there will be a car very quickly. The drive takes 25 minutes and is very smooth.

Except for the friendly check-in and purchase staff at the front desk, the others are really not that good (especially the children's park, there are about 7-8 female staff, and only one looks like a mixed race) The waiters were very friendly towards the baby, but the other waiters didn't even smile.

When I checked in, I discovered it was birthday month! Immediately gave me a birthday badge! Wearing this badge, all the staff in the park and even the cleaning lady will say happy birthday to you🎂! I received blessings from dozens of strangers in two days! So warm! There are small cups, towels, and stickers as souvenirs in the room! The hotel provides round-trip boat transfers! You can watch fireworks from the rooftop! There are dolls available for purchase only for hotel guests! Breakfast is delicious! You can take photos with your boss and his wife and watch them dance! The room is clean and tidy and the toiletries are very comfortable! Every detail penetrates the background lighting! My birthday is coming next year! This money has to be spent! It was a joy to spend it! 🎃On Halloween, you can also ask for candy from the pumpkin-carrying staff! Trick or treating is so much fun!

msg:The most convenient hotel to go to Disneyland. Guests staying in the hotel can take a boat or bus to the park. If you don’t have an annual pass, it is recommended that you buy tickets at the hotel. You can enjoy a preferential express card worth 180 yuan. With the hotel accommodation card, You can enter the park through the passage of Disney Town, and there is basically no queue. As for the room facilities, if you don't have high expectations, it is still OK. There is a Dyson, but there is no smart toilet. The 1.4-meter bed is quite comfortable to sleep on. Because of its large size, the service is quite satisfactory~ The fireworks light and shadow show in the park during Halloween week is particularly exciting~

msg:I stayed for one night and was given a connecting room on the 2nd floor. The room was very small and the check-in arrangement was very slow. My child suddenly had a lot of nosebleeds in the room at around 6 a.m. (maybe because the hotel room cannot open the windows and the air conditioner is on for a long time. The air was very dry) I called the front desk in panic, hoping to get help. The reply was extremely cold, saying that no one could handle it, and that the infirmary was about 8 minutes away. I asked if someone could take us there, because we were completely unfamiliar with the surrounding area. , the answer is no, you need to go by yourself, you can only send someone to change the sheets. After half an hour no one wrote back to offer help or come to change the sheets. After the child's nosebleed finally stopped, I called the front desk and asked to change the sheets and complained. Only then did a waiter come and change the sheets without any comfort or instructions on how to deal with it. As a hotel serving children, there is no first aid knowledge, and more importantly, no compassion, which is completely inconsistent with the spirit of Disney. Very infuriating

It took us a long walk to see the room even after it was dark. I couldn't see the outside of the window clearly. I opened the curtains the next morning and saw that this was not a garden view room. Isn't this a construction site view room? Are you showing me the excavator and bulldozer? The room is not big, it can be said to be a bit crowded, and the bathroom is also small. The only advantage is probably the Dyson hair dryer. Secondly, the sound insulation is very poor. I am a very light sleeper. On the first night, I could hear the loud sound of water until two or three in the morning. As a result, I didn’t sleep well all night, which affected my trip to the park the next day. play.

Apart from these hotels, the a**osphere is really good, the lobby and external environment are also very good, and the service is also good. They will take the initiative to help with luggage. From time to time there are dolls to interact with. But the boss and his wife must go to the restaurant to eat before they can interact with each other. The price-performance ratio is indeed not very high. I also wanted to experience it when I booked the Paradise Hotel, but I felt that I might not stay there a second time.

It is also very convenient to take the special park shuttle bus to enter the park in the morning. When you are tired, you can take the ferry back to the hotel, rest for a while and then go in. It is really convenient. The FamilyMart convenience store after getting off the ferry is so convenient. I didn’t buy any speed passes for two days and one night, but my husband and I completed all the events, including Caribbean 4 times and Over the Horizon 4 times. You can probably arrange it like this. Buy a half-day ticket on the first day of check-in, and then go in without watching any performances, just brush up on the projects. If you don't bring children, you can definitely go through all 6 major projects at once. The second day is mainly about performances and mini-games. It won't be too tiring either. Will come next time!

I told the administrative front desk about the birthday of the little princess, and if I could arrange a room facing the paradise, the front desk agreed directly! The executive floor is open 24 hours, and you can go for a drink at any time, especially now in summer, when you come back from the park, you really want to drink some cold water. It’s really comfortable to ask for a fat house happy water directly from the administration! And there are good night stories and saying good night to Mickey before going to bed. what a magical few days

msg:The soundproofing of the room was so bad that I suspected it was from the express hotel. The shouts of the two women next door could be heard very clearly, and the thumping sound was clearly heard. It didn't stop until about 1 o'clock in the middle of the night and we were able to fall asleep. The sound of the air conditioner blowing was also heard. It was so big that it affected my rest. In the end I had to turn off the air conditioner and sleep. I have stayed in many five-star hotels with different price points. This one is not cheap. The facilities are really unbearable. I can’t stand the children’s animation dream. My nigh**are is that in the morning, when I was in a very bad mood, I found that the salmon I brought was on the food. Is there a hair breakfast supervisor or someone whose solution is to change you to salmon? ? I also accepted that since my child didn’t eat breakfast, I was not allowed to pack the remaining bread for her to eat on the road, and finally stopped charging her for breakfast. There was no gift for the child when we finally left. A luxury five-star hotel does this and I don’t want to say anything else.

This place is full of Disney's magic and imagination, with dynamic shapes, dynamic lines, undulating decorations, walls, floor stalls, curtains, furniture... Disney's whimsy is everywhere.

The hotel enjoys the privilege of enjoying the park early and can enter 1 hour in advance. Disneyland Hotel has free shuttle bus and ferry between Shanghai Disneyland and Toy Story Hotel, making your travel more convenient.

Special praise to Zhang Jiji of the swimming pool. He has a good attitude and is very enthusiastic about teaching children to swim.

It's just that the signs of the underground parking lot are not very obvious, and it is not easy to find when entering the entrance.
Amap directly searches the hotel address, and the location will be on another road. It will not prompt the entrance to the parking lot. If you are not familiar with the road, you will need to turn around again.
The overall living experience is good and I will come again next time.

On the first day of check-in, the staff gave the child a toy, and some small gifts later! Although it is not worth much money, it feels good, and the main children like it more. You can also buy it directly in the hotel, and you need to win the lottery to buy the dolls in the park! It's just that some things in the hotel are a bit old and should be replaced! It is better to change the bathtub to a bigger one, which takes care of both adults and children! After leaving the hotel, I received a call from the hotel. I forgot something in the hotel. The clerk kindly asked me to leave the address and send it to me for free. It deserves a big thumbs up 👍🏻, and I will choose to stay next time!

When they saw children with them, they also offered small gifts, which was very considerate. This time I booked a room with a closet and small bed. Although the space is a bit tight, the children like it very much. The room will provide each child with an exclusive water glass and small towel box, as well as a set of seasonal cards and stickers . For the sake of environmental protection, the hotel does not actively provide disposable toiletries, but if you need them, you can call the customer service depar**ent at any time, and the staff will deliver them to the room immediately. The hotel lobby will regularly arrange a meeting with the Disney protagonists. If you dine in the hotel, you can get in touch with them at a closer distance and take a group photo. Staying in the hotel can not only experience the rights of entering the park 1 hour in advance, but also can take the shuttle bus and cruise ship to and from the park for free, which is really convenient. Another point is that if you live in the Paradise Hotel, you don’t need to draw lots to buy Reina Belle’s products, and you can realize Rena Belle’s freedom. In short, it is very recommended for families with children to stay. When you have played in the park for a day and found that you can return to the hotel in 10 minutes, that feeling is really like grabbing a life-saving straw.

Datang Service: The service staff in the lobby here give full marks! Check-in and check-out are staffed to help carry and carry luggage, which is much better than Universal Hotel's service!
Concierge: Sorry, points will be deducted for this one. Because I called the concierge in advance and said that the exclusive card can only be purchased depending on the stock situation of the day. But I was afraid that the inventory would not be enough to buy, so the official website grabbed the package ticket first. But in this case, you can't enjoy the privilege of a speed pass for the hotel to buy tickets.
The service of the commodity depar**ent in the hotel: This is really a bad review! Check-in guests are not only eligible to purchase limited items of the same item but only two items of the same limited item, and limited items can only be eligible for one checkout! For example, if you bought two Lingna Belles and already paid for them, you can no longer buy limited star dew at the checkout. What kind of devil overlord clause is this? ! The checkout staff didn’t make it clear. I just checked out the limited item A. In less than 30 seconds, the child took another type and wanted to continue paying, but the staff said no, (because there is only one checkout for limited items per room per night. Qualification. This sentence was summed up by myself, and the staff didn’t make it clear at all!) So I said that I want to return the product and pay again, which doesn’t work either! I was so angry that I argued with the staff on the spot. In the end, the supervisor helped to solve the problem and the bill was settled, but the process made you feel uncomfortable! Can only give 2 stars for the service in this depar**ent.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Trip.com, the hotel ordering platform, for letting me book a hotel for the first time. It is simple, easy to use and convenient, and I will continue to use it when I go abroad for vacation.
The rooms in the Disney Hotel are actually very large and tidy, but because they are designed for children, the size of the inside, such as the bathtub, will be relatively small. Toiletries such as toothbrushes will not be actively attached to the room due to Shanghai’s policy. You need to use room service and ask them to bring it to you, but don’t worry, their customer service is very kind, although they say that they will get the room after 15-20 minutes, but the speed is super fast, you can fully feel that they are afraid of neglecting the guests . The check-in counter clerk is also very enthusiastic about explaining, always smiling.
Let me talk about the disadvantages first
There are no beverages in the refrigerator, but there are 4~5 cans of bottled water. If you want to drink, you can go to Disney Town to buy it. To Disney Town, you can take a boat or take a shuttle bus. It’s just a short journey .
The bathroom is done the European way with the shower over the bath. But the way of boiling water is very special, it takes a little time to get familiar with it, I can't describe it in words, you will understand what I mean once you actually go there.
There is no toothbrush, so I have to call the customer service and ask them to bring it.
advantage
The service staff is very enthusiastic, you will understand what I mean, after all, the people in China are different from Taiwan.
There is a large garden outside the hotel, and there are various Disney-related themes inside the hotel. The whole hotel has a European-style garden style, which is very suitable for taking pictures. The whole hotel is very clean both inside and outside.
It is very close to Disneyland, especially the privilege of early admission, which allows you to enjoy various popular rides in a short time.
If you live in a hotel, you can ask them to deliver all the souvenirs purchased in Disneyland to the hotel, and you can pick them up at the sales depar**ent in the hotel. But beware, you cannot use this service after 6pm. People who don't want to carry big bags and small bags in the amusement park can make good use of them.
Hotel guests can purchase ultra-limited products in the sales depar**ent of the hotel, which is also the privilege of guests.

I booked in advance, and the check-in price on June 1st is 3624 yuan, which is not a cheap room. The result is such an experience. In addition, there are too many limitations in the interactive photo taking in the hotel lobby. First of all, the grade of dining in Xuanjing Building must not be lower than that of the one downstairs. I discussed with the staff not to let the children and Donald Duck take a picture. I think these need to be adjusted! The overall service did not feel intimate. Except that the front desk was very cute when checking in, and patiently explained the surrounding features. Others really don't feel like a high-standard hotel. Incentives do not recommend everyone to stay! Simply bad! ! !

The magic lights at the head of the bed are worth the children’s silly fun for a long time. You can also realize Belle’s freedom and Disney’s animation freedom. Entering the park through an exclusive channel one hour in advance allows you to own this paradise. In the evening, you can see the beautiful sunset of Wish Lake. It's just that the schedule is too full every day, and I haven't had time to experience other activities in the hotel. Next time I come back, I must take a good look at the hotel. Reminder, it may be due to environmental protection considerations, the hotel does not provide toiletries, please pay attention when traveling. "Have a magical day"

The young employees are of excellent professional quality and service is in place, while the older ones seem to be a bit regionally discriminated against and look down on guests from other places! The language attitude is particularly blunt, making people instantly feel that Disneyland Hotel does not have a good impression of foreign tourists! This is because the service quality of an employee is not good enough, which leads to a lower overall corporate image. Therefore, the service can only be given 1 point. The housekeeping depar**ent is very good. The lost items of the guests are found as soon as possible and verified with the guests, and sent to SF Express to send them home.

msg:I really don't know how to evaluate this hotel. I carefully read a lot of leave before booking, and I agree with the praise of its environmental sanitation. Besides, I don't think it can be said about the service. The whole hotel is full of commercial flavor. In fact, I chose it just for the little bed, and I wanted to give the child a surprise. I really don’t know where the fun lies in the euphemistically named "Qi Meng Tong Qu". The difference in courtesy between check-in and check-out is star-studded. The faces and tone of the people in front of the door are very different. The hotel's programmed service makes people extremely uncomfortable. There are two more points to mention in particular, 1. Breakfast, this time with a 4-year-old child, I have been out for more than two months, and all the hotels I have stayed in have free breakfast for children, but this hotel requires The fee is 246.** yuan; 2. The price of the products sold in the hotel is extremely high and the quality is extremely poor. They are specially designed to fool children. An Elsa-themed skirt, a card issuer is 478 yuan, and a pair of shoes is 219 yuan. After wearing it for a day, the clothes were torn apart, the heels were glued and cracked (the picture is the proof), I stayed for two nights, and played Disney all day, I feel that the money of the Chinese people is so easy to earn. I left Shanghai today, and I am free for the first time. All of a sudden. I stayed in the most expensive hotel for more than two months. Compared with the hotels I stayed in before, this 35-square-meter room with a price of 4000+ is really not worth it, and the price/performance ratio is extremely low.

We upgraded the executive room on the spot, and upgraded us to a room with a closet bed. The children were so happy that they flew up and slept next to Mickey at night.
You can take the bus and ferry to the park, both of which are free for unlimited times, which is too friendly for our family with children. The park ticket bought at the hotel also gave a fast track, which we used to fly over the horizon, it only took ten minutes, and we were very satisfied. In the morning, you can enter the park through the entrance of the town in advance, which is much faster than the main entrance, which saves time.
The hotel is very clean and tidy, and the rooms are warm and upscale. We gave many small gifts to the children. You can watch all Disney cartoons on the TV.
All in all, it was a very happy experience, and I really want to come and live again!

The hotel facilities are average, but from a child's point of view, she likes the bedside magic lamp, watching fireworks in bed, the bed in the closet and the small bathtub for soaking in the bath, as well as the beautiful hotel environment and the ferry. Adults feel a bit worse. There is no bathing area for adults in the room, so children can only stand in the bathtub and shower. Try the bedside magic lamp first when you enter the room. We don’t know what’s wrong with this, half of it is broken and cannot be used. Overall, it's still a very good feeling, and the flaws are not concealed. The hotel is not only close to the scenic spot, but also has an exclusive entrance to the park, which is very user-friendly.

All kinds of cute little gifts make the children feel good. When I arrived at the high-speed rail station, I found that my daughter left the water cup at home. There is a Disney buckle strap on the mineral water bottle in the room. Immediately full of affection; the Lena Bell limited edition that the little girls like can also be bought directly at the hotel.
      We checked in in the afternoon of the same day and entered the park the next day. The advantage of a one-day tour of the park is that after check-in, you can take the ferry to Disney Town for a while with the room card, and then store your luggage at the hotel concierge before entering the park the next day, and then take the shuttle bus or Ferry back to hotel to pick up luggage.
       It is recommended to buy tickets for the park at the hotel. You can enjoy one hour early entry and a fast pass service for one project. Under the traffic flow of May Day, we played 5 projects.
        Regarding PhotoPass, it’s a good service item, and the staff are very good at capturing pictures, but because they couldn’t accurately locate the meeting time of the cartoon characters, when they saw someone taking pictures and pulling their daughter over, they were told by the staff that they could no longer line up to take pictures. Somewhat a little regretful. The overall experience of staying and playing is very good, and I look forward to coming back after the opening of the Zootopia Park.

It's so convenient, and it's a very special experience [Applause] The hotel room has specially prepared Disney souvenirs, postcards, sticky notes on the refrigerator, and a handkerchief in an iron box for the guests as souvenirs. Another feature is that Disney cartoon friends appear in the buffet breakfast room, which is called a wonderful moment. You can also take a photo with Mickey and Minnie to make a souvenir photo album with a leather case (additional charge). It coincided with the birthday, and the restaurant presented love chocolates and Disney badges. The luckiest thing this time is that the birthday celebration plan was to pay attention to the occupancy price before the epidemic was released, and grabbed the lowest price. Staying at one-third of the price is of course a five-star review!

It is much more expensive than the Universal Studios Hotel, but the experience is much better, and there are many magical moments.

The two-day early admission to the kindergarten is really delicious. The birthday card is on the body, and all kinds of happy birthday sounds surround the children, which makes the children very satisfied. It's so cool to buy my beloved Stella Lo and Rena Belle at the hotel store. The room facilities are complete, and you can also go to the park by boat. After playing all the items you want to play in one day, you can also use the speed light wheel for the second time. Satisfied! Be sure to come on weekdays, the experience is very good.

There is a shuttle bus to the scenic spot in the morning, and a cruise ship to the scenic spot after 11 o'clock. It feels great to watch the fireworks from the distance in the room at night.

To unsubscribe tickets, you need to provide a hospital diagnosis certificate. You can only walk in or drive in to run errands and deliver medicine. It is recommended that the hotel create conditions to set up a small infirmary separately. After all, it is different from other hotels. The location here is remote and there are many children. .

msg:2023.2.12-2.13 Disneyland➕Hotel🏨Two days and one night
I bought tickets to the park on Double Eleven, and Fliggy costs 1100 for two big ones and one small one, which is quite a bargain. Because of the epidemic, I postponed my trip until the end of the winter vacation. I didn't go out to stay in a hotel during the winter vacation, so let's stay at Disney for one night.
Ctrip booked the fireplace room one week in advance, 3500/night and double breakfast, and added a child’s breakfast at the store 256, he ate a few small wontons, a rice cake, half a cup of milk and orange juice... and took pictures 268... 😄
You can enter the park in advance if you stay in the hotel. We chose to enter the park on the day of check-in.
Go out at 7:00 in the morning, check in at the hotel at 7:40, get a temporary room card to store your luggage, then take the hotel bus, and enter the park at 8:10, come back at night and go directly to the room according to the room number notified by the text message.
The golden hour of entering the park early, I played Leaping Over the Horizon and Pirates of the Caribbean without queuing. I also played boating, manual labor...the children want to play...because of the rain today, the flow of people in the park is relatively small. Then I went to the mine roller coaster, the speed light wheel. Wait 5-10 minutes in line.
Watch the parade at 12:15, and then have lunch. The taste of Malatang is not bad. In the afternoon, I watched two theaters and took a rest. Then I went to Leiming Mountain for rafting, and I played everything I wanted to play.
Leave the park at 16:30, have dinner in the town, and then enter the park at 18:00 to watch the winter parade at 18:20. Then take the boat back to the hotel to rest.
The fireworks at 21:15 were watched on the 9th floor of the hotel, with supporting music playing, but the light and shadow show on the castle was invisible.
The bed in the hotel is very comfortable. It would be better if the children next door upstairs go to bed earlier, haha
The gift shop of the hotel also has pajamas of Lingna Belle. You can only buy one for each room. I didn’t want to buy it at first, but seeing the limit...it seems like a loss if I don’t buy it...😂

We have brought two children, so we call every day to ask for a copy, otherwise the two children will fight😂 Every day Mickey and Minnie will come out to interact with everyone and take pictures. There is also French fries in the amu*****t park telling stories and doing handicrafts. The children are very happy! The hotel's buffet is also very good, my favorite is Mickey's dessert mushroom soup and seafood taste great!

Disadvantages: The air conditioning in the room is not user-friendly, it switches automatically, and cannot set the hot and cold settings; bedside fences are not provided, so families traveling with children may have safety risks when sleeping; the hotel can watch Disney fireworks and light shows, but it is a bit far from the castle.

If you are tired, you can go back to the hotel to rest. It is really super convenient. Although the hotel is not new, many details in it are full of fairy tale elements , especially the round knob on the bedside table in the room, turn it around, Mickey's head appeared in the mirror, and the castle behind the bed set off fireworks, as if by magic. You can buy half-day tickets and one-day tickets at the hotel. It’s very fun to play for one and a half days. The one-day tickets bought at the hotel have a fast pass that can be given away. I bought tickets in the app in advance, and I lost a lot. Hotel guests have early access card and concierge access privileges, so they don’t have to queue for so long to go to the gate of the park. The room is booked one month in advance, and the price is quite favorable. It’s a very pleasant trip, and the trip is worth it.

The one-and-a-half hours before the early access card, we basically finished the popular activities once.

The restaurant is also good, and food in the shape of cartoon elements can be seen everywhere. Just tell me directly when you check out, the room card is also part of the souvenir, I had a lot of fun.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good and it is the closest hotel to Disneyland. Take the shuttle bus in the morning to enter the park directly from the town, which is faster and more convenient, with fewer people.

If you want to stay, it is recommended that the executive suite is not much different from other rooms, but the floor is high and you can watch the fireworks show directly in the room if you are required to face the park. There is no breakfast in other rooms. Executive rooms can have breakfast on the seventh floor. It is a small buffet. The meals are average but can fill your stomach.

I think there are too many interns as waiters, and their service awareness, attitude, and professionalism are average. Just don't ask them with the requirements of a business hotel. It is very convenient to take the ferry back from the garden in the afternoon.

There is no Chinese food in the hotel, it is all Western food, and so is the buffet. Friends who love Chinese food should stay away

Generally speaking, the service is quite satisfactory, but the environment and location are very good.

Secondly, it is very convenient to travel between the park and the hotel by boat. Our whole family loves boating. It's just that the boat is only available after two o'clock in the afternoon. It would be more perfect if there is a departure before noon.

Next, I would like to say that the internal facilities of the hotel rooms are a bit outdated, and I hope they can be updated in time to help improve the hotel's image.

Finally, I would like to thank the manager on duty who helped to change the room this time. He handled it in a timely and considerate manner, and was able to reach customers.

The mug included in the check-in gift is out of stock, and a small iron box is added (actually, there are already a lot of small gifts). When checking out, the child forgot to take the toy charger. The hotel even called and arranged to send it back. Thank you very much! Always full of magic and beauty here!
Small suggestion: Different small gifts will be presented for multiple stays. It is more appropriate for the staff to actively check the number of check-ins when checking in.

msg:The service at the front desk was super good. After learning that we had two babies, they helped us adjust to the room with the closet bed. Every service staff greeted us warmly. The room is also very classic and clean! Requests made are always accommodated as best as possible! Watching fireworks in the hall avoids shivering from the cold, and the setting sun outside the window of the room becomes a beautiful painting. The breakfast on the second day was a bit perfunctory, and the dinner from the previous day could not be booked. Only four people came and went, which was a bit small. After all, we paid the New Year's price. I hope there are more facilities for children to play in the hotel.

I am quite satisfied with Disney's consistent service level, but for environmental protection reasons, cotton swabs and swimming caps will not be provided in the room, (but the hotel will provide it if you ask for it yourself). It feels a bit foreign.

The service is nothing to say, the hotel cast and crew are very enthusiastic, and will tell you where and when to wait for the bus and take the ferry when you stay for half a day. We can only buy afternoon tickets at the concierge depar**ent of the hotel. If you buy a full-day ticket, you can also get a fast pass and early enjoyment~ The bed in the room is quite big, we have twin beds + a closet bed, and my son likes it very much (no Saw the closet bed was fresh). We got up at 5:30 the next day to wash up and have breakfast (the hotel ferry is a Family Mart convenience store where you can buy some bread and milk for breakfast the next day, which is very convenient) I thought there would be a lot of people queuing up, but we never expected that we would be the first to wait for the connection Car [laughing and crying]) The first bus is at 6:50, and it will be delivered directly to the entrance of the park in the small town, and you can just show the room card ticket. Really super convenient! In the evening, I also experienced a meal delivery service. The steak and fried rice tasted good👍

msg:A room of around 6,000 per night, the price/performance ratio is really low 😂

facility:
The room is not big, and there is no separation of dry and wet in the bathroom. It is the first time that I have to stand in the bathtub and take a shower in a five-star hotel.
There are only two showers in the swimming pool and it is impossible to wash at all.

Environment: The hotel is facing the park and you can see the fireworks.

Service: The waiters at the front desk will take the initiative to serve, because there are many people, and active service is conducive to maintaining order.

Breakfast: There are many varieties and unpalatable. Fried wontons and glutinous rice cakes are so hard that they will break your teeth. Noodles and wontons are cooked in advance and placed there for self-serve. Wontons are not freshly wrapped. Breakfast is too worth more than 300 per person.

If you don’t have small children (under 8 years old) at home, it is recommended not to stay at the Disney Hotel during this peak season. It is better to live in a luxury five-star hotel in Pudong, which is much more cost-effective.

Hygiene: Cleaned up very clean, in line with the standards of high-end hotels~

Environment: After it was released, it was full of people. I have been here several times, but I have never seen such a spectacular scene. The lobby is full of guests waiting to check in after 3 o'clock. There is no place to sit and the order is a bit chaotic~

Service: Although there are many people, the service level has not declined. The staff are very enthusiastic, but the Lumia buffet is really expensive, and the breakfast is single and the taste is too ordinary. It is just to meet the cartoon friends in Miaomiaowu ~ Room service The food here is really bad, and the unpalatable food is basically wasted ~ Personally, I think everyone's experience will be better if the quality of the food is improved ~

This word has passed, so I quickly took advantage of the lack of people to satisfy my daughter's long-awaited Disney trip for three years. .

It is still very good, the facilities and services are not discounted, and the boat that was suspended last time has also been restored. In the morning, take the bus directly to the entrance of the town with fewer people and quickly enter. It is very convenient to take a boat back to the hotel at night.

It is highly recommended that you must stay at the Paradise Hotel when you come to play, and feel the charm of the Paradise immersively.

I want to say that a folding bed is installed under the TV cabinet and it becomes a family room. Why don’t you put two reclining chairs into a suite? There are very few comments. As a Shanghai native, I think Disney in Shanghai is really bad. Everything is charged as a tourist attraction. I have lived in Disney since it first opened. At that time, the room fee of more than 5,000 was already very speechless. It’s really not worth paying for such an outdated facility. A room with the same facilities outside is worth a thousand dollars. I hope you don’t have to cut leeks because of the epidemic. It’s really not as good as going to Hong Kong Disneyland to play. The service attitude is very good, which is commendable. I didn’t embarrass Shanghai. The hotel has to spend some time and money to renovate the room. What kind of hardware is this more than ten years ago? It’s scary. It’s nothing but convenience

The only bright spot is that there is no Mickey in pajamas at night. The traffic is more convenient, that is, the ferry time should start from the park opening in the morning Open, you have to wait until two o'clock in the afternoon to take the ferry. Taking the bus in the morning is too time-consuming. If you enter the park an hour early, you will spend 20 minutes on the bus. It is recommended that friends who want to enter the park in advance should take a little more time. Just got stuck at the point to get in the car.

msg:A Disney hotel worth nearly 5,000 yuan a night was cheated. There was no hot water to take a bath on the night of check-in, and the fault was not repaired until late at night, so I was forced to go all the way to take a shower. Hotel meals are not as good as a street vendor. The PS capability of the hotel pictures is too powerful. The publicity pictures of the hotel show that Disney’s fireworks can be clearly seen from the windows, but the real situation is that only a few stars can be seen from the distant fireworks, and the second is the Disney store. For the water issue, there was no compensation, not even a sincere apology. In fact, the extremely bad impression of Shanghai Disneyland has already been experienced N years ago when Shanghai Disneyland just opened. When I went to Shanghai Disneyland for the first time that year, while waiting in line, the staff in the park scolded tourists for not being in a neat line. During the tour, I asked the staff how to get there, but the staff there were indifferent. It is in great contrast to the enthusiastic trea**ent of Hong Kong Disneyland. Advise all friends who have never been to Shanghai Disneyland, don't waste money

I guess I have to rush to enter the park an hour earlier. The housekeeping staff are already at work. Check in at 3:00 and check out at 11:00, 20 hours? !

msg:The last time I stayed in Toy Story, this daughter's birthday, I specifically came to stay at the Disneyland Hotel.
When I checked in, I saw that we had previously stayed at the General Mobilization Hotel, and we specially gave a small gift, which is a benefit for returning customers. Seeing that my BMW is going to have a birthday, I specially sent a small cake. I went there at 12 o'clock, but I didn't expect to be able to check in after 1 o'clock, which was very smooth.
In the afternoon, I played at the hotel, squeezed plasticine in the children's play center, went to the swimming pool to swim, and then took the ferry to Disneyland. I also ate at Lumia Kitchen in the evening. I had to make an appoin**ent to line up for the meal, and I was given a photo card when I was seated, so I could take a photo with Mickey and Minnie. After dinner, I will go upstairs to watch the fireworks, it must not be as shocking as the paradise, just want to have fun.
Get up in the morning and rush into the park to play, brush a few items and go back to the hotel for breakfast. Then prepare to pack up and check out, the schedule is full.
There are not many choices for breakfast and dinner, and the taste is the same, mainly because it is in Disney~
There's nothing wrong with Disneyland hotels, they just burn money.
Overall, Toy Story is the best value for money.

msg:The reason for choosing the Paradise Hotel: It is very tiring to play in the Paradise, and you can take a ferry back to the hotel to rest at night, which is faster.
The common disadvantage with the Toy Story Hotel: if you take a shower in the nearby room, you will hear a very loud water pressure sound, which affects the rest at night, and the sound insulation is not good.
The room has no windows for a long time, there is a strange smell.
Check in and queue up, the staff speaks in an endor*****t style, and draws circles with the iPad in a formulaic manner. Arranged a room on the first floor without asking, but after refusing to delay the re-arrangement.
The environment is beautiful, there are a variety of pillows to choose from, there is a convenience store at the hotel's ferry terminal, and watching fireworks by the lake at night is another beauty.

It may not be the peak season. The child is very happy, that's enough.

msg:This was a very bad experience! I checked in at 15:00 on April 28 and checked out at 11:00 on April 29. I left the hotel at about 21:30 after storing my luggage. What happened: I have the habit of listening to music before going to bed. After I fell asleep that night, I put the white second-generation Apple Pro headphones (engraved with my name) on the bed. Since I had entered the park early the next day, I hurried back to check out. , so he forgot it in the room. I am a guest from Hangzhou. After I got home at 12 o'clock in the evening and packed up my things, I was about to listen to music and go to sleep. I found that I had forgotten my headphones at the hotel, so I immediately called the hotel to explain the process in detail. After inquiry, the receptionist informed me that there was no registration record of the items handed over. I had to wait until I got to work the next day to ask for a reply again. I called the hotel at eight o'clock the next morning and still couldn't find a reply. For an international brand hotel where the room rate does not include breakfast and costs 5,700 RMB per night, guests are required to clean the room carefully after leaving the hotel and hand over the items left behind by the guests. But now the result is that they can’t be found, and the headphones are missing. Unheard of! I have had similar experiences of leaving items behind before, and the hotel took the initiative to contact me and send them back. This time, they actually said they couldn't find it at the Disney Hotel, and it was still left in the room. Is the hotel's explanation to the guests that it can't be found? If the headset is indeed lost in the room, the hotel should have the obligation to protect the guest's life and property while the guest is staying in the hotel. I booked through Ctrip and posted my experience in the comment area. It was really a terrible experience! Will never come again! ! !

Really had an amazing day.
There are no plastic slippers in the swimming pool, it is said that it is because of the epidemic. I moved my toes and thought, as if this could not depend on the epidemic! It seems that all hotels with swimming pools I have been to have plastic slippers.
Disney music is really good, but scrolling through those songs all day is too monotonous. Music can really liven up the a**osphere, but it's a little disturbing to hear it in the toilet, it's too loud.
Thank you to all the staff I have met who are friendly and hardworking. 💐👍

The price/performance ratio of breakfast is not as high as imagined. A 6-year-old child costs 249. Because he doesn't eat much, it seems a little expensive.
As a parent-child hotel, Disney has nothing to say about the quality, the experience is very good, and the children's handmade activities are rich. The waiters, brothers and sisters are all very enthusiastic, and the room service is nothing to say. If you need anything, a phone call can basically fulfill your wishes and let you spend a magical day.
The most unexpected thing is that my friend's luggage lock can't be opened at all. After a phone call, the engineer will come to unlock the door in 10 minutes. Check-out can also allow the waiter to come to the door to pick up the luggage and send us the wrong one first. We play and then come back to pick it up. It's really a good experience, and we spent a magical day.

Although the hotel is not new and the rooms are not big, the service staff are very friendly, and the whole hotel is full of childlike fun. Children and adults love it. Breakfast is over 3 years old. To be charged, like 254 yuan. The price is not high. The children don't eat anything at all, but nothing in Disney is cheap. There are pictures at the entrance of the restaurant. In the end, I bought two for 299 yuan. The free boat and bus are very convenient. It is very useful to get in an hour early. I thought I would give up this hour for breakfast, but in the end, considering the large number of people on the National Day, this is the hotel to stay in. The greatest benefit. In the evening, I went to Xuanjing Building to eat and watched the fireworks in the restaurant and the platform on the 9th floor. Overall a perfect experience

The price is too satisfying during the National Day. BTW, if you arrive early in the morning, you can do pre-check-in, and after that, you can get a room card. Although the room has not been allocated and cannot be checked in, you can use the room card to enjoy other services such as boats and buses. Will come next time! In addition, the Lumia buffet dinner with children is recommended, which is cost-effective!

I feel that from the front desk to the room service, they are all interns. They always look shocked and have no sense of wanting to help customers answer their questions. Because I stayed for two nights in a row, I specially pressed Do Not Disturb, but when I returned to the room the next day, I found that someone had come in to clean the guest room. I asked the customer service, and said that I saw the Do Not Disturb light was on, because my door was not closed tightly, so I came in. This explanation is obviously unreasonable. I might as well answer that we are sorry for the lack of training of our cleaning staff, and be more sincere. The deafening sound of running water in the shower next door at night thought that there was construction somewhere, and the children were crying, and they could hear it clearly. won't live again

I like this to avoid the loss of another child. After going to Disney Town for dinner in the evening, the baby saw a photo with Mickey and Minnie at the entrance of Lumia Restaurant. The children were very excited to take a photo, but the staff told them to eat buffet at Lumia Restaurant to be eligible for group photo, hehe. The next morning after breakfast in Lumia, a photo coupon was given to take a photo with Mickey and Minnie. The water quality of the swimming pool is OK, and the lifeguards are also complete, so you can swim with confidence. There are activities every hour in the children's activity center, but it must be accompanied by a parent, which is not good. Many hotel children can take full care of children over a few years old.

It happened that two "working dogs" were open at the front desk, and a group of children were surrounded by excitement and barking. With administrative courtesy, you can go upstairs to dine and watch the fireworks. , The distance is a bit far, but it is not cold and windy in winter, suitable for small children and the elderly. This time the room view is still super good, I love Disney, and Disney will love me too. The kids loved the fireplace bed, great evening.

First of all, the transportation is really convenient, whether the bus or the ferry can let you free your feet after a day of playing. The executive room can really eat from morning to night, and the snacks taste pretty good (the requirements cannot be too high and can be satisfied) Hotel The service staff will greet you warmly every time they see you (in line with five-star standards) the bedding is comfortable and the temperature of the air conditioner can be adjusted by yourself (very satisfied) the bath products taste good Better hotel room facing the castle can see the fireworks perfect
The room card will not be charged, which is convenient for you to travel the next day. It is really considerate to the extreme. Check in on the first day and play in the park on the second day. The car can be parked at the hotel. If you don't have a car, you can take a boat to the hotel (5 minutes) and then take a taxi at the hotel. Very convenient

If I don’t go to the park, I will buy, buy, buy, eat, and eat. I have participated in the basic hand-made activities for two days, and I can take them home as a souvenir. Intimate, remember to go to the ninth floor at 8:30 to watch the fireworks with synchronized sound effects, it is really worth it, extremely comfortable and unforgettable memory, breakfast is a topic, the layout feels better than self-service, and it looks good when it is full. In short, the ceiling of the absolute parent-child hotel, from Service facilities and food, there is nothing to step on the thunder, and the children's dreams are lit up in the Paradise Hotel, and they have spent two magical days and one night!

However, the arrangement of gifts in a room and the delicious and delicious birthday cake have already made the baby jump with joy, and there are countless kisses attached.
Well, the Paradise Hotel, with super five-star price, four-star facilities, sanitation and service is still very good, at least it will not make people feel that it is not worth the price. With children, wherever you go, staff or cartoon characters take the initiative to say hello. Every time I go to the playroom, I have a good time and come back with a small gift. Although adults all know that wool comes from sheep, but I can't help my baby like it ^_^
Because there are shuttle buses and ferries, it is also convenient to eat in the town. There is another family at the ferry terminal. It is very convenient to buy milk, bread and yogurt the next day. In the evening, it is more comfortable to go to the terrace on the 9th floor to watch the fireworks across the lake~ Although the nostrils are full of the cooking smell of the back kitchen of Xuanjing Building, haha…
Check out the next day, the room card can also be taken away, you can continue to park at the hotel or take a free boat to and from the town. This is very humane!
Finally, I commend the hotel's anti-epidemic measures again. Every time you go in and out, everyone has to scan the venue code or read the application code. Although it is troublesome, it is very reassuring! Everyone comes out to play, but you don't want to suddenly become close, right?

For example, all kinds of furniture will have rounded corners, and the taste of the food will not be particularly heavy. It can be praised, but being a children's themed hotel does not give him points for this. It's an internal arrangement, involving all the people, and the problems that need to be communicated and solved are very poor. There is no service at all. 1. After arriving on the first night, I dine at the Xuanjing Building. There is nothing special about it. The price of French food is unbearable. Excellent service and taste, 2. After dinner, inform the children's activity center on the first floor that there will be Mickey's interactive activities. After arriving, you will be informed that you can only take a group photo if you spend at the Lumida restaurant. 3. Then arrive at the executive floor to watch the fireworks. Non-residents are not allowed Enter, you are allowed to enter after communication, and I have to add that you don’t eat (only very cheap biscuits), the environment is very general, 4, breakfast the next day, free breakfast on the executive floor, no accurate reminder, leading to 1st floor & 7 Floor, the whole hotel runs back and forth, 5, take the ferry to the opposite paradise, walk to the side of the boat, let’s wait a moment, the staff replied, it will open at the right time, just beside the boat, 6, there is no hot water supply in the bathroom on the executive floor , children wash their hands with cold water, 7, the front desk reception staff on the executive floor has no order at all. 8. The dinner on the executive floor was actually taken by the guests while receiving the food, and after reminding the staff that the food was not finished, they completely ignored it and continued to pour out the food. 9. The service staff encountered in the above eight points did not Problem-solving attitude, arrogance, impoliteness, chopstick-biting smile, the worst star-rated hotel I’ve stayed in, bad reviews, four days and three nights in the hotel, 10, overall, Disney’s standardization is very good, But beyond standardization, the ability and attitude to dynamically deal with problems with customers is very poor.

Transportation: In terms of transportation, it is quite convenient. There are shuttle buses and boats to reach the park, but the time and station location on the road are obviously not as good as the newly opened Universal Studios, and the road costs are more expensive than the previous Haichang. , the location also does not have many advantages.
Hygiene: Don't worry about hygiene, it is the most reassuring among several parent-child parks, giving people a very comfortable feeling.
Environment: The environment is too beautiful, it can only be said that there is no money. Whether it is the living environment, the a**osphere of the whole hotel, and the matching degree with the park, they are all very good, obviously higher than the Universal Studios Hotel. It has a sense of substitution, and it has a sense of substitution than Nuojin, full score!
Service: The only service that deducts points is from check-in. It is obvious that the business is not skilled, the information in the system is not read well, the supervisor on duty walks around, and each table is stringed; there is no substantial help, giving people a very impetuous feeling, To give a bad review.
Other staff are very friendly, especially the swimming pool. They feel the existence of fairy tales, and praise the lifeguard Sam by name. They can observe the needs of guests in time and provide corresponding services.

msg:The service in the administration building is deceitful. First of all, as a customer who often lives in the executive building, if you book a room with breakfast in the Disney executive building, you can only eat breakfast on the executive floor. The overall quantity and quality of breakfast on the executive floor cannot be compared with the breakfast buffet on the first floor. At the time of purchase, the Disney Hotel did not particularly clearly point out this point. I don't think you can reply me with inexperience, and you are suspected of playing around the corner. Second, the size of the rooms on the executive floor is the same as that of ordinary rooms, which can be seen when booking. Therefore, I think that the administrative building of the Disney Hotel does not feel the trea**ent of the administrative building as a whole. The meals for afternoon tea are also very simple. Therefore, I think the price-to-price ratio of an ordinary room with breakfast included is much higher than that of an administrative building. At night in the administrative building, a Mickey Mouse in pajamas will take a photo with you. There are two Mickey Mouse in the restaurant on the first floor. Compared with Disney's VIP, the fireworks view can only be said to be visible on the seventh floor, and it is very unclear, so it is not the same as seeing it on the spot. It's better to buy another VIP seat for fireworks, it's really worth seeing. Therefore, compared with the ordinary room type, the executive building costs two to three thousand more, and eats a breakfast with much less choices, a limited-time afternoon tea with only desserts, and a limited-time dinner that ends at 7 o'clock with fewer varieties. Is it better to have an ordinary room plus the service experience you can buy with your own money to buy various meals?

The bacon and croquettes in it were obviously not fresh overnight. A serving was 88 yuan; 2. The check-out time of the Disney Hotel was the next day 11 o'clock, upon application, it can be postponed to 12 o'clock, but because the children were swimming that day, they were still taking a bath at 12 o'clock, and the waiter knocked on the door on time to remind them to check out; 3. The hotel's breakfast children over three years old need to pay extra , about 300 less than one person. Generally, the breakfast charges for children in high-end hotels start charging when they are not three years old; 4. The bathroom design of the hotel is rather strange, the toilet and bathtub are not separated, and the bathroom is not ventilated (we stayed in Fantastic childlike room type), if an adult goes to the toilet, the entire toilet is equivalent to a strike.

Most of the customers who wanted to take photos with Donald Duck had to eat in the restaurant downstairs. This rule was a bit ugly.
The room card was given to us as a souvenir. We ate in the cafe in the lobby on the third floor. The waiter found out that my daughter liked Stella Dew and gave her a small Stella Dew ring. I was so touched!
It's very convenient to go to the park. Hotel guests can enter the park early. I just entered the park first and played five activities and there was no one in the park.
There are many shuttle buses, running from morning to night, and the ferry runs on even-numbered times, every 20 minutes. The arrangement is very reasonable and compact. There is also a family store where you take the boat, where you can buy snacks and breakfast.
This time I finally stayed in the closet bed room I had been dreaming of, and the children were very satisfied.
There is a shop in the hotel, so you don’t have to go to the World Store to buy the usual items.

There will be different experience activities throughout the day, divided into indoor and outdoor; the weather is hotter and the outdoor sports will go for a walk.
Due to 😷 current restrictions, it is not that there are not many people on weekends. The overall experience is still good. The hotel has a direct bus to the town, which is very convenient.
The hotel service is still commendable. I have met the boss many times in different venues. Mili asked the boss to raise everyone's wages and let him open the park quickly. And then... the park reopened within a week.
In addition to restaurants, there are also small shops in the hotel where you can do some shopping.

msg:The service is unimaginable. The hotel is not bad for customers, so I don’t care about the experience of customers. The manager on duty Yao Chunni (TINA) I met has never encountered such a situation until now. The attitude is simply indescribable. The experience so far is the best. Poor Disney Hotel~ As for the hygiene, there are hairs on the quilt. I found this phenomenon during the call with the manager on duty and told me that there was no way to do anything. Maybe I think it's normal~

msg:I used to go to Disneyland on the same day. For the first time, I chose to stay at the Paradise Hotel. Apart from being expensive, everything else was fine, haha. It may be that there are not many tourists because of the epidemic. I feel that there are surprisingly many staff, and their attitude is very good and very enthusiastic. The hotel is very beautiful, and many beautiful photos can be taken in the lobby and rooms. The important thing is that you can enter the park one hour earlier through the special passage of the hotel the next day. In addition, during the epidemic, we were the first to enter the park in the morning, and there was no one at all. , It was so cool, I quickly played Leaping the Horizon and Thunder Mountain Rafting, and only after I came out did people start to line up. At night, you can watch the fireworks on the roof of the hotel, or you can take the shuttle bus and boat to the opposite town with your room card. The only thing I need to complain about is the hotel's breakfast, the worst hotel breakfast in history, more than 300 people, it's not a buffet, it's a well-matched set, none of which is what we want to eat, the baby only ate a few mouthfuls, I also reluctantly I drank a bowl of porridge, and spent a thousand yuan and was not full, so I decided not to recommend it.

Entering the park one hour early avoids the trouble of queuing for sweets and candies. After a day of playing, you don’t have to rush home by subway after watching the fireworks show. You can have a drink in the hotel’s executive lounge before 10 pm drinks. Very happy experience.

msg:Disneyland Hotel Reviews During Pandemic

In addition to catching up with the epidemic, I am very satisfied that there are fewer amu*****t facilities in Disney this time, and I am very disappointed in the rest! We were the collective nucleic acid of the community on the evening of the 14th, and the results were released on the afternoon of the 15th. The epidemic prevention policy issued by Disney on the 13th states that you need to provide nucleic acid certificates within 24 hours to enter the resort. We plan to play on the 16th to the 17th and buy a package of more than 4,200 Ctrip two-day tickets + deluxe garden view room (no breakfast) ), I wanted to take a 2-year-old baby, and I didn’t want to play so nervous because of the nap issue, so I arranged a two-day itinerary. As a result, the gap between the ideal and the reality is too great. This gap is due to the unreasonable explanation of the policy and the indifferent service attitude of the hotel front desk. We checked in at the hotel at 9:00 in the morning on the 16th, and the front desk came up to promote the hotel's new products. The Donald Duck-themed room asked me if I wanted to add money to upgrade, but no one came. If we don’t take the initiative to upgrade our customers who come to support Disney, it’s fine, and it’s even promoted! At that time, I felt that the hotel was too stingy, I refused, and said that the staff in other hotels would take the initiative to upgrade the room type when there were not many passengers, and then the front desk said that the theme room was not good, we would upgrade the landscape at most, and then I said to bring the baby I need a big bed room, put the baby in the middle to save the fall, she started to say that there are very few big bed rooms, then made a phone call to help me ask, and then upgraded a room on the executive floor, especially emphasizing that there is no executive Courtesy, I thank you! Then I asked me for a few days of tickets for the park. I said that I had already booked the tickets in two days, so I started to ask for the nucleic acid certificate. I showed her the nucleic acid test results. She said that she could play on the 16th, and the nucleic acid needs to be re-tested on the 17th. I said your official The announcement did not say that nucleic acid is needed tomorrow. It is normal to understand that it is enough to provide a certificate before moving in. But what the hotel gives is that there must be new certificates every day. I said that you need to make it clear on the official website. If the nucleic acid only takes care of this day, we can go back on the same day and come back on the same day. There is no need to book a hotel again. Then the front desk said that our hotel will check the nucleic acid once, but the amu*****t park needs to check the nucleic acid every day. I don't know how a resort has so many policies, what kind of messy management. No matter how many we took our children out to play, we didn’t want to continue to reason with them, so I asked about the refund of my existing two-day ticket order. Dealing with this kind of thing is particularly slow, it will take a month to get a reply, and you can only call me back in mid-April), I bought a one-day ticket to enter the park on the spot, and the nucleic acid certificate was only checked before the hotel waited for the bus. Paradise did not check! The baby played all day and couldn't wait to watch the fireworks at night. We went back to the room after six o'clock. The luggage was put into the room by the concierge staff. Let's evaluate the room. The room on the executive floor on the 7th floor is also very small. I thought that no one would check in and the front desk would arrange a room where you can see the fireworks. In addition to meeting a queen room, we didn't feel that the hotel's official announcement was not clear to us. Sorry for the economic loss, I can't even see or hear the fireworks, there is nothing in the refrigerator in the room, I don't know if there is no consumer goods or it can be provided to the executive courtesy. Guests can't give it to us. The air conditioner will send out every minute or so when I sleep at night. noise! Originally, we planned to spend two days at the hotel. Our 4239 package did not include breakfast. We decided to go home after waking up for this service that night, and we didn’t want to spend a penny! Having stayed in so many parent-child hotels, a big-name hotel like Disney doesn’t even have the demeanor of a big-name brand! It seems that no one cares about the training of the staff, and they will not come to stay again. It's really bad!
To summarize my experience:
1. The 24-hour nucleic acid certificate is only valid for one day. Even if you are active in the park, you still need to provide a two-day ticket to the hotel guests. This is not clearly stated on the official website, which will bring direct economic losses to the guests.
2. The front desk staff only focused on promoting the room. I don’t know if there is any pressure on performance. There is no hotel introduction to the guests. I only saw a map in the room card when I checked out. When I went to other hotels before, they would tell me the order. What is included, and where can the location be used (or give me a very clear paper description), the Disney front desk does not care about any other work except sales, I have a Mickey Club in my package, I don’t know where it is? when it start? We didn't go! I took the initiative to ask where the hotel bus was, and she didn't tell me what time it started and ended! I still don't know the bus time! I just heard that the security guard at the door said that there would be no car if it was later!
3. The packages we ordered are not cheap, and we are still supporting Disney during the epidemic. Obviously, there are very few people, so we don’t take the initiative to upgrade the room type. I only made arrangements when I mentioned the need to upgrade the double room, and even gave a fireworks shadow. When I arrive at the room, other hotels will take the initiative to ask if I need a crib when I bring my baby? In the original two-day arrangement, we could play in the morning and come back to sleep at noon, and take the baby to watch the fireworks in the evening. Since the front desk asked us to provide nucleic acid every day, we could not change it to a one-day tour. I thought the front desk would arrange a place where we could see the fireworks. The room, let the child look at it before going to bed, so disappointed! The hotel really does not have the demeanor of an international brand!
4. The cast and crew of the park are still enthusiastic. We queued up to take pictures and were rejected by the staff next to the actors three times. The first two people were waiting to take pictures. We were the third, and there was no one behind. I can't understand it. The second time, there was only one person in front of Captain Jack, and the staff said that he was going to rest, and they would not let us row. This was also the case for the third time. The time is different, and we don't know the rest time of the cast and crew. This is the case when there are few people in the epidemic. It is estimated that it is more difficult to take pictures when there are many people. I can only say that it is all arranged by the staff!
5. The catering in the park is too monotonous. It is recommended to increase it. It is not as delicious as Haichang!
6. The best experience this time is that you don't have to line up, and you don't have to line up to play anything. It's amazing! But I also saw inhumane scenes when I was playing Speed Nimbus. A child wanted to play this several times. No one is queuing up, and the staff still asks the child to re-enter the queuing channel every time, and can't get on the bus directly!

When the front desk of the hotel was describing the nucleic acid problem, I recorded a video and posted it on the Internet for everyone to complain!

msg:The hotel is relatively small as a whole. On the same day, I paid money to upgrade to an executive room, two single beds and a small foldable bed. The room is really small, there is no balcony, and the bathroom has only a small bathtub and no shower. The overall service of Disney Hotel It's good, the only bad review is that there is a shop in the lobby on the third floor. You can pay for photo albums in the past. To be honest, the photos taken by mobile phones are not bad. It is not interesting for 298 yuan for two photos in a book, and then I don't ask for it. The face of a woman at the cashier has been falling down, and the evaluation of the entire Disney service has been lowered. Almost all Disney programs can be played for two days and one night. Recently, there is really no need to queue up. Children are a little tired after playing for a day. I will return in the afternoon. It's very good to take a nap at the hotel and then go to the park again. The hotel has unlimited round-trip tickets with tickets.

I feel very good about the Mickey's floor in the elevator, very magical
Others seem to be nothing special, everything is quite satisfactory, except for the boss and the proprietress who took pictures during the morning meal, I have not seen a single character...
It's really convenient to go to and from the park. I don't have to walk a lot. At noon, I can even go back to the hotel to rest and enter the park at night.

The hotel room is full of childlike interest, and it comes with two cups, which is also good. Hotel guests can enter Disneyland one hour in advance, and there is a shuttle boat transfer, so it is very convenient to go back and forth between the park and the hotel. In addition to taking a boat, you can also do a shuttle bus, and the drop-off point is in Disneytown. Overall, it was a good experience, looking forward to coming back next time.

I suddenly thought that I haven't been to the nearest Disney hotel, so I immediately booked one. First of all, the hotel room is not big, but the bathroom is still big. room? For rest, this size is also acceptable. The transportation is also very convenient, the subway can be reached by trains and boats, and there are still many shifts. After the first day to the hotel to repair, I went to the town for a walk. The next day, of course, I have to go to the park. It is worthwhile to enter the park early, and it is very convenient. The days are also well chosen, there are not many people, and there is basically no queue for each project, which is the most fun and cool time to play. There will be a chance to stay at the hotel.

msg:Summary: The hotel is small in scale and has a limited sense of atmosphere. Don't be too longing, just go with your heart! (I live in Pudong, so I made a special trip to pull ****s)
reason:
1. There is only a little sense of atmosphere in the room, such as the bedside that can be lit, the only picture of Mickey on the wall, and some Disney-inspired supplies... Others follow ordinary, old-fashioned, and outdated five-star facilities. There is no difference, it is limited to attract the baby's attention.
2. We live on the third floor, and there is no access control on the floor. Anyone who can go to the lobby (the lobby is on the third floor) can go to the door of your room. Other floors are unknown.
3. The outdoor space is much smaller than the Chimelong Hengqin Hotel in Zhuhai (the lobby and the hotel are also much smaller), and there is nothing to play, but it is still very huge when you go out of the hotel to Xingyuan Park.
4. What is worth admiring is the service here. The wife is so enthusiastic that you dare not look at the waiter's eyes. He may come over immediately and ask you where you are going and what you need... It's so expensive A lot of the room fee may be spent on services!
5. The variety of breakfast is relatively refined, with meat and fish, and the product is five-star. Idols come and go from time to time. More than 100 photos are based on personal needs.
6. The goods in the store are not complete, but the advantage is that there are few people. Since there are too few places to play in the hotel, the store can be used as a toy playground to slip for a while.
7. The children's activity room is suitable for older children, over 3 years old, a few young ladies and sisters are very gentle, and the baby can't stay here for too long.

msg:On the eve of the ***** New Year, I hit it off with the princess and wanted to go to Disney. For the in-depth tour, the princess suggested to find a hotel nearby. There are a lot of hotels around Disney, and Fengjian can do whatever he wants. After some comparison, he chose the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel. The price was relatively more cost-effective for two nights, so he immediately booked the Superior Garden Deluxe Room.
    Adhering to the concept of green travel, after getting off at Disney Station on Metro Line 11, I found the hotel's shuttle bus, which came every 10 minutes. There were few people in the afternoon. When the bus came, only the two of us got on the bus. The bus was with the Toy Story Hotel, so the first stop went to the Toy Story Hotel. In fact, there is a more convenient way to go to the hotel. After getting off the subway, go directly to the cruise terminal, show the hotel reservation information, and then you can board the boat directly (currently, the boat shuttles back and forth every 20 minutes).
        As soon as the shuttle bus stopped at the hotel, a handsome waiter immediately came to help with the luggage and asked if he needed to help bring the luggage into the room (a card with the number of luggage will be given to them at the front desk when checking in , then the room number will be written on the card and sent to the room seamlessly). From this moment on, we just need to be in a good mood and enjoy the beauty of the holiday!
    The room is not big, there are Disney elements everywhere (the most magical bedside animation must be discovered with a keen eye), a warm welcome card written on the note at the bedside, a handkerchief in the blue Disney iron box, this and the drawer The Disney mug can be taken away when you leave the store. There is a Disney logo shoulder strap on the water cup in the room. You can carry the water cup to play, which is very considerate. Maybe because there are many children, the bathtub is very low. The room has a closed window, and outside the window is the back garden of the hotel, which leads to the cruise ship pier. Across the Star Wish Lake, you can see the iconic Donald Duck's big butt and castle on Disney's side, and you can see the gorgeous fireworks at night.
      The service of the hotel is very good, whether it is the enthusiasm of the little brother who greets the guests or the detailed explanation of the little sister when checking in, or the hotel room service service that makes you feel at home when you arrive at the hotel after a day of exhaustion. (The food delivered by the hotel is very delicious. The fried beef hor fun and braised beef brisket are very large. Rice and soup are also included. The price is also acceptable. There is a thermal insulation compartment under the dining car. Fan, it's really comfortable).
     After checking out, the room card was given to us as a souvenir, and we can continue to use the room card to take a cruise to the Disney town on the other side, and even those with an annual card can continue to play in the park, which is very convenient. (luggage is stored at the hotel, very safe). This trip to Disneyland was perfect because of the Disneyland Hotel.

msg:Before I went there, I was entangled in buying basic upgrades, and I was directly administrative. After reading my article, I don’t have to worry about it, and I can directly manage it.
Before buying it, the official website was still from Ctrip. After reading my article, you can go directly to the official website without worrying about it.
Before buying, I was entangled between administrative and theme rooms. After reading my article, you don't have to worry about theme rooms ➕ hotel dining.
Picture 1 is the closet room that arrived after ten o'clock and was upgraded to ➕1100. The closet is there, outside facing the wasteland. It is the so-called garden view. The administrative service staff said that what goes up is what it means. The implication is that cheap seats are not good.
The children were very disappointed and felt like crying. The closet bed is also small.
The room is smaller when unfolded.
There are no seats either, outside facing the wasteland.
Later, I went to discuss it, and you can add some money. In short, change it. But there is no closet, and a room separated by a wall is really a wall to see ducks.
So it's still the official website in the future.
In view of this, the children were unhappy, so I ➕ 688 again and arranged Mickey's arrangement. Anyway, opening the door is a surprise, not a thrill.
The hotel's adventure activities are also very watery, and I feel childish at the age of eight.
In the evening, I ordered a meal. Except for the salty and bitter ravioli, it was really OK, especially the pizza. The delivery service can be compared with the five-star hotel next door.
Theme room theme layout administration, depends on your own needs. Like to eat at the hotel's choice of the day, executive.
But aside from the afternoon tea and dinner eaten and Mickey in pajamas, there wasn't much difference. Because you can go to the third floor to watch the fireworks, you can go to the Xuanjing Building for dinner or a buffet dinner, but I have eaten them all, and they are not very good. Personally, I think executive meals are better. Purely from the upgrade price is the same as the theme room.
The swimming pool is not bad. You can have breakfast the next day and take the shuttle bus directly from the entrance of the town. save time.
It was very tired for two days and one night. The child said that it was like chicken blood, and he went home after brushing the car the next day. Too tired to feel like there is no fun.
Because it is an annual card, there are many people who go to play all the time, so it is very convenient to enter the park directly.

msg:I spent 3,883 yuan to take my child to stay at the Disney Hotel for one night. First of all, the price is really super expensive. The price of dinner at Lumia Restaurant has risen to 888 yuan per person. I really don’t think it’s worth it. I can understand the doubling of the price during the spring break holiday. After all, taking children to play is the most important thing for children to have good childhood memories. But living in room 51015 on the first floor, the sound of the tap in the middle of the night was really speechless. I don't know if it was the pool next door or the room upstairs, and it kept crashing for 1-2 hours. Really bad review. The child has been unable to sleep. The noise was super loud, I really wanted to check out with children in the middle of the night. It is recommended that you do not live on the first floor in the future. The elevator to the first floor corridor is full of the smell of the swimming pool. The place for children to play in the hotel is not big, and the gym is even smaller. It can't be regarded as a parent-child hotel.

msg:Mainly because it is close to Disneyland, and there are early admissions, the overall feeling is not bad, but the room is really average, the bed is small, the bathtub is small, and the toilet is small. Ctrip and the hotel made a mistake in the order. When they were playing in the park, they called me several times. Some people had a normal attitude. Even after they left, they still called me. It was funny.

msg:They say Disney is the place to be happy! Before staying in Toy Story, I thought the service was good, this time I chose Disney Hotel! Gotta rant! Disappointing before staying, even more disappointing after staying
I booked two rooms and the occupants were my mother-in-law and I. Then my mother-in-law received a notification from the hospital that she was going to have a gastroscope (the health must be important). Ctrip and Disney negotiated for 3 days not to change the names of the occupants, but my mother-in-law did Good nucleic acid accompanies us to check-in, and when we go home by ourselves (during the period, we ask the hospital to issue a certificate and ask us to report), ask yourself who will curse yourself? I lied to you and said that you are going to the hospital, not to mention that the doctor will issue the certificate and stamp the stamp after you have done a good examination. I said that they need to change their accommodation first, but it will not work.
On the day of check-in, it is understandable that the service staff is very strict because of the epidemic, but Disney is the only hotel with thousands of dollars but no service. You go to a ghost place where you spend all your money and are unhappy. No one told us to bring I bought a ticket with a red room card. When I checked in, I told the concierge on the opposite side to buy a ticket to enter the park. As a result, I didn’t buy a ticket. I insisted that we go upstairs to get the red card. Check in, you can also find out the news, isn't this superfluous? The communication was fruitless (Disney didn’t have any accommodation and negotiation), and there is nothing to get the fast-track once if you buy a ticket. Before buying, you said that if you buy it at the hotel, you will enjoy the fast-track once (see you in a long time)
When I got upstairs, I met the concierge who delivered the luggage and asked him where the lamp on the bedside was, and said that he could only press it twice a day. Say, Mom, how did they lie?) I'm really speechless 😓 Are you unwilling to pay the electricity bill for such an expensive room? And lie to children
The most speechless thing is breakfast. We are 4 adults and two children. We all registered when we ate, and we were almost finished. A waiter asked us to report our room number? Said my colleagues said that we had one more person, and my husband got angry and asked them to count them. Is there anyone else who would lie to you for breakfast? As a result, I didn't eat breakfast, so I went home and consumed more than 200 photos while eating breakfast! Will it cost you food money? Will the quality be so bad? I'm not in the mood for breakfast
Come to Disney once and spend a small amount of money, and get a bag! Will never stay again! What's more, now the cast and crew have to leave one meter away, it's rare to see a cartoon character, and you will be angry! !

msg:When I brought my children for their birthday, I thought they would have a different experience (I lived in Atlantis in Sanya before, and it was clean, comfortable, and full of surprises). I didn't expect to stay in a cheap hotel in the park, even the most basic ones. There are no supporting facilities for children's cups😒The cakes and chocolates given to children are all...the previous frontal photo. A bit disappointed! In addition, in the building, the children were scared by the staff when they went out of the room to take the elevator. Don't come over and stop them all the way (it turned out to be because Mickey was interacting with everyone on the viewing platform) and was speechless. The staff said that you have something to say, which scared the child. We didn't know there was any Mickey interaction, we didn't see Mickey with Ben at the time, we just wanted to make an elevator. Of course the concierge, front desk and hygiene are still very good. In short, I feel that everyone is a little less enthusiastic and smiling

msg:The service attitude was pretty good when we checked in. The front desk clerk explained clearly and upgraded the room for us. It is a room with a closet bed and a child can sleep under the TV. However, I regretted the upgraded room at night, because the 2nd floor was too noisy during the day and night. In the morning, there were children running around and yelling. It was almost 1 o’clock in the evening that the next door was checked in and the voice was very loud. The whole walkway and the room They were all not soundproof, and kept fiddle with the door of the connecting room of our room, and finally couldn't help but call to complain.
The equipment in the room is a bit old, the toilet is still the most old-fashioned, there is no smart cushion, the cushion is cold in winter. The bedding is fairly comfortable, but what I don't understand is why the inner quilt cover is so large that the feet can reach into the quilt when the quilt is covered.
On the night of check-in, the waiter especially emphasized that the breakfast for the next day needs to be reserved, but the next day we will go in line with the guests who have not made a reservation after we go according to the scheduled time. Since the hotel knows that it is full on that day, we should make reasonable arrangements and coordination. Everyone’s time, otherwise the so-called appoin**ent would be meaningless. It’s fine if everyone wants to have breakfast in line.
Because the breakfast time was delayed, the check-out time would be too late (usually the hotel check-out is 12 o'clock, Disney is 11 o'clock), we found the concierge staff to ask if we can check out a while later, but the waiter business is not Proficiency, first recorded the room number and promised to help us coordinate, and then found us, let us go to other waiters to solve this problem, this is a waste of time.
On the whole, the Disney Hotel is not cost-effective as a resort hotel, so it might be good for families with children.

🧹Hygiene: Although the room is not big, it is very clean.

You can take bus or boat from the hotel to the town. The boat is not open for long, so you can only take the bus in the morning and evening.
As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we met the puppets who came out to take a photo. It was so happy.
There are activities for children to participate in at scheduled times every day. We made grains~ and also participated in the bedtime story meeting at night.
I was given a small piece of cake when I checked in during my birthday month. It was still very sweet and hard to swallow~~

The annual breakfast pass at the restaurant offers a 20% discount, and there will also be puppets to take photos with~

We came to the Disney Hotel just for the a**osphere. Facts have proved that there is nothing wrong with visiting it once. We went to the Toy Story Hotel the next day and it was completely incomparable.

msg:I stayed at Hong Kong Disney N years ago when I visited Disneyland. Later, Disneyland opened in the magical city. I visited the hotel many times and never stayed in the hotel. Some time ago, I stayed at the Toy Story Hotel with my friends. It felt average and the decoration was not to my liking. This time I happened to take the hotel Looking to visit Disneyland again, I quickly booked a night at [Shanghai Disneyland Hotel] to experience it! We arrived at the hotel at 8 o'clock in the morning. There was actually a room available during the off-season. Before going through the formalities, we asked the concierge to send our luggage to the room. We then took the hotel's free bus with our room card (the boat connection was only available in the afternoon) and went directly to the exclusive passage of the park. Enter the park early! Just show your room card and health code, and directly swipe your ID card to enter the park!

After visiting the park in the evening, we took a boat trip back to the hotel on Wishing Star Lake. It was such a great experience! I bought a bunch more at the park! All Halloween and Chris**as merchandise! The wooden board on the bedside of the guest room we stayed in was so cute. With a wave of the fairy wand, fireworks burst into bloom! The hotel also gave away a Donald Duck doll! Love it!

Another favorite thing about staying at the hotel is taking a photo with the owner’s family. When you have breakfast in the restaurant in the morning, there will be a card with a photo time slot. Each person only has one chance, and it’s a 25-minute time slot! Then Goofy and Pluto will appear in the hotel lobby from time to time! so fun!

Taking advantage of the last two days of national holidays, I went to Disneyland to play, considering that the child was still young, so I chose to stay at the Disneyland Hotel. Holiday prices are quite expensive, I ordered a garden twin room, 3655 yuan a night, breakfast is not included. There is a FamilyMart convenience store at the entrance of the hotel, which is very convenient.
We checked in around 3pm on the first day. The check-in lobby is on the 3rd floor and there are really many people. Our room is on the 1st floor. There are 2 room cards. The red room card is free and can be taken home as a souvenir. The Mickey Club and the swimming pool are on the first floor, but the first floor is not accessible, so friends who want to swim or the club can only take the elevator from the lobby on the third floor.
The hotel’s anti-epidemic measures are still relatively strict. No matter entering or leaving the hotel, a health code and temperature measurement are required. My favorite is the large piece of grass behind the hotel, because the Star Wish Park is next to it, so the floor area ratio of green plants is very high. When the weather is good, standing by the lake, looking at the sparkling lake, looking at the green, I feel very beautiful! 😍😍
The most convenient thing about staying in a hotel is that you can enter the park 1 hour earlier the next day. Basically, you can play well. This is really worth it! From the hotel to Disneyland, the most convenient way is to take the ferry, but the ferry time is from 11 noon to 11 pm, and the waiting time is 15 to 20 minutes. If you go to Disneyland before 11 o'clock, you have to take the Disneyland shuttle bus and go out from the lobby on the 3rd floor and turn left. It is very convenient.
Download the Disneyland app in advance. After entering the park, you can check the queue time according to your preferences. There is an appoin**ent card in the park, so remember to get it. The fireworks at night are really good, very beautiful! Overall, Disneyland is still worth visiting. Disneyland Hotel is also worth staying at. Especially at the bedside of the hotel, just press the button and there will be an animated display of fireworks, which is very beautiful! Xiao Bao was very happy and had been playing.

When you check in, you will be given a free upgrade to a paradise lake view room, and the floor is on the 3rd floor. You can see the castle and Donald Duck on the Star Wish Lake when you open the curtains. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and clean and hygienic is in place. The facilities in the room are also thoughtful everywhere. There are two kinds of bath products for adults and children; there are small bottles of hand-washing detergent; there are footstools for children to wash and so on. The hotel has 2 shuttle buses to and from the hotel and the park, and between the hotel and the Disney subway station. There are many frequency and long operation time: there is also the Starwish Lake ferry boat that can connect to the park and enjoy the scenery of Starwish Lake.
What's more satisfying is that the service staff of the entire hotel, no matter the receptionist, room service, concierge staff, shuttle manager and other hotel staff, all feel at home! As Disneyland hopes, let everyone in the park forget their worries and return to childhood! If you want to go to Disneyland to play, then stay at the Disneyland Hotel for one night. Not only can you enter the park 1 hour in advance, but you can also calmly enjoy the various Internet celebrity amu*****t facilities, just like I entered the park at 1:30 pm on the first day. , Leaving the park at 4 o'clock in the afternoon the next day, all two brushed the flying over the horizon, thunderous mountain rafting, seven dwarf minecarts.

On the evening of the 31st, it is well known that the nucleic acid test was very late, and the hotel did not provide any transportation! ! After I took the initiative to ask, I told you that I can only walk around the lake for half a circle to return to the hotel!
1. Isn't it near the map when I stay at the Paradise Hotel? On the contrary, the nearest hotel has the most inconvenient traffic!
2. If the shuttle bus and shuttle boat are canceled, do you inform the guests in advance to provide guidance? Still waiting for me to take the initiative to call a few times before asking?
3. As the official hotel of the park, shouldn't it be the first time to coordinate with guests to solve problems? There is no intention to help solve the whole process, it's just bad! !

After 11:00, you can also take a boat to the park. It runs every 20 minutes. There is more than 11 in the evening, the landing is relatively close to the main entrance, and there is a family at the embarkation point, which is very convenient. The hygiene of the room and the restaurant is good. The room will give some figurines to the children. In the lobby, you will encounter Gao Fei and take a group photo with everyone. Mickey Minnie is relatively rare. Children can participate in the handmade activities in the children's playground on the first floor, and you can stroll around.

1) You can enter the park one hour in advance, and you can return to the hotel to rest at any time
2) The staff service is very 🉑️, in short I am quite satisfied
3) I like the big lawn of the hotel very much, the blue sky and green grass are very popular
4) Disney characters will interact and take pictures in the lobby every once in a while (we met several times) and the baby is very happy
5) There is a children’s entertainment room, the content of each time period is different, there is also regular disinfection, and there is a good night story at night!
6) The pool with the theme of the human fish princess is not big, but the a**osphere is great!
7) There is a magic lamp by the bed, I think it looks pretty, the baby is a bit at a loss!
8) Book the cheapest room in the off-season + 700 upgradeable executive room (I haven't experienced it, the state of the National Day full room, you can try it later)
9) Elevator Mickey’s announcement is very cute, and some details of the hotel are pretty good.
🎀About the disadvantages
1) The hotel no longer provides a bed, only a baby crib, a 2-year-old baby and I share a twin room bed, which is a bit crowded
It is recommended to book a double room by phone or bring your own bed circumference
2) Personal habits are different. The low bathtub is not very friendly to our family, and the bath is not particularly convenient. It is also covered by a waterproof curtain! Bathroom is a bit small
3) The room is not big and the boxes are spread out a bit crowded
But in general, it is worth staying with a baby~

[Living with a baby] The hotel service is very good. During the check-in process, the staff made a mistake during the dinner reservation process, but the follow-up process is still very good. Ctrip customer service is also very good to solve the problem. The hotel guests can enter the park one hour in advance.

msg:It's been a long time since I went to Disney due to the epidemic. This time, it happened that Disney had tickets after 3 o'clock, and I went to the hotel to check in at 3 o'clock and enter the park to play. The hotel service is very good. The waiter will help arrange the delivery of luggage from the door. The check-in staff at the counter are full, so the waiting time is not long. Babies can watch cartoons in the adjacent area when the adults check in. Because of the epidemic situation, the waiter was very patient. When I saw our birthday when I registered, I took the initiative to send a birthday badge. The next day, it happened to be my birthday and sent a small cake to the room. Tired of playing and didn't want to go out for breakfast, we ordered delivery, two breakfast sets, a full table. There are ferries and shuttle buses to Disney. If you choose the Disney Hotel, you can take the ferry and enter the park in advance. I didn't go around in the hotel much, next time I want to take a look at the swimming pool in the Disney Hotel.

How should I say, the price is not high, living a feeling, one experience is enough.

msg:After entering the annual card for several times, I went to Disneyland dozens of times. This is the first time I have stayed at the Disneyland Hotel. Thanks to Ctrip's special package for breakfast and dinner, it can also set the Mid-Autumn Festival. In general, hardware such as room size, toiletries, bathtubs and showers are indeed inferior to five-star hotels, but the Disney Hotel’s IP and fairy tale a**osphere are the biggest selling points, and babies will probably like them.
Highlights:
1. Goofy and Pluto show and take pictures in the lobby are very fun.
2. From the lobby terrace, you can watch the fireworks from a distance (the executive floor and the ninth floor seem to have synchronized music, the effect is still good in the park), we will watch the two fireworks on the same day, and then take the boat to the park and watch one and come back to sleep .
3. The children’s activity room is a favorite of all kinds of Disney crafts. Don’t go to the park, just do crafts. There is also a photo of Mickey in pajamas on the executive floor.
4. Lumia's dinner and breakfast are not as unpalatable as in the legends, the desserts are both good-looking and delicious, with Mickey Minnie interactive dancing and taking photos.
5. Enter the park early and wake up late. It is very convenient to take a shuttle bus to get up. It is also very fast to take a boat from 11 o'clock at noon. It is a 20-minute boat to wait.
6. The garden behind the hotel is very large, the grass is very soft, it is very comfortable to walk around, and there are carriage pavilions suitable for princess style, but there is nothing to play.
Disadvantages: There is a serious lineup for dinner and breakfast during holidays. The hotel prices are still a bit harsh, and the regular prices are not very good.

msg:If you play Disney, it’s very convenient to live here. It’s earlier to enter the park than to buy an early enjoyment card. It’s also very convenient to go back by boat at night. Every service staff is very nice. The little brothers and sisters inside are very kind and seductive. There is nothing to say about the service. I was particularly patient when checking in and told us the precautions for the shuttle to enter the park. The bedside magic is very cute, and adults like it very much. If you say you have two children, you will receive two copies of the check-in ceremony. The craftsmanship of the Disney Club is also very cute. In general, there is nothing wrong with it except expensive. The facilities are really not comparable to five-star hotels at the same price, but the added value is really worth it. When my little friend just went there, they saw the appearance and said that this hotel is not good, and after living in, they said that they will come later. In addition, the breakfast taste is OK, fried dough sticks wrapped with glutinous rice and poached egg steamed meat are good. A variety of Mickey-shaped desserts are suitable for taking pictures, and they are too sweet to eat.

msg:I bought more than 3,000 set meals with breakfast and dinner, which is not worth it. Perhaps the worst room is the one closest to the elevator; there is only a bathtub in the bathroom, no shower, and a shower curtain to block the water. The toilet is next to the washbasin, which is basically a budget hotel-grade bathroom. The mineral water used in the guest room is also the cheapest one for less than a dollar. A bookmark in more than 3,000 rooms is counted as a check-in gift, which is really good. The number of varieties for breakfast and dinner is okay, but the taste is extremely unpalatable, it can only be used to fill the stomach. At this price, Shanghai’s top luxury hotel is basically casual, and the experience is much better. If it were not for the children, no one would want to live. I really don’t understand that with such a high price, can’t we improve the quality to attract more customers?

Whether in the elevator or in every corner of the lobby, it is full of joy. But regardless of the cost-effectiveness from service facilities to meals, it is okay to experience it. The most speechless 😒 is to check in and let you book breakfast and dinner time. After booking, there is an appoin**ent number, but when you arrive at the restaurant, you still report the room number. As a result, the front desk also registered the wrong room number to my room. May I ask the reservation number of the restaurant? What role does it play? The food is poor in five-star hotels, except that the shape is Mickey Mouse.

Lobby, front desk, restaurant, concierge, you can feel the active and warm smiling service everywhere. Compared with the earlier Disney hotels in Japan and Hong Kong, the service standards are the same.
Waiting for the lunch reservation time in the lobby for about 20 minutes, I kept seeing my aunt tidying up the sofa cushions and wiping the table top with disinfectant. She was very dedicated. Looking at the comments before, the room bathroom uses a large bottle to wash the four-piece set. The fact is that there are large bottles, children-only, and small bottles. Lumiya’s kitchen is also very rich in food. All Chinese and Western hot dishes are divided into small portions. Even small portions are also served in Western-style dishes. They are exquisite and all dishes are quickly complemented. Desserts are a plus.
This time taking pictures with Disney friends is a far away selfie. Is it because of the epidemic? There is also the corridor leading to the guest room, the air conditioner is too cold, and the body feels uncomfortable.

The loopholes in hotel management are also quite big. I saw a family security asking them to see the room card. 4 adults and 2 children couldn’t get the second room card. It was embarrassing to be stuck there for a while. Could it be that 6 people live for one. It's terrible!

3. The staff of the small cakes that can be presented as gifts for children who check in on their birthdays did not take the initiative to mention them.
4. The most dissatisfied is that the breakfast buffet with more than 300 yuan is pitiful. Compared with the more popular parent-child hotels in China, such as Chimelong and Atlantis, it is far behind.

msg:Disneyland Hotel, the happiest place in the world makes people unhappy! The ultimate bad review for a lifetime, no longer stay!
Bringing the kids to Disney for their second birthday, because it was summer vacation, I spent 8,000 yuan to book for two nights. When I went there, I made a guide, knowing that they usually check out at 11 o'clock, so when checking in, I repeatedly confirmed with the front desk that it was extended to 12 o'clock, and they also informed that it had been remarked! Then it was wonderful. On the day of check-out, I received their guest room landline call at 11 o'clock. The original conversation was as follows: Hotel staff (Hello Mr. Wu) I (what?) Hotel staff (Hello Ms. Wu) I (Sorry , It’s Ms. Xu, and my husband is not surnamed) Hotel staff (well, you have exceeded the check-out time, we check-out at 11 o’clock) I (have confirmed with your front desk when checking in that it can be extended to Check out at 12 o’clock, and she told me that I had remarked it) hotel staff (sorry I saw no remarks in this system, you check out at 11 o’clock) I (then please check with the front desk again) hotel Staff (I did not see the remarks in the system here, and your check-out time is 11 o'clock) I (then you mean I should leave the room immediately because of your own handover problems) Hotel staff (I didn’t say it) I (You even got our name wrong, maybe the room number is wrong, why don't you check it) The other party hangs up. (Ps: There should be a recording of this conversation at the hotel, check in at the front desk to confirm that the check-out time is 12 o'clock, there is also monitoring, these can prove the problem in the end)
Later, after I immediately complained, I received a landline call from the guest room. A person who claimed to be a manager understood the situation and said that he would handle it.
Let's talk about the hotel. The price of 8000 yuan does not include breakfast for two nights during the summer vacation. The price/performance ratio is really low. This is said to be their fifth anniversary, but the hotel toilets, showers, and washing supplies are really shabby and cheap, not as good as ordinary express hotels. And the room is small and pitiful.
Let’s talk about traffic again: If you are like me and want to make this hotel convenient to Disney, then you are wrong. From the hotel to the park, take their bus, 20 minutes, ten minutes by boat, so there is no The so-called convenience. All in all, the experience this time was really terrible.
By the way, the crib forgot to take pictures. It is a kind of folding simple crib that costs more than 100 yuan on the Internet. I was shocked to see the place where I made money for the child, so I didn't care about it.

At 10:00 p.m., I called Ctrip and said that I called the hotel 2 hours late and would not give me a refund, and it was a black gold member, which is useless! I have a hunch that there will be a huge crowd at Disney on Halloween, the risk factor will increase greatly, and the opportunity to rein in the precipice will be deprived! In this way, I was forced to win the bid, catch up with the epidemic, and isolate the whole family! Learning stalls, work stalls!

We were in a hurry to catch the plane and disagreed. She said that the inspection is the service of every citizen, don't you know, and then they The three of them chased us from the gate of the park to the pier where we took the boat back to the hotel.

Some staff members pushed the children and didn't let them get close! Didn't you let the children communicate? Mickey is even more outrageous. If you don't eat the hotel buffet, you can't take pictures! The hotel has nothing except charging various service fees! The room is average. I suggest you stay in Toy Story or the surrounding B&Bs are good! Also, breakfast is more than 300 per person, which is too much! It feels like this hotel has nothing except charging!

msg:What 5 diamond hotel? The management is chaotic. If it is not a management problem, it is a pit for customers, a super pit. I booked two nights from 9.12 to 9.14. On the night I checked in, the hotel front desk called to inform the typhoon all-day park that the park would be closed the next day. Then I went to the front desk to ask because I made a reservation with Ctrip. The front desk told me to communicate with Ctrip. Before noon the next day, I agreed to check out early by communicating with Ctrip, and told me to go directly to the front desk to check out normally and leave the rest to them. sky). It’s been a month now, the order is confirmed, and Disney directly turned his face and denied it, and said that I stayed for two nights. I provided the taxi record of my early departure and the hotel record I booked next, including the hotel’s running order (my room Fees and meals), Disney Hotel didn’t admit it, and said I only stayed for two nights, so may I ask, in a hotel as big as you, you can’t find out how many nights guests stay in a hotel? If I lied, you can prove it. Is it okay to check the monitoring? Is it difficult for the guests to check in and check out? Are you unwilling to check or just want to cheat the guests? On the day of the typhoon, many left the hotel early (of course, there are also The guest who left the hotel normally) was checking out, and I repeatedly confirmed with the front desk that the front desk also recorded my room number with a small book and called twice on the day I left the store. I called once the next day and told me to The next time I come to play, I can get a skip-the-line benefit as compensation. If I don’t leave the store normally, how can your staff make this call saying that there is a benefit. Such a simple check-in and check-out time is not clear, what is the pit? Don't think that your hotel is too big, you can still make a complaint phone, and remind other parents and friends, don't stay in a hotel when you go to Disney, it's really a pit. The following picture 1 and 2 are my taxi records, and picture 3 is the check-in flow of another hotel of mine. I marked the room rate for the day.

msg:Ctrip booked two rooms for people, one for the name, one for the guest, and the other for mine. The guest arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night and said that I was not allowed to stay in my absence, and that I had to use my name to open the room! After tossing for half an hour, I couldn't figure it out. 3 adults and 2 children were in the hall at half past eleven. Don't be tired. Finally, one of the rooms was kind enough to upgrade me to the same room as the next day, allowing 3 adults and 2 children to live in one room. Coordinating Ctrip for half a day will not refund! The key to more than 5,000 rooms is wasted. They went to breakfast in the morning and they didn't have to ask for another two. Since there is no refund, why are 4 breakfasts for 2 people only, and why are they not allowed to give back for 2 people. Since you have to book your name to live in the middle of the night, why not give up if you can't do it? Why let them live first if you don't give up? I'll make up the formalities early in the morning. Is this logic because you are special in China? Are special cows particularly powerful? There is no non-compliance with the process, right? Great! Disney Golden Diamond members have never commented much, not to mention a bad review. But you are so unreasonable, so you use the rules to embody the cows, let the 5-year-old and 8-month-old babies and the three ladies from Hongqiao rush over in the lobby at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night to tangle the rules! I have to say yours!

The room facilities are poor, the front desk service is poor, and the telephone front desk does not wait for the customer to hang up the phone before dropping the phone, which is unheard of in any five-star hotel. When encountering problems, first emphasize the reasons. For example, if the toothbrush is required to emphasize that the national regulations are not suitable, the toothbrush will continue to hit the door many times while the guest has responded to crawling down from the bed. Obviously emphasized not to deliberately arrange the first and last rooms, and deliberately make things difficult for changing rooms. All in all very bad very bad very bad, will not come again.

msg:房間對小孩危險，有隱患，早上孩子光着腳在房間走着，劃上了一個大口子，流血很多。孩子的媽傷心難過着，被帶到樂園園區護理站，護士沖洗一下傷口，沒有上葯，包個紗布，結束。￼唉…家長們帶孩子入住酒店要多注意孩子啊。隱患有沒有處理，沒人關心，衹關心快打掃完，讓下一組客人來入住。酒店沒有人為此事道歉，也不覺得要道歉。

我們東西放好去小鎮吃飯，感受一下環境，再回來妹妹睡了午覺。哥哥去參加酒店活動。有個尋寶的活動，拿了貼紙。三點去樂園。玩到晚上看好煙花坐船回來。酒店房間裏的迪士尼動畫片隨便看，中英文版的。
孩子太累了，我們放棄了早鳥入場。等到10點的酒店活動，但是因為來不及做了，最後服務員送了我們兩個成品。非常感謝。
最後一張圖是酒店頂樓看煙花的角度。

msg:我們是週六入住，提前週三的時候預訂房間，3544含雙早訂的豪華景觀雙床房。如果準備早點去，➕1100升行政房的，可以選擇先定不含雙早的景觀房然後升級。行政房就含有下午茶、晚飯和次日早飯。感覺升行政房更適合三口之家👨👩👧，因為晚上還含有睡前故事和米奇老闆來説晚安。
	
🧸我們是中午的時候去辦理入住，下午3:00才可以入住酒店，所以可以先寄存行李。中午還是每隔一個小時，布魯託就會出來和大家合影拍照，也會來表演。中午的時候還觀賞到了一段歌唱表演，氛圍感一下子就來了！
	
🎫可以直接在禮賓處購買半日票或全日票。提前一天購買的話還送兩個快速通道，晚上11點前訂購即可
🍬趁等星願船的時候，先去酒店裡自帶的商品店逛逛（裏面可以買到需要抽簽才能買的聖誕商品，相當於送一次抽簽）。目前商店裡是有聖誕達菲、olu、託尼、星黛露、玲娜貝兒的ss和星黛露、玲娜貝兒的掛件，偵探貝兒沒看到
	
🍜等待的過程中，還去了酒店自帶的餐廳，大概人均100➕，東西還挺好吃的，裏面有很經典的粉色玲娜貝兒棒冰
	
🎠星願船最早一班是14:15開始，每十分鐘一班，到迪士尼樂園衹要5分鐘！不要太方便！我們到了樂園門口，逛了半小時門口的商店，然後拿着半日票直接進園開始玩了😍

三是浴室設施比較低檔，浴簾還有坐便居然沒有緩沖蓋。再不是星級酒店，至少也是4000多一晚的酒店。

設施老舊 又貴又不含早餐
建議選擇玩具酒店或者附近的酒店更划算

1、有7:30早一小時入園特權，但酒店半日門票也不划算一大一小總價523，酒店買全日票1000+，其他平台上870一大一小全日票
2、一早的飛機10點多到了，不讓入住，也不給免費升級房型，有壁櫥的房間要加200，説加錢也行畢竟酒店一晚就4k了，加錢的時候又説沒房了，原因是沒有提前備註，體驗感真的不好，真不值得。很多五星級酒店中午到也能住，就樂園酒店不行非要等到下午三點入住

説下好的地方：酒店的設備挺齊全的，燒水和煮咖啡的機器真的挺智能方便。小朋友的床很軟，沐浴露洗髮水分成人和小朋友兩種，還配備了洗衣液和身體乳。有小朋友的小禮物和床頭燈，貼心。
一間房五千多一晚，除非你特別有錢，不然就別輕易嘗試了。

早上7點到酒店前台去辦入住，被酒店告知預訂人姓名不符，拒絕入住！ 帶了兩個長者 兩個小孩.並且孩子不到一歲還在鋪乳期。
跟酒店，平台協商15個小時以上，並且提供了規定的相關證明。晚上10點從園區出來，還被告知無法入住….帶着小孩的我頓時崩潰，很無助 很失望.
被逼無奈之下在迪士尼平台官網花費6319元高價兩倍 定的房間。全家人才得以入住！！入住之後。找本平台溝通還被告知不能退款！！！退款需要等待2個月以上？
第一次被這樣對待。很失望 對酒店管理 打問號？對平台的顧客權益打問號❓

平台對自己説的話很不負責任，關於退款一直明日復明日。處理問題一直都是推脱再三
酒店是機器人，帶着不到三歲的孩子和在鋪乳期小小孩。真的是這次被攜程 迪士尼酒店如此玩弄…

msg:酒店地理位置很好，去樂園有接駁車非常方便，到達酒店下車就會有行李員幫助下行李，還會幫忙送到房間，房間設施設備我也是很喜歡的，尤其是在酒店頂樓就能看見煙花🎆，客房送餐也很不錯。
接下去就是這次入住給我帶來的所有困擾
1.入住的時候前台小姐姐和我還有我的朋友介紹説是有兩種出入方式，一種就是接駁巴士，還有一種是星願湖輪渡，和我們説第二天要去樂園坐輪渡的話要在11點以後，今天12:30我和我朋友逛完樂園已經很累了，打算返回酒店，想起小姐姐介紹的可以坐輪渡，在輪渡台等了半小時，才發現人家是週五週六週日有，週二不開放，最後又走了很大一段路去做接駁車。既然沒有開放，就完全可以不用介紹啊。
2.在早餐廳用早餐，我和我朋友把房卡放在座位（當時我們覺得房卡放在桌子上，起碼代表這裏的人還沒走）去取了個餐，前後沒超過5分鐘，回來發現我們的餐位被翻枱了，並且房卡和房卡袋（上面還有標註房號）一起丟失了。雖然餐廳的小姐姐積極幫我們調查了，被告知可能是個小朋友誤拿走了，讓我們自己去前台補房卡，但是當時房間內還有一些貴重物品，很怕房卡丟了被人誤開門，也就快速的用完餐回房間，整理行李了。
3.從遊樂園回來後已經很累了，當時已經是累的一步都不想走了，需要找個地方休息一下，就單純想要吃個午飯，詢問了大堂服務員帶我們去了巴斯克酒廊，服務員拿出了兩份菜單，當我們選擇好用西餐後才被告知西餐在隔壁，加果要用西餐就要去隔壁，然後我們選擇換一份菜單改用中餐，我朋友想要購買軟飲，又被服務員建議：我們這邊軟飲要收15%的服務費，我還是建議您去隔壁餐廳。但我們入住晚上點過客房送餐，很早之前就知道軟飲要收服務費的，而且菜單上也有明顯標註，既然我們選擇了這家餐廳，肯定是願意買單的，不需要一次又一次建議我們去隔壁。

msg:首先從成人的角度客觀評價住宿感受，硬件設施一般，房間內一般，早餐一般（300多一位）。給出上述評價是基於我預訂的5700元/晚含雙早的價格，價格與體驗還是有差距的。辦理入住時等待時間略微長一點。
其次從孩子的角度説説，酒店離迪士尼很近，可以乘船到樂園，20分鐘一班很方便；酒店到處充滿了迪士尼動畫的元素，年齡小的孩子很喜歡，稍大點的孩子可能就沒那麼興奮了。
房間面積正比普通標間大一些，沒有陽台，窗户也不能開，房間比較高，有兩張1.4米的單人床，適合二孩家庭，大人帶小孩子一起睡可以，孩子稍大點可能就擁擠了，電視機有很多迪士尼動畫電影國語版的，孩子很喜歡看，8月份被褥略潮，我定的房型電視櫃下還有一個摺疊小床，孩子很喜歡；衞生間比較寬敞，就是淋浴稍微簡陋些，但是夠用；早餐在一樓，餐廳是動畫片美女與野獸的風格，早餐花樣不是很多，品質還不錯；酒店大堂和早餐餐廳有成人扮的卡通人物，可以合影。
最後評價，一切為了孩子吧，再貴也應該體驗一晚。

缺點:酒店隔音效果較差，隔壁房間開開關，關櫃門的聲音很清晰，走廊聲音不用説了。枕頭睡着不舒服，感覺對不起酒店這個房價。早餐時有迪士尼卡通人物出來，小朋友比較興奮地跑上去輕拍了唐老鴨的衣服，立馬有一個主管樣的男士上來警告小朋友不能打人，感覺很不好。早餐品種也不多，對於343元再加15%的服務費的早餐價格，性價比太低。我們一家四口，特地選了三張床的房間，沒有另外多加床或被子，卻因大的超過12歲要多付230元的人頭費，而且要再付599元倆娃的早餐費。衹能説來過一次就好了，下次不會再考慮。

工作人員都很熱情。見到小朋友會主動打招呼，小公主～小王子～
小童樂園開放時間長。從早上9點開始就有各種活動，中午到11點，下午從1點開始。我們退房那天從小鎮吃午飯回來就去小童樂園玩了，然後到時間了叫車，等車到了上3樓大堂取行李，直接出發去機場。樂園活動豐富、孩子也不用在大堂坐等離店。
這週上海降温，房間的空調温度最高衹能到26.5。早晚感覺室温有點冷。

酒店處處都藏着迪士尼的小禮物小驚喜，從樂園回來可以直接步行回酒店。小孩在樂園裡麪和酒店裡麪都玩得很開心。
我覺得唯二的缺點就是房間小，還有如果能離樂園更近一些或者直接在樂園裡麪就更好了。

msg:首先説優點，酒店環境很棒，服務也很好，工作人員都特別的熱情，特別是小童遊樂場的小姐姐們非常nice，下午和高飛布魯託一起合影，早餐可以和米老闆夫婦一起合影。
下面説最不能忍的缺點，房間隔音效果真的差到極點，樓上洗澡的聲音感覺比自己房間洗澡的聲音還要大，隔壁小孩説話我聽的一清二楚。訂的是親子房，早餐卻衹給兩個大人，誰家好人不帶孩子訂個親子房啊，就算考慮到可能一大一小，那是不是可以加一個兩大一小的早餐選項？
酒店評分這裏，既不平價經濟，也不舒適，你説他高檔豪華吧，但硬件真的不行，是一家軟件超過硬件的酒店。

接駁巴士/星願湖輪渡:

如果不你不考慮價格，衹為了一個童話世界那麼你的首選，一定是上海迪士尼樂園酒店!整個酒店裡到處都充滿了魔法，小朋友們整體的體驗感十足。
1.住在上海迪士尼樂園酒店有專門的大巴
還有輪渡，接送去樂園。（最重要的一點，悄悄地告訴你，可以無限次出去樂園，如果你是帶孩孩子，玩累了直接回酒店!睡醒了起來接着玩）
2樂園裡不定時的會出現卡通人物，可以互動拍攝（關鍵!不用排隊了!要不在樂園裡太累了!）
3最重要的一點!房間，客服，以及工作人員無可挑剔

晚上在頂層可遠距離欣賞煙火表演，對於第二天晚上不打算待到很晚看煙火的人來説非常友好。
入住酒店可免費享用渡輪，直達迪士尼小鎮，很好玩。更可提前一小時入院，加上並不昂貴的速通權益卡，讓你在大量遊客入院前就刷完飛躍地平線、海盜寶藏等一眾熱門項目。

總之，經費充足，強烈推薦。

msg:不得不説，這一次出乎意料得失望。
2022年春節有過美好的入住經歷，但這一次是非同尋常的失敗的體驗感。
不知道是不是疫情的關係，迪士尼對於維護客情已經產生懈怠。
預訂的是花園景觀房，結果第一次拿到的房間居然80%景觀是工地……前台絲毫沒有提醒，拉開窗簾那一瞬間我跟孩子都石化了……雖然能理解我們在基建過程中，但是可不可以，可不可以略微外圍做個遮擋？修飾？畢竟這是孩子們包括我們大人作為對童話的憧憬，難不成這是告訴我們童話最終變為一地爛泥？
作為從未在意假期溢價的忠粉，這一次大失所望！！！
國慶的房價已經可以對標陸家嘴大多數超五星級酒店，是在消費老粉的情懷，還是已不在意中國市場？煩請酒店管理者深思，謝謝！
