msg:The only five-star hotel in Ruili found on Ctrip is really worth staying in. The rooms are decorated in high-end and elegant style, and the environment is like living in a park. Especially the Dihai Hot Spring, the 103-degree spring flows into more than 20 hot spring pools with different characteristics. Such high-quality hot springs are rare in China. The breakfast is very local. When checking in, they also gave us very special hot spring boiled eggs and fruits. Great!

I couldn't swim so I didn't swim. There were fruits and eggs in the room. The eggs were the hotel's hot spring eggs, which are said to be a specialty. You can also see the artificial lake from the hotel balcony. I thought it was small, but it turned out to be quite big. The restaurant waiters and room service were very enthusiastic. I can't sleep on soft pillows, so the room service gave me a buckwheat pillow. I liked it. When I arrived at the restaurant door, someone led me there and helped me bake the local glutinous rice cake. The thin bean powder and milk tea were also great.

The most annoying thing is that there is a music festival next door. It starts at about 12 o'clock the night before and starts again at 8:30 or 9 o'clock the next morning (I can accept it at night because the staff informed me in advance, but I really didn't expect this in the morning. It made me have a headache. I was really drunk). After soaking in the hot spring, we asked the staff to help call a car, but they told us that we just had to wait. After waiting for a long time, a car finally came, but they ignored us. The only thing that made people feel comfortable was that the lady in white Dai costume at the door had a very good attitude 👍 and was very gentle

I finally checked in at 3:00 pm, and the second room was checked in at 5:00 pm. Dinner after check-in It was already 9pm when I came back, and when I took a shower at 11pm, I found a pair of women's flesh-colored socks with development and dead skin left on my feet. Notified Ctrip's customer service as soon as possible, and a guest room staff came from the hotel, took pictures, and said the implementation situation, and then he was ambiguous and did not give a positive reply. Ctrip gave a 10% discount, and then a 20% discount. The reply is like squeezing toothpaste. Is it necessary to go to the Consumer Association to protect consumer rights? Or is it the best customer to bully if you are not noisy? I will continue to pursue this issue. The hotel is responsible, and Ctrip is also responsible. Is this standard a luxury hotel? Does it match?

看酒店介紹整個酒店園區非常大，步行超過一小時，可是到了才知道因為疫情的關係温泉已經很久沒有開放了，除此之外很多公區的娛樂設施，例如人造沙灘也都是關閉的狀態。若大的酒店前台衹有一個人，沒有門僮幫忙拿行李，大堂也見不到其他遊客和工作人員，可以説服務為0. 入住的樓層是無煙樓層，但是還是很大的煙味。意外的是親子套房佈置的非常用心，小帳篷、小豬佩奇的床品和公仔、kittly滑梯還有小朋友的繪本。 早餐選擇也很少，畢竟沒什麼人，不知道酒店這樣燒錢可以維持到什麼時候？
