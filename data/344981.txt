They greeted me by name, remembered my coffee and drink orders and went to great lengths to help me. The staff in the club lounge were amazing, Lisa, Tina, Sunny, Vincent and others. The floor attendant Cici was also so helpful. The location is great, many restaurants around and short walk to The Kerry Center and Jingan temple. definitely recommend!

Food at the included breakfast was fine but I will say...the staff in the restaurant could allow guests to be a little bit more independent and not approach the table every few minutes. Aside from that it's a brilliant hotel, will definitely recommend.

While we were waiting for check in we had to witness a foreign staff member offering a welcome drink to a foreign guest in line, however he would not ask any Asian looking guest waiting in line. That was quite distasteful.
The hotel is a bit old however location is superb. The mini bar was locked in the room so it was quite funny when reception asked me during check out if we had used the mini bar during our stay….

msg:Short version: Shockingly bad, absolutely awful - what ever you do, do not stay at this hotel. 

Long version: I arrived to check in at midnight, and there was a long line waiting for the reception. There was only two staff, but in the back there were 3 more staff doing nothing. Stood in line for 20 minutes to check in.

After check in, I took the elevator to my room, just to find vomit on the floor next to the elevator (see photo) it honestly looked like it had been there a LOOONG time, at least a few days.

Hotel was old and run down, dilapidated, small rooms, no hairdryer, broken shower, broken lightning and the list goes on 

And they are charging 350 USD pr night :)

For the last 10 years, I've spent 5 months a year in hotels around China - this is without a doubt the WORST experience I've ever had.

Shanghai has many amazing hotels (Puli, Shangri-La etc.) So do yourself a favor and don't stay at the Portman Ritz-Carlton :)

We took club package but when asked if breakfast can attend in main lobby worker in counter was confused and said; no. After I insisted she checked and confirm that can. They could at least put a sign above reception with hotel name. Bathroom shower cabin is ultra small, on toilet I every time crashed phone from the wall with my shoulder, Window could be opened but is locked, even have stop guide on it and could be opened 15 cm just to change the air, which I think is important. English could be problem from person to person. Club personel and club is good! Why such comment? When I pay 2.500 CNY per day for room I expect simply more!

I can describe Por**an in two words: "friendly". From checkin to checkout, all the hotel staff greeted me warmly, helped with luggage and suitcases, and paid attention to the needs and mood of the guests.
I have to mention that the hotel provides bed guards and cribs for free, which gives parents who take their babies out a sense of security.
In addition, I would like to thank Wang Xin for sending balloons and small cakes when she knew it was my baby's birthday. It was a great experience. I look forward to staying here next time😄

When Por**an was under construction, I was still in the Construction Bureau, but it was not our turn to participate in the construction. I just visited my classmates' construction sites with envy; later I worked in hotel management, Shanghai (non-group) hotels organized an engineering depar**ent alliance, and everyone wanted to invite Por**an Hotel to participate, but they just didn't "play" with us, so we didn't get to explore the Por**an after it was built, which was a bit regrettable. Now I have some free time, so I'll just fulfill your wish [grin]

msg:Por**an has been in Shanghai for many, many years. Needless to say, the location is basically bustling with traffic in front of the lobby at every time. Especially during busy periods, there will be "traffic jams" and it will be easy to get messy. I hope the hotel can pay attention to this. Is it possible to send more manpower to deal with this problem specifically? In addition, many commercial vehicle drivers like to gather on both sides of the lobby to smoke and chat. Suddenly, a burst of smoke comes over... This is also a factor that affects the customer's perception. When it comes to checking in, praise the lady at the front desk and arrange it. The room on the same floor as ours and our family felt very comfortable. The aging hardware problem that everyone responded to is of course inevitable. After all, it has been renovated for such a long time, but it has nothing to do with the so-called high-quality decoration now, but it is exactly what we After staying in many luxuriously decorated hotels of that type, Por**an provided us with another kind of a**osphere. People who care about the quality of hotel hardware are advised not to choose this one. The young people in red clothes in the lobby are very polite and do things. The concierge at the door can also open and close the car door for you very politely. I think it is much better than Shangri-La. Many executive rooms have five meals a day and some details are provided. I think the price/performance ratio is absolutely good in such a location. I was in a hurry this time and didn't have time to eat in the hotel, so I didn't choose the executive trea**ent. Parking is 120 yuan for 24 hours. Personally, I think it's more reasonable. The cleaning staff are also more polite when they see the guests. It's very good. I decided to use Porter next time. Oh, by the way, there is another problem. I know it is due to the hardware, but I still want to mention the elevator noise. Our room is already in the corner of the corridor, which is far away from the elevator. You can imagine how noisy the other rooms are this time. It is Room 10 located at the east end of the corridor. If you want to avoid it, you can only choose Room 09 on the opposite corridor. It should be much better. This experience is so imperfect. I hope the hotel can strengthen the management in front of the lobby. Others are satisfied and come back next time!

The same is true in the apology letter. Pretending to be perfunctory, it is estimated that the gentlemen and ladies in the hotel only serve those foreigners, and have no training and respect for Chinese customers at all!

msg:Since my children have to play near Nanjing West Road, I have always had a good impression of the Ritz-Carlton. The Por**an is the first one in China, so it makes sense to stay there. When checking in, a female receptionist told me that you had booked a deluxe king room, which is our most basic room type. The room is relatively small and there is limited space for two children to move around. Would you consider upgrading to a better room? , it will be larger, so you can also add an extra bed. I was really a little confused when I heard this. I have encountered people who upgraded the room for free, but I have never encountered people who suggested that you upgrade the room yourself and then suggested that you add an extra bed. I deliberately asked if you wanted to upgrade me for free, and the other party replied that I would need to pay more. Thank you very much! I want to make the decision myself, right? And how much space do our children need? Are we going to chase and fight around the room? ? I just know that your hotel has been open for more than 30 years and the room facilities are relatively outdated. I just want to experience it, so I decided to book a basic room type. Is it a problem for me to sleep in a double room with a large bed for one day and two small children? Your suggestion is very good, don’t suggest it next time! It's understandable that the decoration style is outdated and the facilities are outdated. After all, it's old here and the price is not expensive. The most unacceptable thing is the female receptionist who checked in! In addition, after staying for two nights, there was no turndown service. Maybe my basic room type is not worthy of this service. The children were so happy that they temporarily decided to postpone their return trip by one day and decided to change hotels without extending their stay!

After checking in, the staff on the floor greet the guests with a smile and take the initiative to say hello, which makes people feel better. In terms of food, if conditions permit in the future, I hope to add more varieties. The current varieties are relatively few.

Considering that the reservation was for an executive room, based on the previous experience of booking the Ritz-Carlton executive floor, there should have been a housekeeper or service staff who contacted me in advance. .
2. After arriving at the hotel, there are no obvious signs in the hotel’s underground parking lot telling you the location of the hotel elevators and how to get to the hotel, and there are no hotel staff to guide you. Even after finally arriving on the first floor of the hotel, there was no clear guide to where to check in, and no staff actively asked.
3. When checking in, according to previous experience, you should be arranged to check in at the executive floor, but you are not. In addition, I specially purchased the free parking privilege when making the reservation, but the front desk staff did not seem to notice it in their system. They were still prepared to charge a parking fee of 120 yuan in accordance with the hotel's practice. They only noticed it after repeated reminders.
4. After checking in, we went to the executive lounge on the 43rd floor for lunch. It was 13:00 in the afternoon. The dishes were small and simple, and it took up to 5 minutes after entering the lounge. No service staff came forward to receive inquiries. The only noodle stall chef was no longer at his desk. It wasn't until I took the initiative to ask the waiter if he wanted to cook the noodles himself that he asked the stall chef to come out.
5. During the entire meal, the waiters came to collect the plates as usual, but cleverly, they did not actively take away the plates that were already on the plate, but there were obviously leftovers on the plates, and even half-eaten plates. They were very active in the collection.
6. At about 7pm on the day of check-in, I left the hotel to go out for a walk, and deliberately did not proactively ask the waiter for turndown arrangements. Sure enough, when I returned to the hotel at 11pm, I found that there was no turndown arrangement.
7. On the second day of check-in, around 9:30 a.m., I asked in the room about the time and location of the hotel's breakfast. I was told that the hotel's breakfast was on the first floor until 10:30 a.m., and then I went downstairs. Similarly, on the first floor of the hotel, there is no breakfast sign at all, and no staff actively inquires.
8. After entering the restaurant, I was told by the front desk that breakfast can only be enjoyed on the 43rd floor. I was told that before coming, I asked the service number to confirm that breakfast can be enjoyed on the 1st floor. The front desk said: The person on the phone did not know the situation, and their breakfast was not universal. Yes, if you want to have breakfast on the first floor, you need to pay 288 yuan per person. Just when I wanted to further verify the situation with him, the best scene of this check-in experience came. A Korean restaurant manager rushed over with a smile and not very fluent Chinese, and said that we can come again. There was no extra charge for breakfast, and we were warmly invited to sit down.
9. The quality of the breakfast is simple and the taste is comparable to Home Inn Hanting. The price of 288 is really not worthy of the price.

The above is a summary of the whole experience, you can taste it yourself.

Convenient and good service. The following staff's service is particularly outstanding. Miss Zheng and Miss Liu at the front desk, Miss Zhang RAIN from the reservation depar**ent, TINA from the executive lounge, and CICI from the hotel room service depar**ent are all very good. The heating in the hotel is sufficient, and the breakfast is great!
Disadvantages of the hotel: The bath water is very small, the windows cannot be opened, and Ms. Niu in the executive lounge is not very aware of the service. She served me apple juice in a mug instead of a glass. I brought some salad myself, but I had to I changed it to the hotel's plate before letting me eat. I brought 2 mini salads myself. They were not hot dishes and had no smell. Why do we have to force customers and embarrass them? I said she didn't agree and she turned around and left. The service was very good. I feel bad. I hope all the problems will be solved next time. Thank you.

You can hear the content when you turn on the TV next door. Secondly, the bedding is damp and the service is poor. Generally speaking, the only advantage is that the location is good, next to Hang Lung shopping, which is more convenient

msg:Unfortunately, I caught up with all the emergencies that most test the hard and soft conditions of luxury five-star hotels:
1. When the hotel car arrived, I saw three doormen passing by my car, but no one opened the door to greet me or take my luggage;
2. When checking in, the front desk was overcrowded, and we had to wait in line for about 15 minutes. There were no additional guides to come forward to ask and comfort;
3. After checking in, call room service and add a few bottles of drinking water and care packages. It will take 30 minutes for the housekeeping department to ring the bell and deliver them;
4. The water in the sink was slightly clogged. Call the guest room center and the maintenance staff arrived 15 minutes later.

But as a hotel guest, I reported all issues immediately to each corresponding department. Three hours after I checked in, I received three calls from different hotel account managers at different times, asking about me in a very professional and friendly manner. I asked for follow-up to see if all the feedback was resolved, and finally apologized and gave me a breakfast. I also emphasized that because the room was full, it was very likely that the experience during the breakfast period would not be too high, so please forgive me.

In fact, it is normal to encounter problems when you are away all year round.
But why a hotel brand is stable is determined by its public relations capabilities after encountering emergencies.

I have never commented on my impression of Ritz; but after experiencing Ritz in Jing’an, Shanghai, I just want to say that Marriott’s acquisition of it is the most embarrassing move for Marriott!

Really recommend.

We experienced the executive package with exquisite ingredients and fresh desserts. Especially the service is comfortable, comfortable and elegant. The sweet smile of the fair-skinned girl in the morning, the tall girl bartending drinks that night was so cool, and the handsome guy who always walked to the elevator last afternoon; and the guest room is worthy of praise. Although the furniture has a sense of age, every small corner of the bathroom is very clean. As a germaphobe, I immediately felt happy. When I took the elevator, I met the luggage man and called me sir by his last name. It was another surprise. I was satisfied with every bit of it. It was worth it. Recommended, will come again next time.

Next door is the Hang Lung Center and the Kerry Center opposite, and next to it is the Jing'an Temple. Going out and dining are very convenient. The executive floor of Ritz-Carlton is most famous for its five meals a day. After working out in the fitness center on the 7th floor in the morning, you can enjoy breakfast in the executive lounge on the 43rd floor. It’s great👍🏻, exquisite, and there are not many guests. It’s OK Enjoy breakfast comfortably. There are both Chinese and Western dishes, and all the food I like is available. During the happy hour in the afternoon, the food was a bit lacking, but the red wine was okay! Also, there is only one big cake and a few pieces of chocolate between 8 and 10 pm, which is a bit pitiful. I hope it can be improved. But overall it was great. Worth my coming again,

msg:The well-established Ritz-Carlton has good service, diverse catering, and has a legacy and accumulation of reservations. All the employees in the executive lounge on the first day were very enthusiastic, but today at noon (September 27), a short and thin waitress was cold and did not say hello. We took the initiative to give her a nod and a smile but did not respond... Also, we knew lunch would end after 14:00, but she reminded us twice (11:35 and 11:50) that we were all done. But at the same time, a foreigner came over for dinner and she greeted him with a smile. Why didn't she say that lunch time was over? I have stayed at this hotel in Shanghai three times, and the experience that day was the worst.

The executive concierge at the front desk was warm and thoughtful, and could remember each customer’s coffee taste preferences. The room service was responsive to every request, and was specially given to the elderly. The essential oils that calm the nerves are delivered by a Mercedes-Benz within 2 kilometers. The driver considerately suggests a drop-off location that is more convenient for customers. The five meals a day are rich in variety, and the patterns are updated daily. The gym was clean and fresh, and the lost sports headphones were recovered. In short, every service staff was full of joy, making the elderly feel at home, and successfully completed this nostalgic trip.

When I checked in, it was the peak season, although I waited for a while from the time of registration to getting the room card, but after going up, I unexpectedly found that the manager of the room service depar**ent was busy and serious about checking the room, and I felt very warm and at ease in an instant . Generally speaking, I hope the hotel will make some improvements in the dishes and guest room welcome gifts, everything will be more perfect😍

In a hotel, a camera is worth less than 200 yuan, so what? Is it possible that I can still grow wings and fly? Or will the customer make up a fact out of thin air? Investigation after investigation, but in the end I couldn't find it. Could it be that I flew away?

After I arrived at the counter and waited for the previous customer to finish, I was told to queue up again. Do I have to jump in line? Did someone clearly tell each window not to queue separately? Secondly, the rooms were arranged to be connected rooms with temporary door locks and partitions. I had never been arranged like this in my life, and there was no prior notification or inquiry. I wasted an hour searching for a new room. Finally, as the facilities age, the waterproof *****s in the bathroom can be squeezed out when opening the door. I think the above are very basic things. The whole process was chaotic and the service was perfunctory. The above two problems were solved by sending 2 bottles of sparkling water, which is really ****.

I am lucky to have her help, otherwise I may have to ask several staff members. The game room is not big, no one was playing when I went there, there are a small number of books, switch game consoles and small camping toys, etc... The fitness room is fully equipped, the area is large and there are many types of machines, and the cleaning staff are always cleaning and disinfecting equipment! There is a distance between the heated swimming pool and the changing room. It is best to put on a towel after changing clothes, because the road to the swimming pool is very cold. Administrative Courtesy: There are catering in four time periods. There are not many types but enough. The environment is quiet and comfortable. The staff on the executive floor are very courteous and hardworking, smiling and kind!

It is next to Hang Lung, and within walking distance to Jing'an Kerry Center, Rui Ou Depar**ent Store, and Jiuguang Depar**ent Store. It is very convenient to eat and go shopping. Several shopping malls also have their own characteristics.
The booked room includes five meals a day, and the breakfast is also on the executive floor. The service on the executive floor is very good, warm and thoughtful. There are not many people and it is relatively quiet. Food quality is also good. However, one day some families brought their children to dine together, and the children quarreled a lot. I think the foreigners who were working there that day were also quarreled. My kids think it's too noisy, so they sit far away.
In a place like Shanghai where land is so expensive, the rooms are definitely not as spacious as Sanya Ritz, and the food and beverages are not as rich as Sanya, but the service is very good, and I still recommend it. At that time, I struggled for a long time between this one and the one next to the Kerry Center, but I still chose the brand I liked.

msg:The location of Por**an is very good. You can walk to the nearby Kerry Center Hang Lung in the busy Jing’an District. Nikko, who checked in at the front desk, helped to upgrade to the skyline room, so the view and lighting are quite good. The room facilities are a bit old-fashioned. In terms of elegant style, it is more business travel than leisure, but after all, it has been open for a long time, and the smart devices are not as good as the new hotel equipment. Now they have replaced the big diptyque bottle, which is actually quite good. The Asprey of the Ritz used to be a headache. The only one What I didn’t expect is that parking at his house requires money. Although there are quite a lot of old hotels in the city center and there are not enough parking spaces, you may have to park nearby, but generally they will provide valet parking or take it back to the front desk for reimbursement. Surprisingly no relief

It's a serious misnomer. It's really unbelievable to me that the service in a hotel at this price is so poor.

The salary of my junior colleague is low. After paying a deposit of 2,000, there was a temporary shortage of water. I just asked you to return the deposit to others quickly. *** made three phone calls back and forth to urge me on this matter. Who told me Can it be returned within 24 hours? I checked out on 9.13. Did I check out now? Just look at the time of my review. In the end, they told me that I was the front desk and had no control over this matter.

I would like to ask who is the front desk who answered my call at 09:48 on 9.15 in the morning. I hope she leaves her job as soon as possible. This attitude will really make it difficult for people to work in luxury hotels.

As a loyal Ritz-Carlton user who travels for 200 days a year, I would like to say that I will never stay at the Por**an Ritz again, and I will post this to prove it. I will also recommend it to other friends and will not choose it again. Thank you very much.

The bed is very comfortable, the sauna and bath are very comfortable. It would be better if the bath can be open 24 hours a day. After a long day of playing, you can take a good soak. The waiter will remind you when booking a room. Everything in the room is chargeable, but for other five-star hotels, it is free, and there is no welcome fruit. There is a little lion in the room. It would be nice to replace the children's toothbrushes with little lions. The little yellow duck has nothing to do with the Ritz-Carlton.

But the concierge who took the luggage at the beginning of the door did not take the initiative. The breakfast lacks more Chinese styles such as noodles/hor fun whether to consider toppings and no wontons. The parking lot and the hotel are not in the same building

They communicated with the room requirements by phone one day in advance, and arranged tents for the baby when they checked in. Although the welcome fruit was missed, it was added in time. The buffet is very rich and fresh, and the food is replenished quickly. The service staff are very considerate and considerate. The child accidentally burned his finger with a waffle, and the restaurant staff helped him with ice cubes, hemostatic patches, olive oil and egg whites, which was very considerate. Originally only stayed for one day, the children are very happy that we extended our stay for one more day, and will come again next time. The location is also very convenient, next to the Kerry Center, it is very convenient to eat and drink.

I suddenly woke up, took off my clothes to sleep, and could see the room when I entered the door. In addition, before the aunt directly pushed in, the aunt at the door asked if there was anyone in each room. The sound is loud, and the closing sound of each room is very loud, Kuang Kuang thought. Unexpectedly, when I arrived at my room, I walked in directly and asked if anyone was there. Then I fell asleep half an hour later, and was woken up again by a loud phone call. I was startled out of my dream, and the sound of the phone was extremely loud. The front desk apologized. The result was that he woke up with a fright. It is recommended to improve the quality of the cleaning aunties. Knock on the door first when entering, and then enter after permission. Secondly, make a lower voice outside the door. Thirdly: open the door louder when entering and exiting the room. Fourthly: the sound of the room phone is too loud, which is very scary.

The service staff is not familiar with the hotel situation. Not up to the standard of the Ritz Carlton at all. We lived in Jing'an Shangri-La again, and it felt much better.

It is rare to encounter a hotel that proactively inquires and helps hold the elevator. I would like to remind you of a detail. When queuing up at the front desk to check in, the guests behind you squeeze in next to the guest who is checking in. If there is no sense of propriety, it will be disturbing. IDs and information are easily leaked. It is not convenient for guests to talk to each other to avoid arguments. Front desk work Personnel need to be reminded to pay attention to the distance in line, or be guided to the side to wait. It can be improved and improved.
The hardware is indeed relatively old-school, such as landline curtains, showers, sofa switches, etc. It can also be seen that they have tried hard to improve the existing conditions. There are Bluetooth speakers and the basin, bathtub and toilet are clean. The price is very good.

The sound insulation was poor, so I told the front desk to pick a quieter room. The breakfast on the second day was even more indescribable. The variety was pitiful. It was the first time I had such a poor breakfast. When I checked out, there was only one staff member, and there was a long queue. The staff inside did not know what they were doing , I didn’t come out, I was in a hurry to catch a plane, and I will never come here again in this life. I don't know where the money was spent.

msg:The Ritz-Carlton, an old-fashioned luxury hotel, has a superb geographical environment and is located in the core area of the city center. The transportation is very convenient, next to Hang Lung shopping is very convenient.

As a brand luxury hotel, the service attitude is trustworthy and the attitude is super good. The hotel elevator is a surprise, a one-second floor-to-floor experience.

The only downside is that the TV cannot be screened and a toothbrush for washing... (see picture), it is rare to see a hotel at this price still use this kind of toothbrush that is comparable to the quality of an express hotel. I was shocked the moment I unpacked it!

The hotel's breakfast is quite satisfactory, the place is not big, but the things are super complete and the taste is good.

After I made my request, they helped me arrange a good room. I was very satisfied with the overall comfort and quietness. The room is also very warm and the transportation is very convenient. I highly recommend it to friends who come to Shanghai to stay! Especially when I checked out at the end, Julianna, the girl from the hotel's guest relations depar**ent, sent me a small Chris**as gift, which felt very warm! I highly recommend everyone to stay, it is the most cost-effective hotel in the center of Jing'an!

I have always been satisfied in the past, but this year I stayed three times and it was not pleasant. The second time I changed to Shangri-La. The waiter on the executive floor told me the rights and precautions of my stay like memorizing a document. There was no smile in the whole process, and it was completely mechanized. I thought I should be told how to pay for an upgrade since I only booked suites. So I try not to go there in the future.

Later, the hotel bought me something to make up for it. Well, it’s over, and I’m still pleasantly surprised when I stay again after so many years! There is a surprise when the door opens early in the morning! A drunk man passed out at the door of my room! After being shocked, he quickly fled to the front desk on the first floor to report the incident. Didn't he check the monitoring system at night? Is it intentional humor or surprise? Suddenly remembered that when I checked in, there was a male employee at the front desk who said +249 yuan to give me a sunny room and decisively refused. Is it because of the shock of the rejection?

msg:I booked a room with the Marriott APP, and I went to check in with my friends. I left a message and arranged on the same floor.
Check in after 3:30pm on Saturday, check in line for about 20 minutes, the children are playing in the little bear place, and a young lady comes to play with them after ten minutes, but the children's facilities are really just decorations, there are no new stickers, draw pictures There is no paper, a turntable + a big bear, and 5 or 6-year-old children played for 20 minutes.
There was a wedding on the platform on the day of check-in, and I saw a slide on the platform, thinking that the children could play, but it turned out that the slide belonged to the Shanghai Mall, so I couldn't go there at all.
The so-called Liz Kids is a paid 398 game console to play, and it will not open until 11 o'clock during the day. Really a business hotel.
Let’s talk about a business hotel. I often live in a business trip. The attitude of the concierge is really hard to describe. It is often busy and lacks people, and the service needs to wait one after another. The courier was sent to the front desk. I sent it before I checked in. Of course I didn’t know the room number. When I picked it up, it seemed that I caused them a lot of trouble. It’s fine if I didn’t get active service. After I told him the name of the courier , asked me the room number, I said I didn’t write it down on the courier, and I was still required to provide it. After providing it, I didn’t even look at me and pointed it there! Afraid I don't have a hotel to use the concierge service? ! ! Very rude! The concierge brother at the door is also chatting and driving the car more than the guests feel.
Also, on a recent business trip, 2 people stayed in a standard room, and there were only 2 bottles of mineral water in the room. I asked to send a few more bottles. The room service was very confident and said that there were only 2 bottles in the room. I don’t understand why we need to emphasize this point to the guests, 2 people Staying in a twin room, one person per night and one bottle of water is the service standard that a five-star hotel is proud of? In the end it was not to be delivered on request.
My friend is a Platinum card member. Normally there is a welcome fruit plate. I checked in around 2 pm on the first day. I went out for dinner and came back after 9 pm. There was no fruit plate in the room. I thought it was too late, but it turned out at 6 pm the next day. There was still no fruit in the room when I got back. I called the front desk and asked the front desk what time I checked in the day before (meaning I didn’t deliver it because I stayed late). Still sending, not delivered yet.
I feel bad recently, I will not consider living by myself for the time being.

💻 During the stay, we also gave you the fruits. It's like lena has asked for some help, and she also helped to solve or deal with the problem very well. The super caring service, this u1s1, is more enthusiastic than last year in Pudong Ritz.

⛱The room is clean and spacious, because the hotel has been built for a while, and the overall style is quite intriguing. The facilities are basically complete: water bar, mini version, refrigerator, shower, bathtub, etc.
✨If you need mouthwash, you can bring your own, the hotel does not have it

🥣Breakfast: You can also call to the room (there is a fixed menu to choose from);
There are both Chinese and Western, and basic needs can be met. The variety is not as rich as Pudong, but it is enough to eat. There are not many choices of drinks. It may be guessed during the yq period.

🏠The location is really excellent, it is convenient to go everywhere, it is adjacent to Hang Lung, Jing'an Temple, Shanghai Exhibition Center, etc. It's great 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

msg:I used to like to stay in new hotels, but recently I like old hotels, and the quality precipitated has a unique charm. This time I stayed in Shanghai for four nights, and I chose two long-established hotels under Marriott. The first stop is Por**an. There is also a light meal for dinner in such a location, which is indeed the king of cost performance. The service level is impeccable. After entry, someone will guide you throughout the process. When you check out, someone will directly collect the room card at the elevator entrance. Although there are not many types of breakfast, the quality is very high. The gym is definitely a good news for fitness enthusiasts, although a little It's crowded, but I've lived in a hotel with the most and the most complete facilities for so many years; for the room, I really can't ask too much from the old hotel, but it is well maintained, there is no run-down feeling and peculiar smell, there is even a faint fragrance, the altar and walls It has also been refurbished, warm and bright; a piece of clothing was left in the room when I checked out, and I only remembered it two days later. It can also be properly solved by calling the hotel.
A suggestion: For old hotels, especially the top luxury hotels, they should be more old and more fragrant. Many new hotels cannot learn that kind of charm, especially now that many new hotels have too many traces of industrialization. Therefore, the hardware is insufficient, and the software is used to make up, but Por**an's disposable products are too plastic, the slippers are at the level of a four-star hotel, and the bathrobes are also very shabby. These aspects are very inconsistent with the Ritz-Carlton's brand image.

Thanks to the man at the front desk for quickly completing the check-in procedures and arranging them according to our requirements for easy viewing. On the upper floors, the guest rooms are well-equipped, especially Ms. Liu Yanli, the floor waiter. Considering that we like to drink tea, we brought a lot of mineral water. The hotel's dining environment is elegant, and the dishes are delicious. A must-see net red card point!

msg:The advantage is that the location is excellent, and the facilities outside the hotel are complete and a**ospheric. The disadvantage is that the hotel's internal facilities are old, and the service is obviously far behind the old five-star hotels. The check-in is very slow and the attitude is blunt. It's fine if the guests want to delay the check-out time, but they will be rejected. The most unexpected thing is the two nights I called the guest room center to ask for a few bottles of mineral water, but it was never implemented, which was surprising.

msg:Hotel with a good location, but the service is too bad. Compared with Pudong Ritz and Nanjing Ritz, it is really one day at a time:
It is embarrassing to open the door to the bed in the room you are staying in, which means that the hotel doesn't pay attention to Ctrip's guests at all, and the row of rooms is not good!
When I entered the room, I found hair on the toilet! !
The sound insulation is super bad, the music + popping sound in the next room is super clear, so embarrassing. . I have reported with the operator of the switchboard. For the first time, if there is a telephone return visit, is the voice next door quieter? Yes, it is quieter. After about 15 minutes, it started again, and it was no softer than the first time. I reported it, but no one came back to visit, and I had to wait for the next door to end the sound. . . The next morning the music started again, but this time there was no crackling. . . This time there is a return visit from the manager on duty, but the fact that the sound insulation is poor cannot be concealed! ! !
The breakfast restaurant is also very strange, there are no white water eggs, only tea eggs. . And many dishes are placed in a strange way. For example, waffles and honey are not in the same place, and you have to make two bends to make waffles with honey. And the waffles don't have jams, like strawberry jam, blueberry jam, nothing, just maple syrup and not-so-great whipped cream. . The jam is on the side of the bread, and it has to be bent two more times. . In addition, there is no chili sauce next to the boiled noodles, and I have to go to the scrambled egg side. I don’t use chili sauce for fried eggs, so why put it there. . . And there are no sterile eggs in the breakfast room! ! !
There is no concierge at the entrance of the hotel to help with the luggage. The person who helped with the luggage was not the hotel staff, but the guy in the white shirt from the shopping mall. He helped me get the luggage into the car. I specifically asked him if he was from the hotel concierge, and he said no, It's a mall. . . Because he didn't wear a hotel badge, I asked one more question because I wanted to praise him, but he was not a hotel employee.

The most strange thing is: after we went out in the morning, we were tired from shopping around 1:30 in the afternoon, and went back to the hotel to rest. At this time, the room had been cleaned, and when we were sleepy, we rang the doorbell again to say that the room was cleaned, and we went out for dinner at night. A few days ago, I rang the bell again and asked if I wanted to be turned down. What was even more outrageous was that I received a call around 8:00 p.m., saying that it was Por**an's room manager, asking if we didn't go back to the room last night. I want to swear, I have been resting in the room, even if I didn’t go back to the room, it’s up to you if I paid for it, I didn’t scold them in this **** hotel, it’s so kind, never again Will not stay, bad review.

The breakfast is rich in content. What is particularly impressive is that the service awareness and attitude are very good. Someone will take a seat for breakfast, clean up the used plates in a timely manner, and take the initiative to ask for coffee or tea after being seated. All the staff members encountered in the hotel can take the initiative to say hello. When checking in, some staff took the initiative to say hello and guide you to check in. The elevator ran into the hotel maintenance worker and said hello. After arriving, exit the elevator and turn around to say goodbye. It can be seen that the hotel's usual training is in place. It really makes guests feel at home and treated with respect. There are negative reviews in the reviews. I had a little worry before I checked in. After I checked in, I found that it should be a very special case and cannot represent all. At least from my stay experience, the level of the hotel is enough to represent the Ritz-Carlton. Will definitely stay again next time.

I was upgraded to a room for free. I lived in room 3020, which was next to the elevator. I was noisy all night because of the elevator going up and down. Secondly, there are two people staying, and a set of toothbrushes is prepared. Do we let the two of us use one?

msg:1. The hotel as a whole is okay. Although the facilities are a bit old, it is worthy of the Ritz-Carlton
2. Hope to improve the power supply in the room. One is that not both sides of the bed can be charged. Even if the desk lamp is unplugged, it still has a European interface. This is inconvenient. Turn it off, there is no one-button master control
3. The same problem, it is already 2022, and the TV does not support screen projection...
4. Parking problem, I can accept that there is no free parking in the city center, but the leaving experience is still too bad. After deducting the fare, you still can’t leave directly, and it doesn’t show how much you need to pay. You have to scan the QR code to know. I don’t know why the 20 parking lot charges an additional 30 parking fee for only 10 minutes. The signal in the garage is poor, scan a QR code and wait for half a day, and I have to keep reversing to give way to other vehicles.

msg:The welcome is in place, helping with luggage and giving directions; the front desk is very patient and gentle; I also thank Miss Julianna Gao for patiently helping me plan the travel time and route during my stay, and actively helping me to check out late, making my next journey smoother. The service attitude is very good Very concerned about us! The service in this regard is really good, in the words of a friend: so good that the scalp tingles!
Let's talk about the poor experience:
1. Parking charges (not only charges, the price is much higher than the surrounding hotels);
2. When inquiring about the use of the business center (it should be close to the closing time at that time), I told it quite well, and said it was a little embarrassing (because it was off work). After communication, I finally agreed that I could go to print the materials. The four A4 sheets were printed and charged 40 yuan. When the content was still being checked, the staff couldn't wait to ask you for your room number and record the charges. In fact, the fee should be charged. Those who can live in this hotel are not unable to afford the 40 yuan, but there is no harm if there is no comparison: a friend who travels with a friend lives in another five-star hotel, and because of an impromptu meeting, it will be used early the next morning. Materials, time is urgent, it was already ten o'clock in the evening, and the business center was already off work. I communicated with the hotel with the idea of trying it out. I didn't expect the hotel to respond immediately, opened a green channel to provide business center services, and printed dozens of sheets of paper. , After friends repeatedly explained that the room charge was included, the hotel not only insisted that it was all free, but also said that they needed to cooperate at any time. The cost is not much, but these actions really make friends feel very warm, and the guests who are anxious for the guests really feel at home. In comparison, Por**an's service is too cold and formulaic.

Then let’s talk about the parking fee. After staying at the hotel, the parking fee will still be charged 120 yuan a day, but then I contacted Ctrip customer service and said that the hotel was unavoidable, but Ctrip subsidized the parking fee of 120 yuan for me. Ctrip has done a pretty good job of this.

Breakfast is a set meal delivered to the room, and calls to the breakfast depar**ent are never answered. Let the front desk convey it and there will never be any feedback. I want to deliver something, but it won’t arrive within half an hour.
I asked the front desk if there were any discounts for long stays, and they said I didn't know and asked the front desk to give me a sales number. The front desk said they would ask sales to call me, and then they didn't. Convinced.
You are really good at this kind of service.

msg:This time I checked in the first "Lion King" Ritz-Carlton Hotel in ************** - [Portman Ritz-Carlton, Shanghai] 💜 It can be regarded as a check-in of all the "Lion Kings" in the magic capital (I look forward to continuing to have more in the future). The new little lion landed in the magic capital). This Ritz-Carlton hotel is located on Nanjing West Road, the bustling section of "Puxi", adjacent to Jing'an Temple, offering panoramic views of the bustling city. And I have always liked the executive lounge of the Lion King's house, so every time I stay at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, I must choose the executive floor room! Also sent a super cute little lion in Tang suit!

The Ritz-Carlton's Executive Lounge benefits have always been well-known, 5 meals a day (breakfast, light lunch, afternoon tea, happyhour dinner, chocolate drinks) ~ exquisite and delicious!

Compared with several Ritz-Carltons I have experienced before, this afternoon tea is obviously not as good as the one in Nanjing, but the food for the dinner is still relatively delicate and the taste is excellent!

The first time I checked in, this hotel was only open for a week. At that time, this hotel was the most luxurious hotel in Shanghai, and high-end customers liked to come here. It was in 1998. More than 20 years have passed, and the hardware facilities of this hotel have basically not improved. The hardware facilities are still in the 1990s, and they have completely lost the "murderousness" and competitiveness of the year. Thinking about that year, this hotel is full of "murderous spirit". , can stand out among so many five-star hotels in Shanghai, thriving, and now they are gone. I hope that the hotel can be renovated in time, and keep up with the times, regain the "murderous spirit" of the year, and become synonymous with luxury in everyone's heart again. I would like to extend my best wishes to the hotel!

The room space is good, and the hotel breakfast is rich and delicious. If I remember correctly, this was not the case in the hotel lobby in 2010. The entrance was very a**ospheric at that time, and the check-in row faced the main entrance. Perhaps it was a business consideration to change to the current pattern. The modernization of the facilities is not high and it is a little old. It is a little bit different from the current new hotels. The buildings in the 1990s were very luxurious at that time.

Although the design and some things cannot be compared with newly built hotels, the service and comfort are not bad at all. The day of check-in was overcrowded, but the service was much better than Shenkeng. The breakfast is generous, and although there are many people, the service is well organized, busy and not chaotic. The only episode, we left the electric toothbrushes, the tooth washer is in the hotel, and no one in the hotel informed us, it seems that this should not be. About 11 o'clock in the evening on the day of check-out, I found out that I called the hotel and said no. I reconfirmed to organize my luggage, confirm that I must be in the hotel, let the hotel find it, the next day the hotel responded and found it, and sent it to SF Express. Maybe the internal communication of the hotel is a little problem, so I gave 4 points for the service. The swimming pool is great and the water temperature is high.

msg:The good part first:
The location is superior, the supermarket downstairs, next to Hang Lung, opposite Kerry, it is very convenient to eat and go shopping. The ISO service process is mature. Someone will take the luggage at the door, press the elevator, and deliver it to the room (although my friend doesn't have it, so I don't know what this standard is).

Let's talk about why the rating is low:
🧹Hygiene:
First of all, there is the issue of hygiene. The desktop carpets are old and dirty, and the facilities are outdated. However, should the dust on the air-conditioning outlet and the bathroom vent be cleaned?

🔔Service:
The second is the service problem. Someone knocked on the door five minutes after entering the room. It was an aunt in the room who said that her leader asked her to look at the problem of this room. Now that I have checked in, I will not look at it? ? ? Can my check-in solve the problem directly? I still don't know what's wrong with my room. When I checked in, the front desk asked me if I needed breakfast. Maybe I was spoiled by another hotel and thought it was a breakfast? As a result, I almost swiped away more than 200... I don't know who buys breakfast at the original price (local tyrants are free)

Finally, there is the issue of facilities. In addition to the shower gel, this amenity continues the Ritz-Carlton brand. Slippers, toothbrushes, and combs are all at the level of Samsung hotels.

All in all, it is not up to the standard of Ritz-Carlton, except for the brand and location, the price of more than 500 is too expensive

msg:This time I will mainly talk about the executive lounge of the Magic City Puxi Chestnut Hotel. It also maintains the fine tradition of five meals a day, although the chocolate is a bit watery in the evening. . . Although it is the earliest chestnut hotel, the executive lounge still maintains a certain standard. The meals provided are not amazing, but it can still reach the general standard of similar five-star hotels.
There are few people, which can be said to be a big advantage of the executive lounge, which in exchange for relatively considerate and enthusiastic service. The waiter in the executive lounge can actively inquire about the needs of the guests, introduce the meals in the lounge, help the guests serve tea and deliver water dishes, and the chef can also deliver the noodles or eggs to the guests’ table in person for breakfast. I don’t think you can enjoy it in a cafeteria.
The meal layout and access of this executive lounge are also quite special. It may be due to the epidemic. Snacks, hot dishes and staple food are all divided into servings for guests, either on a plate or with a lid. In the small bowl (hot dishes and staple food), it can be said to be quite sophisticated. This practice is still relatively rare, but it is also very clean and hygienic. In addition, the afternoon tea of chestnuts is arranged according to the head. Although the taste of this restaurant is not as good as that of chestnuts in Sanya, the style is still unified, which still makes people feel taller.
So far, I have experienced this chestnut hotel in Sanya and the Magic City Puxi. Next, I am going to go to Pudong to try out the administrative services there. I think it will be better than this experience😄

Just give the money, but you have to make it clear first. Go in the arranged room. There is an ancient musty smell. If you don’t stay, you will come down and ask to check out The defendant cannot be cancelled because Ctrip has paid emmm. I asked the front desk staff do you think this is reasonable? Fortunately, a sensible Xiaoguliang actively helped us find a way to solve the problem. First let us contact the Ctrip Hotel and agree to unsubscribe. Then he said to help us change a south-facing room. For the sake of Xiaoguliang's sincere attitude, we moved in. What is the new room in the executive lounge? It is completely saved. The reason why I am not bad at this hotel is the professional and caring service of the two little girls and the late roasting of the feet.

Walk a few steps to reach Hang Lung. Swing a little further, you will be able to reach Golden Eagle and Taikoo Hui within 20 minutes. It takes about ten minutes to look at Navigator Metro Line 2, but we didn’t try to walk by ourselves. It’s hard to say, it's very convenient to take a taxi. I didn’t take my baby to those famous attractions for three days. My baby was only four years old and could not understand it. The most important thing is the Natural Museum...Although the queues are too big due to the epidemic, the Natural Museum is really worth taking. The baby can learn a lot by checking in carefully. The aquarium is a bit unsatisfactory. Looking at the merchandise in the store, it is quite perfunctory. It is ashamed of its name. There are surrounding dolls and there are no corresponding cute animals in the museum, such as the three brothers of big crabs, polar bears, walrus seals and seals. I saw the seal and don’t know if I missed it? In short, it feels like I haven't read it all. The LEGO Discovery Center is a little cramped but the content is relatively rich. The baby likes to play with the chariot and the pedal car (forget the name). The naughty bag can also be played all by himself. I took my favorite toy and told my mom and dad that I’m so happy today and I want to come again in the future!
On the last day we left, our car was more than two o’clock in the afternoon, thinking about going back to take a taxi to the station after dinner, but the hotel’s scheduled check-out time is before twelve o’clock, which is a bit embarrassing, so I communicated with the hotel front desk. . The front desk checked the room arrangement and agreed to our request for late check-out. The check-out is also the card and there is no need to go through any procedures at all, and the service is cordial and thoughtful. I can hardly think of anything unreasonable except that there seems to be no small ravioli for breakfast haha~

1. The floor carpet has too much musty smell
2. The cabinet in the guest room smelled like a big one. After hanging up the clothes, I didn’t dare to close the cabinet door, sprayed a lot of perfume, and finally sent the deodorizer.
3. The cleaning aunt, the toilet mat, bathtub mat, and bath towel were put into the room under the armpits together, and I felt disgusted when I looked at it. The aunt will definitely sweat when she is physically exhausted at work. There will definitely be sprays here saying I don’t Kind, not considerate, I told auntie that you were not so good at the time, so please replace it with me.
4. Please do not disturb and please clean the lamp is broken, which caused a tired day of work and returned to the hotel without cleaning. The room manager called to apologize and wanted to upgrade my room. My room type is already a deluxe panoramic big bed room, woman There are a lot of things, skin care, cosmetics, and clothes of various types. The first day I enter the door, they are all scattered and placed. I am too lazy to change rooms.
5. The bath water in the bathroom is unstable and it is clearly adjusted, but it is suddenly very hot after washing!
In the end, they gave me flowers, fruits, and small cards, but they still couldn't solve the problem of hardware improvement. There are many details that need to be paid attention to in room management. In short, it is a very poor housing experience for Liz!
In conclusion, it is not recommended to choose to stay in. The traffic jam around is serious, and it is too jam within 6 kilometers. It is recommended to live in other areas

第一，在前台等着辦理入住和上電梯時，我不知道為啥在中國，服務人員需要全程並主動和我用英語交流。你可以是外國品牌，你可以提供全球化的服務，但不能westernized，中國不是你的殖民地。我會説英文，但我目前所在的地方是中國，學會當地語言並和當地人用英語溝通應該是你們外籍工作人員對於當地人的最起碼尊重。

第二，同樣的問題，早餐費為什麼需要收我的服務費？且不説中國沒有小費文化，就算在美國，你一個自助餐你哪兒來的資格收取小費的？

第三，設施陳舊甚至都不如全季呢。

但是服務和早餐品種都還是挺好的，衹是白人骨子裡的傲慢讓我非常不舒服。

4 從前台到大廳到早餐服務生，整體英文都流利

msg:老牌豪華酒店，位置非常好。
入住那天正好有個什麼活動，有明星來酒店，整個周邊全是粉絲，電梯也擠不上去。不過，酒店服務人員也是竭盡全力在解決，電梯口一直在做疏散，很不容易了。
房間挺舒適，我們加了床給兒子，也不擠，房間對着周邊的小馬路，算市區裏比較安靜的。
早餐很豐富，但是位置略少，晚了的話可能要排會隊，服務員態度很好，一直在安排，排隊也很安心。
