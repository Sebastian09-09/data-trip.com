msg:The room I booked comes with a ticket. The room is spacious and clean. The breakfast buffet is also very good with many dishes. There are many hot springs to play in, and the children have a lot of fun. And there are not many people. Maybe because it is far from the city, this is an underestimated hot spring hotel.

The breakfast is also good. The price is discounted in the off-season. Having breakfast with the Guangzhou football team players makes me feel powerful. The food and beer are the same price as those in other restaurants. Reasonable price

msg:The price/performance ratio is okay. It is an option for self-driving trips, but it is not at the level of a luxury hotel. The room facilities are just like a fast hotel. There are very few types of breakfast and the pillows are too high to sleep on. In the end, I folded my own clothes to sleep. Yes, the advantage is that it is close to Volga, you can order food in the restaurant, and you can also try the free hot spring. However, the staff of the hot spring said that it will be closed soon, many pools are not open, and the washing and changing area is also very cold.

msg:Ctrip should seek truth from facts. Can such a hotel be awarded five diamonds? I went here with a rating of 4.9, which is not the standard of a star-rated hotel. The room and hotel lobby are indeed very large, but the smell after renovation is still there. The other feeling is similar to that of a B&B. Everything is a bit shabby. It is already in Acheng District. It is not at all It's not in the urban area of ​​Harbin. When I searched, why did you put it so high in the ranking? If you are not driving by yourself, it is not recommended to choose this kind of hotel. It takes nearly an hour to drive from the city to the hotel. There is nothing around. There is no village in front and no store in the back. Ctrip must bear a lot of responsibility for this result. Why didn't you publish a newly opened hotel without a thorough understanding before publishing it? No one provided me with a hot spring ticket. There really wasn't much to eat for breakfast. Is this what the five-diamond standard is? On the second day after checking out, I saw that the score had directly changed to 3.9. It seems that I am not the only one who is dissatisfied. Anyway, I feel that I have been deceived.

The overall style of the hotel is quite distinctive, simple and elegant. The most important thing is that the sound insulation effect of the room is not bad. It is very quiet when resting. This is worthy of praise. There are quite a lot of choices in the breakfast buffet, which is great!

msg:The service attitude is what a star hotel should have, but I have to say something about the issue of selling dog meat under the guise of mutton. After staying in so many hot spring hotels, there may be hotels that close their pools at around 7:30 as early as possible, which at least allows customers who arrive early to enjoy the services that a hot spring should have. However, this hotel's swimming pool is closed, as is the children's playground. Only a few small hot spring pools are open, and the water temperature is less than 30°. I don't want to discredit Harbin after all, I am also from the Northeast. I just want to say that when your hotel is not open, can you tell the guests staying in advance that you don't have swimming pools and children's water parks open, so that I can choose other hotels. We drove for more than seven hours to come to your house to check in. You can imagine how much trust you have in you, and the result is obvious!
