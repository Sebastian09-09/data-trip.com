msg:I chose to travel to Handan on May 1st. In fact, I didn’t go anywhere because the map was too congested. The road to Jingniang Lake was full of large trucks. I decided to sleep in the hotel for two days. The view is very good, and the hotel’s meal delivery service It’s great, and the price is right. I especially like donkey meat burritos. I’ve eaten nearly 20 burritos in the past two days. The hotel’s parking is also very convenient. There’s a supermarket downstairs. The service staff are well-trained, and any requests can be met immediately Yes, I am dissatisfied with the speed of check-out, I waited for a long time for the ward round.

Many people smoke and no one cares. The service, breakfast and room facilities are a bit far from the five-star gap. In addition, no consumption will be deducted. Although the amount is very small, why don’t you deduct the disappearance fee of the hair dryer? After staying for four days, I didn’t see where the hair dryer was hidden.

The stargazing restaurant on the roof is even more weird. It is said to be a stargazing restaurant, but it is pitch black and you can't see anything. It took 5 hours to serve all 5 dishes. The roast duck was frozen and just heated in the oven. All the dishes tasted average. The serving speed was slow. Only the charging standard is comparable to a 5-star hotel. I was a Ctrip user more than ten years ago and never gave a bad review, but this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. If I could, I would not give it even 1 star

msg:The floor drain has a strong smell, and the bathtub is under the shower, which means you have to stand in the bathtub when taking a shower. The bedding was nice, but not as good as the photos. There are relatively few types of breakfast, and the addition is not particularly timely. I deliberately drove from Changzhi, between Fengfeng Mining Area and Wu'an, and finally chose Wu'an, which is a little further away, for a transfer. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst hotel among the five hotels on this trip. ps The front desk service is in place and worthy of praise.
