Breakfast was ok, decent Chinese variety and somewestern dishes, the hostess was the only staff member who greeted me during my stay.Around 8:00am  a suited make manager walked in, looked around and helped himself to breakfast. Apparently he is in charge of the Restaurant.. could not observe him interacting with any guests.. 

Overall no value for money .. will probably choose an alternative next time

msg:The Pullman resort is located 15 min car drive from the airport and 15mim from the Wanda resort, where the ski station is located. The resort is very big with many amenities. The rooms are big, clean and warm.

Things I specially liked:
- Breakfast buffet. Everything was really good and were many options, both chinese and western food. One of the best that I had in China.
- Swimming pool. There is a big swimming pool and a small one for children. The water is warm and all the amenities clean, like new. Remember to bring your own cap.
- There is also a place to play pool and games in the second floor.
- I was very satisfied with the service of the whole staff. From the receptionists to the people in the buffet. They also helped us calling the taxi to go to the ski slopes. They also helped is dropping us off at the airport.
We even had an amazing Korean barbecue dinner at 10:00pm.
I would say that this is a foreigner friendly place. And without any doubt would recommend staying in this resort.

The pick-up guy was enthusiastic and chatted with me. Secondly, each single room in the hotel is quite spacious and clean, with a great view.

You can also see the Frozen Tianchi in this season, which is very beautiful! The swimming pool equipped by the hotel is 1.2-1.4 deep, the water is very clean and the temperature is low, which is very suitable for relaxing after climbing the mountain during the day. In short, it is a very happy stay experience and a very comfortable trip.

Details are the most important. She did a good job. I would like to thank Master Jiang in the driver class. He not only explained the local humanities and history clearly, he was also a driver with depth/connotation and provided full service. Enthusiastic and efficient, many of the beautiful photos taken during the morning tour were all written by his hand. When I left my gloves on his car, he informed me and helped me bring them to the front desk and returned them to me. He was very responsible and thoughtful! During the dinner, I would like to express my special thanks to the restaurant service girl abbey. Her warm and heartfelt service made my dining in the hotel pleasant and comfortable. The hotel provided Nanshan Ski Resort Coach Gao Huayang, who not only has first-class teaching skills, but also made my dining experience pleasant and comfortable. In less than two hours, I learned the veneer technology. He is kind-hearted and took photos of me throughout the process. He also bought me medicine after I fell due to my own reasons.

The hotel's location is relatively isolated. You have to be picked up and dropped off everywhere you go. It's a 15-minute drive from Wanda Resort. During the Spring Festival, a taxi costs 60 per trip.
It is best for everyone to fly back and forth. The high-speed rail is very inconvenient. It takes more than two hours by bus and about 350 by taxi.
The lady at the front desk is very nice. She even added WeChat. If you need anything, you can contact her to arrange it.

I originally booked the hotel for two days, but the check-in experience was very bad. I didn‚Äôt plan to stay the next day. I asked for a refund and the hotel didn‚Äôt agree. It meant that the account had been entered into the system and I couldn‚Äôt withdraw. This kind of rubbish excuse is unheard of. It‚Äôs a forced purchase. Forced selling must force us to stop. Fortunately, Ctrip helped solve the problem. Ctrip is still very responsible to us consumers and actively helped solve the problem.
The location of the hotel is not very good either. It is a lonely and exclusive hotel. We came here from the Hyatt. We were originally going to the North Slope, but because we were worried that it would be too hard to drag our little friends with us, we changed our itinerary temporarily. The Hyatt was full and could not renew the room, so we booked online temporarily. 2 nights at Pullman. The difference in service, environment and other aspects is so obvious. I really wanted to leave directly. It was very cold outside the room. There was a heater in the room. At least the temperature in the room was OK, but once I left, The cold air came right out of the door, and there was no service at all. The Hyatt waiters were really enthusiastic, and the service at Pullman was not good. The room was not clean. It was too cold and there were small hairs in the basin. I...

The only thing that I think is not bad is that there is a large open space in front of the hotel where you can set off fireworks!

msg:The experience was very average. 1. I checked in at around 10 o'clock. There were three staff at the front desk and three computers, but only one person was working on one. The one next to me hadn't been turned on for half an hour. There was also a staff member who only sold carrots and nothing else. Neither can be done. Although there is no queue for check-in, it does take 10 minutes for each guest to complete. Work efficiency is low. 2. Asked about the free Xiaosha River rafting information. The information given was wrong and not professional enough. 3. We upgraded to an executive room for free without informing the guests. The guests did not know that they had been upgraded. The level of professionalism was low. The water flow from the upgraded room faucet is very small. Still changed to a normal room. 4. The complimentary buffet dinner was very unpalatable. Only the ice cream was ok. The hot dishes had few varieties and were unpalatable.
The only good thing: the three little deer are cute.

Many places need to improve the five-star level, which is still a bit far-fetched. The package includes skiing (the hotel has a round-trip shuttle bus) and rafting ( You need to take a taxi yourself) Buffet hot pot dinner (interlude: dinner ends at ten o'clock. One day, a lot of the meat that I went to at 9 o'clock was gone. I asked the waiter and said that it was out of standard today. It was the first time I encountered this. After that, I went to the restaurant manager to order it one after another. After the food was served, we had the buffet first. The food was not served an hour in advance. üòÇüòÇüòÇ In the end, the service was very good and we were served a lot of meat.) The only drawback of the hotel is that it does not have a hot spring. However, under the premise of the crazy price increase of Changbai Mountain hotels, this hotel is still good value for money. There are deer inside, and there are carrots you can buy at the front desk. The hotel also rents and sells ski clothes, which is very convenient. There is also a 24-hour self-service supermarket.

msg:The hotel room vouchers in Wanda Resort have to be paid extra to check in. We moved to Pullman in Xipo Scenic Area with the package. The room voucher included an afternoon tea set. The biggest feature here is its deer park!!! The deer farm is placed in the hotel for them to raise. They are very friendly and not afraid at all. As long as you have carrots, they will follow you and even took a bite of my larry. Haha. There are also different activities to participate in indoor from 14:00 to 17:00 every day. It is very suitable for parents and children to stay. The only shortcoming is that the heating is not as strong as that in Wanda Resort. The corridors and aisles are cold, and so are the rooms. The temperature of the floor heating alone is not enough, and another heater is needed. The hotel provides free airport pick-up and drop-off services, just book in advance, and also provides bus tickets to Xipo Scenic Area, which is very convenient for climbing Changbai Mountain and rafting.

During the Double Eleven live broadcast, I booked three days and two nights on Ctrip. I left as soon as I could and arrived at my destination at 3 am. It's Eric's shift. He took us to the parking lot on a snowy day. Thank you very much.
The hotel is located in the West Scenic Area, not in the Wanda Resort. It is very quiet and comfortable. It is convenient for traveling and is only 10 minutes away from the town and Wanda. It can meet daily needs.
The health services are all standard for star hotels, which is expected.
Breakfast may need to be improved
The hotel as a whole is really beautiful, satisfying all the fantasies about winter romantic elements, cedar and elk, being in the hotel is like a fairy tale world
Finally, I would like to say something about Eric, a cute, friendly and a bit funny brother. We interact with each other every day, which is a surprise during the trip.
I hope the leaders will see this review and give Eric a promotion and a salary increase! ‚úå

msg:The hotel is very new. Although the Chinese dinner in the set menu is very homely Northeastern cuisine, it tastes very authentic and the breakfast is quite rich. I would like to highlight the hotel's activity center, gym and swimming pool, which are definitely at the level expected of an international five-star hotel. The only shortcoming is that the heating has not yet come on in early October. The corridor to the room and the interior of the room are relatively cold, and I don't dare to get up in the morning. Upload some pictures of the scenery around the hotel, the autumn colors are charming.

msg:The hotel experience is very good! The room is spacious, bright, quiet and comfortable, perfect for escaping from the daily busyness. The hotel's location is not far from the airport and Xipo Scenic Area, and a special car can be arranged for free pick-up and drop-off. Private car driver service is professional. Breakfast is served until the latest time. Fruit, yogurt, and Changbai Mountain boiled eggs are all good. The hotel staff are highly professional and do not promote various services and ask customers to give positive reviews before checking in. Much better than inside Wanda Resort, worth staying again.
Disadvantages: The pump head of the guest room toiletries is difficult to use; the room temperature is on the high side and I often wake up from the heat in the middle of the night. The air conditioner also sends warm air, so I don‚Äôt know how many times I wake up from the heat in the night. The breakfast category is simple, the same thing every day, the taste is average, and there is nothing special.

AYla at the front desk has always served with a smile, has a good attitude and makes people feel very comfortable.
Then I went swimming every night for the past two days. Loren Liu, the person in charge of the swimming pool, was really nice! ! Thinking about the guests every moment, warm and friendly, I really love it‚ù§Ô∏è
Generally speaking, the attitude of each service staff is very good. The only drawback is that I ordered afternoon tea on the day of check-out. The first plate of food cannot be said to be average. I think it is not an exaggeration to say bad. The shrimps are all... It was dark, but after I contacted the service staff, they quickly changed a plate for me. After the change, the quality of the food was greatly improved. It may be understandable even in the off-season, and the Chinese restaurant seems to be The lady in charge also had a super good service attitude and gave positive reviews. Next time I have the opportunity to ski in Changbai Mountain, I will choose Pullman first.
The supplementary breakfast is quite generous, but you can't take the ice cubes by yourself. You need to ask the service staff to help serve them, which is a bit troublesome.

msg:The only hotel that allowed me to continue my stay in Changbai Mountain üè®


Facilities: The location of the bathtub is good, it is inside the house, but there can be a sliding door to close the area. It is suitable for children to take a bath. It is more convenient for adults to lie down and take care of them.

Hygiene: Very good, it makes people feel at ease
Environment: A herd of deer outside the hotel lobby is very attractive to children, and they will go to see it every morning and evening when they are free. Little deer is very kind and will always walk by your side

Service: One night at around 19:00, the guest room called the service center and no one answered the phone... I always said that Pullman is very good, but this incident is really embarrassing, I hope it will not be done in the future. What makes me feel good about the service is that the aunt who is the guest room delivers things very quickly every time, and her attitude is also very good

Two-person rafting (without pick-up): This one does not include pick-up, and it is not convenient to drive, because the rafting takes about two hours, and the start and end points are far apart. There are almost no taxis at the end. The most convenient way is to charter a car, which costs 100 oceans. But it is really convenient and the service is good. Rafting was totally fun, had a lot of fun, and focused! Rent those pants to wear! Must rent! Otherwise, the whole body will be wet

Parent-child activity courses: The teachers are really elegant and teach well, but the activities are relatively long, and younger children can‚Äôt sit still. It would be better if they were more varied

Breakfast: There is ginseng chicken soup for breakfast, which is my dream dish; ah, I would like to praise the chef of the full-time restaurant üßëüç≥, I arrived late on the first night, and the children wanted to eat instant noodles, but I didn‚Äôt see a water heater in the lobby I went to the restaurant, there were two chefs packing up and getting off work, but they received me very warmly, thank you üôè

Will go again next time! üíó

I commend the room manager Dai Jun~ and the lady in charge of cleaning the rooms, who was very enthusiastic and responsible. .
The overall environment of the hotel is great, it feels like a big oxygen bar in the forest. The best thing is that there are a group of docile sika deer. The transportation is also very convenient. It takes less than ten minutes to drive to the Xipo Visitor Center. I originally planned to stay in Wanda Resort, but in the end I chose Pullman over and over again. The quiet and comfortable environment and good service made the travel experience in Xipo even better.

After that, I called a car for help, found delicious food, and arranged the itinerary for the chartered car. It was so meticulous!

msg:This Pullman Hotel is the most satisfying hotel I have stayed in during this trip to the Northeast, not one of them. I gave the hotel good reviews before, and one or two of them were requested by some serious and responsible service staff in the hotel. I was too embarrassed to refuse, so I agreed and did it (I will carefully consider whether to agree in the future, after all, it will affect the objectivity of everyone's judgment). However, the five-star praise of this hotel when leaving the store is completely affirmation of the hotel's service quality and hygiene conditions.
1) I am very grateful to Eric Gao and Yuki Wang at the front desk for their warm hospitality on the day of check-in, and for helping to upgrade the room to an executive room. It was already late when I checked in, and I was tired from traveling all the way. The hotel sent a lot of snacks and drinks, which was a surprise! Among them, the birch sap drink (Picture 1, drink it with the high-speed rail, it is sweeter) is the first time I drink it, and I am happy. In addition, other hotel staff, no matter the restaurant or the room aunt, are very professional and enthusiastic, and feel at home.
2) The room is very clean and tidy, and the auntie in the room is gentle and can help quickly, even if it is around nine o'clock in the evening. The bathroom has a strong flow and is comfortable to take a shower. The room temperature is nice, the mattress and pillows are very comfortable.
3) Behind the glass in the lobby of the hotel, there is a deer house called Luxu. There are about 7 to 9 deer, most of them are about one year old, and the youngest is two months old, very cute. You can visit for free, or you can buy deer food to feed. Deer are very friendly and can be touched close to their heads. (Figure II)
4) The itinerary was quite rushed this time, and I rushed to see Tianchi, but failed to try the double rafting presented by the hotel. When I was feeding the deer this morning, I met two girls from Beijing and Guangzhou. They went rafting yesterday. They were crazy about Amway. . Therefore, if you have more time, you can try this rafting, because there are few people rafting now and the weather is not too cold.
5) There is a large Eurasian supermarket near the hotel. It is near the tourist center in the west of Changbai Mountain. Friends who live longer can go to the supermarket or go to the restaurants near the supermarket. There is a Kanto No. 1 pot, the store is clean and The taste is good and the quantity is sufficient.
Digression: The weather was beautiful yesterday, although no water monster was found, but Tianchi was clearly seen. If you go to the scenic spot to see Tianchi, I personally think that the Tianchi on the west slope will be more comprehensive.
Facilities: satisfactory
Hygiene: Satisfied
Environment: Satisfied

First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the facilities. The decoration style and layout are very reasonable. The facilities needed for any functional office, washing, reading, watching TV, etc. are at hand; there is a deer garden where children can interact with small animals for a long time every day; customer service, go to the hotel Anna at the reception learned that she was taking the old and the young on a trip and offered to help upgrade the room type and asked if a late check-out was needed. Jiawen and Lisa in the concierge depar**ent have always given good travel suggestions and transportation arrangements. I felt family-like preferential trea**ent and care in the hotel. Sincere reply.

msg:Judging from the price, this hotel should be a five-star hotel in Changbai Mountain! However, judging from the attitude of the person who arranged the airport pick-up, my first impression was that it was like a small hotel pick-up and drop-off. He was rude and impatient when placing luggage and spoke very irritably.
Entering the hotel, each room comes with a free drink, but only one room has it.
When checking in, there were no prompts or explanations about the free services included in the hotel booking. I asked about skiing the next day before registering, and none of the other items were used.
In addition, the concierge service is also irritable and impatient when asking for advice when going skiing.
Check out another hotel the next day.

In particular, I would like to say the front desk Fly and the concierge, who have been paying attention to our situation since we checked in, and arranged everything for us, such as double rafting. The recommended restaurant is also super delicious! The whole process made us feel cared for and valued. Thank you very much. It deserves a five-star rating.

The location is average, the room facilities are relatively rough, and the size of the space is okay. The deer are very cute, but unfortunately they don't have much room to move around, which is a bit pitiful. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is too ordinary, and 100 per capita is not worth it. The Korean BBQ is okay, especially the service staff are super cute. The worst thing is the breakfast, there is no choice of western style, the coffee is poor, and the choice of Chinese style is not much, the taste is not good, the dessert is dismal, and there is no small cake to match with the coffee.

My friend was locked outside and called the front desk, but he didn't answer the phone several times! No one called back later! We asked the front desk for a pillow and they brought us a pillow as hard as a rock! No exaggeration at all! No one answered the phone when I called the front desk. I called N times before someone answered! The light switches are crap! Toothpaste is also very stingy! The skiing provided is a terrible ski resort, and renting clothing and hiring a coach are extremely expensive! The hot spring is also an artificial hot spring! Not as good as a two hundred hotel! Every driver we met in a taxi was confused as to why we stayed in such a remote and bad hotel! Even the driver thought this hotel was a scam! ! ! !

msg:First of all, I would like to talk about the location of the hotel. I can only describe it in a nutshell. It is really far away from the village and the store. It is actually quite far from Songjianghe Town. No matter where you go, you need to call a car. To get to the town 20 yuan, 70 yuan to the airport, 40 yuan to Wanda Resort, 10 yuan to Chixi distribution center. There is a small self-service supermarket in the hotel. There are some beverages and instant noodles, and the price is obviously slightly expensive. My personal suggestion is to live in Wanda, at least the same price, the development there is very mature, and everything you need is available.
Then, the temperature in Changbai Mountain is 30¬∞C recently. The hotel does not have air conditioning. The rooms are really stuffy. I sleep all day with sticky skin. When I go to the hotel restaurant, the food gets hotter and hotter. The experience is very bad. Definitely a bad review. Don't ask me why there is no telephone reception, if you ask, there is no air conditioner üòÇ
In the end, the cleaning of the room also disappointed me. Anyway, I stayed for three nights, and I didn‚Äôt feel like it was cleaned from the second night. Maybe I hurriedly put a few bottles of water and left. The trash can in our room couldn‚Äôt be filled at the end. It's the first time I've encountered so many hotels, absolutely...
It is a hotel that I will not choose again in the future

The room is the same as in the picture. The room is clean and hygienic, especially the bed is very comfortable, like lying on a cloud, which relieved the fatigue of climbing the mountain all day.
Special praise to the younger brother Daijun at the front desk, who offered to add WeChat at the first time, and you can tell him if you have any questions or needs. Brother Dai called a car for me to go to the town for dinner. The car arrived in five minutes. The driver was very enthusiastic and made an appoin**ent to take me to the distribution center on the northern line at 6 o'clock the next morning.
There is also a big family of deer in the hotel. Every day at dawn, they receive tourists in the garden, and they masturbate casually, which is very gentle.
The breakfast in the hotel is very rich, with noodles, rice, fruit and drinks, and I am so full that I have the strength to climb the mountain.
When I got up early the next day and went on my way, the little brother Daijun even packed breakfast in advance, which was really great.
Thank you so much for their warm service. Five-star hotel five-star service!

Let me talk about the advantages: the overall decoration of the hotel is more particular, the building materials, furniture and bedding are all good, very comfortable!
There are three units in this part of the area: Luneng area (Swiss Hotel, club med), Wanda area (Variety, Westin, etc.), Pullman here, the first two have grasslands and lakes, and this one has 5 deer (Those who have been to Shenlu Peak have no feeling)
Things that need to be improved: 1. The sanitation is too poor, the bathroom is full of long hair (I am female, with short hair), the dust on the bottom of various furniture has not been cleaned for a long time, various stains on the floor of the bathroom in the hall, and there are few and irresponsible cleaning staff; 2. This is one of the most monotonous high-end hotels I have stayed in for breakfast; 3. There is almost no children's playground, and there is nothing to play...
The manager of the hotel who has been to the hotel can see my comments. You have done a terrible job of protecting the finished product. You have to be responsible to the boss! With such a large inves**ent in construction, it will be a bit of a rush to go on like this!

msg:I went to Changbai Mountain for a trip, compared several hotels with similar prices, and finally chose this hotel...
First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the environment and facilities. If you want to pursue a better environment and better facilities, you can choose this place. After all, it is relatively new, the rooms are larger, and the bedding is more comfortable. I have slept well these few nights!
Secondly, in terms of service, I don't know if you will have your own standard of service when you choose a hotel of this level. When we checked in, the front office service was good, and there would be staff to help deliver the luggage In the room, many things will be reminded during the process. When we got downstairs, we decided to drink afternoon tea, but the staff in this area did not know anything about the basic set meal, the contents included in the set meal, and the activities displayed in front of the bar. I don‚Äôt know at all, it‚Äôs understandable to say that it‚Äôs the first day here, but I called a colleague, who still doesn‚Äôt seem to be familiar with it‚Ä¶
There is also room cleaning service. When we checked in, the front desk specially gave us two room cards, but the cleaning staff took one away without authorization after cleaning. We only found out after we returned to the hotel. We called for consultation immediately. The front desk didn't say anything...I personally think it's inappropriate! ! !
The service in the restaurant depar**ent is very thoughtful, helping us to make coffee, and then giving us a taste of the freshly baked cold noodles.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the skiing, hot springs and meals included in the package:
The time of the free car for skiing hotels is too early and too fixed. There is a feeling of "I just take this car. If you want to sit, you can go by yourself." The skiing is in Luneng, the hot spring is in Wanda, and it is on the way on-line. The meal set tastes good, enough for two people.

The location of the hotel is very close to the Xipo Scenic Area. It takes five minutes by car. The hotel will arrange a special car to pick you up. The pick-up time is more reasonable. In addition, there are deer in the hotel, suitable for children.

msg:Service: It's been a long time since I came across a hotel worthy of 5 stars. Anna at the front desk responded to my requests, and Lauren Liu helped me take my luggage and sent it directly to the room, and would greet me when I met during the stay. The waiters in the restaurant and lobby bar are also very polite

Environment: The hotel is located in Chixi District, and there are no supporting facilities around. But the snow scene of the hotel itself is pretty goodüëç

Facilities: Upgraded to a suite this time, the area is naturally spacious and the bedding is very comfortable, but the hardware is indeed a little old. In addition, although the suite has been upgraded, the accessories have not fully kept up, and this part is still lacking in humanization.

msg:Every time you come to Changbai Mountain, you must stay at the hotel, the best choice for appearance control. The hotel has stylish decoration and complete facilities, which can perfectly compete with other brand hotels, and definitely have a good vacation experience. Checking in happened to be Laba night, and the Laba porridge presented by the restaurant warmed my heart instantly. Lili at the front desk helped to apply for an upgrade to the suite with the manager, making the New Year's Eve more comfortable and perfect. Every time I pass by the front desk, all the ladies will ask you how your stay is. How can I help? Definitely feel at home. It can be regarded as the perfect combination of cost performance and living experience in the entire resort hotel. I have stayed many times and found that the room facilities and sanitation are well maintained, and I hope it can continue. After all, Changbai Mountain is a place where you can come again and again, and it is very important to have a comfortable and comfortable place to stay.

msg:Living in such a hotel really blew me up üò°

health is ok

Environment: So-so, nothing attractive, it‚Äôs a forest view, let‚Äôs see for yourself, (üëá Attached picture) There is no good-looking shooting location in the hotel, if you want to take pictures, just look at other hotels, the location is good, drive It takes about 10 minutes to arrive at Songjianghe Town. There are many restaurants and snacks in the town, which are more convenient.

Service: Let me talk about the service I want to complain about the most. First of all, I call the front desk before checking in to the hotel. I don‚Äôt know if I ask three questions, saying that the staff in charge of Ctrip are off work, and they are not responsible for this. In such an important position as the front desk, they should have a clear understanding of all aspects in order to answer customers, instead of asking three questions and not knowing, and their attitude is extremely bad. That kind of tone seems to be, if you ask me, I don't know, whoever you like to ask...

After check-in: Tourists who come to Changbai Mountain must want to find a warm hotel, and so do I. It's too cold to come down from Tianchi Lake, and I'm really afraid of the cold. I read online that the hotel is warm. As a result, after I moved in, I regretted booking this store very much. It was super cold. I called the front desk and said the room was cold. The front desk said that the heating is not good this year, but it is cold. There is no way, let me get you a small heater, and it will be warm in a while Yes, I really laughed to death, not to mention no service, it can be said that the attitude is extremely bad, even if you explain patiently, it will not make customers feel so uncomfortable.

Price: Very low cost performance, free package, ski pass, afternoon tea, breakfast, 1588 yuan for 2 nights in the room, 300 yuan per night for special periods, that is to say, more than 1,000 nights, living here at this price, I feel I feel like a fool, the skiing is Luneng Ski Resort, the shuttle bus departs at 7:50 in the morning and returns at 15:00 in the afternoon, with a fixed time. There is only one trip, and the journey takes about 40 minutes. The driver's attitude is super bad. You must call to make an appointment, otherwise your seat will not be reserved. The afternoon tea tastes very ordinary. And it can't be delivered to the room, so you can only go downstairs and eat in the hall without a door. It's extremely cold, the breakfast is mediocre, self-service, and it ends at 10 o'clock.

I checked in on the 8th and skied on the 9th. After I came back, the room was cleaned. I called the front desk and asked the front desk. The first sentence of the front desk was not embarrassment. I entered your room without notifying you, but did you lose something? I asked this sentence at least three times, can you enter the customer's room at will if I haven't lost anything? What kind of logic is this? In the end, I didn‚Äôt turn on Do Not Disturb, so I went in. No one opened the door when I knocked, so I just unlocked it by myself. Are you a ********? I live consecutively, so I have to ask if I need cleaning, or tell me when I check in that the room will be cleaned every day. If you mind, you can cancel it. No one told you in the early stage, and no one explained it in the later stage. This front desk is really disgusting. Should the hotel retrain it?

Summary: no view, super cold, poor service

msg:Speechless, this is a 5 star hotel. The environment of the whole hotel is very good as soon as you enter the door. Within a minute of check-in, I found the used slippers under the bed and changed them. The bathtub in the new room leaked 360 degrees, the switch was damaged, and I didn't bother to change the luggage after I took it out. These are not big problems, the strangest thing is:
1. I booked the Ctrip package, which includes Luneng skiing hot spring dinner, parent-child activities, billiards room, table tennis room, and various deer parks. In addition to skiing, hot springs and a dinner in the package, everything else is free. What about free children‚Äôs hot spring tickets and children‚Äôs breakfast? Children in the age group specified in the package are free. Deer Paradise is also free to enter and exit, but feeding requires a 10. I asked the hotel what was the package? No one answered me.
2. Free pick-up and drop-off service for hot springs and Luneng skiing. There is one class every day. The skiing time is 7:50 in the morning. If I can‚Äôt get up, I will take a taxi for 80 yuan.
3. Make an appoin**ent for skiing one day in advance, and say that you can go there with your ID card. Because I had to buy children's tickets by myself, I went directly to the ticket office. The ticket office said that we couldn't find our ski ticket information, so I called the hotel and gave me a mobile phone number for me to contact. The person who borrowed the phone told me to go to Chaochao next to the ticket office, and gave me two ski passes like the one in Figure 3, and the deposit was paid personally. The package of the five-star hotel is connected with this kind of private ticket dealer? ? ? ? (My ski instructor said: Your hotel, it is also possible, this person is not from the ski resort, but a pimp.) The ski pass given to me is still someone else‚Äôs name, it should be a monthly pass, and it can be reused?
4. This hotel has basically no service, because no one feels it. The dinner is a meat dish, a vegetable, a small meat dish, and a soup. We are the only one in the Chinese restaurant. Breakfast buffet, bread and everything are taken out of the packaging bag, juice is poured out of Master Kong‚Äôs packaging, yogurt is poured out of an unknown box, and the empty plates are not taken away.
People are basically chatting and calling.
There are too many slots to spit out,,,
Summary: It may not be the hotel's problem, because I have been here for three days, and I feel that the whole Changbai is like this. Maybe all the capable ones have gone out, and the remaining ones are thinking about how to kill customers.
Ctrip's service is very good, and it comforted me with my dissatisfaction. I will use Ctrip when booking hotels in the future.
There is a staff in the hotel who accompany children to do handicrafts is very good, and the tall and thin staff at the concierge is also very good. The other staff members only have problems with me, and all they give me are rejections, and there is no possibility of communication at all.

msg:Although the hotel does not have a five-star rating, it is a five-star standard. The hotel has a cute deer, because it will help you to check out late when you go to Xipo late. The hotel is more than ten kilometers away from the airport. It takes 30 minutes to go rafting in the original ecology, five or six minutes to the scenic spots on the west slope, and about 10 minutes to take a taxi to the downtown area. It is relatively convenient and suitable for vacation. I will stay in Pullman again next time.

It is also very close to Changbai Mountain Xibo Scenic Area and Wanda Resort, and not far from the first drift of the original ecology. I originally booked for 3 nights and planned to stay in Wanda in the next few days, but later found that this hotel is also very convenient for travel, and the price is very high, so I stayed for another two days. The hotel facilities are relatively new, and the service is also very good. The front desk staff are patient. Colo, who was in touch with us, and a young lady with short hair are very responsible. Mr. Xu, the room director, is also very gentle and enthusiastic, and has provided us with a lot. Play information. The whole hotel is wrapped in a birch forest, very quiet. One of the highlights of the hotel is the deer park. Children can go to the garden to tease and feed the deer every day. They are very happy. If I come to Changbai Mountain next time, I will still consider staying in this hotel.

Pullman has always been the choice for cost-effectiveness and experience among the five-star hotels, and it is considered to be of a very good standard among the hotels of the same level in Changbai Mountain.
The overall decoration and facilities are pretty good, the room distribution layout is well done, the aisle is quiet and the privacy is also good. I like the paintings in this house, the paintings in the corridors are also very beautiful, the lobby is very a**ospheric, and the lighting in the guest rooms and public areas is very beautiful;
The view of the forest view room is very good. The forest path outside the window is very relaxing. This time, I upgraded the executive room. The room is very spacious, the TV is very big and it is great to watch the World Cup. ;
Let me talk about the improvement points: the design of the bathtub is unreasonable, and it took me a long time to change the water outlet, and the drain plug can't be screwed; the breakfast selection is relatively small, and there are no knives and forks for the tableware;
Finally, I would like to praise the platform: the hotel coupons are too cost-effective ~ the customer service is awesome!

msg:It should be the most cost-effective hotel in Changbai Mountain during the peak season. At the same price, you can only live in a small room of 25 square meters in Wanda. Here you can live in a suite of 90 square meters. You can see the snow scene from the large balcony. Tina at the front desk is very kind, and the overall service and staff attitude It's all very good. The important thing is that the hotel also has deer, which can be fed and photographed.

msg:It is a five-star resort hotel with high cost performance on the west slope of Changbai Mountain. It is only a few minutes' drive from the west slope distribution center. The hotel also seems to provide shuttle service. Because there is no mountain view, and it is also a certain distance from the ski resort, there is nothing to play in or near the hotel entrance, and it is about a 20-minute drive from Wanda Town. The hotel has a small sika deer that can interact, which is a major feature, but because of the relationship between yq and yq, many entertainment facilities have been closed. When I went there, only a gym, a pool table, and a children's playground were opened. In addition, many detailed facilities in the hotel are lack of repair, and there are potential safety hazards. For example, in the corridors of the five floors, there are a lot of upturned wall decorations. If there are children running past, it is very easy to cause safety accidents. The silicone of the toilet sliding door in the room is dry and cracked, and the sliding door will make a harsh noise. The toilet does not feel reinforced, and when you get up and sit down, you will feel the vibration.

Songjianghe Town has a lot of delicious food, and the average per capita is 50. It is more convenient to rent a car. You can't use the meter to take a taxi here. It costs 40 yuan for 10 minutes. In Tianchi, if the west slope is near here, you have to climb the stairs, and some elderly people may not be able to climb it. The North Slope Tianchi is not good-looking. Nanpo Tianchi is beautiful and there are few people, but it takes a long time to open and there are many border inspections. By personal choice, we went to all three.

Service: very nice thanks to the staff, gentle and just right service, saw me with my child and even upgraded the room!
The facilities are complete, the swimming pool is also very beautiful
The bed in the room is so comfortable, I don't know why the mattress and bedding are the most comfortable I have ever slept in.

The breakfast ü•£ is rich in variety and tastes very good, the coffee machine needs some maintenance

The dinner provided in the Ctrip package was unexpectedly delicious. The two-person package could not be eaten at all, it should be the amount of four people.


I will leave Changbai Mountain tonight. This trip is very

Very satisfied, the hotel is comfortable to live in, the staff service is very good, the check in front desk helps with luggage and guides you to the room, and also takes the initiative to ask if you need coffee and black tea during breakfast.
The geographical location is also good. It is very close to the west slope of the Changbai Mountain West Slope Tourist Distribution Center and the drifting place.
Personally feel that it is more convenient than living in Wanda Resort, and the price is very high. Will recommend friends to stay when they travel to Changbai Mountain.

We took the high-speed rail to Changbai Mountain Station and lived in Changbai Mountain Building (Jilin Forest Engineering). The hardware is not bad and the transportation is convenient. The next day, we climbed the North Slope and Tianchi Lake. It was a virtual trip; after a brief rest, we took a taxi to Xipo Scenic Spot on the third day, checked into Pullman, and started an unforgettable vacation experience. The hotel staff were warm and polite, and carefully introduced the hotel's internal facilities and surrounding attractions. The room is large, the bedding is comfortable, and there is a birch forest behind it. In the morning, the cuckoo's call can be vaguely heard. The swimming pool and table tennis room are very good. I took the children to play for two days. We all eat at the hotel. The food is not large but the taste is very good. The family is full of praise. There are two sika deer on the first floor, docile and lovely. The hotel is very large as a whole, and it was not fully open during the epidemic. It seems that supporting facilities are being built around it. After a while, it should be a more perfect resort model. All in all, it was a good holiday experience.

üçÉEnvironment: Although there is nothing next to the hotel, it better protects the beautiful scenery. When I went to Wanda and Luneng, the snow was basically shoveled very cleanly. The Pullman Hotel can see that it is covered with white snow. After walking around the hotel, there is a mountain behind, and the snow scene is very beautiful;
üöó Transportation: 6 kilometers away from Songjianghe Town, 15 yuan for a taxi, about 10 kilometers away from Wanda Resort, the landing nucleic acid will go to Wanda for testing (before 5 pm);

üîîService: Very mature hotel service, whether it is check-in (and upgraded executive room), booking ski transfers, etc., it is very efficient. On the first night, a large plate of fruits was given as a welcome gift, and I called to ask on the second night. After a while, he was given a plate of fruit. On the last day to go skiing in Luneng, the pick-up and drop-off was at 3:00, directly helping us check out until 4:00 ü§óü§ó
The two deer in the hotel are also very cute. Taking pictures and building a snowman is so fun. In short, I highly recommend it üò¨üò¨

msg:Let's talk about the advantages first: the hotel environment is not to be said, it is really good, the view is very wide, it is very quiet, the actual area is very large, and there is a place to walk around the hotel at the back, although it is not developed, it is enough. All rooms have balconies, which is the finishing touch. The decoration is exquisite, which forms a good contrast with Wanda's high price and low price. The appearance is in line with my ideal image of a resort hotel.
There are really many disadvantages! !
1. Service is almost equal to 0. There is no welcome or greeting at the front desk check in. After checking in, I found that the room was not cleaned thoroughly (it can be said that it was not cleaned), and I called the front desk and was told that cleaning service could not be provided. No apology was expressed. After expressing that he wanted to change the room, he was told that there was only one room, which was arranged in the farthest building, and the landscape and room size had shrunk greatly. There are not many rooms with lights turned on from the balcony, so it is not difficult to make people not angry. In addition, it took 3 calls and 30 minutes to request room service the next day. There is no service staff in such a big hotel?
2. If it is winter, stay cautiously if you are afraid of cold. There seems to be no heating in the room, only air conditioning, and the estimated temperature is around 0 degrees in the morning. The hallway is full of radiators, but the valves are all closed. This is the first time I have encountered such a cost-saving hotel in the Northeast.
3. The lights are too dim, you really can't find your way back at night, please leave the street lights at least.

To sum up with my friends, it is really a pity that such a large hotel has operated like this. As a guest who often chooses hotels under Accor, Pullman Changbai Mountain is really disappointed to operate like this. The environment is not inferior to that of Wanda Luneng next door, and the cost performance is far superior to the surrounding area, but it is a pity that it cannot operate and manage well.

üçÉEnvironment: There are 2 deer to take pictures, the overall environment is not too luxurious

üîîService: The service is average. After waiting for half an hour to send a bottle of mineral water, I still got it at the front desk.

The place is large with enough negative oxygen ions, as if entering a forest park. The hotel specially provides guests with free bicycles to walk around.
Staggered peak tour, the hotel gives the room a free upgrade, very warm.
In addition, the hotel is obviously more convenient than other hotels whether it is going in and out of the airport, eating in a nearby town, or going to the scenic spot.
Special thanks to the hotel butler for sending the missing items to Shanghai.

The service is unsatisfactory. From the front desk to the concierge to the breakfast room, I am generally indifferent, and I can't feel the warmth and service that a resort hotel should have.
The sliding door of the toilet is designed to be flashy, very difficult to pull, and to pull
After getting on, you have to get out of the bathtub sideways, which is inconvenient
The shower and toilet share a sliding door, and there is no handle on the inside, which makes it difficult to pull up.

There should be a lot of guests going to Beipo to leave earlier, right? Breakfast is not bad, I make a sandwich every day. The downside is that the bath water is too small...
I am very satisfied with everything else. The hotel is built in the woods and the air is very good. It is also beautiful to get up early for a walk, or to drink coffee on the balcony when you are not going out to play.
I am traveling by car. Although there are no restaurants next to the hotel, there are many restaurants in a tourist town within 10 minutes of driving. It will be Songjianghe Town within 10 minutes of opening. There are more and cheaper restaurants.

The only flaw is the breakfast. It‚Äôs okay for the residents to switch to split meals to reduce waste, but there are too few types, only bread, noodles, omelette, fried sausage, three kinds of fruits, and only vegetables. Rape and enoki mushrooms cooked in noodles, it is recommended that breakfast should be enriched as much as possible even in special circumstances. After all, breakfast is an important item that reflects the standard of a five-star hotel.

Every employee of the hotel has a very good service attitude. Because it is the peak season, the front desk staff were busy when I checked in when I arrived. Among them, the service of doris Li left a deep impression on me. It took a long time for the guest to check in before me. She raised her head and greeted me with a smile from time to time. I‚Äôm sorry to say that I‚Äôve been waiting for a long time. This detail made me feel that she cares about my existence. Waiting has become less boring. It's finally my turn, but who thinks that my Ctrip order has a problem that I haven't encountered before. Doris Li made several phone calls with another beauty service to solve the problem for me and checked in. Here I feel the star-rated service at home, the room experience is also very comfortable, I will choose to stay next time.

msg:The hardware facilities of the hotel are good. But the experience is not good.
First, when I checked in, the front desk asked if I was an Accor member. I said I was a silver card member. The membership number was also written down, but no welcome drink coupon was provided. When I went downstairs, I asked if there was a drink coupon. After I reported the room number, I gave one, but there were only two people who checked in. I only gave one. I'm too lazy to be hypocritical. Forget it. Holiday Express will provide members with several drink coupons, not bad for those few dollars, but the experience is very bad.
Second, the location is a bit off. There is no place to buy bottles of water and drinks around, and there is no way to order takeaways. Can only go to the Chinese restaurant in the hotel to dine. In the afternoon, there was no water to drink before the restaurant opened. I spent 128 in the afternoon tea. Cakes and snacks were okay. The drinks were tea and drinks (apple juice, orange juice, etc.). I went to Yuehua Chinese Restaurant and ordered 4 dishes. By the end of the meal, the 4th dish was not served. Forget it, check out. I was told that the 4th dish was not ordered at the checkout, haha. The dishes are very average, I can barely make do with it, it is not like a dish made by a Northeast chef, and the 6 yuan a bowl of rice really makes me suspect that this is Northeast rice? It's more like rice in a university cafeteria, and I don't even bother to take photos of the food.
Third, there were only two bottles of ice and dew in the room. The other day I stayed at the Orange Hotel were Nongfu Springs. There were two bottles in the refrigerator, four bottles in total. There is no place to buy water around, so the waiter can only send two more bottles of water. There is no hand sanitizer in the room, only a small soap, and the toiletries are also very common. There are dead spots in room hygiene.
Fourth, I went to have breakfast in the morning and reported my room number, saying that breakfast was not included. I was stopped by the waiter. After talking to the front desk, I was told that I had to let in early, which affected the mood of the meal. The service details need to be further improved.

msg:The service is very backward. There is obviously a pick-up and drop-off service, but it has to be done a day in advance, even a few hours in advance. It is not like a hotel that costs 3,000 a night, but a bit like a small hotel service.

msg:Routine Hotel, if the nucleic acid expires, it says that you cannot leave the room. You are required to stay in the room after checking in. If you want to go out, you have to check out or continue your stay. Obviously, there are no nucleic acid restrictions in the scenic spot. That's it, but it can let us go out to do nucleic acid, it just doesn't let you go out to play, and wants you to stay in the hotel, forced to sleep in the hotel for two days, obviously can go out, say no, you are so afraid of nucleic acid It's overdue, why do you have to check in, it's ridiculous
