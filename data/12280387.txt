msg:IMPECCABLE SERVICE! And pleasant stay. I am a fan of AMARA GROUP. So, it was easy choice where to stay in SH. From check-in to check-out the Amara Signature SH Team were kind and polite. Theyve greeted me personally everytime they see me. Helped me with all my needs, from front office, concierge, health and fitness attendant and flo bar team. Everyone on top of their service! The hotel itself feels luxurious eventho the lobby just a tad smaller than expected. Room was clean, bright as requested but they do smells a lil bit old and tiresome. Outdoor swimming pool were nice for a dip too. Thank you, Amara. I would definitely comeback.  Thank you!

msg:Overall I had a pleasant experience at the Amara. The staff was nice and the front desk was friendly. However, I booked this hotel specifically to use the pool because I saw the lovely photos on trip, and planned to have a pool day swimming and reading. Unfortunately there is no seating available at the pool, they just provide a mat on the ground and it was too uncomfortable to be enjoyable.

One issue was that the AC in the room couldn‚Äôt be used, as there was central heating. The room was terribly hot. 
Other than that, I would stay again.

Location is very good, can access alot of food , shopping mall and coffee around the hotel.. starbucks and luckin coffee just besides the hotel.

Staff can communicate in english too
Thanks Henry ( receptionist at night ) for helping me buying something online for my kid during our stay.  I cant do online shopping without china‚Äôs numbers

Thanks Almira ( receptionist at day ) for recommending me some beef noodle ( chen xiang gui beef noodle is delicious ) around and guide me for local groceries market nearby the hotel

Improvement needed for someone that makeup the room, fail to change our bath towel and refill our amenities during our stay.. need to call them to do that again at night to redo what should they do.

Overall is great, got free upgraded to the high floor room and 1 night free mini bar..
Will recommend this hotel to my colleagues as well

This made the check-in process very easy, despite the late hour of our arrival. The purpose of my trip was for business, so movement from this hotel was good regarding taxi pick-up and drop off. Should I return to Shanghai for similar business, I would most certainly choose the Amara Signature.

The room was clean and very neat. The bathroom was spacious, which included a good size bath as well as a shower. Standard hotel toiletries were provided (toothbrush/toothpaste and soaps/shampoo and shower gel). 

Overall. This was a good stay

The location is good and the room was spacious but was a bit dusty and affected my sinus. Also, the carpet was not entirely smooth and flat so I kept tripping on that area when I walked about. I stayed almost 4 months ago and the service was better. There needs to be more consistency in giving good and friendly customer service, especially because the hotel price is not cheap.

The only hot food I get to eat was the made to order dumpling soup. Knowing it is winter, food should have been at least warm if is not hot. Other than the breakfast, overall was good.

The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, and the overall feel of the hotel is tranquil and private. The breakfast was vast and very fresh! Only suggestion is maybe keeping the pool open a little later. It closes at 6pm, but by 5:30 people are encouraged to get out. And considering the heat from the day, most people like to swim close to sunset.

2. called 0 to request something but when I spoke in English immediately put down the phone. redialed a few times they kept canceling my calls. I guess the person who was on duty didn't speak English and didn't want to attend the call. I understand the problem but I think basic training like "I am sorry sir I don't speak English someone who can will call you back"  would solve the problem.

Stay was good . room was clean . toilet is a bit small with a bathtub in the middle. bed was super comfy .

The room is very clean and tidy. Breakfast is mostly Chinese but tasty. I ate scramble with a bacon and coffee. 
We had a few questions during our stay, the front desk staff spoke English and were very helpful and hospitable. 
There is also a coffee machine and tea in the room. Shampoo, conditioner and body cream provided by the hotel are very good, do not dry the skin and hair. 
I am very satisfied with this hotel and will definitely return there. I have stayed in more expensive hotels in Shanghai, but this one is in no way inferior to them and is even cleaner and more beautiful than most five-star hotels. Planning to go back there in the summer as the outdoor pool will be open.

The rooms are very clean and the staff were all very helpful.  They helped unload our luggage from the car which was the first hotel that gave this service.  The cleaning lady on the 25th floor was outstanding.  She was always trying to make sure we had whatever we needed.

msg:The hotel has a great location and very friendly and helpful staff but the pool was closed the entire stay and several things broke in our room during our two-night stay there. I was alone with two kids there and it was quite frustrating to have to call them to come to fix things, although like I Said, the staff was friendly and they would come to fix it. One big complaint I have is that the room refrigerator is listed as their amenities but this is not a cold refrigerator!!!! It is merely to "keep things fresh" and can only maintain a very non-impressive temperature. In my opinion, this is ridiculous as I expected and needed cold storage. However, the staff was nice enough to let me store some things in their kitchen refrigerators.

He is humble and graceful. After that, I would like to praise the concierge Zero, who is very proactive in courier luggage. Help me, but I am very unhappy about several other things. First of all, no one responded to the voice message I left in the room. I wanted to pay more for a larger room. Secondly, the security guard was very unprofessional in handling the leftovers and informed me in a sarcastic tone. Finally, What I want to talk about is the most annoying person, the lobby manager, whose surname is Shen. I complained to him about security issues and did not respond to a single word. When I asked him to pick up my forgotten items, he was also very arrogant. I took a picture of his ID card and check-in order. , I was asked to write down each item, especially the specific amount. This is a relic left in my room. Didn't you pick it up for me in the lobby or elevator, okay? It‚Äôs too much. I‚Äôm sorry. I just hope that the hotel leadership will pay attention to these issues and make my stay here more pleasant in the future. Finally, I would like to thank Mr. Wei from Singapore for giving my son high-end chocolates when I had breakfast on my last dayüç´Thank you very muchüôè

The hotel lobby is small, with more than 10 free parking spaces on the ground. The underground garage belongs to the hotel owner's self-operated garage. Guests staying in the hotel are also charged 90 yuan/day for parking

Perhaps because of the hotel house shape, the room, especially the bathroom, is slightly different from the regular room. The hotel upgraded to the Supreme Deluxe King Bed üõèÔ∏è room for free. The mattress is very comfortable and especially helpful for sleep.

Because it is a Singapore üá∏üá¨ brand hotel, there are many Singaporean specialties for breakfast, and the variety of dishes is also rich.

At breakfast the next day, we met Chinese chef Master Cai who introduced us to the dishes. It was really fun to chat with Master Cai. It's very nice. Danny at the front desk gave us a late check-out when we checked out. Thank you very much. I really think this hotel is great. I will stay there again next time I come to Shanghai.

Go down and get it yourself in the middle of winter. What era is it? It's so backward. Others try their best to satisfy customers' convenience. This hotel embodies laziness to the extreme.

msg:Really average. Five-star hotels actually charge for parking. Parking at nearby express hotels is free. Charging my car is supposed to be free for one hour, but I am not exempted from it. Also, I almost lost my bag. The night I checked in, I ate out. I don‚Äôt know where I put the bag. Immediately call the hotel and ask them to help check if the bag is at the hotel. As a result, there was no response for a long time. I was urged twice later. I finally replied and said I didn‚Äôt see the black bag. I immediately became anxious and took a taxi back without even eating. Opening the room, I found the black bag right in front of me. You said just put it in an inconspicuous place. Put it in front of me and said no. I'm glad I came back, otherwise I wouldn't be able to tell if this bag was really gone. Also, the room was cramped and too small. The accommodation is average. I don‚Äôt recommend everyone to come. Either stay in a fast hotel, or add some more and stay in a better five-star hotel. I was very happy during the first two days of my trip to Shanghai, but my mood was ruined by your hotel on the last day.

msg:I stayed for one day on the first day of junior high school. Except for the floor, orientation, and size that I was not satisfied with, and the breakfast had some flaws, I was satisfied with everything else. Then we stayed for two more days. On the second day of junior high school, I continued to order Singaporean dishes and ordered bak kut tea for the second time. I was still very satisfied! The pork ribs become more fragrant the more you chew them. The newly tried Singapore Curry Chicken (not taken in the photo), although the taste is not as amazing as the Bak Kut Teh, there is a lot of chicken and the meat quality is very good. As for the curry, I felt full already, so I ate several more mouthfuls of rice for the curry. Although curry is spicy, drinking water will relieve the spiciness, and your mouth will not be dry after eating it. The nasi lemak on the third day of junior high school seemed to lack a few side dishes compared to the picture, but it had a rich taste. I tried it successfully! I also ordered a Thai mango rice, which tasted different from what I had before. I liked it very much! I found out that there is a Thai chef in Amana. But starting from the second grade of junior high school, some changes also occurred. For example, during the breakfast on the third grade of junior high school, there were too many guests at the same time, and the table was not cleared in time, and the dishes were not replenished in time, so the meal was rushed. In the next two days, some of the breakfast dishes were not fresh, some were not replenished, and some were confused by changing the positions of the dishes. But also after the suggestion, the varieties were added. On the other hand, there was also a service omission in the guest room, but it was made up after being reminded. What I never expected was that on the last night, I encountered a serious problem of no hot water twice. After the first time was solved, the second time came again. In the middle of the night, the management came to check on the situation. I didn‚Äôt take a shower or get a good rest. . As for the cause of the problem, the engineering staff had different opinions. The engineer who came to repair the first time told frankly that it was probably an internal staff who accidentally touched the external valve, and we didn't want to complain; The next time I came to the door, the front desk said that no one was there and was on their way...) He said that there was a switch in the bathroom, which meant that the guest had turned the switch, but suggested that we change rooms in the middle of the night. . This was our first time staying at Amara. When we checked in, no one told us what the adjus**ent switch was, let alone how to adjust it. Later, the hotel management ruled out the possibility of guest operation because three adjacent rooms had no hot water at the same time. The same problem occurs twice, and the engineering staff shirks responsibility, which is infuriating and chilling! How can people continue to live with peace of mind! A five-star hotel even had problems with its basic hot water supply. During the Chinese New Year, there was no hot water for showering twice a night in three guest rooms in winter! Later, the hotel manager Fan apologized sincerely and said that the engineering director rushed back from other places overnight to find out the reason. If it is a problem with the equipment itself, and there is a reasonable explanation, and there is no second problem, we will not particularly mind, but according to what the first honest and reliable engineer Fu said, we think it is man-made, and the engineering staff shirks responsibility later. This behavior makes us lose trust. Even if we were asked to check out late, we would not dare to take a shower again. It's a pity that this is the only Singaporean five-star hotel in Shanghai, and it's a pity that a Singaporean chef and a Thai chef are here. Before leaving, the receptionist helped to carry the luggage. The person at the front desk named Chen? The boys actively helped find the leftover items, and the hotel manager Fan also took a video for us in the process. The three receptionists at the western restaurant on the second floor listened to opinions and responded promptly. I had a great time communicating with Chef Jiang from Singapore and asked him about cooking tips. Thank you to everyone who sincerely provides services to us.

The other person said what do you want, I was really convinced, and then I contacted the front desk to change the room next door, saying it was also a double room, but it turned out that it was put together like this, with a crack in the middle. There was indeed no smell in this room, but the window leaked and could not be closed tightly. In short, the experience is poor and there is no service. I will not choose it again. Friends who have requirements for service and facilities should choose carefully.

Stayed for 4 nights. On the first night, I encountered a problem with the drain pipe in the shower room being clogged, and water was flowing back into the entire bathroom! When I reported it to John, the clerk on duty, during the next day, he said coldly that he understood. When I returned to the room in the evening, I found that it was still blocked. So he just knows, whether he will deal with it is another matter?

When we took a short break and went out for dinner, we reported to the front desk that there were too many guests, so we planned to find the staff after we came back from dinner. As a result, we encountered another problem...the door sensor was out of power. At this time, we met Mr. Johnnyü•∫. He immediately helped us by calling the guy from the engineering depar**ent and went to the room with us to check and replace the battery. and blockage problems. I am also very grateful to the guy from the engineering depar**ent, who is super enthusiasticüëç and the aunt who cleans the room and clothes is also very considerate and enthusiasticüíï

The location of the hotel is also ideal. There is Changshou Station nearby, and it is very convenient to transfer lines. Across a big road, there are many good restaurants. Ôøº

However, the air conditioner is convenient because of the central control problem and it is relatively hot.
If you like it cold, you have to refer to it.

It must not be disinfectant. 2: Facility maintenance. If the elevator is not open on a certain floor, it is recommended not to use black stickers. It is very abrupt and easy to get old. Half of them stick and half of them fail to stick. 3: There are only two wooden rest chairs in the lobby rest area. Is the caf√© rest area next to it outsourced?

Although the hotel is not a new hotel that has just opened in the past two years, I have to say that star hotels are indeed different. They are well maintained and the sanitary conditions are also very good. The facilities are complete, and the front desk upgraded the room type for us.
The hotel has convenient transportation, just next to the Changshou Road subway station. There are some shopping malls downstairs and a lot of food.
This time we came to Shanghai by car. There is a free parking space at the entrance, and there is also a paid underground parking lot downstairs. The security at the gate is serious and responsible, very enthusiastic, and took the initiative to reserve a place for us.
Since I arrived early on the day of check-in, I waited for a while in the lobby for cleaning. The lobby bar is very quiet and suitable for a few friends to sit and chat. Molly's service is considerate, and the coffee tastes good!
A very good experience. Compared with hotels of the same level, the price/performance ratio is very high!

Although this hotel does not have the visual sense of Huangpu River View and modern city, it can restore Shanghai very well. The essence of city life, there are flocks of birds flying between old buildings and commercial buildings in the morning, and the sycamore trees on the street are already tall, which is very suitable for enjoying life quietly by yourself or with your significant other.

The service is worthy of praise, because I called the hotel in advance when I arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night, and the hotel would remember the name and reserve the room in advance, and there was a waiter at the door to help with the luggage.

The surrounding traffic is very convenient. There is the famous Jade Buddha Temple nearby. You can go to Nanjing West Road and Huaihai Road in a few stops on Line 13. It‚Äôs not too far from Hongqiao (about half an hour by taxi). There are also restaurants on Changshou Road. There are many, and there is an internet celebrity Ye Baozi opposite the hotel, hahahaüòÜ

I went late, when I checked in, the executive lounge was over, but it took me around.

As a result, at 18:52, I called and told me that there was a room, dare you believe it. On holidays, people can check in until 7 o'clock, not to mention that the day before was not a holiday, so can it be so slow to clean up the room? To put it bluntly, there is still no trouble, and I will be dragged when I go out to play, proper and arrogant service.

To receive Chinese people, with a serious work style, and to speak English. In Shanghai, the Chinese face must be Chinese. What does it mean to speak English? After checking into the hotel, the double bed has only one chair to sit on. Because I pressed "Do Not Disturb" at night, and because the word "Do Not Disturb" did not disappear the next day after taking out the power card, I went back around 9:00 p.m. and found that the cleaning was not done. The shopping bags with clothes were thrown away as garbage. We stayed for three days and there was no shower cap for two days. It was said that it was for environmental protection, and we had to ask for what we needed. It was a very disappointing experience.

msg:I have witnessed this hotel from its brilliant opening to its current mediocrity. This is my last stay and I will not recommend it to colleagues or friends in the future.
Let‚Äôs talk about the facilities first: As a hotel that has been in business for less than five years, the bathroom facilities have been aging in a large area, which means that there is no daily maintenance at all, and the water floods Jinshan after taking a bath. The sound insulation of the hotel is also very poor. It seems that I was given a Unicom room. Starting at 1:30 in the morning, the residents next door started chatting and giggling. They were so noisy that they had no choice but to call the front desk at 2:00, and heard the staff come to deal with it at 2:30.
Let's talk about the staff: there is no greeting at all when entering the door, and there is no concierge to open the door. It is hard to imagine what kind of service this is. Check-in is also very rigid, and I don't feel the standard of a star hotel. I didn't ask about the experience of checking in when I checked out. It was really bad and there was no service.

Facilities: I booked a parent-child room, with children stepping on footstools, toilet seats, toiletries, bathrobes, cups, etc. It is very practical to bring a baby. The other hotel facilities are a little bit old and generally not too old. I gave my baby a bath at night.
Hygiene: After reading the comments, many people said that it was not clean and hesitated. It is true that the details are a little bit lacking in hygiene, such as some corners and the toothbrush box, but overall it is still ok.
Environment: It is only a few minutes away from the Changshou Road subway exit, three stops to the Natural History Museum, and it is okay to transfer to the subway to go to the Bund, Oriental Pearl Tower, etc. The shopping mall downstairs of the hotel is closed, but there are quite a lot of food nearby.
Service: Everything is not bad. The waiter in the breakfast room took the initiative to bring baby tableware for the child. The breakfast category is still inferior to that of the five-star hotel, but it is not bad. The beverages in the small refrigerator can be drunk without charge, and the capsule coffee machine is also good.
There are a lot of people visiting Shanghai recently, and the hotels near the Bund are also really expensive and old. Choosing this hotel is also a pleasant journey.

Changshou Road can't be considered a very good location. I didn't expect the business of this hotel to be quite good. I came to check in after two o'clock, but the rooms were not good. Fortunately, the front desk was directly upgraded to the executive floor, because the reservation was made through Ctrip, and a late check-out was also handled, which is more considerate.

The room gives people a business-like feel, stable and low-key, and there is a big bathtub, but unfortunately, the layout is a bit compact, and the shower room also seems to be small. The bed was huge and the pillows were very comfortable. When I was leaving, I happened to meet the room attendant, who was very polite and told me not to forget the power cord of the mobile phone.

The buffet breakfast is in the restaurant on the second floor. The poached eggs are fried very well, not greasy at all, very suitable for drizzled with soy sauce.

Overall, the price is high.

The hotel has convenient transportation, convenient parking, and comfortable rooms. The small details of room service make people feel very considerate. According to the usage habits of the previous day, they can reserve some more mineral water and toiletries. The hotel restaurant has rich food, and all kinds of services in the restaurant are warm and comfortable.

Taking advantage of the hotel's activities, I booked a day, the room type was upgraded, and there was an executive lounge. Arranged to the highest floor, the view is very good. The whole room is clean and has no peculiar smell, and the bathroom equipment Metis is OK. The TOTO toilet is the same as the one used at home, which is very considerate and in place. The bedding is not bad, the sense of collapse is moderate, and the air conditioner is sufficient. The only regret is that the sound is slightly loud. The executive lounge is exclusive, the drinks are okay, the coffee is average, and the soda water is full. The breakfast is okay, basically everything you should have, but there are a little more people. The schedule is too tight, and I will stay again next time.

The only drawback is that I do not book 2 rooms on the same floor. The elevator has access control, so it is a bit troublesome, but overall I am very satisfied. If it is still there If there is a chance to go to the place I want to go to in Shanghai and it is nearby, I will definitely choose this hotel

There is a bathtub and a smart toilet, but this toilet seems to be faulty, and it keeps spraying water for self-disinfection, so it keeps making noises in the middle of the night, which affects sleep. On the first night, I had no choice but to unplug the socket and cut off the power. On the second night, I responded to the front desk, but it was still not fixed, so I continued to turn off the socket at night. Although the impact is not large, it is still a minus item. In addition, the sound of the air conditioner was also very loud on the first night, and the sound of the minimum wind was also very loud, so we had to turn it off in the end. But after reporting to the front desk, it was fixed the next night. It worked out fine.

I also shot the night scene (although a lot of work was done in the later stage). Oh, one small problem is that the sound of the faucet switch in the next room can be heard. But it's not a big problem. Overall satisfied.

msg:There is no five-star hotel service at all, and the front desk personnel of the hotel do not have the service ability, professional quality and processing ability of a five-star hotel. A total of two room types were booked for three days. When I checked in on the night of 4.13, it was a very thin guy wearing glasses at the front desk. When he only found out that I had an order for two days, I told him that I would stay for a total of three days. , but there are two orders, is it possible to combine the orders, because I don't want to change the room. At that time, he said that there was no problem and he could handle it for me. After I finished the process, I checked again whether it was all done in three days, and he gave me a positive reply. After returning to the hotel around 11:50 p.m. on 4.15, I found that the room card could not be swiped in the elevator. I went to the front desk to renew the room card, and a girl at the front desk told me that the room from 4.15 to 4.16 needs to be re-applied. I told you right away that the room type on 4.15 is the supreme deluxe, and I live in the ordinary deluxe now. The girl's first reaction was to ask me to change rooms in the early hours of the night on 4.15. I refused and asked questions. First, I had informed and confirmed with the front desk staff that it was three days when I checked in on 4.13. Why did the current situation happen? Second, I went out from noon to night. If the system shows that I should leave the hotel today but have not checked out and continued my stay, why hasn‚Äôt any hotel staff contacted me in the past 12 hours? This is entirely the fault of the hotel. I asked not to change the room, but to refund the difference. After the girl at the front desk heard it, she first said that she could not refund the price difference. Can I have a breakfast. My price difference is enough to buy a hotel breakfast, do I still need you to deliver it? I said at the time that I didn't need breakfast because I couldn't get up in the morning. She even told me that she could help me delay until two o'clock to check out. I said no need, because my high-speed train left Shanghai at two o'clock. After listening to it, she said that there was no way to refund the price difference. No other solution was given. I asked the manager on duty that night to come forward to solve the problem. He was a fat boy wearing glasses. In the process of solving the problem, he also asked me to change the room in the wee hours of the morning. After I refused, I actually wanted to continue living in my friend's ordinary double room, upgrade my friend to the supreme deluxe room for free, and ask my friend to refund the difference to me.
From the ability of these three front desk personnel to handle affairs and the thinking of dealing with problems, it can be seen that this hotel does not have the service of a five-star hotel at all. I only saw insincerity, perfunctory, evasion, and even cheating.

msg:The location is quiet, the price is high, the room size is moderate, the floor height is good, the administrative decoration, the door reception is thoughtful. During my stay, I ordered an additional cake from the hotel, which is worthy of praise. It is made of fresh cream and can be eaten fresh in one bite. It is very cost-effective and delicious. These are the advantages of the hotel.

Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages of staying at the hotel:
1. The floor cleaning service is too poor. When my aunt was working all the time, I just wanted to put the garbage at the door for my aunt to collect it, but when I came back at night, no one collected the garbage for more than 6 hours. Can't my aunt be seen next to me, and the floor camera can't see it?

2. During the few days of staying in the hotel, there have been people who took IELTS in and out constantly, which is not very friendly to the people who live in the hotel.

3. Takeaways cannot be delivered upstairs. How to say it is a matter of opinion. In addition to hardware, five-star hotels also want software experience. Hanting has robots to deliver takeaways.

msg:I have never found this hotel not far from my home before. I was attracted by the outdoor swimming pool recommended by the public, and I returned with satisfaction.
A niche brand hotel, close to Changshou Road subway station, exit from Exit 1, go straight and look up to see the logo on the roof of the building. Parking is on the ground or in the underground parking garage of the shopping mall. The owner is a Singaporean. There are only four hotels in the world. The service is very good. The IELTS point has received medical teams from many provinces and cities during the epidemic.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Swimming pool. The outdoor swimming pool is very good, blue sky, blue swimming pool, hot weather and I have fun in the water, the children pat the water, swim, laugh together, close your eyes, the holiday wind is blowing here ~ can't leave Shanghai ? Whether it is in Shanghai or not, I have the final say, haha
The swimming pool is divided into two areas, a normal swimming pool and a paddling pool, which are very suitable for playing in the water or sunbathing. There are quite a few foreigners, and there are few outdoor swimming pools in the urban area. The water quality of the swimming pool is clean and the current limit is 35 people, which is very good; the tall buildings on the left and right sides just block part of the swimming pool, the sun does not shine directly, and it will not be very hot. The paddling pool is relatively shallow and suitable for small children. You can bring some water props by yourself. , After playing all morning, the children are very happy.
2Ô∏è‚É£ room. The room is more business-like, with a large and deep egg-shaped bathtub, where babies under the age of two can start playing in the water.
The little yellow duck-themed room has a childlike decoration. When we entered the door, Aunt Ada and Aunt Sun were helping us with the decoration. They were very polite. Floor mats, slides, swings, small tents, schoolbags, paper cups, toiletries, etc. Adults don't feel anything, children are excited, I am blowing the air conditioner and brushing my phone, watching them laugh on their own, fragrant!
3Ô∏è‚É£ Meals. I feel that the hotel catering is relatively conventional, Yingtai Southeast Asian dishes, in the connected shopping malls, the taste is heavier, and the more authentic Southeast Asian feeling, the hot and sour taste in summer is still more appetizing, and you should choose carefully if you can't eat spicy food. The all-day restaurant is not big, and the breakfast items are relatively simple. There are many delicious food near the hotel. You can also elm yourself without breakfast, which is convenient and affordable.
Satisfied with this trip, there is no fatigue of boats and cars, no large bags or small bags, I found the feeling of vacation at the door of my house, I checked out and went home to do my homework without delay [Âë≤È£ü]

During this trip, I settled in three similar five-star hotels, and the feeling is completely different. Amara Signature Shanghai is definitely too bad.

There is a guy at the door of the hotel who helps you unpack your suitcase, and the attitude is very kind. The attitude of the receptionist at the front desk is also very good. I said there should be a window, yes. He also helped us arrange for a higher level. Later, because of the need for late check-out, the front desk happily agreed. I think breakfast is OK, because there are not too high requirements for breakfast, Chinese food, bread, and fruit are available. I drank white porridge and it was very fresh. The wait time for afternoon tea in the package is a bit long, about 45 minutes. Maybe we went too late and said we had to do it again, but the price/performance ratio is still very high. The overall environment can not be compared with five stars, but overall I can accept it. I don't think there is anything to be dissatisfied with. The only thing that might need improvement is that I like to sleep on low pillows.

I didn't understand that I had to wait so long after checking in at two o'clock. 2. The room arrangement also has no windows, which is very boring (this is the first time I live with windows, and the price of the same room type is the same. It is different from the last arrangement. It is said that it will cost more to change to the last one. I don‚Äôt mind I understand. This time the price may have increased due to the outbreak. It was more expensive than my first stay, but the service has not kept up.) 3. What annoyed me the most was that I went to the front desk to inform the room that it needs to be cleaned before going out the next day . After ten o'clock in the evening, I went back untouched. After reporting to the front desk, I just told me to clean it now... I was tired enough for one day, but I still have to wait for cleaning, very speechless. Temporary cleaning is also very inadequate. All in all very dissatisfied. The way and method of dealing with the problem is not good enough. Not to mention that you can forget everything you tell the front desk.

The service staff in the lobby seem to be awake and have no service at all. It would be good to handle it for you. The security guards can't be impatient when they ask something. The funniest thing is that when we were waiting for the elevator, we had to go in when the elevator came. A service staff blocked and said that the elevator was only for foreign guests. When foreigners sit, the Chinese can only wait. Where does the reason come from? This hotel will probably always be on my blacklist, even though I know that your hotel will not miss me a guest!

msg:It was a great experience. The city center is very cost-effective. I just wanted to find a swimming place for my children to play near home. After swimming for one night, it would be easier to change and wash. I didn't expect the facilities and services to be good. I will recommend this hotel to friends who come to visit in the future.
1. I booked a room with a big bed. The bed is an extra-large bed of 2 meters. It can sleep up to three people. The mattress is moderately soft and hard, and the waist is not slumped. Go down and turn it twice and you will find a deep pit, and stick your head directly to the mattress, and the support is not bad. Sleep quality is guaranteed. Toiletries, toothbrushes and combs are available from room service if needed, and the body wash and shampoo smell a bit like lemongrass in Thai hotels.
2. The swimming pool is a small pool + paddling pool. The water depth is about 1.2 meters, which is not deep. It is very suitable for children to play and is very safe. It is very lively here these days. Most people from Chinese and foreign families are sunbathing here. They can bring some floating toys. The cocktail bar next to them provides meals and juice drinks. I see foreigners bring their own wine and glasses. The instant sense of party.
3. There is a large lawn next to the swimming pool, which is a good place for sunbathing and yoga. Many people come to the swimming pool, spread a towel on the lawn and lie down in the sun to read a book. The floor is too hot, and the lawn feels better.
4. The breakfast is ok, there are not many kinds, but the breakfast included in the room is not too demanding. The freshly cooked noodles and small wontons are delicious
5. Around, travel is very convenient, whether it is a taxi or a subway, it is convenient. Line 13 and Line 7 are direct, bus 36. Opposite the road is Xuhui Plaza, and there are many places to eat. In fact, there is a movie theater in the hotel building, but the epidemic is not open now. There are Starbucks, dessert shop, and tea room downstairs. Going out from the side door of the hotel and walking back, you can run on the Suzhou River Trail, and the environment is also good.
6. I gave a spa voucher of 80 yuan. The VEDA spa is on the second floor of the hotel group building. I didn't have time to experience it. According to the reviews, it should be a Thai massage.

The worst thing is that a stranger knocked on the door after drinking too much alcohol at 2 o'clock in the morning. The front desk reported that this is normal, because there are nightclub guests nearby who drink too much and often knock on the door randomly. In the middle of the night, they are too scared to sleep. The hotel has nothing to say or do.

Advantages: The two ladies at the front desk solved the hotel handling problem for me and changed to a larger room because we needed to take online classes. The service attitude was good.
Disadvantages: countless
1. Hygiene problems, there are visible ash on the table top of the room, obvious stains on the pillows, and even food residues left by previous guests at the bottom of the bed.
2. The service problem is very serious. On the first day, I went out at 10 in the morning, and I went back to the hotel room at 3 in the afternoon and did not clean up; the phone asked to send a pack of tissues to the room. but the housekeeping depar**ent was not clearly marked on the phone, so I redialed and told me to call the housekeeping depar**ent in an impatient tone, and when the hotel was not too busy, the package of tissues was delivered for dozens of minutes; the most outrageous It was the next day that breakfast was not delivered and I booked a room with breakfast. I called and said it had been delivered, but it was not delivered when I checked out and there was no follow-up explanation.

msg:I read the reviews before I ordered, and most of the bad reviews are about the same. They are that the room service is very poor, there is no cleaning, no one will ever answer the phone, or the room equipment is too few, called customer service song, but No one will ever send it. I hesitated. After all, I have stepped on thunders when I booked a room on Ctrip recently, and the thunders I stepped on are exactly the same as the predecessors. But I am not reconciled. Is such a five-star hotel really so poorly managed? I do not believe. Then I also looked at the parent-child suites of other hotels, it seems that this one has a slide, so I took the risk to book a little yellow duck parent-child suite. Then, after check-in, the sanitation and facilities of the room are definitely very good. After checking in and entering the room, the little yellow duck theme has not been decorated yet, so I took the kids downstairs to eat something. Later, when I went upstairs, the room changed a lot. The child liked it very much. However, the thunder that the predecessors stepped on is really not nonsense. I stepped on the same thunder, exactly the same. First, let me talk about the air-conditioning system of this hotel. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in this room. In this winter, the room is not hot enough. I wear short-sleeved shorts in the room and I still keep sweating. Because there are no windows to open, the only air conditioner is our life-saving straw, which is of no use at all. At night, a family of three wore short-sleeved shorts without a quilt, so they just slept for one night. The second is the terrible room service, which can be said to be completely absent. At night, when I was about to brush my teeth, I found that there was no disposable toothbrush in my toiletries, so I called the guest room center and asked them to send it. However, I waited for an hour and no one came. No one answered after I called. Reluctantly, my husband can only go downstairs to buy toothbrushes for his family, which makes us feel as though we are going to live in a youth hostel. We only realized the next day that the room service of this hotel seemed to be outsourced~~~~ After the cleaning once a day was over, there was no room service anymore.
        The buffet breakfast is quite satisfactory, with a complete range of Chinese and Western styles, hot and cold, all available, but each variety is relatively small, and it feels like a four-star hotel standard. But it's really enough, not much for breakfast.

Service attitude: When checking in, the front desk chatted with the previous guest for about 10 minutes (3 guests lined up at the back). The toothbrush I wanted, the razor was handed over, and I didn‚Äôt have a word of sorry.
When leaving the store, because Ctrip provides free check-out until 2 o'clock, there is no alarm. The front desk of the hotel called at 10 o'clock in the morning and emphasized that at 2 o'clock, we must get out, or 400 yuan will be deducted.
Parking at your own expense, 80 per day.

Hygiene: Not much to say, as shown in the picture. I have stayed in many Shanghai hotels of the same price, and this one has the worst sanitation.

Summary: You think you have chosen the king of cost-effectiveness, haha, think too much üòÑ

When processing it, there were no free upgrades as others said in the comments...but it didn't matter, mainly because the attitude of the staff was very uncomfortable. The room facilities are still the same, not too new, but the overall hygiene is good. The point to complain is that the switch of the room light is too complicated... and I didn't give an extra power card when I checked in. I had to press the switch again every time I went out and came back. The view outside the window is great. In general, nothing has been done, and overall it is okay.

There are only two front desks, so check-in is particularly slow. In addition, if you encounter a customer who wants to issue a ticket, you should at least "penalty station for 10 minutes"
I gave two cards and I couldn't get one card. It was normal. There was no phone on the hotel floor. If you want to do it again, you have to go downstairs... I met the cleaning lady and refused to open the door for you. If you can't open the door of the guest room casually, then I said you don't worry, you can help me take out my mobile phone. I'll go downstairs and apply for a card at the head office. That's not OK. Then I have a question... If I go out and tell the front desk of the hotel what I need to add, is it a clean aunt that can't go in?
The bathroom is not very small, but why is it necessary to add a bathtub? ? ? Is this really reasonable? The smart toilet cannot be opened when the lid is opened... but it is closed very positively, and it falls down heavily! Just a few minutes after staying in, "pong" was scared to death. There is no Bluetooth speaker in the room...
It‚Äôs boring... The air-conditioning mode is fixed and cannot be selected.

The front desk phone is not available all the year round, and the day before check-out was not cleaned due to lack of staff. But the cleaning was very serious before.
The corners of the sheets are damaged, which I personally think should not be.
The advantage is that it is close to the subway, although the surrounding area is relatively old, but it is also convenient. The soundproofing of the room is relatively good, except for the sound of closing the door, the voice cannot be heard.
Overall the price is reasonable and no surprises. Will not choose next time.

I was tired after an overnight stay and agreed. After going up, there was dust on the table at the end of the room, and the electric toilet was broken like a decoration, I put up with it. On the third day of my stay, I planned to renew the room due to work, but found that the room number could not be reached at the front desk. I ran downstairs to renew the room and responded to the front desk. The front desk said "oh" back to me. Fortunately, the service attitude of the cleaning staff in the hotel is still very good, much better than the front desk. On the day I checked out, the hotel had to give me change due to the cash I paid for the deposit. Then the front desk told me that she was going to change the cash, and then explained the matter of changing the cash to the concierge depar**ent, and explained it to a foreigner in the concierge depar**ent. I waited a while and the concierge didn't get any change. The front desk found another short-haired front desk, said to open the vault to get change, and then asked me to wait. I just want to ask, does a hotel not provide some change, and it takes so long to refund the deposit? I really couldn't wait, I had to catch the train, and the Didi I called had already arrived, so I told the short-haired receptionist that I couldn't wait. She had no choice but to send it back to me via WeChat. I didn't hear an apology for the whole thing, and this short-haired front desk is obviously a level higher than the ordinary front desk and may be a supervisor. The whole thing seemed like I did something wrong, especially the short-haired receptionist with a stinky face, which made me feel very annoyed.

Hotel parking spaces are less on a first-come, first-served basis, and the little brothers in the security depar**ent are also active. Looking forward to the next stay!

msg:First of all, I feel that the two stars serve a lot,
The room is simple built-in, except for the bed, it is comfortable to sleep, but the sound insulation effect is average, and there is no bath salt prepared in the bathtub, the hygiene is good, and it is very clean. I will not complain about the lights. Anyway, I sleep with my eyes closed.
The location is average, let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs close to the city center, but it‚Äôs not as good as the Gujing Holiday next door. I usually live there. Every time I pass by outside Amman, I feel that it‚Äôs okay. Poor, the front desk is like looking at people with nostrils upside down. If you talk too much, you feel angry.
It was this quick check-in that I had to laugh to death. The first time I came across a hotel room which was furnished like an express hotel, do I need to charge a check-in deposit? And I said that I saw no deposit when booking Ctrip. They said, Ctrip is Ctrip. It is a Ctrip activity and has nothing to do with our hotel? ? ?
I really don‚Äôt want to spoil my good mood for my birthday. Because my mobile phone is not wired, there is neither the front desk nor the guest room, so I need to borrow a power bank by myself.
Let‚Äôs talk about morning check-out. During this peak check-out period, there is only one staff member at the front desk, and customers are required to wait there because there is still a deposit, so don‚Äôt talk about quick check-out. Fortunately, the invoices are witty the day before Let them print it out, otherwise more time will be wasted.
Just say that this price does not know where the match is? If possible, I would choose a better hotel for the same price. Do not consider the second time

msg:At first I felt that there were a lot of bad reviews in this house. After reading the bad reviews, I found that many people were hypocritical, and the authenticity was questionable. Maybe I'm lucky. When we arrived at the hotel, there was free open-air parking, smooth parking, and very quick check-in, and there were two meetings in the hotel that day, and people came and went bustling. The guest room is not as exaggerated as one review said. Auntie needs bottled water to increase quickly. There is only one chair in the room, which is a defect. It is convenient to travel and the subway station is very close. It only takes ten minutes to ride to Jing'an Temple by bike, and foreigners are basking in the sun in the paddling pool on the seventh floor, as if they are in Europe. The breakfast variety is complete, and the lunch business set meal and the set meal at Taiying Restaurant are also very good.

The aunt who cleans the room is also very good. The cleaning is very clean. Thanks to Sabrina Geng. When I checked in, because I gave a room at the end of the corridor, I wanted to change it to the next building. After learning about the situation, Sabrina Geng did a room upgrade for the double room because there was no room available, so I changed the room type for us. Generally speaking, we moved in. Very good experience, will choose to stay next time

When I went out for dinner at noon, I met Aunt Sun cleaning the guest room on the 26th floor and asked about the cleaning requirements very carefully. When I came back, I found that my cosmetics were all clean and tidy. Very good experience, very cost-effective.

msg:DissatisfiedÔºûsatisfied

1. We booked an ordinary double bed at the price of 800 yuan per day with double breakfast. When we arrived at the scene, we found that the people living on the swimming pool floor were very complicated. Many tattooed guys and girls in glamorous clothes made the room smelly.

2. I took a look at Ctrip and found that the price is almost a deluxe room, so I went downstairs and asked for an upgrade. I can accept an additional fee, which is about 60 per night. The attitude of the front desk was very indifferent, and finally gave us a free upgrade. The condition was to write her name in the comments and recommend her, starting with F in English, and repeating it three times in a row. As if we got some charity.

3. The structure of the room is very unsuitable for business. The toilet is not separated separately. As long as one person is in the bathroom, the other can't do anything.

4. I was bitten on a leg. I don't know if it is a flea or a mosquito. Both people were bitten like this.

Satisfied place:
A lot of food nearby, good traffic
The cleaning lady is very enthusiastic and has a good attitude

msg:Transportation: Go straight from Exit 1 of Metro No. 7/13. If you park, you will park for free at the hotel entrance, but there are fewer parking spaces, a dozen or so. The underground parking garage is 10 yuan an hour, and the ceiling is 80 yuan a day. My Jiabao High School Entrance Examination is at the Tongji Second Affiliated Middle School, so I booked a three-night stay. It's super close, it's there in 2-3 minutes. Generally, which school for the history examination will be that school in the future, so the parents of the second grade should pay attention to it. If you need it in the future, you can book it in advance. I booked a twin room for three nights and upgraded my check-in to the 28th floor. There are 30 floors in total, and the 30th floor is the executive lounge. On the first day of check-in, ask the front desk to get toiletries, and the next few days will be the room cleaning. Later, I heard Aunt Ding said that this floor is only my twin room type [cover face], and the other rooms are suites. Aunt Ding is very diligent and serious. The bathroom is quite large, the smart toilet is very good, with self-cleaning function, and self-cleaning as soon as someone approaches [breaking tears to laugh]. The panoramic floor-to-ceiling glass windows are invincible at night, very beautiful! Or automatic curtains, in the morning, click on the head of the bed to see the location and get up invincible and comfortable. The beds are high and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is on the 2nd floor. There are not many types of meals, but you can eat enough. It is not worthwhile to add breakfast alone for 168 people. After all, there is a 39 yuan buffet for Pizza Hut not far away, and you can also order takeaway (pick up below) and lunch There is a business lunch set on the 2nd floor, which can be eaten in the restaurant or delivered to the room. It is cost-effective and delicious. I especially recommend the braised pork rice and beef noodles. Had the hotel's Southeast Asian set meal for dinner, not good. You can go to eat nearby, all restaurants, if you are free, you can line up to eat Jianghu cuisine, crayfish and other long-queuing shops, the nearby Hong Kong style is also good. The hotel gym is on the 7th floor, and the facilities are quite complete. There is an outdoor swimming pool with a water depth of 1.2M. Yes, the depth is only 1.2M. It‚Äôs so hot in the sun, [covering face][covering face][covering face], ending at 6pm. Bring your own swimsuit, swimming cap, and swimming goggles. The hotel is more expensive. The overall stay is comfortable and I like it very much!

msg:I have never had such a bad impression of a hotel. The last time I opened a room to the room of a young couple who had already stayed in, I heard the sound outside, and the hotel staff still said that no one inside gave me the room card. Try again, ran up and down three times, and finally I confirmed that there was someone inside and asked the waiter to come up and check, only to say that I had opened the wrong room, and upgraded me to replace the room type. I didn't have to worry about rushing out at the time. Don‚Äôt say nothing. I also recorded and filmed the video outside the room. I had a certificate. To protect the privacy of the young couple in the room, I would not let it out. If you are a guest, if you don‚Äôt lock the door, if someone else opens the door and comes in, you do. What do you think? This time I went to Shanghai and booked it again. When I left, I didn't find the clothes in the closet because of my problem, but after checking out for five hours, the hotel cleaning did not find it? When I got home and opened the box, I found out that after making seven or eight calls, I couldn‚Äôt make any calls. Finally, I asked Ctrip customer service to handle it. I contacted and mailed it back. My clothes were hung in the closet without any wrinkles. The clothes I mailed back are good or bad. Fold the clothes into a shape, right? Tucked in a bag and mailed it out. It‚Äôs really amazing. Normal people can‚Äôt pack a piece of luggage and clothes overseas and it won‚Äôt be crumpled like this. I really can't bear it this time, so I must really evaluate it

msg:Reviews after check-in are as follows:
1. From the time I got off the bus to the time I got my luggage, the staff at the door never said hello, helped me pick up my luggage, etc. Is the staff at the door a decoration? Or are you willing to hire meaningless people because your hotel has more money?
2. When I entered the lobby to check in, the staff looked indifferently and didn't even say hello. Their faces were expressionless and their attitude was cold.
3. Long hair can be seen everywhere in the room and the lighting setting panel is somewhat unreasonable.
4. From the time I checked in to the time I checked out, this hotel was absolutely horrifying. Not a single greeting, not a single smile, and not a single caring person was given.
5. The hotel parking space costs NT$94/day, which is extremely bad. It is the only hotel I have stayed in in the world that requires you to pay for the car.
Summarize:
I have been to Shanghai several times and basically all the hotel staff have the same attitude. These attitudes are only for Chinese people. They are so enthusiastic about foreigners that they are so enthusiastic that they lick their ankles. I despise Shanghai people for their admiration for foreigners. Remember, your ancestors of the older generations are all Those who have been invaded by foreigners, especially the Japanese economic zone, should be better educated. I hope Shanghainese can take this as a warning. You are only the second and first in China. No matter how high the GDP of Beijing is, it will always serve Beijing. ** Get rid of you in Beijing. become the capital. This comment is not anonymous. Real-name comment. Thank you.

msg:It was a very happy stay, which made our trip to Shanghai even better. I booked a high floor in advance. The view is very wide, and the Thai food is delicious. The lady in the restaurant even specially prepared grape juice for the children. The breakfast the next day was also very rich , there are Chinese and Western food, choose independently, very happy, looking forward to the next experience

msg:Grunds√§tzlich alles in Ordnung. 
Leider wurde bei uns auf dem Gang t√§glich heftig geraucht, was nat√ºrlich in die Zimmer zog. Hier (in einem Nichtraucherhotel)  h√§tten wir uns bei einem Medlung ans Management einen besseren konsequenteren Umgang gew√ºnscht. Und da geht es nicht um Bestrafung des Rauchers, sondern eine gute L√∂sung f√ºr uns. 
Erstaunlich aber, dass es Menschen gibt, die in einem Nichtraucherhotel im Zimmer rauchen, nicht die paar Schritte raus gehen k√∂nnen‚Ä¶.
