msg:Don’t rely on WiFi in the hotel, it’s just not working at all.
The air conditioning is not cooling enough, it’s central and not controlled.
Otherwise, the food is ok, the room is clean. Staff is nice and trying to help. 
Reception personnel knows English, which is rare for China.

msg:The hotel environment is very good! This hotel has a relatively high rating on Ctrip. After comparing it with other hotels, this hotel did not increase its price during the May Day holiday. When I checked in, I thought I had made the right choice! The environment is really good. Jean at the front desk arranged two adjacent rooms on the 7th floor, with lake views. After arriving at the room, I checked it out and found that it was cleaned very carefully. The equipment is quite complete. The view outside the window makes me feel very good! It is worth staying.

msg:The hotel room is clean and convenient for travel. The 2.7-meter bed in the family room is really great, suitable for families with children. There is Xingyue Plaza nearby, with a lot of food, and it takes only 10 minutes to drive there. The only drawback is that there is no toilet seat for babies (it’s not a parent-child hotel, forget it)

The front desk is equipped with ball equipment that can be rented for free, including basketball, football, and badminton. It's nice to play there. It's highly recommended. It's suitable for taking children to play during holidays. The environment around the hotel is also very good.

msg:Instead of spending money to buy tickets and crowd to visit scenic spots, it is better to live in the scenery. Yueyuanfang is the latter.
The hotel facilities are grand, the service is proactive and enthusiastic, and most importantly, the hotel is quiet, right in the park, with a lake and grass at the door and the window... Go downstairs and take a walk along the lake, it's great!
In short, satisfied and good reviews.

msg:The hotel is high-end, the location is quiet, and the room is large. There were many people in the hotel during the May Day holiday, but the service staff was still very enthusiastic. The facilities and equipment are very complete, the breakfast is rich in variety, and welcome fruit was given on the first day of stay. The butler Alan provided good service and I will choose this place next time.

msg:I chose this quiet hotel when I came to Wuhu for the holiday. The facilities are complete. There is even a power card in the room. The air conditioner and lights are always on, which is very considerate. Although it is the peak tourist season, the hotel's service still maintains the star level, especially Lucky who helped me check in. He has been very patient in introducing the details of the check-in. I hope the breakfast can be richer and have more Wuhu characteristics!

msg:I came to Wuhu on a business trip and chose the Yueyuanfang Hotel near the client. The hotel is downstairs from Yinhu Park, and the external environment is great.
I booked a preferred king-size bed room, which is very large, with a desk, sofa, and cloakroom. There are welcome fruits when I come back after going out for food and walking, which is very considerate.
The toiletries are complete, the bed is comfortable, and you can always choose the right pillow.
The shortcomings are that the air conditioner is a little loud, and the breakfast can be richer.

There are floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, and you can see the lake view indoors. It's super relaxing, the room is quiet and very clean and tidy, and the breakfast is also good, thumbs up!

msg:We arrived that night, and Lucyk at the front desk thoughtfully upgraded us to a lake view room. There were welcome fruits and some Wuhu specialty snacks in the room. Seeing that we had children, they also prepared children's toiletries. When the baby wanted to take a bath, they also gave him a bath set, which was very satisfying. The breakfast variety could be richer, and more attention could be paid to small details and hygiene~
