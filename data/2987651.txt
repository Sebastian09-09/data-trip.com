msg:One best beach resorts that I have been to here in China in the last couple of years.  It is a paradise for people who love to take pictures. It is a private beach resort and hence the beach is not crowded and splendid clean.  I stayed in a sea view room.  The views were amazing. The breakfast was very good with very nice staff. I would definitely recommend this place, and I am going back again this week with my colleagues.

msg:I went there because despite being far from everything, I don´t mind if it´s a nice place. I was lured by the nice pics with the blue sea, but what I found was disappointing, very calm, yes and so closed to the beach that you can hear the sea from the room. that I loved. What I didn't like much was that the water was brown-ish, I didn´t even dare to get in there.
As for the hotel, first the good thing: LEO in the front desk went far and beyond to help me with my requirements, really seemed like the only person there willing to help customers.
The room was clean, with a nice view and comfortable bed.
The hotel has a pretty floating church where you can take nice pictures, it[s popular for weddings as I could evidence.
Now, the not so good: Service wasn't as nice as you would expect for the price they charge; besides LEO, as I already  mentioned, and the nice lady at the entrance of the restaurant, the rest of the staff was rather uninterested and unpolite.  I went to the swimming pool the first day and there weren't any towels available. I asked one of the guys there (as of today I  don't know what they were doing besides sitting on a chair and spitting all afternoon) if they could get me a towel and they told me I had to go to the front desk to get one...it was a 10 min walk from the swimming pool). I asked also the lady in the little convenience store next to the pool and the answer was the same. I went, asked LEO, he apologized and got me a towel (took them 10 mins to get a clean towel for me) and I finally could go.
Breakfast buffet is mostly Chinese, and so is all in the hotel, mostly for Chinese couples who want to take nice pictures... I don't know what I was expecting, I though I would find a more foreigner-friendly environment, but I still have to learn to lower my expectations.

Another day we ask for room service,  the food arrived 1.5 hours later. In summary never go to this hotel in peak season. They are lack of workers. even the few staff they have they try their best to make you happy but i feel sorry for them cause the hotel administration do not give them big support. We will never come back here. Sorry for the good beach and nice facilities, but this vacations was terrible.

Public service facilities: The infinity pool is not big, and the hot springs in the hot spring area are all warm water with a very low temperature, estimated to be only 30 degrees, which is not as good as taking a bath in the room. There are no towels provided.
Scenic area: The beach sand is not fine enough, there are many shells, it is easy to scratch your feet, the water is very dirty, and it is not suitable for surfing.
Buffet: Breakfast is included in the room rate, there are not many styles, but it is acceptable. Lunch and dinner are 198 per person, the cost performance is very low, and it is not recommended to buy.
Overall: The facilities of the entire scenic area are old, and it is not recommended to go.

msg:During the May Day holiday, I chose to travel off-peak. This time, I chose Maoming Romantic Coast for my annual sea-viewing plan. After I moved in, I found that there are three hotels in this scenic area, and the external landscape is shared. Maybe because there are not many people, the originally good scenery is even more beautiful.
We booked a package with buffet breakfast and dinner, and the room was a listening room. Because the package stated that if there is a vacant room, it will be upgraded to a sea view room. The hotel also fulfilled its promise and helped us upgrade to a sea view twin room. It’s just that because of the low floor, you can only see the treetops. If you want to see the sea, you have to be on the 4th floor or above. Before checking in, I read the reviews saying that the hotel has been open for a certain period of time. Because it has not been renovated, there will be a musty smell. I personally think it’s okay, but the room is really damp, and the sheets and quilts are damp. It’s very uncomfortable to cover yourself. You need to turn on the air conditioner to slightly relieve it. In terms of food, although it is a buffet, as other comments say, it’s full, not rich, and many dinner dishes can also be seen at breakfast. Parking is a failure. For such a big hotel, there is only a tiny parking lot. No wonder cars are parked everywhere. It is hard to imagine the scene during a public holiday. I hope the hotel can improve the above aspects.

If there are so many people, it won't be replenished in time, and there will be a gap in availability. There are not many restaurants in the hotel. Apart from the buffet, we can only eat at the seafood stalls on the beach. The quality and taste of the dishes are very average.

The entire scenic area has many facilities, including Internet celebrity photo spots, hot springs, children's playgrounds, and small trains, which children love very much. What's more amazing is the hot springs. There may be fewer people, so it's really a good experience to soak in the hot springs while watching the sea. Xia Tian wants to check in again.

Then I took my luggage to the lobby door. The doorman saw that we were struggling to carry our luggage and didn't come up to help. He completely ignored us. They didn't even take the initiative to ask and then checked us in. The staff who checked us in seemed very impatient and wouldn't be polite and friendly to the guests? I just checked in. I just want to say that the staff should be well trained. They don’t have any sense of service in the service industry... When I went to the room, I made a note that the decoration was provided. But when I just entered, I wanted to take off my shoes and take a rest. When I stepped on it, the floor was all dusty and long. If you don’t have time to clean the room and only clean the hardware, it won’t work. The beach may be off-season because there are no people and there is no food. If you go, remember to bring some food first. The whole check-in to check-out experience is very poor. The only thing that makes me feel... The service provider is one of my colleagues on WeChat named Yandi. If you go to this scenic spot, you can either stay at the Sheraton for a few hundred more or stay at a famous hotel outside for a few hundred less. It is better than this hotel. I don’t recommend it! !

msg:As a regular customer, I have a feeling that the facilities in this hotel are like those of an elderly person. The interior decoration of the rooms has shown signs of time and is getting older year by year. The facilities, especially the toilets, are gray and dark. Depressed, have the relevant depar**ents considered rejuvenating it? Of course, the bedding such as sheets and duvet covers are still as white as ever, which I am very satisfied with. The buffet is rich in food and has many local specialties, which is worthy of praise. I also really like the two small libraries in the scenic area, which I often come to on vacation. The reason is that it is very suitable for reading and sitting inside. It is quiet and comfortable. I would like to give you a suggestion, pay attention to the time and place when playing music. The music in the Poetry Hall is too noisy, and inappropriate rock music is played non-stop. I wanted to take a walk in the forest. Enjoy the poetic and quiet environment, but the result is very disappointing.

msg:The view from the room is very good, but there is a lot of noise at night. It is not the sound of fishing boats, but the sound coming from the bungalow in front, which somewhat affects the rest. Walking on the beach is very pleasant and comfortable. But remember that you must book a room online before coming in, otherwise you will need to pay 80 yuan for a ticket and 10 yuan for a bus ticket. After entering, you need to pay the high price before you can refund, which is a bit of a trap! The room price of more than 1,000 per night (Saturday) does not match the price, and the facilities are outdated. But Manager Zhou at the front desk has good service, is warm and thoughtful, and even provides fruit in the room, which is good! I ordered a meal in the evening and repeatedly stressed that I wanted a bottle of cold beer, but it was not delivered. As for whether the money was overcharged, we were confused and did not pursue it. The hotel's food offerings are average, so it's enough to fill you up.

After watching the show, we went to take a hot spring bath (the service staff were very nice). Everyone said they were very happy with the trip.

msg:The hotel lobby is magnificent and facing the sea view. After the typhoon, the air is fresh. The waiters are very polite and thoughtful. Thanks to Candy zhou at the front desk for upgrading us to the supreme invincible sea view room for free. The room is spacious, comfortable and clean, with all supporting facilities. In addition to the favorite beach, there are buffets, hot springs and swimming pools. The surrounding traffic is very convenient. I originally planned to stay for one night, but because I love the sea view and the beach so much, I stayed for two nights. As long as you go to the beach, this is the first choice.

msg:A hotel with a full sense of experience, the overall feeling is that the price/performance ratio is very high. And there are few people. Because the scenic spot is exclusive, outsiders need to collect tickets. At present, it is mainly for hotel guests to play, and often enjoys a piece of facilities exclusively. Therefore, it is recommended to invite a few children to experience the experience together. We stayed for two days in a row. The next day was close to the Dragon Boat Festival, and there were a little more guests. There were children playing with our baby in the swimming lane, and the baby was very happy.
Facilities: very complete, infinity swimming pool, water park, children's playground, Wanghai hot spring, seaside bar, and various facilities for taking pictures, churches, logos, etc. There is also a small wave pool in the hot spring area. From the perspective of facilities, it has indeed achieved the feeling of a Southeast Asian resort. The only shortcoming is the lack of a**osphere, and it often enjoys various facilities exclusively. It may be that we came in the off-season and there were too few people.
Service: The manager Wen Jimei at the front desk is very nice and attaches great importance to customer experience. He helped us upgrade the room, gave us a fruit plate, and took the initiative to add WeChat to provide various warm services at any time. Some guests commented that it is too far to go to the children's playground and there is an additional charge for the shuttle bus. We were also lucky. When we went there, we saw a bus filled with guests. They gave us a ride. When we came back, we asked the front desk of the hotel. He also said that we would be exempted from charges that are required to be charged according to the regulations. It is more appropriate for the hotel to waive this fee directly. There is no additional cost, but it is very important for the guest experience, because the children's playground is really far away. Such a good playground will be built in vain if no one goes there, and the facilities will easily break down.
Hygiene: Not bad, some customers say this place is old, we think it is still acceptable. Compared with Sheraton, it feels more cost-effective, because all hardware facilities in scenic spots are shared.
Environment: private beach, exclusive access to a beach. The sand is very fine, but the water is not pure blue. The scenic spot is very large, and I heard that there are 5 kilometers of beaches. The only thing that feels insufficient is that the surrounding facilities are not enough. Except for meals in the hotel, I don’t know what to eat for other meals. There are several food stalls within a few minutes’ drive from the door, and the products are not good.
I feel that there are still good tourism resources along the coast of Guangdong, but it lacks the overall environment to become a city. I heard that Fangjidao diving has also been developed. I feel that the local tourism bureau needs to work harder. This area can become a good one. tourist area.

msg:I have to comment: 1. The seaside is still very fun, the coastline is very long, and children can play for a long time! 2 The water park and swimming pool are too small, such a small swimming pool in such a big hotel, it will be crowded if a few more people come! 3 Breakfast, we are a parent-child room, only includes breakfast for one child. The second-child policy has been in place for so long, and the other child has to make up for breakfast, and the breakfast is not delicious. The buns are half hot and half cold or hard. ! 4 The hot spring is not bad, but it is next door to the Sheraton, and the staff goes to work at 3 o'clock every afternoon to change the water, which is very comfortable!
In short, I think this Wyndham is a few grades worse than Changde Reshi Wyndham. The hardware facilities are too poor, and the shower nozzles in the room are broken. It's really not worth the price.

msg:Overall, it's okay, but it's more suitable for couples to vacation, and it's average for families with children.
First of all, I would like to remind you that if you are traveling by high-speed rail, if you want to pick up and drop off at the hotel, you must be optimistic about the departure time of the hotel in advance. At the hotel, we waited for almost two hours at the high-speed rail station on the way out, and we called a car directly on the way back, and the cost was about 120. The hotel only has a buffet on Fridays, Saturdays, and large-scale holidays. The price is not bad, and it is relatively rich. For the rest of the time, you need to go to the street in front of She Xton to have a restaurant. The price is of course expensive, but the taste is still good. Can. The formal staff of the hotel are well trained, and the service is relatively good. What about the temporary workers... For example, the old aunt who cleans the hotel lobby, and the staff responsible for cooking or cutting in some buffets have a poor attitude. I am still the first I once saw the staff yelling at the guests in the restaurant of the 5-star hotel, and not just once, I saw it a few times during the stay, haha, it was so funny. The location is not bad, it's very close to the beach, a bit closer than the Sheden, and it's quieter. At night, the beach on Wen's side is very windy, and Xi's side will be better. The sand on the beach is very clean and fine, and the ecological protection is very good. There are many small crabs and hermit crabs. The decoration of the hotel lobby is very good, in Balinese style, the room is large, the TV is very small in comparison, and the decoration of the bathroom and toilet is relatively old and like a fast hotel, and the disposable toiletries are also very fast hotel. There are welcome fruits, which is very considerate. The hot spring is at Xi's side, and it's quite close to it. Because it's off-season, there are not many open pools, and the decoration is very beautiful, with a Southeast Asian style. I didn't go to the parent-child paradise, it took 20 minutes to walk, and there was no shuttle bus. The hotel's swimming pool has unlimited access, and the service attitude is good. The water church is actually not allowed, unless you have made an appoin**ent to take wedding photos. As for the hotel's sea view room, it depends on luck. Our location this time is average, and we can't see much of the sea, mainly blocked by trees, unless we live on the 5th or 6th floor.

She swiped her card to enter without knocking on the door. At that time, she called the hotel, but the hotel firmly said no. It depends on the monitoring and processing time. It's been a long time, but the intruder is still outside the door, so the police should be called at that time. The experience is extremely poor, and there is no hotel management at all. Everyone, add some money and go to the Sheraton next door. Ordinary sea view rooms do not have sea view, please be aware. More than a thousand yuan is not even safe. Not as good as a homestay.

The lobby and yard are a bit like Wyndham, and the facilities in the room are old It's broken and feels like an outdated economy hotel. The room type is also very strange. The so-called scenic spot I am in is just a hotel, and I specially set up a room type with an extra 10 yuan including tickets. In fact, it is to charge an extra 10 yuan. The business routine is too low-level. The sanitation is also average. Fortunately, the beach and sea view are not bad, otherwise I would regret going to such a remote place and staying in such a dilapidated hotel. Attached is a picture of the socket, Wyndham is still using this cheap panel from the 1990s, and the bedside socket doesn't even have a USB port, this boss is too stingy...

msg:Overall cost performance: 4 points (out of 10 points) 3 big and 1 small parent-child rooms only have breakfast for 2 adults
🌹Advantages:
1⃣️The little sister at the front desk has a good service attitude; when you arrive at the hotel, there is a little brother who greets you and takes your luggage to the room
2⃣️The hotel is located in the romantic coast 4A scenic spot; you need to show the reservation information when you drive in, and you need to check the room card every time you enter
3⃣️♨️The hot spring is at the Sheraton, and there are many kinds of hot spring pools. (The staff is from Sheraton and the service attitude is very good. It is understood that the Sheraton and Wyndham hotels in this area are all owned by the same owner)
❌ Disadvantages:
1⃣️The price/performance ratio is not high, compared with the Maoming Yujing where I stayed two days ago (the room facilities are old and new, and the corresponding speed of the service is not comparable)
2⃣️Environment: The hotel near the sea may be seriously corroded. The rooms and all the facilities are very old. We booked a parent-child duplex room with three big and one small, and the lighting is not bright enough (but the overall hotel style is like this. I understand that personal preferences vary from person to person. Fortunately, the children like the style of the two-story log cabin spire very much)
3⃣️Service: The overall service is okay, the phone in the room is broken, I called the master to change the phone, and I sent two plantains and green dates into the room, which were not very delicious, and there were fewer staff, so the response speed was average. On the day of check-out, there are two elderly tour groups with a little more people
4⃣️Breakfast: The breakfast is quite rich, but the three adults in the parent-child room only provide breakfast for two adults, ➕1 person needs 128 breakfast fees, which is not worth it at all. They are also not allowed to pack, and even the unfinished bread and yogurt in the hands of children must remind us not to take it away. It feels very bad (do you still have to recycle it if you don’t finish it? It’s not very humane)
5⃣️Buffet dinner: It is only open every Friday and Saturday, and it is eaten at the restaurant at the door at other times. I wanted to experience it the night before I left. I went to see the dishes on the spot. It is not recommended at all, and there are very few seafood dishes (only white shrimp and snails) Other small cakes and beverages are not as good as breakfast), and the price of 258 people is not worth it at all. After reading the reviews of Dianping, I am glad that I did not buy a buffet dinner.
6⃣️ Playing: The beach🏖️ belongs to the internal scenic spot, and there are relatively few people. It is no different from the first beach. It may belong to the off-season. The children's playground, water park, and swimming pool are all average, and the hot springs are okay. There's nothing really going on in there.
7⃣️Surroundings: You have to drive to go out to eat, and there is nothing nearby, so it is not convenient
👩Overall recommendation index: 2 🌟 (full score 5 🌟)

In the hot spring fish pond, swarms of small fish surround each other, competing to eat the skin of their feet. At ten o'clock in the evening, when I returned to my room, something happened. The light was dim, and the old man stepped on the ground and fell, which frightened us a lot. We hurriedly helped the old man up, and placed him in the dry steam room to rest and check his injuries. The hotel is still some distance away from the hot spring area. The little brother in the scenic spot pushed a wheelchair, and everyone escorted the old man back to the hotel room.

Here, I would like to thank the manager Lin Shaochun of the Romantic Coastal Scenic Area. That night, she happened to be on duty. After receiving the call, Manager Lin brought medicines and equipment to the old man's room. She acts calmly, has some medical skills, and has experience in dealing with trauma. After her soft words and hands-on trea**ent, the old man's tension was relieved, the swelling in his knees gradually subsided, and his skin color returned to normal. After applying medicine to the wound, there was no serious problem. Manager Lin was busy until midnight and left after confirming safety. Early the next morning, I came to the door again to massage the old man's muscles and bones to relieve muscle soreness. After timely and safe trea**ent, the old man's actions returned to normal. After a night of fright, I finally let go. Here, I would like to express my special thanks to Manager Lin Shaochun. The handling of the incident showed extremely high professionalism and professional skills, which was recognized and praised by our whole family. Although there was a little accident during this trip, fortunately, the scenic spot was handled properly and the family was safe. Sincerely like the romantic coastal scenic spot, like manager Lin Shaochun 👍👍👍

After checking, you have to get off the bus to issue a ticket and register. I am afraid that someone will evade the fare! I have visited a lot of hotels in the scenic area, but this is the first time I have encountered such an unattractive hotel. The layout of the room is not transparent enough. The bathtub and bathroom area with the curtain drawn up is dimly lit and uncomfortable at all. Also there was a dead mouse in the hotel pool, that was horrible! The huge sewage pipe on the beach was exposed, exuding a foul smell, and suddenly cast a shadow on the sea.

All scenic spots in the scenic spot are free with a room card. There are quite a lot of programs in the scenic spot. There are performances, and there is also a big one for watching football games In the area, the TV screen should have a height of 6 meters, and the a**osphere is very good!

The service staff arranged for only one person to line up at the front desk, and the rest could go to the restaurant on the first floor for free afternoon tea. After checking into the room, the first thing I saw was that the sanitation was quite poor, and the toilet smelled like urine... In fact, this is a good solution. I flushed every corner of the toilet with a shower, and there was no smell. It can be seen that the waiter is too perfunctory in sanitation. . The trash can on the sink was only half high, and it was not fully lifted. The waiter who was doing hygiene still didn't lift it up the next day. Then the cabinets and tables in front of the TV were covered with a layer of dust. The buffet breakfast is average, nothing delicious. The hotel environment is good, there are not many people on the beach, after all, it is not the tenants who have to pay the tickets. Then the hot springs are also good, there are some shows on the beach, and the fireworks are just okay to watch. There are many surprising points in staying for three days and two nights. I asked the front desk to let the battery car come to the parent-child paradise to pick up the hotel front desk, and told me that it would cost 20 yuan per person. I was told to take a small train that shuttles across the beach at night and was told 20 children and 30 adults... There are no bathrobes for children in the wardrobe. The late check-out can only be up to 1:00. It is said that my room has been booked. In fact, everyone has already checked out on the afternoon of October 7th, and there are not many guests who come to check-in.

1. It took nearly an hour to wait in line for check-in, and I opened the previous guest reviews. This is a problem that has been criticized for a long time but has not been rectified.
2. The Haoting room booked is on the first floor, there is a lot of musty smell, and the room has no electricity. The master came to repair it for half an hour before restoring the power supply.
3. The child has diarrhea, asks the hotel if there is any anti-inflammatory or anti-diarrheal medicine, the answer is no, this hotel is located in a remote area, but there is no spare medicine?
4. Because I have to take care of uncomfortable children, I can't go to the hotel for breakfast. I asked if I could help you pack it and take it back to the room to eat. The reply said that the package will be charged at the price of a single order. Later, we went directly to the restaurant and begged to pack a bowl of white porridge for the children to eat. At first, we said no, but we reluctantly agreed after seeing that we had been standing beside us for a long time.
5. In the end, the child is in better health, so we hurried to the city and would rather stay in a business hotel than leave this ghost place.
I have stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels, I have never seen one like this, would never go again and would never recommend it to anyone!

Advantages: There is a high-speed rail station pick-up service. The room is facing the sea with a charming view. It is very convenient to walk a few steps to the seaside. shell.
Disadvantages: Children who have breakfast less than 1.2m will be charged, which is not reasonable. Secondly, the room hygiene needs to be improved, and the check-in time is later than the agreed time. It would be good if these points can be improved.

It is Mr. Cao who has been communicating with the monitoring and driving an electric car to accompany me to search the entire scenic spot. Later, the child was found in the corridor after surveillance instructions. In such a hot weather, he took the trouble to follow me around the entire scenic spot and comforted me. Thank you so much. The first time I stayed at the Wyndham Hotel, I will choose this hotel next time. Room breakfast was good. The staff are very kind.

msg:Since using Ctrip, it is the first time to seriously write a review!
During the summer vacation, the children wanted to come to the beach. They visited Poly Crown in Yangjiang and Shuangyuewan in Huizhou. For two nights, I didn't want to see the sea of people on the beach, so I chose Maoming, which I have never been to. There's not much to say about the hardware, after all, it has 7 years of use. The software is still relatively lacking and room for improvement. The style of the hotel is similar to the mangrove forest in Yalong Bay, Sanya. It was one of the filming locations for If You Are the One. It also spent the Spring Festival 3 years ago, so it can be considered a right to speak. Compared with the price, it is more expensive here. Of course, this is a major feature of Guangdong tourism. The price is expensive, and the corresponding software and hardware are not cost-effective compared with tourist hot cities. This is also the place where Guangdong's tourism industry is relatively lacking. Let’s go back to the hotel itself. Before I came, I had to choose between him and the Sheraton Hotel. When I arrived, I realized that this is a 4A scenic spot. There are 3 hotels in the scenic spot, and Sheraton is connected with them. The beach and off-site facilities are public. The scenic spot should be operated and managed by the local government, the public facilities in the outfield are not well maintained, and the beach hygiene is not ideal. Since the style is similar to that of the mangroves, let’s comment on the standard mangroves. The hardware is actually similar, after all, where is the service life. Starting from the doorman, he will not take the initiative to do a good job of greeting. The doorman of the mangroves remembered at the time that he was a Filipino, very active and enthusiastic, although it was all in the peak season. Before I came, I was worried about stepping on the pit, so I read some of the bad reviews, in order to adjust my psychological expectations and not to block myself. Most of the bad reviews are complaints about services, and a small number of complaints about hardware. So I don't have high expectations for the hardware. For a 2-night trip, I booked a starry sky and a tent room on the first night. The guy who checked in suggested us to stay in a hotel. The two outdoor room types were not very good. I took their advice. At this time, a female receptionist was replaced. I asked if I could change to a pool room. Because there were many children, I wanted a pool room for them to play, and told me that there was no room. I said you can still buy it on Ctrip. She said to add money. I was more angry at the time, not because of the extra money, but because I said no at the beginning. Added 400 yuan for a pool room. The guy in front I think adds points to the service, and the little girl in the back directly prototypes the service. During the communication process, I made it clear that someone else would help me check in, and I didn't want to communicate with this little girl. The lobby manager Cao Zhiruo helped to check in. I would like to commend Manager Cao here for his excellent service awareness and attitude. After experiencing the pool room for one night, my sister-in-law said it was too wet the next day. I communicated with the front desk and said whether I could change the sea view room. The price of the sea view is more than 100 cheaper than the swimming pool. How long did it take to say whether I could upgrade the suite. The little girl said no, but Manager Cao helped to upgrade the suite. I would like to thank Manager Cao to make me feel more comfortable. In the service complaints I saw in the bad review area, I actually saw that the hotel is also working hard to improve. However, the effect still needs to be improved. Most of the waiters are still locals, and the service awareness still can't keep up, so they need to continue training to change. If the maintenance and software (service awareness) can keep up, this place is actually a good vacation choice. After all, you don't need to look at the crowd, and this can attract many people like me who are afraid of the crowd. There is a flushing pool at the exit of the beach, but when you go down to the beach from the left, it is customary to return to the hotel after a circle. If a flush zone is added to the return point, the sanitary pressure of the room will be greatly reduced. Most of the people who come here during the summer vacation are parties with children. If a children's playground can be added indoors, it will be more in line with the choice of hotel guests. It is too sunny during the day, if there is a place other than the swimming pool to accommodate children, the evaluation of children will be much higher. After all, the choice of adults is basically based on the needs of children. What the hotel lacks most is the proportion of service awareness, not everyone has no service awareness. It's just more blunt and more casual. In addition, it is recommended that if you can choose, the sea view rooms on the 3rd to 6th floors should be given priority. The swimming pool on the first floor will be really humid.

If a guest is trapped in the elevator, the consequences will be disastrous. The waiters are also lazy. The price of a room is close to 2k, and the service and accommodation experience you get is totally worthless. The beach is not as beautiful as Hailing Island. Sincerely suggest that the hotel room should strengthen management, such as a dehumidifier in the room, improve the electrical circuit and increase the capacity, strengthen the training of staff, try to complete the cleaning and sanitation of the swimming pool during the rest time of the guests, so that the guests can enjoy all kinds of peace of mind when they wake up. facility.

msg:Leave your first bad review of a high-end hotel here! Sitting in a good location, the service staff has no intimacy at all, and they will ignore every question and answer! I asked to clean the room in the morning, but I still didn't clean it when I went back at noon. I didn't know about the attractions and traffic around the hotel! The service staff came to check the room, and directly opened the door without knocking on the door! A privately run hotel is not like this! Obviously, there is basically no training to recruit temporary workers in the surrounding areas. The level of this hotel's management is at stake for investors!

msg:The hotel is located in the romantic coastal scenic area, with a beautiful Balinese style environment. Lin Shurong’s meticulous service helped me upgrade to a sea-view room, facing the sea with invincible sea views. The bed is so comfortable that I don’t want to get up when I lie down. The rooms are large and bright, with balconies. The bathtub is not bad and also sent a disposable bathtub cover. Welcome fruits were also given. The breakfast is rich and there are many local specialty snacks. Thank you Lin Shurong for her service.

msg:I didn't give 1 star, but it is still comparable to a fast hotel. The normal check-in itinerary at 3 o'clock can only be checked in at 4:30, not a room. It is observed that dozens of people are like this. I heard that there are other Came at 12 o'clock and checked in at 4 o'clock. The reason is that there is no cleaning, and I don't know how they are trained in emergency response as a star hotel. Okay, let's go to visit and play other projects first, and then check into the room later, 1. The swimming pool is being cleaned, and it is cleaned at 4 pm? Why, I can't figure it out either. 2. You cannot enter the hot spring without a room number.
There was no follow-up response and communication.

I'm too lazy to reply to other questions in the room. I also experience the sea view myself. I'll know if I've been there. Star-rated hotels, everyone should go there.

🧹Hygiene: quite satisfactory

🚗 Transportation: It is about an hour's drive from the downtown area of Maoming. Now Bohe Avenue, which connects to the downtown area of Dianbai City, is under repair. There is a section of bad road. It is estimated that it will be much better after repairing.

🔔Service: Thanks to Manager Pan Wenhong for helping us upgrade the room. Listening to the sound of the waves at night is indeed very good to fall asleep, but it was the earliest night I slept recently when I came out to play

msg:The bad review is for the hotel's epidemic prevention policy. From entering the scenic spot to hotel check-in, dining, and hot springs, there is no need to show the health code and itinerary card. There are tourists from all over the holidays, including self-driving tourists from the epidemic area. The management makes me very uncomfortable. Now any store in downtown Maoming has to show the health code itinerary card. I really didn't expect such a large scenic spot that receives the most foreign tourists and such a star-rated hotel would be so irresponsible!

🧹Hygienic: The room is too damp, and the tide in August is even worse than returning to the southern sky. 1600 yuan per room, it feels very damp as soon as I enter it, and even the sheets are damp, which feels very uncomfortable. I have stayed in many seaside hotels in the province and none of them will be like this. In addition, there are super mosquitoes, there are mosquitoes everywhere in the scenic area, and the child was bitten by a big bag.
🍃Environment: The scenic environment is still okay. If the weather is not good, you will feel that the price is too bad.
🔔Service: When I first went in to check in, there was no waiter. Only one person handles the check in. There are not many people at first, but they have to line up. I booked a deluxe sea-view twin room for 1,600 yuan, but the waiter said that the view on the second floor is better, but the view on the fourth floor is not good. After reading it, I found that the 2nd floor was too humid, and the 4th floor was not visible at all, only the trees. At that time, I felt it was too bad.
Room facilities: The facilities in the room are very old, and the bathroom is very damp. The bathroom is simply disgusting. I don't even want to go to the bathroom. It is simply not worthy of the 4-digit price, and the Hampton by Hilton Maoming is much taller than it.
Scenic facilities: staying in August to send Wanghai hot spring coupons, it is okay not to send them, and going to the hot springs is all sorts of discomfort. When checking in, the front desk said that she could pick up the voucher on the official account later, but from three to five o'clock, she said that she had no time to enter the information, so she couldn't pick it up. Wait until the meal is over to get it successfully. Because the hot springs are open from 14:0-22:00. So I can only go to soak at night. But the hot springs have a long way to go to the locker room, up and down. Then, after changing the clothes, I walked this way again, which is 4 times to soak in a hot spring. What a brainless design! I saw only one waiter throughout the whole hot spring area, including the dressing room. No hot spring I've been to before is not so short of waiters. There are also super mosquitoes in the hot spring area, including changing rooms. I really want to leave soon. The overall feeling is that I never want to come again.
In general, the scenic spots and the beaches are still possible, but the facilities are outdated, the sanitation is not ideal, and the services are not in place. I don't know where the self-confidence requires a 4-digit house price!

Maybe because of bad weather and big waves, the water is turbid, it should be better if the weather is better. The rooms are clean and tidy, and the attitude of the service staff is first-rate! This kind of room is very comfortable for a family of three. The room comes with three breakfasts, which is very convenient! The romantic coast is still very emotional, but the performance at night seems too amateurish, especially the host. The firework show is more comfortable to watch on the balcony of the room.

msg:This comment is written to friends in Guangfo area, hoping to help them when choosing a tourist destination.
Leaving aside the price, the 4-hour drive to the romantic coast is not worth it. The beaches here are not better than those in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Yangjiang. The sand is fine, but the sea is dirty and the waves are big. It's impossible for you to see the blue color of promotional photos. Apart from this beach, there is no other place to play in this area. The scenic spot is messy and messy, and there is not even a decent restaurant outside.
Then, for the dining in the scenic area, we tried the Seafood City and used soy oil to stir-fry. We really couldn't get used to it.
Next, let’s talk about our staying experience:
1. The room facilities are outdated and the sanitation is extremely poor. The bottom of the bed was not clean, there were lots of hair and a dead cockroach. The smoked paper has tea stains.
2. The pool water is turbid, and the pool is open to non-hotel guests. Having stayed in so many hotels, it is the first time I saw someone smoking by the pool, not just one or two. People who want to take children should be cautious.
In fact, I have been growing grass for this hotel for a long time, and watching the price of its pool room go from more than 900 on weekdays to more than 1,800 in summer vacation, we are all here. I was really disappointed and regretful, and guilty, because three families followed me. The face is dull.

msg:住：訂的海景雙床房，住在4層，經常出遊感覺設施達不到五星級標準，看過很多人評價屋內潮濕，確實這幾天每天都時不時的下雨，確實潮濕，空調衹有製冷制熱兩種模式，沒有除濕，衞生間較小，設施比較舊。
服務：勝在服務態度非常好，特別是前台陳曉霞，接待時加了微信，有問必達，向保潔員提出更換浴巾增加牙刷等需求都會滿足，態度都很友好。
吃：這裏點不來外賣，吃飯基本就指着兩個酒店的餐館，感覺需要説明的是喜來登和温德姆是連着的，從廊橋就可以過去，温德姆一層的望海餐廳開放自助晚餐，喜來登的7層愛麗絲餐廳開放午餐可單點，外面的海鮮坊貴而且亂，第三桌到的，2小時都上不齊菜，沙灘吧那邊的燒烤、椰子雞飯等等中午都不開。
娛樂：温德姆一層可到無邊泳池及小童水世界，喜來登一層可到温泉，沒開放spa，白天就這些地方和海邊，晚上往西走浪漫海岸鞦韆、燈光、浪漫沙灘吧節目、煙花，基本就是全部了。
其他：酒店提供洗衣服務，海景房有陽台，陽台有晾衣架、桌椅。泳池房有泳池，不對其他房客開放，但看評價説泳池房更潮，而且外圍因為設立了樹木遮擋房間不明亮。

msg:第一，1600多的酒店，帶兩個娃進園區，居然還要收一個人的門票～
第二，入住時，我諮詢前台晚上音樂節什麼時候開始，態度很差，頭都不抬，説大概8點到9點，叫我到時自己去看……也不和客人説哪個電梯上樓，才知道每棟樓不同電梯～
第三，衞生間很臭很臭，地板很多泥～洗手枱全是水……
第四，門卡那一直響，上來人修了一次以後，半夜繼續響通宵～～
第五，入住時説了要小童洗刷用品，還是沒有～
第六，離開的時候下雨，車在露天停車場有一段距離，沒傘，問門口的工作人員也不理，顧着指導門口停留的車……
（經過隔壁的喜來登看起來乾淨豪華很多）

msg:先説環境，酒店位於旅遊區內，如果是帶娃度假，你可能會忽略掉這家酒店所有的缺點，畢竟出門就是海灘，撿貝殼，篝火，表演還是很精彩的。
園區內三家酒店這家位置最好，我定的一樓泳池房小朋友很喜歡。
再説缺點，入住讓門僮幫我送行李，結果把背包給我掉水池裡了，趕緊撈上來，已經進水了，電腦還好，我的工作優盤全都泡水，現在還不敢試一下壞了沒。酒店説幫我把包洗洗，結果洗了後濕噠噠送回來了，我要求烘乾了再給我。烘乾後包也廢了，軟塌塌。
再説早餐，咖啡機壞了，我看有個廚師樣的人在擺甜點，跟他説了後，他告訴我，去找服務員，是的，用命令的語氣。好的我住酒店還要區分廚師和服務員，問錯了就得再找服務員問嘍。
房間很潮，設施很舊，睡着不舒服。跟網上大多數評價一致—大房間，快捷酒店配置。
温泉無限次進出，男士泳褲68一條，小朋友泳衣一百多一個。
總結:這是一家位置非常好的舊酒店，管理不是很到位。

1.親子酒店沒有睡覺的小童圍欄，這點很差；
2.衞生的話，猶豫十一黃金週，所有東西都弄得很潦草；
3.客房服務經常漏掉，要多一床被子。客房服務答應的好好的，結果一整天還沒送來，打電話再問，就説沒有了，不夠了，那你可以主動通知呀，一定要再催了才説沒有……
4.答應送的歡迎水果也是，兩天連住説給兩天歡迎水果，結果兩天中一天都沒給，打電話給前台催了。兩天都打了，第二天下午五點才送來可憐的一點點……
5.作為親子酒店，沒有室內小童活動的地方，白天要要衹能嗮太陽
總結:不值，如果真的要去浪漫海岸的話， 去旁邊的喜來登吧，完全不推薦這個温德姆。

msg:酒店在電白縣，擁有較長的海岸線，沙灘沙子很細，酒店是東南亞風格，如果是夏天應該是一個不錯3天2夜休閑旅遊地方（不用多時間，因為沒有太多東西可玩）。但這次春節假期入住卻感覺一般，首先是酒店人手不足，原來3點的規定入住時間，到6點都還沒工作人員收拾房間，電話投訴了才有人來收拾（後來攜程酒店管家協調解決了問題，好在是通過平台預訂，不然真投訴無門）。其次沿着海岸線走了一圈，除了海灘和望海温泉外，其他設施都很破舊，30分鐘左右可以把園區所謂的景點走完。酒店裡有餐廳，但價格稍貴，酒店周邊也沒有太多飯館，後來找了一家酒店附近的禧臨飯店。飯店出品還可以，價格便宜，但是是家庭式經營，沒有形成流程化製作，所以每個菜等待上菜需要很好很好的耐心，我們等待上完5個菜用了一個小時。如果不介意開車，可以去陳村海鮮城吃海鮮，大約距酒店35分鐘車程，是本次旅行最滿意的一家餐館。

msg:沒想到這次春節在這個所謂的五星級酒店壞了心情。
27號早上約11：00小朋友在酒店餐廳吃早餐後肚子不舒服，因此致電酒店前台需要延遲退房，5星級酒店的服務就是半小時都沒有人聽電話！！後來答應延遲退房到13：30，孩子在床上休息。這是被壞了心情-1
由於當天要開車趕回廣州，我就沒下去吃早餐，妹妹幫忙順便打包了早餐上來，就問問小朋友吃了什麼，剛好打包裏面有她吃過的果醬，結果發現是過期的，當時十分震驚，馬上通知酒店，酒店人員20分鐘後上房間查問情況，並説馬上安排檢查。這是被壞心情-2
大約到1：30工作人員來房間説，已經安排檢查，沒有發現過期食品，第一時間還問我妹是不是記錯了！這是涉及污衊人格！我妹妹當時馬上提出100%配合公安，食監一起處理事件，酒店並無執行，而是一直拖到近兩點説免我們半天房費。當時我們最重要的想法還是擔心會食品管理不善，會影響到其他客人，所以我們提出對酒店處理不滿意。我們付了全款房費，按時退房，要求酒店總經理介入重視處理並回復處理結果。這是被壞了心情-3
在趕路期間，酒店杜姓副總電話聯繫我，因為在開車，沒有詳談，由於春運回程高峯期，小朋友拉肚子晚了離開，堵死在路上，不得不在中途在定酒店休息，結果到晚上11點多才到，聯繫杜姓副總，結果答覆更加堅定，説他們已經嚴查，沒有發現任何過期食品，並表示會把調查的程序及現場照片微信提供。到了第二天一直説忙，直至晚上我們回到廣州家裡，微信聯絡杜，才發文字一段（付截圖），依然堅持食材沒有問題，且沒有提供處理事件的過程和結果，並污衊我們自帶果醬去酒店，這個就是人身攻擊了，我妹氣得一晚沒睡。這是被壞心情-4
真的沒想到一家五星酒店會這樣處理事情！我們已經把相關事件投訴到相關部門，而且我們將全力配合監管、公安等調查，肯定會追究此事，要酒店給個説法，其中涉及到侮辱造謠的相關部分，我們也會通過法律手段維權。

硬件日常維護真的需要重視，不建議大家住豪庭房，尤其是一樓，非常潮濕，尤其是有長者家小孩的，真的會有安全隱患。
另外地面不平，洗手間中間積水要我自己用拖鞋刮進洗手盆下的下水。酒店去泳池區的路積水也很嚴重。
早餐作為這種經濟型酒店算是可以交差，品類還是覆蓋到。但是衞生條件非常需要改善，咖啡機上面都是螞蟻和小蟑螂等小動物。但是覺得人家開個酒店不容易，我就不上載視頻了。
就看酒店怎麼定位自己了，有水上樂園設施，但是卻沒有小孩的牙刷和拖鞋。我覺得海邊玩水不一定都是情侶，還是要考慮的全面一點。要不就改名叫温德姆浪漫海岸情侶酒店。

msg:酒店位置離廣州挺近的，高鐵到站有巴士接送，但是要提前預約，巴士直接到温德姆大堂門口，一下車特別震撼，一眼望去，連通後面的無敵海景，跟海陵島的洲際酒店大堂一個風格，但是藍色景觀池和海就成了一線，特別美麗，舒服。入住辦理速度很快，接待員的態度很好，熱情！房間衞生乾淨，環境也很好，美食街這邊的海灘很漂亮，往西邊去有一個海上墟，早上來買到漁民剛回來的海鮮，我是看了好一會發現，本地人的海鮮價格是便宜一些，哈哈哈，不過我們是遊客，買到新鮮的也就滿足了，立刻拿到旁邊的海鮮城加工，鮮美的黃尾魚湯，鹽都不用放，優秀！退房我們向前台申請延遲了1小時，然後坐了13;30的巴士走的，行程完美！忘記分享一下早餐廳了，環境很好，出品不錯，品種很多，下個月還來！

然後，開了房間，上一家走的衞生還沒收拾好！一直到晚上7點半，都沒有收拾完衞生！！！離譜嗎？？？即便過年期間，遊客也非常多！既然人多又貴，1300多一間房的五星酒店，衞生人員就不能多安排一些嗎？？節省這點成本搞笑呢？？太差勁了！！
我們一晚上沒到房間休整，都在外面轉悠，那個望海温泉，沒有任何服務員，沒有桑拿，沒有spa，就是一個孤魂野鬼的温泉。
那個親子樂園更搞笑，離酒店無比遠還陳舊簡陋沒有服務人員，適合拍鬼片。
如果有陽光，5樓房間海景視野是不錯，海岸也不錯，其他的放寬心吧，要不就剩生氣了。

帳篷營地濕氣很重，打開一股黴味，東西都比較臟，好像沒人維護。
總體：住裏面的常規酒店房間的話推薦，不推薦帳篷營地。

msg:很好的酒店，地理位置優越，面海，很近沙灘，酒店的停車位是地面的，距離温德姆最近的是B區，大堂門口也有幾個停車位的。進去大堂就感覺很氣派，特別的高大上，大堂有三層樓那麼高，設計非常東南亞，前台辦理入住才2分鐘，很快！給我辦理入住的妹子笑容很親切，很耐心回答，給我免費升級了海景，房間有個大大的陽台，看海真心不錯，房間也乾淨，設計也是簡約東南亞風，床墊睡的也舒服，剛剛好。早餐在7樓，餐位不多，位置特別好，望海的，落地玻璃前有個泳池，和海天成一色，還可以看日出！環境太棒了！有機會還開，值得推薦！

msg:1.入住排隊現場管理極差，安排實習生似的員工無法做好引導，約束。導致很不自覺的客人插隊，吵架。
2.房間一開冷氣就濕噠噠，走進走出馬上就臟兮兮。
3.洗手間淋浴間地板隔水槽非常滑，槽裏都是黃黃的污漬。
4.整體衞生一般。
5.晚上煙花表演就是隨便放幾個煙花禮炮。
6.叫個送餐服務炒飯意粉一個小時送不到。
7.停車門口下客居然還被保安趕，態度惡劣。到高鐵站接送的車幾家酒店拼單，居然間隔要等兩個小時。
8.景區內餐廳出品就是抹黑茂名電白，博賀漁港。

總體酒店熱鬧，還有節目，篝火晚會，煙花，孩子很開心！
房間情況也很整潔、乾淨！早餐自助也還可以。

msg:符合預期的一次週末放鬆，第一次來茂名。
酒店裝修用心，環境不錯，硬件設施到位，特別是温泉很棒，温泉的設計和服務也是用了心的。
所在的浪漫海岸是個一票制景點，間接控制了人流量，也避免了國內免費海灘常見的過度商業化，整體規劃和維護得很好。漫步海灘偶有驚喜（對海洋生物愛好者來説），當然也可能是驚嚇，比如這次，海灘上直徑半米的擱淺水母你敢信
但酒店沒有配套太多把人留下來多住幾天的活動，以致於住兩天以上就沒啥新意了。也可能是因為3月屬於淡季，加上省內疫情影響，很多設施不開放?
服務上整體不錯，人手偶爾有些不足，畢竟此時入住人數少，可以理解。至於人手多緊張呢，入住時的禮賓部門小黃，當晚一個人搞定前台，第二天坐上電瓶車，發現駕駛員也是他，很精幹。

再説有待改進的地方：酒店的服務其實有待提高，服務意識和與客户交流的方式方法都有待改進；衞生情況衹能説一般，畢竟很多遊客玩好沙灘回到房間會造成酒店客房設施老化較快，衞生間的燈光更加造成有點臟臟的感覺。酒店的健身房眯眯小，酒店還沒有室內恆温的泳池。
