Don’t be crowded during National Day 🗺️ Perfectly avoid crowds! Give me a life in any location 🏖️I have always wanted to spend a night on a small island. Unexpectedly, I found this secluded island, just on Taihu Lake - [Sanshan Island]
The island is not big, but it is a dream island that allows you to escape from the chaos of the world for a second! As soon as you enter the island, you can smell the rich fragrance of osmanthus floating in the air! Autumn is perfect to come here🍂
🚢To go to the island, you need to take a cruise ship [Changqi Wharf] which is about 1 hour away from the center of Suzhou on the high-speed rail. (After driving for half an hour and entering the Taihu Lake Resort Scenic Area sign, it will suddenly become clear. Driving along the edge of Taihu Lake is particularly pleasant)
Scenic spot tickets are required to go to the island🎫78💰/boat tickets🎫20💰single trip/you can park in the parking lot of the pier🅿️25 a day by car
📍B&B recommendations:
🏡Sanshan Island Humengji Designer Hot Spring B&B
⛳️Address: Get off the boat from Sanshan Island and walk to the right side of Xianqi Pier for about 5 minutes (you can also contact the B&B shuttle bus in advance to pick you up)
Humengji is probably the most beautiful B&B on the island. There is a huge swimming pool as soon as you enter the door🏊 It feels like traveling through Bali in a second. There are a row of beach chairs beside the swimming pool and various green plants. Just post on Moments and ask directly!
The hardware facilities of the B&B are also very complete. There is a bathtub🛁There is a private swimming pool, a Nut projector and a full set of Dyson hair dryers. It frees your hands and doesn’t need to bring anything. It’s great!
Every night at 7:30 you can sit outside by the pool and watch an outdoor movie 🎬The evening breeze is blowing and the a**osphere is full! The rhythm of a proper vacation⛱️There are not many people and it is quiet. If the weather is good, you can see the sunrise and sunset on the island. The lake will also turn blue, just like at the seaside🏝️The air on the island is also very good, and you are really close to nature. There are various fruit trees on the island, including pomegranates, oranges, etc...
🏝️For more real store visit notes🥳Remember to follow me~
🏝️It’s not easy to organize, please click 👍🏻 to encourage me‼

The store was very enthusiastic and showed us around the entire homestay. The environment is comfortable and cozy. I took my two children and upgraded the room for free. It is indeed a queen room. There is a bathtub in front of the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, directly facing the swimming pool. It is definitely this homestay It’s C seat.

msg:Suzhou, traveling with children, independent swimming pool, using these few keywords, I found this homestay on Ctrip, and thus knew about Sanshan Island. On the island, children experienced many firsts, the first time they took a boat in the lake Picking lotus pods, the first time I touched the big lotus leaves, and the first time I saw the salted egg yolk sunset in the center of the lake without shelter. The butlers in the homestay are warm and polite, and the service is in place. If the boss is free, he will drive the island’s unique battery car to go around the lake. Compared with riding a four-person bicycle by himself, it is much easier. If there is a chance, I will stay here next time to make up for the starry sky and fireflies that I did not see this time.

This is the most beautiful homestay I stayed in Sanshan Island. I took my children to Suzhou by car and took a boat for about 20 minutes to arrive at the island~ There is a tour bus to pick us up at the homestay. The check-in service, the environment, and the food are beyond expectation. The environment is very clean, the room smells fresh, and the facilities are complete. Watching the sunset in the evening and the sunrise in the morning, there is a lawn and a swimming pool downstairs, and there are movies in the evening. Mothers and children are very happy. You can dine in the hotel, and the food is very delicate. Sitting on the balcony or taking a walk in the morning and evening is very pleasant. It is far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I can only hear various birdsong, and I feel calm. The room is spacious, clean and hygienic, with complete facilities and comfortable bedding. The public area is spacious, even if you don’t go out, you can feel comfortable in the B&B. Staff service is very good. Brother Hu is great! Very friendly to children 👬Thank you

msg:This well-designed hotel on Sanshan Island in Suzhou has always been a place I miss. This trip coincided with the Qixi Festival, which made me look forward to the encounter with the hotel even more. I paid attention to this hotel early on, and heard that it has unique design, considerate butler service, and exciting self-driving experience. When I arrived, I found that I could park my car at the pier, so that I could choose to take a passenger boat or a speedboat to Sanshan Island, and the hotel butler also reminded me to reserve a boat to avoid being disturbed by the waves.

After going to the island, the butler warmly welcomed us and upgraded the room, which made me feel extremely warm and pleasantly surprised. The layout of each room is unique. The spacious living room, comfortable bedroom and well-designed bathroom space all exude a strong sense of comfort. In the evening, the owner of the hotel personally led us around the island and introduced many magnificent scenic spots, just in time for the sunset, which made people intoxicated. At night, I had the honor to revisit the fireflies that I hadn't seen for many years. This long-lost joy made the whole journey more fulfilling and enjoyable.

The dining experience in the hotel is equally satisfactory. In the restaurant, I can order meals as I like. Each meal includes four dishes and one soup, chicken, fish, braised pork and other choices, which fully satisfy my taste buds. As a hotel characterized by design, it not only pays attention to details in the guest rooms, but also pays great attention to the design of landscaping and public areas. Every corner is a beautiful picture, especially against the backdrop of the sunset, it seems to be in a foreign resort, giving people a sense of tranquility and coziness.

In the end, I finally got my wish and came to this hotel with my beloved, and left beautiful memories with it. This walk-and-go trip is not just an experience, but also a new attempt. I firmly believe that this sincere beauty will accompany me and become my treasured memory to pursue more beautiful moments.

The villages and plants are very down-to-earth. It is also good to take the children to see the lifestyle of the previous generation with their own eyes. The grandma who washes clothes in the pond will think wow, so it used to be like this. It is a pity that the sudden drop in temperature did not allow my little friend to enter the swimming pool for a swim. If there is a chance in summer, he will come again✌🏻 In fact, the telescope on the top floor can make a real one Yes, if the guests don’t care about it, you can rent it. I wanted to take my friends to overlook Taihu Lake, but my father found that the telescope was just a decoration!

Swiss wine management graduates are really picky about hotels several times. They have never liked B&Bs very much. The previous few B&Bs were not satisfactory. This visit to Humengji can be said to be a fate➕coincidence, a trip that just goes away.
I was going to Banyan Tree Anji, but when I consulted later, I booked a room because the boss said "Our island is very beautiful, come and take you to play".
First of all, let’s talk about the room. It’s a very unique room. I have always been fond of and curious about lofts, so I chose Tianqing. The layout is very distinctive. It’s different from traditional hotels. The design sense will be stronger, so don’t get too entangled. some layout.
The great thing about the bathroom is that it is separated from wet and dry and has two sinks. If you are traveling with friends, that is a great thing! !
The most important thing is the environment of the entire homestay, which is really good. It feels like a foreign private courtyard. There are three main buildings, the book bar ➕ housing ➕ restaurant. The swimming pool, lawn and scenery are integrated into one. The overall building is really beautiful! !
The boss and the housekeeper are also very nice. The boss's coffee is delicious. Xiao Hu has been taking me to play, and took pictures of me patiently. He is really taking me to play (personal travel), and he also prepared hot pot by the pool for me. ➕The surprise of the open-air movie made me very satisfied with this walk-and-go trip~
The next day I pushed the company's affairs, and chose to stay for another night, so that the happiness can continue. The boss helped me upgrade the room very well, let me experience different room types, and Xiaohu's Xinjiang barbecue in the evening, really so happy! !
The island is also really beautiful. Tao Yuanming’s Peach Blossom Spring is nothing more than that. If you want to escape the city, please come to this treasure island and get to know everyone in this treasure house~
I think the best interpretation of satisfaction is that I am willing to come again after staying here! ! Successful Amway gave to friends around~

From the beginning of the reservation, the housekeeper happily and patiently asked about travel details, and tried to meet all needs. After landing on the island, the elder brother of the hotel came to pick us up immediately, and also introduced in detail how to play on the island. The green mountains and green waters on the island, riding a bicycle or a small electric donkey, is very pleasant. There are also various small animals that pop out from time to time, beautiful flowers and plants, big friends and children are very, very happy here.
The boss said that the room on the roof can also be used for camping on the roof. The children were very excited and couldn't wait to live in a tent next time. There is also a room with a slide, hahaha

During the day, you can wander around the island, and at night, you can have a cup of coffee and relax. The boss is also very enthusiastic. Before going to the island, he will build a service group and inform you of precautions. We took the ferry to the pier and drove a car to pick us up👍

msg:I have never had high expectations for B&Bs in Suzhou. I saw the promotional video of this one and thought it was very beautiful. Plus, the price was also the price of a "first-tier B&B", so I booked a room with a price of more than 2,000 yuan. But the experience is average.
1. There is very little to eat. If you want delicious food, don’t worry about it. It can basically fill your stomach, and the price is not low. The coffee is only 50 or 60, and the quality cannot keep up with the price.
2. Breakfast is very simple, consisting of porridge, pickles, tomatoes, quick-frozen steamed dumplings with dry skin that you can’t bite into, and a small piece of yellow corn. Poached egg giant oil.
3. The room has just ordinary furnishings and nothing amazing, and the balcony is very dirty.
4. There is basically no service. Apart from pick-up and drop-off at the pier, there is no service at all.
5. There is not much to do around here. How about riding a tricycle or picking lotus flowers? Other than that, you can watch the sunset, but you have to go to a relatively far place and can't see it from the room.
6. For a price of two to three thousand, you can stay in a very good resort hotel. The service environment and food facilities are much better. This price-performance ratio is not high.
7. If it’s just for taking pictures, then special location framing is okay. But like me, it is purely for leisure, so there is no need to have high hopes.
Overall evaluation: five-star price, two-star experience.

預訂好就建了管家羣，響應很快。下船民宿車已經在碼頭等了，其實步行也就幾分鐘。接待的管家小哥人超好，是個很細心周到的i人🤭

民宿很出片，特別天氣好的時候
最在意衞生，進門轉了一圈非常乾淨
房間設施齊全，有浴缸冰箱智能馬桶戴森電吹風
泳池邊有投影牆，可以泡在水裡看露天電影
自帶咖啡館，一邊下午茶一邊看娃玩水超chill😌

首先，民宿額位置絕佳，坐落在三山島的心臟地帶，無論是欣賞湖景還是探索島上的景點，都非常方便。這真是一種難以言表的享受。
酒店的建築設計充滿了簡約高級，給人一種寧靜而温馨的感覺。床鋪柔軟舒適，衞生間設施齊全，一切都讓我感到非常滿意。
酒店的服務也非常出色。員工們熱情友好，總是面帶微笑，讓我感到非常歡迎。無論我有什麼需要，他們都會盡力滿足，讓我感到非常貼心。
總體而言，我對呼夢集的體驗非常滿意。這家民宿不僅提供了優質的住宿環境和服務，我強烈推薦這家酒店給所有來到三山島的遊客，相信你們也會度過一段難忘的時光。

我挑來挑去住進了【呼夢集】
這家民宿像一座城堡🏰
整體以簡約的白色為主基調
結合海島度假的元素
搭建了泳池/躺椅/鞦韆和草坪
甚至還有小型圖書館
從一眾民宿中脱穎而出，太美好了❗️

民宿的房間也有很多選擇：
星空房/山景影音房/全景房/滑梯泡池浴缸房...
除了好看，細節也很講究
（戴森吹風機也就算了，竟然還有針線包！）
早上8-10點提供早餐，非常豐富且可口
我個人最喜歡的是
晚上在泳池邊放映的露天電影
大家一起圍着看電影的感覺真的好棒啊

房間設施算不上特別好，但是很乾凈，晚上泡個澡看看夜景很舒服。
晚上在民宿吃的飯，提前一天點好，魚蝦都很新鮮，雖然價格小貴，但口味不錯。
很適合跟家人或者情侶之間來度假放空～

呼夢集在島上，需要坐渡船，由於酒店的服務人員悉心指引，順利到達酒店入住，房間也與圖片一致，沒有讓人心裏有落差，整個民宿都體現設計師的水準和老闆的用心。
酒店很安靜，服務人員也親切周到，讓人感覺自在和放鬆，躺在床上看看窗外的花園泳池也是一種享受。雖然天氣不太好，也變得不重要了。
這次來的季節不對，沒有體驗一下不錯的泳池，期待下次吧！

感受湖風，享受小島慢生活
ps：蘇州市區過來大概50公里，一個小時左右到長圻碼頭，之後停車在路邊（不收費），坐快艇大概十幾分鍾（風景蠻好就是會吹的沒髮型）

我住的月白是唯一一間有露台的，露台正好朝東，看日出好棒～還看到了滿天星星～但是月白是個閣樓，房間比較小一點，大家可以自己選擇。
老闆人很好，老闆的家人也很nice，能感受到淳樸的小島文化，走在路上大家都像認識的人一樣聊天打招呼。民宿小管家帶我們追夕陽，風很大景很美，隨時讓我下車拍照哈哈～超nice～
説説小島叭，這幾天是淡季，在島上玩的時候遇到的人不超過20個… 好多小店都沒有開，衹是吃東西比較不方便沒有太多選擇，喜歡安安靜靜看看自然風景的還是很不錯的。據説旺季人山人海… 
三山島呼夢集，下次見～
呼～

這次行程安排的很匆忙 在頂着40度烈日的情況下 一路汗如雨下💢💢‼️

下單後老闆會拉一個管家羣 入住前提醒上島事宜 自駕的朋友導航到“長圻碼頭” 緊接着去遊客中心購買門票後檢票坐遊輪🚢上島 當然預算充足的話還可以遊艇或者快艇～

每間客房都是不同的名字命名 風格各異 由於臨時更改時間 原本選擇的“山吹”更換為“山吹”如果這次天氣沒有這麼炎熱 體驗感一定會更棒 晚上老闆還會帶着繞島兜一圈🛺

游泳池的水很乾凈 跟兒子一起玩的還有其他房間的大小朋友 建議老闆再配幾個小朋友的泳池玩具 玩水更有樂趣。

早餐也很豐盛 晚上的菜品希望不要都是雙人餐起🥹 老闆忙前忙後的 真的很不容易 祝生意興隆！

每一次旅行都是一種對心靈的洗滌 希望自己一直在路上…

衞生：民宿不大，很衞生，泳池早上會有機器進行清理，水質看着不錯。民宿房間比較簡單，但是很乾凈

環境：整個民宿很安靜，主要是島上都沒有什麼人，真避世小島，島民們也都是大伯大媽，比較淳樸。

服務：民宿裏的服務還是非常到位的，我們的阿毛弟弟非常熱心還給我們指路吃飯的地方，一直問我們有沒有什麼需要的，服務非常周到。整個旅程非常輕鬆快樂，謝謝民宿裏的各位！

msg:刷到這家新開的高端民宿蠻吸引我的
在蘇州東山三山島，環境沒的説。
民宿特別漂亮，泳池超級大，
房間很喜歡，豪華舒適，
民宿裏面遊樂設施也比較豐富，還有飯菜也可口。
很棒的新店，預計會很火爆哈哈
