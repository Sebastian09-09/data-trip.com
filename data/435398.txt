msg:Hotel is located next to the lake with excellent views. Rooms are very big and clean. Staff are very friendly and supportive. Being a foreigner, language was a problem, however they supported us well, helped us in arranging for vegetarian dishes for dinner which wasn’t in the menu. So many facilities to enjoy and spend good time with family like small animal zoo, indoor and outdoor play areas, swimming pool etc., Food is so tasty and cost js very reasonable.

NOT for a couple with no children, unless it’s off holiday season, then it’s perfect for a 2-3 days getaway. 
Holiday season it’s too noisy.

msg:This is a great family hotel and is very well situated to the town center. We booked a family suit with three beds and the room was perfect. The whole hotel was clean, maybe becoming a bit dated, but not at all bad. The pool was really nice for the children although I remain puzzled at to why there are not so many places to sit eg Sun loungers or chairs….. there are only six loungers? Also there are some lovely positioned umbrella tables around the gardens, but with no chairs? The food is average and after trying we opted to eat out in the local town and some international hotels. All being said this is a fair priced hotel in a good location with a great pool and I would recommend it. What really makes this hotel is the staff will go out of their way to help you. I big shout out to 张静怡, who kindly greeted us upon arrival and kept in touch with us during our stay to ensure things were ok, 张静怡 even gave us a small food gift on departure….. she truly understands customer satisfaction. Well done

The shuttle to the railway is convenient,although the Concierge booked the wrong shuttle time,she drove us to the railway station so we won't miss our train. Indoor Playland was big compared to other hotels. Many activities such as paddle boat,kayak and jetski.  This place will be good during Summer because of the outdoor pools

The breakfast is very rich, especially the side facing the lake in the morning, the sun shines down on people, it is warm, comfortable and pleasing to the eyes.
There are dinners on weekends, which are equally rich, and the scenery facing the lake is also more beautiful.
This time staying in the hotel is particularly comfortable and happy😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊. It seems that I and the hotel are running in both directions. I live on the 5th floor. Aunt Liang, the room attendant, gave me a big surprise and helped to rearrange the room at night (we didn’t know it when we went out to play, and Aunt Liang also sent water thoughtfully.) I was very nervous about taking care of the baby, but Aunt Liang and other staff were very enthusiastic and friendly to me and the child. In the end, the baby didn’t want to leave and wanted to continue to stay😂😂😂
I didn’t expect that when I checked out, I was given a gift🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁🎁, some local snacks and water, so that my child and I could eat on the way!
Qiandao Lake itself is extremely beautiful, and the resort is built by the water. The staff is super friendly to the kids. I left my kids in the park and had a great time for the whole day. I recommend you go there, go there boldly, and don't be afraid if you are bringing your kids alone, hahaha!

msg:I spent three happy days at Kaiyuan Resort in Qiandao Lake. Overall, the whole experience was great. The children had a lot of fun, and there are a variety of entertainment facilities and activities here.
The children's playground in the resort, Auto Town, has become the favorite of children. There are all kinds of slides and amusement equipment here, and the children have a lot of fun in it. They are reluctant to leave every day. In addition, this requires a ticket.
I also saw cute little animals in the cute pet park, and the children can interact with them.
The sand play activities on the beach of Sensen Sports Field also made the children enjoy it and had a lot of fun. As for other facilities, they didn't play much because they were too young.
Although the other swimming pool is not big, the children also have a lot of fun. You can rent a swimming ring for 10 yuan, and the children can play very vigorously by themselves.
Although the room is a bit compact, the view makes up for everything. Looking out of the window of the room, you can see a beautiful lake view. When you wake up in the morning, you can feel the fresh air and tranquility on the lake by opening the window, which is very comfortable.
Finally, I would like to thank our caring little housekeeper "Xiaoxiao". Her service is meticulous and she will help solve any problem as soon as possible. Her thoughtfulness makes people feel warm. What is touching is that when we left, we forgot to bring some things. Xiaoxiao not only helped us find them, but also mailed them to our home for free. It was so thoughtful. Overall, this experience at Kaiyuan Resort not only made the children spend an unforgettable holiday, but also made us adults fully relaxed. I recommend everyone to choose this place as a family vacation choice.

The housekeeper Xixi is very responsible! She took our luggage for us and introduced some entertainment facilities in the hotel. If there are any problems during our stay, she can also solve them for us... Thumbs up👍


Auntie Liang Xueqing of the room service is really enthusiastic! The turndown service at night is very good. Every day, small ornaments are arranged on the bed, so cute! Yogurt and snacks are also delivered at night, as well as welcome fruits, etc.! It makes people feel very warm when they return to the hotel!

This time, I also experienced the hotel's cutting-edge travel photography. I contacted the housekeeper Xixi and asked her to make an appoin**ent on my behalf. I took pictures in the afternoon and could choose the pictures in the evening. It was very efficient! The photographer who took the pictures was also very hard. He sweated with us on a hot day😄

The breakfast was not bad, with salty tofu and Shandong grain cakes, which were very delicious and I ate them for two days in a row! There are also various

I came here in 2017, and now some new entertainment facilities have been opened. In addition to peacocks, there are many more small animals. Not bad, suitable for parent-child travel!

A great experience! I chose Kaiyuan a few years ago, and I chose Kaiyuan again this time. Next time I come to Qiandao Lake, I think I will still choose Kaiyuan!

We were upgraded to a suite next to the Peacock Pavilion. We really flew to the balcony because there was no one walking around at the end of the corridor. It was very quiet. The location was also very good. We went cycling around Qiandao Lake the next day. It was very close to the cycling starting point. The lake view was perfect and you could watch the sunset. It was inconvenient for my wife to go to the breakfast room with the child. I would like to thank the guest relations director-Lele for bringing a lot of breakfast to my wife's room. It can be said that the overall communication service was very good and humanized, which exceeded our expectations. We took the baby to the Cute Pet Park. The 0-distance contact was very good. Finally, we pulled something in the room and they called to remind us. It is worth recommending. I will stay here again next time I come to Qiandao Lake.

Basically, you don’t have to go out and you can solve everything in the hotel.
The hotel staff will greet you when they meet, which makes people feel very nice. I added the housekeeper WeChat when checking in. If you need to interact with the raccoon and the rabbit, you can make an appointment with the housekeeper in advance.

You can sit on the swing in the small courtyard on the first floor and overlook Qiandao Lake. Peacocks can be seen walking in the courtyard everywhere. In particular, there is a peacock that always likes to stand on a big rock and overlook the lake, which is very interesting. The weather is cool in May. It is very happy to wake up every morning with the crisp bird calls and peacocks.
Service: The front desk was very considerate to upgrade the parent-child room in the main building for us. A large bed plus a bunk bed, the children like it very much. The little housekeeper Coco's service is very considerate, thumbs up. The buffet breakfast here is very rich, and the price of the Chinese restaurant is also very reasonable. It is very convenient to bring the elderly and children to order lunch and lunch in the restaurant. The taste is good, saving the trouble of going out to find food.
In short, I was very satisfied with this trip to Qiandao Lake, and the elderly and children are always thinking about it.

Thanks to the many service staff of Kaiyuan Resort, I spent a pleasant holiday with my children!
First of all, I would like to thank Xiaoxiao, the customer service director! Entering the hotel, you warmly welcomed me, asked about the service requirements, and provided the children with the necessary utensils. You also thoughtfully reminded us of the dining time and place every day, which made us feel your smile and warmth. Thank you for your warm service🤝.
I also want to give special praise to Xu Yuemei, the guest room, for the sanitary service, the night bed arrangement, and the welcome fruit. Especially when I saw that my hand was broken, I took the initiative to find a Band-Aid to help bandage it. Thank you again, I wish you well🤝
There is also the little beauty at the concierge desk. Your actions and smiles when you took me to find the dinner restaurant are really beautiful!
There is also the little sister who sat at the innermost of the front desk at around 15:00 on May 6. Thank you very much for your reception. It’s a pity that I didn’t remember her name. Thank you.
By the way, let’s talk about the little experience of dining. There is no doubt that the breakfast is rich. Two points that are more common in five-star hotels:
1) Fruits and children’s snacks are stronger.
2) Chicken, duck, fish and other meats are slightly inferior.

msg:The room rate during the Labor Day holiday was 1,800 yuan. The decoration was 20 years ago and the whole decoration was very shabby according to the evaluation of 1,800 yuan per night. Ctrip wrote that it was renovated in 2015. I went to the front desk and asked, but they said no, it was just opened in 2004. The decoration and facilities are only in line with the 700-800 hotel. The toilet was blocked and the faucet of the sink fell off. Is this like the standard of a 1,800 yuan/night 5-star hotel?
Every day this peacock is calling, very loudly, and it is also calling when the child is taking a nap.
The service of the waiter is very good, and the housekeeper is very considerate.
There are two small car towns in the children's park that are not very big and need to be paid by themselves. Sensen Park can be understood as the kind of amusement facilities in the park. The swimming pool has not yet opened and the indoor swimming pool is very small.
The breakfast environment is like a hotel around 700 yuan. There are many good food varieties, but the sophistication does not meet the standard of 1,800 yuan/night.

msg:Before coming here, I was struggling whether to book or not, because I thought the facilities were a bit old, but in the end I was very satisfied with the stay. The Kaiting Suite is large enough, with a balcony on the first floor, you can see the lake view, and you can see peacocks in the room. The parent-child package is great. Although it is very expensive during the May Day holiday, the service is worth it. The hotel staff is very enthusiastic. I added the housekeeper Guagua on WeChat. Guagua is always responsive and considerate. Aunt Xu Yuejuan sent bed rails and yogurt, the restaurant sent gifts for the children, and the lobby sent gifts for departure. It was a surprise. I will come again next time.

Although we couldn't leave the scenic spots, we were not bored in the hotel. The children had a great time. The weather was sunny the next day, and we played in the Cute Pet Park and the Sen Sen Sports Field. It was a very happy trip!

It was raining and I was eating takeaway in the room and got a thorn stuck. Milk Tea helped me find a solution in time. Aunt Liang from the room service saw that I had not eaten yet and brought me biscuits and yogurt. They were very nice. The children liked the car town playground and Sensen sports field very much. They were reluctant to leave after playing all day.

When checking out, the child cried and said that he didn't want to stay anywhere else but Kaiyuan Resort. The breakfast is rich. You can order dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant, and the taste is good. There is a shuttle bus from the hotel lobby to the entrance, which is available on call. I promised the child that I will stay in this hotel for two or three nights next time I come to Qiandao Lake 😂

msg:To be honest, the hotel is very old, so the service can only make do, but this kind of service is deliberate, not from the heart, just to ask you for a good review. The socket of the hotel is broken. After it was replaced, it was inconvenient to repair because it was in a meeting, so there was no more. After the repair was called, it broke again after it was repaired. Later, it was found that if the light was turned off, the corresponding circuit would not have electricity. The account manager was even more forgetful. At first, he forgot to give the afternoon tea coupon, which resulted in no afternoon tea. Of course, it would not be delicious if you look at the picture. Later, it was said that there were feed coupons to feed small animals, but later it was said that there were only table tennis coupons. I spent money to buy a car town package, but the tokens that should have been given were not given. It was the second time I saw someone take the initiative to ask for it. In addition, there are differences in price, and some platforms have lower prices. I have been to Qiandao Lake 4 times. I recommend Qiandao Lake voco hotel and InterContinental Hotel, especially voco is next to Kaiyuan. Whether it is hardware or service, it is really much better. InterContinental is even more outstanding. If you have a sufficient budget, please choose it decisively. As for Kaiyuan, I advise you to quit!

The train station bus went directly to the station in three stops. Just tell the security guard at the door and there will be a shuttle bus. It is very convenient to get in and out. There is a community opposite the hotel gate, and the restaurant opposite is delicious.

The peacock is very gracious and welcomes us with its tail. It is fun to feed the alpacas. The western restaurant is very large and has an American classical style. What I am most satisfied with is the hotel's service awareness. Not only did they upgrade our lake view room, but they also gave us a late check-out according to our needs. When we checked out, they also sent us food, snacks and water. It was thoughtful and humane. The waitress, Aunt Liang, folded a beautiful peacock when she turned down the bed, and sent fruit and yogurt. Other waiters kept saying hello when they saw it. In short, it felt like home.

msg:The sports venues and animal park in the resort are definitely the favorites of children. They come here just for these two parks. The children are reluctant to leave. Most of the guests in the hotel bring their children to play. The hotel is very suitable for bringing children to play. The park is the favorite of children. The hotel also prepares children's plates, children's dining chairs, children's slippers, children's toothbrushes, bed guards, spare diapers, disposable bath bags, and clothes drying rods. It is considered to be relatively complete and very friendly to children.
Disadvantages:
1. The railings on the balcony have safety hazards. If the child likes to climb and the parents don't watch, the child is very likely to be in danger.
2. The floor mat in the room is a bit dirty.
It is worth thanking that my mother had severe back pain those days and couldn't sleep on a too soft bed. After the hotel aunt knew about it, she specially applied to the leader to help find a wooden board and simply arranged it for my mother to sleep. Thank you so much.
The service is generally satisfactory. Most of the staff are smiling, and only a few have a stern face.

The hotel is a bit closer to Kaiyuan Senbo, and the overall service is pretty good. The restaurant's plate collection service is very fast. There is a butler Qianqian in the guest room, but he may be an intern and needs to work harder. After all, I have experienced the butler service in Fuchun Fangwai.

The location here is very good. The facilities inside and outside the hotel are very complete. I didn’t have enough fun here for two nights. The peacocks are well-fed and their feathers are very beautiful.
The car town is very cost-effective, and the staff member Xiao Fang is quite talkative. It is very suitable for preschool children to play.
Let’s talk about some shortcomings. The decoration is a bit old. I feel that the water pipes are aging. There is a bit of yellow water when I first boil the water.
Slippers are not very comfortable. If it were not for cost savings, the disposable shoes would still be more comfortable.

msg:I chose to go to Qiandao Lake for a walk during the Qingming Festival. I saw that Ctrip had an event, so I chose Qiandao Lake Kaiyuan Resort. The only drawback is that the weather during the Qingming Festival is not very good. It is basically cloudy and drizzling, so except for going out for cycling, the rest of the time was spent in the hotel. The short holiday was still very fun.

Actually, we booked a twin room on the first floor, but the lady at the front desk helped us upgrade to a semi-lake view room on the third floor. The peacock pavilion is downstairs. Although the peacock is always calling, it also has its own wildness. You can always see it spread its tail, which the children find very fun. The hotel environment is very good. The lobby is on the 5th floor, and the 2nd floor seems to be parent-child rooms. The community has its own cute pet park and non-powered park. Guests staying in the hotel can play for free. There are also clown performances and sea lion performances during the holidays. The children like it very much. There is an indoor swimming pool on the first floor and a car town indoor amusement park. The package we bought does not include the car town, so we need to buy it separately. It is 99 yuan for one adult and one child to enter and exit three times on the same day, which is quite cost-effective.

Although the room is not big and the facilities are not new, it is quite clean and tidy. There is a one-to-one housekeeper named Wenwen, who can be contacted by WeChat at any time to ask questions and needs. The girl will also carefully send us the time of various performances and activities. Liang Xueqing and Aunt Xu Liyun who clean the house are also very enthusiastic. They prepare fruits every day and keep the room very clean. In general, the service staff of the entire hotel are very enthusiastic and patient. When checking out, a bag of snacks and water for the high-speed rail was also sent.

The only drawback is that you need to queue up for the buffet breakfast, and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant at noon are not satisfactory. I think everything else is pretty good, cost-effective, and the service is very good.

First of all, it is very smooth to take a taxi after getting off the high-speed rail. There is a special online taxi pick-up point, which is very user-friendly. The driver introduced us along the way and we had a great time chatting. Delivered directly to the hotel lobby door. Check-in was very smooth. The lady at the front desk took the initiative to upgrade the room. The lady Suisui took the initiative to add WeChat to help carry the luggage, guided us all the way to the room, and even gave the children toys. I was really shocked when I opened it. Everything from the overall room environment to the details has been done to the extreme. Toiletries for adults and children, including baby shampoo and shower gel, baby cream, baby slippers and toothbrushes, are really amazing. The little white rabbit folded on the towel on the bed instantly attracted the children's attention and made them happy. We ate at the Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor in the evening. The cooking was exquisite and the fish head was very tender. 2 The baby was very happy with the baby meal. Since I went there relatively late, the next day I visited the Cute Pet Paradise to feed the small animals, the dense outdoor playground, and Fantasy Island. The two children were sweating and laughing all the way. Before I knew it, it was 12:30 noon, and I quickly went back to pack my things to catch the high-speed train. The driver was waiting patiently at the door. If it weren't for the night shift, we would still have to stay one more night today. The children were also clamoring not to leave. Before leaving, we also gave souvenirs to solve the problem of hungry children who did not have lunch. It's really great. Thank you to Miss Suisui for her enthusiastic help along the way. Thank you to all the staff of Kaiyuan and the driver master of Qiandao Lake.

msg:When traveling with children, parent-child hotels are the first choice, and Kaiyuan is the top parent-child hotel, so I chose it without hesitation! The hotel has a cute pet paradise where you can feed small animals, as well as a dense sports ground! What satisfied me the most during my stay was the room attendant: Tong Jianying, who responded quickly to our requests and had a friendly attitude - making us feel at home!

In addition, I really admire the smiles on every Kaiyuan person's face, which made me feel like I'm home. In particular, I would like to praise the little beauty Wenwen (Zhou Jingwen) for her unexpected surprise and upgrade to my room, which made our trip even better. I would like to sincerely thank you❤️ for allowing us to have a panoramic view of the beautiful scenery from the balcony as soon as we stepped out of the room.
I would also like to praise the waiter Liang Xueqing for giving me another surprise when I returned to the room at night, haha!

There are also many recreational facilities in the resort, which is very suitable for taking children to play together. You can feed small animals and slide on various slides. My son had a lot of fun.
The hotel's service is also very warm. Thank you to the milk tea lady who received us and the auntie who helped us clean the room.
The two days passed so quickly. I will come back again if I have the opportunity. It is suitable for traveling with children and it is a very good experience.

msg:I finally had the opportunity to go there in March for the package I bought on Ctrip in December. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk upgraded us to a lake view room and gave us red wine. When we checked in, the housekeeper Milk Tea took us to the room, introduced us to the hotel's facilities and opening hours, and added WeChat so we could ask her any questions. Since it happened to be my birthday, the housekeeper arranged a birthday cake, Aunt Liang specially decorated the room, and even gave me yogurt before going to bed. The main meal included in the set meal also tastes very good and is a basic disc.
On cloudy days, we basically stayed in the hotel’s cute pet paradise, forest sports ground, indoor heated swimming pool and other places.
The service attitude of all the hotel staff is superb, and the hotel thoughtfully prepared drinks and snacks before leaving. The only drawback is that the soundproofing of the room is not very good. Overall, the price/performance ratio is very high.

msg:In March, I took my whole family to find a comfortable hotel for a relaxing trip. This time I chose Qiandao Lake Kaiyuan Resort. It is indeed a family hotel. It really provides an unexpected and great travel experience, both for the old and the young. Everyone had a great time and the hotel staff were very welcoming.
Check-in: We booked a package, but the front desk upgraded our room type for free and arranged three adjacent rooms for us on the same floor, which gave us convenience. We added the butler Xixi's WeChat account when we checked in. Xixi provided us with the opening hours of the hotel facilities. She also thoughtfully led us to the door of the room and gave us a bottle of red wine in each room. We received children's toiletries for the children, and also thoughtfully put our two beds together to prevent the children from falling while sleeping.
Catering: We settled the whole process in the hotel. The breakfast was rich in variety and the children enjoyed it very much. We ordered fish head soup from a Chinese restaurant for dinner, and we could use the coupon given by the hotel to get 100 yuan off. Because we are Hui people, the restaurant service staff took special care of the kitchen to help us remove the lard, etc., and it tasted delicious. We booked a dinner buffet at a Western restaurant for dinner. It was Women's Day and we sent flowers and cakes. The waiter Li Keying thoughtfully helped us get juice and grilled lamb chops and beef ribs. He also kept asking us what we needed. Really enthusiastic.
Room: Very clean and tidy. The waiters Lin Juan and Hou Jiahui were able to help us clean the room in a timely manner, replenish toiletries and drinking water, and bring us fruits every afternoon.
Play facilities: There is a cute pet paradise, where there are ponies, rabbits, alpacas, sika deer, peacocks and small pine parrots. Children can buy feed at the door to feed the animals, or make an appoin**ent to pet the rabbits and raccoons. The waitress Ruirui brought a little white rabbit to the child. The rabbit was very clean and she touched it for a long time. The Sensen Sports Ground is more suitable for older children to play, they can climb, and younger children can dig in the sand, swing, etc. . There is also an indoor heated swimming pool.
Service: This is a service-oriented hotel. People who meet us on the road will greet us cordially and say hello. They are warm and friendly and the experience is very good.
I will come here to play again next time I have a chance!

The hotel we stayed at also provided travel photography services, but we didn’t make an appoin**ent this time due to weather and itinerary arrangements.

msg:I spent a pleasant three nights and four days at Kaiyuan Qiandao Lake Resort. When I made the initial reservation, I originally wanted to find a new hotel to stay in, but after comprehensively considering the hotel's hygiene, parent-child environment and service facilities, I finally chose Kaiyuan. As expected, I didn't let it go. We are disappointed. First of all, although the hotel facilities are relatively new, they are very hygienic and there is no dust in the corners (stomatophilia...). On the first day of check-in, the hotel also gave us welcome fruits and Wangzai milk, and arranged the beds, which was very thoughtful and considerate. Secondly, the hotel has a strong parent-child a**osphere. Because it is the Spring Festival holiday, the hotel has various Spring Festival-themed parent-child activities for children, and the children had a lot of fun. Sensen Sports Ground, Cute Pet Paradise and Car Town are a paradise for children to play, especially the Car Town, which has two floors. My daughter played in it for a long time. The Cute Pet Paradise has alpacas, raccoons, sika deer, rabbits, ponies, and small horses. Sheep, a cute kid. Finally, I would like to praise the service of the hotel. Most of the hotel staff are young people. They are all very, very nice. They are sunny and enthusiastic and work hard. At noon, the brothers and sisters in the car town also danced and interacted. The boss should add chicken legs♡ A staff member pretended to be a gift giver to deliver "lucky" boxes to the children ♡ At the same time, I would like to express my special thanks to the hotel guest manager Yangyang for his attention and help during our stay, which made our trip smooth and enjoyable. In addition, we also received a welcome gift of red wine when we checked in, and our daughter also received a gift bag of snacks from Sister Yangyang when we left. The little kid still remembered it when we returned, saying that we hope to see Sister Yangyang next time ♡ Qiandao Lake Kaiyuan It’s a worthwhile trip♡

msg:February 1st-3rd, three days and two nights. With an 8-year-old child and a 70-year-old man, we just stayed in the hotel to relax. Arrived at 2:30 pm on the first day. Check-in was quick and we got a standard room on the 5th floor. I am very satisfied with everything. I have WeChat and the butler Aya, who is kind and friendly, responds quickly to any questions, and also has small gifts for the children. We were very lucky. It rained on the first and third days, but not on the second day. The outdoor playground is closed on rainy days. We have played all the places we should play. The children had fun interacting with the animals. The hotel provides fruits every day, and the price of more than 600 for two nights including two breakfasts is really delicious. You can buy an additional ticket to enter the car town, and you can enter and exit without restriction on the day. Guests staying in other places have free entry and exit. I had fish head soup on the first night, and there was a 100 discount coupon available for my stay. The second night, Friday, I bought a buffet, which was pretty good. In the off-season, there are fewer people, it’s not noisy, and there’s no need to queue in all aspects, so it’s a great experience.

msg:I stayed in Qiandao Lake for a total of four days, Minghao International Resort Hotel for two days, and came to Kaiyuan for two days after that. Let’s talk about two shortcomings first. First, the decoration of the hotel is not as good as that of new hotels; second, the water temperature of the swimming pool is a bit cold at 24-26 degrees, and children will complain. Except for the above two points, the other experiences are very good. The housekeeper Aya greeted us at the front desk and showed us to our room, the lovely decor made us feel right at home. He patiently introduced various parent-child activities to us, asked us any questions on WeChat if we were unclear, and sent us souvenirs before leaving. In the morning, I drew a chicken balloon from the God of Wealth. I was afraid that I might not have time to get it. Aya also helped coordinate. The child was very happy to get such a big balloon in advance. I would also like to thank the waiter Liang Xueqing for greeting us kindly, delivering a fruit plate every day, and providing free tuck-in service. When I saw that there were children, I brought warm milk before going to bed. I was very grateful. Children here have given high praise to the car town and the outdoor sports ground. Haha, it is enough for us to play inside the hotel these days. The most recommended one is the cute pet paradise. We repeatedly experienced the half-hour rabbit petting activity, the feeding raccoon activity with food in the palm of our hands, the pony riding activity, etc. The most important thing is that as long as you make a reservation in advance, everything is free, even on rainy days. Rabbits are also delivered to the room. This cute pet paradise really makes children forget to leave.

Kaiyuan’s cute pets are also super cute. Feeding alpacas and sika deer carrots is very healing.
I like all the photo spots.

Will also recommend friends to stay here

The environment was elegant and comfortable, and I had a peninsula to myself, so I could walk my baby freely without leaving the hotel.
When we checked in, the housekeeper Wenwen added WeChat and gave us a detailed introduction to the hotel and activity arrangements. She upgraded us to a lake view room with a small balcony, which was very beautiful. In addition, two cups of hot milk are given every night, two plates of fruit every day, free capsule coffee and various beer drinks are really great value.

The housekeeper also helps to organize group bookings for horse walks, feeds raccoons, and can also book rabbits for room delivery service. Super awesome 👍
In addition, hotel guests can freely enter and exit the sports field, swimming pool, separate marina and kayaking activities. There is also a car park that children like. Recently, the hotel gave away 70 game coins during an event, so it’s basically free to play. Like it!

You just need to report your room number. It turned out that I didn’t record my face, but the waiter said that I recorded my face and took my socks, and it couldn’t be found. Who recorded it...it's a bit shocking! I feel like there is something wrong with this process. The animals in the cute pet park are quite docile. There is no charge to enter the park, but it costs 20 yuan to buy carrots and grass.

msg:After getting off the Qiandao Lake High-Speed ​​Railway Station, we took the No. 001 Tourist Bus to the Kaiyuan Resort Station. We told the security guard at the entrance of the resort that a shuttle bus would come out to pick us up and enter the lobby. I went there at noon on the first day of the new year and there were a lot of people. I had to wait for a while to check in and the room was not cleaned well. The suite I booked should be in the pet park on the first floor, but the waiter said that he could upgrade me to a room with a lake view. This room is on the second floor. The second floor is a parent-child room with parent-child elements. Food in the cute pet paradise is 10 yuan a piece. After I saw the cute pets and the room was ready, I added the housekeeper Aya’s WeChat account. If I need anything, just ask Aya. Kaiyuan's service is nothing to say, and it has prepared many activities including the Chinese New Year. The next day was my mother's birthday. The housekeeper Aya immediately arranged a birthday cake for my mother after knowing it. She was so attentive. Thank you very much. The children also had a great time. The stay was too short and there were many places. We didn’t get to play, but we had to go to the next attraction and had to leave in a hurry. What I want to complain about is that I didn’t see any salmon during the buffet dinner on Saturday night. When I asked, I just asked to get it. Anyway, I didn’t see any salmon from beginning to end. This is my second consecutive visit to Qiandao Lake. Next time I will invite more people to stay in the villa.

Stayed for three days and two nights, I really think the hotel environment is good! BOBO Pet Paradise and Sensen Sports Ground are very suitable for families with children! The hotel service is also good. The employees all smiled and said Happy New Year to us very kindly! In particular, the kind and warm service of our butler Aya made us feel at home!

msg:A perfect hotel experience. Our family of three checked into the hotel on New Year's Eve. The guy at the front desk upgraded our room to a room directly facing Qiandao Lake! The scenery is so beautiful! During our three-day stay at the hotel, we received enthusiastic service from Aya from the guest depar**ent, Liang Xueqing from the housekeeping depar**ent, and Master Li from the shuttle bus. The housekeeping depar**ent arranged a swan 🦢 decoration for us on New Year’s Eve, and presented us with red wine from the hotel owner’s winery, as well as very special gifts for the children. Love hot milk, fruit, chocolate and candies! After checking out, Master Li on the shuttle bus pointed us to a scenic trail along the lake to Tianyu Mountain. It was quiet and beautiful along the way. The hotel also has free-range peacocks 🦚, a beach 🏖️, an animal park, Dokdo (to watch the sunset), and Gatling fireworks in the hotel on New Year's Eve, which is full of New Year a**osphere. The hotel's breakfast and evening hot pot buffet are rich in dishes, which is great. There are so many beautiful places that I won’t go into details one by one. You will know by experiencing them👌🏻😊

Environment: Each area has its own characteristics. Everyone wants to retire here. The climate is also very comfortable.
Service: The service in a five-star hotel is excellent👍, whether it is the restaurant, guest room or entertainment management, I am very grateful to the aunt who cleans us every day. Thank you to Aunt Tong Jianying who provides us with attentive service and is responsive to our requests and decorates the room so beautifully. Thank you very much. We were greeted with enthusiastic service by the little girl who welcomed us every year, and the little girl Wu Menghan who took us to put flowers and see the little raccoons, which really made me reluctant to leave🥹
🐻BOBO Cute Pet Paradise:
Be sure to get close to the animals. There is a little raccoon named Lila Fat Tiger who is so cute. Remember to make a reservation in advance.
🏖️Sensen Sports Ground Experience:
Most of them are for children. There are many activities and they have a great time watching them. The hotel has free tickets to go in and have a look. The only regret is that archery has not been open and I have not been able to experience it.

msg:Taking children and the elderly together on vacation, I have to say that this place is really suitable for parents and children. There is a special children's dining table for breakfast, which is convenient for children to get their own food. The food is also very good. The playground and cute pet paradise are free. The swimming pool has a special children's pool. The waiter will remind the children to go to the children's pool because the temperature is higher. The waiters are very enthusiastic and always say hello when meeting. It's a good experience. The front desk helped to upgrade the room. Thank you very much. However, because I booked two rooms on two platforms, the front desk ignored that the Ctrip package comes with fish head coupons (because they will not be given after 1.31, but I took the initiative to ask for them later. Only given). The people at Aya were very enthusiastic and helped to deliver the luggage to the room. The waiter Xu Yuejuan was very enthusiastic and delivered fruits on both days. She also gave a souvenir when checking out, which was very thoughtful.

This time the front desk helped upgrade the lake view room. The guest service lady Yangyang was very enthusiastic to help us introduce the hotel, and even gave us a check-out gift after checking out. Good review!
The guest room aunts Xu Yuejuan, Liang Xueqing, and Cheng Hongjuan provided excellent service, and the turndown service was very creative.
The only drawback is that breakfast is only available for two adults per room, and there is an additional price for children!
The rest of the hotels have excellent locations and have small balconies outside the lake. The cute pet paradise downstairs gives children the opportunity to get up close and personal with small animals. This trip was a bit rushed, and I didn’t have time to experience Fantasy Island. I will definitely come back to experience it next time.

msg:This Qiandao Lake Kaiyuan can be said to be a surprise. First of all, the service staff makes people feel at home, which is very important for families with children who need a vacation.
The housekeeper who has customer relations at the front desk, Miss Aya, accompanied me throughout the entire stay and promptly responded to all needs within three days of check-in, helping with food ordering, late check-out, etc., and the wording conveyed a high-quality feeling, which made the hotel feel very comfortable. Feel at ease during your stay!
There was also Aunt Liang Xueqing (perhaps very young) who served in the room service, who helped deliver fruits and milk. She accidentally mentioned that the welcome fruit oranges were delicious and actually remembered them in her heart. She sent a few more in the evening. Although the oranges were small, they were so delicious. The awareness of being able to provide customers with services in a timely manner is simply too valuable. I am truly touched and highly praised!
There are many animals in Kaiyuan's cute pet park, haha, they all come in pairs, including raccoons, deer, alpacas, and bird parks. Although it is not big, there are several peacocks. I played with these little babies N times in three days. No matter how much money you spend in the city, it’s all free here!
 
Fantasy Island is also free, maybe because I stayed in the middle of the week. The two floors are like Nairbao, and it is also a great value. I went to the swimming pool one afternoon. There is a children's entertainment pool with a temperature of 30+. It is not cold at all. The large swimming pool is enough for adults. I had two meals at the hotel restaurant, both tasted good, and the service staff were very friendly.

There is also the Sensen Sports Ground. I was lucky enough to go there on a sunny day. It was super fun. The outdoor water village is not open in winter. I can’t imagine how fun it is in summer! This trip to Qiandao Lake for three days and two nights was fulfilling and comfortable, and the children also enjoyed themselves very much. Thanks to the little brother from Fantasy Island for the peacock feathers, we returned home with a full load! Ha ha

The hotel has many projects, and the rain will not delay the fun. The most important thing is that the hotel staff are really enthusiastic and considerate to the point of impeccable. Our housekeeper Xixi and the front desk were so attentive and thoughtful that I was moved to tears. Knowing that I brought my parents here, my parents were reluctant to spend money on me, so I just wanted the worst room, and they kept asking if I could get a better deal. Xixi and the front desk went to various platforms to find coupons for me, and upgraded and upgraded for free. Both parents were delighted. There are delicious food all around, but for the price of cabbage, you can eat a table full of delicacies in the world. There was also the waiter aunt Liang Xueqing, who carefully arranged the bed for us and gave us fruits. She also helped us use disposable bathtub covers to take a bath at night. She also gave us hot milk before going to bed to help us sleep peacefully. My 70-year-old mother said that it had been a long time since she lay down and slept like this until dawn. Before leaving, Xixi also prepared two bags of fruit drinks and snacks for us, saying that we were traveling by car and could use them while driving on the road! Too distracted. Thank you Kaiyuan Resort! We will be back again!

msg:For a trip to Qiandao Lake in the off-season, I chose Kaiyuan Resort and it was really a worthwhile trip. Every detail is done exceptionally well. As a northerner marvel at the service in the south. From the housekeeper, to the front desk, and even every aunt who serves, everyone feels at home. Whether it’s bedding arrangements or milk before bed, small gifts. Whether it is a welcome gift or a leaving souvenir, every detail is filled with warmth. You can have breakfast by the window and watch the lake view, which is very comfortable. This is what a holiday should be like. Children are reluctant to leave. The cute pet paradise, dense playground, and car town are definitely enough for children to play for a whole day. The service was even better with fewer people. The children even fed raccoons up close and got to know a lot of vegetables. Recommended to friends, I just left and looked forward to my next stay. I sincerely thank every staff member of the hotel, including the service aunt Liang Xueqing, Tong Jianying and the housekeeper Yangyang.

msg:It was a very happy experience for three days and two nights. The two-night package with meals was a great value, and there was no increase in price on weekends. The whole family felt that the resort a**osphere was full.
From the moment I checked in, I felt that Kaiyuan was worthy of being an established five-star brand. The service was very good. When I checked in, I was informed that I would be upgraded to a deluxe lake view room. The room on the second floor could see the Happy Water Village downstairs and a little lake view. If the floor was higher, It will definitely look better. The foreigner had a sweet voice and sent us to the room. He sent us the detailed time of all activity areas on WeChat, and then added me to the group, which made it easier to book cute pet activities in the next two days.
The two eldest ladies in the guest room, Tong Jianying and Mao Meiyun, responded to every request. They replenished mineral water, children's dental equipment and other supplies during the trip, delivered them to the room in time, and prepared milk, fruits, turndown and other services.
The masters on the shuttle bus also responded very promptly. When leaving, Master Li also recommended that we come again in the summer to experience the different Qiandao Lake.
Although the facilities are old, they are well maintained. The 6-year-old had a great time in the Cute Pet Paradise, Sensen Sports Ground, and Car Town. He didn’t leave the hotel at all on Saturday. In the evening, he even watched a beautiful sunset and participated in a bonfire party. The a**osphere was very lively and really enjoyable. A rare experience.
The dinner was not as good as expected, just average. The buffet breakfast is very rich, with both Chinese and Western options to meet all needs.
The location of the hotel is really amazing. I went to the beach in the early morning and dusk. Both colors are beautiful. It’s easy to walk a baby and not tiring for an adult.

The room facilities pay great attention to details. The trash cans are classified. The rooms are cleaned and organized every day. Fruits are also given, and four bottles of water are given every day.
Children love the Cute Pet Paradise and Car Town so much that they have to check in every day. The Sensen Sports Ground is suitable for older children, but it is also great to play in the sand pool when the weather is warm.
Watching the beautiful sunset from the room is absolutely stunning!

I like to walk when traveling. I don’t take cars for short distances, and I don’t take cars when I’m not tired. My legs keep moving, my hands press the shutter at the right time, my eyes, hands and feet work together to “fight”, and my mind is still spinning!

I walked along the Qiandao Lake Trail and saw an island in the lake. I slipped in along the curve and the doorman smiled at me and said, "Hi!" I came to live in the "village"!

There is a shuttle bus from the door to the lobby. It is difficult for strangers to "touch" the reception lobby. When I walked into the "village", I was impressed by the roads, trees and clean air.

This is a mountain, and the "village" is designed and built close to the mountains and rivers. There are hundreds of villas and a hotel, all arranged in an orderly manner, from high to low, all the way to the shore of the lake. They follow the trend and truly "let nature take its course."

After two hours of wandering around, a set of photos clicked. When I arrived at the hotel entrance, a huge stone said "Oriental Hawaii". I was convinced. Indeed, this place looks like a miniature version of China's Hawaii.

As a tourist, the photos and text are the right to commemorate my visit here. If someone asks me in the future: "Have you been to Hawaii?" Answer: "Been there, Oriental Hawaii"!

msg:The first time I brought my children here, I felt like I was in Sanya.
As soon as we got off the bus after a four-hour drive, the children were very happy to see free-range peacocks at the door that seemed to welcome us. The housekeeper Yangyang greeted us warmly when we entered the door, interacted with the children very kindly, and was very considerate during check-in. He helped us upgrade to a car parent-child room. Since the upgraded room had not been cleaned yet, Yangyang gave us pet snacks from the cute pet paradise. . Then I took the children to feed the animals, and soon received a check-in call. Yangyang helped us carry our luggage to the room. He also introduced us to encounter peacocks walking in the courtyard every day, and specially brought us two bags of corn kernels to feed the little peacocks.
The children were super satisfied with the room. The courtyard parent-child room is a paradise, especially for boys who like cars. I stayed for two nights and could see peacocks walking in the courtyard of the room at 8 or 9 o'clock every day, as well as birds. Stopping, the ecological environment is very good, and Qiandao Lake can also be seen in the yard.
The staff in the restaurant are also very enthusiastic and will say hello to the children when they see them. The breakfast is also good. You can have breakfast while looking at the lake view.
During the stay, there are welcome fruit snacks every afternoon, Wangzai milk is available in the room, and hot milk is available around 8 o'clock every day. The room service sister Jiahui is also very warm and polite.
Needless to say, there is no need to mention the car town. During the off-season, the lady at the front desk gave me tickets. I played there every day and didn’t want to go back. It was heaven for the little boy. There is also an outdoor unpowered playground, which children also like very much. In the summer, there is also a water park to play in. It feels like arriving in Sanya, but the service here is better than that in Sanya. I am very satisfied.
After staying for two nights, I was very reluctant to leave. I will come back with my family next time!

When we checked in, the butler Yangyang added WeChat and gave detailed information on various excursions and hotel guides. He also gave us a bunch of baby snacks, toys, hairpins and animal feeding coupons, and recommended us to participate in various sheep gathering activities in the hotel. , we went to hold the baby raccoon and the newborn rabbit that day. The staff in each position were very enthusiastic! ! Hahaha😄, the main meal provided in the event is also good, including beef, shrimp, vegetables and soup. Let’s see if the price of the dishes can be worth 200 yuan. Plus, with the car town and other bonus coupons and game currency, I feel like this room It’s almost like living in vain! Let’s just say it’s not too far off. It’s a pity that I didn’t bring my baby’s swimming equipment this time. I’ll have to come back next time! By the way, the hotel’s travel photography is a cutting-edge photography, and the photographer Hao is really awesome🉑️! ! ! As someone who often stays in hotels for travel photography, this photographer is unequivocal. He is super funny, super patient, super good at coaxing babies, and provides super emotional value when taking photos! This is really important. Everyone took the photos happily while having fun. The makeup artist is also very good, it’s really a great experience!

msg:I stayed there many years ago. At that time, it felt like an old five-star hotel, very regular but very old. This time I saw that the hotel opened Senbo Paradise. The price was very affordable in the off-season, so I brought my baby to stay there again.
The overall feeling is much better than before. First of all, in terms of service, it was already midnight when we arrived. The front desk was very professional. The butler Yangyang gave the children souvenirs and sent them to the room to explain the facilities and activities. The next two days were very professional and considerate. The room aunt is also very good and the service is considerate. During the whole process, small gifts were given three, four, five or six times, including fruits and milk at night, and the bed was set up differently every day.
I booked a basic room type but still got a lake view room with a good view. Although the hotel is a bit old, it is really clean. There are no dead spots in the room, and even under the bed is clean. It can be seen that the hotel has been taken care of very seriously. If there is any dissatisfaction, it is that the corridor has a slight sewer smell at night.
I am also very satisfied with the recreational facilities, including the outdoor slide, sand digging playground, cute pet paradise, and indoor car town. The package package for hotel guests is almost free. The baby played back and forth several times.
The breakfast is also pretty good, everything you need is available, and the replenishment is quick and orderly during peak hours.
All in all, I felt the efforts and sincerity of transforming into a family hotel, and it was a very satisfying trip.

The room service aunt Liang Xueqing was very considerate and waited for us to bring hot milk every day after we returned to the room.

Although the buffet breakfast does not have the most variety, the environment is great and you can see the lake view.
Xixi, the hotel's little housekeeper, took us into the room as soon as we checked in and helped us carry our luggage. We could contact her if we had any questions. She was very considerate!

Kaiyuan Resort is a long-established hotel here in Qiandao Lake. Although it is old, the service is very good. We have been playing in the hotel. We originally wanted to go hiking, because the children loved playing in the Sensen Sports Ground so much that we didn't go.
The hotel housekeeper is considerate and caring, and Miss Yangyang is very gentle and has a nice voice. After checking out, I was given a souvenir. Next time I go to Qiandao Lake in the summer, I want to play water sports.

For more than a day, the children visited the cute pet paradise, Sensen Sports Stadium and Car Town. The children were crazy about it. The lake view is beautiful and adults can relax while strolling around. In addition, thanks to the reminder from Su Su, the guest relations director, I learned that the road outside the bicycle race was closed, so I changed the itinerary in time without any impact. The children's bicycles brought at home also came in handy. It was super enjoyable to take the kids on a ride around the resort.

msg:On November 14, 2023, I took my 88-year-old father to Qiandao Lake for vacation and stayed at Kaiyuan Resort. When I entered the lobby to check in at around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the waiter had already upgraded my room. Seeing that my father was old, the lobby manager quickly asked the waiter to help me get another room. I was upgraded to another deluxe lake view room. After asking, I found out that most rooms in the hotel have to step into the bathtub to shower. For the safety of the elderly, they changed me to a pure shower room (without a bathtub). This upgrade changed rooms. It reflects the meticulous and thoughtful work of the lobby manager Fang Jing. In addition, he also gave us afternoon tea during the waiting time for us to take a break and taste it. The manager also specifically told me that if I can’t finish the fish head soup for two people when dining on the third floor of the hotel, I can ask for it. The restaurant will save it for the next meal... From these two things, we can see the service quality of the lobby manager. He is full of sincerity and considers the guests in every detail, making the guests sincerely feel grateful from the beginning of their stay. I found out that the name of the deputy lobby manager is Fang Jian. I would like to express my special thanks again to the manager of Qiandao Lake Kaiyuan Resort Fang Jian on Ctrip... The room attendant Tong Jianying put cute little decorations on the bed when I checked in, and always left yogurt and snacks in the evening. I left a warm little note and the service was very warm and thoughtful... In short, everywhere I walked in the resort, the staff and waiters greeted me with smiles and warm greetings. The housekeeper Su Su was also dedicated to her responsibilities. In just three days, I felt at home. It's very warm and happy. Such excellent service demonstrates the high quality of Kaiyuan Resort. In addition to thanking you, I must like and share it so that more guests can experience it...👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

The Chinese restaurant experience was okay, elegant and refined. There are also yacht kayaks available, but they are a bit too expensive, haha.

msg:Kaiyuan Hotel has always been popular with its excellent value for money and is especially suitable for parent-child travel.
After visiting Kaiyuan Jiulong Lake in Ningbo, I specially visited Qiandao Lake Kaiyuan Resort in autumn.
I booked a twin room with lake view for two nights. Is it more suitable to have a twin or twin bed with a baby?
I deliberately chose Sunday to Tuesday so that I can take advantage of a day off without catching up with the increased prices and extra people on Friday and Saturday.
It is stipulated to check in at three o'clock. Because I arrived at 2:30 on the Sunday, I could already check in directly. I talked to the front desk and asked them to help put beds together. Seeing that we had a baby, they also upgraded the room type very considerately. Basically, there are many off-season rooms in the Kaiyuan series. This is a great upgrade.
When I checked in, the front desk gave me a feeding ticket for the cute pet paradise. I also added a WeChat message from the cute and beautiful housekeeper Yiyi. The whole service was great! Full five points! First, I gave a small check-in gift, a little frog, a bubble camera and a hawthorn roll. The baby was so happy that he showed off his bubble machine all the way.
Go to the hotel and put your luggage and go straight to the cute pet park. The feeding coupons given include a bag of fodder and a few carrots. There are alpacas, deer, pony, lambs, squirrels, raccoons, birds, peacocks, etc. You can experience the feeding experience of the zoo without leaving the hotel. I also brought a pack of carrots which was very popular
Feed the animals. There is a large outdoor playground next to the lake. It can fulfill the wishes of children to play and parents to watch the sunset on the swings. Hahahaha.
Why go to Lantau Island? The sunset at the hotel is beautiful.
When I returned to the hotel in the evening, I found that the room had been tidied up and arranged, and fruit was given as a check-in gift. I saw that we drank two bottles of mineral water and refilled two bottles (four bottles of mineral water were given for each room we checked in). In the evening, my aunt came to give us yogurt.
The next day it was my baby’s birthday, and the hotel gave me a big cake. I also helped decorate the room. My baby was so happy. It’s a must-choice hotel for families with children!
Thanks to the housekeeper Yiyi! They reminded me every day of all the hotel details. When I learned that my daughter had a birthday, she even arranged a cake and decorations, which made her have an unforgettable birthday (she said this hotel is great! She wants to stay in the hotel for a year, haha, this is amazing) Can not afford)
Thanks to Liang Xueqing, Ye Jianhong and Aunt Xu Yuejuan who decorated the room
It feels like there are little surprises every day when you stay at the hotel!
At the end of the check-out, the front desk asked about how it felt to stay and gave them a check-out gift. It was a perfect ending.
The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic. They always say hello and provide hotel tips along the way. The Kaiyuan style of humanities is really great! Next time, continue to check in the Kaiyuan system!

msg:After National Day, it’s really fun to travel during off-peak hours. The destination was Qiandao Lake. Because I was traveling with a 7-month-old baby, I had to choose the hotel carefully and chose Kaiyuan Resort. I have experienced hotels under Kaiyuan in other places before, and the experience was very good, so I came to try the best resort hotel in Qiandao Lake.
From the time I arrived at the hotel to the time I left the hotel, I couldn't fault the overall service. They asked me if they had any suggestions, but I couldn't think of any. After checking in, a special guide (Yiyi) will lead you to the room. There is no need to collapse to find a room or an elevator. If you have any questions, you can also communicate with Yiyi via WeChat. Of course, everything goes smoothly for us. We booked a twin bed and a crib. Aunt Chen was very efficient and helped us put the beds together to make a super big bed! Very suitable for our needs.
Let’s talk about what to do in the hotel: BOBO Pet Paradise, this is the largest zoo in a hotel I have stayed in so far. There are many kinds, and they are relatively rare, such as ponies, dwarf goats, guinea pigs, rutin chickens, etc. The Sensen Sports Ground experience is very suitable for children over 3 years old and feels like they can play for a whole day. But my baby was still too young, so I simply took a ride. Car Town is a better indoor choice. It is equivalent to a playground. You can drive cars, slide, and play various roles. It is very interesting and rich. There is no experience in traveling photography.
Overall, it's really good. I like the service attitude in the hotel. All the staff are enthusiastic to help, smile and welcome, and they will say hello when meeting. It's very good. I will choose Kaiyuan Resort next time I come to Qiandao Lake.

First of all, every service staff will say hello to you. Although five-star hotels can basically do this, Kaiyuan adds the body language of waving in addition to greetings.

I also discovered a small detail. If you ask for directions, most of the staff will personally take you for a while and point you in a clearer direction. This is very detailed.

A small touch brought by a small accident. When I went to the front desk to ask if there was an infirmary, the child fell and the guy at the front desk was very worried and anxious (I felt his empathy). The manager helped us get iodophor cotton swabs and band-aids, and even went to the room to give them in person. The child was medicated.

BOBO Pet Paradise: A small zoo where feeding animals is very therapeutic.
Sensen Sports Stadium Experience: A great place to discharge your energy.

Kaiyuan has its own pier. Although the cost is not cheap, it is very convenient. We can directly board the boat and go to the central lake area.

The breakfast is also very delicious and has a relatively complete range.

It's just that the typhoon is approaching and the weather has turned cooler these days. The water temperature in the water village and the indoor and outdoor swimming pools are too cold. Before leaving, I gave him a soda and snacks as a souvenir. Although the hotel occupancy rate has been quite high in the middle of the week, it is generally recommended for family travel.

msg:I booked a three-day and two-night stay in advance. Except for the older facilities, the hotel is very good. For family fun, staying in the hotel is enough. The butler Yangyang is very nice and responsive, and the replies are very positive. I will consider it next time when I travel. The service is good and everything is great. Very welcoming. The shuttle bus to the hotel is also very convenient. There is still a long way to go, or it is very convenient to drive by yourself and take a taxi.

msg:I had a very pleasant three days and two nights at Kaiyuan Qiandao Lake Resort. First of all, let me talk about the hotel environment. It can be described as excellent. Overlooking the entire Qiandao Lake, the sunset is superb. Although the hotel opened early and the hardware facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained and cleaned very well. The service of the cleaning staff is also very good. Welcome fruits are delivered every day, which are fresh and delicious. The hotel breakfast is rich. The children had great fun in the swimming pool, playground and petting paradise. Finally, I would like to give special praise to "Housekeeper Yiyi". From check-in to check-out, he gave us meticulous care and greetings, and his service attitude was superb. We also gave coupons for Chongmeng Garden feed to the children. We will greet you every day if you have any needs, communicate and resolve them in a timely manner. I look forward to staying at Qiandao Lake next time. It’s a great family hotel👍

I stayed at Qiandao Lake Kaiyuan Resort and opened the door to see the unobstructed view of Qiandao Lake. The lake scenery comes into view. The comfort of the lake view suite is beyond compare, and the service is also very good. Special praise should be given to the concierge girl Su Su, who took us into the room, turned on the air conditioner for us, and told us where to eat and when. , because the restaurants for breakfast and dinner are not in the same place, she also specially introduced us to different places and took different elevators. One thing in particular, she was also very attentive and told me where to take good photos. In short, she was very considerate. So my stay this time was very good and I was very satisfied.

First of all, let me talk about the service attitude, it is very good! Every waiter will take the initiative to say hello to you when they see you, which feels very good. I would like to especially praise the customer relations director Yiyi who served my room and the building management aunt. They solved all problems for you in time and thoughtfully gave you yogurt and fruits. , and there is also a depar**ent manager who also handles the matter very properly. Secondly, I want to talk about their catering here. The breakfast and dinner buffets are very rich, and I am very happy to eat! The hotel is located in the center of the lake. It is very beautiful. There are beautiful views everywhere. There are also many places for children to play. It is especially recommended for those with children. There are peacocks roaming everywhere in the garden. In fact, there are quite a lot of Southeast Asia here. It has a resort style. There are two swimming pools here if you want to swim. Take your pick. I will recommend other friends to stay here next time. It’s very good!

msg:I have always believed in the quality of Kaiyuan. Basically, you can eat, drink, have fun, and walk your baby all in one place. We booked 2 twin rooms with lake view. Our room had a bit of a smell like the cabinets had been sitting for a long time. I saw that there are drying racks on the walls of the first and second floors. You can hang clothes outside. We are on the 5th floor. There are no clothes drying racks outside. I feel a little regretful. The weather was also bad and there was no place to hang the laundry. They are all hung on the toilet and bathroom curtain rods and they don't dry. 😂Also, it was rainy these two days. It stopped after 9 o'clock. We finished breakfast, packed our bags and checked out of the room. Because Kaiyuan's entertainment projects only require check-in to check-out before 12 o'clock the next day. They are all freely accessible. Thinking that it would stop raining, I planned to go to the Sensen Sports Stadium, which I didn't go to yesterday. Our family of three went in first. The staff at the door asked us to write down our room number and other information before entering. Then my parents came over. A new staff member was hired. I insisted on asking my parents to show their room card. My parents said that the room card was returned, how can I show it? Isn't it enough to just fill in the room number and other information? It was half past ten. The staff refused to let me in. Our family of three is already inside. I went to the door to explain, and it took me a long time to let him in. Think about it, two old men in their 60s would not be able to play if they came in. My husband hit his head on a building as he walked past. Knocked on a bag. The staff said it was to prevent locals from coming in. Really a little angry. . The children in the water village outside were having fun when suddenly there was thunder. The children all came up. My child's shoes were worn by another child in the wrong shoes, and the colors of the shoes were very similar. There were two young staff members who enthusiastically used a loudspeaker to help us ask tourists to find shoes. Quickly replaced with my child's own shoes. Very heartwarming. The service attitude is very good. Kaiyuan's breakfast is also great. . Great variety. tasty.

We checked in late, and met the enthusiastic housekeeper Yangyang who helped us arrange check-in and delivered it to the room. We received a fruit snack plate from the hotel. The children were very excited about the small tent that night.
When I woke up the next day, I found that the room had its own small yard, and there were little peacocks walking outside the fence. The children were very happy. The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool, a sports field and a car town. The children refused to leave even after playing.
The room type is a bit old, but the parent-child room has been renovated well 👍 The hotel service is very good. Staff who pass by will greet each other warmly. Especially the housekeeper Yangyang will remind us of hotel activities on WeChat every day. If you have any questions, you can contact us on WeChat to solve the problem. It is very considerate. I also gave a small snack after check-out. I will stay here again next time.

What is even more surprising is the forest playground , adults can really lie under the big tree in a daze, children can play freely in it, get in touch with nature, and look at the lake view in the distance is also very relaxing.
The whole service is good, from check-in to check-out, and a gift pack of snacks. Thanks to the butler Qianqian for following up.

Since it hadn’t been cleaned yet, they thoughtfully stored our luggage so we could go have dinner first. The room was already cleaned when we came back! The housekeeper, Aya, took us to the room and carefully explained to us the hotel's facilities, areas where children play, restaurants, etc., patient and friendly, and the service attitude is 100%! During the two nights of stay, I received a fruit platter, as well as a welcome ceremony carefully prepared by the room service staff Liang Xueqing, and a small toy yoghurt for the children. The children kept telling me that this hotel is really great! Will definitely come again! Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, the service is really good. Aunt Liang Xueqing is responsive and responsive. There are many small details in the room that are very considerate. Aya even prepared a small gift for me when I checked out. Thank you so much! I didn’t go out much to play in the past two days because of the rain. I basically stayed in the hotel, but the hotel’s facilities were really enough for the children to have fun for two days!

msg:🌸The trip to Qiandao Lake booked a few months ago finally came true. What I expected was the charming scenery of Qiandao Lake, but what was unexpected was the attentive service of Kaiyuan Resort.

🌸We booked a parent-child room, but not only is the room decorated in a childlike style, starting from the walkway entering that floor, there are all kinds of children's facilities and beautiful wallpapers. The children's bed in the room is a sports car, and there are also children's dreams. There are tents and rocking horses, each children's towel has the hotel mascot embroidered on it, there is a little white rabbit on the bed that the waiter specially folded with a towel, and there is a whole plate of snacks and fruits in the tea area... This kind of configuration is the best I have ever stayed in. It’s really top-notch among family hotels!

🍀Facilities suitable for children here include a cute pet paradise, car town (indoor playground) and forest sports ground (outdoor). Although due to time constraints, we only went to the Cute Pet Paradise and Car Town, the children were completely fascinated.

The places are unimaginably big. The Auto Town has two floors and almost covers the infrastructure of most similar parks. The staff provided non-slip socks for every child and adult, and the safety awareness was very good.

We spent the entire morning of Sunday in the cute pet paradise. My concept is nothing more than penning some small animals for the children to feed. However, the alpacas and sika deer here are free-range, so you can get up close and personal, which is really surprising. And the staff are constantly cleaning up the feces to ensure hygiene as much as possible. The place here is really big and there are so many animals, including ponies, sika deer, alpacas, raccoons, goats, rabbits, reed chickens, hamsters, squirrels, peacocks, budgies... After the children have fed five packs of feed, they have to catch up. When the train arrived, I reluctantly left. Next time you have a chance, you must go to the swimming pool and forest sports ground.

🌸I have also seen many hotels provide small gifts and butler services, but this time I really took the gift lightly. On the first night, the cleaner Xu Yuejuan brought a bear doll and yogurt. She also asked with concern if she liked the layout of the room. The next day, the housekeeper Yiyi made a special trip to bring a lamb doll and a car. My sister who was traveling with us got it. It was a lamb doll and a beautiful hair rope; when I checked out at the end, I also gave snacks, soda and mineral water, etc., which was really thoughtful.

We stayed for two nights and had a large welcome fruit and snack every night. This was the first time that it was fed to my heart. The enthusiastic housekeeper Yiyi sends greetings on WeChat every day and reminds us to have breakfast; she also answers any questions we have as soon as possible. This feeling of being noticed is really good, and this is the feeling of being at home.

🌸Finally, I remembered that the next morning, we encountered many peacocks in the yard. The child remembered what he learned in the last study class: peacocks are a typical sexual dimorphism😄. He has set this place as the standard for his next trip. In his words, "five-star peanut reviews😝." In this late summer and early autumn, enjoy a trip with a good mood!

The environment was pleasant, the air was fresh, and the interior of the hotel was gorgeous and clean. There were welcome fruits and small gifts from the housekeeper to greet the little ones every day. We went downstairs. There are various playgrounds and swimming pools for children to play. Parents can go upstairs to rest immediately when they are tired. Very satisfied! On this trip, I would especially like to thank the butler Zhouzhou for his all-round considerate service! Real-time greetings via WeChat, and it seemed like there were no requirements that were not met (*≧▽≦) Not long after leaving the hotel, I was reminded by phone to leave my things behind, and was given a small check-out gift package! By the way, there are peacocks coming to greet you outside the terrace every morning!

From check-in to check-out, the front desk, dedicated butler, and room cleaning are all warm and friendly. The front desk helped us upgrade to a deluxe lake view room. The dedicated butler Dandan would thoughtfully remind us about breakfast and the time process of each project. He answered all questions and had a very good attitude. The housekeeping was also very diligent and tidied up several times every time he entered the room. It's all neat and tidy. The hotel also provides fruits and afternoon tea, and the facilities are complete. There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools of different depths according to different age groups. However, children are afraid of water, otherwise they would definitely have a great time. The two-story children's playground is also great. Adults can play with their mobile phones and read books for a while... The overall feeling is very good.

However, the hotel's facilities are really a bit old, because when they are old, the hygienic condition will be a little unsatisfactory. I suggest that the boss of Kaiyuan can update the hardware and the user experience will be improved. Straight up.

5 points are given to the attitude of the service staff. Everyone in the hotel's service staff is very enthusiastic and patient, making people feel at home and leaving a good impression on people. Here, we named and praised the glutinous rice balls in the room service depar**ent. Lelia kept asking if we were satisfied with our stay.

The hotel's amusement facilities are quite good. Children in the swimming pool had a lot of fun. The hotel's car town is also very fun. However, the price is a bit expensive and there are no discounts for guests. There is nothing you can do if your children like to play. Overall, it is quite good. relaxed.

msg:I don’t know what language to use to praise the New Century Resort Hotel. The three of us traveled from the Al**an Hotel in Shanghai and came to Qiandao Lake with great expectations for the first time. First of all, let me tell you that we booked Greentown Blue Bay Resort Hotel from Ctrip. We booked lake view rooms on the fourth to eighth floors. As a result, the three of us arrived at the hotel exhausted in the evening. The child still had a stomachache. Come to the eighteenth floor! ! I just said how angry I was. When I went upstairs, I saw that there were no customers living in the corridor. The big windows in the corridor were open and there were no guardrails. After negotiating for a long time, I said that there was no room. I paid the room fee two days in advance. Why didn’t I How about a room? ! In the end, I retreated decisively and took a taxi to the Kaiyuan Resort Hotel. As soon as I entered the door, I was impressed by the security guard at the door, the welcome staff, and every staff member in the hall. I am touched. Every staff member is gentle and kind, and answers every question. The most important thing is that they are very polite and will greet each other with a smile. Really, the service attitude of the Ultraman Hotel at 3,000 Nights is not as good as this one. Thanks to the butler Dandan, the thin little man had to help us carry our luggage and send it all the way to the room. He didn't forget to greet and send welcome fruit at night. On the day before leaving, I was afraid that the flight would not be able to take us off, so I sent a souvenir the night before. After staying for two nights, fruit is delivered every day. The aunts in the guest room are very polite and responsive 24 hours a day. When I went out for a swim and came back, Aunt Liang was preparing a special surprise for us. The little towel came alive, and the child was very happy to like the little rabbit. I was really touched. Before leaving, Aunt Liang specially chose a car for my son as a gift 🎁. It’s true that no hotel has been so thoughtful when traveling abroad for so many years. Once again, I would like to thank all the staff of New Century Hotel, especially the butler Dandan and Aunt Liang, who made this trip to Qiandao Lake deeply engraved in our hearts. I wish the business of New Century Resort Hotel is booming, and all employees' wishes come true.
        Finally, let me talk about the location of Kaiyuan Hotel. Get off at the high-speed rail station and the last bus hotel shuttle bus is at 7:00 pm. Get off at the Sunshine Hotel and opposite to the security booth. You can get to the hotel by calling the shuttle bus. For the return trip, you can buy tickets from the hotel or scan the QR code on the WeChat applet to book tickets. There is a hotel shuttle bus, and you can choose the number of people at the time. You can also get on the bus from the Sunshine Hotel. A warm reminder that this bus needs to be refunded after the ticket is booked. It's expensive, so think about it before you decide. The price of taking a high-speed train to Qiandao Lake New Century Hotel is around 80. The shuttle bus of Kaiyuan Hotel is very convenient. You can rent a car and ride on the road during the day. It is very close to the Tianwu Observation Deck and not far away. There are supermarkets and a nice restaurant near Sunshine Hotel. The shuttle bus of Kaiyuan Resort Hotel is from 7:00 am to 11:00 pm. When booking a room, be optimistic about the items included. It is best to choose the car town, Sensen Stadium, etc. that need to be paid separately. The only thing is that it is not reasonable to stay in a hotel. I would also like to praise the buffet breakfast at Kaiyuan Hotel, which is very good, and the dishes at Ningxiangyuan are also delicious. Come to Qiandao Lake to stay at New Century Resort Hotel. Qiandao Lake is a quiet and beautiful lake island, where you can watch the morning rise and sunset quietly, and the most beautiful scenery of the five lakes and mountains in the world is the heart ❤️

When I got to the room, I found that the clothes hanging outside were brought in. There is really a snail girl. Thank you to our housekeeper for making trouble. On the second night, she changed us to a room with a better view. She thought about it, but she took it to heart. The opportunity will come again. The kid said that it must be a five-star praise.

Unexpectedly, the children are quite interested in animal feeding, even though the hotel is The hardware facilities are old. The software service bar is better than the staff. The check-out speed is very fast and the food is delivered.
The disadvantage is definitely the problem of the bathroom. I also investigated the small paper and asked the front desk. I personally said that the most affected thing is that the hotel’s air conditioner is a bit noisy. I woke up in the early morning and adjusted it twice. The result is that our room is higher than 24.5 The air conditioner is 25 degrees and it is a bit hot to sleep. Fortunately, I found a balance point.
Generally speaking, the hotel is not bad, but it’s a pity that we couldn’t buy the hotel’s package due to the time constraints of the family. Otherwise, it would be much cheaper. When we checked-in, the front desk changed us to the main building, which was more convenient. The original auxiliary building was managed by the owner of the villa next door.

It is the kind of hotel that really cares about the quality of the guests' stay. For example, considering that you can play with water, there are a lot of clothes, clothes rails, and children's footstools. The food is also very delicious, and the entertainment facilities are not to mention. The scenery is so good that I haven’t left the hotel for three days. It’s absolutely great to take the elderly and children on vacation! Thank you Dandan for your considerate service.

The first thing I liked was the one-stop baby walk, Fantasy Island Auto Town, Happy Water Village, Sensen Sports Ground, Cute Pet Paradise, Each item is an item that children will linger on, and the second is to see that there are family suites. It is no problem to live in a four-year-old and a small child, and immediately set a three-day and two-night itinerary. I was looking forward to this short trip all the way. After arriving at the hotel on Sunday afternoon, I really experienced the service of the old star hotel. Our guest room manager, Ms. Zhou Zhou, is really caring, from food, accommodation and transportation to preventing emergencies All kinds of small reminders really made us feel at ease that we were taken special care of, and Ms. Jiang Hongying who brought us fruit and snacks every day was also very nice. Almost every day, the child will have a small gift, which makes him very happy, not to mention the fun items. He is still unwilling to leave after checking out on the last day.

The receptionist at the front desk was very enthusiastic, and he explained all the precautions and important information. After learning about the child's birthday, he took a gift and gave it to him. The housekeeper Sui Sui was also very responsible, helping to carry the luggage, and sending the important information dictated during check-in through wx Come, when the weather changes, a message will be sent to remind you to pay attention to safety.
This time we upgraded the room for free, we can see the lake view, and we can see the Starbucks opposite haha. The room was decorated by Aunt Tong, who also brought the children's bathrobes. In addition, in the evening, they arranged the children's birthday setting and gave them toys. It was really thoughtful and completely parent-child friendly. The room provides children's slippers, children's toothbrushes, which is great.
The hotel buffet dinner has rich dishes, and there is also a children's area, the setting is very thoughtful. Closing service was timely.
The buffet breakfast is the same, with rich dishes.
The resort has a water park, a parent-child swimming pool, and an outdoor area for children to play and feed pets. Children really have fun, and there are free-range peacocks in the garden... There are also indoor play areas and indoor swimming pools

It has 2 rooms together, and there is a large hall, which is convenient for friends to drink tea and chat. Since the room was still being cleaned when we checked in, we gave free afternoon tea. During the stay, the butler Mumu has been serving personally and introduced the environment of the hotel. If you have any questions, you can contact them at any time to solve them. Customer service Xiaoyuan also gave us a little surprise. There are fruits and snacks during your stay, and a small gift when you leave. The environment of the hotel is great, suitable for taking pictures. Since the self-travel has been arranged, it is a pity that I gave up the travel photography.

Although there is no car pick-up like Hainan, but fortunately, the road is pretty good, and the high-speed rail station takes less than half an hour to reach the hotel. The hotel is on the mountain, and it is a bit far to drive in, but when we arrive, it suddenly becomes clear, and the scenery below is unobstructed. Although the zoo is small, children can play for an hour or two~Sensen Sports Ground is also very fun; the yacht is also very good, the hotel's own yacht saves a lot of trouble; the island is not as commercialized as imagined by so many people, Walking is not tiring. When you check in, a butler will stand at the front desk, and then take you to the room, and introduce how to play in the hotel~ My butler, Youyou, has a very good service. Although there is not much communication in the middle, I will actively help store the things after checking out , and gave the children a small gift,

Kaiyuan's service is very good! All the staff take the initiative to greet the guests every time they meet🙋
When we checked in, the glutinous rice ball butler served us very considerately, helped us with our luggage 🧳 took us to the room, added WeChat, and could help solve any problems in time! The service is very considerate 👍🏻 let us live very comfortably!
On the last night, the aunt who cleaned the room 🧍♀️ also gave us a small toy, super considerate! really thankful!
Kaiyuan Resort now has an indoor Fantasy Island Children’s Paradise, which is very suitable for walking the baby on rainy days. There is a children’s pool and a playground outside. When the weather is good, you can give your baby more outdoor time! Going down from the cute pet paradise, there is also a lakeside plank road where you can take pictures 📷 Super beautiful!
Thank you for the good weather in Qiandao Lake this time. I almost canceled the trip because of the rainstorm warning! Fortunately, it went smoothly!

Although Fantasy Island has two floors, many of them require game coins. There is a separate fee of 2 yuan per coin. There are not many animals in the cute pet park. There is a relatively unique little brown bear. We have to make an appoin**ent in advance to enter.

msg:After comparing many hotels, I finally chose Kaiyuan Resort, and it turns out that this choice is completely correct! If you travel by high-speed rail, get out of Qiandao Lake Station, which is a relatively close high-end hotel. Take a taxi for about 30 minutes, or take a bus. Every hotel will stop, and Kaiyuan Resort is the third stop.

Environment: The environment of Kaiyuan Resort is nothing to say, it faces the Qiandao Lake scenic spot directly, the room is big, I like their balcony very much, blowing the natural wind, enjoying the scenery, and drying clothes.

Service: The waiters here are very enthusiastic. They upgraded the room for us and equipped with an exclusive butler. Our little butler, Zhou Zhou, is very considerate. He prepared small gift bags for the children and arranged them in the room every day. Remind to close the doors and windows at night to prevent mosquitoes.

Facilities: After all, it is a five-star hotel. Although it has been open for a long time, the facilities are still good. Cute Pet Paradise, Sensen Sports Ground, and Happy Water Village are all very fun. Guests staying in the hotel are free, just register the room number. The staff are also very serious and responsible, and they will always remind children to pay attention to safety (after all, children are hi Get up and forget about it). Although there is a charge for the car town, there are many items to play, and game coins are also given away, so it is not a problem to play in it for a whole day.

Sanitation: The sanitation of the hotel is very good, and the restrooms in the public area are also very clean.

It is worth mentioning that the hotel has its own cruise ships, which are divided into two types: going to the island and not going to the island. We took the Kaiyuan No. 7 on the island, and the whole journey took more than 4 hours. We went to Moonlight Island and Meifeng Island. play with it. Compared with the cruise ships in Qiandao Lake Scenic Area, although the price is a bit more expensive, it is convenient, does not need to go out of the resort, and has fewer people and high comfort.

This is a very pleasant trip, the children had a great time, and I will choose Kaiyuan Resort next time I come to Qiandao Lake.

The whole place is very quiet. I often see peacocks walking under the balcony. I changed to a buckwheat pillow and fell asleep right away.
In addition, the poached eggs in the breakfast are delicious and runny.

Provided us with a very good service! Although there was a small problem, from the waiter to the lobby manager, they were actively helping me to solve it for us. We were unwilling to change the room due to our own reasons, and gave us a gift! It made us feel embarrassed, it's not really a big problem, but we are very satisfied with the attitude of the hotel! Everyone greets guests warmly when they see them! The food in the Chinese restaurant is also delicious, we ate there two nights in a row! If there is a chance, I will definitely stay here again when I come to Qiandao Lake!

Food: For dinner, we had a buffet for 138 people (free for those under 1.2) with a wide variety of lobster and seafood (very fresh). At the door of the modeling steamed buns, there are little brothers and sisters making modeling balloons for the children, which is so warm
Play: There are cute pet paradise and happy water village for free. My timid family can play in the indoor swimming pool. The constant temperature is very suitable for young babies. There are several places in the cute pet paradise. The place to exercise in the water is relatively simple. There are table tennis tables. I didn’t see billiards. Car Town and Sensen Stadium are paid. I don’t have time to play. I gave two bags of food when I checked out. It’s a bit unpalatable. Why don’t you send some toys that the children like? Or books, etc. Overall, it’s a good experience for summer vacation, except that it’s a bit more expensive.

msg:Location: The hotel is at the innermost part of a peninsula, and you can take a shuttle bus to get in and out of the peninsula, which is quite convenient. It is about half an hour's drive from the high-speed rail station, which is relatively close. There are some restaurants within walking distance from the peninsula, and it takes seven or eight minutes to walk to Xiushui Square.
Guest room: The decoration is old-fashioned and should have been renovated in recent years, so it is not old. But the air conditioner is too weak. In the middle, there was still a power cut, and the child got hot all over with prickly heat. In the future, I will not dare to come in the summer.
Facilities: The outdoor swimming pool is okay, but unfortunately it only opens after two o'clock. In such a hot day, it is said that the water temperature is not enough in the morning, but it is actually higher than the water temperature of their indoor swimming pool, so there is no way to change it. Personal facilities are also charged, and I feel that the cost performance is not high
Service: The room service is still very good. The little butler, Nao Nao, is very enthusiastic and considerate. The waiter is also very enthusiastic, and also sent fruit and yogurt, and put a small gift on the bed, which is quite warm

However, the first impression Kaiyuan gave me was that the service was very good. I stayed in Qiandao Lake for a few days and changed several hotels, each with its own characteristics, but the best service must be Kaiyuan Resort Hotel. The first time I went to the hotel reception, the little girl decisively arranged for a handsome young man curry to be my guide. He also has a cute name called Guagua, which is very interesting and easy to remember. Guagua’s service is very detailed and he sent me the details of the hotel The office introduction and business hours, and also answer my questions, help to find a way to solve the problem, very considerate.

Dandan also thoughtfully prepared comfrey cream and mosquito repellent spray. It's just that the hotel's facilities are a bit old. That doesn't affect my liking for him. The small animals inside are also very friendly and docile. On the second day, I heard what the driver of the private car said, saying that the water entertainment facilities of the Hilton Hotel are good, and there is a discount for staying in the hotel, only to find out that it is a scam. It's a pity, the water facilities are outsourced, and the service is not in place. The level of work at the front desk also needs to be improved. New Century Resort Hotel is a place that I would like to go again after I have been there, but this Hilton is here and I never want to come again.

msg:In fact, overall I am satisfied, but as a family resort hotel
Very dissatisfied with the staff and supervisors of Auto Town in the photo
Since it was already past 8 o'clock on the night of check-in, I learned that the children's paradise would close at 9 o'clock, so I felt there was no need to go in and play because it was only possible to enter and exit on the same day.
We went there again before ten o'clock the next morning. We waited for a long time for the family to enter through face recognition. When we arrived, the staff said that we could just scan the code and buy a ticket for 99, and then we scanned the code on WeChat and bought it (then I Why did you have to wait for me in the first place? Just tell me if you can buy a mobile phone.)
Wear non-slip socks
Ready to scan the QR code to enter
Found you can't go in? (The staff who scanned the code also looked confused)
Call the supervisor
Oh, it turns out that the price has increased by 238 today, and the 99 one is no longer available.
After saying it was a mistake by their staff, they did not apologize and expressed their willingness to let me in at half price in a very bad manner.
Haha, who cares if you give me half the price?
Later, some parents bought this for 99 and didn’t get it, so they had to return it and buy it again.
As a parent-child resort hotel, the park is a bonus, but the price increases more than twice during holidays without even the staff knowing, which is a bit exaggerated.
Due to your mistakes in work, I wasted my time and affected my mood, so I have to leave a negative review. I hope the person in charge of the hotel can see this review and strengthen the training of the staff in the photo!

The forest sports field has many sports, and you will never get tired of playing;
The car town in Fantasy Island is suitable for little boys, but our little girl doesn't like to play.
It is also very convenient to go out of the hotel. There are two ways to travel by shuttle bus and bicycle. There are barbecues and small restaurants on the street outside the hotel.
The first choice hotel for children during summer vacation.

In particular, I would like to praise the butler arranged by the hotel for us: Brother Guagua Curry. The service is super enthusiastic. He took the initiative to inform us about some activities of the hotel during the Children's Day, and even gave the baby toys.

msg:Take the children on June 1st. The little brother at the front desk upgraded my child to a parent-child suite. There is also an exclusive butler who can serve your questions and requests 24 hours a day. Let us come to Qiandao Lake New Century Resort as warm and friendly as at home. The butler is Guagua Curry is a handsome and quiet guy. I think parents with children must come to Kaiyuan Resort for a few nights, because the cute pet paradise + outdoor amu*****t facilities are really children's amu*****t world, which is great , will come again next time! I will also look for Guagua.

msg:Facilities: Qiandao Lake is an old-fashioned hotel. The hotel facilities are relatively complete. It is suitable for bringing children to stay. You can have fun in the hotel. There are cute pet parks, outdoor playgrounds, and indoor amu*****t parks (newly renovated, additional charges). Children like to feed small animals very much and go every day.
Room service: The room is on the top floor, next to the hotel lobby. It is very clean and tidy. We also prepared welcome fruit, because some children even arranged it thoughtfully. The service is also very heartwarming. We gave the children cute hairpins when we checked in, and we left the hotel The suit also gave a small gift. In particular, I would like to give the staff Lingjuan a five-star praise. I specially installed a bedside around the bed, and gave biscuits and yogurt to the children. It is cleaned every day.
Catering: Breakfast is like a buffet in a Hawaiian restaurant, with both Chinese and Western styles, very rich, and can be taken away from 7:00-10:00. The fish head soup in Chinese restaurants is very good, very delicious and not fishy at all. One pot is enough, at least 4-5 adults

It is still very good as a hotel, babysitter, or vacation. I recommend everyone to travel at off-peak times. Children can have fun in the hotel, and adults can also see the lake view. In addition, everyone should try to pick sunny days, the scenery is more beautiful

I didn't want the cake, but I gave them red wine. All requests were answered patiently. There is a cute pet paradise children's playground where you can play for a day. Full marks for evaluation.

The business is proficient, answering every question, responding to requests, enthusiastic and proactive, and one-on-one butler service. The little butler Zhenzhen is very good 👍Five-star praise ⭐️
The hotel is far away from the business district, which is not convenient for dining. The breakfast in the hotel is relatively rich, but the taste of the ingredients in the Chinese restaurant is not as good as before, and the price is much more expensive than outside. Afternoon tea ☕️ is good, and the view is also good.
Now the hotel has added a lot of children's play areas, which are more suitable for parent-child vacations.
The price of similar hotels is still relatively high, but there are often discount package coupons, you can pay attention to Ctrip's hotel live broadcast and other activities.

The little brother at the front desk was very enthusiastic and patient, and even upgraded the room. The little butler, Qi Qi, provided excellent service, and even gave the children companions when I checked in present. Aunt Liang is very careful in cleaning the room, and there are little surprises (little rabbits and swans) every time she comes back from the house. The children had a great time playing in the playground downstairs of the hotel, and caught small fish by the lake. There are also two souvenirs when leaving the store, including desserts and drinks! The overall experience of environmental services and sanitation facilities is great 👍🏻, highly recommended! Will stay here next time.

The lake view is beautiful and the service is particularly good, making the guests feel at home. Because it is the off-season of tourism, we upgraded the room. Although the room is not big, it is very cozy. The warm color style makes people feel very comfortable. Especially the breakfast, which basically makes people feel that the room rate is worth it! Except that the hardware facilities are a bit old, all the software facilities match the five-star hotels. Why do we believe in Kaiyuan? Why live in Kaiyuan? It is because there are so many service staff who really care about the guests! We can live happily, play happily, eat happily. (In addition, I also want to praise the butler "Kaka". We can save our worries and effort by saying everything clearly and clearly.)

The cute pet park is cleaner than the Kaiyuan Senbo in Hangzhou that I have been to before. I saw a five-day-old deer in it, just turned 50 The little raccoons in heaven🦝, the breeders also take care of them very carefully and lovingly. The Sensen Stadium is also great. It feels like a small forest park by the lake, and there is also a car town that has just opened. In short, the children had a lot of fun and satisfaction, and they felt full of vacation.
In addition, I would like to thank our housekeeper Aya and waiter Liang Xueqing. They provided us with a super service experience during our two-day stay. There were bed towels for both days. 520 also prepared small gifts and fruit every day. We returned after swimming. They gave us yogurt, and a snack bag for us to eat on the way when we checked out. . . In short, it is Haidilao's considerate service, like it👍

When we arrived at the store in the afternoon, there were not many people at the front desk. The glasses guy thoughtfully gave us free The room was upgraded to one level, and two children were given gifts to stay in the upper and lower bunks. For us who have a second treasure, it is really friendly!
Although the room looks like a very old layout, it is clean and tidy without being sloppy. Each room has a small balcony. There is a small swing on our balcony. It does not affect the swing on rainy days. Watching the rain The Qiandao Lake, not to mention how pleasant it is.
There are too many parent-child activities in the hotel to count. There are 2 feed coupons in the cute pet park, which can be used for two days. Sensen Sports Ground can also be entered with a room card. The best choice for outdoor discharge, and there is a free car town, from the entry The face can be entered until 12:00 the next day. The facilities are new and there are not many people. The play experience is really much better than that of Moerbao. The children were very addicted.
On the elevator floor where the parent-child room is located, there is a whole row of small toys on the wall, which can be played by young babies. My brother is 9 months old, and such small toys are most suitable.
The room service aunt is also very diligent. We asked for two more bottles of water for milk powder, and they delivered them right away. The breakfast buffet in the Chinese restaurant and the Western restaurant are both well received. There are a lot of choices, and children are fully considered, which is great!
The itinerary for three days and two nights is very fulfilling, whether it is rainy or sunny, you can have a good time in the hotel.

msg:The top parent-child hotel in Qiandao Lake, although the outdoor swimming pool has not been opened since April, it is still a great time to play every day. It is not far from Tianyu Mountain, the central cruise ship terminal, the southeast cruise ship terminal, and Fishing Street. It is easy to take a taxi with your baby.
I saw the magnificent Qiandao Lake sunset on the lakeside of Kaiyuan Hotel (there is no need to wait for the sunset on Tianyu Mountain).
The scale of the Pet Paradise exceeds expectations. Feed foals, deer, rabbits, lambs, etc., watch peacocks open their tails, as well as squirrels, groundhogs, and parrots. We stayed 4 days and fed 3 days 😀
The car town has two floors, with a lot of items, a paradise for children, on the second floor, you can role-play and change clothes, girls like Hanfu, princess clothes, and accessories. Boys can cosplay policemen, firefighters, and doctors. We stayed for 4 days and played for 3 days. . The outside attractions only go to Tianyu Mountain, the two essences of Huangshan Peak, and watched the show of the Spirit of Water at night. Stay at the hotel the rest of the time
There is a non-powered playground by the lakeside of the hotel, which also has a lot of activities. The children are very happy to expand outdoor sports.
We couldn't do it for a day or two, so we stayed 4 nights. Except for eating once at Fishing Street, the rest are meals in the hotel. The products and services of the Chinese restaurant are exquisite, and the price/performance ratio is actually very high. As long as you don’t order big dishes and add Kaiyuan member discounts, it’s much more comfortable than eating out. Recommended Chinese restaurant's red wine steak, shrimp tofu soup, dried celery, scallion oil fish cubes, brine pork heart, abalone steamed egg, tomato egg soup, baby dishes, all home-cooked, delicious and inexpensive.
Finally, I would like to praise Kaiyuan Qiandao Lake for its high-quality service. We have stayed in several Kaiyuan hotels before, and they all left a good impression. This one is the most considerate. From the front desk, butler, room service, restaurants, parks, etc., every line embodies Kaiyuan's thoughtful service concept.
We would like to commend Aya, our housekeeper, for her efficient and perfect solution to the small problems of check-in. There is also room service Liang Xueqing, the perfect turndown service and surprises for the children.
I think we will come back to Qiandaohu Kaiyuan again.

I called the hotel a few days before departure to confirm, just ask Upgrading the room? The manager of the hotel arranged it personally, all 4 of our rooms were upgraded, and the guest relations director (Dan Dan) added me on WeChat, no matter what time and time I asked her, she would be able to help answer it quickly. After staying in the hotel, I feel that this choice is correct. The location of the hotel is like a fish mouth where you can see the lake on three sides.

It is quite good to walk around and take pictures , The service of this hotel is really nothing to say, every staff member you meet in the hotel will greet you with a smile, and the front desk and guest rooms will respond to your needs. Let me focus on the Chinese restaurant. One of our friends on this trip happened to have a birthday on the 18th, so dinner was arranged in the restaurant of the hotel to celebrate his birthday. Manager Guan and Ms. Dandan not only arranged a private room with a lake view after learning about it, but also gave it as a gift Birthday cake and red wine, fish head soup vouchers, did you think it was over yet? When we got back to the room, surprises were still waiting for us. The bunny pattern was carefully arranged on the bed in each room, which was very warm...I think This is what a five star hotel should look like! Check out at noon on the third day and there will be a surprise bag of gifts (water, drinks, local snacks) in each room. I have stayed in many five-star hotels, but Qiandao Lake New Century Resort is unforgettable in my life! Thanks again to all the staff at the hotel...

Although I have never stayed at the Kaiyuan Resort in Qiandao Lake, Ctrip often recommends it, so I temporarily booked a room on the train. When I arrived at the lobby to check in, a beautiful sister received me, because I booked two types of rooms that were not on the same floor. In order to make it easier for me to take care of my mother, she kindly helped me upgrade the room and arranged 2 rooms next to each other. Room, also gave me a lot of suggestions for playing, I sincerely thank Wu Xiaoqing. During the stay, the personal butler Dandan was on call at any time to help me solve any problems encountered during the stay, thank you. Standing on the balcony of the room, looking at the center of the lake, the scenery is pleasant and the mood is comfortable. When getting up late, the waiter Liang Xueqing folded a beautiful swan for us, thank you. We had lunch and dinner at Xiushui Pavilion on the 3rd floor. The fish head soup was very delicious, and my mother liked it. The breakfast variety is also relatively rich, and the service is very timely. The waiters can keep their eyes on the four sides, and they will take away the empty plates immediately. Walk anywhere in the hotel and meet any waiters, they will greet you warmly and politely. On the first day we stayed in a lake-view room, and on the second day I chose the Kaiyuan family suite. The room is relatively large and I can live with my mother. There was a problem with the room during the stay in the suite, and Tingting, the lobby manager, dealt with it in a timely manner. Finally, I would like to thank Dandan again for couriering the clothes I left in the room. I think I will go to Kaiyuan again soon, because Tingting sent me tickets to Fantasy Island, and the sales are doing very well. I drank the BIROT red wine sent by Tingting at home, it tastes good, thank you.

Before leaving, Ina, the housekeeper of the room, even prepared a small gift bag. The breakfast was not good for the baby, so the waitress in the restaurant thoughtfully packed some bread. When I came back on the first night, I found that the baby was dressed up as a warm bunny on the bed, and the baby liked it very much. In addition, the hotel's supporting children's playground, outdoor playground, and cute pet paradise are very good, and the surrounding ecology is also good, and there are free-range peacocks and white pigeons. Don't go back when the baby plays, and will come again❤️

The room is very clean, and the welcome fruit is nice!

The taste of the Chinese restaurant is very good, and the price/performance ratio is also acceptable.

The only thing that needs to be improved is the hotel's breakfast. The breakfast service staff is great, but the variety and taste of the meals need to be improved.

Next time I have a chance, I will stay again and see if the breakfast has improved.

msg:The location is relatively remote, and it takes half a day to drive up the mountain, and the facilities are outdated. Ningxiangyuan is expensive and delicious, and the buffet has not been set.
The amu*****t facilities are being renovated, surrounded everywhere, messy and smelling of paint, the cute pet park is quite small, I haven't seen a few animals, and it costs 20 yuan to feed, it's not much fun.
The lake-view room is the side facing the shore. It mainly looks at the opposite residence and Xiushui Square. It cannot be said that there is no lake. There is a lake downstairs and a vegetable field next to it.
The service attitude of the staff is very good, but it cannot make up for the above shortcomings.
In short, I didn't eat well, and I didn't play well, so I was very disappointed.

msg:The hotel has been open for 20 years, but the facilities are really old, mainly reflected in the following aspects:
1. The air conditioner is noisy. It is so noisy that I can’t sleep when it is turned on. It is too hot when it is not turned on.
2. The sound insulation of the room is poor. You can hear the snoring next door in the middle of the night.
3. The hygiene in the room was poor. The child had rashes on his body, and they appeared on a large area. Two of the three babies in the same group had it. I was really distressed.
4. The service is average. When you arrive at the restaurant, the waiters will not take the initiative to provide baby chairs, baby tableware, and bibs. You have to ask them for them yourself. I hope to learn from Moganshan Senbo.
5. There are few breakfast varieties. This breakfast in a five-star hotel is really bad. I can’t even pick out a few favorites. There is not even the most basic latte.

Overall, the biggest problem is the room. We won’t come here again unless we renovate it. There are many choices for family-friendly hotels at this price. There is no need to harm your children.

The environment of the hotel is very good. The fly in the oin**ent is that the outdoor facilities are undergoing large-scale renovations. The construction starts at 7 o'clock every morning. Loud talking on the construction site affects the overall experience of staying.

The guest room and the lobby are on the same level because it is an island? It may have been renovated for a long time. When I entered the room, I turned on the air conditioner but it didn’t feel warm. It was still turned on quite high. Is there any sound when the bathroom’s exhaust is turned on? It’s probably broken, but the large size is a bit embarrassing😳 But it’s worth mentioning that the breakfast is good, with a lot of variety while sitting and eating, and you can also see the lake view

The sound of various tow trucks in the early morning, maybe the cleaning lady was doing her work, made me suspect that I was... It’s not that the door is not closed. When ordering takeout, the courier boy will not be allowed to deliver it. There is no robot to deliver the meal. The waiter will not deliver it and has to go to the lobby to get it. The key point is that the takeout can only be placed outside the door. The cold wind is blowing and it is cold when you get it. Well, this is a so-called five-star hotel. It doesn’t even have the most basic concept of service. It’s worse than a chain hotel. Who knows who stays there? I won’t go there again. It’s far away from the attractions. You have to take a taxi or drive yourself. Okay, wouldn’t it be nice to live in the newly opened Minghao? I’m so disappointed.

Great hope, I didn't expect Kaka to directly help me secure a seat, I was so touched, and finally got a gift after checking out, I was very happy. But the taste of the western restaurant is mediocre... It feels like a vacation, and I can finally enjoy some beer. In addition, there are charging piles here. On the third floor, there are 8 guns. Sometimes the location is relatively tight. You can ask the hotel to help you pay attention.

The price in the off-season is very advantageous~ I didn’t have much expectations (the price is too good), who knows that it is unexpectedly good, the hotel not only upgrades the room type ( The original garden room was upgraded to a lake view room. Although the lake view is not as good as the lake view room, it is still very good.) The most important thing is that the room is very clean. Although the hotel is a bit old, the bathroom and floor are still very clean, and the furniture is also clean. It is very seaside resort style (bamboo weaving), there are hotel fruits every day, and the service of the hotel is also very good. Almost everyone will greet you warmly when they meet. The aunt who is in charge of our floor even gave a bear to the children, which is very considerate. When I checked out, I was negligent and forgot to take the accessories. The hotel called immediately to notify me and got them back in time. In the off-season, Qiandao Lake is less crowded and the scenery is beautiful. The sunset at the hotel is also super beautiful. You don’t have to go to the scenic spots, but you can see it clearly, which is great! The hotel is worth recommending~

The price/performance ratio can be said to be relatively low. For 2 adults and 1 child, breakfast for a child over 120cm requires an additional 58 yuan. Does the parent-child hotel not include breakfast for children? In fact, the parent-child hotel does not have any facilities in the room. Children's slippers and bathrobes are given one by one.
2. Geographical location: The location is independent but it can also be said that it is very inconvenient to travel, except for self-driving. With the elderly and children, I don’t have a car, so I can’t go out. To get to the road outside, I have to go around on a narrow road for 1-2 kilometers. I really can’t walk that far on a hot day, so I have to go in front of the hotel and next to the swimming pool. I walked around the place and had nowhere to go for a walk.
3. The price of the Chinese restaurant is okay, and it is considered to be a good value for money in the hotel. The taste is generally acceptable. The roast duck skin I ordered was hard and not delicious, and the other two dishes were okay.

The hotel is doing a good job with the family. Because the outdoor activity facilities are being built in the off-season, it can be seen that the design is intentional. It's great to bring the children to play when it's built! The service staff are friendly and greet us warmly. There are welcome fruits on both days. Aunt Lin Juan also brought us buckwheat pillows and sleeping milk. I feel at home! The dishes in the Chinese restaurant are also top-notch. The fish head soup lives up to its reputation. The fish meat is tender without any fishy smell. The milky white fish soup is rich in nutrition. The most surprising thing is the raw drunk crab. What a great place, I will come here often in the future!

msg:Take your parents and children on a walk-and-go trip. Qiandao Lake, this season is not the peak season yet. But because of the weekend, there are many people in the hotel. I chose Kaiyuan Resort because there is a cute pet paradise. Little deer, peacock and lamb, children are very happy. After reading some reviews, I know that the hotel is relatively old and is being renovated. But the advantage is that the location is good and the lake view is good. Just booked a family suite on Ctrip. After arriving, it is true that many places have been remodeled, and it doesn't feel very good. Fortunately, my son loves excavators and is very happy to see the construction. Old hotel, all kinds of facilities are relatively old, not as convenient as modern hotels. But the hotel is well maintained and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The 2-year-old children all said that this bed is really comfortable. The most impressive thing is the service. This is really nothing to say, the waiter is very enthusiastic, serious and responsible. very comfortable. They also gave small gifts to the children, and a welcome bunny was placed on the bed. Different fruits and yogurt are sent every day. Parents are happy and speak highly of it. Definitely let me praise the customer service staff. The breakfast in the hotel is very rich and very good. Must praise. Chinese restaurants are very expensive, but the taste is good, and the fish head soup is delicious. One lunch for three, three, and one small is 1000+. The price could be lower. Rent a three-person bicycle in the hotel lobby, 60 for an hour. I had a lot of fun at the beginning, and the wind was very refreshing when going downhill, but going uphill directly killed me. Can't ride it at all. I can only push down in embarrassment. sweating. Legs are sore. Personally, I think it is not necessary to rent. The hotel's cycling route is not around the lake, and many cars come and go, which is not safe. There is no sightseeing scenery either. It's better to take the children for a walk in the hotel, see the free-range peacocks, feed the deer, and dig the sand by the lake. The view of the lake is beautiful. Sunset, breeze, walking, very pleasant. After leaving the hotel, all kinds of food and drinks were given away. I ordered the hotel drop-off service, and the commercial vehicle is very convenient. Overall, Kaiyuan is still good. It should be even better after the renovation is complete.

Because it was a bit late, I didn't go out. I ate Chinese food on the third floor of the hotel at night. The fish head and pig's feet were also delicious. I like the hotel's food and beverage level!
Aunt Jiang on the 6th floor is also very nice. She prepared welcome fruits and heart-warming decorations, which the children thought were very good.
The breakfast is also very good, with a variety of varieties. Maybe February is the off-season, and there is no need to line up. The experience is very good!
It's just that the cute pet paradise is really not good, it stinks. The outdoor play facilities are good, but the outdoor swimming pool is a bit noisy under construction! The indoor swimming pool on the first floor is also very good, and you can play in the water even in cold weather. When I checked out at noon, I met a peacock on the third floor 🦚 with its screen open. It was really good luck!
I am very satisfied with the hotel's service this time, and I plan to come back next time during the summer vacation, and I will definitely stay here again.

Due to the impromptu itinerary and the end of the Spring Festival, many hotels do not have double-bedroom suites. I was worried that the hotel facilities were old. When I arrived, I found that although the facilities were not new, the facilities were well maintained. The elevator is fast and convenient, there are charging piles in the parking lot, there is a faint fragrance in the hotel, there are no dead corners in the room, welcome fruit at night, and you can meet the cleaning lady who greets you warmly in the corridor every day, which is completely at the standard of an old five-star hotel. You can see the lake view from the balcony of the suite. There is an exclusive island and a beach downstairs. The children had a great time in the Pet Paradise, and the breakfast was delicious. Falling in love with Qiandao Lake has a credit to Kaiyuan.

Again, although the hotel is a bit old, the sanitation is still good, and the food in the Chinese restaurant is also ok;
Finally, due to the surge of guests on the fourth day of the ***** new year, the breakfast period was overcrowded. We would like to thank the manager on duty that day for helping us arrange the seats. All the service staff worked in an orderly manner under the premise of a large number of diners.

I ordered breakfast for two people, one adult and two children, one 6 years old and one 13 years old. I was blocked from having to charge an additional breakfast fee for one child. I was speechless. How long did it take to stay with the children? This is the first time I encountered such a weird hotel. I went to the front desk to ask about non-hotel items, but I didn’t know anything about them, ***. Such employees are indeed very loyal to their boss. If you don’t spend money from my hotel, I won’t know. This hotel is highly not recommended. It ranks third among family-friendly tours. What a fool!

The lake view room has a small balcony. The sunset scene is so beautiful, and I took a lot of beautiful sunset scenes when I went down to the shore. The archery coupons and bicycle coupons are good, especially the bicycles, which can be ridden outside the resort. The concierge gave us protective gear.

I called the parent-child hotel, but when I arrived, I found that all entertainment items were not available. You can play, they are all under renovation... The swimming pool and other entertainment items are not open... Because most of the waiters are sunny... The air conditioner in the public area is not working well, it should be not turned on at all, it feels like saving electricity... The room facilities are also very old , the hygienic conditions also look very average... not like the standard of a five-star hotel... a little disappointed... the cost of meals is also high, a few steps can cost hundreds of dollars, and a 30% service fee will be charged for room delivery... Than High in foreign countries... It takes about 20 minutes to drive from the central area of Qiandao Lake ↔️ Overall, the publicity is very inconsistent with the reality, and the experience is not very good...

The TV is also very antique. It is relatively small and the picture quality is average, so I will only watch the game. The toiletries are all bottled, which gives people the feeling of a fast chain hotel, and it is also listed as a five-star hotel!

She gave away tools for playing with sand, sugar, and corn to feed the peacocks. Even the cleaning aunt will say hello (but I think this depends on character).
There are also more types of breakfast. There are also peacocks to feed, and the little ones and the elderly are very happy.
The day I went may be because the weather was cold and it was a weekday, so there were not many people, so I upgraded the room, which is quite good.
As for the environment, there is no need to say that it is the only location on the peninsula. If it is cloudy or rainy, it is bad luck. If the weather is good and sunny, you can see a very beautiful sunset (you don't have to go to the Tianyu Observation Deck to see it). On the day we went, we hurried to Tianyu to watch the sunset. As a result, admission was stopped at 4:30. When we rushed back to the hotel, we happened to see a particularly beautiful sunset, from a white sun to an orange pancake, and then to another It formed a big red ball, and finally slowly "sinked" into the lake and mountains.
The only thing that feels slightly insufficient is that the hotel's hardware facilities are a bit old and haven't been replaced for a long time. Many guests also mentioned this. For example, the heating of the air conditioner is not good, and the ventilation in the toilet is very weak, at least the two rooms of me and my parents are like this. I hope that if the hotel’s economy allows it, it will be reopened after a period of overhaul, and the hardware facilities (air conditioning, exhaust, and even fresh air system) will be upgraded again, and there should be more guests. After all, the environment is really unique, and it is really invincible to make up for the shortcomings.

Kaiyuan's service is guaranteed. This time, the service butler, Amy (Xiao Ni), took us to the room very thoughtfully, introduced the relevant situation, and also gave us red wine very thoughtfully, I like it. The hotel has a lot of facilities, such as Children's Happy City, swimming pool, gym, etc. Children can play a lot of things, and they don't have to leave the hotel for a few days. . . In addition, it is also a good experience to take the hotel's cruise ship out of the lake to view the scenery. The master who drives the boat is a local, and he is very nice. In addition, during the National Day, the hotel also has an outdoor music festival project at night. I took my family to listen to the scene from handsome men and beautiful women for an hour at night, which was very good. Speaking of disadvantages, it is that the price is a little expensive during the eleventh period. In addition, there is a problem with the leveling of the shower room floor. In short, as long as the budget is sufficient, I still want to stay here next time. Kaiyuan's quality and service are still worth recommending.

msg:Although the hotel is a little old, it does not affect the comfort of the entry experience. The hardware facilities can be matched with the reputation of the five-star hotel. The hotel swimming pool, outdoor tea bar and entertainment venues in the hotel are quite rich. Projects, swimming or swinging and reading books can also pass the day, and you can feel like an island vacation.
If you must make a request, you can add some cups and bar refrigerators in the room. Although some guests do not need it, not all guests are unwilling to pay for it. In addition, it would be better if the bar is richer.

msg:Due to the Shanghai epidemic, I made many calls to inquire about the epidemic policy of the stay. When we arrived, the local Shanghai just cleared, and the hotel did not check for nucleic acids. The front desk also told me that there is a shuttle bus from the high-speed rail exit to the hotel, the price is 15 yuan per person, which is very good. The return journey needs to be booked in advance on the WeChat public account Yibu Travel.
I stayed for three days and two nights, and I came with my parents and children. The booking was relatively late, so there was no family room, so I booked two deluxe view rooms. I feel that the hotel is generally very good. When I arrived more than 11 o'clock earlier, I called the front desk at the gate and asked the concierge to send a car to pick it up at the entrance of the island. It usually takes 10 minutes to arrive. The waiting area is too hot, it would be nice if there was a water spray.
Since I arrived early, I couldn't check in yet. I called a car to go out for dinner and then came back to check in. I added a young lady, Wang Zi 7571, as a housekeeper, so I could ask her some hotel questions. Every guest has a butler. The concierge gave the children a small bag with non-slip socks, a swimming cap, and a small water gun to feed the peacocks with corn.
We ate dinner at the western restaurant of the hotel. A Shanghai tourist said it was good. We also booked a buffet for three large and one small in the evening. The price was quite favorable. We bought it on the public comment and needed to reserve a seat in advance. In particular, I would like to mention that the eldest sister Ye Liying was very enthusiastic. She brought us a lot of food that needed to be lined up. On the day of leaving, she also gave some snacks and fruits for the stomach on the road as hand companions. Gave a doll to a child.
Because looking at the check-in reviews, it is actually a hotel with anxiety. The facilities are relatively complete, with bathtubs and showers. I don't know which guest commented that they were not separated. Maybe the room types are different, I think. There are also RVs in the hotel, and they look good. You can experience them later. There is also a small courtyard on the first floor, and a swing is also good for this type of room. It seems that there are also single-family villas.
There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and there is a bubble show from 5 to 6 pm, which is a favorite of children. Many newcomers take pictures here, and the props are quite suitable for our tourists to take pictures. Unknowingly, I have written so much. I really am a chatterer.

I happened to be in contact with the hotel staff on shifts, including Xiao Liting, Liang Xueqing, and a few names I didn't remember (sorry), and the front desk in the lobby, they The service is very good, very warm and meticulous. The scenery of the hotel is very good, Southeast Asian style, the parents admitted that they just want to lie on the balcony and watch the scenery, and they don't want to go anywhere. The facility is a little old because it is an old five-star brand, but it is well maintained and there are no mosquitoes, which is very good. The independent pier can also swim directly to the island on the lake without leaving the hotel, and the yacht staff is also good. The inner and outer pools are nice. The breakfast is rich, and the price of the a la carte restaurant is good. We don't eat onion and garlic, and the hotel can serve it according to the requirements. We ate four meals in the restaurant on the third floor. The nucleic acid point is not far away. Overall very happy. I read a lot of reviews before booking, there are good and bad, I think the price is very high here, but staying in a hotel is like buying a house, not perfect, if you want everything to be perfect, the only flaw is the price, this is written to pay Samsung price For those who want to enjoy the service of Seven Stars.

Service: Miss Chen Qi from the Reception Depar**ent and Ye Liying from the Food and Beverage Depar**ent, during the stay, they were enthusiastic and dedicated to service, which is very good👍
To sum up, this is the second stay in five years. The hotel is still being upgraded and renovated. It is estimated that when I come to Qiandao Lake in a few years, I will still choose Kaiyuan 😁😁😁

It is worth mentioning that the service level of the hotel is very high, which is the most impressive this time. The staff are very polite and friendly, which makes people quickly integrate into the relaxed a**osphere of the hotel, especially the little sister Peng Lijuan of the concierge, who is very old. Gently, like a friend, he can always think of the needs of the guests in advance, and he does it silently without disturbing them, which is very touching and makes people love this hotel even more.

The location of the hotel is very good, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Qiandao Lake, and it looks like a painting from a distance. The most impressive thing about the hotel is the Haidilao-like service. For example, after checking in, there is a dedicated butler who will add WeChat one-on-one service. If you have any questions, someone can help you at any time. I bought a Coke Sprite and delivered it to my door. When we left the store, we also gave a bag of small gifts, which was very thoughtful. One of the rooms we stayed in was an RV, and the waiter Fang Xiumei gave us a detailed introduction and handled any problems in a timely manner. The children had a great time in the Children's Happy City, and this time I would also like to thank the waiter Zhang Huiyi for helping the children solve their problems. In short, the hotel is relatively old except for the facilities (the RV is really old, the door lock is not very good, although the children like it very much, you need to use the key to open the door, and the solar water heater used in the rain should pay attention to the time of the permanent hot water. ), there are a lot of people dining in the cafeteria, others are perfect, the happy family tour is over.

    The hotel is enough to play for a few days. There are indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and the swimming pools are divided according to the age of the children. Each pool is supervised by professional lifeguards.
     The most worth mentioning is Happy City, which is simply a place for coaxing babies. There are basically everything children want to play in. The little beauty Zhang Huiyi received us in Happy City. She introduced us in detail about several areas of Happy City. Which are more suitable for small children and which are suitable for older children. The baby has been playing in it for a long time and refuses to leave😸
In short, the food, lodging and play are very good, this trip is worth it. I will bring my baby to play next time.

I also gave a bottle of red wine on my birthday hahaha and it was really an accident. Liang Xueqing from the room service really gave our little brother a little surprise every night. As soon as he got home, he was decorated very cute and warm, and there were free toy cars and dolls. Every day is different. In the past, the bed sheets were dirty, and the Shanghai hotel asked you to pay for it, but this time my brother vomited accidentally. Liang Xueqing helped us all replace them as soon as possible, and even sent a car to comfort my brother. If there are families with children, I still recommend Kaiyuan. . Xiao Liting from the room relationship also provided various help and answers from the first day of check-in.

Although there is no way to overlook the entire Qiandao Lake, the scenery of the small courtyard is particularly beautiful, and peacocks can be seen from time to time. The high temperature of 40 degrees persuaded us to go out for a walk. I spent three days in the hotel. Fortunately, the outdoor swimming pool of the hotel has a large sunshade, so you can go swimming even in the hottest time at noon. The breakfast buffet is quite satisfactory, not impressed with the delicious food. The dinner buffet really needs to be booked early. We booked one day in advance, and then queued for more than 20 tables. The hotel service is also very enthusiastic. There have been several small problems, and Miss Wang Chenjia, the director of guest relations, has solved them in time.
     But I have to say that the hotel room facilities are old, including hair dryers and other supplies are also relatively cheap feeling, and the price does not match. The premium for summer vacation and weekends is more serious, and a room of 2,000 per night is expensive. I read Xiaohongshu before, and I can stay for 2 nights for about 1000 yuan on weekdays, which is quite worth it.

I feel like the room is quite good because there are exactly 4 adults and 1 child, which is a great deal! The annex building is a bit far away from the main building, but if you call the manager on WeChat, a sightseeing bus will pick you up and drop you off in a few minutes. Children also like to sit there!
Swimming pool, beach, playground 🎡Super suitable for young children!

Stepping on thunder: "Moonlight Island" was cool in those few days, but the island was still very hot and the lights were not as stunning as **! ! It takes 50 minutes to climb up and down the mountain on the island. It feels very average and is not recommended!
The proprietress has a 70 yuan ticket to eat at a restaurant near the "Time Tunnel". It's quite interesting to watch, but it's a bit short. It takes 30 minutes at most to watch it. Suitable for children to play!

msg:Before coming, I read almost all the hotel reviews of Qiandao Lake University, and those amu*****t parks with 17-year-old children have lost their appeal to us. I didn't want to be too far from the town, so I ordered Kaiyuan after a comprehensive look. Although the hotel has been around for more than ten years, the facilities inside are well maintained. If you go out, a battery car will be delivered to the door of the resort at any time, which is convenient for transportation. It's too hot to go out very much. In the hotel, there are bubbles in the outdoor and indoor swimming pools, playing billiards, and taking a walk after sunset. The environment is very good. If you want to find free-range peacocks, you have to go to the parking lot, and the service is also very good. As soon as you check in, there will be a guest relations director and WeChat, and you can find them for anything. We met Jiachen, the beauty queen, and the service was very good, responsive to requests, and a small gift was given when we left the store. In the end, I personally think that the landscape lake view room is the most cost-effective and a very pleasant trip.

It is more suitable for bringing children, there are indoor swimming and outdoor swimming pools, and there are places for children to play games. There is still 🦚 in the resort, I heard the peacock chirping at night, but did not see the peacock during the day. I booked two rooms, picture 2 is the balcony of the lake view queen room, picture 4 is the family suite room, there is a big bed and two small beds, the room is very comfortable, it is a 5-star hotel but the facilities They are relatively old, and the service experience is not bad. Our housekeeper Wang Jiachen will contact us every day on WeChat to check in. There are welcome fruits for the two days of the stay. In addition, when we left, they prepared a small gift bag for us, which was really unexpected.

msg:Recently, Hangzhou has started the barbecue mode. Because of the epidemic, I don’t want to go far away, so I want to go to Qiandao Lake to play in the water nearby! So when choosing a hotel, it is naturally necessary to bring a large swimming pool. I compared several hotels on Ctrip and chose Kaiyuan Resort, which is suitable for parent-child travel. The hotel is surrounded by mountains and water, with beautiful scenery and full of Southeast Asian style. The hotel’s outdoor swimming pool is very nice. There is also a bubble bath at a specific time in the afternoon. The two children had a lot of fun. After playing in the water, I took a turn and found that there were go-karts and kayaks, but I didn’t try it this time because I was in a hurry. I will try it next time. The next step is the essential foraging link when taking a baby out. The hotel has buffet and meal reservation services, but maybe because of the weekend, there are so many people that I can only find it myself! ** found a local specialty fish head restaurant on the Internet, just opposite the hotel entrance, very close! Although the distance from the hotel entrance to the lobby is a bit far, it is very convenient to have a shuttle bus! Of course, food is also pleasing to people. There is always a reason for more people! The next day I got up and went shopping again. The gym, yoga room, indoor heated swimming pool, in short, luxury hotels have everything! At the same time, I would like to thank Miss Wang Jiachen for her warm reception throughout the whole process. She also gave me a gift when I checked out. The main thing is that the little sister is cute and beautiful, full of energy, not bad

I didn't plan to go, but thinking about staying at home is really boring, I locked Qiandao Lake and then I booked this hotel, and there was a lot of traffic jams along the way. Fortunately, the hotel's supporting facilities and services did not disappoint. You can park for free, you can swim, you can see the beautiful lake view, you can enjoy the beautiful night view, you can go to the swimming pool to swim and eat. The buffet breakfast can go to the playground, and you can also enjoy the feeling of the seaside. Of course, there are kayaks to play. The whole package is very complete. It is like a vacation in Sanya, and it is also a bit like Thailand, because their decoration is Southeast Asian style or relatively The recommended fly in the oin**ent is that there are very many people at the buffet, and then especially crowded in one is the old equipment of the house, and the items provided are a little less, such as drinks and snacks.

Excellent parent-child hotel, customer relationship director Wang Jiachen's warm service from beginning to end, thoughtful and meticulous, gifted with peacock feathers, welcome fruits, and surprises for departure gifts. The hotel has a good location, the overall Southeast Asian style, and the feeling of a seaside vacation. Peacocks walking freely, happy swimming pools, indoor children's playgrounds, various punch-in photography spots by the lake... It's amazing! Every morning, the peacock wakes us up on the balcony, and we can feed the peacock on the balcony. The children have a great time! reluctantly. Have the opportunity to come back to New Century Resort Hotel. By the way, the hotel pool security staff is very responsible and gave me safety education for almost half an hour.

A family of four traveled, checked several hotels, and chose Kaiyuan, because only it has set up a family suite that is really suitable for two children: two single beds + one big bed, and even bathrobes, toothbrushes and slippers are matching two children. ,Very carefully! Gym with separate yoga room, perfect! !
The butler service (Ma Wenwen) responds very quickly. All needs are answered on WeChat, and the solution exceeds expectations: 5 waterproof blankets are added to the bathroom, and free archery experience coupons are delivered to the door according to the number of children. Even the room card is refreshed (stayed 2 times for a total of 7 nights) and door-to-door service...
Unexpected health code situation, the hotel's special person in charge (first mate?) actively contacted the epidemic prevention office for several days, made phone calls during the day, and changed to text messages at night. Maybe they were afraid that they would disturb us to sleep. Response, every piece has been implemented, see the details in the details!
The waiter (Li Keying) of the Hawaiian Western Restaurant was also very enthusiastic. He gave the two babies a few plush toys, squeezed juice for us, and packed us a few boxes of washed fruit on the morning of our departure! Xiaobao likes her very much!
The only downside is that there are mosquitoes, which is inevitable. Fortunately, I brought vape anti-mosquito water for my children, and it is much better to spray it~

The hotel environment is very good. This kind of hotel that can use the entire peninsula as a hotel is still very a**ospheric. At least you feel that you are spending money to enjoy it wherever you go. Haha, the room is also very good, at least it is the first time I see my child I love a room so much, but there are also shortcomings, such as the toilet lid does not have a slow-down device, and you can't walk downstairs to buy food and drink, etc.
In addition, I would like to thank Miss Ma Wenwen for her whole-hearted care, as well as a sanitary aunt (leaf cauliflower), who will give the child the peacock tail that was picked up before. These two praises also reflect their overall great service.

This phone call gave people warmth, and they had a good impression of the hotel all of a sudden. During the three nights and four days of the stay, Director Yu Xi has been paying attention to and providing timely assistance, whether it is room problems, children's entertainment, including recommended travel arrangements, etc., almost 24 hours on standby, including when we leave the hotel during her break, She did not forget to wish us a safe journey. Upvote for her!
In the hotel, you can feel the enthusiasm of the hotel staff everywhere. You can often receive greetings in the morning, and children often receive small gifts from the staff.
Yu Haixia, the room service worker, kept giving us surprises. The children had just returned from the playground and received a late-night snack of hot milk and small biscuits. After playing outside to the room, a pot of fruit was already waiting for us. Don't forget to put small animal petals to bring us warmth! Upvote for her!
The hotel is very good. The Chinese restaurant on the third floor and the cafeteria on the fifth floor are clean and beautiful. The dishes are fresh and the taste is good. Especially the Chinese restaurant on the third floor also provides children's meals, which is really a surprise.
Parking is also on the third floor, which can be reached by elevator.
The facilities of the parent-child room also bring convenience to the children's life, such as washing footstools, children's toilets and so on. The corridor layout is also childlike. The playground is very large and the content is complete, children will never tire of it.
The only downside is that the parent-child rooms are all on the second floor, the floor is low, and the room's view is not wide, which is a bit depressing. Also, all the entertainment facilities are located in area A, and it is not very convenient to get from area B to area A.

Breakfast is in the western restaurant on the 5th floor (the hotel is built on the mountain, and the 5th floor is the ground floor) from 7 am to 10 am, the dishes are very good, especially the grapefruit juice.
Dine in the restaurant at noon, the chef is good at cooking, the fish head is very fresh, (you can use the fish head roll presented at the front desk for 100 yuan) three dishes are about 300 more cost-effective, the dinner is eaten at the barbeque of the group owner on the fish street (recommended Treasure in the palm).
The oversized bathtub made me sweat, and the scenery outside the window was broad and comfortable.
Air conditioning and wifi are also excellent. Because I can’t get up, I don’t have time to do hotel cruises and see the peacocks in the afternoon.
Very satisfied. Next time I go to nearby for vacation or business, I will definitely choose this place.

It is recommended to drive by yourself, otherwise travel is a problem and it is too far to go out for a meal.

msg:When I decided to open the Garden Hotel, I was a little worried. I was afraid that the hotel would be too old and the experience would be bad. It turns out that worrying is completely unnecessary. Before going out, guest director Yang Chen called and added a WeChat reminder of various things to note when going out. After arriving at the hotel, he received all the way and gave the children a small gift with hairpins. The two-bedroom suite was set for Sensenbobo, which proved to be very worthwhile. There is a small yard outside each room, and then there is a swing. Peacocks often walk by outside the yard, which is a perfect experience for children. In addition, I still want to praise the beauty of Yang Chen’s service. There are regular reminders and condolences every day. There is also a small snack yogurt for the evening. Before leaving, the hall also prepares snacks for the baby on the road. Kaiyuan’s parents and children are doing very well. I will make an appoin**ent next time at Kaiyuan Hotel! ps, the buffet is also very good, there are many types of breakfast, and most of the hotels are overwhelmed

After the number of people, the booked family suite will be upgraded to a VIP suite for free, so that we have a better staying experience! Special thanks to Liu Meitong for his warm and thoughtful service! The hotel’s Chinese restaurant Ningxiangyuan is also very cost-effective. You can taste authentic Chun’an local specialties without leaving home. [强] BTW I accidentally discovered that the hotel’s toiletries are produced in the same factory as our company’s current imports. It’s the same brand, so kind [let me see]

msg:I took my mom and dad out to play, first of all praise the service is really good, very caring, although the price of National Day is much higher, but after two days of staying, I gave afternoon tea, and I also gave two days of fruit, which are all fresh and hygienic. It was very clean, there were people coming to sing on National Day two days, the a**osphere was also very good, the hotel was also very beautiful, and the pictures were good.
The only drawback is that we are given a special barrier-free room, judging from the toilet, it is very large and has barrier-free facilities. I think this kind of room should be arranged for special people. For example, people who are not convenient for wheelchairs should not be given to us. But because the National Day staff are very busy, there is no trouble changing rooms. This is a small suggestion, I hope it will be arranged properly in the future. Everything else is quite satisfactory.

The indoor pool and children’s play area are on the first floor. Children are reluctant to go back after playing😀

msg:Check-in: On holidays, the flow of people is relatively large. When checking in, the front desk is a bit messy, but fortunately there is a dedicated channel for members. It can be understood that the room cannot be upgraded because the room is full. Although the room type allocated is relatively poor, it is an old hotel. It's still relatively clean and bright. There is a shortcoming. The bathtub and shower room of this room type are not separated, which reminds me of the heart-puzzling dominated by B&Bs in Europe. I have a cleanliness habit in this area. I should ask about it next time I book a room.
Details: The housekeeping depar**ent can respond to the needs of children’s bathrobes at the first time. On holidays, this is particularly good. Manager Qiuxia helped deliver the luggage to the room, gave the playground project redemption vouchers, and the members’ cakes on the first night. In the second night, I sent yogurt and cookies, and a box of Mid-Autumn Mooncakes 🥮 for the holidays, which is very in place. There is also a little golden bull. Families with children have the same experience. The hotel can have many shortcomings, but As long as the children are happy, nothing else matters.
Auxiliary facilities: countless times in Qiandao Lake every year, as a parent-child hotel, all kinds of facilities, indoor swimming pool [said it is 27 degrees, but it is really cold, I can not resist a person who is used to two kilometers a week, the children’s pool is It’s really warm and nice], the outdoor swimming pool is also very ok, the opening hours are reasonable, and there are artificial sand pools around, quite a lot of people take wedding photos. There is a small park, swings, hammocks, near the RV camp, you can stroll around. Did not go to see the little animals, the children were a bit busy. The playground is huge, with free and self-funded items, enough for fun.
Eat: I ate the buffet on the first night. The ranking in Qiandao Lake is quite high. The price is good. There are various seafood fresh from the lake [Macro prawns, Pippi prawns, crabs, lobsters, swimming crabs]. They are small but live. Yes, it can be seen that the hotel is still more sincere in doing this. It’s okay to order food in the Chinese restaurant, and the gold card can get a 12% discount. The breakfast in the western restaurant is quite rich in variety. The disadvantage is that the two days are exactly the same. At any rate, I learn from Southeast Asian hotels and change the variety. There are too many people on holiday and there is nowhere to go. The two-day wedding banquet had little impact on the in-house customers.

I still like hotels where all the projects are concentrated. It saves a lot of steps. Some hotels are very big. Going to a guest room is like walking. On vacation, why bother to be too tired. Satisfied, will recommend to friends and second brush.

🧹Hygienic: The room has complete facilities and good hygiene. The room is spacious and bright. Although the decoration is not new, the living is very comfortable.

🔔Service: There are foreign resort fans, our guest service manager Liu Ying will accompany you throughout the stay and introduce hotel facilities. Mooncakes were delivered the night before the Mid-Autumn Festival. We will contact WeChat every day if you need help, consultation, etc., the service is special good.

I also gave some suggestions, but it is still full of five points: 1. Although there are many varieties of buffets and breakfasts in western restaurants, the quality is average, and I hope to strengthen them. 2. If it is really a resort, I hope to provide a welcome drink when checking in. The services and facilities provided in the indoor and outdoor pool areas also need to be strengthened. It's nothing. It's actually pretty good. I am very happy to live in Qiandao Lake this time. If I come next time, I will come to Kaiyuan.

msg:The hotel has a lot of facilities for children to play. The children are very happy to play in the hotel from morning to night. To be honest, I was more worried about the crowded holiday vacation before I went, but after I went, the hotel provided a lot of services, which was more worry-free. After staying in, the hotel's customer service manager Liu also took the initiative to care and gave a thumbs up. The breakfast is a bit crowded, but for two days, children can’t get up and are allowed to pack back to the guest room, which is more humane. The dishes of the lunch and dinner Chinese restaurant are unique, and they definitely reach the excellent level of the same-level restaurants in Shanghai. It is also worth mentioning that few star-rated hotels can provide facilities for self-drying clothes on the balcony of guest rooms, but children’s clothes are easy to get dirty and need to be changed frequently. This is a good one. Recommended for parents who take their children to Qiandao Lake for vacation

The location of the hotel is very good, the scenery is great for walking around the lake, and the waiter Luo Peipei has to stack up the cute bed decorations every time he returns to the room. There are also small snacks in the evening. The baby likes this sister very much. I rarely comment, haha, I am really attentive, and a waiter asks for directions to take us directly to the location. It is a very happy experience. I will come next time, ^_^^_^.

We are two big and three small staying in the hotel, the front desk carefully arranged, upgraded the parent-child room, Miss Zhang Yuqing brought us luggage, gave us a playground experience coupon, bicycle ride coupon (must be two big and one small to ride, so We did not ride in the end and replaced it with game coupons) and gave each child a lollipop 🍭! Make the children happy! The room service is also very attentive. Sister Yu and Sister Liu tidied up and replaced the small wooden horses in time, tidyed up the room, and gave each child a car and gave her sister some beautiful hairpins! The child likes the high and low beds in the room very much. There is a swing in the yard! We checked in at 12 o'clock and rested in the room for a while, and then took the children to the outdoor swimming pool. The water in the children's play area was only knees deep, so we didn't worry about drowning at all. There was a naughty castle slide in the middle, and we couldn't stop playing! There is a slope on the side, there is a swing, you can enjoy the scenery while swinging on the swing! You can also get close to the peacock! At night, I went to the indoor playground and swimming pool on the first floor, but I couldn't stop playing. I only went to bed after 11 o'clock! The breakfast on the second day was also very rich, with good service. Before leaving, Aunt Ye also delivered bread, fruit and yogurt!


In short, after staying for one night, the children were reluctant to leave happily! The scenery of Qiandao Lake is also beautiful! In fact, they only have water games, have partners, simple, stay in a hotel, and take care of the whole journey, which is also a pretty good choice!

msg:The 4 days and 3 nights of Qiandao Lake tour ended successfully. I thought twice before traveling and finally chose Qiandao Lake Kaiyuan Resort. It proved that I was very wise
We ordered a room with a high and low bed and a double bed. The room was on the second floor and there was a rocking chair. It was quite comfortable to live in. On the day of check-in, it was already 13:30. The Chinese restaurant stopped ordering after the guest director Zhang Yuqing learned about it. I immediately gave us afternoon tea vouchers and gave the children 2 exchange vouchers for Happy City, which made us instantly full of blood and resurrected. The room is relatively clean and the activity space is relatively large. The key is that the peacock will walk by from time to time for a walk during the stay. Director Zhang Yuqing I will always ask about any needs when I finally left the store and gave us small snacks and Qiandao Lake specialties. The most important thing is that there are beautiful peacock feathers. The whole trip was very happy. The kid said that he didn't want to go back and said that he would bring it later. Her little friend also came to live

The hotel's staff service is still quite positive, with a five-star standard, and guests will also greet in different ways when they see it, which is more friendly. The employees of this hotel have a strong overall marketing awareness: the staff at the front desk are very patient when checking in, and basically get a satisfactory answer to all the questions (we registered as a member on the same day, and we upgraded to the central river view room); the staff in the concierge depar**ent They are all very positive (Guest Relations Director named Zhang Yuqing, and I visited and gave gifts on the day of check-out); the service staff in my room delivered fruits and children’s toiletries every day, and wrote a welcome message (Yu Haixia, Cheng Hongjuan) ), the customer service is very good; even the service staff at the 1F Children’s Play Center are also very marketing conscious. I hope we will give a good comment on Ctrip after we leave the store-my daughter’s glasses fell there the night before, the next day There was no damage, so we must be able to do this; the guys by the pool are all nice, very patient and responsible. To do a hotel lies in the staff's sense of service, facilities and equipment will be depreciated, but people's sense of service will not; a strong sense of service is actually an improvement in people's hearts, and this is precious. It’s been quite pleasant these days in the hotel (Also: 1. The square grates in the children’s pool are best checked, I remember one is easy to put on your feet; 2. Dear friends, don’t listen to the driver when you take a taxi in Qiandao Lake. Random recommendation, you have to judge for yourself, otherwise you will definitely regret it)

We booked 3 rooms for 4 days and 3 nights. Li Rumeng, the front desk foreman, thoughtfully arranged for our family members to be on the 5th floor, including the upgrade to the Qiandao Lake suite.

Ms. Zhang Yuqing, the guest relations director who received us, is kind and kind and gave us a lot of help. Thank you very much. There are also waiters Yu Haixia and Tan Yingying, who will send small surprises to the children every night. The free-range peacocks in the hotel will inadvertently appear in front of you, very amazing. The peacock's nest is in Zone B, and the early morning call is a bit loud. If you mind, you can choose to live in Zone A, but you can see the surprise of the peacock when you open the curtains. There are discounts on the buffet dinner for in-house guests, more than 100 yuan for seafood, crayfish, beef and lamb chops, which is quite cost-effective. The holiday life for a few days is comfortable and short. Thank all the service staff for their dedication. I will definitely come again next time I have the opportunity. Thank you.

Disadvantages: There is no snack area in the hotel, and no late-night snacks, but takeaways are available. It is a long distance from the hotel lobby to the entrance of the resort, which means it is more convenient to drive by yourself.
Others: I booked a lake-view room with a lake view, and a Sensenbopo family room booked by a friend. If you have children, you must settle down. The corridors and interior layouts in the area where the room is located are very childlike, and there are gear toys on the walls. There are high and low beds and a large bed in the room. There is a courtyard where you can make tea for leisure. Sitting in the courtyard you can see the peacocks.

The hotel has free-range peacocks, several captive lambs and pheasants, and a small artificial beach. It is a bit of an illusion of being in Sanya. The hotel faces the sparkling lake when you go out. There are warm RVs, swings, cranes, and Seeing the sunset is especially suitable for parent-child travel.

There is also a free children’s playground and swimming pool in the hotel. Children can’t play enough in a day. You can walk to the Internet celebrity restaurant from the hotel.

但是總體還是很滿意的 雖然房間的裝修是那種老式五星的風格 但是酒店的服務員都很親切，遇到都會熱情的打招呼
而且酒店的配套還是可以的 萌寵樂園 森森運動場 汽車小鎮 娃整個一個開心
但是晚餐的自助感覺一般，至少我們肯定是沒吃**的，三文魚也不知道是我們去的遲還是怎麼滴，拿完了整個一個不補貨。
如果夏天室外的水上樂園開了，應該還是很不錯的，有機會再來。

哈哈
首先人少升級了高級湖景房，風景賊好！
然後自助餐趕上了活動價！
另外在汽車小鎮感受到了忘憂的善意，小朋友體驗到了遊戲的樂趣，拿到了小獎品，非常開心！！
最後一天的旅拍體驗也很不錯，拍了美美的馬面裙照片，化粧的小姐姐和選片的小哥哥都很温柔。
最後，酒店的笑笑管家一直温馨提醒就餐等事項，很貼心。
總之，很開心很完美的旅程。安安爸爸説以後每年來一次！！！哈哈

不是最新的，但很乾凈。且從親子角度和酒店服務

始，因為家人腿腳不便，免費升級了房型。入住
後
管家格格貼心服務，孩子身體不適，管家格格
更是無微不至的照顧，自己想辦法幫助我們解決難
題。驅蚊水超量沒帶上高鐵，格格知道後主動提供
驅蚊水和手環。孩子身體不舒服吃不下飯，房間裏
的粥涼了，格格想辦法幫我們加熱。有快遞要寄，
管家格格主動幫我們寄。回程時，還特地送了大禮
包，適合孩子。客房服務的樑阿姨，非常貼心和熱情，給娃準備了玩具，水果和酸奶，孩子很喜歡。酒店餐廳裏的阿姨，看到孩子不舒服，主動來關心，還提議帶點餐廳食物回房間備着給孩子吃。酒店的萌寵樂園，森森運動場，汽車小鎮，非常適合小朋友，也很方便，服務員也很友善。一天窩在酒店不出門也覺得時間不夠孩子玩。而且細節到位，走在酒店的任何地方，你都能感受到酒店服務的温暖，賓至如歸就是這個感覺吧。下次來千島湖，一定還住這家酒店。

msg:十分滿意的一次出行，酒店的位置很好，面向千島湖，雖然我們的親子房在二樓，被外面的樹木遮擋不能直接看到湖景，但不影響我們往左右兩邊遠眺啊，再不濟每天早上三衹孔雀就在房間的小庭院外面長久駐足也夠讓人心情愉悦的了，拿了頭一天在萌寵樂園買的孔雀糧（幹玉米粒）餵它們，足足呆了半個多小時，還從沒有過這麼好的福利。酒店配套的萌寵樂園和森森運動場小朋友玩到不想走，光是在酒店遛娃都夠了。關鍵是性價比高，小馬小羊還有羊駝，兔子梅花鹿都在地上隨便走，近距離接觸體驗感極好，比動物園還過癮。酒店房間設施齊全，像我這麼挑剔的人也沒覺得哪裡不方便，所有服務人員態度極好，有求必應。辦好入住就配備了一名管家木木全程服務，每天早上詢問是否有需要幫助，我這習慣了自助的人還有點不適應。入住和離店木木都貼心地送了小禮物，真是太客氣了。不滿一米二的小朋友自助早餐免費，對親子酒店來説實在太難得了，我去了那麼多親子酒店，很少有給免費的（順便鄙視一下廣東的某隆，一份小童早餐168，吃相太難看。還是我們大浙江好啊）

BOBO萌寵樂園:散養的動物，小朋友都很開心！
森森運動場體驗:室外遊樂園，適合小朋友消耗體力。總體來説酒店還是比較適合遛娃的，小朋友們都很開心🥳

前台的服務人員態度親切，辦理入住手續非常迅速，還貼心地為我介紹了周邊的景點和酒店的服務設施。房間寬敞明亮，設施一應俱全，從柔軟的床鋪到精緻的洗浴用品，都透露出開元酒店的品質與用心。
而這次入住最讓我印象深刻的，莫過於酒店提供的管家服務。我的管家名叫旦旦，他是一位非常熱心且專業的服務人員。從入住開始，旦旦就全程跟進，耐心解答了我關於酒店服務和周邊旅遊的各種問題。他的服務態度讓我感受到了家一般的温暖和舒適。
此外，旦旦還為我推薦了千島湖的一些必遊景點，讓我在旅行中省去了很多摸索和選擇的時間。他的推薦都非常實用和準確，讓我能夠充分享受到這次旅行的樂趣。
總的來説，千島湖開元酒店給我留下了非常深刻的印象。無論是從酒店的硬件設施、服務質量還是管家服務的專業性和熱情度來看，都堪稱一流。特別是我的管家旦旦，他的服務讓我感受到了家一般的温暖和舒適。我相信，無論是商務出差還是休閑度假，選擇千島湖開元酒店都是一個非常不錯的選擇。

服務：酒店的服務真是沒得説，每位工作人員都主動打招呼，笑臉相迎，真是有種賓至如歸的感覺，而且酒店為每位客人都準備了管家服務，我們的管家漂亮小姐姐旦旦，每天都會短訊詢問，有沒有什麼需要，真是無微不至。遇到問題，打電話都是馬上解決。


設施：親子酒店這方面真是做得相當好，房間不僅配備小朋友的拖鞋，浴袍，浴巾，牙具，還有墊腳凳。第一天入住的親子套房，已經足夠大。第二天入住的雙卧更是大的沒得説。每天還提供免費的水果，mini bar，還有退房時還貼心的送了路上的小零食，真是太周到了。唯一不足就是房間的空調和電視遙控有些老舊會出些小問題。

對於小朋友來説，最愛的還是酒店的親子設施，汽車小鎮，萌寵樂園，森森運動場，沙灘，滿足所有小朋友的需求，小朋友玩得都不想離開，目前水上樂園還沒開放。

還要提的是裏面的中餐館，味道很好，價格不貴。

不足的就是地下停車場管理有待加強。總體來説，真是一次非常滿意的出行，期待下次再來。

msg:這次的千島湖之旅對於酒店這方面還是很滿意的。定的三天兩晚的旅程，週五晚上快十點才到酒店，從開車到酒店大堂門口開始就感覺到酒店的服務是一級棒，大叔很熱情有禮的詢問指路，幫助我們快速停好車，登記入住的時候也非常熱情，登記完專人小管家可可小姐姐帶着去客房，還幫忙拿行李，介紹酒店設施，我們帶着小朋友還多跑一趟幫我們去拿小朋友的洗漱用品，人美心善又温柔ʚ（◜𖥦◝ ）ɞ小朋友刷牙的時候打破一個玻璃杯，也是立刻通知客房阿姨來打掃，聯動服務做得很及時。幫我們打掃房間的童劍英阿姨服務也很好，還幫忙佈置房間，手寫小卡片，晚上送酸奶小餅乾，用過的毛巾拖鞋在第二天全部都會換新補充好，非常贊👍遊樂場的小姐姐人也超好，小朋友不會開小汽車總是出界，她都非常有耐心的幫忙推車、教學。
環境：酒店環境就更不用説了，三面環湖的半島，拍照很出片，而且酒店還有自己的遊艇可以租，萌寵樂園送的飼料也很足，不會因為是送的就摳摳搜搜，小動物很親人，可以摸。總之是非常棒的體驗，下次如果還來肯定是首選。

從千島湖洲際降級到開元原本是有點不開心的，但開元的體驗着實不錯，下次會再考慮。

訂的是親子家庭房，沒注意不是在主樓，到了之後前台主動給免費升級到了主樓的雙卧套房，雖然裝修風格略顯老套但房間設施和衞生情況還是很可的。房間的大落地窗外面常常棲息着一衹孔雀，小朋友看得很開心。

管家洋洋服務很好，主動提供度假村內寶寶玩樂訊息，還送了萌寵樂園的飼料券，離店的時候安排延遲退房也很爽快，好評。還有一位打掃衞生的阿姨也很熱情，可惜我忘了名字。

早餐比較一般，靠窗位置景緻蠻好的。萌寵樂園很有趣，看得出來日常維護得不錯，小動物們挺乾淨的，種類也算多，小朋友餵食非常開心；汽車主題遊樂場需要額外付費，門市價也太貴了，還好有三進三出一大一小團購價，也算值得一玩。逢下雨無法户外體驗更多，雨中看千島湖別有一番味道，期待下次再見。

欽此。

服務：這一塊很明顯能感受到酒店的用力了，基本上視線對上的工作人員都會微笑，客房打掃的童阿姨開夜床的時候疊了一衹小兔子，還會主動來問是否需要什麼。賓客關係的圓圓在住店期間提供了很多幫助，CO之後還協助開了發票。

BOBO萌寵樂園:小朋友比較喜歡，羊駝、矮馬，鳥，兔子等，單份飼料20元，如果買2種飼料30元。
汽車小鎮：正好有活動，99元一大一小，可以當日進出3次，場地不小，寶寶還蠻喜歡的。

酒店小動物也很有趣，孩子樂此不疲！

2.辦理入住時主動幫忙升級了房間，管家西西很熱情，幫我們拿行李並指引方向送我們到房間，還送了瓶紅酒...知道我們要去中餐廳吃飯，還主動幫忙申請了一張100元的優惠券可以喝千島湖的魚頭湯。在這裏要特別表揚一下西西，這裏的魚頭湯真的好好喝哦，就是價格有點小貴，用完券還要小三百，不過也值了！
3.酒店衞生做得不錯，房間收拾得乾乾淨淨的，讓我住的很舒服。非常感謝酒店保潔阿姨的辛苦付出，出門在外，我住酒店最看重的就是房間的衞生和床品了，這次我很滿意，後來又續住了2個晚上。
退房時前台小姐姐還主動送了水和小點心讓路上吃，很是貼心？

我是團購的攜程三天兩晚兩正餐的房券個人覺得性價比非常的好！
第一天入住送了我們兩瓶紅酒，剛好就拿來住店幾天喝掉。入住的時候客服經理洋洋很貼心贈送了兩張萌寵樂園的飼料券（如果買的話要20一份，建議可以選狗糧和火腿腸，喂浣熊太好玩了），知道我們娃週日生日，還送了沙灘小玩具和生日佈置還有生日蛋糕。
第二天等我們出去吃飯慶祝的時候，酒店就幫忙做了生日佈置，回來以後就能看到驚喜，簡單但是很用心，孩子也很高興
基本上每天晚上客房的童劍英阿姨也會幫忙送來
水果點心，橘子香蕉品質都很好，也有小餅乾或者酸奶，這個服務真的已經pk掉很多同價位的酒店了。
如果待改進主要是裝修和空調，稍微陳舊了一些，但是瑕不掩瑜，對於帶娃家庭，説實話孩子沒那麼在意，玩的開心就好。

2.酒店親子配套豐富，有小童室外和室內樂園、萌寵樂園，孔雀在整個度假村到處自由溜達，還可以近距離體驗喂梅花鹿、喂小浣熊，小朋友非常喜歡，樂此不疲。
3.酒店工作人員服務熱情自然。我的管家洋洋全程笑眯眯的，很可愛，幫忙協調房間、幫忙哄小朋友，特別貼心。房間的打掃人員樑阿姨也很厲害，還用玫瑰給我們擺了愛心，對我們要用的寢具也有求必應，反應迅速。為他們點贊！

電瓶車大堂到山下的接送非常方便，阿雅貼心以及細緻的服務也讓人很暖心。
中餐廳的魚頭味道也非常不錯。
除了房間裏有大螞蟻以及整體設施因為時間關係偏舊了一點之外，親子游必選！

msg:千島湖第一批的五星酒店，對於現在來説，酒店設施可能確實比較老舊，但看得出來，酒店有很用心的在維護，而且所有的酒店服務人員服務都很好，第一天入住的別墅套房衞生間存在漏水，酒店立馬給換了房間，並且第二天主動聯繫給了補償，非常周到。小朋友玩的一應俱全，森森運動場、萌寵樂園、游泳池、幻想島輪番來，三天兩晚幾乎沒出過酒店，萌寵樂園裡的小兔子是可以送到房間的，住了這麼多的親子酒店，第一次遇到可以送小動物到房間。
酒店的中餐廳味道也不錯，吃了兩頓，服務也很好，特別表揚一位小哥哥，忘記名字了，瘦瘦的不高，非常有眼力見，顧客有任何需要都能第一時間滿足。
是可以二刷的酒店。

1、不管是酒店大堂、前台、餐廳、汽車小鎮、萌寵樂園，遇到的所有工作人員都非常親和友善；管家阿雅和客房樑阿姨實名錶揚；
2、一定要預約小浣熊互動和小兔子送房間兩個活動，是在別的酒店沒有的活動，小朋友超愛；
3、汽車小鎮裏適合大中小朋友年齡的繪本很多，給家長看的書籍也有，這點很好

缺點（不一定是缺點，衹是和預期有差距，至少和開元森泊比的差距）
1、早餐自助種類比較少；晚餐在中餐館，剁椒魚頭原價398，用掉100券後298，性價比低；
2、游泳池水冰涼；
3、4樓的豪華湖景大床房，樹木遮擋的比較多，衹能看到不多點的湖景，不是一大片敞亮的湖景，略失望；房間沒有小童馬桶坐墊、沒有洗頭擋水帽

很推薦！

有些酒店住完能記得乾淨就不錯了，不過這家酒店能記得住的點就挺多的


服務：
辦理入住就有一位很漂亮的小姑娘當我們的管家，萊負責我們入住的所有事，我們的管家是【洋洋】，很nice的姑娘，會很細緻耐心地把整個流程還有各種注意事項跟我們交代明白，然後幫我們拿着行李帶去房間，期間加了微信，任何時候有事微信詢問都是秒回，還會主動介紹不少福利，幫顧客考慮，屬實可以説做到以客户為中心了，非常貼心，【管家洋洋】好評，建議加工資～


設施：
第二個就是配套，室內泳池、健身房、小朋友活動區都很不錯，管理也到位，服務態度沒得説～


BOBO萌寵樂園:
這兩個合在一起説吧，開元算是把做酒店給玩明白了，綁住小孩子，就可以搞定一家人，就在酒店內部有動物園和小朋友的遊樂場，完全可以做到不出酒店豐富暢玩，小朋友還抱了小兔子，餵了小浣熊，體驗非常好～

這次冬天來，室外的有些場所還玩不了，夏天的話體驗估計還能plus～

整體很不錯啦～

親子設施齊全，三天兩夜感覺都不夠孩子玩的。
景觀也很好，中心湖區的日落太棒了，都不用去什麼天嶼山，雖然也就是在旁邊。
服務十分細緻入微，都想在了客人的前面。
登記入住就加了管家微信，酒店設施服務時間，還有服務內容都發給了客人，還為小朋友準備夜間鮮奶，還有每天的水果都是送到房間。臨走了還為客人準備零食禮包，吃的喝的滿滿一袋。
謝謝阿雅，讓我們感受到了賓至如歸。
酒店真的很棒，會推薦給朋友的。

msg:第一次入住開元酒店，簡直體驗感太好了，雖然千島湖很冷，但在酒店裡玩都可以待足兩天，有很美的湖景（雖然加床費很高），有超可愛的小動物，有晚安牛奶。最最最要説的是服務熱情周到，管家洋洋小美女（笑起來超美）送我們到房間，送我們魚頭劵，臨走還給了我們一兜子好吃的；客房部的童劍英姐姐每天等我們回來都會送來熱牛奶和小點心（牛奶很好喝）；開電瓶車的李師傅聽説我們要走路去天嶼山，特意告訴我們當地人走的一條沿湖路，風景簡直絕了：還有我叫不上名字的所有為我們服務的工作人員，比如餐廳的一位男士介紹騎行道，比如汽車樂園一位有小辮子的男生教我們用機器人，比如喂小馬的師傅送了我們孔雀掉下來的羽毛，還有每天送我們氣球恐龍的人等等等等，太多了，這次的旅行，因為這些人讓我在這麼冷的千島湖感受了温暖！謝謝你們啦

msg:全家來千島湖過週末，沒想過上島玩，所以還是選擇了能遛娃的開元度假村。工作人員都很熱情，謝謝當天的經理看我帶着長者孩子，幫我做了房間升級，這樣能更寬敞。剛好遇到了下雪，雖然有點冷，但孩子們熱衷和小動物互動，汽車小鎮更是還沒開門就等着，晚上玩到關門。特別要感謝管家雯雯小姐姐，人美工作也很到位，項目介紹的很清楚，有問題也隨時幫助解決。
唯一想説的就是，廁所的換氣設施如果能改善一下就好了。畢竟酒店比較老了，重新裝修不太可能，換氣系統換換還是能實現的吧😂

服務是很好的，印象深刻的是客房服務苗阿姨，人很親切，幫忙整理嬰兒床的動作很利索，還有前台雯雯，把我落下的寶寶枕頭免費寄回了～贊！

msg:老了的千島湖開元
自從開了bobo萌寵樂園
森森運動場
幻想島汽車小鎮後
除了房間還是太老了點/早餐店差了點
其他還是值得擁有的

先説好的
1.晚上入住管家依依送到房間，很熱情，還給小朋友準備了小禮物。微信上發消息也有求必應
2.客房阿姨樑阿姨很熱情，會貼心送上牛奶
3.圍爐煮茶這邊的小哥哥不知道名字，但是特別熱情特別好！我們是12.31去的圍爐煮茶
4.萌寵樂園很有的逛，我們連去了三天，小浣熊實在太萌了。工作人員回提醒大家小心手

再説不足
1.房間還是太老了，浴缸雖然是裝修過的，但是洗澡頭髮還是貴積水，這點真的不喜歡。
2.早餐廳是敗筆。住了三晚，前兩天都是9:50煎餅就開始收攤了，不讓吃了，理由是沒有“漿”了。。那知道大客流你就不能多備點？？？
3.今天早餐廳人爆滿，裏面沒位置，外面還在放人。工作人員不管裏面飽和，就在不停的讓後面的人湧入。其他開元不是這樣的。。。

最後想感歎一句，我很喜歡開元，但是這家是我住過所有開元裏要好評最多的一家。其實很反感！感覺好了自然就給你好評了，碰到了很多很多工作人員要好評，其實我們消費者選酒店除了會看好評也會看差評的，這樣討要好評大大的沒必要。

msg:設施：雖然有些年數了，但是總體保養的不錯。
衞生：房間乾淨整潔，負責衞生的阿姨幹活也很麻利
環境：熱帶度假村風格，自帶的萌寵樂園和森森運動園太適合小朋友了，在裏面玩一個下午完全沒有問題。
服務：第一次住親子酒店，對孩子方面的服務確實比一般酒店周到得多。入住時前台小哥幫我升級了朝南的湖景房，景色如圖！
還幫我安排了管家依依-Zoey，對小朋友超級熱情，一見面就送了個小禮物，孩子很喜歡。住店期間有問題直接聯繫依依-Zoey就行，她都會及時回覆。退房時還特意準備了一份禮物，真的是非常意外。

總體來説從入住到退房都非常不錯，開元系的服務質量確實一如既往的在線！！

入住後每天樑雪慶阿姨又送水果又送酸奶，飲用水也及時補充，稱得上酒店業的海底撈服務。
酒店的遊樂設施齊全，汽車小鎮，户外樂園，動物園，還有室內游泳池可以讓娃從早玩到玩，三天兩晚玩不夠。有機會一定再來。

首先點名表揚管家洋洋，很可愛的小姑娘。我一個人帶孩子辦入住，有點兒騰不開手，洋洋第一時間出現後馬上給寶寶送了小禮物安撫，後來聽説寶寶喜歡小動物又送了萌寵樂園餵養券。倒不是説因為送東西所以才好，而是她能及時發現客人需求並且給出有效反饋，這是對客人的用心和重視，是客人能感受到的。入住的四天裏，每天洋洋都按時問候，主動詢問需求，及時告知室外活動區域的開放情況，給我的整個行程帶來了安心舒適的體驗，非常感謝！

然後感謝前台方素珍，非常專業的一位前台。我這趟千島湖來的很倉促，酒店定的也很倉促，分了好幾個訂單，用了不同的優惠，我自己都不太明白定了些什麼。小方非常耐心和專業的給我梳理訂單、告知套餐內容、升房，還及時給我預約了兩天的晚餐。效率高，態度好，全程微笑提供服務，第一時間感覺到了開元對員工培訓的專業，我很滿意。

最後感謝房間服務員侯佳慧，一進房間佈置了擺床的小熊，第一晚手寫歡迎並且準備了酸奶，我後來感冒了喝水多，每天都給我六瓶水，感謝。還有個服務員我不知道名字，10日入住以後覺得空調不熱，找服務員來看，是個圓臉女生，她一方面給我找了工程來看空調，一方面同時給我拿了個暖風機，非常貼心，完全照顧到了我的需求，很專業，感謝。

服務是我會再次選擇開元的理由，感謝遇到的所有工作人員！
