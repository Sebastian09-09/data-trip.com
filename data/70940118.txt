msg:Environment: Very good, by the Jinhai Lake, surrounded by the lake on three sides, close to Shanghai Fish Bubble Park, it is more convenient to drive by yourself, but if you take public transportation, the transportation is slightly inconvenient, and there is no shuttle bus or anything.

Facilities: It can meet the five-star standard, equipped with a capsule coffee machine; the deep bathtub is large and comfortable, the sea salt is good and has a faint lavender scent; the soap is divided into cleansing soap and bath soap, unexpected details are praised, and the sewing kit looks very complete. The shortcomings are that the washlet has no drying function, and the hair dryer is not Dyson, haha, I didn’t expect it, oh, by the way, there is no scrubbing towel, um~

Hygiene: It’s clean, there’s nothing much to say.

Service: Meets the standard, answers all questions, and smiles. All the staff you see walking in the hotel will take the initiative to smile and say hello.

Meals: Breakfast must be praised. The local characteristics of Fengxian mutton noodles, small wontons, the normal porridge, British food, and the unexpected Hong Kong-style seafood porridge and beef porridge; Japanese miso soup and oden; there are even Benedict eggs!!! Unexpected! Must give full marks to the variety!

Executive Lounge: Afternoon tea quality is not good, dinner is good and quite rich, especially the seafood porridge and pork ribs fungus soup, which are really fresh. The cheesecake and Hokkaido cake are also delicious. The drinks in happy hour are also very addictive, the cheese cold cut platter is paired with small old wine, which is very comfortable. The service in the executive lounge is very good, and it really feels like home.

In general, you get what you pay for, and the stay is OK, quite comfortable~

msg:The worst JW I've ever stayed in, bar none.

I checked into room 1079 first, and found that there was a strange noise in the bathroom. I waited for 20 minutes but no one came to see me. Finally, the manager came to help me change the room. I said I wanted to change to a higher room facing the lake, but I was changed to room 3059, which was exactly the same as the original location, but two floors higher.

The next day, I bought a contact lens and sent it to the front desk, hoping that the front desk would help deliver it. As a result, I waited for half an hour and called three times, and they said they were delivering it. The last time I called, I wanted to ask where it was delivered. If it wasn't delivered, I would go get it myself and not wait any longer. In the end, they still fooled me and said they were delivering it and waited. Finally, I went downstairs and found that the things were still on the takeaway table. They were not delivering it as they said. Several waiters in suits on the first floor were either playing with their phones or being in a daze. It is recommended to adjust the surveillance to see how these people are slacking off.

Hygiene: The gutters are still not wiped clean

Environment: The layout of their Chinese restaurant is okay~ I think the layout of the buffet is a bit messy~, and the layout of the breakfast is also a bunch here and there~ It’s not very convenient to get things
Taste: The food in the Chinese restaurant tastes pretty good. The executive restaurant has a little less choice. For the pancakes and fruits in the breakfast buffet, you should let them make it the way you like, otherwise it will be too salty and not delicious.

Service: The overall service is good~ However, the service in the Chinese restaurant needs to be improved~ The serving speed is also very slow~ It is said that it is slow because there is a wedding banquet~ So it is still the off-season~ What should I do in the peak season~ I have to keep up with the progress and be worthy of the meal~

This area of ​​Fengxian is still under development~ We happened to be going to the Big Boat Hotel for a wedding reception~ So we came to stay in Gumei in advance~ There is a museum five minutes away~ The art of paper has recently been displayed~ It's pretty good

From the front desk to the reception, from the floor to the restaurant, they all provide proactive and smiling service, which is rare in domestic hotels. The hotel is in an excellent location, facing Shanghai, so there are many rooms. They are all picturesque rooms with lake views. The rooms are of suitable size and are suitable for family leisure. The large green space and open park next to the hotel are suitable for setting up tents and flying kites. Together with the cultural feast at Fengxian Museum, it is worth a leisurely two days here. Three days is not a problem! All in all, highly recommended!

On the second day, I was busy preparing the buffet dinner on Saturday, so there was almost no service, and the tea bags were not even brought out. I had dinner with ADD. From the shabby team meal to the passable hot pot, the team environment was too noisy when dining. Most of the services are OK, especially the waitress at the small hot pot buffet who is very patient.

The room hardware is still online, but there are no cotton pads in the care package and there are gaps in the blackout curtains.

The breakfast mutton noodles are special, the grilled bran is good, and there is also freshly squeezed juice co-branded with Vitolin. The last time I had it was at Shangri-La.

The most disappointing thing is that the light array outside Xiangnai's swimming pool has been changed into an outdoor children's swimming pool, which reduces the appearance and can only be used in summer. Inefficient. And more than a year ago, I found that there was no swimsuit dehydrator, and there is still no swimsuit dehydrator this time. It is very inconvenient to carry a wet swimsuit.

I encountered a music and light show on Saturday evening. The scene was not big, but it was still very fun.

The overall experience is good. Some flaws need to be improved.

Nowadays, many hotels will no longer ask you if you want coffee or tea before taking a seat. This hotel will also ask you thoughtfully and has good reviews. All in all, I am quite satisfied with all aspects of the hotel itself! It's just that the whole area of ​​Shanghai Zhiyu makes me feel that it has not been well planned. It has a "a little bit east and a little bit west" feeling. It also lacks green plants, flowers and lake landscape design. It is still worse than the overall design of leisure parks in urban areas. Something interesting. If planned well, it can become a place for leisure and check-in on weekends, which will surely benefit surrounding hotels and consumption.

There is a charge for the small refrigerator in the room😌At least the first round is free.

If you live on the executive floor and just want to fill your stomach, the happy hour in the executive lounge in the evening is quite good. Although it is simple, it has everything you need. Simple hot food, rice, soup, salad, fruit, dessert, alcoholic beverages...

You can rent electric bicycles and bicycles outside the hotel, and you can slowly explore the fish of Shanghai on them.

It takes about 8 minutes to walk to the Fengxian Museum. I took the children to see an exhibition of Chinese characters and cultural relics, which was very good.

The hotel's breakfast... can only be described as average. There is a noodle section, an omelette section, porridge, sausage and bacon section, a salad section, bread, coffee, milk, etc. The categories are very limited.

It can be said that the basic hygiene is very poor. The dusting of the house has not been done for at least a week. I don’t know what the red print on the sofa is. At 6:40 in the morning, the actual condition of the room after being shaded is still a bit hard to take a picture of. I don’t know if it’s the next door or the one next door. We went upstairs and downstairs last night and danced until after 2 o'clock and 6 o'clock in the morning. The noise was so loud that it woke up the children.

The surrounding activities can also be very rich: Fengxian Museum (recently holding a special exhibition of oracle bone inscriptions), my son is very interested in the stamp treasure hunt activity, but unfortunately the city planning museum next to it is not open during the National Day. The Ant Paradise and electric ice-dun-dun cars in Bubble Park are much more cost-effective than the cars in shopping malls.

Although it rained a little on the first day, the air after the rain was particularly fresh. The health condition of the hotel is also very good. The service is very user-friendly, attentive and meticulous. As the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, the hotel also specially presents a moon cake, which feels very heart-warming and truly serves as a "home away from home" for every guest. ￼Will go again in the future.

The room is separated from dry and wet rooms, and the bathroom is a smart toilet, which is very hygienic. Whether it is customer service or the restaurant, the waiters serve with a smile, use polite words, and answer all questions. The hotel has new facilities, good hardware, and a beautiful environment. Opposite is the Fengxian Museum, which is suitable for a quiet leisure vacation. The only shortcoming is the breakfast. Although it is filling, the variety is pitiful and does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel. Based on the existing varieties, the breakfast price of 238 yuan per person feels a bit outrageous! Overall it's pretty good and I'm satisfied.

msg:I specially chose the package with parent-child programs because I wanted to spend a slow weekend. When checking in, I was told that a cleaning fee of 1,000 yuan would be charged. After asking, I was told that the fee is mainly for drinks and snacks in the room, right? Just lock it if you don't need it? This is a bit surprising. This is the first time I have encountered such a situation in a hotel of W Hotel or similar level... It is really below the standard of W Hotel...
When we got to the room, the layout was quite good. The indoor temperature was very good during the day. I don't know if there was a bug in the middle of the night. There was no air supply and air conditioning for a while. There is room for improvement in the details of door hygiene and bed cleanliness.
There are not many varieties of hot food for breakfast, but they are replenished in a timely manner. It would be even more thoughtful if they could continue Five Star's usual practice of asking for tea or coffee service in the morning.
Meijis with babies are most concerned about the parent-child programs provided by the hotel, so they did a physical examination for their reference.
1. Outdoor sand dredging: Register at the SAP Museum and you can rent sand dredging tools and two sand pools. Children won't be crowded together either. The pink sand pool will be stained, so it is recommended to wear slippers or non-slip socks to prevent your feet from being stained.
2. Indoor activity room: It is located behind the sap hall and is air-conditioned and cool. There are relatively few recreational facilities inside. There is a children's sink and a small toilet, but no one for adults. It would be better if there is hand sanitizer that can be replenished in time.
3. Outdoor swimming room: supervised by dedicated personnel. Many children who love water had a lot of fun.
4. Small train: Make a reservation at SAP Hall. One lap takes 7-8 minutes. It can accommodate three families (one large and one small) at a time. It is recommended to consult and make a reservation in advance.
Although I encountered this or that special situation during my stay, in the end the service attitude of the lobby staff and the timeliness in handling the problem are worthy of praise.

This time, Ctrip’s package also includes a buffet dinner, which is not to be missed (friends who work in the catering industry also praised this buffet dinner, saying that it can be ranked among the top five buffet dinners in Shanghai hotels). Great value for money.
What I was most obsessed with by hotels before was their indoor swimming pool, which can be said to be the No.1 swimming pool in Shanghai hotels, absolutely beautiful! The equipment and services are excellent, and the Shanghai uncle who is in charge is also humorous and amiable.
This summer, the hotel has newly opened an outdoor paddling pool and pink sand beach, an outdoor children's playground, and the 24 hours of children's hotel activities are fully arranged. On the afternoon of the check-in day, play outdoors in the water, play with sand, buffet dinner, walk by the lake, watch the water fountain light show, wake up naturally the next day, after a perfect breakfast at the hotel, go to the Fengxian Museum next door to experience the Chinese character exhibition, and swim indoors after returning to the hotel, and play music Odd biscuit experience class, too fulfilling🥰. The claw machine in front of the cake house has a high success rate, so you can experience it.
In particular, I would like to thank Bella and Flora at the front desk of the hotel for their warm care. The child's mother said that every time she came to JW Marriott Hotel Oriental Beauty Valley, she felt very good, and felt at home as soon as she entered the door. I give 100 points for the hardware of the hotel, and 200 points for your service, which makes us feel warm and happy at home!
Ok, see you next time 🌹🌹🌹

I chose a lake view room, with a super large lake view angle, it is very beautiful when the lights are on at night, and it is very enjoyable to watch! It takes five minutes to walk to Fengxian Museum and "Shanghai Fish" where Internet celebrities check in.
If you want to relax on weekends, it is indeed the first choice for a family vacation.

It is adjacent to Fengxian Museum and Line 5 is nearby, so the transportation is very convenient. When guests enter the lobby, you will be immediately attracted by the ultra-fashionable and luxurious hall in front of you. Although there are many customers on weekends, the management is orderly and the front desk guide service makes every guest feel at home. The decoration style of the particularly large executive lake view lake and the executive lounge is very high-end and grand. Living in an executive sea view room, sitting on the large balcony, sipping sweet afternoon tea, and looking at Jinhai Lake, it feels like you are in a fairyland on earth. Especially watching the Jinhai Lake Music Fountain on the balcony at night can be called romantic and emotional. In addition, the hotel's executive lounge afternoon tea and snacks are very rich and delicious. The hotel's complete hardware facilities, if it is perfected under the flexible management of breakfast staggering during the peak period of guests' stay, it will definitely become one of the most beautiful super luxury hotels in Shanghai!

Personally, I think the Chinese restaurant is better than the jw kitchen buffet. There are not many types of buffet in the evening, so it’s useless, and I can’t remember what I ate the next day... Let’s have a lively meal with the children. The breakfast is okay, not as little as the legend says, and there are good choices of both Chinese and Western styles.
The Children's Paradise is cute and suitable for young children. It is a bit boring for older children to go around. The outdoor part was not completed during the renovation. The next morning, I saw two sand digging pools outside, one of which was still pink.
Strolling around at night, the wind is not too hot, there are musical fountains, not too many people, overall it is very pleasant.

For breakfast for 238 people, a few pieces of bread were sent away. This service concept is too poor. Other hotels knew that I was feeling uncomfortable, so they also brought over white porridge and chicken soup. I stayed for more than one night and had breakfast. There are so many people in your restaurant, and it’s outrageous for you to tell me that you can’t help deliver food!
Second, the takeout service cannot be delivered to hotels. Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton can provide takeout service. Why should we make a takeout service agreement? Is it to serve customers or to prevent thieves? The food was already cold after taking so long. Outrageous.
Third, there are too many quilts that have not been used, and the air conditioner cannot heat, so the heater can only be used. Predictably cold, so poorly prepared.

msg:Going to Fengxian for vacation, I booked a terrace lake view room with two breakfasts. It took a day after check-out to receive the deposit and was actually deducted 600. . Called to inquire and was told that the deduction was a buffet breakfast for two. . I can only say that the entire hotel process management is extremely unprofessional in the case that the order has already included early, without any communication and confirmation, and there is an extra fee but there is no second verification but the payment is deducted at will! The excuse given was that it was too busy during the holidays. . I have stayed in too many hotels (mostly InterContinental Group) on holidays, and I have never encountered such a low-level mistake. Being busy is really not an excuse, let's improve!

I was disappointed that there was no concierge at the entrance of the hotel lobby. What I saw when I entered the room was a balcony and a small window that I couldn't get out of. Glass windows, this is the actual disappoin**ent of the lake view room. I did feel a little regretful at the time. I was disappointed with the aging of the hotel equipment (both the swimming pool shower room and the room shower room), not to mention the brand, the silicone fell off and no one repaired it. The hotel dinner buffet was completely disappointing. I communicated with the waiter and said there was no lamb chops. He said there was BBQ mutton. There was no steak. He said there was sliced ​​beef. There was no seafood (yellow croaker/pompano). pasta. This was an extremely disappointing hotel experience. I just stayed at the Jiaxing Marriott Hotel a month ago. There is no harm without comparison. No matter from service to catering to stay experience, there is a huge gap.

msg:I can't leave Shanghai on 11th. I can only dig for hotels in the suburbs. The grass grows in the summer vacation, but I think it's too hot to experience it on 11th. It is considered that the price increase among many hotels is acceptable. First of all, the location of the hotel is very good. I know it's very close to Fengbo, but I didn't expect that the view room is so close to Fengbo, so the friends who come to live can book in advance and they can camp within 1 km along the road. If you have a large area, it's still great to go for a ride.
The hotel environment is still very good. After all, it is newly opened, but my friend said that it still smells a little bit, but I didn't smell it. The breakfast is also very rich, but I obviously feel that this time I can't cope with the large number of passengers on 11. There are a lot of breakfasts, but the supplements are too slow during the holidays. Wait for a pancake At the end of half an hour, I said that the fried dough sticks were gone. The vegetables my friend asked for were right next to the pancakes. I looked at the time and it took at least 10 minutes to add probiotics. No one came out to make up. Queue for breakfast
The most cumbersome thing is that the check-in procedure was not able to check in at 3:00. He said that he had to wait in line and was very polite. He said that he would upgrade the room for us. We arrived at 1:00 and got the room at 3:30, then Ctrip paid the room fee and returned to the scene. I paid the room fee plus a deposit of 1000 and deducted a total of 3800 of the deposit I started saying that Ctrip's money will be refunded the next day, and I said it will be refunded to you in full anyway. Anyway, you don't want to do anything about holidays and you can return the money to me, but it's inexplicable. The management of this aspect really needs to be strengthened, and it's not free.
Generally speaking, the body feeling is definitely OK if there are fewer people, but the staff must be doubled on holidays, and parking is also convenient

msg:It's big enough, but because it's new, I think all staff and supporting facilities lack experience in dealing with large passenger flow. The experience of queuing for dinner on National Day is really not very good, but fortunately, the etiquette is good and the complaint training can be resolved quickly. This is a compliment. The environment and planning are very nice, and the children like it very much; if you book a twin-bed garden view room, you will be upgraded directly to a lake view room.
Flaws: As a five-star hotel, the room is small and feels 5 square meters smaller, which directly leads to poor sound insulation. The traffic flow and supporting parking on the lakeside road in Huahai at the entrance should be carefully discussed with the district, town and traffic law enforcement. If there is a parking lot, it should be built, and it should be taken the initiative. Otherwise, it will affect the hotel and residents, and the road is directly blocked during peak hours. If someone has to catch a flight, they will stop eating.

msg:✿Take Houma to see the world✿ series of 🌻Shanghai🍀Magic City Recovery Tour - Hotel Addictive (Part 1) New Life Aesthetics Resort Landmark "Shanghai Oriental Beauty Valley JW Hotel · JW MARRIOTT SHANGHAI FENGXIAN" (restarted this flag So happy)! The hotel is located in the scenic area of "Shanghai Fish" (also known as "Jinhai Lake"·Jinhai Lake, which is the core landscape lake of Fengxian New Town in Fengxian District, Magic Capital). Biyuntian ~ spring water green ~ fragrant grass break ~ leisurely spring breeze ~ spring light ~ blue dyed sky pool like a mirror! This time I booked the "Deluxe Lake View Room", which is definitely a wise choice. The large glass windows of the room are facing the lake view, and the sunset view is unobstructed! Listening to music, drinking wine and admiring the beautiful scenery on the sofa - this is the meaning of vacation!

At present, the hotel's restaurants have been available for dine-in one after another, and reservations are required in advance. We recommend "Yan Xuan" Chinese restaurant. The dishes and ingredients are relatively good, and the dining environment and service are also good. The menu during the YQ period is not as rich as before!

Tips: During the YQ period, a 48-hour nucleic acid test certificate is provided, and you can check in by scanning the venue code, green code, itinerary, etc.; in addition, the hotel provides free nucleic acid testing at a fixed time every day (8:30~9:20 Hotel banquet) hall).

msg:I took my baby to stay for a few days before the school started. The hotel environment is very good, next to Fengxian Museum and Shanghai Fish. Front desk and room service are warm and efficient. Nucleic acid can be made in the underground parking lot, and it is very convenient to eat and order takeout. The room is quite big, but the sewers smell and the air-conditioning pipes are noisy, which really affects sleep. After they were raised, the engineers solved these problems. On the downside, the breakfast is the same every day, no changes at all. Two lights on the edge of the swimming pool are broken, and no one has been repairing them.

But I want to say that hotel guests, included in the price, should not be given priority? Are the guests outside earlier than mine three weeks ago? What kind of guests are these! As a result, I really went to bed at the hotel, I didn't have afternoon tea, and the little train couldn't make an appoin**ent.

It is best to take a walk after dinner to watch it, which is more lively than watching it on the balcony. Breakfast is generally not a lot, but it's okay. Booked a terrace lake view room, the disadvantage is that there are 2 railings outside the room on the first floor, which affects the vision. It is best to look at the 2nd floor or above and feel better. The hotel ba*****t can do nucleic acid every morning, which is very convenient.

The waiter said that because it was summer vacation, there were more than 200 rooms to check out, and more than 100 room to check in. Four people at the front desk checked in together, and they all lined up in long queues. It was Miss Hua who helped us with the formalities and offered me a free upgrade to the lake view room and a breakfast. The swimming pool of the hotel is good. There is a small paddling pool next to it. The warm water is very comfortable. It is suitable for playing with children. The hotel as a whole is very good, the only thing I want to comment on is the light in Figure 3, it is easy to hit the head and it is too low.

2/ It is recommended not to use the 4-seater electric bicycle at the entrance of the hotel. The electric bicycle is 180/hour. However, it can only be used in a small piece at the entrance of the hotel. It is not as good as the hotel train, which is very pitted. When scanning the QR code, the active area is displayed, which is really small.
3/ The hotel swimming pool and buffet dinner during the peak season need to be reserved one day in advance, please be sure to pay attention.
4/ The air-conditioning of the hotel is a bit strange. It is very bright after entering, but it wakes up in the middle of the night, and the temperature is set at 25 degrees.
5/ The overall environment and price do not match. When checking out, my daughter found cookie crumbs on the carpet beside the bed, and there were a lot of dust under the sofa.

The hotel's light show and music are more festive, giving people a bit of the illusion of the Spring Festival. The night view of the hotel is beautiful, but the lights are turned off too early, and they are all turned off at 9 o'clock in the evening. The breakfast is average, the standard of a 4-star hotel.

The hotel is in the middle of the landscape lake. There are various art buildings around the lake. At night, there is a musical fountain. The bridge on the lake is facing the huge moon, which is very close and can not be seen in the urban area. The hotel continues the consistent quality of Marriott, and the service is quite good. Thanks to Manager Xiao Zhao for his warm reception, he also upgraded the lake view room for free. The breakfast is very rich, and the Chinese restaurant in the hotel is eaten for lunch. The quantity is large and the taste is good. The gym swimming pool is very good, you need to make an appoin**ent in advance, and there is a heated children's pool, and the children have a good time. The room is very comfortable, because it is a newly built hotel, the facilities are very new, and the bed is very comfortable. The only downside is that the hotel room still smells. It is recommended to place an air purifier in the hotel room to increase air circulation. The toilet is a little shaken. It is recommended to install it again. Be firm.

The first is the scenery as far as the eye can see. The hotel is surrounded by a lake and clear water, with a beautiful environment. Fengxian Museum is within easy reach. There are also musical fountains and light shows at night.
Secondly, the living experience is very pleasant. The staff greeted them with a smile. Xiao Song at the front desk upgraded the room with a view. The customer service center and the manager on duty were also very enthusiastic. The waiter also sent mosquito repellent. The indoor swimming pool is the favorite of children, and the services are meticulous and thoughtful.
Here is the place to relax and unwind. Will come again next time. May this hotel get better and better!

Both hardware and software are available, and the cleaning aunt is very enthusiastic and greets guests when she sees them. The 3010 lake view room is facing the fountain, the view is good!
The afternoon tea has a five-star standard. The beef dough for the meal in the evening is in a ball, and the soup is gone (108 yuan), which needs to be improved.

After reading the reviews on the Internet, it said that the cleaning of the room was very slow, so I ate first at the Chinese restaurant of the hotel. It was about two o'clock, and the room was fine and spacious. There are only two bottles of water. To call to ask for. The child only has dental equipment, no toilet bag and small bathrobe, which are clearly seen in other comments, I don't know why.
The air conditioner of the swimming pool is a bit cold, you need to make an appoin**ent to enter, but the cabinets and bath towels are always out of stock. Not very understanding. It shouldn't cost much to prepare more towels. . . There are children in the swimming pool with water guns, which is a safety hazard.
No dissatisfaction with other parts, it is very comfortable to walk around the hotel at night

msg:The hotel environment and hardware are not bad, the service is satisfactory, the efficiency is low, and the ability is poor. Here are a few points
1. The swimming pool needs to be reserved before going to the hotel on weekends. Otherwise, it is basically impossible to swim in the hotel swimming pool. Even if the water temperature is very low in summer, it is not suitable for children to enter the water. Finally, I gave me a locker hand card (such as photo 56). After a long time in the locker room, the locker is the largest on the 28th, and then I went to the front desk of the fitness center and asked that it was the 06th. It was a special toss, so it is a good choice to take the children to the swimming pool.
2. The room service is chaotic, and I need a nail clipper. First, I said that it is not a personal item. The hotel can't solve it. Then an experienced person said that I can take a file. Finally, the robot sent it twice and it was sent manually. 5 calls
3. Due to the high season, the hotel room is very slow to be cleaned, and it has not been cleaned at 14:00 the next day, so you need to call three or four to remind you
4. There were no one at the three counters at the front desk during the check-out procedure, and the result was that they shied away from each other, leaving the guests overwhelmed.
In a word, the service ability and efficiency are not good. I am used to inform the customer service center in advance before leaving the store. xxx room can be checked out in advance to improve the efficiency. As a result, people said on the phone that I am sorry, and I have to go to the front desk for check-out. Obviously, the service training has not been done well.

When we checked in, the front desk told us that there was a group staying today, and there will be more people for breakfast tomorrow. It is recommended to come down earlier for dinner. Next, when I entered the guest room, I found that the refrigerator was locked. I called the front desk to ask why, and told us that we need to pay a deposit, but didn't we already charge a deposit of 3,000 when we checked in? They didn't come to us after that. Forget it, comfort yourself that you don't want to eat what's in the refrigerator anyway. Make 2 cups of capsule coffee and drink to calm down the mood of Grandma Benliu. Then shower and sleep. I would like to praise that there are enough towels, 2 large bath towels and 6 medium towels. I feel that if I don't sleep, I can take a shower every hour until dawn, haha. There is nothing to say all night, the bedding is clean and odor-free, and there is no need to worry about skin irritation when sleeping naked. Of course, Grandma Ben Liu is still relatively conservative. The breakfast was very bad. Probably because of the relationship between the team, the variety and display of breakfast meals are quite rough. It is understandable that the epidemic situation in Shanghai has just improved, and the service staff may have lost a lot, and the team's reception capacity is limited. But the omelet chef cooked an egg for me and let me be scalded by splashing hot oil. This is a bit exaggerated. There was no follow-up greeting or confirmation of the injury from the hotel. I asked the waiter to bring me ice water to apply ice. Fortunately, Grandma Benliu is a farmer with rough skin and thick flesh, but only a tiny blister. Final summary: The famous location and hardware are OK, but the service and details are very disappointing.

When ordering coffee in the rest area on the first floor, clearly tell the other party what they want to order. The waiter said impatiently that he would have to wait for more than half an hour. When he reconfirmed that the drink would take more than half an hour, the waiter walked away with a black face Come on, we somehow offended her.

Disadvantages: Insufficient training, there were two groups of employees who didn't knock on the door within two hours after check-in, and they didn't know there were guests inside. There are not enough service resources. When it's time for dinner, the Chinese restaurant and the western restaurant are full. It is recommended that we go back to the room and order room service, and basically order nothing. A light in the room was broken and it was not repaired for two days.

According to the price of nearly 3k, the inner default environment and service will be good, plus the relationship with JW, I want to experience a high-level service.
Hotel B1 has parking lot🅿️, free🆓
After parking the car and taking the elevator, we went to the G floor to check in. After waiting for more than half an hour, we waited for the staff to complete the procedures, and then we went to look for our room.
I thought it was "premium", but I didn’t feel it. The smell of another big bed room was quite obvious after I entered it. A purifier was installed, but it was still a bit uncomfortable. It's tasteless!
Disadvantages: The sliding door of the bathroom cannot be locked, and the shower room has transparent glass. If there are children, it will be embarrassing to open the door accidentally!
In addition, if the care products are of some brands, they are more worthy of five-star hotels🏨

🍃Environment: The surroundings are also relatively empty. There is a "small train" in the entertainment facilities for free. You need to make an appoin**ent in the spa center and walk around for about 6 minutes; the gym and swimming are free, and the children’s playground is for babies under 6 years old. Guys, it's boring to be bigger

🔔Service: The room service response is still very fast, and the staff is also very nice when checking in

Let me talk about the slot:
Because the new opening is not long ago, the room still smells, although I asked for an air purifier, but the sound was too noisy and I could only turn it off when I slept.
The dinner buffet is cost-effective, Singapore laksa noodles are unpalatable, the fruit grade is a bit low, oysters and ice cream are not bad after eating, the grilled squid is very fragrant, I hope the food can be improved in the future. The chopped pepper sauce at the breakfast noodle stall tastes good.
The hotel has sightseeing electric bicycles and bicycles for rent. Scan the code and pay to unlock the lock, but the electric bicycle is 180 yuan per hour, and the pedal is 150 yuan per hour. It takes 35 minutes for an electric car to go around for a full circle. Isn't this price a bit harsh?

I wanted to buy an ice cream later, but I also found several people to deal with it.
Let's talk about the shortcomings. Just when I arrived in the room and prepared to boil water, I could see that there were still stains on it from the guests who made coffee in front of it. Although the hotel is new, the technological content can no longer be described as low, not to mention it. When we checked in, we saw that we brought the baby and did not provide us with the baby’s toiletries. I called the service desk and told us that this should be picked up at the front desk as a gift. It was a bit speechless. Fortunately, the concierge still helped us. We sent it up, give it a thumbs up.
On the whole, the hotel environment is good, the design is good, and the price/performance ratio is relatively low.

Then set up a tent for the child in the room, which is great. The next thing that feels bad. Because the room is new, the ventilation is not very good, and there is a smell.

msg:We went to the jw Marriott with two friends. Actually a very new hotel! But I still don't recommend it to everyone! First of all we checked in on a Tuesday and there were not many guests! It is supposed to be a new hotel, but I don't know the reason. At around 1:40 pm, we went back to the hotel to rest. There was a thump, thump, thump from time to time. The initial guess was that it was maintenance, so the sound insulation is really average! Secondly, since we couldn’t go out to Shanghai, we could only take our children to Fengxian to play. In order to relax the children, we played quite late that night, thinking that there would be nothing to do the next day, so we could sleep late, but I didn’t expect it was just early eight o’clock. , the hotel maintenance staff inexplicably came to ring the doorbell in a friend's room, saying that they wanted WeChat... This is the first time I have lived in a hotel for so many years! If the guests do not report for maintenance, they take the initiative to disturb the guests and say that they need to be repaired! After we checked out to complain, all the customer service managers just said sorry. It was a waste of 1100, and I didn't even sleep well. There is no place for consumption around the hotel, and there is not even a place to have a drink and sit for a while in the whole hotel after ten o'clock! Unless you drive out to find the place yourself! Quite inconvenient!
The entire hotel is repaired outside and inside also repaired!

Upgraded room type for free, late check-out, warm and considerate front desk service. Facing the lake view, the room is clean, the bedding is comfortable, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the bath products are also good. For the requirements of residents, the first time to meet. During my stay, I experienced afternoon tea, buffet dinner, swimming pool and gym, facilities and services were all satisfied. As a new hotel, all aspects of management are still orderly and in place, but there are also areas that can be improved. For example, the quality of breakfast and afternoon tea needs to be improved. In short, this is a recommended hotel, and I look forward to a more perfect experience next time you stay!

The set menu includes a buffet dinner. Although there are many people, the food is added as soon as the food is finished. The crayfish, beer, sashimi, seafood, steak, and lamb chops are very delicious, and the food variety is very rich. The waiter will also deliver abalone rice and coconut desserts to the table.

The hotel’s hardware and design are beyond reproach, quite amazing, and the staff’s service attitude is also very good, but the peak season management is incapable of complaining. The waiting time for check-in, eating, and cleaning is seriously beyond the tolerance limit, and there are no plans and soothing emotions. The measure is just a blunt hope to give praise. Forgive me for not being so against my intentions. It is already the limit to give it four points. The actual experience is not very good.

It is only 300 meters away from the popular Fengxian Museum; it is also close to the Jiukeshu Art Museum;
Walking around the lake in the evening is very pleasant. The night lights of the hotel are good;
The room can still watch the lake chaise couch; the small balcony blows the hair;
The gym is ok, the swimming pool rate is small;
Disadvantages: The food is not very satisfactory (breakfast, dinner), the buffet has few dishes and no vegetables (hot green grass); cakes and breads are not made in the hotel, they should be outsourced, and the taste is too hard; hope to improve in the future

The service attitude is also very average. Hotel delivery service, a dish of rice with a little bit of poor white chicken, 98 yuan, the key is that there is still hair in it. . . Bai Zhanji also seemed to have no appetite. The deposit was deducted after leaving the hotel. I don’t know why I deducted more than 130 inexplicably. The minibar is not free, so I drank a bottle of soda. The balcony is really super, super small, so if I upgraded the room type to me, I'm not in the mood to block the two trees. Basically, I haven't given bad reviews when I stayed in the hotel. The Marriott in Fengxian is really not good, too average, and will not come again.

The hotel lobby and front desk service are meticulous and make you feel at home. The waiter was sent to the elevator to introduce the hotel's facilities and locations all the way, and the room service responded quickly.
The lunch in the Chinese restaurant is delicious, and the attitude of the reception staff when booking a table the day before was just like spring breeze.
The room has a good view, and is across the lake from the museum you just visited. The hotel is surrounded by water, adding a sense of flexibility and comfort.
During the breakfast intensive period, there are many diners, the table arrangement is reasonable, and the seat is guided in an orderly manner, and there is no need to wait for a seat. The meals are also comprehensive. The waiters are very diligent and professional, and keep ordering.
The overall feeling is that the hotel is managed, and the employees love their work from top to bottom, so the guests enjoy relatively high-quality service.

Although the location of the hotel is a little bit close to museums and parks, it’s worth a visit. It’s just that the hotel restaurant closes a bit early for lunch. There is no place to have a regular meal later, so I hope this aspect can be improved. Other services are pretty good. This time the child wanted to take the small train but was told that it was only available on weekends. I’m a little regretful. In fact, there are quite a lot of children staying with children during the summer vacation. I hope the hotel can consider it.

You can check in at 13 o'clock and upgraded the lake view room. The room is not big and the facilities are good. The gym needs to be praised. There are not many types of breakfast but the taste is okay. It is very convenient to walk to the museum after breakfast.

🔔Service: The service must be liked. From the beginning of the door, the waiters encountered were very good at serving, kind, humble and polite. There is a demand to call the service desk, and the response speed is faster.

The children’s bathrobes are elegant gray, and the muffler is all cotton, which is nice and comfortable. The toiletries are a small orange set, and the slippers are made of thin cotton and are very soft.
The swimming pool is beautiful, the water is clean, and the floor-to-ceiling windows add a lot of color. There is a small suggestion that guests who wear their own shoes can walk around near the swimming pool at will. I hope this point can be strengthened by the hotel. Still need to pay attention to hygiene. In addition, the two security guards in the pool are very responsible and have been walking around to check.
Like the lobby manager, although I don’t know the name, a Shanghainese with a larger size, kind, and high emotional intelligence.
In short, a very good family hotel, will come again.

But the hotel as a whole still feels very good to me. The first hotel is very clean, I am very picky, but I did not find any flaws in the room as a whole. The swimming pool of the second hotel is great, the security staff is serious and responsible, and the receptionist is also very friendly with smiling faces. The third buffet breakfast has a host, which feels very regular, and the quality of the breakfast is still guaranteed. The tableware is arranged very quickly.

和朋友結伴出行，環境不錯，服務也不錯，總體都是微笑服務，主動服務，服務意識很好
早餐挺出彩好吃的，還有特色羊肉麪，鮮榨果汁，度假感強
房間較寬敞，景色不錯
室內小童樂園靜，室外動，但下雨了滑滑梯🛝上又有蟲子🫤動就顯得無了，不過餐廳外還有兩個沙池一粉一黃，還是很能消磨時間的，酒店提供免費挖沙工具，SPA前台登記就行，每天使用到下午五點，挺方便的。小火車預約整點可以乘坐兜一圈，風景很不錯，室外泳池景觀不錯，室內泳池開闊，附單獨按摩池，乾淨，沙發小憩好評🤣
週六有🤡捏氣球，下午有安排了餅乾沒做，所以沒法評價啦
總體而言，jw東方美谷周邊遊是很舒心的，平衡感挺好的，情侶和親子應該都會喜歡，屬於攜程套餐給力肯定會二刷的店哈哈哈🤣

1. 因為行政酒廊不開，所以給我們升級了自助晚餐 食物豐盛，服務到位；
2. 湖景房令人驚艷；
3. 行政酒廊的晚餐和下午茶都不錯，擁有行政權益就可以在酒店吃吃喝喝足不出户，要是沒有行政酒廊，周邊吃飯就不太方便；
4. 小童玩樂區域設計優秀，挖沙、小火車、泳池，寶寶在酒店玩的很開心；
總之，感謝奉賢東方美谷jw萬豪帶給我們全家美好的體驗

這幾年萬豪住的少，之前偶爾住一次還敗興而歸…公司福利也選的洲際和華住會，東方美谷jw是上海第50家萬豪，獨具意義的標桿性門店，之前一直又閃促又白挑又送積分什麼的搞得一直沒興趣來體驗，這次特地挑了禮拜一來，體驗到了超棒的服務，不虛此行！

因為酒店整體是比較長條形的建築，所以辦理完入住上電梯，到房間，走了好長一段路
對比了之前住的其他的JW，體驗比較一般
入住當天工作日，前台衹有兩名工作人員，一名在給其他客人辦理，所以我們等待了一會
辦理完入住禮賓部的小男生很熱情，把我們送到電梯♥️
因為提前備註了小朋友過生日，酒店準備了一個小蛋糕和生日賀卡，非常感謝，送蛋糕來的應該是餐飲部的小男生，超級熱情❤️
酒店的小童中心乾乾淨淨
唯一美中不足的是，入住這麼多酒店以來，他們家是第一個淋浴間下水居然會堵住的……家人洗完澡，淋浴房的水完全下不去，打了客房服務來了維修人員，疏通以後，後面再使用也是下水有點慢……有點晚了也不高興再打電話了

        首先入住的時候，遇到了商務開會的團隊也在入住，然後就是一直在等待等待排隊排隊！因為衹有兩個前台可以辦入住。但是有人叫了之後，還就能直接插隊在旁邊就能辦理入住，也是活久見！！
        再説自助晚餐的接待，三組家庭一起去的，其中兩個小朋友兩歲，個麼是不收費的，還有一個小朋友攔着我們不讓進，反覆強調詢問是幾歲，告知六歲以上是收費的，我們知道呀！你收費好了呀！從説第一句話開始我們就是同意收費的呀！其實小朋友是六歲剛剛超過點！我們也不想貪便宜！但是這個態度就很差！中間簽單的時候也是，怕我們逃單一樣，一定要每個房間的每個入住人中的一個簽才行，不能一起簽哦！
        退房之後，打電話來了，説是房間內的浴缸染色，是昨天晚上泡澡之後留下的花瓣印子，衹能説我住了那麼多酒店，也遇到過留下印子的，但是都是因為浴缸之前沒清潔到位所以會這次使用留下印記，所以從來沒有追加電話叫你付清潔費的！客服小姐姐説了，因為他們的浴缸很特別！不是釉麪的！清潔起來要用個進口葯水！所以使用起來特別要小心哦！希望給後面的客人提個醒，用起來當心一點！！
        哦對了！還打出了親子酒店的招牌，其實連個床圍都沒有哦！！！

餐廳：言軒相當不錯，粵菜系，菜品精緻有水準。
 套餐含的下午茶非常一般，沒有套餐，給了蛋糕、薯條、司康和水果盤，無功無過，但量太大，兩個人根本吃不了。
 酒店的早餐該有的都有，但口味質量不行，衹能湊合。
服務總體不錯，但個別服務生業務不夠熟練，建議加強培訓。

旺季入住，排隊人數有一些，但不算超級多，可辦理手續很慢，且缺乏主動性安置和協調安慰，在客人提出需求後才可以滿足，服務前置一些更好。服務態度不錯，效率及專業度有待提高。

根據實際情況，酒店幫忙升級房間為湖景陽台大床間，雖然特殊時期沒有定時的噴水錶演，但是視野開闊很多，陽光充足，每天早晨拉開窗簾，心情都很好。
因為定了平安夜的自助餐，酒店還提供了延遲退房服務。之後還帶着小朋友去了小童中心，小童中心很乾凈，玩具桌遊種類齊全，就是更適合小齡寶寶。

缺點：1. 早餐體驗欠佳，可能是週末入住客人太多的緣故，如同個大雜燴，麪檔處在人過多的情況下不宜讓客人自己抓取菜品，抓得到處都是掉落的菜，並且排隊每人發小牌子想法是很好，但等待的客人根本看不見做好的麪碗上小夾子的號碼。很多的菜品前面沒有菜品名稱，並且枱面上到處都是滴落的食物，比如粥那邊，盛放勺子的東西已經全都是粥。菜品補充較慢。2. 游泳池櫃子不是一點點的少，才20幾個，260幾間客房在夏天是不夠用的。3. 排隊做核酸，也並沒有看見酒店安排客人先做，而是服務員和客人混着排隊。

本來就是跟朋友隨性而起，近郊旅行，選擇萬豪是因為品牌，也因為新開業。入住當天下午想休息，卻被類似於地震聲響的不知所謂的聲音吵到無法休息，好吧，我們是高質量客户，體諒一下，也許因為維修。外圍在施工，被子上有點小臟，床上有個小蟲子，這都不算事，我們大氣點。但沒辦法忍受的是，晚點兩點才入睡的我們，八點多被敲門聲吵醒，本以為是朋友一家叫起床，就起來開門，結果是兩位酒店的員工，手上拿着萬用門卡，我不開門的話貌似就直接進來了，見到我出來質問，就敷衍的説了聲抱歉，説以為沒人，想進來維修。請問我們沒報維修，你們來修什麼？房內是否有客人，不跟前台確認直接敲門？手拿萬用卡無人應答的話就隨意沖進來了？
退房投訴，經確認監控，的確為事實，也承認是他們酒店員工的錯。但前台説值班經理在幫其他客人找手機，要過一段時間再過來，稍後聯繫我們。行，我們也爽氣，相信萬豪會給個説法，好好處理，就先退房唄！中午接到值班經理電話，態度敷衍，處理敷衍，説因為退房了就沒辦法及時處理！！！拜託，我們是體諒找不到你才先退的房好嘛！晚上另一位值班經理來電，先承認是員工的錯，但輕飄飄來一句：不是最後沒開門闖進來嘛！請問，要是闖進來你負的了責嘛！這是你們該有的態度嗎？到現在，除了這兩通電話外，我都沒接到過萬豪的電話，屬於投訴未果的狀態！你們萬豪就是這麼對待顧客的？你們萬豪所謂的管理和服務就是這樣的？一個酒店設施好不能代表一切，管理、服務和售後處理的水平才能真正體現軟實力！
不建議入住，服務水平直接秒殺一切！

msg:🚗 交通：地理位置比較偏，自駕遊不錯，但是打車不太方便，等司機接單要很久。

🍃環境：地處奉賢區，坐落於金海湖人工島之上，上海之魚附近，Gensler的設計充分體現了湖水景觀以及周邊的森林公園等人文資源，打造了具有未來感設計趨勢的酒店建築。

🧹衞生：酒店及房間衞生都非常不錯，特別是大堂和樓層的香氛特別沁人心脾！

🔔服務：特別要吐槽一下！本次的入住體驗非常糟糕！
不知道是因為疫情原因不能外出旅遊的緣故還是暑期親子游的客人入住較多而導致的結果，酒店人手明顯配備不足，從進入酒店開始就各種問題，門口竟然沒有一個Doorman ，因為是帶娃入住，自己拖着一堆行李進入，前台一位男士辦理Check in非常龜速，感覺不太熟悉流程，等了好久之後然後自己再拖着一堆行李去房間，其間還是沒有見到一個行李員！進入2117房間後發現整個衞生間臭味熏天，第一時間聯繫了賓客服務部，告知可能是否因為長期無人入住而造成廁所下水道反臭味，要求轉前台，得到的回覆是前台很忙，幫我轉告！在這時間內我們打開了陽台及房間大門進行通風，並且多次進行坐便器沖水，然而遲遲沒有人回覆跟進！本人在進出酒店時又直接去前台反映了情況，房間電動遮陽簾也是壞的，實在太亮影響睡眠，住到第二天實在受不了再次反映後更換了房間，然而第一天值班經理做為補償心意的贈送水果到第二天也沒有人送來，本人兩次致電前台後告知致歉水果不需要了，隨後當天的值班經理ACE·An送來了，給到的回覆理由是我的水果不在酒店統一為房間配送水果的時間範圍內！難道不應該是處理賓客投訴後第一時間給予跟進和平復顧客不佳的入住體驗為先嗎？兩任值班經理的處理顧客報怨的方式真的是很讓人無語！基層員工都比較木訥，自助晚餐沒人主動收空盤，叫了幾次也沒發現，竟然旁邊桌的客人也一起幫忙招呼還是沒能打動他！大堂吧的服務生也是，推薦的三明治上面有生雞蛋也不主動告知，疫情當前，而且小孩和長者也不適合吧！用餐時需要紙巾連續招呼幾聲，服務生還是一臉茫然，沒有一點回應，福佳白啤酒沒有，那又為何放進菜單呢？員工也是一問三不知，結賬時也不會主動詢問是否是萬豪會員，可以用卡積分，本職工作崗位培訓不盡如人意，感覺好像換了一批員工，之前入住酒店時非常貼心的前台主管Nina和幾位漂亮小姐姐全都不在，之前酒店開業就來入住過幾次，這次的體驗感非常差，以後都不會再來！房間其實非常一般，衝著服務和周邊生態環境來的，毫無性價比可言！這樣的服務水準完全撐不起JW的最高級別，不推薦！

msg:酒店地點實在太好，乾乾淨淨就是漂亮，這是唯一對得起這個價格的地方。酒店硬件不錯，配套的設備都很好，三星的電視機很不錯，空調很安靜。小童jelly bean區域的地板維護的很差，居然拱起高出2釐米左右。室內游泳池的水很冰，一老外都在説cold。後來逃去温水池了。
服務衹能説一般，入住的時候感覺很親切，退房的時候很混亂，酒店沒有做好排隊管理。
買的套餐自主晚餐還沒早餐好，顯示屏介紹晚餐中還有羊排，實際卻沒有。日料沒有，牛排羊排都沒有，晚餐檔次很低一點都沒有JW萬豪的感覺，至少對不起這份價格。早餐有水果吧，晚餐衹有瓶裝飲料。
衞生打掃一般，酒店大堂入口旋轉門這裏都有蜘蛛網，房間內落地玻璃旁也有蜘蛛網，見圖。

7.辦理入住時説按金退房後可退，退房後被告知2-3天
8.聯繫酒店，3個人接聽，各執一詞，一人説聯繫大堂今天退，一人説酒店剛剛開，信用額度不夠，一人説大堂都是實習生，我表示很無語
9.聯繫酒店找當天的MOD，直接表示在忙沒空接聽，態度不是很好。
總體而言，3K左右的價格沒有完全匹配與之相應的服務，環境，設施，對於一個酒店控感到很失望

酒店所有設備，普通到不能再普通，完全對不起這個價格！我們8/7-8/9 三天兩夜，付了大約5300！
攜程上付了擔保費用，保障能有房間（我也不知道為何要擔保），因為到酒店還是得付房費，説離酒店後才會退擔保費用！重點來囉，到了酒店其實還沒有房間，等到四點半才有房間，擔保意義何在？
一開門進房間，嚇一跳，工作人員還在裏面複查房間，更誇張的是我朋友的房間根本沒整理，沒打掃，像是還有人住一樣！無語了！雖然後來因此有所賠償，但在處理過程等很久，態度又很差，無語！到酒店等房間、換房間搞這些事情都晚餐時間了！！！真浪費時間！

最後的結論就是，從來沒有住過這樣水準的五星級酒店，沒有任何一點硬體設備細節及對應的服務，肯定以後不會再去，也會避免再住萬豪集團囉！

msg:The third time staying in this hotel
One word difference
I am really speechless
Checking in the hotel
The normal process is to confirm the order number, pay the deposit, face recognition, confirm the room and then enter the room
This time there is an extra step. The hotel front desk told us that the payment for the room booked on Ctrip this time is the guarantee fee. OK, it’s a hassle
Playing in the hotel entertainment facilities in the afternoon
Buying puffs in the hotel when I was hungry
I found it was too cold when I returned to the room
I stopped my child from eating it immediately
Worried about getting a stomachache
I still felt incredible when I reported this problem to the hotel
It’s really speechless
I found that the air conditioner didn’t respond before taking a shower at night
The answer I called the hotel was that the hotel changed the air conditioner Adjust the system, so this happened.
I want to say that this is not the first time I stayed in your hotel. This is the third time. I am relatively familiar with the intelligent play of the hotel room compared to the first time guests. Alas, the hotel brought a heater.
The breakfast on the second day can only be said to be very sloppy.
Finally, I want to say that I still remember that when I first stayed in this hotel, a lady gave me fresh hot tea when I checked in at the front desk. It was a very heartwarming move. I want to ask if the boss has changed. The work style is really different from before. I suggest that the hotel should be trained well. Service attitude is really important. Alas, I will not stay here in the future. I would like to praise Ctrip’s customer service. I am very satisfied with the handling.
