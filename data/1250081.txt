Apart from the unique building architecture which was the reason when we chose this hotel, we were surprised to know that there was butler tagged to our room, who was always checking out on us. There were many other front & kitchen staff who were attentive and went extra mile to make sure that we were comfortable and welcomed. Definitely a nice hotel to return to.

msg:Breakfast had a vast selection, but none of it was very good. The sushi would make a Japanese person cry, the sausages and bacon would make an English person cry and you would get a better Chinese breakfast for 10RMB at a local market (baozi and yotiao are from frozen).

The main reason for choosing this hotel over other options was the kids club. Unfortunately it is rubbish. A single member of staff doing some origami with leaves or basic art/craft. Requires adult supervision. Very disappointing by international standards.

Hotel is very grand, but not maintained to the standard you would expect from the brand. Design of the hotel does not lend itself to Haikou's climate, the communal spaces are not aircondionable and so it is uncomfortably hot.

Pool was good, but again needs maintenance. Children especially enjoyed the foam cannon.

Room was spacious, clean and cool. 

Coffee is good.

At the time of writing they offer "good night" as a free gift which is a lavender spray. They also offer a free drink on arrival - which just means help yourself to a drink from the fridge in your room.

Overall I would recommend paying a bit less and going with a newer hotel closer to the city.

The other is mostly sunny and hardly ever any people at all times of day!!! Hotel room was really great. Beds and pillows super comfortable. Breakfast is amazing with a million choices. We did the all you can eat buffet one night at the Island Bistro which was great, especially if you like seafood. Didi is super fast and accessible at the hotel. Highly recommended if you want quiet and away from the crowds but still want to go into town and see the sites! Hotel is about a 20 minute didi into the old city.

~Lida wang made check~in smooth. She was very friendly and welcoming. 

~the hygiene standards of the hotel are way below Marriot standards. Rooms were not properly cleaned. Random food pieces in the room, previous guests belongins and so on.
~cleaning staff should be managed better. 
~ spa facilities were nasty and needs proper cleaning. 
~it looked like there were staff members living in the bathroom area of the spa. 

Hygiene is the most important, especially during Covid times. Would not recommend staying here.

The room was very spacious, we had anything we needed there. The best part of the hotel were the hot springs. The weather wasn't as good during the time we were in Haikou, so we spent a lot of time in Hot Springs jumping in the cold swimming pool right after that. 
The breakfast was decent, many international food options. We also got a late check check out, so we were very satisfied with our experience there!

msg:The hotel is in a beautiful location on the bay area, west of Haikou and amongst other big hotels. Check-in was seamless and easy, even though I arrived late at night. Morning breakfast was a big buffet with both Chinese and Western options...very good in my opinion. The room was well-appointed with a nice bathtub, TV and a balcony overlooking the sea, great for sunrises in the morning. The pool was fantastic and the bar service very good, as I could get cold beers brought to me next to the pool. Staff were very friendly. The only downside was there was flying ants or insects in the room during the second night and I got badly bitten on the body while I slept. Not sure what it was. Manager investigated the problem and tried his best to resolve it. The hotel offered to refund me money, which I accepted and they apologized and were very sincere and professional in their handling of the situation. Hainan is a tropical climate, so these things happen sometimes.

🏝️Although it is not a separate beach, it only takes a few minutes to walk there, and there are few people and the experience is very good.
If you have the opportunity to go to Haikou, you still have to stay at the Marriott. After all, the service of a five-star hotel is very good.
I had both the buffet dinner and buffet breakfast🥣, the price is very cheap, and the quality is also OK 😌

The housekeeper, Miss Lida, is very warm and thoughtful. When she learned that it was a family trip, she helped us upgrade the parent-child room in advance and sent hotel activities every day. The hotel is very close to the duty-free shop, it is also good to go shopping when it rains, and a lot of coupons are given

The only thing that can be improved is that the hotel may be close to the sea, the facilities are not new, and the room has a little damp and moldy smell. If the smell is handled, it will be perfect. However, the flaws do not outweigh the merits. If I come to Haikou again, I will still consider choosing this hotel.

msg:During the May Day holiday, a family of three traveled. We did a lot of research and comparisons in advance, and finally chose Haikou Marriott. On April 29, the housekeeper Fiona contacted me and upgraded the deluxe garden room I booked to an executive sea view room. She reminded me of various precautions and was very enthusiastic! I think the hotel environment is the best five-star in Haikou (still a little far from Sanya's five-star hotel). The room is a little old and a little musty, but it's acceptable. The air conditioning is very powerful. On April 30, Haikou was 41 degrees, and the room temperature was OK. There were showers on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. The hotel's children's outdoor swimming pool is very nias. I chose Marriott for this swimming pool. The children played for three days. The hotel is very close to the holiday beach and duty-free shops. The breakfast can only be said to be average, and the evening buffet is also average. The children's activities in the hotel during the holidays are very rich. On the last day, because of the flight delay, the housekeeper Fiona gave me a free delay of 5 hours for check-out, and also arranged a simple meal. It was so thoughtful. A pleasant trip. Thanks again to the housekeeper Fiona Cao Jianghua!

If you bring children, I recommend staying in the West Wing. If you are on vacation with two people, I recommend the East Wing. However, the view from the high floors of the West Wing is very good, especially when it rains, it has a unique flavor

In addition, the hotel has all kinds of facilities, such as swimming pools, hot springs and gyms. The water in the outdoor swimming pool is very clean. The most commendable thing is that the ingredients in the hotel's Western restaurant are of high quality, the dishes are delicious and the service is in place. In addition, the service of the two doormen at the door is very professional and the work attitude is serious. From the beginning of checking in, you will feel at home.

It was the only shortcoming during the entire Qingming holiday. I was woken up by insect bites in the middle of the night! There was dust on the bedside table, not to mention "unknown hairs". The room was not soundproof. In short, it was the worst of the worst! ! The front desk staff was indifferent. When I politely asked to help arrange for something to be delivered, their tone was extremely impatient. 🙄, are the good reviews all fake? I hope everyone will carefully consider the so-called "Marriott" hotel when traveling! Not all of its hotels meet the standard star-level services. Haikou Marriott is too embarrassing for Marriott Group. Refresh your three views😓

The hotel environment is great, just like being in a big park. Secondly, the breakfast is very rich and lasts until 10:30. The swimming pool is very good and caters for both children and adults. There is a beach 5 minutes away from the hotel with few people.
The hotel service is also very good. Our butler Dandan contacted us one day in advance and consulted us in detail about our requirements. He also upgraded our room, applied for executive lounge benefits and delayed check-out until 4 o'clock on the last day. These are indeed heartwarming.
Next time I come to Haikou, I will continue to book Haikou Marriott.

📢Soundproofing:
The soundproofing is great. Foreign friends with children live in the room next door. Even if it is noisy in the corridor, it will be very quiet when you return to the room
🥢Restaurant:
The restaurant is great, the breakfast is extremely rich, and the buffet dinner price is also very affordable.
🌃Room view:
The room view is great. You can see a line of the sea upstairs. The view of the room on the very high floor is superb
If you travel with two people without children, it is better than the two parent-child hotels next door. I will stay here again in the off-season next time😘

Service: The overall service is perfect. Before check-in, I received a call from Fiona Cao, the hotel's executive lounge manager, to inquire about some preferences and check-in time. She was able to help arrange it in advance because it was a family trip and she solved the problem from my perspective. After that, she would send me messages from time to time to ask how I was living. If I had any questions, tell her and she would follow up. Fiona is really responsible and she would actively help me coordinate and resolve any needs I had. I checked into the hotel due to work reasons and I have been busy with work. I have not been able to enjoy the vacation with my family. I am waiting to experience it again after work is over. Before arriving in Haikou, I originally chose other five-star hotels, but everything from environmental sanitation to service was far different from Marriott. In the end, I chose Marriott and changed hotels decisively. Marriott did not disappoint me. Fiona's full follow-up and considerate communication made this trip perfect. I will definitely choose to stay at Marriott next time I come to Haikou because it is reliable and worry-free.

The twin bed of 137 is suitable for bringing two 10-year-old children. The beach opposite is comfortable for playing, and it's convenient to order takeout or taxi.

msg:The hotels in Haikou tend to feel a bit older, but the Marriott's ocean view is truly stunning, and its architectural style is also very unique! The room I originally booked this time did not include breakfast, so I thought I would go out to eat local delicacies if I couldn't. Fortunately, Miranda Si Rong at the front desk coordinated and provided breakfast as a gift. It would have been very difficult to take the children to eat... In addition, the outdoor swimming pool and hot springs are both available. Very good ~ The only regret is that the hotel does not have an internal road leading directly to the seaside. You have to walk out and detour for a while, which is a small regret.

I met the enthusiastic Lida who told me that I could check in immediately. Not only that, I was also upgraded to a room, which was really a surprise. The whole check-in process was very efficient and fast. Lida enthusiastically helped us solve various problems after check-in. Unfortunately, this trip was rushed and the check-in time was too short.
But I can still feel the careful management of Haikou Marriott. I will continue to choose this place next time I come back.
Environment: Very nice, first-line sea view
Service: Feel at home and make people feel at ease
First day welcome drink:surprise
Good Night Rites: Just Right

Although the hotel facilities are a little outdated, the distance to the port, duty-free shopping and hotel services still have great advantages. The housekeeper River also gave a lot of valuable comments and suggestions, thank you again. Dined at the hotel on New Year's Eve. There were many dishes and a variety of dishes. Overall it was good.

Service: The hotel staff are warm and thoughtful, and the cleaning staff sends New Year greetings to guests with handwritten notes, especially 🌸Miranda Sirong🌸, who not only sends beautiful snacks and New Year blessings, but also often asks about the situation during the stay😘😘😘😘.
Although it was raining (the wind and rain are welcome 😂😂), the holiday was very enjoyable😁😁😁! ! !

I didn't bother to take pictures in the room, which is fine. I read previous reviews and some of the close-up photos of the floor looked dirty and worn. But when I saw it in person, it was clear that the pattern was not dirty. If you deliberately shoot it, it will have that effect, but it is actually quite clean. The only drawback is that the room is a bit damp

It was an unexpected surprise! The scenery is very good. The room has an unparalleled sea view through the window. The room is very large, quiet and comfortable. The hotel is also well maintained. The hot springs are also good, but they are connected pools that are relatively close to each other. The overall service is very good. , especially Dandan helped us arrange it very carefully. You can ask him to arrange it. I guarantee that you will be very satisfied. The breakfast is unexpectedly rich and delicious, and the product is definitely worth it. There are few people on the beach, and the sea water is very clean and sandy. Very thin, very suitable for a family to relax on vacation⛱️

From the security guard directing the passage of vehicles, the bellman taking the initiative to carry luggage, and the smiling greetings from the ladies at the front desk, it is like being at home, especially the patient and meticulous service provided by Xu Haijing at the front desk.

The room is spacious, clean and tidy. Although it is an old hotel, the equipment and facilities are well maintained. The bedding is good and the mattress is moderately soft and hard. A fruit plate and good night essential oil were also given. The most surprising thing is the rich and delicious breakfast, and the quality of the buffet barbecue for dinner is also very good.

Good night ritual: probably a fragrance spray, the kind that can help you sleep
Facilities: I have stayed in many Marriott hotels. Basically, there is no doubt that the facilities are very complete, including swimming pools, hot springs, and beaches. Unfortunately, we have encountered bad weather these days and cannot go to the swimming pool, but the hot springs are also good!
Hygiene: After all, the hotel has been there for many years. It is unlikely to be as clean and tidy as a new hotel. The details are definitely not very good. I have a psychological expectation, but the aunt cleans it carefully every day, which is okay.
Environment: Nothing to say, especially the butler Dandan helped upgrade the sea view room. When you open the balcony door, you can see the unparalleled sea view. You can sleep listening to the sound of the waves every night. It is so stress-relieving! Marriott's classic Chinese garden design makes me feel comfortable walking in the backyard every day and looking at the scenery from the covered bridge. I am very satisfied with it. The environment is really five-star! It is also very close to the port in Haikou and the duty-free shop. It is really convenient for shopping and traveling, hahahahaha!
Service: I was still in Zhanjiang, and the housekeeper called a day in advance to help me arrange everything. He also added WeChat and arranged breakfast for the children, a full set of children's toiletries, slippers, and bathrobes. The children did not want to leave. They also helped to delay check-out for two hours. I can only say that the service provided by the housekeeper Dandan must be five-star! Marriott is definitely a family-friendly hotel, and I will continue to choose Marriott next time! ps: The breakfast is also very good, the Hainanese rice noodles, desserts, barbecue burritos, delicious!

Breakfast was arranged according to the number of guests, and children's bed guards were installed in advance. After arriving at the hotel, I looked at the rooms. The clean room that was arranged at first was different in size and had a smell, so I contacted to change the room. I quickly agreed. The two rooms that were finally arranged were close to each other and both were very good. Went to a Western restaurant for lunch at noon. The small hotpot we bought as a group had some taste in the dishes, but the manager quickly resolved the problem. Although the check-in process was a little twisty, Miranda solved it in a timely manner and the overall service was very good! If given the chance, I will come back and stay again next time.

The cold wind blew me a bit and made me feel uncomfortable. However, the service provided by Norah, the lady at the front desk of the hotel, warmed me deeply. After learning that I had a stomachache, because I said that the meeting would end at 5 o’clock and there would be a dinner at 6 o’clock for drinks, the lady very thoughtfully prepared porridge for me and delivered it to the room at 5:30. Here, let me finish the dinner party smoothly in the evening. The location of the hotel is very good. You can take a walk on the beach to see the tranquility of the sea in winter and purify your soul. If I have the chance to go to Haikou again, I will still choose this place.

The entire hotel is large and beautiful, and the rooms are at Marriott level and not very old. The housekeeper, Miss Norah, was very responsible. She contacted me in advance to understand my check-in needs, and she thoughtfully asked me if I needed to borrow a heater. After all, in Hainan's warm climate, many hotel air conditioners do not have heating functions. We were also upgraded to a sea view room, which was a great deal. When we checked in, the lady at the front desk, Lida, was very attentive and cleverly arranged a room with the same number as our birthday. It was very interesting~
The room is large, the view is super beautiful, the bedding is dry and comfortable, and the heating is set up as soon as you enter the room, it's very warm! ! I went to the hotel's hot spring in the evening and it was very comfortable!

    It is about 4.5 kilometers away from the New Harbor. It is very convenient to get off the boat and go to the hotel at night. It is also close to the Convention and Exhibition Center. It can also avoid traffic jams on the second day of the trip. There is a food center not far away with many lively choices.
The hotel's supporting services are all available. The service is humane and the hygiene is always assured. Clean and refreshing.
  The breakfast was rich and the service staff was very flexible.
  Parking is easy.
  I like everything, please defend yourself on the above picture.

msg:too poor! ! ! I took the old man to wait in the hot and humid front lobby for nearly 20 minutes! Because I was traveling with an elderly person, I asked if there were rooms next to each other when I checked in. I saw that the room card sleeve said 370 372, which should be one room apart. After the face authentication was completed, I changed it to 372 in front of us. 375,372 was given to others! I asked at that time why? Are they still next to each other like this? The front desk told me they were next to each other! (Open your eyes and tell lies! It’s so far away!)
Facilities: Old and old! Old stuff can be seen everywhere. Can't such a big group renovate it?
Hygiene: Forget about hygiene! Visibly dirty! The carpets are almost all black! There are fingernails on the ground! There are handprints all over the door! The corners are even dirtier! The room I changed had a strange smell...
Service: The service is even worse! I called and said the room was dirty and I needed to change rooms! Ask me where I am dirty? Shouldn't we arrange for someone to come to the room to take a look? After the room manager came, he made all kinds of excuses!
   I have never seen any five-star hotel that requires guests to ask if someone will take their luggage before they can arrange for someone to take their luggage!
  There are many people at breakfast! I don’t know who dropped the fruit on the floor but no one cleaned it up. I feel like the waiters are not enough!
  Anyway, I won’t come again! Very disappointed!

msg:It was a very happy stay. Jessie Bao Jiaxin communicated some of the needs of the stay in advance before check-in.
This time I stayed in a king bed room with sea view. Needless to say, the equipment in the room is of Marriott's usual standard, and the bedding and bathroom are the style I like. The hot water is very sufficient, probably because there is a hot spring. The pressure of the cold water is slightly lower. After adjusting it, it will not be a big problem. Special praise for water-soluble toilet paper, this setting is still very important.
There is the sea outside the window, and the view is wide. The disadvantage is that when the north wind comes, the water vapor rushes into the room, which always makes it feel a little damp. This is a problem if it is too close to the coast.
As for meals, I only tried breakfast, which has a full range of categories. It is not easy to maintain this after the epidemic. Breakfast in many five-star hotels has shrunk significantly.
However, both Chinese and Western food are complete, and the bread is good, because the croissants are well baked, which is the benchmark. There are not many guests eating, and the seats are relatively spacious.
Because it is adjacent to the Convention and Exhibition Center, there are many conference receptions, so the overall a**osphere is a bit fast, and many friends are in a hurry. If you are on vacation, it is best to stagger the time with the big conference as much as possible.
By the way, although there are no food stalls around, takeout is very convenient and you can order food at any time.
Activities can be arranged later.

The service in the hotel is good. I came here during breakfast to ask how the food was and how the room was. They were very considerate of the guests. I thought everything else was good, but there was a bit of a damp smell. I didn’t expect that when I returned to the hotel room after visiting, there was actually a dehumidifier. The service was very attentive.
The hotel swimming pool and hot spring are very exquisite, and there is also a children's swimming pool, which is thoughtful and suitable for vacation. You can have a pleasant vacation even without leaving the hotel.
Haikou Marriott is a comfortable hotel not to be missed
Thank you also for the free upgrade to the sea view room and buffet breakfast.
I will choose this place again next time I come to Haikou—Marriott

msg:I arrived in the afternoon and the first room I was assigned had a strong musty smell. After looking at 5 rooms, I chose one that didn't smell that bad. After checking in, the child crawled on the floor of the room and saw that his knees, hands and feet were all black. From this, he found that the floor in the room was not clean and the carpet was black. He had to change diapers, so he did not take pictures. The waiter and housekeeper George was very nice and immediately arranged for the floor to be mopped and cleaned again. When I fell asleep at night, I found that the temperature of the air conditioner could not be lowered. I called a maintenance technician to come and deal with it, but the result was still the same. The attitude of the front desk was OK. They told me to change rooms and arranged to see a few rooms. They all had a strong musty smell and let it go. Then Jean brought a fan over. The fan is also old and outdated. It's midnight, and I don't want to bother anymore, so I'll just settle for one night. When my wife got up the next day, her face was itchy. Breakfast: The variety is quite rich, but the number of waiters is obviously not enough. Summary: The hotel's exterior style is good, but the hardware and soft furnishings are aging, the hygiene is poor, and the number of service personnel is insufficient. The contrast with the impression 4 years ago is huge.

But when I arrived at the store, I was told that the first floor was fully booked and my stay was extended. I was very angry. Later, I was moved to a room on the second floor. I went into the room to pack my luggage. About 10 minutes later, a manager of the hotel called Ella called to apologize, added a WeChat apology, and asked about my needs. I was very angry and didn't want to pay attention, but we stayed there for 3 days. She kept apologizing for the whole trip and continued to provide exclusive services, helping to order meals, providing various assistance, giving small gifts to the children, etc., until she left the store.

Before I came to the hotel, I received a call from Ella who asked me about my travel and a series of questions, and told me that it would be subject to the hotel's occupancy rate. She did her best to serve the guests by being able to upgrade them when needed, making my eleventh day a complete success.

First of all, they were very nice and got a room with a particularly good sea view, and they also added a breakfast for the children. Because it was approaching my child’s birthday and I didn’t want to eat out, I chose the Marriott buffet. I went in and asked if there were any candles. The waiter thoughtfully brought longevity noodles and found a small candle. I gave my child a happy birthday. In the end, before leaving, the little genius forgot the hotel. The key was that the housekeeper searched the room for us and finally found it. Thank you very much. The watch is my child’s birthday gift, and it is an indispensable link between us. Thank you so much Norah for helping me find it and sending it to me. Thank you ~ I’ll come again next time.

The hotel is next to the National Exhibition Center. It is only a 5-minute walk to the seaside. It is also very close to the duty-free shop. The starting price of a taxi is basically the same. The hotel has cooperation with the duty-free shop. The flight experience around the world project is worth experiencing. The hotel's doorman service is also great. He opens and closes the door and takes the luggage very thoughtfully and politely.
The hotel's breakfast is relatively rich, covering both Chinese and Western dishes, and a special dish is provided every day; the buffet dinner also has a lot of seafood, and you can choose the seafood yourself and let the chef process it according to your taste. The hotel will also seek guests' opinions to improve the quality of the next day's meals. The sanitary conditions of the hotel are also very good, and the door-to-door service is very fast and timely.
The hotel has many parent-child activities, which are different every day. Just make a reservation in advance. There are lifeguards at the water park at all times during the business hours. The rental equipment is also very complete, and the children have a lot of fun.

msg:This is the first time I stayed at the Marriott. Needless to say, the environment is amazing. When you walk out of the hotel, the beach is clean and there are few people. Haha, you can actually walk more than 10,000 steps a day in the hotel. The swimming pool is really worthy of praise. The brother of the lifeguard has a good service attitude and is responsible. Our children play like crazy. The brother of the lifeguard has been watching the children all the time. He keeps an eye on the pool when he is not playing with his mobile phone. Thank you brothers! ! In addition, the housekeeper Miranda Si Rongrong is very considerate. She added my WeChat to inform the meal time and the children's play items (just happened to meet the bubble show in the swimming pool, which is very good 👍🏻), and also helped to upgrade the sea view room, although the floor The experience is relatively low, but the experience is not bad. Each room also provides a buffet breakfast for children. If you have any questions, you will reply as soon as possible. The service of everyone in Marriott is to enjoy this job from the bottom of their hearts, which is great! The only suggestion is that the TV can be upgraded, it is a bit old and cannot be casted, and only a few channels can be watched. In short, this trip to Haikou, Hainan is really very happy, and it also left good memories for us and the children, THX hehe 😁

The design style of the hotel is retro, modern and high-end. Although the facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained. The service is meticulous and thoughtful, and you can feel the enthusiasm of the service everywhere. On the same day, we even helped to upgrade the room for free, so that the room can have a great sea view. The breakfast variety is quite rich, and I especially like the freshly ground coffee there. I didn't get tired of it after three days. The gym is okay, but the room smells a bit musty. It is recommended to provide more ventilation. The hotel also provides free shuttle service to China Duty Free, which was a great harvest this time. The only slight drawback is that there is no private beach, and you have to cross a big road to go to the public beach, which is really inconvenient.

Finally, I would like to thank Nikki for her meticulousness and professionalism. Before checking in, Nikki took the initiative to contact me to ask about my arrival time and whether I had any special requirements for the room. All were arranged in advance according to my requirements. After I arrived at the hotel, Nikki personally received me and told me I introduced the various business locations of the hotel and told me to contact her at any time if I had any questions. Every time I sent her a WeChat message, she responded immediately and solved my problems. This made my stay at Marriott very happy and the staff were very nice. Warm and friendly, a hotel worth recommending, I hope it will get better and better!

There are multiple swimming pools, the adult and children's pools are separate, very quiet, and the water temperature is comfortable. There is a small zoo next to the children's pool, which has big geese, turtles, and rabbits.

The breakfast is rich in variety, and it is not greasy to eat for five days in a row. The price-performance ratio of the dinner group purchase in the Chinese restaurant is quite good. Our two big ones are full of snacks, and the taste is nothing to say.

Going out of the east gate of the hotel and crossing an intersection is the beach. There is a sandy beach, and the sunset is very beautiful. The surrounding area is a few small roads in the exhibition center, which are beautifully repaired and quiet, very suitable for leisure and relaxation. You can take the free shuttle bus from the duty-free shop to the old city.

The hotel service is very considerate, and all kinds of small needs can be responded in time.

All in all, it meets the standards of a five-star luxury hotel. The scenery is beautiful and quiet. Compared with the more popular hotels in Sanya, it is more suitable for families who are lazy and just want to relax.

msg:Very satisfied with the hotel. I arrived at the hotel at almost 22:00 on the first night, and the child was already very tired. When I checked in, I found that my ID card was forgotten on the online car-hailing car. A short-haired girl with an English name starting with N at the front desk comforted me. It’s okay, use Alipay first The ID card in the hotel helped me check in and upgraded the room type for me! ! ! So happy and so surprised! Hahaha 😄, sweeping away the haze of my lost ID card, 💕The breakfast in the hotel is good, and the dishes are partially adjusted every day. (For example, the handle of the cup is facing the guests, which shows that the usual training is in place) Zhou Qiang, the aunt in the housekeeping depar**ent, is also very good, because once I went back to the room to pick up things, she was at my door, and when she saw me, she told me that I would help you get the room card Open the door, because I am also a former hotel worker, I know this is trained by the housekeeping depar**ent, to prevent some people from taking the opportunity of the housekeeping staff to clean up, pretending to be a guest to enter the room, and like her, very safety conscious,, 👍 customer service Ms. Ella in the center also specially applied for the trial trea**ent of the executive lounge for me. I was very surprised and very happy! During my stay, it coincided with the Dragon Boat Festival, and the hotel also gave me zongzi as a gift. The children love to eat them. Every day when I go out or come back to the hotel, the little brother in the concierge depar**ent will help me open the door, pick up and unload my luggage, and behave well. The clothes hanger is also a pleasant surprise. After all, it is convenient to wash swimsuits and so on. It is practical. The children linger in the swimming pool every day and have a happy holiday. I have a very good impression of Haikou Marriott. It is the only choice for me to come to Haikou again. I will recommend it to friends!

If there is a problem with the check-in time, I will help to solve it as soon as possible. At the beginning, I read the reviews that the Marriott Hotel in Haikou is relatively old, and I was a little worried. After I arrived, I didn’t have such concerns at all. The hotel is very good overall, especially the room is very large. Very pleasant, breakfast is also good! The sea view room can directly see the sea, and there is a feeling of enlightenment, and the overall details of the hotel are also very good.

The first time I stayed in the hotel was my child's birthday and the hotel gave me a cake. The second time I stayed in a normal room type, I was upgraded to a room type. The breakfast is very rich, and there is a hot spring pool where the elderly can soak. There are also ducks, geese, and rabbits that children can feed. Bring the whole family out as long as the children and the elderly are comfortable. The starting price of a taxi to the duty-free shop here seems to be three kilometers, which is very convenient. It is recommended to try the coconut chicken hot pot haha ​​😄 Thank you manager fiona for helping me upgrade the room ❤️

There are welcome fruits, free drinks, and breakfast, which is very good. We also went to the hotel's cafeteria for dinner, and the service staff were very kind and friendly.
Let’s talk about this room, which is the bathroom with the most mirrors I have ever seen. Although the sea and sky are not blue enough on the day of check-in, there is still a sense of a**osphere, and you can also see the rooftop swimming pool and the large lawn on the ground from the balcony.
I deliberately took some photos of the hotel before leaving. The retro buildings are also a landscape of characters that is different from other hotels.
Summary: The Haikou Marriott Hotel 🏨 is still very worth staying in, with good service and a good environment, but the beach is not inside the hotel and you need to cross a road. Everything else is nice👍

If you want to make some comments, the children's activities can be improved. From the publicity of the activities to the content type, there is still a big gap compared with the parent-child hotels in Sanya.

It happened to be that there were several large conferences held here at the exhibition. There was no service at all. It is recommended to bring babies and children to stay in the external building environment. It is okay, but it is limited to check-in and Internet celebrities. You know... The hotel has a paid buffet for dinner, which can be booked first. The taste is average, and the variety is similar to other hotels of the same level. There are no course experience arrangements in the children's activity center. There was only an aunt watching inside when the master went there, so we still made a reservation for one person. It is recommended that if you bring children, you can choose the resort hotels Ai* and Wei* for a sense of experience and service. There are also many entertainment options for adults and children. If there is no comparison, there will be no gap. It will provide a reference for subsequent stays to avoid lightning.

Secondly, the layout of many places is unreasonable. Let me give an explanation: I stayed on the 10th floor of the East District , The executive lounge is on the 8th floor of the West District. If there is a problem, how can I go there? Haha, because the highest in the West District is only the 9th floor, I am a bit dumbfounded. I also asked the guy in the executive lounge who said he was not familiar with it. It is recommended to go back to the lobby on the 3rd floor. In the elevator, enough toss. Talking about the advantages, the location is good, close to the International Duty Free City, the airport is actually not far by taxi, and Sanya Airport is much farther from Haitang Bay. The layout of the bathroom is super reasonable. The two bathrooms are completely separated from the wet and dry. This must be praised (I don’t know if I haven’t lived in other room types)

When I arrived at the hotel, the service buddies were very enthusiastic, greeted me, opened the door, and delivered my luggage! The room is big and has a balcony. Although it is an old hotel, the hardware facilities are very good, and the sanitation is also very clean. The only drawback is that the bed is a bit soft!

After the coastal street is repaired, you can't go directly to the beach from the back. You have to leave the hotel and go there by yourself. There is no foot bath on the beach.
Marriott's service has always been professional and friendly, and the staff I met this time are also very good, such as Timo at the concierge and Lida at the reception.

There are shuttle buses to Haikou International Duty Free City/Haikou Sun Moon Plaza Duty Free Shop.

There are many types of Western food, and they are delicious. The most thoughtful thing is lida's service. If there is any problem, I will reply in seconds to help solve it. I have given small desserts for several days in a row. There are also small gifts when I check in.

The beach outside the hotel needs to cross a road. The scenery is beautiful and the sand is very fine. It is also good in Haikou. It has the same sea as Sanya. The hotel service staff are very enthusiastic, because the 21st happened to be my father's birthday, the hotel specially prepared a birthday cake and room decoration, Lida also specially sent a gift, I am really grateful, I will stay at the Marriott again when I go to Haikou in the future. The hotel's breakfast is also quite good, with many types. There are also Internet celebrities' fried thumbs, which are replaced with fried dumplings the next day. I feel that I will not get tired of eating for a month. The bread and dishes are changed every day. The hotel also has a hot spring , After soaking in the evening, go back to sleep beautifully, overall very recommended

The overall style of the hotel is very Chinese, and the lobby is very a**ospheric. Sister Cheng Si at the front desk helped us upgrade to a sea view room, thank you very much.
The room facilities are good, and the hotel that has been open for nearly 10 years is well maintained. The room is really far from the lobby, it took a long time to walk.
The weather is not good, the swimming pool is a bit cold in the morning. The swimming pool is pretty good, ranging from 1.6m to 1.3m. There are some tropical plants around the ecological pool, which is very impressive. The hot springs are also very comfortable, and it is very comfortable to go to the bubbles when swimming is cold.
The breakfast is useless, there are many types and the taste is moderate.
I will come again if I have a chance in the future.

As a five-star hotel, the breakfast is almost full of flying insects, the rooms are old, and the hygiene is poor. The floor of the room was not mopped clean, it was all oily and slippery, and the hotel was also very bad. The hotel booked a week in advance was more than 400 more expensive than the one booked on the day. I don’t know what the hotel is thinking. No one can communicate with us about all the experiences. Everyone avoid the pitfalls, the Shangri-La next to it is very good and you can choose decisively!

Next to the hotel is the Convention and Exhibition Center. It is very convenient to go shopping if you encounter an exhibition.

The sea breeze is strong and a bit cold. The overall feeling is good 👌 2) The room is very large with 86 square meters, there are fruits, the outer balcony can see the sea, and there is a separate storage room for clothes and luggage. 3) Dinner Dine in the hotel's Chinese restaurant, the price is moderate and good👍When you return to the room, the bedside floor towel is tidied up and a small bottle of sleep aid spray is given. After the breakfast list on the bed is selected, it must be hung on the door before 3 o'clock in the morning to deliver the meal to the room. Wow beautiful! Marriott service is really good! So I set the meal delivery time around 10:15, and arranged for my father and niece to go out for a walk. The next day, I called and said that there would be a charge for breakfast, which was 148 yuan. The buffet is over, and everyone has gone out and hasn’t come back, so I agreed to deliver the food to the room. Let me declare that the room I booked has 2 free breakfasts, and the hotel staff River added WeChat to say that a free breakfast is just Said we had 3 free breakfasts! On the second day, the flight was refunded early the day after tomorrow. Well, it turned out to be 580¥ for breakfast at the checkout! I feel that there is misleading consumption! I live in the room. There is no need to come in and out or do various services when the guests are not here. I personally think that it is not good for the guests to call the hotel if there is something wrong? The service felt a bit over the top! Does it feel like you are being watched all the time? The hotel should give guests more private space! 4) The surrounding area of the hotel is not mature enough. It is suitable for corporate annual meetings or events. It’s okay to come to the hot springs alone, but the temperature was low and no one went there on the day I stayed! 5) The drinks in the lobby bar are well prepared. If you like to drink, you can try it. Generally speaking, it is good. The only dissatisfaction is that we have breakfast coupons, so why did we mislead the consumption of 580 yuan?

I booked a garden room with a double bed to catch up with an event. Nikki, the front desk manager, upgraded me to a sea view after arriving at the hotel Room, also presented a fruit plate, duty-free shop coupons. The room is very spacious, with a bathtub and a small terrace. Sitting on the terrace you can see the sea view. On the day I checked in, I had a bit of a cold. I was afraid that it would be cold at night, so I asked the hotel for a heater. Nikki was responsible for the whole process. The service was very good and the person was very patient. Yes, there are many types of breakfast, which is very rich. It's super close to the duty-free shop, 8-10 minutes by car, the location is so advantageous!

(but a bit pricey) Otherwise the overall score is failing. The breakfast is so-so, with no bright spots or slots. It's over!

msg:I did my homework in advance. It is very close to the port and the duty-free city, which is very convenient. The young lady at the front desk is very gentle and even helped to upgrade. The decoration style is Chinese, and the facilities are a bit old, but as a hotel by the sea, the hardware is well maintained. The room is big and there is a balcony where you can see the sea, and it is very close to the beach. The weather is not suitable for going to the sea, but it is also very pleasant to walk by the sea. The landscaping is also great, even saw a little squirrel! The buffet has a wide variety of dishes, and there are some Hainan specialties. Dross vinegar hot pot and coconut chicken hot pot are also outstanding. Overall, it was a pleasant stay experience!

When I entered the hotel at 10:00 pm, I was greeted with a super strong smell of mold. I don’t know which crack came from the bed. The smell of feet came out. I also took my three-year-old baby with me. After taking a shower at night, I wanted to dry my hair and found that the latch was also broken. I was speechless. The whole family stayed here the year before last and thought it was okay, so we decided to revisit the old place. Big disappoin**ent.

msg:The night I stayed at the Haikou Marriott was really bad. First of all, the facilities are aging, and I have a smell of anti-tide. The wallpaper is mottled and the head of the bed is fluffed. Secondly, the sanitation is worrying. Not to mention that the room is very dark, it is dirty everywhere, and the shower room does not drain well, and some old dirt can be washed out, which is really disgusting. Finally, there is breakfast. The fruit is freshly cut, but a piece of watermelon is as big as a palm. Whose mouth can be so big? The rice rolls are not cooked, the oa**eal porridge should be called oa**eal water, the ingredients of the noodle noodles have no name, blind selection, mustard mustard is cut or not, it is a big piece... There are many varieties, but not many can be eaten. In the breakfast room, there are waiters pushing the dining cart that collects the dishes, walking around loudly. It's not like a Marriott, like a hostel from the 90's.

The room is very big, the road is being built near the hotel, and we can't get there by following the navigation. We finally got there after asking the traffic police on the side of the road.
The hotel is quite old.

msg:Either the Marriott or Shangri-La is the place to live by the seaside in Haikou. The weekend before the Spring Festival is particularly beautiful, the sea is very blue, and of course there are many people. So much so that at 3 p.m., I was still waiting for the room to be cleaned and checked in in the lobby. . .
💰There is no breakfast in the 1,600 yuan room. Ctrip members show room upgrade and breakfast discounts, but there is nothing at the front desk, and the items in the Ctrip package have not been experienced! ! !
Suddenly there are so many people, the front desk only checks in by one person, which is indeed very inefficient. . . It was ok to check in when there were few people before, but the service ability was obviously not good when there were too many people. . .
The weather on the day of check-in was very good. It was very foggy at night and the room was very humid. Back to the south. . .
It's ok not to stay in the peak season, the price is much cheaper. .

Because the hotel is close to Xiuying Port and there is traffic control next to it, I made a few rounds and finally arrived at the hotel under the traffic police motorcycle. It was very bad, but after seeing Morven, the receptionist at the front desk, her warm and heart-warming service made me feel better. I hope that the hotel industry will get out of the predicament after the epidemic, and the business will get better and better, and the service will get better and better.

msg:1. Service: (1) The hotel service is still very good. The lady at the front desk was very patient when checking in, and it took about 10 minutes to complete the process. And took the initiative to add WeChat, saying that if there is something to contact in time. (2) Special praise for the service of the Chinese restaurant on the first floor. Because the family members in the same company had an unwell appetite, they ordered two packs. The service staff in the Chinese restaurant asked patiently, and asked if there was anything they wanted to eat that was not available on the menu. Be very patient. (3) The room service is fast, because a few people vomited in a bad mood and called for room service, it came quickly and cleaned it patiently, a big thumbs up! (5) The breakfast arrangement is not good. Due to the large number of guests, the service was a bit chaotic when eating breakfast on the first day. This kind of forgetting hopes that the hotel should have a plan, and the five-star hotel should not be so chaotic.
2. Facilities: Quite satisfactory, there are not many surprises, the hotel is relatively old, and it is definitely not comparable to the first-line hotels in Sanya. There are not many facilities, and the swimming pool is average, so you can't get in the water even if it catches up with the sky. There is a hot spring pool, but very small. In short, the hardware is average, and there is a big gap between first-tier hotels in Sanya.
3. Location: As a tourist hotel, it is really not convenient to live here. There is nothing around the door. If you want to buy something or go out to eat, you can only go to the vicinity of Yuanda Shopping, which is more than 2 kilometers away, and the surrounding traffic is controlled. It is very troublesome to get out of the car across the sea. The car we rented needs to go around.
4. Beach: Although the hotel faces the sea, it is not the hotel's private beach. It needs to cross a road, and there are no resort facilities on the beach, nor any entertainment items, and you can't swim. You can only look at the sea. The color of the sea is not that good Kind of blue sea. So I wanted to go to a hotel, but there is really nothing to do in the hotel. It is completely different from Sanya.
5. Hygiene: Hygiene in all aspects is not bad, reaching the expected level.
6. Others: There is a charging pile of the State Grid next to the hotel. It is more convenient for Riguo to drive a tram to charge.
In short, it is a hotel that can be lived in, but there are no surprises, it is not suitable for vacation, it is only suitable for business travel, in my opinion. My reviews are very objective.

The child also said that the sound insulation is not good. There are long queues for ferries on outlying islands these days, and the sound of cars and horns downstairs is heard early in the morning. In addition, it is not convenient to go out to eat and drink at this location, and you have to go around a lot to go to the beach. After you go down, there are piles of rocks and the wind is very strong. I really don't recommend it.

msg:This year, when I went back to Hainan for the Spring Festival, I was tossed about half my life by the damn ferry. Arrived in Haikou after 2:00 pm, I deliberately found a house wine to take a rest. I have lived in Shangri-La and Hilton before, but this time I chose Marriott when I wanted to change my place of residence. Place an order through Ctrip and arrive at the hotel smoothly. Due to too many tourists, the room could not be sorted out in time. With the assistance of Ms. Lida at the front desk, I changed to a room on a lower floor and checked in and gave me a breakfast. And booked a three-person buffet dinner in the evening, the overall experience is still good. When I first checked in, I felt that the hotel was a bit familiar. Later, I checked the Ctrip records, and I stayed there once before. 😀 This time I booked a sea view, but it doesn't make any sense at all, it's similar to a city view. It is worth it to sleep from 10 o'clock in the evening to 8:50 the next day.

msg:The internal facilities of the hotel are very good, the size of the swimming pool, the children's room, and the gym are good. When I went to the hot spring, it was under renovation, so I didn't experience it.

The location is also very good, the beach is right outside the back door of the hotel, and you can catch small crabs and the like. It’s not far from the Yuanda Center, where you can eat a lot of snacks~

The beauty Sirong at the front desk also helped us upgrade the room. The room is very comfortable, and the balcony overlooks the entire hotel with a good view. Thank you for your caring care, I had a great time living with my children.

Before I checked in, my hotel colleague Wendy Chen Wenyan took the initiative to call me, gave me an introduction to the hotel, and helped me upgrade to a sea view room. The view from the room is very good, you can directly see the sea, the scenery is very good, and it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to the sea. This experience is super perfect. Thanks to the hotel staff Wendy Chen Wenyan for her thoughtful service.

The room was dim like a mouse hole. Not as shabby and outdated as the Express Hotel, and all the restaurants are unpalatable! The service is even worse. After calling the room, there is basically no text. If you want two bottles, you have to call at least three times! No matter how much this garbage hotel is posted 💰 I won't go there again!

In particular, I think the room is a bit smelly. Although we have stayed for a few hours, the front desk is very careful to show us other rooms, explaining that the weather in Hainan is different from the inland, so it is slightly different, so it will be a little uncomfortable. Also, we drove the tram and couldn't get into the electricity. The little brother at the front desk went to the parking lot to help us charge the card. This is really beyond expectations.

The hotel is indeed magnificent and high-grade, and I have repeatedly felt that this is too expensive for building materials! Entering the open-plan hotel lobby, it is obviously hot and dry, and the front desk is a little cooler in a glass room. The room is also cool, but when you leave the room, it is an open corridor, and as soon as you open the door, a heat wave hits your face. Not very comfortable. Besides the swimming pool, there are few lounge chairs and it is not as good as the Shangri-La Hotel. The food in the hotel's restaurant was delicious and we ate here three days in a row. If I come to Haikou again, I will choose to stay at Shangri-La Hotel.

Xiaolong at the front desk gave breakfast and upgraded the room type!
Cheak In is efficient, which is good
There are two swimming pools, not bad, and hot springs
Large room size MiniBar charges
The breakfast is very rich and the dinner buffet is also ok
The only downside is that the hotel garden is not connected to the beach 😂
Overall very good, will come next time

msg:Worst Marriott! The worst five stars! The service is very poor, not as good as Samsung's level, the facilities are very old, there are pictures! Musty smell is great!

I arrived at the store at night, and I was very tired from the journey. I borrowed a mobile phone charger from the concierge and went upstairs. It was 23:30 after washing up. Prepare to charge the phone and quickly go to sleep, and find that all sockets are out of power. Immediately contacted the front desk to have a look. After 3 times of contact, someone came and repaired it on the spot... I found that the head of the bed could not be repaired, so I went out and got the power *****. It was found that the concierge's charger was broken, the concierge replaced it, and it was 1:00 a.m. when I finally fell asleep. This was a very bad experience for me as I woke up early the next day, and many things could have been avoided, so I had to take the time to give a bad review! Here's the timeline:

At 23:30, I found that the socket was out of power, so I contacted the front desk for the first time and said that I would come to check it immediately;
23:50 No one came yet, so I contacted the front desk for the second time and said that I would come to check it immediately;
00:10 No one came yet, so I contacted the front desk for the third time. During the conversation, the engineer from the engineering department came and started maintenance (as shown in Figure 1, the ladder and the open ceiling);
00:20 It is confirmed that the bedside socket cannot be repaired, but the socket next to the TV is available. It is suggested to go out and get the wiring board to pull the cable. I agree;
00:25 Take the terminal board and connect it, and tell the concierge to send the charger again;
00:30 The concierge brought the charger and finally fell asleep.

During this process, I have the following questions:
1) Response time: It is already early in the morning, and the rest time is very tight. Why does it take 40 minutes to contact the incoming person?
2) Facility quality: Why are sockets and chargers in a faulty state and provided to guests? One can be accidental, and the simultaneous occurrence must be a problem of management;
3) How to handle things: After troubleshooting at 00:10, should the five-star hotel's handling method be on-site maintenance? Am I paying to give your hotel time to repair the room facilities? Will it affect my rest? The cord of the power ***** was in the aisle and I nearly fell;

In addition, when I checked out at 8:00 in the morning, I had already told me a very unpleasant experience, and no one has contacted me until now, without a single apology? Or is this a normal thing in your hotel, no need to say sorry to me?

Putting aside other emotions, the hotel has a first-class view of the sea when the window is opened, but the facilities are very old and unclean, and there are photos. And the smell of mildew is very strong, even if the seaside is humid, but it is really the only thing that can make the taste so lasting and strong after staying in so many seaside hotels.

msg:The hotel is on the seaside, although it is a bit remote, but the facilities are relatively complete. The hotel is Chinese style. We booked a sea view room with a very good view and a landscape swimming pool in front. The hotel's swimming pool is designed reasonably, unlike the Lingshui R&F Marriott swimming pool, which is simply a knife. Although there were some problems during the trip, Manager Cao Jianghua and Duty Manager Cao Qi actively and properly solved them.
The hotel's breakfast is very nice and rich in variety. The young man named Dong Rongzhi who makes rice rolls in the restaurant is very friendly and can put himself in the shoes of tourists. The dishes made in the Chinese restaurant are also of very high standard. Except for the small portion, there are no other problems. The hotel's concierge is also very enthusiastic, and the handling of carrying luggage and opening and closing the car door is very good.
Manager Ella upgraded my room in advance because we were traveling together with several families and arranged it together very considerately.
In short, I am very satisfied with this trip to Haikou Marriott. Marriott will be better because of their hard work! Thank you here

msg:The hotel environment is very good (picture 3), and the service attitude is also very good. We stayed late, the air conditioner was not very cooling, and the front desk responded quickly and arranged someone to drain the air conditioner, which was a little colder than before. There are odorless mosquito coils in the house, which is good!
Areas for improvement in the hotel:
1. The hotel is marked as luxury (the living room and corridor are not air-conditioned), and the temperature of the guest room is recommended to be 21 degrees. I am very afraid of heat. I don't like the state of no cooling or dehumidification after entering the room! Air conditioning refrigeration is 23 but not 23 coolness! Although you told me how to get there, there should be a guide!
2. There is a musty smell in the house and it is damp. You should make this work better! !
3. There was no help with the luggage at the entrance of the hotel, so I watched my husband pull 2 suitcases, briefcases, and shopping bags in by himself. He didn't mean to help! ! Someone pushing a luggage trolley has no intention of coming here! ! !
4. Because you are a Ctrip member, you can upgrade the room type for free. After you check in, you will get a box of small biscuits. My suggestion is that you have one cookie and one bag, which is really cheap! Even without this box, a red fine paper bag is much better than this!
5. There is a hair under the bed sheet that is not cleaned, which should not appear in any hotel! !
6. It is recommended to add one more shampoo and conditioner in the hotel. Boys may be able to. For someone like me who has a lot of long hair, my husband will not have it after I use it.

And when I went back one night, the door could not be opened, and the manager on duty finally inserted the lock to open it, which was quite tortuous. Because it is a business trip, there is no time to experience the hot springs, which is a small loss.

Before moving in, the lady called me to ask if I had any requirements. It also helped me to upgrade the parent-child theme room for free.
Even the terry bathrobes in the theme room are monkey-themed, and the children are very excited 🥰
The hotel environment is also very good. There is a children's swimming pool downstairs, as well as a play area and a hot spring area. After playing outside for a day and staying in the hotel at night to take a hot spring, I feel that my fatigue has been eliminated, and there is better news. I would like to thank Director Lin Shihonglin for his considerate arrangement for my stay this time. He also gave the children drinks and desserts. The children were very happy. If you have any questions, you will answer me, and also help me with takeaways. Hahahaha, I'm embarrassed ☺️ The next time you come to Haikou, the first choice is Marriott. It's a good choice for families to play and stay.

There is a children's room on the first floor of the hotel, and there is a slide in the western restaurant ~ my baby refused to come out after playing all day.
The hotel faces the sea, just across a small road is the beach. It's a pity that it rained heavily when we checked in. We can only watch the sea from the balcony of the room.
The stay experience is wonderful, and I will choose Marriott next time I come to Haikou!

The children entered the room, saw the warm room, and happily shouted that they will stay next time!

msg:This time I came to Haikou for a trip. The first stop I wanted to stay at the seaside and see the sea. I chose a hotel on the Internet for a long time, and finally I chose to stay in this: the Marriott Hotel in Haikou.

All the seaside hotels in Haikou are far from the urban area, so it is not convenient to take public transportation to come here. It is recommended to take a taxi or drive there.

At that time, I finally chose to live in this hotel, mainly because of the Chinese classical garden-like design of the buildings in it. It is indeed a surprise to enter from the entrance of the hotel. The architectural style of the lobby and the house, and even the interior design of the guest rooms are all embedded with a strong Chinese style, which is a**ospheric and elegant, which is indeed my favorite type.

My room has the right to be upgraded to a sea view room for free on Ctrip, so I directly stayed in the hotel's sea view room. I would also like to thank the front desk of the hotel, Ms. Lin Shihong, for upgrading my room to a comprehensive level. The room facing the sea and the hotel's breakfast have added a few points to the experience of staying, which is very good! 👍

And this time I stayed in the sea-facing room. The room was huge, and the design of the room was also very clever. There was also a storage room for luggage, which was not bad! 👍And I stayed in a room facing the sea this time. The sea view is really good. I opened the door of the balcony and I saw the sea view in the picture. The hotel's own garden environment is also very good. The swimming pool and hot spring pool in the garden can also be enjoyed by hotel guests during the opening hours. The only drawback is that the hot spring pool is small and the hot spring water is turbid. I asked the staff that the hot spring water is turbid because the hot spring water has not been filtered. Although I also went to the hot spring pool to soak in the hot spring, the quality of the hot spring water is not bad, but I still can't adapt to this kind of water quality psychologically. . 😂 I also experienced the gym that comes with the hotel this time. Although it is relatively small, the equipment is relatively complete. A simple exercise when going out to the hotel is enough. As for the hotel's breakfast, for a five-star hotel, it can only be said that there is nothing wrong with it. Bar.

For this hotel, if I come to Haikou next time and want to live by the sea, I think I will still choose to stay in this hotel. Living in this hotel has a feeling of vacation, and the overall experience is really good. , also recommended here.

msg:Before leaving, a friend recommended me to live in Shangri-lar and compared it. The window of the Marriott's sea view room is relatively wide, so I chose Marriott.
As a result, during the Spring Festival holiday, it was said that the room was hot and the occupancy rate was high. Only the 4th floor can check in immediately, if the 5th floor needs to wait at least an hour. If you really want to live on a high floor, you can arrange to change rooms the next day. Think about it, there is not much difference between the 4th floor and the 5th floor, so there is no waiting. The room given to me is different from what I saw on Ctrip. The window is very narrow, the position is recessed, and there is a large pillar on the left side, which affects the view. (Figure 1 and Figure 2)
The friend who checked in later than me took the room on the 7th floor. So I decided that I had to change rooms the next day. The sea view of the room on the 7th floor is wider than that on the 4th floor, but the roof is too low. (Pictures 3 and 4) I don’t want to toss and change rooms anymore. Then, it was obvious that the room card was changed, but when I went back two nights later, the room card could not open the door, so I called the front desk and waited for someone to open the door. Also drunk 😵‍💫
When checking in, because I was not satisfied with the room floor, the receptionist gave two drink coupons for the lobby bar, so I went to try the hot American style. Deep roasted beans are like drinking charcoal-fired coffee, and your heart beats faster after drinking it. The only thing that can be done is that the View in the lobby bar is still available.
In addition, knowing that there are no restaurants around the hotel, I booked a room with breakfast. In Hong Kong, the breakfast is really average. You can only choose milk corn flakes, fried eggs and sausages and other foods that are not bad. In the self-service executive lounge, many wine bottles have been emptied, the ice cubes are almost gone, and they have not been replenished in time. The only explanation is that the breakfast and executive lounge are not profitable.

The room is too big, the balcony is also big, the bathroom is very big, it is separated into four, and there is a small cloakroom, the facilities are perfect, clean and tidy. There are hot springs and swimming pools. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The only downside is that it is a bit far from the city center. It is not very convenient to eat and shop, but it is very suitable for leisure and vacation while watching the sea.

When I came to Marriott, the front desk Nancy was gentle and pleasant, warm and thoughtful, and I was pleasantly surprised. I went out to the beach. Boiled beef porridge, lean meat porridge, freshly steamed beef vermicelli, shrimp vermicelli, and the 298 set meal in the Chinese restaurant are all a wonderful enjoyment.

The overall check-in experience is very good and the service is very warm. Any staff who see you will take the initiative to ask if you need any help. We only need to bring it when we go out. East and West staff will take the initiative to come to help bring things to the room. The breakfast is very rich, and you can eat many local specialties. Because the check-in experience is relatively good, I originally booked a room for only three days, and then it was directly extended for another four days, and I stayed here for seven days.
This time, I would like to thank Jacob (Li Xinle) who checked in at the front desk, mainly because his attentive service gave me a good first impression of this stay. He learned that our children are traveling by plane for the first time. In order to Leave a good travel memory for the children, give us a free room upgrade, and also send the children's breakfast. The children also participated in the hotel's parent-child activities to make Yuanxiao and biscuits. Although we were the only children, the staff taught them very seriously and enthusiastically. Next time I come to Haikou, I will continue to choose this hotel.

msg:On the first day of the first ***** month, the model from Sanya to Haikou was started, and I arrived at the Haikou Marriott Hotel in the evening. I did not expect that this night was terrible.
According to the navigation to the hotel, there is a large theater around the hotel. Maybe because it is a new area, it can be described as sparsely populated, and there is no commercial area around.
When I checked in, a passenger complained next to me that the room was not heated and it was too cold. I didn't care at that time. After entering the room, I turned on the faucet of the washbasin, and the rust-colored muddy water poured out, which was really shocking. After leaving it for a long time, the color gradually faded, thinking it was clean, and the water was put in the bathtub, but it turned out to be muddy water with a relatively light color. Finally, I relied on a small heater and added a quilt, which lasted for one night, and other facilities were casual. I took a few pictures and they were all pretty bad. Disposable slippers smelled bad, and asked the staff to get new ones, but the staff came to the room and explained that the four pairs of shoes were smelly! The most annoying thing was during breakfast, our 11 year old kid came back crying with noodles after waiting in line for noodles for half an hour and said the staff ignored her! To verify the matter, there is also an aunt who witnessed the process next to it, who proved that the children were always cut by the people behind, and the staff ignored them, so that the disadvantaged groups received unfair treatment in the queue! Really bad experience, Marriott should take some effort to fix it.

🚗 Transportation: The location is actually not the old city center, but there are still shopping malls around you to eat, eat and stroll. We rent a car by ourselves, it is very convenient to have a free parking lot! Basically, it takes about 30 minutes to get to the old town, which is still very fast.

🧹Sanitation: Very clean, the old five-star hotel is still in place. There are many pools on the way to the pool. People have been coming to salvage the leaves, which is OK. By the way, let’s just say that the swimming pool is not at a constant temperature.

🍃Environment: The environment is very good. The hotel has natural hot springs! Very comfortable! Because I was alone in the morning, I listened to the waiter's introduction in detail. It is recommended that visitors come to take a dip a day! do not miss it! The beach is a bit far away. The two small beaches close to the hotel have to go down the mountain and walk down the path. There is a danger of losing it. It is recommended to go to the public beach that is farther away, which is safer.

🔔Service: Finally, this service is really to be praised! At the beginning, I called to explain my honeymoon trip. Their waiter Li Jiayi Judy added me to WeChat and helped me make notes because they couldn't find the order. After confirming the order number the next day, I also introduced the honeymoon subsidy and Marriott will give me some surprise gifts. It made us feel sweet and full, and the service was very good! Praise this Li Jiayi Judy! The overall service was also very satisfactory during the stay. Basically, if there is any problem, call the 0th switchboard to solve it in one stop.

Overall it is the fourth stop of the honeymoon!

The front desk staff is nonsense, saying that what I booked was Garden room, am I stupid? I booked a garden room at a high price of 200. Of course, it was an upgrade package brought by Ctrip. When my room was sold out, I bullied the grandparents with children and made them stand in the lobby for an hour! After Ctrip's communication, they continued to lie, saying that they arranged a sea view room, and they couldn't see anything when they checked in that night. The next day, when they saw this sea view, they wanted to vomit blood. They contacted Ctrip immediately, and they agreed to change rooms at 7:00 in the morning, admitting the deception. There was no response by 3 pm, so I urged again, and it was changed to a sea view at 5 pm. The old man and the child did not go anywhere for a day, and the child did not take a nap until 5 pm. Forget it, there are so many details, too bad! Anyway, don't live, no integrity, no service, no courtesy...

The swimming pool is half shaded by the trees, not counting the sun. It is worth mentioning that the hot spring, although small but natural, the water is yellow and yellow without filtration, so it is very comfortable to soak. The rooms are very large, and the facilities meet the Marriott standards, with a large balcony facing the sea. The weather in Haikou is hotter. It is recommended to close the door when you leave the balcony, otherwise the room will get wet after a while. The restaurant products are also qualified. Would recommend it overall.

Let’s talk about the hardware first. The traces of the years have not left too much in Haikou Marriott. The maintenance is very good, and the hotel facilities are very good. They are the same as they came before. During the epidemic, the rooms were equipped with disinfection tissues and hand sanitizers. Many intimate hotels that also provide mouthwashes
In terms of service, the little brother Chen Mingyun who stayed at the front desk this time helped us arrange it properly. He upgraded the executive sea view room and saw the sea by pushing the door. He added breakfast to us and sent a welcome fruit plate. Hearing that we were swimming, I was a little cold. Ginger soup, meticulous stay for three nights, the service is very attentive
Next time you come to Haikou~ Don’t worry about who to live, choose Marriott~

The hotel is right next to the Convention and Exhibition Center, and the opposite is Shangri-La. There is a beach in front of the hotel, a good place to watch the sunset. It’s not far from the ferry port and the railway station. The airport comes to Gaode to take a taxi at more than 80 points. Haikou is really not expensive.

I often see upgraded room types in the reviews, but I don’t dare to bet on my luck. There is also breakfast, which is also included for convenience.
The second point is that the staff training in this place is very good. The front desk, guest room, concierge, and recreational staff who came into contact with the staff all smiled to serve and solve problems from the perspective of the guests.
Cream Lin Shihong took the initiative to contact him one day in advance, hoping to prepare the room before we arrive, very considerate.
Since the afternoon tea and buffet dinner included in the room order we need to consume within one day, Mr. Cyril Cao Qi at the front desk contacted and communicated with various depar**ents to protect our rights and interests. Thank you 🙏
Later, we will also learn more about the hotel structure, try not to cause trouble, hehe

You must bring mosquito sprays with you. Huang Silong at the front desk gave a careful and careful service, introduced the hotel in detail, and also presented fruit and breakfast for the baby. Room service Liu Jingxiang also proactively added bath towels and water according to our needs, which is very heartwarming. But in the evening the Chinese restaurant has dinner and eats Chinese food directly into French food... The taste is very satisfactory, but the speed of the meal is really maddening, and the service staff keeps helping us with big belly. Overall, Marriott is still satisfactory, and it is very convenient to drive by car. I will still choose it next time.

Location 🏙: next to the International Convention and Exhibition Center, next to the sea [beautiful sea view]
Environment 🏞: Like a seaside palace, ancient architecture, quiet and comfortable, antique
Scenery 🏖: The balcony of the sea view room faces the sea directly, and you can vaguely see the buildings in Xuwen, Guangdong, which feels like a "mirage"
Breakfast 🍞: It meets the standard of a general five-star hotel, with rich dishes and good taste
Facilities 🏊🏻‍♀️: The hot springs and swimming pools are good, and it is very relaxing to go to the hot springs after busy work [hot spring soup pool]
Service 🏅: Huang Sirong at the front desk is very enthusiastic and attentive, and other waiters who meet will also take the initiative to say hello
Except for some trouble with the order, the overall feeling of staying here is very comfortable, recommended~

There are multiple swimming pools in the hotel~ There is a separate adult pool, and there is a child➕adult~ This way you can play in the water without being separated~ A small suggestion, the swimming pool lights up at night, otherwise you will not dare to go inside when there are few swimmers ...

After learning that I was a two-year-old, she took the initiative to upgrade me for free. There is a large bed and a crib (a wider crib that can sleep two children) ) Family room. The room is very large and the balcony is facing the sea. The bathroom shower room is connected to the bathtub and two children can take a bath at the same time. Although the room is not very new, it is clean and tidy. The big bed is big enough for two adults to sleep with a child. The hotel lobby and the overall building are high-class and antique. The check-in area is surrounded by a separate glass room. The room is very air-conditioned and will not be as hot as some open halls in Sanya. The breakfast is also good, there is no mention of a particularly amazing breakfast, but it is also rich in variety. And the hotel prices are also cheap. I just switched from a hotel in Sanya with an average price of 1,800 for a week. Once I stayed at the more than 500 Marriott, I feel that the price/performance ratio is so high! Finally, I would like to thank again Miss Lin Shihong for her warm and caring service. On the morning of check-in, I sent WeChat to confirm the check-in time to arrange the room in advance. After check-in, I also greeted me many times to see if I had any needs. I responded to my questions in seconds because her warm service made me decisive before entering the room. Decided to continue staying the next day! Thanks again to Miss Lin for drawing a successful conclusion to my 11-day trip to Hainan!

This time, my wife and I came to cycle around the island for 13 days. Everywhere we went, whether it was a five-star hotel or a special homestay, the hotel service staff we met were very concerned about us, asking about our health, taking care of our bicycles, asking about our itinerary, and letting us know. We feel the warmth of a home away from home. On the afternoon of the 27th, we rode to Haikou Marriott, the end of our trip, in a rare cold wave and wind. We expected the best service. But when we exhausted our last strength and rode up the big slope of Marriott to reach the entrance of the lobby, we hoped to park the car on the side of the porch that does not hinder pedestrians, so that when I check in, my wife can watch in the lobby and cannot lock it The car, but after we showed our identity as guests, the security guard at the entrance of the hotel still asked us to park the car in a windy gazebo in the distance, so that my wife had to stand in the wind and rain and wait, and there was It is a parking place for takeaway vehicles. Perhaps for the big security guard, the cleanliness and orderliness of the entrance of the famous hotel Marriott is far more important than the warmth of the guests. When we checked in, I had already made up my mind that this would be my last time at a Marriott as we didn't have the energy to change hotels. But when we communicated our experience to Howard, the GSM depar**ent of the hotel, he gave us meticulous care, eased our emotions, and arranged late check-out and airport drop-off services for us. His colleague Cyril also took care of us, allowing us to spend a wonderful three-day rest at the Marriott, and enjoyed Marriott's food with friends to celebrate our successful completion of the difficult itinerary. This also makes us believe that this is just an isolated incident and does not represent the overall management level of Marriott. Thank you Howard and Cyril, we will come to Haikou Marriott again in the future.

Although it is not far from Shangri-La, I read the comments of Ctrip and Xiaohongshu and decided to change the Marriott hotel one day before departure. The assistant contacted Mr. Zeng Xiangpa at the front desk and upgraded the family sea-view suite before we moved in. Let us look forward to this 4-day short vacation...
Let me talk about the room first. The suite is very large, the toilet and bathroom are separated into two (this is particularly good, it solves the embarrassing problem), the desk and sofa, the working and studying conditions are very comfortable, and the child's bed is bunk, which is very cute. The most amazing thing is that besides the blue and calm sea from the balcony, there is also a circular island lying on the sea. The special mystery can actually make people feel at ease and relax.

Then talk about hotel facilities and activities. Green plants, swimming pools, and food are indispensable for beach hotels. Maybe in the future, it was not expected that the hotels in Haikou would be as attentive as the pure resort hotels in Sanya. When you see the heart-shaped tree built by Marriott, the green and environmentally friendly ecological swimming pool, you can look up at the starry hot spring pool at night and enjoy the rich taste buds and appetite every day. I feel very satisfied when it comes to delicious food.
Finally, re-color the service. Mr. Zeng not only helped us to upgrade our room considering the particularity of our work and vacation, but also warmly received us and solved the problem in the few days we stayed. thank you very much!
On the last day of our stay, we took a walk along the coastline opposite the hotel before breakfast. There are many small crabs between the fine sand and rocks on the beach. I choose to jog for a while on the running track and pick up shells on the beach. There are no noisy tourists, only local residents who are more pleasant and calm than us. The sunshine and sea breeze are just right, with beauty My mood, remember Haikou Marriott in our summer holiday, slowly aftertaste.

The Haikou Marriott Hotel looks magnificent and the lobby is fine, but the rooms are decorated and equipped. The old and new Chengdu is really not flattering, the decoration style feels good, the cabinets that open the door are still chirping, the parking lot and the restaurant are too far away from the room, the facilities are relatively old, the sea view is really average, the good point, the breakfast Plenty, more enthusiastic at the front

The only downside is the buffet dinner at the Marriott Hotel in Haikou. The seafood is very stale and there are few types. The five main flavors of crayfish are also more perfunctory. It is the worst Marriott buffet ever.

服務：最值得的是服務在線，管家蛋蛋很貼心，有提前聯繫安排房間，還給我們免費加床贈送早餐，安排房間的視野也非常好，大晚上反饋給他説房間潮濕，就努力幫忙解決，加了除濕機床品烘乾。不管餐廳用餐還是門口行李幫忙推送，都能提現萬豪水準。

設施：是老酒店了，主要還是房間設施都比較老舊，布草這些很乾凈，但是床單床等是都比較黃了，還是有待做升級改造。
最後，雖然之前有做了攻略心理也有預期房間潮濕問題，但是我們兩間房間同樣樓層和朝向，一間完全沒有潮味，另一間實在是濕的不行，越晚潮濕問題越嚴重，還是陽台門基本保持關閉狀態，都感覺傢俱都在散發潮濕木頭味，因為帶娃懶得折騰換房間了，一整天都開着除濕機倒了好幾桶水 ，所以無法接受潮濕味道的還是多考慮下，或者提前聯繫管家做好安排！

特別特別表揚Fiona，上一次入住提前聯繫了我，這次入住是給父母預訂的，安排房間，包括辦理入住全部都有持續的跟蹤服務，相當相當的周到。住宿中可能遇到的細節也都提前考慮清楚都安排好了。這是整個三亞行程中最令人驚喜的部分，衝著Fiona的五星服務，酒店肯定是給5星的。
綜合來説，酒店區位不錯，性價比極高，裝修中規中矩，公共區域大，設施豐富，近海邊，適合親子入住

msg:首先，寫下來海口旅遊選擇萬豪的原因，多年前一次青島之旅安排入住萬豪，那一次的住店體驗非常之好，從內部裝飾、衞生整潔度、科技化等方面都非常出色，尤其留下深刻印象就是萬豪的早餐，豐盛又美味，所以這次海口之行，第一選擇就是萬豪，且看介紹説靠海灘，而市中心的酒店大多不靠海邊，所以更堅定了住宿萬豪
先説下這次入住的優點吧
1、服務，首先感謝管家david一路安排，從住前到退房後都服務熱情周到，深夜空調問題也及時進行解答，對這樣的服務態度，打五星好評
2、餐飲，萬豪的早餐品質還是一如既往，雖然這次種類感覺偏少，但是每樣口味都很不錯，晚餐也選擇了萬豪的自助，也是意料之外的好吃，最重要是菜品品質，新鮮乾淨最重要
3、海口萬豪建築風格據説是海口的小故宮，這點還是認可的，整體中式裝修風格確實獨樹一幟
再説下缺點
1、潮！這是住進去之後第一感覺，太潮了，也許是下了一天雨的緣故，整個房間都非常之潮，在床上坐了會，感覺褲子都浸了潮濕感，當晚入住是有些崩潰的，且我住的這間房空調衹有製冷和送風兩種功能，沒有除濕沒有加熱，衹得睡前泡個熱水浴暖身，當天覺得整個海口都是這樣潮的也沒辦法可能這就是南方的緣故，但是隔一天我們換到了市中心的酒店，就完全完全沒有潮這個問題了
2、直通海灘的門沒開，萬豪與海灘隔一條馬路是來之前就知道的，但是沒有想到，從酒店大堂通往海灘的鐵門是鎖着的，導致在酒店轉了一圈都沒有找到通往海灘的出口，問過前台給我們指路後，仍是找不到，最後索性直接從酒店正門出去，饒了一段路抵達了海灘。選擇住在西海岸萬豪，有一半原因是因為去海灘方便，但這次沒有“直通”，這一半的體驗直接打了個折扣
3、萬豪的房間面積在眾多酒店裡算是很大的了，但是可惜床寬衹有一米八，在這樣大的房間裏顯得空空盪盪，要是換成2.1床會更貼切

服務：驚艷到我了 ，前台美女KIMI服務熱情，免費給延遲退房到下午四點鐘。並且給贈送了早餐。由於這幾天海口潮濕，酒店給準備了除濕機，給加了被子，服務那是相當OK。不愧是五星級酒店。
設施：應有盡有。

此外，該酒店還提供了一系列的娛樂設施。室外有一個游泳池，在晴朗的天氣裏，我可以在這裏享受陽光和新鮮空氣。酒店還提供健身房設備，讓我可以隨時鍛鍊身體。
總之，我非常喜歡這個酒店。它的各種設施一應俱全，而且員工非常友好和熱情。如果你想找一個舒適且方便的住處，我強烈推薦這家酒店。我給它打100分，我相信如果你來這裏住，你也會像我一樣十分喜歡這個地方!

msg:我剛剛從海口萬豪酒店歸來，這次的入住體驗雖然美好，但也留下了一些遺憾。
酒店坐落在美麗的海濱，環境優雅寧靜，彷彿置身於人間仙境。當我走進大堂，那種豪華而不失温馨的氛圍立刻讓我感到舒適和放鬆。
我入住的是海景房，從房間的落地窗可以一覽無餘地欣賞到迷人的海景。清晨，陽光灑在海面上，波光粼粼，美得令人心醉。晚上，則可以坐在陽台上，聽着海浪聲，享受寧靜的夜晚。
酒店的設施和服務也讓我印象深刻。游泳池、健身房、水上樂園等一應俱全，無論是想放鬆身心還是尋找刺激，都能在這裏找到滿足。然而，遺憾的是，由於時間太短，我未能盡情體驗水世界的所有項目，那些刺激的水上設施讓我心生嚮往，卻又衹能留待下次。
儘管有些遺憾，但酒店員工的服務態度熱情周到，尤其是行政酒廊的Fiona無論我有什麼問題，他們都能耐心解答，讓我感到非常温暖。餐廳的食物也非常美味，無論是海鮮大餐還是精緻的小吃，都讓人回味無窮。
總的來説，海口萬豪酒店酒店給我留下了深刻的印象。雖然有些遺憾未能盡情體驗，但這也成為了我下次再次光臨的動力。我相信，在未來的某一天，我會再次來到這裏，彌補這次的遺憾，盡情享受這個度假

但是有些設施缺乏維護，例如東區電梯屏幕已經無法打開有些電梯需要刷房卡 有些已經失靈
服務：
管家加我微信之後，和我確定好入住時間，但是入住的時候並沒有幫我保留房間
禮賓，前台,管家 沒有一個人介紹酒店設施和套餐，房間內也沒有介紹的物料。我的禮遇包含下午茶，早餐，温泉，旅拍和童樂園。

投訴之後，負責接待我的 Ella 非常好，態度很好 很負責也很專業。算得上是海島最專業的管理之一了。不同於海口威斯汀的犟嘴小妹，Ella非常熱情 立即去檢查了電梯，並且更換了開封的礦泉水，還贈送了行政酒廊的禮遇。孩子們玩的很不錯。

衞生：
旺季地面擦完還沒幹
礦泉水發現🈶被人喝過一口，不知道是哪個環節出了問題。
服務：全靠Ella一個人講解。也算是用這個價格住了一次麗思卡爾頓，在萬豪體驗了一下真正的私人管家。當時我在市區見客户，Ella幫我協調預約到了旅拍，並且幫我延長了住宿時長。 態度非常端正，處理細節非常完善，在這個平台如果有更大的權限應該可以做得更好

酒店在西海岸，會展中心隔壁，隔着環島公路就是沙灘和海濱步道，因此行車聲和海浪聲融為一體
酒店餐食不貴，自助餐偏中式、品種豐富，早餐居然有現切的西班牙火腿，驚艷
夏天來的時候，感覺户外泳池還是可玩性比較強的，春節來，趕上降温降雨，出不了門，如果豐富些遊樂項目就好了

辦入住等了一個多小時，耐心從入住起都耗完了。
進入房間看到老舊的設施還有衞生死角，大失所望啊！唯一優點可能就是離海近！但是也不是酒店的私人沙灘，衹是人比較少。
帶娃的話可以去小童俱樂部（老舊，服務人員不在線，位置偏不好找）喂喂角落裡的大鵝，玩玩水，挖挖沙（在酒店庭院陰面很潮濕）

msg:帶93歲的奶奶來海南玩，按照長者強烈要求還沒住過西海岸，最終選擇了萬豪。
其間發生了一些小故事。辦理入住時提出希望可以安排海景房的願望，和希望兩間房可以離得近一些。給安排到了最棒的觀景房間。酒店最靠前的房間，周圍完全無遮擋，走出陽台就是一覽無餘的大海。但因為太靠前，周圍太無遮擋，陽台兩面通透，風也是巨大。我們感覺長者受不了這麼大的風和濕度，又跑去前台請幫忙換房間。很快就幫忙辦理完成。其實心裏覺得，魚和熊掌不可兼得，可能換的房間觀景不太理想了。上去一看簡直太棒了。完美符合所有的需求。

服務：再次重點感謝➕表揚lida，非常貼心和不厭其煩的安排，讓奶奶很滿足和愉快，並表示要記住房間號碼，下次來還要住這個房間。我們也非常開心，再次感謝lida！

環境：環境很大氣

住的陰面，升級到奢華海景房，正面能看到大海，晚上陽台還有兩衹壁虎🦎在房頂爬，真是很無語，周邊很不方便，人也很少。原本是為了海景和沙灘選擇的，但實地體驗很差，下次不會再選擇了。評價謹慎。

這家萬豪是國風園林的設計，植被茂盛，亭台樓閣，環境非常好。離海邊很近，步行五分鐘就是一大片沙灘小朋友特別喜歡。不得不説沒有商業化的海口海灘真的很值得躺平度假~親子游遛娃強推~

管家蛋蛋提前一天打電話來確認到達酒店時間，便於提前準備好房間，也會了解對於房間床品的喜好～非常貼心，因為我衹住一天，所以衹有一個要求：海景好一些的房間。
入住前還有些擔心酒店設施會不會太舊，會不會有黴味；直到入住打開房間的那一刻，打消了一切顧慮。
陽台打開，無敵大海景…太喜歡了…吹着海風…很愜意～

異味：一進屋就一股異味，床鋪被子全是潮的，一股子黴味，冰箱打開有臭了的海鮮味道。
空氣：非常潮濕悶熱，房間內比陽台還熱。空調完全不好使，房間像個蒸籠一樣，大堂也不開空調，氣温將近30度，整個酒店開空調的空間沒幾個。
找酒店要了一個除濕器 一個風扇，依舊又熱又潮
下水道：淋浴間下水道幾乎不通水，沖個澡水漫金山

2.衞生較差，枕頭有牆皮脱落，牀頭櫃下居然還有煙灰果殼，作為豪華品牌，簡直不可想象。
3.空調效果較差，面板居然無法控温。維修後略微好轉。
4.婚禮活動安排不合理，草坪婚禮位於客房中間，居然可以允許麥克風大聲活動至晚上9點半，後交涉後於8點40左右停止使用麥克風。
5.房間門難開無比，一般小朋友和女生基本開不了。
總結作為這個價位的酒店，非常不推薦

③跟朋友同樣訂單，我的房間特別小，他的房間就很空曠，還不規則。
④我們住在東翼，吃早餐要先去3樓大堂，去西翼坐電梯再去吃飯，能繞**。

msg:作為萬豪系列打卡者，這次海口行帶着一老一小一同體驗這家，整個過程都很棒，推薦給大家～
入住前，行政酒廊的工作人員Jessie會提前電話溝通確認入住時間和需求，我們到的時候房間早已提前準備好了，房型給了升級，海景房，日出日落盡收眼底；抵達後，無論硬件設施還是軟件服務都可圈可點。地理位置靠近CDF免税城，有接駁車和相應優惠券，臨近海灘和會展中心。停車場地面地上都有，車位數量足夠，空間很寬敞，也有充電車位；
建築風格是大唐之風，非常大氣。內部裝修雖然有些年頭略顯陳舊，但優質的服務加分很多。
餐廳餐品種類多，口味也OK，建議大家避開早高峯用餐時間段，這樣體驗會很好些，另外，不得不提一下面檔的師傅，很耐心介紹不同口味，即使排隊隊伍宂長，也絲毫沒有不耐煩，煮麪的同時關注着食客需求，貼心提醒大家排隊，引導好秩序，看得出對工作的認真負責。
户外泳池很適合親子，有工作人員不定時巡邏，時刻關注需求和大家的安全。
行程結束後，不論是Jessie還是總部萬豪服務人員都有致電，詢問入住體驗和建議～
有一處有進步空間的可能就是電梯了，我們住的這片可能就那一部實在有點慢。
總體來説推薦大家 適合親子游～

泳池兩個，成人和生態的泳池分開，生態泳池旁邊有一個小動物園。
早餐種類豐富。
酒店過一個路口就是海灘，有沙灘。周邊是會展中心的幾條小路，修的很漂亮，很安靜，非常適合休閑放鬆。出行可以坐免税店的免費班車。
Fiona服務很貼心，各種小需求都能及時響應。
總得來説，符合五星豪華酒店的標準，景色風光很好，很安靜，適合家庭親子度假。

酒店位置很好，離碼頭近，離免税店近，附近也有大型商超，交通便利！近期過海的小車很多，時不時有交通管制，這點不太好！
酒店是中式風格，建築宏偉大氣
環境沒得説，景色也非常不錯，海景很美麗，花園環境乾淨且整潔！

很感謝前台Miranda思蓉，到店時熱情的接待讓人歡喜，且我提出來的任何需求都能一一幫我解決，這讓我此次入住非常開心，值得推薦的酒店，希望越來越好！

環境：環境挺好的，大堂一進門就感受到了復古的濃厚的中式風格氣息房間佈置的也比較用心~
進入房間感覺很好，乾淨，整潔，躺床上看海的感覺很好！對於帶孩子的家庭房間的配品建議多放水，抽紙，這個是非常關鍵的！
設施：房間設施老舊但完善，建議配備暖氣功能，除濕機。
以上為我的入住體驗，下次會再回來入住的！

設施：酒店温泉温度很高，晚上去泡感覺很爽。不過漂流目前是沒有的。另外酒店裝修有點舊。
服務：整體服務還算不錯，不過要吐槽下泳池產品租賃服務。臂圈和浮板等基本游泳裝備還要收費有點對不起五星級酒店的服務啊。雖然收費不算貴，但是有點對不起五星級親子酒店的名頭啊。三亞同類酒店沒見過這類產品收費的，服務細節上還有提升的空間。

酒店內有泳池，環境不錯，房間很寬敞，海景陽台沒得説。如果電梯廳空調再涼快點就更好了，辦理入住的工作人員再多點，高峯期的體驗會更好。旁邊沙灘挺大，可以趕海抓螃蟹和海螺，貌似海口市區沒什麼海水浴場，這裏也不好下海，可以體驗沙灘遊戲。

非常感謝管家Norah，入住前會提前一天聯繫加微信，還給房間升級。
酒店也有需要提高的地方
1.免費送的水從百事的礦泉水換成海南的椰樹水會更好些。因為那個百事的水好像質量非常一般。
2.早晚餐自助餐人少還好，人多容易混亂，也沒有人去管和有效的疏通安排。
3.鮮榨果汁在萬豪這個級別，按理是要放在免費果汁區的，而不是用瓶裝飲料來敷衍。
4.早晚餐的種類比較少，需要增加。切片麪包時間要注意新鮮程度，我烤了一片，拿的還是中間的，烤出來的麪包片比硬殼紙還硬。

其他沒了，管家服務很好

入住體驗：入住前coya就聯繫確定了住房需求並做了房型升級，溝通非常愉快，到的比較早，如果有跟我一樣的，要最早九點可以辦入住（有房間的情況下）
，游泳池，餐飲都很好，離海灘也近，西海岸人不多，整體感覺還是很舒適。
環境：環境整體設計沒得説，畢竟豪華型酒店，但有個問題就是大堂設計大而無當（這邊五星級分級好像都存在這個問題，為了高大上而高大上），沒有製冷設備，海口又高温高濕，像我這種在酒店大堂逗留的旅客就待的很難受，看怎麼調整可以體驗好一些。
同樣是設計的問題，酒店從大堂到兩翼客房，距離相當遠其實，而且吧走廊設計是露天敞開式的，在夏天的海口，你哪怕衹是出去樓下吃個早午餐不出酒店大樓的情況下，滿頭大汗是沒法避免的，真的很……不優雅，但是吧這種硬設計的問題確實又很難改。
還是讓人有些小遺憾。
酒店入住也會有回訪，這些問題也提了，希望能有心去調整一下吧。

msg:設施：酒店設施齊全，吃喝玩樂都OK。房間配套很齊全，房間也很大，寬敞，床品巨舒服，休息的很好。酒店房間打掃的很好，衞生間有地暖，地面乾的很快，不用擔心會滑倒。酒店也有自己的中餐廳和西餐廳，我們最喜歡在酒店的大堂吧，看着大概喝着飲料，心情舒暢。

服務：酒店服務也很好，自駕游去海南，開車到酒店門口，門僮就非常主動積極幫我們拿行李，幫我們存放和配送到房間。這裏我們的酒店管家Coya非常好，瞭解了我們是一家三口入住，不吸煙，就幫我們升級了豪華海景房，同時還送了很多免税店的購物券，關鍵還送了3份自助早餐給我們，實在太感謝啦！

環境：酒店的綠化非常好，酒店中間有一片綠草坪，可以休閑的逛逛，在草坪玩。由於酒店綠化好，樹蔭擋住大太陽，全天任何時候都能去泳池玩，中午下午玩都不會覺得曬。

購物：這次購物最爽就是到海口國際免税城，個人認為比三亞好逛太多了，購物餐飲集中，不會像三亞免税城那樣餐飲不方便。海口國際免税城目前還有一些品牌門店裝修中，Gucci和Prada在裝修，彩粧珠寶都可以買的到。目前海南免税店可以部分商品自提了，同時海口南港也可以離島提貨了，很方便哦。

第一：酒店配套也很好，有温泉，有泳池，時間也很人性化可以提供到晚上11點。真的是住過的酒店裡麪時間最長的，酒店內的環境也很好，隨便抓拍都是美景。
第二：服務也是真的沒話説，沒入住就有經理Fiona的電話諮詢入住時間等，並且加微信，隨時解決問題。
第三：酒店的自助餐也十分給力，這個價格裏面能吃的東西是非常全的。感覺賺翻翻的樣子。
總結，本人是超級建議來入住的酒店哦，賦圖如下，窗外的海景，酒店的温泉。
