This is my third time to stay at Primus and it’s always pleasant and comfortable stay! I stayed Business room this time and it was so refreshing and spacious with almost 180° windows that enabled us to see the outside! Thank you for arranging the room for us and we fully enjoyed 2 nights! Always stuffs are kind and polite. 
Especially I would like to send special thanks for cleaning lady she was very flexible and kind when she came to our room for cleaning. Her warm and polite service was very pleasant and made our stay extra wonderful. Hotel is very fortunate to have her as a cleaning lady who work so hard for each guest with service spirit! 
Only thing I felt a bit sad was that due to the last weekend before school starts the breakfast was a bit simplified for the first day so the option wasn’t exactly same. And the swimming pool was closed…

But other than that it was an another beautiful experience of stay and I will definitely come back for next opportunity!

msg:I will give all one-star negative reviews. Let me start by saying that I am not a negative review fraudster. I have an Alipay credit score of 850+ and I stay in 5-star or above hotels all year round! It’s not a show off, just a background explanation! 1. Poor hygiene. The dust on the bedside table was not wiped clean. 2. Poor attitude. When I wanted to pack some fruits for breakfast, I was told that I would not take them with me after I had eaten them. This is really not even as good as Atour’s cheap hotel. 3. The food is bad. This is how The banana I ate in the picture was uncooked and the corn was very hard! 4. The service is very unprofessional, and many details can be seen. I asked you to bring a chair to the room and push it directly with your feet! There are many star-rated hotels, but not many as bad as this one! Let’s talk about the room price of 1860 yuan. It is recommended that the platform lower the recommended value. Customers like me who have requirements for hotels are advised to be cautious!

The curtains are not as tidy and clean as those of the Hanting Hotel. The hair dryer is sometimes windy and sometimes the power is cut off. The bathroom 🚽 toilet design is excellent. The toilet flush button is behind the toilet lid. You have to hold the lid to flush the toilet.

On the contrary, a short-haired cleaning lady didn't know if it was disturbing her rest. When she gave me slippers, she directly threw them on the floor for me. Her expression asked her to throw away my old slippers, but she acted like she didn’t hear anything. Hahaha, I was scared to death. The cleaning uncle praised her! Come out and play the main game!

msg:This hotel is basically okay, but the price is double during the exhibition period but the service is not better. I really don’t think it’s worth it. The quality of the front desk needs to be improved.
On the night of check-in on 3/5, the hair dryer was malfunctioning and could not be used. I called the service center for the first time and they came to replace it right away. However, they told me that it was normal for the hair dryer to become hot and unusable after being blown for a long time. They told me to wait for it to cool down before trying again. , please, I haven’t even started blowing, and there’s already a sensor problem. What’s more, a hotel that costs 1,900 yuan a night tells me that the quality of your hair dryer is so low that you can’t use it when it gets hot. Isn’t this ridiculous?
Then I happened to see that the pillow could be changed into different pillows. After 30-40 minutes, I asked the waiter to give me a pillow. At this time, the housekeeping attitude became a little impatient.
An hour later, after drinking two bottles of mineral water in my room, I asked someone to deliver it to the service center, but he responded to Mr. Cai, "What's the matter?"
No one in the IHG MARRIOT group where I have stayed would have this kind of response. Moreover, your price today is 1,900 RMB per night, which is even more expensive than these two group hotels. The service is so average and the Cp value is very low. Finally The female front desk girl who wanted to call me Xiao Wang or Xiao Huang when I wanted to check out also wanted to grab my phone and leave a positive review. I really couldn't understand what this action meant. It was very rude!

Facilities: The overall design of the hotel is very fashionable, the facilities are very new, and the appearance is grand. The room is clean and hygienic, equipped with a bathtub. The overall size of the room is large, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are also very comfortable. When you stay in the room, you can feel that the a**osphere is not oppressive.
The style design of the lobby bar is even more fashionable, and the pool and the lobby complement each other. The check-in procedure at the front desk was fast and introduced the functions of the hotel. The swimming pool, gymnasium and restaurant were all mentioned, very considerate, and Christine at the front desk was very quick to handle.
Tony at the front desk also makes people feel at home, and I am very much looking forward to my next stay!

The overall experience was very bad and I will never go to this hotel again. ￼￼The reception staff did not pay attention to etiquette when checking out in the morning.

The parking lot is very spacious and there are many vacant parking spaces. We parked in the parking space closer to the elevator entrance. Came to the information counter on the first floor to check in. The lady who received us was Cara, who was very active, enthusiastic, gentle, and answered my questions patiently, which is worthy of praise. We booked a super superior queen room, and were lucky to get a free upgrade to a business queen room. The room is large, well-equipped, clean and tidy.

Xiaoqi and Brown were the ones who received us. From the initial call to the check-in, they were very warm and thoughtful. In addition, I really thank you. The next day the car was too early to have breakfast, but they helped me coordinate the breakfast of the day, so happy 😁In terms of hotel facilities, the parent-child room really surprises the baby, and the swimming pool also meets the swimming needs of the baby and her father. The breakfast and buffet dinner are exquisite, and the whole thing is satisfying. It's really nice to find such a hotel in Magic~ It must be a five-star praise!

msg:The environment and service are very good. There are many types of breakfast, and the taste is also remarkable. However, due to seasonal reasons, it is understandable that the hotel's air conditioners are not cooled, but it is difficult to accept that there is no ventilation. Heating will be delivered continuously. Because the room is a closed window, it is very stuffy. After negotiating with the hotel, there was no fan, and a humidifier was sent, but it was also broken, no water mist was produced at all, and the noise was very loud. But it was also troublesome for the hotel to take me to see if other rooms needed to be changed, and in the end I chose the original room.
I left a message when I made the reservation that I need pillows that are not too soft, but there were none when I entered the room. I called the hotel, and the hotel said that all the pillows have been borrowed. I said that I had already left the message in advance, and finally gave it to me. send it.
Also the bathtub was stained.
Overall, the service attitude is acceptable, but the facilities and equipment are not satisfactory. It is understandable to be too busy during the Spring Festival, and the experience will be better during the working days.

I personally think the food is ok for the buffet dinner, but if it is based on the original price, it is still a little expensive. Although there are many opinions on the Internet, I personally think that except for the small crayfish, everything else is ok, the service attitude is also good, and the problem is solved. fast.
The room is super luxurious, but we are on different floors, and the size is similar. Maybe the design and decoration specifications are different!

msg:It is the first time to write a bad review after working with Ctrip for so many years. The accommodation experience this time is really bad, mainly because of the service. Is the front desk phone a decoration? I made a reservation for a hotel room six hours in advance. Ctrip has an order record. I called for a long time, but no one answered the hotel front desk. After that, I told Ctrip that there was no order, and then I contacted Ctrip customer service. Ctrip customer service called the hotel front desk and said it was a problem with the hotel system. Having breakfast this morning, I wanted to ask which floor the hotel breakfast is on. The hotel phone was never answered. Finally, I contacted the Ctrip housekeeper, but the Ctrip housekeeper could not contact the front desk of the hotel either. This is luxury hotel service. Booked a deluxe room, the refrigerator is full of charges, but only two bottles of mineral water are sent. With such a poor global economy, can hotels still survive with such poor service? Could it be that it depends on Greenland, a state-owned enterprise tree, it doesn't matter if the business is good or bad, I won't go there again next time, too bad!

The second is the higher price-performance ratio of the buffet dinner for two people included in the room rate. There is still a big gap between the hotel service and the orthodox five-star. Although there is an initiative to provide room type upgrades, it is of little significance, because the area of the room facilities remains unchanged, but the floor is raised (it is better not to upgrade). Simply put, if you come to stay, don't ask for any service. Because of the service, the hotel will not make people want to stay again.

msg:[Services] From the front desk to the restaurant to the gym, I didn't meet a single employee who was enthusiastic. I felt that they were doing routine work, and I couldn't see a smile. Especially the front desk, there was no greeting, the expression was rigid, and the words were like gold, the only one who walked. The cleaning aunt was more polite. The overall impression is not enthusiastic, it doesn't matter.
[Room] Advantages: It is quite large, higher than the general five-star standard, and the bed is comfortable. Disadvantages: The ceiling nozzles in the bathroom are blocked, and two-thirds of the water cannot come out, so you can only use the hand-held nozzles; the bath towels are those of the express hotel, and the edges are fluffed, which is very stretched! Not to mention toothbrush and toothpaste, and there is little hard toothpaste, which is also the standard of express hotels. Besides, there are only one or two overseas TV channels, not even Phoenix News, but the National Exhibition and Convention Center next to it! This is the position?
[Buffet Dinner] Advantages: good taste, no thunder, popular dishes are served quickly, porridge is rich, fruits are sweet, and most importantly, desserts are rich and delicious! I, a person who never eats hotel desserts, couldn't help but ask for two, especially when I found a secret treasure, the "apple roll" hidden in the corner, it still tasted like freshly baked, even the small plates were filled with Hot, sweet and sour taste, very pleasant surprise, is the best meal in my opinion for buffet dinner. Disadvantages: The ingredients are not generous, all the dishes are, there are few sashimi, the thinnest salmon I have ever seen, the taste is not good, there are only two juices for the drink, and the overall selection is less.
【Breakfast Buffet】The part that annoys me the most. Advantages: rich drinks, all kinds of dairy products, bread. Disadvantages: It is written that 9:30 is the best time to eat, but when it came to 9:30, the fried dumplings were gone, and other popular choices were at least half less. Ordered noodles, asked if there was beef noodles, the waiter who cooked the noodles impatiently Answer: No beef noodles. Well, then I want a fried egg, I want a one-sided egg, three pushes and four trays, and in the end I almost made a noise on the table before frying it for me. Fried rice was hard, no fried noodles with fried noodles (don't know if it was finished). Quite unpleasant to eat.
[Summary] Considering the price, it is not too bad, it can only be said to be average.

msg:Due to the epidemic, I dare not go out of town now, so I want to find a hotel in Shanghai to relax for two days. I thought that Shanghai should be one level higher than other hotels of the same level in other places in terms of management and service, but it turned out that there are too many flaws, so I will complain about the ones I can think of first.

First, there are too many people checking in, and there is no one outside the counter to maintain order. A bunch of old people gathered around the front desk, and the young staff at the counter looked overwhelmed. The person behind me jumped in line to check in at the counter, and no one took care of it at all. After I checked in, the waiter didn't tell me which elevator to take, so I asked an employee who was chatting with foreign employees. She pointed me to the restaurant without asking my room number, and only when I went up did I realize I was going the wrong way. , my room has to go back to the third floor and cross the corridor to the other side of the building. Only later did I know that the customer service is divided into T1 and T2, but there is no sign in the lobby, and no staff has taken this into account. The employees I met in the elevator bowed their heads and played with their mobile phones the whole time without saying hello. There is no basic courtesy.

Second, I felt very hot when I entered the room. I found that the air conditioner could not adjust the temperature, and I could not adjust the temperature. Moreover, the room only had floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides, no small windows, and no ventilation. The room temperature was kept at 28-29 degrees. It is both wasteful and not considered for the guests.

Third, the toilet design is speechless. When the toilet lid is opened, the flush button is covered, which means that the toilet cannot be flushed until the toilet lid is put down. Why is there such an anti-human design!

Fourth, there is a thin layer of ash in the entire room where there is a desktop, the first day and the second day, and the hygiene standard is low.

Fifth, there are not many varieties of breakfast, and the waiter's attitude is not good. I asked if there were wontons. A female employee said no without raising her head. I said help me with a bowl of noodles. What I'm looking for is that I don't cook noodles, and I'm reluctant to cook noodles after being taught a few words by the person in charge.

As a hotel next to the National Exhibition and Convention Center, there must be a lot of exhibitors who usually stay there. Maybe there are foreign friends staying at the CIIE. How can it reflect Shanghai's standards, or will it be treated differently?

It shows 31 degrees. Because there is no window, it is very hot. It is recommended to open the meeting door and "cooler". I originally thought it was a high-end club, enjoying the trea**ent of the executive lounge, but during the epidemic, the executive lounge was arranged to live in the lobby bar, which was replaced by 2 cakes and 2 drinks, which was disappointing. The hotel's breakfast is quite satisfactory. Recommended chicken soup dumplings, fried pork chops, and desserts are small hemp balls and sweet corn.

There is a baby swimming pool in the bathroom, as well as a sauna. The a**osphere is very good, and the attitude of the service staff is also professional. It is not easy for the service to reach this level during the Chinese New Year. There are too many people for breakfast and the banquet hall is opened in time for emergency. But the level of breakfast is not 100% guaranteed. The kids love it and will come again next time.

Executive courtesy Because the executive lounge is not open, a small area is designated for the western food bar on the first floor, only cold food is provided, and afternoon tea only provides set menus. Although the overall price/performance ratio is acceptable, the experience is poor, the breakfast experience is extremely poor, the overall service is relatively rough, does not pay attention to details, and is not suitable for vacation.

Primus Hotel is very good in all aspects, the rooms have large bathtubs, the hotel has a swimming pool and is currently open, which is better than Beilv, the only drawback of the room is that there is no capsule coffee machine;
The ambient temperature of the hotel is very comfortable, especially when the swimming pool temperature is moderate, it will not be cold when the water is launched.
The bakery produces very good, salads, fruit box cuts, and croissants are all of high quality
There is a 58-yuan noodle buffet for lunch, including drinks, fruits and desserts. It is especially suitable for guests who wake up late and have no time to eat breakfast. The restaurant manager is very kind and showed me around the restaurant and introduced it.

The geographical position has the advantage, the hotel is well decorated, the facilities are quite new, the service is also very good, and the hotel is warm and courteous. It is important to praise the self-pickup counter for express delivery. I have to say that during the epidemic, this measure is really great. With the pickup code, go directly to the corner cabinet in the lobby on the 1st floor to pick it up. It not only guarantees indirect contact, but also protects privacy. Great.

msg:That's right, I deliberately gave bad products!
On the 29th, I saw that there was a Halloween Carnival in Bright.
He also called the Zhuoyue Western Restaurant to book a dinner on the 30th. I also specifically asked if it was a buffet for Halloween events, and wanted to bring the children to have fun together. The waiter said yes and reserved a place for us!
Just because I confirmed it, I decided to stay at the No. 30 Platinum hotel.
As a result, 6pm on the 30th (it was told to open at 6pm when making a reservation)
We went to the restaurant, said we had a meal and made an appoin**ent. As a result, the waiter said that he had made an appoin**ent and registration for us was wrong. There is no buffet today, only team meals (Borui has a medical exhibition). Say we can't eat! ! !

I'm so mad. Because I confirmed that I can, I booked a hotel. When I came here, you said the registration was wrong.

The children are looking forward to participating in the Halloween event. This is the result? ? ?

You deserve this bad review. Must receive!

The little brother Tason at the front desk is very nice. Arrived at the hotel early, although it is not yet check-in time, still check in for me first. Just as the China International Import Expo was about to open, the younger brother was still attentive to help solve the problem. There is also a gift of SPA voucher, the time is a bit tight and there is no time to experience it. Recommend to stay! Will come again next time

The hotel fee we pay includes the cost of resting and playing, but even our children were not satisfied with this hotel to the extent that it was not good. For family travellers, please choose another hotel.
The swimming pool is a long walk from the elevator, and after checking in on the 3rd floor, you have to walk up one floor to get the locker key. You can't even eat fruit while playing in the water, and you can't even play with a ball tube.

🍃Environment: The overall decoration is also possible, and the environment is still very good after upgrading to a suite! ! Very satisfied! But the soundproofing aspect needs to be strengthened. The bedroom has another door, which is suspected to be connected to the next room. Someone in the next room can hear a cough. If there is a sound at night, I worry about the door being opened.

🔔Service: I am satisfied with upgrading the suite. I think the attitude of the front desk is also okay. The attitude of the service staff in the restaurant is average.

Ms. Bella Liu Tingting stayed at the front desk at 8 in the evening and was very enthusiastic. She helped to upgrade the room type. The food and beverage information and knowledge of other hotel products were also introduced comprehensively. The big thing is that the switchboard operator is very polite, unlike before, he didn't even have the least honorific title, which is worthy of praise. The eldest sister of the guest room is as warm and thoughtful as ever. If the room is hygienic, there are still dust in some details, and the pool is very crowded. Haha The two lifeguards are also very responsible for patrolling to ensure the safety of the guests.

1. The toilet is separated from the bathroom, which is very convenient.
2. The bed is really super big. It should be made up of two 1.2-meter Jin Keer mattresses, so that the width of the bed can reach 2.4 meters, which is amazing!
3. The hotel's swimming pool is well received, and there are bath towels and bottled water in the closet of the dressing room. There is also a place to take a bath and sauna for a good swim.

I will stay for one night near the Great Hongqiao National Convention and Exhibition Center on Friday. The hotel is in a good location and the transportation is very convenient. The Hongqiao Tianjie Shopping Mall is also nearby, which is very convenient for eating and playing. We arrived after get off work in the evening. Christine at the front desk handled the check-in in an orderly manner. The service attitude was very good. The room type was upgraded for free. The room was large, clean and tidy. The decoration looked relatively new and the maintenance was good. The design of the lobby is very distinctive, very beautiful, suitable for taking pictures and punching in. The breakfast dishes are also richer and taste good, but they are within the expected range. Before checking out the next day, I went to the Greenland Trade Port for a round trip. They were all the exhibition halls of various countries promoted by the CIIE. They were displayed and sold here. However, it may be the recent epidemic. There are basically no people. I bought it at the Japan Pavilion. The snacks I ordered are gone, and it may not be lively until the CIIE. In short, it was a good experience.

msg:For summer five-star hotels, the price-performance ratio is super high, and the hotel hardware and software, and customer service must be praised! I didn't see a price increase over the weekend.
The overall design of the hotel is very holiday-like. Besides the Chinese and Western food, there are also BICE special Italian food. The taste of the Italian food has subverted previous perceptions. When the child can be treated as a human being respected, and the service is caring like family care, my heart is full of warmth and touch. Knowing that the children do not eat odorous dishes, they deliberately put the sesame on the menu, and did not neglect the slightest because of the approaching end of business hours on the day. Four waiters and two chefs treat them with friendship. At that moment, I truly believed that the founder's original intentions had never been discounted, and that some of the foundational culture and ingenuity were worth seeing and being respected. Pizza is recommended for Wall Crack! The breakfast is rich in variety, and the rice roll is a rare variety. The little brother in the noodle stall is really too busy. It is wontons and noodles, different soups, and various vegetables. It can only be caused by taking care of the guests’ individual choices. In the case of waiting in line, it is recommended to add a stove and cook.
The room is big enough and fully furnished. The depth of the swimming pool + hot pool is very suitable for children. The fly in the oin**ent, maybe during the epidemic, the swimming pool registration has to go down half a flight of stairs, and you have to climb up again after registration. It is a bit inconvenient to wear slippers and bathrobes. The child brought his own floating stick, and the registration and entrance were not allowed, and there were no floating accessories that could be rented in it. The child was very aggrieved. I went to ask about the lifeguard brother, but my brother said very readily...the rules should be unified, and if you are not allowed to bring your own, you should be equipped with related equipment.
The setting of the water bar is very artistic, the heart is quiet, and the refreshments are good. There are also many meeting space options.
All in all, the service is as always, the price is constant, and it will definitely be used again.

Experience this package on Ctrip~ I feel very good. Yesterday, when we entered the hotel, the lobby was amazing to us~ the front desk customer service Nick welcomed us warmly and thoughtfully. The room was clean and comfortable. In the afternoon, we took the children to the swimming pool on the third floor, which made us adults and children have a great time. , The pool water is clean and clear, mainly because there are few people (unlike other hotels in summer vacation pools are children who learn to swim). The dinner buffet in the evening was so satisfying, the ingredients were fresh~the variety was great~I was very satisfied. When something happened to the front desk this morning, Nick, the handsome guy, asked about our feelings about staying in the store as soon as we met. Anyway, we enjoyed the time between entering the store and leaving the store. The Primus Five-Star Hotel in Hongqiao Greenland is worthy of its name.
I still want to come again~ As a result, the package on Ctrip was removed from the shelves 😡

The location of the hotel is very good. It is very close to the airport and the railway station. It is convenient for people catching planes and trains. There is the Hongqiao Tiandi business district nearby. If you don't want to eat at the hotel, there are many delicious foods there.
Fortunately, I upgraded the room type and got a corner room. The area is very large. When I enter the door, the electric curtains on both sides of the door open automatically, which makes the field of view extremely wide. There are many kinds of drinks (but there is a charge), bathrobes and bath towels feel a little hard, and the bed and pillows are extremely soft and comfortable.
Although the hotel is very close to the airport, no noise is heard. Sleeping at night is quite quiet. The entire hotel is very large. At this time, it feels that there are not many people and the buildings are relatively new. If you have time, you can go shopping.
Check-in and check-out are also very fast.

And the service...Only Lassie at the front desk saw me staying for a long time this time, and it was the second time I came. The upgrade was arranged, which was gratifying. The room continued to deal with the front desk staff, and I felt that the communication with the front desk staff was very friendly, smooth and efficient!

The tall girl who cleans my room on the 9th floor every day is also cheerful and talkative.

We arrived at the hotel with a lot of luggage, but there was no helper at the door of the hotel, and we couldn't find any staff to help us when we entered the hotel. There is no one in the concierge. Maybe the hotel is difficult to recruit? Extremely short of people, right? But if this is part of an unannounced visit, it would be a zero score, right?

Because of the long stay, I see hotel managers with the same face walking around every day, whether in the elevator or on the way to the lobby. Every day you take the elevator, the hotel manager will take the elevator with you, or when you go down, stop at the banquet hall on the third floor and come up to the hotel manager. To my surprise, I have never met any hotel manager who greeted me. They were like passers-by or guests. The only time I stopped on the third floor and came up to greet me friendly was the master of the hotel engineering depar**ent, which instantly warmed my heart. It turns out that the hotel still has a heartwarming service.

I am not a picky person, but I have high expectations for local five-star hotels, especially the real estate and operation management of Greenland Group, which will get better and better. Service can become more and more heartwarming.

周邊有閔行博物館和寶龍美術館、海派藝術館可以一逛，也有虹橋天地，七寶老街之類的商區，總體還是不錯的。

msg:忙的太晚，臨時決定在上海住一晚，看附近的商業和餐飲還是比較豐富的，第二天去虹橋站也比較方便，就訂了這家酒店。
  入住的時候稍慢，一開始等的有點不耐煩了，但仔細一看，看到前面是外國人，前台在很耐心的和外國友人溝通和辦理入住，也就沒什麼脾氣了。能理解。
  並且到我入住的時候，辦理十分迅速，還給我免費升級了很好的房型，特別意外，讓人覺得酒店的整體服務態度這塊是真的很好很好。
  房間沒什麼問題，特別好，很大很舒服，如果不是第二天趕着要走我都想再住一晚好好休息一下了。
  提一個小建議，酒店太大了，並且旁邊就是綠地旗下的別的酒店，相關電梯的引導指示和酒店大門的引導指示還可以做得再清晰一點，我進出一趟結果走錯酒店了，名字太像了。另一家好像叫鉑驪，都是綠地旗下的，晚上沒細看確實容易走錯。

設施及餐飲：酒店泳池也非常乾淨，一樓大堂的天幕非常有特色，晚餐海鮮非常豐富、有大龍蝦和蟹腳。
服務：兩位員工李羅昕和龔蘇潔，在入住和退房時全程跟進，很是貼心。

1，隔音非常差。旁邊屋説話，大笑，樓道里關門。大半夜分分鐘把你吵起來
2，吹飛機。 一千一晚的房間，吹風機堪比 200 一晚的。吹出來的風強度堪比用嘴吹出來的風。啥年代了，還在這上省錢呢。別的城市一千一晚的都用戴森了。真的想笑
3，168 的早餐，跟別的城市50 塊的早餐差不多檔次。不能説啥也沒有吧。。能吃飽。

這好像是個集團公司，順道開了個酒店，很難評真的。以後還是去專業大公司的酒店吧。

1.這個酒店幾個電梯，前台開卡給我，我竟然找不到房間，也沒有提示也沒有指引，他們好幾個電梯，通往不同房間。我找錯了地方下來，本來也沒啥，我問一下就可以了。可是我看到一個外國人開了房卡之後有服務員主動高高興興地帶他們去找房間。
2.上海下大雨，我問禮賓能不能借把傘，禮賓員説我的傘都被你們借光了，你們房間裏不是有傘？ 好吧，你們的傘被借光了不是我的錯。房間裏有傘你告訴我就可以了。我會上去拿的。
我不是一個多事的顧客，極少去會去麻煩酒店的工作人員。但是我鄙視這個酒店的服務人員。我覺得他們對不起這份工作！

大堂吧的服務人員服務和態度很滿意，有問題諮詢都馬上幫我去詢問。
客房服務的工作人員最滿意。

總的來説，對不起這個價格，也不配這個價格………. 3天小一萬？鉑瑞坐地起價這塊兒還是拿捏的死死的！🤢🤢🤢

但是也有明顯的槽點。所以不會給5星好評。
比如服務中心的定價離譜，那兒的人的態度確實比較差。
打印一張黑白紙居然要10塊錢，這也是夠黑的。實在搞不清楚為啥要定這麼離譜的價格，難道是為了彰顯自己的身價麼？
這些小事，反正你定10塊錢一張也掙不了幾個錢，但定便宜點，比如一塊錢（畢竟成本也就幾分錢的事，相對成本來講，實際上1塊是也不低了。），更加方便顧客了，不是會更加得到肯定麼？
反正這10塊錢，實在是黑得不能再黑。體驗極差！

msg:作為一家五星級酒店硬件整體是OK的，也比較新，我訂的是商務大床房，酒店前台給升級成了套房，這點值得肯定，不過當晚入住率並不高，可能也是進博會剛開完的原因。入住房間衞生還不錯，各個角落都看了一下，沒有特別大的問題，床品標準很高，睡起來很舒服，符合五星級的標準。
來説説酒店的問題，房間裏礦泉水衹放了兩瓶，作為套房實屬不應該，辦公椅子扶手有明顯的修補痕跡，看得很難受，建議直接更換。（1036房間）早餐種類太少，檔口服務員沒有主動服務意識，一些四星的酒店可能都比鉑瑞做的要好，不能因為酒店入住率低就影響自身酒店的品質。
最讓我感到意外的是，整個酒店從大堂開始客人走過，沒有任何一個工作人員會主動向酒店客人問好，包括客房部。當天晚上下樓拿外賣的時候問了禮賓部小哥，問取餐櫃在哪，他沒有第一時間回答我，抬頭看了我一眼，就指了指身後的方向，沒有任何稱呼和禮貌用語，就回了一句直走到到底左轉，然後他就繼續低頭看他的手機了。（如下圖）從來沒有遇到這樣的服務特別是出現在一個連鎖五星級酒店裡。這服務可能比全季和亞朵都不如吧，非常驚訝，這樣的酒店哪怕硬件設施再好我想不是站在國家會展中心靠山吃山的話很難能夠有回頭客啊，現在酒店就是拼服務，如果最最起碼的一句問候都沒有，我覺得可能整個管理層都出現了問題，而且這個問題是致命的。
説了那麼多，我是希望酒店方能夠引起重視，不斷改進自身服務，提升自己的競爭力，另外也要提醒一下，這麼大的酒店沒有小童牙刷，真的很不應該，畢竟酒店前台還豎著迪士尼合作酒店。

酒店裝修環境很不錯。大堂都是大理石的。天幕吧的環境最棒。特別是水池裡的沙發位子。上座率很高。特意挑了大堂吧下班後晚上八點多去拍照。這個時候還有綠化工來消毒和澆水。

房間很新。浴室和馬桶是分開的。浴缸很大。泡澡很舒服。沐浴的洗漱用品質量也不錯的。拖鞋穿着很舒服。

房間內提供兩瓶水。喝完了客房好了兩瓶，客房阿姨直接給四瓶。大氣！很棒！👍

唯一要吐槽的是衞生！為撒現在五星酒酒店內的衞生都搞得那麼的馬虎呢？現在疫情客房衞生都沒有疫情錢做的好啊。很多死角都是灰塵！哎！這個衞生是我要扣分的地方！其他都很好！

msg:節假日對酒店服務、設施都是考驗，所以不是所有的酒店運營都可以列入五星範圍。
環境設施：酒店整體設施齊全，但因為節假日入住，讓整體氛圍感下降不少。
服務：基層員工整體服務不錯，保潔和前台會熱情的打招呼，服務態度也可以，但酒店運營高層（外國人）態度非常惡劣，也是奇葩，第一次在高端酒店見到這樣的管理層。
第一，哪條法律規定小朋友不能踩平衡車。
第二，在酒店的公共區域也沒有見到禁止行為的書面通知，在酒店辦理入住時也沒有前台人員口頭通知不可以騎平衡車。
第三，如果酒店有要求那也可以好好説話温馨提醒，而不是對着小孩子冷臉制止，這是從事服務行業的人的職業行為嗎？
第四，如果不能騎平衡車，那也可以安排服務人員幫忙用行李車送回房間，畢竟那麼重的平衡車對大人來説提着也很困難。外國人太搞笑了，除了吼小孩，不帶任何解決方案，這是把上海當他自己的了。
反而在入住整個體驗過程中，中國員工的整體素質比外國人好，任何事都微笑服務，建議酒店儘快開除這樣的高層，服務性行業如果連良好的溝通和服務都不具備的話，這樣的酒店也沒人願意第二次入住。

地鐵站下來走幾分鐘就到了，酒店旁邊還有公交車站，交通便利，可以去夏都小鎮逛吃。

房間很大，床更大，雙床應該都是一米五的，很舒適。

酒店早餐很豐盛，自助晚餐不太行，服務還不錯，強烈推薦！

msg:我很少給酒店打低分，但是我確實覺得這酒店很過分。簡單説，兩件事，1.前台問我是否需要酒店用品，我理解是為了環保，我是臨時沒有走成所以必須要領酒店用品。領了用品入住洗澡的時候發現浴室裏的浴液沒有了，我估計是打掃衞生的阿姨沒有注意是個空浴液瓶子，人已經沖淋了，也沒法出來叫人送了，我就簡單沖了一下。出來發現梳子也沒有，難道你們的客人洗過澡都用手指梳頭嗎？再環保也不能把基本配置去掉吧。2.下面重點來了，當天白天我在酒店參加個開業活動，大腿莫名其妙有點拉傷，活動期間沒有吃飽，晚上我就叫了個外賣。外賣到了不讓外賣送進來（我表示對於酒店這個管理很理解）。然後我就打電話請服務中心安排送一下（因為大腿拉傷行動不便）。服務中心轉接到禮賓部，才十一點已經沒人接電話了。再打前台也沒人接，然後再次轉另一個前台，一個男士接了電話表示公司規定不允許給客人送外賣（壓根不管我什麼特殊情況）。而且那個態度一聽就是敷衍，説白了就是不想送。我最後無奈拖着傷腿下樓去拿了外賣。這件事真的是讓我非常吃驚，居然會有這樣的酒店。這還是服務行業嗎？早上走的早趕火車，要不然真的去找酒店管理説個清楚
