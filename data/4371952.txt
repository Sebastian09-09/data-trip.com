msg:Excellent hotel and good value for money. Rooms are large, swimming pool is very nice with kids pool and adult one, the kids playground in the villa area is terrific, the location is perfect (5 minutes walk to a shopping center with restaurants, 5 minutes walk to beach, 5 minutes walk to a food street with night market). The style is also pretty (white and pink flowers on the hotel walls). 

Small negative note: the restaurant in hotel (buffet) is a bit expensive even though the wall aquarium is nice and food seems very good quality. An “a la carte” option would be nice for small families that doesn’t especially want to go with expensive buffet. Also no bar in hotel opened after 8pm.

msg:First time we have choose this Hotel for a short Family vacation during the Christmas holidays. We stayed at the villa with the private pool and jacuzzi. Definitely can recommend this place. The villas are clean and cozy. Staff is very friendly and the breakfast has a lot of choices between Asian and western cousin.

msg:Great hotel for families with children. They have many activities for the kids on a daily basis. The pool is huge and there are floats that you can rent to use right next to the pool. The breakfast room is quite huge with a variety of western and Chinese food (mostly Chinese) but you can always find something to eat. The location is great. Many restaurants and stores are just within walking distance of the hotel, approximately 2 minutes. The beach is also close and very clean. My family and I will definitely return to this hotel.

msg:The room was clean, comfortable and beautiful. The air conditioning however did not work well and when I asked it to be be fixed they told me it had been repaired but it still did not work. The hotel itself self was good and staff were friendly, but service was slow. When we ordered some snacks and a drink it took 40+ minutes to come. Breakfast was great. The location is good as it’s just across the road from the Beach. Great stay if you’re looking to just chill out and relax.
