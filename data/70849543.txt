🛏 【️Beijing Jinyu Badaling Crowne Plaza Hotel Check-in Guide】

📌 Hotel Overview

❶. Comprehensive evaluation: The hotel is tailor-made for the Winter Olympics. Two years ago, it was praised by the Winter Olympics media reporters. Today, this good reputation is still spreading. IHG's rapid development in China has left all competitors far behind. On the 18th of this month, Nanjing Jiangbei Wanhuicheng Holiday Inn Express was grandly reopened! Even if we go back to the "Crowne Plaza" brand, the layout in Greater China has reached as many as 123. Obviously, the new hotels that have sprung up like mushrooms after the rain will take Badaling CP as a template and example. The points they need to learn include: accurate positioning, standardized management, complete supporting facilities, and dedicated employees.

🏨 About the guest room In Room

❶. Guest room layout: The richness of welcome fruits exceeds that of most InterContinental hotels in Beijing (we have checked in at all 31 InterContinental hotels in Beijing, so we have a say); the unique welcome desserts are combined with local architectural features, which is a clever idea worth appreciating. This is our fifth stay at Badaling CP. We have previously experienced the 80-square-meter luxury suite and the parent-child suite. This time we experienced the 120-square-meter executive suite. The bar, dining table, washbasin, double bathroom, air purifier, humidifier, etc. are all particularly suitable for large families. As a state-owned enterprise directly managed by the Beijing State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the famous Jinyu itself started with its main business of building materials. Therefore, the hardware construction quality of Badaling CP is outstanding, and even if you nitpick, you can't find any faults.

☕️ Dining

❶. Gourmet glimpse: The Chinese restaurants of InterContinental Hotel, the larger one is called Caifenglou, and the more refined one is called Caifeng Restaurant. In any case, the products have never disappointed: the authentic Yunnan cuisine of Kunming Huayi, the plus version of stinky mandarin fish of Huailai CP, the flavorful and dense pressed pot abalone potato chicken of Badaling Crowne Plaza... all left a deep and beautiful impression on people's taste buds and body and mind. Especially Manager Shang of Badaling CP Caifeng Restaurant, he took good care of my son. This is the dream of a home away from home. I have to give him a thumbs up. The full-time restaurant supervisors Jason, Manager Duan, Lily, Yucia, Mike, etc., without exception, have all been diligent, natural, and thoughtful (for example, they close quickly, serve with a smile from the heart, and knowing that I love scallion pancakes, they specially bring it to me...). I have stayed in all 6 Crowne Plaza hotels in Beijing, and this is the first time I have seen such an excellent Western food team. The last one that made us feel amazed was the Hyatt Regency Wangjing. In horizontal comparison, the friendly staff of Badaling CP are no less than any other hotel - it is impossible to be unhappy in such a hotel. The restaurant has a diamond member area. An ice bucket is thoughtfully prepared next to the freshly ground coffee machine for breakfast. The coffee beans are "Milan Gold Medal" with a good and mellow taste; the volcanic stone grilled sausages are solid. Like Crowne Plaza Yiwu and Xining Hot Spring Holiday, the "happy hour" of administrative trea**ent will be upgraded to a buffet for free, which is very cost-effective. Buffets are often themed. Not long ago, there was barbecue, and recently it was Southeast Asian style. In short, even long-term guests will not feel bored. As an international hotel group with a strong sense of social responsibility, the love of InterContinental hotels is diffused in every corner you can perceive. For example, among the restaurant staff, this Crowne Plaza has made an exception to recruit some smart and job-seeking deaf-mute people ("Ele.me" is also doing similar good deeds). The small details here can feel the warmth of the entire team. I am still moved when I think about it.

🏊 Hardware Facilities

❶. Hotel environment: The executive lounge has been changed to a children's activity center, and the presidential suite has been changed to a baby care center. The relevant children's activities are extremely rich. There will be exhibition boards in the lobby to make relevant clear instructions-it is not Club Med, but better than Club Med. Here, parents can rest assured and leave the responsibility of walking the baby to the hotel. The lobby does not adopt a large and magnificent style, but instead caters to the natural leisure style of the bamboo forest, which is particularly suitable for the scene and is also particularly suitable for punching in. The lobby bar afternoon tea has a wide variety of dishes, and the desserts are of high quality. The steps of the lobby bar will be transformed into a stage and stands at night, and there are often performances (such as shadow puppetry, etc.), which are deeply loved by children. The greening of the park has reached perfection. Although there are complete fitness facilities on the second floor, I still recommend that everyone take a walk or morning exercise in the park. The towering mountains and the surging Guihe River are accompanied by nature, which is very enjoyable.

🌟 Unforgettable Moments
1. Outstanding performance and awards of star employees (whether the service is strong): From top to bottom, whether it is middle and senior management or grassroots employees, they can all call my name. Obviously, they have undergone rigorous training. Our private butler Melody (Manager Han) arranged everything in detail, from the preparation of children's bathroom supplies to the upgrade of the room, etc. With such a caring person, I feel that the hotel is like my own home, comfortable, refreshing, and full of sunshine. No matter how many unsatisfactory things you have in life, you can easily solve them at Badaling CP, because there is a group of benchmark employees who are like Melody and serve with the most sincere attitude.

📍 Brief summary Conclusion

1. Wonderful moments of the journey: Yanqing is one of the venues for the Winter Olympics, and there are many ski resorts around. As the official reception hotel for the Olympics, the hotel will also hold various ice and snow activities in winter, such as turning the small garden into a snow ring field; in summer, it is about 5 degrees lower than the city, which is especially suitable for summer vacation. The "Summer Capital" is indeed worthy of its reputation. The hotel's outdoor entertainment projects include: karts, super slides, basketball, cruise ships, swings, trampolines, etc.; indoor entertainment projects include: hot springs, swimming pools, Bada Amusement Park, electronic amusement halls, children's playgrounds, table tennis, table football, billiards, etc. In the off-season, the hotel will gather the guest rooms on the 7th floor, and when it is full, the 6th floor will be opened, and so on. This is environmentally friendly and easy to manage (in addition to the good view, important facilities are all on the top floor, such as the 240-square-meter presidential suite and the executive lounge, etc.); in the peak season, it is difficult to find a room, and you need to book in advance. There are many attractions and shopping places around the hotel. It takes 5 minutes to drive to Wanda, 15 minutes to Longqing Gorge (there is a Sinopec gas station on the way), and half an hour to Badaling.

Because it was Children's Day, the hotel staff also took extra care of the baby's emotions. Thanks to all the staff at the hotel front desk, they were very friendly and enthusiastic! The hotel's buffet dinner was also good, with a wide variety. They took the initiative to arrange seats. Because the baby was small, they provided tableware. The breakfast tasted good and was served until 10:30. The hotel also has a lot of indoor and outdoor activities, which is very suitable for families with babies. I didn't experience the hot springs this time, but I will arrange it next time. Thanks again, brother.

Moreover, its parent-child activities are very attentive and not rough. The "fruit sisters" are full of enthusiasm and vitality. The children learn while playing and gain a lot! The experience is great! 
2. The service is great! Before coming, you can feel the high service level of the account manager Quella through email communication. After arriving at the hotel, all aspects are arranged properly. Whenever you seek help, there is always timely, thoughtful and considerate feedback~ My mother also arranged a birthday cake for her birthday, which was particularly touching. 
3. The facilities are complete! The hotel is in a park, next to Holiday Inn Express, and there are several villas. There are hot spring water parks, non-powered amusement facilities, bumper boats on the lake, rainbow slides, small trains, large lawns... There are a lot of things to play in the park. The facilities in the building are also new. The buffet restaurant is clean and bright, with wide table spacing. The dining experience is very good and not crowded and messy.

There are a lot of sediments in the corners of the hot spring pool, and even in independent small areas of the pool, there are a lot of food residues and floating debris on the water surface.
It is recommended that the bathtub be disinfected and cleaned regularly and thoroughly.

Service: Butler Corey Yanchen's service is very thoughtful. He contacted us in advance before our trip and arranged the room. He was considerate and thoughtful! In the afternoon, the hotel lobby also prepared warm honey passion fruit water, which the children liked very much!

Hygiene: The room area is large and the hygiene is good

Food: Breakfast starts at 7 o'clock, and there are all the categories that should be there, but the variety is not very rich. My favorite is the pancakes and wontons, they are completely satisfying!

The young ladies took the children to do handicrafts, play games, and draw prizes. When exchanging paints during the handicraft process, they would remind the children to exchange paints. They don't need parents to help them socialize. They are very attentive. Sister Grape is gentle and beautiful, with strong affinity. She hosted the activities and attracted the children. There were laughter and joy. Sister Blueberry was very serious and responsible. She told us about Luban Lock, taught us to make hairpins, and guided us on the details of making round fans. The child had a stomachache on the first day, and asked the child if it still hurt when I went back later. It was very warm. There was a little brother in charge of running luggage. When he saw that I had a stuffy nose when he went downstairs, he would take the initiative to ask if I needed help. The landscape environment of the park is also good, with a water surface, a large lawn, rabbits, ducks, fish... A very attentive hotel, I will stay again.

Free 🆓upgraded room type when checking in (the area is larger ~ an additional bed ~ the children can sleep by themselves in the middle ~ )
I am overall satisfied with the layout of the room~ There are a few minor issues~ I have communicated them with the hotel customer service~ I would like to give some praise~
There are three trash cans in total (on the side of the toilet, under the sink, and under the living room table), all covered with plastic bags~ I personally like this~ It’s convenient and hygienic, haha, I’m a germophobe.
The anti-slip mat at the door of the shower🚿 is designed to have a floor that is 1 centimeter lower than inside the bathroom~ This way the anti-slip mat will not be affected when opening and closing the door~ This is a nice detail~
There are entertainment venues outside the hotel ~ swings ~ go-karts ~ and small trains 🚂 The children all played ~ thumbs up ~ you will not feel bored if you come here to relax ~
The hotel hot spring ♨️ did not go to the indoor entertainment activities with some children and did not participate~ So I will not comment~ I will have to come again no matter how warm the weather is~ Overall it is recommended~

msg:Recommended by a friend, it definitely lived up to expectations and far exceeded expectations. First of all, the warm service of the housekeeper Corey Yanchen helped us upgrade the family room; the hot spring in Jinyu, the parent-child area is very suitable for children to play, and the design of the hot spring area is also very special, with independent small pools and deck chairs, which is very suitable for a family. Soak together without being disturbed by outsiders. There are many kinds of hot spring pools indoors, and there are not many people crowded together. Bottled water and bath towels are available in unlimited supply at Baisui Mountain. The hotel breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. Finally, there are a variety of parent-child activities, such as small trains, go-karts, rainbow slides, scientific experiments, and crafts. The children had a great time. All in all, it was a very satisfying stay and I will come again.

msg:The hot spring + accommodation are very good👍. After the reservation, the housekeeper Yan Chen took the initiative to call me and asked about the arrival time. He learned that he helped us arrange a sofa bed when we were bringing children. He took the initiative to add WeChat and sent the children's activity time. It was very considerate. Accommodation If you need various items during this period, you can also contact the housekeeper directly👍, thank you.

The hotel is next to the urban area of ​​Yanqing District, not in the mountains. It is very convenient for dining nearby. It is a five-star standard. The room is large and equipped with a bathtub. The sound insulation is very good. The disadvantage is that there are no charging stations inside the hotel.

If you don't take the initiative to provide disposable items, you can ask for them from the front desk. There are bathrobes and slippers for adults. I didn't see slippers and bathrobes for children, so I don't know if they are not available.

Children's activities include a playground for children indoors on the first floor. Older babies can participate in various hands-on children's courses. The sisters who teach are very considerate and patient. At the end of each time, they will remind you when and where the next course is. There is a combination slide and swing outside, which is not a big place. You can walk around the resort, and there is a park on the north side that you can enter directly.

The hot spring is next to the hotel accommodation building. You have to walk over from the hotel building. I personally feel that this hot spring is so good that I only go to bathe in the evening. There are not many adults in the place. There is a children's water play area and various hot springs are gathered in one large area. , it’s not too cold with a high ceiling, there’s a dedicated swimming pool (you need to bring a swimming cap), there seems to be a spa, a tea room, and a restaurant.

The hotel will have a buffet in the evening, stir-fry + small hot pot, and then go to the hot springs after eating.

However, this time I came to Badaling Crown in an off-peak period, and we felt the five-star service. The day before check-in, the housekeeper Corey Yanchen contacted me and thoughtfully upgraded us to a family suite. After arriving at around 9 o'clock the next morning, we checked in as soon as possible. They also provided an extra breakfast and the check-out time was postponed to the afternoon. Two o'clock. In addition, the hotel has children's craft activities at several times, which liberates parents, which is also very gratifying. The waiters in the Western restaurant are super enthusiastic and kind, and the service is excellent. I will come again next time!

msg:I came here 10 years ago. This time I feel that the hotel has been renovated. The overall feeling is good. The hot spring area has also been renovated. The various pools and Japanese-style cubicles inside feel good. The only drawback is that you have to go through a small outdoor area to get to the hot spring area from the hotel, even if you go out from the side door of the hotel. In winter, you still need to wear more clothes to go to the hot spring. The entire hotel compound is not small, and a running circle is about 1.5-2 kilometers. The breakfast is quite rich, and I was deeply impressed by fried dough sticks, pancakes, etc.

When there were not too many people in the hot spring, I experienced all kinds of hot springs and had a good impression. It was very convenient to have bathrobes and slippers for children. Children's activities need to be booked in advance, and some may require adult help. The overall participation of the children is very high and they are very interested. The only regret is that the taste of the restaurant may need to be improved, but it can still fill you up.

Although there are only set meals to choose from during the holidays, the taste is good. The hotel also arranges a variety of activities such as painting and handicrafts, which the children like very much~ There are small trains, karts, and snow rings in the park, but they are only open for half a day in the morning when the weather is hot, and the snow trails are average~ The hot spring is Japanese-style, with a children's activity area. The children had a lot of fun. You can also dine upstairs. It is simple Japanese food, but the taste is quite authentic. You can reach the hot spring by walking a few steps from the side door of the hotel, but it is a bit cold in winter. It would be nice if there was a corridor. The overall experience is very good.

Accommodation: Nothing to say, the equipment is very new and the decoration is good, the room is large, and it is equipped with a sofa, which is suitable for a family of three.
Hot spring: I like the hot spring the most, it has a good sense of privacy, and there is free water. But now I can only enter and exit once a day, which is not very comfortable (it seems that there was no limit before)
Service: The service is good, polite and thoughtful.
Activities: There are more personal activities, thumbs up.
Meals: Generally, the dinner buffet feels that it can be given 3.5 points (low cost performance, but the service is good, give another 0.5 points to 4 points) Breakfast is free, so I give it 4 points. But you can order takeout, which is OK.
Transportation: Suitable for self-driving

But as a family hotel, there are still many details that can be improved.
Such as children's mouthwash cups
My naughty kid broke a glass
very dangerous
There are quite a lot of entertainment activities for children during the Chinese New Year.
It’s just that some of them are more difficult to do manually.
It’s not easy for adults to do it
Food is average
The breakfast buffet has almost no changes in dishes
If you stay for more than two days, you won’t know what to eat.
Chinese restaurants can only serve set meals during the Chinese New Year
And the dishes for the New Year’s Eve dinner are served too early
Many vegetables were either dry or collapsed.
Fortunately, there are more places to eat around

msg:Last year I stayed in the Holiday Inn Express treehouse, but this year I chose the Crowne Plaza. It was indeed much better than the Holiday Inn Express.
Stayed for two nights. There were not many people before the Spring Festival. The accommodation for over 1,000 includes breakfast, hot springs, go-karts, hotel activities and a small train. Because the weather was cold, we only experienced the hot springs.
There are not many people in the hot spring, and the water temperature is not very hot, so children can play. There is a water park on the other side. There are free fruits, drinks and snacks in the afternoon on the second floor. You can also order food. The service is very attentive; the children are here for two days. I played for three or four hours and was full of praise. The only drawback is that it is in another building and you can't go directly in your pajamas.
There is also a free children's playground on the first floor of the hotel, a gym on the second floor, and a table tennis table and billiards on another floor. They are all good places to discharge electricity. As a result, I ran out of time to participate in hotel activities. However, I think there are not as many activities on weekdays as there are on weekends, so it is better to choose hot springs on weekdays.
We all ordered takeout for dinner. The restaurant on the first floor of the hotel was not suitable for us. It was expensive and there were no home-cooked dishes that the children would like. You can also drive to Wanda to eat nearby. We bought a lot of fruit snacks at Wanda Wumart before coming here. There is also an unmanned supermarket in the hotel, and the prices are not cheap. It is recommended to buy what you need in advance.
Parking at the hotel is also very convenient, and parking on the ground and underground is free. You can come again next year. It is recommended to avoid the peak crowds and have a better experience!

The date was chosen very well, it happened to be three or four days before the Spring Festival. There were not many people and the hotel experience was very good. The day before departure, Mr. Corey Yanchen, the hotel’s exclusive butler, thoughtfully called us and sent us a schedule of various activities that our children could participate in. He also upgraded us to a family room for free based on the situation of our children. The sincerity made us feel warm before we even left the house. The hotel's hardware, software and various facilities are good. There are go-karts, snow fields, rainbow slides, small trains and other places for children to play. Because there are few people, children are basically reserved. The children played wildly all afternoon. In the evening, the whole family went to a hot spring and went back to the house to sleep. It was really enjoyable in the winter. There is Shijinglong Ski Resort 15 minutes' drive away from the hotel, where you can go skiing.

The children's center in the hot spring is also very good. The hot spring pool is very private, the water temperature of the medicinal bath is higher, and the water temperature of other pools is lower, which is suitable for babies. There is also afternoon tea in the middle, and the fruit is very fresh!
I had a lot of fun in three days, and I will go there next time!

The vehicle that caused the accident fled. The next day, I found that my car was hit and I immediately contacted the hotel to check the surveillance. After checking, they told me that a guest hit my car and drove away. During the subsequent handling process, I found that the driver who caused the accident was a hotel employee, but the hotel never told me about this during this period. Today, I held the hotel accountable for the financial negligence of the guests and asked for compensation. The hotel refused and clearly told me that the hotel’s obligation was to help me adjust the surveillance and find the perpetrator. The hotel would not be responsible. I cannot accept this and am very dissatisfied! In your hotel, your employee drove a motor vehicle to hit my car and fled. The first thing you thought about was how to clear yourself without any handling solutions or apologies. It is simply deceiving consumers! There is no responsibility at all! Everyone, stay away from it.

I went to the Crown Office to check in at 10 o'clock the next morning because it was Monday. Because there are not many guests, the check-in time is relatively early.
Still as good as ever! excellent! This time we had dinner at Caifeng Restaurant. I bought a meal for two for 399 from Dianping. Well worth it. The dishes are all good ~ the dishes are all freshly fried and delicious ~ not pre-made dishes! Feel free to eat!
I had booked with Ctrip before, but I didn’t have InterContinental points. Next time, make a reservation on the official official account!
The hotel's big lawn! spa! Caifeng Restaurant! Children's paradise! It is recommended to play on weekdays if possible!

The most commendable thing is that the hotel has full-day care for children and handicraft classes for each period. Teachers Taozi Chengzi and Litchi are very patient in motivating the children and doing a lot of handicrafts.
The hot springs are quite satisfactory. At 11pm, there will be far fewer people there at night, and there is an area for children to play.
There are many kinds of breakfast and the taste can be better.
There is a Wanda Plaza about six minutes' drive outside the hotel, and there are so many delicious options to choose from.
This can be regarded as a very cost-effective five-star family hot spring hotel. It is also very close to the ski resort. It is a very good choice in winter.

His attitude was very gentle, friendly, warm and thoughtful. . The room is large, neat and clean. There is no problem at all for two adults and two children.

The room is well soundproofed and will not be disturbed by the neighbors. The breakfast is very rich, hot and cold, sweet and salty, Chinese and Western styles. Went there a little after eight and it was already packed. I have two small suggestions. First, it would be better if the bath water in the room is hotter. Second, it would be better to add more cakes and snacks for breakfast. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay, and I would like to thank the young man Lang Yingao again for his warm service.

Let’s talk about the situation this time. I took the elderly and children and booked two rooms. We went to the hotel at around 12 noon to wait for the rooms to be packed, one at 2:30 and the other at around 4:00. While waiting, the children participated in activities and signed up for the 160 afternoon care activities. The elderly could only sit in the lobby and wait.
After dinner, we went to soak in the hot springs at 7 o'clock. The open-air journey from the hotel to the hot springs was not very friendly on a winter night. In addition, the lights in the hot springs were too dark at night, so it was easy to get empty in the pool.
The breakfast is indeed of limited quality, and the previous buffet dinner was not highly rated.
The summary is, don’t catch up on holidays. Overall, 5 points, and only 3 points for holidays.

The housekeeper Corey Yanchen called the housekeeper one day in advance and arranged the room in advance after adding WeChat. Any problems were solved at any time.

There are not many ice and snow sports outside the hotel. If you don’t queue up, one hour is enough.
The activities in the Crown Family Wonderful Journey are very interesting. There are usually four or five activities every day, including small handicraft experiments. Sisters Litchi and Yangmei explain it in detail and help the children do it together. It is very fun.
There are children's playgrounds indoors and outdoors, and the breakfast is quite rich. In short, it has received five-star reviews. It is recommended for parents and children to play. It is fully arranged for two days!

There are also many recreational facilities, as well as various handicraft classes. My daughter especially likes Teacher Taozi’s face painting. I also had a great time crossing obstacles in the air. The hotel's hot spring is very clean and has Japanese-style private cubicles, which is very private. Snow is being made in the open space in front of the hotel, and it looks like there is a tube ski trail. Unfortunately, it has not been built yet. It may be open on New Year's Day.

This feeling comes from Eric. On the morning of the 24th, we received a call from Eric before we even checked in. Then we added WeChat to communicate details and see pictures.

msg:The trip was very enjoyable. Although it was a third-party reservation, Eric Lang Yingao from the hotel contacted me in advance. After confirming the membership level, the room type was upgraded to a family room. The three beds were very comfortable, and breakfast for the baby was also provided. The hotel has a strong Chris**as a**osphere, and there are various parent-child activities. My child especially likes face painting, and she talked to me about Sister Putao for a long time. Muyun Hot Spring is also a highlight. Only guests staying at the hotel can go there. It is destined to not be too crowded. It is also very friendly to guests until 11 o'clock in the evening. Although the outdoor open-air hot spring is very cold, it is very comfortable, and the indoor one is Japanese-style. The a**osphere, each small cubicle creates a pseudo-private hot spring environment, and the whole place is clean and hygienic. I am willing to come again just for the hot springs. The breakfast was also very rich, and a large snow slide was built on the hotel lawn. Although we didn't experience it this time, we also experienced the thick snow in Yanqing and had a snowball fight.

msg:❄️To summarize

2023 is coming to an end, and this year of raising children has come to a successful end. There is still one last holiday they are looking forward to. The adults don’t celebrate it, but the children have to celebrate it. . .

Then, continue to take the baby everywhere in 2024!

⛄️Chris**as

It’s Chris**as Eve on the weekend, so I took my two babies to check out the Chris**as activities at the parent-child hotel.

Children’s Chris**as rituals must be indispensable.

This time I came to the Crowne Plaza Beijing Jinyu Badaling.

🎄Big Chris**as tree

A very tall Chris**as tree 🎄 appeared at the entrance of the hotel. It was more than three meters tall by visual inspection. It was decorated with cute decorations and the natural decorations from the heavy snow in Beijing. It looked fashionable and high-end. Even the children braved the severe cold. Come out and take a photo.

🎭Chris**as facial makeup

The hotel's fruit family painted the children's faces for free, with a wide range of patterns to choose from. The children's faces were filled with the light of Chris**as during the two days they stayed.

✅Thank you to the strawberry sister, blueberry sister, lychee sister, orange sister, watermelon brother and other fruit families for taking care of the children.

🎏Chris**as Ornaments

The children also made a lot of Chris**as trinkets in the hotel, which were very appropriate for the occasion and very cute.

msg:During the three years of the epidemic, I have stayed in so many family hotels in Beijing, and this one should be the best. First of all, Miss Mona at the front desk is very nice. She upgraded the family room for free. The design of the family room is super reasonable. There is a double bed sandwiched between two single beds. It is especially suitable for families with two children. The child is not easy to fall off and is better than a large bed. The family room with bunk beds is much more reasonable, and also has butler service, as well as hotel activities for an extra child (although they are too fun to use).
The hot spring children's water park included in the package is also the most suitable for children I have ever played. The water temperature is 34 degrees and the room temperature is also suitable. It is large in area and the water depth is less than one meter. Non-slip socks are provided before entering the water. There are many lounge chairs next to it, which is super save for adults. The hot spring afternoon tea is also good, there are not many varieties, but it is quite delicious. The hot spring for adults is also good and the water is very clean.
In addition, the hotel buffet is very cost-effective, and there are also many children's activities. There will be a small party for children in the evening. Two children won prizes in the lottery after the party. Children's activities were organized with a series of peaches, cherries, lychees, watermelons, strawberries, etc. The lady is not bad either.

The children don't want to go out😊. It's just in time to cool down. It's cold outside but the air conditioner in the room is very hot. Let's go and soak in it. The hot spring is also very good. You can reach the hot spring less than 20 meters from the side entrance of the hotel, which is convenient and comfortable.

The housekeeper helped arrange the room decoration and provided a cake. Although the hotel's hot spring has to go out of the main building, it is very close. It can be reached in minutes. The butler informed me that it was a private tour during the off-peak hours. The hot spring afternoon tea and lounge are very good. What’s more worth mentioning is that there are many parent-child activities. The activities in Bata Toy City are also very interesting for children. Like them all. The hotel has also been decorated with a Chris**as a**osphere in advance, and the overall service of the hotel is very good. Will come again~

The parent-child room is definitely enough for two adults and two children. The room facilities are very new and within the best period of use. The welcome fruits and snacks are also great. The hot spring is definitely a highlight. We went there at the end of November, and the temperature was already very low, but the children's water park has a very suitable room temperature, not cold at all, which is very suitable for children. The adult pool is not cold either, and other large and small hot spring pools are also suitable. It can meet the needs of different groups of people, and there is also an outdoor bathing pool, but we did not go out to experience it with our children. We can smell the faint smell of sulfur and it is a real hot spring. There are also many hotel activities, some paid and some free, to meet different needs. There are still many things I haven’t experienced yet, so I plan to go there a few more times.

My family thinks that the biggest praise of this trip is the hot springs. However, as a five-star family hotel, the facilities and services are too average compared to other hotels of the same type. Even if you add a Ctrip guest manager, you feel that it is not very professional. There is no welcome fruit in the hotel, and the children's toiletries only include shampoo, no body soap, and breakfast. Compared to other Intercontinental hotels, it is slightly inferior. The managers of the Western and Chinese restaurants provided excellent service and received good reviews, as did Sisters Cherry, Grape and Orange. Other possible positioning is that of an ordinary five-star hotel, nothing special.

The hot springs were almost reserved and it was very pleasant to soak in. They used to provide waterproof bags for mobile phones and makeup remover wipes, but they are gone now. The steam room is still not open. The jjim steam room is not open because If the temperature cannot be raised when no one is using it, it means it cannot be used.

Let’s talk about the hotel. My mother likes it very much. The only bad thing is that the room is too hot. My throat hurts when I sleep at night. If I had known better, I would have asked for a humidifier in the hotel. In addition, breakfast is relatively simple in IHG. There are only four Chinese hot dishes in total, including a stir-fried cabbage and an egg fried rice. There are too few styles, let alone Western desserts, Japanese or seafood, etc., maybe There are only a few people there, so we won’t prepare so many people.

The gym is very clean, good reviews!

The hotel helped to change the date to the date I wanted to book. On the day of check-in, I got sick again. I want to give a special mention to Tony. I forgot to mention it in the comment on the previous order. I was given a few extra bottles of water, not to mention, after drinking the water and taking the soup, I really got better. I booked two rooms this time, so I was lucky enough to experience both a suite and a family room. I feel that the family room is more suitable for parents and children. There are almost three small double beds, one for each person. The hotel has a lot of family activities, the hot springs are wonderful, and the most important thing is that there are not many people in the hot springs. After bathing, there is free afternoon tea, and the food and beverage prices are not five-star at all. Highly recommended.

I really recommend this room type if you are a family with 2 children. The children also had a lot of fun, and there were a lot of themed activities. If they are older, parents can relax and book various activities in the hotel for their children. Although the facilities in the children's club are simple, they are enough for our 2-year-old. The dinner in the set menu is also highly recommended. It is a hot pot buffet, which is very cost-effective. Whether you are a family of three or a couple with children, there are suitable dishes, and the freshness of the dishes is also good. The biggest feeling is that I felt the child-friendly a**osphere from the moment I checked into the hotel. All the staff greeted me warmly and paid attention to the children. This is the warmest family-friendly hotel service I have experienced so far. Quella at the front desk always takes the trouble to answer guests' needs and questions. Sister Cherry from the parent-child activity always remembers my son's name and greets him by name every time we meet, which makes us feel more cordial. My father and I put the children's kettles separately. The dishes and tableware were forgotten in the children's club and breakfast room, but they were all taken care of by the attentive staff. We thought the hot springs included in the package would be crowded on weekends, but we didn’t expect the crowds to be moderate and we didn’t even order dumplings... The kids also had a great time. It can be said that this trip to Crown, both in terms of hardware facilities and software services, exceeded my expectations.

Facilities: Although the bathing facilities at the hot springs are not up to par with the standards of Olympic competition venues (there are no floor heating or clothes dryers, there are very few shower rooms, you need to queue up for showers, and the conditioner is already empty, there are not many people outside to take photos) I asked the waiter to add conditioner. I lamented that there are still too many people in China and the quality varies. Five-star hotels try their best to ensure that guests can experience five-star service quality), but it is considered very good in China. Baisuishan drinking water is available at any time, and bath towels and yukata are also provided in a timely manner. The hair dryer is Dyson and the hand cream is Bulgari.



Facilities: It's too cold everywhere in the hotel. The air conditioner doesn't seem to be of much use. The cold wind in winter will wake you up at night. It is better to turn off the air conditioner.

The front desk receptionist, as shown in the picture, the person who works for you with emotion all the time is really as bad as the room. He asked a question and repeated it several times before he answered indifferently. We bought it with the same account as our elderly and children. , but they arranged two locations for us in completely opposite directions! As your member, I am so sorry that my intestines are green!
Environment: Very bad. Room 6136 was at 30 degrees 24 hours a day, which caused me to have severe heatstroke. I only recovered after taking Rendan and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water! The pillow in the room smelled very strong of oil, so I asked the supervisor to change it in person.
Facilities: The kettle socket in the room is broken and no one repairs it in time! Now I think about it, did the front desk staff deliberately give us room 6136 to retaliate against the guests? Such an unsatisfactory accommodation experience! Unexpectedly, during the golden autumn period of the National Day in October, Yanqing treated people to heatstroke. The temperature in the guest rooms was so high that it didn't improve even if they were given fans. It was really a big deal for the hotel to bully customers! Of course, the hotel room is terrible👎, but the breakfast is still good, rich and clean, with a wide variety and beautiful tableware! It’s a pity that I didn’t eat anything because of the heat stroke!

She was very attentive and patient in helping me change the room type over and over again. In the end, not only did I get to play everything, but it was also better than The previous reservation was 500 yuan cheaper.
This hotel is really a treasure hotel! A paradise for children! Will come again later.

msg:How should I put it? Some aspects of a five-star hotel don’t look like a five-star hotel at all. After my friend and I rode our bikes and folded our bikes outside the hotel’s glass door, the service staff at the hotel’s door opened their eyes and watched. You pointed at my car and I don’t know what to say. You came out to help me. When we entered the lobby, we both had a lot of things in our hands. We didn’t say anything about coming over to help with the luggage. I just said hello and welcome to check in. That was it. , there are several people standing there at the door, just say hello when you see someone, this job is really easy! We go out to eat, turn on the cleaning button, and when we come back, the trash can is full and nothing has been touched.
But the breakfast is not bad, there are many styles, and the chef has a good attitude. The water cups in the guest rooms are still marked with tea water, and if you need anything, they will be delivered quickly. I also explained these problems during the phone call, and the interviewer was very nice.
I feel that overall it is not as good as the four-star hotel I stayed in.

msg:How should I put it, I took my three-year-old child to live during the summer vacation, but it took nearly 40 minutes to check in. The queue was too long... It shows how popular the hotel is.
For breakfast, you have to queue for a long time at each stall. You have to wait in line to get a noodle, and you have to wait for nearly half an hour... Pancakes also have to wait in line for a long time.
The hotel environment is good. In the Badaling Resort, there are tents and bonfires outside. It feels very good at night.
Let's talk about the facilities in the hotel room, which are quite satisfactory, but the design of the bathtub is not reasonable. The bathtub is next to the bed outside the bathroom. Children will inevitably get some water on the floor after taking a bath in the bathtub, and then slip and fall on the tiled floor, crying for a long time...
One or two small flying insects were found in the room. I feel that the hygiene can be improved.
The underground garage has no parking spaces at all, and there are no charging piles, so it is finally parked on the ground.
The service attitude of the hotel service staff, especially the young lady at the front desk, is still very good.

msg:Very recommended, especially for parents and children. Yanqing hotels have been to club med, Hyatt World Park, and Crowne Plaza Badaling. I like the Crowne Plaza's room the most, and the activities are also the best. Most recommended, various activities from morning to night 3 My half-year-old child likes it very much. The hotel's large courtyard environment is also very good. There is also a park next to it. You can go directly from the Smart Hotel. It is very suitable for vacation and leisure. It should be the most vacation a**osphere among the three hotels. Especially the lawn movies, bonfire party, and competitions in the evening are very interesting and children are willing to participate. Eating barbecue, drinking and chatting by the lawn at night, watching the children play on the lawn is very liberating for adults. This time I didn't go to experience the hot springs, but the small train, rainbow slide, go-kart and the Crown family activities provided by the room rate are enough for a whole day. The hotel's breakfast children's meals are also very rich, and children like buns and cakes in various shapes. The only thing that is worse is the gym. Dad reported that the fitness facilities are not as rich as the Hyatt Hotel. However, in view of the fact that it focuses on parent-child, and the large yard is very suitable for morning jogging, its flaws do not hide its advantages. In particular, I would like to praise the staff of the fruit family who organized the event, sister peach, sister strawberry, brother watermelon, etc., who are serious and responsible, and very friendly.

msg:I hope what I write today will be helpful to future guests.
Service: The service attitude and reception speed of the hotel are very good. However, when the occupancy rate is not high, room upgrades are not given. There is a small sofa between the standard two beds in a twin room. Pictured is the family room with the side couch and pull out sofa bed. Please be careful not to make a mistake.
Accommodation: At the front desk, I showed the ID cards of four people. First, I didn’t upgrade the room directly. When I first arrived at the room, I saw that the sofa could not be opened and asked the front desk. I was told that the family room would cost 800 yuan. As a gold medal member, it is also the first time that I have not upgraded my room. Not upgrading is a rule, and upgrading is a human service. I hope that if the occupancy is not high in the future, room upgrades will be given. I see that many people who went to Ctrip before have upgraded for free. I don’t know why this time. This should not be a reason for a bad review. Overall very good.
There are also hotels that do not distinguish between administrative and ordinary, that is, there is no reserved dining space and trea**ent for the administrative level. This is also the first time that there is no distinction in the holidays I have lived so far.
Room service needs children's toiletries to be delivered in a timely manner. The view in the room is nothing special, because the highest is the 7th floor.
Catering: Breakfast and dinner are self-service. On the whole, the standard of IHG is still maintained. However, during breakfast, there are flies on the waffles. After telling the staff, the supervisor came over and replaced them all immediately. Still in time. The Chinese food for lunch was delicious. IHG members can also get a 10% discount. But the price is about the same if you buy it in the public.
Activities: Hotel activities are divided into free and charged. In fact, it will be free if you buy a Ctrip package or not, so it is not included in the package cost. There are many charging activities in the hotel, so you can just buy a package. The kids enjoyed the various craft activities. The participation rate is very high, and the five staff members are really kind and hardworking, thank you.
Finally, the hotel's hot spring is a third-party, and the whole is very comfortable. But you can't go in and out multiple times. If you want to play hot springs, you must have enough fun at one time before coming out.

The front desk staff had a good attitude and upgraded me to a senior suite. The room I booked was already very spacious, and the suite was more comfortable. The advantage of the room is that it is very soundproof, the corridor is relatively quiet, the hygiene, the view outside the window, and the Internet are not bad. There is a small gym on the 2nd floor for simple exercise.

At present, the hotel features parent-child and hot springs, which are very suitable for bringing children. The executive lounge has been converted into a children's activity center, and there are several outdoor projects. There is also a paddling pool for children in the hot spring.

The hot spring area is very large. The staff introduced that there are more than 50 pools. You can choose a location you like to relax.

The surrounding environment is quiet and the air is good. There is a lawn outside. There is a new barbecue at night in summer. It is very pleasant to enjoy the cool outdoors.

The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel focuses on parent-child hot springs, which is also a feature of the hotel, but the indoor playground only has three or four items that children can play, and the rocking horse and merry-go-round are still charged; there are no indoor socks at the entrance, and adults and children can enter with shoes on Yes, the management feels a bit messy; the Japanese-style hot spring has a very beautiful environment, and a brand new waterproof mobile phone bag is very considerate when entering the store! But during the May Day holiday, the premium is 499 yuan per person, and you can only enter and exit once. Staying in the hotel does not include hot springs. I feel that there is a psychological gap~
I came here for a parent-child hot spring hotel. There are few children’s playground facilities, and there is a single charge for hot springs. If you are only playing in nearby scenic spots, it is recommended to stay. After all, the room and environment are good. If you are rushing to the hotel’s parent-child playground and hot springs, it is not recommended coming!

msg:After the epidemic, I have been looking for good parent-child hotels in Beijing and its surrounding areas, but there are very few suitable ones. After discovering Crowne Plaza Hebei Zunhua on May 1st and actually checking in and having an extraordinary experience, this week I discovered another treasure under the brand, Crowne Plaza Beijing Jinyu Badaling. I can't wait to book the experience. The comments are as follows:

The location, the hotel is backed by Badaling, adjacent to the Guishui River, and enjoys the natural beauty of "the city is in the garden, the city and the scenery blend together". There are children's paradise, children's trains and karts (all need to be paid separately), so that guests can enjoy the healing and parent-child friendly experience without going out of the park. If you come by car, you can reach the Beijing-Tibet Expressway and the Jingli Expressway, which is very convenient. Due to the World Horticultural Exhibition and the Winter Olympics, the surrounding roads are very well repaired!

For sightseeing, there are many famous scenic spots around, including Badaling Great Wall, Longqingxia Scenic Area, Wild Duck Lake National Wetland Park, Shiyuan Park, etc., all within half an hour's drive.

For dining, the hotel is within walking distance to Wanda Plaza and Wal-Mart shopping district (20-25 minutes), which is convenient for dining and shopping. There are 3-4 Chinese and Western restaurants in the hotel, with authentic taste and high cost performance.

Facilities fully reflect the resort-style design concept and the standardized temperament of Crowne Plaza International five-star hotel. 7 storeys high, low density, simple and elegant overall, integrated with the surrounding harmonious natural environment, the lobby is modern and modern style, beautifully decorated, the layout of the room is reasonable (big bed and sofa bed), comfortable bedding, comfortable living .

Children's activities are detailed and rich in content. There are different activities every day. On weekends, we participated in facial portraits, card issuance, mortise and tenon joints, lottery draws, fluid bears, outdoor production, and kite flying. We really enjoyed it and were overwhelmed.

Service, this is the most worth mentioning. Every service staff in the store is lovely and courteous, especially Xiao Ai at the front desk, who provided us with meticulous and considerate services. Before the trip, he gave me a detailed introduction to the hotel situation, children's activity time and various precautions. After check-in, he asked me many times about the check-in experience to find out if there were any problems that needed help and solutions. It fully embodies the customer-oriented service concept and the brand soft power of Crowne Plaza. The whole family is deeply impressed and very moved...

This must be a place that you should come to. I still want to come here after leaving. I will definitely come again in the future. I recommend everyone to come to a family-friendly resort hotel! ! !

msg:The hotel is very new. It can be felt that it is designed for vacation. The style is bright and warm. There is a large indoor space for children to play, and the outdoor green space can also play Frisbee and kite. Various parent-child activities make the children feel very interesting.

Special praise to Joanna Zhang at the front desk, who greeted our itinerary one day in advance and helped arrange a satisfactory room, thank you!
When I checked in, Ms. Yu at the front desk patiently helped me check in, and also thoughtfully recommended weekend activities for my children.
The fruit teachers in the parent-child activities are also very dedicated, the activities are rich, and the children had a happy weekend
We would also like to thank Mr. Wang Jigen, the cleaning staff of the hotel. The child’s parachute toy accidentally flew into the tree. Mr. Wang kindly helped us take it down and found it again. The child is very happy, thanks to the enthusiastic Mr. Wang!
All in all, this hotel feels like a vacation, and it is very friendly. The food in the Chinese restaurant is also good, but the service of the hot spring needs to be improved. Does it feel like it is a management training system? The front desk and service staff are a little cold

msg:The hardware facilities of the hotel are pretty good. It's quite comfortable once you get in.
The room is not too small. The windows of the inexpensive hotel face the residential building, so there is no vacation feeling haha! The breakfast is very average. The buffet and Chinese restaurants are really unexperienced. There is Wanda Plaza next to it. Go there and eat.
The hotel hot spring is charged separately. The swimming pool is free. My room does not include hot spring. Weekend 499 per person. Public comment 399 per person. Half price for children. Because the weather was a bit cold that day. It takes a long walk outside. I was afraid that the children would catch a cold, so I didn't go swimming or soaking in hot springs. The environment inside is not bad. But the price is quite expensive, so I didn't think about it!
The hotel's small train is 50, one big and one small. It's really unnecessary to spend money haha! Unless the child insists on sitting. Or the hotel will give you a ticket! Because half of the road is coming from the back of the hotel, there is no view, only the wall and the garbage station.
The indoor naughty castle is good. The outdoor naughty castle is average, but there is an additional charge. The bingo game at the hotel at night is also very good! Suitable for children and adults.

msg:It’s been a long, long time since I’ve traveled around Beijing. It’s been a long time and it’s too hot this time. I discussed it with my friends and decided to travel 3 hours earlier. Haha, it’s my first time visiting this park. Yanqing has been really well built in recent years. Crowne Plaza is on the right hand side after entering the gate of the park. Because it was raining, the doorman reminded us to park the car underground. Because I had been with my housekeeper Zoey on the first day We have communicated all the packages and check-in matters, so the process is very smooth, and there is a children's playground on the first floor where children can be placed, so that adults can do things with peace of mind. My family booked a family suite for my snoring father. The room is very large, like a maze , The welcome fruit and snacks were swept away in an instant. After looking at the map, I went to the hot spring. I thought it would be expensive to buy it separately. After entering, I found out that it is so big, not bad, hahaha, there are various aroma pools, medicine pools, Jacuzzi, children's paradise, and snacks in the afternoon, I played for three hours... The breakfast is Asian style, very friendly to the Chinese stomach, there are many activities every day during the May Day period, dazzling, if you come to walk the baby, stay for two or three hours God is no problem! And the staff here can surprise me with a smile no matter what, it's really great, especially for my dear housekeeper Zoey and the handsome guy Ryan at the front desk [candy][candy][candy]

Although the package with dinner and hot springs is a little expensive during May Day, the hotel environment, software and hardware, especially the environment and experience of the hot springs, are all worth the money. During the entire stay, Crystal at the front desk gave great help and solved all the original concerns! The hotel staff are warm and polite, and there are plenty of children's programs.

Knowing that my husband is celebrating his birthday, he also carefully arranged the guest room and prepared healing handmade gifts and exquisite birthday Cake, super heart, super excellent service.
The hotel's hot spring is still worth experiencing. The hardware is naturally good. The main reason is the service experience of the hotel staff, which makes people see the high service standard of Crowne Plaza InterContinental Group as always.
Thanks again to Krystal, the guest service manager, she is really kind, you can find her next time, you will never be disappointed, praise 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍​👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

The restaurant staff will take the initiative to help with the meal. The children will give milkshakes. The meals are also okay, except that the temperature is a bit cold, the pancakes for breakfast, and the lamb chops for dinner. Lime perch is pretty good. The cold seafood is too cold, but the freshness of the sashimi is still very good. The room is in the south, and you can see a room full of sunlight when you open the door. I am very happy.

The staff Very warm, complimentary afternoon tea, the children had a great time playing, the clean bath towels and mineral water readily available in the hot spring are very considerate, the staff cleaned up the scene very quickly, and there are almost no traces of the previous person's use in the rest area.

I will go to Ang again if I have the opportunity~

The hotel's facilities are very new, and the stay experience is very comfortable. The hotel lobby is very characteristic, simple and warm. The indoor bamboo forest allows travelers to transition from noisy to quiet at once, and divides the space naturally, which is very creative.
Special thanks to Joanna, the hotel housekeeper, who contacted me one day in advance to inquire about my needs, arranged a room for me on the day of check-in, booked a restaurant, and gave me a birthday surprise. Helped me with a late checkout the next day in due course. Very considerate and very satisfied!
The hotel's restaurants include Chinese restaurants, cafeterias and cafes. The dishes are fresh and rich, the taste is pure and delicious, and the price is also reasonable.
The hotel has a hot spring and a swimming pool. The fly in the oin**ent is that it is separated from the housing building. It may be inconvenient in winter. It would be perfect if there is a closed corridor between the two floors.

We had a good appetite after soaking in the hot springs, and we ate it all in one sitting. The tofu was delicious, and the roast meat was also very authentic. The restaurant manager, Jason, was very helpful. He even took a group photo for us on our birthday. The hot springs are amazing! Because I arrived on Friday afternoon, there were only three of us in the audience, and it felt luxurious to book the venue. The hot spring is very clean, and there are small Japanese-style compar**ents one by one. I touched the plants, and they were all real. The plants are very green, and the air is fresh, without the turbid and steaming feeling. There are clean towels everywhere and mineral water at all times. The hotel's buffet breakfast doesn't end until 9:30 in the morning. You can go to eat after getting enough sleep. The staff are also very friendly. The overall feeling of staying here is very good. I will come back to soak in the hot springs in winter. I plan to stay again in summer when I plan to climb Sea Camel Mountain. All in all, it was a very good weekend trip!

After learning that we had children, he upgraded us to a family room and checked in early. Check out time was also delayed to 2 o'clock. Let the children have more time to play and rest better.
2. The Chinese restaurant Caifeng Xiaoguan mainly serves Cantonese cuisine. The taste is remarkable and the saltiness is moderate. It is very suitable for the elderly and children. You can order half a portion of the dishes, so you can taste several more dishes without wasting. Wrapped tofu, three kinds of siu mei, sea emperor soup, vegetarian horseshoe box...

The hotel is very close to the Shiyuan Park. It is recommended to visit the Shiyuan Lantern Festival and the Ice and Snow Carnival. It is very fulfilling! The chocolate hazelnut cake in the western restaurant of the hotel is very delicious. If you go to the Chinese restaurant late, you have to wait for a seat. It is recommended to go early. The hygiene of the hotel is very good, the breakfast is rich, and the staff are very friendly!

Hygiene: Not bad, the environment is more considerate and comfortable than other hot spring hotels, especially hotels with hot springs, to be honest, it is cleaner than Chunhui Garden
Environment: The facilities in the park are perfect, and the children's area is not enough to play even if you stay for two days.
Service: The service staff are very kind and thoughtful, especially the manager Gao is very patient and caring. The surrounding attractions are also recommended in detail. The room service is fast and timely, and children's equipment is also available

Muyun Hot Spring Ticket Package: The hot springs are only open to in-house guests, which is great, unlike a garden or a port that sells tickets to outsiders, which is very troublesome

It is worth brushing twice, brushing three, brushing four, five, six... 👌

The children had a great time during this trip 😃. We decided to travel in the early morning this time. We set off in the morning. We were in a hurry.

msg:In the winter, I want to take my baby to a hot spring and stay in a hotel. I did a lot of homework and booked this Crowne Plaza. I stayed here for two consecutive days, and I feel that this is a really good choice as a resort hotel.

The location is close to the north of Yanqing, but it is not very remote. There is a Wanda just over a kilometer walk away. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. Shiyuan Park is a 10-minute drive, and it takes only 20 minutes to Longqing Gorge. As a mature five-star chain hotel, whether it is environment, hardware, or service, it can reach the corresponding standard and quality. It is especially friendly to children. The children's club is rich in activities, and the breakfast variety is rich and delicious, and children like it too. There are also children's play facilities in the park, and there are snow circles at the entrance to play, so you don't have to worry about your baby having no place to release energy just by visiting the hotel.

I came here for the hot springs. This Crowne Plaza shares a yard with Holiday Inn Express and the Left Bank Hot Spring Town. The hot springs are actually located in a building next to the hotel, and it’s only a few steps away from the side door. The hot spring ticket needs to be bought separately, and the children's ticket is required to buy a ticket for a height of 1.2 meters. The fare is not cheap. There is also a small children's water park. There is only a small slide and some ocean balls. The baby has fun in it. The design of the children's pool outside is very good. The baby swims a lot of laps as exercise.

You can also consider coming back to escape the summer heat during the summer vacation. You should have a different experience.

msg:The hotel is very suitable for children. It is a playground for 6-year-olds. There are plenty of indoor activities in winter. In addition, the overall operation of the hotel is not yet mature. The service staff is a bit cramped, and the content of the package is adjusted from time to time. Although there are shortcomings, overall, the baby is very happy

The front desk service in the hot spring area is thoughtful, the explanation process is very clear, the dressing room is very high-quality, the shower facilities are the same as those in the hotel, there is a separate dry and wet hanger for clothes, the washing and care is a Bulgari suit, the dressing area is brightly lit, and equipped Dyson hair dryer, very comfortable to sit and blow hair

Facilities: The children's playground area on the first floor has floor heating, which is very friendly. The children's pool area in Muyun Hot Spring is designed with a circular pool, and the temperature of the water is suitable. However, the big screen in this area was not open that day. The half-hour outdoor snow circle entertainment project is very interesting. The hotel swimming pool is very child-friendly, with a depth of 1.1 to 1.4 meters, and is free for hotel guests. The royal children's activities on the 7th floor are mainly handicrafts, small science experiments, and painting. The Badabada Children's Theater has just opened, so I didn't participate this time

Disadvantages: The indoor temperature of the theater in the business district is too low in the evening, so we cannot stay for a long time. The spa, bathroom steaming, dry steaming, scrubbing and other areas in the hot spring area have not yet opened and are still under preparation

Others: The hot spring and swimming pool are separate buildings, which are not integrated with the hotel. You need to keep warm when you go out in winter from the side door of the hotel.

Meals: There are many types of breakfast buffet. For lunch, I experienced Cantonese cuisine at Caifeng Chinese Restaurant, which tastes good. The per capita price is 100+. You can also choose the nearby Wanda Shopping Center two or three kilometers away, where there are many types of food and beverages

Dinner for two people: the back kitchen prepares meals in a unified way, a small portion with various meat and vegetables, two bowls of black chicken soup, we do not support single order or extra meals that night, it is a bit rigid

The price of hot springs is not cheap, so I feel that even if the hotel is full, there are not many people, and it is more comfortable, but it is a bit cumbersome to repeatedly swipe the hand card back and forth between the hot spring area, the swimming pool and the dining area.

msg:It feels very heartwarming for the whole family to entrust Crown Holiday for their first trip after the epidemic. The old man mainly rests, and the younger sister is younger. The introduction to Crowne Plaza really wins my heart. It is best to stay in a hotel in winter. I don’t have time to bring my baby after get off work, and I have more than one phone call late at night and early in the morning. I would like to thank Gao Zhiyuan, the front desk supervisor. He is handsome, kind and patient in answering. Not only the hotel problem, but also the surrounding travel. He listened to my ideas and helped recommend arrangements. The indoor and outdoor planning of parent-child activities in the hotel is very good. The little sister Zhang in the indoor park is gentle and gentle. The hot spring is very large and guests will not gather. My sister can play for half a day in the bathtub in the room with a isolation bag. The taste of the food is good, and the manager of the western restaurant is also very enthusiastic and easy to communicate with. The customer service at the front desk is patient and thoughtful at check-in and check-out. The ladies in ancient costumes in the lobby speak softly to the children. The waiters in the restaurant are serious about disinfecting the table, and they care more about serving meals for the children than I do. The room cleaners have a good attitude and clean up meticulously. Once my sister refused to wear a mask when she got out of the elevator. A staff member who passed by immediately squatted down and said, "Your mask is so beautiful, even more beautiful than mine..." My sister listened and put it on smoothly. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and the mini water bar is a plus. In short, this hotel is really worth coming again.

msg:Pros: It was eleven o'clock in the morning, and there was a room to check in directly without waiting. The room was very new and spacious.
Muyun Hot Spring has few people and beautiful scenery, and there are many small compar**ents, suitable for a family. Dry towels and Baisui Mountain are available everywhere, and an afternoon tea is provided. The hot spring area can feel that it should be real hot spring water, and there are also medicinal ponds and flower ponds. The water temperature in the children's area is lower, which is suitable for children to play in the water for a long time, and a free buoyancy vest is provided, which is more convenient than a swimming ring. Although it is not big, the circular swimming lane seems to be particularly attractive to children. You can't stop swimming around. down. If you don't buy a package with hot springs, you can buy hot springs for 498 per adult, and children under 1.2 meters are free. Everyone should be able to go, and there is no proof of accommodation.
Disadvantages: The mechanized handling at the front desk does not say a word, and there is no introduction to hot springs and other activities (the number of guests checking in at noon is not busy). To get to the hot spring, you have to go through a long corridor, then walk out of the hotel door and walk about 100 meters. I didn’t meet a waiter along the way, and the front desk didn’t introduce me, so I had to explore the route by myself. Fortunately, I wore a down jacket. If it’s the same as in other hotels Wearing a bathrobe and going to the hot springs will make you feel stupid~
After dinner in the evening, just in time for the Spring Festival celebration in the lobby, I saw that many other children had stamp books for parent-child activities. We didn't know where they came from, and the children were somewhat disappointed. It can’t be said to be flawed, but I have been to so many parent-child hotels in the suburbs of Beijing. The four-star hotel next door, Shiyuan, knows to introduce the opening hours and routes of the surrounding attractions. In contrast, I feel that I have no affinity. It is purely self-service. Serve.
There are too many people for breakfast, there is no limit and no one to guide. It is understandable that there are so many people. After all, it is the Spring Festival, but the restaurant is a mess. Finding a seat depends on grabbing a seat. In the unit cafeteria~

There are only 10 tables in the lobby of the Chinese restaurant, and the private rooms are not allowed to be used. We have to wait for 40 minutes for a meal. The food is warm except for the soup, it feels like ordering takeaway. In addition, the wc at the entrance of the restaurant is full of smoke, and it feels like entering a smoking room. There are so few options for breakfast, it feels like staying at a holiday inn.
Summary: I am very satisfied with the hot springs, and the hotel as a whole is sorry for the brand of Crowne Plaza

Everything from the accommodation environment to the staff service to the parent-child activities was done very well. What I especially want to praise is the hot spring, which is only open to in-house guests. There are few people and the environment is good. It is a private bath in the big pool, and mineral water and bath towels are available everywhere. The children's paddling pool is an independent space and will not disturb other people.
The only downside is that the buffet dinner is very unprofessional. The small hot pot is one pot per table. The small hot pot I eat outside is one pot per person. Here is one pot per table, and the pot will not open for half an hour , looking anxious. Finally, the stomach is filled with staple food. The seasoning is only simple such as sesame paste, and it is mixed with vegetables and raw meat in the same area. I hope it can be improved, and I will come again next time, but I will not eat the buffet.

Currently crowded in a small corner, access is very inconvenient.

For example, the temperature of the air conditioner is so hot at night that I didn't sleep all night, and the next day I got dark circles, I was so anxious, and the temperature couldn't be adjusted. I wore this short sleeve tossing and turning
Then the cabinet where the kettle is kept can’t be closed. There is always a bright light at night, which is very dazzling, including those buttons that also emit blue light, which is not friendly to sleep.
During the afternoon nap, I feel that the curtains can't block the light. Anyway, I didn't sleep well this time.
The wine given by the Platinum Card is really the worst among the five-star hotels. I ordered white wine and orange juice and the waiter served white wine and apple juice. I admire them both.
The front desk did not say that the gifted small train ticket can only be used between 2:00 and 2:40. After I missed it, I had to talk for a long time before letting me sit. I was also drunk
Breakfast is also very average, nothing to eat
What I want to praise is that the Chinese restaurant is okay, the quality is cheap, and the a la carte is very cheap, which is surprising

msg:Yangkang turned Yin and wanted to take my wife and children for a swim. I would definitely choose parent-child hot springs in winter. I have basically been to Marriott and Mid-Levels. Finally, I decided to choose Crowne Plaza Badaling. I decided to go with the InterContinental brand (there was an episode in the middle of the reservation, although the price for a two-day stay is cheaper, but it only includes one hot spring, the price for a stay is unreasonable). After arriving at the store on the 28th, the welcome reception service is quite warm, and the room is quite satisfactory. When I went to the hot spring at night, the children's play water spray was not turned on. I asked the staff and said that it was not turned on because the sprayed water was cold. The environment of the hot spring area is very good, very beautiful at night, Japanese-style wooden house style, the indoor temperature is not particularly high (I saw it was about 18 degrees, it will be cooler when the water comes out), especially the water sprayed from the functional area (hydraulic massage) is a bit cold. Since I ordered dinner included, it came out at about 8:30. The dinner set really surprised me. The waiter said that the cold dishes on the menu were out of stock, and I thought the chef was about to leave work, so I didn’t want to give it to others. It’s troublesome to fill in, but it’s really disappointing as the dishes come up one after another. 4 slices of garlic sausage and 4 slices of beer ham are also considered a cold dish. I complained one after another. Later, the waiter sent a few pieces of cake + afternoon tea. The breakfast on the second day was not a buffet but a set meal. There were not so many styles, and I didn't bother to add dishes. On the second day of staying, as the occupancy rate increased, the breakfast buffet was opened, which was much better than the package. I checked out on the 30th and went to experience the hot spring again. This time I felt much better. The water spray facilities in the children's area were also turned on. Although it was not particularly hot, it was not cold either. Maybe it was not open on Wednesday because there were few people. The hot spring area The indoor temperature is also high. Feedback the problem when checking out, and the front desk gave a few drink coupons. Talking about the advantages, the service attitude is not bad, and as a parent-child hotel, there are still many children's activities, and you can also play snow circle from 2:00 to 2:40 in the afternoon.

There will be different children's activities at different times, which are very rich. The second room should be similar to most five-star hotels, the advantage is that it is relatively new. The third meal, our package includes a dinner buffet. The level of the buffet should be in the middle and upper class of a five-star hotel. One of the things that impressed me was that a child accidentally spilled food from a plate on the ground, a The staff rushed over, quickly squatted on the ground and began to pick up the food on the ground, and took the child's plate, saying that it doesn't matter, you are taking a plate. The attitude of the waiter is praised. The fourth hot spring, this should be the most tonal indoor hot spring I have ever seen in Beijing. It hangs a certain bay and a city. The entire hot spring is in a huge room, similar to an indoor basketball hall, with a very high floor height and no sense of oppression. The hot springs should be specially designed. There are many independent bathing pools, which are scattered. If you are tired of running, you can go to the steaming board to lie down. The most important thing is that there are few people, and you can hang a certain Zi in Xishan. The children's playground in the hot spring has a ring-shaped pool which is a highlight. Other slides feel that the design is a little less. If the content of the children's area is a little more, this hotel is perfect. Fifth Children's Activity. We participated in Hanfu, cupcakes, and petroglyphs. The teacher was very enthusiastic. Even if we were late, they still provided corresponding materials, which was good. The conclusion given by the girl is that this hotel is good and can come often in the future.

The front desk also reminded me to send afternoon tea and red wine for the room type I booked. Since I arrived too late, I missed the refreshment time, but the western restaurant specially packed the dim sum in advance, so I can go directly to pick it up and like it.
The hot spring ticket is separate and slightly more expensive, but overall it is worth the fare. The main price is reflected in the hardware facilities. The design of the hot spring is very elegant, not only the space is large, the partition is reasonable, there is a stream house suitable for couples, and a moor house suitable for families. Clarity, privacy, and relaxation. The outdoor scenery is unique and worth a visit. The only thing is that the service training of the little brother in the dressing room is still relatively poor. He is playing with his mobile phone by himself. Oh, and the service attitude of the foreman at the front desk is not good at the end, and he may be off work soon. But the aunt and young lady in the main hall are much better, always reminding the pool that there are steps, and asking the older aunt about the situation from time to time.

The breakfast variety is average, but the taste is still good Yes, the room is quite big, and the bathroom is well received. It would be better if the room prepares children's products in advance.
The surrounding area is very convenient. It is about a 15-minute walk from Wanda. It is very convenient to find food, and the takeaway is also very rich. You can pick it up at the gate.

msg:For the children's birthday, I specially chose this hotel with a large lawn. The lawn is very good and has a sense of a**osphere. You can shoot a blockbuster without special preparation! The birthday scene was arranged with the equipment in the room, and the customer service Ada helped to arrange the whole process, and the service attitude was very good! The breakfast is richer than the dinner, and the dinner has no faults. Although there are not many kinds, it is more refined and the environment is good. Each table is not too close. Personally, I think it is better than Minmetals.

msg:Transportation: About an hour and a half after the East Fourth Ring Road, the door is small and not easy to find. Follow the navigation and turn around. Finally, the park is very large.
Environment: The park is quite big. It seems that two hotels share a common park. The lawn is not bad. There are activities in the evening, and it is not bad to take children to play and interact.
Service: The staff are very patient, answer any questions, and try to solve any needs. The courier I ordered also helped me deliver it to my room on time. My daughter also sent a birthday cake for her birthday. The taste is very good. This is worthy of praise!
Hygiene: The room is very spacious and clean. The children also prepared toiletries and slippers because the new decoration still smells a little bit loud. I slept lightly, so I felt a little noisy.

Tickets for two big and one small hot springs in Muyun include hot spring afternoon tea: the hot spring water is very clean because we went to the newly changed water on the day we went, so there are not many people there, there are various medicinal baths, massage pools, etc. It is also suitable for children's bubbles. Of course, there is also a children's swimming pool. It is suitable for smaller babies to play slides, swings, circular drifting pools, ocean balls, and the most intimate and baby's life jackets, so there is no need to bring swimming rings and floating boards. The hotel has afternoon tea and exquisite coffee. drink.
Dinner for two: The dinner is very large, and the three people have not finished it. The price is very high.
There are also go-karts and small trains in the package, and the children had a great time.

After staying for two nights, there are 5-6 lessons with different contents. Children especially like Miaomiao The teacher is both patient and friendly. The hot spring strongly recommends the Japanese style. It is very good and private and includes children's playground and afternoon tea. The swimming pool is free but there is no equipment for children to play in the water. Carol not only handled the late check-out, but also opened a temporary room card, otherwise we can't even do the elevator. Overall evaluation is suitable for parents and children, but also suitable for the elderly.

msg:1) Room: It is quite satisfactory, not big or small, and the overall is ok.
2) Hygiene: The bedding in the room is not clean, there is a lot of ash on it, and after the quilt is opened, there are two or three bugs crawling inside, which is terrible! digusting! After responding to the room service, the night attendant immediately came to change the bedding, and the response was very timely, which was good.
3) Ice cubes: We ask for ice cubes every time we stay in a hotel. We called to ask if we should use ice buckets, and the customer service said yes. But when I went back to the room, I saw that the ice cubes provided by this restaurant were packed in disposable lunch boxes. If we came back for a while, it would turn into water on such a hot day. It is quite strange to give "ice buckets" to guests.
4) Small trains and go-karts. A few villagers contracted it just to make money, and these villagers simply lost their money! The equipment is very broken, the kart track is a mini size, no one is shorter than this, it takes 15 seconds to drive a lap (not an exaggeration!), let's make up for it, pit! Beware of being deceived!
5) Breakfast. I am afraid that among the many Crown Holidays, the meal standard is the lowest! There is nothing to eat, there are few varieties, and the quality is low. The bread is all dry and hard. In addition, many plates were empty, and there were still more than 40 minutes before the closing meal. I heard the female supervisor (not tall, in black) say not to fill it up, and the rest
It's good to eat. . . . These words really shouldn't come out of the mouth of the waiter in a five-star hotel, let alone so loud that the next guests can hear it!
6) Caifeng Restaurant. The Cantonese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, the service is very good, found that there were small insects flying in and landed on the fruit plate, the waiter immediately changed it.

msg:The last time I lived was 7 years ago, and the accommodation was at the level of a guest house. This re-opening is indeed a lot more upscale. There are usually many guests in the summer vacation. It is hard to find one underground parking lot, and the ground is also full. It is recommended to improve the parking. The on-street parking in the courtyard is not very safe for parent-child hotels.
Compared with other hotels where the swimming pool needs to be charged separately in the hot spring, BBMG's swimming pool is now free for the guests, and only the hot spring is charged separately, which is really user-friendly. However, the swimming pool is more friendly to parents and children. It is slightly smaller and shallower for adults and older children who can swim, with a maximum depth of 1.4m.
There are not many people in the hot spring, the price is not cheap but the environment is good, Japanese style, and the area for children to play in the water is not small.
The hotel restaurant has breakfast buffet, weekday lunch and dinner a la carte. A la carte sandwiches and pasta are not expensive. Basically, I stayed for two days and ate one meal every afternoon (lunch at off-peak hours).
The little train and go-kart that I sent didn't go

msg:Let’s talk about the next itinerary first. On the first day, we departed from the West Second Ring Road at 10:30 in the morning, and went to Yudu Mountain and the Lake. Although the weather was not very good, I saw squirrels. I arrived at the hotel at 15:00 in the afternoon and checked in to go for a swim. Next to Wanda, I ate a Haidilao, and I saw the Winter Olympics Torch Platform passing by the Convention and Exhibition Center on the way. In the evening, we will walk in the gym on the large lawn of the hotel, and watch cartoons in the children's center. The next day, I slept late and had breakfast, then went to the small train karting, outdoor swings and slides, after checking out, I went to the hot spring and afternoon tea, and returned at 17:00, perfect!
Transportation: It takes one and a half to two hours on the road, which is really far. It is very interesting to pass through the Changcheng District in the middle. There is Wanda around the hotel. It is a 15-minute walk and it is convenient to eat.
Environment: The room is very spacious and very new. The hot spring is similar to a private soup. It is a small room and a small room. Because it is newly opened, it is very clean. , The steaming area and the swimming area are very few and clean. The children's water park is suitable for small babies. If the children are small, it is recommended to go directly to the water park in the hot spring. The water in the swimming area is cooler.
Hygiene: Both the room and the hot spring swimming are very clean. Bulgari bathing is used in the hot spring area. There is a sufficient supply of mineral water bath towels, which can be replaced at any time. This is really very good.
Service: The staff are enthusiastic. The staff who encounter the elevator will interact with the children to say hello and introduce the facilities. The staff in each area will also take the initiative to solve the problem.
Disadvantages: There are few varieties of breakfast, basically all parent-child activities are charged separately, unless you buy a package
As a parent-child hotel, it is still very good and worth a visit

The hot springs are all small pools, and they are all hotel guests, so it is not too crowded and there are many choices, which feels good. In particular, I am lucky to stay in the yoga double room this time, which is that there is an extra exercise area than the ordinary room. The room is equipped with a yoga ball and a yoga mat, which is very suitable for me, so I don't have to go to the gym before going to bed to practice . Overall it's worth coming back!

I read the reviews before saying that the meals in the package are not very good, so we didn't buy the package.

2. I bought a one-price all-inclusive coupon for the hotel, including dinner. The dinner is advertised as a buffet, but the dishes are very few and the quality is super poor. The dumplings and noodles are not like a five-star hotel but a farmhouse style.
3. The production of Chinese restaurants is also very poor. The fans in the fan pot are all glued together. What I do at home is better than this.
4. The service staff of the hotel's children's center is very rude. One night, they gave small gifts to children. We went to pick them up. They said that they had to take pictures and send good reviews to the children. I turned my head and walked away.

The swimming pool was too cold, and I had goosebumps all over my body. I couldn't stand it and hurried to take a bath. Bulgari's three-piece wash and care set was very fragrant.
There are not many key people. After checking out, I went to Shiyuan Tangquan, because the Hyatt review of Ctrip is not as good as Tangquan, but the service of Tangquan is too inferior to BBMG. Fortunately, there is Tangquan, or there is no attractive point. BBMG will refresh again, a good place for short trips during the epidemic🍦

Hygiene: Forgot to take pictures of the room, but it's very clean👍

Service: From the doorman to the front desk to the floor waiter, as well as the restaurant, gentle, lovely and friendly!


Environment: Picture 1 and picture 2 are the scenery in front of the hotel. It rained last night, so I took picture 3 in the restaurant. Picture 4 is the children's playground next to the hotel, suitable for children, as well as mini climbing, trampoline and swing. Seesaw, suitable for bringing children
The swimming pool of the hotel is in the hot spring next to it. It is clean and hygienic. The cleaning and care are all Bulgari. It is worth a visit!

The colorful children's club activities ➕ quiet and beautiful hot springs ➕ children's paddling pool provided by water toys free of charge, children have a lot of fun. The service is very good, even if individual questions cannot be answered immediately, it is a super nice attitude, which makes people feel comfortable, live at ease, and eat happily. Will recommend to my friends 🥰💗

There are dozens of semi-open single rooms in the hot spring, as well as a large children's water park, but you need to buy a ticket separately. When you book the hotel, the ticket for the hot spring is not included. It's quite cost-effective.

Rewards Club members still give away drink coupons and fruits, and Muyun Hot Spring has also opened, which is suitable for families with children to play. Adults relax in the hot spring and children play in the children's area, and there is no need to worry about the children's pool floor slipping. It's me Favorite particle floor, you can rest assured to let the baby play. The children liked the cake the hotel gave to the children, thank you very much. Of course, there are some small opinions. For example, the itinerary code of the health treasure should be recorded if the epidemic situation recurs, so that it is more comfortable to live in. Since there are many non-hotel guests in the resort area, of course, everything is still there after receiving the Winter Olympics. I'm recovering, I'll visit again slowly.

We checked in after one o'clock in the afternoon. There are many guests on weekends but it does not affect the experience. When we checked in, Miss Carol at the front desk helped us with the check-in. At that time, he helped arrange the room we liked. At the time of check-in, we also invited members to join us and gave them a welcome drink. , I also went to the children's activity center of the hotel. I am very satisfied with this stay. The hotel's environment, catering and hot springs are quite good, but the claw machine in the children's club is too difficult to grasp. I didn't catch it either, the child was a little disappointed, but everything else was fine.

The international school was on spring break, so it was a good time, we stayed for another day and changed our room back to the family suite. Family suites are in short supply, only one room per floor

In other words, the design is a waste of space, and it feels like a bed is missing. There is only one queen bed and one children's single bed for 4 people, so you have to have the feeling of sleeping on a sofa. But because my sister at home likes a separate bed, and the second child wants to sleep with me, so they are satisfied with what they need.

In the afternoon, go to the hot spring ♨️499 holiday single ticket, children under 120 are free. Tea and refreshments are available at the hot springs before 5 o'clock. The Japanese restaurant I went to for dinner only had finished simple meals, but the ingredients were still fresh. consumption is not expensive

Because everyone was blocked on the way home on the last day of the holiday, the hot spring was basically too cool. The facilities are new and high-end, the towels are always new, the water is clean and odorless, it's great

The children also had a good time. The water quality in childhood was good, but there were major safety hazards, so the slide toy area was closed.

Because there are fewer people at the end of the holiday, the staff are extraordinarily warm and feel at home.

I feel that the price of 1983 yuan is a bit expensive, but the experience is very good. I also got 2 SPA tickets of 200 yuan, so I can spend it next time!

Once again, I would like to praise Guo Yanli and Simi for their service throughout the entire stay at the hotel. I am very happy with the experience. I also hope that the level of the hotel will become higher and higher.

Breakfast buffet and Chinese food ordering, all tastes are online.

The environment is quite good, very special, with a large area and complete facilities. Indoor is better than outdoor, there are not many outdoor pools.
Besides parent-child, there is a children's club in the hotel, which is basically kindergarten level, so older children can't use it. Then the hotel will organize parent-child activities on the outdoor lawn, throwing sandbags in the ring, etc. It's okay, it's definitely better than nothing. The small train has to charge, bad reviews, haha. There are also some facilities such as swings, which are barely passable.
Finally, the service is very good overall. I liked the girl at the front desk who was wearing purple-red overalls, who was not tall, relatively white, with long hair and was thin. Almost all the requests were met, very thoughtful.
If 100 points out of 100, give it 80, the price/performance ratio is still poor.

I was satisfied with the speed and attitude of solving the problem. The types and environment of the pools in Muyun Hot Spring are very good. The types of buffets in the hotel, the replenishment speed of tableware and ingredients, and the service attitude of the staff are also very good. It is a pleasant stay experience.

msg:The Crystal at the front desk was so nice. The first experience of staying was very good. The day of check-in was the first day of the Qingming holiday. There were a lot of people, but it was not messy. I made some suggestions, and it didn't take long to check in. There are also many activities in the hotel, suitable for parents and children, and they will have a lot of fun. The water in the swimming pool is a bit cold, and the food on the second floor of the hot spring building is too bad. It is better to get a light meal cafe. The transportation of the hotel is convenient, the environment is very good, the management and service are also good, the breakfast is also good, and the indoor hardware facilities also meet the five-star standard. The scenery of Yanqing is also very beautiful, which makes people forget to return.

The room was new and comfortable, with a reasonable layout and very good sanitary conditions. The hardware and software were worthy of five stars! The main theme of the hotel is parent-child, which is very suitable for bringing children. All kinds of amu*****t facilities are complete, as well as a small train. The hotel is very large. There is a lake and a large lawn in the hotel, which is suitable for walking in the morning and evening. All in all, our whole family is very satisfied, and we will stay there next time we come to Yanqing!

msg:Location and transportation: It is very convenient to drive over from downtown Beijing for more than an hour. I thought it was the kind of hotel that does not go to the village or the store. I didn't expect that there are Wanda Plaza and many restaurants around. There are many choices for eating out.

Room view:
The family room we booked, there is a bed between the two beds, three people sleep without disturbing each other, and the child will not fall in the middle of sleep, easy to take care of, very good, the window can see the grass and water outside, the scenery Very good, the wash basin in the room is a single basin, which is inconvenient. It was very hot when I went to bed at night. I called the front desk and said that the air conditioner was not cooling, so I had to open the window to sleep all night, and the screen was dirty.

Serve:
When I entered the lobby, there was no one to answer and no one to guide me. I could only judge by feeling whether the front desk was on the left or on the right, and then I went to find it myself. When I checked in, it was after 1 pm, and there were very few people. Both counters were being processed, nearby There is no guide or the like. I just stood behind one of them and waited, while taking care of the children, I consulted with a passing waiter about the hotel's various children's activities. During this period, a fat woman unknowingly I skipped the queue and waited for the check-in with my husband and children. I thought about it and let her do it first, but this flash of thought made me wait for another fifteen minutes or so and it was endless. This woman has so many problems. I saw that the front desk staff kept calling and asking for instructions, and then another front desk staff came over, I couldn't help it! Their check-in ended only after my impatient shouting. Of course, the fat woman and I also had a very unpleasant quarrel. Before we checked in, I lost my mood in an instant. thing, very dissatisfied. Very dissatisfied. In fact, if the hotel has a guide to check in and assist customers in queuing, this kind of thing will not happen, or if you find that there are too many customers, you can arrange other waiters to check in the people behind at other counters, or check in for me Sometimes there are other ways to make up for it, but there is actually a solution.

swimming pool:
There are not many people in the swimming pool, the water temperature is reasonable, and the space for changing clothes is very small, only enough for a parent to work on the child there. As soon as I came out of the swimming pool, the ground was uneven, the child fell directly, his knees were broken, he cried all the way back to the lobby, went to the front desk to inquire about the location of the infirmary, and finally gave us two Band-Aids ➕ two iodophors, also No one came to take a look at the child. Is this the way this kind of parent-child hotel reflects the details? I suggest that you can go to some parent-child hotels in Sanya to study more.
The hot spring ♨ can go there if it is included in the package you bought. If it is not included, you need to pay 499 to buy a ticket for one person. Hotel guests are not free to use it. I went over and looked around. The children's area is closed and said that it will not be open until the next day , but does not affect the price of 499 tickets. Personally, the price of tickets is very high.
Buffet breakfast: I am disappointed with the breakfast. I feel that there are not many varieties and choices, and there are many repetitions. The fruit area is not only small but also of low quality. The coffee grind is very good. I drank two cups. The service staff of the restaurant are very enthusiastic and active, and their attitudes are very good.
Parent-child activities: The parent-child activities during the day are ok. We participated in the paid tent-building and kite-drawing and kite-flying activities. Although it is very sunny, the children are very happy. It is also good to get more sun.
In short, I can feel that the hotel is working hard, but it is still far from the ceiling level of a parent-child hotel. Since the location is so good and the hardware facilities are good, I hope that the software can be improved. I wish you better and better. .

msg:I lived in a certain luxury almost a month ago, which is in sharp contrast with the crown. They are all five-star hotels. The hardware will not be compared. Not as big as a certain luxury (a certain luxury is a real luxury, the rooms and the lobby are very large, and it has a luxurious a**osphere), but the room decoration is very children friendly, there are no hard corners such as furniture tiles and other hard corners exposed to the outside, and basically there are soft bags and bedside tables. I like the design very much. I can consider the decoration of my own home, especially the light switch, which is simple and not complicated. When talking about the restaurant, the breakfast restaurant (the name is very funny, called yu cafe) has a very enthusiastic service. When I saw that we had a baby, I took the initiative to ask about the dietary needs. We also made egg custard separately (children's tableware is particularly cute). The chefs in the pre-made area were very enthusiastic. They took the initiative to ask and introduce the food carefully, and helped to open the lid of the pot. The children ate very dirty, and the waiter did not complain about it. Clean it up immediately. The most important thing to talk about is service. The staff in the store are very kind and enthusiastic in every position. They will answer any questions. Even if they can't answer them, they will take you to the corresponding place. What surprised me was that the hotel would ask each guest about their stay experience (I didn't ask me when I checked out, at first I thought it was just a routine to pick a few guests to ask, but I didn't expect to call me specifically to ask about my stay experience, and I hope I can point out the shortcomings of the hotel. I am really relieved. I think this is the real embodiment of the five-star service, not a simple smile. experience. To talk about a few shortcomings, first of all, the hotel launched a hot spring package, but the front desk seems to be not very familiar with the package content (for example, two large and one small hot springs are actually four adult tickets, that is, check-in to check-out, two days, two per day, But there is no limit to the date, that is, four tickets can be used at the same time. The three of us want to soak once. In fact, the package ticket is enough.) But the waiter is not familiar with the rules of use, so we bought a separate ticket, and the extra The two of them didn't go to the next day because I didn't have time, which was a waste. Secondly, the hot spring and the hotel are not in the same building, and there is no corridor in the middle. It is necessary to go outside for a while. It is not very friendly to say that, it is strongly recommended to repair the corridor directly, otherwise it will catch up with the cold weather, and you will catch a cold as soon as you enter and exit! (Let me talk about it here, the hot spring in the hotel is really very good and has a special artistic conception. It can be said that it is the best decorated hot spring I have ever soaked in. Unfortunately, the children's swimming is not open, and I have not experienced it.) Busy with the baby, no How to take pictures, a few pictures are for reference only, the hotel is walking on a large lawn, and there are rivers around it, and there is a viewing platform by the river where you can sit and drink tea and chat and watch the scenery, I believe the scenery will be better in summer, just not. Do you know how many mosquitoes are there?

It is spacious, children can even ride a stroller here, the sound insulation of the house is very good, and the sound from the next door and outside can not be heard at all. There is a small children's amusement park in the hotel, there are ocean balls and a reading corner. There are also toys such as trampolines, swings, horses and other toys outside. When the weather is good, there are many children playing. In a cafeteria, it's normal. The buffet is ok, not amazing. The most amazing thing is the hot spring. It's really good. It's really good.

It is an open semi-private soup with compar**ents of various sizes. A family trip would be nice. One of the problems is that the room is not ventilated and too hot, but you can ask the front desk for a humidifier, and the other is that the swimming pool is not ventilated, and the eyes and nose will feel irritating.

The hotel focuses on parents and children. Even the executive lounge on the 7th floor has been changed into a parent-child activity center. There are different activities throughout the day, and there is a small playground for babies on the first floor.
The hotel's buffet breakfast is very...not 5 star, less and not tasty. The Chinese food on the first floor can be ordered alone, which is quite satisfactory.
There is a small train and small karting venue in the yard, as well as an outdoor playground. It is mainly for children to play, and occasionally a few young people come to experience it.
After a long turn, there is a holiday Inn and a decaying villa area in a courtyard.
The staff is ok, more careful and responsible, the elder brother at the door will remind parents and children to pay attention to the passing vehicles, the front desk efficiency is also relatively high, the response to guest inquiries is very fast, and it is also very fast to call the guest room to send the bed around.
I didn't have time to go to the hot springs, sorry.

msg:On 8.22, I stayed for three days and two nights, brought two 60-year-olds and a 3-year-old child, and booked two twin rooms;
Satisfied point:
1. I arrived at the front desk at 12:00 noon on Monday, and gave the room card directly. The two rooms are next to each other, facing the lawn in front of the hotel gate. I am satisfied with the room, and there is no decoration smell;
2. During the three days there, an old man and a child had their birthdays. I asked the front desk if I could send two cakes, and I readily agreed; the cakes are square, not bad, but sweet.
Dissatisfied points:
1. The hot spring package I bought includes dinner. The buffet dinners for two consecutive nights are exactly the same Chinese dishes. The best dish is the jiwei shrimp. Others are fried pork with beans, fried cabbage, egg fried rice, bacon, roasted Sausages, etc.; the dishes are very basic, so I can only give two to three stars; so it is recommended that if you stay for more than two nights, you should not buy a package with dinner. The package only includes a buffet for two adults, and extra people need to pay 128 a bit; you can go out one kilometer to Wanda to eat, or order takeout;
2. The hot spring packages are all two big and one small, there is no one big or one small. We are traveling with three big and one small, so I did not book a hot spring package in one of the rooms, and I will buy a single adult's hot spring ticket when I arrive. , 399 on weekdays; what is more embarrassing is that the staff always emphasizes that this is a one-time entry and exit ticket. I heard that you can actually go out and then come back, but we only had dinner for an hour in those two days. That’s all, I’m afraid my children won’t be able to take it after soaking for a long time. Not many people go to soak in the evening, but the room is very dark; the bath towels are changed frequently and it’s hot, and the mineral water is replenished quickly.

Summary: The price of 2800+ per night with a hot spring package can actually be considered in the mid-level of the bay; the hotel's breakfast will have more western-style refreshments than dinner, and the overall three and a half stars; the buffet dinner can only get two and a half stars; Diarrhea (In fact, most people actually go in and out twice a day, right? There are too many people in the hot springs, and the children have to sleep in the afternoon)

msg:The pursuit of quality carefully choose this hotel. On Friday, I wanted to take the kids out for a weekend on a whim. This is on the list on Ctrip, and the price is not cheap. When I booked it, it was already 2500 a night, only including breakfast. I thought this price, and Ctrip's main push should be good. But the reality is often the opposite. When we arrived, it was 6:30 on Saturday afternoon. First of all, there was no guard at the gate to guide the parking, and everyone was parking indiscriminately. Secondly, check-in was extremely slow. The three people in the front row took more than half an hour before it was our turn. Third, I asked the hotel if there were children's bathrobes, and the answer was no. Isn't this a family-friendly hotel? ? Fourth, thinking about driving for that long. Just eat the buffet in the hotel, the taste is really drunk, and the variety is not enough, but the taste level of the dishes can't be evaluated, I'm sorry for its five-star sign... The reception capacity is really limited, and the waiter zhan has to wait half a time to close the plate Hours, fifth, the pillowcases were dirty, the sheets smelled, and the bath liquid in the bathroom was gone. I called room service, but I didn’t come for half an hour. I waited in the bathroom for half an hour, and finally called again. Just got the call...

msg:The worst Intercontinental Crown I've ever lived in, the price is too low. I bought the 3499 package, and I took the children to stay on non-weekends. There are too few types of breakfast, and there is nothing to ask for. The funny thing is that the restaurant is not willing to turn on the dim lights. When I go to a Chinese restaurant, no one cares. I have to ask for tableware for a long time. The package included a Chinese-style set meal dinner, which was changed to a buffet by the hotel. I went to the front desk to ask what was going on. The service staff replied that the package was self-service, and the attitude was bad. You know this is a fraudulent act, and consumers can defend their rights. During the summer vacation, we stayed on non-weekends, and the basic reception capacity could not keep up. It feels like it hangs the name of Intercontinental, and it is a five-star hotel with a very poor sense of operation and experience.

Unable to cancel the order for 2 rooms and two nights to check in. The front desk told me that there was no room. Can I arrange only one executive suite? The front desk said to coordinate, I said yes, I will wait, the supervisor is coordinating during the period, I asked another front desk clerk to count the package coupons, and when the room is arranged, it can save time for check-in. As a result, the room has been coordinated for nearly an hour. I just arranged it. After the arrangement was made, the room coupon was wrongly given. He also confidently said that I had a problem with the understanding of the hotel package, and asked me to confirm with Ctrip. After the final confirmation, I was supplied with the room coupon while still expressionless. From beginning to end, the front desk service and the supervisor have been drooping faces, not a single word of apology or apology. This hour has already lost all my goodwill towards this hotel. The breakfast during my stay, regardless of the environment or quality, is not as good as the Holiday Inn Express under the brand.
Will definitely not stay in this hotel again in the future.
For the Crowne Plaza Hotel owned by IHG, it should not be considered in the future.

The room is also big and the price is very good. The breakfast was delivered in the morning, there are many varieties, and the children and husband were very satisfied. The service of the hotel is also in place, and the waiters are courteous, which made us have a very good stay experience this time.

The hotel presents a lot of children's activities. The children are very happy and the service is very considerate. Responsible, parents can be lazy, which is the most satisfying (PS: my children are older and younger, it is better to have parents take care of them), the food is okay, after all, the main thing is to play, the standard of self-help is also medium, catch up It is a pity that the hot springs are not open, but in general, it is still cost-effective to bring children to play

I feel that the details of Crowne Plaza are the most in place. As soon as you enter the lobby, in addition to temperature measurement, hand sanitizer, and masks, there are adults and children, and there are alcohol pads in the room to wipe the remote control. The most detailed thing is that the waiter took the seat at breakfast. After the seat was confirmed, several waiters came over to sanitize the table and wipe the table. Now this is an extraordinary period, I feel very relieved! The hardware of the crown is the latest. After all, it has not been long since it opened, but the room is still a little tasteful. The children's facilities are very good, but some are under maintenance in the off-season. If the main focus is parent-child, there can be more children's facilities. When you check in, the concierge service Pushing the luggage to the room, I went downstairs to the ba*****t to pick up my husband. The details are very good. When I checked out, the little girl at the front desk smiled sweetly. She asked me about my check-in experience. I can feel that this hotel cares about the guests. The best stay experience ~ I will go with my friends when I prepare for the summer ~ I hope the swimming pool will be open when I go again, it is best to have a children's swimming pool with a high water temperature

On the first day of New Year's Day, many children’s amu*****t facilities are provided, which is more deliberate; however, the hot spring center is still under construction and swimming is not allowed.

msg:We arrived at the hotel at around two o’clock in the afternoon and arranged a room on the third floor. After entering, I felt very cold. I never took off the down jacket. The air conditioner would be turned on and the room temperature would be 19-20, because I called to ask the day before. After checking the room temperature, the hotel customer service said that it was very warm, and thin pajamas would be fine, so I called the room service, and the service staff said to leave the air conditioner on and wait for a while, and said that the hotel was out of power today, so it’s cold, a five-star hotel It turned out that the room was extremely cold due to a power outage. I took it too. I made two calls in the middle, indicating that the temperature could not be maintained at all, and the child would catch a cold. After waiting for about forty minutes, the room temperature reached the highest 21 ℃, the hot air is normal temperature. The hotel finally agreed to change the room and moved to the fifth floor. This time it became extremely hot. The room temperature was 28℃, which couldn’t drop down. It was speechless and very dry. We asked for a humidifier. In addition, the room still smells of decoration. The off-flavor of the sewer in Figure 2 is particularly unpleasant. The child has suffered from allergic rhinitis after staying for two days.
    Figures 3 and 4 are for the children's center. The inside is very empty and there is nothing to play.
    Picture 5 and Picture 6 are the cleaned rooms. I really have never stayed in a five-star hotel where my clothes are not put in order.
    Figure 7 The hair dryer is also drunk. I remember this ancient hair dryer was made by the Express Hotel many years ago. It took a lot of my hair and kept getting in it.
    In addition, the hotel's room service phone is really difficult to make. Sometimes no one answers when the call is made, and sometimes someone answers after a short ten ringing. The response to all aspects of the service is really too slow.
    The breakfast type is also average. The only good point is that on the morning of New Year's Day, the service staff at the dining counter greeted the New Year very warmly. This is the only place that feels warm. When it comes to breakfast service, there are too many people to panic. Before I asked for tea or coffee, no one would care about it the next day.

There is a Kohler brand bathtub in the room, but it lacks rose petals. It is recommended that female friends prepare bath salts or bring rose petals to make yourself happy.

The hotel is cost-effective, Chinese restaurant service is good, Cantonese cuisine flavor, the dishes are a little bit sweet, less suitable for people.

Others are good, will patronize again.

msg:Crowne Plaza Badaling is a newly opened Yanqing hotel. It is in a relatively independent park with a small lake. The park environment is very good, but overall, it is not interesting to stay in winter. You may be able to go outing in summer. , slightly better. I brought my baby here at Chris**as. The hotel does not have a swimming pool or hot spring. There are some indoor children's activities. I paid an additional 200 yuan to participate. Overall, there is nothing to do. It is not worth it to squeeze the colored clay and dance. Although many children come, it is still suitable for business. I booked an ordinary double bed room. The facilities inside the room are quite good, the temperature is suitable, and the sound insulation of the room is pretty good. I can hear the noise from the next room in the corridor, but when I enter the room, I can't hear it anymore. I can only hear the corridor. I think the sound in it is pretty good. Then the management level of the entire hotel is worth complaining. It shows that before checking in, I called the hotel to confirm my reservation, and my information was clearly found. I also made some notes. When I checked in at the front desk, it said that my information could not be found. Booking information, this has never happened before. I bought afternoon tea in advance and made the reservation several days in advance. When I made the reservation, I received a clear reply, "Just come directly according to the time. You don't need to wait for the meal. You can eat it when you come." I am more cautious. Half an hour before I went to have afternoon tea, I made a special call to ask if the time was OK. After getting a positive reply, I arrived at the restaurant. I waited for almost an hour and was urged numerous times before the meal was served. There were only a few tables of customers in the entire restaurant, and there were only a few waiters. One of them kept saying "the restaurant is too busy", and I didn't know what he was busy with. . . When I asked for a pot of water, I was told "there is no pot". To urge the meal to be served, the waiter had to go to the kitchen to urge me. There was no phone or intercom. . . I was speechless when I saw that the little waitress had a nice attitude and was busy with her work but couldn't do anything. Then the afternoon tea was very unpalatable. Including having breakfast in the back, passing by the lobby, and checking out, I saw guests complaining and arguing all the time. I really encountered many cases, which shows that the hotel's management problems are not isolated cases. Most of the service staff I encountered were relatively young, and they all had sincere smiles and were really trying their best. However, they really couldn't solve various problems, so I could only say "Come on." In addition, in the winter, the lobby, restaurant, and children's playground on the first floor are really cold, and you need to wear down jackets. This is a bad review. The children's playground is small in size and freshly decorated, but there is no management. Adults and children can go in wearing shoes. There are many ocean balls, soft bags and other areas where shoes need to be taken off. It is very embarrassing and the hygiene is worrying. I think if there is no overall improvement, it is not worth a special trip to stay. If you come to Yanqing on a business trip, you can still choose.

🔔Service: The quality of service staff is good, polite and enthusiastic are very moderate. In terms of epidemic prevention, they are also very strict, reminding them in a timely and appropriate manner, which is not annoying at all.

🧹Hygienic: It's very clean. The cub crawls around on the ground, and his clothes are not particularly dirty. Even the taste of new decoration is still acceptable.

facility:
The hot spring was not opened and the swimming pool was temporarily unavailable, which affected the arrangement;
Outdoor children’s trampolines and slides are blocked, and there is nothing to play;
The door to the outdoor children's playground is locked, and you can only go on a very simple temporary ladder. The ladder is a bit swayed and there are too many thorns on it;
The indoor children’s play area did not ask for a change of shoes at the door. The bear children also love slippers and run freely. After playing around, the soles of the socks are uniform gray and black...

Even if the breakfast is the most hindrance, there are few varieties and it is not suitable for the taste.

At present, it seems that business travel is still OK, and it is a bit tasteless to bring a baby.

🚗Transportation: It is still very convenient. Starting from Madian Bridge of the North Third Ring Road in the morning, coming all the way to the Beijing-Tibet Expressway, it will arrive at Yanqing within an hour.
🍞Breakfast: available from 6:30, rich in variety, both Chinese and Western
Cover, noodles, chaos, fried rice, bread, juice, salad, fruit, etc.
🅿Parking P: There are fewer ground parking spaces, and you can park directly into the hotel basement. Free parking is provided, and the elevator goes directly to the lobby.
🌴Environment: The room layout is reasonable, the bathtub is comfortable, and the sockets are more digital or electronic products are charged and used at the same time.
🏨 Surrounding facilities and attractions: There is Wanda Plaza within one kilometer of the hotel, where you can eat, shop, and entertain one-stop! There are also many scenic spots in the surrounding area. You can reach Wild Duck Lake, Guyaju, Yudu Mountain, Badaling Wildlife Park, etc. within 40 minutes! This time the second visit to Yanqing, the Expo Park we went to was sp****ly populated and the air was good!
👏Service: This time I stayed at the Crown, I felt that the service was very good, from the warm greetings of the beauty at the front desk when I checked in, to arranging the room near the elevator with the lake view, and to assisting in membership registration, warm and thoughtful! During the period, I went to the restaurant many times for afternoon tea and breakfast, and I also experienced the warm and thoughtful service! In short, Crown's warm and thoughtful service has left a deep impression on me. I believe I will choose to stay in Crown again!

Finally, a reminder to the friends who will be staying in: Maybe the reason for the current season changes, the air conditioner only provides warm air, but the house is very hot during the day, and how low the air conditioner is is also the hot air. At this time, turn off the air conditioner, open the windows, and the room temperature In order to balance to a comfortable temperature🙂

It was quiet at night, and the service staff were enthusiastic, but unfortunately the swimming and hot springs were not open yet. In addition, the quilt in the room is a bit hot, and children who don’t turn on the air-conditioner still wear the quilt, and have to open the window to sleep on a snowy day. If there is a thin quilt to choose from.

Perhaps because of the inability to leave Beijing during the epidemic, the rooms in the suburbs were full on weekends and cleaning was a little slower. Checking in at 4 pm still had two rooms not cleaned. However, the attitude of the staff at the front desk and the guest room was very good, and they gave the meal coupons as compensation. The whole family left a good impression on the whole night in a hurry, waiting for the hot spring to reopen before going back.

msg:I have seen mixed reviews, so I can experience it for myself. Generally in line with the configuration and service conditions of a 5-star hotel. When getting off the bus, someone took the initiative to help with luggage, and the luggage can be stored, very caring and enthusiastic. As the room has not been sorted out when checking in, the front desk staff took the initiative to explain patiently and keep abreast of the progress notifications. It is a little regrettable. Due to the large number of people on holidays and long check-in time, it is recommended that children with children can go to the hotel or take a rest in the car later. The taste of the Chinese restaurant is quite satisfactory, clean, and the service is very patient. There are free refreshments in the coffee shop in the afternoon to allow people to take a break. This is an out-and-out parent-child hotel. There are many outdoor activities for children around. The hotel tells you when you check in that you can take your children to participate in various activities. The family room is very convenient, with children and the elderly living in, comfortable and quiet to rest. The whole hotel is newly renovated, the style is relatively bright, which makes people's eyes shine. The customer service is also very attentive, and the things needed are delivered as soon as possible. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes good. The restaurant staff will take away the tableware as soon as possible. The restaurant manager will also pay attention to the dining situation of the guests from time to time, fill up the meal in time, and be in order. The elderly and children liked the experience of staying this time.

msg:I stayed at the Crowne Plaza BBMG Badaling for two days on November. The hotel is marked as a five-star hotel. Actually, all aspects may not reach the so-called five-star. The first check-in was a male receptionist similar to an intern, and the check-in was very slow. I did it for about 20 minutes. I was unskilled in business. I took luggage from the underground garage and went to check in with large and small bags, but no one paid any attention. There was a waitress pushing a luggage trolley, looking at our luggage, and didn’t even say hello. If I hit it, I didn’t see it. The service attitude was unsatisfactory. The main hotel is a parent-child hotel, which claims to have a children’s playground. Actually, it is second to the shop at the door. There are no indoor amu*****t parks to play. They are all machines that scan code and spend money. Outdoors are similar to the fitness equipment in the park. There is nothing to play with when the children come. Let’s talk about the guest rooms. Although it was opened last year, the facilities are a bit outdated, the cleaning is OK, and there is drinking water. Which five-star hotel uses ice dew? It’s ridiculous. I spend 50 cents a bottle in the supermarket. With more than 3,000 room rates and drinking ice dew, it feels ridiculous to think about it. In the restaurant of the hotel, every employee feels that they have eaten bitter melon. Even if they don’t say hello, they have a drooping face and don’t know how to train. . Before eating breakfast, there was an old man coughing at the next table. He seemed to be choked. I didn't see any waiter who came out to help. He coughed for a long time and asked other tables how to eat? The nausea is broken. The fruits in the restaurant are just the same every day, and the melons do not remove the seeds. Big 79 also removes the seeds. The five-star level is at this level. Before leaving, I checked out and talked to the little girl at the front desk about these problems. Bai said, even if it's unlucky, it took thousands to stay in a fake five-star hotel.

msg:Stayed for two nights during the Qingming Festival. I booked it on Ctrip. I paid 5498 online for two nights. I had already paid online. When I went to the front desk to check in, the receptionist asked if it was an official booking. The fee plus the deposit totaled 4500. At that time, I was next to my child and my husband to pay. She also asked us about breakfast. I said that I didn’t have breakfast when I booked it. She said that breakfast could be delivered. When I picked up my phone, I found that I had already paid online. Why did they deduct another 4500 from me? So I went back to the front desk to communicate, but the front desk didn’t admit it. Hotel The room fee plus the deposit was only 4500, but Ctrip wanted more than 5400, which was more than 1000 more expensive than the hotel. Ctrip was such a rip-off... So I went to the hotel to negotiate a refund with Ctrip, but the hotel refused to admit it, saying that 4500 was a deposit and no room fee was charged. Isn't this a rip-off... After that, the hotel refused to admit it, and said that Ctrip would handle it. Anyway, the hotel was full of lies throughout the process, so I won't describe them one by one. I can only say that this hotel has a very bad reputation and I will not choose it again in the future. The place is shabby, and those who are not afraid of being ripped off should be cautious! You can make money, but you will have to pay it back sooner or later if you go against your conscience.

msg:We arrived before the Qingming Festival. The day before the festival was basically full, and everyone came with children, but I think I should not be the only one who found out that this is not a family-friendly hotel. This hotel is relatively new, but The decoration and furnishings are basically the standard of ordinary business hotels, which are not compatible with the stars. Children's Paradise can't be more rudimentary. Not only is it small and pitiful, but it has nothing and is empty. I don't even know what to do with so many children there. When we arrived, the lobby was empty, and we didn't see any concierge who would help with luggage or something. Even the front desk had a very general attitude. , came to the front, did not say hello, I only responded after I took the initiative to say hello. The experience is very poor. If it is a parent-child experience, then I think this one should be negative 100%. Don't be fooled by those with children. But there is one thing to say, the hot spring next to it is really good, but please pay attention to buy a package in advance, otherwise you will have to pay extra, and the prices of 399 and 499 are not cheap. The breakfast here is also very ordinary, there are not many kinds to eat, and a young man with long hair in the restaurant has a bad attitude. This hotel invites me to stay for free, and it is impossible for us to go there again. For parents and children, it may be 100 grades worse than clubmed. There is nothing, no service, and they are too embarrassed to call it a parent-child hotel. This is deceiving consumers, and it is extremely disgusting.

msg:The hotel’s greenery and environment are good, surrounded by small rivers, large lawns, and ducks, geese, and geese roaming in the water. There is an underground parking lot and the elevator directly leads to the rooms upstairs. The rooms are spacious and the facilities are very new. Stayed for two nights and talked about the shortcomings: 1. Room hygiene, the disposable shampoo package used by a guest was left in the shower room, and there was hair near the shampoo bottle; 2. The room was dewormed, and it caught up with one. The brown-black flower spider landed in front of the sky from the sky. Fortunately, the light was turned on and the light was spotted and eliminated in time (Picture 1). It was horrible. After checking the room, it was found that there were spider webs elsewhere (Picture 2); 3. Breakfast The dishes are quite plentiful, but the bacon from the next day is hard to chew. It is seriously suspected that the leftover is reprocessed, so the meat slices have been burnt. It is necessary to eliminate waste, but it is also wasteful for the guests to eat it. , It’s just that the main body of wasting food is different. Instead of doing this, it’s better to adjust the dishes in time when there is less passenger flow; 4. Chinese restaurant, once used for lunch, including a total of 3 tables and 7 people in our lobby, it is said that there are still guests in the private room, at least two in the lobby. The dishes on the table lasted more than 40 minutes. The guests at the next table were dissatisfied with waiting for the dishes for too long. They asked the reason and had to withdraw the dishes. A waiter explained that "because the leader was dining", everyone was dumbfounded. What kind of restaurant's operating ideas can make It doesn’t matter if the kitchen cooks the leader’s meal first and keeps the guests waiting for a long time? The service attitude of the actual restaurant waiters is very good, and I have repeatedly apologized for keeping us waiting. Near the hotel is Wanda, it is very convenient to eat, it does not matter not to eat in the hotel.
Generally speaking, it’s not bad. I hope to strengthen the detailed management and improve the service after the experience of the Winter Olympics.

msg:A five-star hotel that is not enough for a five-star standard. Although very new, the carpets in the corridors and interiors are very old. As soon as I walked in, I saw a lump of hair on the ground. I probably forgot to suck it away. A few more steps are the snack crumbs dropped on the floor by the guests in front. There is a pink unknown object on the side of the bathtub that can be wiped off. The pillowcases have not been renewed unless the storage room of this hotel is so large that every pillowcase does not need to be folded. The phone in my friend's room is covered in dirt. After staying for three days, the breakfast was exactly the same, with few choices and it was not delicious. Every day after I arrived, I called the waiter to clean up the mess left by the guests in front, and the waiter wiped it twice and left, and never really wiped it (wipe it with a wet wipe). There is no one at the coffee machine to make coffee most of the time, so you can only queue up at the self-service coffee machine. On the first day, my friend and I didn't drink when we saw the team. I have always wanted to try a hand-made coffee and haven't given me this opportunity for a few days. There is very little children’s play at present, and the pool hot springs are out every day because there is basically nothing to play because they are not open for the time being. The room smells like a fresh air blower or smells. When it rained in Room 1735, water dripping from the window onto the platform outside the window was very noisy, and I didn't sleep well all night. There is no sound when there is something outside the window of my friend’s room, so I suggest improvement.
The overall experience is not very good, but the location is good, close to Wanda and many attractions.

Thank you very much.
Due to the impact of the epidemic on this trip, a 7-day free tour in Chengdu was originally scheduled one month in advance, but the refund was not processed. Changed to a tour around Beijing, I chose to choose Yanqing, and I chose Crowne Plaza Beijing Badaling, because the evaluation is that the hotel facilities, personnel services, meals, etc. are the best in the local area. Bring the baby every year A summer trip can’t be too stingy, it must be enjoyable, so every time I choose a hotel, I choose one from a hundred miles. It must be the most satisfactory. I am not disappointed. Next time I come to Yanqing, I will choose Crowne Plaza Hotel! Thanks again to the lady on duty manager at the front desk, thanks!

Before leaving, I asked for a bag of ice packs of old father’s insulin at the restaurant, and gave a big bag very happily. The restaurant and room service were good. The check-in speed at the front desk is relatively slow...

🧹Sanitation: The sanitation in the hotel is better. I saw a worker in the next room doing cleaning. Two people took a rag and wiped the faucet. The room was very clean. The water quality of the lake around the hotel is average. A drain on the lake side discharges green sewage. The baby accidentally stepped on it during a walk, and when it fell down, the whole trip was on the ground, and the back was very dirty.

There is a large lawn in front of the hotel, suitable for chasing and fighting, flying kites, and sitting leisurely by the lake to watch the big white geese and big black geese in the lake. The hotel is beautiful under the lights at night.

🚗 Transportation: By car, there is a Wanda Plaza and a Wal-Mart supermarket within 2 kilometers of the surrounding area. There are underground parking lots and parking is convenient.
Walking the baby: I went with two babies at home. The baby loves the hotel's 2-meter-wide bed very much. It bounces around from sofa to bed to sofa. I’m not satisfied with the hotel’s indoor and outdoor children’s play areas. There are not many indoor play facilities. They are basically coin-scanning and spending money, including game consoles, gashapon machines, and claw machines. It’s really speechless. But the books in the picture book area are very good, really good, recommended. The outdoor play area is very small, only swings can be played, the slides are not open, alas. There are many guests with children in the hotel.
Surrounding tourism: 15 kilometers to Longqing Gorge, 4 kilometers to the Garden of Death, very close, not bad.

msg:Crowne Plaza Yanqing has changed the impression of Crowne Plaza in the past, somewhat exceeding expectations.
Transportation: Ten minutes' drive from Yanqing Station, from Xizhimen Beijing North Station High Speed Rail, you can check into the hotel in less than an hour, there is no traffic jam. The hotel is located in Yanqing City, it is very convenient for both dining and surrounding attractions.
Environment: The hotel is in the hot spring resort. The three hotels are the best. The entrance is a large lawn. During breakfast and dinner, the children eat and enjoy the paradise. In front of the lawn is an artificial lake where ducks and geese roam leisurely.
Facilities: The design of the bamboo forest in the hotel lobby is unique. There is an indoor children’s play area on the right, and there is a swing trampoline sand pool connected to the outdoor. The cute clown will perform magic tricks and make various balloons for children from time to time, which is very popular with children. .
Service: This is the most commendable. I arrived around ten in the morning and checked in immediately, and the check-out assistance was postponed until two in the afternoon. The overall feeling is very warm and responsive.
Before booking, I was worried about the decoration pollution. After all, it is a new hotel, but the actual feeling is that except for the corridor of the hotel room, which is slightly decorated, the room and other places are basically tasteless. During the epidemic, you can't go out of Beijing. The cool Yanqing with comfortable hotels is indeed very recommended!

msg:In order to go to Yudu Mountain, I chose this hotel. It is not far from the scenic spot. There is also Wanda Shopping Mall. It is very convenient to eat and drink. Besides, the newly renovated facilities of the hotel are good and the area is relatively large, but the double-edged sword is that the room has a smell. It’s not a small stay for a day. It’s a few more days. It’s definitely not. The children’s playground has both indoor and outdoor parts. It will be good if you play with an ocean ball. The picture book on the wall is very good. The variety is more and the taste is okay. The coffee has to wait in line and it’s a little slow. It is recommended that the waiter can deliver the seat to the table, which will be better. The service is more thoughtful. The checkin is very slow. At that time, we arrived at three o’clock in the afternoon and said the room was not cleaned up. The on-site coordinated checkout Very convenient and asked about the accommodation experience and said that there will be hot springs and swimming pools, it would be perfect

msg:Affected by the epidemic during the summer vacation, I cannot go out of Beijing and I can only bring my children to stay in this hotel. Parking is very convenient. The hotel has a large green space and water surface, and you can also overlook the mountain peaks and the scenery is pleasant. Stayed in a big bed room, the room is very large, complete with bathtub facilities. The room is presented with a dinner set for two persons, but the dishes are not the same as the advertised recipes. The grade and quantity of the dishes have been reduced. The hotel explained that there are too many guests. In order to meet the real-time effect of the dishes, they can only be adjusted to be possible. The dishes served quickly. Fortunately, the amount of set meals is acceptable, and a meal for two is enough for two large snacks and one snack. Breakfast is included in the room rate, and there are many varieties, but if you buy it separately, the cost performance is not high. The hotel also presented tickets for electric karts and small trains for one big and one small. Overall, the hotel is very good, suitable for bringing children to visit Yanqing. The current price is worth recommending the experience.

msg:The hotel is strategically located in the core area of Yanqing Holiday Accommodation. It is about half an hour away from the ticket office of famous scenic spots such as the Expo, Longqing Gorge, Yudu Mountain, etc. It takes about half an hour by personal test. Due to the long Panshan Road, it is far from the entrance of Baili Gallery. The driving time is about 1 and a half hours. If you plan to go to Yudu Mountain and Baili Gallery scenic spots, it is recommended to be driven by an experienced driver; the external environment of the hotel is very good. Checking in at the beginning of August, the temperature is very cool compared to the urban area, and there is no obvious feeling Wet, the water system in the park, the green area is large, and there are outdoor activities areas for children, which can be hydrophilic, play sand, slides, swings, etc.; the hotel’s internal facilities are complete, almost brand new, and most of the hardware equipment is Schneider and other international brands. Quality assurance, Clean and tidy; the hotel’s service is satisfactory, the waiter takes the initiative to inquire, and the attitude is comfortable, neither artificial nor embarrassing; the hotel is thoughtful in detail, providing children with game facilities and clowns, balloons and other links; the hotel’s breakfast style is rich, ten Order closed meal, but the buffet dinner style is limited that night. I was told that it is a semi-buffet type for the time being. Of course, the dinner fee has also been discounted accordingly. The lemonade in the Chinese food area has been kept warm and very intimate; the only regret is that because the hotel has just been built The decoration taste is still a bit heavy, the windows have been kept open, and the air-conditioning has been turned on... Generally speaking, when you come to stay in Yanqing, I recommend this hotel, suitable for families with children!

From the experienced manager of the hotel, the director of customer service Zhang Qiong, the head of concierge, Xiaotang, and the director of the cafeteria Xiaofeng, I feel professional, enthusiastic and responsible, they will take the initiative to chat with the guests, and will give me a detailed explanation of the questions. Try to satisfy all the requirements. Special thanks to the concierge's sister, Xiao Tang, who helped me with all her troubles, took the paper cup and offered to help me get the express at the gate, even when she happened to see my daughter learning English, she also offered to tell me if there is anything she could ask her, I know her English is very very good!

The breakfast is rich and the buffet on Saturday night is also very rich. I also experienced the richness of the Chinese restaurant. The small restaurant tastes good, and the dishes can be half-served to eliminate waste. This is not the case in other hotels. The staff are very good and patient. The hotel has free parking. You can park on the ground and underground. There is also a children’s playground. Very satisfied with the hotel I will visit next time

The children participated in handmade lessons such as making sushi and chocolate, and they were also given small certificates and prizes. The children were very happy... This summer vacation, there are no activities, and there are also people on the weekends. A lot more... The experience is not as good as last time. But the service can still keep up. The restaurant manager Huang (male) and the guest room manager Ding (male) feel that the business is very professional and the service is also very good. Although the decoration of the room feels heavier, but in the end it helped us to solve it, so I will go next time. Nearby places to play are Longqing Gorge (recommended), Wild Duck Lake (recommended), Baili Landscape Gallery (personal feeling is average).

總體感覺這裏的軟件比硬件要好，員工都很和善，看到的都會主動問好，很親切，會主動幫忙拿行李。
温泉比較日式，很幸運剛巧有個小單間。也有小童區，水流池也不錯，有充氣設備就是功率有點小，我家的游泳圈打了10min😅
我們去的那天電梯壞掉了，去二樓還要爬樓梯，而且吃飯的地方賊冷，不知道是不是不想讓大家吃太多免費東西，希望改進一下，不然小孩子很容易凍感冒。
一些小童活動都比較適合大寶寶，我們沒有參加，希望多一些低幼寶寶的。
早餐中規中矩，種類偏少，不過看到了給嬰幼兒準備的米糊之類的，覺得很貼心。

酒店還帶有温泉，大概50多個池子，泡完熱湯，舒服。還有室外池，一邊下雪一邊泡是完美了。

泳池衣櫃打不開，讓顧客自己摸索了三次，顧客來回跑。一共搞了十幾分鍾，工作人員才前去幫忙打開。


自助餐端上來的海鮮是半冷的，生蠔也是不新鮮的。
去湯粉湯麪區打個菜，當時就兩個顧客，要的是純燙菜，工作人員已經忙糊塗了，不記得我要的菜是哪個。把我的菜給了別人。
小孩的小童泳池，温泉區裏的，滑梯下來防撞的海綿墊已經全爛了。沒有防撞能力。
温泉區全是人，各種排隊。出門也找了很久，沒有引導標語。
健身房設施太少，衹有啞鈴，和兩個啞鈴凳，其餘就是跑步機。
温泉環境倒是不錯。
小孩玩的東西多。
總之，能感覺到平日裏來還行，節假日這人流，管理混亂，工作人員都忙飛了。需要管理人員集中培訓，提高服務水平。

温泉是個吐槽點：寫着含下午茶，其實這下午茶聊勝於無，還不如不寫。頂多算有茶水供應和兩三樣水果，還得在下午1-4的固定時段。另外帶着兩個娃，去體驗了温泉，超過150的孩子補了成人票399。可是有個孩子120剛剛過了一點，原本服務員也沒要求補票，孩子淘氣自己去身高尺那裡量身高，比劃了一下，服務員立馬黑着臉説補100小童票。感覺這100花的，是因為惹前台不高興了。總之，温泉這邊硬件可以，服務差點，相對於平時299，假日399的價格，十分不匹配。

酒店衞生不錯，工作人員也都很和藹，房間的部分設計也帶着一點小巧思，總體好評～衹有餐飲部分略需加強，園區旁邊有萬達，不在酒店就餐也能自行解決。
表揚一下Quella同學，服務很貼心，尺度把握得也很好，積極響應需求的同時又不會覺得被打擾。

唯一的bug是早餐種類不是很豐富，尤其是西餐甜點，略微減分啦。

msg:酒店整體入住挺好的，接待的服務人員以及酒店的設施都很滿意。
但是酒店的一些套路讓人非常不滿意，購買的套餐包含世葡園門票1大1小，票面寫包含萌寵樂園項目，1，世葡園需要開車半個小時才能到達，距離遠；2，帶娃去的一家三口，這個套路就是為了賺取另外一個大人的門票錢，這個可以忍，但是，門票60，沒有任何票據（門票or收據），以及付款依據，且園子裏什麼都沒有，徒步走到萌寵樂園門口很遠，暴曬，沒有乘涼休息的地方；3，購票時明確了要去萌寵樂園，門衞衹要求馬上付錢補另外一個大人的門票費用，並未告知萌寵樂園中午閉園，一行人暴曬下到達萌寵樂園，牌子顯示已關閉，下午再營業，整個園區毫無服務意識可言，非常坑人。
建議帶娃的家長慎重考慮該酒店的套餐，套路滿滿。

msg:白瞎了這個“洲際旗下”的名頭
一、住宿：1、沒有服務生幫忙拿行李，以為人家沒有這項服務呢！但是第二天看到服務生幫其他人推行李箱了…這很難評。
2、酒店走廊和房間味道極大，但通風一小時再回來就沒味道了。
3、酒店房間內整體衞生清潔不到位，具體表現隨處可見的灰塵和污漬（例如化粧鏡背面和水吧蓋上蓋以後的一圈茶杯印）確實沒拍照，影響心情。
4、馬桶竟然會晃？！是底座晃不是馬桶圈晃。下水道反味。
二、温泉：體驗很好，毛巾充足，服務熱情
三、就餐：晚餐選了中餐，彩豐什麼什麼館？具體忘了 也懶得去看了，服務員態度極好，如果不想吃西餐的話 這家店味道也不算差，但杯子裏有一根頭髮，告知服務員後，她衹説換一個杯子，連道歉都沒有，以為我們自己掉進了頭髮然後要換杯子嗎？抱歉，我們都是短頭髮。早餐自助中規中矩。
四、遊樂：我們沒有參與任何酒店組織的親子課程，孩子不夠大 所以不評價。但是小火車、卡丁車、彩虹滑道、乒乓球桌球一個沒落下，都是退房前不錯的選擇。
以上所有評價真實客觀，僅供參考，無圖有真相。

這家酒店不像世園湯泉似的，人烏央烏央的，早餐食品味道不錯，種類也多，而且有空位，這個很關鍵喲。
酒店周圍小朋友玩的東西也挺多的。
最喜歡屋裡的大浴缸，好舒服，一邊聽歌，一邊喝茶，一邊放鬆。
温泉很棒，元宵節去的，沒有什麼人，小房子私密性也不錯，小童水上樂園雖不大，夠孩子耍了。
還有下午茶，水果很新鮮很甜，還有小蛋糕卷。

北京後花園的一處純温泉
雖然整體酒店和温泉並不大，但是設備設施都很新，足夠家庭休閑旅行
建議：如果純泡温泉，住一天足夠
如果還想逛一下週邊，住2天也就差不多了

這次去和上次不同之處是體驗了小童活動，出乎我意料之外的好。課程非常有意思，不是敷衍的那種低幼活動，活動的工作人員超級温柔，孩子沒玩夠，希望以後的課程能越來越多。
今年的雪地遊玩面積比去年也更大，滑梯自由啊，就是滑一趟走的有點遠，當鍛鍊身體了，步道維護不太好，很滑，這點要改善了就真的完美了。
感覺今年的酒店各方面比去年都有進步，之前點評中的負面問題是真的有用心在改進，去延慶帶孩子住的不二選擇啊。

酒店房間很大，設施齊全，乾淨整潔，房間的桌子讓大寶閑暇之餘還可以趕趕作業。
酒店的温泉超級贊，人不多，很清凈，50多個湯池可供選擇，兩個孩子更是在小童池玩的不亦樂乎，u平時繁重的學習壓力，很少見孩子們這麼開心，終於不用擔心他們偷着玩手機了。温泉池有多處水壓按摩的設定，非常有助於緩解疲勞。

再説入住感受：早餐晚餐自助，中規中矩的五星，鐵板的部分感覺有點亂，雞排糊掉了，牛排有點老，可能趕上人多所以廚師有點急了，不是很好吃。蛋糕放的久了有點幹了。

温泉大讚，環境好，人少，舒服，私隱好，孩子還有嬉水樂園，玩的美極了。

酒店外有小童娛樂設施和水系，很適合孩子玩。服務設施的工作人員也很有耐心，非常友好。舒心的假期~以後還會選擇這家酒店~強烈推薦！

自助晚餐，小300元，性價比沒有。
中餐廳，上菜非常慢，流程混亂，投訴多。但個人感覺味道還是不錯的。
小朋友的活動參加了一個，特別好。
整體酒店環境也不錯，比較大。
繼續加油吧

餐飲上自助早餐和晚餐還算是符合五星的標準，味道上無功無過吧，美中不足的就是週末早餐人有點過多了，現打咖啡還出現了排隊，也可能是趕巧遇到了兩場會議導致住店客人較多。
床軟硬度比較合適，床品感覺也不錯，多年來酒店中一直最喜歡皇冠假日的枕頭，高度適中～
特別感謝管家小姐姐Krystal，小姐姐人美心善態度好，還為寶寶們提供了小童洗浴品，拖鞋，腳凳和蕎麥皮枕頭，棒棒噠～

1.剛到酒店，一個沒有穿工作服的男子在門口還有車位的情況下指揮讓我們停地下，進門一看是有團體的商務活動，可能是給他們留車位的吧
2.孩子一歲半，前台辦入住直接説了沒什麼適合這麼小的孩子的地方和玩法
3.温泉下午茶，到的時候快結束了，問了還有沒有，回覆可以吃，我們就進去了，服務員把餐盒推出來，擺在離餐桌不到20米的地方，喊我們自己過去去取？推着車不是送到餐桌而是送到廚房門口？
4.温泉小童池的水温也是不太高，大人池還可以
5.中餐廳點菜，飯都吃完了，還有一個菜居然説忘記下單，之前催過兩遍了還沒發現？
6.去的當天不是週末，前台説自助衹對商務團隊開放，所以商務談事避免不了喝酒抽煙，所以等電梯也是一聞就知道
本來定了兩天，第二天一早直接要求退房去了別家親子酒店…帶小寶寶的體驗真的很不好，太偏商務了

稍微提一下，游泳池不咋地，服務跟不上，1更衣室有蒼蠅；2室外40度的高温，游泳池裡給孩子冷的嘴都紫了…不過要不是這麼冷，估計這個小泳池更煮餃子

皇冠家族小童活動:時間原因衹參加了咘咘兔派對，三位姐姐氣氛帶動得很好，十分有親和力，小朋友都玩兒瘋了。

早餐:標準五星級酒店自助早餐，額外有一些本地特色，煎餅味道也不錯。

再説房間設施，在五星級酒店裡中規中矩，但是小童用品比較齊全，適合親子出行。

給的，又不是攜程給的，同樣入住酒店，為什麼就不享受了呢？這個也受歧視啊？排了半天辦理入住時問了一嘴還享受升房服務嗎？居然告訴我，這項服務不是都享受的，服了。

首先，酒店的房間非常舒適。我們升級了房型，房間更加寬敞明亮，裝飾精美，床鋪柔軟舒適。在房間裏，我們可以欣賞到美麗的景色，放鬆身心，享受難得的寧靜時光。
其次，酒店的各項設施也非常出色。酒店提供了豐富多樣的早餐，可以滿足不同人的口味需求。酒店還配備了温泉池，水質清澈，泡在裏面非常舒適。特別是小童樂園，孩子們可以在那裡玩得非常開心，還有專門的工作人員照顧孩子，讓我們放心地享受自己的假期。
最後，我要特別感謝管家Joanna。她非常熱情周到，幫助我們解決各種問題，還幫我們升級了房間，讓我們感到非常驚喜和滿足。在整個旅程中，她一直關心我們，讓我們感到賓至如歸，真的非常感謝她。
總的來説，我非常推薦八達嶺皇冠假日酒店，這是一家非常出色的酒店，擁有一流的設施和服務，讓人流連忘返。如果你來北京旅遊，一定要來這裏住上幾天，享受難得的休閑時光。

msg:酒店的設計非常走心，方便以外也很有品味，温泉的價格算比較貴的，但品質也很好，大小池子多，設計的又挺巧妙保證了私隱，還會有一頓下午茶，泳池的水温合適，乾淨衞生，小童戲水池略微單調了點，隨時都有水和浴巾大大的好評。房間中規中矩，家庭房中間的沙發翻出來是個很大的床，孩子睡得很舒服，空氣不好還可提供空氣凈化器，酒店本身很讓人滿意。唯一的遺憾是小童遊玩的東西少了點，聽説有個活動中心在裝修，如果比較有規模的話那就完美了。

1. 房間冰箱不製冷
2. 泳池需要去温泉那邊，而且開放時間較晚。早晨想游泳需要等到10點。

西餐廳的午餐牛排和披薩等主菜都沒法做，這點不好，但是能做的菜品餐量比較實惠；中餐廳的菜味道中規中矩。自助早餐比較豐富，整餐體驗不錯，但像炒菜類菜品口味欠佳。
小童俱樂部孩子非常喜歡，但是裏面的玩具設施有些都已經壞了，並且衞生環境和酒店房間比差距很大，屋外的小童蹦床也出現一些斷裂的皮筋並未維護，有安全隱患。
總體滿意的，值得推薦，但作為主打親子酒店，希望在小童設施的維護和衞生上提高水平。

服務基本上可以説有求必應了，但是細節處還有待提高，明明有大的枕套非要用個小的套上了。第一天入住開窗通風進了無數小飛蟲，在床上扎堆爬，個別大的蟲子在牆上爬，工作人員連夜幫忙清理並換了床品。第二天工作人員又來了三次消殺蟲子。
週末晚上7:30會有小童活動，bingo遊戲兩個寶貝還中了獎甚是開心。
温泉水很乾凈，水温也適合小孩，小童池還有救生衣提供。洗髮水、沐浴露、拖鞋、浴巾毛巾都有提供。下午茶每人一份，三種水果和三塊小點心。
早餐人真的真的很多，建議錯峯去。

詳細説説：1.入住，通知三點後入住，三點十分到店，一條大隊排起來，站了一小時隊，堅持不肯等電話，終於給升房型安排了。令人啞然失笑的是，前台説“昨天200多家，今天又是200多家，實在是接待不過來”，你接待不了別賣啊，200間房很多嗎？以犧牲服務為代價，是準備關門了嗎？2.大堂服務，兩天時間，路過大堂十幾次，衹有一次有檸檬水，其他時間，自己找前台要才有水喝，五星級酒店所僅見。3.早餐，上午9點去吃早餐，隊伍從餐廳排到大堂，真的是歎為觀止！門口站一個服務員，一問三不知，大人孩子們排了二十分鐘，孩子餓得哇哇叫，沖餐廳經理髮了一通脾氣，終於安排上了。4.餐食，兩天晚餐自助，衹有兩個菜不同，其他都一樣，種類也不多，傳説中的壽司是沒有的。6點40去，沒有肉餡餃子了，找那位餐廳經理，瞪我一眼，對我説“又來了？行，我給您單煮一些。上午被你吼了我還是給你安排”，我又笑了，補餐不是應該的嗎！我欠你的？5.小童設施：蹦床壞了，非常不安全，無人值守。
客房服務不錯，小童用品齊全，找他們要也熱情及時。

msg:帶孩子去玩玩水，感覺挺一般。先説好的吧，有專門孩子的皇冠家族活動，室內在七層大部分需要提前預約。孩子玩的開心，爸爸媽媽安心。
但，作為洲際酒店沒有顯示出應有水平。你可以説是因為週末人多，疫情等因素影響，但價格也上漲了，是不是可以作為藉口？從服務體驗感覺與國際一流還有不小差距。

環境：園區大體看着還行，但細節無法直視。例如公共區域無人管理，用完的水瓶，咖啡杯，衞生紙沒人清理。
衞生：皇冠大堂旁邊有兩個遊樂區，沒有工作人員值守，孩子大人一堆，垃圾無人清理。二層健身房放了幾瓶水，但毛巾都是用過的，沒有人清理，一個白天都沒有新的，自己去屋子裡拿的新毛巾。房間裏沒有刮鬍刀套裝，自帶吧。

服務：晚餐分為自助和單點。自助是在咖啡廳吃的，從五點半開始，排隊入場大概20分鐘，人很多上菜速度。服務態度也是無敵了，到時間先梳理一下名單，過一會再讓進。如果是因為人多，建議安排分時就餐，或者分餐廳就餐。單點是在旁邊的豐彩小館吃的，環境服務相對好點，建議還是別買晚餐，去單點吧，價格差不多。
説説重點温泉吧，主要目的。一是小童區域水温偏低.二是温泉池子，部分設施壞了，例如水療按摩區躺的石板床六個有兩個壞了。小的泡泉有三個是涼水。環境設備方面，洗浴不能搓澡好像維修，浴巾和浴袍，礦泉水充足。

msg:1.高德導航終點是園區的後門，門口掃碼登記的小哥一臉不情願。而且車輛進入到度假村內需要穿行內部道路，這條道路是餐廳和草坪區的必經之路，中間有很多行人，強烈建議酒店方導航地址變更一下。
2.週五下午到的，辦理入住的人不算多，很快就辦理了入住。房間30多個平米，能接受。每個房間有4瓶礦泉水，但是迷你冰箱裏沒有任何飲料。感覺衞生差了一些，有很多地方都有塵土，一看長時間沒有打掃過。從房間打前台電話諮詢事情永遠佔線，不得不兩次坐電梯跑到前台當面溝通。
3.週日早餐人很多，整個早餐品質一般，好在房價裏包含早餐。週五晚上吃的自助餐，買二送一，感覺還挺實惠，但是對比過周邊的萬豪自助餐價格和品質還是有差距勝。勝在餐廳跟草坪區連在一起，晚上在室外區用餐，涼風習習還是很愜意的。
4.温泉在隔壁的一棟樓裏，週六泡了一整天。整個上午人都不多，環境在北京的温泉酒店裡算非常好。因為衹針對酒店的客人，不對外，所以整個環境都是不錯的，小童戲水區孩子玩的也很開心，而且還有服務人員主動為小朋友送上襪子，怕着涼，但我覺得水温很合適，完全不用穿。游泳池稍微小了一點，玩的不太盡興。另外需要吐槽的是湯屋價格，在內部區域諮詢工作人員説600多到1000多不等，結果到前台一問最低2000多起，內部不統一，明顯是週末臨時漲價。温泉池挺多的，泡起來很舒服，總體值得推薦。

        首先房間味道很大，衹能開窗通風，但又趕上有個機構團建聚會到深夜1點左右，吵得孩子一直不能休息，幾次經和酒店人員溝通才將事情解決，且酒店方面沒有提出任何的補償措施，第二天我們要求延時退房還遭到了討價還價……客房服務2顆星
        温泉環境很好，下午茶很別緻，但温泉區域內地面很滑，雖然服務員一直在擦地，提醒顧客穿鞋，但是地面好像是瓷磚的非常滑，當天有個孩子就滑倒了，滿地的血跡，不知道後來怎麼樣了，帶孩子和長者的一定要當心，另浴室內配有小寶寶的澡盆，小童水上樂園在温泉票內包含。温泉4顆星
        酒店內的中餐廳價格夠五星，但味道不要報有太高的幻想，一小碗的清湯麪28元，如果還有下次我想我會訂含餐的套餐（估計也沒有了）另外用餐當晚服務員拿來的水杯裏還有一塊未溶解的濕漉漉去污粉，至少説明疫情期間，餐具沒有經過高温消毒，不知道是不是酒店接待能力有限，衞生條件堪憂。餐廳2顆星
           最後返京時接到酒店的回訪電話，提出有條件的經濟補償，（但還是決定把這次出遊的心得體會記錄下來給更多的大小朋友們做個參考），可那時我們都已返京，領導層面反映遲緩，對酒店的誠意表示懷疑。酒店管理2顆星

服務：住過別的皇冠，這裏的服務，簡直就是沒服務，態度好是基操了不能説是加分項了吧，個別區域的服務人員也態度略顯不耐煩，比如在温泉前台的時候反覆問了幾個問題，再加上是晚上？反正就也沒有行業標準的微笑了。別的服務就完全沒有，雖然我也不知道該有啥但是對比別的皇冠（尤其是三亞的）簡直心理落差太大了。
早餐：品種稀少，地方小，時間有問題，去的時候告訴我是十點結束（春節期間），問了三個服務人員+電話前台服務，都説是十點。本來就有點不滿意了因為很多酒店都會在週末和節假日延長早餐時間的，所以定了鬧鈴起來去吃早點，結果發現其實十點半才陸陸續續結束上餐，我？？而且品種很少，人很多，我們是初一去的，初二的早上人還不算多，初三已經沒法吃了，等個麪條都要等很久，食物消失的也非常快。
晚餐：晚餐餐廳的大堂經理（應該是吧？）態度非常的好，這個是我來這家皇冠唯一感受到的皇冠應該有的服務態度。

msg:近期最滿意的京郊親子酒店，玩兒的內容非常多，室內小童樂園、室外小型樂園、卡丁車、小火車、温泉裏的小童水上樂園等等等等，硬件上房間設施非常新，另外餐廳的自助晚餐比同級別的其他京郊親子酒店好吃一些，可能是剛恢復營業，服務員非常周到，小朋友玩得非常開心～但是要注意，温泉和泳池都在主樓外，最後是穿着正常的衣服再過去換～

下午茶每人一份，3個大福，3塊水果。和温泉在同一棟樓的衹有這個日餐，價格不便宜，其它餐廳都要走一段户外，去另一棟樓。晚飯乾脆開車去萬達吃的。
二孩兒家庭，大寶剛過一米四，按成人算，補了399成人温泉票。住酒店補票也沒優惠政策。
酒店的衞生紙又薄又粗糙，還不如商場公廁的紙好，雖然東西小，但是每個住進來的人都會用，其它都很好，紙為啥不弄好點呢？

可能是口罩原因，酒店的人比暑假少很多，早餐和自助晚餐的餐食種類也比8月份少了一半，可以理解，但是自助晚餐的價格沒變就不太合適了

再説道吃，晚餐的自助餐，雞肉烤肉都臭了，難吃死了，吃完都吐了，就一個豬肋排和麪條還能吃，其他都是什麼垃圾菜，一個人還300塊錢。另一邊的點餐128兩衹大閘蟹，直接搶劫得了，性價比極低毫無體驗。

服務是很好的，自助餐屬於及格。

但是就沖這個温泉，要打200分！巨大！私隱保護也很好，乾淨，有不同水温大大小小池子，室外也有，落地玻璃也有？給小孩玩的淺水池也有，完美！我們帶着孩子在裏面呆了將近6個小時。

小童吸水區因為中間話題區域在維修，所以衹能在周圍游泳有點減分。

沒有參加任何集體項目，據説是要收費，我覺得作為親子酒店活動不是應該免費麼？這個我覺得很奇怪，我還從來沒見過。

二是酒店客房服務電話，前台電話，快捷服務電話輪番沒人接
三是房間裏沒有餐廳和酒店相關的介紹，電話又沒人接。完全兩眼一抹黑
四是酒店床品太舊了，很多地方都磨的起毛或者快破了。
五是退房當天下着大雨，但是工作人員卻把很多沒走還是沒入住的孩子從室內小童中心轟出來，説是要消毒，但是實際上我們卻從酒店餐廳看到裏面工作人員在喝咖啡。雖然我們沒有被趕出來，因為在餐廳點餐了，但是這服務…

不足之處：入住確實比較慢，3點多才打掃好房間，早飯種類稍微少了點。
總之，瑕不掩瑜，還是不錯的親子酒店，此次出行很愉快！

msg:酒店的地理位置屬於鬧中取靜了，周圍什麼都有，1.5公里處有萬達廣場，裏面有海底撈、麥當勞、必勝客、星巴克、各種好吃的好喝的，購物也很方便～住在酒店內不想在酒店吃飯，可以去周圍吃或者外賣，外賣衹能送到酒店門口，好像是東門，會放在門口保安處的桌子上，大家步行到門口自取～常態化疫情防控的情況下，能點外賣就已經算是很方便了！🤭
再來説説酒店內部，新酒店，毋庸置疑硬件都OK，也沒有新裝修的味道，這點值得表揚～樓道內可以見到小米空氣凈化器，看着也不像來着的亞子……裝修、硬件都是符合星級標準的～客房服務很到位，入住兩晚，前台辦理入住的小哥哥看到我們是帶孩子入住的，辦理入住時間也是晚上8點多了，主動幫忙升級了親子房，兩個1.35米床中間夾一個1.5米的沙發床，一家三口或四口住非常合適了！2晚的時間，我們致電兩次前台，需要用下小剪刀和索取一份刮鬍刀，都非常快的反應了，表揚！但是可能衹是個別情況哈，這個房間雖然衞浴是乾濕分離的，但是洗澡後，衞生間那邊地上都是水🤣
再來説下酒店親子活動，一個室內遊樂區，連接着一個室外遊樂區，各種設施，大滑梯、蹦床、鞦韆，完全夠玩兒了！室內遊樂區旁邊是“卡通片區”，大電視隨時播放動畫片，可以選擇的，這個棒極了！天氣好的話，晚上會在酒店西餐廳外的大草坪上舉行篝火晚會，氣氛非常不錯哦～即使天氣不好，也會在室內大堂吧階梯處搞一個小時的活動，小朋友們玩兒的很盡興，還有小禮物贈送～
最後説説早餐吧，實話實説的話，對於五星級的標準還是差一些，差在品種少上了……選擇不太多，味道一般般吧，吃飽的要求可以滿足～週末避免不了人多，每處基本都排隊，但服務也基本能跟上，補貨可以説是非常及時了～特別是牛奶！！！是我住過唯一一家在週末牛奶沒有斷供的酒店！而且是冷、熱都沒有斷！這個對於我這個早餐可以喝三四杯牛奶的人來説簡直是太美好了！
最後需要提示一點，小童玩水區屬於温泉區，需要單獨購買温泉票的～目前是499元/成人，小童不知道，因為孩子不到120cm，所以也沒細問～購買温泉票後從左邊進入，可以穿到泳池區，但不夠買温泉票的話，衹能在泳池區玩耍，不能去温泉區～下午1-5點在二層會有一份下午茶供給温泉區客人，沒啥吃的……😂
總體還是要給這家新酒店一個五分吧～以後還是會再光顧的～

早餐種類也一般，煎餅裏的薄脆不新鮮了，有哈喇味。
沒有室內小童活動中心，室外的蹦床滑梯也很小，大夏天的這麼熱，基本也不會去。
酒店沒有客房送餐服務，不能點餐。酒店晚上想吃個蛋糕也沒有。
地下停車沒人管理，有些車停在拐角處很容易造成刮蹭，酒店沒人在停車場服務。
酒店房間不錯，床是兩張單人拼起來的超級大床，得有快三米寬了，小孩各種打滾無壓力。
下次同等價位我會選樂多港萬豪。

酒店美中不足就是餐食嚴重不足，負責餐飲的經理人很好，耐心解釋並且向我們推薦了周邊可以吃的小店，去了吃的不錯，也算是彌補了🙂

msg:環境：房間基礎設施是ok的，住起來也還算舒服。免費提供小童配套，達到親子酒店標準。

設施：沐雲温泉確實不錯，在我心中可以排到酒店温泉裏的top3，關鍵是人！不！多！

餐飲：真的是差強人意，基本屬於温泉水平，不是星級酒店水平。晚餐自助菜品種類少、味道也一般，不到300塊錢一位，價格也算不低。自助早餐實在拉垮，拿點玉米、包子、煮雞蛋就得了，別有期待。

服務：服務在線，沒什麼毛病。
