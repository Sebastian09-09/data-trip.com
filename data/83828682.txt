The shortcomings are that the hotel is short of staff on weekends and the MOD has to come to the breakfast restaurant to clean up the kitchen waste. It should learn from mature resort hotels to divert other restaurants during peak hours.

The hotel does not have special children's activities on June 1st. The only non-legacy and kitchen activities have 10 and 15 places each, which can't be booked at all.
There is no seat for breakfast and the order is chaotic.
Xiang Beer House is outside the hotel, a 15-minute walk away. It is very inconvenient without a shuttle bus.
The hotel has only one buffet restaurant with a large flow of people.
There is also a lobby restaurant bar with many people and chaos. There are no seats for dinner at 5:30.
There is no obvious separation between the front desk rest area and the charging area on the third floor. I was driven away when I sat down. The experience was very bad.

msg:I hesitated for a long time before writing this review. I was going to stop writing it, but I still need to give an objective review: We booked a room during the May Day holiday and checked out on May 5th. The environment, service and check-in are all very good! The room facilities are a bit old. None of the bedside lamps are on. The electric curtain in the bathroom is also broken and can't be closed at all. I reported these two problems when I just checked in, but there was no feedback until I checked out. Another point: I don’t know if it’s a problem with breakfast or the hotel room delivery. That night, I ordered a children’s meal and it was delivered to the room. The three of us ate a few bites. The child had diarrhea before going to bed and had diarrhea for several days. Finally, he went to the hospital. The two adults were infected with bacteria and had a fever for a day on May 5th and 6th... We didn’t eat outside the hotel, so we need to pay more attention to the food hygiene. I feel that it’s a problem with the room delivery, and it should have nothing to do with breakfast...

Inside the hotel, the mix of industrial style and green plant style is refreshing.

Outside the hotel, Shijingshan, antique temple, condensation tower, aerial plank road, more mixed, more contradictory, and more interesting. Give children a novel experience.

As Shangri-La, the room layout and supplies feel very ordinary. Check in, waited from three o'clock to four o'clock. Although the service is decent, the efficiency is really anxious.

The room design is simple but the facilities are very complete and convenient. The service is good overall. The guest rooms, restaurants, and front desk reception staff are very enthusiastic and professional, and take the initiative to help solve problems.

1. The environment design is still very distinctive, and there are many holiday activities.
2. The staff has a strong sense of service. From the moment you get off the car and open the door to help with the luggage, you can feel that they have a strong sense of service.
3. The room service responds quickly, and the robot service is very popular with children.
4. Direct drinking water is very environmentally friendly
5. Ultraman welcome service, the staff is very attentive, you can see that the clothes are very uncomfortable, but they are trying hard to interact with the children
6. The room is compact, but the dry and wet separation is very reasonable.
The room lighting and automatic curtains are very humane.

The bad places
1. The room hygiene is generally good, but for example, there is dust in the lower layer of the cabinet or in places that are not paid much attention. Although it is not dusty, it can be seen that it has not been thoroughly cleaned before check-in.
2. The buffet restaurant, Xiangjingting, has the least seats next to the meal pick-up location, and the seats in other locations, especially the farther away from the meal pick-up location, are more densely arranged. I don't know what they think.
The environment is good, but only part of it, and the other part of the seat arrangement is quite good.

Overall it's good, but I feel the room and breakfast don't match the name and price of this hotel

There are also small surprises when checking in. The children get a small card from the mailbox outside the room. They can get the password of the password box by answering questions. After opening it, there is a small gift prepared by the hotel.
In addition, the hotel has an outdoor playground, an indoor playground, swimming, and various activities. Although I didn’t experience them one by one, I feel that the hotel has done a very attentive experience. I will come again next time😊

Sanitation: It is absolutely not an exaggeration to describe it as spotless... In fact, before moving in, because I was with a 10-month-old baby, he would crawl all over the floor, I was still worried about the hygiene of the floor and various corners of the room, but after moving in, I found that it was really very clean. There was no dust on the floor, including the light ***** at the head of the bed. The bathroom was as bright as a new one. Everywhere I looked was very clean and tidy...
Environment: This is a hotel transformed from an abandoned factory of the old Shougang. From the lobby on the first floor to the third floor, there are large and straight steel The frame structure and the various lighting equipment will give people a very strong sense of design impact. The green plants dotted in it leave a deep impression. The soft light design in the room is very suitable for babies...
Service: Mila should be mentioned in particular. From the hotel reservation consultation, Shangri-La Hotel has shown a high-quality service attitude for users. She is very enthusiastic and tries to meet the needs of traveling with babies like us within a reasonable range. The 3 days in the hotel during the Qingming Festival were very wonderful... My son played in an amusement park with other children for the first time, used baby language to socialize for the first time, swam in a dedicated swimming pool for the first time, and spent time with his parents for the first time that belonged only to us... These beautiful memories are inseparable from Mila's care for our small family. Thank you again🙏

I am a chocolate person, but this one is really just a creative dessert, so sweet.

msg:As someone who takes her children to stay in hotels in and around Beijing three or four times a year, I have already minimized my expectations for all the publicity about so-called parent-child hotels. This Shangri-La really shocked me! ! How could it be so bad! Really bad! ! It’s so bad that for people like me who can just muddle along and don’t want to write reviews, I must write it down to avoid pitfalls for everyone! ! During the Chinese New Year, there are really all kinds of obstacles. The most unforgettable thing was that after I checked in, I took my children to have dinner at around 5pm. When I returned to the room at 7pm, the installed bed bumper had disappeared! ! The things in the house were in a mess. I don’t know if they had been disturbed. The most obvious thing was that the bedside was missing! The hotel just swiped my card into my room without my permission and took away my things! ! I called the front desk, and I didn't know anything about it. They just said that they would send me another bed surround as soon as possible. After half an hour, there was no news. I called the front desk again, but I still had no answer. I asked the call to be transferred to the manager. After waiting for two minutes, a person who claimed to be the manager on duty finally answered the phone and waited for a while. Wai sent it to me without any explanation. He just said that in order to express his apology, the things in the minibar could be given to me. I was really speechless. How funny is it? How many cans of Coke is enough to apologize? You can just go into my room and take whatever I need? ? Shangri-La's apology is really too expensive to afford. Let me talk about a few shortcomings: 1. The breakfast was too bad. I had to queue up when I went there at ten o'clock. It was not the end of the meal. All kinds of juices were bottomed out and were not replenished. They were either freshly squeezed juices or finished canned juices. As for being so picky. ? 2. There are too many children in Nha Bao Paradise. You can spend money to get in without staying in a hotel. If you stay in a hotel, unless you buy a package that includes tickets, you will have to spend money separately. 3. There are too few restaurants in the hotel. They are either buffet or lobby dining bar. There are not many types. There is no formal restaurant where you can order meals separately. Shangri-La gives people the impression that everything on Kuoko Soso costs money. The key is that the money has been given, but the service and quality have not kept up at all.

After a while, he called us to check on the child's condition. , I was in a hurry at the time and forgot to ask the employee his last name and once again expressed his gratitude to the employee.

Even though they are very busy, they can still send holiday greetings to every guest who passes by! In addition, several employees at the gym are also very enthusiastic.
The only drawback is that the water in the children's swimming pool was too cold that day and the children came out without playing enough. In addition, the bean soup for breakfast was not hot enough. I hope it can be improved. In short, the hotel still maintains a very high standard!

I was very angry and had reason to suspect that the bedding had not been changed before we checked in. Although I called the front desk later, I changed the room, but I still have to give it a bad review if I find that the room hygiene is not up to standard. It is indeed what a hotel should do, so I will not change my mind because of this remedy. I will not comment on other star-rated hotels for the time being. I couldn't meet the minimum hygiene standards, let alone anything else. I checked in at 4pm and was given a very inconvenient room at the end of the corridor, far away from the elevator. Even though the hygiene was unsatisfactory, it was still unsatisfactory.

The buffet at Xiangjing Pavilion is expensive but value for money. You can taste Buddha Jumping Over the Wall, giant lobster, drunken pickled hairy crabs, various Chinese, Western and Japanese delicacies, as well as desserts that melt in your mouth.

msg:This is the worst Shangri-La I have ever stayed in.

As a senior member of major domestic and foreign hotel groups, this stay experience is really hard to describe.

Picture 1: The tabletop of Xiangjingting Restaurant, the buffet restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, was wiped with a wet wipe and it was all oily yellow. It was like this every day.
Picture 2: The baby found a cockroach and excitedly shared it with me. Watching cockroaches crawl under the sofa was so disgusting that I didn’t record the video.
Figure 3: Welcome to browse the records of the camera for evidence collection.
I have reported the above to the local health bureau, but I think it will have no effect.

Room: Because it was a last-minute trip, I just booked a twin bed. The room was very small, on a low floor, and the view was a chimney. But it is indeed designed very reasonably. It's just not suitable for young babies to live in. It's all made of steel and corners, so bumps are inevitable. The baby bumped his head once and his arm twice. You can't install the bumper *****s yourself, so it's dangerous. The fence is L-shaped. If you want to use it, you have to have a twin bed and a big bed, so there is no point in booking a twin bed.
Secondly, the water temperature in the bathroom is unstable and drops during peak water use periods, making bathing very uncomfortable. The door is not soundproof, and the shouting in the corridor can be heard very clearly. The windows are not soundproofed and there are occasional events downstairs which are very noisy.

Facilities: This is the most profit-oriented Shangri-La I have ever stayed at. The gym is open to the outside, the children's playground is open to the outside, and the outdoor children's amusement facilities are public... Although the guest room area can only be entered by swiping a card, there is basically nothing except the small room and the spacious guest room meeting area (you have to listen to other people's meetings when entering the room area...) What are the exclusive facilities for hotel guests. After the epidemic, consumption has been downgraded, and it is understandable that hotels need to make profits to survive. But how to downgrade decently may require some knowledge. The traditional hotel industry is undergoing transformation, but if the soul is lost, it will not look good.

Others: There is basically no service training. Everyone was chattering together, everyone was rushing to collect money, but no one was rushing to serve. There is no sense of boundaries and no formal five-star hotel training. At best, it is at the guest house level. The excellent quality of a very few employees cannot replace the average level. Refreshed our understanding of Shangri-La Hotel Group's services.

Meals: The coffee in the lobby bar is good, and the desserts are endless. There is a big gap between the buffet restaurant standards and prices, but the ingredients themselves are still passable and the oil used is also very good. Especially the chef in the Panini area is very clean and responsible, and the taste is very good.

The hotel has a design, but it’s so beautiful and beautiful. I’m sorry, I’ve seen better ones and even more beautiful ones. But I have never stayed in a worse Shangri-La than this one.

There is a long road ahead, but I hope to move forward with dignity. Small comments cannot change a huge enterprise. The mountains are high and the road is long, no need to say goodbye.

msg:Shangri-La Hotel is always trustworthy, and it did not disappoint me.
In Shangri-La in Shougang Park, the rough reinforced concrete structure meets the vigorous green plants and flowers, which has a different sense of body, natural, pure and powerful, creating a very good sense of design.
I reserved a twin room. I wanted the room to be quieter when I checked in. The front desk staff was enthusiastic and professional. They specially arranged a room on the highest floor facing the Yongding River. Through the large glass windows, you can see the quiet Yongding River. That afternoon and The family sits drinking tea in the sunny room, which is beautiful and quiet.
The room is a good size, well designed and has everything you need.
There are also a few highlights worth mentioning: while there is a bathtub for dry and wet separation, there is also a sink in the independent bathroom, which is very convenient; there is a push-pull charging box in the bedside table, which is very cleverly designed; the room is equipped with a water purifier , you can drink directly; the open storage rack is very practical; I also found a yoga mat, although it is useless, but I still feel the sincerity of the hotel.
Of course the linen and bedding are as comfortable as ever.
The most grateful thing is that the hotel customer service staff found out that it was my birthday through the identity information, so they called to express their congratulations, and also sent a delicious fruit cake, which must be praised again and again 👍👍👍.
In addition, the hotel's buffet lunch is also very rich and memorable.
In short, a hotel with ingenious design and attention to details, coupled with high-quality services, can always create surprises.
A very satisfying birthday trip 🌈.

What can be improved is that the style of the hair dryer in the room does not match this hotel, but the entire Dyson is perfect. Also, the door to the guest room from the front desk on the third floor is very dangerous. No one can be seen inside or outside, and there are many people coming and going on this road. It is easy to push the door from inside and hit people outside. This safety hazard can be improved. .

msg:I went there after reading other people's good reviews about Wall Crack and was a little disappointed.
The environment is very good and has a great sense of design. There are many plants in the lobby, and I had a lot of fun taking photos; the service is good, and there is an interactive clown performance in the lobby, which the children like very much; the bathroom may be separated from the space, and the room feels surprisingly small🙀; the food is not cost-effective, and there is a lunch buffet during the National Day 500+ per person, the breakfast taste and dining experience are average; the hotel has a park, which is large compared to other hotel parks, and very clean, and the staff pays close attention to the service. The child can play for half a day, but it costs 2 to 300 yuan. One large and one small, the price is right~ ps: Check out before ten o'clock and you will get a two-hour park ticket for free. The operation is quite nice~ However, it affects the impression of Shangri-La and I don't want to stay there in the future.

msg:First of all, there is nothing to say about the environment and service. However, I booked a room with a 2-meter king bed. I arrived late on the day of check-in, around 9 o'clock in the evening. As a result, when I entered the room, I saw a 1.8-meter bed. I originally wanted to I just made do with it, but because the room was next to the elevator, I didn't sleep all night. It was very noisy. I spent the whole night listening to the loud bang-dong-dong sound. I decided to change rooms the next morning. I originally wanted to change rooms. The room was much better, but it turned out to be noisier. Before one o'clock at night, I kept hearing the door closing in other rooms. It wasn't the guest's problem, it was the door that was just like that. It kept banging for half the night, and there were so many guests. I like to talk with the door open. I haven’t slept much in the first place. I can’t understand why I open the door early in the morning to entertain my children.

As for the facilities, the plug in the bathroom cannot be used with the hair dryer I brought. I have to open the door after taking a shower, and then go to the bathroom next door to dry my hair. It is very inconvenient.

Let’s talk about the children’s paradise, it’s not cheap and clean, but! ! ! It’s too small, suitable for children between one and two years old. My child is five years old and the whole ride was completed in less than five minutes. It only costs 80 yuan for an additional parent to accompany you. It’s really not worth it.

It is recommended that if you want to check in, go directly, take photos, or eat, there is no need to live in it. The experience is not very good, mainly because it is too noisy and easy to insomnia.

2. The breakfast is good, the variety is okay, the dining environment is very good, and it feels comfortable to eat in the green space on the first floor.
3. I contacted the hotel in advance to prepare bed rails and cribs. I like this.
Let’s talk about the shortcomings:
1. The welcome fruits are stingy (one orange, one apple, one pear each), which is not suitable for a five-star hotel. It's better not to give it.
2. It is not a smart toilet. It feels cold when I go to the toilet in this season.
3. The pillow is very uncomfortable and too high.

During the holidays, many hotels will have crowded breakfast queues, but this hotel encourages check-out two hours in advance, and you can get two hours of free play at Nha Bao Paradise, which effectively offsets the peak hours. This is the level of management and attentiveness. When supplies need to be replenished in the room, the service is provided by a robot, which is particularly cute. Overall very satisfied

Ya Bao Paradise is suitable for slightly older babies and has a large trampoline. By the way, you must bring your original ID card when checking in. Photos are not allowed. You must also go to the nearby police station to provide proof of identity, which is very troublesome. The rest are satisfied!

The hotel lobby is on the third floor, with a breakfast and lounge on the first floor. At first, there were only theme rooms with a small courtyard on the first floor. There was some air leakage from the door leading to the yard, so we moved to a room upstairs. The manager on duty that day made timely adjus**ents and solved the problem, making us feel warm and convenient when traveling with our children.
The hotel breakfast is good and the environment is also very good. Since the lunch and dinner buffet is during the Spring Festival, the price is double the usual price, but it is recommended to try it.
The dining in the park is easy to miss, but you can also go to eat nearby.
The Nya Bao Paradise on the first floor is very popular with children. It is a good place for children to check in every day.
The swimming pool and sauna are suitable for adults to experience.

The child likes the little fish at the door very much, and the friendly doorman waiter gave the fish food. The fruit and snacks in the room are very special.
There are also some problems, such as the afternoon tea waiting for half an hour from when we were seated to eating when there was an appoin**ent. Afternoon tea on the big diving platform has its own characteristics, but the quality needs to be improved. The dessert is not as good as the breakfast, and the salty one is not recommended.
Then, when eating breakfast, because the child’s snacks are slow and he wants to eat while playing, so we asked if we could bring the leftover bread from the child to the room after the food was collected, but was rejected by the waiter. If you want to eat, you can eat in the restaurant, and you can eat until 11 o'clock. In this way, it feels that it is not so friendly to a parent-child hotel. Later, I discussed with the lady at the front desk, and the lady packed it without saying a word.

The hotel is located in Shougang Park, with a pleasant environment and shaded by trees, making people feel like they are in an urban oasis. The decoration of the hotel is not only high-end, but also elegant and grand. Once you enter the door, you will be surrounded by flowers in full bloom, just like entering a fairyland on earth.

The staff at the front desk are super friendly, warm and professional, making you feel right at home. Moreover, I left the store in the early morning of the next day to catch a flight. The restaurant was very thoughtful and prepared a rich breakfast box for me. This kind of heart-warming detail is very touching.

In general, Shangri-La Beijing Shougang Park store not only has a beautiful environment, but also has perfect service. I would highly recommend this hotel whether it's for business or pleasure. Looking forward to staying again next time!

The environment is very beautiful, you can take pictures everywhere, it's very good ~ there are many places to shop around the hotel ~
The facilities are complete, the room is very quiet, the layout is very reasonable, gym, bar, swimming pool are all available. Although the swimming pool is not big, it is very clean, and there is a special person in charge of safety. It is open until 11 o'clock in the evening. Although the children are very tired from playing every day, they will swim for an hour at the hotel and have a good time~
The breakfast is very rich. For two children, only one person who is over 1.4 meters tall is charged for breakfast. The best thing is that you can take some away after eating. Few hotels can do this~
The service is not to mention, the concierge, the front desk, and the catering are all very warm and thoughtful ~ super five-star service level ~ the children say they can rate seven stars 😄
There are a lot of people in Beijing during the summer vacation. I am glad that I chose this hotel that is a little far from the city. The driver who takes a taxi every day praises us for choosing the right one. This Shangri-La has added a lot of joy to our trip. I hope we can keep it and wait for another day goodbye

To be honest, the ingredients are really conscientious, it is really solid chocolate, and the taste is not bad, and the tea shop is also very attentive, the only downside is that the fruit tastes almost.

After arriving at the place, it is indeed as imagined. The halls, corridors, restaurants, lounges, and public areas continue the steel-hard factory style and Shangri-La’s unique style. The fragrance is very recommended to eat and play here (flowers, grass, small bridges and flowing water)

The rooms and guest room corridors have a severe sense of separation. The external corridors are generous and luxurious. The interior of the room is a bit like a fast hotel... It doesn't look like the Shangri-La in my impression

Unable to accept the taste of direct drinking water, I called the food and beverage depar**ent and asked for four bottles of water, but was limited to one bottle per person. After communication, more water was delivered twice.

The breakfast is ok, but the service staff may not be well trained, the whole process is cold and there are unprofessional inquiries

The boast is that parking is free! ! ! This is very important for a stingy person hahahahaha awesome! !

But there are so many children

This is the first time I have stayed in a hotel for so many years! And the per capita is 218 yuan, which is outrageous and makes people speechless! And you can only play for two hours, and when the time comes to drive the children out on time, you are also drunk! The playground does not provide drinking water. The children are thirsty and need to buy water by themselves. It is a very small bottle of 8 yuan... I think this is the first and last time I stay, and I will not choose this store again !

Now that the Kung Fu tea cups and tea sets are ready, you can add some Chinese Fujian white tea, rock tea, and Puer tea to the tea supplies. What's more, the other drinks have always maintained the high quality of Shangri-La Hotel. The smart little robot delivers food and slippers and towels is a bit of a science-level feature. It's a little surprise. I mentioned the anniversary arrangement before check-in, and it's still very warm after check-in. In the afternoon, the front desk also informed that they would send a cream cake. It felt very heart-warming. The service did not need anything false. If it exceeded the original service content, the guests would remember it and would continue to stay at the Shangri-La Hotel next time. The hotel’s gym and swimming pool were quite satisfactory. , the water quality is clean, there is no other odor such as disinfection, the waiter answers all questions during the process, like it!

Don't blow or black mainly talk about the evaluation of the hotel.
The environment and facilities are nothing to say about. The small green card (room card) is good. The drinking water in this house is for direct drinking. It’s pretty good, not a lot of "ice dew". The overall feeling is that the staff service is very good. , A concierge will come up when you get off the car, and the little brother who has fried eggs for breakfast is also very nice, smiling politely. The ladies who went through the formalities were very nice, especially the two ladies Huangfu and the manager were very polite and thoughtful. Give children small toys. It is very child-friendly, and I highly recommend staying here when bringing children to play.

The access control from the guest room to the lobby is deliberately opened, which poses a security risk. If it is opened deliberately by the guest, then additional supervision is required.

Regardless of the environment or service, including catering, it can meet the needs of adults and children. In particular, the hotel has a great sense of design. The renovation of the Shougang factory has retained the traces of the factory, but the design and decoration are not obtrusive and perfectly integrated.
The buffet has bolong, roast duck and crayfish. Special thanks to the roast duck masters Chen Fuqiang and Liu Guai, the roast duck is delicious and the service attitude is good. The front desk service is also very kind, and the smile of little sister Xie Xin is very sweet and healing when checking out. All in all a very nice experience.

msg:Hygiene: Among all Shangri-La Group hotels in Beijing, I have stayed at China World Hotel, New World Trade Hotel, and China World Hotel. Shangri-La, Shougang Park is the cleanest among the four I have stayed at. 1) The room is dusty and the cleaning is not thorough: the cleanliness is like a hotel or lower. It is not ruled out that the windows of the first three hotels are closed. The reason why this hotel can open the windows is that it is gray, but there are bright footprints under the carpet in the bathroom, which is a management problem. 2) The career management of some staff is poor: in the changing rooms of the gym and swimming pool, the staff stand on the chairs used for changing clothes to take the bath towels in the upper cabinet, and then directly lay grass (roll bath towels) on the places he just stepped on ), should be anxious to deal with the inspection of the management personnel from Singapore. The staff of five-star hotels are so open to customers, I have never encountered other five-star hotels in New York, Paris, Vancouver, Rome, Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, Geneva,..., Bali, Hawaii, Hong Kong, Beijing As I said before, the root cause of this incident is not a personal problem of the staff, but a management problem.
Facilities: 1) Lack of renovation: The hotel has only been in use for less than two years, and the wood of the toilet door in the room has lost sawdust. 2) There is no explanation on how to use the facility, and even the customer service depar**ent doesn’t know how to deal with it: the magnifying glass on the makeup mirror in the bathroom cannot be turned off after all the power is turned off, and the customer service depar**ent has to ask the engineering depar**ent to overhaul it after 11 o’clock in the middle of the night. The switch is just under the mirror (horrible), and the staff on duty in the customer service depar**ent of a five-star hotel don't understand the facilities of their hotel, and the hotel doesn't have any instructions, which is unprofessional. 3) The plug-in board in the drawer at the head of the bed is completely unusable. 4) The shading panel in the glass at the connection between the bathroom and the bedroom is broken. 5) The sound is not particularly loud after the quilt is touched, which affects the degree of sleep.
Environment: 1) The design is good and the plants are well maintained. 2) The location is good, in the Shougang Park, you can see Xishan and Dahe on the west side. This is the best brand value of this hotel.
Service: 1) The service is very good, but I feel that the cleaning service and other services are not part of the same hotel. I think it includes reception, catering, marketing staff and cleaning and room service staff. Yes, the former comes from Singapore, and the latter comes from Chinese state-owned enterprises in the 20th century. Because after 10 o'clock in the evening, I asked the room service depar**ent to send a toothbrush and body lotion, but they couldn't deliver it in 20 minutes, so I called again, and a person from the room service depar**ent came and said they forgot...
suggestion:
1) Don’t lower brand value and brand reputation for your parent brand
2) Don’t waste everything, that is, waste the characteristics of Shougang Park, the surrounding natural environment, and the well-designed hardware and concepts
3) It is best for the hotel to strictly implement the concept of "establish a business first, and then everyone will make a fortune", otherwise many things should not be borne by our customers and your parent company
4) For hotel services, please don't tell customers "we will help you..." when customers raise basic needs. What a strange way of thinking, isn't it helping your own business and brand image?
5) Hotel personnel please don't give me this reply, thank you.
Thank you for the smiles of many staff during the check-in experience. If the company only pays you a small salary but requires the same performance as Singapore, then I fully understand all the above.
~The swing is very fun~^_^

It was rebuilt on the basis of the former factory building of Shougang, taking into account tradition and comfort, and it has a unique feeling. The room facilities are well equipped. The bathing room and the toilet room are separated without interfering with each other. There are many power outlets, which is very convenient. It is very convenient to make tea with a direct drinking water pipe into the house, and the tea making equipment is also good. The breakfast category is relatively complete, and the German restaurant outside the store has a great environment. The service process is slightly inexperienced, but the staff are very enthusiastic to make up for the small shortcomings. In terms of environment, the hotel is located in the center of the Shougang Winter Olympic Park, next to the famous ski jumping platform "High Heels", and only three to four hundred meters away from the shopping center Liugonghui. The Shougang Park has undergone modernization, taking into account the orderly combination of ancient buildings, heavy industrial relics and modern lifestyles. The design sense is strong and harmonious with each other. There are tourist facilities and various restaurants. Ken McPhi is there and there are many coffee shops In Beijing's sunny winter day, although the air is a bit cooler, it is comfortable, convenient and leisurely. In addition, there are relatively few tourists, so the environment feels great. There is Huanhuan in the east, Shougang Winter Olympic Park in the west, the central axis of the Forbidden City, Jingshan, Beihai Temple of Heaven, Dashilan, etc., the South China Sea Royal Elk Park in the south, and the huge Olympic Forest Park in the north.

In Shougang Park, the traffic is very inconvenient if you don’t have a car. You only bring your children to play in the park. The hotel has a swimming pool and a cute baby park. It’s good to bring children here on weekends. The air is so quiet! The service is quite satisfactory. I ordered the 1988 double bed package, which includes a fixed dinner and breakfast for two people and a roll of 200 yuan. The key point is that the dinner has to be eaten in the champagne shop about one kilometer away from the hotel. It will be eaten after the 5 or 6 level wind in the evening. To walk back, it is estimated that those with children will be a little desperate! The room is warm, the temperature of the bath water is great, and the plants on the first floor are a bit shocking!

msg:Facilities: all are good, clean, and the big bed room is also very good, although it is stitched together, there is no gap
Hygiene: clean and tidy, as soon as you enter the door, you will feel the familiar smell of Shangri-La

Environment: It is very good. Children especially like it because there is a Yabao Paradise and the shallow water area of the swimming pool is 70cm. It is very friendly and the water temperature is also suitable for babies.
Service: very very good! ! Especially Xu Xiaokang, the young man who answered the phone at the service center. Help us solve the problem in time. I wanted to eat something in the middle of the night, but there was no takeaway during the Chinese New Year when the kitchen was off work. I especially wanted to eat popsicles. Later, I was given an iced Coke. Then the toilet was broken, and I found someone to fix it in time. He was very gentle and patient. . The guy who delivered the things was called xu xiao nan (I’m not sure what the word is) and he was also very kind. It’s quite late and it’s Chinese New Year again. Everyone has worked hard. Thank you for your hard work. I wrote a thank you letter when I left. The guy at the front desk of the fitness center is also super nice! Be very patient! The staff at the front desk are also kind when they meet and say hello! You can really come with children. There is also an ice and snow carnival nearby.
Finally, I begged to improve the food. The self-service is almost meaningless. It’s nothing new to eat together. The New Year’s Eve dinner is just like that. It can be expensive, but it’s worth the money😢
Hope to improve the food.
I will come again, but I beg for a place to eat, add some new styles, thank you! Happy New Year everyone ♥️

msg:I really like the combination of industry and modernity in this hotel. I checked in on the first day of the New Year's Eve and felt a strong festive a**osphere, and there are not too many people to catch up with. The children's playground can hardly exceed 10 children, so the children play well It's very cool. When the kids are tired from playing, they can order food at the nearby bar in the lobby. When they are full, they can continue to play. In the evening, they took a stroll around the hotel. The location is good, very close to the big diving platform. The hotel breakfast is also good and rich.

msg:Service: The girl at the front desk feels impatient, and the other male receptionist is very nice. The fitness center took the initiative to inform the passenger flow peak, and the children's playground took the initiative to introduce the facilities. Welcome fruit upon check-in. The breakfast is relatively average, there are not many types and it is not delicious. I feel that the operation needs to be strengthened.

Facilities: A large children's playground, children should be able to fully discharge. The room is relatively new, with simple decoration, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows are not covered. It is a pity that there is really no scenery in this season, and it is not the time to come.

Environment: The hotel lobby and restaurant are designed in a modern style, and the power plant lounge and red staircase are suitable for taking pictures. "Xiang" encounters rainbow joint afternoon tea for two: It includes eight desserts, two teas, and two cups of special drinks.

Hygiene: No hygienic bugs have been found. Disposable dental kits need to be collected at the front desk.

Overall, it is recommended for families with children.

msg:I went on a Saturday, and there were too many people checking in. I felt that the service could not keep up, and I couldn't hear the loud noise. Later, when there were few people, I went to the front desk to hear clearly.
The hotel's Yabao Paradise is very clean, and the children like it very much. They went to play twice. The location of the hotel is very good. As soon as you go out, you will see the big jumping platform of Shougang. The night view is also beautiful. I ate at the Brasserie at night. It tastes good, but the price is a little expensive. The hotel buffet that I ate early felt average, only the snacks were delicious. The swimming pool and gym are good, but for some reason there is no waiter in the women's locker room, there are no slippers, and many people don't know how to use the wristbands. There are only ordinary drinks (Coke Sprite) in the mini bar in the room and no other snacks.
Generally speaking, the hotel is not bad. The children like it very much. It is a hotel worth visiting.

msg:The overall service quality is not worthy of the stars nor the price. Without guidance, the hotel service staff seemed to hide from people in social fear, or they just pretended not to hear them. The hotel restaurant is expensive and the taste can only be said to be passable. Ordering food is better than buffet. The self-service group purchase is only 500 per person, and I only saw three or four kinds of sashimi, sea white shrimp, crayfish and mussels. This dish costs 298 at most. There is no child care service in the spore park, and there are no children's play facilities in the children's swimming pool.

In addition, our family was in a good mood and booked a package. The check-in ceremony and afternoon tea are quite fun. Most of the shapes are made of chocolate. The baby is very happy to eat, but it’s too much for adults... Fortunately, the afternoon tea is a plate of dessert and a plate of salty snacks. The activity of visiting the Shougang Big Jumping Platform is to walk there Just go to the audience stand on the side to take pictures

The only dissatisfaction is that during the check-in time period, a team has packaged the cafeteria, and individual guests are not allowed to eat. This is only known by the check-in on the day. Although this is not a big deal, the hotel can call in advance to inform people that it is expected that this is not in line with the service level of Shangri-La Hotel. Because there are not many choices for eating around, there is a certain distance, so it takes about 50 minutes to order takeout.

msg:Shangri-La Hotel, Shougang Park was designed by the famous Italian design company Lissoni Casal Ribeiro S.p.A. It was fully renovated on the basis of the original Shougang Power Plant. While retaining the distinctive industrial cultural features and historical heritage, it is modernized. Although it is a factory renovation from the lobby to the room, there are many pipelines, but the lighting is very good, and there is no dark feeling at all.
The room is also very bright and bright. Although the bathing is limited to the venue for a small reason, it is also separated from wet and dry, and the space utilization is reasonable. The curtains are two layers and the control panel is at the head of the bed. There is a drinking fountain at the bar in the room. If you need bottled water, you can also ask for it at the service desk. Fruits, capsule coffee and tea are readily available, and the drinks in the small refrigerator are free for the first time. By the way, their buckwheat pillows are real. Buckwheat pillows are not the kind of buckwheat with a soft core and a thin layer on top.
The breakfast is good. When I checked in, I encountered the Feitian Award here. On weekdays, a buffet lunch was also added.
The concierge depar**ent will bring a group to visit the auditorium of the big jumping platform at 4 o'clock every day. If Shijingshan is open (it is also affiliated to Shougang), there will be a group. There are two stamps of Shougang Park at the concierge desk. The service guy has a warm attitude, and you can ask him all kinds of information about Shougang, 👍.
There is no SPA in this hotel, Shougang Park is too big, and there is no place to relax when you are tired from shopping.

The hotel's self-service is also very good, you can also order takeaways, and the swimming pool is also new.

What needs to be improved is the taste of breakfast. There are many varieties, but the taste is average. I hope to continue to work hard.

Service: The little brother and the little sister are all friendly and active... The conversation is comfortable, the little sister and the little brother are gentle and gentle (it's enough for me... Timely when you need service... Don't disturb the guests too much when you don't need it) …)

👍 Overall really good👍
👍 Come and stay for a night or two in the future, let yourself relax... Away from the stressful mood of work 😘 There are many places to sneak around, let's take a breath and take a look...

Small suggestion: The environment is very good... It would be better if it can match the environment with a little more online dining & drinking... There is one afternoon tea on weekdays, and one on weekends (because I only live on weekdays... So I only tasted the big jumping platform)... The drink is only a single orange juice or a bottled drink... The taste is not mentioned, it is quite ordinary... But we have to look online~~ After all, it is a hotel afternoon tea and I don't think about the taste of a dessert shop... But You can't waste this environment, the taste is good... The point is the appearance! 🥰

msg:Transportation: Navigation used to be very convenient. When parking underground in the hotel, everyone in the car had to scan the QR code (children need to check on their behalf, and they need to be rechecked every time they enter or leave the hotel. Although it is a little troublesome, it is very understandable and it would be better to be more strict).
Take the elevator to the third-floor lobby in the basement to check in. We went on a weekday, and we could check in at 2pm. We also offered late checkout, which was especially good (checkout at 3pm on weekends, 12pm).

Hygiene: Very good! Just opened in December last year, Shangri-La brand management, hygiene is in place! It's just that the scent in the lobby may be a bit overpowering (this is the third Shangri-La we've stayed at, and it's the same style, but we're used to it, haha). The drinking water in the room is filtered drinking water, which is very convenient. You don’t have to worry about running out of bottled water~
There are separate wet and dry bathrooms, and the drinks in the refrigerator are free, and renewals are paid, which is considerate.


Environment: Shangri-La, there is not much to say, everything is OK. Shougang Park is characterized by "industrial style" and the lobby is surrounded by green plants, which is quite special. You need to walk some distance to get back to your room, change the elevator twice, walk through the corridor of a building, and you will be familiar with the environment after walking twice. Then during the epidemic, only the door is open, and you can only take a detour when going out or going to the outdoor children's playground...
The swimming pool is small, has a children's pool, is guarded by two lifeguards, the water quality is clean, no reservation is required on weekdays, and it is full of experience! No reservation is required for the gym on weekdays, so it’s very quiet!
Breakfast is served until ten o'clock. The food is not very diverse, but it includes both Chinese and Western classics. The croissants are very crispy, especially the peanut butter croissants, which are rare in other hotels. They are really delicious! There are also freshly cooked wontons and noodles, and freshly made pancakes! There are three kinds of meat in the grilled sausage to meet different needs, but there are fewer types of fruits, only watermelon, cantaloupe and pineapple. Finally, I have a small suggestion. Can you add bubbly rice to the cereal section? Children love bubbly rice soaked in milk in every hotel they go to. We don’t have it here...
Finally, there is Nya Bao Paradise. There are many caregivers and ladies, and it feels very safe. The park is not big, but it is very clean, and there are many babies. There are bathrooms and a small dining bar inside. Even for older babies, they may not be very interested. The package includes the park tickets, which is a good deal. It feels like it is not worth buying it alone. .


Service: Very good! The service of the little brother and sister at the front desk was very good and very enthusiastic. They knew that we were celebrating our anniversary and even gave us a small cake, which was very considerate! Knowing that the children had to take a nap, I was given a two-hour late check-out on weekdays. Thank you so much!
We called a day in advance and asked how many children we were bringing, how old they were, boys and girls, and prepared children's hygiene products, slippers and bathrobes in advance, and made reservations for the swimming pool and children's playground (generally not required on weekdays, but during the summer) I made an appoin**ent just to be on the safe side).

The package we purchased includes a 200 yuan dining voucher (the Xiangbeifang we went to has the same financial backend as the group. You only need to register the room account, and it will be deducted directly from the deposit when you check out, which is very convenient), and Nha Bao Paradise. Tickets to play (the older baby can’t play for too long, but it’s enough to pass the time), visit the Shougang Ski Jump (on the day of check-in, at 4-5 pm, the concierge will gather, and the little brother will take him to visit the big jump and the auditorium, and also not bad).

The night before, we visited Shougang Park. The park is very big. There are shared bicycles, and there are many things to do at Qunming Lake (be sure to prevent mosquitoes). There is also Liugonghui Shopping Mall in the park to go shopping (there is not much shopping, but dining is available. ), we also ran eight kilometers at night (every intersection is connected, so if you are afraid of getting lost, just navigate), the next morning we went to the Winter Olympics Park next door (also called Locomotive Park), and took pictures of the new Shougang Bridge The distant view, I checked in the Internet celebrity spiral staircase, in short, it is a place worth visiting, very fun, and very family-friendly, highly recommended!

Secondly, the toilet in the bathroom is dangling and there is no toilet paper. I call to ask for it. If you order takeaway, you have to go to the first floor to pick it up. You can check in at the Baby Paradise downstairs. 268 plays for two hours at your own expense, if you don't stay in 318, it seems to be. There is really nothing to play with those things inside! The buffet is 598 per person on weekends, and the half price is limited to children over 6 years old. The official website and various platforms are all 398. It seems that the waiter will tell you that the price is only on weekends! ! Never again, never use one size fits all Messages are meaningless No need! How many stars do you have for this service and occupancy conditions? Just over a thousand nights?

Hygiene: good, there are hand sanitizers everywhere, masks and alcohol wipes are available in the restaurant at the front desk, very good

Environment: The hotel is decorated in an industrial style, the green plant decoration is just right, and the photos are very good

Service: The restaurant's service is the best, enthusiastic and patient, with a five-star appearance; the front desk of the guest room is average

When booking, Ctrip helped me to note the birthday, and the hotel sent the cake, which tasted good and the size was right! There are also welcome fruits and desserts! The executive suite is really recommended. The living room is very large, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and it is very convenient to have two toilets. The spare parts are the same as L'Occitane, the hair dryer is from Dyson, the room is also smart throughout the house, and the environment is really good! At present, there is no executive lounge. One person has a dinner credit of 200 yuan that can be used in the hotel restaurant. We chose Xiangjingting. The dishes are delicious and cost-effective! The breakfast is a bit inferior, in the form of a buffet, the taste is very good, and the variety is relatively rich, but the meal is very slow, and the simplest and least fried eggs have to wait. On the whole, I still like this hotel very much. It is also a hotel that I wanted to check in. I hope to have an executive lounge soon!

The room has electric curtains, the bed is comfortable, and the drinks prepared in the refrigerator are free for the first time. For dinner, I went to the Fragrance Brewery under the hotel.

Two dissatisfactions:
Unexplained delay in hotel check-in, waited from one o'clock to three o'clock, kept saying that the room was not cleaned, and was urged to check in countless times. In the middle, we always suggested that we add money for a yard on the first floor, and the intention was a bit suspicious.
In addition, the hotel swimming pool is too small and the environment is poor. It still needs to make an appoin**ent, and because there is no swimming cap, it costs 180 for a temporary purchase.

From the warm service at the front desk of the hotel during check-in to the afternoon tea environment full of style, the room size is just right, taking into account the sense of warmth and technology, it can be seen that a lot of thought was spent on customer experience and space utilization during the decoration design.
We booked two rooms, and the elderly and children were full of praise. If it weren't for the lack of subway access, it was really inconvenient to take a taxi to the scenic spots. I would definitely stay in this hotel for a week!

I called the hotel one week before booking the hotel and said that I need a crib and bedside. The day before check-in A special person called back and said that they saw that the crib and bed circumference and other needs were remarked at any time, thinking that everything must be coordinated. Unexpectedly, there was no baby cot in the room on the day of check-in. I called the service center and said back that there were too many demands from the guests and I couldn’t coordinate it. The baby cot would be delivered to me first in the afternoon of the second day, and the baby would be delivered until the second night of check-in. I didn't see any shadow of the bed, I guess I forgot it long ago...
In addition, in order to use 200 meal coupons to have a meal in the lobby bar and the beer shop, there is a baby menu in the lobby bar, but the meals made feel like small portions for adults. I didn’t see any baby meals, and there was no waiter for the baby. Tableware and the like... There is no seat for the breakfast buffet, you have to find a place by yourself, the baby's tableware is self-service, a waiter is completely overwhelmed...
In general, if there are requirements for check-in, this one should be skipped

The front desk told him that there were none. We ordered a medicine for the delivery and called the front desk again, asking if the medicine could be delivered to the room. Unexpectedly, the front desk refused and said no, and asked him to get it himself. I got angry on the spot. I asked if such service in a five-star hotel was reasonable? The front desk hesitated for a while and said that they would call me back after asking. After a while, they said that it was okay and asked me to call him when the medicines were delivered.

The lights outside the room are always turned on very brightly at night, and if the curtains cannot be completely closed, light will definitely leak. The design of various night lights is very unreasonable, especially the washroom cannot be completely turned off, if you want to sleep well, wear an eye mask! The funniest thing is to call the front desk and ask the front desk. The front desk doesn’t know how to turn it off. Do you have any training before starting the job? Said to find someone to come over, waited for half an hour to come, and rang the doorbell at three o'clock in the morning, how dare you come? Opening the cabinet is like playing an escape room, very impersonal design, all kinds of groping to open the cabinet door, and various mindless designs such as the toilet lid must be closed to press the flush button. It is not surprising that it is the concept of the era of the guest house. The last thing is that the breakfast is very unpalatable and there are too many people in the place. If you go later, you will have to queue up.

I had been to Shougang Park before the Winter Olympics. At that time, the hotel was not yet open, so I always wanted to find an opportunity to visit. Although the hotel at night is not brightly lit from the outside, the quietness gives a sense of mystery. My son likes the style of the hotel very much. He said that he has stayed in so many hotels, and this hotel is his favorite. , One step at a time, especially at night, without the noise of the day, if there is enough time, it is a good idea for a few friends to sit and chat and drink some wine. The setting of the room is very user-friendly, I like the oversized luggage table, and I also like that the washbasin is super long. The two beds are put together, plus a small couch. There is no problem with the big two and the small one. The tea table has direct drinking water for making tea. , If you don't drink hot water, you don't need to buy mineral water. When we checked in at night, the front desk staff was very patient and whispered, worried that we would be waiting for a long time, and had been chatting with us happily. , After check-in, it will be delivered to the door of the accommodation area. On the way, help us introduce the location of the restaurant, swimming pool and gym. Because we arrived late, they also gave us a late check-out discount. The breakfast is very good, the chef's pancake craftsmanship is great, it is very popular. The other dishes are plentiful and delicate, and I want to try every one of them. When checking out at noon, the waiters, Taylor and Miranda, were very friendly, and the check-out procedures were fast. They also gave away L'Occitane's toiletries, which was very considerate. In short, it was a very pleasant stay experience, but unfortunately the time was too short, and I plan to come back on May 1st.

msg:The industrial style has a good sense of design, there are many green plants, and the service staff has a good attitude.

At present, there is a shortage of parking, and you can get the p3 parking lot. You have to walk for 20 minutes to go through the security check before the shuttle bus. The shuttle bus can go to the parking lot on the return journey. The buffet dinner is rich, there are not many places to eat in the park, and the restaurant of the hotel is also full.

I paid more than 2,000 for the reservation, more than 2,000 for the room fee, and finally 2,000 for the deposit. I am ashamed of the Shangri-La brand. The service attitude is particularly bad. Totally rude.

The hotel lobby is rebuilt on the basis of the original Shougang Power Plant. The rough and a**ospheric industrial aesthetics are perfectly combined with the splendid human luxury. The facilities in the room are very good, especially the configuration of direct drinking water, so you don't have to worry about not drinking enough water. Special thanks to Miss Miranda, who is in charge of customer relations. She is beautiful and her service is even more beautiful. I like her!

從門廳到大堂，餐廳，客房，沒有一個服務員是笑臉相迎的，都很冷漠，問什麼也愛搭不理
特別是一樓點餐地方，服務態度極差，在一樓點餐的餐食有頭髮，也未有處理，未有任何人給出解決問題的方案，這樣的酒店，真想不到衞生、服務差到這樣。
在一樓點餐的地方，我們帶着長者孩子在多次詢問是否有空位的時候，服務人員直接把我們推出去不管，謊稱樓上有位置，我們長者孩子跑到二樓，無人問津，無服務人員，這個服務太差勁了，完全不是星級酒店該有的服務
在客房要拖鞋也未給送，多次按房間清掃門鈴也不打掃，入住兩天，房間衹象徵的清掃了一次，還不乾淨，房間用品配備還不齊全
在退房結賬的時候，還把賬單弄錯了，多收了錢，去問他們，他們衹輕描淡寫一句，不好意思，真是不語了……
非常非常非常非常不推薦的酒店🏨

小童樂園沒話説，非常適合低齡小童，工作人員很專業很友善，一個樂園裡麪很多工作人員。讓我們放心，也是我們去過最乾淨設施維護最好的五星級酒店小童樂園。有機會還會再去，很滿意的一次體驗。

酒店是在舊發電廠基礎上改建而成，「剛柔並濟」的設計風格，將時尚現代的酒店文化和硬線條的鋼鐵元素完美結合。大堂中庭是小橋流水、處處綠意盎然的園林設計，行走/小憩於此會讓人有置身於東南亞度假的錯覺。酒店房間寬敞整潔，所有設施都比較新，響應環保房間內提供了直飲水設備。早餐種類不算太多，但勝在質素上佳，中西結合、餐食新鮮美味。辦理入住的前台工作人員服務專業周到，並細心、耐心講解酒店的入住相關事宜。吃住行一條龍非常方便，毗鄰六工滙購物中心，步行即可前往首鋼園內大跳台、舊廠房打卡。首鋼園內幾家餐廳也是不錯的選擇。
整體而言是一次非常完美的入住體驗，如果未來有機會還會再次選擇來到這裏😃

缺點：整體有點小家子氣的感覺。比如入住2000的按金。比如早餐需要等位，拼桌也不徵求意見。比如歡迎水果衹第一天有，其實可以根據客人是否食用添加。比如小冰箱不免費，其實衹有可樂果汁啤酒。比如小童樂園送票不能兑現改天再來，並且衹能到12點退房，其實退房了孩子也玩不了多久。比如第一次給選的房間裏有味道，大晚上換房間也不幫忙也沒有補償。其實都是很小的事情，並且大多都可以通過前台解決，但是既然能解決，為什麼不直接大氣一點呢。

酒店早餐非常好，保持了香雞的一貫水準，比一般的京郊酒店早餐自助的品質都要高，早餐的粥和麪檔非常美味，甜品區很受小朋友歡迎。

但這個套餐裏的小食套餐對小朋友不友好，都比較辣，我們家都不怎麼吃辣，所以衹喝了一些果汁。希望酒店大堂吧能對這種小食套餐給予免辣的選項，兼顧不吃辣的人羣。

訂了2間雙床房，連住三天
安排在三樓
1 三樓打掃衞生太差勁，連住第二天衞生地面不打掃，桌面也不乾淨、兩個房間的水杯都是咖啡漬，續住該給的衞生間物品缺少好多樣（香皂、地墊、浴鹽、油等），第二天的水果也不給。
我打了電話質問前台，我續住沒差你們錢，為啥要少東西? 他們才一個個給送過來，還是給的不全，油浴鹽都沒給。
2.每天白天出去玩，回來晚，也是真沒想到大北京香格里拉會出現這種問題，房間全是小飛蟲（看視頻吧），一開燈都飛滿了，膈應壞了。找了他們，第三天説給換房間，一直到下午四點多才給調整好，給換到六樓。
3.三樓一間房全是蟲子，一間房空調製冷沒有，找了他們，空調檢測説是通風口18℃。但我把空調開到16℃，兩小時後房間還是24.5℃，進屋像制熱温度。第三天早上打電話強烈要求換房，才跟着蟲屋，下午四點多一起給換到六樓。
4.上海西安等香格里拉酒店內備有礦泉水及飲料每天給一堆，都讓免費喝，大北京香格里拉房間了弄個直飲水，冰箱裏倒是有飲料水，我喝了一瓶水，再想喝其它，蹲下才發現有個提示收費小條，還沒具體價格，讓掃碼詢價。飲料水收費提示位置放的好講究，得蹲下彎腰才看見!
綜上所述，首鋼香格里拉酒店，住
宿體驗差評! 還是最差!
就沖這一屋子蟲子，五星太虛!

轉天因為有小朋友睡午覺，服務員還給延遲到了14：00退房。樓下的小童設施、泳池讓小朋友們玩的不亦樂乎。早餐品種也很豐富，服務人員也非常友好，及時幫忙收拾餐具，還能主動幫助長者、小童選餐、送餐。見到的每一位服務員都能面帶微笑的和你打招呼。衹可惜週末時間有點兒短，下次有機會還會入住。

msg:帶娃過生日，選擇了首鋼園區香格里拉，帶父母一共7個人定了兩間豪華雙床，一件樹屋，一萬四千多住兩晚，送了每天一份野餐餐食，量挺大，四五個人當下午茶吃，真的不錯，都是西式的，比如三明治、兩種沙拉、兩瓶啤酒、兩瓶酸梅味汽水，兩瓶Vose氣泡水，帶冰塊一桶，還有蝦片、Cup Cake、烤腸和薯條雞翅，B1咖啡廳還送了一次下午茶甜品
還送了兩天户外帳篷的使用，不過，帳篷就在我們樹屋的外側草地，帳篷不大，裏面坐兩人，但是鋪了柔軟的被褥，配了一次性拖鞋，還送兩瓶依雲，一些瓜子豆子小食，也算是有心的服務。
位置交通：
首鋼園區內，導航清楚，注意下車庫要在靠北側這邊的紅綠燈右轉進入下地庫，如果直接開到大堂就開過地庫入口啦

房間景觀：
房間基本都是東西向的，我們的一樓書屋房有户外的小花園，能夠看到旁邊山上的景觀；父母住的七樓豪華雙床間朝西，下午陽光明媚，能看到西邊遠處的山

停車：
免費地下停車，紅色A區距離酒店電梯最近

房間設施：
樹屋，有一張大床，內間有一個樹屋造型的上下鋪，還有一個隔間有張壁床，一家四口絕對能睡得開，孩子特別喜歡樹屋，爬上爬下的，就是小心樹屋上鋪的尖頂造型兩側低，孩子猛然坐起來會撞到頭，這個還是有些危險的，後來我們給他頭枕的位置換到了樹屋上鋪的入口處，會好些。有個連接外屋與內間的小樹洞門，孩子特別喜歡，來回來去的鑽。床品都很舒服，但是，建議一定要給小童準備小童枕頭，普遍親子酒店都忽視這個問題，小童的枕頭都是成人的，對孩子來説太高了！兩個浴室及洗手間，內間帶浴缸。有直飲水，有SMEG的電水壺，有德國米勒廚房電器，有微波爐

性價比：
樹屋房間夠大，但是豪華雙床房其實很小，床挨床

早餐：
款式不是那麼多，但是味道不錯，有煎餅、餛飩等西式也有一些；
餐廳：
入住兩天，第二天，週二的晚上我們決定到樓下餐廳零點晚餐，被告知臨時接了穆斯林團隊，他們是自助餐，餐廳要求我們點清真食物，這真是有些過分，不過協商了之後，我們坐到後面看不到的區域，儘量不影響那個團隊，我們也吃到了想吃的食物。

服務：
前台，客房服務，總機，禮賓部，每個員工都非常親切，響應及時。
游泳池：
恆温水，池子不大，人也不多
健身房：
設備較齊全，乾淨
芽寶樂園，238元單獨付費，兩個小時的時間（平日送了兩小時），這個樂園非常不錯，趣味性高，設施相對高級些，尤其小童拳擊擂台，很有特色。

早餐：餐還可以，但地方太侷促，假期排隊嚴重，體驗很不好。
其他：小童樂園不太大，更適合低齡寶寶。泳池還不錯，在健身房裡，小朋友可以勉強玩一下午。其他就沒有什麼特別可玩的項目，可以報名參觀大跳台，但興趣不大，住了兩晚感到了無聊。如果能再多一些小童活動課程託管就更好。

房間佈置中規中規，值得一提的是準備了瑜伽墊，適合女生。
早餐還算豐富，客人不多，服務比較好。水果新鮮，有現切的，可以自己榨蔬菜水果汁，這點很贊。娃喜歡現剝的菠蘿蜜。
上午去的時候，娃在首鋼園騎車擦傷了膝蓋，酒店大堂的經理和服務人員，積極幫忙，去拿碘伏、紗布等用品，很是感謝他們。
總之，下次還是會考慮帶娃繼續入住香格里拉的。

msg:交通：
1.裏面是個大園區，沒有公共交通，需要開車才方便；2.停車非常方便地庫免費停，唯一不足就是沒有充電樁；
環境及衞生：
1.周邊環境挺不錯，適合拍照，氛圍也好，安安靜靜；2.酒店裝修非常有設計感，但是房間裏面一般，洗澡的地方還有個浴缸很煩，感覺雞肋，然後浴缸裏還臟臟的有毛毛；
總體：
周邊環境還有酒店的設計都不錯，這些雖然重要，但是希望更能提升一下客房衞生及質量。

msg:酒店很新，硬件能打，入住的體驗很好，歡迎禮非常厚道，當然跟訂的房型有關。但是這酒店很明顯定位就是做週末假期酒店的，如果以假期人多，人手不夠用，所以服務跟不上這樣的理由來回答住客的疑問，有一點沒必要了。
在電廠酒廊吃了兩頓午餐，第一頓是菜單7個有4個賣完了，剩下3個各點了一份，但是1個多小時的時間衹上了2個，還有一個沙拉沒上，等不了了退了。第二頓午餐提前30分鐘打電話預訂，入座後發現衹有兩個準備好了，並且上錯了一個，剩下的兩個入座後20分鐘內上的，但是都是温的。
瑕不掩瑜，酒店整體的工業森林的風格其實可以在更多地方體現，連廊，電梯間等等，現在都比較空
滑雪主題房總共4張床，1張2米大床，一個上下鋪都是1.1*2左右的，還有一個壁床，但是壁床在空調回風口下面，空調運轉的時候噪音挺大的。並且空調出風口正好吹在上鋪，所以想睡上鋪的小朋友會有點冷。
房間帶了一個露台，露台和中庭小童設施衹有綠植間隔，並且蚊蟲也着實有點多，露台也沒有可以插蚊香的地方，所以露台基本沒啥用。也看得出來露台很敷衍，泥巴地也比較原始，這個露台如果帶一個私湯浴缸會加分很多。
首鋼園裡賽博朋克的風格很贊，等着高線公園，還有空中連廊貫穿，肯定更贊

提點小建議，1.合理利用後面大片草坪，開發親子小童運動項目、草坪自助餐等，豐富產品線，現在酒店附加娛樂有點少。2.房間內紙巾盒及垃圾桶應合理配置。3.自助餐單點的紅酒品質與價格不在同一水平網上，望降低價格或提升紅酒品質。

     從預訂開始，就有管家非常周到的詢問了需求，到店後一位複姓皇甫的前台非常耐心的幫我把不同房型安排好，然後送到房間的下午茶顏值還是很可的，味道就……衹能説正常水平。
     重點説一下帳篷和BBQ，這真是不能堂食最好的替代了。晚餐一份野餐籃子一份4-6人BBQ，5大2小，吃不完，草地上吹着小風，看着小朋友騎車打鬧。順便説一下，Miranda經理非常貼心的幫我帶一家老小check in ，選帳篷，訂套餐，熱情周到，讓我消費得很愉快。
    最後説一下早餐，一開始説送到房間，後來可能人多了，衹能去自行打包，種類也不太多，但服務態度很好，也疫情期間也理解吧。

🚗 交通：市區過去半小時車程，阜石路一路高架特別順暢
🧹衞生：新店，硬件新加乾淨，還沒什麼新裝修的味道
🍃環境：酒店內的設計相當厲害，把原來的電廠廠房用到了極致，工業風加現代裝修非常和諧，美**用實在是厲害，到了一步一景的程度毫不誇張。另酒店就在首鋼園裡麪，首鋼園本身就是個大公園，加上冬奧主題，有大跳台，出了酒店就能遊玩，隨便走走都舒服，酒店旁還有個很長的棧道，上去能看到首鋼園全景，另有兩個湖，離酒店近的是羣明湖，往北還有個秀池，冬奧組委，星巴克，香啤坊都在那邊，湖邊走走也舒服
🔔服務：訂了兩天的下午茶套餐，可以參觀大跳台，下午四點酒店人員會帶着進大跳台裏面，近距離看大跳台比在外面看感覺更震撼，當天是王旭帶隊去的，小哥哥一路講解，特別有耐心，從冬奧會到首鋼園歷史再到酒店發展，感覺很有想法。還有辦入住和辦退房時，前台的小姐姐lucy和mona都很nice，值班經理（長髮姐姐）也很熱心，幫忙哄娃，幫忙調房間，很是温柔😄

早餐是套餐，沒吃上早餐自助有點可惜，晚餐自助也衹有周五六日開，也沒趕上，還好早餐套餐也好吃加管飽，周邊不遠有西部馬華和合谷瑞幸，吃飯也算方便。
另，疫情管控，有些快遞外賣都進不了首鋼園。
帶寶寶和長者來很合適，下次要去感覺下樂園和自助餐🤭

但是酒店整個格局很繞要去客房需要穿過很長的走廊，而且經常容易迷路不是很方便～～～
由於很新還有裝修的味道，本人對裝修材料很敏感，住了幾天頭暈且眼睛腫了～～
再就是智能家居可能不是特別OK，有天上午7點40突然全房的燈全部亮了～～過了20分鐘自己全部熄滅～～

msg:酒店基礎設施和服務人員的服務態度都很不錯，跟朋友一致認為酒店餐廳比園區內的香啤枋味道更好。

但有幾點需要特別吐槽：
1.酒店配套的大跳台參觀服務，衹包括參觀底部觀眾席區域，是不能登上跳台的。我朋友説在跳台處看到有標識説，遊客120元可登跳台（我沒注意到這個訊息）。如果幾種服務確實是明碼標價分開的，那酒店介紹頁面對於“參觀跳台”一項有刻意模糊之嫌。且參觀時間4-5pm，由於觀眾席實在沒什麼看的，大家基本4:20左右都看完往外走了；但是給觀眾席參觀區看門的保安不在崗位，酒店禮賓部人員也不見蹤影，所有人大風天都等在柵欄處，給酒店打了兩個電話才有人來開門，體驗極差。

2、房間內提示24小時可掃碼送餐和商品，但是晚間掃碼後，顯示無菜單可使用。實際服務時間估計是跟一樓餐廳一致的。

3、康體中心的泳衣烘乾機，待機狀態下是蓋子打開狀態，因此大部分時間是蓋子內部朝外。但是蓋子內部無中文説明，僅有英文。衹有使用時把蓋子蓋上才能看見中文提示。導致我們去的時候，一個烘乾機直接被客人誤當成了垃圾桶扔了垃圾進去。此外主入口的藝術裝置，介紹牌上也僅有英文無中文。就一句話的設計説明，加上一個翻譯不是一件難事。這是國內的酒店，中文説明是第一順位；客人入住衹需要提供身份證明，不需要託福雅思成績單。

        都是小事，但可以窺見管理上的漏洞。打這麼多字是真誠希望酒店加以重視，不要因細節浪費得天獨厚的建築條件和名聲。也希望其他

結果這次香格里拉住店之旅堪稱完美 服務真的超一流以為到了日本 可能疫情期間住店人少 從電話諮詢到最後離開 都是管家式地服務。得知我是帶小孩過生日 酒店送了一個大蛋糕 還給屋內搭了小帳篷～checkin的時候是值班經理領我們進的房間 做了各種詳細介紹 非常温馨。前台服務人員也都很親切 雖然不能堂食對餐飲體驗打了折扣 但是感覺自己信誓旦旦地還會再來。下回疫情過去來體驗小童樂園合康體中心～
贈送的歡迎甜品和我們combo裏的大跳台下午茶不要太有創意！住店期間我們一家攝入的糖分簡直爆表 好在用的材料都是黑巧哈哈
再説到酒店的設計是保留了原來首鋼電廠主框架結構做的非常酷的工業風酒店設計 小男孩很喜歡～我本來也非常鍾愛這種超高挑空 有金屬 有綠植有水系的一個融合風格 整個大廳是很有神祕感和驚喜感的。
我們帶着孩子也沒好好拍照 如果舉辦婚禮的話 是個非常出片和有未來感的好地方。
工作人員還給帶進大跳台和谷愛淩小姐姐奪冠的地方拍了個紀念照[偷笑R][偷笑R][偷笑R]不虛此行！
這個生日雖然爸爸媽媽都在輪流工作。。不過也是非常充實了！
感謝辦入住的karen 退房是jack 還有mona和所有的服務人員 [呲牙]

msg:4月初的首鋼園，還是顯得光禿禿的，沒有花，植被也很少，倒是和鋼筋水泥的整體建築不違和。
規定2點入住，實際等到3:30之後才通知房間收拾出來了，原因是我想要一個朝向稍好一些的房間……拿到房卡之後前台也幫我們延遲退房到了次日下午兩點，這點不抱怨
酒店很新，一層大門進去之後能看到很多綠植，看着心情很好，可能也會一定程度地起到吸收新裝修有害氣體的作用。
房間不大，設施也是基本的五星酒店的配置，朝西的房間沒有建築物遮擋確實視野開闊很多，洗手間和浴房分開，這樣的格局比較方便，互不打擾。
餐廳在一樓，寬敞，座位間距是令人滿意的。在這吃了晚餐和早餐，餐品普遍品種少，但是晚餐還是勉強可以滿意的，畢竟500一人的餐標，前台的服務員聲稱和紫竹橋香格里拉要價一樣，但是人家是有龍蝦的，然鵝這裏已衹有限量沒人一衹的對蝦，兩衹當中還有一衹頭部切開一股渾濁的水噴出來，明顯新鮮度也有問題，叫服務員拿走之後也沒有對此作出任何解釋。燒臘台、刺身日料台還是不錯的，背後的沙拉台就很差，食材品種極少，料汁全部是超市售賣的直接上瓶子，服務更差，櫃枱背後的女士，非常不耐煩的指揮：把料放在瓶子裏，搖，倒盤子裏，芝士？沒有，橄欖？沒有。嗯，總之最好別繞過來，啥都沒有。
餐廳會單獨點評，總之燒臘台的師傅服務超級的好，一個廣東腔的廚師，熱情的介紹菜品，旁邊一直推薦烤鴨的師傅也是，感覺人家是在做有熱情的開心的事。
然而早餐就更差了，品種少的可憐
健身房很新，而且沒有人，我在的一個半小時，竟然衹有我一個人在用。
有一個小童樂園，設施也還不錯，就是單獨收費，費用198一天，兩小時158，裏面的設施適合低齡小童，可以先進去看一眼適不適合自家寶貝，再決定購買門票。
設施令人幾乎滿意，但是一如既往地，香格里拉集團的服務真的是……
退房的時候，前台的小姐姐禮貌性地問了一句“住的怎麼樣？”我也禮貌性地回了一句“還可以，就是早餐品種太少”你就説是淡季控制成本，不想做得豐盛，其實大家都可以理解，可偏偏前台一個年長的，個子高、黑、眼袋很突出的女士聽到了我們的對話，湊過來説，我們的早餐是半自助，哪尼？！你們酒店的客人都沒吃過半自助？！那到桌旁現點現做的主菜是什麼？！煎蛋嗎？！不會説話，就不要給客人説教，好嗎。頓時讓人好感全無。
疫情之下，精品酒店、度假酒店都在不斷地提升服務，北京香格里拉集團幾家酒店的服務都叫人不甚滿意，然而你説自己衹是個普通商務酒店的定位不想卷，我完全認可，可是糊弄客人的僥倖心理可不能有。

室內小童樂園也不錯，比想象中大一些（雖然也不算特別大），滑梯海洋球蹦床這些常見的都有。服務人員很負責任，孩子在裏面摔了一跤，然後工作人員立刻寸步不離各種哄各種陪，還送了棒棒糖。
唯一美中不足是覺得餐廳稍微有點少，要是能多開幾家餐廳就更好了

另外雖然不能堂食，但是點餐的時候餐廳都會盡量滿足客人的要求，可以點菜單上沒有的青菜和例湯，大晚上孩子要喝牛奶，酒店的工作人員用盡力給孩子滿足，非常感謝！
另外酒店的芽寶樂園遊樂項目很豐富，而且很新很乾凈，工作人員對孩子很有耐心，孩子玩的不想走。
Miranda帶孩子進房間的時候還特意給孩子安排了尋寶遊戲，並且提前給孩子準備了整整一車的巧克力棉花糖，孩子們太開心了，以後一定會再次入住的。

服務：整體人員服務是最值得讚揚的，前台小哥、服務枱還有其他人員服務主動性還有人性化都做的很好。
房間設施：作為一家新酒店，房間設施肯定是不錯，而且衞生間乾濕分離的方式略少見，床品屬於比較適中的，房間整體表現良好。
停車：酒店自帶大型停車場，開車前來非常方便。
衞生：客房清潔頻率有點問題，在這裏入住的12小時中一次客房整理、清潔也沒有，不知道是有意而為還是什麼。
餐廳：餐廳問題也比較多，首先要説的是早餐表現在這個水平的酒店略微顯得有點不過關，幾乎沒有亮點，種類也就剛剛達標。其次，週末中午酒店的餐廳衹提供自助，還有極多的外賓在排隊，住店客人衹能去酒廊點簡餐吃，關鍵是自助餐也不是每個人都喜歡吃的，這個操作非常難以理解，希望後續可以改進。
整體來説，服務和硬件都比較值得推薦，但餐飲方面的整體拉胯讓人無法忽視，希望酒店後續可以考慮方案解決。

游完泳回來，正巧迎面碰上服務員送水果，我喊了一句是622房間的麼，服務員説是，緊接着就用工卡把房間門給我打開了………
沒有任何的核對，沒有要求我用自己的房卡再掃一遍門，確認我是“房主”[汗顏R][汗顏R]我就這麼輕鬆的進了房，那換做別人呢？也能進？
入住三個多小時，我實在忍不住想吐槽，真的沒看出任何專業性、服務態度

首鋼園區內 
首鋼園區好大，預訂後就會有預訂部的人員聯繫客人確定到店時間以及告知客人由於冬奧原因，禮賓部會去園區進口接送客人. 並告知入園區前需要預約時間，很温馨
首鋼建築都很美，雖然到店已經是黃昏，但依然能感覺到美麗夕陽映射下的首鋼園以及網紅大橋的美麗狀況，酒店有地面停車場和地下停車場. 

餐飲：
大堂吧的下午茶，西餐廳的簡餐，啤酒坊的夜宵，第二天西餐廳的早餐. 
菜品出品很用心
服務很貼心 
疫情期間服務員都配備一次性手套和口罩，讓客人感覺更安全. 出品也是很用心，目前沒有自助，均為零點菜單. 

房間：
amenity太有心了，螺絲扳手造型，與酒店園區的感覺整體化. 
酒店是12.28日開業，每間房間都配備了blueair的空氣凈化器，放心入住. 

我要重要説説床，好大啊，而且很舒服，一覺睡到天亮. 完美.

這次入住時間有些趕，到的太晚衹看到了日落，退房太早，衹看到了日出. 
期盼下次能有機會再來首鋼園好好體驗好好遊玩. 

首鋼香格里拉是目前唯一工業建築還原原始遺留建築並有綠化樹木環繞的設計酒店，值得你來探索. 

下次見～

2. 服務可能是近幾年住過的酒店裡最差的，這香格里拉是真不行：1）客房服務。開個聯通房的門的事，ci的時候就告知了，結果還要再打三次電話、等了20多分鐘才有人過來開門；2）餐廳服務。吃晚飯的時候，一是桌子的預訂情況三個人三個説法，管理極為混亂，住店客人也沒有優先；二是菜品種類極少，上菜極慢；三是點個乳鴿居然不配備一次性手套，跟服務員要了之後等了半天，拿了個好像是後廚員工用的那種一次性手套過來，真的很無語；四是眼見着員工在餐廳區域中備餐，這種管理符合衞生規定嗎？五是跟服務員要意見單填意見，居然説先説沒有、然後説去找找，找了十分鐘也沒等到，索性走了。
3. 小童樂園還不錯。
4. 早餐還可以，特別是麪做得不錯。

雖然衹入住了一個晚上，但基本上包括早餐、泳池在內都體驗到了，很開心也很滿意。
唯一覺得可以改善的是酒店入口是不是可以再增加一個？不知道是不是因為防疫要求，入口衹有一個正門，距離帳篷區比較遠，如果需要去衞生間的話不太方便。可以加一個附近的酒店入口就完美啦。

msg:酒店設計注重細節，元旦入住還送了有首鋼特色的巧克力盤。酒店雖然是剛剛開業，但是房間裏沒有什麼裝修的味道，工作人員服務意識強熱情周到，酒店的餐廳環境很有特色，植物和鋼鐵水泥的平衡點把控不容易，餐品品種雖然不是特別多，但是品質很好，服務員總是面帶微笑主動熱情的招待你，入住體驗五星好評

msg:酒店硬件其實非常好，大堂裝修很氣派，但是房間引導很差，而且也沒有引導員，入住找房間比較費勁。周邊基本沒有配套，買包煙都沒地方買，套餐裏的參觀大跳台一點意義都沒有，周邊大片面積圍起來，哪都不好去，什麼火車樂園，石景山公園都是虛設，隨意封路，哪都不讓你進。
酒店設的規則也很離譜，套餐裏含的項目不預約還不讓你玩，那不讓玩你咋不給我退錢？就是想盡辦法薅羊毛？
早上吃早飯，排隊，我在那排了半天，後面來的人先開口報房間號接待員就讓我先等一下，憑什麼先來我還要等？我還帶着孩子的，你們知道啥叫秩序嗎？
最後儘管酒店有很多讓人不滿意的地方，但是前台還是有很熱心的服務員是盡心盡力幫忙解決問題的，這也是酒店給我感覺唯一有點温暖的地方吧。可惜的是我忘記問他名字了，是7月2日下午在前台最左邊的一個男服務員，態度真的超級好！

msg:必須好好表揚一下這個酒店，從硬件、到服務、到風景、到娛樂都非常非常好！
硬件：酒店裝修風格真的太讚了，特別晚上亮燈以後，綠植和工業風完美融合。我住這麼多五星酒店幾乎從不拍大堂等公共區域，但是這個酒店我拍了好多，長者孩子也拍的很開心。
風景：首鋼園很大，娃光在湖邊扔石頭野餐打水槍都夠玩半天。此外，還能在觀眾席近距離參觀大跳台俯看羣名湖，可以在跳台下的巨大空地上騎滑板車扔飛盤，可以在水上棧道餵魚觀景，可以打卡各種高爐煙囱等工業風建築。我也衹是逛了一小塊，還有很多沒去到，而且一些購物中心和店鋪餐廳還沒開，等疫情過去了能去的地方更多。
酒店娛樂：有室內外小童樂園，但比較簡單。我們喜歡去帳篷營地，可以吃燒烤租帳篷看露天電影，還免費提供一些諸如滑板車羽毛球等玩具。
服務：太好了！遇到的每個人都很和善周到，幫忙辦理入住的楊碩，帶我們參觀跳台的禮賓部小黃，非常熱情，服務周到，還主動幫我們預約游泳時間，介紹園區景點。特別要感謝當天晚上的值班經理周琪，半夜1點多我兒子突然鼻血不止，床單被子弄了很多血，我完全沒經驗嚇壞了，她幫忙找了冰袋、加濕器，聯繫人換了床品，還專業的指導我們怎麼處理，非常可靠！也在此説一聲給晚上值班的工作人員添麻煩啦~
走的時候兒子哭着鬧着不走，説太喜歡這裏了，還要住~嗯嗯，以後一定還會再來多住幾天的！
另外提兩個小建議：酒店的早餐、下午茶都很棒，但晚餐種類（特別中餐）跟海灣半山一類比還是有點兒單調。另外，希望可以有些親子自行車一類方便出行，畢竟園區太大了。

msg:連續住了兩天，第一天入住的時候竟然無緣無故被安排了連通房，房間的格局奇怪不説，自己這邊的房門竟然可以隨意打開 也沒有任何可以上鎖的地方，感覺毫無安全感！無奈之下還是打電話到了前台更換房間。前台小姐姐很快就給我們換了新的房間，並幫我們把東西都搬過去了。
衞生的問題，在打掃完房間的情況下，我竟然發現外賣的垃圾沒有清理 依舊擺在那裡，還有小朋友在床邊竟然發現了別人使用過的一次性眼葯水瓶，不知道貴酒店是不是要加強一下衞生方面的工作。
再來説一下讓我最無語的地方，因為是帶着兩個小朋友出門，早上去吃早餐的時候稍微晚了一點點，餐廳門口的工作人員十分冷漠的説已經閉餐了，可是早餐也不是自助形式，是單點的形式，不知道晚了那麼一點點會對你們準備午餐造成多大的影響，哪怕你跟我説早餐時間結束，隨便為您提供一些。無奈小朋友又很餓，衹能出門帶着他們去吃飯了。還是希望酒店能夠更加人性化一些吧。

msg:冬奧會的熱點帶起了西邊這個首鋼園的酒店，看朋友圈下午茶環境很好的樣子，就帶全家週末去住一下。到了發現是冬奧會之後剛開業的，就在大跳台旁邊，reception和lobby都建在首鋼園的一棟電廠廠房裡，很cool，可能是剛開業，服務超細緻，也很得體。因為在訂單備註過有小寶寶入住，在洗手間看到酒店給寶寶準備的洗漱衣物玩具等備品，以及一塊磁鐵畫板玩具，很貼心了。衹是從客房不能直通一層餐廳，必須穿過一段小走廊換電梯。餐廳週末供應含海鮮魚生的自助餐，所以兩天都爆滿。
總體來講還是滿意的，園區很大，酒店旁就有大草坪還有湖，很適合遛娃~

msg:17—19號兩天對首鋼園香格里拉酒店的體驗， 用一個詞來形容真是跌宕起伏。首先到店被安排在811房間，一個視野相對開放的房間，但從房間的環境以及整體配置來説，和價格近似的同類型酒店比較，衹能説精細不夠，樸素有餘，從舒適度來説，商務氣息更濃厚一些，如果你不是非要感受首鋼園，並且還是很在意感官的舒適度，那麼1500元的價格，我覺得你可以考慮城裡的同類型酒店，窗外的風景也許不是開闊的草坪和綿延的河流，但是白天的車水馬龍，晚間的燈火輝煌也能讓你既可以體會到北京的繁華也可以領略一下市井的煙火氣。總之這個1500元的價格，舒適度上應該是你説了算的。但如果你是衝著首鋼園和冬奧的氣息來的，那麼首鋼園附近也有價格便宜一半商務酒店，首鋼園裡有，附近的五棵松也有，住宿也很方便。
     看夠了窗外的風景，真正坐下來，發覺811這間房間冷，於是調製空調，這才發現空調的智能控制面板上衹有代表製冷的小雪花，不管你調多少度，哪怕是調到了35度，面板上的小雪花依然堅挺，代表制熱的小太陽始終深藏不露，看樣子是智能的電腦有了自主的意識，它認為我不應該冷，所以小太陽就不出來，人腦究竟犟不過電腦，衹好打電話求助，非常可心的是，工作人員，值班經理徐女士不但態度温和有禮，並且處理問題相當迅速，這的確是香格里拉一貫的工作作風，遇到問題不推諉，不解釋，迅速解決，之後5分鐘工程人員就到了，兩位師傅很認真的進行了調試，也不厭其煩的對空調出風口進行了測試，確定涼風有了温度才走，對工作人員的敬業我還是要表示感謝，但是遺憾的是，態度沒有解決温度，40分鐘過去了，涼風依然在稍有温度的狀態下悠閑的淌遊，熱風依然是猶抱琵琶半遮面，要來不來的，孩子實在冷的受不了了，此時已經是晚上10點半左右了，1500元的價格，這實在令人遺憾，衹能再打電話，同樣，徐經理雷厲風行，一陣風似的，幾乎在我剛剛收拾好行李的時候，她就來了，幫我拿起各種行李，立馬安排我住進了711，並且一再的道歉，這種酒店的軟實力讓你就是有再大的氣也平息了，人家大晚上的容易嗎。對徐經理表示感謝。但是，但是，我的感激在過了一晚上之後，18號早晨7點，我再次對1500元的香格里拉處於了無語的狀態，並且有了馬上離開的念頭，因為房間的空調是熱了，但是，但是  但是1500價格的房間，電源插銷是壞的，沒有電，孩子要網課，我要開早會，於是我和孩子擠在沙發上，輪流用唯一一個嵌在牆上的有電的插銷，最終我敗給孩子，放棄了早會，請假並承擔老闆的雷霆風暴，如果這會我是無奈，那5分鐘後我就是絕望了，1500價格的香格里拉的酒店房間，居然沒有冰箱，沒有咖啡機，衹有充分的冰涼的礦泉水，我沒有辦法給孩子作個熱奶茶，我開始暴怒了，徐經理在接受了我的暴怒之後，依然用温和有禮的態度道歉，又是5分鐘沖到了我的房間，帶着熱氣騰騰的咖啡和剛出爐的麪包，雞蛋，第一句話是“別餓着孩子”，做媽媽的我一下破防了，咖啡專門準備了兩杯，一杯美式，一杯拿鐵，考慮實在是仔細，好吧，在周到的服務面前，我接受了徐經理的建議，收回了退房的房卡，決定住滿預訂的時間。但是事情沒有結束，跟電視劇一樣，一波三折的高潮還沒有到來。
   也許是酒店也沒有遇到過像我這樣能把所有偶然事件都經歷一遍的人，酒店的主管經理陳經理專門來看我，並約我在酒店賦予南國氣質的大堂享受一份下午茶的悠閑，説實話，我很被陳經理折服，一個年輕的姑娘，遇到我這樣已經被偶然事件折磨的疲勞的客人，依然真誠的講述了酒店方面的原因，酒店開業不久，一切都在努力磨合階段，每一個房間，每一道流程，酒店也都是在努力多次試用沒有問題之後才對客人開放，都是職場混的人，我能體會到她的真誠和努力，並體會到她一直在談話中，有禮，有距的照顧我，這樣的服務來自於一位看上去不滿30歲的年輕姑娘，我真是折服，我想這才是我要把香格里拉推薦給大家的原因，你能體會到服務的真諦，温和有禮，不是簡單的熱情而是周到，有距，一切都是剛剛好，是你想要的服務，這大概是香格里拉酒店一直遵循的品牌魅力吧。實在難得。於是我也欣然接受了，陳經理讓我多住半天的邀請，也接受了她代表酒店贈與我的，我和孩子一份特製下午茶的邀請。可惜事情往往不按你希望的來，你以為風平浪靜了，可是下一秒就會風起雲湧，我這邊剛剛被陳經理折服，那邊房間裏上課的孩子就發出了“求救的信號”，一定是酒店的智能“大腦”就是不喜歡我和孩子，於是智能的大腦在沒有和陳經理預先協商的情況下，它伸出它智能的“爪子”，讓1500塊錢一天的，711房間的窗户上的窗簾和浴室的遮光簾自動的上上下下，合上拉開，是自動的哦，是智能的“爪子”讓它開它就開，讓它合它就合，並且窗簾和遮光簾是此起彼伏，媽呀，房間在忽明忽暗間交替了兩輪，媽呀，孩子以為是恐怖片，嚇得哇哇叫，我頓足捶胸，豪氣萬丈，來吧，香格里拉的智能，你還想對我怎樣，我已經免疫了！從17號到18號，這一天半里，我經歷了沒有暖氣，電源插銷沒有電，，窗簾自動隨意開關，房間找不到冰箱的蹤影，你不會在1500元一間的房間裏喝上一杯由咖啡機打出的熱咖啡，還有什麼是我沒經歷的，來吧，讓經歷更豐富些吧！但是，但是，但是，但是，當陳經理把一杯熱騰騰的檸檬水放在我手裡，鞠躬跟孩子道歉，並抽出半天的時間陪伴我和孩子，安撫恐怖片後情緒，也以最快的時間和工程部溝通，進行房間檢查和修復，然後又安排我們的晚餐，我的心又軟了，孩子也被陳姐姐折服了，説，媽媽，就按陳姐姐説的再住一天吧，她説話真温和呀！好吧，18號就這樣在一系列的偶然事件中度過了，我和孩子也再一次再軟實力面前被征服，等我們領略了首鋼園的夜晚燈火回到711時，房間也整理的煥然一新，直到我們19號下午離開房間，這次硬件，智能的大腦再沒有自行跑出來搗亂。我以為體驗終於可以完美收官了，但是，但是，但是，但是，但是。。。。。。。。
我要説的是，經歷並沒有結束，酒店的硬件事件，我都在工作人員和風細雨的真誠中諒解了，但是接下來，在19號下午發生的事情，我至今不能諒解，儘管酒店給予瞭解決方案，我依然不能諒解。什麼事情呢？酒店的服務人員不知何故，用一把幾乎是萬能房卡的卡，在沒有敲門的情況下，徑自用房卡刷開了我們的房門，房間裏當時就衹有孩子在，並且我的孩子是一個小姑娘，我不知道酒店是哪個環節出現了錯誤，也不知道酒店是否有萬能的房卡，一卡能刷開所有的房門，更不敢想如果這個拿着房卡的人是一個男員工會怎樣，或者這張房卡如果從酒店流出去，打開房門的不是酒店的員工，後果又會是什麼！細思極恐啊！也許是我敏感，但是我住酒店的私隱和安全如何保證？你的員工衹在一瞬間就用一張房卡刷開了我的房門，説明我的房卡不是唯一的，我的房間可以隨意出入，並且你刷開我房間的時間並不是早晨打掃房間的時間，即使你是在工作時間，或者你弄錯了房間，那是不是在你刷開房門之前需要敲敲門呢？服務的最低標準難倒不是對私隱和安全的保障嗎？如果這個都不能保障，那就別談什麼舒適度了。當然酒店給出瞭解決方案，但是我作為一個孩子母親我不能諒解，因為後怕。也請酒店的工作人員諒解我的不能諒解。
兩天半的經歷，可以説首鋼園香格里拉的硬件軟件我都體驗了，客觀的説，硬件的問題的確是偶然事件，衹是我不走運都趕上了，但是我的確相信，在工作人員軟實力強大的情況下，硬件一定會調試好的。當然體驗中的遺憾是不能抹殺，我對酒店兩位經理姑娘服務的感謝，我確實體會到了她們帶給我的，細緻，周到，温和，有禮有距的舒適的服務，我表示感謝。也真誠的希望酒店發生在我身上的不能被諒解的安全事件不要再發生了。如果非要最後有個總結成詞的話，首先這是不是網絡推文，這是真實經歷的記錄；其次如果在你經濟條件允許的情況下，你就是衝著首鋼園去的，那麼香格里拉酒店的服務還是值得你親自體驗的。

msg:我們是衝著奧特曼主題房去的，酒店是在首鋼工業園中，有工業風的硬朗也有鮮花綠植的柔美，兩者相結合我太喜歡了
我們是平日入住人不多，房間很安靜也很乾凈，最重要的是聽説孩子過生日特意做了簡單的佈置，還有扮演奧特曼的工作人員為孩子提供了充足的情緒價值，生日當天贈送了蛋糕，蛋糕絕對味道沒得説，沒有那麼甜但是又很純粹
可惜的是: 芽寶樂園是單獨收費的，並不是對住店客人免費開放，價格呢也確實不便宜
最後非常感謝jessie王亞萌的服務，下次還會選擇
