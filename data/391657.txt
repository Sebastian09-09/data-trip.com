msg:the room is rather small and the toothbrush and kits provided is rather low quality. nice bathtub but there’s no bath salt provided. and the shower foam bottle is locked so it’s inconvenient to use if you are planning to use the bathtub. bed is fine but pillow is too soft. location is great though. service is quite subpar so nothing to shout about really- there’s better hotels within the area for sure.

msg:My children and me enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It is clean and the service is very friendly. I speak Chinese so communication was not a problem. In the mall, which is connected to the hotel you can find a indoor play area and many shops and restaurants. My children thought the hotel was a family hotel. If you order food from outside a roboter will bring it to your door, nothing special in China but quite a highlight for us. The room is spacious, the interior style is not super modern but in great condition. The room service cleaned our room even late in the afternoon. When we arrived at the hotel before check in time our room was not ready, but the front desk offered us a different room to rest, which I really appreciated. The swimming pool area is clean and again very helpful and friendly staff. I think it is more suitable for swimming labs then for children to play, so we only went there once. But in Beijing there is always more than enough to do anyways. The location of the hotel is quite central to all major sightseeing spots by car. It is a 15-20min drive to Sanlitun. Thanks for the great stay!

I felt at home! This is my favorite hotel and I will return to it for all my holidays in Beijing. The German restaurant was so authentic. The food was far better than I’d ever tasted in other German restaurants. We went back three times. Blue Frog was also amazing and the service was very unique. We ate there 4 times. The manager was super helpful he helped us add another 3 days to our stay. The waiters at Blue Frog were super friendly and helpful. Everything was delivered with a smile. I highly recommend this hotel! I give it 12 Stars! The Hilton can learn a lot from this hotel.

But breakfast need to be upgraded immediately. Tabel keep messy after people finshed breakfast for much too long and following people had problems to find a clean table. 

But realy disappointing was that the refill after cheese run out, same to sausage, ham and salami, was only done after I asked twice for refill. This refil has to be done without asking for that and staff generally react very slowly, totally opposite to front desc which was great

I would like to thank all the staff from the reception which has been extremely kind and helpful during my stay, and a special thank to 王树玲 who has been extremely kind in cleaning the room and always being present when needed.

There is only one restaurant which is very unusual for 5 star hotels and the breakfast was palatable but not spectacular. This hotel has a decent mall attached to it which is convenient and its within reasonably close proximity to the main city center. 
We had access to the executive lounge and associated priveledges which was nice however the lounge is quite dated and would serve a better purpose if it were converted to a second restaurant offering. Pool and gym are standard.
Lack of natural light in the hotel public spaces which is not very nice. Seems quite dim and the lobby lounge is small. I would not scale this as a premium 5 star and we will probably try a different hotel next time we are in town.

Facilities: The gym and swimming pool are well equipped and close at 11 o'clock in the evening. Even if you are busy all day, you can still seize the opportunity to exercise at the end.
Health: In fact, I used to stay here in Chaoyang District when I came to Beijing on business eight or nine years ago. I didn’t feel much change when I came again this time. The hotel is well maintained, the hygiene is also well maintained, the cleaning is timely, and the room service is fast.
I will choose it next time!

It seems that there is no special socket at the head of the bed. I don’t know if I didn’t find the right place. Fortunately, my charging cable is long enough.

The transportation around the hotel is very convenient, and free parking is available.

The service in the executive lounge is also in place. We brought our baby with us, which caused a lot of trouble for the service staff, and they were all very enthusiastic~

msg:The hotel is located in the Chaoyangmen area of ​​the Second Ring Road, very close to the World Trade Center and Sanlitun. There is a big star among its neighbors: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China. The subway Chaoyangmen Station is right at the door. The location is extremely advantageous. Although the hardware facilities are not the most advanced, they are mainly clean. Connected to the hotel is U-Tang Shopping Center. There are also bookstores, cinemas, restaurants, and leisure facilities inside. . . . It is very convenient to eat, buy things and watch movies. Food, drink and entertainment are all available. In terms of the price of the hotel, I feel that it is very cost-effective. The environment of the hotel is also good, very quiet. The hotel swimming pool is a very nice presence.
Our stay coincided with the Spring Festival, and the floor attendant Shi Lixia also gave us small gifts, including lucky bags, Year of the Dragon greeting cards, and small dolls, which was very thoughtful. very touched. The hotel staff have a very good service attitude and are responsive to all requests. I didn't communicate on the phone before arriving and didn't want to stay in the back room. The hotel responded quickly and tried its best to arrange it. When I checked in after arriving, I was upgraded to a room for free and a fruit plate was thoughtfully given.
The front desk manager, Zhang Yu, is a handsome guy, very humane, warm-hearted and considerate. There was also an unknown young lady who was very warm and considerate when she helped me check in. I must give this a thumbs up. There is also a manager Zhang (I'm sorry I forgot which depar**ent he is from, I only know his surname is Zhang, a man), his service attitude is also very good, he responds to all requests, and makes guests feel at ease.
Someone in the comment area said that the hotel's facilities were old and smelled of mold, and they spent a lot of money to stay in a guest house. I stayed here for four days (February 10th to 14th) (room 1611). This has not happened at all. I feel that the person who made the comment is talking nonsense and misleading the crowd. The waiter will take care of it every day. As soon as I entered the hotel, the first thing I smelled was the smell of incense, and there was no moldy smell in the room. Please don’t listen to one-sided words. The important thing is to experience and feel for yourself.
One of the highlights of the hotel🏨 is their meals, which taste very authentic. You can taste it yourself instead of listening to what others say.
Another highlight is that the luggage storage service is still provided after guests check out, so that guests do not have to carry heavy luggage to visit scenic spots. This service really solves a big problem for guests, and is very considerate and deserves special praise. In addition, there are cute robots that shuttle around each floor to provide various services to guests, which is really nice [strong]
In addition, the deposit will be refunded quickly!

Disclaimer: This is also my first time to stay in this hotel. Because I decided to come to Beijing at the last minute, I booked the hotel in a hurry. Also because it was during the Spring Festival and many places, including the hotel where we usually stay, were fully booked. I searched and found that U-Tang Holiday Hotel had available rooms and booked it. So I am not a shill, everything described is my personal experience.
Summary: The hotel has an excellent location and is convenient for travel. It is also connected to the shopping mall, making life convenient. The staff's service attitude is very good, and the check-in experience is extremely comfortable and feels like home. It will definitely be our first choice next time we come to Beijing.
All five-star reviews!

Because it is not an Internet celebrity hotel, there is no price increase during the New Year, and the price/performance ratio is very 🉑. After being upgraded to a high floor, the room temperature is very warm, which is perfect for my baby who is afraid of cold in winter. The service attitude is also very good and responsive to all requests. By default, late check-out is at 14:00, and self-check-out is available, which greatly improves check-out efficiency. I will choose here next time hehe

The front desk staff was very considerate and provided children's toiletries and slippers. When we checked in, we communicated that we had two children, one older and one younger, so they arranged a corner room with a lot of space. Since we checked in too late, we asked for something and asked for an extra bed. The room service staff have always been very enthusiastic; the most embarrassing thing is that they will not turn off the air conditioner in the middle of the night, and they ask the guest room to help turn off the air conditioner. The attitude is very good; the breakfast buffet sample is very complete, and there are even Chinese-style pancakes and fruits, and beef rice noodles. You must try it, the braised beef is big and fresh. I will come back when I stay in a hotel in the city center.

The lobby It's very small, with only two chairs, and there must be a lot of dust in the room. Old five-star hotels in urban areas like Beijing are too old. It is really possible that Atour is clean. I suggest you check the renovation time before checking in in the future.

First of all, hygiene: extremely poor. The table, bathroom, and toilet are extremely dirty.
Secondly, the environment: It's really fresh. It's a five-star hotel. The central air conditioner can't blow out hot air. People say they provide an electric heater for heating. Several lights are broken. There is no charging port at the bedside. We don't want things like electric curtains.
Last service: My aunt came last minute and wanted to borrow a sanitary napkin from the front desk. Her attitude was very bad and she said she didn’t have one.
Really, I want to ask, which aspect of your health, environment, and services is worthy of your housing prices? It took 3 swipes on the room card for the elevator to get a response. Not to mention swiping the door, it won't open at all. Just plug it in there. If you're lucky, you can get in after ten or so times. Finally, everyone is invited to see the real picture! ! ! ! !

At the same time, we saw that we had a room upgrade with our children. And complimentary breakfast, super awesome 👍! The room facilities are quite good, and the location is convenient. It's not far from the subway entrance, so it's quick to go anywhere. There's a commercial complex next to it, so shopping and dining are convenient!

The hotel's small robot can deliver meals very promptly. The service staff are polite and can respond to any questions as soon as possible. I highly praise the cleaning staff on the 17th floor between 9.20 and 9.27. He should be a boy who is very attentive and courteous to guests. He not only cleans the room but also neatly stacks some sundries, medicines, etc., which exceeds the expectations of the guests! And Benjamin, the young man who checked in at the front desk, understood my accommodation needs and matched me with a suitable room. Because I stayed there for a long time, I had contact with many service staff. There was also a leader who helped the elderly and children upgrade their rooms. Overall, it's very safe to stay here, the location is great, and the breakfast is hearty, including pancakes, fruit, tofu and shaved noodles! My elderly man wanted to give his child a glass of ice-free watermelon juice. An old man who was in charge of freshly squeezed juice actually squeezed a glass of ice-free watermelon juice for his child by himself and even helped bring it out! Really touched! Will definitely come again! The quality of the staff is excellent!

1. A deposit is required for hotel check-in. But when I checked out, I didn't mention when I would check out. Until I specifically called back to ask. Just told me 48 hours. (I’m not saying that there are fewer people who don’t refund deposits on the spot now, right?)
2. The check-in service is very good. Gotta boast. The invoice is also issued in advance and sent to the mailbox. But when I asked about the invoice when I checked out, I didn't know anything about it.
3. In the room. The bedside table was not wiped clean and was sticky. I can only call someone to wipe it after 11 o'clock (nothing else. I don't know what it is... I really don't want to wipe it myself, for fear of nausea)
4. The room is old. This is not a drawback. The location is pretty good. It's just plain old.

I checked in directly on the 20th floor and was given a light meal and breakfast in the evening. The service was very considerate and the room arrangement was very good. Made me feel at home. In addition, I am very satisfied with the hotel's swimming pool. The water quality is clean and the water temperature is suitable. Most importantly, there are not too many people. When I checked out, the two service staff helped me postpone my check-out until the afternoon and also gave me afternoon tea as a gift. I was very satisfied.

The water is It is warm and has a massage function.
The hotel room is very hygienic and well-equipped. The toiletries are from Borghese, and they feel good to use. The problem is that the air conditioner in the room cannot be adjusted separately. If it is too cold, it can only be turned off and on again.
I saw the cake at the coffee shop on the first floor and thought it was good, but unfortunately I couldn’t buy a small portion, so I tried one. It turned out to be lava, which couldn’t be cut into pieces, and the taste was not bad.
The nearby businesses are very easy to visit. You can eat and play for a long time with your little friends. When you have no travel goals, you can soak for two days.

The sound insulation of the room is very poor. It is very clear when the door next door opens at 6 o'clock, there are vibrations and sounds, and I sleep with earplugs.

Hygiene: Ok, everything is clean.

Service: The waiters at the door, check-in at the front desk, breakfast, and gym are all very good, and they all actively pay attention to the needs of customers. The only thing that can be improved is that none of the staff members encountered during the walk greeted the guests with a smile.

Environment: There is a shopping center next to it, so it is very convenient to eat. In Beijing, it is actually very inconvenient to take a taxi, and there are traffic jams. Eating next to it is very efficient and saves time. The location of the hotel is acceptable, and it is very convenient to go everywhere.

The second time I was received by Abby (Wu Lei) and her apprentice Xiao Wei. The second time It took more than a month before and after the first time and the second time, but I was recognized at a glance. I admire this memory 😄

During this stay, the hotel helped me upgrade to the VIP floor (18th floor). Abby also specially prepared an extra card for me because I was afraid that the magnetic card used for the elevator would sometimes be in poor contact. The little brother standing at the luggage storage area wanted to help me carry my luggage. I only have one, so I smiled and said no.

During my stay this time, I experienced the hotel's swimming pool and gym. The swimming pool is very large and clean, with good lighting. It is very suitable for taking pictures. I forgot to wear a swimming cap this time. The staff lent me one instead of saying that I would give it to you. I rushed out, and then there happened to be children taking swimming lessons. Everyone had their own way, without interfering with each other, and it was very quiet.

Not to mention the gym. There was no one there when I went, so it was very comfortable to use. There are a lot of equipment in the hotel.

The breakfast is a little expensive, but you get what you pay for. Anyway, I personally think that there are many options for eating. There are many kinds of Chinese and Western food, fruits, and drinks. My favorite is actually multigrain cakes, fried dumplings, and pumpkin cakes are also good. If you are self-disciplined, there are also very healthy choices, such as steamed yam, steamed purple sweet potato, steamed pumpkin, etc.

In addition, the first time I went to the reception boy at the door, he led me to a seat, and then poured coffee for me.

The service in the beverage area next to the front desk in the lobby is also good. I brought a computer to work this time, and the young lady over there would touch my teapot from time to time to see if the water in the teapot was cold.

The aunt who cleaned the room at the end knew that I had to take a shower sooner or later, so she would give me a few more bath towels every time.

This stay is completely experienced from another angle, the service is in place, and it is very humane.

msg:This is a one-night stay, big bed on the 17th floor, no noise, because it is a Ctrip user, the hotel will give preferential trea**ent. Although the price of Ctrip is high, it is recommended to book with Ctrip regardless of the price. Advantages of the hotel: The hotel is located between the second and third ring roads The transportation is convenient, easy to take a taxi, the hotel guests have discounts for buffet dinner, and the price is high. The swimming pool is very clean, and there is a small bubble pool next to it, which is warmer and more convenient for children to play. There is a separate passage into the swimming pool, which is very friendly for mothers who bring their sons alone.
Disadvantages: The hotel is quite old, the lower floor is next to the shopping mall restaurant and swimming pool, and the noise is relatively loud. There is a man at the breakfast table with an indifferent face all the way. Because the elderly are not used to Western food, they asked for extra wontons and they made fun of them, which made people very uncomfortable , The hotel should strengthen the management of the noodle cooking area. The doorman at the door of the hotel has no sense of service, does not pull the car door or help with luggage

After staying at Crowne Plaza U-Town again after two years, Mandy from the very happy restaurant can recognize us. Her service made us feel very kind. We look forward to seeing you next time.

msg:This week, my child’s school just held a sports meeting and a spring outing, plus a day off for the Qingming Festival. I thought that I would not miss the class, so I asked for leave and went to Beijing to clock in. The purpose of clocking in is mainly to pave the way for the child's forthcoming fourth-grade Chinese and to expand his horizons. The child has not gone anywhere for three years during the epidemic, which can be regarded as compensation. Regarding hotel reservations, we also repeatedly deleted and selected, and finally chose Crowne Plaza U-Town. Three reasons: First, the location is suitable, the central urban area, not far from Wangfujing, the Forbidden City, Sanlitun, Prince Gong's Mansion, Nanluoguxiang, Qianmen Street, etc. It is also at the node of the airport expressway. It is very convenient to go anywhere. The second is that the service and decoration are not bad according to the reviews; the third is that it is next to the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U-Tang Shopping Center, high-end office buildings, etc. The overall environmental quality of the area is good, and the quality of shopping and restaurants of various brands can be guaranteed. The most surprising thing is the service attitude. During the few days when the little sister Shen Yuru from the hotel restaurant depar**ent lived in our hotel, she provided thoughtful service every breakfast time and took the initiative to provide information on travel routes, weather, transportation and so on. Especially the weather forecast for the Great Wall reminds us to bring more thick clothes. We thought that the sun was shining brightly in the urban area of Beijing, and the temperature should be in the 10s, so there shouldn’t be much difference. But when we arrived at the scene, her judgment was fully fulfilled: it was windy and cold. We regretted that we didn’t bring enough clothes (we brought so many beautiful down jackets and windbreakers and put them all in the hotel, and we bought simple cold-proof clothes for a family of three on the spot). Thanks again to Sister Shen Yuru for her concern, which also made us feel the management level and sincerity of the hotel. As I live in hotels on business trips, the price/performance ratio of this hotel should be very high among hotels of the same level in Beijing. By the way, the swimming pool also surprised me, the water quality is top-notch and the management is orderly. The main attractions of this trip to Beijing are full of people. All kinds of queuing and rushing make people feel regretful. On the contrary, the Crowne Plaza U-Town Hotel is the right choice, which makes our family still full of memories of this trip to Beijing. Happiness and joy!

msg:The check-in experience was very, very bad. All the rooms I changed were "problem rooms": the noise was loud (I changed rooms multiple times: in 3 rooms, my ears were buzzing as soon as I entered the room). There are many connecting rooms (connected to the adjacent room through a locked door, which makes the room noisy). Spliced ​​beds (the middle bed is directly raised).

1. I have stayed in this hotel for no less than 20 nights in 3 years. I did not register for "connecting rooms" but I was still given a connecting room when I checked in on Thursday.

2. When I asked to change rooms, I was told that there were no rooms. During the period, I was arranged to see two other rooms: one with very loud noise (the window is facing several super large fans in the building next door), and one with a spliced ​​bed (you can clearly see the protrusion in the middle of the bed). ).

2. On the night of check-in, because of the connecting rooms, the sound insulation effect was not good, which greatly affected my sleep. It rained the next night: the window faced a flat glass of more than 200 square meters (the roof of the building next door). The sound of rain hitting the glass all night made it impossible to sleep at all.

3. Later, I asked to change rooms: I was assigned the highest floor, but still faced the building fan. As soon as I entered the room, there was a buzzing sound in my ears.

Originally booked for 4 nights, I checked in for the first two nights and checked out 5 rooms with my suitcases, all with the above problems. I don’t understand that I didn’t have the above-mentioned problems in my previous stays more than 20 times. This time, the hotel staff changed the rooms with the above-mentioned problems again and again. Do these “problem rooms” account for such a high proportion in your hotel?

Went to the pool for a swim, there was **** in a small pool! The waiters filled the pool and asked who ****ted. We brought our children and even asked us who ****ted. I didn’t complain to you when I saw the pool was dirty!
I'm really speechless!
The decoration of the hotel is very old, the room is very small, checkin waited for half an hour, only one waiter was checking in, checking out and extending the stay at the same time, everyone else was in the same room and didn't know what to do! Never stay in a hotel again!

The swimming pool on the 6th floor has good lighting and views. The children had a great time playing. The hardware conditions are commendable. However, the service staff and other software are a bit stretched. First of all, the registration at the front desk. The room I booked includes the executive floor trea**ent At the same time, the check-out time is until 16 o'clock the next day. The room card at the front desk did not add the attribute of executive floor to me, so I couldn't go to the 20th floor for afternoon tea. The room card couldn't open the door at 12 o'clock the next day. , and then the welcome fruit from the restaurant was delivered at 22:20. We were all asleep at that time. Fortunately, the child was not woken up. Next came the tall lifeguards in the swimming pool. Our child is 3 years old and just Xiashui yelled a few times happily. At 2 o’clock in the afternoon, there were only 4 guests in the venue. He immediately blamed my wife with a dark face and told my children to stop barking. His attitude was very bad. Don’t say that he was concerned about our safety, okay? Let's tell the difference! Then he kept looking at us very unhappy. Finally, there is the alarm clock in the guest room. I read the comments that the alarm clock in the room would ring in the middle of the night. I unplugged it on purpose. I didn’t expect it to ring at 5:00 am and 7:00 am. This experience is too bad. I knocked on the door at night and the alarm clock rang in the early morning. Made us dizzy in the morning. The hotel is good.

According to Ctrip's order, there are 6 free bottles of minibar drinks in the room except Evian and sparkling water.
In addition, there are two breakfasts, two afternoon tea, and two executive lounge benefits.
The taste is very good.
In addition, Rebacca Zhao, the lady at the front desk, has a very good attitude and service, and she is very gentle and comfortable just looking at it.

I like the gym and swimming pool the most. The gym is clean and tidy, and the temperature of the swimming pool is just right. I don’t know if it’s because of the Spring Festival or the cold winter (the nighttime temperature is minus 14-15° these days), and the swimming pool temperature has been raised? All in all very comfortable. Especially the opening hours are longer 👍.

The one I chose in the end did not disappoint me, it is very cost-effective! The location is good, the first floor is directly connected to the shopping mall, it is very convenient for shopping, and there is free parking! The family room I booked, the kids like it very much, and they can also enjoy the executive trea**ent with the double breakfast. The room is super big, luxurious and warm, and it is comfortable to lie down anywhere. The hotel's swimming pool and gym are both good. We didn't miss out on bathing or exercising. In particular, I would like to emphasize that the front desk manager Mr. Sheng's service is excellent, and he quickly resolved a few temporary requests. His attitude is super good! Come here again next time!

There is only one thing that is really unpleasant. I am writing this review at home now: because it is a temporary need to order a single-twin room on Ctrip, the orders and WeChat received are all "twin rooms". But when I got to the hotel, Ms. Zhao, who was checking in at the front desk, emphasized twice that I booked a "big bed room". I had to show her my mobile phone. She emphasized that Ctrip sent the wrong order? ! We entered the hotel at 5:10 and left at 9:30 today. We just needed a place to rest. We gave up "early check-in", "late check-out" and "welcome fruit". Look, just ask for "quiet"... The big joke appeared: when I walked into room 916, the conversation between the two was almost inaudible. I wanted to make do with one night, but outside there was a large gathering of range hoods in various restaurants, too Terrible... Came to the front desk to find Ms. Zhao and immediately changed to 933. It was extremely quiet, and the "China Zun" in the distance was clearly visible. But even now, I'm still very uncomfortable: because of health and time, we didn't even order breakfast, we just wanted to find a quiet room to rest for the night, and I really didn't understand Ms. Zhao's actions. In addition, all rooms with ×16 should be refused to stay, not for the scenery, but not for the noise. I hope the hotel will not arrange guests to stay in x16 if the room is not full, it will really affect the mood of the guests and the reputation of the hotel. I am a hotel controller, whether at home or abroad, or on the beach, from Abu Dhabi to Las Vegas, from Tokyo to Seoul, from Bali to Langkawi, from Hong Kong to Macau... I will always choose the hotel I like to stay in. , room type upgrade, airport pick-up, executive lounge, happy hour... I have experienced it all, but I didn't expect a choice that I thought could not be wrong to appear in Beijing... I don't mean to criticize anyone, I just hope to consider it from the perspective of the guests.

Service: The staff service is very good. Originally, the hotel can only be checked in at 2:00 in the afternoon. Call to ask if it can be 2 hours in advance. After coordination at the front desk, it is confirmed , a great experience; while waiting for check-in, I waited in the lobby bar for a while. Lily, the manager of the lobby bar, after I showed her that she was waiting for her husband to check in, she warmly introduced me to their hotel and hotel. The desserts and afternoon tea in the lobby bar are very thoughtful and in place; the staff saw that it was her husband's birthday, so they were very nice and sent a cake, which was delicious! !
Catering: The environment of the lobby bar is good. There were not many people in the afternoon. We found a corner to sit down. The seats are wrapped and designed, so people can hide in it comfortably, drink afternoon tea, eat the hotel cake, and feel like a vacation It came all at once; for dinner at C6 restaurant, seasonal hairy crabs are available in limited quantities, one per person, and the dishes are rich. What impressed me that day was the small hot pot with yellow and spicy diced, and the fish was very fresh; there were also grilled skewers, marinated Boiled, salmon, etc., and finally finished with a Baxi ice cream, it feels like the buffet has more variety this season, and it's better than when I came last winter.
Summary: This time I came to stay at the hotel under the brand of Crowne Plaza. Compared with other hotels, it is still the most cost-effective hotel. When I leave, the front desk will ask the license plate number intimately, so it is convenient to go directly out of the ba*****t~

Because of the large floor-to-ceiling windows, the swimming pool looks very bright and bright. There are not many people, and many of them take their children to learn to swim.

I booked three rooms and checked in during the Chinese New Year. When I arrived at 12:40 noon, I was told that there was no room, and it was cleaned at about two o'clock. I accepted it. Only one room was cleaned at two o'clock, and it was accepted. When I came back at 8:30 in the evening, I asked if it was not ready yet. I had to check the status of the room. Finally, at 9:30, the other two rooms were confirmed. One of them was supposed to be upgraded for us, but in fact it was probably ours. The room was already checked in by someone else.
One of the rooms was not cleaned the next day, saying it was a "contactless service" and it was not cleaned during the stay. But first of all, the front desk didn't inform you, and secondly, you didn't even enter the door, didn't change the bath towels, and didn't add water. Is this called contactless service? In the end, I couldn't make it any longer, and told us that we didn't have enough manpower to clean it up. But what does your lack of manpower have to do with our residents? Did we not pay?
The weirdest thing happened. The parents lived in a room. When they checked out, they said that they had consumed 5 bottles of carbonated drinks, and checked with their family repeatedly that they did not drink. A so-called duty manager at the front desk said, well, I'll waive it for you. Please, it's not inevitable, it's not consumption at all. You don't have the room service you should have, it's kind of a tough thing to do.
After feedback to Ctrip, Ctrip's handling is still very good. When checking out, a manager came to explain and apologize, which was a bit of a relief.
In short, don’t try to be cheap, you get what you pay for, but it’s the first time I’ve seen such a poor crown. Beijing has taught me a lot.

🚗 Transportation: The transportation is convenient, the subway is very convenient, and self-driving is also good. The key point is free parking. If the hotel hadn’t paid the parking fee, I would have been reluctant to drive, after all, it was only 200 yuan.

🧹Hygiene: Good
🍃Environment: Standard business hotel style, comfortable. Direct access to U-Tang shopping mall, this is really great!

🔔Service: In place and timely response, the room staff are conscientious and provide services in a timely and effective manner. Manager Cao Honglei gave timely response and support.

The service of the hotel must be said to be of first-class international standard, and it must be praised with a full score of 100! There was a delay in the Ctrip order during the renewal process. The front desk received Wang Qian Black and gave up the enthusiastic handling of the meal time. He was very careful and patient, without any emotion, I must like it! Especially the manager Cao Honglei, who also used his personal expertise to help solve other problems in the process of staying at the hotel. He is very friendly and can think of ways from our standpoint to truly treat the guests as friends! It is rare for a team that can provide such a service to travel and live in a hotel for so many years! Invaluable! Second to none! Follow-up hotel is undoubtedly the first choice! The breakfast meals are fresh and varied, completely matching the grade of the hotel!

The service of the hotel is still of first-class international standard and must be praised out of 100. The swimming pool and gym facilities are good, but the hotel is due to the time. The reason for the long time is that the facilities are a bit old and not user-friendly, but the rooms in the public areas of the hotel are still clean and tidy. It would be perfect if the hotel air-conditioning system added a little fragrance. The only disadvantage is that the hotel is a bit petty. This is the first time that I have to pay for a phone call in the room, although it is not a lot of money, but the experience is not good enough. After experiencing the hotel's morning and evening buffet, the taste can only be said to be average, and there is no beer? ? ? But I am still satisfied with a score of 90, and I will choose Crowne Plaza U-Tang for my next stay.

The breakfast is also rich, the pancakes are delicious, and the fried dough sticks are almost meaningless. The buffet on the fourth night of the fourth day was really crowded. When we got to the queue, it was already more than seven o'clock. Although the front desk of the restaurant registered the phone number, it did not take the initiative to call. When we arrived, there was nothing left, not to mention shellfish and hairy crabs, and even the shrimp heads were gone.
Basically do not ask the supervisor to complain and do not bring food, which is really not in line with the price. Be sure to line up early next time you come!

Originally, there were a lot of things to do on this business trip, but the experience here is very good, especially the manager Cao Honglei helped me to renew my stay. I have many questions. Help me explain one by one, solved! She is really very patient, I am very moved, and Miss Li Mingyue, the supervisor of the front desk, is also very friendly, very gentle and meticulous! I will highly recommend my colleagues and relatives to live here when they come to Beijing in the future. The overall experience is great!

It is very convenient next to U-Tang Shopping Mall, and parking is free. The room is also very clean. Focus on it! My husband celebrated his birthday that day. In fact, we didn't mention it, but the hotel is really very thoughtful and considerate.

After checking in, I went to the room and swiped my card to enter, but found that there was someone in the room. But the people in the room didn't know that I entered the room, and then I arrived at the front desk and changed the room with suppressed anger. Although the room was upgraded, it was still not very rational.
If the safety of each guest is not guaranteed, or if conflicts or contradictions are caused by such behavior, whether the hotel can take responsibility.
Or think, if I'm a drunk and swipe into someone else's room, what kind of conflict it would cause if the room was a woman.
If I was lying in bed and someone entered the room in the middle of the night, I don't know how to react without knowing it.
The hotel should be responsible for the safety and privacy of all guests.
Take it as a warning, as a five-star hotel, it is the foundation.

Now it is said that because there is still one room that is booked because of the guarantee, it cannot be cancelled. You need to deduct it from the pre-authorization. Then, please, why don't you explain when you check in, and there is no notice from anyone within 2 days of check-in. At the time of settlement, you didn't say that you should deduct the third room rate that was not opened. Now through the after-effects of the way of forced deduction, yes, in the legal agreement is no problem, then ask the customer first, for the customer's purpose embodies in where? Many other hotels can meet such conditions. If you have discretionary trea**ent or you have to pay in advance when you check in, we would rather be empty and you can open the room.

繼續表揚Abby Wu，提前幫我安排了房間打掃，當天10點就打掃完畢，可以安排入住了。另外，酒店默認下午2點退房，也很好評。

説兩個小建議，也是希望酒店可以持續保持水準。第一是枕頭有點軟和矮，睡得不是很舒服。第二是，酒店還是要加強衞生，桌面上杯子的印記比較明顯，寫字枱用消毒紙巾擦拭，都是黑的……淋浴間牆壁、地面打濕之後，也有點黏糊糊……

但是前台超級冷漠，我告訴前台幫我打掃衞生，下午回到房間發現並沒有打掃，然後我們第二次告訴前台請打掃衞生，然後全家人出來等着，過了半小時老公上去拿東西發現還是沒有打掃。於是我抱着孩子走到前台，請他通知幫我打掃衞生，前台繼續敷衍，説已經通知，我説我在這裏等到你確定有人去打掃我再離開。這時候前台才開始緊張，等了好幾分鐘才收到迴應説此時已經去打掃了。並且我早上告訴前台打掃衞生不需要換床品，結果下午打掃的時候還是給我換了床品。

就是這樣吧，總體來説還是挺好的主要是位置方便。

本來訂的雙床，到了前台能給換個大床的嘛？確認了一下馬上給換了，入住後到了房間温度適宜也沒開空調，要求的事過一會就會有人解決對應。但這次入住沒給水果，之前都有，是不是我這次預訂的就沒有呀，吹風機壞了沒有熱風，其他的都不錯。

msg:酒店地理位置非常好，就在外交部旁邊。酒店可以直接連接到旁邊的悠唐商場，吃東西買東西都是方便的！
先説説整個酒店的感受，雖然並不是新開的酒店，但整體衞生情況還是滿意的，夠得上五星級標準。
在四天的商務行程中，有幾個可圈可點的地方：1. 6層早餐餐廳經理Mandy張蕾，服務周到熱情，給安排了特殊的早餐，也推薦了據説是餐廳特色的肉夾饃，我試了一下還真是不錯；另外一個細節是，餐廳的工作人員因為看到我每天早上都喝美式，所以後來看到我，就主動幫我打了一杯熱美式，等我取完餐回來就已經擺在桌子上了。2. 前台辦理check in/out的帥哥楊子墨，語氣柔和説話聲音清晰，且業務熟悉反應快. 雖然早上辦理退房有點開票的小插曲，但是還是及時給出瞭解決方案，幫忙把發票快遞了。
這是家可以後續一直考慮的酒店，非常推薦！

在繁瑣且複雜的酒店前台工作中，我看到了該酒店員工處理事情的有條不穩與服務的細緻入微、積極主動，是差旅在北京的不二選擇。

1 酒店部分房間是與旁邊房間聯通的，中間隔着一個房門。酒店對此的解釋是有的家庭同時預訂兩個相鄰的房間，他們就會把門打開。撇開安全問題，隔音效果相當於有人站在房間門口説話。這樣的設計感覺相當不妥，建議提前確定是否這樣的房間。
2 退房時發現遺漏東西，問客房服務，堅持説沒有，最後找了經理，才發現是清潔阿姨拿了。

去健身房還沒進去他們就沖出來琢麼着扣你錢了。
除了有個浴缸其他的我評價甚至不如全季，比亞朵差遠了。
