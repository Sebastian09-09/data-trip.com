msg:The hotel has a first-class view and the service is also very good. The butler service is very enthusiastic and the taste of the dishes is adjusted according to our taste and a dish is given as a gift. The service is impeccable. Although the hardware of the guest room has some minor flaws, the flaws are not enough to conceal the merits. Compared with competing hotels, it lacks a swimming pool. In short, it is still a very good hotel. I wish your business is prosperous.

Because I brought the elderly to stay, they also helped to deliver the meals to the room so that the elderly don't have to climb up and down the stairs. Thank you very much. The beautiful scenery of the hotel is a major feature. You can see the Baling River Bridge and the Dishuitan Waterfall from the rooftop at the same time. A small drawback is that the sealing of the bathroom seems not very good. After taking a shower, I found that there was a flood outside 😅

After returning from the bustling scenic area to the hotel hidden in the mountains, the fatigue of the day is instantly eliminated. A large bed and a small bed perfectly solve the trouble of booking a room when traveling with older children. The quantity and exquisiteness of the breakfast are unexpected. The nearby Dishuitan Waterfall is completely comparable to the waterfall in the Huangguoshu Scenic Area, and it is more wild.

I like the big bathtub. You can see the sea of ​​clouds, mountains and waterfalls while lying in the bathtub. The breakfast is a surprise. It is nutritious. The bacon is really tender and delicious. Even the small sausage is juicy. The most regrettable thing is that we didn't order dinner. Their dinner needs to be booked one day in advance. We booked it a little later and it was gone. It's a pity. The only drawback is that parking is not very convenient, but fortunately there are waiters to help with parking. This hotel gives people a peaceful feeling. You need to change into slippers when you enter the door. The whole hotel is clean. Even the waiter's tone of voice is like the clouds in the mountains, very soothing and peaceful.

msg:The characteristic of this B&B is that the rooftop terrace is very photogenic. The view is wide. The parent-child room I booked is not big in size and is equipped with L'Occitane supplies. The laundry service is very practical, and the housekeeper is very friendly. The dining level is good, but the price is not low. One disadvantage is that the toilet flushes loudly, which will be a bit noisy if you get up early in the morning. The B&B is located in a small village on the mountain, so parking is not very convenient. You have to park in a parking lot at the entrance of the village, but fortunately it is not far away. The firewood chicken in Huangguoshu Tourist Town, not far from Li Hotel, is good.

msg:Very nice boutique hotel.
    It was dark when we arrived around seven or eight. Turning around a very narrow road to find the hotel, after getting off the car and entering the door, I found that there is only one table at the front desk. However, the little brother at the front desk still led us to take off all our shoes with a sense of ritual, put on the slippers from the store, and let us sit at the table next to us and drink tea for a while. The children have found "Guizhou Treasure Hunt" on the bookshelf, Read it like a treasure.
     At this time, two people suddenly appeared, stopped the little brother and said that his drone had fallen on the mountain, and wanted to borrow a flashlight to find it. The little brother looked at the shoes of the two people in surprise, and asked them calmly if they were hotel guests, of course not. The little brother asked a little depressedly, how did you get in? The two said that they had just walked in. After the little brother hurriedly sent the two away, he quickly closed the door to make up for it.
    Closer to home, there is a bridge and a canyon outside the room. The bridge feels no worse than the "Sky Bridge" next to Tianyan, and you can see a wild waterfall in the distance. If you have time, you can stay for a day. The breakfast is small and varied, and it is carefully matched. The water platform on the roof is suitable for taking pictures. It is best to wear a wide robe and big sleeves, and stage "I want to go home with the wind".

I already knew this place was not good at that time. I am on the 24th day of my trip, and I change hotels almost every day or every two days. You can count how many hotels I have stayed in. It's really the first time I've seen this happen.
Okay, I'll pay you 80 yuan, and you'll give me one with a strong smoking smell. If I say it's very smelly, you can say that it is estimated that the previous guests were smoking inside, so just open the door and blow it. You look at your price for one night and then you look at your service and you think there is no problem?
I asked for a room change, but fortunately you agreed.
I'll take the kids to where your kids play on the 3rd floor. Really disgusting and dirty.
I can't understand why I'm so embarrassed to charge so much for one night, and I don't see any toothbrush for children.
For a good place is the scenery is good.
There are so many hotels nearby, it is recommended to check out others.

I washed away the fatigue of the journey first, which made people feel very warm. People warmed up a bit again, which was really surprising. When the feet were soaked, the ladies completed the formalities and sent the luggage to the room. This wave of operations is better than that of a five-star hotel. The breakfast is divided into Chinese and Western styles. You can eat enough if you order it yourself. Dinner is a set meal that needs to be ordered in advance. The price of 298 is a bit expensive, and it is mainly Western. The scenery of the hotel is unparalleled. You can see a large suspension bridge in the hotel, especially from the observation deck, the scenery is very good. It is a place for Internet celebrities to check in. All in all, a very full trip! Highly recommended! ! !

但服務拉胯，完全沒有達到這個價位該有的水準。
舉例如下：
1. 房間遮簾是壞的，拉不下來，跟工作人員反饋，迴應大意就是，它確實壞了，你們忍忍吧，反正窗簾是好的
2. 洗手池水很難下去，是堵的；浴缸的漏水塞卻封不嚴，泡個澡一直在漏水，一邊泡一邊就漏完了
3. 晚上11點房間裏水喝完了，（房間裏就衹放了兩小瓶360ml的），打電話給前台，沒人接，是我們自己出去找水
4. 早餐在餐廳，落座好幾分鐘，旁邊站着的服務員一直沒主動過來詢問，我們主動開口，服務員才過來
5. 用餐時，服務員和後廚一直在我們背後的廚房大聲交談。想要杯咖啡，喊服務員沒人理。衹能走過去問，發現他們在廚房集體用餐…所以早上9點半，工作人員是跟客人一個時間用早餐的嗎…

綜上就是，為這個漂亮的酒店感到可惜。酒店的服務理念和認知水平不夠，這裏的服務員也需要集體培訓一下。
住過很多五星酒店，價位還比這裏低，純粹為環境而來，實在不值這個價錢。很多時候服務都在細節處，但這裏還遠沒有達到應有的水準。

民宿離黃果樹大概15分鐘車程，出來進去都需要開車，附近衹有一家飯館兒。如果不是自駕遊客，可以請民宿的人幫忙安排來回的車。
民宿本事還是很好的，房間都是複式房，落地大窗，四層的露台風景無敵，而且非常安靜。酒店服務人員親切友好。
黃果樹周圍要麼就是巨貴的柏聯，旺季要六千一晚，要麼就是老舊的賓館或者小旅店，這家算價位中等位置也尚可的選擇，呆在民宿裏就很舒服了。
附近還有一家匠廬，比他家位置低一些，看着也可以。

msg:前段時間，趁着對文凡狀元別院的認可和好感，在青巖小住還沒離店退房就毅然決然提前兩週預訂了黃果樹文凡嶠山酒店，期待又一個如青巖文凡難忘之行的盡興而歸。

昨天，日子一到就朝着壩陵河谷蠻寨村的嶠山文凡酒店一路車行，到達目的地附近後因為現場精確位置指示不明致電前台，希望來人引導一下。不一會，酒店一個帥哥管家很快出現，熱情的招呼引導我賓至如歸。

管家專業熱情的幫我倒車調頭入位停妥。進入期待已久的酒店，我直接跳過店家熱情標配的沐足換鞋流程，一看店內環境和室外村寨大環境反差巨大卻不違和，反而温馨現代簡約，擁有一覽壩陵河大橋全景的絕佳視野就急不可耐，管家奉上的迎賓茶、代客入住辦理手續，和青巖文凡狀元別院一樣甘甜、快捷。

隨後帥哥管家家人般的引領我去客房，並送上酒店準備的聖誕禮物，又請我看看全落地的玻璃窗景觀視角滿不滿意。因為對客房觀景視野中央有棵樹不太滿意，管家於是熱情的幫我換了一個同類型視野更好的房間。

安頓下來，第一印象客房各方面設施設備和青巖文凡狀元別院相比不差，甚至還更好更齊備一點，比如JBL藍牙音箱，但是青巖和黃果樹文凡都沒有體重秤。稍事休息就立即店內環境到處逛逛，在大堂咖啡曲奇喝紅茶左看右看壩陵河大橋，觀景天台拍照一番，放飛心情，感覺大好。

華燈初上，行程重頭戲晚餐登場：開胃湯、精美位上菜、紅酒飲料、餐後甜點…一一全部光盤，甚至熗炒青菜都ONE MORE。
整個出品，美味精緻量夠，佳餚佐以文凡智利紅酒，餐盤的熱度和位上每道菜的温度恰到好處。
至此，上半場的入住劇情和諧如預期完美達到高潮。

……


愉快的時光總是過得好快～～～


夜幕降臨寒風起，一身疲憊，洗漱準備停當，枕着蠻寨村的河谷美景入眠尋夢周公，盤算着天明在蠻寨村清脆的鳥鳴中睡到自然醒。誰知剛入睡一個多小時即被單頻無敵噪音攪了黃粱美夢，歷經逾半個多時辰複式房上竄下跳五次三番各種推斷一番排查，最終篤定是空調噪音不期而遇半夜襲擾，無助之際擬致電一鍵服務熱線求助管家出手相助以求安眠，無奈長時間鈴響、線通就是無人接聽。

於是，下半場的入住劇情——

陡然反轉心如貓抓，輾轉反側不得安眠，好不容易熬到快早上七點天色慾亮，一夜睏意朦朧而不得睡的囫圇洗漱穿衣直奔大堂尋找值班管家投訴理論未果枯坐發呆，直到當值管家郭發志先生當班上崗開燈，我才有對象得以控訴徹夜不堪噪音騷擾無法安眠之煩悶，郭管家當即感同身受的對我好言慰藉並來到房間查看，確認元兇是空調無敵噪音後，又一番安慰，總算讓我一夜無助傾訴釋放，雖然我就要退房離店返程，心情終於還是好受了一點。

俗話説，民以食為天，咱們再聊聊今早文凡嶠山的早餐。和昨晚晚餐相比，早餐因為是預先製作好的再次加熱出品，雖然有中西兩款，但是都量少而顯得中式簡陋如同嚼蠟，西式混搭品質不佳。實話實説是不好吃又吃不飽、吃不好，和青巖文凡狀元別院的豐盛早餐更是不能比，希望黃果樹文凡店家再花點心思跟進管理、提升品質讓專程來蠻寨村曲徑通幽忙裡偷閒一覽壩陵河大橋美景尋訪小住的客人們日後回憶還能念念不忘、歷歷在目。


綜上所述此行，

一、值得肯定的是：
黃果樹文凡嶠山酒店的總體服務水準很好。比如代客泊車、餐飲服務，酒店的迎客（引導進房間、贈送時令節日禮品、牛奶薑茶贈飲）客房服務做得非常好，值得肯定。
客房客用備品的品質也很好。

二、真誠希望建議：
客房居住期間的服務還要加強，特別是關係客人旅行質量的主要細節：客房（複式客房空間高，冬天容易上熱下冷）室温是否持續舒適？每日檢查是否有影響睡眠休息的噪音等不利因素存在？客用備品客人夠不夠用？客房設備設施JBL藍牙音響有沒有簡明使用説明等等。

三、最煩人的事：
空調噪音太過影響睡眠，無法忍受，這絕對是此行最煞風景最掃興的硬傷。
設施評分2分，主要就是因為空調噪音攪得人無法安眠。

最後要特別感謝：
管家郭發志先生體貼入微、温馨專業的服務：高效快速的移車、幫忙提行李箱上車，還有臨別讓我感動的主人翁式真誠送行！

msg:來之前我一直認為文凡的服務是很好的，因為潮州文凡特別人性化，結果發現文凡嶠山的服務特別的死板，酒店小而美不就是更要個性化服務嗎？去黃果樹就是早上8點到9點，去滴水灘就是晚上5到7點，其餘無法用車。所以這次沒有租車真的很不方便。
我們真的希望這麼美的酒店能提高服務水平，多培訓員工，這裏的員工要不扎堆聊天，要不態度特別生硬。
去滴水灘瀑布孩子直接下水了，當天下雨很多泥，我們一直怕弄臟車裡，在想辦法，結果酒店員工直接説要不我們就得賠洗車費，這種説法真的讓人很不爽。
中午是簡餐，菜很小一碟，見圖，我們從黃果樹回來半大小子根本吃不飽，我們就説加點米飯，結果米飯也不能加。等待的時間也非常長。
晚餐是套餐，品種很多，但有些我們不吃，我覺得應該讓我們有所選擇，避免浪費，比如那麼大個香菇小孩不吃我們就不想上，結果酒店員工説你們不要我們也倒掉了，就真的很尷尬，很有負罪感。
另外，酒店大堂的書籍太老舊了，都是什麼《做個優秀女人》這種論斤賣的書，希望能提供一些高品質的書籍真的讓人沉下心來閲讀。
員工整體素質堪憂，真的需要好好培訓。很多對話態度就是特別生硬。要杯茶水，員工就説是自助的，自己去倒。很多可以有更好的方式解決。
不光我們隊其服務極不滿意，同行的也一直在抱怨。
我很少寫這麼多，不為差評，衹是希望改進，別浪費了這麼美的風景，白瞎了這麼好的酒店，酒店的餐具佈置設計用品都是很好的，非常有設計感。
作為文凡的粉絲真心希望能改進服務，提高員工素質，提供個性化服務，讓住店客人滿意。

msg:酒店很適合養心，窗外的風景就是房間最好的裝飾，餐食養生湯都很用心，衞生狀況也很好，我們的管家陳娟服務很細緻。一點小建議就是餐食可以體現貴州當地特色，當然現在的品質已經值回票價了。

msg:這次旅行最滿意的酒店，一價全包的模式太適合親子旅行了。酒店可以來回接送黃果樹和滴水灘。強烈推薦滴水灘，太棒了。酒店的景色也非常好，晚餐堪比米其林，大堂的曲奇餅乾很好吃。咖啡要是能加奶就更棒了。管家們也很熱情，還可以洗衣服並且烘乾。總體來説很滿意，要是隔音能好一點那就更完美了。

msg:黃果樹景區沒有必須去的理由，但這間酒店有。
洗塵足浴、晚安飲品，成本不會太高但也不是所有酒店都可以做到，值得一提的是酒店的晚餐，市價200元/位的話我是願意掏錢去吃的，何況是免費。
據説酒店選址花了3年時間，位置真的很棒
懸崖美景，遠眺壩陵河大橋和山水風光
各方面來講都值得這個價格

酒店本身沒有什麼娛樂設施，户外平台衹有一間茶室可以坐。這麼好的風光，不整個小酒吧可惜了。
感覺衹能自駕，不然出行太不方便。
服務中規中矩，能及時響應，衹是房間裏的服務電話打過兩次都沒人接聽。
