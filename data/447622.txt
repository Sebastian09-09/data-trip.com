The room is spacious and the service staff is very friendly, especially the waiter on the 17th floor, who is warm and thoughtful. The package I bought includes tickets to the scenic spot and a buffet dinner, which I really like. The front desk staff is very enthusiastic and recommends attractions for us. The hotel buffet is very rich and can meet the needs of different tastes, especially the rice noodles, noodles, and wontons are all freshly cooked and delicious. The hotel has its own swimming pool, which is open until 12 o'clock at night.

msg:The room is quite big, and the hygiene is so-so. In fact, the attitude of the service staff is quite good, but they can't do anything. Apart from being sorry, there is no practical measure. In general, it's like calling to complain to China Unicom and China Mobile. Apart from being sorry, there is nothing else. There are huge floor-to-ceiling windows, the temperature inside the room is 30 degrees, and there is no air conditioning! They said that the central air conditioning line was being repaired. They knew that repairing in the middle of the night would not affect traffic, and the air conditioning should be repaired during the hot day. Such a large floor-to-ceiling window, the glass is so dirty that you can hardly see the scenery outside. The wash basin in the bathroom can't be used at all. If you want to wash your face and hair, the faucet is directly blocked. Moreover, the wash basin is so high that you have to lift your feet to wash your face, and your clothes will be covered with water after washing. The hair dryer is so small that it seems to be used for cats. After blowing for a long time, the hair is still not dry. The hotel room number is very secretive, and the design is vaguely like a massage center. I don't know what the hotel thinks. It was a very bad stay experience.

The surrounding area is deserted and there is nothing. In fact, the front desk service attitude is quite good. It has nothing to do with the staff. It's just that the location of the hotel is too remote and the supporting facilities are not good. If a big hotel doesn't have air conditioning, why would you choose a hotel?

msg:At the end of the Spring Festival holiday, I wanted to take my children skiing⛷️, and stayed in this hotel. It can be said that the hotel facilities are perfect, the service is also very good, and I am very satisfied!
☞The area near the hotel is very open, not crowded, and there are plenty of parking spaces. The lobby is magnificent, clean and tidy. The guest rooms are also large, and the bathroom facilities are very comfortable. The room service is also very good, and the sanitation is clean.

☞The children's playground and the swimming pool are open from 12 noon to 12 midnight. The children's playground is suitable for babies, but my two princesses in elementary school also played in it for a long time. The only regret is that the water in the swimming pool is too cold, and the sauna in the locker room does not seem to be open. Last month, the indoor swimming pool of another five-star hotel was heated in winter, and the water temperature was higher, so swimming in winter was not a problem at all, and it was basically impossible to go into the water here.

☞The breakfast is pretty good, which is the breakfast standard of a 5-star hotel. There are also few people, and the service of the waiters is very good, and they are responsive.

I will come here again next time, and I recommend families with children to stay.

msg:I really didn't expect that as someone who has a lot of hotel experience, I hadn't discovered this treasure-level hotel before:
1: Real and special theme: The theme of a general hotel is to reflect the theme in the room. However, this hotel has a panoramic theme. When you take the elevator with colorful floors to the 18th floor, your children will be unable to move. When you walk through the carefully decorated corridor to enter the room, your children will not want to leave the room again. Thanks to Wang Lili, the room service, for introducing various theme rooms for us to visit.
2: Art and cultural a**osphere: This is a veritable art hotel, especially on the first and second floors, there are all kinds of artworks for viewing. In terms of cultural a**osphere, the books placed on the hotel reception floor (2nd floor) and the afternoon tea restaurant (21st floor) are all real books. We borrowed two books to read in the room. Here, I would like to thank Gao Yujie from the tea restaurant for her enthusiastic introduction. Many of the hotel's characteristics were told to us by her.
3: Foodie benefits: Whether it is breakfast or dinner, it is really delicious. Gao Yujie from the tea restaurant said that the hotel invited a former CCTV chef! Of course, the environment is also excellent. Chinese meals are served in carefully decorated private rooms, and there are real green plants on the breakfast table.
4: Five-star service: Whether it is the front desk, guest room, tea restaurant, Chinese restaurant, or breakfast restaurant, every waiter I met is enthusiastic and meticulous. Wang Lili, the guest room attendant, saw that our children were older, so she specially prepared adult slippers; the breakfast waiter also came over enthusiastically to ask about the needs, and everything made people feel at home.
5: Fans' benefits: Next to it is a film and television shooting and production base, and there is a chance to meet a star here!

This may be the time when I wrote the most code and pictures for the review. In short, it is highly recommended!

msg:Too average. The overall environment, service and all aspects are not worthy of this price.
First of all, the so-called theme room is transformed from the ordinary room of the old hotel. In fact, the theme room is only superficial and there is no innovation. It is nothing more than adding some stickers and children's products, etc.;
Secondly. The facilities of the hotel are very old. As mentioned above, it is transformed from the old hotel;
Furthermore, the hotel environment is too average. The surrounding places for eating are not recommended. It is better to take a taxi to Huairou City.
In terms of supporting facilities, for example, if you go to park late, there is basically no space.
In short, the experience is not good and I will not go there again.

I listened to the doorman and parked in the basement. The elevator in the basement does not allow direct access to the lobby, but there are signs in the elevator. Then when you go to the basement, there is I didn't know the doorman or the security guard, but I thought it was a newcomer who asked for a long time where the elevator in the lobby was and couldn't answer. Finally, the service staff of the restaurant told me. As a quasi-five-star hotel, there were many service staff during breakfast but there were no seats available. The bedding in the room was slightly damp. I hope Sheraton will be listed soon and its quality will be even better!

msg:The second time I stayed, the overall environment has not changed much. It is still a little deserted. This hotel is a bit strange. Let me share my feelings based on the reviews.

advantage:
1. The overall design of the hotel is very strong. It is adjacent to the Chinese film tourism shooting base and closely follows the "filmmaker" theme in the name of the hotel. It can be said that movie elements are scattered throughout the hotel, which is very avant-garde and fashionable. The suspended prototype deck in the lobby atrium is very It's innovative and the kids like it very much. There is a display screen on the floor of the hotel elevator that can change animations. It's the only one I've ever seen in a hotel.
2. The twin room in the room is 1.4 meters in size, which is the largest size I have ever seen, and there are rollers under the bed, making it easy to move. For families with two children who need to share beds, the combination of these two points is very friendly. Comfortable, a big thumbs up here.
3. As mentioned above, the interior of the room has a strong sense of design. One is the space design. All clothes and luggage storage are built into the bathroom, making the whole house look neat and tidy. The other is the facility design, including the washbasin and the TV wall in the bedroom. On one side, black iron pipes are used to build a modular frame, and are embellished with movie searchlight elements. The style is unique and full of texture. The suspended glass desk can accommodate the largest suitcases to be unpacked; the large shower head has abundant water and is comfortable.
4. The room you stay in has a wide view, facing the "Chinese Film Tourism Shooting Base". You can see the antique streets and studios arranged according to serial numbers in the base. I don't know if they are open now. I went there a few years ago and it is still worth a visit. .
5. The hotel's swimming pool is 20 meters * 7.5, which is large enough, and there were not many people on the day of check-in.
6. The breakfast is unexpectedly good. The reservation order includes two breakfasts. There is no obstacle to entering with two children. The restaurant is not too big, the environment is elegant, the categories are relatively complete, the taste is good, and the small copper pot for cooking is also very good. The design is great, and the staff are very kind. Even though there are not many customers, our table feels like a VIP. In addition, the coffee machine provides disposable coffee cups, which can be used to make coffee and take it away, which is very user-friendly.

insufficient:
1. It is relatively deserted, and correspondingly there is insufficient preparation for some aspects. When I checked in, I had a meeting, and there was only one front desk to handle it, so I had to wait in a long queue;
2. Many facilities in the hotel are semi-closed, such as the lobby bar, fitness center, billiard room, etc. There was a small parent-child venue during the last stay that was not open this time, but it is still related to the passenger flow;
3. The parking lot in the basement is not large (there is basically a place for this passenger flow), and the guidance to the hotel is not clear enough. The road from the parking lot to the lobby is relatively long and requires an elevator transfer.
4. Breakfast was eaten after nine o'clock, and some dishes were a bit cold.
5. The geographical location is average. It is more than half an hour's drive from some important scenic spots in Huairou. There are few supporting businesses in the surrounding area. I personally feel that this greatly affects the passenger flow. In addition, the development of the "Chinese Film Tourism Shooting Base" is also crucial to the development of the hotel.
6. The positioning of the hotel is a bit vague. Is it for business or for families? Feeling unclear

To sum up, in terms of stay experience, it is very cost-effective, especially friendly to families with two children, and the price is relatively stable during the holidays. Personally, I suggest that it is not suitable to just stay in a hotel for a family trip. It is a better choice to stay here to rest after visiting other attractions in Huairou on Saturday.

The hotel is themed after a movie, and the iconic signs are several sculptures in the photo. They are very interesting. My daughter had to go and see them again before going to bed!
The hotel environment is good and the service is also very good. You don't have to worry about these two points when checking in.
The only thing I want to say is the breakfast bar. I feel that it is not very well prepared. Many items are gone at 9:30, such as tofu puffs, and the meal is closed at 10 o'clock and will no longer be provided. This is not suitable for such a big hotel. What a hotel!
All in all, it is still a very good hotel experience!

msg:First of all, it is certain that the hotel still has some characteristics. Some of the decorations inside are very movie-style, and the artistic a**osphere is still there. But the disadvantages are more prominent. 1. The hotel's pillows and quilts are of poor hygiene. Two pillows exude a strong smell of sweat. The smell is disgusting, and so are the quilts. The child said that the quilt was smelly, so he had to turn off the air conditioner and cover himself with a towel to sleep all night. 2. The food in the hotel is average. We had two meals in the hotel. There were not many varieties of breakfast. The fried vegetables were not very fresh, and the hot dishes only had a few green vegetables. I ordered a bowl of wontons that were not cooked yet, and I was speechless. Yes, the food in the Chinese restaurant is quite satisfactory. There are four dishes in the set meal. The braised pork is all fatty, sweet and greasy. The tofu dish is also not delicious. It is tasteless inside and cannot be chewed outside. The desserts ordered are also average. The plates were dirty and had water stains and fingerprints on them. It is very different from the star standard. 3. The hotel facilities are old and the room is quite spacious, but the glass is dirty and full of bird droppings, and the water flow in the washbasin is very small. We picked up some luggage, but there was no concierge or waiter in the hotel to ask if we needed help. When we entered, there was a person who looked like a staff member holding a cigarette and scanning the QR code at the door. After all, the hotel service needs to keep up. Parking at the hotel is convenient because there are not many people on weekdays. I originally wanted to experience the hotel where celebrities stayed before the film festival, but I didn't want to feel so bad. I won't choose it again in the future. It's not very suitable for family travel.

The temperature of the swimming pool is very good and it is not cold for children to swim in. Table tennis is reasonably priced. The dinner buffet is relatively low, the worst among the hotels I have ever eaten in. There is not much to eat. The disadvantage is that there are not many attractions and things to do around, so it would be boring to bring children.

The hotel bed is so comfortable that you don’t want to get up once you get stuck in it. The breakfast is good, there are pancakes, and the fruity yogurt is delicious. The hotel also has a gym and swimming pool. The disadvantage is that the soundproofing of the rooms is not very good and there are not many TV programs.

msg:The doorman at the lobby door yesterday afternoon was smart, disrespectful to customers, and had no sense of service at all. I think I am smart and treat my customers like a thief. The child's nucleic acid test results did not come out, so we decided to wait until the results came out before letting the child enter the hotel. Then my wife and I told him to park the car in the basement. As a result, the janitor's performance came next. The janitor moved to the entrance of the basement and was waiting for us with a weird smile. We didn't even react, but later we realized that they were afraid that we would bring our children in from the basement, and they told other gatekeepers to be careful of us. Is this the quality of a hotel service staff? Speculation doubts customers. Simply? ! What is this attitude?

The epidemic has just opened. There is nothing for breakfast in the hotel, and many dishes are not available in the Chinese restaurant. It is quite satisfactory and relatively quiet. There is a classic car museum nearby, which you can take your children to see. There is nothing else to do, and it is half a mile away from the Yanxi Lake Scenic Area. It's an hour away. The room is relatively big and the bed is a big hole. It needs to be improved.

For dinner, we ordered food at the Chinese restaurant. The stir-fried double flower was a bit salty. We tried the three-cup chicken that was well received. It was really good👍The cost is considered affordable in a star-rated hotel like this. What I want to say the most is that the room is too cold in winter. It's hot, half-sleeves are just right. The quilt covers the heat but not the cold. I hope your hotel can properly control the air conditioning in winter. The overall feeling is good, there are not many people, and it is very quiet. We actually reserved the area when we were swimming🌝, entertainment facilities Hope to add more!

It's more than 20 minutes' drive from Yanqi Lake, which is acceptable. The hotel facilities are pretty good and relatively modern. The room has a newly renovated smell, but it is covered with incense. The hotel does not have its own garden, so there is no place to go shopping, and it is not suitable for parents and children. The breakfast is good. There are not many people there before eight o'clock. There is a children's meal area, mostly snacks.
The dissatisfaction was that the hygiene was average, the bath towels were dirty when they were opened, and they had to be replaced. In addition, I brought elderly children and scattered luggage, but no staff came forward to ask if they needed help during the whole process.

msg:I really rarely give negative reviews, but I have been to this hotel three times in 2014, 2018, and 21, and I was particularly dissatisfied with the last experience compared to the previous one. First of all, the reason why I come back every time after so many years is because whenever I come to Huairou with my girlfriend to visit this hotel, the experience is very good, so this time three couples chose this hotel together. My negative review this time is mainly due to two main points: First, the hotel's leisure center, all swimming pool entertainment, etc. are not open. This point is not marked and notified on Ctrip, and the hotel does not have a separate system/manual after the reservation is successful. notify. As a result, part of our entertainment itinerary in the hotel was completely ruined, and we each went back to our rooms to play with our mobile phones at night. Secondly, we checked in after 14:00. We arrived at the hotel at 14:05, but we were told that the room was not ready yet. After waiting for a while, we got the room card, and when we opened the door, there was a smell of cigarette smoke. Apart from these two points, the reason I gave the service two stars was the housekeeping the next morning. When we were still at around 8 o'clock, the housekeeping was cleaning the room opposite with a very loud sound and did not close the door, causing us to be woken up very early.
Another thing that affected my sleep was the argument and the sound of suspected domestic violence in the room opposite at around 1 a.m. The hotel staff also had a small dispute with the man in the room opposite. One of the male hotel managers was constantly trying to calm down the other person's emotions, but the other person was "Call the police to arrest me" and swear words. Personally, I think there is no need to continue the theory and let the police intervene. This back and forth continued late into the night, and every time there would be loud noises every hour or so. It was not until later that it became quiet, not knowing whether the police came or the other man left on his own.
To sum up, in addition to the service attitude of the hotel staff that is still worthy of recognition, other levels have also declined significantly compared with the experience a few years ago. Considering that some events are not controllable factors of the hotel, I will not continue to reduce points. . If the facilities are not comprehensive but notified in a timely manner, reserve rooms on time and actively ensure that the entire hotel is non-smoking (all violations will be punished), and pay attention to whether the noise affects adjacent rooms during morning cleaning. If the above points are met, even if an accident occurs, the hotel If the staff handles the situation a little inappropriately, I can still give it a five-point praise.

msg:酒店很不錯，特別在疫情期間是很好的選擇。酒店服務人員態度很好，從訂房部到前台到餐廳，都彬彬有禮，提供了很多幫助。五一期間酒店嚴格執行管理要求，查驗健康寶和核酸，在餐廳等處都佩戴口罩，住店期間感覺很踏實。懷柔在疫情期間的表現可圈可點，住店的四天裏參加了兩次核酸檢測，雖然衹是鄉鎮級別的檢測點，但是志願人員很多，並且不時提醒排隊檢查的人保持兩米距離，給我留下了深刻印象。
酒店房間寬敞，臨街一側隔音也挺好，房間很涼快，外面近30度，屋裡不需要開空調。淋浴間的噴頭水流很大，洗着非常舒服，衞生間一直有股淡淡的香氣，比較神奇。房間裏鏡子很多，都擦拭的一塵不染，馬桶很好用。有三個停車場，可以滿足不同需求。
有些不足之處是電視台節目比較少，有點不清晰，桌球要收費，早餐晚餐有點貴，沒有小賣部，酒店周圍餐飲比較少，但是附近有兩三個公園，可以去轉轉。

msg:酒店大堂設計很有特色，映襯着電影文化濃厚氣息；走廊擺放的藝術工藝品，藴藏着設計師獨特的設計理念；客房乾淨、寬敞，視野開闊，可清晰看到影視城；餐廳環境裝修深邃質樸，後花園讓我心儀，園藝感強，清新優雅。前台服務人員小曹、小范服務意識很強，很貼心，因為孩子有些暈車，小曹送上暖心飲品。如果想遠離城市的喧囂，郊區遊玩也可以體驗優質的服務，每個細節都讓你身心舒適，交通也是挺方便的。
