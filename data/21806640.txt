They sent the fruit plate and local soup in the evening, arranged the dinner and helped with enquiries about the Snow Mountain tickets.
Be mindful that there are no restaurants or shops working nearby after 5pm so the only option for dinner is the hotel restaurant which serves noodles/porridge/rice noodles only or big hot pot set for a company.

In the evening, the children met two foreign friends who were making tea around the fire and had a pleasant chat. The next day, I went to climb the snow mountain with my children. The hotel arranged a housekeeper for the elderly to experience Dongba culture and light hiking behind the mountain. The elderly were very grateful for the care given by Xiao Li, Xiao Zhang and Xiao Pang during their stay, and left four words for him: a beautiful place and a warm welcome.

Built in 2018, the facilities are very new, there is floor heating, and the accommodation is very comfortable. Several young housekeepers are super warm and thoughtful. Especially the housekeeper Amin, who was a soldier, learned that my husband was an old squad leader, and immediately upgraded us to a room with a large balcony and a great view. I was very satisfied! The cross-bridge rice noodles are also delicious. I ate two meals. The hot pot is also good, and the pork belly is very tender. The design of the hotel is also very distinctive. A large wall is full of books. It is also beautiful to calm down and read and think. The hotel is very quiet, especially suitable for a quiet vacation. The hotel's service is really heartfelt, and it is sincere and enthusiastic to the guests, treating them as friends. I hope the hotel will get better and better! I will stay again if I have the chance!

Disadvantages: The hotel is located in the Dongba Ancient Tour Scenic Area, which is relatively remote, but you can take a taxi to Baisha Ancient Town for meals, etc. The nearby scenic spot will play music at 9 o'clock in the morning until the scenic spot closes, which is quite disturbing.

Of course, the main thing is the good location. Whether you can directly see the sunrise Jinshan Mountain on the second floor of the restaurant or walk a few minutes to the lakes in Dongba Valley, it is very convenient. It is also close to the Snow Mountain Scenic Area.

The only drawback is that the hotel is in the Dongba Valley Scenic Area, and the road to get in is a bit winding. You need to look carefully at the road signs or ask for directions or find staff to pick you up.

After the early morning shift, I contacted the housekeeper, Mr. Zhao, to arrange for a vehicle to wait in advance, and also packed and prepared breakfast in advance! (My daughter specifically told me that I must say that Mr. Zhao, the housekeeper, is very handsome. After living in Yunnan for so long, this is the first time I have met a native Yunnan boy who is taller than her and so handsome. He is really a likable and very handsome boy. , it can increase the family's love for a region) My daughter is 175cm tall, and I estimate that Mr. Zhao, the housekeeper, is about 190cm tall! I rarely comment on hotels, but this time I comment from the bottom of my heart! This time I booked a hotel for my family trip. Next time I go to Lijiang, I will definitely book this hotel and meet the handsome and warm housekeeper Mr. Zhao! 100 points of praise! If the hotel leaders can see it, they can give red envelopes and bonuses to Mr. Zhao, the housekeeper!

msg:The last stop of Suixinfei was Lijiang. Because I didn‚Äôt want to take leave and wanted to go to the mountains for two days in a row, I chose a hotel at the foot of the snow-capped mountains. The experience was unexpectedly good. I'm very satisfied with what I said.
1. It takes 10 minutes to go to the place where the entrance fee is collected at Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, and it costs 30 yuan to take a taxi. Very close and convenient.
2. On the second floor of the hotel restaurant, you can watch the Rizhao Mountains. Especially now that it is cold in winter, you can have breakfast indoors with the air conditioner blowing on. After eating, you can finish watching the Rizhao Jinshan Mountains. Go back to your room and tidy up before heading to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. Just in time for the 9 o'clock ropeway. The timing is just perfect.
3. The hotel is very beautiful, with an artificial lake and artificial rockery in the center, giving it a Jiangnan feel. There is a forest walk at the back where you can climb a small path. I didn‚Äôt see anyone talking about it when I looked at the guide before. I guess everyone just went straight to the snow-capped mountains without exploring the hotel. I was also recommended by Xiao Zhao that I could go for a walk and discovered a new world. There are 4 small pavilions at different heights as you go to the right along the promenade. I think it will be very happy in the summer. You can look down at the small lake from the top, and have a happy tea with your friends. It will be a happy life. If you walk to the left, you can see the snow-capped mountain tops, but they are mostly obscured by trees. Maybe you can make the trees shorter to see more scenery.
4. The room is large and there is a small balcony for me. I looked at the one next door. My balcony seems to be a little bigger than others. It can hold 3 chairs. It will be very happy to lie down after climbing the mountain.
5. The staff's service is very good. They mainly deal with A Ming and Xiao Zhao. They called me in advance that morning to tell me the location of the hotel so that I could not find it. When I arrived, they asked me if I wanted to eat at the hotel in the evening because I had to order food to avoid guests. After climbing the snow-capped mountains, I had no food to eat. On the first day, I climbed 4680 and came down the mountain too late and there was no car. A Ming was kind enough to ask me to take a taxi at the foot of the mountain and ask him to pick me up the mountain. As a result, I came back and found that I was the only one eating in the restaurant, and the kitchen uncle had been waiting for me to cook a cross-bridge rice noodle. It just makes me feel that it is in place in every aspect. When you get to the mountains, you really need a better hotel to live more comfortably. Finally, I was given a gift set from the hotel to take with me. I just think it‚Äôs worth it. This service, this facility, this location.
6. In summary, I think it will be very comfortable to stay for at least two days. On the first day, I climbed 4680 Blue Moon Valley and came back for massage and visited the hotel. On the second day, I saw Rizhao Jinshan Mountain, then Maoniuping Yunshanping, and then came back for massage. It is a plan that is very comfortable and allows you to play in various areas of the snow-capped mountains at a relatively suitable pace.

Service: This aspect really needs to be improved. Although the attitude is good, the service staff, except for the manager, are somewhat unprofessional and can't give accurate answers to anything. The souvenirs in the set meal were not given after being reminded, the tie-dye experience was paid, and the Dongba Valley tickets were not handled in the end.

msg:When I went to Lijiang this time, I wanted to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city and find a quiet place to rest for a few days. I have relatively high requirements for accommodation. After searching for a long time and looking at many hotels, I finally settled on Shangyin Mountain Residence. Before going there, I still worry about whether I can book the accommodation I want as I wish. I was very moved when I arrived. It was indeed the "love store of my dreams" that really surprised me.
The hotel is located in a scenic area with beautiful mountains and clear waters, making it worthy of being a secluded hotel. There is no need to question the quiet environment. It is quiet enough here, without the hustle and bustle. You feel like you are completely wrapped in nature. You instantly forget the busyness and triviality of daily life and meet your purest self. In addition to being quiet, it also looks classy. The facilities in the room are very new and very good. The wooden furniture is my favorite. It always gives me a gentle feeling and makes my stay safe and comfortable. The clean and tidy environment and the comfortable big bed also gave me a deep sleep that I had not experienced in a long time. There is also the favorite outdoor terrace, which allows you to be infinitely close to nature without losing privacy. If you like purity, of course you will not miss taking a walk around the Qushan Mountain. Relax and embrace nature. You will feel that you are also part of the scenery here. Feeling the wind here quietly seems to heal everything.
You can't see the snow-capped mountains from the room, but in front of the hotel restaurant is the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, without any obstruction, as if you are standing on the snow-capped mountains, but without the cold wind blowing from the snow-capped mountains. There were not many people, so I was in the restaurant by myself, looking at the snow-capped mountains and basking in the sun, enjoying myself in a daze. Occasionally looking up, it feels like walking into a Miyazaki Hayao comic, enjoying the tranquility and serenity. Perhaps this is what my heart wants the most for a vacation.
The most rare thing is the hotel's service. The staff's warm attitude also makes people feel the enthusiasm and charm of Lijiang. Staying here is very relaxing and heart-warming. Because it was my first time to try it, I initially had the attitude of giving it a try, but after staying there, the whole experience exceeded my expectations and added a lot of comfort to this trip to Lijiang.
Next time I come to Lijiang, Shangyin Mountain Residence will be my only choice. If you happen to be like me, someone who likes quietness, nature, and wants to quietly enjoy inner peace, I highly recommend it and it‚Äôs worth a stay.

The princess costumes and headgears were carefully prepared in the room, which won the children's favorite. Breakfast is not a buffet, but a set menu. Although there are not many types, the taste is okay. On the second day, I started to step on thunder, and the summary is as follows: 1. When I returned to the hotel in the afternoon, I wanted to order some tea by the stove, and then have dinner. As a result, landlines, mobile phones, and wandering all over the hotel could not find a waiter. Later, I finally found a talent I was told that the chef had gone home, there was no dinner that day, and it was uncertain whether there would be breakfast the next day (follow-up: a simple breakfast was prepared by the front desk the next day). It was around 6:00 p.m., the nearby scenic spot had just closed, and the surrounding area was very remote, and there was no takeaway at all. If you want to eat, you have to take a taxi to the city, and the round-trip taxi fare is more than 100. It was later discovered that our family might be the only guests staying that night, so the chef seemed to have gone home for the holidays. If you inform us in advance, we can understand and make arrangements earlier. But the hotel's handling method is really poor and lacks service awareness. 2. In terms of hardware, some details are still different from those of star-rated hotels, such as cold toilets and air-conditioning outlets covered with spider silk. 3. The name is not worthy of the name, there is no hot spring, and it is said that it has not been opened for a long time. , 4. The location is remote, and it is inconvenient to eat and take a taxi.

The only advantage is that it is relatively close to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. If you come to Lijiang in the future, it is recommended to stay in a hotel near the ancient city.

msg:1. It was so cold that I caught a cold in the morning, the floor heating was turned on to 33 degrees and there was no temperature, and the quilt was thin.
2. The breakfast is not as good as Samsung‚Äôs. There are only noodles, eggs, buns, milk, and porridge. I‚Äôm completely sorry for the star rating. I suggest the store to see how other people‚Äôs breakfasts with the same star rating are like. It‚Äôs not necessary to see the golden mountain of sunshine.
3. The parking lot can only be driven in after six o'clock. It is said that the Dongba Valley scenic spot is not allowed, and the scenic spot says that the hotel is not allowed. I don't know which of them is true. You can only park at the entrance, which is actually not a parking lot, and there is no parking space plan.
4. I didn‚Äôt eat at other times except breakfast, only some soup pot, starting from 488, and the takeaway is 0. If you want to avoid the world, you can eat pot at a high price or wait for a hungry stomach. For coffee, a coffee machine is dirty, and the milk is Mengniu ordinary milk , Self-made coffee sells for 28, it is unnecessary.
5. A room card at the front desk failed several times, making people run back and forth at the front desk in the cold wind. Holding back their anger, that person looked not very smart, and there was no need to embarrass him even if he was working part-time. Unfortunately, his professionalism was too far away. The supervisor probably can, but he can only play tricks, and he is just a leader in front of customers, so he doesn't bother to talk to such people.
6. This hotel is 2,648 meters above sea level. Outsiders find themselves suffering from insomnia, headaches and nausea. Don't doubt that this is altitude sickness. Elderly people are weak, don't choose
7. If you want to go to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain earlier, there is no need to live here, because its exit is where the traffic jam starts, and the traffic jam is 2.5 kilometers away for an hour.
8. The hotel has nothing to do with the hot springs, the pools are all deserted.
The Shuhe Ancient Town below has beautiful scenery and no worries about eating and drinking. The attitude of the bosses is very professional, and there is no gap without comparison.
Praise for the big sister who cleans and the big brother who carries luggage. The first bad review is really not worth it, the above comments guarantee conscience. It is difficult to have repeat customers without improvement.

Snow mountains can be seen directly from the yard. In the afternoon, I drank tea facing the snow-capped mountains at the hotel without going anywhere, which was very pleasant. It is a rare good luck to see colorful auspicious clouds while eating in the restaurant at night. The enthusiasm of the service staff is just right, making the guests really feel at home. The pictures I took were also very good. After posting on Moments, I recommended the hotel to at least ten friends. I hope that the hotel will continue to be a resort hotel with heart and continue to maintain high cost performance. Next time I come to Lijiang, I would like to stay for two days.

one time
Because my friend wanted to get up early to climb the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, we decided to stay at Yulong Snow Mountain.
Lijiang Snow Mountain Hot Spring Mountain Hotel at the foot of Longxue Mountain, go to Snow Mountain Five
the minute is up
It was a very comfortable two days, the room was very big and comfortable, there was one to watch
See the huge balcony of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the service attitude of the hotel is very good, OK
Li will arrange for us to go upstairs, and we can go to the roof to have wine in the afternoon
Tea prepared by the stove around the stove (this sister really loves it)
I'm lazy, I can't climb Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, but I found out
Climb up on the roof to take a photo with the whole snow mountain and sleep beautifully
In the afternoon, you can take a lot of photos in the hotel
In the afternoon, I still went to Blue Moon Valley. I didn‚Äôt die from exhaustion.
The store made a spa and soaked in hot springs (I really enjoy it,
a little guilt
No), then go back to the room to take a bath and eat fruit
It's really a very comfortable two days, I always think that going out for a trip
comfort is the first
One, the accommodation conditions and service must be good, so
Therefore, you will definitely choose a hotel with a good environment, complete facilities, and convenient travel.
Shopping, catching sights is not the meaning of travel, the most important thing is to be happy and comfortable

The star hotel is good and very warm. It's the feeling I like. The attitude of the waiter is very good. I especially like the sofa in their room. I have obsessive-compulsive disorder and don't like to sit on the bed directly after entering the door. It feels unclean. It just so happens that this hotel has a sofa, a table and chairs, a big bed, and the sound insulation is super great. At first I was worried that it was a bit far away, so I chose a room on the second floor. It was very good. I needed a quilt at four o'clock in the morning and sent it back. I am very grateful to the waiter on duty at night. The breakfast is very delicate, it is a perfect day for a piggy girl!

Most of the waiters have good attitudes but obviously don't know what to do and are very panicked. Some service staff have extremely bad attitudes. 3.

Although it is written, it should not be done. 5. Overall, I am inexperienced and unprofessional. The large number of customers during the Spring Festival and the reception capacity are far from enough to affect the experience.

The selling point is that at the foot of the snow-capped mountains, you can only see a corner of the snow-capped mountains in the distance. The most important thing is that the service and details cannot keep up. Why do some of the waiters wear casual clothes? The front desk person has an expressionless face, but when he sees someone coming from behind, he immediately pounces on him diligently. When I checked into the room, I found that there were still cigarette butts in an ashtray from the previous guest who checked out, and the humidifier knocked over a table. There were cobwebs around the windows and stains on the sink. The worst thing is the breakfast. Does the kitchen seem to be contracted? In casual clothes? It wasn't too late, so there were only a few small buns here and there. The steamed buns and hot dishes area were all cold, and the coffee pot only had one bottom, and the hot milk couldn't come out. The overall experience of this five-star hotel is not very good. Could Ctrip Dad know more about it? In terms of warmth, it is not as good as a B&B. If you have requirements for software, hardware and service details, big brands like Jinmao and InterContinental will not step in.

msg:Written at the front: Very unsatisfactory experience. It was off-season when I came. There are few guests but it should not be an excuse for the deterioration of the service quality of a professional hotel.
Based on the following negative comments, please refer to:
1 Hotel location: The hotel is located at No. 1 Dongbagu, isn't this the same as no location? Navigating down a barren land by taxi, I couldn't get through on the phone. After I made it clear that I couldn't find a place, I didn't say to pick us up. Is the hotel's battery car left there to eat ashes?
2 Meals: I want to eat at night, but I can't find the menu in the room, go downstairs and ask, the chef is already off work...Is it off at 7 o'clock? There is no store open within 5 kilometers, what are the guests eating?
3 Hotel design: no elevator, good luck with heavy luggage; the kettle is in the cabinet, don‚Äôt look for it everywhere; don‚Äôt grab the handrail relay when going up the stairs, it‚Äôs all gray
4 Landscape: I'm so laughing, I have booked the best room. When the window is opened, only the eaves are available. As soon as I went to the balcony, I thought I was back to my hometown in the country, and soon my grandma should call me to dry the corn.
5 Service attitude: After I was obviously very displeased and expressed that I wanted to complain, there was no apology of any kind. I will help you to promote it.
6 In summary, the whole hotel is unprofessional from top to bottom. If it doesn't work, let's make skin care products honestly and don't make hotels. Whenever a friend wants to come, I will swear directly.

If the hotel management can see it, I hope you understand that it has nothing to do with the employees, so you should manage it like this, and don't be shy and irritate the employees.
