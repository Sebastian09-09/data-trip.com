msg:I had an excellent experience at Swissotel and would like to commend the staff for their outstanding service. Checking in late at night, 刘基扬, 王国琪, 刘畅, 金学哲, and 段冰宇 went above and beyond, insisting on carrying our luggage and escorting us to our room. The responsiveness via WeChat at all hours was impressive. Any issues we raised, with these 5 staffs that we encountered were promptly addressed, and resolutions were provided without delay. The breakfast offerings were comprehensive, featuring both Western and Chinese cuisine; however, it would be helpful to have forks, spoons, and water readily available. Despite the demagnetization issue with the key card, the staff, especially 刘基扬 and 王国琪, responded instantly to our messages and ensured a swift resolution. Overall, our stay was marked by exceptional service, and I want to extend special thanks to 刘基扬, 王国琪, 刘畅, 金学哲, and 段冰宇 for their commendable efforts.

在瑞士鲁能酒店的入住体验非常好，工作人员的服务很称职。在深夜与外国护照办理入住手续时，刘基扬、王国琪、刘畅、金学哲和段冰宇非常友善，并坚持帮我们搬运行李并护送我们到房间。我们没有国内手机号，他们还主动加了微信以保持更容易的沟通。高效响应令人印象深刻。我们提出的任何问题，都得到了及时回复与解决。包括在大半夜，有多需要的刘基扬和王国琪也及时送到我们房间里，其他三位也很及时的替我们我们与相关人士联系。
酒店早餐选择丰富，中西式都有，如果能提供叉子、勺子和水的话会更完美。尽管房卡经常问题，但我遇到的那些工作人员，都能确保问题迅速解决。总的来说，体验到了瑞士鲁能出色的服务，得特别感谢刘基扬、王国琪、刘畅、金学哲和段冰宇。让我对这个酒店和中国人的印象十分好。

There’s shuttles you can take to go to nearby attractions. Wish there was a jacuzzi and a nice bar to go in the evening to have a drink;) but hey you can’t have everything .

The only thing to note is that the ski slope are more for beginners. there are few and they are not very high. Other than that the stay was just great thanks notably to Andy !!!

msg:Luneng Swissotel Villa is the most correct decision in this trip to Changbai Mountain. Especially when I went out with my children, it was my first time to see snow in the Northeast. When I came out of the villa, I saw a large area of ​​clean and thick snow. The balcony of the room was very large, and I could see the beautiful snow scene from the balcony every morning. The taxi call came in a timely manner, and there was no half-hour wait as mentioned online. The included benefits are pretty good, especially the hot springs, which actually include outdoor hot springs in the snow. It was a bit unpleasant when I checked in. I chartered a car from Yanji and paid 1,300. I just wanted to check in early. I arrived at 2:30. I was told that I can't check in until 3 o'clock. This is normal. However, I kept saying that the room was not cleaned well. I arrived at 3 o'clock. We were allowed to go to the villa after half a day. Those who arrived later than us checked in earlier than us.

Each room has a separate air conditioner. There is an electric water heater for bathing. Please pay attention to water consumption. The deer in the yard are fed carrots for 25 yuan each. Breakfast felt too simple and average. There are many restaurants in the park, but the taste is average. Each room in the children's club can play for free for one hour every day, and there is no rush when there are not many people. There are many ski trails in the ski resort, and you can use your ID card to exchange for a snow pass, which is very convenient, but the instructor is a bit expensive, haha. Overall it's okay

The hotel called me the day before and asked me what I wanted for the room. I said we had a child. The hotel said we would prepare the children's supplies in advance. I thought the hotel's service was really considerate. As a result, there was nothing when we checked in. Moreover, the two balcony doors in the room could not be locked. There was a platform outside our balcony. Where is the safety? Because we had to check out very early in the morning, we communicated with the hotel in advance to pack a few cold boxes for us to take away. We communicated with the hotel twice the day before we checked out. As a result, no one was there the next morning. I called and waited for a long time but no one came out. As a result, the whole family left hungry. Where is the hotel industry standard? The room rate for one night is not cheap, but is it equal to the service provided? Shouldn't the front desk of such a large hotel be 24 hours? Let's talk about the hot spring service provided. The shower area of ​​the hot spring is more smelly than the toilet. There is even feces in the men's shower. Shouldn't a good hotel provide guests with a home away from home feeling?

Moving from Meijing Pavilion to this hotel, the difference is really big. Luneng has not been open for many years, and the maintenance is even worse than Wanda. The room price is more than 2,000, and the supporting facilities are only at the level of a four-star hotel. The hair dryer used is very stingy. The basin and toilet can also be seen to be of a relatively ordinary series.
Hygiene:
There is a layer of dust on the bedside table, and the hygiene is also very bad.
Noise:
It was more than 8 o'clock in the morning, and it was like a vegetable market outside. Children were running and adults were calling their companions loudly. The sound insulation was very poor. I put on noise-canceling headphones, but I could still hear the ringtone of the WeChat phone call outside. I thought I didn't close the door for a while. It was too outrageous.

I don't recommend this hotel at all. If you want to ski, Wanda's ski resort is more convenient and the ski slope is better. Luneng's largest slope ski slope can't catch up with Wanda's intermediate slope. It is really only suitable for novices.
If you have to stay in Luneng, I suggest choosing Meijing Pavilion. The price is not much different. It is simply a difference between heaven and earth. I can't imagine how the quality of hotels operated by Accor can be so different.

Environment: Swissotel is a veritable little Switzerland. Every step you take is very beautiful. If you have the opportunity, be sure to book a free forest hike at the EP Activity Center. I heard that other hotels charge for hiking.

Service: Every waiter is very enthusiastic, especially our butler Fanfan. He added WeChat in advance, which makes communication very convenient. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus to and from the airport. You need to make an appoin**ent in advance. There are EP event staff members on the bus to join the group. All You can inquire about the activities in the resort in the group, which is also very convenient

Food: The advantage of living in the main building is that the commercial street is right downstairs. Just outside the door, you can find everything from iron pot stew, hot pot, coffee shops, Burger King, and Italian restaurants.
You can also book the igloo hotpot at Yuanxiang Lake Restaurant in advance. It’s so special to eat hot pot in the igloo at minus ten degrees Celsius. Fireworks are set off in the igloo at 6:30 every night. The restaurant can also see Changbai Mountain during the day. They are also responsible for pick-up and drop-off, which is a very good experience. There are also ice fishing and horse-drawn carriage experiences.

Overall, I was very lucky to stay at the Swissotel, which made my four-day and three-night itinerary full of activities. I was able to spend a long time without leaving the hotel or visiting the attractions.

msg:I was fortunate enough to stay at the gorgeous Swissôtel Hotel located at the foot of the scenic Changbai Mountain. The experience here far exceeded my expectations and left me with deep and beautiful memories.
   The location of Swissotel Huamei Resort is uniquely located, close to the Changbai Mountain Scenic Area, providing an excellent starting point for exploring this U.N. natural heritage site. At the same time, the surrounding environment of the hotel is quiet and beautiful, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, making it an ideal place for leisure and vacation.
    From the moment you step into the hotel lobby, you can feel its luxury and sophistication. The interior of the room is tastefully decorated with warm wooden elements and comfortable fabrics, creating a homely a**osphere. The large bed in the room is extremely comfortable, allowing you to have a good night's sleep. The bathroom is spacious and bright, equipped with high-quality toiletries, which makes people feel more considerate. Really enjoyed my time relaxing here.
    The hotel's service can be described as "impeccable". From the front desk receptionist to the room attendant, every staff member showed professionalism and enthusiasm. During my stay, I made some special requests, such as helping to return my snow card, and the hotel was able to flexibly accommodate them, which made me feel very convenient. The quality of the food in the restaurant is also very high, whether it is local specialties or international cuisine, it is endlessly memorable.
  The hotel's design fully takes into account the integration of natural landscapes. Many rooms can directly overlook the magnificent scenery of Changbai Mountain. Especially in the early morning and dusk, the outline of the mountains looks particularly spectacular against the sky. Even when resting in the room, you can feel the breath of nature.
    Overall, Swissotel Changbaishan Huamei Resort is a resort hotel that perfectly combines luxury enjoyment with natural beauty. Whether you are a traveler looking for leisure and relaxation, or someone eager to ski, this is a choice not to be missed. My stay experience this time was great and I look forward to coming back next time to enjoy the tranquility and luxury.

msg:The suite is in the main building. The room is very large and the balcony faces the deer park. It is very suitable for bringing children. There is a deer park downstairs, and you can feed the deer every day. The children are very happy. Adults may find the eight snow entertainments boring, but the children are very happy. There is a snow slope at the entrance of the hotel, and you can go sledding when you go out every day. In addition, I would like to praise the hotel butler. The service is very considerate. He gave blueberries and ginseng honey slices, and carrots to feed the deer every day. You can find him for reservations for meals and various activities. Be careful to avoid Li Liangui Meat Pie Shop. It tastes good, but after one meal, our two children vomited for a whole day. It should be a bit unclean. If you are really sick, you can go to the infirmary at the ski resort to buy medicine. Overall, it was a very satisfactory trip.

msg:We stayed during the Spring Festival and were lucky to be upgraded to a suite. The room was large and warm. The service was also very good and the staff were very enthusiastic. There was a fireworks show on New Year's Eve. We also gave gifts for check-in, dried blueberries and ginseng honey slices. There is a commercial street downstairs, which is convenient for eating. The ski resort is not very crowded and suitable for beginners. My child just learned to snowboard and was able to slide down the slope in two hours. You can see Changbai Mountain from a distance when you go up the cable car, but if you are not a skiing veteran, you have to walk down the snow trail by yourself, which takes about ten minutes.

msg:The hotel environment is OK, the service is standard, and the villa also sent fruits, souvenirs and carrots for feeding the deer. It's just that the breakfast environment and food don't match the holiday environment. The place is not big, it's crowded when there are many people, and there are fewer varieties of food, so the experience is not good.
The whole hotel can be seen to be trying hard to serve, but there are many people in the holiday season, especially in the afternoon when the check-in is the busiest.
When checking in to the villa, you can inform the guests in advance to go directly to the lobby of the villa area, so as to avoid unloading the luggage at the front desk of Building 29 and taking the shuttle bus to the front desk of the villa area.

Of course, there are also some shortcomings. The toilet paper in the villa we stayed in was at the back left, which was very inconvenient to use, and the kids couldn't reach it. In addition, there was no USB port in the room, which was not very convenient!

msg:I have two kids and wanted a more comfortable stay. I looked around at Wanda and Luneng, and finally chose Swissotel. I booked a family villa, thinking it would be more fun for the children to play in. There is snow right outside the door. You can play in the small yard for as long as you like, and you can see it right in front of you. The floor heating and air conditioning in the room are very powerful, super warm! Except that I felt a bit cold after taking a shower, everything else was very good. It was very dry. You need to drink more water and hydrate. The room, bedding, and everything else are good. There are refrigerators and kitchen equipment. The foyer isolates the cold outside. This design is very good. , our toys are all placed in the foyer. It still feels like a cabin, and the balcony is super big. Overall, I am satisfied, especially when I added a hotel butler before going. The butler was very considerate in every aspect and provided good service. We had to call for a car wherever we went. There were not many cars, but every time we agreed with the butler, the car would arrive. They are all very fast. Thumbs up to the butler. But my friend went there a week before us and complained to me about the front desk service problem when he came back. Unexpectedly, I also encountered it! On the day of check-in, I made it clear to the hotel front desk that I had two reservations for a total of four nights! We were given a room card and they didn't say that we needed to renew it within two days. I emphasized again that we were staying for four nights! As a result, at noon the next day, the cleaning lady reminded us that we had not received the extension message and asked if we were extending our stay. I was very confused at that time. After I communicated with the housekeeper, the housekeeper said that she had communicated with the front desk and said there was no problem. Continue After checking in, I received a call again in the evening saying that my order was completed and asking me about my stay experience. I was very unhappy, right? What did they mean after four nights? On the third afternoon, I came back from the ski resort and couldn’t get in! We were in a villa, and we waited for fifteen minutes at the front desk to deliver the card in a weather of minus 20 degrees Celsius! ! ! We said we would see the manager to find out the reason and waited for another half hour. The hotel front desk is amazing! ! ! I hope that everyone will find a reliable front desk and avoid such terrible things as we did. The children had a great time and we are still very satisfied with this trip. The main reason is that Ctrip's ability to solve problems is much better than before. Here it is Ctrip I was impressed. Before I went there, Ctrip’s customer service also helped me communicate very well. I will place an order with Ctrip next time!

There are more delicious food on the commercial street, and the hotel activity center has also opened. You can play games, board games and watch giant-screen movies. There are also hotel activities that you can participate in, which is very suitable for a group of friends.
The hotel was very considerate. They called us one day in advance to inquire about room requirements. They also provided welcome fruits and a bag full of local specialties. It's really great!
The only drawback is that there are so many guests during this period that there are not enough seats and tableware in the breakfast restaurant. Still needs improvement.

It is also convenient to walk back to the back door to eat breakfast! There are three rooms in the villa, the beds are very large, and the restaurant is in Italian restaurants. It is delicious and more delicious than the breakfast on Crown Holiday! ! The barbecue in Hanfu Village in the commercial street is difficult to eat, the meat is very old, and the chicken soup and vegetable flavor of Gao Lipeng are very good!

msg:On the first day, we chartered a car to explore Changbai Mountain and arrived at the hotel at about 7 o'clock. The Harbin driver couldn't find it the first time and had to go around a circle before arriving at the hotel lobby. Someone came out to pick us up and helped us get a piece of luggage (we were 3 adults and 2 children, and we dragged 5 boxes). The room we booked was not in the main building. There would be a butler who would take us to the building and room where we were. He spoke very quickly during the process. In addition, we had hotel rights. The paper was not given immediately, which was a bit perfunctory. I started a group at that time and talked about skiing matters and ski clothing rental. In the end, the rights were not used on the first day, but when I went to play the next day. We went to the front desk and asked ourselves to find out the relevant information and they gave us the rights paper and specific operation methods. The door to the room was broken, and the master came to repair it after reporting it for repair. The balcony door was completely frozen due to the snow on the terrace outside, and some of the snow melted and flowed in. There is only one bathroom for one double bedroom and one twin bedroom. , it means that 5 people have to queue up to take a shower and wash up. I didn’t notice this when booking the room, and I regret it a bit. There are fewer people than Wanda, but I prefer Wanda in terms of room facilities and services.

msg:I am satisfied with the hotel room size 👌 but the breakfast really needs to be improved. The biggest problem with the placement of the meals is that they are crowded together, and the people taking the meals are also crowded together. The dining experience is extremely uncomfortable, and there are also daily menus If there is no change, you will be drunk. At least change it, the food is too simple!
Generally speaking, Huamei Resorts is expensive, has few choices, and the ski resorts are not professional enough! Except for skiing and hot springs, the free benefits I saw when I bought the package were not very interesting. Everything paid for in the resort is extremely expensive! The dog-pulled sledge costs 128 yuan for two laps, and it’s over in just over a minute🤣I almost thought I spent yen! The food prices are high but the portions are small, the resort is far away from anywhere, and the taxi fare to the town is outrageous!

You have to go in and wait next to others to grab a seat, or wait for a seat next to you while eating breakfast, which is very stressful. There is no question of whether there is a guide or not. There is no place and no one can care about you.
Skiing: The ski resort is average and suitable for beginners
Service: Really don’t even want to give a smile
Forgot to help reserve a car; there was no reply to the phone call agreed during the communication, and I took the three children to wait outside for half an hour, and no one responded when I called to complain; I asked the housekeeper three times in the group to reserve the airport bus, but no reply was received. I only gave the news at :00. There was an early flight at 7:00 the next day. I really couldn’t be restrained. I just wanted to tell you where the service is!
I originally thought that the matter would come to an end after we settled the bill, but the room fee had not yet been settled the day after we arrived home. We contacted a manager ourselves to settle the bill.

Wanda had too many people. Choosing Luneng actually lowered my expectations, but it still exceeded my expectations and the service could not keep up. The reason why it ended was because there were too many people.

msg:The overall feeling of the Luneng Resort Swiss Resort we stayed at this time was very good. We stayed in the villa area because we were in a hurry to make an appoin**ent, so we didn't book a twin room. Later, we directly added an extra bed at the front desk for 380 yuan, which was very convenient and the charge was reasonable. We came from the high-speed rail The station is relatively far and the drive takes about an hour and a half. The cost is about 300. It will be more convenient to come from the airport because Changbai Mountain is a difficult place to take a taxi😭 Especially during the peak tourist period, the package is very cost-effective and includes a variety of fun items than alone. It will be cheaper to buy. Our housekeeper Lisa Amy Ada Shirley is also a very interesting friend. She chose a villa room with a good view for me🏠I can enjoy the beautiful snow scenery. Thank you🥹The hotel's buffet breakfast has many types and the taste is not bad. In addition to the scenic area The hotel's restaurant also has many restaurants with different tastes. Convenience stores and everything are complete. Overall, it is quite convenient. It feels very comfortable to stay here for a day or two, hahaha.

msg:A very satisfying travel experience. The hotel gave me a lot of benefits, including skiing⛷️, hot springs♨️, breakfast, shooting, snowmobile, etc. The program was very rich. The room facilities are very good. The suite I booked has two bedrooms, one living room and an open kitchen. The rooms are all suites and the living room also has a bathroom. It is very comfortable for a family to live in. The room is very spacious, bright and warm. I basically wear short-sleeves when I go back to the room. The hotel's hot springs are quite good, and there are many pool options, both indoors and outdoors. They are large and not crowded. The ski trails at the ski resort are very suitable for beginners, and the instructors at the ski resort are also very good. Both my sons learned how to ski and had a great time. The breakfast in the hotel is also good. The restaurant staff are warm and polite, and the restaurant environment is also quite good. I went to both restaurants. I didn't eat much, but it was rich👍. Special praise to my housekeeper, Miss Hanhan, who is very considerate, answers all my questions, and responds to my requests. She helped me arrange a bus from the hotel to the airport, and booked a car for me when I went out. It was really good👍. Next time I come to Changbai Mountain, I will definitely stay at Luneng Switzerland🌹

msg:After studying the reviews a long time ago, I booked an ordinary garden view room. When I checked in, I was lucky enough to be accommodated in Building 29 of the main building. Living in Building 29 in winter definitely has great advantages, whether it is to go to the restaurant for breakfast or to find the front desk. Just put on light clothes and go downstairs. It's really hard to put on and take off thick clothes and shoes several times in the winter. The room is quite new, clean and spacious, with a small balcony. The bathroom has floor heating. It is very comfortable to take a bath and the hot water is sufficient. Our family of three washed our hair and took a shower. When we finally came out, we saw a sign on the bathroom door that there was still a full tank of hot water.
The shortcomings are the same as all the reviews said, the management and service are chaotic. The lobby is a mess, and there are a lot of staff, but they are all here and there, and they are very perfunctory when asking for things like calling a taxi. If the request is very simple, it may be solved quickly, but otherwise, they can be fooled as much as possible. When I checked in, I was told that they advertised that the Snow Park would be open on the 25th, but they said it seemed so, not sure. Anyway, I don’t know anything about my hotel’s facilities and services. When I checked out, I was asked to call for a taxi. First, I was asked to ask for the shuttle bus at the door. Then, I was asked to find the next hotel to ask for a taxi. Finally, I was reluctant to ask for a taxi, but it was not until the next hotel we booked found one. When the car picked us up, we didn’t know where the car they called was.
We turned on the do-not-disturb light before ten o'clock in the morning, but the cleaning staff knocked on the door and asked us to turn off the do-not-disturb light so that she could come in and clean. She only left after we said it was inconvenient. We turned off the do-not-disturb light after about ten o'clock and turned it on to please clean it immediately, but no one cleaned it for a long time. After urging it several times, someone finally cleaned it, but when we went back we found that they had left the door wide open after cleaning. I left, luckily I didn’t lose anything.
One day after checking out, I suddenly remembered to check whether the deposit had been refunded. I found out that I was refunded more than 300 yuan, so I called and asked to check and get back to me. Then there was no sound. I had to call Ctrip customer service. Ctrip customer service After urging me three times, the hotel front desk asked me to add WeChat and refund the refund. Remember to check the refund amount after checking out.

The hotel will be equipped with a dedicated butler who will be very considerate if you ask for anything. Thanks to Xiaojin, Hanhan, Mark, Bobli, and Sun Lianqing who enthusiastically booked all activities for us. The only incident was that when we finally returned to the airport, the hotel front desk did not take the customer's needs into consideration and did not handle the drop-off service for us in time. It was recommended that friends who were going to book a vehicle to the airport in advance. The shuttle service is tight during peak hours. Everything else is perfect.

Rooms could not be checked in until after two or three o'clock. It was dark at 4:30 in the northeast, so the time was very awkward.

Otherwise, they will tell you that it will take 20 minutes. There are not many skiers and the experience is good. The food is probably the worst. Well, there aren’t many places to eat nearby. The hotel’s breakfast has not many varieties, which is acceptable. However, the fruit is not fresh. I didn’t eat it in the main building on the first day. The watermelon and other things were sour. I ate in the main building the next day. The only thing I could eat was at night. The local taste is just okay, but I don’t recommend this place if you have food requirements. Taking pictures in the villa area is beautiful but inconvenient. If you want to play, it is recommended that the main building is very convenient.

msg:The advantages and disadvantages of this hotel are obvious. The snow scenery is beautiful, the venue is very large, the villas and cabins are very impressive, and the staff are very enthusiastic in service. However, there are several problems that need to be improved: 1. The sound insulation in the villa area is very poor. Don’t listen. In fact, many villas have multiple families in one building. We are a family of 8. Walking around and upstairs, the sound of watching TV is very clear. 2. The floor heating is mainly in the door area, and the floor in the room is still cold. 3. The first time I went to a ski resort was an equipment rental shop where a coach took me to the lobby. Protective gear cost 100 RMB, and snow goggles cost RMB 60. They were in tatters. Later I found out that it was private. I rented the same equipment in the lobby for half the price and the equipment was still new. The instructors were very enthusiastic when I entered, and then I was tricked into renting this expensive one. Since the lobby already has rentals, why do we have to set up such a spot and have the instructors guide us there? It’s really a bad experience to rip off the experience like this. It’s disgusting. batch.

Although I encountered a group check-in when I checked in,
The lobby is a bit overwhelmed
But I have never encountered a situation where the service attitude was said to be bad before.
The hotel employees I met were all very polite and enthusiastic.
The room is very spacious with two balconies, two bathrooms and two large wardrobes
There is no pressure to store the equipment in three large boxes.
The resort has a lot of activities. I went to experience the UTV on the day I checked in.
The hot air balloon next to it is so beautiful. I brought my treasure to experience it too.
After dinner we went to the hot spring again
Enjoy the snow while taking a bath♨️ It’s so comfortable
It would be better to go during the wrong time for breakfast. There are quite a lot of people coming to play.
There are shuttle buses to and from the ski resort, which is very convenient.
There is also a bus service to the airport.
Already recommended to colleagues and friends

It is beautiful no matter how you take pictures. The private rental ski clothes in the ski resort are a bit tricky. Remember, you don’t need to buy face shields. I was scammed and bought two for 99 which are useless. The 198 is gone and the rented goggles are useless and smell dirty. The two of us used them for 688 and no invoice was issued. If you are skiing, I recommend it. Don’t rent protective gear that won’t be used. You can skate on snowboards, but the protective gear is so melted that your eyes will almost fall out and it’s not tied securely. If the ski resort doesn’t straighten out the rental snow clothes, it will really lose points for tourists. , it is really a scam to rent snow suits from this private store. Unless you only rent their snow suits, don’t rent anything else. I only rented a top and a set of protective gear at 688. Remember to avoid the traps when skiing, and there is also one of the ferry people. The uncle was also very unfriendly. When we were about to go back to the hotel after filming, we all got in the car and kicked us out of the car. He said that he was not going back to the Swissotel and was going to that beautiful hotel. We all said that we had to catch the car and leave immediately. Even if they drop us off, they insist on driving us out of the car. Even if we are just a short distance away, we are not willing to accept it.

Several areas are not distributed together and are arranged uniformly, which makes the experience bad. However, the hotel's service staff I'm very enthusiastic, but there are too few restaurants in the town. Fortunately, we rented a car and could go out to eat.

The room service hotline is not unreachable as many people say.
The front desk response was very timely.
The night I checked in, there was a problem with the floor heating in the room.
It was quite quick for the master to come and check.
Behind the lobby on the Swiss side,
Feeding the deer is so healing.
There is also a commercial street next to the hotel with several restaurants.
If you are a little further away, you can also contact the store for pick-up and drop-off.
It's just that the milk for breakfast doesn't taste very good.
The noodles are delicious.
Probably the peak season has just started.
Some of the waiters have just taken up the job and are relatively unfamiliar.
I later lived in Wanda and it was the same.
This is a common problem.
By the way, the Italian restaurant’s special winter drink is delicious!
I hope to come to Luneng next time.
You can see more beautiful scenery,

We would like to thank the handsome guys Mark and Yu Han at the front desk for their enthusiastic help, which saved the four of us from the trouble of changing room types and directly upgraded us to the main building, giving us a better stay experience.
Hygiene: OK
Service: Basically, there are no problems when staying in the main building. If you come to the villa area and several other buildings, you need to wait for the shuttle bus to have breakfast, ski, or soak in hot springs. You probably have to be more patient.

It's really great~ Our family of four also brought pets~ When we entered the resort, we asked the front desk if we could bring pets. The service staff was very enthusiastic and professional in arranging a pet room, and also arranged two adjacent rooms for convenience. Many, I added WeChat at the front desk, the WeChat response was very timely and I am very satisfied! Special thanks and praise to Liu Yang, Li Cong, Jin Xuezhe, and Sun Lianqing! Thank you all for your hard work! By the way, the Italian restaurant on the first floor is also delicious! The next day my itinerary was to go straight to Changbai Mountain on the west slope. Unexpectedly, the staff directly sent me the navigation address and process. I liked it so much!

msg:Environment: The environment is super good, with beautiful scenery and fresh air. The location is a bit remote. If you don't have a car, you can only move within the hotel. Taking a taxi is inconvenient and expensive.
Room: Very beautiful. We were upgraded to a suite for free. It was a very large room with 2 bathrooms.
Breakfast: The reviews said the breakfast was not good, so I was worried before coming here. After eating it, I thought it was okay. It was no problem to feel full. There really isn't much variety. There were very few people on the last day, and breakfast was changed to a set meal. However, I felt that I enjoyed more services at breakfast and the food was good.
Fun: Many items are given away. The best thing is that you can soak in hot springs for free every day. The children are very happy. There is also a UTV that is driven once a day, three times in total. My husband and kids both love to play.
Service: The hotel has airport pick-up and drop-off services. Master Jin came to pick us up on time. The car is big and comfortable. Master Jin is warm and humorous and has a very good service attitude👍

msg:The original ecological environment of Luneng Resort is really beautiful. Compared with Wanda, it is more original and natural.
The hotel's environment and facilities are average and have no highlights;
Breakfast is worth complaining about. The restaurant space is small, there are many people, and the food cannot be complimented. This is the first time I have to queue up for a cup of coffee. Does not match the advertised Italian meal;
Service: Not up to standard for this type of hotel. An important point to mention is that after we checked in at the front desk on the day we opened the room, the front desk staff informed us of the hotel package usage details. Most of the time, they introduced how they could help order, how to order, and what Chinese dinners to order, which were more detailed. We asked where the room was, and the reply we got was "Go to the right when going out." It's better to go to the right when going out. Let us take the children outside the door on the right side of the lobby to enjoy the north wind and feel overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery in the distance. You may have said this inadvertently, but as far as the hotel industry is concerned, even homestay services are inferior.

There are three rooms, each room has a bathroom, and the price is suitable. The price is 3140 during the summer peak season, which is more suitable than a standard room. This place is very close to Wanda Resort and the airport, only half an hour. A butler will contact you in advance to ask if you want to be picked up. But it is very far from the high-speed rail station, a 2-hour drive. For going to Tianchi, it is close to the west slope, the south slope is OK, and the north slope is farther. The rides inside, the UTV off-road vehicle, are quite fun, but I haven’t had time to experience anything else. The whole yard environment is very good, but it is convenient to have a car to go out and play.

msg:When visiting Changbai Mountain, between Wanda and Luneng, we still chose the latter. We traveled quietly. The environment is really amazing. When you drive from the hotel's main entrance to the lobby, you will pass by a bridge. Under the bridge is the Songhua River. The scenery on both sides of the bridge is like an oil painting. The late autumn in the North is so charming. I booked a family suite through an agent on Ctrip. Due to the agent's mistake, I actually checked into the advantage suite on October 2. After getting in touch with Ctrip customer service, customer service Tongtong immediately helped communicate and mediate. Due to the double festival, there was no family suite available, and Ctrip would compensate. The room includes free entertainment items such as hot springs, children's play areas, and SUV racing. The Italian restaurant in the hotel is small and exquisite. During the double holidays, hundreds of people dine at the same time, which makes the experience very bad. Although the hotel has opened a private room on the second floor as a breakfast area, most food is only available on the first floor, and only some staple foods, drinks, and fruits are provided on the second floor. It's really inconvenient to have to run up and down to have breakfast. In addition to the hotel's restaurant, there are not many hotel options in the food street, and there are no dedicated coffee shops. Because the hotel rooms do not provide coffee (nor instant coffee), they only provide tea bags for single servings. I asked about room service and was told that it only provides single servings. It's really inconvenient for us who drink coffee every day. I hope the hotel can improve. On the day of check-in, the child had diarrhea and soiled the toilet. After receiving the call, the customer service quickly arranged for a waiter to come and clean it up. Thank you very much.

msg:The hotel's location is unique and the natural scenery is very good.
But breakfast was eaten with a plate, and it took 10 minutes to find the plate. There is a sense of crowding around at the vegetable market.
The front desk checked in and arranged a parent-child room without asking. It may be a childlike thing for children, but it is really inconvenient for couples to travel. Children's toys occupy most of the room.
The shuttle bus to the gift project runs every 25 minutes, and only a few people can take one trip.
I asked the hotel staff if they had any contingency measures when the passenger flow increased during the National Day holiday. They were vague and did not receive a reply.
There was only one hot spring service staff. When I came out with a wet swimsuit in one hand and a dry bath towel in the other, I wanted a plastic bag to put my clothes in. The service staff said: Just leave it there, you can take it. Those who didn’t know better thought she was the eldest sister who traveled with me.
The only good thing is that the butler assigned to us arranged a special car to send us there after receiving our feedback.
But the overall experience I can only say is not worth 1700

msg:Lightning protection! ! I finally have time to write some real reviews! !
Let’s talk about the service first: messy and poor!
①The room type is not good! I called the hotel in advance to tell them what room type requirements I had. I said it would be fine if the view was better. Finally, we arranged a recessed room, and the balconies of the rooms on both sides could directly see into our room.
②The processing procedures are chaotic! When we arrived at the front desk on the day of check-in, we were told that we needed to contact a car to pick us up when we arrived at the villa area. As a result, we waited for more than half an hour and no one called us. In the end, I asked a few people before I got on the bus.
③Poor service! I booked a room for two nights, but when I brushed my teeth the second night, I didn’t have a toothbrush? After contacting the front desk, it was delivered.
④The sound insulation is extremely poor! ! ! ! Difference! ! !
I thought the experience would be better, but the soundproofing turned out to be extremely poor. I could clearly hear the sound of the TV next to the bedside. It was like this every day, and I couldn't rest well.
⑤What’s even more outrageous is that the balance was confiscated by the front desk when I arrived at the store. I thought the platform deducted it directly from the bank card bound to me. As a result, half an hour after leaving the store, the front desk phone told me that I could only go to the front desk to pay. Later, I transferred it to them via WeChat. After the whole process, the experience was really bad! ! It cost 5,700 yuan for two nights and about 2,800 yuan for one night. It was the worst time I spent money and did not enjoy the service and accommodation at the same price.
I called later and said I was sorry and asked for compensation, but I said no. It was not compulsory and I said I wanted compensation and a 10% discount. What’s the difference of 600? I have to write a true review to be worthy of my mood during those two days!
Facilities: General
Hygiene: average
Environment: It’s not convenient to go anywhere. You need to call a taxi and you can’t wait for a long time.
Service: Poor, messy

I originally thought that a twin bed room would be larger in size, but I was shocked when I stepped into the room. It was a twin bed suite 😃; the layout of the room is very reasonable, there is a sink near the cooking table near the entrance, and there is a four-bed suite in the room. Seat dining table, sofa, balcony, and of course a toilet. The bathroom area is also large, and it is very convenient to have a clothesline. The whole room has floor heating, so people who are afraid of the cold are not afraid at all.
spare parts
Toothbrushes, combs and other disposable supplies are complete. There are six bottles of water in the room, probably because the air is dry and you need to drink more water. This is much better than the two bottles of water in urban hotels.
landscape
The hotel is located in Luneng Resort Resort, 20 minutes by car from Changbai Airport and 1 hour and 20 minutes from the high-speed railway station. The natural oxygen bar in summer is enchanting in winter with its silver covering, the trees in autumn are full of autumn colors, and the mountains and mountains are only in the sunset. Nature has its own beauty, and it is the best color master.
Serve
Because it was an itinerary decided on a temporary basis, I called the front desk to see if I could arrange a pick-up after I made the reservation on the same day (although the terms require a one-day notice in advance), but the front desk was very happy to arrange it; the little brother who picked up the airport sent me a text message in advance to help Take the luggage and pick it up smoothly. Since the hotel is in the off-season, the included breakfast is delivered to the room, which not only eliminates waste, but also saves time, and one serving is enough. The restaurant service is also very good, especially the restaurant manager Carey, because it is inconvenient to buy things, I keep asking if there is anything I haven’t brought. I can contact her; it’s great to make friends while traveling!
Be sure to stay longer next time to feel the nature

msg:It was the first family trip to Changbai Mountain, flying directly from Fujian to Harbin. After visiting the Ice City, the train transferred to Changbai Mountain, first to the North Slope (from the train station), and then to the West Slope (closer to the airport).
Luneng is located in Xipo. At that time, Xipo also considered Wanda and CM, and finally chose Luneng out of comprehensive consideration of appearance and raising a baby.
In terms of environment, there is nothing wrong with Luneng's self-proclaimed little Switzerland. This year, it is Disney's anniversary celebration, and there are cooperative castle snow sculptures, etc. Luneng in the snow under the fireworks is simply a fairy tale town. ! !
In terms of matching, I have to give a thumbs up to Luneng's new EP! Similar to CM's GO, the team has just been established and is still very enthusiastic. There was no children's stage show on the day of check-in, but there was an extra show for the two babies. Just for this point, I will give 100 points! Children's Paradise Xingqi baby has won the hearts of children. Each baby is only over 60, and they also help to take care of them😂 Fully set aside coffee time for parents😀
The ski resort is enough for Xiaobai, but there is one thing to note: Luneng Ski Resort does not have a night course, and it ends at 15:00! We arranged to come to Xipo at the last stop, so that we could catch the plane the next day, but the check-in day was already past, so we had to get up early the next day and take the baby to experience it. We only need to go to the venue for snow suits and snow goggles. You can rent it, and the ski equipment will be provided for free. For Xiaobai, it will be much better to hire a coach. If you don’t ski, you can see Changbai Mountain by the cable car. Even if you take the cable car, the children will be very happy😁
In terms of facilities, it is not a new hotel after all, and there are still some minor problems, but the service wins. I booked a family suite, and it was almost 4 o'clock on the day of check-in. The room was still not cleaned up. I upgraded the villa type, but the sanitation was still relatively sloppy. I asked my aunt to help mop the floor again.
To sum it up is:

Accommodation: The ultimate suite has one bedroom and one living room, two bathrooms, the area is quite large, and the inside is also very new
The front desk staff Gao Yang and Gu Yunfei are very nice and considerate. They helped to change to a room with a nice view, and also helped to deliver the luggage. They would also take the initiative to ask if they could meet any needs.
Living in Luneng Switzerland in the off-season is really cost-effective! !

After staying for 5 nights, all problems were solved in a timely and efficient manner, so I am very satisfied with the service of the hotel. Thank you Mr. Liu at the front desk for taking the initiative to join us on the first day. I am very satisfied with all the help provided by WeChat, and the restaurant of the hotel is also very satisfied, whether it is the meal in the morning, or the restaurant waiters Chen Lu and Xing Yan who provide us with warm service every day when we enter the restaurant. Thank you, every dinner We basically eat in the hotel restaurant, because we think it is very good, whether it is Chinese or Western style, braised pork Northeast bone meat pizza, and the green salad that the chef made for us on the 10th dinner. My baby loves it very much, and it goes well with it. The ingredients are also fresh. Then our room was arranged to face the snow field. During the day, the sun ☀️ filled the whole room and it was very comfortable, and the comfort of the bed was also satisfactory. The only downside was that the off-white sofa in the living room needed to be cleaned. More training on greeting etiquette, I believe it will add points to the hotel's service

It's really slow to call a car to pick up someone, and it takes half an hour for him to start. The breakfast in the hotel was so poor that I was shocked when I went in. I have never seen such an expensive hotel, and the breakfast has as many things as the express hotel. The hotel restaurant has no service at all, and the food is unpalatable. The dishes were all served, but the cutlery, plates and water hadn't been served yet, so I didn't think about giving them, they were all begging. The snow scene of the hotel is indeed beautiful, but that's all.

It is commendable that the breakfast is better than expected, not very rich but better than boutique hotels; and even though it is so cold, the room can be cleaned every day.

I lost my camera at the ski resort and thought I could get it back, but later I realized that I was naive. The monitoring and everything are just decorations. The staff are used to lost items and said that it is useless even if they call the police, although they told themselves before going. Don't expect too much service, but the sense of security, quality and service corresponding to this price are really disappointing.

In addition, the hotel’s epidemic prevention shouts in the lobby, wear a mask and will not take you. Just go out, don't check in, don't come in. It seems that wearing a mask wherever you go should be a warm reminder. No one will not do it maliciously. Please understand that people are too busy. I understand! But if you don’t have such a large capacity to receive guests, why do you book so many rooms? You reminded me to put on my mask and you sat there with the mask pulled under your chin? The breakfast was like a long banquet in the countryside, and we had to share a table (the dishes were few and of poor quality). The suite we booked was not one of those group purchases on **. When I talked to the next door, I almost knew the password to his safe. I called the front desk for the room phone number. I couldn't get through to the customer service center. I couldn't get through to the room phone. I called the front desk from my mobile phone. I asked why your room phone automatically cut off after a few rings and couldn't get through. The front desk said, didn't you call me? The price of a five-star hotel and the experience of staying in a hotel in town. I wanted to come and watch the World Cup. I thought the TV in the room was coded. Business is so good. Why don’t you just put it in your pocket and not renovate it? I have stayed in so many hotels and this is the first time I feel like staying in a dormitory.

The room is very big and spacious, the bed is also big, the bedding needs to be further improved, not enough for five-star standard.

The view from the balcony of the bedroom and living room is super nice, looking out to the snow field woodland, lush and seductive, it is worth a vacation.

You can also go camping, biking, and mountain biking nearby, and the weather is fine and fun

msg:An unforgettable experience in the cool summer of Changbai Mountain beyond expectations
It is a rare opportunity to escape to Changbai Mountain in Northeast China during the summer vacation, and choosing a Swiss brand hotel under Accor Group is really an unforgettable experience.
The hotel is located in the Luneng Resort. Compared with the Changbai Mountain Wanda Tourist Resort, which was developed in the early days, it looks more secluded. As an Accor Platinum member, although I did not pass the official website, it was limited to a 65-square-meter villa with a big bed and free delivery. For the courtesy of the executive lounge, I really appreciate the warm and patient service at the front desk, and especially praise the front desk manager July for his personalized service and introduction to the surrounding area of the hotel;
The hotel is about a 20-minute drive from Changbaishan Airport. There are buses to the ancient city, Jinjiang Wooden House Village, Changbai Mountain West Scenic Area, etc. The hotel belongs to a Swiss brand. The entire architectural style and surrounding environment are very Swiss. Introducing the virgin forest of Changbai Mountain, quiet and peaceful, outdoor Taoyuan, blending into nature, cool summer, stunned, really in a certain Swiss town, if you are not afraid of cold and like skiing, it is highly recommended to stay here, then you can wait for winter Now, the average temperature in summer is 20-24 degrees, which is very suitable for summer vacation. The hotel is also a pet-friendly hotel, equipped with pet supplies. The hotel also has a number of children and adults venues, covering a number of sports facilities, all in person, feel the summer in Changbai activities, it is worth going to escape the heat this summer;
The rooms are simple, clean and comfortable. The villa rooms have independent balconies, and the view from the window can be seen. The wooden houses in front of you, the top of Changbai Mountain in the distance, and the surrounding mountains and fields have a panoramic view. Of course, if you stay in winter, you can also enjoy the snow-capped artistic conception on the top of the mountain. The room is very spacious and bright, the walls of the room are all spliced with original ecological wood, the furniture is also made of raw wood, and the whole room is full of reassuring wood aroma, very close to nature, really quite Swiss;
It's a little regrettable that there is no buffet in the evening, but you must taste the food and wine of Changbai Mountain in this hotel, especially the local wine of Changbai Mountain, which can be experienced in the red bar. Here, I nominated and praised the chef, Nie Tianhao, helped me make it. The special Northeastern cuisine is really refreshing and very Northeastern. Manager Guo also recommended to me about the special products of Changbai Mountain and the tasting of local special wines;
I hope to have the opportunity to take a Swiss-style summer vacation trip to Changbai Mountain.

Sit and wait for the snow to come here to ski⛷
The traffic is not very convenient, but it's okay to come by car. It would be better if there is a water world like Wanda in the future.

The room layout is perfect and it feels like home. When you open the door, you can see the endless mountains, and the natural oxygen bar makes people linger! The overall style is elegant and yet sentimental, and the service is thoughtful, making people extremely comfortable. Thanks to Shirley, Xiao Cui, Master Yao who picked up the airport, and the little brothers who delivered the meals, a very pleasant trip! My first visit to Jilin left a very good impression on me! The people here are warm and hospitable, treat outsiders kindly, and are caring and considerate like family! Although it's a little regret that I didn't see the beauty of Changbai Mountain Tianchi, I will definitely come back to make up for this regret!

If you have the opportunity to ski again, you will definitely choose here!
I will highly recommend it to friends who need it!

However, the hotel responded quickly and immediately changed a room…
I hope that this situation will not occur in the future... People who are tossing about changing rooms very late turn their backs on their horses...
The entire resort is built in the mountains, and the environment is very good. The children of the amu*****t projects presented by the hotel had a great time. There were not as many people in Wanda, but the experience was much better. But there are very few food choices in Luneng Resort... Only one barbecue and one dumpling restaurant are still open in the commercial street, and the doors of other shops are closed... I hope Luneng can quickly open up the commercial street... This will make it more convenient for tourists.

There are many amu*****t facilities around the hotel, and there are also shuttle buses, which are very convenient. It is a good place for family travel. After a few days, the deepest impression is that the hotel service staff are very enthusiastic, from the pick-up driver to the front desk manager Tian Lei to the restaurant's Zhang Xinyan, they are responsive and warm service, thank you 🙏 But there are still problems in the operation and management of the hotel, and the breakfast is really average , the variety is less and the quality is not high, and the food is not replenished in time when there are many people. The cleaning of the guest rooms is not timely or thorough. It is simply mopping the floor, but the requests will be resolved in time. It can be seen that they are very busy. It may be that the number of service personnel cannot keep up with the sudden increase in passenger flow. Hope the next stay can be improved

msg:I have always wanted to come to Changbai Mountain to play, but I haven't come for a long time because of the epidemic and busy work, and finally I have time this year. After doing my homework, I finally chose this hotel. As a resort hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the city and leisure and slow life, this hotel is really good. First of all, the entire Luneng resort area is very large, and the natural environment is really nothing to say. You can overlook Changbai Mountain and integrate into nature. It's really great, and the environment exceeds five stars. The service staff is really warm and considerate. Whether it is the receptionist or the front desk at check-in, they are very warm and considerate. They are really good. The waiters and chefs of the restaurant are also very warm and thoughtful. Some picky people do their best to satisfy, and here's a thank you to the hotel staff. Finally, let's talk about the hotel's supporting resort projects, hotel facilities, and hygiene. The supporting entertainment, because of the rain, did not fully experience it. It is a pity that I will experience it again next time. The hotel facilities are generally good, although some need to be strengthened, I believe it will get better and better in the future. In terms of hygiene, it is basically possible, and occasional flaws are inevitable. After all, in such a natural environment, mosquitoes are inevitable, and I believe that there will be more and more appoin**ents.
This is the first time I have written so many reviews, I hope it will be helpful to those who plan to choose a hotel.
In short, this stay was very pleasant, and I will choose to stay again next time. I hope the hotel can get better and better and make persistent efforts!

The lady who checked in was kind enough to introduce me to the contents of the summer benefits. The breakfast time and location were very professional. The concierge also helped me deliver my luggage to the room. The first impression was very good! The weather outside is very good, very comfortable, a leisure summer resort, allowing me to experience a slow-paced life! The hotel's shuttle bus runs every half an hour, and it's good to go around by car. In short, it is worth recommending and will come again in winter!

Second, the hygiene is very rubbish. I have relatively high requirements for hygiene. The resort's original hotel is clean and very unique. It's located at the very back of the resort. As for Swissotel, everything from the lobby to the rooms feels dirty.
Third, there is basically no food around. During the Spring Festival, even the pedestrian street next to it didn’t have many restaurants open. The one I eat the most here is Burger King.
Fourth, it’s inconvenient to go anywhere. You can only rent a car during the Spring Festival.

msg:#Want to stay at the hotel for N times Swiss Hotel Resort in Changbai Mountain Luneng Resort @lvxiao exploration #where to play in winter #first experience of skiing

🗓Itinerary:
I am from January 5th to 9th, and I live in the king-bed room in the villa area of the Swiss Resort Hotel. Tell me about my real feelings

🏨Hotel environment:
🛏 Room facilities: Let's talk together I'm lazy
🖼 Restaurant environment:
There are floor heating, humidifiers, heaters, and all kinds of equipment are complete. It is not as broken as it says on the Internet, but the service attitude really needs to be strengthened. The daily breakfast is still very rich, and the daily snow ticket is sent to the wild motorcycle experience villa area. You can get the snow card to refund the deposit. It is very convenient to take a shuttle bus, it is better to take a walk. The scenery is good. It takes five minutes and ten minutes to walk to the edge of the snow field. You can see the beautiful view pavilion. You can see the kaws on the road. There is also a supermarket barbecue shop, iron pot stewed hot pot dumpling shop. very satisfied
There is a pair of sika deer in the hotel that can take pictures for 24 hours. We live in a bathtub. After skiing and soaking in the snow, we go to the balcony to freeze our hair. fun

🌟Highlight Features:
Luneng Ski Resort is very friendly to novice Xiaobai and junior and intermediate skaters, and it is definitely enough. The snow quality is good, the noodles are snowy, there are very few people, I feel that it is enough, but it is almost 3:30 in the morning when the night show ends in the afternoon [Cry] But I don’t think the coach is as reliable as Wanda’s and the cost is too high. Look at your own bargaining skills, you feel that you must ask for a reliable posture to get started, you must be correct, and it will be easy to change blades later

✅Must experience:
drifting! It's very fun, but you have to wear waterproof and snowproof gloves, otherwise you will have to wear their fishing pants and shoes. I recommend your own ski suits. It's basically no problem. It will be cold. Wear more
We were lucky, it snowed heavily before we went, so the smog was beautiful! About 40 minutes of rafting, our own tickets, less than 200 people, have a car to pick up
Basically that's it
very happy journey

Worst hotel ever stayed in. Service is also poor. More than 1500 rooms are not as good as 3 stars.

msg:I have been too lazy to write reviews. I only write reviews if I have a particularly bad experience, but I would like to praise this hotel. The service attitude is very good from beginning to end, and it is recommended to stay in a cabin in the villa area. It feels very good and very good. Unique, there is no such room type in Wanda Resort. The refrigerator, floor heating, and software facilities are all very good, and the ski slopes in Luneng are very suitable for beginners. Although I have been in Luneng for three days, I ate at the nearest "Yuanxiang Lake" every day, but The food there is delicious, and none of them step on the thunder. There is another reason for me to write a good review: I lost an earring, so that I don't know where it is, I can only ask each hotel one by one, and finally I asked Luneng, and the aunt in the guest room helped me keep the front desk Amy first. Time is sent to me, and it makes me feel precious to have it back. The hotel is very user-friendly in all aspects. The first stop was Luneng Resort, and then I went to Wanda Resort. The Wanda ski trail was also good, but the Hyatt Regency I stayed at was the biggest failure of this trip. The hardware and software services were useless. , Friends who see this review here can avoid staying at Hyatt. In general, I think Swiss Hotel Luneng is worth the cost-effectiveness. Thanks also to Amy and the guest room aunt.

There are a lot of people at check-in, but I still want to praise Zhang Sen and Mengmeng by name. I recommend a reliable driver and also introduce that we are fun and delicious. Drink, and also very helpful during checkout! The Swiss Hotel is great, but the Luneng Ski Resort is not very friendly to those who don't have ski equipment. I hope everyone will be mentally prepared in advance. The ski resort and the hotel are managed separately!

msg:Before coming to Changbai Mountain, I had been hesitating whether to go to Wanda or Luneng, because at night I kept saying that Luneng's service attitude needs to be improved.

Later, I saw that the snow field is a paradise for beginners, and I came here without hesitation. It turned out that the bad reviews that Xiaohongshu said did not exist.

First of all, the room type was upgraded to a suite, which is very comfortable!
In addition, Zhang Sen and Mengmeng at the front desk recommended us a driver who was highly praised and helped us to delay the check-out time.

The front desk staff are very polite and patient, but it may be that there are too many people when checking in, and it is really a fly in the oin**ent that it is too late to register and even need to wait in the cold wind.

Another point of complaining: landing nucleic acid is necessary, but there is only one doctor who does nucleic acid, and then he gets off work at three or four o'clock. So the next morning when I arrived in the afternoon was basically wasted in queuing to register for nucleic acid, and then there were no snowboards and snowshoes when I went to the ski resort.

I feel that the nucleic acid process needs to be improved!

In conclusion, aside from these little problems... Swissotel Luneng gave Ski Xiaobai the best accommodation and skiing experience!

Zhang Wei, the front desk supervisor, took the initiative to contact in advance and made arrangements in time after arrival. Since the room is very convenient in all aspects of the main building, and the room is quite large, as someone mentioned that there is no problem with hot water and parking, the 100-liter electric water heater should be heated to 75 degrees. There is no problem for two or three people to wash, and there is also an indoor parking lot, but it is relatively small. But some are not satisfactory. Hygiene, some services, and the enthusiasm of the staff. If you are learning to ski, it is very worthwhile. It is close to the snow field, and the snow trail is suitable for beginners.

The sika deer downstairs is very cute. The little brother at the hotel bar gave the baby the last carrot to feed the deer, and he was very happy.
And two little bunnies.
The baby can play in the snow for an afternoon if you throw it outside. You don't need to worry. The old mother is sitting in the hotel and brushing her mobile phone.
Come back from skiing or outside playing in the snow with a whole cup of hot chocolate, warm.

The service staff is probably not enough because of the Spring Festival. But you have to wait to get in and out of the car; the breakfast is exquisite and delicious, and the materials used are very good, but the service is still average; the snow field is right at the door, which is very convenient. It would be perfect if there were kitchen utensils in the wooden house. The surrounding businesses are not well developed, so I worry about eating every day.

The Luneng Ski Resort is very suitable for beginners. Wanda has never been there, but it looks quite steep in the distance. I originally went to Wanda in two days. Luneng lived very comfortably. As a southerner, the floor heating in the north was really comfortable, haha. Luneng Ski Resort has no specified time for unlimited skiing in one day. In Luneng Ski Resort, Swissotel Luneng is very convenient.
🔔Service: Every employee is very good, especially Iris Cheng, the front desk manager. I met her every day during the five days I lived here, and she was really responsive. One night we wanted hot food (takeaway), the manager asked us to find the kitchen to heat it up. The little girl in the restaurant upstairs was very enthusiastic. She had been hot for a long time. She was thin and did not wear glasses, and her height was not more than 155. You should ask her name and praise her by name, otherwise I am sorry for her being so enthusiastic. Our family of 7 people has truly achieved vacation mode. If I have the opportunity to go to Jilin, I will still choose Luneng Switzerland

On the whole, I am very grateful to the thoughtful staff in the hotel and resort ski resort. Because I needed two nucleic acid tests in the middle, I needed to coordinate the time to travel to and from the hotel and the ski resort. Although the distance was not very far, the staff still gave special and timely support. Zhang Wei and Sss from the hotel were the first to add me on WeChat to answer any questions. In the past three or four days, I saw three young ladies at the front desk who also enthusiastically introduced me how to receive and refund the snow card and other procedures, and went for me Skiing is convenient. On the last day, Li Baojun, the master of the shuttle and the contact person in charge, was going to change the itinerary to go on a tour in the west of Changbai Mountain. In terms of accommodation and travel during the epidemic prevention period, I praised their services. Without the services of resorts and Swissotel, I could not have done so smoothly. Thanks!

We originally booked a common room, but when we arrived, we suddenly wanted to change to a villa room. We were afraid that it would be very troublesome or impossible to change. Later, Iris, the front desk manager, immediately helped us to deal with it after hearing it, and someone drove us to the villa. District, and Miss Iris's attitude throughout the whole process is really very good, anyway, the overall experience is very good!

The chalet in the villa area opened the door and it was the snow. Taking pictures was really good, and when we got to the meal time to go out to eat, the car call came very quickly. This experience was really nice💕

It is highly recommended for the little sisters who like to take pictures to come here, take pictures while playing, it is really amazing! But try to shoot at noon time, it's really too cold at night!

The overall configuration experience of an apar**ent-type hotel is a bit too old-fashioned, not as good as The pattern of the four seasons, the room is small and smelly, and the toiletries are also very general, and it feels not as good as the configuration of the whole season. What bothered me the most was that the floor heating in the room would not work. Another hotel actually used a domestic water heater. Halfway through the wash, there was no hot water. I called the front desk and told me to wait for the hot water, but I waited for more than half an hour. It was 27, 28 degrees, and the weather was more than minus 20 degrees. After waiting for more than half an hour with wet hair, I couldn't wait and went to the front desk to change to another room to take a shower. Hygiene is also very poor, in short, will not come again!

There is no business, no complicated people, some are just simple, hospitable, warm, and I met good people along the way. After getting off the plane, I called the hotel temporarily to pick up the plane. The hotel did not say no because of my temporary absence. After about 20 minutes, a master contacted me. This person is Master Yin, and he has a very good attitude and a special tone. Kind, let me, a girl who travels alone, feel the enthusiasm of a different place, take the initiative to help me carry my luggage, and let me play more in the snow while waiting for other flights, saying that I will leave after a while, Yin The enthusiasm of the master ➕ the white snow that day made me feel that this journey is not lonely. After my consultation, Master Yin recommended me the route of my itinerary in the past few days, and Master Yin is very friendly to every guest. With a golden smile on his face, he answered everyone's questions one by one with his enthusiastic tone. Often it is because a person thinks the city is beautiful. On the snowy day, Master Yin, with his skillful and down-to-earth driving skills, came to the Swiss Hotel I was looking forward to. The blue sky, white snow, and white clouds seemed so superfluous. It took a long time to check in. There were a lot of guests that day, and the front desk also handled it seriously. Because I was on a birthday, I explained the situation to the front desk, and the front desk also helped me earnestly. The room also gave me a children's room full of childlike interest, and I lived happily in it. Quiet, quiet, other than that, my heart seems to be calm and I don't know what else to say.
I clean the room very carefully every day for breakfast. After cleaning, my aunt will ask if there is anything else I need to do, which is very polite.
The breakfast is also very rich, every day breakfast is different.
The ski resort is very friendly to me, a novice, but I felt that there were fewer shoes, and there was no size that I could wear at that time.
UTVs are good because the thick snow is enjoyable
Amu*****t park is also great
The unforgettable and pleasant 4 days came quickly, but the blue sky and white snow of Changbai Mountain and every good person I met were deeply imprinted in my mind.
I wish Master Yin and every good person good health, peace and joy in 2022, and good people have a safe life!

msg:The hotel’s hardware facilities can be said to be unique, facing the ski field, which is why I did not hesitate to take my children for four nights. As a result, from the beginning of my stay, this hotel has continuously lowered my understanding of five-star hotels.
Luneng and Switzerland two hotel brands can be said to be well-known. They have stayed in hotels under these two brands many times during business trips in Shandong and Shanghai. Especially in Shanghai Hongan Switzerland, I lived there for more than 2 years. So when booking, I was full of expectations for this Changbai Mountain ski trip.
But as someone said before, the operator of this hotel probably misunderstood the Nordic style. What I want to say is that minimalist style is not simple style. Simplicity is not about reducing service to nothing.
For a room that costs 2800 yuan a night, the water bar only has Nestlé 3-in-1 coffee, not even a teaspoon. I put two bottles of Watson's soda and wrote it seriously as a welcome gift. I wrote to the hotel in advance to take the child in. There was nothing related to the child, no slippers, not to mention the toiletries. When checking in, the two elder sisters at the front desk kept complaining about each other, saying why the other party didn't know about the suite tickets and charges.
There were still many service details. I couldn’t contact the hotel’s reservation depar**ent and customer service depar**ent at the time, so we reported it to Ctrip, and Ctrip’s customer service helped us to cancel the four-day itinerary in advance. A ski suit was dropped when I left, and there was no one to notify the hotel after 24 hours. The phone call to the hotel is still unanswered as always. When I went back to the hotel front desk to pick it up, I finally met the manager on duty and told him about the situation. The other party said that he asked me to add him on WeChat and give him five working days to confirm what went wrong in the service.
The housekeeping depar**ent cleans up the room and finds what the customer left. Does it take five working days to solve the problem if it does not notify the customer in time? Unheard of five-star hotel service.
I feel that this hotel is mainly for large groups, and the individual guest prices are set high in order to highlight the discounts they give to groups. Therefore, if the individual customers book according to the online price, they will be taken advantage of.
If you don't want to bring your children to be blocked by a hotel service, I sincerely suggest not to consider this place. For nearly 3,000 yuan a night, are so many hotels in the Wanda system not fragrant? Is the outdoor hot spring of Zhihe not fragrant? Isn't Pullman fragrant?
The attached picture shows you the situation of the small water bar and toiletries in the suite for nearly 3,000 yuan a night.

There is a sense of being in Switzerland and Northern Europe. Rime landscape. The room is warm with floor heating, and is additionally equipped with a humidifier ~ facilities TV, bathing facilities, etc. are the latest to reach the high standards of Swiss hotels as always. The room service is also very attentive. It is convenient to travel by shoveling snow at the door immediately after it has snowed! It is worth staying again and the drone flying is also very convenient. Suitable for family trips!

The ski resort started on the 18th. This ski resort is very suitable for beginners and is very small and fresh. The service is very attentive and considerate. The service staff Annie Liu Xuehui, in order to help realize the wish, made a phone call all night to help contact, which made me feel the Dong's favor and at the same time be very attentive. Not to mention too much, Treasure Hotel, the highest price-performance ratio in Changbai Mountain!

The wooden structure house is upgraded to a villa free of charge. I am very happy. The rooms are clean, with underfloor heating, refrigerators, induction cookers, and large electric heaters in each room, so there is no need to worry about heating problems, it is very warm. The large balcony is very comfortable. Bring the children here to relax, too comfortable, reluctant to go, staying for an extra day. It is very suitable for taking pictures indoors or outdoors. The wooden style, the pictures are very beautiful, the style is unique, and it is very good. The cleaning service at the front desk and guest room is very friendly. There are not many types of breakfast, but it tastes good. There is a small pedestrian street, there is a barbecue hot pot restaurant, a dumpling restaurant, and a supermarket, there are not many choices. By car, you can drive to a town more than 20 kilometers away for dinner, which is quite lively. Overall, I recommend this place very much, it's very comfortable and relaxing.

I didn’t do everything in place. I especially complained about the breakfast. It was simple and Chinese without bringing it. A little bit of Swiss 🇨🇭 flavor. The scenic spot is beautiful, lacking a few cows and cow bells. The overall management level needs to be improved, lacking some soul.

Thank you for their contribution! The hotel environment is very good, the Italian restaurant on the first floor tastes good, and the environment is great. Children like the rainbow slide, you can swim, archery, and experience off-road vehicles🚙, and the three deer are very cute and are super willing to eat fruits. You can see the main peak of Changbai Mountain when you reach the top of the mountain.

There are two rooms and one living room, and the living is super cool. The second is that there is an induction cooker to eat hot pot, which is great. After experiencing it, the hotel’s housekeeper, Mengmeng, is also very enthusiastic. He always responds to requests every day. Every day I ask for a car. I have to trouble her. The voice is also very sweet. When I left, I also delivered ginseng to every room. The hotel staff are also very helpful. Polite and warm. The slopes here are suitable for children, so you can come again in winter. The only drawback is that the road has not been opened yet, and you have to detour around. It is inconvenient to buy and eat. There are no restaurants in the hotel, but it is said that it will be more convenient if it is repaired in half a month. A suggestion is that since the wooden house is equipped with an induction cooker and a refrigerator, it should be equipped with a pot and a microwave oven, which is more convenient.

msg:房間設備等都很好
就是入住的時候沒有國內手機
服務人員説會把設施的權益發給我們的司機
結果也沒有，隔天出去玩冰上游戲
他們根本沒有幫我們開通
幸好冰上的大哥幫我們打了電話
確定我們的酒店的客人 先讓我們玩
可是最後也沒有幫我們開通
如果不是遇上好的大哥 我們根本沒辦法享受權益
感覺入住的時候 服務人員有點看不起我們的司機
大呼小叫的特別不禮貌
我們外國來的 看了有點傻眼
希望你們會改進。
滑雪場的人也是 特別不友好
我們還沒開始玩 心情就不好一半了

再來説説魯能瑞士別墅，房間比較大，衞生間有地暖，冰箱裏有飲料可以免費喝，喝完第二天給你繼續補。滑雪場沒有高級道，衹有初中級，對新手比較友好，早上9點營業，9點半過去還是麪條雪道。再推廣一個小帖士：想要美美的照片，可以到滑唄app去尋找自己照片，15塊一張，能接受，甚至可以找到攝影師幫我多拍幾張。
魯能吃的不太行，選擇太少，韓爐村烤肉的一個點菜員，明知道我們就衹有兩大一小的情況下拚命推薦菜，也不説他們的菜量，也不説不夠後面再點，而是一直站你邊上，感覺我們沒點夠。結果上來嚴重吃不下，後面5個人消費300多，我們三人600。

但是度假區也有一些不夠完美的地方 平台送的一些權益有點釣魚消費的意思 譬如説送的射擊去玩的時候小朋友必須購買價值99元的裝備包 進小童樂園必須購買防滑襪 坐全地形utv如果不穿一次性雨衣會濺的一身泥 **訂房贈送的晚餐更不靠譜 就是一個簡餐 一碗炒雞蛋 一碗白菜 一杯飲料就完事了 根本沒法吃 度假區整體還是可以的 人也不多 但是細節上還需要提高 格局略微有點小了

msg:魯能的硬件設施確實比北坡的酒店來的好～
而且如果不是為了看長白山天池而是單純滑雪度假～完全就可以在酒店裡不出去～
因為入住三天兩夜餐飲方面就一直在酒店裡就餐
味道還算不錯～ 但確實品類上稍微少了一些～ 不過價格上雖説不能算性價比很高，可是在度假區裏來看是合理的～
看了很多攻略，很多人給了差評！但還好選擇了魯能，自身的入住體驗，無論是管家，還是教練，還有短駁車司機都十分熱情～滑雪場對於初級滑雪者來説 真的非常友好！設備也乾淨，碼數全～教練簡直是帶娃神器，有了教練，從穿衣到結束，可以全程放飛自我，結束後還有美美的照片～
我遇到的管家benson也很認真！可以説有求必應～我們入住的是別墅家庭房，去温泉去雪場都是大概兩三分鐘～
房間很熱～所以小夥伴不用擔心！如果覺得特別熱，衹要調整一下温度，或者開一下門！就好了～

設施：基本設施很齊全，而且清潔很到位。前台非常利索，雖然人非常多，但是辦理入住的速度很快。
在大堂的意大利餐廳午餐經濟實惠好吃不貴，一個套餐幾十塊，比在小鎮上好吃還便宜。

酒店提供的免費活動非常的多，完全可以不出景區就能玩整天。

另外就是小鎮上的咖啡廳拿鐵很不錯

可是服務實在是跟不上，跑去滑雪，被告知沒有幫我們錄入雪票。。。跑去泡温泉，又説沒我們的訊息。。。不曉得浪費了多少時間！真是氣shi人！
度假村房間很難找，第一天也沒人帶我們去房間，到了幾圈找不到再回到前台，然後主動要求帶我們去房間才有人帶我們去。。作為一家五星級酒店，服務真是有點差！
儘管有管家加微信，但似乎並沒啥幫的上忙的，問我有什麼要求，我説希望床大一點，但也沒給我們升級。。。我説那幫我把雙床拼一下吧，酒店説這個我可以自己拼。。。呵呵好的，自給自足，還是靠自己吧！

msg:在瑞士酒店度假村住了兩晚家庭別墅，整體體驗非常棒。酒店管家丁哥提供了東北人特有的熱情周到的服務與幫助，讓這次特種兵行程更加充實和完美。
設施：家庭別墅裏的大床房是配了浴缸和淋浴，雙床房是單浴缸。地暖非常非常足，雪服隔夜直接烘乾。
衞生：每天保潔打掃，回家就是全新整潔的房間。
環境：和網上照片一樣空降北歐，無論是雪頂木屋，還是不多的人流量，都有一種在國外度假的感覺。白天、傍晚、夜裡都有不同的氛圍感，陽台、別墅區、雪地都非常出片。
服務：管家丁哥不用説，從預訂酒店的第一個諮詢電話起，熱心應答每一個南方小土豆的幼稚問題，詳細解釋酒店的接送機服務和各項遊客權益，多次叮囑不要亂玩被坑，熱心大哥讓人賓至如歸。同時前台也快速響應客房的每一個電話要求，雖然別墅區離前廳較遠，但送水、派車都很及時快速。
4大2小滑雪權益每晚：魯能確實是滑雪新手村，坡道和人流量非常適合新手入門。
4大2小地中海温泉體驗每晚：室外雪中温泉是一定要打卡的項目。
4大2小娛雪權益每晚：項目很多，像個孩子一樣打一場雪仗又有何妨。另有自費的熱氣球可以一覽雪國風光。

主要問題如下：
1⃣️酒店房間隔音巨差：睡在客房裡，隔壁房間客人打噴嚏聊天説話都能聽到。求助酒店給到回覆是讓我們理解木質房型就是隔音不好，對於這樣的回覆，作為消費者也是無奈！
2⃣️酒店管理混亂：我們隔壁客房當晚至少入住6人以上，打牌聊天音樂噪聲此起彼伏，求助酒店客服協調，根本無視我們的投訴，凌晨三點送來耳塞讓我們理解，而不是去制止隔壁客人擾人行為？這波操作也是無語！
3⃣️2024年1月1日凌晨1點15分開始聯繫酒店前台投訴，到凌晨4點半，我們絲毫感受不到酒店的服務，三千多一晚的酒店這樣的服務和設施，幫大家避坑了！千萬別選擇這家酒店！

之前網上看到很多有關於負面的評論所以出發前也有擔心過，但是衝著這個酒店的整體風格設計就沖了
沒想到來這裏住了三天了網上説的一些例如供暖問題、前台聯繫不了的問題並沒有出現.
打電話按0就能聯繫前台，讓他安排車每次都很準時來接，每次外出回來打開門小木屋裡麪的暖氣就特別續命，然後環境真的出片的可能因為我本人喜歡這種風格，氛圍也超棒，晚上基本上都有人買煙花來放。還有管家姜淼服務超級好！還有李耀凱、張雨涵、孫悦.也非常的不錯！下次還想繼續體驗此酒店！

一定要住瑞士酒店！
一定要住瑞士酒店！
一定要住瑞士酒店！
我是想多玩玩的，所以酒店團購在七月份就囤了兩份，這樣可以連住四晚。深度聊聊我的長白山之旅，對於南方人來説，來長白山最最重要的一件事就是玩雪，看雪，滑雪，奔赴一場白色之約。
我實在無法區分是北方人熱情還是酒店服務超一流，用有求必應來形容都覺得詞窮。入住第一天酒店就會安排管家全程服務，❣️劃重點，劉暢劉管家我叫他超人管家，我第一次看到這世界上居然有又帥又無所不能的男人，就沒有他不回覆的消息，就沒有他搞不定的問題，就沒有他辦不到的事情。一開始我説你怎麼都能解決，他説【衹有你想不到…】，我還以為衹是一句玩笑，沒有當真，後面幾天簡直刷新我對【管家服務】四個字的常規認知。隨手一個微信，他就安排的妥妥貼貼，沒有拖延。因為户外確實冷，有時候在户外想馬上回酒店，一個微信，五分鐘！就五分鐘！人已經在車上吹暖氣了。【帥！高！暖！牛！】大概對超人管家的總結以上。還有前台郭蘭英，客服張宇涵，甚至我的滑雪教練我都想寫上大大的好評。
對面就是滑雪場，新手一定要請教練，體驗感會很好，教練會帶着你去你不敢去的地方，看你看不到的風景。
不是瑞士去不起，是長白山瑞士酒店更有性價比！

備註：我在出發前還電話問了酒店雪場和温泉 開了沒，結果到了什麼都沒開。是蠻無奈的 ，但是長白山真的很好玩

早餐沒有座位沒有吃的，盤子杯子全沒有，咖啡機像個玩具一樣過熱壞了，壞了之後竟然就是不再提供咖啡了，連速溶的都沒有。早餐餐廳亂糟糟的堪比菜市場，完全屬於沒有那接待能力硬着頭皮乾的。
房間開了請勿打擾還是有客房服務人員敲門，關鍵還敲錯了門。
辦理入住的前台人員業務不熟，完全不介紹客房權益在哪領取如何領取，到了UTV萌寵樂園什麼的完全是所在工作人員幫忙弄，不是沒有項目就是少一個碼，到一個地方需要給酒店打次電話。
真誠建議貴酒店提升一下作為一個五星級酒店的管理能力。

我謹以此信向您表達我和我全家對您誠摯的感謝！

今天中午，我們全家第一次來長白山魯能華美勝地滑雪場滑雪。由於我們的粗心，將我們全家的證件以及房卡和雪卡不慎遺失在雪場。我們全家遍尋雪場也沒找到時，焦急萬分。懷着最後一線希望，我們到了客服中心。從客服中心我們得知好心的您在滑道上撿到我們證件後，第一時間聯繫雪場客服並交還給我們。

於涵先生，您的善良和熱心讓我們感到温暖和感動。我們全家都是第一次來東北，從您身上，我們深切體會到“東北人都是活雷鋒”，我們全家在此向您表示最誠摯的謝意和祝福！

衷心祝願您的事業和生活一切順利，身體健康，幸福美滿！

此致

敬禮！

説説不足：1.早餐不太行，沒有五星級酒店的感覺，菜品一般。2.基本沒有太多服務。3.洗澡水太惱火了，衹要連着洗必然是冷的。

另外最後一晚我們因為趕飛機搬到機場附近了，特地去看了看另外那家著名度假區，人好多啊。喜歡放空和躺平的朋友，一定要來魯能，來魯能住瑞士別墅沒錯。
特別感謝管家李耀凱，服務周到又有效率。
前台有一位叫王碩的工作人員，需要加強學習，服務態度和語氣較為生硬，與雅高的高品質定位不符。

但是酒店服務不行，入住後房間温度太高，找了服務員一直沒解決，折騰到半夜一點才睡着。後來才知道服務員都是小年輕，對設備不熟，據説要找管家，這服務邏輯一般旅客還真理解不了。
最奇葩的是退房後追着要好評，客服電話打過來，得知不太滿意後也沒問原因直接就掛了，也沒做進一步的解釋。
總體而言，除了前台，酒店服務配不上春節期間五千加的房費。明年試試萬達。

msg:長白山之行特意體驗了魯能瑞士的別墅房和萬達的凱悦。作為每次出行必選五星級酒店的人，感覺魯能瑞士比傳説中好很多，經歷了換房，沒帶充電插頭（因為房間沒有USB充電口），夜送低枕頭，孩子發燒延遲退房等等，所有需求全部滿足。可以感受到每一位工作人員，前台，禮賓，司機，清潔阿姨，都盡心盡力。所以這次給魯能瑞士一個滿分的好評。除了商業街餐飲較弱，中午時間商務車接駁較難，其他基本沒有缺點。繼續保持，來年再會。

酒店周圍配套較少，餐飲的選擇不多。
帶小朋友的遊客很多，酒店沒有體温計🌡️，測量小朋友體温，附近也沒有葯店，對於南方感冒的小朋友很不友好，在這個流感頻發的冬天，缺少考慮了……

🏔️ 酒店的設施一應俱全，無論是滑雪、温泉還是品嚐美食，都能滿足各種需求。而最讓我驚喜的是，這裏的滑雪體驗簡直太棒了！
 
🙌 長白山魯能瑞士酒店的工作人員真正做到了“服務至上”。他們對客人的需求非常敏感，總是能在第一時間提供幫助和建議。無論是幫助安排滑雪設備還是推薦當地的旅遊景點，他們的專業知識和熱情態度讓我的旅程更加完美。
 
總之，如果你也想在長白山度過一段難忘的時光，長白山魯能瑞士酒店絕對是你的不二之選！👍👍👍

酒店的歐式自助早餐從早上7點供應到上午10：30，菜品還可以，不算特別豐盛，但是食材都很新鮮，總體來講中規中矩。酒店旁邊有BurgKing，孩子吃個下午茶啥的還是挺方便，就是關門太早，晚上7點就歇業了。實在不明白，為啥飯點關門。

唯一不滿意的地方就是因為酒店比較新，傢俱還有少許味道，對於不敏感的人羣沒有問題，但是我家隊友對油漆味道非常敏感，聞着一點就過敏，結果還因此發了兩天燒。我屬於正常人羣，就一點事沒有。

相比於Clubmed，我覺得瑞士酒店性價比更好，Clubmed適合有10歲及以下的家庭，大孩子的家庭住clubmed可能會覺得比較吵。

度假村改名了叫華美勝地，我原本還提前關注了魯能瑞士的公眾號想説提前預約一下教練和遊樂項目什麼的，結果公眾號啥都沒有，直到入住時才知道不但酒店改名，連原來的公眾號都廢掉了……前一天在北坡另一個酒店辦入住的時候收到這邊管家的來電，讓她過20分鐘再打來，結果就是沒再收到電話。不能理解為什麼旅遊旺季大巴都不往魯能走，魯能和萬達之間居然也沒有接駁車，要知道萬達好打車，但魯能這邊打車真的很碰運氣啊。
酒店出門右手就是一條小街，便利店餐廳茶飲店洋快餐都有，價格也不算貴喇。
泡温泉要到旁邊Clubmed，報酒店名房間號就可以馬上拿到鑰匙牌，速度很快吶。衹是淋浴間的味道味道有點大，讓人有種不太乾淨的感覺，但聽説男衞生間沒啥異味哦~
酒店本身真的很好，但上面提到的點還是需要改進哦，會再來噠~

口當落日餘暉渲染這個童話世界時，外面已很少會有人走動了。無人打擾，悽美夢幻。浪漫，對這裏來説似乎太簡單了。入夜時分，燈光會亮起，“swissoter”的招牌格外顯眼。若隱若現的木屋和暖黃色燈光，若即若離的雪和被包裹着的樹，好像要過聖誕節了一樣，但就算是一個人的聖誕，也不寡淡。服務超級棒 尤其是管家姜淼！還有李耀凱 張雨涵、孫悦！期待下次入住

        酒店旁邊也有配套的商業美食。在那裡住的還是很方便的。
        總之，這次出遊在這裏吃住都滿意。是一次很愉快的旅遊體驗。

msg:我們是從萬達柏悦酒店離開後想再來魯能度假區來入住相對比一下。首先要肯定度假區內的景色非常好看，但酒店前台的服務態度比不上普通的連鎖酒店，這是和酒店的管理息息相關的。入住第二天讓酒店前台幫我預約一下襬渡車，我們兩個人在大堂等待了約三十分鐘，被告知司機中午去吃飯了，要繼續等待半個小時才可以，與前台詢問原因前台竟告知是因為我們的原因沒趕上上一趟間隔25分鐘的擺渡車，暫且不糾結為什麼一個基本沒人入住的五星級酒店擺渡車需要25分鐘才能坐上，我們明明已經等待超過發車間隔為何不能趕上呢？前台一位女士很牛氣的告訴我我們下來的時候已經過點了，我很氣憤告訴她我手機上都有時間的記錄，如果你們要較真的話可以查詢監控，而且我早就預約好擺渡車了，看到我態度這麼強硬前台才悻悻的不説了話。我打這麼多字衹是想告訴大家，如果可以對服務要求沒有要求的話，也不怕會影響到旅行的心情，才可以考慮入住魯能，萬達度假區要比這好很多。

酒店的電視如果能投屏，晚上在酒店休息那真是太好了。
酒店贈送的特色項目就稍稍遜色了些，可能小孩子會喜歡吧。

msg:酒店的體驗兩極分化非常嚴重，服務人員的服務態度和積極性非常好，酒店大堂小哥辦理入住（3點入住）以及叫接駁車去別墅區的速度都非常快，住了2晚，來來回回將近十次，完全不存在其他評論裏説的叫車倆小時沒人理。別墅大唐餐廳服務員和廚師服務態度更加熱情優秀。整體來説服務水平一流，已經到了可以大概記住名字的地步，服務員徐小棠盧維琪，廚師李明那學龍等等，前台吳姓小哥面對無理取鬧的客人不卑不亢的態度更是讓人印象深刻。

但是，酒店別墅區客房的水平就着實的不着調了。我們第一天住的木屋，地暖完全是壞的，空調還漏水，整個一個冰凍水簾洞，前台聯繫前前後後找了好幾個人來看也沒修好，衹能換了房。木屋的隔音也沒有一般房間好，尤其是上下層，腳步聲還是有一點點的。至於房間外的雪景見仁見智，我覺得一般。

酒店對面就是雪場，除了clubmed就是它離得最近了，早場滑雪非常方便，這點好評。酒店大堂邊上有一個商業街，有零星幾家餐館，還湊合，多待兩天的話就沒得吃了，滑雪間隙填補一下是完全夠的。

msg:1.給小紅薯的姐妹一個真心建議 如果衹是想來木屋雪景照 完全不需要住酒店。因為拍照的景色在度假區裏，度假區誰都可以進來的～住不住酒店根本沒關係。因為性價比太低了。
2.設施：非常一般 跟快捷酒店一個水平
3.服務：很普通不值這個價格 定了三天的酒店 第二天還沒睡醒呢阿姨就敲門進來搞衞生 驚呆了我！
4.下午四點後就沒有滑雪了 天也黑了 也沒什麼吃的 無聊的很！2000多的酒店網絡電視都沒有！
5.還有不要在這平台訂，坑人的平台，兩千五一天的酒店居然不含早餐？就幾個菜麪包又不是啥？而且周邊又沒有其他東西吃。不仔細看，以為肯定含早餐了，垃ji平台！包含的滑雪門票也就390一位，享受了個寂寞。
總結就是不值不值不值不值

設施：套間有電磁爐水壺，但是沒有鍋碗瓢盆，送了水果，獼猴桃蘋果，但是不肯借刀。
陽台門很神奇，玩不來，不能鎖有點不安全
床還挺舒服

服務：一般吧，每個服務員都在搞副業的感覺，加微信，介紹車介紹項目介紹飯店賣東西

衞生：每天收收垃圾，稍微擦擦地，好在瓷磚地面也不怎麼容易臟

環境：好看，瑞士小鎮的感覺，但是周圍不怎麼熱鬧，商業就幾個店，超市和水果店都很貴，貴，貴。外面五塊十塊的臉罩賣58。手掌大的葡萄一小串18。

缺點：1.  6人的別墅衹送2張温泉票，其他要自己花錢購買，連住2晚，每晚送的温泉票也不能在同一天使用，前台服務員非常精明，嚴格照章辦事，不給客户讓一點點利，給人感覺很不好。2. 酒店配套餐飲很少，度假區沒什麼人氣，沒幾個餐廳開的，酒店自帶的意大利餐廳居然沒有西餐，孩子想吃披薩，第一天去餐廳説西餐廚師8點下班了，第二天特意早去，又説西餐廚師辭職了，害的我們衹能開車半小時去萬達度假區吃披薩。

服務：服務真的太差了，第一：我們出門用餐因為要準備餐食需要時間下樓僅十分鐘發現屋內進去了人，之後解釋説查房，蛋他們查房的本子上根本什麼都沒記錄，第二：來了個穿黑色衣服的女士進屋就對我跟我朋友大呼小叫，一直態度強硬沒有道歉的意思，還雙手叉腰眼睛瞪得很大，第三當時一個酒店經理來了也是説話向著自己同事一直否定我們的觀點，我跟我朋友很害怕選擇報警，報警後看了監控警察説選後有兩個人進了我們的房間，之後酒店害怕心虛隨便在他們查房本上寫下了時間，但是與進入房間的時間根本對不上，（早上打掃的房間，晚上五點多來查房我不能理解，在沒有同意情況下兩個人先後私自進入房間説查房也不能理解，來了同事對我們大呼小叫真的很讓人害怕）之後警察調節那個酒店經理勉強給我們道歉之類的，先後態度反差也太大了吧，真的不推薦這個酒店，很嚇人，而且根本不值2000多一晚

msg:這個酒店就是我此次長白山最大的敗筆
首先，服務，一點沒有，我2點半到的酒店，跟我説，再等2個小時才能有房間，我這還是第一次，四五點才交房，12點之前必須退房的。而且前台説話都理直氣壯的，服務也不怎麼樣。第二點，房間，我們定的別墅什麼房的，我不記得了，然後樓上走路，拖行李，我們房間吱嘎吱嘎響。其實最不滿意的還是服務，畢竟星級酒店的住的就是服務，體驗感太差了！

總之這是一次非常不錯的入住體驗，給予最大的好評。同時希望酒店可以越來越好，我還會再次選擇前來度假休閑

msg:我是帶着滿滿的質疑看着網上惡評來的，心情可以説很複雜。但是事實上卻是極其滿意的一次旅行。
1. 網上説別墅木屋很冷，我還早早要了單獨的電熱仃，結果爆炸熱！熱到半夜要起來開門降温。另外，前台響應很快，大約半小時。
2. “接駁車慢。”並沒有啊，我們加了前台的微信，要車跟他説，一般是GL8，5分鐘之內必到，送去度假區哪裡都可以。（網評可能也是因為前陣子病的人多，酒店員工不夠吧）
3. 早餐的時候客服給我們安排了會員餐廳，就因為我們帶着孩子，很貼心考慮孩子能離人遠點，安全些。
4. 其他周邊，就冰釣、煙花、糖葫蘆，前台都會給建議，幫忙約和叫車。而且都還是蠻到位的，推薦的餐廳是當地人也會去的，煙花是煙花專營店的，價格都極其合理。在路上還遇到了小童樂園的工作人員，帶我們去了商業區的小童樂園，很大還免費，還送了孩子聖誕禮物，真的是路遇的驚喜。

可能真的是帶着質疑，反而滿滿驚喜！會推薦給身邊的朋友，尤其是親子。緩坡太適合孩子了。

禮賓高揚  谷雲飛  李耀凱，前台李賀  程方卓很熱情，服務周到，客房的條件也很好，很重注設計感，簡約與中式很好的融合在一起。酒店的各項服務都很令人滿意，以後來長白山的時候，還是會選擇這裏的！

酒店可以提前安排接機，離松江河鎮有點距離，打車在60左右。離雪場很近，走三五分鐘就到了，很方便。
房間設施：
房間有淡淡的樟子松味道，很不錯，整體很乾凈開闊，傢俱設計風格簡約，很有北歐的感覺。
性價比：
服務人員態度很不錯，打掃也很認真，每天出去滑雪回來阿姨都會把房間整理的很好。早餐也很不錯，品種基本上能滿足所有住客，水果什麼的都有，很新鮮。
房間景觀：
晚上沒有人真的很像小瑞士，超級安靜，很適合家庭居住。
如果還去魯能的話，會選擇瑞士～

msg:夏天來的，感覺如果不是來滑雪，千萬別住這裏……前不着村後不着店，去鎮上和景點都
很遠。酒店配套的7號跟雲朵樂園滑草什麼的都是比較簡陋。露營地很大，但是我去的時候沒有什麼活動，很沒意思。早餐衹能湊合吃，沒有客房送餐，房間裏的座機打前台和客房服務永遠不通。問什麼服務人員都是“真的很抱歉，這裏沒有”
沒有泳池，沒有spa，沒有咖啡，大夏天連個冰激凌都沒有賣的……住的特別疲憊……每天都感覺吃飯很愁的慌（酒店餐廳貴不好吃，去鎮上又太遠，就附近有家原鄉湖不預訂不讓吃，燉一條三道鱗還300多），出去玩要坐很久車很累的慌。
後續換到萬達度假區的酒店後，有吃有玩有配套服務，才感覺又活過來了

缺點：
1.按金5000元離店後沒有自動退，我查賬單發現了，問前台現在還在等退款。退房後退按金，應該是前台默認的工作，難得必須問了才退？
2.離店把一包雪服放禮賓處，請工作人員寄送北京，當時着急走沒有自己下單。結果春節7天了，他們都沒發，還是我又幾次聯繫才找到並寄送。請改善工作管理和交接！

1.兩千塊錢一天的酒店沒有室內停車場，這都可以算了；
2.吃早餐還要排隊，這麼大的度假村餐廳還沒有我們單位的食堂大，吃飯沒有桌，還得等翻枱；
3.更可氣的是滑雪場居然沒有單板，需要排隊等，等到下午兩點半有板了，然後沒有鞋，真是把我氣笑了，四點半雪場下班，還滑個六餅啊。最後整整一天的時間在度假村衹玩排隊了。
我非常想知道這個度假村最大的承載力是多大，如果沒有那麼大的金剛鑽，就不要攬這麼大瓷器活好嗎？我看也別叫度假村了，衹能算個村。

msg:這次入住的是31號公寓樓。總體酒店服務人員態度都很好，但也衹是態度好而已。聽到投訴反饋意見不實施，真的讓客人很無奈。

電瓶車 接駁車
叫過兩次 連個影子都看不到。從29（大堂和早餐廳）到31幢這段路如果沒有電瓶車，至少要有像樣的路吧。台階結冰也不鏟，斜坡上防滑墊也不鋪。家裡人一再小心還是摔了好幾跤。反饋給了前台也沒看見任何處理方式，直到離店那天還有人因為冰面而滑倒。

早餐廳
桌子上的餐墊不換也就算了，擦也不擦。前面一個客人走了之後用過的盤子餐具拿掉，新的餐具直接放在用過的餐墊上。

地理位置
吃的選擇是又少又貴。貴是貴在性價比低，不值這個價錢。酒店餐廳衹有套餐，單點的話就是這也沒有 那也沒有 也不備菜 那你要這本菜單幹嘛？
周邊3公里以內剩下四五家餐廳，標價就是 你不在這裏吃也沒有別的地方可以吃了，真的是離譜。價格大概是長白山萬達的一倍，松花湖的兩倍吧。

雪場
防疫政策不發在公共平台上，這次去住了五個晚上就是為了去滑雪的，出發前一個月我就關注了魯能的公眾號，並沒有發佈任何防疫政策。到了那邊才知道要落地即檢報告出了才能去滑雪，又損失了一天滑雪的機會。

酒店服務
我們這次是團體入住這家酒店，可能再加上過節人比較多。總體這家酒店給我的感覺就是根本沒有能力接待這麼多客人。第一天入住，叫人幫我把快遞送到房間裏，等了三四個小時 中間每過半小時就打電話催一次，最後居然放在31幢的前台 也沒有人和我説。

希望酒店看到這個能改進吧，如果一直是這個樣子沒有回頭客的話，去魯能的人會越來越少的。畢竟如果你們對標的是開車半小時以外的萬達，那真的要好好經營了。

msg:整個度假村的風格很不錯，有點瑞士小鎮的感覺了，整個園區很大，勝地橋的景色很好，晚上還有篝火晚會，不過還沒完全建好，感覺管理略有些混亂。度假村分為別墅區和酒店區，是在不同的區域辦理入住，但是並沒有明顯的標識，如果第一次來不太好找。酒店區衹有一棟有早餐，其他棟雖然離得不遠，但還是略有些不方便。這次給升級了套房，房間很大，硬件設施很不錯，但是可能剛裝修好，還有一些味道。附近還在開發，有些地方還沒修好，配套的餐廳也不多。

在入住時前台掃碼加了管家的微信，以便有需要使用酒店接駁車服務的可以預約，但我們想用接駁車把我們送到大門口，（到大門口有3公里）卻讓我們自己叫出租車。

msg:酒店完全不適合在暑假去住！

去之前已經被告知此酒店沒有空調，我們特意租了個套房想着空間大點也可以涼快一點，誰知道酒店位置有空調的地方就是大堂和電梯，上了樓道和房間是完全沒有空調的，房間配了一把碩大無比的空調風扇，白天吹一下還湊合説得過去，晚上那就慘了，不吹熱得你渾身濕透，吹吧，那個風扇跟開火車似的，吵得不行！

牙膏集團也是夠人性化的，大熱天的標配還是那床羽絨被，還是那個羽絨床墊，白天32度, 暴曬後的房間猶如蒸籠一般悶熱，晚上户外氣温26度，房間依舊悶熱能不出汗嘛？大堂的工作人員告訴我，開窗，開門就好很多，誰知道開窗開門引來的是一大堆巨型飛蛾，飛蟲，七星瓢蟲等自然的寵物在你頭頂嗡嗡叫，無奈下衹能趕走她們繼續關窗關門。

本來想好好躺平休息幾天的，最後變成大人孩子被熱醒,一起眼光光等天光。 

酒店的餐廳在別墅區，離開我們住的酒店走路要個7,8分鐘，關鍵是沒啥吃的，去晚了還真的啥都沒有。糟糕！

所以説此酒店性價比不高！

Die gesamte Anlage wurde renoviert bzw. der ClubMed neu gebaut, so dass ab 6:30 Uhr morgens der Baustellenlärm die Nacht beendete. Checkin sehr mühsam, da wir keine Infos erhalten hatten, bei welcher der Gebäude/Rezeptionen wir einchecken können, daher fast 45 min Wartezeit/Suche zwischen Ankunft und Checkin. Sommer ist absolute Nebensaison. Kein Fitness, kein Pool. Tennis-/Basketball-/Kunstrasenfussballplätze vorhanden, allerdings in sehr schlechtem Zustand (es wuchs überall Grünzeug aus dem gebrochenen Betonboden heraus). Kommunikation auf englisch mühsam. Fahrdienste auf dem riesigen Gelände zu dem einzigen geöffneten Restaurant und den Sportplätzen vorhanden, jedoch mit extrem langen Wartezeiten; daher sind wir dann doch alles selbst mit dem Auto gefahren. Zufahrtsstrasse zum Resortgelände wird renoviert, dadurch ist ein Umweg von 30min zur Hauptstrasse auf einer unzumutbaren Strasse durch den Wald zu fahren. Restaurant- und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten vor Ort waren quasi nicht vorhanden; Fahrtweg zu den nächsten Restaurants durch die Baustelle 45min einfach. Frühstück sowohl westlich als auch chinesisch gut, jedoch Service sehr langsam im Wiederauffüllen und Abräumen der Tische. Kostenfreier Shuttle zum Eingang des Changbaishan-Geländes; bei der Rückfahrt war es uns ohne chinesisch Kenntnisse jedoch nicht möglich, den richtigen Bus zurück zum Hotel zu finden.
