msg:I had an absolutely amazing three-day stay at Shangri-La Xiamen. As this was a staycation, I was looking for some self-pampering and I came away feeling well rested and refreshed. The things which made this stay so special are: bright and clean room with an excellent view of the sea, comfortable lamps and lighting, which were were soft and warm, the very comfortable bedding, the ample amount of free drinking water (four bottles when I arrived, and more bottles delivered later in the afternoon) the very warm service of everyone, from check in, to room service, to the very polite and attentive ladies in the exective lounge, and the pool facilities on the lower ground floor. In the changing room, there is a hot and powerful jacuzzi and a fully-functioning steam room. The pool itself was quiet and a good length! Towels and showers--all convenient and comfortable. This really is a very warm, welcoming, and high-quality place.  It seems that every comfort has been considered--drinking water, lighting, bedding, cleanliness, friendliness, convenience, service. The Horizon lounge on the fourth floor has an amazing breakfast with a mixture of a buffet and a la carte. The food is delicious. Evening Happy Hour also has a varied buffet with a good selecrion of drinks. Absolutely five starts. Thank you for the wonderful mini holiday!!

But what stands out is the quality of the service, kind, efficient, anticipatory of needs without being overbearing. By far one of the best service experiences we have ever had. The indoor pool is for laps more than fun, but the hot tub is nice and the yoga room is great. Outdoor pools are connected to a nearby water park and not actually party of the hotel, fyi.

Perfect for the week end and if you need to go to downtown, just take a didi.
The food is great, buffet offers large choice of meat. For morning breakfast, if you have the possibility, go to horizon level, much more quiet.
Clean, large and modern room. The suite with view on the beach is awesome.

I must mention breakfast! The breakfast is particularly rich, exquisite and delicious. There are many varieties. Even the dried fruits and cereals with milk are placed in a lot. As long as there are other ingredients and side dishes, they are placed a lot, and you can see that they are attentive to guests. There are specialty shacha noodles and tofu brain. The breakfast room is particularly large, and the dining table, chairs and sofas are beautiful and elegant. There are floor-to-ceiling windows all over, so you can enjoy the beautiful scenery while eating breakfast. The equipment in the gym is very advanced! It is worth enjoying. Every time you enter and exit the hotel, the uncle in front of the door will help you open and close the car door, giving you a good reception and care, thank you! Xiamen has a good air. When I was regretting that the window was closed and I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it when I returned to the room, I communicated with the hotel. As a result, the store sent someone to the room to open a small fan with a key, and everything was perfect! 
Time was tight, so I didn‚Äôt have time to take pictures of the breakfast room. Picture 4 is a corner of the breakfast room, and pictures 2 and 3 are the fourth-floor lounge. Others are the restaurant's outdoor terrace and the platform overlooking the sea.

Food: Breakfast is normal, and I didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel the rest of the time.
Transportation: It takes about 20 minutes to take a taxi to the central area or Jimei without traffic jams. There is a subway nearby, which is also convenient. It takes a while to walk to the beach, about 7 or 8 minutes.
Service: The hotel service is still very good
ps: The hairpin project was not filmed because the shooting staff made a mistake in the time, which is a pity. (There was an appoin**ent, but when I went there, there were already customers taking pictures, speechless)
I will not stay in this hotel again when I go to Xiamen.

The actual experience exceeded my expectations. The hotel arranged various cultural activities very carefully. This time we experienced Kung Fu tea, hairpin flowers, and Nanyin performances (on-site trial of Nanyin instruments). The actors of the Nanyin performances were very dedicated and performed non-stop throughout the morning. The audio-visual experience was many times better than what I saw at Haitiantang. It can be savored for a long time. Susan of the Luxury Club was very considerate and helped me contact hairpin flowers in advance. Although the shooting was not very smooth later due to personal reasons, it also left a good memory for me and my mother.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about sea-hunting. Because there was a construction project nearby, the way out of the beach was quite far. It was also because of personal reasons (too tired) that I failed to go to the sea as planned, leaving a little regret. I will come again next time.

I will come back to this city for the third time

The meals, coffee, and happy hour in the executive lounge are all very comfortable, and the service staff are polite and humble, which makes people feel comfortable. The hotel's gym is well-equipped, the swimming pool is very good, and the room is very clean, which is satisfactoryüíØ
I checked out in the middle of the five-night trip, and then moved back to Shangri-La. They actually kept the same room for me, which is so considerate‚ù§Ô∏èAfter a few days, the hotel even called to ask about my personal stay experience, and reported that I didn't have breakfast one morning and was not satisfied with the coffeeüòîIn fact, it was a personal reason, because the breakfast time was relatively rushed, and there were many people on weekends who needed to queue up, including the taste of coffee, which was also a personal taste that was more picky! Then the service staff's work was so considerate. I personally feel that among so many hotel stay experiences, the entire service team of Xiamen Shangri-La, from managers to restaurant waiters to room service aunties, everything makes people feel comfortable and warm. They sent me fruits, love cookies, and a bottle of red wineüç∑. I didn't have coffee for breakfast on the last day, but they arranged a lobby bar when I checked out, and gave me free capsule coffee of my favorite flavor... I'm so happyüòä
What can I say... Everyone was touched by the thoughtful service
Full score for Xiamen tripüíØHotelüíØ
I didn't want to leave because it was so comfortable hahaha
Impeccable ShangRi-LA

Also, the dinner buffet dishes were not ideal, which was a pity. Overall, it was very good. I would like to say thank you to your service team again. It amazed me. It was better than the Shangri-La in Taiwan. I will take my daughter there for a vacation in a while.

msg:I must say first: Shangri-La is much better than those hotels in Xiamen that are under other international hotel chains!!! Whether it is the service level or the hardware facilities, they are not comparable to those hotels with brand names!

The hotel is very convenient for transportation, 15 minutes away from the airport, facing the Taiwan Strait, and the scenery is amazing. The hotel account manager contacted in advance the day before check-in to inquire about the check-in requirements. After knowing that I brought children, he specially selected a room facing the sea view, gave the children sand digging tools, and informed the hotel in advance of the relevant information of the surrounding attractions. It can be said to be very considerate.

The hotel's mattress is very comfortable, soft but supportive, and the sleeping experience is very good!

The hotel's own children's playground facilities are very new and clean. The facilities in the heated swimming pool are also fully equipped, and there are also spa pools and steam rooms.

I didn't expect that a hotel located in the business district would achieve the most satisfactory check-in experience for children.

msg:As a five-star hotel in a global chain, I can only say that the service is not worthy of the brand. There were two mini bars written on the order, but I only got one when I checked in. I called the hotel customer service twice at about 2:00. A waiter came. When the waiter came, he was confused and didn't know what to replenish. Later, I called the hotel customer service number again. The hotel said that someone would be arranged to replenish it immediately. It was not replenished until 7:00 in the evening. I was really angry. The five-star hotel did not meet the bill. Then I contacted Ctrip. The Ctrip brother was very friendly and told me that they had communicated with the hotel and said that a room manager would come back in 10 minutes. The man in a suit probably waited for 20 minutes before he came. He took the mini bar and was also dizzy. As an old five-star hotel operator, he did not take notes. He had to repeat the problem every time he called. The service was too slow. The mini bar could not be replenished for 5 hours. Didn't see a man in a suit come up to solve the problem? Finally, I was given a 10% discount when I checked out. I was drunk. It was not as good as Ctrip? It was written that the sea view room was actually a semi-sea view. You have to turn sideways on the glass to see the sea üåö. I was drunk. Why didn't you write semi-sea view on the order? The goods are not what they claim to be, and the main point is that the service is bad! The service is bad!

I saw a child who was injured and bleeding during the play and went to the hospital. The waiter on the 4th floor seemed to not understand what I said. I ordered a cup of coffee but never got it from the time I arrived to the time I left. The overall dishes are good as long as you are full.

Offer praise and thanks to:
Doreen took the initiative to ask about room requirements in advance, recommended travel guides, always cared about whether the stay was good, and even gave me a souvenir before leaving;
Wendy and ****lian in the guest room gave me delicious tea to drink, sent me greeting messages every day, specially sent skin care products to the guest room, and prepared white fungus soup in the evening.
Susan, the cafeteria manager, said that I wanted to try the local Fujian Buddha Jumping Over the Wall, and I had it that night (it was so delicious).

There are other service staff whose names I don‚Äôt know.
In your spare time, you can also go to Huaxiangyuan on the first floor to have a cup of tea (hahaha, I bought it in the end anyway)
Recommended dishes:
Hot pot and preserved egg and lean meat porridge in the buffet restaurant; the chef‚Äôs specialty dishes on the first page of the Chinese restaurant, just close your eyes and order them, including mustard shrimp balls and sea**** seafood fried rice;
After breakfast, walk through the lobby and walk for five minutes to Guanyin Mountain Beach üèñÔ∏è
Serious reminder:
When the waiter tells you that you have enough to eat, be sure to listen! Although the little potatoes in the south don't eat much, their dishes must be prepared for us northerners.

Environment: Quiet and comfortable
Service: First of all, thank you to summer for your always excellent service, and again to the manager from Tianjin in the north of the lobby. Finally, I would like to thank Aunt Chen Chunmei for her hard work in cleaning up our house every day.
Shangri-La is convenient to drive to everywhere in the surrounding area, and the food is delicious. There is also a children's playground and swimming pool which are also good. I will stay at Shangri-La next time I go there.

You can go to the beach through the underground passage, but it was cold and windy, so I looked at the side of the room, haha.
Alice Han Jing at the front desk was quick to check out and check the bill, and thoughtfully prepared small gifts. Thank you!

During the check-in process, any problems encountered were solved very well. The waiter Zhu Yuanyuan worked hard and provided good service.

msg:A five-star hotel. The room supplies and bedding are very clean and tidy. The hotel lobby is grand, I like it very much. It's easy to park for a self-driving car. There is an underground parking lot and ample parking spaces. It is very convenient to go anywhere by car. The front desk staff were friendly and processed quickly. Especially sister Lyla, she contacted us before check-in and arranged a room, fruits, and toiletries for the children. On the day of check-out, she asked about the check-in experience and gave us gifts, which was very heartwarming. The room is quite large, the mattress is comfortable, and it's very comfortable to stay. The floor is also suitable. The bathroom is also relatively spacious, with a bathtub and shower. Friends who are out to play can go directly. It is very close to the airport and train station. It takes 10 minutes to reach Guanyin Mountain BeachüèñÔ∏è. The best hotel to watch the sunrise from your room! Will always choose Shangri-La[strong][strong][strong]

msg:During the Spring Festival, I took my children to Xiamen and stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel for 4 nights. It was a wonderful and festive experience. Located on the east coast of Xiamen, the environment is quiet and far away from the busy city. It is very convenient to take a taxi or subway when going out. It is 15 minutes' drive from the airport. In the Horizon Club Sea View Room, you can experience the blazing sun rising over the sea and the tranquility and mystery of the night without leaving your home. The rich breakfast and dinner time are nutritious and delicious and full of Xiamen cuisine. The indoor swimming pool spa on the basement floor allows you to easily unload the fatigue of the day's travel. The moderately firm bed gently helps me fall asleep. The service in the hotel is warm and courteous, and the sound insulation effect is good. Fruit plates and pastries are delivered to the room every day. On the night of the fifth day of the ***** New Year, I met the God of Wealth in the restaurant and handed out red envelopes. A perfect experience, suitable for a family of all ages. Highly praised the room server Sister Xue Lanyu.

msg:The front of the room faces the sea and the beach. You can watch the sunrise. The scenery is very good. The room facilities are relatively new. Breakfast is served in the luxury pavilion on the fourth floor. The environment is very elegant. You can also order meals a la carte. There are light meals and dishes every evening. That's okay.
The children's playground is large and relatively hygienic. The gym is very large and has a complete set of equipment among the hotel industry's gyms. Except for free squats and straight-arm pull-downs, equipment for other major sports is available. The swimming pool is 25m x 4 lanes. Not bad except for the low water temperature.
The hotel's service left a deep impression on us. Whether it was the greeter on the first floor or the waitress in the luxury pavilion on the fourth floor, they all smiled sincerely and made people feel very comfortable. I would like to specifically commend the young man Zhong Huanchen who greets guests on the first floor. He helped solve the urgent problem of the takeout cabinet being unable to be opened. He also has a very good attitude. Thumbs up.
Overall, Shangri-La left a perfect memory for our trip to Xiamen during the New Year. If there are any shortcomings, the sound insulation of the room is slightly lacking. Children running and fighting in the corridor will affect rest. In addition, there is no smart toilet in the room. The sound of the shower room door is very loud when it is closed. These are small details and are innocuous. I hope Shangri-La is getting better and better. I will bring my daughter here next time I have the opportunity.

msg:Xiamen Shangri-La refreshed my understanding of five-star hotels. This time I took my family to Xiamen to celebrate the New Year. After choosing for a long time, I finally settled on Shangri-La, the ultimate place for parents and children. The hotel is clean, comfortable and warm. Everything smells like home. The hardware meets five-star standards. What I want to say is that the details are so well done and so touching! Special thanks to summer and Teresa and the beautiful and lovely staff whose names I can't remember. I was warmly welcomed when I first arrived at the hotel. Every staff member greeted me warmly, which made my heart feel very warm. They also prepared gifts for the children, which was so thoughtful. After checking into the room, I found that welcome fruits, candies, red wine, and a free mini bar for the first time were specially prepared. It was really rich. And the breakfast is the most comfortable I have ever had in any five-star hotel. During our stay, it happened to be my son's birthday according to the Gregorian calendar. The hotel specially prepared a birthday cake and decorated the room, which left a wonderful memory for the child. I was really reluctant to leave after staying here for six nights. Shangri-La will definitely be my first choice when visiting Xiamen or other cities in the future. Thanks again to the lovely staff for your hard work.

The hotel is only a five-minute walk from the seaside, and the seaside is not an internet celebrity check-in spot, so there are not many people. I walk to the seaside every day, blow the sea breeze, and listen to the music. It‚Äôs nice to listen to the waves!

The hotel has a rich arrangement of Chinese New Year dishes, including making dumplings, writing Spring Festival couplets, and watching the Spring Festival Gala. The children had a lot of fun!

I will stay here again next time I come to Xiamen!

Coffee or tea will be delivered to the dining table

Child care & play:
In fact, it feels like this is more of a business five-star hotel.
There should be a lot of meetings that can be arranged
The hotel also works hard to be "kid-friendly"
Not only K20 hosting, playground, swimming pool

The scenery along Huandao Road is amazing. The hotel has been in business for many years. The facilities and equipment are well maintained, clean and tidy. There is a free mini bar for the first round. It is said to be free, but it is enough. Invincible sea view!! Cathy's service is very good. She helps arrange rooms and book restaurants. The hotel staff are very nice. It is a hotel worth recommending. Shangri-La highly recommends it. The sea view in the room is unparalleled. You can watch the sunrise while lying in bed in the morning. Across the sea is Kinmen, with an unobstructed view. You must try the sea view when you come to Shangri-La. Service: Cathy contacted one day in advance to inquire about preferences and reminded the weather to pack luggage. She was really attentive. Thoughtful and considerate, the room is clean, every service staff will greet you warmly, it feels like going home, the mini bar in the room is free, there are many varieties, what a surprise, overall I am very satisfied, it will be on my must-stay list when I come to Xiamen

msg:This trip was to visit relatives + play with an old and a young child. Since I stayed at Shangri-La in Sanya for a week during the summer vacation and had a good experience, I chose Shangri-La this time. But the rooms in Xiamen are smaller and have no balcony. Everything else is the same. Bedding and hygiene are very important. It would be nice if the plant scent of the cleaning series could be replaced with fruity ones. Children's cleaning is okay. I gave small buckets and shovels for children to play in the sand, etc. I praised my little housekeeper Carrie for solving the problem in time every time. She also thoughtfully gave me a fruit plate and souvenirs. The breakfast variety is okay, but it is a pity that it is not as rich as Sanya. The children's park is suitable for children under eight years old. My baby is too old to play. It would be great if there is a children's water park. It is a pity that I did not play in the water this time. You can order takeout, buy food, drink, medicine and so on. It is also very convenient. It is also very convenient to book a taxi on Ctrip. I like it all. The little girl standing in the lobby aisle is beautiful and polite. She takes the initiative to say hello and give her a thumbs up every time. The cleaning aunt is also very enthusiastic. All the waiters are festive and good-looking in New Year's red outfits.
Suggestions: Have steak for breakfast, Bao'er loves to eat it; add water play facilities for children, after all, it is a southern coastal city, and it is good to be able to play in the water all year round.

When it rained, we took a dip in the children's playground. There is Guanyin Mountain Beach outside the hotel. The children can play on the beach for a long time. It rained even the next day. Walked around in the rain.

1. Carrie called me after I checked out to ask about my stay experience. She cared about my feelings and made me feel particularly warm.
2. Manager Chen Mengting and her team at the executive lounge, after learning that my stay on New Year‚Äôs Day in 2020 was an average experience, they wanted to bring the best. I gave the children a shell chain as a souvenir, waived the breakfast fee for Dabao, and also took the initiative to provide fried noodles and other things.

We decorated it and started to celebrate the New Year. It was very festive. During my stay, Asteria asked me about my stay experience and gave me a souvenir. A particularly gentle intern girl, whose service is in line with Shangri-La's service concept, made the stay Guests who stay at Shangri-La feel very welcome and will stay here again next time.

Whether it is ordinary employees, interns or managers, they are very attentive. Asteria added my WeChat account and cared about my feedback during my stay. The manager Carrie knew about my feedback and followed up the whole process without any carelessness. It made me feel very warm. I asked the Western restaurant to pack two portions the next day. The manager also brought breakfast, and before leaving, he also gave me a souvenir from Shangri-La, Xiamen. It was a really warm trip‚ù§Ô∏è

She learned that a child took the initiative to inform us of sand digging tools and children's toiletries. The favorability level directly increased the room type, facilities and whether it can be upgraded. She was also clearly informed about the Guanyin Mountain beach, which was a bit lacking. Although the development is good, I don‚Äôt know if the business is not so good. It‚Äôs closed. I suggest you stay in the city for two days before going to Shangri-La. It‚Äôs a bit out of the way. We visited the city two days ago and then wanted to go to the hotel for swimming, so maybe we‚Äôd like to check in at the first stop. Friends, it will be a little inconvenient. You can take a taxi to the roundabout for 20 yuan. The guy who picked up the luggage on the day of check-in was particularly nice. In the elevator to help carry the luggage to the room, he learned that I had fallen down in the morning and my feet were swollen and he took the initiative to carry it for us. Thank you for giving us a lot of ice cubes. Thank you to the hotel staff who are all very nice. The breakfast is also very rich. There are also women's locker rooms, bathing pools and steam rooms. Overall, I am very satisfied with Shangri-La.

There are many storage platforms where you can spread out many things at will, including a large bathroom. The staff was very generous with the mineral water and gave us a box of water directly. The hotel is family-friendly and has children's toiletries. The other half of the wardrobe is specially designed for children, and a brand new sand digging tool is also given! The hot water in the bathroom is very hot, which is much better than another family hotel I stayed in before. There is a takeaway counter, Fengchao Cabinet, downstairs, and there is also a neighboring restaurant that opens quite late, making life convenient. Apart from the location of the hotel being a bit far from some attractions, I can't fault it.

Our two children play there every day. We also had a New Year's Eve buffet at the hotel on the night of 12/31. The price was right and the food was rich and varied.

One child can play in the children's playground all day long. The facilities are currently very good and the children are very happy.
The drinks in the room minibar are relatively simple and there are no snacks. We only had coke and iced tea, but it was not bad.
The services promised in these three orders have been fulfilled.
During the off-season, one point was exchanged for a room upgrade. It was said that it gave a 90-degree sea view, and the 90-degree viewing angle was not bad. Those who have never stayed at the 180-degree felt that the 90-degree view was also good. It was very suitable for watching the sunrise from the room. Unfortunately, we didn't see it due to cloudy weather.
In addition, the front desk lady Alice Han Jing helped to check in quickly and prepared sand digging toys and check-out gifts for the children. The children were very happy.
There are several open-air amu*****t parks more than 800 meters away from the beach. You can ride the Ferris wheel. There are other projects, but they are a bit old.

Carrie Liu Ruining at the front desk is very good. She speaks standard Mandarin and the reception is warm and attentive. When checking out, she came back late because she attended a tea expo. Help coordinate late check-out time, be thoughtful to customers, and give warm greetings.
Because the room was relatively cold in the middle, I called the front desk, and the engineering depar**ent was immediately sent to measure the indoor temperature. The front desk also provided a disposable bathtub film when I wanted to take a bath. The hotel service management is very good.
When I checked out, I met a gentleman in the elevator who seemed to be a manager or supervisor. I forgot his name. He took the initiative to help me carry my luggage. He was warm and friendly. When I said that the hotel service management is very good, this male supervisor was at the front desk. I was given a box of local specialties, mung bean snacks. I tasted them on the plane and they were also very delicious.
The room is a**ospheric, business-like and high-end, and the restaurant has rich dishes. All in all, it was a very satisfying stay. I will definitely choose Shangri-La Hotel next time I come to Xiamen.
I was still hesitating before ordering? Ritz-Carlton or W or?

You can watch the sunrise directly from the room, and you can see Guanyin Mountain Beach right outside your door. The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic. Vidiya provides high-quality service and introduces the package contents in detail. Laly helps with luggage and Anna helps with quick check-out.

msg:Shangri-La Hotel, Xiamen can be said to be a hidden treasure family hotelüè®

Facilities: We stayed in a superior twin room. For us who are from coastal cities, it is not necessary to be able to see the sea. But the front desk manager helped me arrange a room at the far end of the 19th floor. I could see the sea when I opened the curtains, which was quite a surprise. The room is large and relatively new (we came back from staying at Hotel Indigo for two days, so we thought Shangri-La would be much newer); there are two windows in the room, so the lighting is particularly good. The bathroom has a shower and a bathtub. Although there is no wet and dry separation, it is still very spacious.

Location: The hotel is only one road away from Guanyinshan Beach, and it takes about 5 minutes to walk to the underground passage. There is a subway station nearby, you can take a taxi or take the subway to go to the city or shopping malls.

Facilities: The hotel should target parent-child vacations. It has a children's playground on the first floor, and there are also summer camp activities that you can sign up for. It's a bit like a club-med format. The only difference is that you have to pay on-site to sign up according to your needs. We participated. A baking class (in fact, the dough is kneaded, and the children are asked to press the pattern with the mold and bake the bread), which seems to be 89 yuan per class/hour. There is also a swimming pool next to the children's playground, which is fully furnished. There is music playing on the first floor in the evening.
Catering: The buffet breakfast is rich in choices, including salad, sushi, sandwiches, European buns, Ming stalls, porridge, noodles and rice, etc. The children are very happy. We stayed in a hotel + dining package and ate at a Chinese restaurant in the evening. In fact, after looking at the menu, I really didn‚Äôt want to eat it (the buffet snacks in the Chinese restaurant should be a better choice). I felt that the meal package was a bit perfunctory.
Overall, I was satisfied with the three days and two nights staying at the Shangri-La Hotel, and it is worth recommending!

Because the welcome fruit gift for the first night is spared when booking, it is the fruit and snacks like picture 2. I went to the nearby beach in the morning and came back late. The hotel manager was very nice to help me delay the check-out, so that we could have enough time to pack our luggage. It happened to be lunch time. By the way, we could have a buffet lunch on the first floor of the hotel. The staff here are very nice, Asteria, Carrie, vidiya & I met a few cleaning ladies in the aisle, they were all friendly. I bought a high-speed rail ticket at 5 o'clock, and I can also stop by the children's playground on the LG floor for about an hour to avoid the scorching heat of summer.

msg:This time, I am very much looking forward to the trip to Shangri-La, Xiamen, and generally it basically meets the expectations.
Check-in in the lounge, from CI to CO, was received by Vidiya, and the highest floor that could be checked in at that time was arranged. Every time Vidiya will be delivered to the door, very polite.
There is no welcome fruit when you enter the guest room, but a rich fruit plate will be delivered immediately after calling. There are red wine and soft drinks on the table, and the minibar is quite rich. The room is small, relatively bright, facing the sea view, overlooking the beach of Guanyin Mountain, overlooking Xiang'an and the big and small Kinmen. In fact, there are not many rooms facing the sea in the hotel, and it is still rare to find high floors. The facilities are complete, with a washlet and a spare bottle of L'Occitane. But because of the small space, there is only a single basin. The glass on the exterior wall is relatively dirty and needs to be cleaned more frequently.
There are not many drinks during the happy hour in the lounge, but there is a lot to eat. Breakfast is also served in the lounge. The a la carte Shacha Noodles, Fish Ball Yan Dumplings, and Pandan are all good.
The children's playground, gym and indoor swimming pool are all on the basement floor. Time is tight and there are no children, so there is no experience, but there are indeed many guests staying with parents and children.
Guest rooms are on floors 10 to 22, and floors 5 to 9 are vacant.
From the basement level, you can walk to the street and come to Guanyinshan Beach through the underground passage. Seafood barbecue is a place where Internet celebrities check in, but compared with the crowded places during the holidays, the beach of Guanyin Mountain is considered clean.
The aunt in the housekeeping depar**ent is very good. She turned down the bed when she came back from dinner the night before; the next day was delayed due to special reasons, and the aunt came to tidy up the bathroom.
Overall, Shangri-La is an ideal place for a seaside holiday.

I checked in early, thanks Kiki for helping to contact the cleaning, because the hotel the day before was uncomfortable, so the whole family made up for half a day of sleep after check-in, very at ease.
In the afternoon, the cleaning staff came to do sanitation, and gave away a piece of fruit for the stay. Lily's service is very enthusiastic.
The sea is outside the hotel, Guanyin Beach can be seen from the window, and towering office buildings and mountains can be seen from the other window of the hotel. It is a perfect combination.

It happened to be my birthday, and Carrie, the guest experience manager, warmly presented red wine and freshly made cakes. The experience was full. This cake is really delicious and sweet in my heart! The beach next to the hotel is only a five-minute walk away, with a pleasant sea view. At the same time, we recommend the buffet western food on the first floor, which has a variety of varieties, and Buddha jumps over the wall with rich materials. A friendly reminder that hotel guests can receive restaurant coupons for free, and that non-resident guests can also buy group purchases, which is very affordable. Super recommended to stay!

msg:The trip to Xiamen on May Day was very pleasant. It was very wise to choose to stay at the Shangri-La Hotel for the last night after returning from Gulangyu Island: the service is very warm, the room is very comfortable, the hotel‚Äôs children‚Äôs playground is quite large, and there are rich activities and courses; there is a beach after going out, where you can play in the sand and catch the sea.
1. Service
KIKI at the front desk was very professional and enthusiastic when we checked in. He arranged a suitable room for us and gave us small gifts for the children. KIKI is also the little witch of Kiki's Delivery Service, she is also in line with the cute enthusiasm and professionalism of the little witch. Jiaqi sent little bunnies for the children, as well as snacks and fruits, which were all delicious. She was also very kind and helped us answer a lot of questions. Tina in the service center answered the phone enthusiastically and understood my needs. Teresa specially helped me apply for and gave feedback after knowing my need for late check-out. Help me apply quickly and meet my needs. In short, the check-in experience is very good.
2. Hotel facilities
1. Twin rooms can share beds, which is great for parent-child travel.
2. The bedding is very comfortable.
3. The facilities in the children's playground are good, and the children have fun. Children's activities are richer but paid for.
3. The environment outside the hotel
1. The surrounding area belongs to an office park, but there are few people and there is no traffic jam.
2. It is very close to the airport, about 20 minutes by taxi.
3. The beach is just across the road outside the hotel, and the sand is relatively fine. The most important thing is to catch the sea! Check the low tide time in advance, and then go to the beach. There are many small crabs, hermit crabs, shells, barnacles, etc., which are easy to catch, enough for inland children and big friends to play.
4. There are some shopping malls around ten minutes by taxi, and I chose a Hakka restaurant that tastes pretty good.

If you live too much in five-star hotels, you will become numb. It's not easy to be outstanding and let customers remember, but I really have a very good impression of Shangri-La this time! Many details are impressive. Bathrobes and toiletries are all disposable seals to avoid being used by others and put back. The service response is very timely, even if I need a roll of tape for express delivery, they can deliver it in time.
I ate his buffet twice during the two nights I stayed, because it was really good! A lot of chilled cooked seafood, I said it was too cold to eat, they actually have a steamer to heat it on the spot. This move is so flattering! Such considerate service! Last but not least, the desserts are delicious! Looks good, tastes good! It is the best dessert I have eaten in five-star hotels. I dare say that the dessert chef must have put his heart into it!
To sum up: I am as picky as I am, very satisfied, and will come again next time!

msg:I always live in five-star hotels when I travel. I have also stayed in many Shangri-La hotels. However, this is the only one that makes me feel that the service is so poor. When I made the reservation, I asked Ctrip and the hotel to communicate about providing latex pillows. The hotel also responded clearly. However, when I checked in, the room attendant told me confidently that no one told them to reserve a latex pillow for me. I contacted Ctrip and the hotel to communicate and deal with it. After 2 hours, I did find latex pillows when I came back to the room. There is also an inexplicable bottle of red wine, is this bottle of red wine used to apologize to me? I didn't see any note, no apology card. Of course, I didn't touch the red wine either. The whole process of breakfast in the restaurant the next day seemed that the waiters were busy, but they didn't know what they were busy with. Because, during my entire meal, the waiter didn't take the initiative to come over to collect the plate once. All the plates are collected after the guests leave. Is this for convenience and trouble, or is it lazy? Also, I asked the waiter to pour me a cup of black tea. As a result, when she brought it to me, it was put directly on the table, and it was spilled directly at that time. Without any apology, he just turned around and left. I saw two managers in black suits in the restaurant, a man and a woman. The female manager was in the restaurant and did not greet any guests from the beginning to the end. The male manager said hello when I was about to leave. The only thing about the hotel that makes me feel service-minded is a male porter wearing glasses. Take the initiative to help with luggage, the attitude is very good. Xiamen is a tourist city, and indeed there is no shortage of guests. However, as a Shangri-La Hotel, the service attitude is the worst. I don't know how the hotel is managed. Not to mention the old hotel facilities, the service is not good! ! ! !

      In the end, Ms. Liu Ruining also patiently asked me about my check-in situation during the return call. She worked meticulously üëçüèª

Environment: Opposite is the playground and Guanyinshan Beach. When you leave the hotel and cross the zebra crossing on the left, you will pass by Wanghong Street. You can take pictures üì∏, and then you can directly go to the beach to play ~ very convenient

Facilities: The facilities are complete and the public areas of the hotel are also good. There is no old feeling. It can be seen that the maintenance of the facilities has been done well.

Hygiene: clean and tidy, good

The overall stay experience is full marks, next time I will bring the children together~

Disadvantages: The sound insulation of the room is not good, and it is a little far away from the scenic spots, so it is suitable for hotels.

Service: Manager Qiu at the front desk made a warm return visit and helped to check out and issue invoices. The service is very good‚ù§Ô∏è

msg:Shangri-La Hotel, as a classic 5-star hotel, is the favorite of many people, especially more than 20 years ago, Shangri-La Hotel in China, just like today's "Rolls Royce" car, is enviable.
The location of the Shangri-La Hotel in Xiamen is excellent, especially the executive sea view room, which has a wide view, and the blue sea is pleasing to the eye.
It is worth mentioning that there are two highlights of Shangri-La in Xiamen. Firstly, the reception staff at the front desk are very friendly and make you feel like you are back in a familiar place. For example, Ms. Qiu knew that I like to live in high-rise buildings and watch the sea, so she specially arranged to go to the hotel On the top floor, there is also a fruit plate.
What's more, the happy hour in the executive lounge not only has a romantic environment, but also has diverse and delicious meals. There are also more than a dozen kinds of drinks for guests to choose from, with unlimited drinks. see picture.
The breakfast is on the first floor, and there are many stalls, which can satisfy everyone's appetite.
Such as Japanese ingredients, local snacks in southern Fujian, etc., you should have everything.
Another point is that the surrounding environment of Shangri-La is very good, and the air quality is absolutely excellent.
Going on vacation nowadays, the real luxury üàö is not only high-quality sunshine, air, water and meals.
Man and heaven are in harmony. If you want to recuperate and be in a daze, then there is a very reliable heavenly doctor in Xiamen, and that is Shangri-La.
In comparison, its cost performance is also very high.

The orientation of the room is very good, facing the entire beach, opposite the hotel is the playground, and there is also a good karting field. The hotel parking is very convenient, and the Horizon Club has breakfast and dinner every day. This time, I basically ate in the Horizon Club. There were too many people outside and it was too crowded. I saved a lot of meal expensesüòÇ, there are many choices, the wine is also very good, and the meal is very comfortable. It happened to be my birthday, and the floor manager, Lingling Wendy, was very considerate. She gave me wine and a happy birthday surprise for Petal! Thank you!

Service: in place

It‚Äôs true that the area on the east side of the island is more comfortable to live in. There are too many people in Sanming. . Chinese New Year is terrible. . Gulangyu was not able to go. . Shangri-La has a large beach area, a good environment, and a comfortable coffee shop! There is also a professional karting track! Very comfortable!
(There is a Tesla supercharger at the entrance of the hotel. Although I drove a gasoline car this time, I was still very surprised. I can drive a tram next time)

2. Neatness: clean and tidy, great
3. Service: It can be seen that the service personnel have done a good job of training, and all the staff greeted us warmly, and I feel very good. However, the staff of the Chinese restaurant suggested strengthening the training. I brought children with me, and reminded me several times when serving the dishes not to serve the dishes near the children, especially soup and hot dishes. The girl at the front desk is very enthusiastic, but the quality of work needs to be improved. Maybe it was too busy during the Chinese New Year peak when the room was full. I didn't return my bank card when I ran out, and I didn't introduce the facilities when I checked in. I had to ask for breakfast and so on. I called the customer service center the next morning, but no one answered, so I don't know what's going on.
4. Facilities: The children's playground is very good. My daughter doesn't want to leave after playing. She plays for an hour or two every day. The swimming pool is great, there is also a jacuzzi and sauna room, and the changing room is very large and convenient. I didn't experience the gym, but the facilities are very complete, and there are yoga rooms and so on.
5. Meals: I am used to southern Hokkien cuisine, and I always feel bland. This is my problem. The breakfast in Horizon Club is good, I like steak very much. Preserved egg and lean meat porridge is not my favorite taste.
To sum up, after staying for four days, I am still very satisfied. I hope that with the service, I can have a better experience next time.

The welcome fruit and so on are also added after changing rooms. The breakfast buffet is also very rich. All in all, it is a pleasant stay! If I come to Xiamen again in the future, I will choose Shangri-La again.
Thank you Alice and Carrie! Good service and warm attitudeüëç

Location: It belongs to the business district, far away from the scenic spot, but it is also quiet. Very close to the beach, 5-10 minutes walk. You can catch the sea in winter, and you should be able to play in the sand and bask in the sun in summer.
Service: The welcome fruit and snacks are very good on the first day. Because it is the Spring Festival, I also gave red wine. The service staff are very enthusiastic. It was my birthday on the day of check-out, and they sent red wine before they had time to deliver the birthday cake.
Catering: The breakfast is still very rich and tastes good. It is worth living in a branded hotel during the peak tourist season.

Although I understand that the room is tight during the Spring Festival, I still have to wait when I arrive at the store so late. After so long, I feel a little disappointed. KIKI at the front desk immediately informed that 2 or 3 employees would be sent to speed up the cleaning, and introduced the advantages of this room. Finally, it took 20 minutes to check in. This must be likedüëç

Breakfast is eaten in the executive lounge on the fourth floor. You can see the sea from the window. The dishes are more exquisite, and the staff are meticulous and patient!

This is the first time I can describe it as a home away from home. The Shangri-La brand of hardware is naturally excellent, but I still have to praise the gym equipment is very complete, the facilities in the children‚Äôs playground are also new and well maintained, and the young lady and brother of the Kid‚Äôs club are more patient than kindergarten teachers. From concierge, check-in, guest room to restaurant, all the waiters are not only professional but also proactive in serving customers and thinking about it. Even the wicker chairs outside can be wiped clean immediately after the rain, without any stagnant water. When I checked in during the Spring Festival, red wine and New Year‚Äôs snack fruit plate were delivered on the morning of the first day of the new year. There were macarons on the second day of the new year. There were activities in the lobby every day. I also participated in the New Year celebrations in other hotels before. Generally, the organization and materials are very watery. But they make dumplings on New Year‚Äôs Eve, lion dance on the first day of junior high school, fish fish on the second day of junior high school...every activity is meticulous, and even the always picky mother-in-law came back and told me that we will only live in Shangri-La in the future.

The breakfast category is very rich, but it is close to the Spring Festival when the guests are full and need to queue up to eat, so you should avoid peak dining hours.
It's a pity that I didn't bring a baby. This is a parent-child hotel, and there are many parent-child activities. Next time if you bring a baby, you still want to live here.

I can not only see the invincible sea view, but also bring children In the evening, you can taste delicious food in the Horizon Club without any burden. This time, from meeting KiKi at the check-in front desk, to the front desk service staff who helped coordinate throughout the continuation of the stay, they are very professional and friendly, which reflects that Xiang has always had taste.
And it was a worthwhile trip. We happened to watch the ancestor worship and lion dance performances in the first grade of junior high school, which left a deep impression on the children.
But the fly in the oin**ent is that the three-year epidemic may have a certain impact on every industry. Because of the 18-year comparison, the hardware facilities of the hotel, including room configuration and taste, are different from those of other cities. The configuration of the Horizon Club has declined, and I hope that with the end of the epidemic, it can return to its proper level

            The lady in the room service depar**ent [Zhu Yuanyuan] is very kind and the service is very user-friendly.
            
Disadvantages: [The rice is unpalatable] The bread is like leftovers. It should be soft or not, and it should not be crispy. The same goes for the fried dough sticks. The potato salad and potatoes are also stiff. The food is not very rich and the taste is too average. The breakfast fruit is just the same. Of those two or three items, I chose them because of the reviews on how delicious they areüò†
[Poor front desk service] The first front desk lady was not skilled in business and was a bit panicked. She couldn't figure out the specific amount of the price deposit. The second lady called was not much better, and the room fee and reservation amount were also different. This is the first time I've seen it. ‚ö†Ô∏èNote that their deposit seems to be rounded up with the room fee. The second lady firmly said that the deposit is 500 per night, but I paid more. Although she said that I can withdraw and charge it again... it is not enough. It's troublesome, I won't let you go.
After checking in, no one cares about you. When you turn around, your suitcase is there by itself. You can show me where to go. I feel like the doorman taking the luggage is superfluous. I might as well hold it myself.
Bring your own plastic slippers, they don't have them at home.

msg:very happy to live
On the first day of unlocking the upgrade, enjoying the high-rise panoramic view and having two mornings and two nights, I immediately canceled the plan to go to other hotels
The next morning, I saw a beautiful sunrise landscape. My daughter-in-law said, go to the beach to watch the sunrise, it feels the best in the room!
The breakfast food is very rich and the taste is also very good. The service staff encountered are very nice!
I forgot to bring a swimming cap and goggles when I went swimming. The newly bought ones are a little expensive. After two laps, I get tired.
Downstairs is the beach, just a few minutes walk away!
We both like this hotel very much, we think the best attraction in Xiamen is our room, hahaha
But when traveling like us, the starting point is also a bit high. I don‚Äôt know what will happen next time I go out.
If possible, I would still choose Shangri-La!

During our stay, we were warmly received by the executive lounge staff Li Chengwei and her colleagues, which made us feel at home. The children also liked this young lady very much and were moved by her enthusiasm, patience and carefulness. The environment of the executive lounge is very good, especially suitable for dining with children, the service is good when there are fewer people, and the children will not make too many noises. Because the feeling of staying was so good, we temporarily extended the stay for one night. Miss Li Chengwei helped to handle the whole process, and all aspects were considered very thoughtful and considerate. Next time, I will continue to stay at the Horizon Club customer service. In addition, I would like to thank Chen Yongrui, the manager of the restaurant on the first floor, for introducing us to many places, and also giving two children lollipops üç≠.

Geographical location: It is very close to Guanyinshan Beach, Wanda and Wuyuan Bay, and it is a little far from Gulangyu Island, but taxis on the island are within half an hour, so it is not a big problem.
Service attitude: very good, I am very satisfied after staying for 5 nights. When I get off the car, I will help to drive my head, I will help to pick up the courier, and I will deliver fruit. The key is to check in (2 people, a male front desk and a female front desk, the attitude is very good, Very considerate from the customer's point of view) and the check-out front desk (Mia) and the cleaning aunts have a very good attitude, and will pay attention to our taste and give more tea bags to the ones we like.
Overall facilities: The rooms are spacious and all very good.
In addition, it is recommended for friends who come to the hotel to order the Chashan Kirin Melon from the Chashan Pie and the Mushroom Flower Nail Powder which is like a 60-year-old powder (the 6-year-old is very fresh)!

Special thanks to a round-faced beauty at the front desk for upgrading our room. Along the way, the aunt who cleaned the room was also very warm and friendly.

There is a stool for drying clothes outside the shower room, a plastic bag is provided in the locker for the convenience of residents to put their swimsuits, and there is a slippers disinfection cabinet at the door of the locker room. There is also a spa pool inside which is very comfortable.
Location: Close to Guanyin Mountain, there is a large beach in front of the hotel, the sand quality is not bad, although not as famous as Huangcuo Beach, but it is enough for baby walks. This is the business district of Xiamen. It is indeed not as lively as Zengcuo'an, but fortunately it is clean. It is a little farther to the scenic spots, but Xiamen is not big. If you want to go to various scenic spots, it only takes 20 minutes to take a taxi. It is very convenient. Take a taxi to Zeng Cuo'an is about 10 kilometers away.
Breakfast: The breakfast is very rich and tastes good. The sand tea noodles are the best I have eaten these days. There are various Chinese dim sums, some with Hokkien characteristics and some conventional ones. The ingredients are very fresh. The juices are all freshly squeezed, there are many choices, and the fruits are also various and fresh. The sushi rolls are well done.
Xiamen Shangri-La really made us experience the feeling of a vacation, and the favorability of the Shangri-La brand has doubled. In the future, we will definitely choose Xiamen.

Opposite the hotel is the Guanyin Mountain Beach, and the children have a lot of fun. The hotel has a very rich breakfast, as well as a variety of Hokkien specialty snacks. It is also very convenient to order food at night. It tastes good and the price is affordable. I especially praise Wei Jiajia, the deputy manager of the restaurant. The service is very considerate, and I also gave the baby a small gift. This trip was very pleasant. , I will consider staying in Xiamen next time I come to Xiamen

The lounge is very good, the steak and sand tea noodles for breakfast are delicious, and there are many happy hour things, which are delicious. There is a children's playground on the negative floor, which can be played for free. In addition, it is very close to the beach. When the tide is low, you can catch hermit crabs and small fish on the beach. The child accidentally broke the mouthwash cup and did not ask for compensation, and even gave a bear when he checked out.

msg:I spent six days and five nights in Xiamen, because I wanted to see the scenery around the island and the late-night wine market, I chose Shangri-La next to Guanyin Mountain Beach for the last two days.

Service: The service of the hotel is nothing to say. The little flower of Horizon Club is warm and lovely, and is our most considerate little housekeeper these two days; the service center hotline response speed is also very fast; check-in and check-out are also very smooth.

Meals: The breakfast and afternoon tea on the fourth floor are also very good, there are few people and it is very quiet, and the dishes and drinks are also very rich.

Transportation: It is very convenient to take a taxi. It takes ten to twenty minutes to go to the airport; if you are shopping for one or two kilometers, you can take a taxi to Wanda for a starting price; it is very close to the subway, 300 meters, and it is a short walk to Taipei Road. , Guanyin Mountain 2 mouths. We went to Jimei to play the subway, transfer from No. 2 to No. 1, and experienced the most beautiful sea subway in the section of Gaoqi-Jimei Village.

All of the above are worthy of affirmation.

As we get older, the places we live in these years have gradually changed from youth hostels, fast and designer hotels to five-star hotels. In conclusion, five-star hotels are more suitable for family travel, or parent-child travel with children. Facilities More complete, fitness children's rooms are available.

The disadvantages are also obvious. Laundry is expensive. In summer, a t-shirt is 40 yuan, and it is easy to make noise when there are too many children. This time we made a note not to be next to the parent-child room, but it is almost all family outings, so there are still upstairs and next to it. Children, the sound of running and jumping and children's screams are still very obvious. In addition, there are many meetings these days, and there are concerts at the beach at night, so it is a bit noisy during breaks. .

Another disadvantage is the hotel facilities. The layout of the old hotel is quite satisfactory. There are three points of dissatisfaction. First, the bedside socket is too far. -2m charging cable); the second is the hair dryer, the function of induction is too tasteless, it is better to have a button that keeps pressing to give the wind, if you grasp it loosely, there is no response, if you grasp it tightly, it does not fit the handle, and there is no response, so do it. It‚Äôs better for the lady with the hairstyle to bring her own hair dryer; there is no garbage bag in the five-star hotel. As a Virgo, it is very uncomfortable, because I don‚Äôt know what the last guest has thrown, and I am afraid that the things I throw will stick to the garbage. On the bucket, it affects the cleaning aunt, and it is particularly troublesome for girls during their menstrual period. It is recommended that girls bring their own garbage bags during their menstrual period.

The hotel is a good hotel, the service has nothing to say, but it is still necessary to keep pace with the times and learn new hotels, in terms of details. The last designer hotel we stayed in, except for someone at the front desk, couldn't see the staff, just scan the code in the room if necessary, but they did a good job of even the small details such as the charging socket, the laundry room is self-service 24 hours a day, young On the whole, there are fewer people than the elderly and children. Although the room was almost full, the room was very quiet for the two nights and I slept well.

The parent-child space downstairs is a chargeable item, because staying in the parent-child room will give you a free day of play. The opposite is Guanyin Mountain, a good place to watch the sunrise and dig sand. Great for families with children. The free desserts given in the evening amazed me. Although the chocolate tastes average, it is very delicate. The only regret is that the swimming pool does not have a toddler pool, but the children's play area has made them reluctant.

In the evening, you can have a light meal in the executive lounge on the 4th floor and go to the beach. The services at the front desk, guest room, and lounge are all in place. The children came back from the sea in the evening and asked for four-fruit soup, but I didn't expect that the room was already set up in advance. It was a coincidence. Thank you to Zhu Yuanyuan on the 21F. After that, I went to the beach with one country, two systems to catch the sea, and stayed at a hotel in front of the Xiangshan Yacht Club. The price was similar, but the overall drop was obvious to the naked eye.

msg:I thought I ordered Shangri-La
But after checking in, I found that the service and hygiene are not at the level of Shangri-La

1. I called to confirm the room before I went there. No one answered the call twice. I felt a little strange. Why is there no one at the front desk of the hotel. Finally got through.

2. On the first day of check-in, I found that there were residual tin foil in the bathroom from the opening of the bottle of toiletries. At night, I pushed the double bed together and found that there was chocolate paper under the bed.

3. Mr. took a bath and found that there was no rain on his head. He asked the hotel, and the hotel said that every room has it. Looking up, it really didn't... Then he said that he helped to change the sea view room, and there was no overhead shower.

4. When I came back from outside the next day, I had a heavy bag of mineral water in my hand. Because it was too heavy and I couldn't make it, but I wanted to return the hotel umbrella, I asked the waiter at the door to help return the hotel umbrella. The waiter said that he was on duty at the door and there was no way to help. When I walked into the hotel with difficulty, I saw that I was alone with my baby, with a big schoolbag and a big bag of water in my hand. There were no waiters who had nothing to do, and no one came up to help, and I was too lazy to call me a bell boy...

5. On the third day, I wanted to call the room dining service, but found that there was no menu in the room. Called 2 times and no one answered (in response to the first call before check-in and no one answered). Called the third time to pick up, the front desk said to ask the customer service to bring the menu. I waited a day and didn't get it...

6. The children's play area in the hotel is actually paid for? I don't quite understand this. The children's paradise area of the star-rated hotel is open to the staying customers free of charge.

7. Take the baby to swim, but there is no towel provided at the scene...

8, the sea view is still good, the apology is still very timely

But health + service details do need to be improved...

It takes 10 minutes to walk to Guanyinshan Station on the subway. It is very convenient to have a nucleic acid detection point next to the subway station.

Our 2 adults and 2 children stayed for two nights. This one was specially chosen. The hotel includes a parent-child room, an amu*****t park, a gym and a swimming pool. The parent-child room was a bit disappointing. After I successfully placed the order for the room of the Egyptian cute baby, the customer service and the hotel front desk called and said that it was gone. Changed Mickey and Minnie's parent-child room, but there was no result, just changed blue sheets and a children's tent. Fortunately, the hotel is very close to the beach and can be reached in seven or eight minutes on foot. The hotel has free beach toys that can be borrowed. Then walk 700 meters along the roundabout road to reach the Dreamland World and Water World. Children can play all day. The hotel breakfast is ok. There is an amu*****t park, gym and heated swimming pool on the negative floor. When checking out, the hotel sent two small gifts to the children. The overall satisfaction is that the sea can be seen from the window of the room, and the scenery of Huandao Road is really beautiful.

You can drive a whole beautiful road around the island, and it doesn't matter if it is far away. The hotel is just across the road from the beach.
üîîService: We ordered a Ctrip package, Ctrip customer service actively helped us arrange a baby cot, and the hotel also helped us upgrade the room type when we checked in, and the overall service was ok.
üçÉEnvironment: The room is not big, this is an upgraded room, and the facilities are average. The TV cannot be projected, there is no heated toilet seat, and there is no speaker. It does not meet my expectations for the hardware facilities of a five-star hotel.
 The package includes a two-hour experience coupon for the hotel's children's club. Although the club is not big, the children still have a good time. This is why I chose to live here with my baby this time. Unfortunately, there is only two hours of experience time, no It's too good, the staff will persuade them to quit as soon as the time is up, which is a bit disappointing

During the epidemic, the hotel's epidemic prevention work felt the cordial and responsible inspection work of the uncle security guard as soon as he entered the underground parking lot.

msg:üöó Transportation:
Hotel parking lot parking is free, just report the license plate number when you check in. When we went on Saturday, there were quite a lot of parking spaces in the underground garage. There are also subway stations nearby.

üçÉEnvironment:
The overall environment is good.
Let me talk about the outside first: because the hotel is next to the Guanyin Landscape World, close to the beach. There is also a business center nearby. If the lighting of each company building is turned on at night, the night view is still very good.
The internal environment of the hotel is good and the facilities are relatively complete. It is suitable for families with children, including a children‚Äôs club, indoor swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi, gym and so on.
Although the swimming pool is indoor with a constant temperature, I asked the lifeguard, he said that the temperature was set at 29¬∞, and he let me see it. It was indeed 29¬∞, but I felt that the water was not warm enough that day.

üí∞Price
What I bought was a package including children's club tickets for 988/night. Ctrip did not clearly specify the hotel accommodation conditions. In fact, if you stay in the hotel, children are also free to go to the children‚Äôs playground. The extra money was spent in vain... I feel like a routine, and I am still a Ctrip platinum member.

üîîService:
The service is okay, except that breakfast in the cafeteria is a bit unpleasant, everything else is fine.

üßπSanitation: The overall sanitation is not bad, but some places of sanitation are dusty. It is estimated that there are fewer residents in the epidemic situation and fewer rooms are cleaned.

food:
The type of breakfast is average, not as rich as other five-star hotels.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel environment is good, the epidemic prevention and control equipment is fully equipped, the sea view room is not facing the sea, the sea view room is average, it is not recommended
üîîServices: 1. When I checked in, I asked if I need membership points. The front desk said it could be found. Then the front office manager of the room called to ask for the membership number. The check-in experience is not affected, but the details shouldn‚Äôt be there. Kind of wrong; 2. I asked for mineral water, room service was delivered quickly, praise! 3. Return to the hotel at two in the morning and hope to check out at two o'clock in the morning. The front office arranges the processing quickly and praises it.
facility:
Compliment 1, there is a dressing table, which is especially friendly to ladies! Praise 2, breakfast is richer!
Tucao 1, I came to Xiamen to live in Indigo and Xiaxiang. The most obvious contrast is that Xiaxiang is not like a hotel opened in 2017. The facilities are outdated. Electric curtains and smart toilets are not standard equipment;
Tucao 2, there is no room for shoe handles and handbags. Is it cost saving? The details are not good;
Tucao 3, the day of check-out happened to be the birthday of my wife‚Äôs ID card. For a brand hotel like Shangri-La, the system could not have any registration and prompts, but the hotel did not say anything. We also received birthday desserts on Eastern Airlines on the same day. The comparison highlights the weakness of Xiaxiang, which is far from Shangri-La's purpose of creating unexpected surprises for guests (uploading photos only reminds me of Tucao point 4: the hotel provides ice and dew water).
In general, Xiamen and his party checked Indigo and Xiaxiang, and recommended Indigo Seaview Room (opposite Gulangyu Island).

There is an ocean theme park but I want to go Nanputuo Temple‚Äôs Zengcuo‚Äôan Eighth Strait Market Xiamen University is relatively far away, unless you‚Äôre driving, it costs 100 yuan to take a taxi around the Petronas Twin Towers. It is very quiet near the hotel. Guanyinshan Beach is very beautiful and not at the doorstep. How many people are more suitable for taking pictures in the evening

The package is very cost-effective, including Wanda Studios movie tickets and karting tickets and children's playground. The breakfast is also very rich! Very suitable for bringing children

msg:The location of the hotel is a 5-minute walk from the nearest Guanyinshan subway station, which is quite convenient. It's just that if you come from Xiamen Station or the airport, you can only take a taxi. The hotel's facilities, especially the furniture in the room, are a bit shabby. The bathroom is not separated from wet and dry. There is no tea set in the water bar in the room. It is borrowed from the room service. It is said that they have been borrowed. As a five-star, the room area is a bit small, and the only advantage is that you can see the sea view and the sunrise, which makes up for all the defects. The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool and changing rooms are worth recommending. There is a jacuzzi, a steam room and a medicine smoker, so you can relax after a swim. The breakfast was average. I had salad and fruit diarrhea on the first day, but the coffee was good, stronger than other five-star hotels, and the coffee beans felt fresher.

In the past, the baby was inspected and brought the children a very comfortable mood. The hotel environment is very good and high-end positioning

msg:The hotel is located in the business district of Guanyinshan, Huandao East Road, in the island. If you are traveling, it is best to choose Xiamen Station, which can be reached by 127 Road. On the west side of the hotel, there is the headquarters of Quanzhou Jinjiang big-name shoe and clothing group, such as Anta Jiumu Wangqi brand, etc. There are row upon row of high-rise business buildings, and the night light show is beautiful. When you cross the road or underground passage, you will arrive at the Guanyin Mountain sand disaster. At night, the sea breeze is breezy, the crowd is surging, and there are people lighting the lights to drive the sea! The rooms are well equipped, and you can enjoy the minibar. The indoor swimming pool is open for a long time, so you can soak in the jacuzzi or sauna after üèäüèª. Remember to prepare your swimsuit. The little sister of the hotel staff is very good. I recommend that I take Metro Line 2 at the nearby Metro Guanyinshan Station to Lucuo and transfer to Line 1 (Xiamen North Station, reserved). Makes my whole journey pleasant and smooth. This year is the 50th anniversary celebration of Shangri-La Hotel, and Shangri-La Xiamen is the world's hundredth store. If you evaluate it, give it 100% satisfaction and five-star praise.

The waiter Lili Xue on the 19th floor has a good working attitude and is professional and serious. It is worthy of praise. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is very good, especially the dough sticks are soaked in the noodles. The batter is super fragrant, but the buffet at noon is better. The stir-fried dishes are very delicious with a cup of green tea. Anyway, I still have to come back.

Xiamen Shangri-La, from the front desk staff to the Horizon Club staff and the room staff, are all good. Horizon Club has a high sense of active service, the service in the room is very considerate and meticulous, and the service at the front desk is very timely.
very good!
