msg:It is not fair to rate MH as hotel, because it is not a hotel. It is not even a House, it is an experience! I have received Studio 90 upon my arrival and even it was late in the evening, i was taken away by design and beautiful yet minimalist decoration. Everything had its function and purporse. It is not the place you want to leave (and explore city) but the one you want to live. 
Things i really appreciated: space, airiness, bed linens (gosh, i tried to find the secret of the softness = brand, but all i found was MH tag), place to work and place to chill (yes, in the same room), speaker, coffee machine, diversity of the brands - including local artists, real plants... just to name few.
Things to consider: i may be picky right now but placement of coffee machine. While neatly stored in cupboard, to operate the machine requires to take it half out. Without that won't be possible to open capsule's feeder. I had to be careful to take it out just enough and not drop the machine. And it just because i drink a lot coffee, i had to do it quite often. Is that preventing me to come back? No way! Is that preventing me to drink less coffee? Now way^2! :) The second thing i definitely would change is my own planning. The moment i saw the studio, i regretted i have early departure/check-out. I would love to spend more time at MH. 
My last paragraph goes to MH employees. Everyone, from front desk, bell boys to room service and crew taking care of cleanliness was extremely polite and customer oriented. Big Âä†Ê≤π to leadership to create such working space, where the team can show up at their best. 

Until next time!

The pool and spa areas were a very nice place to relax and there was always friendly staff waiting to assist us. The resturaunts nearby are expensive but so delicious. Try Frasca and ordering from room service if you've got spare cash to spend! Also check out the shopping area across the street by the metro!!

All in all, a fantastic staycation in Shanghai not far from home!

Located in Taikoo Hui, not only is the subway very convenient, but there are also many things to do even if you just want to walk. In addition to Taikoo Hui's own business, it is also very close to Zhangyuan and Fengshengli.

The only drawback is that the hotel facilities are not well maintained, and they are obviously old. The Sukhothai next door is also a hotel that opened at about the same time. The maintenance level is much better. The others are still very good

She carefully introduced the room design, supplies details and supporting services. After staying in this hotel, it is better than other hotels of the same level. Of the hotels, this one has the best service.

I booked a room of 50 square meters and later upgraded it to 60 square meters. It is recommended to stay in a room of 60 square meters. The view is much wider and unobstructed. It is great to face the street view. I like the setting and shower system of the shower room. It would be better if it could be equipped with an extra shower support and a higher height. (Ps. The hot water kettle and coffee machine can be pulled out for use.)

There is no door in the shower room. If you don't pay attention, water will spray outside and get everywhere. 2. There is a big problem with the electric curtains; they get stuck when going down, and when they go up, they find they can no longer go up halfway. 3. The speaker follows the instructions and does not work at all. 4. The location of the coffee machine is unreasonable. To place the capsules, you need to move the coffee machine out of the cabinet to have space to open the lid. The noise and vibration during operation seem to be damaged. 5. The sound insulation is not good, the sound in the corridor can be heard clearly, and there are people knocking on the door next door early in the morning.
In short, there are too many better choices at the same price...

msg:I've stayed at The Middle House a few times and I liked it quite a bit, so I chose here even if it was just a quick one night. Because we flew to Shanghai in the early morning, it was already almost three o'clock after I got to the hotel to wash up. I knew that there would be a guest room asking for laundry the next morning, so I pressed Do Not Disturb on purpose. Unexpectedly, at 9:30, we heard the sound of swiping a card to enter the room. We woke up and asked who it was. The person who came said sorry and left, leaving us in shock. After calling the front desk to communicate, they said that the new waiter didn't understand that the red light meant DND and wanted to come in for cleaning, but he was too lazy to accept the explanation. But as a room attendant, it's far-fetched to not understand the most basic DND, and to be able to directly swipe a card into a guest's room, not to mention I'm only staying for one night and don't need to clean it. When I left, I forgot the card package in the room. I came back to get it and told us whether the room had been cleaned. Let us confirm whether it was on us. My husband insisted on going in and found it in the room. I didn't understand what was being cleaned in this room. , anyway, the experience this time is really bad, I probably won‚Äôt choose it again in the future.

msg:Half a year later, I stayed in the Middle House again.
First of all, I was impressed by the hotel's copywriting: room card cover - houses not hotels; elevator screen - our house your home; menu page - have a nice stay. It is a house located in the HKRI Taikoo Hui business district, but it is magically isolated from the hustle and bustle, making it quiet and just like going home.
The simple design of the hotel struck a chord with me. I really like the bouquet of flowers next to the sofa. I can't get enough of it. I can't get enough of it. The supplement is Bamford, the smell of peppermint oil is soothing and reassuring. The small refrigerator is always full, and there is always plenty of SIMRA mineral water/sparkling water, milk, coconut water, beer, various carbonated drinks... I really like the big shower head in the bathroom, it sprinkles like a warm rain.
This time when I came to the hotel, I thanked MIA, who is also a good friend of mine, for helping me upgrade a 70-square-meter room, and also gave me a facial mask from the hotel spa, which is really useful!
In addition, she also gave me breakfast as a gift, and I finally had breakfast in The Middle House! For breakfast, you can choose from a set menu or a la carte, each of which is of high quality and delicious. I highly recommend the coconut oa**eal fruit bowl in picture 6, it‚Äôs so delicious. I remember that on the first day of the New Year in 2024, Mary from the restaurant served me this cereal bowl and said Happy New Year with a smile. This is the beginning of a warm and healing year~
The middle house, our home.

Needless to say, the location is very close to the Bund and Jing'an. The sanitary environment is clean, and the most surprising thing is that the accompanying acoustics are better than many luxury hotels.

I stayed in The Middle House for one or two weeks in 2021 and 2022, and this is my third time staying there.

2. There seems to be no exhaust in the bathroom.
3. Guests leaving the hotel had to carry their suitcases when they got on the bus, but the doorman didn't help close the trunk. What's going on? ? ?
4. The service attitude is great. It‚Äôs for a cow, so I probably look poor.
5. It‚Äôs just a hotel with a bit of design, but not much. At this price, I personally feel that I can stay in other hotels with the same price and the comfort will be more comfortable!
6. I just wanted to try a new hotel this time, which was disappointing.

msg:I chose The Middle House in Shanghai for vacation. The hotel is located in Xingye Taikoo Hui, and the third floor can directly reach the shopping mall. I feel that this is better than The Opposite House in Beijing. During the summer vacation, I specially chose a hotel away from the scenic spots with a lot of traffic, but the traffic is not discounted, and the subway is convenient.
The hotel is surrounded by green bamboo, and the design also contains many bamboo elements, creating a sense of quiet urban oasis. The hotel rooms are very designed, and the whole room is like a delicate work of art. Although it has been open for a while, the facilities have no signs of aging at all, the maintenance is in place, and the hygiene is satisfactory. The hotel's maxbar drinks are very rich and all are free except alcohol, which is better than many luxury hotels.
The bedding linen is very comfortable, and I really feel very relaxed when I wake up. The pillows are relatively short and soft. Next time I stay, I will ask for higher pillows in advance.
The service staff is professional and enthusiastic, but not overly intrusive, and I feel very good.
Just like the so-called "home in Shanghai" of The Middle House Hotel, maybe I will choose to return to this "home in Shanghai" on my next trip

I'm a little surprised that there are so many things in this hotel. There is a salon, a swimming pool, and a spa for makeup and nails. It's really convenient, to be honest.

Service: There are two enthusiastic staff at the front desk that made me a lot happier on this trip. One is Kin and the other is a girl who forgot her name. They all actively responded to our needs.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. It is a part of Xingye Taikoo Hui. The road leading to the lobby on the first floor is full of bamboos, which gives you a feeling of tranquility amidst the noise.

After check-in, someone accompanied me to the room and gave a brief introduction. This trea**ent has also been encountered at the Waldorf Astoria on the Bund. The decoration of the room is modern and simple, with low-key luxury and attention to detail. The welcome fruit is very good, with a variety of varieties, and a bottle of Voreau champagne is also given.

Breakfast is on the third floor, semi-self-service order, the environment and service are impeccable, but there are not many varieties of self-service.

Overall, it is a good place to relax and the best choice for staycation.

I will only deliver it to you when I find it is gone. It will take half an hour to deliver it. Otherwise, I will leave it at the door without knocking and not telling you that it has been delivered. Ten minutes after checking in, I found that the balcony door could not be opened. I asked the luggage delivery person to open the balcony door, but he couldn't do it, so he finally left it to me. Then we found that the balcony umbrella couldn't be opened and asked him to open it. He couldn't, so he called someone to come over and open it for a long time. He said it was broken and asked a master to repair it. We waited for an hour and didn't come. We urged them and said they would come, so the next three No one comes here every day, **********, why don‚Äôt we just stop cultivating? And the environment, it‚Äôs just like a bad season. I stayed here for 3,510 nights and didn‚Äôt even give me 10,000 paper towels, toothpaste or shower gel for three days. It‚Äôs really a big complaint!

‚ù§Ô∏èThe minibar has everything you need, and the turndown will be added very thoughtfully, and the sound of Native union x la boite is also very satisfying;
Needless to say how comfortable the bedding is, you will know by experiencing it yourself~
I have to mention that the breakfast should be one of the best in all luxury hotels in Shanghai. The pistachio croissant and lemongrass wonton rice noodles and eggs Benedict are must-order~ Although it is a must-see for Internet celebrities, the taste is really good. It is much better than the title quality of the so-called Internet celebrities.
I should want to go to a hotel to lie down from time to time~

The hotel is very private, and the overall color is darker, which really feels like a quiet place amidst the hustle and bustle. The room style is an Italian romantic design. On my friend's birthday, the hotel took the initiative to help us upgrade the room, extend the check-out time, and even send cakes and gifts. I'm so happy. The service is very good. Edwin at the front desk and Sally the housekeeper are very friendly. The 3rd floor of the hotel is connected to Xingye TaiKoo Hui, and the subway line 13 is just below, which is very convenient. The hotel's breakfast is mainly semi-buffet. The service and taste are very good. The only regret this time is that if the room next door uses water, the sewer will make noise. Everything else is great. I will come again next time, this time I didn't have time to experience the spa and swimming pool.
Service: fantastic

The location of the hotel is very good
Right in Shanghai TaiKoo Hui, a bustling neighborhood

The third floor of the hotel is actually connected to the shopping mall, but the main entrance is not on the side of the shopping mall, but behind the shopping mall. If you drive, you have to go around.

Entering inside, there is no hotel LOGO on the outside of the gate, but you can clearly see two grass-green pillars standing like two bamboos. You can also see three retro bicycles hidden behind the glass at the door, pulled in from both sides, and come to the hall.

As soon as you enter, you will see a super large chandelier, which looks a bit like a jellyfish hanging upside down. The decoration on the lamp post is also very interesting, it looks like a blooming flower. The walls around the chandelier are mainly turquoise, which looks very lively.

The innermost is the waiting area, with several sofas, a few paintings on the wall, and a fireplace for decoration.

As far as the hotel lobby is concerned, it is quite spacious overall, and the best angle to shoot the chandelier is from the sofa, which is very good.

After checking in at the front desk, take the elevator to the floor where the room belongs. During the process, you will see a lot of decorations in the elevator and corridors, which are quite thoughtful.

Entering the room, the first thing you see is the welcome card on the table, and a plate full of fruits. There are many kinds of fruits, which look more sincere and warm.

Entering the room, the overall layout is relatively simple.

The bathroom is on the right hand side of the entrance. The shower space in the bathroom is quite special. There is no additional door, but its depth is relatively high, and the water will not flow out casually.

The bathtub is not completely exposed, but half of it is hidden behind the washing table, making full use of the space inside.

When you come out of the bathroom, there is a big bed next to it. The TV is quite special. It is not directly facing the bed, but is tucked in a corner alone.

There is a Bluetooth speaker under the TV. If you open the curtain behind, turn on the TV, and lie on the bed and watch it, it is like a whole painting.
The whole room is still very empty, it is a pity that the view from my side is not very good. Looking out from the glass in the room, you can see an office building and other apar**ents in The Middle House. It feels like many eyes are looking at you.

The overall decoration style of the room is Chinese-style minimalist, and the stay is quite comfortable. In addition, there is a SPA place under the apar**ent, and I also went to visit it.

The waiting area is set behind the cashier, and there are two kinds of sofa chairs, black and yellow. Here I will introduce some SPA items for you to choose.

There are two single beds in the room, and there is a bathing place inside, where you can change clothes, take a shower, go to the toilet, etc., which is standard for five-star hotels.

The strength of the massage in this spa shop is good in all aspects, and the bed can be heated, so you are not afraid of the cold in winter.

Overall,
The hotel service at The Middle House is pretty good.
The overall decoration follows the simple Chinese style.
Although not much is revealed on the surface,
But it has everything it should have, not bad at all.

Overall,
The location of the hotel is really unique.
Coming out is the Starbucks flagship store,
There are also a large number of restaurants in Taikoo Hui,
The traffic in the city center is very convenient in all aspects.
But a warm reminder:
Taxi or bus is prone to traffic jams,
The subway is more recommended for travel.
The Opposite House in Beijing, The Upper House in Hong Kong, The Temple House in Chengdu
And this Shanghai Middle House Hotel,
It also belongs to the residence series under the TaiKoo Hui Hotel Group,
The style is mainly Chinese minimalist style,
It is quite interesting to check in a family when you go to a city.

Environment: Not bad, the room is not 60 square meters visually, it may be allocated to the cloakroom, the dry and wet separation is not good, water splashes everywhere after taking a bath, the bed is very comfortable to sleep on.
Service: The most dissatisfactory thing is that there are so many customers that the front desk is busy, and the tone is extremely impatient. He works in a hurry and doesn't look like he has been trained at all. When he calls for help to send a courier upstairs, his voice is very loud. It took me a long time to answer the phone. No one greeted or smiled when I entered and exited the lobby. The staff was extremely indifferent.

The hotel's facilities are very good, both hardware and software are excellent. Because the children live together, the twin room seems to be small, but it doesn't affect the experience. One point is deducted from the fact that the bed is a bit small. If it is a 1.35 double bed, it should be better.

It is 1.2 kilometers away from the Shanghai Grand Theater. You can walk back after watching the opera. It is less than one kilometer away from the History Museum (Old Art Museum) and 1.6 kilometers away from the museum. It is really surrounded by music, art, history, fashion, and trendy brands. The room design and lighting design are very reasonable, and the sound insulation is good. The fly in the oin**ent is that the water bar is too far away from the bathroom, it is not so convenient to rinse the cup and pour water, and the breakfast is generally delicious.

In addition, I am very grateful to the careful Nifty for helping to upgrade the room...
It also introduces delicious local drunk crabs in Shanghai, and a bubble bath test is also given on Valentine's Day! This trip to Shanghai is very happy, and I will stay at The Middle House again!

I personally don't think it's a parent-child family, but the service is indeed the best domestic luxury hotel I've stayed in so far! It is worthy of the price of 2500. After check-in, the invitation and welcome drink, I chose the ice American style, my friend and grapefruit juice, and other types, which is very generous! The little girl who checks in at the front desk is very impressive. She is enthusiastic, careful and fast. She is the one who checks out. This time I found out that her name is Joy.

After staying on the highest floor, we were particularly moved by the house-like experience. The attention paid to details by The Middle House is admirable. The blue drawstring at the head of the bed is the master control of all the lights in the room, full of a sense of ceremony. At the end of the busy Spring Festival, I got a real relaxation here. The most heart-warming thing is the beautiful woman Sally from The Middle House. The whole service is super five-star. It makes us feel like home. It is very beautiful.

Called through the front desk to extend the stay for a few days, and then called to change the price after informing the renewal, which was confusing but all resolved. The attitude of some staff at the front desk is not OK. They smell like Cathay Pacific. After processing, they said thank you indifferently and turned their heads without making a sound. There is no basic courtesy. The cleanliness of the room is OK, but the tiles in the bathroom and toilet should be cleaned regularly. There is also scale in the gaps. After all, it is a hotel that has been around for several years, so it is passable. I didn't see the reminder card for changing the bedding. I don't know the normal replacement cycle of the hotel. I haven't changed it for a few days. The windows of the room cannot be opened for ventilation. It would be nice to open a little air gap.

You can enjoy a bottle of champagne and bubble bath every time you stay at the hotel: After returning to the hotel after dinner in the evening, I found that the staff helped to close the curtains, took the slippers, petals, champagne and helped to prepare them, as well as the soft drinks in the refrigerator. Made up ~ full of details ~ I will really be moved ü•π
Breakfast: The suggestion is to use less oil and less salt (maybe I'm a dieter and feel a little too oily, especially the one-sided bacon sourdough bread, but it should be ok for normal people to eat), there is an oa**eal that is also delicious and there is This sand tea noodle is really the signature of The Middle House! Really yyds! ! ! Then I came to Shanghai this time for my birthday (I explained it to the hotel in advance). The lady at the front desk of the hotel arranged a strawberry cake and gave a small gift of scented candles (the cake is delicious, I like it very much, thank you üòò)
Last but not least, I would like to express the ladies at the front desk of The Middle House, they are all so good! very gentle! Looking forward to meeting with The Middle House and you next time, see you next time~

The overall price/performance ratio is average. Except for the abundant mini bar and the relatively large rotatable angle of the TV, the rest have no major features. They are all standard in this type of hotel, but the attitude of the front desk staff is indeed very good.
However, there will be missed orders and poor room service.

Needless to say, the location of the Taikoo Residences series is in the city center and the transportation is very convenient, just in Taikoo Hui.

Service Hygiene:
There was soot on the sofa in the room, and the teapot was blocked by debris. I called and responded to the front desk, but there was no apology during the whole process. Even when the clean teapot was delivered from the guest room, it was handed to me and left.

surroundings:
The design of the hotel is really good, but as far as the positioning of the hotel is concerned, it is not very good among hotels of the same level.

breakfast: 
üçÖTomato juice is not freshly squeezed, Bandinik Egg is not bad, baked potatoes are my favorite (a bit like Patatas bravas in Spain üòã)

Generally speaking, the experience of The Middle House in Shanghai is not very good.

msg:First time writing a review. I really can't help but want to comment on your hotel.
Service: The front desk who called and confirmed with me before I checked in first mispronounced my name, and then misread the remark request. After I corrected and confirmed with the front desk on the same day that the note was not the "wedding anniversary" she said, the information confirmed by the front desk that I checked in with me and the layout of the room was still the wedding anniversary. It is really embarrassing to stay with friends of the same sex.
Facilities: On the night of check-in, I found that the TV projection screen could not be connected (later it was found that it was indeed a problem with the TV itself) and the door could not be locked inside. The room service staff came in a timely manner, and the screen projection problem was solved. The problem with the room lock was fixed for about half an hour, but it has not been fixed. After half an hour, the staff said that it could not be fixed, and even the door can be opened directly from the outside. They asked us to change the room at around ten o'clock in the evening, but we took the initiative to upgrade the room As compensation, I waited for a long time for the air conditioner to heat up after changing rooms, and the TV stereo was very loud when I first turned it on.
All the above things really made the check-in mood very bad. That night, I didn't want to try my best to ruin the travel mood, but the hotel didn't have any other explanation or compensation. Really bad check-in experience.

Unhappy, because I was very hungry when I arrived, and I ordered something to eat, but the table kept shaking, and I was speechless. Later in the evening, I came back and responded to the hotel. The young lady who came to deal with it was very hot and serious. Mia, who helped me with my luggage the next day, was also super considerate. She cared about my experience of staying.

msg:Service: The check-in staff, the on-site concierge, and the breakfast service are all very good. In addition, the little brother sent colored pencils and coloring books to the children after check-in, which made me feel good about the hotel. The only complaint is the pool. On the day of check-in, I took my 4-year-old child to play in the warm water area of Children's Pool. I stood at the farthest corner and took pictures of the child's swimming to record it. It was far away from the adult's swimming pool, and no one was there at that time. The staff actually blocked me from taking pictures at this time, saying that others would have opinions, and they refused to forgive me after I expressed that I only took pictures for children. My friend, there were not many people at that time. It was the National Day, and it was an Internet celebrity hotel. The swimming pool was a public place, and parents were not allowed to take pictures of their children. If it is the internet celebrity who disturbs others by scratching their heads and making poses and taking pictures, I can understand you to dissuade others. All the internet celebrity hotels in Sanya do not have such unreasonable demands, which ruins the mood of enjoying parent-child time. Having stayed in so many 2000+ hotels, this time was the most depressing one.
Facilities: Other services would have allowed me to ignore the lack of hotel facilities. But after the pool incident, I had to complain. There are two sinks in the bathroom, one is blocked by the door, which is inconvenient to use. The shower head in the shower is too low to wash my hair. The bathroom light button is hard to find and slow to respond. The lighting in the whole room is too dark. The bed is too hard, I don't know what kind of stone it is, although it looks good, but my son hit his head no less than three times, crying every time, and the last time he knocked his head out of the bag. The window of the room is too close to the opposite building, and the structure of the opposite building can be seen clearly.
Summary: Couples and business trips are acceptable, not suitable for parents and children. Although it was very thoughtful to send colored pencils, it means that I want to do parent-child orientation, but in other respects, the tolerance for parent-children is too low. There is no small stool for children in the swimming pool, including the bathroom, to help children wash their hands. One experience is enough, I will not bring my son here again. Below 2900, you can stay in a hotel with a better parent-child experience.

üöòThe TaiKoo Hui underground parking lot has a special area for the Middle House Hotel, but it is also chargeable. After registration at the front desk, it is 100 per night, and the shopping mall bill is 128 per night, which is equivalent to a 78% off
üèô This time I set a twin room on the 7th floor. Listen to the front desk. The highest floor of the twin room is the 9th floor. Because of the relationship between the floors, the view generally has a very comfortable mattress. The sound actually uses the famous LA BOITR sound effect to kill most hotel standards The JBL bathroom is relatively spacious compared to the entire room. The retro water pressure is very large. Before reading the comments, other guests mentioned that the hot water is not hot. I did not encounter the problem of the electric curtain which is still great for me. For the roller blinds, the white yarn is still very intimate. After all, the office opposite will be slightly embarrassing.
‚ô•Ô∏èThe service is very good
ü•ôSupper and breakfast are called Room Service. Shrimp fried rice is no good. The braised beef noodles are not bad. For those who don‚Äôt eat spicy food, the breakfast is okay but the taste is no good.
üéäThe restaurant & bar are on the 3rd floor. It's quite lively at night. There are many beauties. The pool and gym are at B1 because the kids still have a cough, so I didn't go there this time.

msg:During the ***** New Year, I took my baby to Shanghai for a stroll and stayed in The Middle House. I have to say that the green tiles are the essence. There are not many rooms. The underground supporting swimming pool is at the end of the fitness center.

Unexpectedly, The Middle House Hotel is cold but the service is excellent. Jason, the service staff who connected with our hotel, directly helped us with our luggage and took it to the room. Then he also gave us welcome fruits and a notebook for children. The children were very happy and stayed in the next few days. edition, the Middle House definitely wins

Including bubble bath and champagne, will help arrange in advance, very considerate. The gym downstairs is open 24 hours a day. You can enter by swiping your card.

The concierge at the door, especially the handsome guy at the front desk, treats us patiently and meticulously. The quality of the professional hotel staff is very impressive. I am delighted, that is, I didn‚Äôt pay attention to my name. The handsome guy with glasses and the kid loves the chocolates at the front desk. Yesterday I was embarrassed when he saw us picking up chocolates. Haha, especially the takeaway order. The front desk will give us carefully. They were delivered to the door of the room. During the epidemic, they were very attentive and considerate. The only problem is that the wooden door card has been used for a long time and is easy to be damaged. Pay attention to the hand. It is a great experience.

The design of various switches in the room is unreasonable, the switch key is still loose, the sensitivity is very low, and those who don't know think it is broken. The bluetooth speaker in the room is a furnishing, except for charging the mobile phone, everything else is broken. In addition, I don't know why there is no ventilation system in the bathroom, I feel very puzzled. The traffic area, breakfast, etc. are all pretty good.

msg:Those who came to the hotel for Chinese Valentine‚Äôs Day, said at first that they would give me a room on a high floor, but when I heard that my room included a lunch, they finally gave me a room on the lowest floor. The restaurant is downstairs. Fortunately, it was raining and no one was sitting on the terrace, otherwise it would be very noisy, right? I found that the sound of rain outside was quite loud, the room was small, the bathroom was not big, and I didn't upgrade the room. It was very close to the elevator entrance, and I was very disappointed with this hotel at the time.

However, I have to say that the small refrigerator made up for my broken heart. It was the first time to gargle with a bottle of water worth dozens of dollars, and in the end there were still a few bottles of Evian before drinking it. What a luxury! The hotel‚Äôs toiletry bag and eco-friendly bag are awesome! And the service is also good. We ordered a few takeaways and they were all delivered to the room. After staying in so many five-star hotels, this is the first time we encountered this kind of service.

The group purchase package is quite cost-effective, and the lunch delivered is also delicious, but the room is very tasteless.

Let me talk about a few questions first: First, there is a smell outside the hotel, it is estimated that it is the sewer or septic tank or something, and the second is that the bedside table in the room is slightly smaller. The facilities are good. Although the swimming pool is on the first floor, it feels pretty good. The front desk and concierge services are very good: warm, humble, and gentle, you can give a five-point praise for this. The eldest sister in the guest room is also very good. When she came back, she just came out of the turndown. She saw a child asking if she wanted to put two more bottles of water. In general, I don‚Äôt know if the odor was encountered by me during those few days or something else. I still can‚Äôt find a big problem in other aspects.

Winning in the service and location, the little brother at the front desk introduced the room and facilities on the night of check-in. Although the Do Not Disturb light accidentally turned on an oolong that was not cleaned in time, the hotel resolved it in time. The staff will also help take takeaways, and there is a need for all kinds of requests. Thank you very much. The fly in the oin**ent is that the sound insulation effect is relatively poor. The sound of rain outside hits the metal building + the next door is opened and closed many times in the middle of the night. For those who get up early for business trips and exams, the quality of sleep cannot be guaranteed. In addition, staying for 4 nights in 60 flat rooms without room upgrades to experience other room types is also a bit regrettable.

I chose this hotel during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. I can only say that the money spent by The Middle House was spent on mkt. The overall experience is not ideal. I personally think that the hotel's facilities and decoration, especially the service, are not proportional to the price.
I especially complain about the main services of the TMH series: 1. The waiting time for check-in is long, and the reason for the waiting is that the guests in front of the queue quarreled with the front desk.
2. When you check in, the front desk will take you to the room and introduce the facilities, and the takeaway you ordered will also be delivered to you, which every five-star hotel can do. Because the Dragon Boat Festival is also equipped with special Dragon Boat Festival welcome desserts and greeting cards.
3. Focus on the hotel's delivery service. I booked breakfast for the next day the night before, but the dishes were delivered incorrectly and only one waiter came for the meal for two people. The guests need to clean up the place to put the plate by themselves. The waiter left after delivering the meal and urged you to sign the bill. There was no subsequent plating service, which was disappointing.
4. You can park in the parking lot of Taikoo Hui. I confirmed with the front desk twice before check-in that the cap is 100 per night. When I checked out, I was charged 124. They said it was a system problem.
Everything is so speechless. Is this a popular hotel?

However, if I light the Do Not Disturb light, I will knock on the door and call to confirm whether I do not disturb or do not need to clean. Do not disturb means that you want to rest quietly... Is there an essential difference between calling and pressing the doorbell?
Others are pretty good. The takeaway express includes lobby guidelines and swimming and fitness services are very considerate.

The windows and the four-seater seats in the room are already booked and not allowed to sit. Reluctant to sit outside, there was a girl who was about to leave work whispering softly, with a good attitude. Slightly relieved the discomfort of not being allowed to sit. Until nearly eight o'clock after drinking the champagne, the indoor occupancy rate was about half, and there were a few window seats that were still unoccupied. I really don't know why not let me sit down? Just because there is no reservation? After drinking the champagne, the friends felt that the nuts delivered were delicious. They asked if they could be taken to the room and answered directly: No...no need. How small is a hotel to pack some nuts? I just don't want to trouble myself to make the guests happy. For breakfast, there was an astringent taste from the avocado that was in the sky. The laksa was very warm when it was served, and the soup was not rich enough, or I was not lucky enough to encounter it today? The lemongrass wonton tastes good from the favorite Vietnamese restaurants abroad. To eat this for more than 500 yuan, Shanghai can still find many more delicious Brunch. There is a guy named Jason in the front hall who is nice, and he can handle all requests quickly. The pool gym is also good. But in general, in the future, guests may still choose the peninsula that is at least error-free. This is suitable for people who don't care about service. I complained about my experience with my friend, he pushed me on WeChat of guest of experience and let me complain directly, think about it, forget it, maybe it‚Äôs not connecting with this hotel
