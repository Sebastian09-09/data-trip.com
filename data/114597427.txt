msg:The staff were friendly and very helpful throughout our stay. Very satisfied with our room on the 3rd floor - which has an open area to enjoy the night sky and view of the city. Breakfast was simple but tasty. 
Main downside was difficulty in finding the hotel entrance. The close proximity to Dali ancient town is very convenient. For some strange reason, aircon vent is directly above the bathtub - which meant baths were mainly in the shower. Recommend Mengjing Yayuan Hotel if great service, well-appointed rooms, and proximity to Dali ancient town are key considerations.

The location is just outside the south gate of Dali Ancient City. We had a very delicious mushroom hotpot nearby. The next day we had to rush to leave Dali for Lijiang. The hotel staff helped us with our luggage and made sure we made it on time for our train. Highly recommended for the service and also the comfort of the room. All amenities are of good quality and breakfast was good overlooking mountains around dali ancient city. Will stay here again!

msg:The hotel is located next to the ancient city of Dali. It is very convenient to travel. The room is hygienic and clean, and the items used are of good quality. It also comes with disposable face towels. The bed and quilt are especially comfortable. Their breakfast time is from 8 to 11 o'clock. They will send a message in advance to remind us of the meal. We woke up relatively late and passed the breakfast time. After consent, breakfast was delivered directly to the room. There are a lot of meats raised next to the parking lot, which are very beautiful. There are also Dian black tea and Pu'er tea at the front desk, which taste good and the staff's service attitude is also very good. It was a satisfactory stay and I will choose to stay here again if I go to Dali in the future.

msg:Unexpectedly, Mengjing also opened a branch in Dali, which is a five-star boutique hotel. Having stayed at their home in Kunming before, I felt that the detailed service was very good.

This time I went back to Dali and happened to see that they had just opened. The opening price of the new store was very favorable, so my friend and I immediately booked two stores.

Secondly, the location is very good. It is right next to the south gate of the ancient city. It is very close to the south gate after walking for one or two hundred meters. Navigate and go directly to the hotel entrance. When you walk in, there is an independent free parking lot. This independent parking lot is in the ancient city. The interior is so scarce ~ very suitable for self-driving travel.

There is a swimming pool next to it, and it is also heated, which is great, but it‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt bring a swimsuit~

The room feels very relaxing, with wooden Chinese style, spacious and comfortable, and also has a small balcony with a courtyard view. The facilities and equipment are very complete~ I just arrived very late, and it was very comfortable to take a bath, and there were also rose petals and bubble balls~

The breakfast is local rice noodles and is quite rich. Next to the restaurant is a gym with treadmills and massage chairs (free)~ It‚Äôs not too nice to relax and have a massage after working out or playing.

After breakfast, you can go to the rooftop to bask in the sun and feel the slow life in Dali. You don‚Äôt have to go out, you can actually stay in the hotel~

If there were a few problems on the day of check-in, they were solved perfectly. It is also equipped with a washing machine and dryer, so there will be no more dirty clothes. The room is hygienic and clean, and there is a fence for children. Don't worry about children falling off. Ginger tea is prepared at the front desk every day. The weather in Dali has a big temperature difference, so we drink some every day. Breakfast is a set meal, which needs to be selected in advance. Everything else can also be done. Additional. The hotel environment is also good. The terrace on the third floor is very beautiful, and the courtyard on the first floor is fogged, which makes it feel full of fairyland. A satisfactory stay experience, I will choose to stay here next time I come to Dali Ancient City!

When I was washing up at 12 o'clock in the evening, there was no hot water in the wash basin faucet. Even after waiting for a long time, there was no hot water. Shouldn't there be 24-hour hot water?
It is understandable that breakfast is a set meal, but for a room rate of more than 600 per night, breakfast is too simple.

1. When I checked in and provided the order number, I was told that the reservation could not be seen in the system. I waited for more than 20 minutes to get the room.
2. The room was freezing. The air conditioner could only blow cold air. I looked for the waiter for more than an hour and no one could solve it. The final conclusion was that as long as there is a room on this floor with cool air, other rooms cannot use hot air.
3. The breakfast restaurant was freezing, so I asked the waiter to turn on the air conditioner. He directly replied that there was no air conditioner. Finally, I found the air conditioner and turned it on myself.
4. The service staff in the room did not provide refills of the shampoo, shower gel, and body lotion, and they could not be squeezed out.
5. The bathtub was used up on the first day, but the room was not cleaned the next day.

This is really the worst hotel experience. I'm sorry for the price. The price/performance ratio is extremely low.
