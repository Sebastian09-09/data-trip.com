msg:The hotel is modern and very nicely decorated and my room was stocked with amenities, including a nice tea set with good tea which you can enjoy on the alcove in your room. All of the staff were friendly and helpful.  My room price included pickup from the train station and that was arranged without any fuss through Weixing since  I don't have a Chinese phone number.  My room and the public areas were all very clean.  The breakfast was wonderful.  It is a 700 m walk to the Old Town, and a bit far from the main part of town around ChangZhen Lu.  But it is easy and  inexpensive enough to call a didi or a cab to get to that part of town.

The hotel is small, but the facilities are complete, equipped with smart lighting control, smart toilets, clean and tidy rooms, comfortable space, and the hotel has its own parking lot. The front desk and room service are warm, thoughtful and meticulous. We have some altitude sickness, so the hotel specially sent you a mobile oxygen concentrator. The hotel breakfast is also very rich, and the restaurant window has a beautiful view. You can see Guishan Park and the big prayer wheel, and the meal is very enjoyable. After checking out, the hotel also sent us to the high-speed rail station for free. It was a really great üëç accommodation experience.

But it is obvious that although the hotel is newly opened or newly renovated, the hardware is at most an ordinary 4-star hotel. However, the hotel reception staff and the driver at the pick-up station are very enthusiastic. The service has the intimacy of a homestay but can also feel different from a professional hotel. Overall, it is worth recommending.

Isn't this kind of operation just taking kickbacks and forcing buying and selling? Secondly, there was the sound of running water from the pipes at night, and when I reported it to the front desk, there was no response.
Environment: I booked a mountain view room just because I wanted a good view, so I didn't check in early. As a result, I checked in at night with this view. Is this also called a mountain view room?

Facilities: No water comes out of the toilet
The service attitude of this hotel was pretty good at first, but things turned out really unsatisfactory later on...

There is also a humidifier in the room. The weather in Shangri-La is very dry. The humidifier is really important. We stayed for two nights and needed it the next day. The cleaning aunt also helped to clean it very well and replaced it with new sheets, quilts and toiletries. The whole service in the hotel is very considerate and it is not far from the ancient city of Dukezong and can be reached on foot. Highly recommended!

When I entered the room, there was no decoration smell at all, which made me feel at ease. There is a humidifier in the room. It is relatively dry in Shangri-La. Turning on the humidifier at night will make you feel comfortable and not dry in the morning. Of course, the best thing is that they have rooms with oxygen supply. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk saw me holding an oxygen bottle and took the initiative to upgrade me to a room with oxygen supply. I slept super well at night. Okay, thank you to the beautiful lady at the front desk. In addition, the overall decoration style of the hotel is what I like, very modern. Overall, it's nice to see and live in. I'll stay here next time.

I witnessed a call coming in around 2 o'clock, and the lights and TV in the whole house suddenly turned on, and then turned off. Then at 5 o'clock, the lights and TV in the house were all turned on, and I turned them off manually. Then again around 5:20, the whole house was turned on. The lights and TV are all on too! I can only turn it off myself immediately! There was a power outage and the TV and lights in the house automatically turned on three times! I didn't get a good rest at all.
