msg:We had a very nice stay in a family room. This hotel is really beautiful. Excellent views from the rooms. The location is very convenient close to one of the park entrances. You can just walk a few minutes and you are at the gate. The staff was nice and and helpful. Food was very good once we learned what to order and what not to order. The menu is in Chinese and English, but no pictures. Breakfast was good as long as you stay with the Chinese options. The staff helped buying tickets for the park and let us do a very late check out on the last day, which we were very grateful for. We had a very pleasant stay and really enjoyed the beautiful and calm surroundings.

msg:My family had a great time staying in this beautiful guesthouse - the rooms had floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the beautiful mountains of Zhangjiajie, and waking up to this scenery is in the mornings was a treat. The location is great as well- just a mere 3 minutes walk to the Zi Mu Gang entrance of the Zhangjiajie National Park. 

As the place is a bit further out from the Wulingyuan city, there were not many restaurants nearby for our dinner so we ended up dining within the premises for two nights, which I have to say was very delicious and hearty! 

Most importantly, the staff were really helpful and will always go out of the way to help us with any requests. A special shoutout to 小覃, who was in charge of our stay- thank you for helping us with the planning of our itinerary in the National Park, arranging transportation etc.

msg:Such an amazing stay! We stayed in 2 different rooms (the most affordable for the first night and the Holiday Family Panorama Suite for the rest of our stay) and both rooms have a modern aesthetic and clean. Our second room was stunning and really worth the price. It’s really close to the infamous mountains and the staff give you a map and helpfully explain how to go about the trek. For our fellow foreigners, the meal options are limited and mainly Chinese but the options they had were enjoyable.  I have to give a special thanks to Kit, who picked me up from the airport and drove us to the grocery store to pick up some snacks we might need (since the town is a bit far from the homestay). It was my boyfriend’s birthday so I had asked the staff to help me with a set up which they gladly committed to. They blew up all the balloons and hung them up and I loved it! Kit also went out of his way to get a birthday cake which we shared with the guests at the restaurant. Everyone was super friendly too. So 10/10 would t recommend.

Amazing common area to chill. Last but not the least breakfast was very good as well. As a cherry on the top a cute monkey comes everyday to the lawn.. which everyone gets to feed.

Tatami star gazing room was good, but it was hard to look out as the heating system caused a lot of humidity form on the glass making it difficult to see outside. This could be good during summer.

msg:From the moment we arrived, I was immediately captivated by the hotel's prime location. It’s located within 3 min walking distance to the Zimugang entrance of Zhangjiajie park. This place is a haven for those who appreciate natural beauty, as it provides breathtaking views of the mountains, lush forests, and enchanting streams that Zhangjiajie is renowned for. 

But what truly sets this place apart is its exceptional staff. They are not just employees running a hotel; they are true ambassadors of the local culture, offering a warm and genuine welcome to every guest. The staff (special thanks to lovely Akun and Ajie) went above and beyond to ensure our comfort throughout the stay, providing personalized service that was second to none. From the seamless check-in process to the adept recommendations for local sightseeing and dining options, the service was flawless. 

Rooms are comfortable and thoughtfully designed, reflecting the natural beauty of Zhangjiajie. Although we experienced some problems with our shower, it was quickly fixed by the hotel’s staff. 

I must also commend the culinary experience at the hotel’s restaurant - a gastronomic delight that truly enhances the overall stay. The food here is nothing short of spectacular, a tasteful fusion of local Zhangjiajie cuisine and international flavours. The breakfast selection is small, compared to those in the big hotels, but it is expected. Although the menu selection isn’t big, each dish is thoughtfully crafted, showcasing the best of seasonal and locally sourced ingredients.

For anyone planning a trip to Zhangjiajie, I cannot recommend the ANNICA Hotel highly enough. It’s not just a place to stay - it's a place to experience the spirit of Zhangjiajie.

msg:This is our first trip to China so when we flew in to Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport late in the evening, we were very grateful to be picked up by the owner Leo, and driven for 30 minutes to Annica. The hotel is new and 5Star! What an amazing resort to return to each day after walking through the  Zhangjiajie Forest National Park - to rest and sleep in the most luxurious rooms overlooking the swimming pool and the famous Avatar  mountains, eat the most delicious meals of duck, fish, chicken and drink exquisite berry tea (green tea) as well as really good imported and local beers. The park entrance is literally 100 metres away where you can buy tickets. We bought the park & eco-bus package which gave us access for the three days we were there. Leo spent each morning showing us on a map where to go and what to see - his knowledge is impressive and really helped us make the most of our time in the park. The park entrance near Annica gives you greater options than any other entrance. We came to see the famous mountains that inspired “Avatar” the movie. We will definitely be returning to ANNICA!

We were looking for a hotel or inn that could house us all in 1 spacious family suite, conveniently located near the national park, and is more private and quiet for families like us (not the package tour group type of commercial hotel).  We are lucky Ctrip recommended this Annica Inn to us as a first choice.  It was almost a perfect fit.  It's a brand new 'premium' inn, situated 5 minutes walk from Zimugang Gate of the Zhangjiajie National Park.  Our 2 bedroom family suite with balcony was very spacious, very well equipped, and even had floor heating to keep us comfortable in the cold winter night.  The staff were friendly and helpful, especially Ah Jie the Inn keeper.  Ah Jie was super attentive and took very good care of us, helping us purchase tickets in advance, plan our daily routes in the parks, and even driving us to a couple scenic spots.  Overall, we are very pleased with our stay at Annica, and would recommend this place to anybody looking to spend a comfortable and relaxing few days in Zhangjiaje.

The owner - Chen Liu - was among the kindest hoteliers I’ve experienced over the past 6 years in China. He and his staff pay great attention to guests’ experience and are eager to help with every aspect of the stay. Ahead of our arrival they helped to arrange tickets to the Park and offered complimentary pick-up from the train station. 

The very spacious room (we were upgraded free of charge) had an amazing view both from the bedroom and living room areas. 

The hotel has a very good selection of drinks, great chef and tasty coffee. Overall a perfect setup for a holiday in Zhangjiajie. 

What I would also highlight is the proximity to the park entrance. Within a 3 minute walk you are at the park entrance. Very convenient!

msg:Review of Annica. Five stars. 
This lovely hotel  opened 2 months ago. So teething issues tolerated. 
The great:
The hotel team, Ya Lung and Mr Chen the managers, the staff in particular An An , Mr Chou, Mr Chen on reception and Mrs Du who was our waitress. 
Nothing was too much trouble from making sure we were comfortable and well fed, to mapping out routes on the mountains, to buying entrance and cable car tickets for us and arranging transport. Super friendly and helpful.
Location. The reason for anyone going to Zhangjiajie is to visit these beautiful mountains and the location is 1st class. We were a 3 minute walk to the Zi Mu Gang Park entrance.
The room we had was number 4 with from bed view of the village and mountains beyond at front of hotel which was great to wake up to, and rear facing over the pool and the mountains, a view from the seating area.
The room was super comfortable, an excellent bed, big walk in shower with a separate bath. 
We ate dinners in the hotel after each day’s hiking, the food was excellent. Good selection of foreign beers too. 
We didn’t have the use of the pool, it was being drained on the day we left so I’m sure it will be rectified. 
Hotel management need to fix:
Seepage of water under shower door when shower used. 
Shaving mirror/vanity mirror doesn’t work. 
Ground floor rooms (we started in room 9), suffer with bugs (all sorts from earwigs, cockroaches, centipedes and mosquitos). Not pleasant.
Suggestion: in house massage, for the tired bodies. 😀
We would go back, highly recommended.

msg:I wanted to stay in a homestay when I came to Zhangjiajie for tourism. After some hesitation, I finally chose the newer Xudu Resort Hotel.

Let me talk about the location first: the location is indeed far away, in the mountains, and it takes a long time to go out and take a taxi, but it is very close to the middle gate of the Forest Park, which is very convenient for entering the Forest Park many times.

Environment: The environment of his home is nothing to say, there is a beautiful infinity pool as a sign, and it looks very beautiful when you take a photo.

Service: The housekeeper Xiao Tang is very responsible. From picking up at the airport to communicating how to play, the route of play, and precautions, he is very considerate to inform, which is really considerate 👍🏻👍🏻

Facilities: Let's focus on the facilities, which is also the place where this stay brought a bad experience. 1. The refrigerator is too loud. The room is spacious, but I can hear it clearly at night, which disturbs my sleep. 2. The drainage in the bathroom is too poor. Every time I take a shower, my slippers are floating on the water. You can imagine how slow the drainage is. 3. There are too few plugs in the house, and there is no USB plug. It is too low for a house that costs more than 1,000 yuan to have no USB charging port. 4. The quilt is too damp because the bathtub, double wash basins, etc. are all near the bed, which will definitely be damp. I hope the store can focus on improving the above problems, otherwise it will be a bit unfair to the price and environment...

You have to take a taxi back and forth, which costs 40 to 50 yuan per trip, which is not cost-effective! The rural scenery is nice, and the food is ok, but too expensive. The breakfast variety is too small, and the room price is ridiculously expensive. In short, the experience of staying in the hotel does not match the room price, and it is still far from the price! Finally, thank you to the housekeeper who sent us to the airport when we left. Thank you for your hard work!

The service experience from the early booking to the final airport drop-off was really good. The facilities in the homestay are also very complete, and the staff are also very enthusiastic. If other friends come to visit, I will also recommend your homestay. Finally, I would like to give a thumbs up to the contact staff Xiao Tan, whose service was also very thoughtful.

But there are also some flaws. The network is not very good on rainy days, maybe because it is in the mountains. Also, the electric curtains didn't work very well, so I tried to take a video but didn't.

The hotel is very close to Zimugang Gate. There are few people at this gate and there is no queue. You don’t need to get up early to enter the scenic area. It’s great!
The silver tabby cats raised by the boss are super cute, and there are also monkeys. Standing on the balcony and watching the monkeys 🐒 eat is really super healing (^～^)

The surrounding scenery is also good, and it's only two minutes away from Jiamu Port Gate, which is not too convenient. Xiao Li's service attitude was also very good and he was always available.

Vacationing was the most satisfying part of my trip. Most scenic spots were crowded during the Spring Festival, but here I found the tranquility I like, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The hotel housekeeper Xiaoying was very nice and helped us upgrade for free. Chengxing has a vacant room, and the recommended tour routes are also very good. The hotel facilities are very new, the rooms are very clean, the hotel environment is very comfortable, the food is delicious, and the boss is very handsome and sings well.

I went on a quick trip during the Chinese New Year. I chose an inn next to the scenic spot. I turned left and arrived at the entrance of [Zimugang] in 3 minutes. It is very convenient to enter and exit the scenic spot.
The inn seems to have been opened in 2023. The equipment is very new and clean. The floor heating equipment and other equipment are very good. It is not cold at all. The inn has an automatic toilet and bathtub. After visiting the scenic spot, it is great to take a short bath~
On New Year's Eve, the inn also hosted a sumptuous New Year's Eve dinner very warmly. Thumbs up!
The staff are also very considerate and can help plan your itinerary!
ps:
Two days before departure, it happened to snow very heavily in Zhangjiajie. The entire scenic spot was covered with snow and silver, which was very beautiful.
There are relatively few tourists in Zhangjiajie around the Chinese New Year. There is no need to queue for entry and exit of all scenic spots, scenic battery cars, and cable cars. The travel experience is very nice.

You can hold tea-making activities around the stove outdoors, and the facilities are all prepared. Very complete, but the sky is not beautiful. raining

Environment: There is a large lawn behind the hotel, which is very comfortable to stay in. When we left, we could imagine what the scenery would be like when the lawn is covered with snow.

Breakfast: We got up relatively late and it was already 11 or 12 o'clock. When we went downstairs to inquire, they still prepared a lot of things for us, including rice noodles, corn, spring rolls, DIY yogurt, toast... There were probably more than a dozen types prepared. I recommend rice noodles with minced meat and noodles with beef. This is my favorite combination.

Hygiene: We got up relatively early, and around six o'clock there was already a lady mopping the floor and wiping the tables in the lobby. I really didn't expect this. It's past six o'clock here but it's not even bright yet! ! !
Environment: You can directly see the aerial countryside of the Forest Park from the hotel. The surrounding forests are also very well protected, and monkeys usually come.
Service: The hotel implements a butler-style service. If you have any questions, contact the butler at any time, and they can solve the problem quickly.
Breakfast: The hotel's breakfast is self-service. There are so many varieties that you will be full if you try any of them. The breakfast, especially the Hunan specialty rice noodles and DIY yogurt, is particularly delicious and there are many ingredients for the yogurt.

A reminder to bring water and clothes; the cat in the hotel is very cute, although it always ignores people🤪. It is very close to the Zimugang ticket station, which is convenient for travel. Of course, there are fewer shopping and dining options than living in the town. , so it would be better if the hotel's breakfast could be more selective and diversified; overall it is very good, the service is better than many five-star hotels, and I will recommend it to my friends!

msg:Let me talk about the conclusion first. ANNICA is a hotel whose accommodation quality far exceeds the price level. The operator has put in great efforts to create a paradise in the remote mountains.
The relationship with ANNICA originated from a quick trip. In order to relax, I went to Changsha to have a cup of tea and look beautiful. Who knew that I didn’t want to go back after leaving the house? I successively visited Changsha, Fenghuang, Zhangjiajie and Changde, and fell in love with her. Come to Hunan.
Before going to Zhangjiajie, I repeatedly struggled with choosing a hotel. Because I like peace and quiet, I wanted to live in the suburbs. However, hotels in the suburbs often have problems with inadequate supporting facilities and service levels. In the end, I chose ANNICA and booked two nights directly. Terrace room package.
Before arriving, I began to feel the enthusiasm of the host. I contacted the hotel in advance to arrange a pick-up. I was amazed by the scenery along the way up the mountain. When I got off the bus and entered the lobby, I saw the infinity pool & the iconic ANNICA logo against the green mountains. Be healed.
From the first ANNICA employee you contact, you can feel that they are different from other hotel/B&B employees. They are full of energy and enthusiasm. They can carefully prepare everything the customer needs before they need it without too many formulaic processes.
On the first night of my stay, I met the owner of the B&B, an interesting soul owner who is strict with himself and lenient towards others, and has both grace and good looks.
We talked about business philosophy, education experience, food, culture and travel, aesthetics, and a lot more. After we finished talking, I learned that ANNICA means incomplete or imperfect in Greek. The boss advised me to accept that I am Imperfect, you are ordinary, it is good to enjoy this imperfection.
But judging from the stay experience, I don’t think he can accept his imperfections at all. . . He was very involved in satisfying customers and employees. During his stay, he even experienced the boss knocking out the floor-to-ceiling glass in the corridor and replacing it with a switchable floor-to-ceiling window for ventilation. . .
In addition, the hotel chef's skills are extremely good, at least not inferior to the executive chef of Changsha W Hotel who just had a meal a few days ago. He even went back for a meal after checking out and going to Zhangjiajie National Forest Park. The signature fish cooked by the chef is far better than the famous restaurants in the city in terms of taste and heat.
To put it objectively, ANNICA is worthy of being called the number one B&B in Zhangjiajie. Its quality far exceeds that of ordinary B&Bs, adding a perfect experience to the journey that is not inferior to Ritz-Carlton or St. Regis.
To put it mildly, ANNICA is a place that can be regarded as the habitat of the soul, including the boss, chefs, employees, buildings, and scenery.
All in all, I will repurchase indefinitely.
Finally, here are some beautiful views from the hotel.
P.S. Jiujiu, the cat star in the store, is also a beauty owner. . .

1 The decoration smell is strong, and there is no fresh air for ventilation. It is very suffocating. As an asthmatic, I originally went to Zhangjiajie to take oxygen, but it turned out that I couldn’t sleep anymore❌
2. The air conditioning in the room cannot be controlled. I live on the 3rd floor (no elevator) and I can understand. You have to be at the front desk on the first floor to control the air conditioning😠 and it was said that the weather was fine that night and you don’t need to turn it on❌
3 star vacancies? Excuse me, if the glass is dirty, why are you looking at the stars? ❌
4. Service attitude, I did not realize the professionalism of the B&B housekeeper. The only two-word reply to everything is "no", without any emotion at all. There is no body lotion, no facial cleanser, and no so-called afternoon tea❌
5 The breakfast was terrible. There was nothing to eat in the mountains. With an average price of 1K-2K per capita, there is still a rich breakfast. The bread is hard and cannot be swallowed. ❌
6 There is a problem with the design. When you look into the room from the lawn and close the curtains, you can see clearly❌ My sister even accidentally saw the undressed guest next to her.

Not happy:
1: The experience of the room on the first floor is really bad, the sound insulation is very poor, I can't sleep at all in the morning, the corridor + check-out are very noisy
2: Privacy is very poor, the layout of the special room is weird
3: The sanitation and operation are very poor. I couldn’t take a closer look at the sanitation of the room. Both covers of the room were open, which took me a long time to check for fear of intruders in the middle of the night.

The B&B is not big, but the staff is warm and welcoming! I especially want to praise the housekeeper Ajie. Before the trip, I was worried that it would be inconvenient to live in the mountains and go to other scenic spots without a car. After arriving, the housekeeper helped to book a car at any time. The price was not expensive and was similar to Didi. The key is that the driver is skilled in driving and can handle mountain roads. Easy to control!
During the stay, the housekeeper Ajie will also help with tour route planning, ticket planning, ticket sales, and meal ordering. The most important thing is that the guy is handsome and the B&B owner is very good at selecting people.
In short, although I had no strategy for this trip before coming here, I had a lot of fun!

The room was large and comfortable, and the food tasted good.
The service in the hotel is also very good. The little brother also gave us detailed instructions on the route.
In short, it is an excellent choice for visiting Zhangjiajie.

The breakfast is delicious, the yogurt and jam are great! It’s been a long time since I’ve eaten such authentic yogurt and jam in a hotel buffet.
The swimming pool is also very good, it is mountain spring water, which is very different from the water quality of a normal swimming pool with alum added.
It's a hotel I've stayed in and want to go back to.

Compared with the overcrowded and long line of shuttle buses at the east gate sign gate, this place is simply a paradise for free play! Take the shuttle bus directly to Golden Whip Creek! The room has a simple style, smart bathroom curtains, and a cute small refrigerator filled with delicious food and drinks. It feels like a vacation right away!

       I checked in late and didn't finish my meal. On the way, the hotel staff added WeChat to order dinner dishes in advance. I ate them not long after arriving. It tasted very good. Especially recommend the three pots. The boss also sent a bottle of orange juice to the children.
      That night, the water was used for maintenance or something, and the water supply was affected to some extent.
      When we checked out on the third day, we had to get up early in the morning and the hotel breakfast didn't start until 7:30. The aunt in the kitchen helped cook two bowls of noodles, three noodles, and fried five eggs in advance, so that we could eat until we were full. Set off. Thank you very much 🙏.
      There are so many mosquitoes in the mountains that you can't open the doors and windows. Even if you don't open them, there will be bugs everywhere in the morning. Children are afraid of bugs, so they can only get up a little early to get rid of the bugs. There are a lot of them... I don't know if the doors and windows are not sealed well. It is hoped that the problem of door and window sealing can be improved.
      Also because there are a lot of mosquitoes in the mountains, there were a lot of bugs floating in the swimming pool. I regretted not being able to experience the swimming pool.

This is definitely the ceiling of a resort hotel, with first-class service, a top-notch environment, and an excellent location. From site selection, layout to design, you can see the owner's intentions and taste. Knowing that he is a fellow of the same age, he admires it from the bottom of his heart! The hotel is within a few minutes' walk from the Zimugang gate ticket gate. The housekeeper is very attentive and able to recommend itineraries according to his own arrangements. The communication is particularly harmonious, and the public areas are also very comfortable. The chef's skills are particularly good. The beautiful scenery and delicious food are perfect, especially the small The cat-Jiujiu is very cute. The children want to find her as soon as they come back from playing every day, and they are reluctant to leave. In addition, the hotel itself is a scene that can be checked in and specially produced. Of course, there are many highlights worth discovering...
Because of you, Zhangjiajie, who originally came here for a visit, wants to come here often, please continue to work hard!

The scenery is invincible, friendly to children, the interior design is very thoughtful, and the food quality is also high. It is closer to the entrance of the forest park than other homestays. For a hotel with a total of more than a dozen rooms, the lobby area is very luxurious, there is a swimming pool outside, and there are different types of outdoor seats and hammocks. Room type with balcony is recommended

Straight to the point👍The exterior view of the balcony is the swimming pool and lawn, which is very comfortable. This hotel is about 3 minutes away from Zhongmen (the entrance of Zimugang), so it is very convenient to enter and exit. The most important thing is that you have to take a shuttle bus between the scenic spots in the scenic area. After a day of playing, you go back to the hotel just against the flow of people (most tourists go to Dongmen or Nanmen). There is no one waiting to get on the bus, and there are too many people at the station going to the east gate or south gate after 5 pm. Most of them have to wait for more than 1 hour to get on the shuttle bus. The location is very good. Of course, this point of view is different for the beholder and the wise see the wisdom. I like the lively ones. The restaurants near the East Gate are concentrated, and the supporting facilities are more convenient.
The hotel includes breakfast, and you can also book dinner, but the taste of the hotel's dishes is average. Although the hotel service is not as professional as that of a star hotel, the waiters are very warm and sincere, and the service is kind and responsive. The hotel waiter will mark the tour route in detail, and also help to book performance tickets and tickets. "Eternal Love" is still worth watching. The location the hotel booked for me is in the middle of the first few rows, and the viewing location is excellent.

msg:I have stayed in so many B&Bs, those around Zhejiang, and those in Yunnan... This B&B has something to offer. It has its own small kitchen. As a competent foodie, I am so satisfied with the chef’s craftsmanship. I stewed it early on the day I arrived. Chicken, a big pot full, the meat is really strong! There are also pork ribs and winter melon soup, small stir-fried vegetables, oven fish, valley duck...all delicious
Rice noodles or noodles for breakfast are also highly recommended, as well as Zhangjiajie’s berry tea
The butler, Ajie, was careful and thoughtful throughout the whole process. He planned the route to the forest national park. He was hungry in the middle of the night and the kitchen was closed. He turned into a "chef Jie" and made fried rice with eggs.
The ladies and sisters in the hotel are also very enthusiastic, gentle and careful in handling things, serving tea, fruits, afternoon tea... The whole a**osphere is very comfortable, unlike some greasy uncle's homestays: Pan Chuaner, Mahjong one-stop 😐😐😐😐 . (Who in the family knows)
The location of the homestay is also very good. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers, where you can watch the sunset and the peaks. There is also a big swimming pool for you to swim in. After eating, I walked along the road and arrived at Longwei. The paths in the fields were also covered with wooden planks. Walking in the fields and breathing the fresh air, I was so happy!
The design of the room is minimalist and transparent, with large floor-to-ceiling glass to maximize the view of the beautiful scenery.
It is recommended to friends who like quietness, beautiful scenery, and sightseeing. I hope it can be a reference for everyone.

🏖️The environment is so beautiful, the infinity pool with the first-line mountain view is perfect! The star room we booked can still see the stars at night✨It’s a very special experience～

💁 It's worth staying in a hotel with nanny service at this price. An'an housekeeper helped me plan Zhangjiajie travel itinerary before I checked in, and also helped us book various tickets. As soon as we arrived at the hotel parking lot, the staff helped us with our luggage☔️We will carefully prepare umbrellas and raincoats for us on rainy days, and they will ask us if we have called a car before we go to the scenic spot.

🧑🍳The private dishes made by the chef are very delicious, and the beautiful scenery matches the food~

🤓Finally, I would like to commend the boss. He is very friendly and enthusiastic, and he took special care of us according to our arrangement. The team brought out by such a good little brother is really extraordinary.

I will come again next time I have a chance😎

🌸 Decoration style: As soon as you step into the lobby of this hotel, you will see the open infinity pool. The layout of the room is simple and warm, and every detail shows Japanese sophistication and elegance.
🏡 Small courtyard and tea drinking scenery: Here, you can sit down, drink a cup of berry tea, admire the beautiful scenery and enjoy a quiet time. There are also very open grasslands, and the scenery after snow is even more invincible!
👨🍳 The chef’s delicious food: The biggest feature of this B&B is its chef! The dishes made are very popular, and family members and children give very high praise. In particular, home-cooked side dishes such as stir-fried pork, stir-fried shredded potatoes, and fried tomatoes can all be made to a five-star level, leaving people with endless aftertaste. Highly recommended to food lovers!
💁♂️Thoughtful service: The staff at the B&B are attentive and the beautiful housekeeper Xiaoying at the front desk always greets us with a smile, making us feel as comfortable as at home.
In short, if you want to experience elegance and sophistication while enjoying delicious food and considerate service, then this hotel is definitely your best choice in Zhangjiajie!

The elegant and handsome boss, the enthusiastic and warm butler Akun, the simple and honest chef, the beautiful mountain scenery, and the handsome lucky cat jojo added a cool and pleasant feeling to our tired summer trip to Zhangjiajie Mood! The hotel is a 5-minute walk from Zimugang, the middle gate of the National Forest Park, which is very convenient to visit the Golden Whip Creek. Do not go to the roadside farm restaurants on the hills and down the hills in the scenic area. They are rip-offs and unpalatable. It is better to find a chef in the hotel and order a few Hunan dishes for comfort and deliciousness.

I want to ask the boss what kind of material is used for the wall bookcase in the middle of the living room. I want to use it for the next decoration. It feels more practical and simpler than walnut wood!
The baby with an extra bed in the starry sky room does not sleep in the room, but has to enjoy the personal space in the starry sky living room 😄 Comfortable mattresses cause fatigue, I doubt that we are out to travel and climb mountains? I sleep until I wake up naturally every day, and I stay in bed to watch Yunjuanyunshu. Basically, I start the mountain tour after lunch 😊 I can start the next stop in three days and two nights, but I stayed for four nights. Did the boss have a premeditated plan? what?
I especially recommend their native chicken hot, valley duck, and beef brisket. The salamander is also very good, and the children like it very much! The farm sausage is great, and there is a delicious vegetable that I can’t remember what it’s called, it’s a bit like wild leeks, fried farm eggs, delicious! Be sure to make a request to the boss: Farm eggs 🤭🤭 Especially the chicken soup is inseparable from the meal, the meal is bottomless, and no drop is wasted! The boss said that our meals are like Chinese New Year 😅 The main reason is that they are so delicious, I don’t want to miss it every time I order!
(As a result, the local chicken soup we ordered in Nanjing and Huangshan was rejected by the children, and a pot of chicken soup worth hundreds of oceans was used as a decoration🥶)
The boss is super nice, the kids want to barbecue, the boss finds fresh ingredients, give the boss a thumbs up 👍The housekeeper is attentive and provides good service, every day we have meals and trips in advance, and we have good suggestions for mountain tours. Here are some relatives in need Suggestion: Do not go to Shili Gallery, anyone who has been there will understand!
The baby who came back from climbing the mountain every day had to play in the swimming pool again. The water gun was not working well, and the boss immediately bought new ones to make up for it. It was so much fun that I didn’t want to leave when I was staying😅
I have a little regret later, I didn’t plan the time carefully before going to Huangshan, I didn’t adopt the advice of the proprietress Xudu, and I didn’t live in Huangshan. As a result, I didn’t have the comfort like living in Xudu, and I didn’t play more calmly!
In short, the biggest highlight of this trip to Zhangjiajie is: visiting the Grand Canyon and living in vain 👍👍 and the boss’s baby, Nini, is so cute!

First of all, one housekeeper, one housekeeper, feels at home, which is the best experience I have stayed in countless homestays in China. Second, the room is very large at 140 square meters, the details are carefully designed, and the aesthetics are online. Third, it is very clean. In the deep valley, it is amazing that there are no mosquito bites outdoors. Stayed for five nights in a row, from the tatami room to the stargazing room. I have to say that this stargazing room can indeed see the sky full of stars, with a large area, clean and transparent glass.

msg:It can be seen that the owner of the homestay is very careful. The style is glass, wood and stone. It is a good combination of simple modern style and original landscape. Although it is newly decorated, there is no residual taste of artificial materials. I really like the design of the star room. You can have a panoramic view of the mountains during the day, and you can see the stars and fireflies when you lie down at night.
The service of B&Bs has always been lacking in standards, so we can’t expect them to be based on star-rated hotels, but this is exactly the case. It can be seen that this B&B is based on customer satisfaction. As long as the requirements are feasible, they will try their best to meet them.
There are not many choices of meals, and I am not used to eating Chinese breakfast for a few days. Some ingredients for dinner need to be reserved, and there is only one chef. The day we went happened to be on vacation and there was no lunch.
Sadly the pool has not been cleaned and officially opened and is not suitable for use. The grass in front of the hotel is beautiful with the mountain view.
The hotel is located in a village on the top of the mountain. The roads specially built for tourists in the village are very suitable for walking and cycling. Not far from the exit of the hotel is the Zimugang Gate in the southeast of the forest park.
There are relatively few service personnel, and a few young people work hard and work hard. After a few years, they should accumulate a little more industry experience to be very professional.
I hope that the hardware maintenance of this homestay can be maintained in a few years and the personalized service can be maintained when it is full of guests.





Minibar Snacks, Snacks, Beverages, etc.:
Enough water and snacks, and drinking water will be offered before departure.

The hotel is on the mountain, although it's a bit far away, but I think the environment is worth it (it's not in vain for a car sick person like me to turn so many mountain roads), this hotel is very suitable for vacation!
Service: The service is very considerate. On the second day after I placed the order, my little brother asked me if I needed a pick-up service, and also provided us with travel guides (but I am still a road *****... 😂). The hotel also provides a forest park The map (passers-by always ask us where we got the map🤭), the customer service will reply almost in seconds when encountering problems, and the brothers and sisters in the customer service are very gentle!
Free airport pick-up or pick-up once: We are not traveling by car, this pick-up service is too necessary! It's not easy to take a taxi
Minibar Snacks, Snacks, Beverages, etc.: Snacks and Beverages Offered
Facilities: The hotel has a restaurant. You don’t want to go anywhere after a day of running wild. Fortunately, you can eat special dishes in the hotel restaurant. Going to Forest Park is really the rhythm of special forces. Fortunately, the hot American breakfast brought my soul back!

Very satisfied with this stay! Finally, I would like to talk about the bedding of the hotel. It is super comfortable. It is the most comfortable one I have slept in during the 10 days of this trip. Give the merchant a thumbs up👍In short, you will feel like a treasure after you go there, and you don’t need to report any local ones. For tour groups, free travel with the introduction of the store is comfortable and saves money!

msg:This hotel must be highly recommended!
First of all, the hardware of the inn is excellent: the geographical location is superior, the entrance of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park is less than ten minutes’ walk away; the surrounding environment of the inn is beautiful, the air is fresh, and it is close to the forest park. The plot is large, the design combines movement and static, the living comfort is very high, the facilities are very new and the materials are selected to be environmentally friendly, so you can stay at ease.
Secondly, the inn’s service is very meticulous and warm: before check-in, I took the trouble to answer our various questions about travel routes on WeChat, and gave a lot of pertinent suggestions and help; , the boss helped to send to the hospital for examination immediately and contacted to issue a diagnosis certificate to facilitate our air ticket rebooking. I really felt very at ease; the hotel also specially made light home-cooked dishes for the child with weak spleen and stomach, which really made us feel at home.
Once again, the hotel has a store manager who can be called a "living map of Zhangjiajie". Since he likes to travel and hike, he is very familiar with the travel routes in Zhangjiajie Forest Park. Follow his itinerary plan. On the most crowded May Day, we are in the forest The itinerary of the park is like getting a fast pass card, perfectly avoiding the peak of the crowd, and having fun with ease.
If I come to Zhangjiajie again, I will choose to stay in "White City"!

Hygiene: The sanitary conditions are also good, no sanitary dead spots were found, and the bedding is very clean.

Environment: The transportation is very close to the scenic spot gate, but the room we stayed in did not have much view.

Service: There is room for improvement in service. First of all, it takes more than two hours for the housekeeper to respond to every communication before check-in. After check-in, the housekeeper did not take the initiative to communicate. When I saw other housekeepers, they would answer many questions from guests. Ours only showed up once and we asked. The rest of the service staff are nice, but if one person (the housekeeper) is off the charts, it really puts a damper on the experience.

In addition, the afternoon tea stated in the order was not available at all. We checked in at noon, but there was not even a welcome drink, let alone afternoon tea. Never mentioned it from beginning to end. I hope the details of these services can really be improved. After all, for a room with more than 2,000 yuan per night for three people, this is not the kind of service we expect.

酒店提供的早餐和正餐飯菜從分量和口味上都屬於不錯的，在景區這個價格算可以接受。

優點是位置很好，幾分鐘就能步行到達梓木崗門入口；管家安安拿着酒店自己的手繪地圖，把景點攻略講解的很到位，還幫忙提前預訂了天門山A線，下午茶安排的也很好，景色很美，值得點贊！
缺點也很明顯，管理水平有待提高，整個酒店缺乏真正的待客熱情。另外，70多平的房間，空間雖然夠大，卻除了櫃子裏，連個晾衣服的地方都沒有設計，而且感覺太空了，可以擺件裝飾多一些。而且游泳池基本是個擺設，上面飄了很多蟲子，還標着：消防蓄水池禁止游泳。總之細節問題還是挺多。
這些是我真實的看法，總體來講還不錯。

msg:酒店的位置很好，就在梓木崗，森林公園的中門附近，出酒店走100米就到了，入園遊玩十分方便，園內環保車10分鐘左右到百龍電梯。
酒店的服務十分好，尤其是前台的小哥哥小姐姐們，性格特別好，員工十分熱情，主動幫拿行李，竭力滿足需要，主動介紹景點路線。
餐飲就更不用説了，本來準備出去吃，第一天到達太晚，就沒出去吃，隨便點了兩個“粵式神仙煲” 和幾個小菜，結果8斤雞肉煲我們1男2女2小朋友一掃而光，毫不誇張的説，這是我幾十年走遍大江南北，吃過的最好的煲，廚師的刀工也很精妙，留下了很多脆骨，一定要嘗。
可以説的點太多了，網紅打卡，用品高級，小貓可愛，總之這是一家很用心的店，我們還會再來的。

msg:彷彿找到了張家界的“安縵”！
特別超預期的一次住行體驗。😀

來張家界前，反對比了好幾天的酒店🤣，就在下定的前一刻，ANNICA突然跳到的眼前（後來入住問店長才知道是剛開業，正巧那天上線攜程）
酒店的現代立面和圖片一眼就吸引我點進去

果然，是一直喜歡的“安縵”風，現代、極簡外立面，原木風和很多留白的室內設計，大大的浴缸明亮的淋浴房，落地窗外直接就是張家界的山景....戳中心巴🤣  

再加上這是剛剛新開的酒店，對於熱衷酒店的我來説簡直沒有不定這裏的理由（老酒店的設施設備大家懂的）

到張家界前，店長就反覆確認到達時間，接到我們後一路暢聊到店，非常愉快。還在景區行程上給了我們特別實用和詳細的規劃建議。真的要特別感謝温暖周到的店長😎

入住期間能感受到每位員工的認真和善意，還偶遇了帥氣的老闆兩次，很真誠的關照我們入住體驗👍

朋友圈發了照片，很多朋友在問，都給他們推薦了這裏。希望再來張家界也能再有機會入住

酒店就在張家界景區梓木崗檢票門口100米，進去直接就上車，對於深度遊景區來説真是太太太方便了 

我還會再來的😆

在張家界玩兩三天，在這裡會得到一半的滿足與幸福感。因為民宿裏的每一個人都讓人感覺到很温暖。從管家，主理人，前台，後廚，甚至是清潔阿姨，都讓人感覺到特別温暖，每一個人都盡心盡責在自己的崗位上做好本職工作。特別感覺兩位管家，阿傑和阿寬，這裡是實行管家制服務，在你預訂了房間後會有相應的管家提前跟您聯繫，有什麼事找管家，有求必應。但是很驚喜的是，不是您的管家，他們也會同樣的對待每一位顧客，看着他們忙頭轉向卻依然耐心服務。確實被感動到了。還有兩位老闆，非常用心和耐心
關於距離：當從景區門口出來，看見門口一堆人排隊等車的時候就感慨，我們選對地方了，步行幾分鐘就可以回到民宿，真的好方便。
