msg:Located in a private garden, the environment is super value with a view at every step. The room is simple and elegant. The old-fashioned cabinet with a dressing mirror takes you back to childhood in a second. Living with family and friends, this door-to-door room is like a large suite. The breakfast room has a large dining table and has a warm feeling of a big family. The breakfast is also more personalized. The overall service is very comfortable, like visiting a garden friend's home. In the village road and cars, tricycles, etc., a turn is like entering a paradise. There are not many rooms, and it is relatively niche, so it is relatively quiet, suitable for a few days away from the world to cultivate oneself.
There is also a corridor connecting the dining and accommodation in the courtyard. The taste is also good, which is suitable for mid-day and evening banquets.

msg:My husband's birthday used to be celebrated with his family, but this year he wanted to spend a different birthday with his family. After much searching, he finally decided to stay at Bopin! The quietness of the garden, the happy koi, the slow stroll, and the light ink painting caught the eye. You don't need to travel far to enjoy the spring water here! The plants and strange stones in the garden are like poems and paintings, which make people immersed in it! The long-haired beauty Xiao Wang was particularly meticulous and thoughtful. She and her colleague Xiao Zhang specially prepared a birthday surprise for my husband and arranged it in the pavilion, which made us particularly surprised and moved! This will be our first choice hotel for vacation in the future! Thank you again for the hotel's thoughtful and warm hospitality!

It was very quiet for a walk in the morning. The weather was also suitable. It was a pity that the cherry blossoms fell overnight. It was very sad.

msg:I checked into this hotel with a Chinese courtyard just as the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. The hotel's service was very thoughtful. They called me in advance to inform me of the cherry blossom status before check-in, ensuring that guests who came to see the cherry blossoms could check in during the peak bloom period. When we arrived at the hotel, the staff warmly welcomed us and solved all our problems. The next morning, when there were no non-hotel guests in the courtyard, the hotel guests could enjoy the quiet cherry blossom garden alone and take all kinds of beautiful photos. The restaurant in the courtyard is not operated by the hotel, but the food is also very satisfactory. After taking pictures of the cherry blossoms, you can also have tea and rest in the hotel lobby. In short, this stay was a very good experience. I will come again.

msg:I chose this place for cherry blossom viewing. The room is very big. The owner likes to collect things. The whole hotel, including the yard, has various wood carvings and potted plants, as well as a lot of calligraphy and paintings. The whole yard is very suitable for vacation. The cherry blossom season is great, and there are various experience activities. Although the yard is open to the public, the privacy of the hotel is still good. The service is very good in all aspects. There is also afternoon tea in the concert hall in the afternoon, listening to the sound system and enjoying various works of art. There is an outsourced restaurant in the hotel, with a meal standard of 200 per person, four dishes and one soup, and you can choose the dishes yourself, which are relatively fresh.

msg:Owning a courtyard, returning to nature and self, brewing tea and reading, lying down and listening to the wind and rain, has become a pursuit. Chinese courtyard Mengxiyuan, a dream residence. The courtyard is the owner's inner monologue. The courtyard is the most profound, the most peaceful time, and the Chinese people's implicit, restrained, aesthetic and too many beautiful yearnings are integrated into it. With more and more high-rise buildings made of reinforced concrete in modern urban development, the Chinese courtyard has become the most beautiful Chinese business card. Chinese courtyards emphasize artistic conception, blending into nature, and integrating architectural beauty with natural beauty. There are many poems, books, and paintings in the courtyard, which makes the courtyard unique and reflects the cultural traditions and aesthetic concepts of the Chinese nation. The courtyard is full of flowers and trees, pavilions, towers, white walls and green tiles, several bamboo poles, strange stones, scattered rockery, winding corridors leading to secluded places, and the courtyard is deep and deep. The owner of the courtyard is a humorous, talkative and knowledgeable elder. During the conversation, we learned that the wall paint of the room is "Hanxiang Mud", which can purify the air and has a subtle fragrance, soothing the mind and nourishing the heart. In the lobby of the courtyard, there is also a Chinese audio giant "Hermit Audio", which has won the highest evaluation in international audio exhibitions many times. The old man specially provided us with the highest listening experience. Thank you very much! The room is large, and the layout of the room is in an antique Chinese style. The bathroom is large, with dry and wet separation, and there is a large bathtub for bathing, which is comfortable and cozy. The breakfast is rich Chinese nine-square grid, milk, egg, porridge, noodles, wontons, etc. The Chinese courtyard Mengxiyuan can really be said to be "I wish there was a courtyard full of human joy".

msg:It was raining when we checked in. The housekeeper was waiting in front of the house to welcome us. Before entering the hall, we were already shocked by the strange stones in the garden, and my family was amazed!
The hotel manager is the most knowledgeable and art-loving person I have ever met. This time, I was honored to have the manager explain some famous works to us.
The owner of the courtyard, Master Zhou, is a rare garden design genius in a century. This time, I met Professor Zhou meeting friends in the house. Mr. Zhou is humorous, cheerful and hospitable, majestic and elegant... It takes more than ten years to design such an isolated Feng Shui treasure land. It really deserves the title of unparalleled in the world. Its design layout is rare in gardens across the country-not only has image, shape, intention, but also has spiritual charm.
In addition to the beauty of the landscape, the Chinese Courtyard is also a gathering place for literati and artists in Hangzhou and even Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. It is a palace of culture and art.
It happened to snow heavily on the second day. Shanghai people have not seen heavy snow for many years. My daughter was very happy. Her wish for many years was fulfilled here. Before the snow melted, I enjoyed the snow scenery in the courtyard. Every step I took was a beautiful scene. I was shocked and impressed... The owner of Mengxi Garden is indeed a master of garden art, and the Chinese courtyard is the highest embodiment of the craftsman spirit.
Thank you for your warm hospitality and look forward to seeing you again!

Going out to play is not only about having fun and eating well,
You must also sleep well.
The hotel is relatively private and quiet
There are only 17 rooms in total, completely avoiding the National Day crowds.
Our family has very high living requirements, so we can't find anything wrong here. The details of the hotel are well done. Like, like, like
Whether it's the room or toiletries, especially the shower, it's very comfortable.
The Chinese breakfast is very rich, too much to eat. The presentation is also very particular, and the details are well done.
Besides, the yard is so beautiful. Manager Yang is very enthusiastic and considerate. After seeing that our children were dressed up, they also found a photographer for us. There was a special photo shoot in the yard. The koi carp that had been in the yard for more than ten years completely attracted the children.

msg:Only after returning to Beijing can I write a review quietly. The hotels in summer are really terrible. After experiencing the disastrous breakfast and escape at MGM Qingdao, I was very cautious about the hotels in Shanghai during the summer. I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in Shanghai for fear of being frightened. In Hangzhou, I have seen countless five-star hotels over and over again, but I chose this one. I went there regardless of the distance. I felt that it was really fate! The hotel environment is particularly beautiful, the service is like family, and the boss is like an elder. What I can't forget is the Chinese herbal fragrant mud, which is pollution-free and calm. It is really the inheritance of the wisdom of the ancients! The bathroom is even more amazing. The shower water flows down obediently like a magic, and the walls and floors are instantly dry without any odor. The bedding made my husband, who often suffers from insomnia, praise it again and again, and he stayed directly. The whole hotel really feels like home, and the toiletries as small as cotton swabs make people can't help but praise it. Having stayed in so many five-star hotels, the degree of care is really unmatched. Of course, care requires the blessing of knowledge! Mr. Zhou, understanding is better than a thousand words! Understand family, family and life! A wise man in life!

It is a hotel with stories and feelings. The housekeeper took us on a tour and explained it very carefully, which was great!

The interior of the room is a traditional wooden structure, and the light wood fragrance is very relaxing. The balcony is very large, and you can read books, chat and drink tea. The yard is very large, and there is a scene at every step. The root carvings, bonsai, and old objects are all worth appreciating carefully. I want to think about where and how they came from. The building bridge is also made of wood. The house built without steel and concrete feels very magical to children. The store is so enthusiastic, and sent welcome fruits, refreshments, and afternoon tea. Breakfast was eaten in the pavilion by the river. The amount was so rich that I couldn’t eat it. I was afraid of wasting it and returned some to the kitchen. It’s a real Chinese yard and Chinese style. It’s great. I hope it can be well preserved. This is the first time I write a review so seriously…

The whole stay was a good experience. This time I stayed in a Republic of China twin room. The room layout is very comfortable and the supporting supplies are also very good. The whole garden environment is very beautiful. I can walk around and see every scene. It has great privacy. It is rare to find a clean place. People feel very relaxed. On the night of check-in, we also prepared small snacks and gifts for the children, which was very considerate. All the staff had a very good service attitude and made our family have a pleasant holiday. I was honored to meet the hotel’s designer, Mr. Zhou Weiguo, during my stay this time. The old gentleman was very kind and generous. I hope to go there again when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom😊

初夏，一進院子滿眼的翠綠，在和煦的微風裡緩步欣賞，流觴曲水，一步一景，着實是心靈與身體的雙重享受。
道路兩旁錯落有致又種類繁多的花都開了，好多花我都叫不出名字來，但主打一個賞心悦目。進入院子後有很多的亭台樓閣，可以在每個點坐坐，和三五好友喝杯茶聊聊天好不愜意。池底圓嘟嘟的錦鯉也是躍然着喜慶的氣息與整個院子的古色古香相得益彰。
晚上住的房間我也很滿意，清雅大氣，格調別緻。下次會再來，杭州住酒店的首選。真心安利，住中國院子，品人間美景。
