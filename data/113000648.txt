Breakfast taste was good but could have bigger and better spread. 
The room is very comfortable, bed pillow could have more option, the hotel have turn down service as well. 
The hotel should have robot to send the deliveries to the room instead of collecting from then back of the hotel. 
***The hotel should give more direction for didi drivers to know how to drive into lobby. 
Hotel is in too new area so nothing much around here. Maybe will be back if I have chance.

The room design divided the toilet, bathroom, and dressing table into three areas. This is a design that I have never seen in other hotels. The salad bar in the restaurant is very fresh, and the sofas are inlaid along the corridor, which is not crowded and convenient. A very wonderful experience.

msg:The hotel is really amazing. We upgraded to a super large suite without any discussion. It was really a surprise and a great experience!
I got off work too late yesterday and was in Pudong. I had to go to another place the next day. I was too lazy to go home so I thought I would find a hotel near Qiantan. I hesitated between Shangri-La and 31 Artyzen. In the end, I thought Artyzen would be newer, so I decided on Artyzen. But to be honest, from the official pictures on Ctrip, I thought the interior decoration of Artyzen was quite ordinary.
But after checking in, it really was not ordinary. It was very comfortable with the original wood wabi-sabi style. It’s really that the official pictures were not taken well!
It was almost 9pm when we checked in. The front desk told me that because there were too many guests, there was no king-size room that we had originally booked, so we were upgraded to a suite for free. It was such a pleasant surprise.
But when I walked into the room, I realized that my luck was really behind me. The suite was so high-end that I had imagined it was beyond my imagination...
There was a guest bathroom at the entrance, which had a living room, dining room, cloakroom, desk, glass in the bathroom and an LCD screen for watching TV, snacks and drinks in the mini bar that could be picked up by yourself, and takeaways that could be delivered to your door by a robot (I really have to say this. I have seen too many five-star hotels where takeaways could only be delivered to the front desk for self-collection). The scenery outside the window was also very good. Although there was a building blocking the view in front, you could still see the traffic outside from the bathtub.
The bedding was very comfortable, it should be duck down, you could smell the duck, and the bathrobe was lined with down, I loved it.
Because I was in a hurry to go to work the next day, I didn't book breakfast, but to be honest, it was really a great deal to enjoy a suite of 7,000+ for a price of 1,200+.
The service was also very good. The hotel was full of smiling services, which really soothed the tired hearts of workers after work.
The hotel was really good. I worked hard overtime and will come again next time.

Breakfast is semi-buffet style, but it is introduced by the waiter. It is not introduced in detail. It is better to make a paper menu directly for selection.

When we walked into the hotel, we felt the special texture and high-end feeling. The warm reception and friendly attitude of Angel at the front desk made us feel the sincerity and care of the hotel to the guests. She also gave us two breakfasts with a sweet smile, which made me feel that I would choose to stay here next time. In addition, Carey helped me solve a small check-in issue very patiently the next day until we checked out, which was very touching.

The breakfast is OK and the food is complete. The tofu curd tastes a bit sour and the cherry tomatoes taste a bit too much.
In terms of service, the front desk staff is OK.
The staff at the hotel entrance was very indifferent, did not say hello or help with luggage
When entering the hotel, someone helped press the elevator, without any introduction to the hotel or communication.
In addition, I was stopped at the door the next day, which was a bad experience.
The complimentary toiletry bag is OK
Although the toothbrush is made of environmentally friendly materials, there are quality issues. The bristles stuck out and the gums were bleeding. I gave feedback to the check-out receptionist, but did not get good feedback. The price is high and the service needs to be improved.

First of all, location and transportation: The hotel is surrounded by Taikoo Li Qiantan, which is very convenient for eating and shopping... We can take the subway directly from Shanghai Station. When we arrive at noon, we have a meal in Taikoo Li before checking in. In addition, you can also take the subway directly from the hotel to Disneyland, which is very convenient.
Secondly, the hotel lobby is very artistic, the rooms are well arranged, and the beds are very comfortable. There is also a minibar for the first time every day, and it is cleaned in a timely manner every day!
The waiters are generous, decent and enthusiastic. They will say hello when meeting and help with delivery when ordering takeout.
The only drawback is that the hotel dinner is relatively simple, so I didn’t eat it in the hotel~

The beef noodles and handmade wontons were very delicious. The other breakfasts were also very attentive and compared to the same price. The breakfast in the hotel must be delicious, but the service is really mediocre. When I checked in at one o'clock at noon, I was told that the room had not been cleaned. They sat next to me until 2:30 and then informed me that I could check in. It shouldn't take more than an hour and a half to clean a room. , there was an internal coordination problem, and no special care was given to me as I sat there for an hour and a half, and I was not even given a glass of water. When I got to the room, I found that the window was facing a tower of high-voltage wires. I was worried that electromagnetic interference would affect my sleep, so I called the front desk to ask for a room change. After I called the first time to inquire, there was no response for half an hour. The second call said that the room was full and they could not change. I said it. I was worried that I wouldn't sleep well. The front desk asked me to coordinate and change my room if there was one at the back. However, no one contacted me to change my room until I checked out on the fourth day. I was too lazy to go to the front desk. I went out every day during the day and at night. When I went back to sleep, the truth was that I really didn't sleep well these three nights. There was almost no proactive service awareness, and I didn’t ask if I needed a toothbrush. When I came out of the shower, I found that I didn’t have a toothbrush. I planned to call the switchboard, but I couldn’t get through by pressing 0. I also couldn’t get through when I tried to call the official number on my mobile phone. In the end, I still used the restaurant. Use WeChat to ask the restaurant waiter to contact the front desk to find someone to help deliver it. The niche brand hotel does have some thoughtful features in design and breakfast, but there are indeed many shortcomings in service training, and it is not worthy of the 1,399 room price. Next time I go to Qiantan, I will definitely stay back in Shanglali. A bad stay experience!

My feeling after going to Shanghai these past few times is that there are more or less problems with hotel hardware, but the services of several 5-star hotels are very good, which makes up for the shortcomings in facilities.

msg:First, let’s talk about the design of the house. I have stayed in many well-known design team hotels. The room design of this hotel uses mirror elements in many places. The entrance full-length mirror is relatively dim, with only an aisle light at the door; and then there is a place similar to a dressing table. A mirror that can rotate 360 ​​degrees. The mirror setting here made me think of visiting a prisoner at first; the two semicircular mirrors in the corner may be for some design needs, but they are a bit nondescript; the washbasin uses a solid mirror, and a mirror that can It is a combination of rectangular mirrors that are turned at 90 degrees, which is a perfect combination. There is a mirror ***** on the bedside, which is 120-150cm long. It may be to match the bedside lamp to create an effect. I don’t agree with the overall combination, but of course my personal vision is different. The more eye-catching design is the bathing area. The combination of bathtub and shower, plus 3 different sets of lighting designs, and appropriately small windows reflect a different aesthetic. What is worth complaining about is the breakfast. Of course, I am also grateful for the free breakfast provided by the hotel. The breakfast is semi-self-service, but many details of the service are worthy of scrutiny. There are 4-5 dishes at the front desk, including sweet, salty and spicy, but it is only equipped with I bought a serving spoon, which means that this will be a spoon that can taste all the sweetness, bitterness, and spicyness; homemade yogurt is a highlight, but the fruits that come with it are a little scarce. I only saw watermelon and a small portion of the It is red pitaya paired with yogurt; in the self-service porridge area, there are 4 small side dishes. Due to the unchanged handling, many ingredients have fallen on the cooking table while the customer is taking it, but no one has taken care of it for a long time. There seemed to be a lot of waiters, but the details were not well controlled; the last order was an a la carte meal. I chose a Cantonese dim sum, shrimp dumpling king, but it was only one piece, and it was obviously over-steamed, and it was one Cheap quick-frozen semi-finished products, semi-finished products should also be divided into grades; the next choice is double-sided fried eggs with mushroom spinach. Objectively speaking, the egg is good, but the mushroom spinach is warm, and it is not cooked first, although it takes a long time; in the end I chose A bowl of tomato beef noodles. Objectively speaking, it is full of ingredients and tastes good. However, the bowl I chose is too small. During the eating process, I was always worried that my pasta would fall out of the bowl. I wanted to put my omelette in it. There is no space at all in the noodles; based on this, the hotel may consider making exquisite breakfast to eliminate waste, but from my experience, it is quite bad. If the hotel price is 238 yuan per person, I think it is not worth it. Generally speaking, this hotel gives me the feeling that the hotel has not been fully adjusted yet. Based on the hotel's positioning, I think there is still a lot of room for improvement. I hope to work hard to improve it.

The hotel girl was very considerate and asked me to go to a nearby hospital. She also specially brought me a bowl of hot food in the morning. Porridge, honey water, bread and fruits were provided, and many bottles of mineral water were added to the room. Today's check-out time was extended by 4 hours.

msg:I have never given a negative review on Ctrip, and this time I really have to give a big bad review.
Let’s talk about the advantages first: all the staff I encountered were greeted with smiles, and they were serious about solving problems. The service was excellent, but the various hardware and supporting facilities were compromised.
The problems I encountered in just two nights include: 1. The air conditioner was cold. On the first night of my stay, the air conditioner was turned on for most of the day and I felt cold even when I showered. 2. The design of the room circulation and facilities is super unreasonable. The shower and bathtub are together without any partition. The door is opened at both ends and cannot be completely closed. Moreover, I did not see anywhere to put clean clothes or change dirty clothes from beginning to end... ...I don’t know if there is any special purpose behind this design, I’m sorry I can’t get it. 3. The water temperature in the bathroom cannot be raised. The answer we received was that the floor we live on has not been occupied for a long time, so it will take a long time for the water to get hot... And we have already stayed on the second night, and the water is still not hot... This Do you think the reason is scientific? 4. The breakfast is hard to describe. It feels like foreigners are trying hard to make Chinese food. It doesn’t matter that the breakfast buffet has few choices. The wontons and noodles are kept warm in a thermos bucket. What’s the point of adding soup when the guests want to eat... and takeaways? no difference. Objectively speaking, the Western-style breakfast is okay, and the coffee is delicious, but the Chinese food is really unnecessary. 5. The front desk phone always fails to get through. It is no exaggeration to say that it takes at least 3 calls every night to get through. This is why I gave up the complaint on the first night. If I have time to call, I might as well solve the problem by myself. As a result, I still had to call several times on the second night before getting through, and the reply I got was that I was talking to other guests at the time. It's so busy that there is only one person working at the front desk at night. This is the only complaint I have about the service.
Finally, although the exterior design of the hotel is still very unique, I advise those with children to stick to the Shangri-La next door. Don’t be like me and think about trying a new hotel. This hotel is really unfriendly to families with children.

msg:After staying at the hotel several times, Artyzen 31 has become the first choice hotel in Shanghai. All the staff are very professional and I am moved by everyone's sincerity every time I go home.
   I have so much to thank you for this time, especially the professional and enthusiastic help from the following colleagues, which deeply touched me:
  1. Carey had already got off work. When she heard that I was coming back, she was waiting at the front desk. It was very heart-warming! Seeing that there were more than 2 people in my family, we took the initiative to arrange extra beds. The room lady arranged them as quickly as possible to ensure that everyone had a good night's sleep for a few days. Thanks Carey for taking care of me!
  2. Artyzen has the best Eggs Benedict (beyond eggs Benedict from all chain five-star, luxury five-star, Forbes five-star, World Luxury Hotels Alliance, etc.) restaurants in Hong and Wilson (the names are not too sure), No matter how busy I am during the Spring Festival, I will ask the executive chef to prepare the family’s favorite eggs Benedict. Thank you!
  3. My favorite bookstore is the bookstore in the hotel. It is a small but refined book with a lot of thought. It contains the works of Huang Gongwang, Huang Tingjian, Su Shi, Mi Fu and many other important Chinese historical figures. It is difficult to buy in the world. I benefit a lot every time I read it.
      Looking forward to staying at Artyzen 31 again!

Service: The service is worthy of praise. The service staff are very friendly when meeting. The aunt who delivers things is very friendly every time she comes over. She serves with a smile. I stayed for three days and came back every day during the day. The aunt folded the clothes for her, which is very considerate. Hopefully this hotel will continue to be like this over time! In addition, I like the breakfast very much. There are not many varieties at any time, but it is very exquisite. The surrounding Qiantan New District is very convenient for shopping and eating.

The male waiters at dinner were all warm and friendly. They patiently explained the red wine to us and asked us if we had any dietary restrictions. Their standardized and enthusiastic service made us feel like spring breeze in the winter...
Thanks to the beautiful girl Mei Zi at the front desk for her kind greetings, asking about our stay experience, and sending us off enthusiastically. She took the trouble to answer any questions during the period, and her sweet smile is still fresh in our memory.
Thanks to all the staff I met at the hotel for making my birthday unforgettable. Thank you for your hard work, see you again when you have the chance!

Especially Amber, she called a day in advance to ask about arrival time, room requirements and preferences, helped me with my luggage and checked in, and also took the initiative to help introduce the hotel's internal facilities, local tourist attractions, special food, and gym. Thank you very much for Amber's thoughtfulness and meticulousness. , makes me feel very warm.

I was impressed by the modern and artistic design of the hotel.
The decoration of the guest rooms is even more exquisite. The rooms are equipped with intelligent control systems, comfortable mattresses, wet and dry bathrooms and large bathtubs, small speakers, yoga mats and elastic bands, and a free mini bar equipped with four small soft drinks. , soda water and Tsingtao beer, automatic coffee machine, welcome dessert sesame cake, truly reflect the hotel's intentions.

Breakfast is served in the Shanghai Modern restaurant on the L floor. It is semi-buffet style. You can pick up salads, fruits, etc. In addition, you can order staple food from the menu, which includes Chinese and Western styles. You can choose according to your own taste. Heidi and Andi at the restaurant were very friendly and offered to help cut fruit and get milk. I ordered an avocado salad. Seeing that I was a woman, they asked the chef to arrange a flower-shaped platter.
The gym is on the 6th floor of the hotel. It can be used for free 24 hours a day by swiping the room card. The fitness equipment is the world's most advanced Technogym brand, which is the "Ferrari of fitness equipment".

If you have time, you can also go to the "Book Pavilion" on the L floor to check in, take photos, and read books.

I stayed at the Artyzen Hotel Qiantan 31 in Shanghai this weekend. It has only been open for 2 months, but it was unexpectedly delicious, comfortable and beautiful!

👉 The hotel is adjacent to Taikoo Li Qiantan, and just downstairs is the 🚇 subway station, which is very convenient for shopping, eating and traveling.

👉 As expected of an Artychen brand with a strong sense of design, a large number of arc elements are used in public corridors/secret gardens/room bathrooms, and the visual effects are amazing!

👉 I have checked in to two other 🔝 hotels around Qiantan before, the famous Shangri-La and Kimpton. In fact, the price/performance ratio is inferior to Artyzen Hotel Shanghai Qiantan 31, with more cost-effective price, larger space and better service. , of course choose it!

👉 The Shanghai Modern restaurant is located on the L floor of the hotel, where you can eat the same food from breakfast to night! Sit into the secret garden of the restaurant on a winter evening, get the beautiful private a**osphere directly, and have a cup of warm Maillard hot chocolate, a perfect experience 💯

msg:It was my first time to go to Qiantan in Shanghai and I chose Artyzen among Kimpton/Shangri-La/31 Artychen. The room was much larger than the other two at the same price. I called the day before check-in to discuss my preferences.
        I had some luggage transported to the hotel 2 hours before arriving. After communication, the hotel had already put it in the prepared room. This was very good. After arriving at the hotel, I quickly checked in and went to check it out.
        The room is really big, and the decoration style should be the popular "Wabi-sabi style" now? Light-colored wooden furniture + dark hard decoration have a special sense of collision. There are many furniture arrangements, covering the whole room, but it does not feel crowded. The bed is big, soft and white, and you can tell by looking at it. Can have a good sleep.
         The bathrooms are on both sides. The bathrooms are particularly large. The dark stone tiles don't feel cold when you step on them. They actually feel very delicate and comfortable. It's just that it's too big and feels a bit cold.
          The tea table provides a lot of things, and the products used are of high quality. The experience is perfect.
        The hotel's semi-buffet breakfast is really a surprise. It's not too much, but it's really good. The quality and appearance are very good. Especially the breakfast service staff, who are professional and enthusiastic, and very heartwarming.
       A few more minor shortcomings:
        1. The bathroom is not equipped with a dirty clothes basket.
        2. The wardrobe is a bit small, especially with such a large platform, the wardrobe is only half the size.
        3. It would be better if the welcome cakes were replaced with fruits.
        4. The breakfast buffet is lightly seasoned.
        5. Are all toiletry kits provided upon request? Not noticed in the room?
        It is a very warm and professional hotel. I hope to have the opportunity to stay here again.

One suggestion: Is there a shelf for storing supplies in the shower area?
Currently, I only need to take a shower but not a bath, so I have to go far away to get shampoo and shower, and my things can only be placed on the floor, which is inconvenient.

During my stay, no matter from the ground lobby to the front desk, the restaurant to the room service, everyone's sincere enthusiasm made me feel more cordial and they also helped me. Late check-out makes traveling more convenient. The free mini bar, welcome fruits, and welcome cookies reflect the hotel's intentions. Breakfast is also a semi-buffet, cooked to order, which is waste-free and healthy and delicious. The location is also very convenient. The underground passage leads directly to Qiantan and the subway station. Although the room continues Neri&Hu's quirky design, the warm service makes up for it.

The elevated view from the room is pretty good, there are a lot of small gifts and drinks, and the hotel is very thoughtful. Small details can be adjusted. There are Hong Kong-style steamed pastries for breakfast, a full range of fruits, and an exquisite style. However, there are too few Chinese dishes and the food is served slowly. It takes a while to trouble the waiter to drink a cup of hot coffee or pour hot milk. It's a bit inconvenient, so I recommend the hot drinks area, where Chinese condiments can be arranged for self-service. It is recommended to replace the hand shower with a different one. The water pressure is low, which affects the comfort experience. The cost of replacement should not be high.

It is a large bookstore. The furniture, small appliances, and bathtubs in the guest rooms are all from international brands. The only regret is that the toilet is ordinary and not smart. Because it was the Chinese New Year, the room service did not tell us how to operate it in advance. We did not take a shower that night, but took a shower the next morning🏠. My mother and I are very happy and satisfied this time and will come back next time. I am 54 years old and my mother is 84 years old. We have grown old. Some small appliances need popular science.

msg:A very bad hotel experience!
On a business trip, I was near Qiantan. I saw that 31 Artyzen had good reviews, so I booked it for two nights. Unexpectedly, it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in!
I arrived at the store on the 12th and was arranged on the 18th floor according to my request. The room temperature was unusually high. The air conditioner was in a unified central control mode. The room could not be adjusted individually, and the temperature was always around 30 degrees. I called the front desk and sent an engineer to look at it. They actually said that there was no way to adjust it. I opened a window and turned on the ventilation to the maximum. They said that the ventilation temperature dropped...; the result was that the temperature remained the same all night. At the same time, the cold air from the window is also pouring into the room, and the 30-degree hot air from the air conditioner is still blowing! The bedding in the hotel is also very poor, with stiff and non-breathable fabrics. Because the hot air from the air conditioner in the room and the cold wind from the window alternately hit me, I was covered in sweat when I covered myself with the quilt, and there was a chill when I exposed it. I couldn't sleep at all, so I asked the hotel to send it to me. The buckwheat pillow that came was just like a stone, and it was an angular stone. My hands were numb after sleeping on it all night. It was not a pillow, it was a torture instrument!
At the end of the night, I contracted a severe cold. My wife stayed awake all night and was in an extremely bad mood. To sum up the experience of this night, I was in a sauna, covered with plastic, and pillowed on stones! ! ! It was probably not such a painful night after being arrested! It seriously affects our physical and mental health!
On the 13th of the next day, I reported the situation to the hotel early in the morning, and the hotel agreed to change the room to the 12th floor. I worked all day on Saturday despite a severe cold, and returned to the hotel with my wife in the evening, thinking that I should be able to do it tonight. I took a good rest, but something went wrong with the temperature of the bath water again. I turned the water to the hottest temperature and left it for 10 minutes, but it was still basically cold and I couldn’t take a bath at all!
I couldn't stand it anymore, so I immediately booked the Shangri-La next door, checked out and left!
A hotel is a place for travelers to have a good rest. If the air-conditioning temperature cannot be controlled, there is a problem with the bath water temperature, and the bedding is uncomfortable, is it still necessary for this hotel to exist?
After all, the room price is 1,500 per night. How did Xiaohongshu and Ctrip get so many good reviews? I doubt it!
Room temperature and hot water supply are all related to the hotel's infrastructure. If this is not up to standard, where is the money spent? ? ? ?

msg:We booked a hotel to watch the show in the black box downstairs, and we can check the tickets directly when we go downstairs, invincible! Then I found myself in a hotel with my favorite musician and took a photo together. I'm lucky enough to have breakfast in the same restaurant with my favorite musician at the same time.

The breakfast at the hotel is very good, semi-buffet, with salami, Spanish ham, cheese and wet yogurt, and various juices (the worst part is the radish juice, not the kind of garbage radish juice mixed with apple juice, it's very good Drink) You can always order food. The omelette and pork ribs noodles are very delicious. The portions are small and will not cause unnecessary waste. Good reviews (hate wasting food)

整體服務優等，至於居住的環境：

1.酒店景色一般，這也許是我購買入住房型有關
2.房間燈過於暗，建議可以加些明亮的燈
3.室內拖鞋不好穿，也許是環保有關用料，所以有點硬

其餘的沒問題！

廁所特別優秀，但如果有免治馬桶就會更加分

先説可改進的：房間裏到處是鏡子，用品3天一換不理解，浴室門不可緊閉，浴室出水量小，排水慢如洗澡過久水會溢出到房間裏。
不錯的：新酒店挺乾淨，設計別有一番風味，服務不錯。
總結：性價比尚可，但追求品質的建議降低期待～

設施可能還沒完全調試好，通往地下車庫的的電梯一到B2就開個縫，然後自動關上，再把我們送回一樓。我們半夜想出去吃個宵夜，結果電梯拉我們上上下下，試了幾次無果，找值班小妹妹反饋，説會去反饋維修。
服務我覺得可以提升下，就是關懷度，價格來看的話算是五星級酒店了，但是服務感覺少點温度，比如退房時也不會問下感受；對於半夜住客反饋的電梯怪事也衹字未提。
早飯半自助的形式沒毛病，但是還是注重下食物的質素。比如芝士三明治，白麪包直接放上去感覺味道差了點，我們提出麻煩烤一下，結果衹烤了一邊..

msg:做為雅辰酒店的高端店，上海前灘31雅辰酒店還是很不錯的！雖然離高架橋很近，但酒店建築隔音做的挺好，在房間裏基本沒有什麼噪音。酒店離前灘太古裏步行五六分鐘，樓下就是前灘31演藝中心，購物、看演出都十分方便！酒店的服務人員不多，但服務意識和服務質量都挺到位的！會提前跟你確認一些特殊要求並認真幫你安排。賓客關係部門的人員尤其熱情主動的提供服務，值得表揚！酒店是如恩做的設計，依然是如恩設計的老毛病，公共空間的設計看點和風格都很有特色，但客房設計對入住客人的舒適度和功能的忽視都十分讓人頭疼！淋浴房設計的大而不當，毛巾沒處掛，衣物沒處放！房間的沙發也做的大而不當，你在房間裏走動，一不小心就會撞到腿！唉，酒店設計的根本還是人，不能衹為了玩技巧和風格，而讓人住的不舒服！但這些都不是酒店方的問題！在上海前灘31雅辰酒店住了十天九晚，讓人不太滿意的還有酒店的早餐，竟然能十天半月的不換菜品，這讓長住的客人實在有點失望啊！不過，上海前灘31雅辰酒店還是一個性價比很高、值得再次入住的酒店！
