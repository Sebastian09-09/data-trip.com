msg:Expected too much, received too less. very complicated if it's your first time, to find the main building for reception, no clear signs then no directions for the parking lot. Nobody to greet you outside, neither inside, nobody cares you're there, that's not normal for Intercontinental, maybe all the employers were in a bad mood. The hotel nicely offered an upgrade to a suite, I don't want to sound ungrateful but there was only two tiny windows, it was dark and smelly, the air purifier was not enough the clean the room bad smell, no window at all in the suite living room. Beside that, on Saturday they were making maintenance in the garage and a terrible toxic smell was coming to our suite on the 4th floor!! Not only to our room but to the whole hotel areas, outside as well. with a room that has a very small window, was quite uncomfortable to enjoy the room, I felt jealous of the other rooms who has a proper and big window.  So I'm still not sure if it was really a good thing accepting the upgrade. The breakfast was very nice and not crowded, food seves well. they have a nice garden, public and one reserved only for hotel guests, that gives you some peace to relax as the hotel area is invaded everyday by outsiders to take pictures, would be much better if has more places to sit, to stay beside the fountain, we sat on the floor. Intercontinental Ruijin is a beautiful property that should be an amazing place to stay but right now, I don't recommend.

msg:The grounds  are beautiful and I’m sure at one time the hotel was beautiful. However it’s lacking basic service and attention to the overall customers experience. When you arrive you’re lost. There’s no signs to the reception so you just walk around until you can find it. The shower pressure was very low and not hot. Real bummer. I don’t think there was a fridge. The mattress is super bouncy-not my preference. The worst part of my experience was when I changed into my swimsuit and went to use the pool and everyone from the attendant to the manager told me I couldn’t use the pool without a swim cap. There is not mention of this on  the policy general policy or on the pool policy page. I saw no mention at at the pool. Then they wanted to sell me a swim cap for ¥100. I should mention here that I have no hair. Bald completely. The staff and management had no interest in accommodating me other than to sell me a cap.

msg:InterContinental being my favorite hotel, I always look for one wherever I go. I was in Shanghai for a short stay and I wanted it to be relaxing and elegant so… didn’t have to think too much about it. You guys never disappoint me. First of all, just by walking around th hotel you get a free history lesson about Shanghai from decades ago. Beautiful paintings on the wall, gorgeous architecture, y’all the bathtub in my room was… incredible. It made me forgive you for not having the spa working on that day. There’s this quiet room you can go to read a book or just enjoy the pictures of important events, people or movies. The food is good! I spent my morning walking around the beautiful garden. My room had a great view and a balcony, thanks to the gentleman who made my checkin. I tend to get the highest floor and he was super nice in getting a really good room for me when I explained what I wanted. On the way to my room I met this elegant butler who easily told me how to get to my room like he had the hotel map memorized in his head and gave me this Downton Abbey vibes, you know what I mean?! Amazing!!! Love it ❤️

However we made the most of it, as the grounds are lovely and breakfast served in the coffee shop La Rue was excellent.
We stayed in the Suite, and found the staff especially kind and helpful to our needs, as we have a two year old.
Harris at the front desk, was extremely good to us! Ask for him when you are there!
This is a quality place, which will be even better once the city is free of pandemic restrictions!

msg:A very satisfying stay! This is my favorite hotel in Shanghai after visiting it countless times. This time, I accompanied my parents to visit friends and experienced the "Xing'anli Garden Hotel" in "Cheng Huan Ji". The lady at the front desk, Yan Tongxie, is beautiful, kind and professional. When she heard that we came here because of "Cheng Huan Ji", she directly upgraded us to the executive room of the VIP building, and also arranged the celebrity mansion guest room that is generally not booked to the public. Because "Cheng Huan Ji" was filmed in the Celebrity Mansion in Building 1. It's so loving! 
The Celebrity Mansion, built in 1917, was once the official residence of British businessman Mr. Malis. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek and Soong Mei-ling held their engagement ceremony here and stayed. Comrade Chen Yi, the first mayor of Shanghai, also worked here during his term. In addition, there is a "Presidential Building" completed in 1920 in the hotel, where many foreign dignitaries including former US President Nixon and Prince William of the United Kingdom have stayed.
The hotel is in a very good location, close to Xintiandi, Sinan Mansions and the famous historical and cultural street of Wukang Road. We originally planned to walk around the city, but the hotel environment was too romantic and elegant, so we spent the whole day taking photos and walking around. My parents also praised the hotel. It was a perfect family trip! Thank you to all the hotel staff for providing us with such quality service.

msg:On June 1, I took my children to the InterContinental Hotel Ruijin, a quiet garden house in the center of Shanghai. When I entered the hotel, I saw lush trees on both sides of the boulevard, gurgling rivers, and various flowers blooming. The grass on the lawn seemed to be wearing green clothes. Couples held their weddings in this fairy-tale world. The classical European villa architecture is even more charming in the bustling city center. The hotel also upgraded us to the parent-child suite in the main building. The room is quiet, elegant, spacious, comfortable and warm, so that our children spent a happy "June 1" Children's Day. Afternoon tea is exquisite. Enjoy a leisurely and comfortable time in the elegant piano sound. The breakfast is rich in variety and excellent in quality, especially the Chinese dim sum is delicious. The crystal shrimp jiao is made of whole shrimps. Children like to eat it. The service is also very good and I will go again next time...

msg:It is always rare to have the opportunity to stay in a hotel when you come to Shanghai. So pick your favorite every time. It was decided the day before this time. After looking at a few hotels, I immediately decided to stay in Ruijin. The location is in Laoluwan District, between Ruijin 2nd Road, Maoming South Road, and Fuxing Middle Road, Yongjia Road, making it convenient to travel. I feel like people checking in will not be crowded here. Low-key and luxurious French garden architecture. Very comfortable. Walk around inside, take photos, and make beautiful memories with your family. The buffet breakfast is rich, both Chinese and Western, and has many Shanghai characteristics. People who like freshly squeezed vegetable and fruit juices should ensure vitamins and fiber if they go out frequently.

Yuki helped me upgrade my room when I checked in, and it happened to be her when I left. Appointed a taxi to the airport for me. All service staff are very friendly. My family members in Shanghai are disabled. When they came to see me, the handsome waiter who drove the shuttle bus specially coordinated with the basement to avoid having to walk too much. Next time I come back to Shanghai, I’ll stay here again! 😍

msg:Overall, I am very satisfied with the hotel. The hotel has a beautiful environment and the white cherry blossoms are in full bloom. It is very beautiful. The Ctrip order did not indicate which floor we were staying on, so we were assigned to Building 3. We arrived relatively early and they made arrangements for us in advance. When we got to the room, we found that the garbage in the trash can had not been cleaned. This is hard to imagine in a five-star hotel. However, I praise their ability to deal with the problem quickly. They immediately moved us to the main building. Their attitude was sincere and we received our understanding. This is great, the room is large, the facilities are very good, the lobby is beautiful, the breakfast is rich, the smoked salmon is great, the night light in the room is too bright at night, I hope it can be improved! By the way, which building is best reflected in Ctrip orders?

It can be seen that the hotel has a strong historical heritage. It is said to be the place where Jiang and Song were engaged. It was a pity that we came here in winter. The carefully designed courtyard was a little bleak because of the winter. If we come again in summer or autumn, it will definitely be beautiful! The hotel front desk service is very good! Patiently introduced various facilities of the hotel and helped me upgrade to a suite! very happy! The hotel and rooms are all in an old-money style - well-decorated. The layout is reasonable. The breakfast was delicious! There are many foreigners here, and it feels more Western-style. Even in winter, many local citizens choose to get married here. The hotel is very clean and very attentive. When I see me with my child, I put a lot of water on purpose. The location here is perfect for shopping. It’s very convenient to go anywhere. Looking forward to staying here again next time when the beautiful season changes!

A small problem is that the building in the room we are in is relatively low, because the courtyard is open, and there will be many people coming to the courtyard to take photos or activities on the lawn. Relatively speaking, it will be a bit noisy during the day if there are many people.

The hotel exudes the luxury of old Shanghai in both the public areas and the rooms. It is especially worth mentioning that Carrie, Xiaoyan, the check-in receptionist, has a particularly hearty and friendly feeling. Friendly but not pretentious, professional and fast. Fully consider the demands of northern guests for temperature and humidity. I feel that I have stayed in many hotels at home and abroad, but it is rare to see such a comfortable front desk.

msg:I have admired the name of Ruijin Hotel for a long time. Since I wanted to spend Valentine's Day with my girlfriend, Ruijin Hotel was very special. In addition, Ruijin cooperated with Intercontinental Group, so I took this opportunity to explore the style of old Shanghai in Ruijin Hotel.
       After this trip, I can only say that Ruijin Hotel deserves to be the State Guesthouse in Shanghai. The history of Ruijin Hotel seems to be unfolding in front of my eyes along with the breeze of the bungalow garden lawn: in 1927, it was the place where Soong Meiling got engaged, and in 1956, it officially became the reception venue of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. One of the places where he has received heads of state. In 1979, it was changed to Ruijin Hotel (one of the four major state hotels in Shanghai at the time).
        I am very grateful to every staff member of Ruijin Hotel. They are full of smiles and the service also shows the style of old Shanghai. The Shanghai dialect used when chatting with them and the retro lobby are even more Shanghai-style.
        Although the facilities are old, they are not old either. The old money style is vividly reflected in Ruijin Hotel. You may not be able to see it in the photos, but if you experience it once, you will know that Ruijin Hotel has put a lot of effort into maintaining it. They show that era. The sense of sophistication and high-end is difficult to experience in today's fast-paced era. Ruijin Hotel (InterContinental Hotel) deserves its name as a flagship store. The richness of history cannot be displayed by the so-called national style and simple hotels nowadays.
        If you have the chance, you will definitely come back to experience Ruijin Hotel. Strolling and drinking tea in Ruijin Hotel is really a rare and beautiful moment in life.

You can walk or cycle on the streets to experience the culture of Shanghai for the first time; you have already arrived at the hotel by car from Beijing. It was after nine o'clock in the evening, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel upgraded me to an executive room in the VIP building. This undoubtedly added comfort to my tiring journey. The hotel's service staff had a very good attitude and made people feel warm; the executive room had It feels like an old-money style. The bathroom is very clean, which I am very satisfied with. I am a person who is obsessed with the cleanliness of the bathroom. The mattress is very comfortable and the sound insulation is good. This couple travels to Shanghai and averages 10,000 steps a day. From now on, sleep and rest at night are particularly important. Let’s talk about the breakfast buffet. There are many categories and the quality control is OK. Many of them can be seasoned according to your own preferences. There are both Chinese and Western food, but it’s a pity that the stomach is so big. After breakfast, in the garden It is also very pleasant to stroll around; the experience of staying here for the past two days made my husband and I immediately decide that they will choose this hotel when they come to Shanghai for vacation in the future. I hope the hotel can stay here.

The room was bright, spacious, and very clean. There was a cleaning lady on the fifth floor named Hu Chunyan. When she saw us going upstairs, she warmly greeted us and said Happy New Year. Because we have an elderly person with limited legs and feet, she asked us if there was anything else we needed. , the next day when the door opened, I saw Aunt Hu again greeting me with a happy New Year! They proactively requested that the room be cleaned for us right away. The service was really good and the experience was reassuring and comfortable. The executive courtesy afternoon tea in the VIP building is a great place to take photos and check in, it’s beautiful! The location is strategic and it is very convenient to eat out.

Everything else is great, breakfast, service, room facilities, absolutely nothing to say. It’s especially difficult for waiters. They are especially busy on New Year’s Eve and cannot go home to celebrate the New Year. They have to maintain full enthusiasm for work.

Of course, this is inseparable from the gentleness, consideration and professionalism of Miss Chris Ni Yuanling at the hotel front desk, which makes me feel particularly warm every time. Although I was not in charge that day, they arranged the room for me in advance, upgraded it, and provided me with welcome fruits and drinks, which made me feel warm in the cold winter. For this reason, I will still As always, choose Ruijin Intercontinental. ps: The hotel’s culture, environment, and facilities are also impeccable!

The hotel is quiet in the bustle, low-key and luxurious. A warm and thoughtful male receptionist at the front desk helped us upgrade to a suite for free. Thank you very much. ! The room was clean and beautiful. The only drawback was that the quilt was too thin and the air conditioner was not too warm. Overall, I like it

The pillows are very comfortable and the bed is on the soft side but has some support.
Disadvantages: The facilities are a bit old. This time I stayed in Building 3 next to Yatai Pavilion. Compared with the international hotels I have stayed in, the hygiene in details is not good. The balcony door was broken, the body lotion was gone, and the overhead shower head was leaking. Disposable bath mats are not provided, and drinks in the refrigerator are charged.

      Bad points: The hotel has no facilities suitable for children.
The temperature in the room when sleeping at night is too high and too dry. The key is that the temperature and humidity cannot be adjusted, which makes the child irritable and difficult to sleep.
There were only paper towels in the toilet in the entire room; there was no welcome gift.

I didn't have time to check in carefully at this century-old hotel. The overall feeling is very much like old Shanghai. The waiters who greeted me in the middle of the night were very enthusiastic and very nice. The breakfast was acceptable, not particularly rich, but it was very suitable for my taste. I did a little homework on the way back. It turns out that this Ruijin Hotel has such a rich history and was the place where Jiang Song got engaged. It’s a pity that I didn’t check in this hotel carefully. I will come back next time. I hope I can improve this hotel. Take a good walk around again and feel it carefully.

When I booked the hotel, I marked the double bed. When I arrived at the hotel, the hotel said that the mark on Ctrip could not be seen. , it took 20 minutes to coordinate the room. In the end, an extra 368 was added to the reserved room every day, so I was given the so-called exclusive room. Because after the addition, the room fee was nearly 2,000 a day, and I felt like I was being kidnapped. This price is okay I went to stay in a higher-end hotel.

I chose Building 3 this time, regardless of the scenery and It feels worse than the other two buildings, so if you can, don’t get Building 3.

msg:I want to give it one point but I think the hygiene and environment are not that bad, but the service attitude is really bad. The so-called executive lounge does not have any services, just waiters watching you, and the so-called afternoon tea is just a fake. I booked two executive rooms for two nights. Each room included two breakfasts and two executive lounges, a total of 8 meals. However, I only had breakfast once and used the executive lounge once, for a total of three people. . One morning, after breakfast, two friends came to visit at about ten o'clock. In order to facilitate chatting, it was natural for the three of us to sit in the lounge. However, the waiter repeatedly reminded us that we could only drink tea and not have breakfast. My friends had already eaten breakfast. , who will eat it again, it’s too late to lose weight! It's understandable if you say it once, but it's embarrassing if you repeat it several times. It fully reflects the stingy management of the petty Shanghainese and is not worthy of the standards of a five-star hotel. In addition, be sure not to go to the restaurant "Oriental Scenery" recommended by the hotel. There is no trace of one Michelin star. The environment in the private room is just like that of an ordinary restaurant, which may not be as good as that of an ordinary restaurant. The food is not as good as an ordinary public restaurant, and the service is not as good as an ordinary public restaurant. I don't know why it is rated One Michelin star, don’t blindly believe it in the future. I invited a few elderly people in their 70s, a total of 11 people, and spent 7,468 yuan, excluding drinks. The food they ordered was basically vegetarian and light. I didn’t order any big dishes. The amount of food was so big that even the elderly didn’t even eat it. Too deceiving. After this time, my impression of Teochew cuisine has been deducted. It seems that all the ridiculously expensive dishes are so-called high-end Teochew cuisine.

When I checked in, Xiaoyan saw that the room we booked couldn't be accommodated, so she helped communicate and changed to a more spacious room. She also added a single bed for free and gave the administrative fee As a member, you can enjoy free afternoon tea and dinner. Thank you very much. The concierge service is also very good.
It happened to rain on the first day, so I stayed in the hotel. There were views everywhere. It was a very well-established hotel. It was very close to Sinan Mansion and Fuxing Park. It was within walking distance. It was also very convenient to eat and drink around the hotel. It's in the old town. Many small shops are very down-to-earth. I would like to stay here next time I come.

msg:This time during the Shanghai parent-child trip, we specially checked in to Ruijin Hotel. The children liked it very much. They felt like a castle and the environment was very comfortable. I stayed in an executive room in the VIP building, which included breakfast for two adults and one child, afternoon tea and an executive buffet dinner in the evening. I arrived late that day and missed the afternoon tea. The very gentle lady at the front desk specially helped me make a note to enjoy it the next day. Because my brother is over 8 years old, the buffet dinner needs to be paid separately, but my brother’s buffet breakfast for the next day was given as a gift. , and also gave welcome fruits.
The next day, I had an appoin**ent with the Natural History Museum and rushed to the airport in the afternoon. The guy at the front desk also helped me make a note to delay check-out until 2 o'clock. After check-out, I had a buffet breakfast, participated in the hotel exploration with executive trea**ent, and visited the Centenary Tour. The architectural celebrity residences and presidential building are very historical, but the interiors are particularly well maintained.
Next time I have a chance to go to Shanghai, I will still choose Ruijin. The experience is particularly good.

msg:I don’t want to be crowded with people during the holidays and give up traveling. So I stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel Ruijin for one night with my mother. I liked the overall environment of the hotel very much, with old bungalow buildings and green trees. Many newlyweds hold wedding banquets here. The outdoors here is very suitable for a garden wedding💒
The room is large, clean and hygienic. There are holes in the balcony curtains. Afternoon tea was served in the executive lounge. The environment was comfortable and quiet, and the cakes tasted pretty good. Dinner was at the buffet. The food variety was average and the taste was okay. (Prefer the executive lounge of InterContinental Suzhou). Breakfast was ok.
The service attitude is very friendly, both at the front desk and in room service. They all treat guests with a smile and are very friendly. very good. I will still choose to stay here next time.

msg:The last stop of the holiday trip is to stay at Ruijin Hotel to bring the trip to a perfect end. The hotel seems to be in an English-style garden, with lawns, fountains, paths, corridors, and the Shanghai climate in October, which makes people forget to leave. The streets and alleys outside the hotel and the Sinan Mansion will remind people of the century-old history of this area. I highly recommend the Memorial Hall of Sun Yat-sen's Former Residence, not far from the hotel. The collection is small but exquisite. It is a great benefit to revisit this period of history.

It is very convenient to go to Huaihai Road, Hengshan Road, etc. The hotel's garden is particularly beautiful. It was the season when the osmanthus was fragrant when we went there. We were surrounded by the strong fragrance of osmanthus everywhere when we walked in the hotel, and I felt very happy. The British-style architecture is elegant and generous, giving it a sense of Downton Abbey. The executive room we stayed in was generously decorated with a small balcony and was very quiet. In particular, I want to talk about the hotel's executive benefits. You can enjoy afternoon tea on the terrace every day, with the beautiful garden below. During the happy hour in the evening, the hotel proudly invites guests on the executive floor to the buffet restaurant to enjoy a buffet with a variety of drinks, seafood, Chinese pastries and desserts, all of very high quality. We booked a tour of the hotel on the last day, and a young man enthusiastically took us to visit the Morris Residence, the presidential building where the British prince stayed during his visit to China, and let us know the history of the hotel. very interesting! We have stayed in many good hotels at home and abroad. The rich cultural a**osphere and beautiful landscape of Ruijin Intercontinental left a deep impression on us. We will be our first choice when visiting Shanghai in the future!

On rainy days, a car will be sent to another housing building, and the staff will wipe the raindrops on the seats with towels. Every hotel staff member smiles and says hello.
The hotel room design is very thoughtful and the hardware is top-notch. Clean and welcoming. This time I was given a side seat which was very quiet. I have to say, the bed was so good that I didn’t even want to get out of bed! The greenery of the hotel is perfect for outdoor strolling when the weather is sunny, and newlyweds getting married can be seen everywhere on the lawn. The location of the hotel is very good. Most of the restaurants you need to check in are nearby. Ruijin Hospital is just opposite. Wutong Road is beautiful. The room maintenance service in the middle of the night was also very fast and was solved in a timely manner.
I will still choose Ruijin InterContinental next time I come~

What is particularly worth mentioning is that the hotel software service is really good. What is particularly worth mentioning is the reception by Rita and Chris at the front desk, who are professional, warm and just right. They are really a great team, and I couldn’t help but write down their names and write a review to praise them. The characteristics of the room can be said to be low-key luxury, which is reflected in the details.

This time I chose the old hotel Ruijin Hotel
It is said to be the engagement place of Jiang Song
none of this matters
The important thing is that the environment of the whole hotel is really great
The entire park is very large, and every place is worth taking pictures.
In addition to the main building, there are also some small western-style buildings in the room
But because of the number of years, the facilities of the small western building will be slightly outdated
You can call and have a shuttle bus to pick you up when you have a meal.
Of course, the main building will save a lot of trouble
If you walk to Shaanxi South Road Subway Station, it’s relatively close from the west gate, and you can walk there in about 10 minutes.
It’s not too far anywhere, basically controlled within a range of about 4 kilometers
All in all, a very satisfying stay
The reception of the front desk 💁🏻 was very good after the room upgrade and late check-out
will come again

The driver couldn't find which building was the main building and had a hard time getting someone to answer the phone at the front desk. Our family booked a double bed. Because of the rain, we were asked to change to a room in the main building, but the main building only had twin beds. To be honest, the breakfast ordered was not worth it and the service was very average. In the morning, I wanted to dine with my children wearing slippers, but they were told that they were not allowed in. The explanation was not very good, and it was not fine-dining. I really didn’t understand this rule. Summer flip-flops and other items were not allowed in? Indians don’t give it either? After I changed my shoes and came back, the food was usually collected at 10 o'clock. At 9:37, I had just sat down and had not picked up the food. The waiter came over and asked me to eat as soon as possible. This way of reminding me was also very problematic. In short, I don’t recommend it, the experience is very bad!

When we checked in, no one paid attention to it. A young man at the front desk did not look up. The hotel lacks staff management and training. In addition, the hair dryer in the room is a copycat Dyson from the Guangdong factory, which is eye-opening.

msg:I have always had high expectations for InterContinental, so I chose to stay at Ruijin InterContinental for this business trip in Shanghai. The good environment and cultural a**osphere of Ruijin Intercontinental will not be repeated here. Focus on the service, especially the aspects that need to be improved:
1. The rooms are arranged in Building 3. When we arrived, we found that the rooms all started with 31 or 32. And our room is at the beginning of 30. It is really unfriendly for a person in his 70s to search for a room with luggage all over the building. Later, I called the front desk and told them to go up and down the stairs from the second floor to the first floor on the side. I think this is definitely not the first time this happened. When the receptionist of the hotel arranges this type of room, remind the guests as soon as possible, and this problem will be solved!
2. When I was having breakfast, I handed over the room to the waiter at the door for verification. My first feeling was that she handled it casually, and didn't even look up at me, let alone took the room card with both hands. Well, I can accept all of these (╯︵╰,) The waiter came over just after I was seated, and asked me which room I was in again? I told her very politely. The waiter who just brought the pre-dinner coffee I brought the equipment and asked me which room I was in. The key is that I was still with the customer. The customer thought that there was a problem with our reservation and had stopped to pick up the meal. He came to ask me what happened. It was really embarrassing😅
I hope that the two service suggestions I made can be seen by InterContinental, and I sincerely hope that they can help improve the service of InterContinental Ruijin! Compared with the external environment and hardware facilities, the improvement of internal service quality requires more effort!

When I got back to the room, I realized that the front desk didn't even say where the breakfast was, so I had to find out by myself. When I checked in, I told the front desk that I didn't want to live in the room at the end, and I replied that their rooms are all circular. In fact, they still have a structure similar to two rows, but some passages have only one room and some have multiple rooms, and the one given to me is actually the innermost one in this passage.
If you tell the truth that there is only this one room or that the room types I choose are all in this location, then there is no problem. But if you take advantage of the fact that the guests are not familiar with the layout of the hotel rooms and just perfunctory, the impression points are not good.
The breakfast is rich in variety and of good quality. It has its own bakery, and there is no problem with pastries.
At the same time, the public areas of the hotel are well-established. In other words, the experience of passing by for a stroll should be full marks
Hotel Unlimited My room is okay, but the other bedroom is completely disconnected

When I entered the house, I obviously needed to clean it up. It was very uncomfortable to live in. The public bathroom on the first floor was tidier than the room. Since the bath towels were placed under the sink pipe, they were dirty. There was a capsule coffee machine but no capsule coffee. What is the positioning of your home, 5 stars?

The eve of the three days and two nights of stay was the tenth anniversary of the hotel. In 2013, InterContinental took over Ruijin Hotel and continued the century-old legend of this hotel, which did not disappoint. The handsome manager Tang and the beautiful manager Yan in the lobby can meet the requirements of the guests very well. Manager Liang and Manager Lu in the restaurant depar**ent are meticulous and considerate for the guests from the perspective of the guests, and provide professional and personalized services. All these days are finally preserved in good memories.
Facilities: Although the facilities are ten years old, they are very well maintained and inherit the style of old Shanghai
Sanitation: The sanitation is very good. When I look at the sanitation of a hotel, I mainly look at its bathtub. The bathtub is very clean, which means that the waiters have been well trained and clean carefully.
Environment: The environment is that of a garden-style bungalow-style villa-type hotel, with small bridges and flowing water, shaded by trees, and the feeling of Taunton Gardens
Service: Service I gave 100 points this time, and wrote a thank you letter, as shown below

Birthday cakes, etc.; although the hotel has been built for nearly 10 years, the overall maintenance of the VIP building is relatively good.

The surrounding Sinan Mansion is within walking distance, and Xintiandi Tianzifang is not far away, but it is a little tiring to walk to the subway entrance in summer.

I went to the buffet and it was a pity that I didn't find anything delicious. The twin room is quite large, but the toilet in the bathroom is a bit too close to the shower room. The soundproofing of the room is not very good, but there is no big noise. Open the curtains and there is a long terrace outside. I don't know where to access the terrace, otherwise you can walk around. The pillows are very comfortable. I slept very well. I want to know what brand and model of pillows they are. Thanks

1. After entering the room, there is a basin of water in the washbasin in the bathroom, with a lot of hair floating on it, which looks like a beard, or nose hair, eyebrows, because they are very thick, and some are pointed. Thinking about it is extremely evil.
2. The silicone in the shower room, basin, and waterproof *****s of the basin in the bathroom is moldy and degummed. I don't understand why the hotel didn't pick up the moldy silica gel after three years of the epidemic.
3. The wall panels in the room are painted with white latex paint, and the facilities are relatively old.

The hotel's meals are also very good, and they are cooked with care. Because staying in the hotel was so comfortable, during the three days of the Dragon Boat Festival, apart from going to the Long Museum to attend an opening ceremony, eating, drinking and shopping in the hotel, and going to the gym to exercise and swim, I didn’t go anywhere else.

In addition, the main building where Jiang and Song were engaged cannot be visited, reservations cannot be made, and no one can help. The shuttle bus is drafty on all sides in the cold weather.

The transportation should be convenient, the environment should be elegant, you can take a walk in the morning, and you can digest food after a meal. After much deliberation, Ruijin was the only one. After all, it is an old-fashioned hotel. The service is professional and comfortable from the inside out, not the kind of exaggerated hospitality, but a natural home away from home. The room facilities are low-key luxury, the kind of tone that the old lady likes most😄

msg:2. Modern architectural classic garden history story type: Ruijin Intercontinental Hotel, a time-honored state guesthouse, is affiliated to Donghu Group and entrusted InterContinental to manage it in 2013. InterContinental Group entered Shanghai relatively early. The first InterContinental in China was the original New Asia Tomson InterContinental (later taken over by Jin Jiang). The major shareholder, New Asia Group, has a state-owned background. It can be seen that the relationship with the government has been harmonious for a long time. From the follow-up World Expo InterContinental, The National Convention and Exhibition Center InterContinental is the background of state-owned assets. Therefore, the management of Ruijin also agrees with each other. Among the high-end garden houses managed by state-owned assets in Shanghai in the early days, there were mainly four major groups "sharing", namely Donghu (suburbs: the western suburbs - construction businessman Yao Xizhou, Yao Naichi's villa - rebuilt 414 guest house after liberation, Chairman Mao went to Shanghai, Lived in Ruijin Hotel, Jinjiang Cultural Club and Xingguo Hotel. After the construction of 414 Guest House in 1960, Chairman Mao went to Shanghai 14 times from 1960 to 1967, and stayed in 414 Guest House every time. Dongjiao - Xinjian, Xingguo Radisson - The former site of the British merchant Taikoo foreign firm, now the old Dong’s house of the series of houses - The Opposite House - The Upper House - The Temple House - The Middle House, East Lake - Du Yuesheng, Lilac Garden - Li Hongzhang and Lilac, Hongqiao Guest House, are basically celebrities in the Republic of China period Former Residence Expansion), Jinjiang (Jinjiang Hotel, Cypress Hotel - Sassoon, Jing'an Hotel - Haiger Apar**ent) Hengshan (Hengshan - Picardy Apar**ent, Mahler Villa - Jewish Mahler,) New Asia Group has withdrawn from the hotel industry. The property was handed over to Jin Jiang for management.
Class 2 hotels are characterized by well-preserved historical buildings, exquisite gardens and large lawns, exotic designs, and legendary stories. In fact, there were many luxurious buildings in Shanghai during the Republic of China, but those with large gardens were rare. At present, these hotels are basically managed by state-owned assets. The Japanese garden Okura also belongs to this category. The original site of the French club was expanded, with a large lawn in front. The disadvantage of the eastern and western suburbs is that you have to drive if you want to eat a bowl of authentic scallion noodles. Parking can be a hassle. Hotel available on foot is the first choice. Now the oldest building is Building No. 2, just book the most basic business room. This is also a popular spot for wedding dresses. Surrounded by small roads suitable for walking, very emotional.

msg:The hotel with the worst service I have ever stayed in is still owned by the InterContinental Group. Hotels with the same price are several blocks away from it. The staff have no sense of service at all. I really don’t know how they are trained. It’s also my fault that I believed the deception on Xiaohongshu and booked other hotels. Because of the change of the itinerary, I went to Shanghai in advance and decided to experience this hotel with a long history. The environment is okay, but the celebrity mansion can’t get in I can't visit it. The breakfast and afternoon tea are very average. It's hard to say. I can understand this, but it's a bit too much if it can't even meet the service of a three- or four-star hotel. It's more appropriate to call it Ruijin Hotel. It's really that kind It feels like an old-fashioned guest house. No one helps with the luggage. The room service asks to deliver a bottle of mineral water to the room. The waiting time is too long, and it needs to be urged several times before it can be delivered. I have never encountered such a situation. If you rely on reminders, don't expect other services, there is no service at all. Needless to say, staying in other hotels, the staff will consider the details, staying in Ruijin is useless even if you say it, their work status is just indifferent to perfunctory, if it is not because of the historical buildings and cultural background, how many people would choose to live in you As for the hotel, they don't care about the guests, they don't pay attention to the service, they continue to rely on publicity and photo deception, and keep living on their laurels

Xiao Xing’s service was good, and he personally took me to the room in the VIP building after I was satisfied. I just left. The location is okay, but the area of 40 square meters is not big enough. On the second night, I changed to a suite with a large yard on the first floor of the VIP building. The beautiful lady at the front desk, Xiao Xu, has a very good attitude and adheres to the service concept of patience, meticulousness and enthusiasm. Thank you very much, I have a very favorite accommodation 👍 I spent three days and two nights in the hotel happily 😄 Booked an executive room to enjoy Club InterContinental privileges. In the VIP Club on the first floor of the VIP building, afternoon tea is served ☕️ Western-style dessert cakes Coffee, fruit and soft drinks, good service for both boys and girls 👌 During happy hours, you can go to the Langlu Western Restaurant in the main building to have a buffet dinner. With the buffet dinner purchased at 299, you can eat whatever you want, except for the little blue dragon. Breakfast is also available What impresses me the most here is that the lady who cuts the big pieces of beef speaks amiably and provides good service👍The service of the little Hu in the linen room on the VIP floor of the hotel is also good. The gym and swimming pool are all on the B1 floor of the VIP building.

1. The bathtub is recommended to be equipped with a disposable bath plastic cover. At that time, a master was sent to clean and disinfect, which was time-consuming and laborious, and it was inconvenient to be disturbed
2. Calling the duty manager is often not answered
The cleaning aunt often makes some small mistakes, such as sending things to the wrong room

Surprise:
1. It is worthy of being called Monet's Garden.

For the convenience of travel, we booked the InterContinental Hotel in Huangpu District. The overall environment is like a private villa, with European-style buildings and manicured lawns. Tourists can also visit at will, and the guiding staff are very polite. The weekend was packed and we even witnessed a lawn wedding.

The front desk upgraded the room type for us for free. After the upgrade, the bathroom of the executive room is bigger than my bedroom. I love the bathtub and crystal lamp. The night light at the head of the bed still retains the rotary button element, revealing the charm of old Shanghai.

"Monet's Little Garden" is the place where the Internet celebrity checks in. It is the place where people feel the most gap in the whole hotel. It is really small and belongs to the corner that will be overlooked if you take two steps quickly. I came here for the online map and felt photographed. deceived.

If you want to travel conveniently and experience the story of old Shanghai, Ruijin InterContinental is really a good choice.

The breakfast is also good and the service is also very good. The only regret is the afternoon tea included in the check-in package. The dim sum is quite exquisite, but there is no spoon or fork, and there is a layer of cream on the outside of the dim sum, which is a bit embarrassing for us to grab with our hands. I asked the waiter and clearly told me that there is no equipment. There is another embarrassing thing. I swiped my card to enter the Celebrity Garden, and a security guard suddenly came out to drive us away and told him that we were hotel guests. It's a bit embarrassing to be booked out

msg:Ruijin in spring is very beautiful, you must take the time to enjoy it.
Service: Checked in on Friday afternoon. The hotel was so busy that the hotel was full. I saw an elderly person staying with me. Ms. RITA at the front desk was helpful in arranging a garden-view room with a balcony. She also took the initiative to ask if she needed to help arrange toiletries , the whole check-in process was very smooth and pleasant.
Meals: Dinner is a buffet in Langlu, with a wide variety of dishes and fresh ingredients. Breakfast is both Chinese and Western, with good taste.
Guest room: Staying in the guest room in the VIP building, the elevator and the equipment of the guest room are well maintained, and the balcony room for the elderly has a panoramic view of the spring-filled garden.
This is a very pleasant stay experience, and I will bring my family to enjoy it again in the future.

The hotel is like a small park, full of spring a**osphere and profound history. The background is suitable for all kinds of photography.
I would like to praise Rita at the front desk. Knowing that we have an executive room with a small balcony for our birthday, the view from the window is really good, and the girl is very happy.
I also praised the sales of Flora, and took us to find a suitable banquet hall. Knowing that the children celebrated their birthdays, they added fried noodles for us. Backflow wine, overall very good, a perfect birthday party! ! !

I was told to come back and get it in 30 minutes. I would come and ask the front desk after dinner in an hour. What happened if the staff changed? I don’t know, I don’t have a room card. After waiting for a long time, I found a girl who was the original receptionist. Her attitude was very good, but the room card was still not renewed, and the room that was asked to be cleaned was not cleaned. When I went out in the afternoon, I told her again that I would give her the room. After cleaning, I still said yes with a smile. When I went back in the evening, the room was still not cleaned. When I extended my stay the next day, it was still not cleaned. After staying for three days, I asked the front desk to clean the room every day before leaving at noon. If it was not cleaned, the room was not replenished. and paper towels, very poor service

Don’t mention the location when you take a photo, most of your circle of friends will ask you how you got to the UK. The hotel has a strong British country club style, I guess it is the only one in the country, because it must be equipped with a large lawn, and it was originally a private residence of a wealthy British businessman. The materials and colors of the exterior walls are all West London style. It is not a problem that plagiarism can solve. The hotel gives a free upgrade to the VIP building, the room is very large. Although it is a weekday, there are many guests. It is conceivable that weddings are often held on weekends, and it is so lively. (There is a battery car to pick up and drop off between buildings, so it will save effort if you have a lot of luggage)

The room service is also very fast. Breakfast can be served until 10:30, and basically you don’t need to eat lunch. The whole hotel is very green, and you can see several meows. The feeling of so much greenery in the city center can only be compared in the western suburbs. But the location is still convenient here, it is more convenient to walk to Huanmao and so on.

When I came to Shanghai this time, the weather was very good, the environment inside the hotel is great, the green area is large, it is very pleasant to walk around and bask in the sun. The concierge has a battery car to connect the room to the gate. The hotel staff are warm and courteous. The breakfast in the restaurant is rich in styles, and I am very satisfied. The fly in the oin**ent: 1. The check-in speed is relatively slow. After arriving at the store, you have to check in first. You have to wait for more than two hours before you can check in. It is full of rooms during the Spring Festival holiday, so it is understandable that the room cannot be cleaned. 2. The carpet in the room is not clean enough, some areas are obviously dusty, there are rolled up dust particles, the surface of the coffee machine is dusty, and the corners of some furniture are dusty. It really shouldn't be for this level of hotel. I hope to strengthen the guest room Hygienic cleaning of details. The flaws are not hidden, the warm and thoughtful service of Ruijin InterContinental, the beautiful environment, and the superior geographical location will still be the reasons for me to choose it firmly.

Passing by here many years ago, I was deeply impressed by the heavily guarded villa buildings in the city center, feeling tall and mysterious. Today I can finally go in and live here, which is indeed a bonus of the times!
The room is small and the facilities are slightly old. The service can be regarded as five-star, and the training and management of InterContinental Hotel should still be ok. The 50,000-square-meter garden is probably unique among the star-rated hotels in the urban area, not to mention several buildings in the Art Deco style with their own histories.
It would be better if the hotel can provide a more detailed introduction to the history of the hotel and open some buildings to allow guests to visit inside.

Every day at 2:30 in the afternoon, you can make an appoin**ent to visit and explain. If you want to see the celebrity mansion, you must make an offer, but you can’t get in by yourself. The aunt who cleans the room is very polite and enthusiastic, responsive and fast, must praise 👍 The Chinese food in Xinyuan Building tastes good, as long as the environment is quiet and good, the price is not expensive, but early reservations are required, as there are not many tables. There is nothing wrong with the buffet. Relatively speaking, Chinese dim sum dishes are much more delicious than Western ones. The West Point in Ruijin really needs to be improved! I originally wanted to go swimming with my swimsuit on, but after looking at it, the door to the outdoors of the swimming pool is actually ajar. In this weather, think about it or forget it, don’t get stuck in the cold. Generally speaking, the service environment is worth revisiting, but the details still need to be improved.

The style of the executive lounge is very pleasing, and the food quality is also good. I have experienced both afternoon tea and happy hour. Let me talk about the dissatisfaction. First, the service is very average. The staff will not take the initiative to say hello when they pass by. Later, I found a detail. I met this foreigner many times during the two days of staying. It should be the hotel management, and he would not take the initiative Greet guests, so what more could the staff below ask for. Second, the standard of breakfast is average and low. I just stayed at Nanjing Shangri-La a few days ago. The quality of this hotel is several roads away from Ruijin InterContinental. I don’t think anyone in the management team of InterContinental is willing to admit that they are inferior to Shangri-La. Third, you must go to the main building to check-in the executive room. The epidemic has been over for more than a month, so don't use the epidemic as an excuse. Fourth, the gym is definitely a third-party, which does not meet the standards of a five-star hotel at all. It's the first time to stay at the InterContinental brand, or is my expectation too high? After all, I was very satisfied to live in Pudong Regent, which is also owned by IHG, in July last year.

This is the essence of visiting Shanghai. Food, coffee, bars, and business districts They are all within easy reach, and can be reached by bike or on foot.
InterContinental's brand is the guarantee of service and hardware. The overall decoration is very old money. It doesn't seem exaggerated but it is very easy to use. It has a sense of history and is a kind of precipitated luxury! IHG bedding is invincible, and you can always sleep well.

Thanks to the lady in the hotel reservation depar**ent and Ms. Ni at the front desk for providing us with a hearty breakfast for the elderly. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and professional, the rooms are clean and sanitary, and the food and beverages are very good The breakfast and dinner are very delicious. The combination of Chinese and Western grasses and ancient trees in the hotel building is amazing. The heated swimming pool and the jacuzzi after swimming are very enjoyable! !

msg:I am very grateful to the young lady for giving me a free upgrade to the VIP building, but I just want to say that I can’t even live in the VIP building for the price I paid, and I feel that it’s too bad. It can only be said that no one opened the door for me to help me with my luggage during the whole process. The hotel is well maintained but the facilities are all from 2000. Anyway, the TV is broken. I don’t watch TV so forget it. It hasn’t been updated since it opened.
I asked for a toothbrush, and when I came to clean it the next day, I threw it away and didn’t give me a replacement. I ordered another one at night, but no one delivered it after waiting for almost half an hour. I made two phone calls just arrived. It’s okay if the facilities are old, and the service can’t keep up. When I go out and ask for a mask, I still have to ask which room I’m in. Now if I want a mask, I have to ask where I live?
When checking out, it said that you have to go to the main building to check out if you need to issue an invoice, and you have to go to the main building far away to check out. If the guest is in a hurry, it is really inconvenient. The experience is really bad, and the service facilities are completely inferior to the price and the five-star standard of InterContinental. If it is not because it is convenient to live in Ruijin Hospital for medical trea**ent, I will definitely not live again in the future.

I didn't expect the front desk to give me a cold shoulder. The attitude of the front desk was the same before. I don't care about Gong Wei. The attitude of other people is fine.

msg:The worst Intercontinental hotel ever, the service quality is not high. The driver of the battery car is lazy and does not help the guests with their luggage. After the guests have finished taking the two pieces of luggage by themselves, they symbolically hand over the last plastic bag to you. Check out to ask for a battery car, wait for ten minutes and nothing happens. The buffet service is not standardized and the waiters are not honest enough. Buffet ingredients are average. After getting out of the elevator in Building 3, the first thing you see is an open storage room, which is full of sanitary products. It's not like a hotel that entertains guests. It really doesn't treat guests as outsiders and shows you the inside of the house first.

msg:Ruijin is very old, and he has been worrying about whether to go, thinking that Intercontinental should be reliable, and the garden must be beautiful, so he booked a suite. There is no problem with hygiene, after all, the big brand five-star, the indoor environment, Building 2 and 3 is an old building, the bedroom of the suite in Building 2 actually has a dormer window, you can't see out of the window when you stand up, and the feeling of the ba*****t is overwhelming! Changed to the third building, the room was normal, the window was like ruins, and it had nothing to do with the courtyard lawn! Finally, I switched to the themed suite in the main building, the curtains could not be drawn to the end, and I was woken up early in the morning on weekends! Really crash! In short, it is the most problematic time to live in Shanghai in recent years! I think the main reason is the wrong choice, so it is better to walk in and not live in such a beautiful garden!

I live in the executive room of the VIP building, and I take a battery car to and from the main building. I like the environment of the whole hotel very much, the service is just so-so, there is no staff in the lobby of the VIP building at night, and there are long queues for check-in and check-out. However, it is worth staying for the retro style.

It is located on Ruijin 2nd Road, adjacent to the Huaihai Road business district and many tourist attractions in the city, and it is within walking distance to Tianzifang; Metro Line 10 can go directly to Hongqiao International Exhibition Center; the main traffic road The north-south and Yan'an Road viaducts run through the nearby blocks and the Pudong Lujiazui Economic and Financial Center. The design of the hotel is noble and elegant. It has a British classical garden villa and an expansive garden lawn in the center of the city. It is quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle. The engagement place of Chiang Kai-shek and Song Meiling has a profound historical and cultural heritage. Every building and every landscape in the hotel contains precious and unforgettable historical memories. It is an artistic example of the perfect fusion of traditional style and modern elements. The room is designed with care and uniqueness. There are rich meals. The hotel has Langlu all-day dining restaurant and Xinyuanlou Chinese restaurant, as well as lobby lounge and executive lounge, which can satisfy guests' dining and leisure. The fitness center of the hotel is equipped with scientific fitness facilities and equipment. The swimming pool leads directly to the sunken garden and artificial waterfall, which is a good choice for leisure. The original ecological lawn, the housekeeping depar**ent and the front office are warm and thoughtful, and the details are reflected in every detail. Coincidentally, on the birthday of the child, I specially sent a surprise trip, fruit, flowers, cakes, and scene arrangements, which were full of emotion. The garden landscape is also very stylish, so that the tiredness and hustle and bustle of the day can be calmed down.

msg:The external environment of the hotel is very good, the garden is very large, and it feels like a manor. It was 2:30 when I checked in, and I hadn't planned the room yet. I complained, and the front desk clerk reluctantly gave the room that had been prepared in the main building, saying that the room was one level higher than the one I booked. I came out alone with my child, dragging a big suitcase, and it was almost three o'clock, and there was no room. Would you be so embarrassing to let us sit and wait until we don't know when? Give me a room first is the proper service. You are an Intercontinental brand, so this is the kind of service that makes sense. The attitude of the staff at the front desk is also average, mainly because they speak very fast, they are not humble and patient enough, they feel like they are in a hurry, and they do not feel enthusiastic. The room is a little old, and the decoration style is also very old. I ordered to eat in the room, and the lady who answered the phone told me that there would be a charge. I know this, right? Asked for the bread to be served with salted butter, she didn't know what salted butter was, put down the phone and went to the kitchen bro, then came back and said the hotel didn't have salted butter because it was imported. In the end it came in a saucer that was squeezed into a flower and felt a little more creamy, without the taste of butter. If it weren't for the rescue of the garden-like external structure, it is estimated that there is no reason to live here.

msg:Have you ever experienced living in a renovation site? It is recommended to turn on the sound and watch the video first.

1. When checking in, the front desk said that the executive floor had been upgraded, but there would be a little noise during the day during the renovation. ——The front desk said it in an understatement, and I didn’t care about it since I checked in at night. Looking back now, why did they bother to “upgrade” me.

2. The decoration started at 9 o'clock the next day and it was noisy. I wanted to go out earlier, so I just tolerated it.

3. On the third day, the noise started at 9 o'clock and lasted until I checked out at around 11 o'clock. I couldn't bear it anymore, so I took this video.

4. In fact, I called the manager on duty at 10 o'clock, and the reply I got was: "It's past ten o'clock now." I said it was still noisy, so he said to negotiate. ——After the phone call, the sound of the renovation didn't stop. I'm a hotel guest, and it's Sunday. If there's such a serious decoration sound like drilling into the wall, I shouldn't be arranging guests to check in! This has nothing to do with what time it is!

5. When checking out, it was reported that it was very noisy for two consecutive days. The reply from the front desk was: "We will finish the renovation at the end of the month. I hope you will come to stay again next time. Please be merciful to Ctrip's score and give it more than 8 points."— —I was really speechless after listening, so I stopped talking, checked out and left.

6. With such noise and the service I received, it is unbelievable that I live in an Intercontinental!

Both the service and the hardware are comfortable and just right. Not to mention the location of the hotel, the scenery in the park has improved the price/performance ratio by several levels. Two very tall magnolia trees bloomed one after another in the garden, exuding the breath of spring. Room service was also good, my IPAD landed here and they called me the same day. It is also worth mentioning that the restaurant in the hotel - Songjian has a beautiful environment and good taste. It's a good place for girlfriends to get together. Love it, will stay here again😊

Although the hotel room is a bit old, the hotel service is very attentive, and the InterContinental member also gave four drinks. In the hotel, there are executive suites in the main building and the VIP building open to guests, and the rest of the villas are quite interesting, giving people a feeling of pretending to be in Europe. Many of them are rented out to the outside world. One of the villas, which is filled with flowers suitable for Chinese New Year's Eve, is quite fireworks. The uncle who cleaned the house said the rent was 80,000 yuan. The hotel swimming pool is 1.3m-1.9m, which is not common in hotels. The buffet breakfast is also rich, smoked salmon and salami are good. The buffet lunch is rated at 180, and many elderly people come to eat in groups. Satisfied with seniors and kids alike, definitely recommend!

The food is not bad, but compared to other Intercontinental or 5 stars, it's just average!
We live in the third building, the bath water is hot and cold, and the water flow is still small, a little disappointed. In view of the old hotel, we choose to understand and forgive.
The room package includes afternoon tea. We saw that there was afternoon tea in the main building, so we went in. We were told that it was in the VIP building, so we walked over, but they said that our package was not in the VIP building, but in the main building. Went to the original tea restaurant, and then the tea restaurant insisted that our set menu was not there, it was in the VIP building! A little pissed off! ...Fortunately, someone who understands came and took us to another place in the main building for afternoon tea. Such a fact should not happen in a five-star hotel...

There are also breakfast, afternoon tea, happy hour trea**ent, value for money. Just to go to the gym and swimming pool have to go to the VIP building, it is a little inconvenient when it rains. The breakfast and dinner buffets have a lot of choices. Personally, what I feel is that the choice of ingredients is changed, and the taste is also very general, which is somewhat different from the international five-star standard.

This is really the best InterContinental I have stayed in. It is not a hotel with a river view in the ordinary sense, but a remodeled old house. It is of historical significance, and the environment is also very good. I booked the package in advance, which includes an English afternoon tea and two breakfasts. When I checked in, the young lady at the front desk also helped us to upgrade to the VIP building~ because it was recently approaching my boyfriend’s birthday, the hotel also gave a piece of cake (this cake is really delicious!)
In the evening, go for a walk. The scenery here is really good. I have rarely stayed in a hotel with such a good ecological environment. The photos are also very good! The room is very large, the decoration is also a style I like very much, and we also sent us welcome fruits. The room is on the first floor, open the door to go out to a small balcony, it is also very comfortable to sit and drink tea at night.
Breakfast is until 10 o'clock, the environment is very good, and there are many varieties. All in all, this is really a very good hotel, strongly recommended!

As soon as you drive into the hotel, the security staff will come forward to take the temperature measurement and show the health code. They are meticulous about the epidemic prevention requirements. After a simple inspection, you will stop the car and go to the main building lobby to check in. The fragrance in the lobby is slightly high-end.
After entering the door, the concierge will take the initiative to say hello and will guide the check-in guests to the front desk to line up. Stanly, the male receptionist at the front desk, had a warm and friendly attitude. He first apologized for our waiting in line, and then arranged for someone to decorate the room and gave a birthday cake after learning that we took our daughter for her birthday. Finally, he took the initiative to inform the operation time and location of some infrastructure.
    After the child checked out, he left his favorite toy in the hotel room. On the day of check out, the hotel staff contacted us and told us to send it by express.
In this garden villa hotel, a group of busy young people contribute to the InterContinental brand, which has kept the InterContinental brand alive. I will definitely recommend this hotel when my friends come to Shanghai in the future!

It seems that it was built by the British before, and it happened that the child just finished enrolling in the kindergarten opened with the British.
The room facilities are indeed a bit old and slightly soiled, but apart from the visual effects, it does not affect the use. The old houses in Shanghai can be seen from the terrace, and the wind is quite comfortable.
The restaurant is very nice. The decoration is really not just a lot of colors and elements. Black wooden frame, dark table and chairs, very elegant. And the breakfast is very good with many kinds. This is better than the intercontinental level of many places in the big city. Xiao Long Bao is good, two months old, I hope I remember correctly. It should be the Xiaolong of Shanghai Intercontinental.
Service is a bit average. I called for a toothbrush for a long time and no one sent it.
Overall it's ok. It's also convenient to go out. You can walk to many places in 10 minutes by subway.

The service is good, knowing that it is our wedding anniversary, we specially set up light signs and gave small cakes. It is highly recommended to friends who travel to Shanghai. The location is very good and you can experience the nightlife of Shanghai at night. Quiet in the noisy, suitable for couples to take pictures and punch cards.

The room is relatively large, and the suite has two bathrooms, the main bathroom and the guest bathroom. An extra bed was added by the window in the hall, which didn't matter. Lie flat holiday, four meals a day are settled in Langlu. The front desk, lobby bar, and restaurant services are all available. The meticulousness and style of old-brand hotels are always online.

The hotel environment is superb, like a small manor, it is easy to stroll around, the a**osphere is full of history, and there are many mosquitoes in the yard, sooner or later. You can visit the surrounding old streets and feel the life of the locals. On the day of check-in, I met several couples who held lawn weddings in the garden. Breakfast is not a lot, but the service is better. The only thing I'm not very satisfied with is that there is an unknown hair on the toilet, which needs to be improved.

There are several weddings in the hotel during the holidays to neglect individual guests. Building No. 3 is a dirty building on the corner of the hotel and there is no view to see. It cannot be ruled out that the front desk deliberately arranged this kind of unsold room to us, which is very bad behavior. It is recommended that Ctrip lower the ranking and exposure rate of the hotel and cancel the boss recommendation.

A strong musty smell as soon as the door is opened! Even the armrests on the chairs in the room are tattered, rotten and moldy! Then call to the main station to negotiate, to exchange for the new building we booked! The front desk is very awkward, the new building is full and we only have this kind of room!

滑雪場的娛樂區工作日沒什麼人，體驗感拉滿，幾乎包場非常爽。

第二，入住和退房有幸都是同一位又美又善良的前台小姑娘，入住時看我們拖家帶口人高馬大、在確認我們不介意住新樓之後迅速協調升級到主樓更大的房間，退房時見有位大哥很順滑的插隊到我前面、小姑娘又很禮貌淡定的提醒大哥重新排隊讓我先辦理。謝謝你～為啥我就沒反應過來留意姓名牌呢，太應該實名點贊～
第三，酒店內部設計很合理，空間動線流暢，隔音效果很好，入住體驗很舒適～
第四，早飯好豐盛，中西結合，大人小孩都吃的好滿足，每天都能有個幸福的開頭～
總之，如果滿分5分，我們打12分～

行政酒廊裝飾復古，第一天就遇見了那位年長些的大叔，頓感喝茶太有儀式感了！非常喜歡下午茶那款特色甜點：香軟誘人一品難忘，少了許甜膩、多了份椰香！酒廊為客人用心的傑作！
特別感謝行政酒廊的工作人員，不怕麻煩替客人解決在外住店的一些不便。因上海朋友給的粽子需冷藏保存，酒廊陸副經理親自安排，非常認真，幾位漂亮的小姐姐也跟着幫忙，讓我感動、心暖！
酒店有這麼好的環境、這麼負責高效的工作團隊，口碑會越來越好、生意也會越來越好！

洲際的服務是不錯的，尤其是早餐很豐盛，吃了三天也沒有吃膩。
第一晚在房間門口看到了一衹大大的小強，反饋後馬上做了處理，後面再也沒有這個問題了。
最後提一點，3號樓的枕芯建議更換一下，晚上睡覺會有比較明顯的味道。

msg:隱匿在繁華的市中心，低調的靜卧在高樓林立之下，古樸的民國風，每個草坪，每幢建築都會幻化成膠片中定格的美景。感覺時間一下子就慢下來了。老建築的特點就是很多設施都會出現一些小小的故障，需要酒店投入大量的精力和資金去維護，並且對於我這個第一次住店的人來説，搞不清楚，到底在哪個樓裏辦入住，如果指示牌上能做個明確提示就好了，雖然兜兜轉轉了一下，逛這個大花園心情還是很好的，瑕不掩瑜。整體還是非常好的
但説實在的……晚上的自助餐，相比同類檔次的酒店，要遜色很多。

其實瑞金的腔調加上洲際的服務水準，個人認為是上海老房子酒店裡面最不出錯和穩妥的選擇，即能完美表現老上海格調，又有國際標準酒店服務和供應的水準，雖然房間格局偏老，但是好在不會出錯，真的每次都是很好的體驗
另外早餐的品種也是洲際水準，西點和中式海派點心出品都有保證，下次到上海大概率還是這裡。

特別值得一體的是，第二天我們需要乘車去醫院檢查但我們無法在高峯期叫到車，當值的禮賓部一位帥哥用自己的手機幫助我們叫了滴滴待我們回來後再付的款。這是我第一次帶父母入住洲際，他們全程都感覺舒適，是五星的洲際。

做為十幾年的老客户，温馨建議：酒店配一台掛式熨燙機，衣服在你們酒店用你們的熨斗把禮服燙焦兩次了，如果經費實在㧗不了，我們願意贊助。衹為了能給出差的客人提供方便。

這樣的環境，歷史，人文，不説服務，硬軟件要多好，衹要不犯錯，都是給酒店更加分的。尤其是早餐，非常值得稱讚，不僅品種齊全，色香味俱全，細節也考慮到位，比如咖啡區，牛奶有熱牛奶，冷牛奶，冷牛奶還分了脱脂奶和全脂奶，對我來説，美式加脱脂奶是每天的標配，住了這麼多酒店，吃了這麼多早餐，這應該是為數不多能在牛奶品種上都用心的酒店！非常值得肯定！

整個給人一種説不出的突兀之感！尤其令我失望的是自助早餐，上午早餐營業時間還未結束，就要服務員
不停的在你身邊周圍發出很響的收拾碗和盆子的嘈雜聲音，簡直無法安靜的早餐，一點沒有帶着歷史感的
古典有特色的一棟棟樓房而相匹配的優質令人愉悦的
服務。
