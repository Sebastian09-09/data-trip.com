The breakfast buffet is best so far, lots of variety and tasty. Quick respond  we needed to check out and requested for help to send down our luggage. The front office manager helped me get a taxi to go PEK airport in the evening.

About 1 hour drive from Beijing Daxing International Airport without any traffic congestion. But one thing I don’t like is if you order any food delivery , you will have to leave your room & go to the lobby collect it yourself, instead of having one of the staff send it up to you.

msg:The hotel is in a great location with metro stops nearby. The hotel room itself was big and roomy, very clean and quiet. There are a couple of things, however, that would prevent me from returning and probably wouldn’t recommend to my friends. First, the bed is far too firm. I am from the UK and like to sleep on a cloud but even my Chinese boyfriend suffered from backache with this bed. Second, the swimming pool was way too cold to truly enjoy. Third, I found the light controls in the bedroom too minimal. It was either too bright, or too dark, no cosy in between - but I know this is small and just a personal ******.

The location was excellent, only a short walk from the Temple of Heaven, and a quick didi to just about anywhere in the city center. It’s also close to a number of metro stations! We wound up taking the yellow line to Universal one day and it couldn’t have been easier. The front desk staff was exceptional, helping us understand our paperwork, being kind and understanding when our flight was majorly delayed, and helping us with dinner reservations! The room itself was lovely, very clean and spacious, and surprisingly quiet for being in such a busy area. Breakfast was delicious too! I am completely happy with my stay here and would absolutely recommend it to others!

This in turn resulted in a free buffet dinner at their restaurant or a 400RMB voucher for their rooftop bar, we went for the food option. The food was ok, we booked in for 8pm and some of the dishes were gone, a nice selection between western and Chinese dishes and the desserts are great! The breakfast in the morning was better than the dinner, healthy snacks, fresh fruit and yoghurt… aswell as your English fry up among others. Refused entry to the pool due to no swim hats. Service was great, attentive staff willing to help whenever necessary.

Environment: I stayed in the executive lounge for a long time this time. It was very comfortable, with complete facilities and a great view outside the window. The most surprising thing was that the lounge was connected to a large terrace. It was very pleasant to sit outside in the cool breeze at night. But the only drawback was that the "happy hour" meals in the lounge were relatively simple. I hope they can be improved to be more worthy of such a comfortable lounge.

We were on the 6th and 7th floors, and the price was probably more than 1,200, and it was only equipped with a four-star room (the room was renovated and the cabinet smelled, the faucet shower was broken, and the water output was not as good as the shower head in a third- or fourth-tier small city! The room environment is more business-like. It's just so-so. I ordered a double bed and changed it to a king-size bed! Because the double bed is very small, and there are very few 1.1-meter beds now. Secondly, breakfast: So-so, the variety and quality are all business-type, and the point is that the waiter is more friendly when seeing foreign friends! Not only lead the way, but also introduce and help carry chairs! ! The Chinese are a little nicer to us at the door guard 😂😂 Personal feeling (for foreign friends and Chinese civilians Don't treat it as such. Maybe it's because I'm busy. So I didn't take it into consideration. ) Everything is normal, but there are no details. There is no courtesy service, and no caring greetings before check-in. Compared with other price hotels, there are basically room courtesies. Or call to ask if there is anything that needs to be arranged in advance by the guest room, or children's parent-child supplies. There is absolutely nothing here, and we didn't provide children's supplies and slippers when we brought children. In short. This price is just for the location, which is about 40 minutes' walk from Tiananmen Square. If you need a very close distance, you can refer to other options. I don't even want to take pictures 🙂↔️

In addition to not treating people as human beings, the service attitude is pretty good. They provide a fan when it's hot, and use the restaurant to store food when the refrigerator is broken. Everything else is okay.
The hotel's location is neither in front of Wangfujing nor in the back of the Temple of Heaven. You have to take a taxi everywhere, which is inconvenient.
Five-star hotel, fast experience.

msg:The hotel upgraded me to a suite, with the bedroom and lobby separated. Although the hotel is 11 years old, it has been well maintained and is still very new and clean. The big bed is big enough for a family of three. Below the hotel are Ziguangyuan, Starbucks, McDonald's and Fangzhuang Factory. About 7-8 minutes' walk away, there is New World Depar**ent Store, and there is Red Star Bakery and Chongwenmen Subway Station. The transportation is convenient. If you take a taxi, you can get off at the door. On the return trip, Didi took a taxi back to the Capital Airport for about 80 RMB, and on the outbound trip, a taxi from Daxing Airport cost 170 RMB.

The floors are not high, there is no sense of oppression, and you can feel a little bit relaxed like staying in a resort.
The room was comfortable and the food delivery service was very fast and attentive.
Recommend the egg rolls for breakfast, warm and delicious.
When there is a discount, I really want to book a few nights and stay here again. 🤓

Due to the sudden heavy snowfall in Beijing, the front desk girl helped me solve the problem of buying snow boots (it was already 11 o'clock at night). I was anxious for the first time. The next morning I took my baby to the Forbidden City because I was afraid of falling. I really appreciate the girls helping me solve my urgent problem. It also allowed me to enjoy the snowy scenery of Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. It was really beautiful. The room was very large and comfortable, and we got a free upgrade. The soundproofing was very good, and the air conditioning was powerful. I ordered a breakfast and got free breakfast for my children (stayed for three nights). I called before checking in to ask for check-in requirements. All in all, this trip to Beijing I am very satisfied. I decided to stay at New World Hotel after searching online for a long time. The transportation is convenient and it is convenient to go anywhere. My son said that he will stay at New World Hotel next time he goes to Beijing. Thank you for your service!

Later, I saw that there was a sofa in this room, so I asked the hotel for a few more pillows, and filled the sofa with pillows next to the bed. The baby slept on it all night and found it fun and slept well. The breakfast is also very rich and has many categories. The front desk service was very good. Seeing that we had a baby, they allowed us to delay check-out until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. And it’s really close to the Tiananmen Forbidden City, so you can walk there. I really recommend this hotel (òωó)👍 when you come to Tiananmen Palace and the National Expo.

As a star-rated hotel, it is also an old brand, so it should not make such low-level mistakes! I accidentally left a facial cleanser. After checking out, no one called me to ask. I didn’t realize it was left until I took a shower at 10:30 pm. I called the hotel to ask, and the front desk said to ask, and then replied that it was left! I want to ask if I don’t call back, will the hotel really be like this? The point is that this bottle of facial cleanser is new at a glance, and it’s not that it’s about to run out. Maybe the room attendant will think it’s unwanted! This made me feel insecure all of a sudden! This is the first time I’ve encountered such a hotel!

When I made the reservation, I was worried that it would be outdated a few years after it opened, but it actually felt very new. Special thanks for the upgrade to the executive room on the 10th floor. The room is large enough and the layout is very reasonable. With the twin beds put together and the sofa, a family of four can sleep very comfortably. The hotel service, concierge, and cleaning are all very good, and the breakfast is also good. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the Temple of Heaven, Tiananmen, Forbidden City, and National Museum. In order to save energy, I used Didi, which is easy to hail a taxi. There are Ziguang Garden, Square Brick, and Shabu Shabu in the surrounding area, which is convenient for eating. Very satisfied with my stay! recommend!

The room was very big and the facilities were very good. It was so big that I didn't dare to go to the toilet at night. The bathtub is also big and there are sinks on both sides. I like that the toothbrush and toothpaste are packaged separately. If you stay for a few days, you don’t have to waste toothbrushes all the time. Very few hotels have this, which is great.
Tried breakfast, residents have a half-price discount, and there are many choices. There are also hotpots for lunch and dinner, which is very convenient.
It is quite close to the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven. Other attractions such as the Lama Temple only take 30 minutes. Because there are traffic jams in Beijing, you need to allow time for travel.
A little bad thing is that takeout can only be placed in the takeout cabinet below. You can go down and get it yourself, but you can't have it delivered. The water is not bottled. There is no lid to cover it when it is opened, or it can be poured into a cup to drink.

msg:The location is very good, there are many restaurants nearby, and it is convenient to go anywhere! I'm very satisfied. I was given an upgrade after I arrived late. The room is very large, 60 square meters, which is very affordable in Beijing. The design is simple and elegant, and it is clean. The partitions are obvious. There is a cloakroom, which is convenient for luggage. The shower gel and shampoo are also provided. Not bad, very comfortable, and also has speakers! The supporting facilities are also very complete. You don’t need to go out at night, just have fun and exercise in the hotel. The spa is very comfortable. Dianping can charge more than 400 for one time. There is also a gym, swimming pool, and a bar on the 12th floor. The bar is very quiet and has a comfortable terrace. There are also heating lamps. There are few people and the cost is not high. It is very suitable for chatting and relaxing. The only dissatisfaction is that wif is too slow and disconnects frequently. The front desk was not very welcoming.

Opposite the hotel is Hema Supermarket, as well as Red Star Bread, Square Brick Fried Noodles, and the Old Beijing Breakfast Shop. The hotel's hygiene is also good. Except for the bedding, which is a little hard, everything else is good. Recommended if you are traveling.

msg:Unfortunately it's far from being a 5 star hotel!
Luggage was only brought to the room upon request. Furniture partly worn and broken (see photo). ￼The mattress was so hard that I could hardly sleep and ￼had back pain the next day. The coffee machine was broken, but was repaired. ￼Unfortunately no automatic toilet, like in other 5 star hotels. ￼At breakfast no one asked for a drink and the table was not set either. Before the end of breakfast, some of the rooms had already been cleared away. ￼The only real highlight was the extremely beautiful rooftop bar with a very large selection and the fact that I received an upgrade.

msg:We arrived around mid-morning. The temperature in Beijing was in the single digits that day. We learned that the central air conditioner in the hotel could not produce warm air, so when we checked in, we were told to store some things and come back to check in in the evening. We also asked about welcome fruits and electric heaters. The front desk said that the room was already occupied and had not been cleaned properly. Things would be sent in before we checked in at night. Then we stored our luggage and went out to play. We returned to the front desk around 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening to get the room card. When I entered the room, there were no drinks in the small refrigerator, no electric heater, and no fruit courtesy. After calling the service center, I learned that the price of 1,500 did not include small drinks in the refrigerator. The room aunt delivered the things very quickly. They brought electric heaters and welcome fruits. One boy brought 5 sugar-coated oranges and put them on a big plate. ? ? The room is quite large. Opposite is China's First Historical Archives. It's some distance from the subway station, but it's still quite close. It's impossible to take a taxi in Beijing. There are traffic jams everywhere, so it's not far away. The proximity to the subway station is a major feature. The service was rated 10 points, which was given to the room aunt who delivered things quickly.

msg:It was the first time I was looking forward to a deluxe room, but I didn’t expect that the front desk was so attentive. Considering that we could have space to move around with children, we were upgraded to a suite. We have stayed in so many five-star hotels. This is the first time a hotel has given us such a big surprise. I am really overjoyed. The facilities are very high-end. The TV is the latest Samsung. The curtains are also electric. The breakfast is also very rich and the taste is okay. But I personally think there are a few things that can be improved compared with other hotels. The hotel can serve as a reference. Can the hotel add more disposable items? The bathtub cover is prepared. When the shower head in the bathroom is turned on, no matter whether it is switched to large or small, the other one seems to flow a little. Also, the shower in the men's locker room in the swimming pool cannot be switched. When used, the water comes out at the same time. It seems that other guests have commented before. I have mentioned this problem and it seems that it has not been solved yet. The room is only equipped with a paper drawer and there are not many other problems. I will definitely choose this place next time I come to Beijing.

It took 20 minutes before a staff member came to check. After coordination, I changed the room to the executive floor and slept at night. When I opened the water bar, I found another obvious hair on the cup! Because it was already early in the morning, I didn't contact the front desk again. When I checked out at 9 a.m. the next morning, I told the front desk about the hygiene problem and showed me a photo. The front desk didn't even apologize and said they would respond...
This kind of hygiene quality and work style are really not in line with the positioning of the hotel. It is too irritating and is not recommended for stay.

I came with children and the elderly, and the front desk upgraded me to a suite, which was very considerate.
We want to visit the Temple of Heaven and the Zoological Museum. It is very close and very convenient. You can get there within walking distance. It's not far from the Forbidden City and Qianmen, so it's very convenient.
The breakfast is quite rich and delicious, and can accommodate Western pastries that children like and Chinese hot noodle soup that the elderly like.
ps, the cleaning and care products are from Malin Gouzi. The coriander scent and the conditioner have a unique smell. I quite like it.

The guy at the front desk, Arkin, was very enthusiastic and helped with the upgrade for free. The suite area is approximately 75 square meters.
The breakfast is rich. If you are tired of eating the same breakfast, kimchi is actually the best in the whole meal. Porridge and side dishes are the most delicious food in the world.
Will come again next time.

msg:Very good hotel ~ I came here with my husband for my birthday. I booked the hotel temporarily. I originally thought that the decoration would be older, but I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I entered the room! Thank you very much to Ms. FO Lisa when we checked in, who helped us upgrade directly to a suite. The room is very big, with a living room and bedroom, and a kitchen equipped with a full set of Siemens appliances. The decoration is nice and it has a very classic and chic feel. ! A little regret is that the TV is relatively old, but fortunately the Samsung mobile phone used by my husband can mirror the screen with the Samsung TV ~ The spare parts are large bottles of Marin! This was also the first time I encountered a hotel that used Marlin dogs. I was so impressed that I immediately placed an order for the entire set! The mattress is too hard for me, which is a pity hahaha😆Special praise for the mini bar! The first stay is free. It is so rich in instant noodles, potato chips and spam luncheon meat. Bottled water is Puna in glass bottles. Sparkling water is also available. Moreover, the hotel is very advanced and uses paper-packaged Elix mineral spring water, which is the best among domestic hotels. There are few hotels like this. From the paper packaging of mountain spring water to the replenishment of equipment and hotel paper bags delivered to the room on demand, this hotel is very environmentally conscious. Thank you! !

msg:I stayed at the New World Hotel in Shenyang before, and my impression was very good. This time I chose to stay at the New World Hotel when I came to Beijing. Strong sense of design, complete equipment, good service, suitable for parent-child travel and young people. The hotel is also chosen by the children themselves. Surprisingly, a free upgrade to a large suite.
It is 600-700 meters away from Chongwenmen Subway Station, turn right when exiting the hotel, only cross a small road in the middle, turn right and go straight, there is a McDonald's at the intersection downstairs of the hotel. To go to Universal Studios, transfer from Line 5 to Line 7 (Line 7 is newer than Line 1, and the ride is more comfortable). If you don’t catch the morning rush hour, there are not many people. There is a subway seat when you come back at night, so it’s very convenient to go back to the hotel. It is very close to Dashilan, Wangfujing, and Temple of Heaven Park. It takes 35-40 minutes to take a taxi for more than ten kilometers from Chaoyang Station, which is also very convenient. The child said which city to go to in the future, first see if there is a New World Hotel~

msg:Stayed for three nights. Let’s talk about the shortcomings first: the facilities are too old and are completely in compliance with the standards of 15 years ago. The toilet seat does not even lower down slowly. The faucet doesn't even have a bubbler. The water pressure is so high that if the water is discharged quickly, it will splash out. The hair dryer is the most common, no brand, and has low wind power. I always feel that a five-star hotel should have a Dyson. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom. The easy door that separates the bathroom from the room is too perfunctory. Both the moving feel and the size of the gap are unsatisfactory. I had the buffet breakfast for three days, and it was the same dish every day, with no changes.

Let’s talk about the advantages. The service is pretty good. Whatever you need when you call the front desk can be delivered in time. When eating the buffet, when the waiter sees someone forgetting his cell phone on the table, he can immediately ask one by one, and he is more proactive and responsible.

At that time, I chose this hotel mainly because I could cancel my reservation for free on the same day, and because the location was relatively convenient for traveling in the city center. So I chose this one. In addition, the price of the deluxe room I booked was 6k for 3 nights. After checking in, I felt it was a bit expensive.

Another thing I have never understood is that it is 0-4 degrees outside at night, the air conditioner is turned off in the room, and the window is opened, the room is still very hot, so much so that I didn’t even cover myself with a quilt when I fell asleep. I still don’t understand this. The reason is, is the weather in Beijing like this?

There are two room cards, and the front desk is also very friendly, much better than the service next door
The room type is large, the environment is clean and tidy, and the price is considered cheap. I only planned to stay for one night, but I booked an extra night because of the good environment and heavy rain. It is worth staying here👍

I stayed for 2 nights in total, Sunday and Monday. My friend who stayed on Saturday had two guys at the front desk to greet me. One of them told me that breakfast would be from 6:30 to 10:30. I was informed when I came down at 10:06 on Monday. Breakfast was over and I immediately complained to the front desk of the day because I had to catch the train at 11 o'clock. One of the front desks of the day immediately asked my husband and I to choose meals and deliver them to the room. When we checked out, we reported the situation to the manager of the day. When we checked in on Saturday, the two front desk guys who received us were chatting on the table at first, and they did not inform us of the change in breakfast time on Monday, so we did not have breakfast on Monday. I was really angry when I had the buffet breakfast as I wished. I hope the front desk can receive more training, chat less during working hours, and smile more when receiving guests. The business capabilities still need to be improved.

msg:The location of the hotel is very convenient, but the service awareness is very general: 1. When booking, the page shows that there are more than 300 extra beds. When you go to the store, you will directly say that the price will increase across the board, and the extra bed will be 550. Shouldn’t it be based on the booking time? 2. When I checked in, it was said that the room was upgraded to an executive room, but I could not enjoy the administrative trea**ent, and the room size was the same, but there were multiple coffee machines in the room. This is the first I heard about this upgrade. 3. After staying for 4 days, the toiletries were either missed or simply forgot to replenish, and I had to call every day to deliver them. Summer vacation is indeed the peak season, but this kind of service quality and attitude really makes people feel a little bit petty.

The breakfast variety is very rich, the Chinese food variety is more, and the seats are more, not very crowded
When I saw that there were freshly fried crayfish (fried on the spot in a transparent glass) for breakfast, my friends and I were stunned. This is also quite explosive in the entire hotel breakfast session.

The front desk staff ignored the questions and did not reply. At least 2-3 front desk staff had to ask several times. I went to three hotels in three days. New World Hotel is the highest-grade hotel with the worst service! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! too bad!

It is not too far from the surrounding hospitals, and the surrounding environment is quieter than those hospitals that are very close to the hospital. I always take a walk with my friends near the hotel, visit Wangfujing, and ride a bicycle in front of Tiananmen Square. The breakfast is also good. There are both Chinese and Western food, and the tastes of the north and the south can also be taken into account. The bakery will also be updated according to the market trend, but the lye balls that I ate two years ago have never been seen again🥺🥺🥺. The gym equipment is also good. In general, if the itinerary is not in a hurry, you don’t need to get up early to queue up for registration, and you want to be leisurely and quiet, I highly recommend this hotel.
Yan Rui, the manager who is in charge of arranging check-in for me, has known each other since last year. He has been very considerate and enthusiastic to help me arrange various check-in matters and solve problems. He is very nice.

The room is not old but not new, and it feels a bit precarious if it is not redecorated. The room type doesn't feel very good, it's a bit strange, the reserved double bed was given to a small suite, the corridor is wasted a lot, and the actual sense of space is not enough, which is not satisfactory. There is no window in the suite and it is very blocked.
The executive corridor is very quiet. There are light meals in the evening, and the lobby is also very comfortable. It feels like a escape from the world after sitting for a while, which is great.
The bolognese noodles and beef noodles for breakfast are amazing.
The service is also very good.
The swimming pool is very comfortable and the environment is very good. It's just that the water temperature in the shower room of the swimming pool fluctuates from hot to cold, and babies are prone to catch a cold when taking a bath.
The biggest problem was the dance party on the top floor on the night of April 30th, and I didn't fall asleep until after 1:00 in the morning.
The gift museum opposite the hotel is well worth a visit.

The deluxe twin room is very large. The two beds are put together to form a super king bed. The mattress is moderately soft and hard, and the two pillows are relatively soft. I always feel that the support is weak. The room is very quiet. It takes time for the bath water to heat up. The toiletries are all in large bottles. The shampoo has a mint scent and the conditioner has a coriander scent, which is relatively rare. The tea bags in the room are poorly packaged, which contrasts too much with the soft drinking water. There are many varieties of pastries for the buffet breakfast, and the quality is good. There are several Western-style cold cuts. Juice is average, Chinese cold dishes and side dishes are rich in variety, freshly cooked wontons and rice noodles are also good. We had a set meal when we booked the room, and we got a buffet dinner for two. The cost for children is 138. The freshly grilled steak and lamb chops for the buffet dinner are served, and they will be gone if they go again, and they have never been replenished. Some of the hot dishes are spicy and taste good. There are several types of sashimi such as salmon, sea bream, and arctic shellfish. There are a wide variety of western desserts for dinner, and the styles and tastes of mousse, row, and chocolate cake are not bad. Beverages are only soft drinks and soda. The buffet dinner is average in value for money. There is a shopping plaza on Dongdamochang Street next to the hotel. There are breakfast shops, bakeries, and pancake shops. It is also very convenient to have breakfast next to the hotel. There is also the time-honored Ziguang Garden, which is very popular and queues up every day. It takes ten minutes to walk to the subway station from the hotel, and it is also very close to the Temple of Heaven, so it is convenient to travel. Overall, except for the high price after the May Day price adjus**ent, the stay is still pleasant.

Anyway, after the upgrade, it's pretty good. The room is very spacious. I live in it The one next to the residential building is very quiet at night, and the facilities are very modern.
Only one breakfast is included, and I added another one for 148 yuan, and the meal is okay. Moderate.
It is very close to Tiananmen Square, museums, Wangfujing, etc. It is very convenient to take the subway, walk, or take a taxi.

The location was very good. We also upgraded the room type for free. Highly recommended! Thumbs up!

Special praise to the little brother at the door who was on duty at around 3:40 pm on January 30, who helped us with our luggage and called a car, and waited with us in the cold wind. The fly in the oin**ent is that only one breakfast is delivered every day. I booked 2 nights and discussed with the front desk of the hotel to combine 2 breakfasts in one morning. I didn't agree. I hope this can be optimized. Next time I come to Beijing, I will choose New World.

Although I found out later that I didn't have time to eat, there is a bus stop at the door. This time I brought my children to Beijing to play.

The front desk staff and the cleaning lady are also very polite, patient, and enthusiastic, making people feel very comfortable.

The original 2-night New Year staycation was upgraded to an 85-square-meter super deluxe suite. (When I checked in, I was told that New World Hotel and Rosewood Hotel belong to the same hotel group).
Layout: Double door double corridor, to the left of main door entry is a flanker with wash basin. The living room and bedroom face west, and the entire wall of windows is quite impressive. The main area is carpeted, and the bedrooms can be completely separated by sliding doors on three sides.
Bathroom: Double sink + simple dressing table. There is a raised stool under the sink. The amount of water sprayed above the head of the bathroom is very comfortable. All bathroom accessories are Malin Goetz
Praise for details: ① The welcome fruits are also very attentive, and there is also white fungus and snow pear soup. ②The surname of the guest will be remembered when calling the front desk ③Double TV wall design, two TVs on one wall ④Various wood elements run through the hotel, such as the coffee table in the living room and the small wooden Chris**as tree on the dining room table🎄
Catering: Buffet dinner and breakfast are served at the Tiantan Street Restaurant on the first floor. The Angus steak, roast duck and various steamed shellfish for dinner were impressive. Of course, the most prominent category is desserts. The dessert area occupies about 1/3 of the buffet preparation area, including freshly baked soufflés. The breakfast options are not too extensive, but they are just right, especially the sweet and savory tofu puddings (two separate containers)
Facilities: The swimming pool and gym are on the 3rd floor (the gym is 24 hours a day). The actual area of ​​the infinity pool is not large, about 15*8? , but the whole area is very spacious and spacious. The water temperature of the SPA pool can be a little warmer

4. The variety in the morning is also diverse, suitable for various Chinese and Western breakfasts.

msg:I rarely write about hotels, but this experience in Beijing was truly magical:
I made an impromptu decision to come to Beijing for the weekend. The hotel where I usually stayed after I got off the plane was unavailable. I made a temporary reservation at another hotel without even checking it out. As a result, I became allergic to the bedding in that hotel and the service also made me very dissatisfied. I was so angry at one o'clock in the morning. ! ! I changed hotels directly. When I changed hotels, I was waiting on the roadside for the bus. The cold wind blew and I wanted to cry.

I saw that all the hotels near the Second Ring Road were full, but this New World hotel still had one room, so I took a taxi directly.
I don’t know if it’s because Beijing has just opened up, but the hotel rooms were very full and there was only one small suite left, so I just checked in because I was too lazy to bother.
This hotel does not have too much luxury, but it gives people a quiet and comfortable feeling. I am very satisfied with my two-night stay. There is a small corridor separating the living room and bedroom of the small suite. The sound insulation is very good, and I did not hear any abnormal noise. The bed The product is clean. Beijing is better, the room is very warm when you enter it

The hotel service is also satisfactory. I will greet guests when I see them in the corridor. I have everything I need for breakfast. I can see the traffic on the street through the blinds by the window. I have a slow and comfortable breakfast. The breakfast service will actively ask what I want to drink. , it was cold by the window and they brought me a blanket

The service attitude at the front desk was also very good, and they spoke very gently. The doorman also took the initiative to help me carry my luggage when I left. During the Chris**as period, the hotel did not have a Chris**as tree, but they used pine cone garlands as Chris**as decorations, which was unique and cute.
I accidentally stayed in this hotel, which was beyond my expectations. I spent a quiet and wonderful weekend in this hotel. I can come here next time I need to stay in the Second Ring Road when I come to Beijing~

The location is very good, quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle, very close to Tiananmen Square, and you can also ride a bicycle through Dongjiaomin Alley to Tiananmen Square. Breakfast is also a must-choice every time, and there are many choices for children and adults. In my opinion, New World's service has always been great, thoughtful and meticulous. Check-in and check-out procedures are also very efficient. Will choose this again. Opposite the hotel is the National First Historical Archives.

msg:I stayed for 3 nights during the Chinese New Year, and the experience was very poor. 1. The swimming pool is open from 11 am to 8 pm during the tourist season. The hotel pools I know are usually open until 10 pm. This is the time to go out during the day. , I can't swim at all when I come back. I deliberately call the hotel to ask the hotel what time it is in order to prevent tourists who come to swim in the hotel. I really admire it! 2. The breakfast in the hotel usually ends at 10:30 in the morning. It has different opening hours for breakfast on weekdays and weekends. Each hotel has its own rules, which is understandable. When checking in, the front desk will remind guests one time. 3. The photos of Ctrip hotels are also too P, the actual hotel is too different from the pictures, whoever stays knows.
Originally, I decided to book Grand Hyatt, but later I saw that this one seems to be a little bit bigger, and I will learn a lot from it. In the future, I should not be greedy for big things, and stay in a regular brand hotel. This is the first time for Ctrip to write a review!

The lady at the front desk of the restaurant is also very cute and kind. Every day I ask me if I need coffee and bring it to the table.

The hotel as a whole is quite satisfactory, the room is large, the dry and wet are separated, and the cloakroom is separated. However, the hotel's breakfast was mediocre, especially the chef in charge of frying eggs. It seems that the hotel did not get paid, and the fried eggs were thrown directly to the guests. After complaining to the restaurant manager, no feedback was received. I went to have breakfast the next day, I knew I had complained, and my attitude was even worse. I asked for 7 mature eggs, and they were directly fried until they were fully cooked. I deliberately said that I didn't hear it. Very reluctantly done after insisting to re-fry two eggs for me. It is strongly recommended that the hotel give the necessary penalties.

However, the information on the booking page has not been updated, and there are problems with the design of some hotel facilities.
First, the executive lounge is not open, there is no prompt on the booking page, and the executive lounge is still marked. To be honest, I booked it at the executive lounge...
The compensation given is a buffet dinner, and you have to say hello in advance to make a reservation.
I took a break from vacation and rushed back to Beijing to send my partner back to Europe. I had already booked dinner. I was going to stay in the executive lounge and chat about life, but... um...
In addition, there is no welcome gift written... but this does not matter.
Second, the hotel bathtub handle design is very unfriendly. When I got up from the bath, my arm hit the edge of the armrest, and it was scratched...
In this design, the armrests are inward or the bathtub is a few centimeters out...
Throwing those two things aside, it's alright...

The location of Chongwenmen is very convenient and very central. The room area is very large even when compared to hotels of the same type. The height of the bed and the hardness of the mattress are suitable for Chinese people. It is very different from European and American brand hotels. The facilities are also very well maintained. , The whole hotel is not old, the bathroom produces hot water every second, and the air-conditioning sound is very small and will not affect sleep.
The hotel’s breakfast is very good, the variety is not particularly large, but the taste and quality are very good, the attitude of the entire restaurant is very kind and active and enthusiastic, the China Printing Bar on the 12th floor is very stylish, not noisy, or Internet celebrity, especially suitable Drink some wine and chat with friends, and eat skewers.
The main problem of the hotel lies in the spare parts. First of all, five-star hotels use small bottles of Pure Yue to make free water. It seems that the price is relatively low. Secondly, the texture of the toiletries is also average. There is no paper box but a bag of plastic bags. Paper napkins, these will make people feel a little too cost-saving, I hope it can be improved

msg:To be honest, the price is really not worth it. If you want to stay in a hotel, please choose New World carefully. When you arrive at the hotel at noon, there is no one at the door to carry your luggage. Yes, I learned later that the check-in is at the counter on the left. It is invisible at the door. Check-in is quite speechless. When booking, I noted a twin room. When I checked in, I also emphasized the need for a twin room. The room was a double bed room. After communication, we changed to a twin room. After I went in and looked at it, the sanitation was too dirty. There was still oil on the coffee table, dust on the table, and beards on the bed, too. Quite speechless, the cleaning staff wiped it after calling to communicate, the overall check-in experience was not satisfactory

msg:🚗 Transportation: Very convenient. The location of the hotel is within walking distance to popular attractions such as Wangfujing and Temple of Heaven. It is also close to the Tiananmen Forbidden City and other places by car.

🍃Environment: The size of the room is suitable, but in comparison, the decoration of the toilet is relatively old. The washbasin is really too old and the water in the bathroom is very poor. Basically, it is standing in the dirty water and washing after the hotel feedback. The new floor drain is fine. The toilet room is too small. Close the door. It is closed on all sides. It is recommended that people who are afraid of confinement in a small space are cautious. The toilet is not too tight.

🔔Service: The front desk of the hotel is warm and provides drinking water
Overall, the price/performance ratio of this hotel in such a location is relatively high

msg:Let me talk about the bad things first: 1. The front desk was dishonest. I called the hotel before booking and told me that I could check out at 1pm at the latest. However, I called the front desk the morning of the check-out and told me that the room was booked that day. , I need to check out at 12 o’clock at the latest. As a result, I went to Ctrip and found that the room was not fully booked. Although I was delayed to check out at 1 o’clock in the end, it’s not good to lie. 2. The variety of breakfast is quite plentiful, but the practice is not flattering. The temperature in Beijing was around 0℃ during the few days I lived, but the milk and fruits were all iced. Eating too much is definitely not good for the stomach. Let's talk about the good: the hotel has a good location, not far from the Tiananmen Square of the Forbidden City, the soundproofing of each room is also good, and the room hygiene is also OK

After watching the flag raising, I left the hotel at 4 o’clock and arrived at the security checkpoint in 20 minutes, and finally stood in the first row as I wish.
The hotel experience also exceeded expectations. First of all, the rooms are really big, the facilities are relatively new, and the living is very comfortable. A few hundred meters away is the subway station. It takes ten minutes to walk to the front door. During this time, we also passed through an alley. Proper old Beijing feel
The hotel is good in all aspects, super cost-effective, highly recommended

msg:The overall feeling is that it is a normal hotel with no special surprises relative to the room rate of more than one thousand yuan. The hotel is 10 minutes away from the subway station, and it takes more than ten minutes to go to Tiananmen Square by bicycle sharing. There are some restaurants on Fridays, which are convenient for eating, especially for take-out and delivery is extremely fast.
The room facilities are pretty good, but the bathroom is partitioned by a sliding door, which is often stuck, which is very inconvenient. The swimming pool in the hotel is very good. Children have to play every day when they come back. Now when I come back, I often think about the New World Swimming Pool.
Overall it's good, it's worth it again

Although it has been locked, I feel that it is not at ease, and it is fine for me to stay for four nights. Another downside is that there is a pool of stains on the bedside that has been really affecting the mood. Although I know it is difficult to clean up, I don’t know how it can leave such dirty stains and have such dirty hair. I hope the hotel It can be cleaned up and then people can move in, because it was discovered only after sleeping at night, and I don't want to switch back and forth the next day and sleep on the other end. What is commendable is the waiter on the floor, the service is in place, and we will provide timely supplies when we encounter any needs.

The location of the hotel is very good. It is a one-kilometer walk from the Temple of Heaven Park, about a 20-minute walk, and it is not far from the Tiananmen Forbidden City. It is convenient to take a taxi. But the single bed in the hotel's double bed is too small, only 1.1 meters, it would be better if it could be bigger! The hotel service is pretty good, but sometimes it is difficult to get through the service phone, and the room delivery is in place, but it lacks a little enthusiasm! I booked four rooms and stayed for 5 nights. Unfortunately, I couldn't go to the terrace and have a drink. At that time, I fancy the terrace. As a result, I was too rushed every day to have no chance to go, and the children had to go to the swimming pool every day!

1. The front desk, restaurant, and room service are very enthusiastic. The family went to the train station at 6 o'clock in the morning. The front desk helped to make a reservation for the vehicle and prepared a breakfast pack.
2. The facilities are okay. There is no obvious shabby feeling. The luxurious room is the same as the description. There is 60 square meters. The extra bed is free of pressure. The disadvantage is that the single bed is a 1.2-meter bed.
3. The location of the hotel is very good, not far from the city attractions, but Beijing is really stuck in traffic
4. The bar on the top floor is very popular on weekends. Martini with Huang Feihong can have it haha

msg:酒店設施很新，門口迎賓人員很熱情，主動打招呼，幫忙開車門及拿行李。這次入住房型也給升級了，雖然房間很大但是雙床房床比較小，電視也比較小。洗漱用品不錯。酒店的位置非常便利，離天壇步行大約1公里；離前門大街也很近，周邊吃飯也很方便，老字號萃華樓步行可達。距離5號線和2號線地鐵站崇文門走路10分鐘左右。早餐自助餐148一位，住客是一點折扣都沒有，不過好在品種繁多，製作精良。停車是一小時十元，按小時收費，無上限，住客也是一點優惠不享受。我們入住了三晚，週一退房，想申請延遲退房至三點，前台推三阻四，各種藉口予以拒絕，並以週一房間緊張做為託詞，據我們觀察，房間入住率不高，而且辦理入住時前台已被告知可享受延遲退房至三點，如果做不到，就請不要白紙黑字寫在紙上。週末入住率高可以理解，暑假結束後的週一以入住率高為籍口就有點兒牽強，正常酒店都可以直接申請延遲至兩點退房，我們連續打了幾個電話，前台才勉強同意延至兩點退房。

樓下附近就有一家出名的烤鴨店叫紫光園，好吃😋附近還有按腳的店嘿嘿。

msg:優點:
1  酒店的地理優勢真的是非常明顯，走路五分鐘左右，就是新世界百貨，吃飯非常方便，買東西也很便利。
2  邊上就是崇文門地鐵站，有2號線和5號線，幾乎能直接到達或者換乘到一些熱門的景點，天安門廣場，故宮，雍和宮，頤和園，圓明園，也是五分鐘左右就能走到，特別適合玩累了後回來就能到酒店。
3  給我印象最深刻的就是重點要表揚一下門口的門僮，太積極主動和貼心服務了。去的時候司機開錯了位置，沒有拐進酒店門口，而是在馬路邊上，還在發愁怎麼搬運行李呢，門僮就主動到路邊迎接，眼觀六路的服務，很驚喜。走的時候也是主動詢問車到了沒有，幾位，車牌號多少，幫我們留意車輛。

缺點:
一共入住了4個晚上
隔音不行，不夠安靜。
在第一天和第二天晚上的時候，就聽到了挺響的咚咚咚的吵鬧聲音，跑來跑去，非常吵，而且是在晚上十一點多，影響睡覺休息，打電話給前台，想要換房間，一直沒人接電話，聯繫不上，衹能作罷。
網絡巨差
連接了酒店的wifi也沒有用，斷開用自己的網絡也沒用，差到什麼程度呢，微信和QQ的消息都收不到。
還得從被子裏爬起來，在窗邊上網，也沒有用……就別想着能刷圖片，上攜程，看視頻了。每次衹能先開一下飛行模式，再關閉，然後立馬能刷出來一些消息和圖片。差到我去攜程搜了評論，也有人是反應信號很差，同時前台的答覆也是萬能敷衍回覆，我聯繫升級一下你房間的網絡。
同樣的，也是在第二天是在忍不了了，聯繫了酒店前台無果，電話打不通，反覆播打沒人接。
至於第一天為什麼沒有聯繫酒店呢，在辦入住時候，就説想要樓層高一些的，安靜點的，答覆沒有辦法更換，衹能作罷，結果第二天再聯繫，電話打不通，又是挺晚了，衹能忍受。可想而知，整整兩個晚上，在旅途勞累的情況下，網上不去，還要聽跑來跑去的咚咚咚，微信收不到，視頻看不了，想要查詢第二天的路線，衹能不停的開飛行模式，重啟再斷開。簡直是折磨。
第三天晚上了，八點多就開始聽到咚咚咚，然後繼續上不去網，是在忍無可忍的情況下，給前台打了電話，也是打了好久終於打通了，同樣的冷漠答覆，表示換不了房間，詢問是否有客人反應網絡很差，答覆沒有，其實我都在攜程評論裏搜到了，並且前台表示自己試了可以上網，沒有同理心，繼續溝通質疑是不是我供應商的問題，還好我移動和聯通號都有，表示都上不上去，前台繼續答覆，説升級一下我房間的網絡，這個答覆是不是和攜程裏的評論一樣的，萬能敷衍答覆，我表示聽過了。這時候依舊不同意我換房，在我的堅持下，並且逐一回復了他的敷衍答覆，最終同意了給我換房間。不到萬不得已，我也不想換，電話溝通，整理行李，換衣服，整整浪費了花了40分鐘。
整體來説:一是最後還是給換了房間，但是浪費了40分鐘，而且從頭到底，沒有因為自己的房間有問題，給客户這麼不好的體驗，有所歉意，是在我的強烈堅持下，才給換了房間，有房間，卻不給換。
二是酒店服務響應速度太低，前台電話一直打不通，沒有辦法及時處理客户問題，如果因為人員不足的原因，也應該由酒店管理做好安排。
三是沒有同理心，在反應問題的時候，前台答覆沒有人反饋，同時表示自己的手機可以上網沒有問題。那沒有人反饋，這事兒就不存在了嗎？其實是有人反饋了，刷一下攜程評論就有。同時，酒店管理，也可以刷一下攜程的評論，既然已經有人反饋了，説明到現在也沒有去改善提升。
總之，沒有遇到過服務這麼不好的酒店，但是門僮是碰到過最好的門僮

msg:房間不錯，在北京如此高價的房費情況下，1000塊能訂到最好的酒店了，地理位置也很不錯，離天安門廣場、王府井大街很近，騎個自行車五分鐘就到了，晚上可以夜遊長安大街，舒舒服服，就是設施略微陳舊了點，畢竟酒店也要開了將近10年，但勝在價格、位置給力，下次來北京還會選擇

首先很感謝前台幫忙升級了房型，住的更加寬敞舒服。
就服務來説，無論是前台的工作人員還是門口的迎賓人員，都格外熱情，對本職工作認真負責。
就地理位置來説，真的很不錯，離地鐵口近，附近的各個景區就不用説了，基本步行可到，附近也有商場，吃飯購物都方便。
就居住設施&衞生來説，設施維護的不錯，較新，該有的設施都有;衞生也很到位，沒有奇怪的味道，每天的打掃也很積極到位。
就隔音來説，估計是住的套房的關係，無論是窗外還是酒店內的聲音都被隔離得很好，睡得很舒服。
就早餐來説，西點好吃，但早餐的整體種類每天沒有變化，連着吃會膩。
整體來説，是價格和各方面較為匹配的高性價比酒店。當然每個人的標準不同，各花入各眼~

 其餘衛生  服務全是垃圾
1.房間點餐 需要掃碼  我這個手機沒有微信  用房間電話打給前臺點餐  各種不耐煩  我沒說完就直接挂斷我的電話   第2次才答應給我電話點餐   我難道不給錢嗎  各種不情願
用餐完畢請酒店收餐具   不接電話直接挂斷  2次掛斷之後我用手機打外綫  才接通  告訴我剛才在忙  難道我不是顧客   為了服務別人挂我電話  太過份   
這都是一位長頭髮前臺女職員所為
2早餐的盤子沒洗乾淨  有食物殘渣   同一天發現2次 
3按了免打擾還敲門   更誇張的是  服務員自行開門進來說要打掃房間

房間還是比較大的，就是房間裏面的飲用水不是瓶裝的，而是那種紙盒裝的，打開後必須一次性喝完，不然不能保存，個人覺得有點浪費了！
早餐中規中矩，品種不是很多，可以吃飽，住了4天每天早餐都一樣，沒有換過一樣，連續吃4天有點膩！

前台辦理入住時無功無過，速度很快但是態度一般般，不知道是不是北方服務業的常態。房間內有物品需求的時候客房部反饋還是很快的。浴室碰到兩次水忽然冷了，因為第二天要退房了也就沒反應。還有就是離地鐵二號線步行10分鐘，還是可以接受的。酒店位置不是在商業街或者商場附近略有不便。

缺點也説一説吧，估計酒店主打親子游？酒店有許多帶小朋友的家庭入住，迷你吧是沒有飲料提供的，也就是説整個房間是沒有消費商品的。商務設備也沒有，衹有鉛筆和便條紙，透明膠，尺子類似這種商務需求的都沒有。衞生打掃的也不是特別徹底，花灑的軟管上面水垢好嚴重，一看就是沒有徹底清理過的，這樣下去的話扛不了多久酒店的設施就完蛋了。再就是晚上想加餐吃個麪，打電話過去客服非讓在app上點，是的沒錯，餐單就這一張紙反正面。但是app上沒辦法下單，客服説讓服務員拿pos來，我很奇怪為什麼不能掛房賬，但是這已經不重要了，等待10多分鐘以後客服來電話説app上點不了，就是不能點了，沒有了…哎，合著我是貴酒店第一個點餐的啊？流程如此不熟練，軟件服務還是達不到五星級酒店的標準的
如果不在意酒店對應的五星級服務，着重需要遊玩便利的話這個酒店的還是一個不錯的選擇的

但入住前台以及客房清潔的阿姨挽救了評分
🔔服務：
開門見山 一樓左轉是餐廳🍴有一位女性前台 個子應該在160左右 半死不活的服務態度以及待客意識着實讓我堅定了減肥的信心 幫助顧客在就餐前抑制食慾簡直太過體貼😌作為一個在就餐區值班的服務人員 希望你認清你所處的環境 我是來吃東西的不是來倒胃口的😊可能是你九點還在上班有客人麻煩你讓你心煩吧？😅別因為你一個人就把新世界酒店各個崗位的工作人員為顧客營造的體驗感打破😊什麼事情不想細説 自己想
其次來説最值得表揚的 前台以及客房清潔阿姨
前枱面對客人提出的各種問題以及沒提出的問題事無鉅細的進行了回答補充並且提供了幫助 不像個別酒店團隊之間傳遞訊息需要上刀山下火海半個小時才有迴應
四天裏清潔阿姨基本是同一個 清潔速度迅速乾淨整潔 房間需要的很多東西搬來搬去沒有感受到任何不耐煩 微笑待客很有温度 能感受到這位阿姨是把工作時間內的任何事情當作應做的而不是敷衍了事
相比那個餐廳前台我真的是無話可説😶
🚗 交通：
很適合不購物的遊客 走路就能到天安門看升旗
價格也很合適 四晚下來1w+

這家酒店就在我家後面，有時候過來度週末。餐廳晚上有自助，還有個非常有名的祈年八號 粵菜茶點。三層是spa和游泳池。游泳池乾淨人少。頂樓有酒吧 簡直完美吶

🍃環境：酒店環境一流  各種設施都很新 又不會覺得沒有人味 正是一個酒店最好的階段 房間面積在北京同等價位屬於一級大 可以在屋裡遛彎的內種
🧹衞生：衞生做的很好 空氣清新又沒有其他酒店的奇怪香味 對過敏星人非常友好
🔔服務：服務非常到位 每個員工都很有主觀能動性 很熱情 又很難得的有分寸 細緻周到又不讓人尷尬  響應迅速 遇到問題能主動提出解決方案 住過三次就基本被全員記住了名字 格外表揚前台的閆經理 大事小情都非常關照 對待客户特別有責任心 難得一個小女孩
早餐菜品不錯 很有北京特色 吃起來舒心 還總有橫菜 沙拉蔬菜新鮮水靈 看着就清爽 甜點種類豐富 我這種嗜甜如命的人大滿足  就希望麪檔以後能有手擀麪吧 這樣配牛肉湯應該更香 頂層酒吧去過兩次 景觀氛圍都很好 有露天區 春秋天更舒服
配圖是單獨訂的天壇套房 不是豪華房 更大 適合接待客户 賊有面兒 結婚的也可以當接親房

我是第一次在二環裏定酒店，看了很多家的價格和麪積，覺得都不是很滿意。個人還是喜歡在價格相同的情況下選面積大的酒店。所以當時看到這個面積還是挺開心的。畢竟這裡是北京的二環。

酒店地理位置很好，距離王府井，東單，天安門，西單大悦城都不算遠。周邊還有商圈也很不錯。

最後酒店整體環境和服務都是超一流。前台小哥哥和小姐姐都很熱情。酒店裡的餐吧也是一絕。包括房間裏的沐浴露和洗手液也是一絕。

msg:這是我入住那麼多酒店頭一次遇到升級房型要加費用的酒店！頭一晚上的房間是帶兩位早餐的，升級房型後就衹給了一位早餐，私下就去掉一位早餐！雖然和前台溝通後説可以兩位！但沒有一點欠意，是我定房間的時候就是兩位早餐，是你們私自去掉的！服務感極差的一家酒店！

msg:北京新世界酒店整體無功無過，作為暑假帶孩子打卡北京的住宿地，酒店在地理位置、舒適度方面做的還是不錯的，距離天壇北門不遠，愛步行的20分鐘，不愛步行的酒店對面103路公交車三站直達，距離天安門升旗點也不遠，不追求前5排的，凌晨4點打車前往前門基本也能湊個熱鬧，距離故宮、國子監、景山公園約個車前往3-7公里左右。唯一糟點是地段靠近王府井及前門附近，早晚高峯期間異常擁堵，注意避開。酒店的床和枕頭必須點贊，床軟硬適中，枕頭也不是很高的那種，非常舒服，絕對是北京長距離走路後最佳的休息品質。酒店的自助早餐品種較少，選擇餘地有限，説是六點半開餐，結果大廚們都沒有準備好，連煎雞蛋的也沒有，希望既然承諾六點半開餐至少工作人員需要早做準備，另外補餐也不是很及時。住了六個晚上給我們最大的感受是北方酒店的服務意識和質量遠低於同等級別南方的酒店，從門口禮賓，到大堂前台，再到康體服務人員甚至樓層客服沒有一個是微笑服務的，全程撲克臉，愛搭理不搭理的。好在我們是來打卡景點的，服務差點兒也就忽略不計了。再説説酒店的周邊，酒店周邊餐飲還是很多的，步行50米商場內有數家餐飲機構，方便用餐。遠一點的300-400米距離處有新世界百貨，餐飲也比較多，住在這裏吃是不用愁的。

位置：酒店離天壇、前門都挺近的，走幾步就是東交民巷。衹要沒有特殊情況，不封路，交通是真的很便利。
服務：基本在水平線，客房清潔情況也還好。
餐飲：祈年8號粵菜口味OK。就是送餐點餐結束的時間有點早…半夜肚子餓，想點些東西吃結果發現可選擇的很少。
游泳池：分兩個，大池子水偏冷，感覺不到28度，小池子是熱水。小朋友們遊一會大池子就到小池子裏泡泡，緩一緩。

缺點：停車不免費，不免費，不免費！12元/小時，我住了一天的時間，交了相近300元的停車費，如果不停在酒店地庫，周圍附近沒有停車場！！！衞生間沒有垃圾桶！！！沒有紙抽！！！

msg:The reason for the negative review is very simple. I don't want to live and want to change the hotel in the process of negotiating with the store owner. The hotel asks to tell why not to go. If you need to provide medical records because of illness, if you simply don't want to live, the deposit will not be refunded. I just want to ask, first of all, I booked your hotel as a guest of your hotel and I don't want to go and negotiate with you. The deposit can be deducted. But you don't give a ****. second. No matter what your reason is. What right does the hotel have to ask the guest to provide the case and you can only refund the deposit after verifying it. What department are you in. Why. Overall impatient with this hotel, rubbish. Bad to burst!
