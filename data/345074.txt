msg:This was my third time staying at the St. Regis. Eaton from check-in, was very friendly and informative about everything happening at the hotel. We traveled for a friend‚Äôs birthday so we booked the garden villa. We actually stayed in the exact same garden villa from a previous trip! Our garden villa was spacious and they provided us with a nice welcome snack and wine! Our butler Caroline, was very helpful throughout our entire stay and always made sure we had everything we needed. She was very kind and caring. Throughout the morning or day she would message to see if we needed anything or buggy service. She made sure our laundry was picked up and returned to us in a timely manner. She made sure we received a birthday cake! Our Ayi Parttime, was also very friendly and made sure to make special decorations for the birthday! Breakfast was very delicious with a wide variety of options and free flow champagne üçæ David from Driftwood was very kind and helpful throughout our stay as well. Overall, the stay was very relaxing and I would stay again. Also, the Ocean and Sky Bar was a nice addition and provided a very relaxing environment to wind down at after a busy day at the pool! Chloe was very nice and made sure we had our drinks or anything we needed. 

Some things that need improving are: the garden pool villa has too many trees so there is not much exposure to the sun, the pool equipment (chairs and recliners) are out of date and need updating, the Ocean and Sky should have the band play later than 9pm on weekends (it was a great place to relax and chill with a drink but the live music stopped too soon). Besides that, I would recommend the St. Regis to anyone looking for a nice and relaxing holiday!

msg:I had a wonderful time at St. Regis. From the moment we arrived Eton made us feel very welcome. He told us all about the hotel, the things we could do, and upgraded our room. Lucas was also extremely helpful. He made all of our reservations for us during our stay and made us feel that nothing was too much. Chloe at the Ocean and Sky Bar was also fantastic. 

The amenities were great, especially if relaxing is on your agenda. The pool was never too busy and there were also several spaces on the beach. 

Looking forward to returning!

msg:- Rooms are old school but actually well maintained, clean and very enjoyable. Good coffee machine, comfortable bed, huge bathroom and nice balcony setting 
- breakfast is of good quality. Not the best variety I ever experienced, but didn‚Äôt miss anything 
- The compound is quite well maintained and plenty walking ground around the hotel area
- pool is ok, nothing special. What‚Äôs really negative, there are no pillows on the recliners. Not at the pool and also not on the beach side. If the recliners were at least comfortable without the pillows, it would be acceptable. Makes it unbearable to relax on it for longer then 20min. After complaining we got told that they no longer provide pillows, but they still have 6 beds down at a corner of the beach with cushions. Pictures provided, please consider this is a Marriott top luxury hotel brand.
- we were assigned a personal care taker, Janet, who was always accessible and attentive. Very positive person 
- the service mentality in the hotel is very mixed. Some areas are pretty good, like in the lobby and restaurants. Some areas are very mediocre, like around the pools and bar area. Not consistent 
- food and drinks in the hotel facilities are overly expensive. A not well made cocktail will cost you 90rmb and a simple burger with fries 200+. Here you pay the name and not the quality. No wonder the outside delivery area is busy
- location is at the end of yalong bay beach and quite a ride from the street to the hotel. We asked a service person at the lobby with a electric transportation car if he can drop us at the end of the hotel property near the main road, which he just refused. So we had to walk, which is some way in the burning sun. Which confirms the service inconsistency again. 
- we come to Sanya once a year to have some relaxing days and experienced many hotels on different beach locations. The ST Regis is not the price value choice I would recommend.

- nice big rooms with a fantastic bathroom and a great ocean view.
- a very good breakfast which always was the first highlight of the day ( big thank you to Bella who welcomed us wit iced Americano‚Äôs)
- I recommend to book the seafood buffet direct at the beach. Very romantic and good selection of barbecued seafood and meat.
A beach bar with nice view but a bit too pricey drinks complemented the days
For the kids the hotel offers nice attractions I recommend the crab catching. Our daughter became a professional hunter. At the end we let the crabs go and finished the day with a cool bath in the nice central pool.
Over all a nice experience and i finish with a big thank you to Janet who made my daughter happy with a delicious chocolate cake!

He was also available to deal with any additional requests while at the hotel and oversaw our checkout and transfer back to the airport. He definitely added to the overall experience. 

I stayed in the Royal Villa which is excellent! The location and food served using the private in-room dining was amazing.

I've stayed at St Regis before and was not disappointed with this experience.

msg:Highlights: 
- If you love to watch the sunrise, their private beach offers the best exclusive view for it and if you happen to book an ocean view room, you can just watch the sunrise from your balcony. 
- live music with JM and Stacey, the musicians. 
- good selection for breakfast 
- a quality butler who spoke perfect English and understood everything we needed.

If you want to try their dinner buffet, they have a good selection but I think the food is just average for the price that you pay. Then again, we ate on a colder night than usual and the food got cold straight away which probably influenced my view of the food. If you drink wine and eat mostly seafood I think you should get your money's worth.

msg:I don‚Äôt often leave reviews but this time it‚Äôs a must. 

We have lived in China for over a decade and have visited dozens of hotels. This is our 4th time in sanya and st Regis has offered by far the best service. 

The hotel room (poolside) was spacious and comfortable. Only negative would be the lack of mini bar options and room service food is limited. 

Shirley, our host was AMAZING and always ready to help. Her flexibility on early check in and late check out were remarkable and her readiness to make our stay more enjoyable was outstanding. This is what you look for in a 5* hotel. 

One suggestion: improve the breakfast offering. 

All in all, i highly recommend this hotel, St Regis: keep up the good work.

msg:The hotel is lovely as expected, all beautifully decked out for Christmas. Our butler Shirley was amazing..so helpful and friendly. I had a spa treatment whilst I stayed and I have to say it was one of the best I have had, worth every penny. 
The food at the Driftwood restaurant was superb, tasted amazing. The Thai beef salad and crab starters in particular were delicious!! Again service here was impeccable‚Ä¶Candy our waitress was so attentive really paying attention to details with us. 
I unfortunately didn‚Äôt spend time at the beach or pool as I arrived in Sanya when a typhoon hit üòû however, both areas looked nice. You can‚Äôt swim in the sea however so if that‚Äôs what you want maybe avoid this hotel, or stay here and take a day trip to Houhai Bay, we did this and enjoyed our beach day (albeit wet and windy). That‚Äôs one thing to note if the weather is bad there is nothing to do here so day trips will help massively. 
The hotel room itself was amazing, we were in a garden view room and it was spacious and really plush‚Ä¶.loved it!! 
My only disappointment was breakfast, they were full but were not letting people sit outside due to drizzle even though the tables were under cover (strange) so after we waited for 40 minutes we were then given a table outside (madness!). If this happens to you make sure to give your room number to the lady when you arrive, we didn‚Äôt when we first arrived and then realised people were getting let in before us who arrived after us as they had given her their number. (I don‚Äôt speak Chinese so I was just told to wait as they were full in English‚Ä¶Chinese speakers got given more information than me unfortunately so I had to wait longer till I figured it out for myself). 
So other than the breakfast shambles everything else here was amazing. I will come back‚Ä¶just in better weather and get to breakfast before 8:30-9am.

Hotel is very beautiful and posses all that you need to be satisfied and even more :) But to be honest without professional workers my stay would not be as pleasant as it was. Sometimes they are like real ninja (arrange things nice and smooth, but yet not taking too much of your attention) and defiantly visible when you need them. Special thanks here for Shirley who should change her name to hotel fairy by making all my wishes come true. This amazing stay would also not be possible without SKR who offered help when needed. I have been in many 5* hotels and this I really consider as exceptional! Highly recommend-work all RMB they charge

However we were disappointed by the fact that our room had no sea view that could be called that way despite the fact we booked a deluxe sea view room. We complained and got another one only very slightly better as at least we didn‚Äôt had the horrible swimming pool roof. (See picture). On another hand we did a mistake booking this hotel as the rooms were furnished in a Classical Chinese style which is not our taste. The breakfast was average for a 5star hotel and the restaurant very expensive while the food was just average. Not an I ce of holiday flair unlike the competitor hotel we stayed a few days earlier on dadonghai bay. Very disappointed.

However, it is at the end of the bay: which means a long walk or quick didi to center of the bay if you would like to swim in a bigger area or get dinner at another hotel. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a resort that is a little by itself but still close enough to try out new things in the day.

msg:After coming here during the epidemic, I came to Yalong Bay again. This time during the off-season in Sanya, I chose the St. Regis I had always longed for. The day before, I received a call from St. Regis. I added the St. Regis housekeeper on WeChat. The next day when I arrived at St. Regis, the front desk guided us to sit down and check in. This is a completely different service from the other hotels in Yalong Bay where we had to stand in line to check in. We felt the care of St. Regis. Knowing that my friend and I had our wedding anniversary in May, the hotel also asked professional staff to carefully arrange roses for us and sent cakes in the evening. Here I would like to express my special thanks to ‚ú®Jessica Jiajia‚ú® for her daily care and attention. Thank you üòä. When we checked out and returned to the airport, the handsome manager of the housekeeping depar**ent came outside the lobby and made a big bouquet of flowers to see us off. We don't know his name either. This time, the experience of St. Regis not only allowed us to enjoy the European royal aristocratic experience of hardware facilities, but also let us feel the noble enjoyment in service! I would also like to thank the photographers who took the trip. The hotel gave us a few photos of the trip. They served us for a long time. When choosing photos, we could choose as many as we wanted. They did not force us to choose as they said on the Internet. They were very friendly even if we did not choose. Thank you üòä, thank you for the special and attentive service of St. Regis. I will definitely recommend and choose St. Regis again next time in Yalong Bay!

The hotel environment is not bad, with 1 heated central swimming pool and 1 non-heated sky-covered swimming pool. The travel photography included in the package is also good, and the coconut boulevard and the large lawn are more photogenic. The sailing yacht included in the package is worth going out to sea, and the yacht is large and clean.
The housekeeper Ella Xiaoqiu is very good, responds to needs very actively, and will take the initiative to provide a list of hotel activities, and answer questions quickly.

The guy at the front desk who checked me in was also very patient (I forgot to ask his name). I had a great trip. I had a very comfortable stay at St. Regis. The bed was just the right hardness and softness. It was the most comfortable of the six five-star hotels I stayed in this time. The quilt was also dry and comfortable. The only flaw was that there was no separate iron in the room, but it was delivered immediately after calling the front desk. We booked a twin room, and one bed was no problem for two people to sleep in, which is suitable for family travel. The room is very wide, the lawn is well maintained, the beach is very close, and the white train is very new and photogenic. The road to the hotel feels like a secret place, and it is a very good travel experience.

msg:üìçThe hotel is located in Yalong Bay, about 40 minutes by taxi from the airport. The environment is very good, with its own beach and infinity pool, as well as the Royal Prairie and a small train. The hotel gave away a travel photo physical examination. The hotel scenery is very good, the photographer is very good at taking pictures, and every photo is beautiful in the later stage. Originally 10 photos were given away, and 30 photos were selected for extra money. The overall cost performance is still very high, which is much more cost-effective than the travel photo parent-child photos outside.

üçΩÔ∏èThe hotel's breakfast is self-service, with a variety of varieties, combining Chinese and Western, and also includes a variety of Sanya-style breakfasts. Just this Hou'an powder, the children like it very much, and they have been asking for it for 4 consecutive days. It is really possible to enjoy Sanya's special food in the hotel without leaving home. In addition, there are various breads, fruits, salads, yogurt, sushi, coffee, milk, etc., which can fully meet the needs of different taste buds of family members.

ü§µüèª‚ôÄÔ∏èIn addition, let's talk about the hotel's butler service. The hotel will contact by phone in advance before check-in to arrange an exclusive butler to provide various hotel services during the stay. Our housekeeper is ‚ú®Jessica‰Ω≥‰Ω≥‚ú®, the service is very good, the response speed is also very fast, and she will ask about the service needs every day. It happened to be my birthday during my stay, and they also specially prepared a birthday cake and a special surprise. The room is very romantic. I really thank St. Regis for letting me spend a different birthday.

Their afternoon tea is especially delicious, not too sweet, and there are many salty snacks. The room is very large, and I like it most that there are 2 washbasins, which is convenient. The room is very clean. Every waiter in the hotel will greet us warmly when they see us. It is very considerate. I will come again next time. The swimming pool is the cleanest hotel I have ever seen.

The hotel reflects the quality of a five-star hotel everywhere. Whether it is room hygiene, room service, dining service or hotel supporting facilities, they are all perfect. The butler Jessica Jiajia who connected with us is also very good. She will take the initiative to ask about needs every day, and the feedback is also very timely. We are very satisfied with all the services.
The hotel's infinity pool is a major feature. It is very photogenic and the experience is also very good. The bubble waves in it are very comfortable. The shaded swimming pool next to the east wing is also very good, with a suitable temperature and not many people.
The hotel beach is very photogenic and it is also good to catch the sea. We saw abalone and many crabs at low tide in the evening.

The pool room we stayed in was very large and the lawn was beautiful.
Speaking of the shortcomings, the beach was very disappointing. It was not only painful, but also full of stones and very small. Breakfast was the most unsatisfactory. Not only did you have to queue for a long time, but children over six years old were also charged, but they couldn't eat anything at all, which was very worthless. Since it is a parent-child hotel, you must bring your children. Two children under six years old have free breakfast every day. Why can't you add one more child for free breakfast?

msg:Let me start with the conclusion. This is the T0-level hotel in Yalong Bay in my mind (I have stayed in almost all the hotels in the first row of the central square in Yalong Bay from left to right. This is the only one that makes me want to repurchase and I am willing to recommend it to my friends). 

[Super large, boundless, transparent and heated swimming pool] 
One word: absolutely perfect! It is really photogenic. You can take a high-end photo with just a casual shot. Those who like taking photos must go here! 
In addition, if you are a swimming enthusiast, the horizontal width is 30 meters and it is still heated. Can you bear it if you like swimming? It is irresistible. I swam 1,500 meters on the first day I arrived at the hotel. When I was tired, I looked up and saw the blue sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãYalong Bay. I couldn't stop at all. 
There are also 4 time points every day where mermaids will take photos with you 

[Hotel environment] 
Private beach + super large lawn + lake view and mountain view + various entertainment facilities + there is also a Sun Bay Highway next to it. You can collect all the dragon balls at once. Can you believe it? Yes, it is St. Regis. This is the only hotel I have stayed in in the whole Yalong Bay. 

[Room facilities] 
The basic room type is 73 square meters. Yes, you read it right, it is 73 square meters. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe basic room type is about the same as that of other hotel suites. 
It has everything you should have, and there are also unexpected things. The details are too rich. It is recommended that you experience it yourself. I will not elaborate here. 

[Food and Drinks] 
Breakfast is quite rich in Chinese and Western food. 
Dinner is hot pot at the beach in Yalong Bay, perfect 
There are performances at the beach from 8 to 9 o'clock every night. Lie down A bottle of beer, a nice plate 

[The best butler service in Yalong Bay] 
Special thanks to Miss Fan Niwei. Because of the flight delay and rescheduling, she arrived in Sanya from Shanghai early in the morning and checked us in at 9:30. She was so considerate 
The whole service was clearly arranged, with all kinds of details. The best butler service in Yalong Bay, nothing else

msg:The hotel environment is very good. Although it is said to be an old hotel, the decoration is luxurious and upscale. The greening is very good, with various trees and large lawns. The beach outside the hotel is also very beautiful. I personally like this kind of beach with reefs. The waves are big and it feels good to take pictures. Jessica Jiajia's service attitude is very good. She accompanied me throughout the check-in at the front desk. She also helped me upgrade the sea view twin room to a deluxe sea view room for free. The room is clean, tidy and beautiful. Fruits and drinks are delivered every day. The balcony has a good view, and the sea and mountain views are all in sight. The room is also close to the beach. It takes only five or six minutes to walk to the sea. In addition, I have to mention the beautiful infinity pool. The children played very happily in it and saw a mermaid performance. It happened to be my family's birthday when I stayed in the hotel, and the hotel also gave me a 6-inch birthday cake for free! In general, I was very satisfied with this stay. The hotel's facilities and services are very powerful and worth the price.

The children had a great time playing in the swimming pool. The room was large and the facilities were good. The housekeeper was also very considerate and met our needs. Because the flight was cancelled and we were stranded in Sanya, we applied for a late check-out. The family experience was great

St. Regis has a good environment and proactive service. Suitable for adults.
MGM is just a children's amusement park, not suitable for adults.
MGM proactively asks for good reviews, but St. Regis doesn't.
Must proactively give St. Regis a good review.

Disadvantages: St. Regis's food and beverage is low cost-effective, and there is basically no beach

I hesitated for a long time between Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis, and finally chose St. Regis. I am very glad for my choice. It's the most satisfactory hotel to stay in during my trip to Sanya! First of all, the room type was upgraded for free. The housekeeper Fanfan was patient and careful. No matter what I asked, he replied very quickly. He didn't ignore it because the room price was low in the off-season. Every staff member was very polite. This place is very suitable for couples to travel. Compared with the noise of Atlantis, I prefer the quietness and comfort of St. Regis! I will choose to stay again when I come to Sanya! Finally, I would like to praise the travel photographer. The photos are very good. The original photos are too ugly. I added 300 yuan to ask for 10 photos of fine-tuning. I am very satisfied. Finally, the breakfast donuts üç© are delicious!

msg:I have long wanted to come to Yalong Bay to experience the St. Regis Hotel here. It is not only of high quality, but also has a beautiful seaside location. The hotel park has a unique design style and its own private beach, which fully enjoys the visual senses. The hotel's service is the most respected. The housekeeper Lucas contacted us one day in advance, asked about our needs, and upgraded our room to a full sea view room on the top floor, with a very good view. When we checked in, he also accompanied us to the room and explained the use of the room facilities in detail. I would like to thank Lucas. In addition, the receptionist at the hotel front desk was also very professional and patient, like a spring breeze. The supporting facilities in the room are very good, the bed is very comfortable, and the shower head has sufficient water pressure, which is especially good. The only regret is that the background light of the ceiling in the room cannot be completely turned off. It is still on when sleeping at night. Considering the long maintenance time, the engineer helped us to temporarily cut off the power first, and then thoroughly repair it the next day. I also hope that the hotel can carefully check the facilities and equipment before guests check in.

I like landscape photography and hope to take photos under the shadow of the sunrise during my stay at St. Regis. Reef scene.
Although I only stayed at St. Regis for one night, I not only harvested photography works, but also really fell in love with St. Regis. The hotel is very unique in terms of architectural features, decoration style, hotel environment, catering, etc. It left an impression on me. The most impressive thing is the hotel's service, which is enthusiastic, professional, thoughtful and meticulous~ Especially the customer service supervisor Fiona Xiaoli is the best account supervisor I have ever met. I will choose to stay at St. Regis next time I travel to Sanya, not just for filming.

(The hotel covers a very large area and is very suitable for vacation)
The outdoor lawn is really great, and the distance of 100m is very healing
The beach and green grass near the sea are very comfortable
The service level can be said to be quite high, the breakfast is very delicate, and the service staff are professional and have a good attitude!
The coconut chicken hot pot at the seaside in the evening is great and tastes great
8 or 9 o'clock Beach bar... Quite romantic

msg:If St. Regis was the first hotel we stayed in, it would have been rated good. But this was the last of the four hotels we stayed in. Compared with the previous hotels, St. Regis was really disappointing. It could not be more than passing. If you don't buy a villa, there is no service at all. The staff we met in the park also looked unhappy. The butler service only said that they would report it to the relevant depar**ents. The breakfast room was a mess, with more than a dozen guests waiting at the door and empty tables in the restaurant. What was shocking was that even the activity of digging crabs on the beach had to be charged extra. I won't come again.

msg:This is the first time I write a bad review on Ctrip. I really can't help but vent. I stayed here with my baby for three days, and the average cost was 1,800 yuan a day. With this quality, I will never stay in St. Regis again in my life. Breakfast is as shown in the picture, and the queue starts at 9 o'clock. The arrangement is extremely chaotic. The quality of breakfast is probably not as good as that of a fast hotel, and it is almost never replenished. The only freshly made egg pancake has a long queue.
The baby crib provided by the hotel is very bad, iron and thin, and the children's toilet, disinfection cabinet and footrest provided are also of poor quality. You can show it off without feeling that it is a failure.
Such a large hotel only has one swimming pool, and the others are decorations and not open. If you are with a baby, I highly, highly recommend it. It is really a huge gap from Yanlord Crown and Leeds.

When you arrive at the hotel lobby, there will be a concierge to help you pick up your luggage, give you a luggage tag, and send you to your room later. After you check in, there will be a dedicated housekeeper to take you to your room. Introduce the equipment and functions of the room, the mini bar is free, and there is almost no bottled water. I went out for a walk in the afternoon, and the water was put in the refrigerator. When I came back, I found that it was turned down, and I filled up the water on the table, and the bedside Added a bottle on the side. Our room is in the west wing, which is a little far away. The housekeeper‚Äôs WeChat communication responses are also relatively timely. This month, most of them are with children, and it is probably even more so in the peak season. Since the hotel has privacy, the location is naturally not as good as In the downtown area, it's good to go around and rest in your room during the day. You can't eat in restaurants on the street when it's time to eat. The hotel's restaurants are generally not cheap, but takeout is quite convenient. I usually don't order takeout, so I think The speed here seems to be a little faster than in ordinary cities. The breakfast is rich in variety, there are not too many seats, and there is no need to queue in this season. The taste is average. All in all, staying here is an unexpected experience.

msg:I did a lot of research before coming here, and carefully studied all the hotels in Yalong Bay. I was torn between Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis. Finally, I chose St. Regis. After coming here, the experience was very good, both the environment and the service were worthy of praise.
Room: I chose a deluxe sea view room, which is a side sea view and is on the seventh floor, so the sea view position is also good. The room decoration standard is high, the hardware facilities are good, and it does not feel old because of the age of the hotel. It still feels luxurious and has a tone.
Service: After checking in, the housekeeper Ella Xiaoqiu provided full service, informed that there was a birthday, the room had birthday decorations, and also gave cheese-flavored birthday cakes and daily fruits, which was very considerate.
Environment: Yalong Bay is the most beautiful bay. The hotel has a beautiful environment and you can enjoy it in the hotel without going out all day.
I chose the travel photography given by the hotel. I was very satisfied with the photos and couldn't help choosing a lot of negatives.

I regretted going to Haitang Bay for the next two days. Unless you go to the duty-free shop, there is no need to go there. The sea view and hotel environment are not as good as Yalong Bay. Water sports are a bit expensive in Yalong Bay. A jet ski costs 179 yuan for only 5 minutes. It is much cheaper to go to Phoenix Island. A jet ski to the West Island for 2 hours on the sea only costs 1,000 yuan. Therefore, renting a car and driving yourself in Sanya is also one of the best choices.

This time I completely blocked the popular tourist attractions that I have visited many times, such as Tianya Haijiao, Nanshan Temple, Luhuitou, and Dadonghai. This time I carried my luggage and frequently changed hotels, experiencing the feeling of sleeping in a luxury hotel. The St. Regis Yalong Bay Resort is my second trip, and it is also the most amazing hotel for me. The hotel was upgraded for free to a super sea view room on the top floor with a retro decoration style, leaving me with many happy and wonderful moments. The sea breeze blew in my face in the morning and evening, walking on the large lawn in the public area, and enjoying the pleasant vacation time. The hotel's butler service was attentive and thoughtful, and the welcome fruits and WeChat care made me feel warm. I would like to express my special thanks to Zhu Haisheng, the concierge, for carefully answering my questions and requests and satisfying them to the maximum extent. This made me truly feel the full range of butler services throughout the hotel. Thank you again to the hotel for hosting Mr. Pan, very gentlemanly.

The hotel is a bit big and has more rooms. After leaving the pool room, you can enter a 75-square-meter room, which is really nice. This is the right place to stay in a hotel. Lunch is served on the third floor. Of course, the price is also very good (later I saw that the hotel can also provide takeout delivery). The hotel has some built-in items, üö£, sailing boats, and yachts, which I didn‚Äôt have the chance to experience.

You can go to the beach to watch the sunrise at around 7 o'clock the next morning. If you choose a room with a high view, it will be very nice; the breakfast is also quite rich and filling. The pool room I booked cannot be tried due to weather and other reasons. It is a pity, but the considerateness of the housekeeper makes me very satisfied with St. Regisüëç

msg:A very satisfying experience. This trip went to Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula, Haitang Bay, Sanya Bay, and Yalong Bay. The last stop was at St. Regis. It was St. Regis that gave me the feeling of vacation. I felt the St. Regis when traveling during off-peak hours. It's so quiet. Walking from the St. Regis beach area to the MGM, the St. Regis beach is less crowded and beautiful. There is also a private beach area in the hotel. There is a reef area next to the beach with many crabs. I will bring it with me next time. Tools to catch the sea. This time our housekeeper was Fiona Xiaoli. She responded in a timely manner and even gave us a fruit plate. It was a great experience. After staying for three days, I still couldn‚Äôt get enough and didn‚Äôt want to leave. I look forward to returning to Astor Mansion to experience a vacation in the summer. wind.

Only guests can enter the hotel so they won't be disturbed, which is great! The sea view room I booked is facing the sea. The hotel is quite big, and I got lost several times on the first day. Fortunately, the hotel staff were patient and showed me the way. It was quite comfortable to lie down on the beach and bask in the sun. The housekeeper Jessica Jiajia was very considerate. She called in advance to communicate. When she learned that it was her birthday, she prepared a small cake and decorated the room. I was given a coconut as a gift on the first day of my stay. If I asked the housekeeper if I had any needs, I got a timely reply. It was a very comfortable experience! !

The room type also has a front view of the sea, so I finally stayed at the St. Regis that I had been thinking about for a long time, and it was also for my birthday. When I first arrived at the hotel, I was attracted by the hotel's mountain and sea view and lobby. It was really beautiful. When I checked in later, the housekeeper Lucas wanted to upgrade me to a room. I struggled with the room type for a long time, and finally chose the original one. , I am also very satisfied. The hotel also arranged honeymoon decorations and birthday decorations, birthday cakes, champagne, roses, in short, St. Regis can give you the sense of ceremony you should have! After dining at the seafood restaurant, it may be due to physical reasons, which caused me to feel a little uncomfortable after eating. The restaurant and the housekeeper Lucas frequently called us to give greetings and solutions. He kept asking us if we needed lunch and if we needed a light meal. , although I am not feeling well, my heart is still warm when I hear these! Thank you very much Lucas for all your help. I will still choose St. Regis for my future vacations!

Facilities: It has been a long-established luxury hotel in Yalong Bay for many years. The accommodation environment is still good now, but the facilities in the room are a bit outdated~ The house is very big, and every bathroom with a view has to be complained. Why is the toilet flushing blocked by the lid? of? ! What weird design?

Service: There are five rooms in total for our two families. When we were allocated, it was stated that we were staying together and were arranged in one room. However, my family of three and the elderly were fully qualified to be placed in the next room. There is a door in the middle that can be opened, but There is no arrangement in advance. Every time you take care of the elderly, you still need to go to a few rooms. If it can be improved, it will feel more humane! The housekeeping staff are very good. They come over once or twice a day to ask if you need anything. They are also diligent in cleaning the room! Ali Mire and Tang Zudong who served us were enthusiastic, polite and diligent~

Swimming pool: On the first day, the sun was shining and I played with the baby for a long time. It was a special feature~

Breakfast: There are too many people in Sanya during the Chinese New Year. I feel that the quality of the food is average and nothing special. On the morning of the second day of the second year, the number of people doubled and there were queues. Zaobo vinegar powder is my favorite breakfast at St. Regis.

msg:During this trip to Sanya, I stayed at the St. Regis Hotel for six days and had a very good impression. The scenery is beautiful, the environment is elegant, the food and accommodation are comfortable, and the mood is particularly comfortable. The reception staff were courteous and showed good character. Master Li, the travel photographer, is kind and enthusiastic, gives accurate guidance, works tirelessly, and is serious and responsible. We are very satisfied with the photos he took. Especially the housekeeper Candy, who greets me morning and evening, and provides warm, thoughtful and meticulous service. She really answers all questions and responds to all requests, making people feel at home. We have already recommended it to our relatives and friends. If you go to Sanya, you must go to St. Regis.

From before check-in to check-out, the housekeeper provided help and coordination, and was meticulous. The housekeeper would promptly remind you of all key time points and precautions. I commend the housekeeper Vivian Xiaohu for her careful care. I will stay at this hotel again next time I come to Yalong Bay.

msg:This time I took two boys, one aged 7+ and the other 2 years old, to Sanya. They chose Yalong Bay because Yalong Bay is beautiful. After comparing many hotels, the St. Regis looks better from the online photos. It has a swimming pool, grassland, beach, and children's play facilities... The special feature is the St. Regis hotel butler. Exactly what I wanted. When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff took the initiative to put the gift box away for us and took it directly back to the room because the gift box was very big haha. Check-in in the lobby was on the sixth floor, and then we stayed on the sixth floor. A housekeeper added us on WeChat. I really have to praise the hotel housekeeper ELENA for meeting the reasonable needs of our family as much as possible. My husband‚Äôs birthday was that day, so I was not prepared. I asked the butler and arrangements were made immediately. The chocolate cake was delicious. Lunch supplements for children have solved a big problem for me. There is also a manor travel photo provided by the hotel. It should be natural, and the photos are really very natural. I really like the photos of this episode.

Service: I added housekeeper Nina Xiaoyue at check-in, who will introduce the hotel facilities, communicate in real time throughout the stay, and help make reservations in a timely manner.
The room includes three meals a day, and the hotel‚Äôs breakfast, lunch and dinner are both good. Yangzhi Manlu has good reviews.

msg:When accompanying an elderly person to Sanya for a vacation, Yalong Bay is the first choice. The St. Regis is a hotel with good facilities and services in Yalong Bay. The most impressive thing about this trip was the butler service at St. Regis. The butler who served us was Sherry Wen. She explained the hotel facilities very carefully, listened patiently to the elderly's requests, and brought us coffee and coconuts. The greetings before leaving were even more touching. We feel warm. We felt cold at the beach, and the service staff at the beach pool bar gave us shawls for the elderly. Thank you very much!
If there's anything that needs improvement, St. Regis' restaurant service still needs work. For example, the breakfast restaurant failed to arrange seats for guests, and they had to wait for half an hour after asking the service staff to deliver coffee. The breakfast varieties were also different from those of the St. Regis brand. Except for the Shajiang Pigeon, the products in the Chinese restaurant are average. Students who are looking forward to catering please consider it.
Of course, if you come to Sanya Yalong Bay next time, St. Regis will still be a hotel you will consider. I hope every stay will be a surprise.

msg:The next time I choose to vacation in Sanya is to stay at the St. Regis Sanya. The main reason is that the resort environment and official service of St. Regis make me have a great experience every time.
      The official service center contacted me in advance and confirmed my arrival time and check-in needs. I was familiar with the room I stayed in last time or a nearby room type, and I wanted to stay in the same room type. After arriving at the hotel, I quickly checked in and arranged the official Nina docking service. Many services and details throughout the process were solved by Nina's excellent service and quick response. Thank you very much! The overall stay experience is as good as ever, whether it's service, environment, or catering.
      Because I booked a exclusive full sea view room, I always book this room type every time I come to St. Regis because it can look directly at the sea, and you can see the sea from the room through the balcony floor-to-ceiling windows, and there is a lawn in the distance. , coconut trees, the feeling of the sea, the visual shock and comfort are great! This is also the most resort-like and comfortable hotel among the several TOP hotels I have stayed in in Yalong Bay. The overall environment is still very good. Compared with other high-end hotels, the hygiene is really good. This time we went to celebrate a birthday. Our considerate hotel service team arranged the room decoration and gave us a whole birthday cake. To be honest, the cake was really delicious (I celebrated my birthday at Rosewood Sanya the year before last and gave it as a gift. The cake was cut into a small piece. Although I didn‚Äôt have any special expectations, I can only say that it was still the grandeur of St. Regis).
       The environmental plus point of St. Regis is her large lawn on the coast, which is very well maintained! Although there are often events or weddings held on the lawn, I am still not "bald" yet, hahaha. Because I have stayed here so many times, I have seen several seaside weddings held by others at St. Regis. I think it is really romantic and beautiful.

It tastes good, the environment is good, and the price is very suitable.
Service: Special thanks to the housekeeper Junzove. The sunglasses were all in the hotel. I found them a few days later and sent them to me by express. It feels good to find them again! Next time I have the opportunity to take my family with me, I will choose St. Regis~

When there are a lot of people for breakfast, there is a slight queue, but the variety and products can meet the needs.

The butler Lucas patiently introduced us to the hotel from the moment we arrived at the hotel. Every staff member here is full of enthusiasm for their hotel. We have strong cultural confidence. The butler Lucas helped us carry our luggage into the room. To our surprise, we were upgraded to a sea view room for free. The welcome fruit minibar is like many hotels. The heated infinity swimming pool is definitely one of the must-see places. It is beautiful and famous in the hotel. While wandering around, I was also attracted by the culture of the hotel. I asked the butler Lucas if there was a souvenir shop. The butler directly gave me a cuff with the hotel logo. In addition, the breakfast here is very orderly. I have stayed in many five-star and even seven-star hotels in the past few days. Everyone went in to find a seat or even grab a seat. The St. Regis staff queued up and called all the guests in an orderly manner to ensure the order of the restaurant. This hotel is the most memorable and praiseworthy hotel in my trip to Sanya. Thank you St. Regis. Thank you Lucas for giving us an unforgettable memory of our trip!

msg:I heard that St. Regis is very high-end during my trip, so I made a temporary reservation at St. Regis. The room is very spacious and the layout is reasonable, but the overall environment is not as good as expected (we mainly compared it with Mandarin Oriental or Edition). The gap is a bit big. The garden is average, the swimming pool is average, and the price/performance ratio is not high. After checking in, I found that there were some problems with the equipment: I found that the water in the bathtub was very small when I checked in that day, and only one bathtub was filled in 20 minutes. Then I contacted the housekeeper and they immediately sent someone to repair it. The water pipes were repaired up and down, and a lot of sand and yellow water were released. After the repairs, the water was only a little bigger, but it was still not ideal. After the maintenance staff left, we discovered that the overhead shower was broken and could not be used when spraying water upwards. The hand-held shower sprayed water and was not easy to use, making bathing inconvenient. The next day we went to the spa to bathe. The housekeeper Candy asked me to change my room, but I thought it was troublesome so I didn't change. The housekeeper Candy was very responsible and asked the manager to contact me. She also gave me afternoon tea as an apology. I would like to thank Candy and the manager for their concern. Thank you. But the equipment in the room still caused us trouble. Also, the breakfast environment was small and crowded, and the experience was not good. The room was not breathable, and it was extremely cold outside, making dining uncomfortable. The old waiter who was collecting the plates bumped into me without even a single apology, which is understandable given the crowd. All in all, the dining environment is really bad. If it weren't for the steward's efforts, I wouldn't give it 4 points.

üßπSpecial praise to the cleaning aunt, who saw we had a baby and gave us extra water and garbage bags (for diapers). And every time it's enthusiastic.
They helped add fences, baby pillows, and booster stools in advance, but the crib is not recommended. It is a very traditional iron crib. There is no soft fence around it and it is a bit hard.
ü•êThe breakfast is average. You can add some Hainanese snacks, such as Qingliang and coconut rice. The cost should not be high. In addition, bibs are not required in the breakfast restaurant, but there are in the Chinese restaurant. The complimentary complementary foods and children's meals provided by the hotel are really great. The all-day meal package is very convenient and the baby meals are exquisite. The food in the Chinese restaurant tastes pretty good. The service is also very good.
I contacted the butler center three days before check-in. Unfortunately, the butler I contacted was not arranged when I checked in. I was a bit disappointed. The assigned housekeeper did not respond promptly in the next two days.
üíîThe room we checked in at the beginning was a relatively small one in the pool suite. Because we brought a toddler with us, the extra bed was placed in the middle of the living room, which caused the child to bump into it. In addition, the air outlet of the air conditioner is close to the inside, and the temperature is not as high as expected. In the morning, you will sweat in the room when there is direct sunlight; the shower head cannot be fixed. Although these are minor problems, they still affect the staying experience.
On the afternoon of the second day, I asked to change rooms and the experience was very good. The living room is large enough for walking, and the balcony is also larger, making it convenient to dry clothes.

msg:Staying at the St. Regis was really the best choice for my vacation. I have experienced the legendary old money style. Starting from the mountain view in the lobby, the overall a**osphere is elegant and simple, the crowd density is low, the hotel building design is spacious, and basically every room type can see the beautiful sea view. This time I upgraded to For rooms facing the front, open the curtains and you will see the vast and gorgeous sea. The hotel's lawn is super beautiful. The new moon rises after nightfall, the deep blue sky, green lawn, and the sea are so beautiful! The Internet celebrity swimming pool is square and connected to the coastline. The depth and buoyancy are just right, allowing me to swim in the water even though I have a foot injury. The room has a very high floor, and you can see the sea view from the bathroom, bathe or even go to the toilet. Sitting on the large balcony in the morning watching the sun rise and the waves sparkling on the sea is so happy. A must-stay hotel for future vacations.

The St. Regis Yalong Bay Resort üè®Awesome

Facilities: The facilities are very good. It has its own private beach. The pool room booked in the room has a wide view.

Hygiene: The hygiene situation is very good and can be cleaned at any time.

Environment: It‚Äôs a hotel that‚Äôs perfect for a vacation. I‚Äôll want to come back once I check in. It‚Äôs very photogenic. The infinity pool is a must-see!

Service: After checking in, there will be a private butler to provide attentive service. You can contact us via WeChat at any time to easily solve all your questions. The service is absolutely top-notch!
The person who served us was "Housekeeper Vivian Xiaohu," a very gentle lady. Because we had a late flight before leaving, she also helped us delay check-out for a while. The housekeeper gave us a five-star ratingü•≥
The service at St. Regis Hotel is really greatüëçüèªCustomers are treated considerately and attentively. Suitcases will be delivered to the room specially, and there will be someone to help when you leave!
The hotel's breakfast is also very rich. It is available until 11 o'clock at the latest. If you basically wake up late, you don't need to have lunch! Because of the off-season, there are not many people in the hotel, it is not cluttered, and the experience is great!
Will bring my family back again!

Cleanliness: The room is very clean and turned down every night
Environment: Not to mention the environment, the best location in the entire Yalong Bay, maybe the only one that can compare with St. Regis is Sun Bay.
Service: The housekeeping service is very good. Janet took the initiative to contact her before she checked in, and then assisted her throughout the check-in process. If there were any minor problems, she responded quickly and solved them.
You get what you pay for, especially in the off-season. It's great to go there. You can play on the small train and rainbow slide. The children have a lot of fun, and it's great for adults to lie down on the deck chairs.
I would also like to make 2 suggestions for the shortcomings: ‚ù∂The musty smell of the air conditioners in the two elevators in the east wing guest rooms is too strong, even spraying perfume can't cover it up. The pipes need to be cleaned thoroughly ‚ù∑The mattress is too soft for me After the response, the housekeeper quickly assisted in installing hard cushions, which I like, but the hard cushions were too hard, as if I was back in a college dormitory. It is recommended to get some soft and moderate cushions.

msg:The hotel is located on the edge of the Yalong Bay hotel cluster, which is quite quiet. It still takes some distance to walk from the beach to the nearest Ritz-Carlton (and the beach in Yalong Bay is not as easy to walk as Haitang Bay). Although it has been a few years, the hotel is well maintained, the rooms are large enough, the facilities are complete, and the hardware is good. This caused a big gap when I moved to the Shangri-La in Haitang Bay. The sea view in front of the hotel is very beautiful. You can see the glass sea at noon (but it must be very sunny). The hotel's breakfast is quite satisfactory, basically the same as a normal five-star hotel. There is no special area for children. There are more mosquitoes at night, so be sure to bring mosquito repellent. Daily minibar drinks were good, enough to drink and refilled the next day. Hotel prices have basically doubled during the National Day holiday, so some of the previously charged items were free, such as the Rainbow Slide at Marina Park (not interesting). There were fewer choices for dinner. I had a coconut chicken set meal, which felt a bit awkward, but the full moon and coconut breeze on the seaside during the Mid-Autumn Festival was worth it. Generally speaking, this hotel is not strictly a family hotel. It is more suitable for adults or older children, and it is also suitable for travel photography, because the scenery of the hotel is indeed beautiful and very photogenic.

msg:It is very necessary to write an objective and fair review, because I almost gave up on such a good hotel because of the bad reviews. I am very happy that I chose St. Regis, so that my first trip to Hainan was full of joy and surprises!
Needless to say about the hardware of the hotel, the grand and luxurious lobby with a strong Southeast Asian style makes the first impression almost overwhelming. After entering the room, the sea view outside the window contrasts with the layout of the room. It‚Äôs like a thousand-year rush. Whether my description is an exaggeration or not, you will know by experiencing it for yourself! I booked an ordinary garden view room on Ctrip, but the hotel was very considerate and upgraded it to the best sea view deluxe room and harbor view room for free. I am not only happy but also happy!
Everything in the newly renovated hotel is brand new, with no trace of oldness or dirt mentioned on the Internet. The automatic doors always open just right, which is a detail that adds a lot to the beauty.
What cannot be omitted to praise is the hotel's service. It's like taking a breath of spring breeze. Yes, that's what it feels like! The hotel's butler-style service is considerate and makes you feel at home! While writing this review, I couldn't help but see the sweet smile of my housekeeper, "Vivian Xiaohu". Here, I would like to sincerely say thank you. It is a blessing for the hotel to have such a good employee like you! I wish you success in work and happiness in life!
Finally, I must mention the travel photography service provided by the hotel. I don‚Äôt know how to praise it. I am short of words and can only say it‚Äôs great! You will know how it works by looking at the photos.
Next time I come to Hainan, St. Regis will be my best choice. I hope this comment of mine will be helpful to you guys.

In the past few years, if there is no problem with the epidemic, I can go to Sanya.
I‚Äôve stayed at many hotels, but the only one I check twice every time is the St. Regis.
The one I want to praise the most is my butler Theo ~
The handsome boy is my reason for countless second brushes
The smile is warm, the work is careful, and the attitude towards customers is really great! I said that when I come to my birthday room, the cakes are prepared early. If the room is available, I will be checked in early. Anyway, it‚Äôs just like going home.
The hotel occupies a large area and is one of the best in Yalong Bay. The garden view and sea view we stayed at this time are very good. Everyone can experience the same. The various facilities in the hotel make me not want to go out. Order fried ice, play in the water in the hotel, and catch the sea with beach chairs! If everyone is unhappy, just rush in! In life, no matter what choice you make, you will make mistakes. Don‚Äôt waste this ticket. Carpe diem~ And one last point. I didn‚Äôt get the beef noodles for breakfast this time. Can I come back next time? It‚Äôs really delicious! ! !

msg:At present, St. Regis can only be said to be a good value for money. The room area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSt. Regis is quite large, the bed in the twin room is large enough, and the bedding is not bad, but the hardware is a bit broken, mainly the shower and air conditioning are a bit poor. The noise is also super loud, the buzzing sound will stay with you all night. I personally feel that the current sanitary conditions at St. Regis are not up to standard. I killed several mosquitoes during my stay, and there were a lot of mosquitoes in the rooms and public spaces. After staying in Sanya for ten days, all my bags were bitten by St. Regis. Everyone complains about the breakfast at St. Regis. I personally tested it once. In fact, the breakfast style and quantity of St. Regis are not small, but the taste is a bit hard to describe. In fact, breakfast is very important as a resort hotel, and as a top hotel in Yalong Bay It's also puzzling that breakfast remains the same. Finally, let's talk about the hotel's service. Overall, the service is not uniform. Some depar**ents and positions are really good at providing service, are warm and thoughtful, and always address customer needs. However, some positions are very indifferent, and some can even be described as bad. Moreover, the staff encountered in the hotel, except for the greeters and front desk staff, did not take the initiative to say hello to the guests when they met. This is currently only the top hotel in Sanya. Reggie didn't do well. The overall experience at St. Regis is that if you want to experience a top resort hotel, you can consider St. Regis if you have a low budget. After all, the room size and the appearance of the hotel are still very good. If you have enough budget and want to experience a better vacation experience, you can consider Capella, Edition and Park Hyatt. The overall vacation comfort will really be better!

msg:This time I booked a swimming pool room at St. Regis, which is very cool, and I can get into the water anytime! The room is also very large, the double bathtub is really convenient, the shower room and the bathtub are also very large!
The St. Regis Beach on a sunny day is really beautiful, which perfectly interprets what is called blue sea and blue sky! The infinity pool is great!
Staying in the hotel and sending follow-up photos, it is worth it!
The butler service is meticulous from booking to check-in. Fruits, snacks, and cakes were delivered shortly after we got the certificate. Special thanks to our butler Connor!
The only downside is that when we checked in, someone was selling dinner all the time, which affected the experience a little bit, but the flaws are not covered up!

The butler service is still the highlight of St. Regis. Erics Xiaoyao's service this time is still very good, and all arrangements are in place. I will continue to choose St. Regis when I come to Sanya in the future!

msg:St. Regis is also our favorite hotel with our children. Although the time is not short, but the maintenance is still good. St. Regis's decoration style, regardless of whether it is in your opinion or not, from the furniture to the faucet, reflects the high quality of real materials everywhere, which is a typical style of American high-end hotels. Parent-child is also a good choice, beach activities, mermaid show, small train tour...
We are very satisfied with the Green used in St. Regis‚Äôs travel photography, and the extra selection price of 20 per piece is very good. Do not use Bojue 80üòÖ. Our butler is Tayier, a sunny and handsome guy from Xinjiang. The day before the check-in, I took the initiative to add WeChat to arrange the check-in, and after arriving at the store, I enthusiastically accompanied the arrangement, which improved our check-in experience! 5 points praise ‚ô•Ô∏è

msg:The overall environment of St. Regis Yalong Bay is still full of old-money style. The sea view rooms have great views, the room layout is reasonable, and the facilities are slightly old, but they are still comfortable ~
    The overall view of the hotel is pretty good, and there are some family-friendly amu*****t facilities, but the small train and the rainbow slide are all charged separately, which seems a bit petty, but the passenger flow is well controlled, and there is basically no need to queue. Very good experience
    You need to queue up for breakfast after 9 o'clock. The restaurant is very small and the management is chaotic. Even in the off-season, the experience is still very poor. The dishes are very average. There are not many varieties and some of the more popular ones, such as dirty buns, will not be replenished if they are gone.
    The complimentary luxury yacht going out to sea is just a gimmick. If you can't help but go, don't go. It takes 15 minutes to sail, stay at sea for 1 hour, and gather together while watching a bunch of yachts parked there. If you don't do water sports, it is a waste of time.
    Finally, the service is really very poor, not even comparable to lower-end hotels such as Intercontinental and Marriott.
    The St. Regis has fallen off the altar. It is very cost-effective in the off-season and can be experienced. However, the service-focused hotel is definitely not worthy of the standard of a luxury hotel.

The bedding is very comfortable and the pillows are soft. I told the housekeeper that they gave me a memory pillow quickly, and I was finally able to sleep well. The room smells good, there is no musty smell, and the distance from the seaside is beneficial. The facilities are a bit old, but I still like the style. This is the main reason for choosing St. Regis. Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings. The hotel swimming pool does not provide adult arm sleeves or swimming rings. You need to buy or bring your own, which is not friendly to adult landlubbers.


Environment: The slope of the hotel's beach is a bit high. It is not as good as the sand in Sanya Bay. It is full of rocks and gravel. The waves are very big and it is a bit scary at night. Hahahaha. Due to the weather, I did not take pictures of the blue sea.



Service: From hotel check-in to check-out, the staff will take the initiative to say hello and enthusiastically help. The housekeeper Janet is very considerate. She is a kind-hearted person, the service is super good, and the response speed is very fast.

The butler tayier, a handsome guy from Xinjiang, asked carefully before check-in, arranged carefully, and provided thoughtful service.

The restaurant thoughtfully arranged mosquito repellent for the lawn seats, David, the manager of the western restaurant, gave us champagne, and tayier sent us a cake, which made the whole birthday dinner more perfect.
St. Regis's private beach is also beautiful and an unforgettable experience.

Although I suffered from a wave of physical discomfort when I first arrived, I spent two days in the hotel besides staying in the room. I wandered around the garden and the beach for a while, but I was still attracted by the buildings and the seaside style. During this period, the housekeeper Juli asked about my health from time to time, and was able to respond promptly when necessary. Therefore, although this trip has "a fly in the oin**ent", Not really a pity.

msg:I was going to take my two children to play in the water and sand by plane. One was five and a half years old and the other was less than two years old. Before departure, I looked at the average hotel for a long time and compared which hotel to choose, and finally chose St. Regis. When I arrived, I found that I didn't encounter any bad reviews at all. There was nothing wrong with it except that it was expensive. I feel that the hotel is not old but has a heavy feel. The service is really good. I can't say hello anytime I meet the staff. The butler is always available on WeChat. I don't remember who my butler is. He comes to the room every day and asks me what I have. Yes, the guest room comes to us every morning and evening to ask if we need to do some cleaning. The room is clean every day. The response to any needs was very timely, especially the mineral water pipes (my mother was very happy and wished she could wash her hands with mineral water), baby food two meals a day, and fruit drinks and coffee in the room every day (actually we are not used to drinking it, but there is no such tea Tea), there are many children's facilities, just ask the housekeeper to get them (someone said before that they won't offer them, I think it's okay, just ask). The hotel is really huge. Maybe the east wing is not open during the off-season. I originally booked a garden-view suite, but the front desk recommended that I upgrade to the sea-view swimming pool. A housekeeper took me to the room (it was really far), and I was amazed when I entered the room and opened the electric curtains (the air conditioner in the room had been turned on early, it was very cool, and there was no smell). My daughter wanted to jump into the swimming pool right away üòÇ, but it was okay to soak in the pool on the balcony. It's such a luxury to enjoy the sea view. The lawn is very soft, which my son likes very much. The beach is clean and delicate, and there is an infinity pool. It is really a paradise for children. Takeaway is also available, you just have to go to the takeaway counter in the lobby to get it. Food, drink and fun are all taken care of, this is what a hotel should be like. If I couldn't afford to live here anymore, I would really be reluctant to come back. (It‚Äôs really possible to take travel photos, and you can create paintings at will)

But as a luxury hotel on the same level as the Ritz, Yalong Bay has a ceiling level, the breakfast is really too ordinary, the quality of the ingredients is average, the juice is only freshly squeezed watermelon juice and cantaloupe juice, the fruit is average, the freshness of the whole fruit is average, and there is no coconut. It‚Äôs not as good as Kimpton Suzhou, and the quality of pastries is average. The breakfasts of Grand Hyatt and Edison are better than here.

We checked in in about half an hour, and Ritz waited for about an hour and a half; followed by the luggage delivery, St. Regis said that the luggage had been delivered after we arrived at the room, and Ritz waited for more than half an hour for the luggage to arrive at the room; Personally, the room doesn‚Äôt feel outdated as mentioned in the reviews.

Ascending to the lobby, the strong wind blows, overlooking the bay view, green water and green mountains, looking back, the concierge greets you, it is shocking. I thought the view of the bay would not be so good by the sea, but the blue-green water waves are beautiful in front of the mountain, which is unexpectedly beautiful. When you arrive at the lobby, looking at the central axis from a distance, you can see the grassland, coconut trees, fountains and the sea, which is a pleasant scene. Overall, after checking in, the hotel's sea view and grassland are really nice and impressive, but there are still some problems.
The cleaning of the room was a bit delayed when we checked in. I hope you can truthfully inform the time when it needs to be cleaned, and don't postpone it many times.
I have booked kayaking before, but when I visited the hotel, the service staff said that kayaking was boring and not worthwhile, and then recommended other items, which made me feel very bad.
The overall space of the hotel is divided a lot by charging items, including some beautiful places by the sea. I feel that other hotels are not like this, and it is clearly stated that I have to charge.
The sound insulation of the room is not good, and there is no active distribution of toilet water.
The various adjus**ents and greetings before check-in are quite professional, and the service staff are also very polite and enthusiastic. The breakfast is also good, and the washing and care is easy to use. Maybe the hotels in Yalong Bay are more suitable for parents and children.

The housekeeper tried his best to arrange early check-in and late check-out for us. The floor arranged the best location on the highest floor of this room type, which is especially convenient for the elderly and children to travel! The good thing about St. Regis is that the service is good. Fortunately, the room is comfortable, the bed is big enough, very clean and quiet! Will stay again next time! Full of vacation feeling!

msg:The overall hotel is very old money style, both public areas and room facilities have a vintage feel, well maintained, and the overall living experience is comfortable and happy. Worthy of being an established luxury five-star hotel.

The beach is beautiful and well-equipped, and we spent most of the day in that area, enjoying ourselves. It seems wrong to blame Sanya, in fact, its sea view is not inferior to Southeast Asia. You can swim in the sea, which is better than Haitang Bay. There is a sea activity center exclusive to the hotel by the sea, which is not beautiful except for the price, but it is close at hand, so there is no need to worry about it. There is also a swimming pool with a sunshade. This should be a localized facility. It is very suitable for people who like to soak in the pool but are afraid of getting sunburned. The breakfast is very rich, better than the previous hotel we stayed in. The light meals in the lobby bar and the drinks in the beach bar are also of good quality. You can go to Dianping to buy coconuts, and the price is much more beautiful than direct hotels.

Thanks to the housekeeper, Xiaomeng, who is very helpful and considerate. I would also like to mention Mia in the lobby bar, a little girl with dimples, who offered me a glass of lemon when I was sitting at the bar after a simple meal. Shui Lai always has a sincere smile on his face, which impresses me very much. The husband and the child injured their feet while playing football on the lawn. The staff at the beach service area took the initiative to bring us sterile cotton swabs and band-aids. Afterwards, the on-duty manager Kevin also took the initiative to call us to ask about our situation and whether we needed to be sent to the doctor. He was meticulous and thoughtful. But to be honest, the waiters in other areas are a bit poker-faced. When I went to the breakfast room for breakfast, I was full of joy and thought it should be a sunny breakfast by the sea, but I was taken directly to a dark room, communicated with two waiters, and asked to go The seats outside were coldly rejected and ignored. In comparison, the host on the second day was much more considerate, and arranged seats outside for us without making us wait for a long time. When ordering food at the lobby bar or the barbecue bar at night, I feel that the service staff repeatedly emphasized that we have to wait a long time for this dish and that dish, which feels a bit strange.

Overall, I feel that the hotel is worth the money. If the service staff can smile and be more friendly, then we don‚Äôt need to go to Southeast Asia at all. St. Regis can meet all our expectations for vacation.

We originally planned to stay in a water room for two nights, but we wanted to live in a sea view room temporarily. We explained our thoughts to Erics, and immediately upgraded us to a sea view room for free, and experienced two different rooms for two nights. The play room is also very cozy. The room is decorated with children's tents and rocking horses. The bathroom is equipped with small toilets and floor mats. The children have a great time playing and completely free their hands. It is also very convenient to go to the toilet and wash their hands, anytime, anywhere Swim and spend quality time with Dad! The hotel experience this time was perfect! By the way, the breakfast is also very rich and delicious!

The hotel room is very large, and there will be fruit gifts when you check in, and fruit gifts in the afternoon. From the porter to the check-in are very polite, timely and efficient.
The bed is a 1.5-meter bed, the bedding is very comfortable, and there are drying racks in the yard, which is very user-friendly. There are a lot of people for breakfast. If you go late, you need to queue up. When you arrive at noon, you can order separately at the Chinese restaurant. The taste is average, and the overall satisfaction

msg:Very nice hotel. Before coming here, I was struggling between MGM, Ritz, and St. Regis. After thinking about it, the child is less than two years old, and he is very happy with sand, water and toys, so I passed MGM. St. Regis is located at the end of Yalong Bay and has better privacy, so I chose St. Regis.
First of all, the service is worthy of recognition. The most impressive thing is the two times. Once, I asked the concierge in the lobby for the pick-up price to the nearby Baihuagu Commercial Street and Haitang Bay Duty-free Shop. In my opinion, the price is not expensive, but I ran into the butler LEO when I was preparing to travel. He suggested that I take a taxi by myself. There is not much difference in convenience. Secondly, the price will be much cheaper. The second is that travel was inconvenient due to the impact of the typhoon on the second day of the holiday, so I temporarily decided to have coconut chicken at the hotel‚Äôs Xiu restaurant for dinner. It was difficult to arrange a table because there was no reservation. At this time, a man who thought he was a passerby (probably the restaurant manager or hotel management staff) immediately asked the waiter to arrange a seat for us. While I was sorry to the waiter, I also felt the top-down service concept again.
Secondly, let me talk about my feelings about the hotel‚Äôs environment and facilities. The hotel has been built for a few years and has been renovated in the middle. The old range is acceptable, and there is a sense of historical precipitation (but generally speaking, the bones are not as good as those on the Bund, hahaha). The facilities are always crowded with children, and the overall sense of vacation is full. What makes me feel most comfortable is that the hotel has a private theater (remember to ask the butler to make an appoin**ent in advance) to simultaneously screen blockbuster movies. Of course, the effect is definitely not comparable, but! yes! Next to the theater is an indoor children's playground, where children can play there and watch movies by themselves! (You can bring your own drinks when watching a movie, and the popcorn you eat is also pre-packed and disassembled in an open bucket)
Finally, regarding the room, we have three dozen and one small, so we booked a two-bedroom sea view room with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã180 square meters, but it may only be possible to fit this room type in the corner, so although the front faces the sea, the balcony is closer to the rooms of other guests behind the corner, which slightly affects privacy. Secondly, although this room type is relatively large, only the master bedroom has a balcony, the living room has a window, and the second bedroom has no window (because of mosquitoes and personal safety, remember to keep the doors and windows well). The overall room equipment and facilities are sound, hygienic and clean, and some staff members even wonder why we don't wear hotel bathrobes hahaha. In addition, there are climbing mats, toys and small tents for babies.
Overall comment: Good service, good a**osphere, good environment, but the beach. . . It may be at the end and near the mountain. It can be played but not delicate, and the impact is not big. The area for diving into the sea is limited, please pay attention to safety.
Digression: The lobby is on the 6th floor! ! Don't go to the 1st floor, that's the parking lot and private cinema, gym, go-kart and spa, and go down from the west wing guest room! Buffet breakfast and other meals are on the 3rd floor! ! Try to stay in the East Wing rooms, the West Wing rooms only have gardens and small animals, and the East Wing has an interesting swimming pool! For meals, you can go to the nearby night market and Baihua Valley, which are economical and delicious~

msg:This five-day and four-night trip to Sanya for a family of three, St. Regis is really satisfying! No matter from software or hardware, you must give full 10 points!
    In terms of service: Leo, the housekeeper, contacted me on WeChat in advance, and the service is very enthusiastic and active! Any needs can be responded and resolved in a timely manner. Because the return flight in the afternoon was relatively late, they also helped us apply for an hour-long check-out! The beauty Chanel is also very nice. She led us to the room, gave us a lot of fruits, and explained to us a lot of related routes inside the hotel! Every reception at the entrance of the hotel is very polite. Every time they meet, they will greet each other with a smile, and every time they take the initiative to help open the door and carry luggage! The aunt who cleans the house is also very nice, and reminded us to drink the drinks in the freezer every day, saying that only after drinking will there be refills! so cute!
    Hotel room: We booked the most basic garden-view twin room. We asked for a higher floor, so we arranged for us to live on the sixth floor. Although it is a garden-view room, we can see the distant view from the balcony. As for the sea, the landscape of coconut trees is also very beautiful! Let‚Äôs talk about the room: what attracted me the most at Ding Ruiji was the super large twin beds, each bed is 1.5 meters, and it is very comfortable to bring an 11-year-old child to sleep! There is also an oversized bathroom, an oversized balcony, and it is very convenient for three people to wash up separately! And there are no mosquitoes at all, very clean!
    Hotel environment: St. Regis's lobby is very grand, with an oversized canopy, you won't get in the rain when you get on and off the car, not to mention St. Regis's garden and sea views, Yalong Bay is definitely the top three! The sand on the beach is fine, and it is very comfortable to step on it with bare feet. There are not many people, it is very quiet, and there is no need to fight for deck chairs! There are two large swimming pools, one is an open-air infinity pool, and the other is a swimming pool with a large roof and slides, which children especially like! It can protect from sun and rain! At the beginning, I was worried that St. Regis was in the innermost part of Yalong Bay, and the transportation would be inconvenient. Only after I went there did I know that there is no need to worry! Taking a taxi in Sanya is so convenient, it arrives almost in seconds! It is also very convenient to order takeaway! Whether it's ordering food or drinks or buying medicine or daily necessities, it can be delivered quickly! Take a taxi to Baihuagu for dinner, about 12 to 15 yuan. You can also visit the night market!
   (The following is the 11-year-old daughter's evaluation of the St. Regis Hotel--
     Hotel scenery: The sea at the St. Regis is really blue (‚Ä∫¬¥œâ`‚Äπ) and it is super easy to make a film, there are not many people, and it will not be crowdedüòä You can also apply for free travel photography, ten photos, no cost! There are more than 20 deck chairs on the beach, and more than a dozen sunshades. After playing tired, sitting on the deck chairs and watching the sea view, blowing the sea breeze, is really very comfortable and comfortable! There are also two swings facing the sea on the beach closer to the hotel! The one on the left is very suitable for travel photography, so you may have to wait a few minutes to sit on it (as long as you invite travel photography, you will go there to take pictures) The swing on the right can easily swing high, and the sea view you can see from that swing is really spectacular ! You can also dig very delicate small shells on the beach~ Be sure to go to the infinity pool to take pictures, it is really very good! It is easy to capture the grandeur and sparkling freshness of being in touch with the sea! In addition, the St. Regis Hotel also has a large swimming pool with a roof. It is really refreshing to swim there on a rainy day! This large swimming pool is also connected to a slide. It is very refreshing and exciting to slide down from the slide, and you can even enjoy the thrill of flying in the rainforest! I have played it many times, and I have seen many children skating dozens of times with great interest! There are many swimming rings for rent next to the infinity pool, which is very convenient!

The housekeeper, Xiao Meng, contacted me in advance to understand my needs. Because I brought the elderly and children, I helped us arrange the room together in advance. When we checked in, because the previous guests had late check-out, Xiao Meng specially arranged another room for us. The room is for us to rest, and a bubble bath and drop-off service are also provided, which makes us feel very attentive! The room attendant Li Juan was also very enthusiastic during our stay, responsive to our needs, the room was cleaned very clean, and she took good care of the children. The scenery of St. Regis is still beautiful, the beach is delicate, the lawn and the infinity pool are very good for taking pictures. The best thing is that the children's pool has a sunshade and our favorite poolside room, which meets the needs of children who want to play in the water all the time. . I hope to make persistent efforts to improve the breakfast and expand the dining area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant. I will come again next year!

Hygiene: The room is generally clean, but there will be red wine stains or coffee stains on the sofa that are difficult to remove, I understand~

Environment: The environment of the hotel is very good. It occupies one end of Yalong Bay exclusively. It is relatively quiet. It is good to watch the sea quietly~ The beach is very long and you can walk for a long time~

Service: The overall service is very considerate. As a luxury hotel, the service staff are very good. During the 4 nights stay, there were occasional calls for room service, and the response speed was relatively slow~

msg:The baby is three years old, and it was the first time to go to the beach for vacation, and chose the Sanya St. Regis Hotel. Sure enough, the homework was not in vain. The location of the hotel is superior, in the innermost part of Yalong Bay, quiet and private.
The hotel's villa butler service is particularly brilliant. Two days before departure, the villa butler Adam added my WeChat to understand my various travel needs and help me book a pick-up. The baby stroller and the courier I bought online before were all delivered If you have any questions about the room, you will be able to respond to your needs, especially sometimes after work hours, if you have any questions at 22:00 at night, just ask him on WeChat, and he will help you arrange them.
There is no need to go out of the hotel here, which is enough to meet the needs of the whole family. There are rainbow slides by the sea, small trains by the sea, mermaid performances in the main pool several times a day, private theaters where you can watch movies that are currently being screened in theaters, harbor karts, indoor children's playgrounds, and more.
I booked a one-bedroom garden-view villa. The room is clean and cleaned twice a day. The hotel gave floating afternoon tea for two, two children's meals a day, immersive movie viewing, floating afternoon tea, and 10 travel photos.
The hotel's breakfast is also very good. If I come to Sanya next time, I will choose St. Regis.

My family's favorite thing every day is to soak in the swimming pool and public water slide that comes with the room. The design of the hotel is very thoughtful. The swimming pool has a roof, so you are not afraid of rain or sun. The water depth is just right for babies who can't swim. I also think the service of the hotel as a whole is very good. Before I checked in, the St. Regis personal butler contacted me to help out with travel suggestions. Our butler is Caesar, who is enthusiastic and has a sense of boundaries. The services and suggestions provided will make people feel very comfortable Very heartwarming. The catering, guest room, and concierge services are very courteous, and all the service staff are full of simple smiles and sincere care for the guests. I felt wowed throughout the trip. As for the hotel hardware, room facilities, and bathing equipment, I think they are all similar, which meet the standards of domestic super five-star hotels. I personally pay more attention to the overall service of the hotel and the feelings it brings to the guests. In short, next time I travel to Sanya, I should still choose St. Regis. Awesome! !

The glass swimming pool is very good for taking pictures. What I am not satisfied with is the shower room. The position of the shower head cannot be adjusted. The water is just facing the door, and the gap between the door is very large, so the water is easy to spill out. I like a puddle of water outside after taking a bath. Although I can use a towel to cover it, I have no choice but to turn the shower head to face the toilet surface of the bathroom, wasting such a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bathroom. Furthermore, the location is in the innermost place, and it is far away to go out to eat. Every time I have to take a taxi, although it is not expensive, only a dozen yuan, but I prefer to go out to eat nearby, and I can walk back after eating to digest and digest.

The location of the hotel is also very convenient. You can go shopping and eat in the lively market for about 10 yuan by taxi. This time we also watched a "booked" movie in the hotel, very happy. Next time I bring my son with me, I believe he will like it.

msg:Hotels that are very suitable for vacations, beaches, coconut groves, infinity pools, Meipai, surfing, paddle boards, and BBQ meet all modes of vacation, and you can really have fun without staying in a hotel. Caroline, the hotel villa manager, left a deep impression on me: she is humble, sincere, good at listening, and can feel the positive energy of the hotel management team. The hotel has been open for a long time, and the hardware facilities are still a bit flawed. The cooking fume emission in the semi-open kitchen of the restaurant needs to be improved. After all, the smell of cooking fume still affects the dining mood of the guests. But the flaws do not conceal the advantages, I still like it here! Relax, be comfortable, be at ease. In particular, his St. Regis tray service signature dessert is very delicious, don't miss it. Unfortunately forgot to take a picture. The quality of the gifted birthday cake is also very good, it is not just for gifting, thank you very much!

The bed fence pushes the cart They are all provided, and sand dredging tools are also provided in a friendly manner. If you check in, you can check in at about 1 o'clock, which is already considered fast. During the two days of stay, the butler Xiao Zhu was really nice! The replies are very timely! When I was bitten by a mosquito, I immediately provided toilet water. We also provided a flashlight when we were going to the beach, and helped with delivery, etc. When we finally left, I even gave my baby a small bag. Thank you very much. Retired from St. Regis this morning and stayed at Marriott. . Checked in at 12:30 noon, and there were a lot of people queuing up at the front desk. Standing check-in, compared to St. Regis sitting check-in. There are a lot of people in Marriott, so it's a bit noisy. The lobster set in the St. Regis set meal is not bad, and the quantity is quite large. Dianping sells 999 set meals. Sailing out to sea can also be experienced. The staff of the rainbow slide in the hotel are very good. Our baby is too young and wants to play again. The staff is also very good. There is no charge. Let us experience it once. Generally speaking, St. Regis is really good. The only pity Yes, it's been cloudy or rainy recently, the scenery is not beautiful enough, the sky and sea are not blue enough, but it is comfortable. The temperature is suitable, the sea breeze is blowing, so comfortable.

1. Rest assured St. Regis. The actual product is consistent with the picture, and there is no feeling of false propaganda. The room is spacious and bright, and the duvet cover is clean. There are also footstools and children's toilets for children, which is very considerate. The design of the hotel is good, the supporting facilities are complete, the public toilets are also very clean, and the design of the washbasin is small and eye-catching. In the room, pay attention to the water coming out of the shower head on the top when you take a bath when you test the water. If you don't take a bath by yourself, you will accidentally wet the person standing directly below.
2. The hotel staff will call in advance to confirm the check-in requirements, details and so on. After arriving at the hotel, the staff in the store will take the initiative to say hello, help with luggage and open the door, etc., paying attention to details. Especially thanks to the housekeeper Caesar (Xiaodai handsome guy) for his full service, which not only saves the travel time, but also improves the overall travel experience of the trip to Sanya. Don't worry! Special praise here üëç. I hope to meet your service next time I stay, haha!
3. Take a taxi at any time and you can drive directly to the hotel lobby, which is convenient, and you don‚Äôt need an umbrella to get on the car without worrying about wind and rain. (I don't know if other hotels are like this)
4. In addition, the breakfast is not very good, I feel pretty good, there are many kinds of breakfast, both Chinese and Western breakfast, full of happiness. Anyway, I am satisfied, üòÇ
Come to St. Regis again next time!

With a sense of freshness, although it rained in the first two days of my visit, it did not affect the mood of the game.

Swimming in the rain has a special flavor and feels a tropical The rainforest climate, the baby is very happy to play, St. Regis's scenery is good, the room is large, very suitable for parents and children, because it is big enough, things can be spread out, and the service is beyond words. We have not walked from the parking lot to the lobby, and there are already people. He came up and took the initiative to help us with our luggage, which made our parents feel very heartwarming. Our butler Kevin Ma Qingrui, a caring and enthusiastic handsome guy, started to introduce us to the general situation of the hotel and the bed that the baby needs. , The toiletries were delivered to the room as soon as possible, which can be said to be responsive, and they were all resolved immediately. The ecological environment of the hotel is really good. The baby didn't have a single mosquito in Sanya. I was worried about her allergies after being bitten by mosquitoes. It was completely unnecessary. St. Regis's food is also good, the breakfast is very rich, and the Chinese restaurant is also very appetizing to the elders. In short, it is very wise to choose St. Regis this time. We will choose this place again next time.

I like Janet, the butler of the St. Regis Hotel, who helped us coordinate services and was really thoughtful. She called us one day in advance to arrange room types, introduce meals and items, and even gave hotel discounts in duty-free shops. The most important thing is to prepare for the honeymoon decoration! A honeymoon cake (delicious!) was given away. It‚Äôs really a different experience to stay at the St. Regis at a more expensive price. Yalong Bay is absolutely luxurious. It‚Äôs a pity that the itinerary is only for one day. You can stay in a hotel with various facilities in the hotel for two days. I will bring my family again next time !

Facilities: I read a lot of reviews, and occasionally some guests said that the facilities are outdated. My experience of staying in is: everything is in place, and it is very high-end! I can feel that as a hotel opened and renovated in 2018, the level of decoration at that time is not outdated today, it is very rare, and the quality is extraordinary!

Hygiene: We stayed for three days and two nights, and the cleaning lady came to clean the room every day. When they saw that our bath towels were wet, they replaced them with clean ones. The floor was clean, and the bathtub and toilet were very clean!

Environment: Stepping into the gate of the hotel, the first feeling is the magnificent scene similar to the royal garden, no matter the hotel or the room, one feeling: big! And the green leaves üçÉ are great! Lots of shade on the beach! The infinity pool is really beautiful! Children's heated swimming pool, we took our two-year-old baby there, it's not cold at all!

Service: There is a feeling of being at home. First of all, the baby we brought, and our housekeeper: Xiaomeng called one day in advance and ‚ûï V letter to communicate about check-in matters, things needed, such as children's bathrobes, bed circumference, check-in, and dining habits wait. Knowing that the child is a two-year-old baby, I arranged the room in advance with special care to avoid delaying the child's nap when checking in at noon, and avoiding long waits. After checking in, he explained and asked carefully and patiently, and helped us into the room. If there is a problem, V Reply to the letter at any time, I remember he had a sentence, let us stay very moved:
"My philosophy is to go out and arrange it if I can take care of it. It's like being a guest at your own home. It's thoughtful~"
This sentence, he expressed it to me like this, and he did it vividly!
Sincere, warm and thoughtful service is great! It is recommended to find him! Xiao Meng!

There are not too many parent-child activities, which is very suitable for adults. It is a quiet hotel and there are not so many seaside activities, and the beach is not big. The lounge chair activity facilities on his beach are all on the beach, separated by vegetation in the middle. There are no lights on the beach below at night, it would be better if there are deck chairs by the beach. The overall beach sand in Yalong Bay is not very fine, only MGM is better. St. Regis has their characteristic mangrove kayak rowing. It took a total of one and a half hours for two people to row 500. It feels a little better than the other hundreds of minutes on the sea.

msg:A very happy trip. Before coming here, I made a lot of strategies for choosing a hotel. St. Regis is really worth coming again!
Two days before the arrival, the hotel staff called to find out the store time and check-in preferences. One day in advance, the housekeeper Kevin Ma Qingrui added WeChat. On the day of check-in, the receptionist helped check in, introduced the hotel and Yalong Bay's fun features, and helped arrange water sports, travel The car for shooting and sending to the airport is very warm and meticulous.
Location: St. Regis is in the south of Yalong Bay. It is one kilometer shorter from the hotel entrance to the lobby. It is not connected to other hotels, so the overall environment is very quiet.
Environment: The interior view of the hotel is very good, surrounded by mountains and sea, very close to the beach. There is a circular heated swimming pool in the middle, which is great for swimming, punching, taking pictures and resting.
Room: The room is very large, the door of the room is not close to the corridor, but on the side, so the sound insulation is very good, and the room is very quiet. The bathroom is very spacious, the balcony is very large, and the bedding is very comfortable.
Breakfast: The breakfast is very rich, and the open-air location is great. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery while having breakfast, but the restaurant is not very big. It is recommended to have breakfast before 8:30 or simply later to avoid peak hours.
Travel photography: The travel photography provided by the hotel is great, the quality is better than other hotels, and there is a call back after the shooting, but the shooting takes half an hour, which may be different from other hotels, and some take an hour, so it is best to talk to the photographer before shooting Communicate clearly. In addition to free films, additional charges are also more reasonable. If you don't want a set meal, it's 20 for a single sheet.
Catering: You can take a taxi to the nearby Baihua Valley, which is 3-4 kilometers away, for about 10 yuan. There are many things to eat there, and you will basically not step on the thunder.
Fun: The hotel is very close to the tropical forest park, and it is also very convenient to go to the water sports. You can contact the butler, and there will be a shuttle bus to the water sports center on the other side of the mangrove.

There are two pools, one is fun with a slide and the other is an infinity pool with a direct view of the sea. The housekeeper Xiaomeng received us and introduced us very carefully. He felt at home. He helped us upgrade to a deluxe sea view room according to the package. Because the flight time was relatively late, he helped us to delay check-out. It was a great trip!

msg:üöóTransportation:
To be honest, the traffic is not very convenient, basically you can only take a taxi~ You come to Yalong Bay to go to the hotel, so there is no problem going out when you take a taxi. The hotel provides a free duty-free shop shuttle bus~

üõèRoom facilities:
The room is about 40 square meters. The room facilities are nothing to say, super good, basically all electric, curtains, lights and so on.
There is a separate cloakroom, super nice, the bed and pillows are very comfortable~ the big electric fan can be turned on for fun, the bathroom has a large bathtub with a view, the only fly in the oin**ent is that the body lotion is mint-flavored, basically useless at night, too waking up Brain out.
The balcony is large, and there are racks for drying clothes. The design of the hotel is very reasonable, and the clothes are easy to dry.

üçöBreakfast:
The breakfast is average, with few seats. Basically, there is a queue at nine o'clock. The selections are average, and the freshly squeezed juice is good~
When you check in, you will get a fruit plate. The fruit is very good, and there are expensive fruits such as longan and grapes. The minibar is also free, there are drinks and wine, the hotel has a capsule coffee machine, very nice~
Brother Victor, our housekeeper, was very nice. He sent a fruit cake with strawberries and butter on it~

üèäüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSwimming pool
The hotel has a large open-air heated swimming pool, which is very fun~ There will be a mermaid show in the swimming pool after 11 o'clock, and the young lady swims very well. There is a bubble party around four o'clock, children can play~

üêö Beach:
There are many booms, wooden stakes, swings and so on that children can play on the beach. The quality of the beach is good, but there is only a small area where you go into the sea, and there are reefs in other places.

[Candy] Serving:
The service is very good and considerate, the room is cleaned quickly, and the bathrobes are changed in a timely manner.
The hotel has an exclusive butler. My butler is Victor. Before check-in, he will contact me to tell me the opening hours of various facilities in the hotel~ and where are the movies and so on.

msg:When I first arrived at St. Regis, I was very pleasantly surprised, because the hotel looked luxurious and grand, with a sense of age, and the housekeeper, Janet, arranged it very well. She was considerate and thoughtful. The room was huge, the cloakroom was huge, the bathtub was huge, and you could watch it while watching Take a shower while watching the TV. The decoration of the hotel is very British retro style, with a strong a**osphere of old money. I changed hotels three times during this trip to Hainan, and only Janet was the butler I met. Although the butler service in the first two hotels was very good Satisfied, but this kind of "sense of importance" that greets you as soon as you arrive at the hotel is still very useful to me, and after staying for two days, Xiaozhu will send me weather forecasts and play suggestions every day, and help me make an appoin**ent for sand digging toys The bubble bath with the children, and a small gift for the children when checking out, the service attitude is polite and thoughtful, I would like to give a big praise here!
Next, I will talk about the shortcomings of the hotel:
First of all, the attitude of the service staff is cold. If I didn‚Äôt go to Le M√©ridien to experience the service with a smile, maybe I wouldn‚Äôt feel too much. But I came to St. Regis just after I checked out from Le M√©ridien. , the contrast is too obvious.
The second is the constant temperature swimming pool. Although St. Regis's constant temperature swimming pool is very large and the temperature is very suitable, it looks nice and clean when taking pictures, but as a hotel of this size, it doesn't provide free swimming rings for children. Isn't that a bit too much, Weiss All the swimming rings and big white geese and turtles next to Ting and Amy's swimming pool are free to use. The first day I didn't know that I thought the swimming rings could be used casually, so I took one and put it on for the child to swim. A waiter asked me if I wanted to buy it. I was quite puzzled and said no, so I returned it. But when I went to play the next day, I found out that the swimming ring was for sale, so I bought one for my baby for 99.
The other one is that I heard that St. Regis has its own private theater that can show movies that are released at the same time. When I booked the room, I also considered this point when I booked his house. I thought it would be good to go to a movie after a tired day after playing with the baby. What I didn't expect was that there was a charge for watching movies, and it wasn't cheap.
, ÔøºThe Wandering Earth 2 costs 128/person, and it costs 98/person to keep you safe. I almost went there and then went back. I really can‚Äôt bear to spend this price to watch a movie. I‚Äôd better go back to Dalian and spend 35 to watch it by myself...
The last is the breakfast environment. Maybe there are more people in Yalong Bay than in Wanning. It is noisy in the morning, and there are very few tables with shades to eat outdoors, and there are few types of food. They don‚Äôt even have refreshments. The beef brisket noodles are not as good as Emmy's, very disappointed...
To sum up, St. Regis, as the first echelon hotel in Hainan, definitely has its advantages, but it can only be said that it is not suitable for me who is short of money, because almost all items have to pay extra, and these paid items In other hotels, it is all free! The price of the three hotels I chose this time is the highest, and it is also the one I am most dissatisfied with. Of course, I recognize the service of the butler, which is very good! I just don't like St. Regis's business model, but one thing to say, his fragrance smells really good, I'm going to look for the same one online!

msg:Ctrip flashed. Before arriving at St. Regis, the housekeeper added WeChat to ask about the room preference. I don‚Äôt like the elevator entrance and the end room. Everything else is fine. I booked a three-night garden view room at 6683. When I arrived at the store, I found Ctrip The price is 500 cheaper, there is no way, the room is floating, I blame myself for not paying more attention to the price every day.
The reason why I came to Yalong Bay is because the wind in Haitang Bay is strong, so I moved to Yalong Bay. The weather is indeed much better. It is not cold or windy at all. The hotel is really old. According to my son, it is a very old hotel. , but it can be seen that the maintenance is in place, and the floors in the public areas are spotless. Compared with Yanlord‚Äôs noisy children, St. Regis is very quiet and very suitable for vacation, especially for middle-aged people like me. The difference is that Yanlord‚Äôs children‚Äôs activities are free, and St. Regis has a lot of charging items, which basically require money. Of course This is also good, that is, the experience of paying money is very good, and no one will compete with you. We played go-karts, ATVs, speedboats, water propellers, etc.
At noon the next day, we went to check in at the Qinyuan of Park Hyatt in Sunny Bay for lunch, and also visited the hotel by the way. The Sabi St. Regis on the beach was good, and the children had a great time playing. Qinyuan has a 688 set meal for 3-4 people Very recommended, the taste, portion and service are comparable to Michelin, and it is very suitable for children.
On the first day of dinner, I ate the 788 set meal for two at Ruiji Mingxuan Chinese Restaurant. The taste was good, and the main dish was grouper. Later, I went to Huaqianyuexia Seafood Courtyard for dinner for two consecutive days. It is opened by people from the Northeast. The service is very good, the price is clearly marked, and it is generous and frugal. , It's much more cost-effective than hotels, and it doesn't kill people. I highly recommend it.
Overall, St. Regis's service is very good. There are too many children in Yanheng. It depends on personal preference. St. Regis is good if you like quiet. Next time I go to Yalong Bay, I will stay at Ritz and Park Hyatt.

The hotel upgraded to a superior sea view room after knowing my situation. It was still the highest floor with a wide view. On the night of check-in, the housekeeper Xiao Zhu also thoughtfully delivered a cake. The drop-off service when leaving the store is also thoughtful. I like the lush garden landscape of St. Regis, the rich buffet breakfast, the quiet and vast beach, and the unique glass swimming pool. The photos are beautiful. It is worthwhile to choose St. Regis

Our butler Xiaozhu/Janet is very thoughtful. There were some episodes in the middle. Xiaozhu also sent cakes. I either forgot to bring the key card or went to the wrong place when I went out. Xiaozhu was very patient and timely. Our flight time was very late , and applied for late check-out for us. After storing our luggage, we watched a movie in a leisurely manner before leaving. Everything was just right, and it was a very relaxing trip.

msg:Almost all the first-line hotels in Yalong Bay have stayed in it. This is the first time to stay at St. Regis, which is a very good experience! First of all, our housekeeper, Xiao Meng, was named in the front row. I just asked at a certain time, can I arrange the room? But when I went to check in, Xiao Meng said that our room type is not available yet and there is no time to arrange it. He directly upgraded the luxurious swimming pool for us. The room and the room has been furnished is a big surprise! When I was playing outside at night, I received a WeChat message from Xiaomeng, who also sent us a cake that was praised for its appearance and taste. It was a big surprise that the old couples were not on their honeymoon, and I was very happy! Thank you Xiaomeng for being a considerate and careful housekeeper.
The next day we booked the hotel‚Äôs mangrove paddle board experience, which was also a project that I personally blew up. It was very interesting to experience it in the big pool in Edison before, but it was really close to nature with St. Regis and shuttled through the mangroves. The experience ratio is still lost. This project not only tests my sense of balance, but also can see the fish in the Bailu River, and understand the natural knowledge of the mangroves. The whole trip lasts more than one hour and nearly two hours. We specially named our coach Xing who is very professional He was very kind to guide our technology and at the same time popularized a lot of mangrove knowledge with us and took dozens of photos and videos for us. My husband fell into the river three times hahaha he said that falling is also an experience. Don't miss this project when you come to St. Regis.
Finally, I would like to talk about a small flaw. The breakfast is actually not bad, but the service in the restaurant is a little bit behind. The table is full of leftover dishes that have not been cleaned up. The efficiency of outside guests starting to line up for breakfast needs to be improved.
In short, the whole trip can be said to be perfect, and I will recommend it to my friends when I go back.

The St. Regis Hotel (No. 1 Qingmei Road), which sits on the golden coast of Yalong Bay, is next to the Ritz (No. 2 Qingmei Road). It also enjoys a first-line sea view. The white sandy beach stretches for 800 meters. The mountains, rivers and seas meet, and the coastline is even more beautiful. charming.

The architectural design of the hotel is inspired by two intertwined dragons. The overall feeling of the interior rooms is exquisite and luxurious, which is somewhat old-fashioned. The hotel has been in business for more than 10 years, but it does not feel old at all. The newly upgraded central transparent constant temperature swimming pool has become a Internet celebrity check-in point, transparent mode for switching between day and night, occupying the C position of the St. Regis check-in point, with proper appearance~

The St. Regis cultural wall, which is not popular on the Internet, is like a small museum, highlighting the history and heritage of the legendary brand, the story of the founder Astor IV and the Titanic, the birth of Fernand and the Bloody Mary cocktail, which is the core of the Treasure Hotel. Bonus points, more reasons to love and love.

Butler service has always been a unique feature of the century-old St. Regis brand. Special thanks to our full-time butler Caesar Xiaodai. If you have any questions, you can contact him at any time, from room upgrades, catering reservations, late check-outs, to airport drop-off adjus**ents, and timely provision of hotel supporting information. They all tried their best to help and arrange it properly. The meticulous and considerate service felt very warm and comfortable, and it also made this St. Regis vacation trip more complete, memorable and happyüåπüåπ

First of all, I must praise the hotel's special butler service, which is not available in high-end hotels such as Atlantis, MGM, and Ritz-Carlton. It can be said that it provides us with a super sense of peace of mind.

He was already waiting at the front desk as soon as we arrived at the hotel, and he personally took us back to the room and introduced the room facilities and precautions. During the period, they provided us with hotel activities, entertainment and catering information many times, and specially equipped footstools for the children. You can feel the care and caring, which made us have a very pleasant experience at the beginning of this trip! If the butler can choose, then I will choose him next time I come to stay~

Secondly, the overall service of the hotel is also very good. On the first day of arrival, as soon as you enter the room, you can eat very fresh local fruits, especially the drinks in the minibar refrigerator in the room are free, such as cola, coconut juice, beer üç∫, fresh orange There are a lot of everything, and the capsule coffee ‚òïÔ∏è tastes very nice. I only had the experience in a luxury hotel like Atlantis before, but I didn't expect to have it here üëçüëç. Then, the decoration of the hotel and the accessories in the room are very high-quality. There are two types of slippers for dry and wet use, and the comfort of pillows and bedding is very high~

Finally, I have to say that the beach in the hotel's private sea area is not only fine sand, but also has a flat reef area, and the beauty of the bay landscape is unobstructed! The children's facilities and play area by the sea is also one of the children's favorite areas. It is particularly worth mentioning that the 27-degree constant temperature swimming pool is rare. When the temperature is not very high, children can still enjoy the joy of playing in the water!

In short, a pleasant family trip needs a hotel with attentive service. Thank you St. Regis for giving us a happy start to this vacation!

msg:I left Sanya on a temporary basis, and only blindly selected St. Regis among several Yalong Bay hotels when I was departing from the airport. After two nights of experience, the overall feeling is good. One is to experience the sense of hotel design. The entrance lobby faces mountains and rivers, with a unique overall shape and a tropical style (I took the duty-free shop shuttle bus and passed several surrounding hotels, and the overall feeling is that St. Regis looks the best). There are mermaid performances and artificial bubbles in the heated swimming pool every day, which is suitable for parents and children. Second, the staff are attentive. Each room is equipped with a butler, and our butler is Kevin Xiaoma, who is warm and thoughtful throughout the service. Because it is a family of three but the room type only includes two breakfasts, the housekeeper gave free breakfast for the children for two days. Questions were answered in a timely manner, and I recommended the yacht trip project. Although it is a pity that the yacht trip did not take place due to time arrangements, I am still quite satisfied with the butler service in general. The overall feeling of the room is OK, but the fruit does not reflect the local characteristics. Our room has pears and oranges. I don‚Äôt know how other rooms are. Overall, I feel good about the blindly selected St. Regis.

The most intolerable thing is the service level. The waiters in the Chinese restaurant and the seafood restaurant don‚Äôt understand what the service of a five-star hotel is. If there is no service at all, you will be embarrassed
The front desk is even worse. You can get Marriott points when you check in, but after checking out, you can‚Äôt evade it.

I searched the Internet for half a month and saw countless hotels, each with their own advantages, but I finally chose St. Regis. I like that their location is in the innermost part of Yalong Bay, and there are no surrounding hotels. Although the beach is not big, it is enough. I like it. The service of the hotel puts the customer first, and I just feel that the stay will be very comfortable. This time the hotel has added some entertainment items, after all, more and more people travel with children. The beach has more rainbow slides, climbing frame swings, etc. My daughter and I have spent two days here comfortably and leisurely on my birthday. The child likes the glass infinity pool very much. He has to do a small train every day. The breakfast is also very rich, and the afternoon tea is also okay. Especially when the housekeeper contacted us before check-in. This time, Janet helped us decorate the room very thoughtfully. There were cute bath towel cakes, small animals, and flower petals scattered all over the bathtub. The children were very happy. (The photo is on my husband's phone, so I can't upload it) The time was short but it left good memories. St. Regis is a hotel that is hard for me to say no to.

The room corridor is the most spacious and a**ospheric I have ever seen. The indoor area is large and the facilities are slightly outdated, but the service is in place. The breakfast is rich and the fruit is especially fresh.

Walking along the beach, you will pass by Ritz-Carlton, Hilton, Marriott, etc. You can have a look at each of them, each with its own characteristics.

msg:This is the second time I stayed at St. Regis. The first time was before the epidemic. This time I went to find that the lighthouse in the sea was gone, but there are many more recreational facilities on the beach, which are more friendly to children. Next, I will share a few points personal feelings
Service: The butler service is still there. The check-in time in Sanya during the peak season is basically the same at 3:00, but the cleaning has not been completed by 4:00. We are very happy, and there is St. Regis mascot plush. Although the gift is small, it makes people feel that they are caring for the children; bath towels and children‚Äôs toiletries can be delivered by calling the butler service at any time. The younger siblings said that children‚Äôs toothbrushes are better than buying them by themselves. Fortunately, it seems that the quality of small details is still a plus.
There are many kinds of welcome fruits, not perfunctory. The drinks in the small refrigerator include Perrier water and coconut juice, which are enough.
The waiter Dong Huangnan is very nice, the service is great, warm and caring, thumbs up!
Manager Li Yue made me feel like an old friend and took good care of the children. He personally came to the beach to introduce some newly added entertainment facilities to us. It was beautiful and gentle, and made my trip to Sanya feel warmer!
Environment: The room is super big, the light is satisfactory, and the hygiene is satisfactory. The width of the double bed is 1.5m. It is very comfortable to sleep with children. The advantage of the constant temperature swimming pool in this season is simply killing other selection factors. After all, when the temperature does not allow you to go to the sea, the warm water swimming pool is for Sanya. Just need!
Facilities: The Peacock Garden has changed its location, adding nine new bunnies, which have become the new favorites that my baby will never forget. It is very happy to be able to touch the furry bunnies! The swimming rings are not free to use, and the self-bred swimming rings are pumped up for free, but the time catches up with noon, the swimming center is outsourced, and the clerk will lock the door to eat. At this time, there is no way to pump up, which is not satisfactory.
The free water is Jingtian ordinary water, and the other hotel I stayed in is Baisui Mountain, which is slightly inferior.
Island style 15-second video and photo follow-up: The travel photography service this time is much better than before. Now you can apply light makeup for free, style yourself, and you can choose clothes for shooting (the size is too small, which can be worn by thin people). Clothes need The deposit and the refund of the deposit were also very smooth, the price was not easy to negotiate, and the color correction process was not refined, but the original film of the blue sea and blue sky is also very good. I'm not satisfied with the 15-second video, it's a bit random, and I don't give any processing, just take pictures with the customer's own mobile phone.
The following pictures are taken by travel and my mobile phone

msg:On the fourth day in Sanya, I chose the St. Regis in Yalong Bay. The online reviews were very good, but the actual experience was not good. Our housekeeper Dany is an intern. He is good and can coordinate in time if there are any problems. He can understand the difficulties of everyone. Although I am not very satisfied with the hotel, it is okay to give you full marks.
To be honest, 1‚É£Ô∏è It is a bit tiring to check in at the hotel. The previous telephone communication said that check-in can only be done at 3 o'clock. It is OK. I arrived at the hotel to check in at 14:30, and I was in the queue. There were quite a lot of people, see Figure 16. The housekeeper assigned to me has not come to work yet, so I asked me to tell the guy who checked in directly if I had any requests. The guy is pretty good and he has done everything. There were many people in the queue. My husband took the baby to the beach first, and he did not ask anyone to come and do facial recognition immediately. However, I didn‚Äôt get the room card until 16:40. He also said that there was a problem with the water in the shower room and asked me and suggested that it could be repaired later. It was speechless. I thought it was almost five o'clock and didn‚Äôt care about it. I asked to change the facilities. It was okay. The housekeeper coordinated for 10 minutes and said it was okay. We went back to the hotel lobby and got the room card.
It took more than ten minutes to get the room card, and several machines couldn't work. I saw the housekeeper going back and forth with several machines, which was killing me...
2‚É£Ô∏èI was satisfied with the bathroom in the room, which was big and comfortable, but where was the sea view? There was no sea view at all. We lived on the 7th floor... The highest floor was 8, the lobby was on the 6th floor, and the breakfast swimming pool was on the 3rd floor. Looking at the picture, there was only a small sea, which was called a sea view...
3‚É£Ô∏èI want to complain about the breakfast. There were two entrances to a restaurant. During peak hours, people were queued up on both sides. We encountered a slow waiter. Our team waited for almost 20 minutes and no one came in. We were curious. My husband opened the door and looked, and found that the door opposite was always letting people in. He was afraid that we would find out and had to close the restaurant door. I think we are all **üò± The breakfast variety is also small, and it is not as rich as that of Shangri-La.
4‚É£Ô∏èThe temperature of the heated swimming pool is very good, and the kids are happy to play without worrying about being cold. The photos are very good. üëçThe queue of beach lounge chairs waiting by the pool is too dense, and the number can be increased.
5‚É£Ô∏èThe beach is really comfortable, not crowded, and the children have a great time!

I saw a sentence on the Internet, to the effect that St. Regis is proud of its butler service.
During the four nights of my stay, I didn‚Äôt feel the St. Regis butler‚Äôs serviceü§∑üèª‚ôÄÔ∏èIt may be that my expectations are relatively high. The so-called butler service is to add a butler‚Äôs WeChat üòÖIt‚Äôs no different from calling the front desk if I need it (the front desk The phone calls were handled in a more timely manner), and some basic details were not fulfilled (the room was cleaned without adding paper towels, the bathtub was not filled with bath supplies, etc.) I only received the Wechat greeting from the housekeeper the day before I left (the original text roughly: rest Is it good, how can I help)
Room cleaning does not add napkins, bathtub cleaning does not add bath supplies, these are the slots.
If you want to enjoy good hotel services, St. Regis is not the first choice.
The few restaurants in the hotel are also very unpalatable. The first meal at Yue Seafood cost nearly 1,500, which was really unpalatable. The breakfast is just so-so. If the room doesn't come with a breakfast coupon, don't spend 200 for a morning buffet. It's really not worth it.

msg:I am very satisfied with my first stay at St. Regis. The hotel occupies a large area, much larger than other hotels in Biarong Bay, and the number of rooms is small. The island resort style is strong, which is very suitable for taking a quiet walk in the hotel to see the scenery.
The size of the room is large enough, the decoration style is luxurious and warm, the twin beds are 1.5 meters, it is spacious and comfortable to live in, and it is good to work occasionally in a daze in the room.
The evening buffet is amazing, with unlimited lobster, and the small hot pot dishes are of high quality. There are not many dishes in the hotel's Chinese restaurant, but each dish is a high-quality dish with a variety of colors and tastes. The family agrees that it is the best and high-end restaurant in Yalong Bay. The only disadvantage is that it is relatively expensive.
Regarding the service, from the time of arriving at the hotel, the service quality of the concierge, reception, check-in, butler, cleaning, and restaurant are all online and satisfactory.
St. Regis is on the westernmost side of Yalong Bay. It is not so convenient to get in and out of the hotel. We rented a car from the airport, went to the Outlets for shopping and dinner, and went to Sun Bend Road to see the scenery of Yalong Bay and St. Regis. It is very convenient and there is no traffic jam.
In short, if you want to live comfortably in Yalong Bay, experience the feeling of an island vacation, and have enough budget, this St. Regis is definitely the first choice. Apart from being a bit expensive, there is nothing dissatisfied.
Sheraton, Marriott, Hilton, MGM, etc. have stayed in these other hotels. Except that the price of these other hotels is cheaper than St. Regis, other St. Regis wins. Home differences), and don't worry about feeling full of people everywhere. Recommended!

The beef noodles for breakfast are worth getting up early, you can try all the hotel's water sports, and the temperature of the online celebrity swimming pool is very comfortable... Slight flaws: there is no tissue box in the living room, there is no holder for mobile phones in the bathroom, and the shower gel is used up the next day It was not replaced when it was cleaned.

msg:Among all the hotels in Yalong Bay, the environment is the best, and the location is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle. The Park Hyatt is too inconvenient, and I don't like the gray modern design. For a vacation, it‚Äôs better to be close to nature. The St. Regis Hotel integrates people and nature very well and is very comfortable. The room is huge and the facilities are good. And St. Regis's butler service is very considerate. This one-on-one service is still very good. If there is a need, feel free to mention it. My housekeeper, kingsley Wang Licheng, called to introduce the hotel in detail before checking in, and then asked me what my needs were, and basically everything I asked for was met. Late check-out at the end, free drinks at the lobby bar, and free airport drop-off. Very considerate. give a like.

He responded to every request with meticulous and efficient service, which is a plus for the hotel. Talking about the hotel itself, St. Regis and Ritz should be the two highest-level hotels in Yalong Bay. In terms of hotel appearance and privacy, St. Regis wins because it is in the innermost part of Yalong Bay, and there are not many people during the Spring Festival. Vacation on the beach The feeling is very good, and the room is also very big. If you like a quiet vacation, St. Regis is the first choice in Yalong Bay.

msg:The hotel environment is very good, the room is spacious, and I feel very comfortable when I first entered the hotel. The facilities are relatively monotonous. The swimming pool for children's play is not open. The so-called butler service is useless. The butler added me to WeChat on the day of check-in, thinking that I would arrive at the store the next day, so I contacted her at the store and sent me to the room without any introduction. The special services in the hotel brochure were not even mentioned. I asked on my own initiative, and many of them were not very clear. As a result, I didn‚Äôt know the ride time of the little boy‚Äôs train. , This is still a small problem. The most outrageous thing is that the restaurant service is too bad. My baby and I are having breakfast, and my father and sister are going to pick up the meal. The waiter came over and put together the food and tableware we were eating Accepted, I stopped and said many times that I hadn't finished eating, the waiter still didn't stop until I yelled loudly, she just threw away the tableware in her hand and left without even an apology, I was so surprised, This is not a five-star hotel, and the waiters in ordinary restaurants outside can't do it...

msg:During the Spring Festival, the price was too high. The price of 3-5k a night can be stayed in the islands of Madai. After going abroad, the Sanya hotel will never stay at this price again. In general, St. Regis is okay in all aspects, but it is not worthy of the price. The sea view room has no sea view, and you can see the sea from the side. The particularly bad review is that the breakfast is too bad. There are too many people during the festival, and the meal is adjusted to hold a wedding. The reception capacity of the banquet hall has increased. The breakfast level is not high, and the taste has plummeted after the adjus**ent. There is nothing to eat. It gives people the feeling of attending a large-scale business meeting, and the high-end sense of vacation disappears instantly. In addition, it may be that there are too many people, and the response of the butler service is a bit slow, so I have to remind you several times. The toiletries in the room just after checking in are still leftovers from the previous guests and have not been replaced. Although the manager on duty tried his best to make up for it, it still lowered the impression score. The heated swimming pool can be praised, and the water temperature is good.

msg:Service: Yalong Bay is an old-fashioned hotel, known for its butler service, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the peak season. I didn‚Äôt feel how good the service was. Instead, there was a queue for check-in, no one to clean, and a queue for breakfast. Fortunately, the feedback from the housekeeper was still Very timely.
Hardware: The room is very large, and the basic room type must be more than 50 square meters. The hardware is complete, and it basically has all the facilities that this class should have. The mini bar is free and replenished once a day. The linen is also considered comfortable, the pillow is too soft, it will be much better with a latex pillow.
Environment: The hotel is very big, with a beautiful back to the mountains and the sea, the beach is quiet, almost no tourists, but the beach is a bit steep, and the wind and waves are too big. The net red transparent swimming pool is beautiful and has a constant temperature, so you are not afraid that you will not be able to get in the water in cold weather. It's a pity that only one swimming pool is open, and there is no freshness in one afternoon.
Catering: It can only be said to be a pass, especially the breakfast, both in terms of taste and variety, is very ordinary, and there are still a lot of people. I feel a little sorry for the St. Regis brand.

Come to experience and really feel the meticulous service, inside and out
bit.
We were greeted by the butler Victor, who responded very quickly to every request.
Don't be too fast, very service-minded. When the room was not ready, he drove us around the hotel in a battery car and introduced the history and culture of the St. Regis Hotel in detail.
And the situation of the hotel, it also cares for the children in every possible way,
A small gift was given when parting. No charge during check-in
The line also came to deliver two new ones for us to carry with us in the future.
The hotel is surrounded by mountains and the sea, and the feature of the hotel is the transparent swimming pool with constant temperature in the middle
Pool, even when the sun goes down, you don‚Äôt feel cold, which is very human
sexualized. The room size is large, mini bar and fruit are free
Yes, the breakfast is very rich. By the way, I also tried the Chinese restaurant in the hotel.
The road is also quite good, St. Regis has its own cinema, and the movie synchronous theater
Line, family watching movies together, the environment is very private, just go
The power supply did not come up that night and almost ruined the movie-watching plan.
Overall, it is very recommended, it is an unforgettable experience, and I want to continue to stay
It's a pity that the next itinerary has been arranged, and there will be a second brush, thank you
Thank you butler victor for your service, I like it for you.

msg:I planned to bring my baby to Sanya half a year ago. After reading many hotels and reviews in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay, I finally chose St. Regis. I was not disappointed. Both my children and my husband liked it very much.
Service: The customer service and housekeeper Janet contacted by phone one day in advance, added WeChat, and asked about the check-in needs. Because the double bed room we wanted was not available, they also helped us upgrade the room type. The housekeeper, Janet, provided us with a lot of hotel event information for our reference and selection. When she learned that our baby was looking forward to digging sand by the sea, she also offered to give her baby a sand digging tool set, which made my baby very happy. In short, St. Regis's butler service is considerate and thoughtful, but not overly enthusiastic and nervous, which I think is just right.
Facilities: The biggest feature is that the room is super large, and the bathroom and balcony are also very large. This is one of the important reasons why I choose St. Regis. It can be seen that although the rooms and corridors and other facilities are not new, they are well maintained and well maintained. The temperature-controlled glass swimming pool is very distinctive. The highest temperature in the few days we went was only 24¬∞C. My daughter and husband didn‚Äôt feel cold when they went swimming at night, but the swimming pool area is relatively small compared to the hotel.
Hygiene: Although it is close to the seaside, the quilt in the room does not feel damp, there is no peculiar smell, and it is refreshing. After staying for three days, the room was cleaned every day, and the spare parts were delivered in a timely manner.
Environment: The area of the hotel should be quite large, and there is a long green internal road to drive in. The main building of the hotel should be built on a hill, the lobby is on the sixth floor, and the beach swimming pool is on the third floor, which makes people feel very novel and special. Due to time constraints, I only visited a small part of the hotel area, and I already feel that it is very open, with grass, beaches, woods, harbors, and flowing water.
Breakfast: The combination of Chinese and Western varieties is very complete, and the taste is quite satisfactory. It should not be outstanding among similar hotels or even lower-grade hotels. What is commendable is that during the peak period, there is a queue to enter, and there are waiters leading the table, so there will be no embarrassing situation where you can‚Äôt find a seat with food, and the empty plates are collected in a timely manner. Another thing that feels better is that the noodle stalls will be much earlier. Prepare some boiled white noodles, and when the guests come, they can choose the soup base to reduce the waiting time.

msg:One of the two highest-grade hotels in Yalong Bay? Another one lived there too. They are all old, the room decoration is a bit old, the layout is not very reasonable, not big enough, the overall light switch is not easy to use, I don't like the transparent bathroom, there is no sense of privacy, especially complain about whether the shower design can be modified, the same switch to the left The shower is on the top of the right for showering, so you either have no way to turn off the water well after washing, or trigger the shower on the top to shower you. The environment of the hotel is good, with classic Yalong Bay features. There are enough activities to play, but they basically cost money. I have stayed in many top luxury activities in Haitang Bay, all of which are included in the room rate. The service is a little bit like nothing. All the items I really play are all made by myself through the effort to communicate with the recreation depar**ent (however, I have made an appoin**ent with the housekeeper 1-2 days in advance and it doesn‚Äôt work). The housekeeper responds very slowly and always says that the appoin**ent is made. There is no children's playground when I asked. I made an opinion on the spot and they opened it for me at their own discretion. I really don't know who the problem is. Anyway, don't think about the butler level of Capella and Edison, they are not on the same line. The breakfast queuing situation is not optimistic. Fortunately, the Chinese restaurant has been added. The food in the two restaurants is not good enough. The heated swimming pool is not bad, a must in Sanya in winter. I feel that many people in the hotel are not very smart or kind and polite. The security guards at the gate are still very good. In general, Yalong Bay hotels are relatively old, and there is no good choice.

The professional and thoughtful butler service made my stay comfortable. This year, I have been married for 13 years. This is the first time I went on a long trip with my husband. I didn't bring my baby. The two of us relaxed and enjoyed it.
Whether it was contacting 2 days in advance, welcoming in the lobby, arranging the room, introducing fun, communicating, coordinating emergencies, the butler Janet showed highly professional and efficient service, and coordinated from the perspective of better customer experience. I would like to give her special praise!
Recommended for couples or lovers to come for vacation, wedding anniversaries, etc. The big bed in the harbor is very comfortable to sleep on, the large bathroom with double sinks is very convenient for men and women to wash separately, the petal sea salt bath is very queen, and the travel photography service is very good. The photographer Hu Ge worked hard to shoot for 1 hour and gave 10 photos. We bought another 13 photos, which is a bit expensive. Remember to check in and take photos of the steps of the Internet celebrity Astor Mansion, as shown in the picture, the effect is amazing.
The spacious floor corridor, retro-style decoration and room, as if returning to the scene of American socialites dancing in the 18th century! There is love everywhere and scenery everywhere!
Thank you St. Regis for giving us such a happy and unforgettable experience! I hope you will continue to provide quality service!
It would be even better if you could add a reminder of the bathing time, a phone holder and a small pillow.

The constant temperature infinity pool can bring babies and produce movies. Chinese food and western restaurants plus room delivery are basically enough for dining (if you are really lazy and don‚Äôt want to move). If you don't want to browse the scenic spots, it is also very pleasant to just lie down, eat and play in the hotel. During the stay, I also watched Avatar 2, which was screened simultaneously in the cinema, in the hotel's film and television hall, which was so convenient. Thanks to the housekeeper Dany Qiuyue for answering all questions, which improved the check-in experience, and chicken legs can be added üçó!

msg:The worst hotel experience in Yalong Bay, staying for four days without any room service and room cleaning, because there is no waiter. The breakfast is like a vegetable market. If you catch someone to take the seat, you will be lucky, otherwise you will grab a seat. The breakfast beef noodles have a different taste every day, and the standard is uneven. Snacks by the pool can take at least 3 hours to cook. The so-called sea view room actually has to walk to the balcony and lean out of the balcony to see part of the so-called sea view on the side. The sound insulation of the room is so poor that the waiters and children in the corridor are noisy every day. You have to fall asleep before 10 o'clock, otherwise you will fall asleep. There will be noise and cleaning at 8 o'clock.

So we were upgraded to a room type and provided free breakfast for the children. ÔøºThe hotel's swimming pool and beach are particularly beautiful. You won't get tired of staying there for any number of days. The bathroom in the room is large and the bed is very comfortable! perfect

The butler, Jiuniang Xiao Yuanzi Shirley, contacted us before check-in to inquire about the requirements and arrangements for the room. When we arrived at the hotel, we waited at the door and led us to check in. We accompanied us all the way until we entered the room

We didn‚Äôt know that the biggest surprise was the room we stayed in until we got to the room. Since I chose to pay to upgrade to the pool suite, Shirley helped us arrange the best room type for the pool suite, surrounded by the pool on three sides, and facing the sea. It can be said that this stay experience can be said to be an extraordinary journey

Ah, I would like to highlight the barbecue on the beach, it is delicious and not expensive

breakfast is also great

Of course, the best thing is Shirley's full butler service. Thanks again to Shirley for giving us the best experience during our stay

Even the basic room types in the hotel are very large and spacious. Thank you for upgrading us to a sea view after hearing that we wanted to see a little river view. The service of the hotel feels thoughtful, warm and meticulous from the moment you enter the door, especially thanks to the two butlers Caesar and Shirley. The environment of the western restaurant on the seaside lawn of the hotel is good, especially the red wine we ordered, the taste is beyond expectation. Watching the sunrise on the lawn of the hotel is very beautiful. We took several cameras, mobile phones, and drones together to record this brilliant moment. It's a pity that the hotel didn't remind us that there is a paddle board activity. I didn't know until I was about to leave the store. This is a very regrettable place! I hope that if I go to stay again, the hotel can give me a discount to make up for my loss of not being able to paddle board this time.

St. Regis's meals are very good, with a rich variety of breakfasts. The Chinese restaurant has a large amount of food, and you can eat Hainan specialties. The Western restaurant is suitable for carnivores like us. The room includes an open-air barbecue on the beach, and you can watch the World Cup. The a**osphere is good. It's just too windy by the sea at night. The mini bar can be replenished several times a day for free, you can ask for more towels, and the room service is also very timely. On a sunny day, you can watch the stars at night! The travel photos given by the hotel are also good. I took more than 60 photos in half an hour, and only five photos were free. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay at St. Regis again!

msg:This National Day trip, I specially planned to visit the famous hotels in Yalong Bay. This time I stayed at Park Hyatt and St. Regis one after another. I have heard that the two have long been at the top of the praise list in Yalong Bay. The experience of staying at the St. Regis Hotel this time is very pleasant. The trip to Sanya drew a perfect ending.

Guest Experience: First of all, thanks to St. Regis' guest experience managers Victor and Bianca, who provided meticulous care during the stay. In particular, Victor introduced the cost-effective food near St. Regis very carefully, and also provided suggestions for the follow-up journey. He was very friendly and added a lot to the humanistic feeling of this St. Regis trip. Bianca also assisted with a free upgrade to a better room type and provided a later check-out time. The overall guest experience was very good.

Hotel experience: First of all, I have to give a thumbs up to St. Regis's transparent swimming pool. Whether it is a photo or a video, it is very good. I took it for two hours under the sun at noon, and my girlfriend called it absolutely amazing. Secondly, the layout of the hotel is also more reasonable, you don't need too long moving lines to reach your room. The breakfast is rich in variety, and the tastes of the world can be satisfied.

This time I stayed here for a short time. I believe that I did not fully appreciate the charm of St. Regis. I will continue to choose St. Regis next time I come to Sanya.

Although the hotel is old, it is well maintained. Complete, the outdoor Internet celebrity constant temperature swimming pool is great, the only drawback is that the beach where the hotel is located is a coral reef reserve, tourists can only play by themselves, there are many stones in the sand, you can't experience the fine white sandy beach of Yalong Bay, there are many kinds of breakfast It is also exquisite, the overall feeling is not bad, a perfect journey and a happy National Day holiday!

msg:I have stayed at the St. Regis Hotel for many times. This time I mainly experienced the pool room. The St. Regis is located in the innermost hotel group in Yalong Bay, and the yacht club is also here. I have basically experienced the hotels along the coast of Yalong Bay. St. Regis and the Ritz next door It is my favorite here in Yalong Bay.
First of all, in terms of geographical location, it covers a large area. When you drive in, you have to pass through an eye-catching green belt. The flowers, plants and trees are taken care of. It is quiet and private. There are many parking spaces in front of the door. Very nervous, the staff arranged the guidance in time, my car was very close to the lobby, and it was very convenient to get in and out.
Let's talk about the guest rooms. The most important reason for choosing here is that the standard St. Regis room is more than 70 square meters, and the twin room is a 1.5-meter-wide bed*2, which is still very advantageous in five-star hotels, especially for parents and children. It is very comfortable to sleep. My two children are relatively large, and the space is still comfortable. There is a coffee machine in the room, and welcome fruit and tea are abundant. The cupboard for the tea set looks a little old, but it is still very clean. The facilities in the room are complete, but the hardware in the bathroom is a bit loose, which is not good. The pillows are comfortable, but there is no spare quilt, ask the waiter for it. There are two large outdoor swimming pools, one of which is an Internet celebrity glass swimming pool, which is very nice to take pictures, and the other swimming pool with a slide. This time the hotel has added a sunshade, which is very user-friendly and cool. Friends who like swimming don‚Äôt have to worry about it. sunburned.
The hotel's catering is quite satisfactory, the price is not high, and some packages are very good value. When I came many years ago, there was a whole coconut for breakfast for children, but now there is no more, but the basic food is clean and hygienic, and the variety is also considered Rich and tasty. There are not many drinks in the lobby bar, coffee and black tea are not very authentic, lemon tea is a bit like a semi-finished product, I hope the hotel can be optimized, the private theater experience was excellent last time, this time it is very regrettable that it is temporarily closed due to the epidemic.
This trip is quite special. I caught up with the epidemic in Sanya. The housekeeper Xiaomeng who received me is a warm and professional handsome guy. He contacted me one day in advance and asked if there was anything that needed help. After arriving, he received patiently and meticulously, reminding us to do nucleic acid, Rui Ji Hotel has done this very well. Alcohol disinfectant is placed in the room. The hotel has specially set aside a conference room for guests to do nucleic acid. There is almost no queue, but it needs to pay 15 yuan per person at their own expense. The price is very fair, and this service also benefits us in the follow-up trip, because we can save a lot of time every day and do not do nucleic acid in dense areas, which is still very comfortable.
The hotel's beach is not the best in the Yalong Bay hotel group, but it is also superior compared to other private beaches. The key is to avoid a large number of tourists. In short, the hotel is suitable for people who enjoy quiet and comfort.
The service of the hotel has always been very good. After I left the hotel, the staff called me and found the items left in the hotel. I contacted the housekeeper Xiaomeng, and he immediately helped me to send it home. The St. Regis Hotel is a rare butler-style service in China. There is a turndown every night, and the service is basically responsive. The high-end hotels under Marriott have discounts on food and beverages with gold cards and above. Although I have been here a few times, I may have choices next time I come to Sanya. Thank you for your service and Enthusiasm, and also wish Sanya to return to its previous state as soon as possible!

Whether the room is overlooking the sea or the garden, it can be said that the view is excellent. My husband and I like it very much! The room is also very carefully decorated, there are surprise rose petals and cakes, very very romantic, and there is also a handwritten welcome card, which is really super moving~ I like the decoration design of the room, it is clean and hygienic, full of sense of security and comfort. The swimming pool is a highlight. It is very beautiful to take pictures and check in, and there is also a shaded swimming pool, and the water depth is 1.6, which can be opened for swimming, praise! ! üëçIn short, the overall check-in experience is great. Thank you to the staff, especially Shirley, for their dedication and dedication. In addition, the concierge staff has always been enthusiastic to help arrange luggage. The staff are working hard in the hot summer!
There are three other small suggestions: one is that the elevator in the guest room is really too fragrant. In fact, there is no need to place aromatherapy, and normal air conditioning and ventilation are good. Secondly, breakfast desserts can be considered to be more refined, and the taste will be better. In addition, the location of the meal needs to be arranged reasonably, such as the hot dish area and the steamed bun area that are arranged too closely, there is no place to put the lid off, and the guests have to carry the plate and the clip, which is not very convenient.
Finally, I wish Regis better and better, business is booming, we will come again if we have the opportunity!

More than 3,000 a night is not as good as my stay at the St. Regis with more than 2,000! Finally, thanks to St. Regis and Xiao Song, I will choose St. Regis next time!

msg:I go to Sanya almost every summer vacation, and then stay in all four-star and five-star hotels in Sanya. If Yalong Bay can be counted as a low-key hotel with a good accommodation experience, it is St. Regis! There are a few points that impress me. I don't talk about other companies, just talk about my own feelings!
1Ô∏è‚É£ We have two children in our family, two big and two young. Because one child is 1.8 meters old at the age of 14, I will not consider hotels with very small beds. St. Regis is 1.5 meters * 2 meters, so it is very convenient. Well it meets the special needs of our family
2Ô∏è‚É£I have stayed in a lot of hotels. Seriously, I will count children's breakfasts. After all, my son already looks like a man. Although he is only 13 years old, this is understandable. I will buy two breakfasts, but the children have never charged my money. , I took a lot of advantage üòõ Although I ask every time I ask, the front desk says it's okay, the hotel breakfast is also very good, and children like it very much
3Ô∏è‚É£ The housekeeper liu·¥óu is Shirley is very caring. My son wants to take an online class, so he ensures that the internet speed is not stuck at all, and helps with printing homework
4Ô∏è‚É£ There is a super-large awning swimming pool, which is really great, and the coach takes children with ease. People like me are most afraid of the sun, and there is an infinity swimming pool, which is very lively at night

Not only did the takeaway I ordered be delivered to the room in time, but it was also delivered to the pool for me [naughty] Thank you! 2. Children also play a lot, experience children's golf, snorkeling, watching peacocks, riding a small train, swimming in two swimming pools, watching mermaid performances, and private theaters! Simultaneous release with theaters! Thanks to Xiao Li, who is in charge of the theater, we were late and could continue to show us, which is very considerate. 3. There are two beaches, which are only 2-3 minutes away from the room. The sand of the public beach is also very soft. It is recommended to bring children, it will not be as noisy as Yanlord Holidays, and children are also happy to play üòä4.

Hygiene: After staying for two days, I experienced two types of rooms. Among them, the garden room has better hygiene and turndown service, while the sea view room has room for improvement in terms of room cleaning and turndown service.
Closer to home, St. Regis‚Äô service really makes people feel the true meaning of being at home. Before departure, we communicate with the guests‚Äô preferences by telephone, and then the little housekeeper will add WeChat üí¨, and we will greet you in the room when you check in. All kinds of matters will be explained clearly, and all kinds of information will be replied as soon as possible, almost all requests will be answered, and the mission will be fulfilledüëç
Besides, the room is a little old. We booked a garden view room. When we arranged to check in, the room had a strong musty smell. The most terrible thing was that there was a huge gap between the curtains in the bathroom. Passersby would have an unobstructed view of taking a bath. Tell the housekeeper to be on duty in the future. The manager immediately changed us to the highest sea view room, the scenery is so beautiful, I can stand on the balcony for an afternoonüåä
The breakfast is also rich, and it is not so monotonous as the comments say, maybe I have low requirements üò¨
With such high-quality service and space for one step at a time, you can imagine the scene of the hotel when Yalong Bay was favored. Sanya has stayed in many hotels large and small. When it comes to service, St. Regis and EDITION are definitely the class. top three.

msg:There are no less than five hotels in Yalong Bay, but my favorite is St. Regis, which is quiet and elegant, especially in peak season. When the front desk of other hotels is full of people, St. Regis is still clean. The housekeeper, Xiaomeng, has attentive service. The hotel knows me. The surf flicked his waist and specially prepared a room next to the elevator for me.
Many guests will compare the St. Regis with the Ritz-Carlton next door, but I personally feel that the St. Regis is more than one grade higher than the next door, from the environment to the service, although some people say that the Ritz has a rich breakfast, but for those who get up early to swim and surf. For people, it is enough to eat a good breakfast. If you don‚Äôt want to eat it, it doesn‚Äôt make much sense whether it is rich or not. When I checked out, I was still swimming in the hotel, and there was no place to take a bath after swimming. The spa allowed me to use the bathroom for free, which made me feel reluctant to leave. Scoring, there should be no better choice than St. Regis, but the only regret is that the beach is narrow, not as wide as Marriott and MGM and suitable for swimming in the sea. Of course, if you don‚Äôt plan to swim in the sea, but choose a swimming pool, then Rui On the contrary, Ji has a very a**ospheric transparent swimming pool. The single swimming pool of other hotels should not be able to compare with this. Generally speaking, I will continue to stay. The only suggestion is to ask the hotel to maintain the standard of living.

msg:Our housekeeper is called Tintin. The reason I wrote this comment was because after I came back, everyone in the comment area unanimously liked the housekeeper. I was really angry. Simply speaking, his service can only be described in three words: no service!
main problem:
First: when the room is obviously not full, it directly refuses us to say that the room is full and cannot be upgraded. In fact: on the same day we checked in, the beautiful lady at the front desk took the initiative to see clearly and offered to directly help us upgrade the sea view room. At that time, I told him that the whole room was a bit unhappy [disdain] Second: on the afternoon of the check-in day, I went to Sunshine Bay and came back. My husband slipped and fell in the parking lot below (there were some sticky transparent gel-like things on the ground), and his feet were swollen at that time. . At that time, I went to the housekeeper immediately, hoping to get help from the housekeeper. At that time, the person standing in front of the housekeeper was indifferent and indifferent, and said, "Just wait a minute." And then no more. Fortunately, the other staff of the hotel are still enthusiastic, and they are still asking for concern, and finally get into a wheelchair [covering face], so scary, we quickly said that we don't need it [social society] [social society] [social society] Society] (Later, a staff member helped my husband back to the room with him. In the elevator, he introduced himself to us [angry] [angry] [angry] Oh my God, I'm so angry at this time [expletive] [expletive ] [cursing] What were you doing at that time? Are you watching a play? Why do I say anything when I come to you for help? The guests need help if they have difficulties. Even if you are not my housekeeper, you should do your duty to help. So I'm really very angry... I just ignore this person and ignore him [Bad]
So to sum up two points: 1. We will not assist guests to provide upgrade services if they have a room. 2. What a housekeeper is indifferent to the guests, even a big sister who cleans a room is not as good.
However, the overall St. Regis service and hardware facilities are still very good. During our stay, there were not many guests, there was basically no need to wait for breakfast, there were very few people in the swimming pool, and no one was seen in the elevator, so we all lived very satisfied. of. However, the breakfast variety in the hotel is less. Compared with the Shangri-La family a few days ago, there are really more varieties, but each has its own advantages. Special praise here for the aunt who cleaned up the room. She asked us over and over again if we needed anything, and she arranged for us. Also, our housekeeper was not there when we first checked in. A young lady named Xiao Yuan received us. She is very careful to introduce the layout and location of the hotel to us, thank her!
In a word, St. Regis is still good. This time I stayed at Marriott for this trip to Sanya, and the last is St. Regis in Shangri-La. My husband said that St. Regis has a next time [happy] [Âë≤Êë≤]

The bed in the twin room is very large, one bed is not crowded for two people at all, there are many places to check in by the glass swimming pool and the Internet celebrity stairs. The hotel sent half an hour to shoot, you can choose 5 photos, and the photos are pretty good. Our housekeeper, Xiao Meng, was very enthusiastic. He added a WeChat message in advance and kept asking for any needs. The reply was timely and great.
The only shortcoming may be the bath water in the shower room, the temperature is not stable, it is cold and hot, it may be that the hotel has been a long time. In short, old and young like it very much, and will continue to stay next time.

The butler service is very considerate. It will call you a day in advance and add WeChat to send you information such as nucleic acid location and hotel meals, and any needs will be arranged in seconds.

The room was given a head trea**ent or a singing bowl, and there was a small train for the garden. Because of the typhoon, I didn‚Äôt take the small train. There is also a time limit for the singing bowl, but the housekeeper helped me to add a session by myself. It was really very considerate.

The Chinese restaurant tastes super good, the special dishes are super delicious, and the price is very cheap. There are a lot of things in the breakfast room. The western restaurant is by the sea, but it is a little far from the sea, but you can see the sea and peacocks. The taste is very good, the price is not expensive, because there is an outdoor, so the environment is very pleasant. Service is also good. St. Regis is engraved on the coconut.

There are outdoor swimming pools, and there are three rooms that you can jump in when you open the door, and there are three kinds of swimming pools. And the internet celebrity of the glass punched in.

There is also a movie theater, 98 yuan per ticket, which is still a popular movie. There are two halls. The environment is very good, and there are few people. It is basically the rhythm of the reserved venue.

The environment and service of the hotel are very good. The room is large, well laid out and comfortable. The rooms in the east wing are next to the children's swimming pool, which is very convenient for children to play. The garden landscape of the whole hotel is beautiful especially near the private beach.
The transparent swimming pool where the internet celebrity punches in is the biggest highlight. The most impressive thing is the life fitness of the gym. Although the location of the gym is a bit far, the equipment is very useful.
The only regret is that the beach has not been completely renovated, and there is no way to enjoy the best beaches in the country. And just in time for the renovation of the hotel in the past two days, it affected the experience a little, but overall it was innocuous.
In Yalong Bay, apart from Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis, they are all ceiling-level existences. If you come to Yalong Bay, neither of these two hotels will step on the pit.

msg:This year, we stayed at three hotels in Sanya, Le M√©ridien, Park Hyatt and St. Regis, with Le M√©ridien first and St. Regis second. Since the typhoon came in those days, the pool room we booked played a huge role.
A few shortcomings:
1 After arrival, the front desk for check-in is being rebuilt, the scaffolding is exposed, and the look and feel is not very good.
2 The sink was not cleaned after entering the room.
3 It may be due to the typhoon, the TV can't watch it, and the hot water is warm at most.
4 On the first day, I told the housekeeper that we had two children and needed the children's bathrobes and slippers, but the bathrobes were taken away during the cleaning the next day. . . .
5 There are many, many, many large and small snails in the swimming pool, and I didn't see any staff clean up after staying for two nights.
6 The wall at the entrance of the restaurant is painted, and it smells great when you go to eat.
There are too many rocks on the beach at the 7 hotel, the sand is not as fine as Amy's, and there are no patrolling people at night.
The lighting design of room 8 is very inhumane, all of them are operated by the bedside, and I can't figure out which one is right when I turn off the lights at night.
There were mosquitoes in room 9, and the mosquito repellent in the hotel was useless. Later, it was better to order the mosquito coils I brought myself. There are estimated to be 30 packets on my daughter's face and husband's legs. . .
There are still advantages:
1 The pool room is connected, not the kind that can only soak in water. For children who are unsafe to go out and have no place to play in typhoon days, the long swimming pool is a big paradise. We also took underwater videos, which are very good.
2Although it took a while to check in, some staff arranged a special place for children to do handicrafts, desserts, fruits, tea, etc.
3 After checking in, a housekeeper will deliver to the room, and WeChat has also been added. After contacting anything, it will be implemented as soon as possible.
4. For the places that the hotel did not do well, they sent us afternoon tea at the first time. Afternoon tea exceeded my expectations, the regular price was 688, and the desserts were delicious.
5 On the day I left, I also gave a pair of dolls from our hotel and two leather goods that I don't know how to use, but my heart is full.
6 There is an open-air road from the hotel door to the front desk. There will be a special person who will issue umbrellas there, and will also bring umbrellas to send children there, which is very considerate.
7 One day the baby was playing with 3 other children in the hotel. The staff felt uneasy when they saw it. They even called me to confirm that they had my permission before taking them to the children's playground.
8 There are magicians and clowns at the entrance of the restaurant. The children had a great time playing and became the magician's big apprentice.
The noodles in the 9 restaurant are very delicious, and the baby has eaten several bowls.

I wanted to continue living in the villa later, and also patiently helped me check it for a long time, little brother He is handsome and responsible and must give him a thumbs up. He has stayed in many hotels in Sanya, and his favorite is St. Regis.

There are two swimming pools, the central constant temperature swimming pool (0.86/1.5m, not all 1.5m deep in the middle, but the one with a gradient) and the Penghuan family swimming pool (1.6m), with swimwear and swimming rings for sale, and free towel.
Cecilia's butler service is attentive and thoughtful, really responsive. Hearing what I mentioned, the senior three students were advised not to come to the graduation trip ahead of time for the college entrance examination, and they also contacted the hotel to deliver cakes. Really impressed! ! Thank you so much üôè

msg:The St. Regis Hotel is a luxury brand of Marriott, and it has long been famous for its gold medal hotel butler service, so this time, Sanya did not hesitate to book a two-night hotel here. Sure enough, a week before departure, I received a contact from Akim, the housekeeper of St. Regis, who warmly and thoughtfully inquired about the number of people, ideas, personal needs, etc. of our trip to Sanya, and introduced me in advance the characteristics of the room I booked. . As soon as we arrived at the entrance of the hotel, we saw Akim who had been waiting for a long time, and the fruit drinks brought us, and the fatigue of the journey was swept away. The St. Regis Hotel is relatively large and is located on the edge of the Yalong Bay Beach, which is especially suitable for people who like quiet. We booked a deluxe sea view room, and sure enough, whether it was the low-key and luxurious room decoration, space, or the first-line sea view from the balcony, my partner and I were full of praise, and it was a worthwhile trip. The hotel's sea view and garden view are amazing. We spent a morning taking pictures in the hotel, and spent an afternoon sitting quietly watching the sea chatting and drinking afternoon tea. The price of the hotel's Chinese restaurant is still affordable, and finally we spent an evening tasting Food. I couldn't help but post a few photos to share with everyone, like and like! Next time you come to stay here, the service is excellent!

There are not only the constant temperature transparent glass swimming pool of the Internet celebrity, but also the large swimming pool with a roof that is not afraid of the sun with a slide that children like! The housekeeper Anson really needs to give him a big compliment this time. The service is very considerate. He helped us to upgrade the room type for free, check out late, and also sent gifts and handwritten cards for children (full of ritual), and cakes (the cakes are very Delicious, not the kind that fool people)! There are also breakfast waiters who are very enthusiastic. When they see guests coming in, they trot to greet them. When they see children, the baby tableware is in place, needless to say! In short, the St. Regis is the hotel I want to live in after staying in!

From the moment I got off the bus, there was a doorman to help with luggage and open the door. When I checked in, there was a butler, Kevin, who was available at any time. Moreover, the most common rooms were much larger than Wenhua's Haifeng Pavilion, especially the cloakroom. I really liked it. There are also Lily from the spa and Linda for haircuts, making the trip to Sanya even better. Next time I have a choice, I will still come to St. Regis.

msg:The trip to Sanya this time was actually relatively short. I planned to book 3 hotels for 3 days and 3 nights. Looking back, it was all Marriott. I had a transfer in Sanya Bay on the first day, because I stayed in Sanya for a few days last time. Bay, so this time the second day will be in Yalong Bay, and the third day will be in Dadonghai. Of course, the whole process of the flight transfer on the first day was uneventful. I got up early the next morning and set off for St. Regis. I actually heard about the St. Regis butler service (I have never experienced it), and I thought that there might be a butler who would meet one-on-one. Driving from the gate to the lobby almost walks into an independent world. If Park Hyatt has exclusive access to Sun Bay, then St. Regis next to it also ‚Äúexclusively‚Äù a corner of Yalong Bay. The environment is very quiet and covers a large area.
üçÉEnvironment: In a relatively "independent" "peninsula". The biggest advantage is quietness. Compared with other hotels with strong parent-child attributes, St. Regis may be more suitable for two people to sit here quietly for an afternoon watching the sea. In addition, I feel that there are no mosquitoes in the hotel area... It is recommended to rent a car to go, and the trip basically starts at 3-4km.
üîîService: In fact, the most surprising thing is actually the butler service. Victor is our personal butler who stayed at St. Regis this time. He can be regarded as our "tour guide" in Sanya or as our "spiritual sustenance" in Sanya , may be far away, but it happens that Victor is also my hometown. I don‚Äôt know whether it is the details of the hotel or our fate, which is always surprising. How detailed is Victor? Careful instructions for check in. The air conditioner was turned on in advance when entering the room. The sun was too strong on the day we checked in, so we brought us hats in advance when we went out. After checking in, he took the initiative to enter the license plate for us to facilitate our parking. The duty-free shop came back tired and prepared coffee for us. Every time I go back to the hotel, although someone calls me by my name in an unfamiliar place to greet me, I feel at home when I arrive at the hotel, including the various foods recommended for us! It must be emphasized that it is a very perfect experience, as detailed as how to bargain for seafood! This is why Victor is really the "tour guide" of our trip to Sanya, and the service is really meticulous. In fact, 2 hours after we checked into the hotel, we checked out the hotel for the third day and decided to stay at St. Regis. This may be the butler service we found in a different place that "sense of belonging" could not refuse. Let's stay. ok, St. Regis has already become a fan, and my friends in the back will definitely recommend St. Regis to stay in the first place. In fact, I am also an ordinary worker who has never stayed in too many luxury hotels, but the biggest surprise of this trip to Sanya is St. Regis. , Some people say that Sanya is a hotel, so if you want to be quiet, friendly, and have a sense of vacation, then I still recommend St. Regis~ Again, I am very grateful for Victor's caring butler service

msg:üçÉEnvironment: The layout style of the old-fashioned resorts in Sanya has a unique geographical advantage, which allows the hotel to sit on a large area of greenery and sea views. The sense of vacation is good and very quiet.
In the Park Hyatt Sun Bay, I encountered various unpleasantness and finally checked out early and temporarily chose to stay in St. Regis. I did not expect it to be higher than expected! The last time I came to Yalong Bay can be traced back to the time of junior high school. . I thought it would be outdated, but I didn't expect it to be maintained quite well
I stayed in a garden-view villa, the sense of privacy is OK, the room size is large, the sense of space is enough, the swimming pool faces the garden, and it feels a bit like Ubud haha

üßπHygiene: The hygienic condition is also maintained well, which shows the careful maintenance

üîîService: Most of the staff are friendly and enthusiastic, but there are also some who are arrogant. The housekeeper who received us on the first day was pretty good, but we met on the second day. . It's hard to say. . The phenomenon of mixed good and bad exists in many places, and sometimes it depends on luck
Both belong to Marriott. This is what EDITION does very well, generally well-trained and highly professional.

msg:First of all, thank the housekeeper Victor for all the thoughtful arrangements from before check-in to check-out! The existence of the butler is to make you feel at ease + worry + relieve + happy in this hotel.
The hotel has several advantages: 1. A**osphere. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers, and the grass is endless. If it is a hotel wedding, it is too suitable. The villa area is also a large area; 2 gentlemen. From the decoration style to the small butler style, it is fully reflected; 3. Rich entertainment. The mermaid show in the kart, kayak cinema, and people who stayed for two days felt that it was already full. Suitable for children and parents to stay and play.

Before I checked in, I called to ask what I needed. We brought a baby in and prepared a bed fence and baby supplies for us. Then I added the Wechat of the housekeeper Ariel, and I can say anything in time. Also helped our baby make an appoin**ent for archery activities and crab catching activities. The hotel is very warm to children from top to bottom, and the bathroom products are also updated every day. The housekeeper Ariel also sent a small cake to our baby, which tasted very good. Whether it is car rental matters or directions, you can ask the butler. All hotel staff are professional and welcoming. We checked out today and took our luggage out by ourselves. The little brother in the hotel also told us that next time we don‚Äôt have to push our luggage out by ourselves. He called and said we wanted to check out and he would pull it out for us. The service is really perfect! ! ! But I hope that the sea and the beach can organize and plan some charging activities at sea, it will be more perfect! The variety of breakfast could be richer. In general, it is very suitable for vacations, especially for families with children who do not need to leave the hotel for a one-stop vacation.

Thanks to the housekeeper this time: Xiao Meng, the whole process of service is very enthusiastic, and everything is done by hand. With the elderly, we have many needs, and Xiaomeng will implement them one by one.

msg:In the spare time after this business trip, I asked my family to come to Sanya for a little relaxation. Booked the children's swimming pool room at The St. Regis Yalong Bay. Two or three days before check-in, the hotel staff contacted me to confirm whether the itinerary was adjusted, and then told me that a housekeeper would contact me the day before my check-in.
        Sure enough, my housekeeper Victor C Chen Yongchao contacted me exactly one day in advance and took the initiative to ask my needs. I originally thought that the so-called housekeeper was just a gimmick to fool people. Unexpectedly, in the short three days of St. Regis, the butler's caring, meticulous and thoughtful service was felt everywhere.
1. Before check-in, ask me about the estimated time of arrival, and I tell him that I will check in between 12 and 13 noon. He immediately checked the check-in situation and told me that if I have other arrangements, it is recommended to arrive at the hotel later, because the room I booked is full, and generally the check-out time of this room type is rarely early.
2. After adding me on WeChat, take the initiative to introduce the opening hours and usage suggestions of various services and facilities of the hotel. After learning that we need a nucleic acid test, he told us to check in at the store, and he would help us make an appoin**ent.
3. When we arrive at the store, first of all, the doorman takes the initiative to take all the luggage, give us the luggage tag, and let us give it to the front desk. After checking in, the hotel will arrange to deliver the luggage to the room, which is very considerate and convenient.
4. Check in, the front desk informs you that the room has just been checked out and is rushing for a room. We need to wait for a while after completing the formalities, and I will call and let me know. At this time, the housekeeper Victor C Chen Yongchao came. Offered us to check in first and then during the waiting time he took us to the hotel to get acquainted. When I went to get the keys of the battery car, I brought two straw hats to shade my wife and children, and the introduction was detailed and serious. At the same time, he offered to order a drink for us in the lobby bar and let us sit for a while, and he contacted me as soon as possible. After we declined, we walked to the hotel on our own. It didn't take long for the housekeeper to call to inform us that the room had been tidied up, but the room had not been checked by the supervisor, and the TV in the bathroom had a small problem. But considering we have small children, if we don't mind, we can go to the room to rest first, and arrange inspection and maintenance at the same time. After we agreed, escorted us to the front desk to get the room card. At this time, the front desk staff informed me of the current room status and asked if I would mind. After getting a positive answer, they immediately gave me the prepared room card. The housekeeper Victor C escorted us to the room to check in. It happened that the TV in the room was also repaired, and the check was correct and then left.
5. Not long after I left, I was informed by WeChat that the nucleic acid test had been arranged for us, and the detailed time and place were informed.
6. During the two or three days we stayed, we received greetings from the housekeeper every morning, and gave the child a chocolate cake the next day, which the child liked very much.
7. On the day we checked out, he also went to the room to give the child a departure gift, and accompanied us through the check-out procedures throughout the whole process, from beginning to end.
8. Let's talk about other people who serve us. We went back to the hotel lobby for dinner one day, and the child casually said that he was thirsty. When we did not ask for help, a doorman immediately stepped forward and asked if we needed drinking water. After getting a positive answer, he ran to get it for us. I ordered three bottles of mineral water, which was timely and a**ospheric. During breakfast, when we were undecided between the two restaurants, the waiter took the initiative to tell the difference between the two restaurants, and it was true. The waiter who cleaned our room took the initiative to clean up the room and fill up the water and drinks when turning the bed for us the next day. Since we went to the beach and swam during the day, the workload was the same as cleaning a new house, no complaints, the smile still came from the heart!
8. I am used to drinking a lot of water. When I checked in, I was worried that the water was not enough. I was going to ask the hotel to ask for it or buy it, but I found that I was worried. There is water in all the facilities in the hotel. The waiter who cleans the room sees that the water in the room is all drunk. Next time, he will give two or three times the amount of water. I gave 12 bottles to my room, which is enough to drink.

msg:Avoiding the peak of the Spring Festival and Internet celebrity hotels, this trip before the Spring Festival is more free and comfortable. I especially like the large green lawn near the sea at the St. Regis Hotel. The beach is almost a private beach, and the water is very clear and blue. The transparent heated outdoor swimming pool is very beautiful to take pictures, and the water is not cold at all in this season. When booking the hotel room, I was a little worried about the old facilities. After I checked in, I felt that there was no problem at all. The space was relatively large. The size of the double bed with sea view was more than 70 square meters, and the sense of space was very good. Imported fragrance is good. The special housekeeper victor Chen Yongchao is very nice, very calm and professional. From the check-in to the period, we arranged the activities in an orderly manner, which made us feel very warm and comfortable. We also specially sent the children a delicious chocolate cake. Everyone is very satisfied, and I would like to express my special thanks . Anyway, will come again.

msg:As an old customer of St. Regis (I stayed at St. Regis Sanya in March 2021, and left a good impression, I fell in love with the St. Regis brand later, and stayed at St. Regis when I went to Macau and other places), I am looking forward to it again. He hesitated to choose Sanya St. Regis.
But this stay experience is really disappointing, let's talk about it one by one:
(1) Room hygiene and safety: I stayed in room 2806. I took a shower on the day I checked in. My daughter-in-law was pricked by broken glass on the floor of the shower room (as shown in Figure 1). Maybe something was broken by the previous guest? Then put on the hotel's plastic slippers and continue to shower. Before taking a shower, I deliberately lay on the ground with a flashlight to see if there was any sharp glass of the same size, but I didn't see it. But I was stabbed after I went in (Figure 2). After washing, touch the floor tiles with your hands, all of which are broken glass ballast. I contacted the housekeeper, and the housekeeper called the manager on duty. The two came to see the situation, apologized, and took the glass away, and there was no follow-up! Until check out two days later, no one gave any explanation, and no one gave any explanation at the check-out time (the check-out time was a mess, although I told the housekeeper, but the housekeeper or the manager on duty, no one was there) or during the stay. It means that even the most basic consolation, such as giving a fruit plate, is not available at all. Did the two of us get tied up like this? You must go to the hospital with a bleeding infection? ?
(2) The socket in the room is broken (as shown in Figure 3), although it was repaired the next day after the contact, but this kind of problem must be repaired only after the guest points out?
(3) When I came last year, the housekeeper will contact us in advance to confirm the arrival time, wait outside and arrange check-in matters. This year, nothing! The 3 counters were unhurried, no one to guide, let alone drinks or something. You can only take your luggage and wait until the other guests at check-in have finished chatting with the front desk before you have the opportunity to step forward, and, stand and wait! There is no order at all and no one will care about you.
(4) Breakfast, although the variety is acceptable, it is also messy inside. Breakfast dishes (such as omelettes) are generally poorly insulated, and there are differences between the two restaurants (for example, the Chinese restaurant has watermelon, but the main restaurant does not, but the Chinese restaurant does not even have all kinds of basic sauces, if you need yellow lantern chili sauce , you can only ask the waiter to ask for it)
The above are all real feelings, please check the hotel as appropriate.

msg:St. Regis was originally the most anticipated hotel before the trip, because Xiaohongshu saw an up saying that he had escaped from Yanlord to Yalong Bay, and finally felt the feeling of vacation at St. Regis. But what happened to Hilton Yalong Bay made me have to be cautious, so I only booked one night. On the day we checked in, we decided to continue our stay. My expectations were correct. It was really a good place for vacation. In terms of experience in Sanya throughout the holiday, the St. Regis butler service is the most in place. It is truly hands-on, arranges everything in an orderly manner, and will also meet some of your special requests. Our housekeeper is Akim, a little Korean guy. Before I came, I also saw comments saying that the century-old butler service history is useless, and I have never seen it since I checked in. The situation on our side is that we contacted us in advance, asked about the approximate time of arrival, and if we had any special needs, let us tell him when we arrived, and he would meet us in the lobby. I think I have more right to speak because we have not booked an executive room, so there is no problem of administrative courtesy. We only booked an ordinary garden view room, and the butler service is still so considerate. The hotel is large and the number of rooms is small. Even though the butler center said when we checked in, we didn't expect there would be so many people after the 15th. Sorry, the service may be relatively inefficient because the room is full, but we still feel at home. and a slow-paced vacation. The whole trip lasted for more than ten days, and the two days in St. Regis were not the best but also tied for the first place. Because of the baby, the housekeeper re-prepared children's equipment, and took the initiative to install a bed surround to prevent the baby from falling off the bed. If we still have vacation arrangements in Sanya in the past two years, St. Regis must be a must-have option. In addition, the toppings of the breakfast noodles are great, and the friends who go to live can try it.

üöó Transportation: It is more convenient for us to drive by ourselves

üßπHygiene: Hygiene is very clean, very reassuring and comfortable

üçÉEnvironment: St. Regis' landscaping ability is really strong, the hotel's private beach is relatively clean and quiet, the sand is very comfortable, the lawn on the beach is so beautiful, and there is a circle of mangroves that is really nice.
The facilities of the room are indeed a little old, but we have no special requirements for this, and the stay is very comfortable!

üîîService: First of all, I would like to thank jaken for the service, very nice. When we came, some problems were solved very well, and we were upgraded to a room. Very patiently explained to us the service, environment and so on. I know that three of us took the initiative to help apply for an additional nucleic acid test.

Catering: We chose the seaside barbecue buffet. The variety is very rich, the service is very good and timely, but the taste is a little lacking. At the same time, the lobster is a little late. We

Recreation: One thing to say, kayaking is really worth a try. Walking through the hotel's own mangrove bay area, it is quiet and comfortable, and there are enough guides and coaches to introduce us to the mangroves patiently. Don't rush, don't rush! Not to mention other swimming pools, hahaha.

msg:There are few such comments, but this stay experience is indeed extraordinary, and it is worth talking about in code words. First of all, after I booked a room on Ctrip, St. Regis added me on WeChat immediately (I saw a lot of comments on the Internet saying that St. Regis's butler service is rather tasteless, but I still feel very good this time), I asked I had some special requests, and after the room was ready, I went to the room to shoot a very detailed video. When checking in, there is a separate check-in area, there are not many people, there is no need to queue, and it is much quieter than other hotels. At that time, the housekeeper Scarlett was already waiting in the lobby. She was a fair little girl. She took me to the room. The room was arranged according to the previous requirements, and the details were in place. The housekeeper introduced us to the room facilities and played with the children for a while. Later, I took the children to the beach to play, and even went to the beach to give me a straw hat. The service was very considerate. After playing at the beach, I went to go karting again. At that time, I was asking the housekeeper on WeChat about signing up for children's activities. As a result, a little brother came out of the door next to us and asked us if we wanted to sign up for crab hunting. I was shocked. He said that he saw in the group. After I posted it, come and find me. I not only sighed that this service is too time-sensitive! In the evening, I participated in the hotel's parent-child activity to catch crabs. The little pot friends had a lot of fun. The coaches and brothers were very considerate. Seeing that the children couldn't catch them, they kept helping to dig. I have to say that the hotel is really big. Yesterday, the number of steps was 10,000+, and it was only at the end that I figured out the orientation. However, all the facilities and objects are of high quality. It is worth mentioning that the bedding, the bed and the quilt are so comfortable. I have always had a bad sleep last night. I woke up and sighed with my little friend. For a long time, he said he felt the same way and slept very well! When checking out, Miss Scarlett, the housekeeper, sent a box of handmade chocolates! awesome!

msg:I was very satisfied with my stay at the St. Regis Hotel this time. It is indeed a butler service. Although it was only two days, I felt that the room was cleaned very diligently. We filled it up, unlike other hotels, we often need to call the front desk to ask for water. The room is also cleaned in a timely manner, and there are many varieties of breakfast. The special breakfast can last until 11 o'clock, which is very user-friendly. Special thanks to the housekeeper Victor Chen, who also gave St. Regis hats and a small crab bubble machine. The children liked it very much. Before leaving, they also tasted the chocolates from the St. Regis Hotel, which could not be better.

When I arrived at the store, because the room was not tidied up and the child's clothes happened to be wet, the manager immediately upgraded the suite, but there was no children's play in the suite. Scarlett dared to be tight. I brought a crayon puzzle bubble machine and bought the battery of the bubble machine myself. I was too careful and responsive. I also quickly sent a baby toilet, a bench, and a bed fence. The lawn of the hotel and the transparent swimming pool are the highlights. There are also many activities for children to participate in. Although we didn't participate because it was a bit small, the children in the children's activity center on the first floor liked it very much. They even borrowed storybooks to read in the room. happy

I remember that St. Regis used to be able to go to sea, so I decided this itinerary, and later I found out that it was gone, but The plan was in a hurry, and the boat was arranged through the housekeeper. I have to say that the price is much cheaper than abroad. I went to play the next day full of joy. The experience was really bad. The most outrageous bath towels cost money, which is equivalent to There is no basic equipment, and the housekeeper did not remind it in advance. As a result, the boyfriend was dizzy and messed up. When I came back and reported the situation to the counter, I found out that the boat is not a hotel, and everything is much higher than that of a hotel. It is like a black intermediary who took us out and sold us in the dark. There are not enough items in the itinerary. time, really angry. In the end, I found the hotel to deal with it, and all the fees were refunded. I don't think this is an accidental incident. The fact that the housekeeper can be a black intermediary and slaughter the guests means that there is a problem with the management of St. Regis. The most important thing is to give me the check-out fee and not let me evaluate it. This is outrageous. I hope Regis can seriously reflect on it. We have been playing all the way. It may be the peak season now, and the service is average. That‚Äôs it. Hope to see a change next time I come back.

During my ten days at the St. Regis Hotel, I experienced the beauty of a spring breeze. The hotel's environment, facilities and equipment are naturally the best among the resort hotels. The most touching thing is the good memory of St. Regis Hotel's service. From the moment we made a reservation, the series of special needs communicated with the hotel reservation depar**ent have been paid attention to and received very good feedback; since we checked into the hotel, the housekeeper Xiaoyuan's responsiveness and dedication to all the help we gave us moved us. During this period, my daughter accidentally broke her leg, and the housekeepers of St. Regis came to the room every day with a medicine box to help her daughter disinfect and reduce inflammation. We were very moved. There are also the hotel receptionists, concierge receptionists, cinema receptionists, cafeterias, Chinese restaurants, and Yanyue Seafood Restaurant. The ladies and sisters all worked hard to give us corresponding help. Here, there is no rejection, only the heart will help you solve the problem. attitude to the problem. There are also trainers in the gym, swimming pool, rowing, etc. who are very attentive and conscientious. It's a bit reluctant to leave. One moment, one scene, one state of mind, after a few busy days, I will definitely come back to this beautiful and beautiful St. Regis.

My housekeeper is Ariel, who has contacted me and added WeChat since before I traveled. I can answer any questions and keep in touch at any time. In addition to helping me make an appoin**ent for the duty-free shop shuttle bus and nucleic acid testing, there was also a small episode during this stay. Since my first room was a connecting room, the sound from the adjacent room in the early morning was basically transmitted to me through the connecting door, which made it difficult for me to fall asleep. After I reported it to Ariel, she helped me coordinate and help me change the room and upgraded it to Supreme Sea view room, and gave me a fruit plate and coconut green, very moved.
Regarding the hotel environment, the hotel is very big. The heated swimming pool and the large lawn everywhere are very beautiful to take pictures.
Regarding the room, it is a little old, but it is well maintained, the cleaning is timely and clean, and there is a turndown service every day.
Regarding breakfast, it is quite satisfactory. There are many kinds of fruits. I prefer coffee. It is a fully automatic coffee machine.

When we got off the plane, the housekeeper kindly sent a message to ask us when we arrived at the hotel, and arranged a time to pick us up. I really like the hotel environment. Facing the sea, the whole environment is very comfortable. The point! ! ! I think the most heart-warming is Victor Chen. Butler Chen Yongchao is really super careful! I didn't come here for a guide. He took us around the hotel very carefully and introduced us to the hotel's features, including villa rooms, beaches, swimming pool performances and so on. Recommended Sanya food, attractions. The most important thing is that he almost helped us make plans, what to play the next day, where we need to get up early, and where we need to apply sunscreen! Really caring, I have stayed in so many hotels and have never met such a caring butler!
The hotel is also well equipped. The bathrooms are very clean. On the first day, a lot of fruit was delivered. We forgot to close the door, and the bird flew in. The hotel immediately sent a lot of fruit. All you can eat is the fruit and the drinks are free, which is super.
On the third day, because we booked Yate xxx before, the gap between the two hotels is too big! ! It's not comparable to St. Regis at all.... In the future, when you come to Sanya, you must choose this kind of hotel with a butler and a good environment.
In the end, my husband originally asked me to write a thank you letter to Butler Chen, because the trip was too urgent and I was not ready. Finally, thank you for bringing us such a good trip to Sanya. I also wish the hotel business is booming and everything goes well.

msg:I stayed at St. Regis for the first time. Although the hotel facilities are quite old, it is not a new hotel in itself. But really live in to talk about a few advantages
1) Service: It is really in place, especially the butler service gives a real bonus to the theme of "resort hotel". As a hotel with a large area, the first visit will inevitably be dazzling. Thank you for the warm introduction of our little butler sister Sookie. Let us understand the facilities and services for the first time~ Welcome fruit plate is also delicious~
2) Facilities: Unfortunately, I didn't experience the swimming pool much this time. Although the seaside area is small, the facilities are very comfortable, especially during the epidemic period, foreign guests cannot come in, which guarantees the experience of hotel guests. The location of the lobby cafe is very good, the scenery is great, and the French fries; the beach chairs are also very comfortable, and I don‚Äôt want to go home listening to the sound of the waves.
3) Room: The daily water supply is very sufficient, and the hotel equipment is updated quickly, but the bath towels and bathrobes are changed too quickly~a little bit unenvironmental, not big deal. The room location is very quiet, I will stay in the garden room in the west wing this time. Although I can't see the sea view, the privacy is very good and very quiet. The room is big enough, and the twin rooms are 1.5 big beds and three girls are enough to sleep (here again thanks to the sookie butler for helping us to add breakfast), the bathtub is excellent! Great view too!
3) Dining: The breakfast is full of Chinese and Western, the portion is added in time even during the peak dining period, and the food is delicious. It is really much better than the open-air buffet of 1300 yen per person on New Year's Eve üòÅ. Cheese cold cuts and bread are well received. Chinese food is also good. The Hawaiian pizza at the coffee shop Ma Ma Tei, üçü praise.

In summary, considering the hotel‚Äôs services and hardware management, I will come again if I have a chance. It is very suitable for people who do not like shopping to come to the hotel for a daze. It is also suitable for families with sufficient budget. Classes are all charged and not low)

msg:Going out to eat, stay and travel are three major things, and I have always had higher requirements for hotels. This time I stayed at Haitang Bay Yate two days before I went to Sanya. The hotel was good but not suitable for me. I chose St. Regis on Ctrip after a rainy day. The hotel is located in Yalong Bay. Both the front yard and the back yard with sea views are very elegant. The service level is high and can meet the basic requirements of a five-star hotel. The room sanitation is acceptable. The breakfast is satisfactory. All rooms have large balconies, which is a big hotel. The highlight is a hotel that is often suitable for couples to spend a quiet vacation. During the check-in period, the maintenance staff of the toilet ceiling solved it as soon as possible. After check-out, the after-sales staff actively greeted by phone. There is no hotel without problems. Guan Jian is the speed and attitude of dealing with the problem, plus the mentality of staying in the hotel. Will return to St. Regis next year!

msg:St. Regis has complete facilities and convenient transportation. It is also relatively close to Baihua Valley and can be reached quickly by calling a taxi. The service is attentive. There are always some items left or lost during travel. I am very grateful to the guest relations manager Shirley and her colleagues for helping me find my lost bag. It is always beautiful to feel lost and found. Shirley also called me immediately to verify the item information, which was also very rigorous and appropriate. Shirley made me feel safe at St. Regis by choosing here. And super invincible. The butler Skr promptly delivered my belongings to me as needed. My friend's sea view room had a great view and I highly recommend it. My landscaping is also pretty good. You must take photos and check in at the transparent Internet celebrity swimming pool. In one word, it is very beautiful! Feeling relaxed and happy! ! Opened ten years ago, the facilities are a bit old, but the service is online. Thanks again to Shirley and the staff for helping me, and I wish you all the best in the future! There is also a strong Chris**as a**osphere, which the children are looking forward to.

msg:The St. Regis Hotel in Yalong Bay opened relatively early, but after seeing the 2018 renovation written by Ctrip, I booked the result. After checking in, I found that the bathtub in the room was slightly yellowed and the coat hook in the bathroom was something. It's rusty and it's really falling off. What's worse is that I found a dead fly on the ground as soon as I entered it. It is indeed a bit inconsistent with the price of this brand. The housekeeper also doesn't know what kind of existence. I have to urge for the final check-out. It is very positive to ask if I am satisfied with our stay. The day of our check-in coincides with the tenth anniversary of the hotel. What activities are there since the afternoon, the scenery is noisy, and people come and go, it feels very noisy. At night, our balcony was just right. It‚Äôs so noisy towards the central lawn sound system. I waited until late at night and started to tear down the daytime scenery until midnight. I felt that it affected the guest‚Äôs rest. I stayed in this hotel for the first time and I had insomnia. I really don‚Äôt know how to be satisfied with the housekeeper. After breakfast, no one asked if they needed coffee or tea. The noodles were made and messed up. . . What's more weird is how many crane machines are there on the first floor of the hotel? ? ? I don‚Äôt know what the designer deliberately added?

Room facilities:
There are fresh fruits and a free mini bar! It also comes with bath salts. Very a**ospheric!
breakfast:
Very rich, but there are too many people. And it ends at eleven o'clock, which is convenient for people who want to sleep in.
swimming pool:
The glass swimming pool is great for taking pictures, and the family swimming pool has a great view!

The butler service attitude is really good throughout the whole process, and you must answer any questions. I like the real name. My butler Shirley is very enthusiastic. Before and after check-out, he also asked for feedback on various needs and felt that he paid much attention to customers. The service feels very luxurious! A quality state of life.

msg:This is my first time coming to St. Regis after the epidemic. The first time was in 2012. Ten years later, St. Regis is as good as ever, even more outstanding and considerate.
Although due to the epidemic, the current occupancy rate is not as high as the same period in previous years, this does not affect the quality of service that guests receive here. My "God" feeling started before I even checked in.
A few days before joining the company, someone from the customer service depar**ent asked us about our preferences during our stay, from bedding to indoor lighting, from special room requirements to schedule. Honeymoon trea**ent was upgraded for free. This appropriate courtesy is the best gift St. Regis and Sanya have given us.
After ten years of journey, the rooms and furnishings of St. Regis Hotel do not feel outdated. On the contrary, there is more of a sense of the intersection of Eastern and Western art. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and the dinner sea view set menu, top-quality steak, lamb chops, seafood and fine wine make the sea in front of you more vivid and beautiful. There are more than ten days before Chris**as, and the Chris**as decoration here has been completed. The strong festive a**osphere has added more joy to the beautiful St. Regis and the guests.
The size of St. Regis is obvious to all. Covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã200,000 square meters, it is the largest St. Regis hotel in the world. The villas are so handsome. I love the huge lawns, trees, various birds, and beautiful peacocks. Although I can't swim, its large and beautiful heated swimming pool is also a highlight.
The tranquility of St. Regis is what I love most, and this is where the resort comes from.
The sea and beach at St. Regis are private, and you can have a panoramic view of the sunrise.
The rooms at St. Regis are large, and ordinary rooms are 80 square meters. When I come here, I feel as free and happy as at home.
St. Regis' butler service is not a slogan. Every move and thought of every employee here fulfills St. Regis's mission.
Thanks to Xiao Yuan who arranged and decorated the room for us. Thanks to our personal butler Xiao Liu. You are beautiful and handsome, and your service is beyond five-star. You are the epitome of St. Regis people. Your service is worthy of the beauty of St. Regis and the reputation of St. Regis [strong][strong][strong]
We come to Sanya every year, and St. Regis is our ultimate choice.

1. The service of the butler really warms people's hearts. I quickly integrate into a new environment. I didn't quite understand the service of the butler at the beginning. After I came, it was really warm and heartwarming. If you need anything, you can find the housekeeper, and quickly and do your best to solve it
2. I‚Äôm hungry and want to ask if the restaurant is open, just one WeChat will solve it
3. The most heartwarming thing is that cervical spondylosis has developed and I need a yoga mat. The housekeeper really showed me what it means to do my best.
So the price and price/performance ratio is also very worth experiencing
But the facilities are indeed outdated and hope to refurbish it soon.
ps: Butler and guest services are really different
Finally, thank my little butler Scarlett Du Yan, you make me very warm. Thanks!

Several hotels have their own advantages, but St. Regis‚Äôs one-to-one butler service is the best. Our experience completely exceeded expectations. The main point of the painting: To live in St. Regis, you must choose Victor Chen Yongchao's butler! Thank you very much Victor butler for giving us a perfect and unforgettable holiday! Victor butlers are super reliable and enthusiastic. After understanding our two-day itinerary plan, they intimately helped us arrange the contents of the package properly! I caught up with the typhoon and kept raining on the day of check-in. I was very depressed. I didn't expect that Regis had a private theater, where I could lie down and watch the movies being shown in the theater. There were only two of us, and the feeling of chartering was great.
The hotel is large in size and looks like a tropical botanical garden as a whole. The blue sky and white clouds with large lawns and sandy beaches are too beautiful. Wearing bright colored skirts can be too glamorous. You don't need to go to the scenic spots at all. Just lie flat by the hotel swimming pool. The breakfast is great. Chinese and Western dishes are available. The roasted dragon fruit is sweet. It is best to go early or there may be queues.
As we arrived early on the day of check-in, the butler also invited us to drink coffee and juice. It can be seen that we paid great attention to the feelings of the guests. The hotel helped us upgrade to the Supreme Ocean View Room for free. The room has a large view and American style decoration. The facilities mentioned in the comments are outdated, but in fact they are totally overwhelmed! I think the hardware facilities in the room are very new, tidy and clean, and there is no sanitary corner. You can also take a bath while watching the sea in the bathroom. During the two days of staying, Victor‚Äôs butler also gave us fruit plates and cheesecakes. On the last day, he arranged for a Mercedes-Benz S400 to take us to the airport. I was so touched.
In short, St. Regis is definitely the first choice for Yalong Bay vacation! Recommended recommended recommended!

PS: If you are satisfied with the photos, you can buy all the negatives for 599 yuan if you are satisfied with the photos.
PS: There is a Dongrong food court near the hotel where you can eat and drink, and you can pick up and drop off for free.

Speaking of St. Regis, I had to mention St. Regis‚Äôs butler service, especially Victor C. Before coming again, I called to ask us what special requirements we have. Because the elderly are inconvenient to move, I helped us carefully prepare wheelchairs and arranged for the car to arrive.

msg:Although there are many five-star hotels in Yalong Bay, St. Regis will never let you down. Cici, the butler, started to introduce it actively before moving in, and understood the needs, and tried his best to meet them, very gentle and caring. Although the hotel opened earlier and was renovated compared to the popular Edison, Atlantis is definitely old but well maintained. Compared with the Ritz-Carlton on the side, I personally feel that the luxury of service and experience is still high Some, or that sentence, Regis will never be disappointed

msg:I took my baby on a trip alone. Before I checked in, I received a hush from the butler from Victor Chen Yongchao. Because it was raining in Sanya, Mr. Chen deliberately drove us to pick us up. The bubble machine was arranged for me and my child. The free drinks and fruit in my room were not finished, and I received the fruit from Mr. Chen in the evening. The St. Regis hotel is really where I have stayed at home and abroad so far. , The hotel with the best service, it is hard to imagine so many guests, and each one has taken care of the workload. It seems to be a service, but it is actually a friend, thank you! Thanks again to Victor and Duty Manager Nicole Yang for their help üôè By the way, I am also willing to write a review for the first time. Yesterday a hotel called me and asked me to write a review.

If you communicate with your girlfriends, consider having beaches, lawns, sea views, listening to the sea, and taking pictures. This is the reason why St. Regis is still the first choice when you come to Sanya. It is picturesque, surrounded by mountains and rivers, and it is easy to enjoy here. It brings a pleasant sense of relaxation. The hotel services are also in place, especially the Peter of the concierge and the concierge. The friends are very enthusiastic when consulting questions, and can solve our needs in time, and they still feel very relaxed when they come back again. There is also my housekeeper Victor and Nimo at the front desk. They have a very good service attitude. They care about customer needs at any time and can deliver things to the room in time when they need things. At the same time, the front desk arranges rooms according to my needs, which can almost meet the requirements. My best friend is very happy to travel, and I look forward to seeing Sanya St. Regis next time ü§ó

This time I stayed in a large cloakroom. I upgraded the sea view room for a fee. It also has a great sea view and a beautiful swimming pool. Needless to say, the hotel walked directly to the beach.
We had lunch and dinner in the coconut grove and lounge chair pool bar and the seaside western restaurant! very satisfied with the spa~
There are private home theaters, and they will be released simultaneously. The service is excellent. Manager Shirley responds very quickly, Shirley is very nice and gentle. I always have various requests for several calls a day, and I always respond to everything, hahaha~
I also recommend the hotel's villa hhh. The villa was stayed by a friend this time. I went there and it was really comfortable. I will also book a villa next time. In short, I have had a great time with Regis, and I look forward to seeing you next time!

We are very touched. Even the small problems of Ctrip have been solved perfectly for us. Anyway, I feel at ease living here. I don‚Äôt have to worry about anything. Taking pictures on vacation is very comfortable. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel. The rooms are really big and the facilities are very new. I can't see it at all. It has been opened for almost ten years. The view outside the window is also top-notch balcony. I can see that it is the circle of friends in the sea. The pool is very clean and there are not many people. There will be no dumplings. The whole hotel is very private and very private. Anyway, St. Regis will be the place I will come again~ see you next year!

msg:I lived in Haitang Bay two days ago, and stayed at St Regis the last night, I really felt that I had come to Sanya! Praise the butler Cici, the communication is proactive and efficient, give me a üëçüèª. Now let‚Äôs talk about the hotel experience. Self-driving is very convenient, there is an underground garage with a straight lobby, and guests can park for free. However, the check-in area is not clear enough at a glance. Every step must wait for the guidance of the staff. Pay attention to waiting to be guided, rather than the staff actively approaching and guiding. Compared with the guided receptions of other luxury hotels, there is the same process arrangement, and the St. Regis check-in is a bit embarrassing. I dragged my luggage and fumbled to the door of the check-in area, then smiled and greeted you and stopped you and said, "You don't need to bring your luggage in. We will arrange to send it to the room. It feels like we were intercepted halfway." Perhaps the housekeeper had the heart to help arrange the highest floor in advance. The view of the mountains and lakes from the room must be much better than the sea view room on rainy days. I am very satisfied. Speaking of breakfast, the breakfast experience usually reflects the management level of a hotel. Not sure if it was because of the National Day (the actual flow of people on the island is completely controllable, there are not many), no one took a seat after entering the restaurant, I went in and walked around by myself before I found an empty seat. At the scene, a guest took the other person's seat by mistake, and the staff assisted the guest to move their seat. As a result, they mistakenly took the dishes that the guest had placed on the table and gave them to the guests who arrived later, which caused some unpleasantness. This is the first time I met this kind of Oolong incident in a hotel. In addition, different waiters in the hotel accidentally dropped glasses and tableware twice. This error frequency is a bit high. The style and taste of the dishes are very good. Compared with the old five-star brand of Haitang Bay where I lived before, it is a skyline higher. As for the hotel's environment and facilities, including sanitation, they are all excellent, so Virgo can't pick out the corners of sanitation. Generally speaking, the hotel is better in terms of environmental facilities and services. The waiters are very polite and kind. In terms of breakfast management and check-in process guidance, it needs to be significantly improved, and it is almost perfect.

The room is spacious enough, 73 square meters of room, double bed 1.5 meters wide, only Capella's double bed width can be comparable (cost-effective St. Regis is really good üëçüèª), the row of the St. Regis Yalong Bay 5-star hotel The twin rooms are 1.35 meters wide or less, and the area is less than 70 square meters. The garden view can still see the sea, which is very good. The hardware equipment is of high grade and well maintained. The slippers are really comfortable to wear. I especially want to bring 2 pairs home with my wife to wear. The room is sanitary twice a day. On the day of check-out, he will call me for free late check-out. 2. The butler service is responsive. Because my big treasure likes to eat fruits, the butler CiCi also thoughtfully arranged a fruit plate. Arranged 2 tickets for the private theater included in the room, and showed me Dabao to see Pikachu. I want to watch the premiere of Changjin Lake, so I can save 2 tickets. The kids club is not too big or small. Take Dabao to play two-person karting. Upon check-in, I gave the children a set of tools for playing with sand, as well as small toys. 3. The scenic area is full of scenery, which is great. The swimming pool is very nice, open until 10 o'clock in the evening, it is necessary to check in. The staff will take the initiative to say hello when they see the guests! The quality is good. 4. Breakfast is ok, the most important thing is free ice latte, I accidentally drank 2 cups. The Chinese restaurant produces very authentic products, divided into three types: southern, northern, and Sichuan. We ate the southern taste, which was quite authentic. The only thing is that the desserts in the Chinese restaurant are too sweet. 5. After staying for 3 days, I feel just soaking in the hotel. There are a lot of things for children to play with. Wake up early in the morning for a walk, go for a walk on the beach at sunset, and come back for a seafood buffet. 6. The only small regret is that the Mita Tower not far away was demolished. Before I came, I told my family Dabao that I would take him to see Grandpa Rabbit‚Äôs lighthouse.

Before check-in: Victor will call us in advance and then pull a WeChat group. If you request in advance, you can tell him and he will make arrangements for us.

After check-in: As soon as we arrived at the door of the hotel victor, we were greeted, so we don't have to worry about the whole process. Check in smoothly.

Room: Victor helped us arrange a sea view room with the best view in advance. The room is super big, you can also see the sea view from the toilet and bathtub.

Hotel facilities: There are two swimming pools, one for adults and one for children. Adults and children can be separated from each other without being affected.

Hotel breakfast: 9am -11pm (very considerate)

Hotel service: The hotel staff have the souvenir of a five-star hotel (unlike some hotels with a five-star, but the service cannot be complimented)

After leaving: We booked MGM‚Äôs parent-child hotel for the next two nights. When we arrived, oh my god, it was like entering a nursery school. We were shocked to see this scene because of our two girlfriends. We asked the front desk if we could arrange a check-in. For rooms with fewer children, the front desk told me: No way, this! It's a parent-child hotel! After calling Ctrip to arrange a free check-out, Victor is still confirming that we will stay at other hotels. After we talked about the situation, we said we were going to Shangri-La in Haitang Bay. He immediately said that there is a shuttle bus. If it is too late, let us quickly prepare to take the shuttle bus. I am really grateful.

Sincerely thank Ctrip customer service and St. Regis for their services! Five-star praise!

When I was younger, I went to Yalong Bay with my family for vacation, often going to Marriott or Pullman. Now I went out to play and found that there were more and more tourists in that area, and Haitang Bay was too parent-child, the waves were big, and expensive, and I didn't like it very much, so I decided to try the more remote St. Regis, and found the treasure. The St. Regis‚Äôs rooms are well maintained and the staff is enthusiastic, especially our housekeeper Lucky, who confirms the details with us before we arrive at the hotel and introduces us to the hotel‚Äôs services; it always surprises us during our vacation. The lady was especially happy. Although the restaurant where the hotel‚Äôs breakfast is located is relatively crowded, Shengzai‚Äôs hotel is as exquisite as possible. The omelette and sliced noodles are very popular. The beach in front of the hotel is very quiet and the water is very clear; this time I saw a 10,000-ton drive on the beach in reality, which was particularly pleasant. Always, the St. Regis Yalong Bay has given us one of the most memorable vacation experiences in these years, five-star praise, no doubt!

I saw the sea outside during breakfast the next day, my god, it was so good! The beach, the swimming pool, and the Coconut Grove Avenue are all very suitable for taking pictures. Ordered Mrs. Astor's afternoon tea, which is simply luxurious.
As a veteran luxury hotel, St. Regis really reveals low-key luxury in every decoration. Because there are not many people, we upgraded from guest rooms to suites for free.
If there is any flaw in the flaws, it is that St. Regis's travel photographers are of average level, and I suggest that you can change to a cooperative photography agency.

msg:A very pleasant stay, the St. Regis Yalong Bay deserves to be the top brand in Yalong Bay, and the environmental facilities are worthy of a five-star hotel! Special thanks to the butler zooey, since I checked in, I have been very enthusiastic about the room facilities, breakfast time, etc., especially because I needed to check out late due to the receipt of important documents at three o'clock, but the hotel is close to the weekend, but the housekeeper Zooey and the hotel applied for me to delay the check-out. Check out by 3:30, thank you very much! Next time Yalong Bay must come to the St. Regis Hotel!

The next morning, the strong sunshine also gave us a hat and a bubble machine. The hotel environment is very good, the lawn and swimming pool are well maintained, and the rooms are very big!

msg:As plan b, who was unable to live on Boundary Island due to a sudden typhoon on the weekend, decided to live in St. Regis on the spot, so the speed was confirmed, and the whole was quite satisfied.
The only downside may be that there are a lot of people for breakfast, the waiting arrangement is not reasonable, the taste of the dishes is slightly lower than expected, and it is a small disappoin**ent.

üöó Traffic: Quiet in the noisy area, suitable for self-driving check-in, there are still many guests staying on Friday.

üßπSanitation: The room is very clean, and the hardware is relatively new.

üçÉEnvironment: The infinity pool is very large, the beach is white and soft, and the sea is very clear.

üîîService: The butler anson service is in place, very considerate, reasonable arrangements, and efficient in handling the situation.

msg:Recommended reason/unforgettable point: butler service, facilities, room ‚ù§Ô∏è
1. Background: I was extremely entangled in many five-star hotels in Sanya, and finally chose to stay at the Yalong Bay St. Regis for one night and the Ritz-Carlton for one night.
2. Conclusion: My mother and I agree that St. Regis is better. It is our super love. We will choose St. Regis in the future!
3. Reason:
1) Butler service: Most of the bonuses of our wonderful experience are attributed to the service of Zooey, the butler, which blows up to me! ! ! Mother's cleanliness, high demands + getting older, it is really not easy to make my mother super satisfied. She is very demanding on pillows, room floors, timely response, etc. Zooey does a great job in all aspects! And my mother's Mandarin is not good, zooey is also very patient in all aspects. When I have any needs, such as coming to the beach to pick us up when it rains, I am also on call. I'm so good to send my hat and bubble machine to me! for me This is the most practical souvenir in Sanya! In short, I am really grateful and very happy! Thank you zooey~
2) Room: My package was originally upgraded to a garden-view suite, but due to my mother's sleep, after applying with the front desk, the lady at the front desk gave us a free upgrade to a sea-view twin room. I want to say, St. Regis's sea view twin room, YYDS! The big furniture can watch the videos and pictures I took. I can only say that there is no shock to the naked eye! Sisters are all rushing to me! Large shower room + ocean view bathtub, (by the way, zooey gave us a disposable bathtub cover as soon as he came, i'm so sweet!) In short, the stay is super comfortable!
3) Hotel facilities: What is the smell of St. Regis's cinema? What's the smell of St. Regis's swimming pool? Regis's coconut grove is not fragrant, what's the fragrance? What's the smell of St. Regis's lawn? Go to the coconut grove to check in, just shoot at St. Regis! In short, when the film was released, all my selfies were taken in St. Regis hahaha!
4) Service: In addition to zooey's meticulous care, all the service staff from the front desk to every occasional encounter are extremely meticulous and caring. The fact that there is a stool to sit in the reception is really much better than the Ritz-Carlton... the whole process. The privacy and dignity of the experience made me feel really enjoyable!
5) Suggestion: breakfast and really need to be improved:)

In short, I like Regis very much, and I also hate Regis, because after this experience I will compare it everywhere... alas... (ÁãóÂ§¥)

Will come again in the future! I have already recommended it to friends in the circle of friends, hehe!

msg:This time I came to Sanya for my honeymoon. After careful selection, MGM and Regis were ordered. In contrast, MGM is more pyrotechnic, has a lot of parent-child facilities, and rich marine projects; St. Regis is more private, with mountains and sea, surrounded by scenery, beautiful, and a free upgrade to a sea-view suite when you check in. Here I would like to thank the butler Eden for his attentive service, who helped us make reservations for movies, send fruit plates, and so on. The disadvantage is that the hotel is being renovated when you check in, and the smell of formaldehyde is relatively large; the off-season breakfast is relatively simple, and the standard is not good.

The important thing is that every floor is cleaned by staff every day. It is really very clean and the details are well done. The privacy is very, very good. There are many kinds of breakfast, and the hygiene is very good. The baby is very happy playing in St. Regis.

It is suitable to bring children to play or couples to take pictures. At the same time, St. Regis's butler service is also perfect. Stayed at so many St. Regis hotels. I think Sanya St. Regis is the most perfect St. Regis. At the same time, I would like to thank the butler Eden for his warm service and I am looking forward to the next meeting.

msg:A group of friends traveled together, first went to Atlantis, lively, suitable for driving a baby crazy. After arriving at St. Regis, I felt very quiet, an ideal place to sleep and wake up naturally. You can also play with children. There are swimming pools with awnings and slides, and there are also transparent heated swimming pools with net celebrities, ranging from 0.9 meters to 1.6 meters, suitable for all kinds of people to swim. It‚Äôs just 1.6 meters away to exercise. No one bothers at all. It‚Äôs cool. Most of the children are on the slides and the transparent swimming pool. There are also many land projects to play, such as karts and paintings. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a courier today. It turned out to be a superman piggy bank painted by a child. I didn't expect to receive such a gift at all, an unexpected surprise. At breakfast, there are clown balloons and magicians‚Äô performances, and the children and magicians learned a lot. In the evening before leaving, I finally took the most satisfying photo I took in my life. During the epidemic, look at the photos and yearn for the next beautiful vacation.

msg:The wedding held in the St. Regis Yalong Bay in 2013 is a hotel with memories. This time I took my children to Sanya and chose to stay here. The hotel facilities are a bit old, but as a hotel that has been open for more than 10 years, it is maintained as it is now and the landscape is still very good. The central swimming pool and the sea view are all beautiful. The privacy of the hotel in the innermost area of Yalong Bay is also very good. 7 years ago, the room was spacious and beautiful. There are not many people in either the family pool or the central pool. Our two large and two small beds were originally set for a superior sea view bed for four people. The hotel was a bit crowded. The hotel added an adult bed for free and also changed to a deluxe sea view room. Thank you very much for the hotel‚Äôs karting It‚Äôs very fun. The children played for several days. The breakfast was quite satisfactory. The Chinese restaurant was as good as ever. It is worth mentioning that the butler of St. Regis serves our butler is a young and beautiful Hainanese girl. Vivian gave us a birthday cake for my birthday and also bought flowers for me. It was very good for me to order the restaurant and decorate the room. Then the parking lot charge problem was also solved in time for us and also sent afternoon tea to the hotel. Vivian added me to WeChat as soon as possible. If you need to send a WeChat to Vivian, she will reply and solve it as soon as possible. In short, this trip to Sanya is perfect.

But the two restaurants for breakfast are really frustrating. The Chinese restaurant is like a small hotel, and the variety is average and the taste is average. Secondly, the service is also very general, no wonder the peak season of such top hotels is only around 2,000 yuan. Generally speaking, I personally feel that it is not as good as Ritz Carlton next to her.

The scenery of St. Regis is indeed bigger and more beautiful than the Ritz! The transparent swimming pool is also beautiful, but the room facilities and style are not as good as Ritz, and the whole is a bit old! The corridor floor is also some years old, the walls, sofas, etc. are not very beautiful. The type and taste of breakfast are not as good as Ritz, but the scenery and beach are worse than Ritz. It is easy to take pictures. If you book a hotel trip, you will get 5 free photos. If you exceed 30 yuan, the price is more expensive than Haitang Bay, but the effect is still better. Satisfied~ The overall service staff is OK. I booked a superior sea-view room. The room arranged at the beginning was not satisfied. It was directly opposite to the room building, and then changed to the 5th floor, which is facing the sea view. Blocked by the tree, the view is not very good~ It seems that next time you will get the Supreme Ocean View Room

msg:I have to go to Sanya to relax once a year. I have never lived in St. Regis before. When I stayed for the first time, St. Regis‚Äôs butler service is very distinctive. The day before arrival, I will actively contact customers and wait in the lobby when I arrive. WeChat greetings, the service is very considerate. I also sent a fruit plate for two days. The hotel's swimming pool is also good, suitable for children to play. The beach of the hotel is not recommended. If you want to swim in the sea, you have to step on a section of rocks and feet. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast types are sufficient. The overall service is good. I did a SPA and arranged a bubble bath for two consecutive days. The service was really good. St. Regis is recommended for vacation.

msg:The hotel is close to the mountains and the sea, with good concealment and relatively quiet. The net celebrity glass swimming pool is the highlight, and there is another children's swimming pool with awning, so you are not afraid of rain and exposure. Staying in the garden view, the room size is moderate, the bathroom shower and bathtub are connected together, and the design is reasonable. Eileen, the housekeeper, is attentive and prompt. Ask if you have any special needs before moving in, and help arrange extra beds for free. Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages: the children‚Äôs playground is relatively small, and many activities have to be charged separately; the children‚Äôs pool has only two water slides for adults, so children‚Äôs playability is not high. The breakfast queuing level is similar to that of the Hilton next to it. The hotel is relatively large, and there are many customers staying in it, which is understandable. The whole family is accustomed to getting up early, so they didn‚Äôt catch up with the queue for a long time. The breakfast variety is moderate and nothing was done. The hotel is close to the yacht‚Äôs entrance to the sea, so the beach is not suitable for playing. It‚Äôs okay for children to dig sand. Choose those with higher sand quality requirements. . Generally speaking, I will consider staying at St. Regis next time.

msg:This is the fourth time I came to Sanya, and I still miss the beach and sunset of Yalong Bay, so I chose to stay in Yalong Bay for two days during the itinerary, and I chose a St. Regis hotel that I haven‚Äôt stayed in. To be honest, the rooms at St. Regis are really not very new. Yes, but the maintenance is good, the room is clean and tidy, the two beds are oversized, the wet and dry are separated, and the double-sided table is set against the sea view, which is by no means inferior to the new hotel. Breakfast is also both Chinese and Western style, as well as Hainan special snacks. What struck me the most was St. Regis‚Äôs butler service, which is commendable. St. Regis‚Äôs butler service is not simply responsive, but exceptional. The butler Arya called me one day in advance to ask about my check-in needs and added me to WeChat. Then, I started to introduce to me the weather in Sanya, the food near the hotel... In the case of such a full room, I still helped me upgrade the room type, asked us about the itinerary for the next station, and applied for a delayed check-out. We stayed for two days, warm and considerate all the time, making our stay so perfect and impeccable. We are all thinking about the next trip to Sanya, the St. Regis will definitely choose the hotel.

Anyway, if there is anything, send us a WeChat to mark. He is always patient and caring to reply. It‚Äôs warm. The fruits in the room are free to eat every day. They are fresh and sweet. I missed the crab catching time in the evening. I specially booked a one-on-one crab catching service for me. The little guy was very happy. I never knew that the crabs came from a small hole. Climbed out, the environment of the hotel is also super üëçüèª! The family had a great time

The interior of the hotel is beautiful, and the housekeeper Nina serves Very good, take the child to prepare the bed, special washing for children, and St. Regis's cute calf, fruit plate and so on. On the last day of the morning flight, I didn‚Äôt have time to eat breakfast. I packed bread and mineral water for us. It‚Äôs really considerate. I will go to St. Regis next time.

The hotel rooms are large and the environment is beautiful, especially there is a covered swimming pool with sun protection. Children especially like the crab catching activity in the hotel. The kids were very happy this time on vacation, and we were also very satisfied.

msg:The breakfast is okay, the variety is not too small, divided into Chinese and Western restaurants, but the Chinese flavor still likes Chinese restaurants. The room is very good, the bed is very comfortable, and the bathroom is like a double vanity. The most praiseworthy thing is the butler service. Someone will help you solve all kinds of needs during the whole process. It is very good. My friend‚Äôs children brought breakfast and toiletries for free, and we upgraded our room. The experience was perfect. Considering that we had to wait for a while and gave late check-out service, in short, people felt that the standard and service of a five-star hotel were beyond expectation. It was a strong gift to friends Amway. I would like to think about it during the Chinese New Year. Bring your parents over to play and stay here next time you come to Sanya. Oh, by the way, my housekeeper is Chen Yongchao, give him a thumbs up.

Especially the housekeeper Arya, who took the initiative to add WeChat to guide me before the trip, and introduced all aspects of the hotel during my stay, helped me book various activities and restaurants, and made me truly feel at home! I also gave a small gift when I checked out üéÅ, which surprised me. No wonder those who have stayed in St. Regis praised it well, it is really awesome!

The pool double bed, two 1.5-meter beds, two large and two small beds are enough to sleep, there is pick-up service, considerate butler service, you must give the butler Eileen a five-star praise, great praise, I arranged the room in advance, and gave the kids calves and sand dredging tools. There were answers during the whole process, professionalism and patience. Thank you very much! There are many activities for children every day in the hotel. Crab digging at night is also quite fun. In addition to the temperature-controlled swimming pool, there is also a shaded family swimming pool. Stayed for three nights. In terms of dining, breakfast was excellent. Mingxuan Chinese Restaurant has several set menus to choose from, and the price is good. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose St. Regis.

msg:Worthy of being the "leading" hotel in Yalong Bayüè®
Although the small details can still reflect the sense of age, the hardware and software facilities inside and outside the room are almost impeccable!
Especially the service, our housekeeper Vivian is really helpful. I must thank her for helping me find the out-of-print GM glasses that I lost in the lobby. I also replaced the hair dryer in time. See sincere details for the details. I would like to praise Regisüëç Like the kind vivian üëç

The breakfast time around 10 o'clock is really crowded, and there is even a need to queue for a while, but the variety is rich, the combination of Chinese and Western, and everything is clean, very good, and meets all the standards of a five-star hotel. There are also balloon clowns that specialize in coaxing children, so it is difficult to meet a little devil who runs around and barks. It is so friendly to us without children!

The hotel‚Äôs travel shots are also good. They can be shot before six o'clock. The swimming pools at the seaside are good. The photographers are all experienced photographers. Five free copies are given, and the remaining 30 copies need to be paid separately.

Hey tea, Starbucks takeaway will be delivered soon, which is a bit cool!

The capsule coffee in the room is also thoughtfully prepared,
There are champagne glasses, goblet glasses, go to the balcony to have a drink at night
, Really full of artistic conceptionüíØ

Overall it can be 95 points, next time I will live in St. Regis, I will find the lovely vivian!

The hotel provides a Tesla charging station It is more convenient for friends who drive by tram. I think the breakfast provided by the hotel is a bit general and the taste is very ordinary.

The children‚Äôs playroom and children‚Äôs pool are large, covered, and not exposed to the sun during the day. This is what makes me most satisfied. The thoughtfulness of the hotel is reflected in these details. My housekeeper, Song Xiaoshen, is also very responsible. She upgraded the room and gave small gifts to the children. She took the initiative to provide the baby with cribs and bed circumferences, thinking about what customers want and what they want. The only small regret is that the infinity pool is being repaired. This also gives us hope and hopes that the next encounter will be more beautiful!

msg:The whole hotel is very good, with a Southeast Asian decoration style. The open lobby is cool, but Vivian, the butler, gave the dolls before leaving.
The room is large and the bedding is just right. You can relax in the room after going out for a day. There are two washbasins in the bathroom, so two people can wash at the same time without disturbing each other. The walk-in bathtub really makes me love it.
The sea angle of the first room was not good enough. After reacting to the housekeeper, we quickly changed rooms and showed us several times until we found one that was very satisfied. The last room I stayed in was amazing! I want to live here for a yearüò≠
It is a pity that because it is the off-season that the transparent swimming pool of the Internet celebrity is being upgraded, the hotel is also partly under renovation, but! The balcony door soundproof is super good! Can't hear any sound at all (we were working on it downstairs but we weren't noisy at all)
What I want to improve: The response speed of the staff will be a bit slow when needed, but the hotel is really big and they have to come over. It is understandable but I hope it can be faster. I thought that the hotel‚Äôs beach can be used to swim directly in the sea, but the sand quality is not very good and there are a lot of reefs. The beach loungers are not on the beach but connected to the table above, but there is a good place to wash your feet next to it.
Overall, I think it is flawless and I like it very pleasantly! The service attitude of all staff is also very good! I love this hotel so much

The pool room was too convenient, swimming at any time, the child was very happy. Now it was decided to stay for two nights. The key is that the housekeeper Victor Chen Yongchao's caring service makes us feel at home, the children should be fully prepared with everything, more for the baby's birthday cake. Under his arrangement, we had a pleasant and full 4 days holiday.
Originally worried that the hotel parent-child activities are not enough, the result is 4 days down, 3.5 years old children have not finished all the activities, the hotel parent-child activities for younger children is enough.
The food is basically eaten in Ming - Tong Chinese Restaurant, exquisite and delicious, very satisfied.
The children expressed their satisfaction and were happy to burst, because they missed the dog at home and went back, but asked us to promise to come back later.
