msg:We came in October and we liked the hotel so much that we decided to come back again in December during Christmas holidays. We stayed in one villa to have more space and it was amazing! Alex ( thanks a lot for making perfect our holidays!) helped us to move to another villa with great sea view the following day we arrived. If you are in a villa you can have the breakfast buffet ( really good mixing Chinese and western food) in its beach restaurant Horizon, looking at the ocean, which is really nice. Another important thing is that the outdoor swimming pool next to the lobby is warm! So even though is December, you can enjoy swimming. We love this pool and being able to reach the great beach in one minute! Alex also helped us to book at the Chinese restaurant and at the end year party. We tried the Korean restaurant too. All these experiences were perfect: the food, the service, the environment‚Ä¶ Le meridien is one of our favorite hotels in Hainan ( for all these reasons and for its great staff like Alex!)! We will come back soon!

msg:We stayed in one of the renovated rooms - it was very spacious and overall well-maintained for Chinese standards. The resort is beautiful and especially the gym we liked a lot. They offer lounges at the beach which is also a great benefit and not so common in China. There‚Äôs no service at the beach though. They officially don‚Äôt allow you to swim but you can surf and it‚Äôs not as strict as in other bays in Hainan. 

The major disadvantage about this resort is the service - we tried to eat cake at the restaurant ‚ÄúHorizon‚Äù at 4:20 pm. Unfortunately the waitress told us that they don‚Äôt serve cake at this time - only between 2pm and 4pm and after 6pm. So, we were 20 mins late and even after asking whether there is maybe some specific cake left they insisted that they can only serve drinks. This was very bad service. 
The other things we didn‚Äôt like was the breakfast - the room is smelly (not for food) and way too small for so many guests. The selection was ok, but the quality could be improved and very often the food was not refilled. 
At the end of the stay we wanted to get the Bonvoy discount on the food we had - other than all other hotels we‚Äôve stayed at in Hainan they only give 10% discount - not 30% - they say it‚Äôs the official rule which might be true, but other hotels give more discount so it‚Äôs still a bit disappointing.

Breakfast was Ok. But the thing that stands out during our trip was their customer service. Initially we planned to stay for 4 days but we needed to leave earlier for some personal reasons and they made it very easier, helped us to check with Ctrip and also refund the money. I would like to mention Ms. Ivy who was continuously in touch with us and also helped us to rent a car and for parking. Her client services made our stay AMAZING and smooth and we appreciate it a lot. We would love to go back there again.

However, the hotel has been very good and accommodating. I would like to mention Ivy specifically. She has been helping me with all my questions and requests even before I arrived Sanya. She connected me to a car rental company. She helped me to cancel my booking. Every of my request was met just because she was very very helpful. An exemplary employee!

I will certainly come back to Wanning and stay at the Le Meridien.

My view is that the management team in this hotel are not capable to maintain the standards needed to give a truly memorable experience- rather the place feels it has cut costs everywhere...  did I mention the food was absolutely shocking? Gym equipment broken- no maintenance.

Would never go back and would never recommend this place.  In fact, I am trying to share this with the hotel GM, but she (as expected) has made no effort to get in touch.

I am not the only one who feels the same...

msg:I have to write about Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay in great detail.
Let me start with Zard, the front desk butler.
I have stayed at Tianyu in Yalong Bay, Westin in Qingshui Bay, Weipers in Lingshui, Raffles in Qingshui Bay, and Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay.
Objectively speaking, Zard at the front desk is the most responsible, proactive, and attentive front desk butler I have ever met in so many hotels.
From the very beginning, he would call and ask on WeChat how many children, whether there are any special requirements, how old the children are, etc. before checking in, and he would sort out the fun guides around Shimei Bay and send them to me. Oh, and there are two groups, one parent-child group and one adult group, which are really good.
So I had a good impression of Le M√©ridien from the very beginning.
Let's talk about hotel activities.
If the parent-child group at Tianyu is lively and playful, Raffles is elegant and quiet, and Westin and Weipers are pure nonsense, then I personally think Le M√©ridien is thoughtful, interesting and of high quality.
The organization is orderly and the projects are clear at a glance.
Paddle board, beach football, bubble party, etc. are all popular forms, and there are not many people at the same time, which is very experiential.
Speaking of personal activities, Amy is really good.
Let's talk about the sea and the beach.
Raffles in Qingshui Bay is our favorite in Lingshui. The sea is quiet, clear and intoxicating.
After coming to Amy in Shimei Bay, I was surprised that this beach is not inferior to Qingshui Bay at all, and there are more interesting activities, and you can even experience the excitement of surfing directly.
The most worth mentioning is the reef area next to Amy. It is a good place to catch the sea. Baby goes to catch sand crabs, sea crabs, fish, etc. every night, and then releases them.
In terms of ecology, Raffles and Amy are great, as can be seen from the number of snails on the ground. In addition, squirrels can be seen everywhere in the trees in Amy's hotel.
Let's talk about service.
Amy's service, at least the front desk and room-related staff, is quite satisfactory. They are responsive, not procrastinating, and not delayed.
As for the service level of the restaurant, maybe we don't understand the system, but it's pretty good anyway, and there is room for improvement.
Oh, by the way, the self-service hot pot is very cost-effective. The price in Wanning is high. You can easily spend two or three hundred yuan per person for a meal outside, and you can't eat much. The self-service of Amy has spicy crab, shrimp, shellfish, snail, fish, etc. I like steak and Bobo chicken very much.
Finally, I am glad that I chose Amy in Wanning and got to know Amy.
We don't like the cold business sense of Westin, especially the poor experience of Lingshui Westin, and we can't adapt to the mysterious form of Grand Hyatt Shenzhou Peninsula that you need to wait for the shuttle bus to go to the beach. In general, it is right to choose Amy.
If I come to Wanning again, I believe I will choose here again.

The only regret is that the weather was not very good these two days, but it was also sunscreened. The hotel's butler Venture was attentive and thoughtful throughout the whole process. On the last day, breakfast was upgraded to the horizon restaurant, which is the trea**ent of the villa area. Haha, I was very happy.

Service: Before check-in, Brother Takuya introduced the surrounding special features and made an appointment for the hotel's parent-child activities. As soon as I checked in, I participated in the bubble pool party. The service was great. The child was so happy that he immediately asked to stay again and refused to leave. I will choose this hotel when I come to Wanning in the future.

msg:The weekend was Children's Day, so I stayed in a hotel near my home, and let my child experience skateboarding and surfing to prepare for surfing at the beach. This time I chose the Garden Water Play Twin Room at Le Meridien Resort Hotel. The room was large and had its own swimming pool on the first floor. It was also very clean. We put the twin beds together to sleep, and noted non-smoking rooms, children's toiletries, etc. The front desk Venture called in advance to arrange it properly and pointed out the recreational facilities and routes. It was very considerate and I specially expressed my gratitude and praise. You can learn skateboarding and surfing from 2pm to 6pm. The child has a foundation in swimming and racing, so he quickly mastered the method. The first experience has an adaptation process. The family of three was very satisfied with the breakfast. We played in the swimming pool for a long time and rented underwater thrusters. It was very enjoyable. The hotel provided sand dredging tools for the children to play on the beach. There were also entertainment programs on Children's Day. My wife had a 90-minute Thai spa at the spa center and said it was very good and not inferior to the Thai specialty stores outside. You can also make points for Marriott members. In a word: I will come back next time!

When I arrived at the hotel, I found that there were various arrangements for parent-child activities and adult activities every day. There were many projects. The staff provided very good service, which was enough to show the hotel's intentions. The breakfast was also rich and tasted very good. Thanks to the chef team for providing a delicious breakfast. The children like the sea view swimming pool very much. There is a beach down the swimming pool, which is very convenient. The housekeeper venture patiently answered all my questions and sent some hotel-related information in advance to help us have a better time. Thank you very much. I will bring my children back if I have the opportunity. I have also recommended friends to come and play. If there is no conflict with work, I will come in late June.

If my son didn't want to play in the water, I really wouldn't recommend booking a water play room. The outdoor children's pool was nice, but it closed at 18:00 in the evening. The Amy Beach was nice and suitable for taking pictures.

When checking in, I upgraded from a water play room to a pool duplex villa. There was an event going on and it only cost 400 yuan more per night. The price-performance ratio was very high. It rained during the stay and the clothes were not dry. The hotel also provided laundry and drying services. Whether it was the lady who helped us check in, the lady who ate breakfast at Horizon, the cleaning lady, or the butler Venture, they were all very nice and considerate of the guests, especially Venture, who was willing to help with anything. When checking out, the child was sleeping, so I discussed with him to check out later, and he immediately helped us confirm that we could delay the check-out to 13:30. I was very satisfied with the hotel check-in experience at the first stop. I will stay there next time and continue to look for VentureüòÑ

The Horizon Restaurant has a special a**osphere. There are many parent-child activities arranged by the lagoon pool. There is also an outdoor surfing experience area. Unfortunately, the children were too young to go there. In addition, the room is very transparent and there is no smell. During the May Day holiday, two families went there and upgraded to a suite with a private swimming pool. We didn't change it because we wanted to see the sea view. The garden area is also well maintained, and the overall experience is better than the Westin next door.

There are not many breakfast styles, but they can basically meet the needs. The room layout is quite satisfactory. The only shortcoming is that there should be something on the TV at night. The insects make strange noises. There are fewer adult activities and some times are awkward, so I didn't make an appoin**ent. The hotel's travel photography is really good. I participated in two parent-child activities. The children were very happy to stay and were reluctant to leave. The hotel also took the initiative to contact and delayed the check-out.

msg:Hotel review 2

In one sentence: first-class environment, second-class facilities, third-class service.
Suggestion: Please avoid this hotel for family travel, it is a fake family hotel.
Details:
1. The environment is very good: the beach is very large, the hotel has its own beach, and there are many entertainment options by the sea, which is really good; the Horizon Restaurant is right by the sea, and you can enjoy the beautiful scenery while eating, which is pleasing to the eye.
2. The room facilities are very poor: First, there are very few sockets, only one socket in the water bar, and the rest are either close to the ground or behind the cabinet; second, the TV angle is poor, except for sitting on the bed, there is no angle to watch TV normally (Figure 1); third, the air conditioning temperature control cannot be adjusted at will, set to 18 degrees, the room temperature is 25 degrees, and the abnormal sound is very loud (Figure 2). At 11 o'clock in the evening, the maintenance came and said that the motor was broken and needed to be replaced. The air conditioning temperature monitored the air outlet and said it was 18 degrees, and then monitored the air outlet below the air conditioning and it was 24.4 degrees. It was told that the air conditioning temperature was fine and met the 18-degree setting. (After emphasizing that there was a problem with the temperature, the staff operated the panel and the temperature was locked at 21 degrees. It was still 21 degrees even when it was adjusted to 23 degrees); Third, the parent-child room is just an ordinary room with the sofa replaced with a bed, and then toys and tents were placed. Other facilities remained unchanged. There was an abstract painting facing the bed, which scared the child to tears at night. The child suddenly cried and shouted at night: ears, ears, there is an ear (Figure 3).
3. Poor hygiene: Before checking in, it was stated that the child's skin was sensitive and must be cleaned. As a result, when the quilt was opened at night, there was still a yellow mark on the bed sheet (Figure 4). When it was discovered, because the child was taking a bath, the housekeeper was told to change it in 30 minutes. As a result, after waiting for 50 minutes, the child was asleep and no one came to change it.
4. Poor service: First, before checking in, I asked the housekeeper to change the pillow and mattress to a harder one. Although he agreed, he didn‚Äôt change it at all. Second, because of air conditioning and hygiene reasons, the housekeeper proposed to change the room, but the solution was to change from the larger parent-child room to the smaller water-playing twin-bed room. Because the twin-bed room was not sleepable, I asked to change to the water-playing king-size bed room. The housekeeper said impatiently: The king-size bed room was gone, or change to another parent-child room (at that time, the water-playing king-size bed room could still be booked on Ctrip that day). Finally, I contacted Ctrip to solve the room change problem; and when changing the room, I asked the housekeeper again to make the pillow and mattress harder. In the end, the mattress was changed, but the pillow was not changed. 5. The restaurant is bad: First, there are few types of breakfast. This restaurant can make me stand there with my plate in hand, not knowing what to eat; second, because of the room problem on the first night, the breakfast was upgraded from ordinary breakfast to executive breakfast. In fact, it was just changed from the all-day restaurant to the Horizon Restaurant (a restaurant on the seaside), but the food did not change, and there were even fewer types of fruits and juices; third, the ingredients in the all-day restaurant were not fresh. We had lunch and dinner in the all-day restaurant on the 9th. That night, my child and I started to have diarrhea. During the sea ban, it is understandable that the restaurant uses frozen fish and shrimp, but frozen products must also be guaranteed to be fresh; fourth, the all-day restaurant has few types of buffet dinner and is out of stock. It closes at 9:30 pm, and the shrimp and clams are gone at 8:20. I took the initiative to ask the waiter for it, but he told me that the clams were gone and only gave me a few shrimps. This was after May Day. If May Day was good, the supply during the peak period would be unimaginable.
6. Poor children's facilities: Parent-child projects need to be booked, and you have to join the WeChat group. I went there at 3 pm, and no one was playing in all the projects. All the staff were idle, but they still asked me to make an appoin**ent. The only children's playground that can be played is basically climbing, which is very unfriendly to young children.
Finally, as the hotel with the highest score in Wanning and the first parent-child hotel, it has nothing but the environment. Only the cleaning staff in the whole hotel are smiling. From the lobby to the restaurant, they all look like creditors. I feel that I am not here to consume, but to pay off my debts. Moreover, the parent-child attribute is extremely weak. The parent-child room is basically an ordinary room with a simple modification. The children's playground is small in scale and poor in hygiene. It is still like this after the peak of May Day. It is hard to imagine what the service pressure will be like during the peak period. I advise everyone to choose a brand hotel, at least the hotel facilities and service standards are more standardized.
Finally, tell the hotel not to do the kind of "I am very sorry, please don't give a bad review, I will definitely provide good service next time" plain water-style public relations. If you are really sorry, why wait until next time, what did I do during my stay? What's more, think about it yourself, will there be a next time?

As a family hotel, the hotel has too few children's entertainment facilities in the swimming pool. There is only one small slide, and we didn't go there. Can you add more?
The hotel has too few breakfast options, and if you open until 11 o'clock, can you prepare more meals? If you arrive after 9 o'clock, just put the same food there to make up for it.
The advantages of the hotel are that the scenery is beautiful, suitable for taking pictures, the beach is also good, and the technology of family travel photography is good.
The hotel's gym environment is good, 24 hours

Thanks for the birthday cake and longevity noodles. My baby had a very happy 2nd birthday.
Stephen's service is very thoughtful and responsive. Great praise!

4. It is a parent-child hotel with many children's activities. My son is very happy one after another.
5. A suggestion: This pillow is hard to describe. I forgot. In fact, I can ask the housekeeper to change it, but I was too tired and forgot.

The family room we booked was very spacious, with a large bed and a small bed, which was very suitable for children who could already sleep independently. The front desk Venture called in advance and added WeChat for communication. We pushed some recommendations on surrounding attractions, shopping, and marine activities. After checking in, the dehumidifier was already working when we entered the room. It was pretty good. The various swimming pools in the hotel can fully meet the children's needs for playing in the water. The hotel breakfast was also good, with a relatively rich variety.

msg:The room rate for the May Day holiday was over 3,000, but there were few entertainment programs for guests staying overnight. There was an open-air barbecue and resident singers at the Westin next to it. The Emmy was deserted, and there was a stinky ditch next to it that went straight to the sea, which was very unsightly. I didn't take the free travel photo because of time. The breakfast was very Chinese. I couldn't get used to eating meaty things in the morning. It was not worth 228 per person. Renting a power bank was more expensive than outside. The parent-child activity group was actually mixed with strangers who added WeChat and sold projects. I asked the hotel and it said it was directly operated... Guests who were unfamiliar with the place could not tell the difference until the moment of consumption... But the service was really good, which was the only thing I recognized. Overall, the price-performance ratio was not high for the May Day holiday.

Stephen at the front desk responded to all requests after adding WeChat, and arranged everything for you, which is very considerate.

The hotel design and room distribution are basically the same as foreign island resorts, and the rooms are quiet. The overall design of the paintings upstairs in the hotel has a strong sense of art.

The space in the breakfast room is not very large, and several locations are marked with the words "If You Are the One" filming location, but everyone is still attracted by the exquisite food itself. The food you like is just like the picture, the ice cream is delicious, and the latte machine is also very good. Drink it with a silky texture and rich flavor and make it into an affogato hahaha! The desserts are beautiful and delicious. The Flaming Mango is not a jelly mousse, but a spicy and salty dish. By adding milk, the accident caused by the slight spiciness is gradually resolved haha. Eggs Benedict is a combination of mackerel and green beans. The process of making an egg roll looks so mysterious. Someone else ordered it and didn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs inside. It looks very tempting!

The gym is extremely spacious, with a large area and advanced equipment. Unfortunately, it was a little hot in the room. I brought an ice-cold soda and it was no match. I exercised and then retreated. I kept the photos. I really like the hardware! In the evening, there are restaurant lights flashing on the beach, there is a band with several people, and there are not many people taking pictures. During the day, there are a few groups of family traveling and shooting activities. The beach with the iconic Le M√©ridien words is indeed very photogenic.

I looked for him about a dozen times a day, and I was a little embarrassed. He could handle all the problems for me quickly and professionally.

msg:I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya before. This time, I found such a treasure family hotel because I arranged a trip around the island:
1. First of all, in terms of environment, the overall holiday feeling of the hotel is very strong. You can almost enter the holiday a**osphere when you walk into the open lobby where you can see the swimming pool and the sea at a glance. The overall architectural and decorative style is Southeast Asian style. The room is spacious and comfortable, but the sound insulation feels a little weak. If someone passes by and talks in the corridor, you can hear it clearly. Fortunately, because the floor is low and the rooms are scattered, the actual impact is relatively small.
2. Hotel staff: Every employee I met is very enthusiastic. Two people who need to be mentioned in particular are the housekeeper Venture. We added WeChat as soon as we checked in to Venture and introduced the hotel facilities and services in detail. Venture also responded very quickly to the problems during the stay. The other is the girl on duty at the naughty castle at night. I don‚Äôt know her name, but she is really the most enthusiastic and friendly staff member we have met in the naughty castle among so many parent-child hotels we have stayed in. She will actively interact with my child, encourage him to try when he is a little timid, and pay attention to the safety of children‚Äôs games. It is really impressive.
3. Dining: During our stay, we tried the Horizon Restaurant, the Korean Restaurant, and the Chinese Restaurant. They all had their own characteristics, and they were not acting like a five-star hotel. They were serious about catering. They all had cost-effective packages suitable for family dining, and the taste was also very good. The service staff of the Korean restaurant enthusiastically shared with us their package settings and suitable situations. Moreover, both the Horizon Restaurant and the Korean Restaurant have open-air dining locations, beautiful scenery, and a particularly cozy and vacation-like feel.
4. Parent-child aspects: First of all, the hotel's naughty castle is really novel and unique, and you will know it when you see it. The slippers, toiletries, wash stools, toilet seats, and small bathrobes for children are also prepared in the room in advance. The parent-child room we booked also has small tents, small toys, and sand play tools in the room.
In short, this was a very pleasant and unfinished accommodation experience. The only regret is that the children did not play enough. When we wanted to stay in the water room with a small swimming pool for another day, the hotel was full. Let's leave it for the next experience~

The service attitude is also very good. It is very kind and will say hello when meeting. He is also very proactive and will actively evaluate your needs and provide services. The parent-child room also has baby toys and tents. For those with babies, the constant-temperature swimming pool is very important, but the water temperature does not rise so fast, so it is recommended to swim in the afternoon. There are many kinds of breakfast, and there are other restaurants in the hotel. Many delicious food are also near the hotel. There are different arrangements for adults or in-person activities every day, as well as travel photography, which must be reserved one day in advance. It is very suitable for all types of people to go on vacation!
Thanks to Zard at the front desk, who contacted us in advance to make arrangements and also gave us a special birthday surprise.

msg:These few days in Wanning coincided with particularly good weather, and the sky and sea were blue and beautiful. We who have lived on the seaside of Qingdao since we were young will still be intoxicated by this charming southern scenery. Finally, I stayed at Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay on my friend‚Äôs advice, which was also the biggest gain from this journey. Sitting on the most beautiful coastline and beach in Shimei Bay, as well as my favorite coconut grove, it looks like a landscape painting from any angle. When you get off the car at the hotel entrance, you can see the seaside at a glance. The swimming pool is connected with the sea and the sky. Even though it has been open for more than ten years, we still feel the quality of an old resort hotel. This time, I would like to express my special thanks to Stephen at the front desk of the hotel. He contacted me before I even set out. He carefully introduced the local features and the hotel‚Äôs facilities, parent-child and entertainment services, and he also responded to my questions with great patience. During the past few days at Amy, Stephen responded to my questions at any time like a butler and helped with contacts, which saved us worry and effort. He is one of the important reasons why I will come back to Le M√©ridien again. Thank you Stephen for all the wonderful experiences you have brought to this journey. The hotel provides a variety of parent-child activities. My daughter had a great time. There are particularly attentive and patient staff who are responsible for leading the children's activities. Parents can truly achieve a "baby-dumping" vacation, and the children also enjoy it. The travel photography provided by the hotel is also a surprise, because the photos taken by the photographer are so beautiful, I just took them all. Although I paid, the price is reasonable, and it is very cost-effective for the entire trip. Travel is not only about experiences but also beautiful photos. All the marine sports you want to experience can be reserved at the Huanhai Marine Sports in the hotel lobby. My daughter had her first paragliding experience in her life when she was five years old, and she was very excited. We must believe that in this era of extremely developed and transparent information, Le M√©ridien is still one of the best hotels in Wanning and has its value. Wanning is such a slow-paced place suitable for showing off, and it is the best choice for family travel. Because we want to come to Wanning every winter, we went to the Westin next door, which is right next to Le M√©ridien, but the seaside scenery is single. Le Meridien has a particularly great seaside view, not only the beach, but also streams, coconut trees and Mountain scenery is not just a single beach. I also went to the Grand Hyatt on the Shenzhou Peninsula. The Grand Hyatt is very new, but it doesn‚Äôt have its own beach, which is a fatal flaw. Moreover, the Shenzhou Peninsula has too many people and is too lively, so it is more suitable for young people without children. The tone of Shimei Bay is more in line with our expectations of coming to Wanning, a leisurely, comfortable and fun family trip. At the moment we live in the bustling Atlantis and I‚Äôm already looking forward to next winter‚Äôs trip to Le M√©ridien.

msg:It's really good. Stayed at Le Meridien for three nights and had a great experience. In fact, the experience of staying in a hotel comes not only from the hotel's various facilities, but also from the hotel's management philosophy and personnel services. The hotel employees would take the initiative to say hello to us when they saw us, and they would also say hello to the baby. One time when I went to the swimming pool to find my eldest son, he was not in the pool. I was calling to ask the father of the child, and the staff at the swimming pool told me that he might have gone back to the room. I just saw a girl here calling her watch. It‚Äôs all about paying attention to your guests‚Äô needs. The meals are also great. There are really many activities, and they are all free. They are not the kind of activities that pass by in a flash, but they are quite worth experiencing. Such as paddle boarding, kayaking, and many free adult activities. There is a fee for surfing, but I compared the prices in our city and it is cheaper than the city where we are üòÇ
There is another detail. After staying at Le Meridien for three nights, we changed to another hotel experience, which was also five-star. As a result, the hotel staff broke the lever of our suitcase on the first day. Samsonite's suitcase is not that kind. Very poor quality. The first time my suitcase was damaged in a hotel. So it‚Äôs often necessary to compare.

My first instinct about the sea was quite shocking! Unfortunately, after five days here, it rained four days... Amy's Chinese restaurant is good. The afternoon tea at 18 degrees north latitude is average, but the a**osphere is different. After all, facing the sea, my stomach is warm and my face is happy! Amy's Beiye is very good. Every day, he will broadcast the next day's activities in the group and share the wonderful moments of the children's activities on the same day. Unfortunately, it is not suitable for young babies to participate. Younger babies are still more suitable to play in water and sand in Sanya. If I still have the chance to come to Wanning, I will still choose Amy!

The hotel in Wanning is much better than the Westin in my opinion. The Sheraton on the Shenzhou Peninsula is relatively old, so the Le M√©ridien is the most cost-effective. It is very suitable for parents and children. There are simply too many projects and activities for children to play and it is very rich. At the hotel concierge, the surfing industry is particularly good. The coach Adai is very attentive and takes the children to learn and practice surfing one-on-oneüèÑ.

After check-in, he was very considerate in every aspect and the service was very satisfactory. Regarding the hotel, the hotel is in Shimei Bay. The nearest high-speed rail station is Shenzhou Station. Shimei Bay does not feel as lively as the Shenzhou Peninsula. If you want to get out of the hotel, you have to take a taxi or rent a car. The hotel's beach is fine and clean, and is very suitable for children to dig in the sand. They can dig for several days. Children's favorite activity is to catch sand crabs. They catch them on the second day and release them on the fourth day. What was a bit regretful was the weather. It was very cold when I landed in Wanning, so I had to wear a down jacket and didn‚Äôt put on a strappy skirt until the third day. In terms of catering, we had breakfast at the all-day dining restaurant, and they helped us pack bread for the children for afternoon tea. The all-day dining restaurant had a small hotpot for dinner. There were not many varieties, but I thought the lamb chops were delicious. Dinner at the Horizon Restaurant requires a reservation. We chose to have lunch. The cod burger was delicious. We also had breakfast at the Horizon Restaurant. It was very rich and is an upgrade from the all-day restaurant. The last thing that needs to be improved is that the bed fence in the hotel is not good and cannot function as a fence. It was useless in the end. Overall, I am very satisfied with my four-day stay at Le Meridien.

I originally thought it was expensive and wanted to stay in a B&B, but I went to check it out and found that it was indeed far away from the scenic spots. The transportation here is not very convenient. You have to take a taxi to go everywhere, and there are traffic jams during peak hours. Some reviews say that the B&B is affected by betel nut. The child felt very uncomfortable when bitten. The window of this hotel was left open all night and he didn‚Äôt see a single mosquito.

The highest-rated hotel in Shimei Bay, the hotel lobby service staff "Yang Kun" is very enthusiastic and responsible, and the experience is very good.

The hotel's internal supporting facilities are fairly complete and there are plenty of parent-child activities, so reservations are required. (Today I picked a coconut by myself with a long pole, it was not easy [laughing through tears])

There are a total of 4 restaurants in the hotel. We tried the "Horizon Restaurant, Korean Food, and All-Day Buffet". The environment and taste are quite satisfactory, and the price is really expensive [face covering]

The room upgraded us to a "parent-child splash room". There is a square paddling pool outside the door. The water temperature is constant. However, the temperature is low today and swimming is still a bit cold. (Thinking it would be better if it was a hot spring [witty])

The bedding is still very comfortable, and the fountain shower in the bathroom is really refreshing! The room was clean and comfortable. good!

msg:This time I stayed at Le M√©ridien Wanning for four nights. Stephen took care of me very attentively throughout the entire stay. If you had any requests, you could tell him and they would be sorted out quickly. The hotel is not new, but the service response is very timely. There are plenty of activities for children every day. The waiters are very friendly and will take the initiative to say hello when they see it. The only thing that was lacking was the breakfast. There were so many people that you had to queue up and the seats were crowded. The variety of food was relatively small for a family hotel, and the taste was very ordinary. There are many entertainment options on the beach, and it is a good place for surfing. Will come again!

msg:We stayed in a premium parent-child room for 3 nights from 2/17 to 2/20. First of all, when we checked in that day, it was almost 16:00 when we arrived. They said there was a bad room type (already sorted) and a good room type ( It hasn't been cleaned yet), I asked which one I wanted, and if I wanted a good one, I had to wait another hour. Because I wanted to stay for three nights and wanted a better room type, but I had no choice but to wait until almost 17:00 to check in. Secondly, there was no hot water for showering on the second night. The maintenance guy came to repair it and said that the valve might be broken and they had to wait until the morning to fix it. So my mother didn‚Äôt take a shower that night. Another thing was that one night she ate at the Korean restaurant in the hotel. The waiter who gave us a side dish with peanuts was bad. He smelled it and said it was bad. He immediately gave us a cold beef dish instead. So overall, it was not a good stay. Anyway, I will definitely not stay here in Wanning in the future. This hotel is over. (There was also an episode where the hotel offered me Ctrip to cancel the order and give me a discount of more than 700 yuan, but I found it too troublesome and did not do it. Mainly, I also wanted to give a true review of this hotel).

msg:The overall hotel is very good. I recommend everyone to stay here with their children. Thank you Zard for the arrangement. From the introduction before check-in to the reservations for the restaurant and room cleaning during the process, they were all very considerate.

Detailed evaluation:
1. Style: A resort that retains natural ecology. It is very similar to the Four Seasons Hotel Seychelles where I stayed before. You can see squirrels, giant snails and other small animals in the park. The children were very happy.
2. Number of guests and room type: 3 adults and one baby. We paid to change to a constant-temperature swimming pool villa. The room is very suitable for us with small children. We can take our children to swim in the yard at any time. The swimming pool is very shallow, so there is no need to worry about safety issues.
3. Rich activities: There are two different activities for adults and children, which are particularly rich, including fishing, kayaking, coconut picking, and vegetable growing. There are also fireworks and outdoor movies at night. There are tennis courts and surfing areas for adults.
4. Excellent service: The front desk handled the service very quickly, and the staff I encountered were also very nice.
5. Catering: The overall optional content is a bit limited, and there are not many infant and young child complementary food catering. However, the overall service is excellent.
Korean Restaurant: The dining location of Geyou in If You Are the One. There are open-air and indoor ones. The open-air scenery is good, and the regular meals are OK.
Chinese restaurant: I only ordered food for my children, not too many choices
Horizon Restaurant: The scenery is good, with a sea view, but it‚Äôs too sunny. The service is great, there are too few meals to choose from, and I prefer afternoon tea.
Breakfast room: There are a little few breakfast varieties.
Ordering food online to the room: delivery is a bit slow, but otherwise it's fine.
6. Surroundings: Le Meridien is your own beach, so the environment is good and there are relatively few people. I went to other areas including the Shenzhou Peninsula and there were a bit too many people.

msg:I took my children on a trip a week before the Spring Festival holiday. I was worried that there would be too many people in Sanya, so I chose Le M√©ridien Wanning Shimei Bay Resort. It turned out to be a wise choice. The day before the trip, the housekeeper Stephen took the initiative to contact me and add me on WeChat, introduced the hotel environment and rich adult and parent-child activities, and guided me to join the WeChat group for reservation activities. My questions about travel preparations, clothing and shopping around the hotel were also patiently answered.
After arriving at the hotel, not to mention the natural scenery and architectural facilities of the hotel, all the staff were very warm and courteous. The hotel occupies a large area and the buildings are well-proportioned. It was difficult to find the direction at first. If I simply asked for directions, the staff would put down what they were doing and take me to the destination. They would not stop until the sign of the place I was looking for appeared within sight. Say goodbye politely.
Because the hotel was almost full, I was worried about queuing for breakfast and recreational activities, but unexpectedly found that queuing was rare. There is no need to queue for the buffet breakfast before 8:30. The only time I passed by at 9 o'clock a few times was that there were only about five or six customers in line (because the children have online classes at 8 a.m., so breakfast is at 8 o'clock every day) Finished eating before 9 o'clock, there will be more people after 9 o'clock). Although parent-child activities require reservations one day in advance, if you arrive at the scene temporarily, the staff will try their best to arrange participation. Unless you are unable to join in midway, the staff will provide the time for the next activity.
The heated swimming pool is outdoors, with unparalleled sea views of swaying coconut trees and rolling waves. What's even better is that the swimming pool provides free bath towels (it's really touching to have large dry bath towels at all times, especially when you are chilled by the sea breeze, put on a fresh one) I don‚Äôt know how happy I am to have bath towels that are still warm after being taken out of the dryer), free swimming rings, floating boards and back floats. Children will inevitably throw them away after using them. Staff are constantly cleaning up and maintaining the swimming pool environment. Orderly.
Overall, this stay was a great experience, and there were many little surprises and blessings that I didn‚Äôt have time to write down. The butler Stephen answered all questions and was very patient. I will come again next time I have the opportunity.

It was suitable for children to play here. The service was pretty good. Kris, the housekeeper, added my contact information in advance. Any questions? Timely resolution helped me upgrade one breakfast to two breakfasts
The only shortcoming of the hotel is that after staying in so many hotels, there is no welcome fruit in this hotel. There are no people on the beach and the hotel feels a bit deserted. There are not many takeaways. Wanning feels like a food desert, but the room is still pretty good. Compared with next door

The heated swimming pool is not cold when you swim at night, and it is very nice to take pictures. The most special thing is that the hotel also has a farm and a river, where you can take children canoeing and paddleboarding. The staff are all professional and qualified. Special thanks to Kris for the housekeeping service. He is always responsive to our needs and can solve various problems for us at any time. One day I was bitten by a mosquito and needed to relieve the itching, so I immediately brought Fengyoujing. The hotel's travel photography is also very convenient. You can choose your films after 20 minutes of shooting, and the results are good. If you want to choose a place to soak in the swimming pool and play in the sand, you can choose this place. If you are looking for luxury, don't choose it. This place is warm and not luxurious.

I learned that I brought a family with me and they upgraded us to a room type so that I could stay in the same room as my parents. During our stay, they cared about our needs every day, especially when my mother was injured while playing in the water sports. She immediately checked the inventory and prepared a wheelchair. The room service is also worth mentioning. When I saw the sun rising on the second day of my stay, I immediately contacted the club to go to Jiajing Island for snorkeling. So I hurriedly prepared my belongings and went out. When I came back, I found that the clothes in the room were neatly stored. Several restaurants in the hotel also taste very good. When the waiter at Horizon Restaurant saw that my mother had difficulty with her legs and feet, she immediately prepared a glass of hot milk for her. All in all, this stay was a great experience and I really felt like home. Next time I come to Wanning, I will choose Le Meridien Hotel

The butler Kris contacted us the day before to confirm, and the service was very considerate. The overall service attitude is very good, as long as you have any request, you will be answered. It's just a little regrettable that the sea view room can see very little sea view because the vegetation is too high. We upgraded to the courtyard room for free. The area is very large and the stay is very comfortable. The view from Horizon Restaurant is amazing! I will stay here again next time I visit Wanning!

First of all, the hotel has a beautiful environment, soft beach, clean and tidy garden, lush green plants, and spacious, clean and comfortable rooms. Mr. Wu, the housekeeper, took the initiative to contact me before I checked in. When he learned that I was bringing an elderly person in, he upgraded us to a room with a small courtyard on the first floor. He was very considerate and the service was warm and thoughtful. The breakfast at the hotel is also great! The restaurant has a beautiful view and delicious food! Will recommend friends to come here.

You can see the sea at a glance from the hotel lobby. Walking along the lobby, you will reach the seaside, which is very close. The connecting room is a mountain view room, and the hotel design has the feeling of a winding and deep path. The service in the hotel is super good. Every service staff I meet every day smiles and says hello politely. Especially the housekeeper Venture is very nice, considerate and responsive. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is really good, and the Wenchang chicken tastes great, but the location is a bit hard to find. A signboard would be helpful.

This time I also met the very conscientious butler Zard. He contacted me before checking in and tried his best to arrange it for me after knowing that I wanted to live closer to the lobby. During my stay, almost everything I asked for was accommodated. I originally booked to stay for two nights, but later due to a flight I had to extend my stay for another night, and he arranged it for me. Le Meridien's environment is very good, the scenery is first-class, and the caring butlers added a lot of wonderful memories to my solo journey.

The capsule coffee machine is my favorite as a coffee star, and the food in the restaurant is not uncomfortable for my northern stomach. There are all kinds of choices. While wandering around, I also discovered a small vegetable garden with various vegetables, which the security guard said would be supplied to the restaurant. It had a very pastoral feel. Not to mention the heated swimming pool and beach, they are super beautiful. The daily adult and children's programs are well arranged, making it really worry-free for families and children to stay here.

Good materials were used during the decoration, so although it is not a new hotel in the past two years, it is well maintained.
2. The geographical location is good. It is only ten minutes away from Xinglong, Riyue Bay and Shenzhou Peninsula. Watching the sunrise is also great. It is not suitable for sunset in winter, as the sunset location is a bit off.
3. There are many activities in the hotel. Even if you don‚Äôt want to go out, you can still have fun in the hotel for a day. There are not only children‚Äôs activities, but also adult activities (yoga, volleyball, kayaking, paddleboarding, surfing)~~

A good friend who has a room here recommended the Le Meridien Resort in Shimei Bay as good. I booked it on Ctrip for three days, and the environmental sanitation service software and hardware are indeed worthy of the name. The relatively private hotel beach and the beautiful beach restaurant on the horizon make people miss me; whether it is the handsome guy at the lobby door helping with luggage, or the handsome butler Venture taking care of the trip through WeChat, They were very considerate in helping me find the Sansha travel route, so please give it a thumbs up! I will definitely choose Amy's next time!

msg:Let‚Äôs talk about the advantages first: the front desk, cleaning aunt‚Äôs service, room hygiene, hotel maintenance, and seaside environment are all very good. The room layout is also good and relatively easy to use. The Horizon Restaurant feels good too, but it‚Äôs a pity that I don‚Äôt have time to experience it. I read a review before that said it was old. In fact, except for the lack of functionality, it is generally OK.
Disadvantages: 1. The housekeeper service is perfunctory and only contacted via WeChat on the first and last days. When asked on the first day if there were any requirements, I said to be closer to the front desk. In the end, the one given was the back room. The baby always needs to be held by the mother, which is very It takes a lot of effort and is too unfriendly. We contacted the front desk on our own during the rest of the process, and we never met anyone. On the last day, we asked for 5-star reviews, and even said that we could upgrade our room next time we come to see him. Sincerity. 2. There are too few swimming pools, and I saw a lot of floating objects, such as leaves and insect corpses floating on the pool surface in the morning and noon. I hope it can be improved. 3. The breakfast is quite satisfactory. There is really nothing around and it is far away from anywhere. It is suitable for those who like quiet and lively. Choose carefully. 4. In the end, if the hotel directly asks for a positive review if you are satisfied, if you have any objections, please do not comment. The previous good impression has been lost.

I am very grateful to Stephen for helping to arrange the children's room. The room is large, clean and has toys. The child likes it very much. Breakfast is served until 11 o'clock, so children can eat even if they get up late. It is very close to the beach and there are not many people. The heated swimming pool has a children's pool, which is great. The hotel also has many parent-child activities. Although I only participated in the foam party, it felt great and the children had a great time. You can have a colorful life without leaving the hotel. It is very friendly for families with children. I will try other activities next time. The children said this was the best hotel and didn't want to leave. The service staff were very friendly and made us feel at home. We will choose here again next time we come to Wanning.

Brother Stephen provided attentive service throughout the entire stay. He sent us a lot of precautions before check-in and took the initiative to help us upgrade our family room. The parent-child room is large, with a sofa bed for children to sleep on and a bathtub for water play.
The hotel's own children's club has a large space and sufficient staff. Our children played for three days a day. The water in the constant-temperature swimming pool under the lobby is very clean, and the security guards are also keeping a close eye on it. The children can play alone with peace of mind.
The travel photography provided by the hotel turned out to be very effective and produced great results. Many photos 10/one are not expensive, almost everyone buys negatives
The hotel also arranges various activities for adults and children. You won‚Äôt be bored all day just by playing in the hotel.
All in all, it is a very suitable hotel for sleeping. I will stay there again if I have the chance. It is worth coming back.

There are many parent-child activities in the hotel, including kite flying, kayaking, etc. The children were very happy and did not need to find another place to play. There are free swimming rings and floats for swimming, and free simple sand digging tools for sand digging, which is so worry-free. There are also many paid items on the beach, including beach buggies, which are cheaper than the Westin next door. I would like to thank the staff member Zard again. I have never met him but he is always able to answer my questions quickly^^

Before the trip, I had been debating between Le M√©ridien and Westin. Then I came across a special room and decisively chose Le M√©ridien. I was not disappointed. On the contrary, I was satisfied everywhere Surprisingly, no matter whether it is room hygiene, hotel facilities or staff service, there is nothing to fault. There are bath towels and mineral water everywhere in the hotel for easy use. Auntie will clean the room every day, and she is very friendly. I saw the children there I sleep lightly, and when I go out, I can see the beach and sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãShimei Bay. It is probably the off-season, and there are not many people. I like this quiet feeling very much. The front desk customer service Zard added WeChat in advance and took good care of all aspects. He also gave me a free day Breakfast, yes, breakfast is a little different every day. Whether it is Chinese food or bread, they are both delicious. I have stayed in many hotels, and few breakfast breads are so delicious. Although I met some unqualified neighbors on the last night and was noisy, the hotel handled it very well and kept apologizing. Although it had nothing to do with them, in short, I highly recommend staying at Le M√©ridien with your children. It is a very unique hotel. of hotels
Use of beach toys and children's swimming rings: there are many varieties, feel free to borrow them

I chose Le Meridien for this trip to Wanning. Both the elderly and children were very happy during the trip. The hotel's facilities are relatively new, and the children's supplies are also very well prepared. Every service staff in the hotel was enthusiastic and thoughtful, and any problems we encountered along the way were solved promptly and properly. There are many activities for children and adults, which are very suitable for young babies. The butler service is also very considerate. My butler Zard provided us with attentive service throughout the whole process. He would communicate hotel information and meal tips in advance via WeChat. When we asked for help in emergencies, he would respond promptly and praise us by name. The shade on the beach is really limited. I hope the shade plants will be more dense in the future.

Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs features:

There are three parent-child activities at Bei Ye Planet in the morning and afternoon. You can play all at once after checking in. It is very unique.

If parents want to go overseas, the hotel also offers unique half-day or full-day care!
2. Hotel facilities
There are three places to eat, Chinese restaurant, Western restaurant and Horizon Western restaurant. I highly recommend Horizon, an invincible dining environment on the beach!
There are two swimming pools, the outdoor swimming pool and children's swimming pool under the lobby (the water temperature will be better when the sun is shining!), and the reef and sand swimming pool (more private, the shallow pool is more suitable for children to play, and it is also a parent-child bubble activity venue)!
Extra large private beach where you can watch the sunrise, great! The sand is fine! The waves are slow! Opposite is Kajing Island! Suitable for taking photos, definitely great for filming!
The rooms are of five-star standard, so you can stay with peace of mind!
Greenery, palace-level, beautiful scenery wherever you take a photo!
3. Details
The room is equipped with Crocs according to the number of guests. Considering that the air at the seaside is relatively humid, an air purifier is also arranged in the room, which can automatically adjust according to the humidity! Free minibar in the room on the first day of stay!
Breakfast time is from 7 to 11 o'clock. Whether you get up early or stay in bed late, there will be a sumptuous breakfast waiting for you! The hotel restaurant also provides takeaway service, delivered directly to the room.
Surrounding activities can be booked through the hotel, and the prices will be discounted to varying degrees!

msg:In the past few years, when traveling domestically and abroad, I have basically stayed in hotels with first-line sea views. This time I stayed at Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay. I stayed at Le M√©ridien in Mauritius a few years ago and had a very good impression, so I chose Le M√©ridien for this trip to Hainan. First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Stephen, the hotel housekeeper, who is very considerate and considerate. The needs of the guests, no matter how big or small, are resolved in a timely manner. He has contacted me before check-in and gave me a detailed introduction to the hotel's facilities and activities. , give better play suggestions. Secondly, I would like to thank all the staff of the hotel room depar**ent. I have stayed in so many famous hotels. They are the most serious and responsible for cleaning the rooms. Even the corridors of the hotel are constantly wiping to give guests the cleanest environment.
Among the many beaches in Wanning, Shimei Bay is relatively closed and private, and the scenery is more beautiful, especially in the afternoon when the sun slant to the west, the sun shines into the sea, shining sapphire blue luster, like tiffany crystal.
As a hotel brand popular among family guests and young people, Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay also attracts many young people who take their children on vacation and like to take photos.
Various activities will be informed to guests in the WeChat group every day. Although the hotel has a large children's swimming pool, many parents and children with children prefer to choose a room with a swimming pool, and the children can directly play in the swimming pool exclusive to their room.
Many guests traveling with their families choose more private villa rooms. Quiet, private and undisturbed. Guests in the villa area can have breakfast at the Horizon Restaurant, which is quieter than the Chinese restaurant where other guests dine, and the dishes are more delicate. You can enjoy the scenery while dining through the floor-to-ceiling windows.
This time I stayed in a double room with a sea view. Looking from the balcony, I can see layers of coconut groves, the sea looming, waves beating on the beach, and the coconut groves rustling in the wind.
Staying at Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay, Horizon Seaview Restaurant is well worth a try. Sitting on the beach in the evening, admiring the sunset and enjoying delicious food, it is extremely comfortable. The three-dimensional LOGO in front of the restaurant is an essential place to take photos and check in.

Many people say that the Le Meridien hotel with children has more parent-child programs, while the Westin without children is more luxurious. I went to Westin in the spring, and this time I chose Le M√©ridien to try it out. As expected, the hotel lobby, view, room facilities, and restaurants did not disappoint. The stay and food were all comfortableüëç
I especially like the Chinese restaurant on the third floor of Le M√©ridien. The food and scenery are both to my liking. We went to the Horizon Restaurant for breakfast. The scenery was unparalleled. This time, I would like to especially praise Le Meridien's service, especially the butler Venture. He often cared about my needs during my stay and often gave me solutions that were beyond my satisfaction. Also, at Le M√©ridien, we asked the cleaning staff to put a few more bottles of mineral water in our room to make tea. When we came back, they silently put a box of mineral water for us. For this reason, we will stay at Le M√©ridien next time. ! ! !

Few tourists, great environment, great service! Perfect for a vacation, away from the city and away from work. Lying in the hotel from morning to night is worth the price. When you get tired of lying down, the hotel also has various activities for you to play. There are also many parent-child projects, and you can even have one-day care. Next time you bring your kids~

Especially Venture who contacted us in advance and arranged many things in advance and even arranged the honeymoon trip. Thank you very much! The scenery of the hotel is so beautiful. I feel like I can hang out all day in the hotel. There is a beautiful beach.

msg:When I arrived at Le M√©ridien, the hotel's appearance already gave me a strong island resort feel. When I arrived at the lobby, I could see the blue sea, but the swimming pool was a bit small. The room is spacious and bright, and the decoration style is mainly Southeast Asian. I thought I was in Vietnam! Although the balcony view does not face the sea, it is quiet, comfortable and refreshing. The sanitary environment is good. It would be better if the details were more considerate. The bed quality is very skin-friendly. The mattress and pillows could be a little firmer. You can add a girl's quick-release elastic band to the cleaning supplies, hahaha ~ The hotel's breakfast buffet is OK, with a rich variety of food, especially suitable for my Western stomach, and the hot milk is particularly delicious. As for paying extra to eat at Horizon Restaurant, I personally don't think it's necessary. The overall food there is a little higher quality, but the variety is not as wide as that of a Western restaurant. It's still ok for a sense of a**osphere. There are no high-end ingredients in the all-inclusive buffet dinner, but there are still many types. The seafood is quite fresh (except fruits). We mainly ate hot pot. The lighting in the public areas of the hotel is warm at night. After dinner, it is very romantic to go for a walk on the beach, stepping on the fine sand and enjoying the sea breeze. The front desk and lobby staff are relatively indifferent, but other staff are quite polite. In particular, our little butler Venture has been helping us, thank you! If you want a quiet vacation, staying at Le Meridien is a good experience.

It turned out to be the most satisfactory hotel I have stayed in in the past seven days. The housekeeper added WeChat in advance and pushed the check-in guide PDF, adult and The children's activity group allows guests who have not checked in to quickly learn and reserve activities for the check-in date. This is much better than when I visited Yalong Bay Tianyu and Haitang Bay Fairmont a few days ago. They cannot check in without getting the room card. Although the housekeeper intervened in advance when booking an event, he was not as attentive as Amy. What touched me most was that the day of check-in was my child‚Äôs fourth birthday. I communicated with the housekeeper Stephen on WeChat to see if he could help prepare a birthday cake. I thought It‚Äôs okay to pay a fee. What surprised me was that he said no problem as soon as he saw it, without any hesitation in his tone. Not to mention how happy the child was when he saw the cake and the prepared stuffed toys in the room. In the end, no fees were charged. There are many surprises like this during your stay... For example, the pool manager reminds you that the electric floating board you rented is due. The delay fee is high and inappropriateüòÇüòÇ, and let us Experience dining at the Horizon Restaurant, etc... Anyway, I really appreciate Le Meridien's service staff.

On the afternoon of the first day of check-in, the housekeeper Venture called me to ask about the estimated time to arrive at the hotel the next day and added him on WeChat. Venture‚Äôs services are started directly after adding WeChat. From check-in to various inquiries, Venture handled it very considerately and responded in a timely manner.

The hotel is large, but the seaside style experience is comprehensive.
Beaches, lawns, deck chairs, swimming pools, and restaurants are of various styles, and the family-friendly hotel can really take care of everyone from children to adults. There are different activities every day, from children to adults, really liberating everyone from big to small. Some plants are also thoughtfully labeled with their names, making them both educational and entertaining.
The room facilities are very complete and clean and tidy. The shower has plenty of water and easy temperature control.
I like the unobstructed view of the big beach. Find a dark place to sit on the coast at night and listen to the sound of the waves while watching the stars. This is the feeling of vacation.
The perspective of Horizon Restaurant is very beautiful. If you sit outside or by the window, you can see the hotel logo and Kajing Island superimposed in front of you when you turn your head. Breakfast in the morning or lunch in the evening, the same scenery has different feelings.
The most important thing is that the hotel's service is in place. The guy at the door who helps manage luggage, the lady at the front desk who assists with check-in, the cleaning lady who is responsible for hotel hygiene, and the housekeeper Venture, everyone makes people feel warm and friendly.
I was very satisfied with the whole check-in process. I was so satisfied that after walking on the beach every night, I would pull my mother and say: Let‚Äôs go! go home!
We will definitely see you again next time~

Stephen at the front desk of the hotel contacted us before our departure, introduced the hotel and activity strategy, told the elderly at home that his legs and feet were inconvenient, and arranged a room close to the lobby. During the period, he also asked about service needs many times. The parent-child room is large , The sun can dry clothes, the bathroom has bathtubs and showers, and the long ***** has a large area. The room service is thoughtful, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant and the horizon restaurant are delicious, and the sea view is good. All in all a very satisfying trip. The hotel's free travel photography buddy and reservation lady have a good attitude and meet our family's shooting needs. The shooting is very good. There are supermarkets around, which is convenient. Will come again next time. I recommend it to my girlfriends, thank you!

The hotel has a lot of activities, including fishing, yoga, kites, bonfire parties, etc. There are also a lot of children's activities, and there is also a special children's playground, where parents can free their hands~
The room we stayed in was quite big and comfortable, and the hygiene was very good. The cleaning and care were done by Marlin dogs, and the quality was top-notch. The breakfast was also good, with everything you need.
The photos were all taken in the hotel with my own camera. The sea view, beach, swimming pool, coconut grove, and Horizon Restaurant are all very easy to take~
Maya, who served us this time, was very good. She responded in a timely manner and responded to all our requests. It was so much more convenient to have her during the entire trip! When I finally left, I found that I had lost a pair of sunglasses at the airport. I sent Maya a WeChat message and immediately found arrangements to send them back~

After staying for three days, I was attracted by the beautiful scenery, delicious food and good service, especially eating at the Horizon Restaurant. The restaurant is right on the seaside. The food is very good, but You have to order in advance to sit in the view seats and eat while watching the scenery. You can take a lot of beautiful photos. It is so comfortable that you really don‚Äôt want to leave. Parents and children are very satisfied. Thank you to the butler Venture for providing many convenient services. It is very troublesome to run around with children. The charging pile is at the door of the electric car we drive, which is much more convenient than many hotels.

msg:I came to Wanning for a self-driving trip and stayed at Le Meridien. The experience was very good ~ I stayed for two nights. On the first day I arrived in Wanning, because the check-in time of Le Meridien was at 3 pm, I had to wait for a long time. The housekeeper Zard arranged for an upgrade to a sea view room. I really liked the view and the room was very comfortable. It is worth mentioning that the hotel has a hole-in-the-wall. The shoes are basically comfortable to wear when we go out. The next day, the housekeeper unexpectedly said that we could try the one-bedroom villa again! We moved again haha, great! There is also a small swimming pool ~ but to be honest, if you are a couple, a sea view room is more suitable. The facilities are updated and very convenient. If a family brings the elderly and children, the one-bedroom villa is very good! There are people living both upstairs and downstairs, no problem for a family of five (it‚Äôs just too troublesome to climb the stairs for us lazy people, haha)
Another thing to note is that the (mobile) network signal in Wanning is very poor, so you have to rely on the hotel's wifi...and the hotel swimming pool seems to close early (6 o'clock?). The surfing hours are also limited. It's a pity that I didn't catch it.
Small tip: The breakfast buffet has coconut milk, and there are toppings on the side. You can make your own refreshing tonic and it‚Äôs delicious! Recommended to try ~
It was a great time ~ I‚Äôll come again next time!

The hotel is relatively small, and the floors are not high. The sea view room and the garden room are two types of units facing each other. The beach and the Westin share two neighbors

        Let me talk about the advantages of the hotel: Although it is close to the sea, the hotel does not have any trendy taste, which is very good; the buffet hot pot at night is good, the dishes are not many but the ingredients are quite fresh, and there are resident singers; there is a private beach; there are many activities, which is very suitable for children Children; the service attitude of the front desk staff is good and enthusiastic; there is a floor-to-ceiling shrink drying rack in the room, which is convenient for drying clothes; the bathroom is equipped with children's care kits and children's slippers, which are very attentive.
        Disadvantages: The hotel lobby for check-in is open, with only three or four counters, which feels worthless and stuffy; the breakfast is too ordinary, without the feeling of a vacation; the balcony of the room is unsanitary; the gate entrance is left and right It's a store and real estate sales point, my wife can't understand it!

The color of the vines and the coconut trees and palms outside the window The combination has a very holiday feel.
Services:
First of all, I would like to thank Venture for its service. Before the check-in, he contacted us, added WeChat, and sent all Le M√©ridien's services and activities in advance. If there are any questions during the stay, he will reply and help very quickly.
All the staff I met during the few days at Le M√©ridien will take the initiative to smile and say hello. The doormen who enter and leave the hotel are also very active and enthusiastic. The food delivery service and room cleaning are very good. I really like the fact that there will be a lot of drinking water I drink a lot of water hhh. The hot towels provided by the pool are also very considerate, and the lifeguards will also change their own small tables according to the location of the guests. There are really many small details that are satisfying.
I will stay at Le Meridien next time I come to Wanning.

We checked in at 3 pm, and the room cleaning took some time. We waited a little longer. When we arrived, the room was very large and spacious. Stephen also specially gave me a mountain view room facing the sun, where I could see the sea. The sea breeze was cool, unlike the hot and sticky sea breeze in Sanya Bay. The hotel had a complete breakfast every day. The hotel has a lot of entertainment facilities and entertainment programs inside. The children had a lot of fun and took photos. The gym is my favorite. I would like to remind everyone that Aimee's wifi is not very easy to use. It may be that the 4G is next to the mountain. It is perfect to bring a mobile wifi. At night, you can find everything you want to eat on the left when you leave the hotel. There is a sea-view platform one kilometer to the right. There are crabs in the reefs in the morning, and fireworks are set off by roadside stalls at night. The hotel staff greeted us warmly every day. Even if they hung up the "Do Not Disturb" button, they would still ask us if we wanted to take out the trash or clean the room. They were really considerate. So we should really understand the small flaws they made at work. It was hard work. I drove here. The hotel parking was free. I went east to the lighthouse of the Banshan Peninsula, the coconut grove in the eastern suburbs of Wenchang, and went up to the Qilou Old Street in Haikou. I felt that staying at Le Meridien for five days and four nights was a bit short. If I come to Sanya again, Le Meridien is the first choice. Finally, I want to say that some of the guests who stayed here were really ** of poor quality. They would never look for a trash can with things that could be thrown away. This is the only place that I felt **!

msg:It coincides with my mother‚Äôs birthday, and I have been to Sanya twice. I tried to check in Wanning, and wandered between Le Meridien and Shenzhou Peninsula Hotel. Considering the vacation of the three generations of grandparents, I chose Le Meridien. I am very grateful for this choice. Le M√©ridien's services and various supporting facilities have made everyone very satisfied. The food in the four restaurants, parent-child activities, water room, beach, and surfing, especially the butler Zard has given us homely care. In just five days, my daughter and mother are reluctant to part with it. Let's go, look forward to going again next time!

I stayed here for four days and answered every day in seconds. The guests are very satisfied and at ease. The hotel restaurant is also very good. The waiters They are all great. The price-performance ratio of the set meals at Horizon Restaurant is still very high. The three meals in the hotel are very good. I even called customer service for dinner and the food was delivered quickly and delicious. The scenic spots selected by the hotel are good Some places that are rare to take pictures, thank you Venture, if you come again in the future, you must stay at Le M√©ridien

Although the hotel is a bit old, the maintenance and service are quite good! This Wanning vacation has been entangled between Le M√©ridien and Westin for a long time... I finally chose to stay for 2 nights each. I feel good about staying in both. The modern style of Westin and the Southeast Asian style of Le M√©ridien are my personal preference. Emmy.
Special mention must be made of the thoughtful service of the butler Stephen! ! !
Call from the day before check-in, add wx one-on-one butler service, inform hotel activities in advance, inquire about check-in needs, and help solve early check-in. Any questions during check-in can be answered in time and solved in a timely manner. For someone like me who cares about service As far as people are concerned, it is really a very good job and I am very satisfied üëçMust like itüëçIt is also a plus point for the whole experience of this Emmy trip.
The photos are a bit rough! But Emmy's room is really big! Comfortable and spacious! The lobby is also very nice! The journey from the lobby to the beach is very good! I also want to mention the travel photography, the effect is very good! The internet celebrity pink beach of the Westin next door, Le Meridien can also go directly to the beach, which is very convenient.
Amy really loves her the most, and Wanning will only choose her again.

The decoration of the hotel is very textured, a bit like a holiday in Bali. The beach is also very spacious, compared to the Westin Hotel next door. The breakfast is also very rich, and you will definitely have your favorite choices.
The children's activities in the hotel are also very rich, and the hotel customer service will make reservations for parent-child activities by themselves, which is quite convenient. The customer service (butler) venture is very good. He has already contacted us to reserve a room for us before arriving at the hotel, and also provided detailed information on hotel activities.
The children had a lot of fun, tie-dye activities, mud activities, handmade bracelets, building Luban houses, etc., were full every day.
Next time you come to Wanning, it will be your first choice as a parent-child hotel.

msg:Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay is considered an internet celebrity hotel, and it's finally here this time. Because of a family of four, we booked a duplex pool villa. In terms of room size and layout alone, four people are very comfortable. There is a 2-meter bed and a 1.5-meter bed, and a sofa bed. but! The most incredible thing is: a villa with a room rate of nearly 6,000 a night does not have a bathtub! The wife was very surprised by this, but also very sorry. Although there is a swimming pool, it is not the same as the bathtub. And as far as the layout of the room is concerned, there is absolutely room for a bathtub! If you want to book this room type, you must pay special attention! I also hope that the hotel can take the bathtub into consideration in the next renovation.
The flaws do not conceal the advantages, and other aspects of the hotel are good. The depth of this hotel is not deep, so the road from the hotel gate to the beach is not very long, which is better than many hotels in Sanya. Our villa is also the closest to the beach among the same room type. The daily breakfast and afternoon tea are also served at the Horizon Restaurant by the sea, which should be one of the restaurants with the best scenery in Hainan. Because I lived in a villa, the housekeeper Zard contacted me via WeChat the day before check-in. When we arrived at the hotel, it was the peak of the check-in period. Zard had already arranged the room for us. We waited a while for check-in, and the check-in went smoothly. A waiter drove a battery car to the room. Because we booked a late flight, Zard also made an exception and delayed our check-out until 3 pm. It's really not easy at the peak of summer vacation.
There are not many varieties of breakfast at the Horizon Restaurant, but fortunately, there is no need to queue up, and the dishes are exquisite. The most important thing is that the scenery is charming, which is still very good. There are many activities in the hotel, such as fishing and picking coconut paddle boards, as long as you make an appoin**ent. The dinner buffet is also pretty good, with salmon, coconut chicken hot pot, and crayfish. It is the average level of this class of hotel.
The overall stay experience is okay. I also hope that the hotel can make a special note on the room type without a bathtub on the reservation page. After all, when you book a hotel of Le M√©ridien level, you generally don‚Äôt think that the room does not have a bathtub.

msg:The biggest feature of the hotel should be the parent-child of Beiye Planet. There are many parent-child activities, trusteeship services and activities suitable for adults. It is suitable for children to play and adults to be lazy~ But if you want to take your family for a quiet vacation, it is not the first choice. People are too It's too noisy, at least don't choose the summer peak season.
The horizon restaurant has a good view, and you can watch the sea while eating. The quality of breakfast meals is okay, but the variety is relatively small.
The room with a paddling pool is quite big, but this pool is more suitable for children. For older children, it is recommended to choose a pool room, or directly book an ordinary room type and go to the hotel pool. The family room is more reasonable. The small bed should be 1.35m. In addition, the toilet in the bathroom is not smart. For a five-star hotel that is not very old, it seems that it needs to be improved.
The service is pretty good. The housekeeper will contact you the day before. If you have any special needs, you will pay attention in advance and try to provide some convenient services.
However, during the stay, there was a disinfection and cleaning, and the smell was pungent (this is probably a coincidence, we are unlucky üòì), after the feedback, it disappeared, and the hotel also said that it would adjust.
In addition, when checking out, they even said that they could not find the payment record when I checked in, and asked me to show the payment record. Although the money must have been cleared up in the end, I couldn't find the records after checking several times, and the impression was too bad. This is what I am most dissatisfied with.

The online celebrity horizon restaurant is also very good. I hope to stay again next time.

Stephen, the housekeeper, contacted me in advance before departure, and added a lot of thoughtful tips and strategies on WeChat, as well as the hotel's arrangements for children's activities and adult activities. I'm already looking forward to staying here before I leave!
Service: During the few days of my stay, I asked Stephen many times for various questions, and he responded very promptly, and my needs were quickly met. The service level and speed of the entire hotel are very online!
Environment: Although the hotel opened earlier, the current hardware facilities, environment, sanitation, etc. are all very good! The overall design of the hotel is very similar to the resort hotel in Bali I went to before, and the planning is scientific and reasonable.
The wall is really cracked, and the garden water room on the first floor is recommended! Whether it is a family trip or a couple friends, it is very suitable!

msg:Taking family and children on vacation, after repeated comparisons among Wanning hotels, we finally chose Le Meridien. Facts have proved that we made the right choice
Two days before the check-in, the front desk staff contacted us to add parent-child activities organized in various hotels before the Wechat Festival. After checking in, I am quite satisfied with the environment, facilities, service attitude and other aspects. The front desk staff Zard is also our "housekeeper". During the period, many small things troubled him, and he was always responsive and considerate. Children's toothbrush and slippers were added to the children, and children's breakfast coupons were also given. The Emmy‚Äôs special IPA craft brew in the refrigerator in the room is very good, but only the first round is free. After learning about it, Zard gave me free gifts several times. Thank you very much! The capsule coffee in the room is also very good. Drinking water is also given as much as you want.
Le M√©ridien's breakfast is also very good, with rich styles, especially fresh and delicious tropical fruits.
The surrounding environment is very beautiful, the beach is soft and flat, the sea water is clear and blue, and there is a small river flowing into the sea, which adds a lot of fun to the landscape, and the children had a great time.
What I don't understand is that the lagoon swimming pool in the hotel closes too early. I don't know why. It closes at 6 pm. There are many children playing in the water at night. The sea-view swimming pool closes late, but it is unremarkable, and there is no lagoon swimming pool that children love
Generally speaking, Emmy is really good. It may not look magnificent, but it can be seen that it has made solid efforts in terms of considerate service and various details. Next time I will choose Emmy!
Thanks again Zard!

In the end, I proved that I was right. The hotel is perfect. There are many activities for children, such as handicrafts, bubble baths, bonfire parties, fishing, etc. The three days and two nights are full of arrangements. The hotel is also very convenient to travel around. I went to Xinglong Town (seafood and fruits are super cheap), checked in the Shenzhou Peninsula, and went to Qiaohai Ranch. I had a lot of fun. Special thanks to Stephen at the front desk for taking care of us and getting a perfect holiday.

msg:Looking from the hotel lobby, you can see the blooming flowers in the courtyard and the blue sea behind it at a glance. The state of vacation is officially opened at this moment. A lot of tourists came to the hotel, and we had to wait for a while to check in. Zard of the hotel confirmed the itinerary with us the day before departure, and told us that the hotel usually checks in at 15:30, and will try to help us arrange check-in in advance. We arrived at the hotel at about 12.35, and got the room around 14:40. The room is on the second floor, a little far from the lobby. The balcony can't see the sea at all, but it is convenient to understand the flow of people in the pool. The bathroom door doesn't close well. On the day of check-in, it was said that Shimei Bay had a power outage. The power was cut off four times from midnight to morning. The TV would automatically turn on after each call, and the air conditioner had to be turned on again. It was annoying, especially in the middle of the night. The TV turned on automatically. I was really taken aback by the power outage. The next day, Zard helped us change to a room on the third floor. The balcony can see a little bit of the sea, and the location is much closer to the lobby, which is very convenient. It may be a reflection of the experience of the first day of check-in, and the Minibar in our new room was sent the next day. Let‚Äôs talk about the room again. We booked a parent-child room. The online area is estimated to be the balcony. I always feel that the indoor area is not as big as it is written on the Internet, and of course it is not small. There is a sofa bed in the parent-child room, which is about 1.45 meters by visual inspection. We have two children, which is very suitable for our needs. Both adults and children can sleep comfortably. The 1.35-meter double bed is quite crowded. If children's supplies and drinking water are not enough, you can also ask room service for them, and they will be delivered very quickly.Most of the staff are very enthusiastic, especially the staff in the room service area. They are responsive to their needs. I personally think that the processing speed can be compared with the five-star and above hotels in Sanya that we have stayed at. It can be ranked first. We remember the names of the room sanitation staff: Lin Yumei, Li Jing, when we returned to the room, we met them to tidy up, and they greeted us very politely, and they cleaned carefully. . For breakfast, there are the all-day dining restaurant near the lobby and the horizon restaurant in the villa. Both restaurants have more breakfast options, and the horizon restaurant has more food and more refined food. Located in the best location on the central axis of Jiajing Island, people who dine here can enjoy the beautiful scenery while enjoying the food. The all-day restaurant has a lot of people for breakfast, so you may have to queue up if you go late.Finally, let me talk about the reason for the recommendation. As an emerging tourist destination, its sea is enough for you to come and find out. If you have been to the beaches of the best resort hotels in Sanya and want to choose a place that you have not visited, you can consider Wanning. We think the color of the ocean here is more beautiful than anywhere in Sanya. Its blue is clear and bright, and it can still feel the natural state without being disturbed by too many people. Even though the sea was a little rough when we visited, it did not affect the dazzling light of the sea in the sun.
Ctrip will start with these, and the travel notes will slowly write more.

One day in advance, Emmy's front desk brother Zard contacted me and added WeChat. On the same day, he told me that he helped me upgrade the room type. There is a splash pool in the room. The child was very happy when he heard it, and he can play in the water anytime and anywhere. And he was responsive to my needs, and even asked me if I wanted to clean the room and if I wanted to book a restaurant for me. I stayed for 3 nights. I wanted to go to Wenchang on the last night, but I didn't stay enough, so I stayed for another night. Zard also helped me arrange everything. I don't need to go to the front desk, just talk to him directly, very considerate. The hotel has a Southeast Asian style, which I like. We rented a car, and we drove out to eat, and we also ate at the hotel, which were all good. Planet Beiye has activities throughout the day, three in the morning, three in the afternoon, and a puppet show at 8 pm throughout the seven months. Too many activities and not enough time. The hygienic environment of the hotel is good. The swimming pool is cleaned by professionals. The swimming pool is also full and clean, and sand dredging tools are also provided. The room is also very nice, you can see the pictures, we took pictures when we entered the room.

msg:The room is still very clean, and the room is cleaned in a timely manner, and I know very intimately that drinking water is very powerful in summer, and they are all delivered in a box. The environment, the first time you enter and see the lobby, then the "so-called infinity pool" is still very comfortable. However, the hotel may set up a villa area in order to make more money, so the whole hotel seems nondescript. Apart from the beach, the hotel seems to lack many places to play. The price of the "sea view room" facing the sea is increased, and the other side is the mountain, and the price can also be set as a "mountain view room". ****ing starts at 8 o'clock in the morning. I don't understand how a five-star hotel can make money for the sake of making money. Instead of improving detail service? In addition to the "infinity pool", there is also a coral pool, but it is strange that there is no toilet around the pool. After walking around, I found that there is actually a shower room, but there are no obvious signs nearby. Because of the check-in time, I went to the hotel's Korean restaurant for lunch after storing my luggage. I ordered Korean cold noodles, and it took 35 minutes to serve the food. I was speechless. Don't talk about restaurants in five-star hotels, even restaurants outside, right? As a result, the waiter said: There are few chefs! In your five-star hotel restaurant, it takes three quarters of an hour to make cold noodles? Find a reason, please use your brain! There are only so many varieties of buffet breakfast, the same every day. I don't know how the hotel thinks about it? Do you want guests to pay to upgrade the horizon, or do you think it is included in the price anyway, and guests still have to eat if they don‚Äôt eat? Then there are really too many things that need to be improved in terms of the meticulousness of the service. There is a pig's blood soup, and then I searched around and couldn't find a bowl for the soup. There was a problem with the coffee machine, and I reported it to the waiter, and I got the answer, but no one came to deal with it. In the place where flour is made and noodles are made, there seems to be a rather expensive minced beef, so it is controlled by internal personnel, and customers are not allowed to add it freely.
Forget it, there are too many places to complain, everyone is free to choose!

Ms. Wu Haiying at the front desk was very enthusiastic and introduced us to the park and food. She was very thoughtful and meticulous. I have stayed in Banyan Tree, The Westin in Mannings and the Jinmao Ritz-Carlton in Sanya have never encountered such a delicate front desk staff. The first impression is beyond expectations!

After Ms. Wu's introduction, Venture is a customer service member who added WeChat when we arrived at the hotel (I added WeChat before the trip) and has been paying attention to our trip throughout the whole journey. He is very good at suggesting and helping us to book restaurants in advance. I am very grateful and pay attention to our food. how?

The bar next to the front desk also sells coconut ü•• and ice cream. The Korean restaurant is average. , Hainan chicken rice is really suitable for children. It is very good and clean.

There is a reason why the hotel scored 4.9 in terms of environment. The hotel has carefully designed the details for children.

msg:On June 30 and July 1, 2023, I took my husband, 3-year-old baby, and in-laws to stay at Le M√©ridien Wanning Shimei Bay, which was strongly recommended by various platforms, and was really disappointed! Except for the rooms and restaurants indoors, the rest of the hotel is basically outdoors, and there is no place where it is cool during the day and you can walk your baby.
        
        1 The activity is unreasonable
        The time and content of activities for adults and children are unreasonable, which is very confusing! For adult activities, take the fun bowling I signed up for as an example. In a small room in the gym, two coconuts and two sets of bowling balls are placed. Maybe because it was too boring, many people left after watching it. Other adult projects include kite flying, fishing, coconut picking, etc. The weather in Hainan is really sunny during the day, and many of these projects are arranged in the extremely hot 10-11 and 15-16 o'clock. It is a pain to be in the sun and hot, and the indoor activities are basically the equipment in the gym, or some props in a cabin, so that people do not have the desire to participate.
        
        Children's activities are also quite pit! Free activities are hard to come by, and they are basically for older children. Baking and tie-dyeing, which my 3-year-old baby can participate in, cost extra, 498 yuan a time! Free events require WeChat groups to grab event quotas. Only 10 people can participate in each event. If you read the information late, you will have nothing to play! Moreover, the indoor children's playhouse in the hotel has not been built yet, and there are no unpowered game facilities.
        
        So if you don't grab these boring activities, and don't want to spend more money to participate in extra fees, you can only enjoy the shade indoors, or go out to find attractions! So why is it necessary to live in this room that costs 2,400 yuan a night? It does not include any meals. We ordered a group meal in the restaurant for more than 1,000, which is enough for 3 people.
	
        2 The hygiene of the hotel is not up to standard
        The only swimming pool in the hotel that can play has killed the children! Because the sanitation of the hotel swimming pool was not up to standard, the child was infected with germs after swimming, and got acute laryngitis at night. He went to the hospital for a blood test and went to the hospital for two days of nebulization. !
	
        I booked 2 rooms and stayed for 2 nights. The room cost was almost 10,000. Not only did I have nothing to play, but my child was also sick! Friends who have fantasies about Emmy, I will pull the ****s for you, especially if you want to take your baby there, it is really dissuading, it is better to find a sea view apartment to live comfortably!

msg:I think staying at Le M√©ridien in Wanning means that you have never been to Wanning. No matter in terms of facilities, environment, and hygienic conditions, you are very satisfied, especially the service is different from other high-end hotels.
Two days before my check-in, the butler Stephen contacted me on WeChat in advance, asking about the arrival time and any special needs that need to be arranged in advance. At first I thought it was just a process, but I didn't expect the service to exceed my expectations. It will indeed save a lot of worry if your baby stays in Le M√©ridien, I strongly recommend Le M√©ridien!
There are many parent-child activities in the hotel. If you still want to go out and have fun, I think staying at Le M√©ridien for three days is not enough! Just a bubble party can mobilize all the kids in the hotel, it's really exciting!
In addition, I want to talk about the restaurant. Needless to say, Horizon Dining is so beautiful that I am at a loss for words! In addition, I strongly recommend the cafeteria, especially for the elderly and children. I am always worried about the hygiene and taste problems when going out for food. The local food in Hainan does not meet the taste of children, so I choose the cafeteria. Very rich and diverse, can meet the needs of all age groups.
It can be said that Le Meridien Wanning is a hotel that I will go to again!

msg:The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are huge. Clean and hygienic hotel service is also very good. Stephen added WeChat before arriving. Ask what is needed. Our baby is very small and needs a bedside, a bottle warmer, and a bottle sterilizer. The children were so happy that they climbed onto their little bed and jumped up and down. The hotel's Horizon Restaurant has a beautiful view, and it is recommended to drink afternoon tea while looking at the sea. The breakfast is very rich, with local specialties, such as Hou'an powder Qingbuliang are all eaten, just pay attention to the time to go. There are many people at 8-9 o'clock. We were tired from snorkeling and ordered room service. Hainanese Chicken Rice is real Hainanese Chicken Rice and Beef Noodles. Stephen can also help you organize activities and give you travel tips. We booked the hotel's trip to the sea to snorkel, fish, ride a motorboat and take beautiful photos. Even in bad weather there are daily activities at the hotel. Our little one is happy in the bubble pool. It's really a very good family hotel, I will visit again next time.

The personal butler-style caring service guided us how to check in, how to make reservations for hotel activities, etc., and responded to us in a timely manner. All kinds of problems solve our needs, so that we can stay worry-free throughout the whole stay!
The hotel rooms are comfortable and clean, with clothes dryers, drying racks, ironing racks... Don't worry about not having any clothes to change after riding the waves or swimming!
A variety of free drinks are prepared in the room, the hotel's shuttle bus is on call, and the swimming pool, beach, and room can be switched at any time, so it takes no effort to bring a baby!
The hotel arranges a lot of activities every day. The children planted plants, made handmade soap, drinks, desserts, and the bubble party was a blast! There is no need to worry about the child just changing the place to dig sand! The child keeps saying that he will come again next time, and the roll call is only for Amy!
Emmy's beach sand is the softest, the sea is particularly blue, and the Chloe blue sea does not need a filter at all. Compared with the Westin next door, I still like the simple and elegant style of Emmy. Every shot is a blockbuster!
The buffet breakfast ingredients at Horizon Restaurant are very fresh, and the taste is the best hotel buffet breakfast I have had in the past two years. The standard and taste are quite online! Dining in a restaurant with such a beautiful scenery, double enjoyment of taste and vision!

Sure enough, professional things should be left to professional people!

Disadvantages: On the day of check-in, I don't know what the time of the tour group will be. It took a long time to check in, and the lobby is very hot. Also, there are so many children! Just like a kindergarten, I think it's a perfect hotel for bringing children, because everything for children is very thoughtful, but for adults... there are really too many dolls. üòÇüòÇ

Overall, it was a pleasant stay and travel experience! !

Professionals do professional things!

The hotel is decorated in a Southeast Asian style, which is very special, and my husband and I like it very much.

I have tried both breakfast and dinner buffets, and the dishes are rich and delicious! ! ! It is recommended to add a Sichuan dry dish to the seasoning of the hot pot for dinner, it would be better~

What surprised me the most was the bar, which was delicious. We moved from Westin's Hard Bar, where the Internet celebrity was really bad, and this is the real cocktail! ! The price and portion are also more suitable, highly recommended!

Moreover, swimming rings and beach seats will not be charged separately (although there is not much money in a hotel on Wuzhizhou Island here, the perception is not very good)

I also experienced surfing at the hotel. There are very few people. It feels like the sea area only belongs to us. It‚Äôs really good~ The price is only a little higher than Riyue Bay, I think it‚Äôs acceptable~

The hotel‚Äôs exclusive beach has very few people and the sea water is also warm. , very suitable for surfing beginners, the beach is delicate and barefoot, there is no burden at all, the waves are not big, the elderly and children are suitable for swimming in the sea. The Horizon Restaurant located by the beach is definitely the first choice for those who want to see the sea but are afraid of the sun. The window view is first-class and the food is also very good. We came here by car from Haikou, and the hotel has free parking.

I don't know if all the people who say that Wanning is good are all local turtles who have never seen the world. The climate is still not as good as Sanya, the sea and sky are not as blue as Sanya, but it will be cooler than Sanya. But compared with Samui, Phuket, Bohol, Sri Lanka and even Jeju Island, not to mention Sabah and Tonga, but the price is very high (including air tickets), but it cannot be denied that in China, apart from Xisha, this place can be regarded as a sea.
The price is much more affordable than Sanya, and the hotel is still not cheap. A serving of pasta is 98 and fried noodles are 128, but they are delicious! Breakfast including Korean food is delicious!
Then talk about the details. Le Meridien is a well-known 5-star hotel with good service facilities. Especially this Le Meridien, just like the Le Meridien I lived in Phuket! It shows that the design of the hotel is quite Southeast Asian. But the Le Meridien sea view room in Phuket is only 800 yuan. The swimming pool is too small! The beach is actually managed by someone. I often see cleaners picking up trash on the beach, but there is still a lot of trash, see the photo! It shows that the quality of Chinese people is still very poor. In this case, it is also finer than the Hilton sand next to it. I walked along the beach to Hilton, and the sand on Hilton Beach is obviously a little thicker.
The service of the hotel is good, except for the fast delivery of pasta, the fried noodles I ordered, and the delivery time of other meals is 1 hour and 10 minutes.
When I checked in, no one introduced the hotel. Compared with Emmy abroad, I have to criticize it. When I came on vacation, no one introduced where the restaurant is, where the activity center is, where the swimming pool is, and I later found out that the reason for not introducing it is...the hotel is too It's small, and at a glance, you can see everything wherever it is.
The breakfast is great, there is refreshing and refreshing, it is very delicious, there is a queue for the noodle stall, the bread is also good, there are small changes every day. Lianwu is crunchy and sweet, but not every day. Watermelon is not sweet every day. In addition, there is a queue for breakfast. After 8:30, there is a queue for breakfast! The queue for fried chicken is long, so don't even think about getting in within half an hour. In short, I will never come to Hainan in this life. For special occupations, my unit does not allow me to go abroad, so I can go abroad after waiting, and I still have to go abroad to go to the beach.

Thank you to the female manager of the Shoreline Restaurant, who gave me a roasting machine that was charred on the outside and tender on the inside on April Fool's Day.

The hotel's beach at night is especially suitable for sitting, drinking and blowing the sea breeze.

Le M√©ridien really impressed me this time. After arriving at the hotel, the front desk upgraded the double swimming room for free. The service attitude is also very good. The facilities in the room are complete and perfect, and the small swimming pool in the courtyard is very beautiful.
After checking in, my husband had a fever. The hotel helped me with a thermometer and ginger soup. It was really heart-warming. The housekeeper, Chen Xia, was also very kind and thoughtful. Thank you very much.
The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool and its own beach. It is very pleasant to stay in the hotel for two days. The Horizon restaurant is also beautiful.

Facilities: Stay in the parent-child room, the two beds are very comfortable, there are tents and toys, and the lighting is comfortable. I especially like the dryer, and the clothes are finally dry.
Hygiene: The entire hotel is very clean and cleaned in a timely manner.
Environment: Private beach, quiet, but the water where kayaking is a bit smelly, hope to improve.
Service: The most praiseworthy thing about Emmy is the service! The hotel housekeeper added me on WeChat one day before check-in, informing me of the hotel's parent-child and adult activities, and I can make an appoin**ent one day in advance. After checking into the hotel, the butler helped to make an appoin**ent for the restaurant in advance and reminded the cleaning staff to clean up. Asked if I needed a late checkout before leaving the hotel. I would like to thank the front desk brother Zard. At the same time, I would also like to thank Beiye Planet, where the children participated in all day-long activities. The teachers of Beiye Planet are very friendly and have fun activities. In addition, the young men at the entrance of the hotel are very good. They took the initiative to help carry the luggage and carry the children. Thank you.

Suggestion: Add children's pools and children's facilities so that parents can lie flat on family vacations.
Breakfast is particularly unpalatable, please improve and improve.
Chinese restaurant, Korean food and lobby bar are all delicious, not bad.

There are many activities and facilities. The children are very happy to play. Before leaving, they even waved at the swimming pool, reluctant to part. The Horizon Restaurant is right on the beach, with the blue sky, the sea and the beach as far as the eye can see. The afternoon tea here is really nice. Although the food is average, the essence of the afternoon tea is the mood and state. Who cares about the food, enjoy life while looking at the beautiful scenery, This is the truth.

What touched me the most was that the child lost his temper this morning and did not eat breakfast in the cafeteria. I was worried that the child would be hungry, so I asked Stephen to see if I could send some bread and yogurt to the room for the child. Stephen took the trouble to please The service staff brought me three pieces of bread and three pieces of yogurt, which can be said to be very considerate. I hope that I can still enjoy this kind of warm care when I come next time. I feel that staying at Le M√©ridien for two nights is a bit short. Next time stay more nights
It is also worth mentioning that Beiye Planet and adult activities are very well designed. Beiye has indoor handicrafts and outdoor classes close to nature, which fully meet the different personalities of children. Adult activities include yoga and paddle boards. The St. Regis paddling board costs 498, and Emmy is actually free.

Meals: For breakfast, you can upgrade to the Horizon Restaurant with extra money, and watch the sea while eating breakfast. Of course, the all-day restaurant has a window seat and you can see some sea. Horizon food is a little more refined. In addition to breakfast, Horizon can also order a la carte.

The afternoon tea in the Jiajing Lobby Bar is good, including desserts, savory food, fruit drinks, and can be packed if you can‚Äôt finish it. The service is also very good.

3 days and 2 nights, we had a great time üòÉ

msg:I can finally go out and play. In the last few days of the Chinese New Year, I decided to take my baby to Hainan. I chose Le M√©ridien in Shimei Bay, Wanning, Hainan. One day in advance, Stephen at the front desk of the hotel had called me in advance the day before I arrived. Asked about my specific arrival time and number of people in detail. He also introduced the situation of the hotel, joined the booking group of the hotel Beiye Planet and adult activities, and introduced the various restaurants of the hotel. And helped me make a reservation for the Horizon Restaurant. Restaurant food is good. When I couldn't find the sand digging tools to borrow, I sent 2 sets to the room for me. The hotel provides fruit when you check in, and the minibar is free for the first day of check-in. The parent-child room is good. The hotel beach is also very good. Will come again next time.

The lobby of the hotel is very large and looks very high-end. After entering the hotel, there will be a waiter who will help you with your luggage. Because you arrived at the hotel in advance, the housekeeper Stephen will help you make an appoin**ent for parent-child activities and store your luggage. Tell me, you can bring it first Children can go swimming in the pool or play with sand on the beach. Intimately, the room will be cleaned as soon as possible and let me check in as soon as possible. After checking in, the first impression is that the room is so big. The hotel also thoughtfully prepared children's toiletries and bathrobes for the children. The hotel's seafood buffet is also great. The dishes are very fresh. The afternoon tea is also exquisite. The hotel's own beach has very fine sand and is very comfortable to walk on. There are deck chairs on the beach, and it is a great experience to lie down and enjoy the sea breeze. Next time I will choose Emmy. It is worth checking in twice.

The ceiling can only be used to describe it. The horizon restaurant‚Äôs view and filming effects are really amazing. There are also parent-child activities in their family, which are not repeated every day, and you can choose what the children like to participate in. Another thing is that the humidity in this kind of seaside city is relatively higher, but their family actually arranged a clothes dryer for the room! Really feel at home! So thoughtful! If you are afraid of the cold sea water, you can go to the heated swimming pool! Only what you didn't expect, nothing they didn't do!

The room package booked on Ctrip, the room is big, nice, and quiet. If I come again in the future, I will choose Le M√©ridien.

On the day of check-in, seeing us with children, the lobby immediately upgraded us to a parent-child family suite for free. The room is spacious, a double bed room is equipped with a single bed, a small tent, a wooden horse, a toilet seat for the child, as well as body wash, shampoo and toothbrush for the child. The hotel service is quite humanized.
The heated swimming pool is open all day, and guests staying in the hotel can use the swimming ring for free, so the children have a great time playing.
Walking down the lobby is the hotel's private beach, where you can experience surfing, motorboat rides, beach motorcycle rides, or simply sit on the beach chairs, blowing the sea breeze in a daze, comfortable and comfortable.
The hotel also provides accompanying travel photos for hotel guests, and 5 photos are given away for free. If you need more photos, you can buy one for 30 yuan, or directly pack 599 yuan to buy a full set of products. The photos are followed by a dedicated photographer, and the technology is quite good. The children like this trip very much, and we are also very satisfied.
The only downside is that maybe because it was the Chinese New Year period, there were too many people for breakfast. For two consecutive days, we had to go up to the Chinese restaurant on the second floor to eat, but the ramen on the second floor is delicious [naughty]
Next time I have a chance, I will definitely stay again [happy]

msg:I come to Sanya 4-5 times a year, but due to the epidemic, I have been unable to leave. This time, I can finally start my trip to Sanya again. It stands to reason that I would choose a hotel in Haitang Bay, but I chose Shimei Bay due to the bombardment of **. In fact, when Shimei Bay booked Le M√©ridien or Westin, I was quite hesitant. Later, I chose Le M√©ridien because of the sentence "Angels are in Le M√©ridien" (it turns out that Le M√©ridien is the filming location of the movie If You Are the One. Every time I think of this, I will think of Liao Fan's sentence "Brother, people are Jianguo").

1. Staying at Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay Let's summarize the advantages and disadvantages. Let's talk about the advantages first:
1. The staff is very enthusiastic and I met Ventrue, the housekeeper who I have never met before. I learned that it was my birthday and specially arranged a mousse cake, which was very delicious. Of course, there are many staff members who have not had the opportunity to call out their names. They are very professional. Unlike the hotel staff in Haitang Bay, they keep a very appropriate distance from us, not too familiar and enthusiastic, and of course not far away from people. It makes people very comfortable. So there is the beginning of "never met before", the arrangement is perfect, if you are called, you will return, if there is something, you will arrange it, but you may not meet the real person, and sometimes I even think that Ventrue may be just a "code name" and behind it is a team that carefully plans for you.
2. The hotel environment and facilities are just like the staff, which are always just right. The guest room facilities are complete (I strongly recommend using their wooden combs, of course, the shaving supplies are the most exquisite sets I have seen in Sanya). There are highlights outside, such as the Horizon Restaurant, the Amy minibus, and the LOGO on the beach are all very beautiful. In addition, there is a hidden easter egg that crosses a stone bridge between Amy and Westin, and there is also a beach bar (the wine is average, the scenery is not bad.) The hotel parking lot is generally far away except for the parking spaces at the door, but fortunately there are staff who can drive electric cars there, which is very convenient.
3. The surrounding area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel seems to be deserted, but there are always surprises as long as you explore. First of all, which Lingshui sour noodles are the best? I personally think that Fangjie sour noodles next to Liu Sijie Lingshui sour noodles on the left hand side of the hotel are the best. Secondly, where can I buy coffee? Turn left and M1 is very good. Finally, where to buy fruit? Locate Bali Village. Along the way, you will pass a bunch of fruit vendors. Remember to add WeChat and they will deliver to your door. The price is very fair and delicious. Coconuts are 8 yuan for yellow ones, and pineapples and mangoes are only 10 yuan.
2. After talking about the advantages, there must be disadvantages:
1. It is more troublesome to pick up takeout at the hotel. You need to pick it up at the entrance of the car.
2. It is really a parent-child hotel. There are too many children. If you mind, it is not recommended.
3. Breakfast ends at 11 o'clock, which is great, but because there are too many children, it is a bit noisy. The water on the cold plate soaking rack has been dyed colorfully.
3. Tips:
1. Rent a car, rent a car, you must rent a car, otherwise it is really inconvenient.
2. Don't expect too much from the size and richness of the scenic area. It is understandable, but don't expect too much.

I really wanted to experience the Horizon Restaurant when I was making a guide. Breakfast, but it seems that you can only eat in separate rooms. I didn't expect Amanda to upgrade the breakfast for two days to the Horizon Restaurant. I was really surprised and liked it. Facing the sea, I started a good day. The breakfast is very rich, and the black truffle shrimp dumplings are too Bravo! Be sure to give Ms. Amanda full marks! The hotel's sandy beach is very delicate, and it is super beautiful at sunset!

Le M√©ridien (Wanning Branch) is one of the parent-child hotels I have stayed in for many times in Sanya. I am quite satisfied with the environmental service. The New Year's Eve dinner buffet at the Horizon Restaurant is great, and the Korean restaurant is also very good. It's just that there are too many people in one restaurant for breakfast during the Chinese New Year, and you need to wait in line. In short, Amy is definitely the first choice in Wanning, it is worth the money, and I am satisfied!

The hotel has a Southeast Asian style and is a well-known parent-child hotel. Basically, it is for traveling and vacationing with children. It has an exclusive beach with few people and beautiful scenery. The room service is timely and thoughtful. There are 4 dining areas in the hotel. The all-day restaurant and Korean restaurant are cost-effective, especially I would like to thank the customer service Amanda for her enthusiastic service. Two days passed quickly, the child is very nostalgic, it is worth coming again.

The hotel's Horizon Restaurant is a beautiful place to check in and take pictures, which should not be missed. During the stay, the customer service was available 24 hours on WeChat to help answer doubts. It was a very happy and comfortable stay. I will come again next time I come to Wanning!

During the stay, he suffered from acute gastroenteritis due to acclimatization. Stephen immediately arranged for the kitchen to cook porridge and deliver it to the guest room. Really Very heartwarming! The hotel arranges a lot of parent-child activities and adult activities every day. Going to the left of the beach is a group of reefs. Children go there every day to play in the water and dig sand to find shells and coral stones. They are very happy! The night view here is also great, and the dining experience at the Horizon Restaurant next to the beach at night is also amazing, and there are fireworks to watch, but the price is a bit expensive. The hotel has surfing experience, and motorboats can go to the opposite Jiajing Island to see the glass sea. You can enjoy the beauty of Wanning when you stay at Le Meridien. I really recommend it!

The hotel assistant, Venture, will contact you the day before check-in and warmly introduce the hotel's catering and entertainment activities. You can make reservations in advance for the activities you want to participate in before you arrive at the store (varies from person to person) You can always find something you are interested in). Arrived early on the day of check-in, and the room was ready. Before leaving the store, Venture would also ask whether to delay check-out. There are strict security guards at the seaside. Although the dangerous behavior of going into the sea was stopped, I still want to thank the hotel for thinking about the safety of the guests (it would be better to be gentle). In addition, there are not as many tourists at the seaside as in Sanya. The sea is blue and the waves are big and the sand is fine. Suitable for surfing, snorkeling or surfing. The hotel has Korean food, Western food, and Chinese food. Both Korean food and Chinese food are online. It is also convenient to drive to the Shenzhou Peninsula in Riyue Bay. The most important thing is the little assistant Venture, you can just ask him for anything.

The pillows are large and small to meet different needs. The children also like the small swimming pool that comes with the room. The child's gastroenteritis made the bathroom dirty, and the service staff came to clean it up in time. They asked us to call if necessary, and we can come in the middle of the night. The hotel has fun parent-child activities and adult activities every day, and can also provide childcare services, so adults can enjoy their free time.

The breakfast in the western restaurant was quite rich. One day there were too many people eating breakfast in the Chinese restaurant, and the variety was much less. I sent a few travel photos, and it is observed that I will add more money to buy a few more in the end, and some packaged ones cost more. The hotel organizes some free activities every day. We didn't have time to participate this time. The photos are not bad. In short, apart from being expensive, there is basically nothing wrong with this hotel.

Fortunately, I chose Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay!
Four hours before check-in, I received a professional call from Mr. Venture at the front desk of the hotel: asking when I will arrive at the store and if I have any special needs... I took the initiative to add WeChat, and sent links related to hotel services, as well as his own well-designed travel guide, Everything is available. Reassuring and comfortable.
When you check in, everything in the hotel meets your expectations: warmth, cosiness, leisure...
The exclusive beach is worthy of Le M√©ridien's quality: unobstructed sea views, fine sand and comfortable feet, and supporting facilities that complement each other.
Heated swimming pool facing the sea. Watch the turbulent waves, enjoy the gentle waves, no entanglement, only enjoyment.
There is a horizon restaurant by the sea, with western-style dining, wine tasting, and delicious food. It's a pity that we couldn't make a reservation in advance, so let's enjoy it next time.
The room is relaxing and quiet, very suitable for calming down and starting again. The considerate free laundry drying service can be said to be considerate.
I would also like to thank Mr.Venture at the front desk again. From the beginning of check-in to the return trip after departure, he was responsive, considerate and caring. The butler-style service added to our experience of staying this time! Thanks!
Goodbye, Emmy! See you, Le Meridien!

Amanda, the guest relations officer at the front desk, is really professional, caring and thoughtful! From check-in and check-out to restaurant reservations and children's sand-digging toys, I was very thoughtful! Answer all questions! No matter how late it is, we will respond as soon as possible! The room service staff are super nice, I forgot to ask for their names, but they are very enthusiastic! After staying for two nights, the children said that they did not enjoy themselves! The dishes in the Korean restaurant are also delicious üòã! Le M√©ridien will be the first choice when you come to Wanning next time! The beach üèñÔ∏è the waves üåä are super beautiful

The hotel's service is very considerate, especially the customer service candy is very enthusiastic and the manager on duty, Chen Xia, moved me so much that I didn't want to go to the next stop. Because of a little episode after check-in, I specially provided me with a late check-out and carefully prepared lunch. When I left, I also gave me two snacks and a Bulgari travel sample, which made me feel embarrassedüòÖ It is very suitable for vacation, next time you must not come alone.

-
‚ù§Ô∏èAs soon as the hotel enters the lobby, there is a central axis. If you continue to go outdoors, there is a super heated swimming pool in the middle. In this season, Wanning's body feels very low in the morning and evening. What surprised me is that the swimming pool is at a constant temperature, and the water is very warm, and it doesn't feel cold when swimming at night. üòá
‚ù§Ô∏è Standing in the lobby and looking at the sea has a kind of symmetrical beauty, I strongly suspect that his designer is obsessive-compulsive disorder haha üòÑ. Taking pictures in front of the swimming pool at sunset can also capture the sunset glow, which is really beautiful. üòç
‚ù§Ô∏èThe hotel is very close to the beach, and you can walk to the beach in 5 minutes. There are also many types of single-family villas. The seats of the villas are closer to the sea and have private swimming pools. üòÜ

‚ù§Ô∏èIn addition, the hotel's Horizon restaurant is really beautiful, the beach and the sea are just outside the door, and the breakfast is also very delicate, it is really romantic to have breakfast here! üòâ

‚ù§Ô∏è There are still quite a few places where you can take pictures and check in, such as the beach üèñÔ∏è, coconut groves ü••, swings and retro buses, etc. There is also a huge "LeMeridian" logo on the beach, which is very suitable for taking photos

‚ù§Ô∏èAddress: In Shimei Bay Tourist Resort, Liji Town, Wanning City (near Jiajing Island)
‚ù§Ô∏èTraffic: I don‚Äôt have a self-driving car. After arriving at Wanning Station, I called Didi to go there. There are many cars and it is very convenient.
‚ù§Ô∏èThere is a regular shuttle bus from the hotel to Sanya Airport. We took the bus at 8:50 in the morning, and it takes about an hour and a half to drive to the airport. The class we sat in was just us. üôÉ
-
‚ù§Ô∏èFinally, Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay in Wanning is worth recommending. Sisters who go to Wanning remember to experience it here! üò¨
‚ù§Ô∏èBy the way, I also want to thank my housekeeper, I forgot his name, because the mobile phone WeChat update, the previous records are gone. I have been sick recently, and it took so long to write a guide, I hope you can understand more!

The sand on the beach in Shimei Bay is fine and soft, the sea water is crystal clear, the sea breeze is gentle, and the sun is shining brightly. There is no need for any activities here. A few old girlfriends and old classmates just stay together like this, crazy and crazy, very happy, happy and happy! The photos are also very beautiful, and it is easy to make big movies! The service is also the best, especially the butler Stephen Xiao Wu, who is very careful. He contacted us in advance after we booked the room, and helped us suggest the itinerary. If there is any need for help, he will reply to us as soon as possible and provide help in time. I am very satisfied with Emmy's itinerary!

So I chose Wanning, a surfing paradise. There are many bays in Wanning. Compared with other bays, Shimei Bay is much quieter. The main reason is that the Le M√©ridien and Westin hotels under the Marriott Group contracted this beach next to each other.
The check-in experience was very good, the room type was upgraded for free, and we were given fruit for check-in as a gift. Here, I would like to thank the front desk Ivy for replying in time and helping us solve various problems.
In addition, Le M√©ridien arranges different schedules for adults and children every day. I like this kind of hotel very much. I feel that I can stay in the hotel for a whole day, and it is more in line with the style of a resort hotel. It is suitable for the whole family to travel together.
The Horizon Hotel here is definitely a perfect romantic a**osphere. When you come to dinner in the evening, you will also invite a harp performance. If you are a couple traveling, it will be the most romantic placeü•á
When I booked the room, I also gave a travel photo as a gift. The photos I took were also very high-end, and the circle of friends was praised again and again.
It would be perfect if the hotel could set up a beach bar again! ! üèñÔ∏è

Before arriving at the hotel, our exclusive butler Letty confirmed the itinerary with me by phone, and introduced the hotel's projects and surrounding related attractions through WeChat. And let me know that it is really meticulous. Letty had prepared the room well in advance of our arrival at the hotel and check-in was quick and smooth. Le M√©ridien is a luxury hotel that I am very impressed with. Not only is the design very good, the service this time is also online, and the butler responds to messages in a timely manner. Due to the itinerary and the weather, I couldn't experience some parent-child projects in depth. It was a pity, but the equipment, bedding, and food all left good memories. I look forward to meeting again in the future.

It‚Äôs not too ideal. It was originally a planting of grasses, so I didn‚Äôt hesitate when choosing the Wanning Hotel.
Facts have proved that it is very good value. Although the hotel is not short, it is well maintained and very clean and comfortable. Before check-in, a dedicated butler will contact you to inform you about the surrounding strategies, etc., and will pay attention to your check-in experience during your stay. Very kind. Our housekeeper, the venture, really would like to make a special comment. Really very very good! Super responsible! Great likeüëçüèª
We upgraded the room type for the second night and experienced super super trea**ent. This duplex villa is very suitable for families or many friends. Ideal! If it is a two-person vacation, the normal room is enough, and it is also very good. The hotel is equipped with a dehumidifier, so the room is not damp and very comfortable. All aspects are clearly arranged, the private beach that comes with you can sway freely, and those who like surfing can go to the lobby to book surfing events, and the room delivery is also very good, all of which are directly handled by the hotel lobby service station. A friend booked a surfing instructor who was also very professional.
The hotel breakfast is very rich, and there is a designated nucleic acid test in the lobby every day. It is also very convenient to eat around, and there are several restaurants that are great!
All in all, it is a hotel that you will not be disappointed with üè®, highly recommended! Worth planting, will visit again!

msg:A two day stay at the Le M√©ridien by chance, but I couldn't help but give a good review!
The original arrangement was to stay in Shimei Bay, Wanning for two days, then we booked Westin, then moved to Sanya, and stayed in Haitang Bay for another two nights. The Westin is also very comfortable to live in. Shimei Bay is so beautiful. But it turned out that after the Westin stayed in Sanya, the hotel was required by the hotel to monitor at home in the hotel room because of the itinerary. I left decisively, took a taxi from Sanya back to Shimei Bay, and temporarily booked Le M√©ridien next door, wanting to experience a different hotel.
Emmy is really great. After living in both of them, I think it is better than Westin, hahaha. During the epidemic period, there were few customers, so we upgraded the room. In particular, the butler manager Mabel was very considerate throughout the whole process, and communicated with us in a timely manner about various services of the hotel, nucleic acid testing, etc. We said we had a bit of a headache, and specially arranged to make ginger soup. Thank you for your kindnessüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
Le M√©ridien's overall architectural rooms are quite distinctive, and the outdoor swimming pool is beautiful. The breakfast is exquisite and arranged in a sea-view restaurant by the sea. The beef noodles really live up to the praise and are very delicious! There are plenty of activities for children and adults during the day. We participated in coconut picking and paddle boarding.
In short, the price performance ratio is super high and satisfied. And Shimei Bay is really recommended. Will come again in the future!

msg:I originally booked a double bed room. When I checked in, the manager on duty, Dolly, helped to upgrade the twin bed room. The room also came with a small bed similar to a couch, which is neither soft nor hard. Children under the age of five can sleep by themselves. Before, I was a little worried. It was the seaside, and it rained continuously recently. I didn‚Äôt know how humid the room would be, because the clothes that had been dried in Haikou for two days were still damp. Don't be too excited to find that the room is equipped with a dehumidifier here.
        Bringing a two-year-old child with unlimited energy, a careless vacation will turn into a crime. Especially in this cloudy and rainy day, once it rains heavily, it really affects the mood, but if you want to take your baby to play in the sand and water, you don‚Äôt have to go out for a day in the hotel. My children don‚Äôt want to go out at the beach. They always say that they haven‚Äôt played enough. The only limited possibility It‚Äôs time to eat, and it‚Äôs more troublesome to take the baby out to eat in the rain. The price of the food in the hotel must be high, and the taste is neither bad nor delicious.
There is also Beiye Planet in the hotel, which is for children to participate in playing various games. According to the notes, it is recommended that children over three years old participate. My family is not very cooperative when they are less than three years old. They don‚Äôt listen to commands when playing games. It can be hosted, but there is an additional charge. You can read the recommendations of other friends who have participated. I don't recommend checking in everywhere with a baby, you will not be happy if you are tired. If you want to come to recharge, but bring your baby to discharge, you can really choose Amy when you come to Mannings, the recommendation index ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê.

As a five-star luxury resort hotel, the supporting facilities are indeed invincible, but some configurations in the room are slightly outdated (pain point of opening early: for example, there is no USB port at the bedside or even extra power sockets), but the hotel is located in Shimei Bay The sea view is beyond the first line irreplaceable! And it is more suitable for surfing than the Westin next door because it opens earlier than the Westin, so it occupies the best bay in Shimei Bay! The hotel's sense of design and the combination of supporting facilities and sea views are also invincible! Wall Crack recommends Horizon Restaurant and Horizon Heated Swimming Pool, these two places can spend a day.
In addition, the service of the hotel is absolutely super five-star! ! ! As a resort hotel service itself is the top priority. The experience of staying at Le M√©ridien made me feel the ceiling of domestic resort hotel services. Stephen from the hotel sales depar**ent contacted me one day in advance to add me on WeChat and put the check-in matters and what he did by himself. Send me a little guide on eating, drinking and playing in Shimei Bay, which makes me feel at ease before entering the bay. I heard that we are all adults, so I was drawn into an adult activity group for hotel guests. This group publishes activities organized by the hotel every day, basically two in the morning and two in the afternoon, such as the Frisbee picking coconuts on the paddle board beach in the hotel river ( You must know that it is not the peak season of Mannings, and the hotel still provides many services regardless of cost, which is really not easy!) The hotel also provides nucleic acid service every morning, and Stephen will always remind us to do it~ Including upgrading my breakfast to comfort me The grief of being given a yellow code before and being unable to move in (that's another story that I won't mention here), and so on... In short, although I haven't met Stephen, I always feel that he's been with us all the time. Be around, solve our problems at any time and take care of our emotions ~ This experience is rare, far beyond expectations, and the satisfaction is very high!
Overall, Amy at Shimei Bay is well worth it
Come on, great value for money! Already planning my next visit with my husband! Of course, next time I look for Stephen, I must meet him and thank him in person! üòú

Sunbathe by the pool in the afternoon, close your eyes and enjoy the sea breeze

The biggest feature of the entire room type is that there is a private soup pool. I have an exclusive swimming pool. I really like it
Sitting in your own yard is also very holiday-like
What surprised me most was that Horizon Restaurant had a delicious breakfast at sunrise and breathed in the fresh seaside air to usher in a beautiful moment of the day
I met a super good butler, Venture, the little brother is very handsome, a little like Xiao Zhan, he is very caring and enthusiastic, he recommended a lot of options for eating, drinking and having fun, and taking pictures is also very tasteful, it is hard not to be such a handsome guy Love, I spent the most ideal vacation at Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay.

          After the closure of Southeast Asia, I could only travel to Hainan Island. After reading various strategies, I chose Shimei Bay Aimei. My itinerary starts from Tianya Town B&B, Yalong Bay, Atlantis, Wanning. Le M√©ridien is the best experience I have ever stayed in a five-star hotel. I, who have never been reluctant to comment too much on hotels, chose to seriously comment on Amy today. The check-in was very fast, and it also gave me a free room upgrade due to the epidemic. After the shuttle bus was delivered to the room, the huge living room area, as well as the courtyard swimming pool, free soft drinks in the refrigerator, and the favorite capsule coffee were imprinted in the eyes. The overall layout of the room is in the style of a Southeast Asian holiday, and it feels like Indonesia. There is also an exclusive housekeeper in the room. I would like to thank Letty here. I will answer all questions and answer all my questions enthusiastically. Thank you Letty for making me feel at home as a traveler. The buffet at the Horizon Restaurant is also a place to open my appetite. Looking at the sea and eating breakfast, it is very worth punching in. Better than any breakfast I've had at any 5 star hotel. A young lady in the breakfast room was very attentive. When she saw the traces of mosquito bites on my neck, she took out anti-mosquito water and sprayed it for me. She was so attentive! The travel photography in the hotel is also excellent. Immediately after the reservation, a special person will contact the appoin**ent time. The photography skills are very good. The photographer and the young lady who selected the film are very patient. It is indeed a travel photography in a five-star hotel. Next time I come to Sanya, I will still firmly choose Amy's ‚ù§Ô∏èüíã

The beach is clean, the seaside facilities are complete, and the view and food of the Horizon Restaurant are above the standard. The room is also very quiet and soundproof, even if it rained heavily at night, it did not affect the rest. The hotel staff are also very kind, especially the reception of Chen Xia at the front desk as the facade of the hotel, which left us with a very good first impression!

msg:During the tour around the island of Hainan during the epidemic, I have long heard that the hotel in Wanning is good, and I wrote the one I felt the most deeply at the end, and gave the best review to Amy üëçüèª The overall evaluation is excellent, whether it is the scenery, environment, hygiene , catering, service, I think it is necessary to give a super 5‚≠ê rating.
I have really stayed in so many hotels, and there is no better experience than in Le M√©ridien. Before check-in, Stephen at the front desk contacted me by phone to confirm our itinerary and service needs. I was moved by the warm service. When we arrived at the hotel, we were deeply attracted by the sea view in the lobby. Whether it was taking pictures üì∏ or swimming, it was a kind of enjoyment for us. Walking along the beach, the white, fine and soft sand looked very healing~ Amy's beach It is indeed very beautiful, and taking pictures also feels like a vacation abroad.
The hotel is very heart-warming. There are still many activities to participate in during the epidemic. The arrangements are clear and clear, so that we are not unfamiliar in the hotel. The breakfast in the restaurant is also very good, which can meet the needs of vacation, and enjoy the food and nature on the beach. It is worth mentioning that the hotel can do nucleic acid in the lobby every day, which is really very detail-oriented and adds points to the details!
I look forward to the next time I come to Hainan, and I must stay in Aimei for a few more days!

The hotel's dining is also good. The horizon restaurant faces the sea and has an invincible view. The food in the Chinese restaurant is also very good. The Venture service at the front desk is very good. If you have any questions, you will give feedback as soon as possible. They also gave us a cake on the wedding anniversary, which is very happy.

The room service staff are also very polite, and they always greet guests warmly when they pass by! Not to mention the hardware facilities of the hotel, the newly renovated hotel, the room service is thoughtful, and all the supplies are complete.

There is always a variety of food and beverages that suit your taste buds. There are many parent-child activities and adult play activities in the hotel, you can have fun according to your own schedule. When you travel here, I think you should come to play more in the sea. The hotel has an exclusive beach, the white sand is soft and comfortable to step on, the sea is clear and transparent, a holy place for surfing, snorkeling nearby, ‚õµÔ∏è, and other activities. , It's really decompressing, a very nice travel experience, and I look forward to seeing you again with Amy Shimei Bay next time!

This time, Amy is a blind selection haha. The lady at the front desk, Monica, called me the day before check-in to tell me what to pay attention to because I didn't do too many strategies. The hotel also made reservations while walking.

Both families of our group chose the double bed room for leisurely water. The room is very large and spacious.
It is really recommended to bring your own independent swimming pool. You can play in the water anytime. Of course, the outdoor swimming pool is also very üâëÔ∏è Adults can swim freely haha

With the baby, I just want to "put it down" in the hotel quietly, so I have three meals a day in the hotel. The breakfast and dinner in the western restaurant are quite satisfactory and convenient.
Of course, there are a lot of activities in the parent-child hotel. You can check in advance what projects are suitable for you. This time Puma's pop-up is also very suitable for all kinds of photos!

ps: On the first day, we arrived at the hotel room early, but the lady at the front desk also kindly gave us a few coffee coupons. No matter what problems we encountered, Ms. Monica was also responsive. Thank you :) In general, the work encountered The staff are very nice, I will continue to choose here next time I come to ManningsüòÜüòÜ

The hotel's main restaurant, Horizon, is on the beach, the a**osphere is very good, and there are performances in the evening. There is no one on the beach during the day, maybe everyone is afraid of the sun, but it satisfies my husband and I to the greatest extent. After a week, I tanned rye, he tanned whole wheat, even happy. It is very pleasant to take a walk on the beach after breakfast (not afraid of the sun). Playing Frisbee in the evening, bubble sea water, and watching the stars at night (afraid of the sun) are all beautiful. The hotel has water sports. My husband and I learned to surf together. If we don't rush, we are addicted to it. Next time, we will continue to learn and experience the thrill of surfing. If you go to Wanning to play with your friends, you can stay worry-free, which is definitely a happy and comfortable experience.

The beach is very beautiful, the water is warm and the sand is white. You can't go to the sea after sunset. You can watch the invincible sea view in the swimming pool, or play with the sand on the beach and take pictures. The western restaurant on the beach at night needs to book in advance because there are many people.
We didn't make a reservation and waited until eight o'clock to be seated. The environment is very good with music and a**osphere. The food couldn't keep up with the environment, so I mentioned to Letty that she kindly applied for a free drink from the minibar in the room.
It is very suitable for couples and their children to come on vacation. One day is really too busy. I came to Hainan to experience ten hotels in ten days around the island. Yalong Bay is too lively, and Shimei Bay is suitable for me.
The breakfast is very rich to 11.30, which is very good, because I am here for vacation and not to get up early. !
Thank you Letty for your caring service all the way. Next time I come back, I must stay for a few more days!

I don't know if the rating is based on the rating or the service is bad Together with the door in the middle of the room, the other room is still locked. There is no children's bathrobes and slippers. There is nothing. It was sent after the request. It means that there is no other room prepared in advance. Stop pressing has been answered by someone in the room. Someone is still dying. Press until you open the door to come and clean the room. Don't give up after pressing one room, even enter the Unicom room and ring the other doorbell to wake the child up! After waking us up we were told that no cleaning was required today. Also asked why we didn't clean it? ? What time can I go out to clean... The hotel has a lot of parent-child projects, but all of them need to be reserved in advance. The key is to outsource them to others and add an appoin**ent. You need to contact at least 3 waves of people (the front desk contractor in charge of the project docking) People) In the end, I was told that the single item of the Jiajing Island package was full, or like I added two people, I was told that I couldn‚Äôt participate in the separate program without taking the package and I was ignored... So many fancy hunger marketing appoin**ents Not making an appoin**ent feels so bad! Come out and play, there are not so many plans, okay? The service of the western restaurant is also weak! The salad was tasteless We asked the waiter what sauce to use and he told us that's what we ordered and that's how it was done... The environment honestly can't compare to Perfume Bay. Because the over-industrialized beach is contracted, it means that you can't surf alone without smuggling and teaching or taking lessons. You will be called back by whistling again and again... If you can't make an appoin**ent for the project, you can spend it in the pool... The pool is so small that it starts to be crowded at 11:00 and it is full of people at 6:00. ‚Ä¶ 4,500 rooms a day, the bathroom is still moldy ‚Ä¶ Parent-child handicraft class was told before the appoin**ent that you need to be hosted, you can send a private message to the teacher. Our child is already 11 years old, so what we asked ourselves to participate in is also a default reply... Many marketing things in the hotel are only in name only... Although the surfing experience class is only 10 minutes, the attitude is also a face, we understand the hot weather and don't take it People are cheap and don‚Äôt use experience coupons. After the 99 yuan 10-minute experience class, I told the coach how long the child can charge the money, and have fun. Even if we reach the upper limit of the package, we pay according to the upper limit. To "can't make it" but the whole process did not see other guests and the guests behind it was also magical. . . The whole hotel is baffling. There are also people who live to sell houses and enter the hotel to live broadcast. It is super low... Similarly, we used to be in Lingshui's perfume bay Narada villa, the adults are not mixed, the swimming pool is huge, and the beach is casual! Only 2000‚ûï a night. Although the service in the whole of Hainan is average, such a service experience at such a price is a long time to see‚Ä¶

I would say Amy wins. Did not feel that the Le M√©ridien facility was old.
On the contrary, the facilities such as bathroom and balcony room are very comfortable.
In particular, Amy was built relatively early. Southeast Asian style.
Corridor hollow design. Very airy. The room was cool.
Especially what surprised me the most.
The front desk Ivy called and added WeChat the night before check-in.
Notices are given in advance. Children's activities.
Let's plan very well.
Another point. Amy is not that big.
So the regions seem to be very far apart.
It's not too far to go anywhere.
Not like a Westin. too tired. It really killed me! !

msg:Amy ---- fall in love with your "beauty"
In one sentence: If you bring a baby, if you come to Shimei Bay, Le M√©ridien Hotel is the best choice.
Two years ago, I went to Amy because of a person in the circle of friends, so I planted grass. Later, because of the epidemic, I couldn't do it. I summed up my experience this year. As soon as the baby finished the test, he set off immediately, and finally came to the seaside. Amy.
My impression of Sanya is only Howard Guoguang in Sanya, who brought Dabao and a family of friends to live alone in 2019, without any faults. This time, the family of four and two friends came to Shimei Bay, and I felt what the legend is. No. 1 in the parent-child hotel. During our trip to Sanya, we stayed in three hotels in total - 3 nights at Le M√©ridien, 1 night at Park Hyatt, and 2 nights at St. Regis. Le Meridien is also recognized as the best experience by us.
Service: The biggest highlight, the day before I arrived, someone from the hotel called me and added me on WeChat, providing any possible help for my entire trip, answering any questions, and responding to any requests. When I arrived at the hotel by car, there was a special person to unload my luggage. Fast, you can see the staff everywhere in the hotel, even the cleaning staff, they all smile at us, tell the housekeeper if you need anything, and they will be delivered to the room soon. The coconut I picked from the coconut tree, there are also people in the lobby Open the coconut for me without any impatience. There is a group in the hotel, which is full of various activities with children and custody services. Let me tell you a detail. I didn't know there was a tree climbing activity until the night before I left. I really want to experience it with my children. After I told the housekeeper, the housekeeper helped me contact. I asked the teacher, first tell me that I can't arrange the next day to climb the tree, because all the coaches have tasks, let me contact the teacher to see it in person, I told the teacher that we really want to have this experience, and we will check out the next day Yes, the teacher worked very hard to help us arrange tree climbing, I sincerely thank you! In addition, the travel photography of the hotel is very good. I made an appoin**ent with 399 for two hours. I thought it was good at the time. Later, I took pictures of the hotel and found that the hotel was better. They will adjust the color tone later, and the effect is really good. It's not bad. The negatives are packaged at 599, and the singles are 30. I packaged them, and I think it's worth it.
Safety: Staff can be seen everywhere in the hotel, the route is clear and clear, and the sense of security is very strong. My big boy is about to be in the third grade. After I took him around on the first day, he could play on the beach by himself the next day. Walk back to the room successfully. I am very obsessed and keen to catch the sea. I spent 5 nights in Sanya for 6 nights. I went all the way to the end of the reef at the beach of the hotel. At 11 o'clock in the evening, the beach was dark and there were very few people catching the sea, but I can see staff patrolling the beach from time to time to remind us not to swim at night. The light from the staff's torches also gives us a great sense of security, which is not seen in the other two hotels.
Scenery: I have stayed in 4 hotels in Sanya in total, and Amy is the best for taking pictures. The beach is big and flat, and the Jiajing Island in the distance is also beautiful. The sky is clear during the day. Swimming pool, green grass, gliders flying over from time to time, large pet statues and swings of puma on the beach, sailing boats for posing in the distance, and there is a sky with lights hanging on the beach at night, and there are people standing there. Sing, close your eyes, listen to the sound of the waves, raise your head, it is the stars in the sky, my baby wears a headlamp and walks in a small river full of small fish, the feeling is great! My Erbao said that stepping on the sand here is like stepping on flour. I felt it, and there was indeed a section of sand that was super fine.
Activities: There are many activities in the hotel, indoor ones can do handicrafts, outdoor ones can paddle board, bubble fights, climb coconut trees to pick coconuts, make fires and cook corn, etc. There are children and adults, and there are also on the beach There are many activities, such as beach volleyball, beach football, speedboats, surfing, banana boats, etc. on the beach. You can also contact the housekeeper to introduce the itinerary to Jiajing Island by yacht (699 per person). I only love catching the sea, so during the day, the baby digs and digs. They swim in the sand, and at night I take them to catch crabs and fish.
Food: Our room is very close to the restaurant, and the management is in place. When there are no seats inside, there is a queue at the door. There will not be many people crowding together in the restaurant. As for food, everyone has different tastes. It seems that the variety is still very rich. We ordered the restaurant's coconut chicken hot pot and steak set the next night, which was delicious. On the last morning, the housekeeper also upgraded the breakfast at the horizon restaurant for us. Although the variety is relatively small, the scenery is still great.
Accommodation: I don't have high requirements for the internal facilities of the hotel, and I have no cleanliness. But in the three hotels, there is only Amy. We have not seen mosquitoes or been bitten. I don't feel any peculiar smell in the room, and the hot water in the bath is very hot. Great, the water pressure is very high, I didn't think this was an advantage, but after comparing the latter two hotels, these are really big advantages.
This is the first time I write a review on Ctrip, and I contribute to the Le M√©ridien hotel that I like very much. I hope my housekeeper Cara will always be here. Next time I come, we will stay at Le M√©ridien~~

For two nights, the average price of a three-bedroom pool villa at Westin is 16,000 a night
result. .
Amy's details and service are really good and perfect
The breakfast environment is also very good, high-end breakfast, clean and full of details
The beach is also beautiful and the swimming pool is also beautiful. Anyway, it makes people feel like a vacation.

The housekeeper is Stephen at the front desk who is especially attentive. They have been giving me various calls and WeChat asking what I need.
Really beats Westin üòÇ
On the third day, Westin lived in a villa of 15,000. As a result, there is a long queue for breakfast.
And the restaurant is on the negative floor below the lobby
The darkness was full of people, as if they were grabbing vegetables to eat in the bathroom. . The good mood of the morning is gone
Did we spend 16,000 to line up here for breakfast? ? ? And it's terribly unpalatable, and there's nothing expensive at all! ! !
I really regret booking two nights at Westin üòÇ! ! !
Add that Amy didn't get a better room because Amy was full
There is no room anymore

I advise everyone to choose Amy if you want quality and flair.
Westin is only for that kind of big team üòÇ

The hotel room is large and spacious, and the hygiene is also good. The staff will diligently supply daily necessities every day. There are four restaurants, among which the Horizon Restaurant is the favorite, where you can eat while watching the sea, and there are musicians playing.

Everyone is fine. The housekeeper, Ivy, answered all our questions about our check-in needs, and the service was very considerate. I hope she can work smoothly and live a happy life. There are several highlights of the hotel experience. Let me highlight: the beach is a place where many surfers are *******. If you can experience surfing by yourself, it is also very good. There are surf shops in the hotel and nearby to provide beginners experience classes. As long as there is a basic sports foundation, some people You can quickly get on the board and slide under the protection of the coach for a short time. If you have enough time to learn 6 lessons, you can get startedüòÅ. There is a surfing machine by the swimming pool in the hotel that is my favorite: as long as you have a basic sports foundation, it is easy to get started. You can experience the fun of chasing waves on a small skateboard, and it is very fun to have technical training and excitement. Another highlight is the hotel Chinese restaurant, very authentic Cantonese cuisine, fresh and lively seafood, vegetables are produced by their own farm, high quality, and the dining experience is very cost-effective. . Looking back with fond memories, so we will be back again ü•∞.

The horizon line restaurant has a first-line sea view, mainly grilled food, and it is a paradise for meat lovers. You can choose a restaurant at will to be seated, and at the same time order special dishes from other restaurants to be delivered to the restaurant where you are seated, which can also satisfy the taste buds of different companions. There is also a band performance during dinner. Friendly reminder, although the food is delicious, don't order too much. The hotel advocates the CD-ROM action, and the waiter will always remind everyone to restrain the impulse to order when ordering. Overall, I am very satisfied with this three-day and four-night experience. I will choose this hotel when I come to Mannings.

The coffee and the surrounding facilities are good. In short, it is worth the ticket price. I will give 10086 likes. Next time I come to Mannings, I will choose Amy again.

Because the epidemic was suffocating, I took advantage of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday to leave. The sun and greenery all the way was super good. The hotel design retains the original tropical natural scenery üå¥ It also incorporates the elements of the local culture of the Li nationality on Hainan Island, even the guest rooms. It also has an oriental aesthetic charm. From the open hotel lobby to the swimming pool that leads all the way to the sea, it is very beautiful. It is a blockbuster of a foreign-style island. The hotel's toiletries are malin goetz, which I love so much. The room comes with a swimming pool and the coconut tree and sunshine are just above the head‚òÄÔ∏è
Not to mention the hotel service. The front desk is very enthusiastic and will deliver to the room. It is the most comfortable service I have experienced. The front desk Stephen is very caring, and he will write a guide that he made very clearly. I was worried that I didn't do a guide. I was very nervous about leaving, but I played with peace of mind. Stephen was more like a personal butler~
Swimming pool: spacious, constant temperature, clean and comfortable (even if you go late at night, you won't feel cold)
Recommended restaurant: Horizon Restaurant The restaurant is connected to the beach and the sea, enjoying a feast of beach food, sea water, sunset glow, warm a**osphere, dazzling meals and Indonesian bands, bonfire party carnival, punch card and take photos are perfectüå∏
Water sports: surfing, snorkelingü§ø No need to worry about Xiaobai, the coach is very handsome and gentle
A very pleasant trip ~ I feel like I have left a country, everyone rush! !

There are also many free activities in the hotel, including curling, double kayaking, dinner at the beach camp at Horizon Restaurant in the evening, and live music ~ singers who are good at Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars are all my favorite songs, go together two nights!

Looking at the rolling waves, it really seems to be surfing. This time I brought the child, but the father of the child was not with me. I thought I would keep it next time.

There are special children's swimming pools, as well as various holiday parent-child amu*****t programs for children. Children will not feel bored and don't want to leave happily. The breakfast is also exquisite, until eleven o'clock, unlike other hotels, there is nothing to eat at ten o'clock. The beach waves are still perfect, perfect for surfing.

I am very grateful to him for his warm and careful arrangement and service. The day of check-in is the birthday of the child's father. The hotel has prepared a cake box and simple layout.

msg:The third stop of the Chris**as trip to Hainan. If you want to go to Shimei Bay and Riyue Bay, remember to get off the high-speed train at Shenzhou Station. Don‚Äôt go to Wanning Station. Wanning Station is too far! Taking a taxi will also be much more expensive. You can take a bus to the high-speed rail station when going to the city to do nucleic acid tests or when leaving, which is super convenient! It's a pity that it was rainy all the time when I went there, otherwise the photos would have been extremely photogenic. Personally, I think the decoration style of Le Meridien is better than that of the Westin next door, so I booked Le Meridien. The service needs to be improved, and the response to phone calls is not very timely. But they helped carry the luggage to the room, and after checking out, they called me to inquire. The afternoon tea at Horizon Restaurant has both good looks and taste, but it‚Äôs a bit hard to eat alone. Hahaha, I didn‚Äôt have time to eat lunch, so I skipped the afternoon tea and dinner after finishing the afternoon tea... The breakfast at the hotel was pretty good, and it was the best breakfast I‚Äôve ever had all the way from Wenchang, Haikou. Rich, better than Ritz Hilton. It was quite fun to catch up with the fireworks at night. There was originally an outdoor movie, but it was probably stopped because of the rain. This trip was quite rushed, so we stayed one night and then went to Riyue Bay. Shimei Bay is more suitable for lounging on vacation, while Riyue Bay is the real surfing paradise ~

Quiet: There are few people on the private beach of the hotel, the sea water is clear and blue, and the sandy beach is delicate.
Room: spacious, comfortable and clean
Eat: There are several restaurants in the hotel. The breakfast food is very rich. It can satisfy people of all tastes. It is a good mood to eat breakfast in front of the sea. The two-day dinners were all buffet at the All Day Western Restaurant. It was unexpectedly good. The ingredients, heat and taste were all very good. There were also singers singing, especially the desserts. There are many delicious and beautiful desserts. Let‚Äôs go while you lose weight ...
Service: Every employee is very professional and nice, especially my manager on duty, Miss Cara Wu, who has given detailed introductions and reminders since before check-in.

msg:The Ctrip score of this hotel is really too fake. This time I read Ctrip reviews to take my family on vacation this time, but I stayed in the hotel with the worst service. 1. The hotel‚Äôs wifi needs to be manually checked many times a day, not only the signal is not good but also often Disconnected, 2. Chinese restaurants, Western restaurants, and Korean restaurants have really poor awareness and behavior of waiters. Western restaurant waiters couldn‚Äôt find a waiter for a long time after ordering. If you want to add something and ask for other assistance services, there is no such thing for a long time. Renli, I ate coconut chicken hot pot twice in a western restaurant. I said many times that it took more than half an hour for 4 waiters to add soup. The ingredients in the Chinese restaurant are definitely not fresh. The waiter in the Korean restaurant spoke in a crazy tone: eat here Just wait for more than three hours, when the first wave is finished, don't we need to prepare? Eat as long as you can, or go for something else. The quality of the restaurant staff in this hotel is almost 10 times worse than the cost of the hotel. This is the first time I have seriously questioned how much Ctrip charged to give the highest score? ? Compared with Westin, the service gap is too big

Compared with other staff in the entire hotel, the staff of the room service depar**ent are in such good condition that they seem to be outsourced teams. From room cleaning, room delivery, and telephone answering staff, the work Very responsible, quick response, and very good attitude. When you meet any cleaning lady or delivery boy on the road, you will smile and say hello (the only person in the housekeeping depar**ent in the whole hotel will greet you actively, and other staff will look at you when you say hello to him) You look good at a glance).
    There are a few hotel complaints: 1. The water quality of the main sea-view constant temperature swimming pool is worrying. The color looks muddy to the naked eye, and it smells a little foul when entering the water. 2. Children's playground and cold water swimming pool close at 6 o'clock! first encounter! It may be that I was spoiled by the hotels in Haikou, Sanya, and I couldn't understand that as a resort hotel, the Children's Paradise and the swimming pool closed at 6 o'clock. 3. In the past experience in other hotels in Hainan, children's beach toys and swimming gear will be provided. For example, Westin put toys and swimming gear in the room when you check in. This time I stayed at Le M√©ridien, and I saw that the hotel provided it on the booking page, so I didn‚Äôt bring it for the children. As a result, it was limited! Never borrow. The funny thing about swimming gear is that the staff by the pool said, "Go to the pool to find it, and you can use it if someone left it there."
    Apart from the above flaws, what I want to comment the most is the service. Apart from the amazing room service staff who seem to be an outsourced team, other hotel staff have "**** just want to get off work" written all over their faces. They are very good at pretending not to hear you, for example: The juice for breakfast is placed under the bar counter and needs to be poured by the staff. When I saw the staff looking at the phone far away from the bar, I said politely, "Please pour me a glass of orange juice." The lady didn't even lift her head. He walked over slowly while looking at his phone, and said "what do you want". Another example: Two of the staff of Beiye Planet are actually ok and polite, and there is a girl who is very weird and pretends not to hear. There are also many wonderful experiences, I can't believe it. I have encountered individual staff with poor service in other hotels in the past, but the united service of all the staff of Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay (except room service) is not bad. This is the first time I have encountered a polite hotel. Emmy has been black all her life and will never choose again.

The best thing about the hotel is that it is humanistic, not a single gorgeous.

Every detail is done very well, you can feel the heart. We were lucky enough to meet like-minded travelers in the hotel, and we formed a group called love wins. The journey of discovery of the idea of liking the hotel lies in seeing the world with a new perspective. The meaning of travel is that it allows us to calmly adjust our body and mind and go on the road again. All things can be done with one heart. I will bring my family back to this hotel.

Two days before check-in, Miss Sissy from the Customer Relations Depar**ent added me to WeChat in advance, communicated with me about the reservation and check-in, and specially helped me upgrade to a splash room. The room is larger and the environment is bigger. Well, during the few days of staying at the hotel, I will communicate with me on WeChat every day about the service, which is very caring. On the last day, due to my own reasons, I accidentally left my jacket on the beach lounger of the hotel. When I found out that several hours had passed, I contacted Miss Sissy with the mentality of trying it out. After ten minutes, I replied and found it. Thank you so much for sending SF Express to me.
Finally, Le M√©ridien Hotel is the most comfortable and caring hotel I have stayed in Hainan for so many years. Every waiter will greet warmly and smile, making every guest who comes on vacation feel happy! Looking forward to meeting Amy again!

Knowing that we are two adults and one small in each room, he upgraded us to a parent-child room for free, and gave us a child's breakfast. Then he said the room and said again. Big and spacious, although the front desk waited for a while to check in, but I was willing to wait! Because of the long drive, I went to the SPA when I waited for the room, which was great. Then I said that the hotel's Horizon Restaurant will be a bit disappointing. There are not many dishes, and many dishes are messed up, and it feels not worth the price. However, the service attitude of the whole hotel is very good. When we left, the little brother Chen Daoyou from the concierge depar**ent came to help us with our luggage, loaded it into the car, chatted with us to introduce the surrounding games, and gave us a few bottles of mineral water when we left. I feel that all the services encountered in the hotel will make people feel that it is worth the money. The beach is a private beach, and the sand is very fine and fine! It's a pity that I didn't see the sunrise and sunset. The next time I go to Shimei Bay, this is definitely the first choice.

Because we were traveling with four elderly people and a baby under two years old this time, Cara, the manager on duty at the front desk, specially helped us upgrade from a family room and a twin room to an adjacent garden pool room, and took the initiative to ask if we needed it The bed surround is really sweet. The room is big enough, although the swimming pool is small and very clean (you can see that the water is in a state of circulation all the time) the toiletries are all from Jurlique, if not enough, the cleaning staff will send them immediately.
The hotel also has a wealth of children's programs. Unfortunately, the baby is too young to participate in it. I look forward to participating in the next time I come to play with my father.

A few of us originally booked a homestay. We didn‚Äôt expect the environment of the homestay to be different from what we imagined. We immediately opened Ctrip without saying a word. The nearby Le M√©ridien just happened to have a villa room for two nights. The price is a bit expensive, but After all, to send away the opportunity of 2021 to meet 2022, there is only one time in a lifetime, and it must be perfect. Book a room immediately and move into a comfortable small villa.

Amy‚Äôs entire experience is perfect. The best experience is actually Amy‚Äôs caring service. In this New Year‚Äôs Eve campaign, the person I must thank is Dolly, the duty manager of Amy. Dolly is really super caring. She is attentive everywhere. , Let our three-day stay experience feel like returning home. From the arrangement of the New Year‚Äôs Eve activities to the various facilities in the room, we can imagine it for us one step in advance. It is really the savior of our New Year‚Äôs Eve activities!

Another person to thank is the restaurant manager of Horizon. The three of us have various requirements for food, and it is really embarrassing for him and the kitchen, but the New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner is really rich and delicious (without editing). The service is in place, let the three of us have a happy New Year's Eve dinner!

This New Year's Eve event was a great success! 2022 will be smooth, healthy and happy!

Thank you all the staff of Amy! You have worked hard~^_^

Whether it is a sports enthusiast, a traveler or a food and landscape enthusiast, Le M√©ridien will not let you down.

The hot spring eggs and Wanning powder in the restaurant are delicious, and the breakfast is super! The rooms have a Balinese style, the a**osphere is deep, luxurious and restrained, the service is meticulous, modest and gentle, and white seagulls fly by from time to time.

msg:There are very few overall hotel options in Shimei Bay. Westin and Le M√©ridien hesitated for a long time. After staying in, I really feel good and it is a recommended hotel.
Stay: The hotel‚Äôs parent-child room is very suitable for our family of three with a (10-year-old) child. The room is big enough, facing the swimming pool, although it lives on the second floor, there is no sea, the view of the swimming pool is not bad. With a 2m king-size bed and a sofa bed, a family of three can sleep comfortably. The room is large enough to move the tables and chairs on the balcony into the room and it is not too crowded. In the evening, the family happens to play board games in the room, drink coconuts, and have a snack platter. The vacation life is really pleasant!
Eat: The hotel's Horizon Restaurant is really a surprise, the glass restaurant on the beach, the scenery is invincible! On the day of the big storm, sitting in the glass room listening to soothing music, watching the changing situation, drinking afternoon tea, it was really enjoyable.
Service: The housekeeper (Takuya) contacted me the arrival time and room requirements the day before I checked in, and sent me a map of the hotel and recommendations of surrounding attractions. Knowing that I was taking my child, I also sent me the daily program list and custody service introduction of the hotel children's club in advance. Very caring and I am very grateful. [Rose] (My child was older and took part in a paddle board activity. The scenery was good, but I felt that the children were 5 or 6-year-old children, so I refused to go in the follow-up. [Naughty])
Overall: highly recommended! Especially for friends who love surfing, this place is really great! When I met a friend, she highly recommended the coach here. Her child learns to surf here and can stand on the board in an afternoon! It seems to teach well!

msg:I saw a superb hotel on Little Sweet Potato, and I booked it when I came to Hainan this time. The overall sense of experience really surprised me, a perfect experience.

üöó Transportation: We drove there after we finished playing in Houhai Village. We went all the way to the highway, and it didn't take long to get to the hotel after getting off the highway. On the way off the highway, we gradually began to feel like a holiday. But it seems a bit inconvenient if you don‚Äôt drive yourself, there is no public transportation at the door


üîîService: I thought that the service of this kind of Internet celebrity tourist hotel would not be very good, but I didn't expect it to subvert my stereotype at all. Three days before the check-in, the young lady in charge of the hotel called Zoe in advance. After adding WeChat, young lady, what's the guide around the hotel? What's delicious and fun? The hotel facilities are all sent to me, super invincible intimate. I will also confirm in advance before arriving, and I will also ask check-in feedback after arriving at the store. What help is needed is the first time to solve. The experience is superb and feels at home. There are also the little brothers at the front desk and the concierge. I don‚Äôt know what their names are, but I am very impressed. They are super enthusiastic and quick to work. There is no such thing as the staff who stayed at the hotel in Shanghai Hangzhou to complete the guest's account like a task. . Comfortable all the way

üçÉEnvironment: I don‚Äôt have to say about the environment. I totally love this environment in the photos posted by others. Films are very popular in various places, especially the swimming pool and beach and the horizon restaurant. I really didn't expect a film to be released even in a typhoon, Zanni. The hotel seems to have two outdoor public swimming pools, one is opposite the lobby, the heated swimming pool, swimming there is really a good mood, swimming while watching the sea. The other one was in the residential area. When we arrived, the pool happened to be having a foam party. I really liked it.

(Ps. Picture one and two is the hotel package booked on Ctrip that includes travel shots, my little brother‚Äôs technology is great üëç

The typhoon just happened to make landfall in these two days. The weather was not so good, and it was too cold to do a lot of things I wanted to do. Come again after the New Year, hehe

Thanks to the steward Stephan for his diligence. I called in the first day to ask about the check-in time and the needs of the room. During the stay, I was very patient and actively assisted with any inquiries, which is great üëç

The hotel has a very good environment, with its own beach; the rooms are relatively large and comfortable, with a 24-hour temperature-controlled swimming pool and fitness center; the horizon restaurant next to the beach has breakfast until 11 o'clock, with a complete range of categories and a great dining environment!

I will still choose Amy next time!

It is said that live TV can only be watched on the second floor and above! Furthermore, although the room is big but there is no bedside table, the TV has to be tilted to watch! There is no magnifying glass on the dressing table, some parking lots are far from the lobby, and the roads are bumpy. You have to call the front desk yourself to help you! I think it's not caring enough, decisively check out the next day and change hotels!

The entire hotel is fully equipped and the experience of staying in is completely relaxing. It is also very convenient to surf nearby Shimei Bay. Before staying at the hotel One day the hotel front desk Stephen took the initiative to call me to ask about the room check-in arrangements and the arrival time. Because it was the first time I came to Wanning and he was not familiar with local travel, Stephen recommended me his own play guide. He was very careful, and finally One morning when I went out to sea and got seasick, Stephen arranged for me a motion sickness medicine from a nearby pharmacy. The owner of the nearby pharmacy took the initiative to drive to the hotel. Overall, it is a hotel with a very good service and experience. The price is also very cost-effective. Many people will look for this travel shot in this hotel. Finally, I will talk about the lack of the hotel: 1. I saw that the hotel was renovated in 18 years, and some facilities in the hotel room are a bit aging, such as the bed. When the cabinet next to it is turned on, the electricity switch is turned on. When the cabinet is opened, the cable is suddenly pulled and the whole room is turned off. 2. The TV in the hotel is similar to the Xiaomi TV. Many TV programs require the purchase of TV memberships to watch the programs. Although I am not here to watch TV üòÇ 3. There are not many types of breakfast and dinner horizon restaurants in the hotel, and there are not many on it. The choices are still relatively limited. It is recommended that the hotel can strengthen the meal 4. Hotel villas The privacy of the separate swimming pool is generally done, and the edge of the swimming pool is enclosed by vegetation. Before leaving the hotel, the front desk also asked me about my staying experience and suggestions. It is worth mentioning that the hotel patiently followed the customer‚Äôs suggestions. It is also very convenient for this hotel to go to Sanya. There is a free fixed shuttle bus to Sanya Duty Free Shop every day. It's really convenient! Overall, the experience of staying in is very good, next time I will bring my parents with me

What was even more surprising was that I upgraded my luxurious splashing room, which made my entire journey full of surprises and expectations!
Arrived at the hotel late, the hotel also arranged a fruit plate to entertain us, thinking it was late, we tried its Korean restaurant, the price is very high.

During the three days in Sanya, I almost went to Riyue Bay to surf and enjoy the food and leisure facilities of Le M√©ridien Shimei Bay!

Such a 5-star hotel really has a bad experience
Is it the bad economy? So all the services can't keep up?
1. When I checked in, I booked for 2 nights and said that I would upgrade the room breakfast to another restaurant, and then I stayed for another night. I went to have breakfast the next day, but I was kicked out, saying that if the breakfast was in another restaurant, if I wanted to use it in the original restaurant The breakfast had to pay the price difference, but it came out halfway through the meal, so embarrassing to death, the front desk didn't say anything when we continued to stay.
2. The cleaning of the room and guest room is too simple, just make a bed and replenish daily necessities.
3. You can't order food to your room. You have to wait 50 minutes to eat at the restaurant, and the restaurant waiter appears every 20 minutes.
4. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs facilities and environment. Except for the housing area, the whole hotel may be the swimming pool, and then there is a seaside restaurant that thinks it is positioned as a high-end restaurant, and not everyone can receive it. Then there is no more, there is simply no other place to play.
5. I don't know where the good reviews of the hotel come from. I really don't recommend this hotel.

On the third day, I changed to Le M√©ridien. The styles of the two stores are not the same. , I prefer this kind of distinctive hotel, and my wife prefers the modern style of Westin (?). Because I stayed in a sea-view room for two consecutive days, Amy chose the garden-view room (I'm afraid I might vomit when I stay in a sea-view room for several days later). Amy Zoe contacted me two days in advance and provided a check-in guide very carefully. The sanitation of the hotel is to the extreme, and I even saw workers brushing the floor with toothbrushes... The sea view swimming pool is good, and you can directly see Kajing Island (however, I have been playing in the water these days and I don‚Äôt want to play. I just made some fish with my wife. It‚Äôs good if it‚Äôs free.) Like Westin, Le M√©ridien also has its own Silver Beach. The sand and sea water of the two hotels have relatively good quality. I think Amy's food is better than Westin. The Chinese restaurant's eastern goat and flower maw chicken are worth eating.

When booking a hotel, I hesitated again and again. I wanted to stay at Le M√©ridien for two days. I stayed next door for two days and placed two orders specially. After check-in, the experience was perfect. A fulfilling and happy family time, I decided to give my baby a birthday at Le M√©ridien‚Äôs Horizon Restaurant~ It turns out that the decision is extremely correct, eliminating the need for toiling, avoiding the gathering of people, reducing the troubles of repeated decision-making, and gaining physical and mental relaxation and mood. Delightful.
In addition, the baby at Le M√©ridien participates in various activities organized by hotels every day. . . I feel that children of all ages can find activities they like~
I would like to thank the manager Ivy for taking care of us. Ivy's timely care when the baby is uncomfortable makes us feel at ease. Ivy helps to plan and coordinate the baby's birthday dinner, so that we can truly feel the ease and leisure brought by the holiday. I also want to thank the many staff of the hotel for working together to provide us with effective protection~
I have already planned the next trip to Amy Hahaha.

It can be said that the trip to Wanning ended successfully. The room type is a luxurious garden splash room. The 2 single beds are super big when put together. There is also a small splash pool, which is very suitable for children to play. The heated swimming pool of the hotel is just right in this season. Swimming will not be cold and the breakfast tastes good. , There is a CD operation, but unfortunately, I still overestimated my appetite, which is a little wasteful ü§£. The quality of sleep in Le M√©ridien‚Äôs night was particularly good. I was woken up without a dream, and the corridor was very quiet in the morning. It is worth mentioning that it is a veteran five-star hotel, and the service has nothing to say. From the warm reception of the little brother Stephen at the front desk when he checked in to the umbrella when he left, he left a very good vacation memory. I like the quietness of the beach behind the hotel in the evening, and the sound of the waves slaps. The next time I take my parents on vacation, I want to try the selected garden room. The private swimming pool looks quite big. You can't go wrong when choosing Amy~

The last time I came to Shimei Bay in Hainan was already within the itinerary. I didn‚Äôt go there when I didn‚Äôt have enough time. Recently, I was not able to go by the major variety shows. This time I also planned it. There have been news of typhoons passing before the trip. , I'm very worried. It was originally a surfing resort, but it's very difficult to encounter a typhoon again ü§£
We drove all the way east from Haikou to Sanya. It was still raining when we departed from Haikou. It might be a bit greasy to eat morning tea in the morning, and we ate seafood at noon. When we were half an hour away from the hotel, we had gastroenteritis. After finally carrying it to the hotel, I got collapsed and it hurts so much that I couldn‚Äôt stand up. The two young ladies on duty in the lobby called for a nurse and pushed the wheelchair. They took water and looked for medicine. , I didn‚Äôt leave until I was safe enough to sleep, and later I called to confirm the situation. It was really heartwarming. There was also Stephen the housekeeper, who was responsive to every request. Although there were episodes in the journey, I was delayed a lot by myself. Time, but also gained more love, thank you so muchüôè
Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained, the rooms are spacious, there are two swimming pools, and a private beach. It rained for the two days when I came to Hainan, and the sun was out on the day I was staying at Le M√©ridien, early in the morning. Seeing such a beautiful sea view, my stomach doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore. The most important thing is that the service is online.
There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the quality is very online, freshly squeezed juice, freshly ground coffee, refreshing and refreshing, dessert bread, Hainanese noodles are praised üëçüèºThe main horizon restaurant has a beautiful view and a good mood üòÜ
Thanks again to the staff of Amy, you are so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Fortunately, the hotel‚Äôs bed is very comfortable. I lie flat every day and go out for food when it doesn‚Äôt rain. The hotel‚Äôs butler, Zoe, contacted me the day before I checked in and informed me of various tips. Any reservations or questions are always answered. And the reply was quick, thank you very much! The hotel‚Äôs Horizon Restaurant has a very good evening buffet. I didn‚Äôt want to go out for food on the last day before I left. I chose this place. 398 people are still very cost-effective. There are many choices of dishes and the sea view. It is worth trying! However, Amy‚Äôs hardware is a bit worse. There is no USB port in the room. The TV is also very small. It is far away from the bed and can‚Äôt cast screens. I can only watch the mobile phone for 5 days in the room. The pillows are too soft. The cervical spine is uncomfortable after sleeping. Maybe I am used to sleeping on a hard pillow. As a veteran hotel attendant is still very nice and enthusiastic, but the hardware must keep up with the times! I hope I will have the opportunity to stay next time and it will be improved!

The hotel as a whole follows the Southeast Asian style, it can be simply said to be a resort hotel, not to mention the parent-children~~ The hotel environment is still good, and the price is worthy

msg:I stayed in Wanning for a short time for half a day, and I felt very comfortable and cozy. I was thinking of taking my baby to Wanning for a parent-child trip. It just happened that the children were on holiday during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and I took my parents to Wanning to relax. Hainan values the choice of hotels very much. The requirement is that the hotel has its own beach, swimming pool, and parent-child friendly. If you can launch various activities for children, it is the best choice for this trip! Many mothers have recommended Amy after looking for a guide, and the overall experience is really good! Worth coming again!

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel has its own beach, coconut trees, rich green plants, and the beautiful scenery is just a quick shot. Except for the hotel decoration is slightly old, it still does not affect the normal living and use, and as everyone said, there is still a Southeast Asian style. .

üöó Transportation: We rent a car and drive here. The parking lot is convenient and free, without scanning.


üßπHygienic: The overall is pretty good, the towels and bathrobes also look relatively new, and the children stay in the room without mosquitoes, which is very relieved.

üîîService: The most praiseworthy thing is the butler service. My butler is Cassie Xiaohan. Before I check in, I have communicated with the occupants by phone, and added WeChat to facilitate inquiries about various hotel services. If you want to know about parent-child activities, you can quickly contact someone , Because my mother gave the room a birthday decoration for her birthday, which made her very happy. There was also a gift of breakfast for an adult with the room, which was a surprise that was only discovered at the checkout! Parent-child activities are quite rich, the indoor environment is good, children and parents can spend in a more comfortable environment, and the staff are also very patient. In particular, his son named Survival in the Wilderness and Climbing the Coconut Tree, which received his super five-star praise! I was able to bring him experiences that he had never experienced before in these two activities. I was very surprised by the photos sent by the teacher by drilling wood to make fire and setting up a tent in the field. Fortunately, only my son experienced it that day, and it became his exclusive VIP course! The coach for climbing coconut trees made him climb three times, one block at a time, but it was a pity that he didn't pick coconuts. It was really hard to pick. These are activities that are hard to experience on weekdays. The coach is also very nice and patient. Playing with sand on the beach, walking in the waves, and swimming in the pool are all activities that children never get tired of. The two-day itinerary was all soaked in the hotel, and the children still felt uncomfortable, shouting that they would come again next time! Bring your baby to Amy, a child-friendly hotel!

It can be said that staying at Le M√©ridien Hotel is the wisest decision I made during this trip. First of all, it doesn't go out when it rains, but the hotel arranges a full day of parent-child activities, and the son doesn't feel bored at all. 2. The catering facilities are complete. The afternoon tea in our big bird cage is only 138, and the coffee can be refilled, which surprised me. 3. Stephen, the housekeeper, came to say hello every morning and evening, and arranged my life for the two days clearly and heart-warming. 4. The hotel parking lot is free, which provides convenience for self-driving passengers. 5. If you want to buy some snacks, there is a China Resources Supermarket next to you where you can buy everything.

msg:The hotel facilities are indeed a bit old, but the caring service is enough to make up for it, and it does not affect the mood of the holiday. We just caught up with the typhoon day, heavy winds and heavy rains, all activities were cancelled, and there was no way to play in the water or swim. Because the hotel was connected to the outdoors, the corridors and aisles were wet everywhere. The room is very large, the layout and comfort are still very good, the service is very caring and meticulous, the customer service manager Chen Xia added my Wechat one day in advance to communicate any special needs. I happened to meet her when I checked in. I was pregnant. Mom, very friendly to children. Room service is also very timely. If there is a chance, consider going again when the weather is better.

Because I took the children by myself, during this period many things do not need to be done by myself, which really saves a lot of worry. The hotel also has many parent-child activities to participate in, and the scenery is also very beautiful. All in all it was a great experience. Amy and Westin personally recommend Amy, because there is still a sense of gap after moving to Westin the next day. Although there are hotel butlers, Amy‚Äôs service is even better. Isn't it just a fun and worry-free coming out to play?

The 360 surround wash of the bath! marvelous! If you are good, you can't finish it! Generally speaking, it is worth the experience!

msg:I happily went to Wanning for a vacation. On the last day of my trip, I chose the so-called online celebrity hotel Le M√©ridien. In the end, he fell severely by the hotel pool! It was all because the stone slabs of the hotel passage were loose, and the ditch was barely covered. People stepped on it and broke, and the whole leg fell into the pit!
After the incident, my family members asked the front desk for ice cubes and medicine kits. All kinds of items arrived late; the medical staff were quite conscientious to help. The representative manager sent by the hotel stood and pressed the mobile phone the whole time, saying no apology, no apology. Promptly express to the solution, but also said that I am not afraid of pain and very strong? ? ? ? ?
It was noon until we had to check out to catch the flight, and my husband urged them to reply, and the hotel manager came to tell us that next time we will stay in the hotel, we will be upgraded from a standard room to a first-class apar**ent!
It was incredible. We refused because we fell down because of a problem with the facility, but we were still thinking about letting customers spend a second time!
Until now, a few days have passed, this matter has not been handled properly, and the deposit I paid has not been returned yet!
The fall is not a big deal, but the attitude of the hotel is unpleasant. Today is a young and middle-aged man who has fallen and there is no big problem. What if it is an elderly person? What if it is a child? Everyone is dragging their families and looking forward to traveling, but Le M√©ridien has never met the service standards that a five-star hotel should have.

Speaking of Le M√©ridien, first of all, the exclusive beach is very clean, and you can catch crabs at night. The accommodation is also very high-end, and every service staff encountered on the road has a super good attitude.
The second is dining. Le Meridien has four restaurants, Chinese restaurant, Horizon restaurant, Korean restaurant and western restaurant. I tried three and were very satisfied.
The key to the most pleasant surprise is that the travel shots sent by Amy are so good-looking (refer to Figure 78), which completely exceeded expectations. It feels like a honeymoon or a family outing, you can spend a day at Le M√©ridien, with swimming pools, beaches, surfing, and food!

üöó Transportation: Located in the core area of Shimei Bay, opposite to Jiajing Island, connected to Westin, there is an M1 coffee factory nearby, which is very convenient for self-driving.

üßπ Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, there is nothing to choose, including the aunts who do sanitation are greeted and sent with smiles. Except for rainy days, the corridor has a bit of water in the road area, which is understandable.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel has been open for a while, the decoration style of the lobby is a little old, but the room is particularly good when you enter it, and your mood improves. The room is not only large but also well decorated, Chinese style. The pool in the room is water-circulating. The public area of the hotel is very garden-like and comfortable as a whole, and the highlight of the horizon restaurant by the sea is chilly.

üîîService: praise bella's service, considerate and meticulous, pay attention to the whole process, and send a gift. The young lady in the lobby bar is also very nice, helping to solve problems flexibly. Directly add points to the service.

üí∞Price: 1200 splashing room with double breakfast + afternoon tea (it‚Äôs delicious!), surfing experience and travel shooting, although I didn‚Äôt use it, it‚Äôs a bit cost-effective, and I‚Äôm willing to give five-star reviews based on cost performance and service , But there are also comments that I want to mention. One is because the hotel lobby is still a bit old, giving people a bad first impression (understandable), and the other is that the check-in encounters the team and waited for a long, long time, and the team was really noisy at that time. It‚Äôs tired and sleepy late at night, and it‚Äôs so quarrelsome that your head splits. This is not the hotel‚Äôs fault, but it is recommended that individual travelers and the team handle them separately. If it weren't for Bella's caring service and good rooms, points should be deducted for the check-in experience. In short, the price is very high, and I would recommend friends to live!

My housekeeper Steven Takuya and I were assigned to each other. Although Steven took a vacation in those few days, he still provided a very considerate service. As small as the hotel did not have cotton pads, he asked his colleagues to bring them to me. All the rooms in a small "bathroom" were completed one by one. Even if I went to get a haircut, I didn't forget to report to me for fear that I would not be able to reply in time. Just for this sincerity, if you don't have money, you have to come and live!
üßπHygienic: still meets the standards of a five-star hotel
üöó Transportation: A good environment will definitely not be too convenient for transportation, but it is quite convenient for taxis and driving
üçÉEnvironment: There is nothing to say about the objective environment. The beach and the lobby are all online celebrity check-in places. The beach is shared with the Westin next door. There are not many people in this season, which is very cool.
  In any case, the Le M√©ridien in Shimei Bay is worth staying. Although it is true that some rooms are a bit old because of the age, but one thing is that the bedding is quite comfortable, I can't wait for a moment to leave. I brought my old mother to the parent-child tour, and the old mother was very happy visually.

The 24-hour hotel check-in system is really too user-friendly. But there is also a small suggestion. The room can be equipped with a disposable toilet pad, and the small objects in the room can also be cleaned up. In general, it is a perfect choice for a family hotel.

First of all, let me talk about the hotel environment: the hotel is very a**ospheric and the swimming pool is also very beautiful. I read the comments and said that the decoration of the hotel is a bit old, but it is not. Thin, comparable to the white sands of Long Beach.
Hotel breakfast: The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is located in the "Horizon" restaurant. The feeling and scenery are really great. Even if you are not outdoors, you can watch the sand and sea line up for breakfast. It feels really good. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is not available. Say a lot, but the taste is good, delicious, and delicate!
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs service: the hotel‚Äôs service is really great, especially the housekeeper Chen Xia. When he checked in at the hotel, he directly upgraded the room for us. At that time, the most common room was ordered, which directly upgraded our family. Pool room, the room comes with a small pool, the room is also very large, and there is a large sofa that can sleep one person. For a family like us with 14-year-old children, it is really perfect! Seeing that we took our 14-year-old child and offered us a breakfast, I was really touchedü•∞ü•∞
All in all, Le M√©ridien is definitely the first choice for Wanning. When you come to Wanning, you really have to choose Aimei to stay for 2 days without going out of the hotel at all, lying down and enjoying the sun!
When I finally left, I forgot the clothes. The hotel also took the initiative to call to inform them, and immediately helped mail them home!
The housekeeper Chen Xia is really a very caring and good girl. If you go to Wanning, you really have to choose Amy, and you won‚Äôt regret it.

„ÄêVilla Hotel„Äë
‚ô•Ô∏èAmy is highly recommended to me by a friend, no one, parent-child.
Children want to come to the beach during the summer vacation. After the epidemic, the first choice is a place with few people. Shimei Bay is so suitable. There is less people and sand, and Jiajing Island is also good. It is said that snorkeling on Kajing Island is good, you can get there in ten minutes, but unfortunately I didn't bring equipment, so I will come again next time. (P.S. At present, it takes 48 hours for nucleic acid to come to Hainan from other places)

üîîService: Special thanks to Vincent Liang, the housekeeper, for contacting me one day in advance to learn more about our needs, such as rooms with better views, children like digging sand and so on. After arriving at the store, a room with the best view has been arranged, and it is very convenient for dining, swimming, and digging. After staying for one night, I suddenly found that I was too close to the kitchen and the roadside, so the next day he took the trouble to help us upgrade a two-bedroom pool villa. During the stay, every little thing can be solved and arranged in time, and it will be returned to the child before leaving. Prepared a small gift, it can be said to be very hard.

In addition, room service is also in place, on call, and thoughtful arrangements. Because there are children staying in, I specially prepared children‚Äôs toiletries and bathrobes. The little yellow duck series are cute and lovely; the lady gave a set of Bulgari toiletries. The two bathrooms use the Julie Kou series. I also like it very much; I think it is a plate of fruit and a refrigerator soft drink every day for men. Hahahaha.

The surfing experience and afternoon tea provided by the reservation are great. It was not perfunctory because it was a gift. Surfing brother is very patient to guide the children to play, the afternoon tea restaurant staff learned that the child has a runny nose, initiative to deliver free ginger tea and so on...I was very moved.

In addition, the hotel‚Äôs Carton Metamorphosis and Beye Planet‚Äôs activities are very rich. Although my child is a little naive in many activities at the age of ten, some of them can still participate. The most important thing is that they treat each activity with their heart, even if there is only one child in the off-season. .

üçÉEnvironment: The overall Southeast Asian style, the parent-child hotel picture is a warm and comfortable, walking out is full of scenery, there are also frangipani, coconut, and small squirrels everywhere. The swimming pool is designed to face the sea and Kajeong Island, as well as the Korean restaurant and the horizon buffet restaurant, all of which are sea views.

üßπHygienic: The public swimming pool and the villa swimming pool are very clean. Because the balcony is particularly humid in the rainy season, we generally do not open it. When we come back from playing in the sand, there is more or less sand in the room. If there is a small water tank at the door of the villa yard. It's better to punch your feet. I read the comments and said that this place is too old. I think it is acceptable. After all, the wooden furniture is easy to show old. At present, the hotel is also being renovated during the off-season. I hope it will be better next time.

üöó Transportation: After arriving at Sanya Phoenix Airport, the hotel will pick you up, and you will arrive in one and a half hours. Because Shimei Bay is biased, Boao Airport will be closer.

Full score for experience, full score for service
The customer service staff contacted the day before check-in to ask about the arrival time and whether there are children. The first time you can join the group, you can make an appoin**ent for daily children‚Äôs activities
After the check-in arrived early, the hotel staff gave a waiting ticket to change coffee, and quickly cleaned the room to move in as soon as possible. The most happiest thing is that the customer service staff helped to upgrade the playing room
The child is happy to live in
There are pools ranging from 0.5m to 1.5m to meet the needs of children and adults. Each pool has free swimming rings and floating boards. If you have to pick out the shortcomings, I hope there will be water slides in the future. Haha
The breakfast is delicious, the variety is served quickly and I am very satisfied
A little regret is that the buffet dishes in Feiyue Horizon Restaurant are a little bit small, and the crab speed can be calculated by the hour...
Also, the bed is too soft...a bit tired after sleeping for a long time
But the overall experience is very good, especially the customer service staff contacted before check-in really helped a lot, and all questions were answered at the first time
I will come to Wanning next time and choose Amy

The hotel has two swimming pools. The lagoon swimming pool is very suitable for children to play. There are various depths. On Thursdays, there was also a bubble machine activity. The children were very happy.
The Korean restaurant and the Horizon buffet restaurant in the hotel taste good. They will not step on thunder. I am tired of eating seafood from the farm outside for a few days. Both of them are quite good.
All in all, the few days in Le M√©ridien was very satisfied.

The beach is also quite big, bigger than Westin. Westin does not have an infinity pool. Although the rooms are a bit old, the hotel also offers surfing experience activities, fish spas and many other activities. Personally think it is a hotel worth staying in. The service is also very good, especially the butler Amber is very attentive. He called me one day in advance and upgraded my room and gave me a late check-out. The service is really good.

msg:I decided to fly here for a short vacation with my baby. I used to be my first choice in Sanya, but this time I came here unintentionally. The result is really pleasant! First of all, the hotel environment and surrounding environment are really more close to nature than the Haitang Bay side. It feels like being in Thailand! Haitang Bay is too commercial, I personally don't like it very much. The sand on the beach is very soft, there are few gravel, and the feet are not very pierced. Second, the room is really too comfortable. In the middle of the night, I flew to my small courtyard to take a swim and put the baby to sleep on the first floor to continue watching TV. Supper is very suitable for family trips! The most touching thing is that I took the kids to play in the sand on the beach at night. It was a little late at ten o'clock and the lights were all turned off, but when we saw that we were still playing in the hotel, I turned on the headlights for us. It was too warm next time on vacation. Come and play for a few more days~

There are a lot of sea****, but the water quality is very good and clear. Children can stay in the hotel. Play for a day! However, the Kajing Island recommended by the hotel is not good for group tours. It is unprofessional, which caused us to miss Kajing Island. Other aspects are good. The rice in the restaurant on the third floor of the hotel is delicious. The taste of dishes varies from person to person. The sea-view restaurant is very nice. It‚Äôs very comfortable to have afternoon tea there. Hainan is too hot in July and the summer peak period. I suggest you avoid it.

Haikou Meilan landed and drove south for more than two hours to a secluded and beautiful hotel. If you arrive in Sanya, it seems that the hotel has a pick-up service, you can contact early. The road to the island is very good, the blue sky and white clouds are blooming, let go and sing, and the mood is full.
The swimming pool Xiaobieye was set, and the friends upgraded the seaside swimming pool Dabieye, the scenery is invincible, and it is really beautiful to take pictures.
The swimming pool in the room is very clean, and staff come to clean it every day. The hotel service is very warm and caring, and can help guests solve many problems.
Hotel activities are also very rich, especially baby activities, many parent-child activities from morning to night to satisfy the children, exhausting their energy, and there are many activities for adults. Staying for a few days, I am very happy and satisfied every day, very suitable for a holiday. The hotel restaurant is also good, if you don't want to go out, you can solve it in the hotel.
Excellent experience, recommended by perfect scores. Named and praised the hotel receptionist butler Xiao Cai [Candy][Candy]

msg:I have lived in Haitang Bay for three consecutive years, so I want to change my taste this time. Taking into account the distance between the hotel and the airport, the holiday became 7 days and 6 nights. Next, let‚Äôs talk about the strategy of staying in the hotel:

Transportation: The hotel provides a free shuttle bus, but it will stop at the duty-free shop halfway, so the time will be slightly longer. If you choose a hotel bus, it is best to reserve a 2-hour journey. The bus needs to be reserved in advance.

Eat: Shimei Bay is not as well-developed as Haitang Bay. There are only a few restaurants that can be selected. I don't want to eat it after a few times. If you drive by yourself, it is more convenient and you can go out to eat. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is recommended here, which is slightly more expensive but large in quantity. There is a set meal in the reviews, but it is actually ok. We ate it four times in a row~~There is a reason for our own laziness, but 90% of it tastes really good. The children ate very happily. In addition, the online celebrity restaurant Horizon is only suitable for those who like the environment, not for food. Everyone weighs it by yourself, do you want to check in. The hotel‚Äôs buffet dinner, only Horizon Restaurant. Buffet breakfast room, only offer breakfast buffet.

Play: There are a lot of activities for children, divided into two venues: Le Meridien Club and Bei Ye Planet. There are charges and free activities, parents need to ask in advance. Beiye Planet provides chargeable hosting services. Parents who want to stay in the hotel can take care of them for 1-2 days.
Many water activities are charged. Guests who stay in will be given a 10-minute land surfing coupon, which will be charged later. There are also snorkeling, jet skiing, surfing, etc., suitable for older children who are bold or a little basic. There are related stores in the hotel where you can make an appoin**ent.
There are not many people on the beach, so children who like to dig sand can dig every day. There are two outdoor swimming pools, one of which is suitable for children. No indoor swimming pool.

Live: The overall style is Southeast Asia, more like a hotel in Thailand. Equipment maintenance is good. We stayed in the paddling room, which was okay. The waiter will do his best to clean every day, which is very hard. After cleaning, management staff came to inquire about the cleaning situation, and the hotel rooms responded quickly. The drinks in the small refrigerator are not free, and there is free flow of water. The most surprising thing is that there are many big snails in the hotel! ! ! They all ran out after the rain, which is not available in Haitang Bay.

The day before check-in, the hotel service staff SUNNY took the initiative to call and add WeChat to contact the guests and ask about their needs, which made people very happy. SUNNY beauty is basically responsive, like a housekeeper, thank you SUNNY!

The hotel is indeed old, a bit old, but the Southeast Asian style is originally woody, as long as the hygiene is good and the service is good, it can be covered up. The sanitation of the hotel is very good, the rooms are cleaned in time, and the daily supplies are actively supplemented with water. Especially the Beiye Planet Children‚Äôs Club in the hotel is definitely a lot of extra points for the hotel. There are too many activities every day. The free activities are full in one day, and the hosting of paid activities is to liberate parents. The teacher is very caring and encourages the children. The children like to go there for class. The teacher will also take pictures of Meimei and send it to the parents‚Äô circle of friends. It's really suitable for taking children! The only dissatisfaction is that a short girl at the breakfast line never took the initiative to organize the guests to line up. Those who talk about order register in the queue on her side, and those who don‚Äôt talk about order don‚Äôt care if they go straight in. Cause the people in line to be lonely? ? Hope it can be improved.

The hotel sits on a private beach, and there are several restaurants. The food is rich and varied, especially the horizon restaurant with a sea view. The view is very good. The key is that there are few people here! few people! few people! Make the holiday feel full!
Moreover, the hotel‚Äôs parent-child activities are rich and colorful, and they are arranged every day, which can definitely consume the super electric energy of the children. Parent-child travel is highly recommended! Of course, couples, family trips are also very suitable!
It‚Äôs a pity that I haven‚Äôt had time to experience surfing after I stayed for 3 nights this time, so I must go to experience it next time.

Two swimming pools can be rounded with bubbles, and there are places for artificial surfing. The breakfast is plentiful, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are very good, the price is slightly more expensive than the outside farmhouse but better than the convenience.

Shimei Bay Beach is very beautiful, suitable for surfing, snorkeling may be better for Sanya. After the typhoon, it cleared up and temporarily said that she would go to Kajing Island.

The two swimming pools of the hotel have free swimming rings for small friends. The middle one can see the beach and the scenery is invincible.

msg:When we checked in, we upgraded our room type from mountain view to sea view, but after we checked in, we found that we could not see the sea view on the fourth floor. Breakfast also helped us upgrade to the horizon restaurant. I rushed to play the project on the first day. I was anxious for breakfast, and I ate breakfast slowly the next morning. The variety of breakfast was not very rich, but it was exquisite. When looking at the scenery from the balcony, you will see little squirrels scurrying around on the coconut trees. The location of the hotel belongs to the seaside and the scenery is good, but it is not convenient to eat local snacks. It is a bit far away.

msg:The hotel is in the beautiful Shimei Bay, opposite the beach is Kajing Island. This time, taking advantage of the school's college entrance examination holiday, I took my baby out on a staggered trip. The manager Wu of the hotel has done a great job, and all kinds of careful and considerate arrangements made our journey full of surprises! We are two families staying for 4 nights. Miss Wu helped us upgrade the parent-child room for free; the last two breakfasts were also upgraded to the horizon restaurant. In short, I highly recommend staying at Le M√©ridien with beautiful scenery and first-class service!

msg:The environment of the hotel is quite good, the room can see the sea, but the room facilities are a bit old.
The variety of breakfast is not bad, but the sanitation is a bit inadequate, and the cups and plates are not very clean.
Coffee will be delivered when you check in. The voucher is placed on the bed of the room. We didn't know when we checked in and went to the reception to ask. Free coffee is provided in the lobby bar. The coffee is unexpectedly delicious and the milk foam is dense!
The sand on the beach is very fine, it is very comfortable to step on, the sea is super beautiful when the weather is good, and the photos are also very beautiful.
The feature of this hotel should be parent-child activities. During the stay, I can feel the staff bring the children to engage in various activities.

msg:I booked a 3-bedroom villa and stayed for two nights. 1. I didn't take the initiative to notify the clothes when I left the room. I told the hotel to send it to me by express, and I didn't let the express company send it as soon as possible, which caused trouble for the trip. 2. Check-out procedures After completing the procedure, the identity information was not withdrawn for several hours, which caused the hotel to be unable to check in for the next part of the itinerary, and informed Le M√©ridien Hotel to withdraw the identity information. affect travel mood
