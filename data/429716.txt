At reception when we ask about it we have been told first that our room was not the one in the picture, than that other room were all busy, even if it was still possible to book other rooms, than that the apartment was bigger, like it was a plus and at the end that it was impossible for them to upload pictures of different apartment.
It was cold due to not very well isolated windows (heather was on), bit old .

msg:This hotel is in a great location, and breakfast is pretty nice. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room had a well-equipped small kitchen area. Highline restaurant is really nice.

A few downsides:
1. We stayed here in the spring (May), when the weather was pretty warm, and they were turning their air conditioning off in the rooms every day from 8pm to 10am. This means we were a bit hot at night. They provided a fan, but it was still warm. This is clearly just a cost-cutting measure but they should adjust when the weather gets warm. And many guests may like to sleep in cooler temperatures even when the weather is not that warm outside.
2. Their hotel was pretty full for the holiday, so they ran out of extra blankets. We had our kids with us and paid for an extra bed, so we were expecting to be able to get blankets from the hotel but couldn't do so (since the room was so warm, though, we just got an extra sheet and did okay with that.
3. The description of the executive studio room says it has a sofa. We thought one of our kids could sleep on it. But it is not a sofa, it is just an armchair, so no one can sleep on it.
4. The first night we stayed there, I think there was a party going on in Highline restaurant in the hotel and the music was very loud. We were 14 floors above the restaurant but could still hear the bass coming through, which was annoying and made it difficult to go to sleep.

msg:The best things about this hotel is that Highline is in the same building, the pool was lovely, and it's very central. However the AC was on boiling hot and couldn't be adjusted because it's central heating. This really made our stay miserable, it is now Spring and the weather was very warm the entire time, so the AC needs to be adjusted to cooler air. The room is also smaller tha expected and needs an update to more modern facilities. There were stains on the walls and shower curtains. The front desk staff seemed to be helpful but would also seemingly ignore some issues or requests. For instance, we could not connect to the WiFi and they weren't very helpful with that. We also waited about  30 minutes to get water to the room from the front desk. Overall, we didn't enjoy our stay and hope they can fix these issues.

One minor feedback is about bathtub, I found the shower water was easy to come out of the bathtub even with shower curtain. So I had to use couple of towels to prevent water being further spread out in restroom.

Overall great stay and I’d highly recommend.

There was no enthusiasm at all at the front desk, and the check-in experience was very poor. However, the cleaning lady was very nice.
The Wi-Fi basically didn't work and couldn't be connected at all. This is really surprising for a hotel of this level.
I don't know where the place is being renovated and it's very noisy in the morning. I blame Ctrip for not reminding me when I made the reservation.
The hotel is old, but it is well maintained and the rooms are average.
The business center is very good, just use the computer if you need it.
Breakfast is semi-buffet, but there is not much to eat physically and mentally.
Although the room is old, it is well maintained.

msg:Because it is an old hotel, I don't have high expectations. The advantage is that it has a kitchen, so it is easier to prepare meals for a baby. The location is in the city center business district and convenient for travel. The front desk staff and concierge service are quite satisfactory, and the aunts and uncles who deliver water and clean the room are commendable for their smiles! The most unreasonable thing is that the breakfast for two people who added more than 100 yuan to the room price turned out to be a semi-buffet breakfast, which only included Western-style lettuce, mini tomatoes, cucumber slices, Western-style ham, and salami sausage, which were sliced ​​as thin as cicada wings and slightly rolled up. I ordered cheese slices with dried edges (you can read the text through them when you put them on a book)... It’s self-service, and you can only order 2 other items, such as “one fried dough stick, one cup of soy milk” and “one egg, two sticks” "bacon", "a scrambled egg, two triangular sandwiches" and so on, so little, not enough to eat at all! The most unacceptable thing was that not only was there no Lantern Festival on New Year’s Day, but I also saw a fly feasting on the fat ones in Salami and Park Ham, which was very off-putting! I told the waiter that there were flies, but he just took away the plate without even a word of apology. After a while, he brought out another plate. God knows if it was the original plate. It was really unbelievable!

This room type is very practical and comfortable. There are two super large beds. People live comfortably, and the price is excellent, and the equipment is complete. The location is next to Hong Kong Square. It is too convenient to take a minute or two for a minute or two. It is too convenient! My parents came to Shanghai for the second time. They said that this time it was more comfortable than a high -end hotel. There were separate living rooms, kitchens, two toilets, and there were no rushing people. I am willing to live in Estee Pavilion!

It is one step away from the subway station. It is also very convenient to walk to Xintiandi. There are several connected parks around and the landscaping is very good. Great, hikers like us can walk right through the park to People’s Square. The hotel's hygiene is also very good. The breakfast is delicious. You can choose Chinese or Western style. My favorite is the fragrant chicken porridge and vegetable blueberries. Especially River at the front desk and all the staff at the concierge made us feel at home. They were always there to bring comfort and safety to our stay. We look forward to staying again!

1. The room is well-organized and spotless, making people feel very comfortable.
2. There is no dust on the floor, and the furniture is wiped clean, making people feel at ease to stay.
3. The bed sheets and quilts are clean and tidy, and the towels and bath towels are changed and washed in time, eliminating the worries when checking in.

I went to bed at 9 o'clock, but from 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock in the morning, there was a crazy woman next door screaming, sometimes hahahahaha, sometimes ah ah ah, and she was trampoline and sofa! I was woken up abruptly! I heard the loud communication, but I continued to make all kinds of noises! I couldn't get through the phone feedback, and ran down in the middle of the night. The front desk staff had to temporarily give Zhang another room to rest, which caused me to stay up all night. I went out to do things early in the morning without any energy. I came back at noon to check out and change to a nearby andaz! It really pissed me off! Because of this incident, I am very happy in all aspects! In addition, there is really nothing to eat for breakfast. It is a single-order system, and no one is limited to ordering 2 varieties. One preserved egg and lean meat porridge, one fried toast, also counted as 2 varieties, drank a few mouthfuls of porridge and left! I will never stay in any Ascott hotel! I originally planned to stay for 12 days, and it was wise to book a day experience first! The soundproofing is so bad that you can hear everything the neighbors say, including when they answer the phone or turn on the light to go to the bathroom! It's crystal clear!

msg:The room is generally average, with obvious signs of use. The washbasin cannot store water. There are too many bubbles when hot water is used and it looks turbid (I don’t know if it is a pressurization problem). The stainless steel insulation bucket given has rust stains when I checked in, even the previous guest’s toothbrush. It was very inconvenient to have only one tissue box in the entire room except the bathroom before the suite was cleaned. Breakfast ordering mode, because the two adults and one child ordered three portions in the first round, and the children's portion was not served. I was not full and asked for another staple food. I was told that the previous order was already full, but I ordered it for the first time. At that time, the waiter said that it was not enough to eat and he could order more. Is it a training problem or something else? The menu was so simple and there was no choice and it was not enough to satisfy people. I'm sorry for the room fee of more than 1,000 yuan per night. Finally, I have to pay 160 yuan for parking for one day when I stay in a hotel... It's not that I can't afford it, but it's this level and there's no parking? ! Or do you want to make this money?

msg:I have stayed in this hotel three times. The location is very good, in the downtown area, and it is very convenient to go anywhere. I was very satisfied with the first two stays, but this time I have to complain. There was a long hair on the couch in front of the bed after I checked in. Was it left by the previous guest? It means that the cleaning is very sloppy. It is so obvious that it was not cleaned up. When I checked in for the first two times, I called the front desk to ask about parking. The front desk said that if there is a place to park at the door, it is free. If it is full, you have to park in the paid parking lot. This time, there is a place to park at the back door. When I parked, I didn’t say anything. I just asked if I was a guest. After I went out at night, I called twice in a row to ask me to move the car. When I went back in the middle of the night, I was asked to pay the parking fee, 100 yuan. After I paid the money through WeChat, it turned out that it was paid to an individual. Is this considered personal income? The next morning, after washing up, I called the front desk to ask for a care package. They said it would be delivered immediately. I called three times in a row, but it was not delivered for more than an hour...
The hotel should pay attention to the issues of hygiene and service. The hotel should clarify the issue of parking fees. It cannot make guests pay more money for no reason!

There are convenience stores and shopping malls immediately after you go down, but the things in the room are relatively old, and the hygiene level is mediocre. The floor feels a little sticky. Aging ￼, the most important thing is that the customer service attitude at the lobby counter is very poor. He seems a little impatient when asking him something. Ask other people! It's really outrageous! So the customer service of this hotel really disgusts me and I hope the hotel can improve it￼

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first. The location is very good. It is right next to the K11 shopping mall in Hong Kong Plaza. It is convenient to eat. There are few breakfast varieties but you can order a la carte. One person can choose two, and the taste is good.
Let's talk about the experience of staying, very dissatisfied! I have never encountered such poor service in a five-star hotel!
When checking in, a lady wearing glasses weighing about 150 catties at the front desk received her. She doesn’t judge people by their appearance. This image is really rare at the front desk, and their attitude is extremely poor throughout the whole process. Ask, for example, which floor is the breakfast on? If you don’t ask questions, there will be no active notification.
The more disgusting thing is in the back. At 7 o'clock in the morning, the whole family was sleeping soundly and was awakened by the alarm clock. It was a very complicated alarm clock. I didn't know how to turn it off. It kept ringing endlessly. I called the waiter and threw it in the corridor for them to pick it up , No one picked it up for a long time, and I was afraid of disturbing other guests, so I had to call and wait in the corridor. In the end, I was completely sleepless and had a headache all morning.
I didn’t receive an apology until I checked out. The front desk at the check-out was replaced by another girl with short hair. She still didn’t smile or apologize at all, and asked me over and over again, “Did you set it up yourself? Did your child set it up?” After I answered clearly that she hadn’t, I continued to ask me, “Think again, did the child move? Who set it up at home?” I don’t know such a complicated alarm clock, can the child do it? ! I suggest that there are mobile phones now, and this kind of tasteless alarm clock should not be placed in the room, or the waiter who tidies up the room should clear it after the previous guest has set it up. The lady at the front desk gave me two sentences at the end, "Foreigners like alarm clocks, so we have to configure them." I said, "Then anyone who needs to apply to the front desk can do so." , but this company has never seen a way of dealing with problems that is not acknowledging their faults and is often reasonable. The service level at the front desk is too poor!

In fact, the room is only about 40 square meters. The rest of the luggage room, kitchenette, and washing machine closet occupy 10 square meters. The facilities in the room are outdated. Very average, the hotel's breakfast is also disappointing, the price is ridiculously high, there is almost no star service, very mismatched.

Just the greasy smell of cooking oil and cooking fumes as soon as you enter the kitchen can kill you. The key point is that the smell seems to be coming from the air conditioning system, and it lingers all night long. It's really hard. The suite price of 1,500 on Saturday is not as good as the ordinary room in the surrounding Langham and Andaz. At least it's clean and doesn't smell like oil smoke. The experience is really bad.

Ordinary five-star hotels cannot open windows, so even if the price is similar to surrounding five-star hotels, I will basically stay at Ascott.
I am not very satisfied with the room assigned this time. There is an air conditioner or some kind of central control outside, and the noise is a bit loud. Secondly, I asked for sanitary products once, and the attitude at the front desk was always very good. Unfortunately, the attitude of the man who delivered the things was very bad. I hope the hotel can improve the service education of basic employees.

He didn't bring the original and showed the proof that he took with him normally. The staff at the front desk said no, and gave her the phone to click on the same interface... completely Not familiar with the business... My friend is from Cantonese. I asked her how to operate it, and she said she didn't know what system you have in Guangdong. I didn't know anything about it. She said that she only accepted the Yangtze River Delta region... Speechless, I don't know anything... At the end of the big night, I must I called the police, and the police came to let me register... This Chris employee has a bad attitude and is very unprofessional. Fortunately, the lobby manager Ethen came to coordinate. This employee means that customers outside the Yangtze River Delta will not be accepted. ...Ah sir said that he has never encountered such a thing... It's so weird that a hotel in the central area of ​​Shanghai like Xintiandi has such a reception attitude that asks three questions and doesn't know anything! ! ! The room rate of nearly 2,000 a night is really black hearted! ! ! The service and room rate do not match at all! I hope everyone avoids lightning! !

I knew it would be better to book Langham or Anda with a little more. Shi, quite regretful. Apar**ent-type hotels have large refrigerators, washing machines, microwave ovens, and toasters, which I basically don't use. The response speed of some slippers in the room is also relatively slow, and the service attitude of answering the phone is also very cold. We will not choose such a hotel apar**ent again.

The kettle is slightly yellowed, the old-fashioned toilet, the ring is cold and has no buffer function, there is a problem with the TV signal, the clarity is not high, and some stations have serious snowflakes like in the 90s. The wifi is unstable. The tablet is placed in the room during the day, and when I come back at night, I find that the power is 50% off, because I keep trying to find a signal. The room is too dry, and the static electricity is quite serious, which is as serious as Beijing winter.
Service: I said that I need a room with a better view, and the answer is good. Then there is a big tall building directly in front of you, next to it is a construction site. Breakfast is à la carte, and you can choose two from more than a dozen. The self-service area is less than five meters long, and the crowd is very chaotic.
This price seems to be acceptable during the Spring Festival, but it is usually the same price, so I will not consider it.

The toothbrush, comb, and slippers given are of poor quality, very poor, can’t we buy something better? It doesn't match the price of 1000 at all. The experience is very poor in all aspects, and there is a gap between checking out at 12:00 and the general delay until 14:00 in China.

Facilities: Although some facilities can be seen to be a bit old-fashioned, the room facilities are basically acceptable and fully meet the needs and functions of life. The equipment that should be in the room is all available, so there is nothing to choose.


Environment: The location is absolutely superior. There is our beloved tea restaurant downstairs, and Shanghai Xintiandi is only a 10-minute walk away. There are various bars and restaurants. Within 10 minutes' walk, you can reach K11, Central Plaza, Lippo Center, Xintiandi shopping mall, and Hong Kong Plaza is next door, which is very convenient.

I will definitely stay in this hotel next time I go to Shanghai!

1⃣️The air conditioner can only turn on the hot air, not the cold air, and it will be very hot to eat at night
2⃣️ Asked to send a pair of slippers, but the response was very slow, and it took a long time to deliver (about an hour)
In fact, I can ignore the above two points. The most difficult thing for me is point 3⃣️. In the morning, I was in a hurry and was going to have breakfast before leaving the store. When I arrived at the restaurant, I was told that there was only one breakfast? Tell the person at the entrance of the restaurant that there are two of us... She said that if you want to add 130 yuan/person (? I book a suite, is a breakfast reasonable?) Anyway, it means that only one person can enter, if you have any questions, please contact The front desk... because I was really in a hurry, I didn't go in. I contacted the front desk later, and the front desk said that the breakfast was redeemed by Ctrip points. If you want to add another one, you can contact Ctrip. I said I was in a hurry and it was too late. The front desk said no There is a solution... (But I don't think I have exchanged points for anything at all. After checking it later, it is indeed redeemed by points...the system automatically selects one by default...if you want to increase it, you have to manually order it...very speechless) Anyway, during the whole process, everyone made various excuses and didn’t take the initiative to solve the problem. I was really speechless. Is it difficult to adapt to the situation? And one last point, the hotel didn’t refund my deposit when I checked out. I checked out at about 7:00 in the morning, and didn’t refund me at 14:00 in the afternoon. I called the front desk and said that there is a process, okay, I’ll wait , As a result, I received a refund within a minute after hanging up the phone... Everyone can experience it for themselves !

Because I am the owner of CapitaLand and friends from Singapore also live in Ascott when they come to Shanghai. So this time I met my friends on the Bund and planned to stay here for one night.
When checking in, you are required to scan the code at the store. Turn on the phone... A security guard stood behind me and stared at my phone like a prisoner! I said my phone has a password, what are you looking at? He also replied that his attitude was very bad. (If there is a monitor in the lobby, please call it out.) What kind of people are employed as workers? There are machines for scanning codes! Identity information is required for check-in. Do you want to monitor us?
Then the air conditioner in the room has been switched to heating mode! The weather is 25 degrees outside and 28 to 30 degrees Celsius indoors. The windows were locked. I can't take it anymore, I'm sweating profusely! 12:00 in the middle of the night. Call the front desk and ask them to help open the window. I waited 40 minutes. No one came up to serve. Another phone call to the front desk on duty at night, and she actually said that she thought the colleagues from the engineering depar**ent had already gone up, but there was no handover? ! Later, a senior worker from the engineering depar**ent came to help me open the window with a lock. ! Did you hear...the windows are locked! Requires their special lock to open.
God! You can prevent the windows from opening completely, and you can open the windows a little for safety. Don't be afraid of guests falling down the stairs! Locking windows like this is against the law! The fire safety depar**ent must jointly inspect the safety! Later, I'm going to call the fire depar**ent. complaint!
It's breakfast time. The window seats are all fenced off and no one is allowed to use them! All the guests sat in dark, windowless seats. However, there is a beautiful woman with a ponytail who is said to be your work manager sitting in a bright seat by the window! hey~ Isn't it unusable? Why is she privileged? I asked the waiter and she said that it was their supervisor who asked a friend to talk about things. I observed for a long time and waited until she finished eating and she was alone. No one is dating!
This kind of differential trea**ent for guests is probably only available in your hotel. Do you have to wait for us to complain to the Singapore headquarters before you make a thorough reform?
We are all diamond members of Ctrip.
With this money, I don't think I should stay in this hotel.

msg:The hygienic problem is probably that there was a hair in the bathtub when I checked in on the first day, and then I felt that the amount of mineral water was different after cleaning on the second and third days. What is the standard of comparison?
Some problems were found on the way, such as the failure of the room card, and they were dealt with in time.
However, the hotel facilities are indeed old, and the air conditioner is louder.
But there is nothing to say about the location of the hotel. Overall, I am satisfied, and I may choose it again next time.

msg:I booked the 991 executive room on Ctrip.com. When I walked into the lobby to go through the formalities, the front desk lady asked for a deposit of 500 yuan. In the Ctrip rules, after the full payment was not indicated, a deposit of 500 yuan was required. At that time, I asked the front desk if cash is OK? The answer to me is: all OK. When I took out the cash in my bag and gave it to the front desk, it came again and said that it would be better to need an Alipay deposit. I'm also drunk, how can I say that the hotel front desk service can be professional. When I arrived at 6F for breakfast the next day, breakfast was included in the room rate. At that time, because the front desk did not do the corresponding handover work, I was delayed in time and could not eat normally. After calling to confirm the meal, I asked the restaurant waiter what happened. ? A word of indifference: the restaurant is an outsourced service, so it is normal and there should be handover work.

shortcoming:
Many facilities are too old. I was woken up in the middle of the night by the noise of the power distribution box in the room. The sound was very loud. I called the master and said that I could only change one switch. I was too lazy to toss and had to sleep until dawn.
There was a lot of scale floating in the hot water, and I took a bath with nausea.

There were hairs on the floor of the bathroom in the room. The mattress of the big bed was actually two small The mattress is spliced, and there will be a very uncomfortable depression in the middle. This situation has not been notified in advance, and I have never encountered it before... The pajamas that I put on the bed, after cleaning the room, I found that it was thrown messily on the bedside table. , Generally speaking, hotels will fold their clothes and put them on the bedside. This time I was really shocked. I don't know if the cleaning was forgotten or the hotel did not have training in this area. There is no way to directly enter the hotel elevator in the underground parking lot, and there is no clear sign. The elevator on the negative floor is not written. If it weren't for the location, there are many other hotels at the same price, and the hardware facilities and services are much better than Ascott.

The waiter in the restaurant said that they would be considerate of their work. I also wonder how the first-tier service apar**ent brands are now handling complaints at this level. I didn't take any photos. Second, you also destroyed the bread and corpses. The first thing you came here was to push responsibility. The check-in front desk staff are also perfunctory. They don't take the initiative to ask and don't know how to introduce basic check-in information such as breakfast time and gym location. I'm very curious how many points are auditing you every year. Are GM and RM bonuses okay?

房間衞生很差，有蜘蛛，有污漬。燈光昏暗。隔音幾乎沒有。
另外房間格局都很差，洗手間正對床頭之類比比皆是。床墊很薄，很硬，是所有五星級裏面最差的。
我很少寫點評，更少寫差評，但是這個確實差的出乎意料，特此銘記。大家千萬小心

雅詩閣雖然時間也很久了 但是乾淨整潔，沒有異味，還有小廚房。性價比很高，住新天地附近的話強烈推薦
