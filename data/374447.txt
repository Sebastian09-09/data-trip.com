I booked this hotel because it was close to Jing‚Äôan Temple. Check-in was very convenient, the location is great, and the bed was comfortable. I did sit by the window for a little bit. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who‚Äôs coming to Shanghai.ÔøºÔøºÔøº

Always so inviting, caring and makes me feel like a family member when I stay. The hotel is decorated nicely for Christmas and has a nice holiday feel. 
Breakfast is always a nice treat, served hot and fresh with many options.

This one didn‚Äôt, we got told only floors from 17 and above have coffee machines. Once we eventually got one it was broken. The temperature in the room was ridiculous we had to ring for a fan. Even with the AC on 18 the room was 30 degrees. We left early in the morning because the bathroom was ridiculously hot. The mirror has weird stains on it.

The front desk personnel were helpful,communicated in English which made the check in process quick.Celia Chen;fitness center department was the reason I booked because prior to booking I was deciding between two hotels.Just like how she responded to my inquiries on phone is the same way she did in person. She is a warm and friendly woman . The concierge Cris Chen was really helpful as he was communicating to the delivery man regarding my package. The rooms are spectacular maybe a few tweaks here and there tech wise could make it better but it‚Äôs still okay as it is. The ayis;pool area, housekeeping ,big thanks to them for their assistance. Overall the stay was worth it and will definitely make a reservation soon.

Outside a bit simple, but room decoration is nice and their functions are good. The carpet (in boring  grey) could see a vacuum cleaner from time to time. For what you get, the price is really  good, especially taking the location.

 However, the upgrade are either a down grade compared to what I booked. Or they are offering exactly the room I already reserved. Is the service personal at the checkin unable to see my reservation? Why they always mention it like a huge favor to give me an upgrade when I actually get the room I reserved? Very annoying and very unprofessional.

When checking in, they sent us to the room that doesn‚Äôt have hot water, intentionally( the admitted in the next morning said they don‚Äôt have any other available room).
Later on, someone show up to fix it, but the way they fix is to jump from cold water into hot water. So basically we don‚Äôt have cold water instead :(

The hotel breakfast was the low point for me. The selection of Chinese and western food was not bad, but nothing was excellent. The western food items were cold and were not replenished when they ran out. The Chinese selection had your average steamed dim sum such as Baozhi (ÂåÖÂ≠ê) and mantou (È¶íÂ§¥). There was a noodle bar, but I don't eat noodles for breakfast. There was a large selection of bread and pastries, but non were very good. Everything seemed like it was store bought. Overall, the breakfast was over priced for what you got.
All in all, I would stay at the Swissotel again for the comfort, service and convenience. I'll just eat breakfast at the numerous restaurants just minutes walk away.

My room was on the 26th floor so had a great view of the city across to Lujiazui. The room itself was very comfortable, and I especially liked the bathroom products and the in-room coffee machine.

msg:After a shaky start, which was, as always was blamed on Covid etc., etc., the stay improved a lot.  Staff were very helpful, the food was OK.  It was disappointing to find out only once I had checked in and gone to my room, that the gym, pool, spa and other facilities were closed, again due to Covid.  This information should have been stated in the Trip.com information when making the reservation as it would definitely have had an impact on my choice.  Room service food was delivered in plastic take-away containers, in a paper bag. Once again, when I mentioned it to staff and management, the situation was rectified.

The hotel very kindly had no hesitation in refunding me one-night's room rate when I had to cut my stay short.  Something that not a lot of others would have done.

Would I stay there again?  Probably yes, due mainly to the location and the fact that I would clarify my needs on check-in to avoid misunderstandings.

My thanks go out to management and staff for their responses, particularly Cassie in Room Service, who demonstrated an exceptional customer service attitude.

I was very happy there was an espresso machine in the room! The location is excellent, very close to shopping, fine dining restaurants and short walk to French Concession. Highly recommend staying here if you plan on staying in Shanghai!

When I got in I did not haveÔøº A nucleic test within 48 hours and was still waiting on the test results from earlier on that day but they allowed me to go to my room after doing an antigen test in the lobby. I went there on Chinese Valentine‚Äôs Day and got a special suite. They were very accommodating with bringing champagne glasses and ice to the room. The gym was not open when I went there which was a shame because I wanted to see it. The breakfast the next morning was really good, they had real coffee instead of an espresso machine. I like that touch.ÔøºOverall it was a great experience! I would book again.ÔøºÔøº

The only downside was the bar on the ground floor, we were given a menu and wanted the cheese board, were told they had run out, so we chose another item off the list and were told they didn‚Äôt have any, so we said what do you have? They only had a limited selection.  We were then told we had to make a quick decision because the kitchen was closing in 10 mintues - 8.30pm. We ordered food and drinks. As soon as it arrived the bar staff left so we couldn‚Äôt get drinks either. Poor communication and limited choice!

msg:Really excellent hotel in a prime location surrounded by malls, restaurants and metro stops. Easy to get to from Hongqiao Train station and close to the Jing‚ÄôAn Temple metro. There‚Äôs a bookstore / caf√© just outside the front of the building and a Family Mart across the road if you need supplies.

The room I stayed in was spacious, lovely view of the area, well decorated with a large bathroom. The main drawbacks were only minor but included a lack of plugs for charging phones / power banks e.t.c. (& none next to the bed), the random placement of the light switches and some floor and wall damage on the bathroom tiles but ultimately they weren‚Äôt a big deal.

Pool and gym were basically empty the whole 5 days I was there as was the guys‚Äô steam room / sauna / jacuzzi so it was relaxing to have so much time and space to use these. One of the attendants for the spa was a little abrupt when I asked questions about their services so I decided to not use them.

Overall, originally planned to stay for 2 nights and extended to 4 because I liked the place so much so would definitely recommend to others if you don‚Äôt mind spending a little more on your trip.

The hotel is adjacent to Jing'an Jiuguang Depar**ent Store in the west. Jing'an Temple and Jingpin Center can be seen from the room window. The transportation is convenient. It is only three to five minutes away from Jing'an Temple Station on Metro Line 2. There are many food and drinks around. The interior decoration is also good. Now the lights are all touch-controlled, and the lights can be selected in cold and warm colors. I specially ordered room service when I was waiting for them in the room at noon. The service attitude was super good and the experience was good.

After getting off the train, take Line 2 to Jing'an Temple directly. It is near Jiuguang Depar**ent Store and next to Jingpin Mall. You can take Airport Line 2 from Pudong Airport to the City Air Show Building directly. It is just downstairs from Jiuguang Depar**ent Store in Jing'an Temple and next to the hotel.
Nearby Reo Depar**ent Store, Kerry Center, Jiuguang Depar**ent Store, next to each other, there are many food, drinks and entertainment nearby~
This time I was upgraded to a room type, and the facilities are much newer.
The only thing I pointed out is that the curtains in the hotel bathroom are a bit transparent, which is easy to see. If my parents live together, it will be embarrassing. I hope it can be rectified.

We kept the curtains closed for 5 days, which was like staying in a secret room. I paid extra for a deluxe room and was naturally disappointed. If this is the cheapest room, everyone will understand and accept it easily.
However, the good city view may be nothing more than that, because the glass windows are covered with dust. üôÑ
The hotel promoted a discounted buffet dinner, but the food was of average quality. Most of the food had no umami flavor. The meat of the long crab legs was watery, and the crab sticks were even more delicious! The first time I finished the buffet in an hour. üòÖ
Apart from the above issues, luckily everything else is good. It still has a great location, the staff are polite and sincere in their hospitality, and the room is very clean. Although the Sauna facilities in the fitness floor locker room are a bit old, they feel neat and clean overall.

Compared with this time, my understanding of the Swiss Hong'an swimming pool has made a qualitative leap. In the past, the water temperature of Hong'an's swimming pool was the coldest and most unfriendly among the nearby hotels. I didn't expect it to be very comfortable this time. The overall environment and facilities of the swimming pool and the gym are very clean and hygienic. Anita, the front desk clerk at the gym on the 5th floor, is very professional and friendly. With such good employees, it's no wonder that Hong'an Swissotel has such a good check-in business. Hong'an Swissotel must be my first choice for staying in Jing'an next time.

There is a convenience store across the road, and the price is very cheap for this location. The downside is that the coffee machine in the room was extremely dirty. . The wooden door card was not very sensitive. Either I could not access the elevator or open the door. I called the waiter to open the door. When the aunt on the floor came and saw me holding the door card, she was shocked and her words sounded like contempt. I don't know how to use the key card to open the door. . .

msg:Hey, I didn‚Äôt expect that the service of a five-star hotel would be so deeply involved. I was told to wait 20 minutes at check-in. They didn't even tell me when they came out of the room. After waiting for a long time, I went to the front desk and asked the service staff who kept calling me to wait. After waiting for a long time, she finished the phone call and started checking in for the room. I have submitted the documents before and I still need to mention it again. I refused. In the end, I was told that there was only one room for disabled people. It was around 11:00 in the evening. I was exhausted and speechless by this five-star service. Entering the room, I had nigh**ares again and again, see the picture below: after 2 minutes of taking a shower, the water could flow all over the room. If a disabled person goes out, he will probably be even more disabled. Supplies were rusty. Hey, this is my first time encountering a five-star hotel.

msg:The facilities are old, the carpets are dirty and stained, and the service is almost zero. I stayed here for four days and three nights. I can only say that this is the worst experience I have ever had in so many hotels. I almost never give negative reviews, but this time I couldn't stand it.
1. On the first night of my stay, I made three phone calls to collect disposable daily necessities. I fully understand the hotel‚Äôs efforts to protect the environment, but after being informed that two sets of adult toiletries were needed, the hotel only sent them I got two toothbrushes and called the service center again. At 10:30 in the evening, I was told that the hotel room service was busy and it would take half an hour to deliver other supplies. Half an hour later, a room service staff came with a basket and I told them to give it the same. I‚Äôm the same, like I‚Äôm shopping for groceries in the middle of the night;
2. The next morning, I found that the coffee machine in the room was broken, and there were obvious gray stains in the water bottle. I informed the front desk before going out. When I returned to the room in the evening, I found that the coffee machine should have been repaired, because the coffee cup was still placed in the room. There was a cup of coffee on the coffee machine that was made at an unknown time;
3. I went back to my room to sleep due to feeling unwell the day before. When I opened the quilt on the third morning, I found an unknown red stain on the sheets at the end of the bed. I was in a hurry to go to Disneyland, so I informed the front desk when I left;
4. On the morning of the fourth day, I found that the coffee machine was broken again, and the racks for cups on the coffee machine were not installed flat.
From the first time I reported the problem to the front desk to the time I checked out, I did not hear a word of apology from the hotel staff, and no staff took the initiative to contact me. The entire check-in experience cannot be described as disappointing.

On the first night, I woke up from the cold and had nigh**ares! The experience is very poor. I suggest you ask for an extra quilt. You can‚Äôt refer to this air conditioner. There is an air conditioning equipment platform outside the window of the room. There is no view at all and it is very depressing. If you are not on a business trip to meet clients and spend less time in the room, you must change rooms (from Comment from an old customer who stayed for no less than 30 nights)

When communicating with the hotel, the hotel's attitude was very tough and told that you must check out at 12 o'clock. As a Ctrip Black Diamond, I have stayed here for more than 10 years. Each time, we checked out at 2 pm. This time we did not give any warning in advance. Instead, we communicated about the noisy decoration at 1 pm and emphasized the check-out issue. In fact, even if we check out before 12 o'clock, there is still a problem of noisy decoration that affects our rest. It is chilling that such a large five-star hotel has such a poor service attitude towards loyal customers who have stayed there more than 10 times!

The last time I extended my stay, Stella, the intern at the front desk, changed the room from the original room on the 17th floor with a capsule coffee machine to the one on the fifth floor, which is the closest. The room in the elevator was not as good as the original one and was very noisy. Even our room came with breakfast and we were not informed of the breakfast time.
This time I came to check in on Valentine's Day. Last time I was able to check in at around 11 noon, but this time I had to wait until 3 pm because I rushed here very early and the journey was very tiring. There was no place to rest and it was a very enjoyable experience. Difference

The concierge will come to help with luggage as soon as we enter the door. I would like to praise Iverson and Cris. They not only helped us familiarize ourselves with the surrounding business districts and transportation methods, but also informed us of some parent-child tourist attractions. When I checked in, I also felt the hospitality and enthusiasm of Shanghai. Jack at the front desk enthusiastically informed us about the hotel's infrastructure, the opening hours of the swimming pool, etc. Amber, another front desk person I met when I checked out, would also be friendly and concerned about our next stop. And asked if we need to arrange a taxi in advance. All in all, Swissotel Wang An is worth our next visit.

The executive lounge is on the 27th floor. Although the decoration is a bit outdated, the overall environment is very comfortable and the guests are quiet. The catering content is not much but exquisite, which is small and beautiful. So I went to the restaurant on the second floor for breakfast. Sure enough, there were a lot of varieties, and the Chinese food was unexpectedly delicious.

In addition, the bedding is also very comfortable, which improves the quality of sleep. Overall, quite a good stay experience.

There are quite a lot of restaurants and shopping malls around, such as Shanghai Cuisine Renhe Restaurant and Songfa Bak Kut Teh, which I recommend. The room is not very big, and the bathroom door can't be closed tightly. The coffee maker and shower head were broken and not checked and replaced in time. The coffee and leisure area in the lobby needs to be consumed before you can go in and sit for a while, which is a bit unsatisfactory. In addition, there are not many varieties of breakfast, and it feels a bit not rich enough, which can be improved.

msg:Since I did not bring my ID card when checking in, the use of electronic ID cards is not allowed. The staff is not so flexible when explaining. As a customer, it is already very helpless, but there is no way to change it. Guangdong has already used electronic ID cards in the whole province, not to mention Greater Shanghai. Some rooms are old, but the sanitary ware is very clean, the toiletries are very good, and the bedding is very silky, which is worthy of praise! But the noise of the air conditioner is relatively loud.

1. The wifi speed is not fast and the sound insulation is average
2. The service attitude is average. Check in. There is a man at the front desk who has been chatting with the couple customers in front for a long time, talking and laughing, and ignoring us.
After waiting for a long time, our check-in was not completed in the end. We had to store our luggage first and check in in the evening. I am so speechless
3. There is a problem with the design of the sink in the bathroom. The side of the washbasin is only a little away from the faucet. After washing your face and hands, all the water flows from the back to the front and then drips to the ground
4. Also, when it was time to check in, the staff at the door helped to carry the suitcase, but when they checked out and stepped out of the steps at the hotel door, they acted as if they hadn‚Äôt seen it. After checking out, they would ignore us before they walked out of the door? 666
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Others are ok. The location is very good. It is very close to Jing'an Temple No. 6 entrance. The room is big and clean. These are good places
Overall, the service attitude needs to be improved

The overall style was very good and my family was very satisfied. The room became a little smaller after adding a small bed, but It was a very comfortable stay; I even applied for a late check-out‚Ä¶
The service in the executive lounge was very good. Breakfast and dinner were all taken care of there. During this period, a child knocked over the plate and scattered the food on the floor. The waiter immediately came to clean it up and kept comforting the child. We were all very sorry.
There's nothing to say about the surroundings. It's right next to Jing'an Temple, and it's very convenient for shopping, eating and transportation (it's a bit congested during peak driving hours).

It is considered to be the most cost-effective parent-child room among the surrounding five-star hotels.

One thing to mention, the breakfast is still good, rich in variety and delicious, but if the waiter can take the seats and arrange them reasonably, there won't be a lot of 2 people occupying 4 seats.

The room is spacious and bright with a good view. At night, you can look down at the brightly lit Shanghai. The endless stream of cars is as beautiful as the flowing Milky Way. The room is not soundproof, and there are always some abnormal noises, which affect the wonderful experience of staying. In addition, this time there was an unpleasant incident where the waiter swiped his card and went to the wrong room. Thanks to the customer service manager's timely and sincere apology and the act of giving away breakfast coupons, we still love Hongan Switzerland. Next time we come to Shanghai, we will choose this hotel again hotel.

When we arrived at one o'clock, the front desk said that we would be upgraded to a room with a better view for free, but there is no room now, and we are asked to come back at three o'clock. When I came at 3:30, I had to line up again! In the end, we were finally queued up and said that there was no room. After waiting for another hour, the front desk kept saying that it had nothing to do with me. Is it not your relationship or our relationship? Later, I kept coming ‚òéÔ∏è saying that this item is broken, and that item is goneüòî
        Later, I found that the room was facing a broken house, and the sound was still loudüòÇ I called the front desk and told the front desk, the answer I got was: the floor has been upgraded, from the sixth floor we booked to the fifteenth floor, and now there is no room to change In the end, the lobby manager changed us to the 18th floor at night. The attitude of the lobby manager is also very good.
        Let's talk about the swimming pool, there are small pools that can be soaked in, and there are also pools that can be üèäüèª. And the locker room is connected to the swimming pool, which is really appreciated!
       There are few types of breakfast, more western food bread, Chinese food is not as good as the Express Hotel, the taste is so-so! The biggest advantage of the hotel is the great location!

msg:The location of the hotel is lively and convenient. It's just behind Jing'an Temple. There are many big shopping malls nearby. There are all the facilities that a five-star hotel should have. It's very convenient to call a car or subway. Knowing that I have made tea, I put a lot of bottled water, very happy. The Japanese grocery store next to the lobby is surprisingly fresh and cheap. It is very convenient for a family to live together in the connected rooms. In short, the price is very high. Will come to live again. By the way, there is a nucleic acid point opposite Jing'an Temple.

msg:When my friends and I mentioned Hong An Swiss, we often called it a "cheap big bowl" hotel. Staying in such a room at such a low price in such a location is a very cost-effective choice for a period of time. Therefore, the facilities There are almost no requirements in terms of facilities, supporting facilities, etc., but this stay has really stepped on a lot of bad points.
     
  An old-fashioned hotel, located in the core area of Jing'an District, downstairs is the Changde Apar**ent full of feelings, almost every room can see the radiant night view, shopping is extremely convenient, Kerry Center, Jiuguang Depar**ent Store, Rui Ou Depar**ent Store is a three to five minute walk You can reach it, basically there is nothing you want to buy but can't buy.
   Service: The staff in the lobby are bright and efficient, like old friends, warm but not overly thoughtful guidance and service. It‚Äôs just that the cleaning lady is so enthusiastic. She rested in the room after the meeting in the afternoon. She pressed the Do Not Disturb button, but she swiped her card and came in to clean the room without notice. A simple clean up will be over soon. If this is a guest who is sleeping soundly or is not feeling well and resting in the room, it will make them irritable all day long, seriously disturbing the rest, or maybe the facility is too old to display Do Not Disturb? I didn't figure it out until the end.
   Facilities and equipment: It is really old. The mosaic tiles in the bathroom are full of age. The stains hidden in it have reached the point where the stains cannot be cleaned anyway. There is no small refrigerator in the rooms above the mid-range of the hotel. Guests who like to drink iced drinks should not too convenient
     The bedding is very comfortable, soft and supportive, even as good as the bedding of the nearby Langham Hotel, which is slightly more expensive. The hot water from the faucet is also very slow, about one minute on average, it is understandable that it is very old.
    The big problem is the hotel‚Äôs wifi port. If you want to connect, you must log in to your member account and receive verification text messages. Since the Accor Group is relatively small, I don‚Äôt have a member of its group. After asking, I was told that I can log in directly without being a member, but my colleagues Like me, several other colleagues in the company can't skip the registration and log in directly, and they can't receive the verification code after registration. This it interface can be optimized.
     ‚ö†Ô∏èThe last question is room delivery. I ordered room delivery that day for convenience. I understand that it was changed to a lunch box due to the "epidemic reason", but all the ingredients are not very fresh: squid that can't be bitten, Sticky shrimp with shrimp strings, yellowed green beans and collapsed vegetables, really please pay attention to quality control, this situation is almost the same in Shanghai no matter what kind of restaurants, or small street shops and roadside stalls It won't happen, it really surprised me, and the price of room service is not very cheap, even comparable to the Puli Hotel next door, but it is indeed of such quality, as shown in the picture below, there are pictures and the truth.
   It is hoped that the above will draw attention to

msg:I like this hotel very much. My younger brother and sister came to Shanghai to visit with a baby. We stayed for two nights. It is a few stops away from Hongqiao Railway Station and three stops away from my brother's house. The hotel is just outside the subway. The hotel is surrounded by major shopping malls. Now, Hang Lung is only a few minutes' walk away. Downstairs is the Jiuguang Depar**ent Store. The supermarket on the first floor of Jiuguang is very good for shopping, and the display is very high-end.
Although the outside of the hotel looks a bit old, the lobby, including the rooms, are well maintained. From the nucleic acid inspection staff at the entrance of the hotel to the reception at the front desk, they are all warm and polite, and the breakfast is also great. The room design is very user-friendly, the hygiene is super clean, and the color of the furniture looks a bit old, but it is actually this color.
In such a good hotel in Shanghai, such a good location, as long as 599 does not include breakfast, but 700+ including breakfast, I can't believe it, and the cost performance is super high.
Anyone who doesn't stay in this hotel will lose 100 million, haha!
Don't be obsessed with a certain beauty nearby, my sister has lived there, and Hong'an is the most fragrant!

So around 11pm the day before departure, I called the hotel reservation depar**ent according to the instructions, but it took a long time before the call was answered. I also understood that the other party might be too busy. The waiter who answered the phone had an extremely bad and cold attitude, saying that the reservation could not be made. She had no way around it or anything like that. Is there no handover at the hotel? No communication between depar**ents? Can't I make notes in trace and Alert in Opera? Or is there no WeChat group now? ! So that it is really impossible to solve the guest's reservation? Then you should indicate the time after which reservations will not be accepted, etc. Don‚Äôt make it difficult for guests to understand...

msg:I have been to Jiuguang, Jingpin, and the restaurant in the hotel building many times before. I never thought that one day I would stay in this hotel that is 3 subway stations away from my home. It‚Äôs been the third year of the epidemic. Staying in a hotel is just for the sense of festive ceremony and not a special need, so swimming facilities and breakfast are the first criteria for screening. This one seems to be all right, and the executive room package during the festival is really quite cost-effective.
       When checking in at 2:00 p.m., the room type was not available, and the package indicated that you can check in at 10:00 p.m. After asking for instructions, the front desk gave a very satisfactory solution, changing to a 105-square-meter executive suite and a free extra bed. After changing the room, it is much bigger. There is a separate tea room, living room, and two bathrooms. Although the facilities are older than other hotels, I won‚Äôt comment on it anyway.
        The hotel has always been mainly serving foreign guests, and has been operating buffets. The food and beverage standards are quite good and generous (the best among hotels with the same price). The housing package comes with afternoon tea, either with a few cakes and snacks, or the standard package for external sales. The taste is very good, which is consistent with the desserts in the buffet. The trea**ent in the executive room also includes a self-service afternoon tea, with a wide variety of snacks and exquisite presentation, all delivered from the kitchen on the second floor. The food and beverages for the happy hour in the evening are separated from the buffet on the second floor. The meals are different on the two nights. One day is fried rice and fried pork chops, and the other day is fried noodles and roast duck. There are also other dishes such as stewed eggs with clams, creamy cauliflower, and smoked salmon. However, there are several varieties of cold and hot dishes, staple foods, snacks and fruits, and you can also drink red wine, white wine, beer and beverages. Originally, I planned to arrange a day to go to Yema for dinner for two nights. I felt that I didn‚Äôt need it after staying for a day. I was too full in the morning, afternoon and evening. The service in the lobby bar and the restaurant on the second floor is also very good. I feel that every service staff is very smart and can read their expressions.
        The hotel's swimming pool and additional services are much better than all the hotels I have stayed in before, including Shenkeng, Pudong Shangri-La, Peace Hotel, Xijiao Hotel, and W Hotel. No matter which time you go to the two sauna rooms, they are open normally, and the service attitude is also very good, unlike some hotels where the sauna room is cold in the morning. There are also several hot spa pools in the locker room area, and the enjoyment of these facilities alone is worth the price.
        Overall, I like it very much and I am very satisfied. I am optimistic about the price next time. If it is suitable, I will stay again.

msg:In the past few years, I have lived here every time I came to Shanghai, mainly because of the high cost performance, good service, and excellent location. We stayed for three nights this time, and we opened two rooms. There is enough space for children to play wild in the room. The hotel has a self-pickup cabinet when you go downstairs to pick up takeaways. Going to Jiuguang Jing'an Temple is just a wall away. We went swimming together this time. If you don‚Äôt compete with Shangri-La in terms of facilities, you must definitely stay in this hotel at this price. Chaya and Slam explained in detail when they checked in and checked out, and they were very friendly, and the hotel service was warm. It is worthy of being the one who often received foreign guests.

After finally getting in line, I was told that the room hadn't been cleaned yet.
The little brother is probably also very helpless, because the previous guest waited for an hour and was still notified that the room is not yet available. You can check in after 3:00 in the reservation notice, and you will not be notified if there is no clean room. Such a big hotel is still there Central prime location
This kind of service ability is indeed greatly reduced. The sound insulation is worrying. In the middle of the night, I was woken up by the sound of the TV set next door or downstairs. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the sound insulation problem or the TV sound is too loud. Eat, there is no waiter to guide you to sit, and the waiter will stand by the side when there is no empty plate. It is convenient. The picture is an old five-star hotel, but I will not stay again.

The hotel was a three-minute walk from the subway and arrived early. The check-in was also very smooth. The guest room was quite satisfactory, the ventilation window could not be closed, and a person from the telephone engineering depar**ent came to deal with it. The most important thing is that I have had back pain recently. The mattress of the hotel is very satisfying and comfortable, and it has solved a big problem.

The variety and taste are much worse. The most outrageous thing is that I left my mobile phone charger on the bedside table. I called back to ask, and said that the cleaning did not report it. I said that I must have left it in the room. They said to check again, but they still said that the cleaning staff said they didn't see it. I was also speechless. When I got up in the morning, I just unplugged the mobile phone to make a call, but didn't unplug the charger. I forgot the charger when I left. This kind of service in a 5 star hotel is so disappointing. The charger worth tens of yuan was also taken by Missy, the cleaning lady. What kind of service is it?

msg:I am writing this review just to say something bad. I hope it can be a reference for those who are planning to book, so as to avoid mistakes.
1. Air conditioning problem. In the winter, the air conditioner doesn't work. The temperature setting can be adjusted to a maximum of 28 degrees, but no matter how strong the wind is, the indoor temperature cannot be raised and the screen displays 22 degrees. But very cold.
   After the wind was turned up, the room was very dry, which is why when I woke up the next day, my spit contained blood.
   The sound of the air conditioner was very loud, which disturbed my sleep.
   
2. Noise problem. I already knew there was construction at the door when I made the reservation. When checking in, I chose a room with a different orientation. The notification letter stated that construction would be from 9:00 to 18:00. So what the hell is the construction going on from 11:40 pm to 2 am.
   Not to mention that the construction party is not under the hotel's management. This is completely understood. But the hotel has the obligation and responsibility to tell guests that construction will be done at night. There was noise during bedtime.
   Haha, I guess if I say this, no one will check in. So what do the people who are staying now count? One is staying and the other is cheating.

3. Breakfast problem. There are few types, definitely not as good as chain series like All Seasons and Atour. The noodles came out within 30 seconds of being put in the pot, and the uncooked ones came out again. The noodles are served raw. Bad review!
   If the issue of rawness and cookedness cannot be resolved, the chef can get out.

4. The windows in the room are poorly sealed and you can feel the wind blowing in from outside. This is completely unacceptable in winter. It can only be said that the permeability is very strong! No need to open the windows for ventilation!

I caught a cold after staying one night and was very unhappy. Check out early and leave!
The toilet seat has no damping, which is really depressing to a certain extent.
There is no need to stay, there is no mercy, it is just a rubbish hotel, just block it.

msg:There are very few reviews. It's been a long time since I've stayed at a hotel with such a bad experience. There really is nothing else but a good location. The hotel has no management and the staff has bad attitude.
Get off the bus first, there is no welcome service. The person checking in was inattentive and the queue started to take at least ten minutes.
The room was small and the bedding had pilling and holes.
The most annoying thing is that there is a minibar list in the room I live in, but there is no minibar. Forget it, when I checked out the next day, the two girls at the front desk had a very bad attitude. Asked me if I had a minibar, I said no, I couldn't find the refrigerator. She said there must be one, somewhere. I said that I had searched all over the ten-square-meter room, including the location you mentioned. The person at the front desk next to me replied directly to me without even raising my head, "If you don't spend money, you don't spend money, that's all." His tone was very harsh. I didn‚Äôt remember the name, so I suggest you check the surveillance system in the lobby and get some training.
Everything else is tolerable, and the service attitude is at least minimal.
By the way, there is no orange juice in Nuoda's hotel. I'm quite speechless.

msg:A very bad experience, which makes people surprised again and again.
Decoration starts at 11pm every night and starts at 5am. I really don‚Äôt know if this is intentional to prevent you from sleeping well. I gave feedback to the front desk during the day and they said they would contact me as soon as possible.
There was another sound at midnight on the second night, around 11 o'clock. I called to give feedback and was told that it was a municipal project and it would end at 12 o'clock. As a result, it still didn't stop after 12:00. So I accept the suggestion to change rooms. After changing the room, the room was still very noisy and there was no change. The hotel's feedback is nothing but excellent. I hurriedly checked out early the next morning and found that my socks were left in the room from yesterday. I called the hotel and asked for two socks to be delivered in a bag. As a result, a lady balled up a sock and gave it to me directly. . It's really surprising all the efficiency and the rigid process combined with the rigid service. What was even more surprising was that when I went to the front desk to check out, the front desk employee refused to give me the bill! Because we are Ctrip guests! Later, she called the lobby manager out, and the lobby manager gave me a bill... Then the assistant lobby manager asked me how my stay was. I thought about it and briefly asked the question. Their response was not even an apology, but they repeated what I said and expressed surprise. It took twenty minutes to check out. I will probably never stay at this hotel again whether I am on a business trip or something else.

The fly in the oin**ent: I called the front desk and asked the restaurant to order some salt to wash the fruit, but I promised but didn‚Äôt deliver it for a long time. Maybe the restaurant forgot, or maybe it couldn‚Äôt be delivered. In the end, I went out and bought it myself.

msg:The following pictures are three times the price of Nongfu Mountain spring water without a clearly marked price in the room
On March 5th, a bowl of porridge sold for more than 100 yuan

The first time I checked in was on March 5th because the hotel room was very noisy because the public company booked the hotel room. There was always a clanging sound in the middle of the night. The staff of the engineering depar**ent came to personally test in the middle of the night. The conclusion may be that there may be children living next door.

Besides, the temporary reservation at 9 o'clock in the evening is 200 more expensive than the price on March 5, excluding breakfast. I saw on the Ctrip platform that the room type is the same as the room I stayed in. The hotel manager deliberately emphasized that the upgrade has been made.

The point is that the door slamming started again during the break at 10.30. The average time is about 20 minutes. It was close to the work room until I called at 12.30. I came back around 10 o'clock to wash up, I fell asleep, and at 11.20 I started to ring the doorbell again. Maybe the sound was very loud. I closed my eyes and rested a little bit scared. I was going to drink a little less water. I opened the small refrigerator and thought it was a free quote, because many cities in Wuhan and Hangzhou are free to use it up. You can contact the housekeeping to supplement it at any time, so I took a bottle of Nongfu Spring mineral water.
As a result, I was asked to pay 10 yuan to check out at 12.10 points. Based on the above factors, my bottom line has arrived.

I didn't expect the second experience to be really bad
It is understandable that check-in due to the epidemic requires a lot of cumbersome procedures, but what does it mean to check out for others during the check-in process? Are the staff not trained even at the most basic level?
Is it reasonable to hear the sound of a mouse and vaguely see a mouse at night? The staff didn't even apologize. Is this what it should be? Or does this kind of thing happen often? Is it weird already? The solution is to change the floor? Treating the symptoms but not the root cause?
How does a solution like a five-star hotel get a five-star rating? Or the recent outbreak of the epidemic has already disregarded these, then I should let the city prison know whether it is so slack now

msg:I gave a suite for my wedding in the banquet hall last month, and I also booked some rooms for the guests, but the service of the hotel, especially the front desk, is really bad. There are too many problems with the attitude and way of doing things at the front desk of the hotel. Room service is required here. The response to the things and services are very slow, the facilities of the suite room are also full of problems, the bathroom door can't be closed at all, and the bathroom shower can't be fixed. This broken hotel has made me angry. The more I think about it these days, the more I feel angry. Let me remind everyone that you must be mentally prepared for the services and facilities of the old hotel.

msg:The worst experience is the last 2 minutes in the store. I was satisfied with everything before. The special receptionist from check-in to check-out seems to be the same person, professional and friendly.
As a result, all the experience fell to two people, a parking lot security guard and a concierge suit staff.
I didn't know that the hotel would charge for parking even if I stayed at the hotel before I checked in. When I left the hotel, I was told that I had to pay by myself. The car was parked for two days and the total was 240 yuan. You call to ask... Hehe, I feel like you are wrangling in the street parking lot.
Pay for the parking and ask the concierge about the charges and ask for an invoice.
It is the hotel policy to get a response, and the most touching sentence of explanation is "the hotel location is so good/the hotel price is so low"! ! ! ah? Oh! It turned out that I took advantage, and I was wrong.
When asked about the invoice, he asked, "Didn't the Security Depar**ent tell you to issue an electronic invoice?"! ! ! Wow! It turns out that the hotel is so institutionalized and the division of depar**ents is so clear, which subverts my understanding of concierge.
When it comes to the end, I also feel sorry for my 240 yuan, and I blame myself for not understanding the hotel's policy and causing trouble to Swissotel.

The hotel room is very small and the facilities are outdated. There should be no other advantages except the plot; the bathroom and bathtub are broken, which delays the guests so much time, and there is no compensation or even an apology.
I asked the front desk for a toothbrush, but I waited about half an hour and didn't bring it. I called it a second time to urge it.
Not much for breakfast, pretty bad
In addition, the sound insulation is very poor. The children staying next door were awakened many times at night.

Note that the second line of Pudong Airport has changed its location. It is estimated that this is one of the reasons for the hotel's price reduction.
The gym is not contracted out. It is quiet and there are no outsiders. This is a good one.

First of all, from the service, I arrived at the hotel at 8:30, saying that I need to add a half-day room rate, stayed in a lot of five-star hotels and their own hotel industry, generally have a room cleaned, then check in to the guest to give the room card, really can not clean out, let the guests wait, It is also useless to add a half-day room rate. And if there is no room, there is no room. Isn't there still a room that is not given? Then if I live according to this rule, will I still have to refund my half-day room rate if I live at less than 12 o'clock the next day? After the reflection of the lobby manager, he was still very active. After that, I went to get the room card and didn't ask if I needed toothbrush and other toiletries. I don't know why the front desk service consciousness is so bad? There is no initiative.
Secondly, the facilities in the room, there is no socket on either side of the bed or USB charging hole, I am also stupid, I still have to run to the lamp to charge the phone? And there are two sockets near the lamp. One is still bad. Please check your facilities, please? The lamp is also very old, don't say that it is always ok to change a refurbishment?
Even a main switch, the midnight to sleep and to go down a light off a trouble to die!
Overall disappointed not to return.

She immediately prepared a new room and prepared fruits. However, the new room still had frequent problems. The refrigerator leaked and the bathroom faucet leaked. Contact the switchboard and ask the installer to come and repair the result. The installer surnamed Yang pushed ahead and asked a cleaning lady surnamed Wen with extremely poor service attitude to come over and take a look first? So what's the use of having you as a maintenance worker? ***I spend so much money to see how you look at me? Later, the installer surnamed Zhou was nice and brought people over to inspect and repair the room. He called the switchboard to complain and asked for a replacement cleaning and maintenance worker in the future. The switchboard surnamed Wang had a very good service attitude and carefully recorded the needs. However, the male manager on duty behind the scenes *** each He was extremely impatient and even quarreled with me on the phone. Is this the service attitude of a five-star hotel? And the sales attitude of the hotel **** is as if she owes him money. Or is it because the hotel business is not good as the Spring Festival is approaching, so the service attitude will also be slack? I was very hesitant to check in after reading so many negative reviews. Sure enough, there are reasons for poor business. The negative reviews cannot be groundless. The experience of staying in a so-called "five-star" hotel is extremely bad**

msg:I have also stayed at Swissotel in several countries. I have good impressions and well-trained staff. It is a business hotel. Although it does not require enthusiasm, it is absolutely professional and decent.
But in Shanghai, I really don‚Äôt know why the staff management is so poor. In the whole staying experience, only the room sanitation was more satisfactory. It is the staff in the lobby who are less satisfied. I very much doubt whether they have been trained.
This time I took my parents out. 1. Arrived at the front desk to checkin at noon. The receptionist was a lady about 30-40 years old, and did not hear the service phrases such as "hello, thank you, please" during the whole process. And it was very rude to say "Hey, you open the application code first" (may I use it to address guests?) Other than whether it includes breakfast, the location of the executive lounge, and how to use the afternoon tea vouchers, it is all mine. When I thought about it, I asked, but she didn't expect that she was too lazy to explain, so she took a piece of A4 paper and let me see it for myself. Before leaving, I subconsciously asked "What time does the afternoon tea start?", she replied: "You can read the afternoon tea coupons when you have time." (May I ask if you don't even bother to move your mouth? Reply will there be less meat) 2. Withdraw After the room, we need to store our luggage. So he talked to the middle-aged manager who was working on the computer at the concierge and said in a suit jacket, "Hello, we want to store our luggage". He even turned his head and responded that we were standing next to us, and he turned to face 30. A working brother at the Mi Depar**ent shouted, "Hey, take care of it", and the middle-aged uncle said "Please wait a minute, but didn't say anything to us." The younger brother is not very polite: "Well, how many do you send? What is the room number?"
‚Ä¶.Summary: Who will tell me, why I stayed in a hotel like I owed them money for eight lifetimes. The whole hotel is making a bad face. What's the matter? Suddenly I felt that I was so humble...

msg:The service is really average, except that it is located in the center of the city and has no advantages.
First of all, the check-in speed is slow, each room takes a long time to process, and there are only a few people in the queue for a long time.
Booked a family connecting room for 4 people, but only gave two breakfasts. The reason is that the family connecting room is suitable for parents to bring a child under the age of 12, and let the child under the age of 12 sleep alone in a 1.8m big bed? ? When you think about it, this reason seems absurd.
There is an area in the lobby that may be a coffee shop. You cannot go in and sit for non-consumption. There are very few places to rest in the lobby, and it does not have the style of a five-star hotel at all.
The most annoying thing is that you have to pay for parking when you stay in a hotel, which is 120 yuan for 24 hours. Is the hotel in the city center this kind of hospitality? It‚Äôs the first time I heard about paying parking fees when staying in a hotel. Is the hotel business so bad that it needs to earn back from the parking fees?
Won't be coming again, I'm so angry

The facilities and decoration are indeed no problem, but there are two parts of the service, I have an opinion.
First, when we had breakfast, we added another person. He said that he would pay immediately. I said, can I eat first and pay later? She originally agreed, but in a blink of an eye, she walked over to my desk and said that our company's policy is that if you don't pay, you won't be allowed to eat breakfast, please go and pay for your mobile phone now. For a 5-star hotel, I was quite astonished.
Second, the parking fee is not free. I parked for ¬•135 a night. This is also the first five-star hotel where the parking fee is not free.

msg:This hotel is the worst five-star hotel to stay in. First, I had to wait for more than half an hour to check in, which was very slow. At three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the front desk to get the room card and was told that there was no room. After that, I didn't ignore anyone. After being left alone at the front desk for half an hour, I got angry and told the front desk that I could get a room at 3:30 at the earliest. It was funny. I have never stayed at a hotel where it took more than 2 pm to get a room! ! !
I still have to complain about the room I got. There were fluff everywhere on the bed cover, as if it had been damaged for forty or fifty years. It was dirty! The height of the bed is also amazing, very high. There is a wooden edge around the edge of the bed. If you get in or out of bed and get close to the bed, you will definitely be hit. It‚Äôs bad! Most of the furnishings in the house are useless and unreasonable! What‚Äôs even more funny is that there is no socket on the bedside table! Can't find any socket in the room? ! Gray layers can be seen everywhere. The tent in the parent-child room is covered with a thin layer of plastic bottom. The children will sit with the PP between them. What's the use? I can still sleep! It's not as good as any express hotel, don't stay here! Whoever lives there will regret it! Also, regardless of whether you stay or not, the hotel doesn't have free parking, and the payment system is rubbish. You can't pay no matter what. It's all unreasonable. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, the worst

When the elder sister in front drove away, we had a lot of luggage and turned a blind eye. I asked him if he could push a cart for me and turned his head away. I shouted loudly, and he actually asked me: What are you shouting for? We are security guards, not doormen. Can we take care of your luggage? I stopped arguing with people like this. I went in and called the doorman. The doorman said that the wedding had occupied the car, so he could only help me move it! Because it‚Äôs okay to stay there permanently, and after settling in, I wanted to go swimming. I happened to meet the hotel maintenance man chatting in the elevator: Why didn‚Äôt you go swimming? Another said: You think the swimming pool is clean, but it is dirty! I felt sick instantly, why didn‚Äôt I hide it in front of the guests?

msg:Come to complain! Because I had to arrange a one-day check-in schedule for working nearby, I got up early for a meeting and went to bed very early last night. Around 21:30, someone started knocking on the door frantically (because I had fallen asleep, I waited for a while before getting up). Knocked on the posture that this door must be opened today. After asking the waiter who it was, I opened the door. The funny lady said: Sorry, no deposit was paid for this room! So I have to lock the refrigerator. If I don't lock it and there are less things, I will be in trouble. If they can‚Äôt find you, they‚Äôre coming to find me! Then he entered the door, locked the refrigerator, and left! Among them, I said 2 words of understatement that I was sorry...the rest did not mean to disturb me at all! I was really tired, and I felt very exhausted after being confused the whole time! !
Is this how the hotel educates its employees? Randomly disturbing the rest of residents who have clearly paid a deposit? It doesn‚Äôt matter if your mini bar is not free. My deposit of 1,400 is not enough for you to deduct? Do you want to lock it? Afraid of being stolen? Are you afraid I'll steal it? It really becomes more and more baffling the more I think about it. After the lady left, she felt completely sleepless. I am a person who is too lazy to comment, and I don't expect your hotel to value "service" because of a small comment. I just want to make a note of it for myself. If I come to work in the area in the future, I will never choose this hotel!
