msg:This second time staying here, like the first, didn't disappoint. As before, visiting during the off-peak time is ideal for a quiet, uncrowded getaway. 

The sea-view room is welcoming and comfortable, with a view that is uncluttered and peaceful; opening the patio doors to the sound of waves rolling in equals instant relaxation. Aside from having a super comfortable bed and all the useful amenities one could need, there were simple niceties about the room, like the ability to adjust the temperature and fan speed (which runs quietly without disturbing sleep), ample hot water to fill a soaker tub, and multiple options for adjusting the room lighting. 

The hotel is immaculately clean, the grounds are meticulously maintained, and access to the beach is just steps away. The breakfast is substantial, with a variety of both Chinese and Western dishes. The staff was friendly and happy to care for our needs, even providing a power converter which I forgot to pack. 

Those in search of a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the city can't go wrong by staying here. Highly recommend, and hope to visit again in the future. Hats off to the staff. 感谢你们让我们住得特别舒服！

msg:Let me write the positives first: 

Tasty breakfast buffet available. Local and international options available. Probably, the best breakfast buffet I’ve had in China. 

Superior customer service

Spacious room with an actual balcony available 

—-

The not-so positives:

Near to the beach but, unfortunately, the beach is a bit unimpressive and rundown. 

The room was nice but a bit dusty. I am a little sensitive to dust so maybe that’s why this was an issue for me. 

Also, the air quality was bad for most of my stay (weekend) so the balcony view was a little disappointing. No fault of the hotel but thought I would mention it. Keep the air quality in mind when booking. 

Overall, decent stay.

The facilities are just so-so: the swimming pool was crowded as there is no control, but just accept everyone, at every time. The parents didn't take care of their children and this was the annoying part.
The gym is just ok, and the SPA is closed, even if the hotel is listed in their facilities service.
Eventually was a nice trip, but still some room to improve for a "Hilton hotel".
Cold corridors, too hot rooms, and the layout of the breakfast buffet are just some examples where I would suggest focusing more attention.

I had a buffet breakfast and dinner in the restaurant, which is very cost-effective. The variety is complete and the taste is good. And it is very convenient to eat in the hotel.

The moment I opened the balcony door, I was instantly amazed. The undulating mountains in the distance, the blue sea and golden beach nearby, and the emerald garden under my feet merged into a beautiful picture. Listening to the ebb and flow of the tide and watching the clouds roll in and out, all the gloom will be swept away. Although I have embarked on the return journey, the day I spent at Luneng Hilton Resort Hotel will become an unforgettable and beautiful memory in my life. Thank you for meeting the beautiful Jin****an and the warm and comfortable Luneng Hilton Resort Hotel.

There is no place to wash your feet in this season. Only the Happy Coast Gate 1, which is farthest from the hotel, has a footbath with an iron basin as shown in the picture below. It's a bit like the 1990s. It's really uncomfortable to go to the beach to play with children without a footbath. The hotel service attitude is also very uncomfortable. I booked a three-day stay on Ctrip, but the front desk said that the travel agency placed three orders in the middle, and suggested that I go to redo the room card every day. I told the check-in staff to authorize directly for three days, and the other party said yes, but it was only done for one day. In the end, I still went to authorize every day in a disciplined manner. It was really inconvenient and particularly angry. This hotel is really the worst Hilton I have ever stayed in. I have no choice. I hope Ctrip and the hotel will pay attention to my evaluation, thank you 🙏!

msg:Let's talk about the good things first. Before I came, I was worried about the poor service, the queue for breakfast (basically no queue before 8:30), and the poor room environment. None of these happened. I'm not going to say that the same price is 10,086 better than another castle, which has nothing to offer except the location.
Facilities: As a resort hotel, the facilities are well maintained. Since I didn't book a parent-child room, I could only stay in a sea view room. The sea is visible when I opened the window, and the scenery is very good. I can feel that the hotel is very well maintained. The maintenance of the hotel that opened in 2018 is particularly good.
Hygiene: The sanitation of the public areas is well maintained. We soiled the sheets on the first day and changed them in time.
Service: Since it was the May Day holiday, there were indeed a lot of people. Checking in at more than four o'clock in the afternoon was very smooth and there was no queue. Basic services such as taking seats for meals are also there. I can feel that they should have been emphasized and trained. The overall service staff are very cautious and pay attention to the feelings of the guests.
The only two problems:
1. The hotel advertises children's meals everywhere, but when we asked on the third floor, the third floor said to go to the fourth floor to order meals, and when we got to the fourth floor, they said we could go downstairs to eat after watching. Finally, we ate at Qingya. The kids were a little disappointed that they didn't have children's meals.
2. We stayed for three days and didn't get on the blue train until the last day. We stopped halfway and discussed with the driver to get on first and buy tickets later. In fact, such a good project can have a QR code or indicate the departure time, otherwise we can't always get lucky. The experience of sitting on the train and watching the scenery is really great, and it should be promoted well.

This time I only stayed for one night and went to the city to play, next time I have the opportunity to stay a few more nights~

She also replied to messages quickly. Thank you for taking care of Elala, which made me feel at ease living here. I also like the small balcony in the room. It is very pleasant to watch the sea and listen to the waves. The service staff of this hotel will greet you with a smile, which is rare. It's just that there are not many children's activities in the hotel. There is only one area for children to play, which can be improved.

msg:Before going to Dalian, I compared several five-star hotels, and finally confirmed Hilton. Advantages: large area, close to the sea, pleasant scenery. Service staff are polite and enthusiastic. You can take a Dangdang car for a walk, 38 yuan for half an hour, and it is very interesting to travel around the castle. I thought I was satisfied with everything, but when I went to the executive lounge for dinner in the evening, my good mood was ruined. The decoration of the seventh floor was moved to the fourth floor, and the food was leftover. There was no view of the executive lounge, and there was no service... I was very angry. This is a situation I have never encountered in countless executive lounges, and it is very inexplicable. Is this Hilton? The next day, I moved to another five-star hotel. I hope the management will strengthen management in this area. The flaws do not outweigh the merits. This hotel is still recommended for staying!

Next time I will choose Hilton again, and I look forward to staying next time.

If there is a fly in the oin**ent, the restaurant in the hotel, Qingya, is expensive, small and not delicious. It’s understandable that things in hotels are expensive, but the price/performance ratio is too low, so we can only deal with it occasionally. If you are looking for value for money, take a taxi and go out to eat. I read that the buffet has average reviews on Dianping.
But the breakfast is not bad, it has both Chinese and Western options, and all the necessary categories are available. Breakfast is worth it.

For the first time, I felt at ease as if I had an "acquaintance" in a strange environment. When I arrived at the hotel, the first thing I noticed was that it was very European-style and beautiful. Building, check-in Because it was close to lunch closing time, the front desk receptionist took the initiative to help take on the task of delivering the suitcases to the room, allowing us to pack lightly and go to the hotel's Chinese restaurant to enjoy lunch in peace. The hotel is close to the beach. Walking along the blue seaside, the warm winter sun shines on you, and seagulls fly carelessly in front of you. Next to the beach is a temple of the Fox Grandma, which is full of incense. I want to "pray" for myself and my family in the New Year. I think I will Come and stay at the Hilton Luneng Golden Pebble Beach Resort again, because your wishes will definitely come true and "fulfill your wishes".

Little Lucky: Dalian loves me so much that I upgraded to a room type ~ Deluxe King Suite (I forgot the specific name)

Room type: 2 bathrooms, 1 living room, 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom + 1 bathtub, 1 coat rack, 1 powder room, 1 small balcony, 1 large terrace, 92 square meters, super luxurious and invincible sea view~
I recorded the sunrise and sunset. It’s so beautiful (so beautiful that I’m at a loss for words).

Meals: Takeaway for lunch and a sandwich in the evening (15% service charge) Really! Real ingredients, bacon, chicken, lettuce, French fries, various fresh ingredients, delicious fried chicken, almost full~

Service: The lady at the front desk is really super gentle and I’m really happy to get a free room upgrade🥳

Finally... I spent two bad days in the hotel, watching the sunrise (out of the hotel) and sunset (on the balcony), which was really satisfying. Chatting with friends, lying on the bed and looking at the blue sky, white clouds and sea view, it was so comfortable! The highlight is that you can take a nice bath ~ Highly recommended! !

The whole building is a European-style castle. It gives me the illusion that a princess is coming home. I also struggled with the castle hotel in the city, but it was too expensive, nearly 2,000, which was too much over the budget, so I gave up~ But luckily Hilton did not let me down~

The environment is very good. During the peak tourist season, there are too many people. It is not convenient to have breakfast, but everything else is fine. It is very convenient to be near the sea.

msg:Golden Pebble Beach Luneng Hilton deserves to be an international five-star hotel.
The house price of more than 1,000 yuan is worth the money! After seeing the group of photos I actually took, you can understand the appearance of the hotel, what the hotel lobby and hotel rooms look like. The hotel's breakfast standard is at least more than 100 yuan, and there are no fewer than 100 varieties. There is also a sightseeing bus on the Binhai Boulevard outside the hotel. It is worth taking a round trip of 4.7 kilometers for 10 yuan per person. The hotel also has a constant temperature swimming pool (remember to bring a swimming cap) for free use by hotel guests. In addition, along the seaside boulevard, you can also walk to the commercial street and food street. I came by car and the hotel has enough parking spaces for guests to park for free. It is particularly worth mentioning that after I left the hotel, the hotel's customer service staff made a special phone call to inquire about the accommodation experience, showing the hotel's customer-oriented demeanor!

msg:Very beautiful hotel, but there are a lot of people in the summer. It is quite tiring to wait in line for half an hour for check-in, call for breakfast and wait 😔
The hotel facilities are a bit old, the water in the bathtub is not very smooth, needs to be improved~
I need to refrigerate food, so I provided ice cubes, like it~
Breakfast seems to have many types, but it seems to be few🤣 For example, there is only one type of sushi. Of course, it may just happen that I like to eat less.

In addition, fortunately, I booked the Hilton, which is very quiet at night. The Hard Rock next door, although it is also a five-star hotel, has a bunch of entertainment facilities like a rural festival during the Chinese New Year on the coastline next to it. , like the quiet and cautious 😅

msg:Let me give a thumbs up at the beginning: Lin Shanshan, the staff member of the executive lounge, is smart and understands etiquette, which is in line with the service standards of a five-star hotel, even better than that! The fried chicken is active and enthusiastic. For this service, I will definitely choose an executive room next time!

Like it again: there is a dessert shop at the back door from the hotel to the beach, it is really a treasure shop, the milk ice cream lady is so delicious, and the pineapple-flavored coconut milk is also extremely delicious! The material is pure and natural, so there is no problem for children to eat it. I have a cup a day as standard, so listen to me and be sure to rush! The proprietress is very enthusiastic. I checked out early on the last day, and the ice cubes in the store were not frozen yet. The proprietress actually drove to another store to borrow ice cubes for me. I was very touched and appreciated!

Hotel environment and facilities: The relatively new Hilton, which looks like a castle 🏰 is suitable for punching in. The package includes: a small parent-child zoo (you can buy a ticket for feeding small animals at the front desk, including alpacas, ponies, sika deer, bunnies, and peacocks), there are Indoor children's playground (suitable for babies), outdoor playground (large area, white sand, suitable for children of all ages), indoor swimming pool about 25 meters, the deepest 1.5 without swimming lanes, the water quality is average, and there is a bubble pool.

Check-in: I booked a sea view room for 2 days and an executive room for 2 days, and I queued up to check in at 2.30 pm. This is a small note: I can check in after 2.30, and I have to wait for a good view room. Luggage can be stored in the lobby first. I can’t wait. Choose a room with an average view. It’s best to wait for a room with a good view. You can see that a sea view room is very important after looking at the picture! Some of the executive rooms cannot see the sea. Before checking in, tell the lady at the front desk to arrange an executive room that can see the sea. Benefits of the executive room: 1. Courtesy: You can have afternoon tea from 2 to 4 pm every day, and you can have a light dinner from 6 pm every night. There is nothing to eat near the newly developed sea area, so the administrative courtesy is deeply rooted in my heart. Breakfast buffet... the dishes are very average, and the buffet dinner... the dishes are still very average, but you can eat enough, but you can't eat well, so let's make up for it yourself.

Cleaning: The sanitation of the public areas is OK. There are many families staying in the summer. Apart from the cleanliness on the day of check-in, it should be a simple change of hand towels, bed sheets and disposable products. If there is not enough water in the room, you can call to replenish it at any time, which is a plus.

Nearby: Go out from the main entrance and turn right to the Kingdom of Discovery. Go out the back door to the beach. Turn left and there are many water sports. It is a lively area with some restaurants. Turn right and there are few people. It is good to play with sand and catch the sea. To feed the seagulls, turn left at the back door of the hotel.

You have to wait for 2:30 for check-in procedures, and the waiting time is a little longer. There are often queues or insufficient tableware for breakfast. The dishes can be replenished in time, and the attitude of the waiters is also good. It is understandable during the peak tourist season.

Hundreds of people lined up at the door, and after entering, many things were gone. When we left, we didn’t serve any more noodles because there were so many people. We didn’t even add a vegetable leaf. A bowl of porridge, a few pickles, and a bowl of noodles cost a few hundred for two people. Let’s just say that if we can’t receive so many people at the same time, don’t sell so many. The money for breakfast is also money. In the end, we were too lazy to go out because we were tired from playing. The big one and the small one are more than seven hundred. As a seaside city, seafood is not much, how dare you accept 279?

msg:The hotel does not have a private beach, but the location is good, right in the middle of two beaches. The appearance of the hotel is good, and the night view is beautiful.

Being a resort hotel we received a very unseemly breakfast service. For breakfast, you need to queue up for a number, and a staff member shouted the number at the door, and the scene was very noisy. The breakfast food is rough, the pastry room is too ordinary (as is the buffet dinner); the supply of food and tableware is seriously insufficient; there are a large number of temporary staff rampaging in front of the guests. Disgusting scene in the food pickup area (see pictures for details). After communicating with the on-site staff, the breakfast passenger flow was too large that day, which has seriously exceeded the reception capacity. But this is no excuse. Whether it is the hardware configuration of the resort hotel, the control of the number of people serving breakfast in each depar**ent of the hotel, and the basic training for hiring temporary personnel, it is very puzzling. Very disappointed with the hotel management's ability to do their job as a guest.

For the guest rooms, the decoration is acceptable and the mattresses are relatively hard. overall relatively clean. But there was a thick lotion from the previous guest on the hair dryer which was disgusting. Details still need attention.

There is insufficient training in manners and language at the front desk when checking in. In addition, at the time of check-out, there were other guests at the front desk who were dissatisfied because they could not go through the check-in smoothly. The staff neither gave a reasonable explanation nor solved the problem. I can't comment on this but hope the hotel pays attention to what they are doing.

The hotel is very close to the beach and the Kingdom of Discovery, within walking distance! The hotel is also very large, with its own entertainment facilities!

Communicate with the front desk why there is no balcony and view problems, and the reply is that only sea view rooms and some executive rooms have balconies. The problem is that the price of the executive room is higher than that of the sea view room? After communication, it was said that the gift box was finally given to show friendship, and there was no action at the checkout. In addition, it was told at the checkout that the fees paid included afternoon tea and evening light meals, but neither the platform nor the hotel informed of this at the time of check-in

msg:First of all, I would like to talk about what I am satisfied with. The attitude of the hotel staff is very gentle. It is also very convenient to go to the beach from the hotel. The children refused to leave when they played on the swings on the beach.
Secondly, let’s talk about the inadequacies. It is true that the facilities and hardware of Hilton Dalian are deficient. As netizens said, the children’s room is really far away from the elevator, and the balcony guardrail of the parent-child room is really high, which affects the view, and the view angle is not correct.

msg:I took my children to play, but unfortunately I was unable to participate in the outdoor activities on a rainy day, and I found that the Kingdom did not go there😂 I have regrets and will go back next time

Service: The attitude of the staff is very good, they are slow and make people feel comfortable
Environment: The overall room style is white and clean urban modern style, the restaurant and indoor sports area have a large space
Facilities: We are a parent-child traveler, and we are used to living in a family suite, because having a separate room can at least allow the child to have a quiet sleeping environment, and another adult can also rest well. So I blindly decided on a family suite with a sea view without looking at the pictures, but only after checking in did I find that the 60-70 square meter suites in this hotel are different from those in many cities. There are no independent rooms, and it is an open living room. I had no choice but to ask the staff to look at the executive suite of more than 90 square meters. This room has an independent bedroom, but the living room is very big and there is no bed, so I need to add a mobile bed for extra money~ In this way, a room costs more than 2,000 , slightly worthless. The staff recommended that the parent-child suite has two double beds, but it is 40 square meters and there is no separate bedroom, which does not meet my expectations. I hope that the hardware facilities can be considered for families with our demands
Hygiene: very clean

As for itself, the hotel is quite beautiful... But, the facilities inside the room are really not good enough. There is a rattan sofa on the balcony, which is covered with dust...
If you want to sit on the balcony and watch the sea, don't even think about it...a stone wall can't see anything, and the dusty chairs can't sit on it.
The most outrageous thing is that there is a crane outside the window, and there is a particularly loud sound of construction after 9:00 on Sunday morning...you can click on the video to experience it. Not to mention vacation, I can't even sleep...

The hotel has done a good job in terms of outdoor landscape, interior design, room facilities, sanitation, and service. Although there was a small episode when we first checked in, the hotel staff gave us very good handling and considerate service. The children had a great time living and playing. Both the adults and the children had a good rest. The room is big enough for two children to play in the room. You can go to the opposite side for hot springs, and it is very close. Compared with the family villa with one big bed, living here is more cost-effective. I will choose this place next time I have the opportunity.

The 1641 room I live in is no different from the deluxe sea view suite. I'm very disappointed and frustrated. It's not the room price difference, but the sense of ritual.

When you ask, the lady at the front desk looks like a donkey the whole time, talking indifferently, and then calling someone else, yes or no , I didn’t give a confirmation letter after waiting for a long time, I said I would leave a phone number, came out of the room and told us, I forgot the number and never called from the beginning to the end.

After finishing the check-in, I was told that I had to wait another two hours before I could enter the room. When asked the reason, the staff proudly said that the room was full the day before. I really don't understand, hasn't Hilton experienced a full house before? So many tourists are dissatisfied, where does the pride come from? All the faucets in the room are unblocked, but the water flow in the bathtub is very small. If you want to use it, you have to start turning on the water at least two hours in advance. Knowing that the room is full, there is no guidance when there is nothing wrong with breakfast, and customers still need to wait for a seat... The service staff are very friendly, but they don't see any point of view for customers. I don't know if it's because of the "big shop", so...

msg:Overall evaluation: The hotel as a whole is sorry for the five-star title and the price. Follow-up will be reported to Hilton headquarters

The hygiene of the hotel is worrying. As soon as I entered the door, there was a dead fly on the table. There are many obvious marks on the bathtub, sink and wall.

As a five-star hotel, the TV equipped is an old-fashioned TV, and the water bar is the standard of an express hotel - ice dew and a few bags of instant coffee. I don't ask you to be equipped with Evian, Paris water, but can't even provide Nongfu Spring?

Check in in time for the holiday, there are many children, the room sound insulation is very poor, every morning will be woken up by children in the corridor

There is a shortage of service personnel in the hotel, and the elevator room and parking lot are not equipped with service personnel to guide the way. If you want to ask something, you can only ask the front desk.

Overall, the exterior is beautiful, the castle stands by the sea, but the travelers are not sleeping outside. The check-in experience feels that this hotel has completely smashed the Hilton's signboard, and it is even far worse than the whole season. It can't be compared to other hotels of the same class. I hope the hotel industry in Dalian will get better and better.

From the back garden is the viewing platform. The view is very good. The overall service of the hotel is still very good, just because it is the peak tourist season, when you go late for breakfast in the morning, you have to wait in line. I personally think this should be solvable. If there are too many people, the staff should be divided relatively, or other restaurants that can be used should be used, so that guests do not need to wait. There is also the fact that the mineral water used in the hotel where everyone is complaining is ice dew (the explanation given by the hotel is that the bottle of ice dew is degradable, I personally think this explanation is a bit far-fetched), in the case of Hilton's brand, the hotel With many supplies, in fact, should be relatively upgraded.

The deluxe sea view rooms face the sea and are very close to the beach on foot. However, the beach is a public beach, and the sand is a bit crumbly. It's a pity that Dalian's beach is like this. At night, the fireworks of the Discovery Kingdom can be seen once an hour, and the sea fog is relatively large, so it is difficult to see clearly. Due to the peak season of summer vacation, there are many people eating breakfast, and the hotel's breakfast order is a bit chaotic. One day, we were placed in the opposite Chinese restaurant. It was too far to pick up the meal. The waiter did not inform us in advance, which is very bad. The quality of the waiters in the breakfast restaurant is not high enough, and they are a little impatient. It took me a lot of effort to change to the normal breakfast room. With my own sharp eyes, I found a table that I just finished eating. The waiter was not willing to change it for me. , It took me more than half an hour, and the skin of my mouth was almost worn out. I hope it can be improved. The Chinese restaurant tastes good and the service is good.

The hotel provides an upgraded version of the sea view room, and the room can look at the sea by leaning on the railing. The room is still very clean and tidy, and the front desk service is also very good. I feel that the hotel is really big, with its own lawn and a small labyrinth. There are indoor playgrounds and outdoor ones. We only went indoors because of the time. There are some small toys and so on. There are many varieties of breakfast. Just in time for the peak season, house prices have gone up a lot. If I have the opportunity to go to Dalian again in the future, I will continue to choose to live here.

1. It is raining when we arrive at the hotel. Two concierge staff can be arranged at the entrance of the hotel lobby to greet them. Even if an umbrella is handed over, it will not be poured;
2. The weather outside is super sultry, plus it is poured after the rain, and when you enter the hotel lobby again, you will feel the temperature drop instantly, and it is easy to catch a cold;
3. Navigator drove into the courtyard from another door of the hotel, but it was not the main entrance of the hotel. I wanted to ask how to get to the lobby, but I didn't see a security guard, and then I called the hotel front desk to guide me;
4. The room is the floor, and the free mineral water is ice dew, which has a "Han court" feeling.

msg:Back to Jilin's hometown, Northeasterners have worked outside the country since childhood, but they don't know much about the north, so I came to Dalian during the holiday to see the seaside cities in the north and experience Dalian, which is a good city in the northeast.
I came here because of the first stop recommended by Ctrip. I also saw that Ctrip recommended one of the best parent-child hotels. It took 6 hours to navigate directly from Meihekou.
1: The hotel environment is very good, the sea view room booked is shown in Figure 2, and the sea is outside the window
Two: The hotel parking is very convenient. After the epidemic prevention is in place, the registration is in place.
Three: There are food, entertainment, and entertainment in the hotel. I haven't been shopping nearby, but I see someone ordering takeout. It should be very convenient if you don't want to eat takeout.
Four: There is a children's playground, the place has a good environment, and the equipment is a place that all children like
Five: Give a thumbs up to all the services, the service is natural, when I say hello, I feel that they are happy in their hearts and welcome you, especially the foreman and chef of the Chinese restaurant, although I didn’t order food because the children didn’t eat it. , but thank you for your attentive service, I promise to send the room even if I bring the child
Five: The only thing I want to complain about is the breakfast. Breakfast is not worth the price of more than 1,000 yuan. The main varieties are too ordinary to be eaten in general business hotels, just because your place is open, but in fact, Dalian has no special features, and a restaurant no characteristic of its own
In short, I still recommend it, especially with children. The window is open to the sea. There is also a children's playground downstairs.
Outdoor Children's Paradise - Xingqi Paradise to play, highly recommended

msg:Hilton will never let you down. Surprise you everywhere.
Originally, we planned to go to Chimelong in Zhuhai and then to Macau as the first step in the summer vacation. As a result, the travel to Macau was blocked due to the severe epidemic, so we temporarily changed our flight to Dalian.
    When you go to Dalian, you will naturally go to Jinshi Beach, and when you go to Jinshi Beach, you must stay at the Hilton Luneng Hotel. Hilton's service standards must be of a high standard. The child's foot was bleeding and he made a phone call and quickly brought a Band-Aid. There is no bathrobe for children, just make a phone call and have it delivered right away. In the middle of the night, the child slept until the temperature of the quilt could not drop, so a call was made and the waiter immediately came to the door to adjust the temperature of the air conditioner. Especially in the room we booked, I called the two adults with two meal coupons in two rooms and told the service desk that if we have two children, we can get half the ticket, so we can enjoy 5 people with 4 tickets. Normally you can't enjoy it, but Hilton will often surprise you. The high emotional intelligence and efficient communication of the service staff always put the interests of the guests first, and apply to the leaders as quickly as possible. Gave us a free breakfast voucher for a kid. Of course we are very happy, but also very surprised.
       We say that the current hotel industry must meet the needs of customers as the first element. And how to improve customer satisfaction, it must provide additional sense of value that customers think. And apparently Hilton did it. Kudos to your management team.
     In Hilton hotel management, they strictly follow the 6S standard and strictly implement the work process. Their sanitary towels have a clear area use. details make a difference. And these are the genes that become the DNA of Hilton Hotels and their core competitiveness.
     Whether in hardware or software, Hilton Hotels are the object of worship for people in the industry. The heated swimming pool, the polite and courteous waiters, the warm attitude and the warm smiles. Makes people feel very happy to stay at the Hilton Hotel.
      Hope that Hilton Dalian Luneng Hotel will create more brilliance in the face of adversity.

msg:The experience of staying at Hilton this time is very bad, and it is the worst feeling I have ever stayed in a hotel recently.
1. As an outdoor public area of the hotel, the hotel's South Square Garden is not open to guests due to epidemic control, but at the same time it hosts large-scale crowd-intensive events such as weddings. Is it because of the use of epidemic control reasons to engage in double standards? It is really incomprehensible. I communicated with the front desk and was told that hotel guests cannot enter through the hotel lobby passage, but can detour far from the road outside the hotel through a fence gate (it is said that non-hotel guests can enter through this gate) Entering, as a hotel guest, can't you enjoy the service that the hotel should expect? Are the requirements for epidemic control only at one door? The South Square Garden outside the door can undertake various activities at will, but cannot allow guests who should enjoy the services of the public areas of the hotel to enter? disappoin**ent……
2. As a Chinese restaurant where hotel guests dine, there are only a few tables for the guests, but when waiting in the queue, can the staff lead the guests in the waiting order? So why ask for a ranking? I communicated with the service staff and was told that this is how the hotel picks up guests, no matter how many people they bring together, no need to talk about order, and they even asked why we didn't follow along! ? I'm speechless, why do you feel like you've come to a big food stall? In addition, since we have chosen to open as normal, but there are very few meals provided, it would be better to order takeaways. I think the impact of the epidemic should be used as an excuse for further investigation. Personally, since I choose to open to receive customers, I sincerely hope You can do it with your heart, otherwise it's better not to open a Chinese restaurant and wait until everything is ready.
I don't want to talk about other small issues. In short, as a hotel of Hilton's level, the services provided should not be so perfunctory. I also sincerely hope that as an international chain hotel, the most precious thing is the standardization of hardware and the service that feels at home. Please cherish the trust of tourists in Hilton.

The outer plaza leading to the children's play facilities is closed and requires a large circle to get out. Special thanks to Li Mingyue from the fitness center.

In the off-season, there are not many occupants. The advantage is that there are few people to eat, swim, exercise, and walk around, and it is quiet. The hotel service is very good, responsive, clean and hygienic, and the breakfast variety is also very good. In the sea view room, you can see the Gold Coast and the blue sea from the balcony. It is close to the sea, and you can hear the sound of the waves when you open the door at night.

The hotel hardware is very good, with large floor-to-ceiling windows, invincible sea views, and even the night view is super beautiful.
There is a children's playground on the third floor, as well as a large swimming pool and gym. There are very few people, and they are all free to use, which is very good.
There are many kinds of breakfast and the taste is very good. Remind everyone that it is best to avoid the dining peak, otherwise you will need to wait in line to enter.
In short, a perfect stay experience, the family has fun!

🍃Environment: The overall environment is really good, not to mention clean and hygienic. I really love the high-end a**osphere. There are many five-star hotels. The overall environment (including the appearance) is not like the one here.
🛀Relax: It is very comfortable to take a bath in the bathtub, the angle and size are very good, and I took two comfortable baths
🍜Food: The Chinese restaurant is delicious. There are not many orders, but everything is delicious. Because it is in time for the Laba Festival, the restaurant also gives free Laba porridge.
Next time you need to relax yourself, you will also choose Hilton Golden Pebble Beach Luneng 💗

msg:I stayed here for two days. I just checked in on the first day and found a rag on the table, which was left by the cleaning staff. On the evening of New Year’s Day the next day, I went to the cafeteria for dinner. I wore the hotel slippers because I was worried that the restaurant was too hot because I was wearing high-tubular snow cotton. It probably means that you can’t wear slippers for the dining environment. Before I was a member of Hilton, I would dress decently, but this time I did forget it. The waiter reminded me that I would go back and change it. When I sat down to eat, I saw another woman wearing hotel slippers and she was put into the restaurant. I don’t know why it can’t be treated equally. When the waiter received the dishes, I asked her how the woman came in in slippers. The waiter’s answer was because She brought two children and it was not convenient to change. She obviously came from a family of four. Is it my fault that I didn't take the baby? A good hotel or a good restaurant just needs to dress decently. Slippers are not allowed, because if you bring a baby, you can not follow the rules? The buffet is nothing delicious. The only seafood is scallops, shrimps, sea rainbow, small crabs, and another kind of crab that I don’t know what it is called. During the New Year’s Day, there are 298 people who do not have discounts and group purchases. It feels not worth the price.

Check-in coincides with the Dragon Boat Festival, the occupancy rate is very high, basically all are family trips, but still can feel the patience and enthusiasm of the hotel staff. In the case of such a large passenger flow, the staff is orderly, warm and cordial, especially the reception staff in the front office, who are courteous, professional and efficient, take care of our whole family, are attentive, ask and meet our individual needs . The room attendant knew what we needed and prepared corresponding supplies for us in time. It really gave us the same feeling as home, and the children were reluctant to leave. Kudos to the handsome front office guys and the room attendant sister.

The best view of the sea. The environment is the most comfortable. The hotel’s lobby is majestic, decorated with birdcage glass shapes, and the glass is beautiful at night. There are sea views and mountain views. The coffee in the lobby ☕️ tastes good. I went to drink coffee at 10:30 on the 21st. A delicate little girl has a gentle and warm service attitude, which is the best service in the hotel. There is no smoking in the lobby and there is no consumption area. You can stay for a long time without spending, and the soothing piano background music is tasteful. The receptionist service at the front desk is also very warm.
       The Chinese restaurant is not very satisfied, the cooking skills are average, the price is high, the waiting time is long, the serving is slow, and the service is not warm and thoughtful. It seems that you are not welcome to eat. There is no service, but the service fee is quite high.

This kind of urine smell is so big, can't the cleaning smell it?
I never thought that a star-rated hotel would have the problem of poor toilet cleaning!
The urine stains from the previous guest's urine have been hung from the toilet to the floor!
The bathroom is full of footprints!
Because I will bring all disposable items when I go out!
I took the isolation pad for the iron toilet and endured it all night
The next day, reconfirmed that the service staff should carefully clean the bathroom
You see my picture! Not cleaned at all!
Still a strong smell of urine! Heaven! I'm going to pass out!
Please don't wipe it? Not to mention bedding, towels, sofas!
Heaven! I booked half a month!
It takes more than 2 hours to call room service to deliver things!
Golden Pebble Beach this place makes major money on weekends 2 days and holidays 7 days a week!
Guess how many people eat breakfast on weekends! Too much to doubt life! All kinds are not in place! ! !

Like the staff in the outdoor play area, the young lady is attentive, responsible, warm and friendly.

Call the guest service center, you can feel that the hotel is doing its best to meet every request of the guests. 👍

🍃Environment: The executive lounge has a good view, and the meal supplement is not timely enough. Dessert was not served for 20 minutes, and there was less than 100ml of orange juice left in a bucket of orange juice.

Breakfast is satisfactory, the standard level of breakfast in a five-star hotel.

In short, this is a very good resort hotel, and I would highly recommend it to friends who visit Golden Pebble Beach.

🧹Hygienic: After all, Hilton’s sanitation is okay, but it’s good in Dalian Hotel
🍃Environment: I don’t know why it is noisy at night. The hotel said it was the sound of central air-conditioning, but there was no sound on the first night. I was more sensitive and felt that it was noisy the next day. My teammates and children could fall asleep.
The toilet in a five-star hotel is not a smart toilet. The hair dryer is very difficult to use. These two are disappointing. Besides, the dinner buffet is really very average. There will be no second time for a family of three 800 yuan. Breakfast is okay.

msg:The five-star hotel has very good facilities, the overall European-style building, the green space is very beautiful, the photos are beautiful, the rooms are comfortable, the hotel services and epidemic prevention work are very meticulous during the epidemic, the breakfast is very rich, and the coffee is great. The location of the hotel is very good. It is just a five-minute walk to the beach. The nearby beach is very good. The sand is very fine and the slope of the water is very gentle, suitable for playing in the water. It is also very close to Discovery Kingdom, and you can see fireworks in the hotel at night. The only regret is that the underground garage is relatively rudimentary. It is a bit inconvenient to change the elevator twice to return to the room from the underground parking lot.

The location and environment of the hotel is so good that it is hard to find in the city! The service of the hotel is even more amazing ❗️ The most moving hotel night supervisor Ma Ming, after learning that we are coming to Jin****an with our children, he is very patient to help us introduce all the delicious and fun places in Jin****an. Then brought the full set of toiletries and robes slippers for the kids, and the introduction to all the hotel's service facilities and the children's playground was very detailed, really moving! An epidemic brought imperfection, but due to the Hilton Hotel, the child has a perfect holiday, thanks 💗 thanks 💗💗💗

msg:The hotel is very good. I have always liked Hilton. Going out from the back garden of the hotel, there are sea on both sides, fine sand on the right side, but it is dirty, sea****, full of shore, and black oil covered with shoes, it should be used for boats The oil can’t be wiped off and can’t be washed off, even on children’s swimsuits. The left side will be better, and the water will be clearer. There is no fine sand, but all pebbles. Don't live here if you want to catch the sea, because there is no living thing to catch. Besides, in hotels, buffets, children are charged according to their age, and half the price for children over six years old. The hot pot on the third floor is not recommended. The meat rolls are melted and then frozen. The noodles are also served frozen, unless you put the noodles directly into the pot. Later, it was requested to be thawed. The first night was given to us on the first floor. Because of the poor terrain, this is the first floor. There is a small yard. There are a lot of stomped cigarette butts in the yard that have not been cleaned. The lobby is on the fourth floor. I asked to change the room the next day. On the fifth floor, I can see the sea.

The sofa on the balcony is really dirty and it can’t sit on people at all. The breakfast variety is average and the service staff are also good. The mineral water in the room is ice dew, which is too cheap. Basically stayed in five-star hotels will not be so perfunctory. It’s fun to find the kingdom next to the kids. The outdoor slide of the hotel was not found after walking around, and even a service staff could not be seen outside. The children’s pool is a bit small, and there are not many things for children in the room.

However, as a 5-star hotel, there is no parking or guidance in front of the hotel, and the customer service staff are relatively casual, and the overall service quality is not good. The focus is on a large hotel in Nuo. Tell me that there are no medical supplies. I think that as a 5-star hotel, it should have basic medical supplies. When the weather is bad, the sea is foggy in the morning, and it’s okay to wait for the fog to clear. If there are a few people traveling, you can also have a BBQ at the beach. Check out at 12 o'clock noon, and keep calling to urge you to check out after 11 o'clock, which is quite embarrassing.

I have stayed in five-star resort hotels in other places. I feel that Dalian Luneng has too few children's amu*****t facilities, and the children's room is even less pitiful. There are only books and puzzles, but not complete puzzles. Since it is a resort hotel, we must pay more attention to the children's amu*****t facilities. Many vacations are with children, and there is nothing to play in the hotel. The only small animals are rabbits.

msg:Very bad.
I was not happy when I checked in. Before booking the hotel, I repeatedly told the customer service that because I arrived early that morning, I hope I could check in early, and the feedback said that I would try my best to arrange it, and there is no guarantee. Well, we can't force it during the holidays. As a result, when I arrived at the hotel, they didn't care about asking anything, they said there was no room, and they queued up to check in at 13:00. Are you really out of room? This is inconsistent with the feedback from the customer service. Trying to arrange and not ask is the same thing? The lobby manager said that when you talk about check-in, it can only be what you have to do with the hotel. Okay, I can only wait for the people to wait in line.
After check-in, the next morning, directly told me that your room does not include meals. I doubted myself. I took out my mobile phone to show the reservation information to the restaurant. They said it might be because I booked two rooms, the other The person in the room first came to report my room number, so I didn’t have a meal in this room...My husband said a room number, and they said that it was this room that reported your room number because the breakfast in this room was still Yes, my husband actually said the wrong room number. It seems that you don’t need to book breakfast when you book this hotel in the future, just report your room number and have breakfast easily. I wanted to pick up a cup of coffee at breakfast. I saw a waiter in a gray suit picking it up. There were still a few empty cups. I said trouble you to pick up a cup for me. When they came up, they rudely rejected me, and I had to give something else. Guests pick up, you can line up to pick up by yourself...
Tolerated breakfast, went out to play during the day, and returned to the hotel at 10 in the evening. I was stunned and the room was not cleaned... I found Ctrip's customer service and the hotel manager on duty. I changed the room and it was just opposite the original room...please Look at the sanitary conditions in the photo below. In addition, I would like to say that your hotel really has no rooms and cannot check in early? How can I change it at 10 o’clock in the evening... It’s our apology that people say you can check out late on the day, roll your eyes here, I’m second
I’m going to check out early to catch a flight, but people say I’ll give you a fruit plate. I’ll send it early. It’s so "sincere"... I thank you
Checking out is even more exotic. I don’t need to charge for the buffet the day before. I kindly reminded that they couldn’t find the order. As a result, the manager came over and said to the check-out staff that you would charge him 298! You, as a manager, don’t know that there are lists on the table in each room, and the price of the tenant’s buffet is 278 per person. Do you dare to be so casual?
In short, this is really bad hotel that can't be bad anymore

The deluxe sea view room was set, but when I checked in, the fog was filled, and I looked at the sea and looked lonely. On the 4th floor of the hotel, it is on the first floor with the lobby, and breakfast is also on this floor.
The swimming pool is on the 3rd floor, and the water temperature is not bad. My son hasn’t swim in a year and a half, and slowly finds the feeling here [呲牙], the water depth is 1.2-1.5 meters.

The hotel service is pretty good, from the front desk to the concierge to the cleaning to the room service!
The breakfast buffet is still very rich. Kids love it
Lunch is only once in the hotel, the sea urchin and lobster sauce spaghetti, the children like it very much, the taste is great 👍🏻
The location of the hotel is also good. You can walk to the Kingdom of Discovery. Go out from the garden behind. The beach on the right is more comfortable than the beach on the left. Dalian Beach is almost full of pebbles. The beaches of Jin****an are said to be from the North Sea. The fine sand here is more suitable for children's sand digging hobby👌🏻

However, the juice sold in the small red car in the hotel lobby is not very good, but the kids just love the cup😅

Every dish was very poor. I ordered 5 dishes, and 4 dishes were served within half an hour. 3 dishes were very raw and not very cooked. Both the elderly and the one or two-year-old baby can't chew, although I repeatedly stressed that we want something that can be chewed by the elderly and children, especially when my dad has no teeth. In the end, we didn't eat much, and we endured a random bite of food at the checkout. It was undercooked and not very tasty. The cashier counter of Qingya Restaurant and the manager (both women) they called explained that the dishes I ordered should be boiled raw. Yummy has nothing to do with Qingya Restaurant, not even a single word of Sorry; 2. The fifth dish was not served when we checked out (one dish was ordered in front of us, and a few minutes later, the waiter said that there was no more, so we changed this one ), but the restaurant has a tough attitude, and there is no sorry at all, no matter whether we eat or not, we have to pay, and finally we were forced to pay, and forced to give me a packing box, saying it was the last dish; 3 .During the meal, we were not given baby tableware. We asked for it, but only one bowl was given. There was no corresponding baby spoon or fork. I asked again. The size of the middle finger, the baby could not eat, so he had to use a large spoon to eat; 4. There was almost no service during the whole process, but this was not because the restaurant was busy, in fact, there were few people at the table, 15 The % service fee is really awkward, and the 0 service fee of the roadside shop is better than this...

I went past 12:00 noon and told me that I would not have a room until 14:30 in the afternoon. Yesterday, the room was full, and now no one has been cleaned. The breakfast is average and can accommodate a lot of people, but it is a long restaurant and it is very tiring to walk. The breakfast is not as good as Dalian Shangri-La and Yifang. We do not say the price of one party there, Shangri-La is cost-effective. Tell me about my room, I'm on the executive floor, room 2738, the view is good, but the toilet is smelly, I knew I had to change it, I didn't sleep well all night, and I felt stinky when I walked out the next day. . In a word, if Marriott, Shangri-La and other brands enter, I think it will have a great impact on it. Now there is a sense of being a big family, but the work is a little less interesting.

服務：五星級酒店服務也很到位，從停車場主動幫忙拿行李到行政酒廊小姐姐看我們人多主動多送了一份點心，再到落了東西酒店主動聯繫幫忙寄回，整個行程都很完美。

親子：酒店外面有些遊樂設施，但現在天太冷了不太方便。三樓有個小童俱樂部和歡樂島，小童俱樂部裏有積木、繪本和玩具，免費的；歡樂島一大一小68，像淘氣堡那種，可能是剛裝修還有些味道，估計過段時間就可以去了。

再説服務，打掃房間的服務員竟然將前一天用過的一次性拖鞋、一次性牙具全都扔了，補了新的，到其實很浪費的。補齊可以，但用過一次的沒必要扔，重複利用更環保。
再説監管，當中也遇到酒店電話回訪入住體驗，感覺就是例行公事，我本想立即反饋的，但還沒等説對方就急於掛了電話。
關於早餐餐廳的內部佈局，我覺得也很差，空間確實很大，需要走很遠，但早餐種類太有限而且位置放得很分散，來來回回要走很遠，不方便也不合理。
酒店整體位置和環境都很好，入住當天也給我免費升級房間了，這點是可圈可點的。衹可惜服務沒做到位，客户體驗感大打折扣了。

前廳的一切很有五星級酒店的樣子。
中餐廳的服務令人印象深刻。幾乎全體服務員都跟新來的一樣，看起來分工明確，實則效率非常低，點單、催菜、結賬，一問三不知。各有各的分工，全推給別人，等半天沒人來，解決問題效率低。口味非常一般，菜都快吃完了，説沒有米飯了，米飯正在現燜。不知道節假日的晚上七點，堂堂中餐廳，米飯還得等。自助餐廳的早餐和午餐更是不怎麼樣，沒什麼可吃的。午餐號稱有小火鍋，從來了到走一個小時左右時間，小火鍋愣是沒開鍋，服務員大姐最後給的理由是酒精塊少了一個，都用完了，火不夠。
房間佈置的很好，很適合帶寶寶來住。但是小童遊戲設施上有渣渣，房間在剛打掃後且未開窗的情況下，還是一地灰，孩子穿襪子跑了一會，襪子黑了。浴缸裏面也有灰塵。
整體印象，住的還行，小童設施很多，適合帶孩子來。就是在酒店吃的幾頓飯實在差強人意，體驗太差。

酒店面積很大，房間很棒，乾淨衞生，豪華海景比三亞豪橫多了，真正的面朝大海。
服務也很到位，提前一天就電話詢問我們特別注意事項，詢問我們什麼時間到，並且加了微信，隨時服務，每次房間需要什麼，五分鐘之內必到！十一這個服務，非常棒了！
我們因為行程安排需要提前一天走，也很順利的完成了。然後走的那天也享受了延遲服務，真的是我近期遇到過最棒的酒店了！酒店裡設施也很到位，健身房泳池，小童樂園，孩子們玩的非常開心！
這個酒店，想躺平玩的，真的推薦！在十一節假日各大景區人山人海的時候，這邊簡直是一股清流！海又乾淨，人也不多！周圍吃飯外賣也很方便！沒有缺點！

酒店環境非常美麗，從內向外都造的像童話一樣，大廳的彩玻璃，背後的大花園，每層的旋轉樓梯，給人感覺好像住在迪士尼的城堡裏。
房間設定設計佈局都很方便合理，空間很大，床品軟和舒適非常解壓，海景房的露台可以看到大連非常温柔平和的海面和綠色生機的花園。
服務方面稍微有點欠缺，前台設定太少，人多的時候可能會非常擁擠和吵鬧，我們在週中入住人少所以體驗還行，但週末退房的時候明顯感覺吵鬧了不少，態度也不是特別熱情，屬於冷淡但是還算禮貌的類型。
後續涼鞋我是扔在房間不想要了，但是酒店也有來打電話確認，對於客人遺落物品的檢查和處理還是很不錯的。
總體來説，推薦。各方面都挺不錯。

msg:從硬石退了房因為離得不遠一路走過來希爾頓，酒店外觀以及花園還是挺漂亮的；辦理入住的時候把第二天的房間從最低的非海景房（因為是信用卡權益免費兑換的）加了點錢升級到海景房，接待的姑娘特意幫我們調整到景觀視野更好的房間，這點還是挺不錯的；酒店環境和房間衞生都可以，泳池也比較大，唯一的不足是泳池水質相當不清澈，這點比硬石差的多；兩天的晚餐都是在酒店中餐廳用的，菜品還行，就是中間説廚房水管壞了青菜和海鮮做不了了這點比較神奇；總的來説這家希爾頓對得起這個價錢

户外小童樂園——星奇樂園暢玩:小朋友超級喜歡，而且面積很大，能玩的不少。

早餐:比較神奇的是需要等位，種類不多，味道也比較一般。
衞生：酒店的衞生是我最關注的點，整體來説還可以，但是可能因為距離海邊太近，床品有點潮。還好自己帶了床單和被子。

msg:五星級酒店，辦理入住時需要排隊至少45分鐘，衹開兩個櫃枱服務，我也是迷茫了，真是希爾頓？！
辦理入住的時候，告知我第二日可以直接交付房卡離開（我是提前預付，另外也看見有工作人員在直接收取其他離店客人的房卡），次日我找工作人員交卡離店，但是告知我需要再次排隊交卡。當時我就提出質疑，是政策一天一變啊，還是看人下菜碟呢🤔️
浴室的浴盆排水設施功能障礙，無法打開排水，客房服務使出“大力金剛指”，把下水孔強力摳出，點贊👍
早餐供應的新鮮水果太少，80%都是罐頭，比起我在瀋陽住的一個桑拿都不如，那裡的葡萄、荔枝、火龍果、西瓜…無限供應！
不過服務意識還是好的，景緻還是優美

我兒子六歲、身高120CM，入口服務員支支吾吾説了六歲什麼什麼得需要補費~
新年第一天嘛，我也沒多過問就補了，但同樣的希爾頓酒店位於南方是不會這麼處理~
以後入住需要考慮考慮啦

msg:酒店設施：酒店整體像個城堡，外面看很高大上，住在四樓（進酒店大門那一層）陽台就能看到外面的噴泉。房間空間大，顯的很空曠，但是裝修比較老，從入住進來房間一直有怪味，説不出來是什麼，保潔也説房間有味，散不掉，噴到空氣清新劑也沒用，估計是某些傢俱的味道吧。
前台服務：到酒店辦理入住，網上預訂的，應該很快的，但是還是要等，每天都能看到前台有客人排着隊在辦理入住和退房，這部分可以優化改進的。
早餐：198元一位，我們住了三天，每天早上吃飯人山人海，按我們去的時間應該不是旅遊旺季，估計是有旅遊團或者其他的團隊。早餐可選擇性不是很多，煮飯阿姨一直在抱怨人太多幹不過來，主廚跑出來幫忙，客人倒沒有抱怨做得慢，工作人員挺多的，但是還是感覺餐廳好亂，補餐也不及時。
酒店優勢在於出酒店後門走10來分鐘就可以到海灘。

自助晚餐還不錯 忘了具體二百多少一位了 符合這個價格的標準 但估計是因為平時客人很少 衹有周五開始到週末結束才有自助晚餐 行政酒廊也是衹在這段時間開放
另外一件事是 這地方是婚慶熱門目的地 熱門到過於奇葩 早上正是客人用電梯的高峯期 總共三個電梯被佔了兩個 新娘和伴娘 新郎和伴郎各一個 霸佔著電梯瘋狂拍照 把整個酒店的客人趕到唯一一個電梯裏 擠得根本下不去樓 這是什麼道理？
最後空調太差太差太差 正對着太陽的大落地窗 陽光一照進來温度直網上升 我兩天早上都是被悶醒的不是睡醒的

服務：入住那天遇到一家保險搞活動把花園佔了，有點吵。

室內泳池其他都挺好，就是從更衣室到泳池的門有感應噴水，我是陪小孩去不準備下水的，每次經過更衣室都會被淋到，工作人員讓水停了再過，但是還沒過去就又噴了，不科學。

如果酒店或者景區內以後能提供自行車租賃這些就好了，出門吃飯和去沙灘都更方便

服務:大堂辦理入住接待的人員態度冷淡，與別的連鎖五星酒店比較，這個酒店內主動打招呼的服務員沒遇到。
早餐:這裏的服務人員值得誇讚一下，很主動的引位並能及時收走用後的餐盤。
位置:去發現王國近，看煙花方便，去海邊也不遠，也許是它唯一的長處吧。
總的來説性價比不高，以後希爾頓系列酒店也會慎選。

衹是可能旺季沒什麼服務提現有兩點:
1-下車後並沒有禮賓部幫忙搬運行李，
2-酒店由於旺季多的被子一套也沒有了，也是比較尷尬。
臨走時，由於我們在景點沒來得及回來，酒店免費延時至2點，也是比較人性化了吧。

1. 顯示3點可以入住，但是到的時候是2點57，説還要再等半小時
2. 備註了帶小嬰兒入住，安排安靜的房間，方便小寶寶睡覺，是提前準備了房間，但沒打掃好，就換了個房間，但是非常吵！隔音效果非常差，樓道里説話的聲音，旁邊房間客房服務的聲音等，都能聽得到，白天小寶寶在房間睡覺總是會被吵醒。
3. 帶小寶寶也住過好幾個五星級酒店了，但這家酒店的嬰兒床是最差的！牀板直接到地面、床圍欄太高了，而且床還一動就吱吱想。小月齡寶寶抱着哄睡後往嬰兒床裏放特別難放，大人整個身子都要探到床裏去，小寶寶在放的過程中就經常醒，小寶寶睡着的過程中如果醒的話，再把寶寶抱出來哄睡也特別難，床圍欄太高了，非常不方便。同時小寶寶衹要一動，嬰兒床都會吱吱想，響聲經常把小寶寶吵醒。本來寶寶可以睡整覺的，但是在酒店住的2天，每天夜醒四五次，休息的特別不好！
4. 酒店服務人員不是很熱情，服務態度也一般。但餐廳服務人員很熱情，對寶寶也很好，對餐廳服務人員好評！
最後不推薦帶小寶寶的入住，休息的特別不好！

msg:前台服務質量是入住那麼多五星級酒店中體驗感最差的，首先辦理入住速度非常慢，排隊等了2個小時。一家人出行預訂了2個房間，希望能安排同一樓層，前台説客人多安排不了，這個我們能理解。但安排的1號樓5樓，2號樓6樓，當時我們就提出疑問是不是在兩個樓裏，前台回答是同一幢樓衹是兩個方向，後悔當時我們沒有堅持要換房間，導致後面更麻煩的問題。結果上樓後發現1號樓和2號樓的第5第6層並不連通，要下樓通過大堂換電梯才行。問題接踵而來，2號樓的房卡不能刷1號樓的電梯，1號樓的房卡不能刷2號樓的電梯。我們向前台反映時，前台輕描淡寫説房卡可以互刷電梯，這不是睜眼説瞎話嗎？最後也沒有給房卡開放互刷電梯的權限，衹是補了一張房門，讓我們乘電梯時自己換卡刷。前台服務意識真心差，敷衍了事，家人們，你們以後訂多個房間時，一定要堅持在同一個樓棟裏，避坑避坑。

服務：差評，吃早餐像過安檢一樣，不僅需要排隊驗身還要3道關卡審核孩子的年齡和身高，生怕被你混進去吃了白食，真是奇葩。我定了2個晚上為了方便特意定了含早餐的一晚房費1800多元（含兩份早餐180元一份，兩份合計360元），第二天早上去吃早飯，因為帶了兩個孩子服務員説加付一個孩子90元的餐費，合計需要加付180元，為了讓孩子吃飯我們夫妻協商以後決定一個大人不吃，把自己180元的早餐費讓給2個孩子吃，結束服務人員説不行，必須再交90元一個孩子的早餐費，我就納悶我一個大人180元的早餐讓給孩子90一個人2個孩子不是正好180元。這個酒店也太想賺錢了，非要説大人的180元衹能讓一個小孩子，我就算不通這個賬了，最後不得已最後付了90元。我以為希爾頓五星酒店早餐費這麼貴總應該吃的不錯，結果大失所望，不僅品總少，食物味道還差，還不如普通3星酒店的早餐。
設施：五星國際連鎖酒店希爾頓房間裏面的礦泉水盡然用的是1元一瓶的純悦，好歹人家快捷酒店還用1.5元的農夫山泉。另酒店冰箱裏麪一瓶飲料也沒有，放了個空冰箱，難道是擺設。我住過很多五星酒店，人家飲料都免費喝。關於所有洗漱用品多是固定死的，生怕明天退房給你拿走，我在泡澡洗頭膏和沐浴露還需要讓老婆去淋浴房擠到手了帶過來，如果一個人住呢？誰給你用手接過來，既然你要把它固定死難道你就不能各個地方都固定一套？

硬件:
優點:1.床頭閲讀燈的設計不錯；
        2.觀海景的陽台真的很棒，如果再配個墊腳凳和小餐桌就完美了；
        3.房間面積要大一點；
缺點:1.洗手枱下邊沒有垃圾桶，衹有個臟毛巾簍；
        2.洗髮水衹有浴室配備了，洗手枱沒有，所以早上衹洗頭不洗澡的很麻煩；
        3.配備的棉拖鞋太拉跨了，用料嚴重不足啊；
服務:
       相對偏商務的君悦，還是希爾頓接待熱情，典型的度假酒店，帶娃來這裏不會錯。
       兩家酒店都是下樓即下海，但周邊配套區別很大:星海廣場商業化更濃，周邊娛樂和餐飲選擇遠遠多餘希爾頓，但比自然風光的話，尤其是海景和沙灘，希爾頓完勝，所以，帶孩子來沙灘“挖呀挖呀挖的“，準沒錯。
       早餐還行吧，麪包比不上君悦，目前沒覺得哪個酒店的早餐麪包能幹過凱悦旗下酒店的。
       綜上，本店是觀海和帶娃的上選。旁邊有個發現王國也是加分。
       另外，希望酒店能提升下本店餐廳服務人員工裝的款式和質感，注意點酒店形象，好歹你也是個五星級酒店。

    先説好的，風景無敵，海景房贊🉑
    然後是一些差強人意的地方！💢我7/4一點半左右到，大堂亂糟糟一片，吵的不行，後來發現可能有活動或表演，（看到化表演裝的小孩），辦入住無與倫比的慢，在我吃了一頓麥當勞外賣後，三點後了還不能入住我訂的房間，最後説給我換房間，老的小的都累了，衹能接受。
   到房間發現小床很明顯的黃色污漬，大概一元硬幣大小，靠近枕頭下面的位置，很顯眼，叫了客房服務換床單，對方也一直打招呼説他工作失誤，我也沒説啥，換了就行🙃
   退房時最起碼排隊半小時起，隊伍不動的，排在前面的其他顧客（等了一個小時）投訴了才來了一個員工收房卡，確認我們有沒有使用其他收費的東西，就讓我們直接走了
  友情提醒，如果你也像我大連遊裏來到金石灘要過夜的，先住金石灘再住大連，可以少很多回頭路，畢竟這裏吃的真的很少，酒店餐廳不太好吃，包括早餐，餐廳還收服務費，大家還是叫外賣吧，或者出去吃

不足之處：
1.作為親子酒店招牌，沒有提供嬰兒車，大連同級別標準的五星酒店其它品牌就有提供，嬰兒床衹有90cm以內的，同等級別的五星級酒店可以提供兩種尺寸90&120cm，這點很失望
2.不理解check in時間為什麼是15:00？這麼牛？
3.既然要15:00才能辦理入住，為什麼衹有2位前台員工在辦，而且有一位正在給團隊辦理，大家都在等候，非常不合理，可以理解旅遊旺季排隊現象，但商家必須拿出態度，繁忙時間段最起碼要前台所有電腦前都有人幫忙辦理，酒店內員工自行解決人手問題，個人認為後台酒店銷售也可以到前台支援，其實最多每天就2個小時最繁忙
3.游泳館女賓負責更衣室的阿姨，我問她裏面有沒有1米以下小孩能玩的池子，阿姨説她從未進去過，衹知道有很多小孩子進去玩,但不知道有沒有小童池……這個很無語

msg:魯能希爾頓，這是魯能和希爾頓的又一次牽手，上次住的文昌的，總體來説符合怪豪華假酒店的水平，但有幾個建議還是要提一提：
1、關於行政酒廊。我每次入住希爾頓都會選擇行政待遇房間，但本次由於預訂的突然，所以寄希望於現場升級，在此操作過程中，因我們是一家三口服務人員直接推薦了三人間，同時説明這個酒店的行政房間均不含行政酒廊待遇，須另行購買酒廊待遇，感覺這樣的規定很是奇葩，想知道為什麼？
2、本酒店服務熱情，效率也高，但是服務專業度仍有待提升。舉個特別簡單的例子，叫客房服務要冰塊，給我提了一大袋子冰塊，把我搞得睜目結舌，難道給個冰桶不行嗎？一會化了哪都是水，麻煩的還不是打掃房間的服務員嗎？
3、假期人多，服務狀態難保，都能理解，但別忘了希爾頓的品牌以及您的職業，還望一慣服務水準。
4、室外西側海灘看出來是準備收費了，但願希爾頓住了能夠免費享受。
5、mini吧歡迎水果一概不見，為什麼？我定的房間不配嗎？想定行政房，又説行政酒廊單買（那所謂行政房是什麼意思呢），裡外裏吃相都不好看。
總體來説，基本滿意，但許多細節還應改進完善，望多向海南成熟度假酒店學習，如金茂希爾頓、文昌魯能、海口希爾頓等等！

房間很不錯，寬大舒適，床品也很舒服。但酒店管理，特別是餐飲服務做得比較糟糕。
行政酒廊的下午茶簡直就是亂拼打發下人，從來沒見過那麼差的！一點亂七八糟的菜葉加乾巴巴一片三明治➕幾塊餅乾，咖啡也很難喝
早餐亂哄哄的，門口大聲叫着號和酒店格調毫不相關……到處都是排隊、缺餐食和餐具，讓人很不舒服。食物品種不少，但品質很一般。感覺管理和五星度假差距還是很大的，入住、退房排隊時間也很長。
房間也完全沒有小朋友的用品。對於一個度假酒店而言，軟硬件都缺少度假的氛圍

msg:#大連金石灘魯能希爾頓度假酒店[話題]# #暑假去哪玩[話題]# #親子出遊[話題]# #獨自帶娃[話題]# 
    原本考慮口罩安全，不想帶娃出門，但在娃的忘眼欲穿中，便有了這一次的出行。恰逢週末，老公出差，我獨自帶七歲女兒出發大連，週六入住，週一退房，趕上暑假加週末王炸，對入住的金石灘魯能希爾頓有幾句話想説。
    首先原諒我沒拍酒店內部和房間裏面的照片，原因是酒店內人多到爆炸，不太好拍，而房間裏空曠陳舊，衞生又不太好，確實沒啥興趣拍，下面淺述一二。
1.因為到的比較早，所以將行李寄存酒店出門遊玩，大概晚九點回來辦理入住，可能是白天太忙，導致前台和禮賓部的員工忙到麻木……態度怎麼説呢，就是沒有態度，木然的臉上一片冷漠，也沒有什麼禮貌用語，入住後沒有介紹早餐和其他設施位置，整個入住過程耗費我十多分鐘，可我是攜程預約擔保，連按金都不需要付的啊，應該登記給房卡，快到飛起才對。因此導致那個被娃在發現王國遛了一天的我幾乎快站不住了。（可能是我太事兒了，但我並不覺得自己兩晚五千出頭的房費不值得更好的服務。）另外我想説一下，前面入住的一家人，兩間房，因為到的晚，不能安排同樓層，不知道他們是不是同一個名字訂過來的，即便不是同一名字，專業的酒店預訂也會有相應的標識代表他們是一起的，酒店下午三點才給入住，400多間房滿房工作量巨大，不更應該有專業房控後台分配好房間，根據客人特殊需求，和團隊合理分配嗎？搞不懂，覺得真混亂。
2.進到房間，第一感覺是空，第二感覺就是衞生，嗯…… 地上有沙子，洗手間門口有餅乾屑，櫃子上有上一個小朋友的亮晶晶貼紙，洗手枱上有水垢，備品皮盒子上有水印，床頭櫃上無紙巾盒（第二天補上了），無小方巾（第二天也補上了），浴缸裏有沙子，淋浴間牆壁角落有黃色年久未經處理的黃色污垢，遙控器、電話上有灰，還挺厚[失望R]，我不是故意找茬兒，我説得都是不經意看到的。
3.因為帶了孩子，跟前台要了小童洗漱用品和拖鞋，送的挺快，房務大姐態度也挺好，但是第一次衹拿了牙刷，來了我要拖鞋，她説忘了，又送了第二次。我叮囑帶個小童浴袍，可是沒給我，原本我以為是沒有，可當我看到別的小朋友穿着的時候，我意識到，她就是沒給我，連一句解釋都沒有。
4.要求酒店給我做浴缸消毒，計劃讓小朋友在裏面玩一會，可當我看到房務大姐左手一瓶全能葯水，右手一塊看不出顏色的抹布出現在我房間之後，我立刻放棄了這個想法。正常客房部的臨時清潔不是應該有個提籃放工具的嗎？
5.我拖着疲憊的身軀，好不容易把孩子塞進了淋浴間，打開淋浴頭，眼看着地上積水一點點沒過我的腳面，孩子頭髮上還有護髮素沒沖，我深深的絕望了。地漏不好用！趕緊打電話給服務中心報修，母女二人瑟瑟發抖披上了浴袍，等待工作人員。短暫的處理之後，恢復正常，工程師傅用掉了我的牙刷清理下水道，又補給我一個，但是不知道是不是師傅的手比較濕，牙刷包裝都濕掉了。淋浴間門口地巾也濕了，工作人員穿鞋踩在上面，也沒人説幫我換一下……
6.第二天早晨，發現淋浴間隔壁馬桶間地上全是水，以為頭天晚上地漏堵水溢出來就沒在意，後來當天晚上洗澡後，地上又一大攤水，我覺得應該是淋浴間的玻璃隔斷漏水的問題。不知道酒店在不在意這個問題，要知道酒店拖鞋的泡沫底沾水在地磚上滑得很，也許摔傷了哪個倒黴蛋，他們就會重視了。不過酒店應該有公眾責任險之類的，大不了保險賠錢唄～
7.講講早餐。度假酒店就餐高峯期早餐排隊我是見過的，也能接受。人太多，服務打折，餐區衞生亂一點我也理解。酒店旺季，大量啟用臨時工作人員，也是常規操作。但是，人員再臨時，操作標準不臨時啊，總要基礎培訓一下啊。東西在哪，位置在哪，工作人員一問三不知…… 吃的沒啥好説的，品質種類就那麼回事兒吧。炸物一定是過夜準備的，因為沒有哪個是脆脆的，東北話講就是返皮了；沙拉台種類少得可憐，衹有一種綠葉菜，我住高星酒店從來沒見過這麼窮酸的沙拉台！冰桶裏的冰是碎冰，不是塊冰，夾都夾不起來。我的認知裏這種類型的冰是堆在枱麪給蔬果保鮮的，不是加在飲料裏的，也不知道這個冰接的水源是凈化過濾水不。還有，兩三千一晚的房費，將近200門市價的早餐，餃子是要單獨收費的[鄙視R]……
     我旅遊出行，願意把支出大頭花費在住宿上，所以我住過一些五星級酒店，國際聯號和國內品牌都有，就房價和酒店品質來説，這錢花得我心不甘情不願[捂臉R]

2.旅遊旺季來的，五星級酒店每天都亂的像菜市場，房間門不隔音。兩天的早餐每天都要排隊，説白了就是酒店餐位承擔不了旺季人數，那乾脆少賣點兒房間，住這麼多酒店，什麼等級的都有，第一次早餐站一堆人排隊，而且，好不容易排上隊，服務員往裡帶人，都根本不知道往哪走，沒頭蒼蠅似的轉半天，是每年旺季新招人是吧
3.酒店中餐廳味道很一般，服務費倒是收的不手軟，請問有事先説明嗎？
4.房間電視效果也就標清吧，衞生間化粧鏡耷拉着，抬不起來，衞生非常差，陽台上煙灰缸裏煙頭一堆，廁紙沒見過那麼薄的
5.酒店雖然看着離海灘近，但是在山坡上，每次回酒店都很累很遠，真不如沙灘往市裡走，溜達幾步都是吃的和住的。
6.被子潮的不行。
7.其實就是一個趁着旺季宰客的酒店，沒必要住

msg:非常不好的體驗，刷新我對希爾頓的認知。
第一次住希爾頓還是在三亞海棠灣，因為是國五，餐廳大，客房大，想着同是希爾頓品牌，應該也差不到哪裡去，何況冬天淡季價格畢竟比三亞高出不少。
1.客房不暖和：窗户都結冰了，注意不是上霧哦，是結冰。空調半個小時温度上不去。工程部來測就説出風口沒問題，拿了個電暖氣讓你用。

2.五星酒店用冰露，用雀巢三合一速溶咖啡，就是希爾頓歡朋都開始訂製掛耳了，正牌希爾頓用雀巢速溶，你的良心不會痛嗎？

3.餐廳不讓打包。打包也需要協商很久。
首先我父母房間付的是雙份早餐，我父親腰傷不能久坐，坐輪椅不好推，去餐廳路途遙遠。我母親想要打包，國內大大小小五星住了不少，第一次遇到讓我簽協議的。免責協議。吃出任何問題與店家無關。並説説衹能給我打包水果。
攜程上帶不帶早餐房費差了三百多，你們標價198一位的早餐，我想問問我在外邊能買多少水果。
服務員最終在我媽“苦苦哀求”下，算是打了，態度極其不耐煩，我就是沒功夫去找經理説道説道。我這是來住店吶是來受氣啊

3.早餐水平完全是根據住店率，比如我大年初二還能吃到羊排，還有帶牛肉塊的牛肉麪，但是初三人多了 就沒有羊排 ，變成雞肉。初四連牛肉麪都沒有，説衹有熱湯麪。初五熱菜裏基本都是炒菜花啊，胡蘿蔔燉白蘿蔔。是，人多你怕賠，你讓連住四天的客人怎麼看待。而且兩咖啡機第二天還壞一個，十個人排隊，沒人來管，服務員的確都很努力的撿盤子和碗，但是忙不到點上。

4.晚上整宿走廊放很吵的音樂（4樓哈），第二晚我老公忍無可忍找的服務員，可算是關了音樂。

5.小童區沒什麼玩應。然後酒店春節辦了很多親子活動，但是大部分需要在西餐廳消費，變相拉動經濟嗎。不需要在西餐廳消費的手工活動，居然是淘寶5塊錢十張那種沙畫。你是大連親子酒店第一名啊。啥也沒有，怎麼排的親子第一呢。

我是從對面魯能温泉酒店過完除夕，想着讓父母看海來的希爾頓海景。
對面早餐也是父親住別墅，來回行動不方便，但是打包直接給的打包盒，客客氣氣的，也沒像你們這樣，免責協議，像防賊一樣防客人。

以上一切都是以希爾頓品牌去衡量，我住過三亞海棠灣希爾頓。我也住過日照歡朋。
你們坐擁最好的地理位置，最好的硬件設施，擁有勤勞的員工。但是缺乏換位思考的心，衡量一個服務員，是一直勤奮幹活撿碗重要？還是看到咖啡機壞了，幫着喊一聲工程部或維修人員更妥當。
我沒別的意思，衹是可惜了你們的資源。

msg:帶娃去玩，目標是不紮腳的細沙海灘，金石灘確實是首選，而希爾頓，則是首選中的重點。預訂時正值忘記，價格貴了點，但會給你超值預期的愉快體驗。
1⃣️愉快的開始，職員們年輕，帥氣，漂亮，養眼
      由於想去發現王國、拖家帶口上午10點多到達酒店，疫情防控措施到位，檢查詳細，本想行李寄存，下午15點正常入住，特別要提一下前台小帥哥曹開，觀察到我帶倆娃和長者，還有行李，直接辦理了入住，並針對預約酒店時輸入的特別要求進行及時回饋，接待熱情，業務熟練，推薦希爾頓會員加入時，顧客根本沒有拒絕的理由，説什麼都會讓人欣然接受👍
2⃣️房間温馨，海景宜人
    實際房間可以説比攜程房型照片更好，度假感十足，小孩子表現更真實，進屋的瞬間，高興的跳腳。開放式陽台制高點望海，絕美。
3⃣️早餐豐盛
     餐廳大，三大區域，分別放置了不同的食材，坐在哪裡都不會覺得遠，領班熱情，服務水平超好，一個眼神能讀懂你想要什麼。中西樣式和味道都屬於豪華酒店偏上。推薦一定要含早
4⃣️周邊景色無敵
從大堂面向大海的門直走，順坡而下可直接步行到黃金海岸，這裏區別於星海公園那種石頭碎殼，細沙，海岸延緩，孩子們光腳踏浪玩的很開心
再説發現王國，門口沒有半天票，哪怕快四點進去也是全價，裏面票中票消費的太多，通票可玩的都排隊嚴重，尤其是不到140cm的孩子，建議不要進來了，我們除了旋轉木馬，和夜晚的表演，煙花，啥都沒玩上。
5⃣️温馨提示
    酒店在高處，台階眾多，大堂在4F。乘坐公共交通來的，可能要廢步數了。最好滴滴叫個車。附近餐廳少的可憐，邊走邊逛找一家隨便吃一口的念頭打消吧。要麼在酒店內，要麼外賣（有**櫃。

總之非常推薦的一家酒店

2.可能剛到旅遊季節，自駕車輛可以停到大堂前面。3.大堂門口有外賣櫃非常方便。4.距離發現王國近在咫尺。總體評價良好，下次還可以入住。
缺點：1.辦理入住時間長，入住期間全程遇到的工作人員都不會主動搭理客人（當然北方的酒店本來也不奢望這些服務），至於服務生的着裝和語言表達不要期望過高。2.螃蟹樹的洗漱用品用完之後我的頭髮果然像螃蟹一樣毛躁。
非優非缺：酒店兩旁的沙灘不太好，岸上沒有沖洗設施，下海趟水要自備一雙鞋。
