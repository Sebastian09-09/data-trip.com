Every day, we were contacted by wechat by the very attentive and helpful Ran Ran who would check if we needed anything like extra bedding or to book dinner and activities. The restaurant food was fresh and delicious. Great place to immerse yourself in nature and enjoy a peaceful break.

msg:This is a great place to retreat to if you want a bit of seclusion from the outside world. You need to arrange with the hotel to take a boat inside. Once inside you are greeted with a picturesque view of the hills nestling around the FuChun River that drains into Qianjiang in Hangzhou. The food is exquisitely simple and local. The chef is definitely a five star chef. You can take walks, hikes and bike rides. There’s a lot to do but if you just want to chill out, the tranquil landscape offers plenty of that. 毛毛 was particularly helpful in settling us in. We are very grateful to 毛毛 for such a smooth stay. You can communicate all your needs to this delightful girl and she will be on hand to help at the hotel.

The restaurant has a rich menu for both breakfast and dinner, with a lot of choices, and the taste is delicious. In addition, I am very grateful to the hotel housekeeper Miss Chengzi and the head of housekeeping Miss Fang Xiulan for their thoughtful service. They have given enthusiastic, timely and effective help since the time when I booked the hotel and chose the right room type. They will reconfirm the itinerary and inform some precautions before check-in. During the check-in, they will also remind you of the various hotel activities and the time distribution of the activities in detail. They are very thoughtful and thoughtful, reflecting a high degree of professionalism, making guests feel at home.

Here, the beauty starts from the boat sailing on the Xujiang River. The four or five kilometers of waterway make people feel like visiting the Little Three Gorges; before the boat docks, you can see the lovely housekeeper waving and welcoming on the shore from a distance, giving people a full sense of intimacy. I came here three times last year. This year, I came for the first time and encountered the most beautiful a**osphere: a heavy rain, the beauty became the best Jiangnan. I had no intention of entering Jiangnan, but Jiangnan entered my heart. While being grateful for the beautiful scenery, I must also be grateful to the staff here: the housekeeper Ranran still gives people a full sense of warmth and intimacy, thoughtful and meticulous; Xiao Zuo in the restaurant is also impressive, serious and meticulous, gentle and generous, and professional in recommending dishes. Everything here is just right. I have come here so many times before and have never experienced travel photography. This time I encountered such a good a**osphere and must experience it once: the stylist Miss Nana is very professional in makeup and styling, and the makeup is natural and generous, and the photographer brother is also very good.

msg:I failed to grab the ticket for May Day, and drove for nearly six hours to get there. I stopped briefly at the Moganshan rest area to replenish some food and water. As long as you get to the Fangwai pier, you can choose not to walk a step, and you can call a sightseeing bus for transportation.

I was very surprised that as a resort hotel, you can have different ways to play in one day or five days. The main area of ​​the hotel can be fully played in one day, and the next day I started to explore the surrounding greenway. The greenway is flat, clean, and designed very gently. There is a scene at every step, which is suitable for all ages.

Thank you very much to the housekeeper Orange, who booked the boat in advance, opened the window for ventilation in the room, and left a watch before leaving, and he also sent it back to me enthusiastically. Everyone is very dedicated.

The room has two small courtyards, which are spacious and bright in design, and the bedding and pillows are very comfortable.

I helped upgrade to Tingyu, and the room is very large. The environment is too humid and there are many mosquitoes. Be sure to close the doors and windows and turn on the air conditioner and dehumidifier.
The disadvantage is that the breakfast is not up to the star standard.
The housekeeper Chengzi's service is considerate and timely, and he also helped to pack dinner from the restaurant and send it to me. Five-star praise!
When walking on both sides of the Sanjiang River, I encountered heavy rain. I contacted Chengzi and the shuttle bus brother came to pick me up soon. I returned in time and didn't catch a cold👍
The hotel travel photography was arranged temporarily, and it was almost eight o'clock in the evening. The photography brother has strong business ability and good guidance on composition and photo posture. It would be better if the camera could be upgraded💯
The afternoon tea provided by the hotel is also good, and it is very comfortable to walk along the river😌

msg:The hotel needs to take a speedboat to land, and the car is parked in the parking lot outside. A sightseeing car will be sent to pick you up, and then you take a speedboat. You basically have to walk to the hotel area. The cafe is far away and you still need to take the hotel car. Each room is given a free coffee coupon, which costs about 48 yuan per cup. The rooms are all in a separate building, and the dining area and the hot spring area are separated. The overall service can be seen to be attentive, but it is not a group management that lacks organization. It rained heavily when we came, and the luggage was wet, and it was not wiped dry, so it was dragged into the room wet.
The house facilities are still good, and it is very good in the deep mountains and old forests, clean, quiet and secluded. The hardware facilities are all good, hot water is available in seconds, the water pressure is stable, and the network is also OK.
Breakfast ended at 10 o'clock, and the young people said they couldn't get up, and there were not many types.
It is convenient and inconvenient to book a car, but it is acceptable, and there are many cars. The package also includes a travel photo shoot. People with mysophobia are advised to bring their own cosmetics. The clothes have been worn by many people, and the photos are average. Don't have too high expectations. The photographer is good, but he is very busy, so the photos are a bit rough.
The hot spring is not bad, with complete facilities. The lights outside are dim, so I soaked my feet and it was very warm.
The price of the hotel restaurant is actually not bad. 300 yuan for a meal is acceptable. The taste is delicious, the dishes are large, and two dishes are enough for two people. Moreover, if you order too much for the first time, you can save the dishes and help heat them up the next night. Praise! It's really humane.
It happened to be Children's Day. There were so many children on Sunday. After dinner, the outside field directly became the downstairs of the community. Children's Day also gave a doll for children. I asked my housekeeper Jingjing, and she immediately found one for me. The service was great. I am very grateful to the housekeeper Jingjing for helping to upgrade to the Lake View and Rain Suite.
The environment is great, 100 points for oxygen absorption✨

It is a little dangerous to speed up. It is recommended to add more city bikes). The view of the cafe in the hotel by the river is also very beautiful.

Lishi Jingjing added WeChat two days in advance and helped upgrade the Tingyu Suite, which is a single-family house with a small courtyard. It is very quiet and comfortable.
I experienced the travel photography provided by the hotel. As a senior costume photo enthusiast who has taken more than 50 sets of clothes in Panxxxfang, I didn’t have much hope. I didn’t expect that the assembly line service would unexpectedly produce photos. Under our picky and vicious eyes, we added three more photos. It can be said to be an unexpected surprise.
The hotel services are all good. Lishi Jingjing responded very promptly. In the evening, I asked if there was any fruit. When I checked out the next day, I specially sent an extra bag of fruit to take on the road.
The only drawback is that there are few restaurant options and the cost performance is not high. The price is almost catching up with the Bund No. xx Black Pearl. The main reason is that the taste is really not good, a bit dragging.
Overall, it is worth it. I plan to book a set for my parents next time

I chose to come here because I don't want to be crowded. The background of the photos taken during the May Day holiday will not be crowded.

Environment: The overall environment is green mountains and clear waters (but there are some places on the water surface that are polluted by humans, so humans should keep their hands under control). It is a place with more wildness. Insects of all sizes are inevitable. The hotel thoughtfully provides small fans to fan the insects. Of course, if the hotel's disinfection is better, the trouble of small flying insects will be less.

Room: The Tingyu Room I booked has a small courtyard. It has good privacy and a good experience. You can't add a bed, but you can ask for a sofa so that children can sleep.

Dining: There is only one Chinese restaurant in the hotel. The dinner products are very good, especially the native chicken soup and slow-cooked marbled beef, which are all of high quality. Breakfast feels a bit understaffed, and it takes a long time to wait for the dishes to be made. The Zhuyin Coffee Shop, one kilometer away, has a great environment, and the steak and cream mushrooms taste very good. It also felt a bit understaffed, and the reception capacity was limited during peak hours.

Service: The housekeeper Jingjing added WeChat one day in advance, and helped to solve various problems big and small during the stay. When I was studying marketing before, my teacher said: meeting the guest's expectations is called satisfaction, and exceeding the guest's expectations is delight. Then this time we must have been delighted. The housekeeper Jingjing can be said to be the most professional and considerate one in the hotels with butler service I have stayed in.

I finally chose Fangwai between Fuchun Fangcaodi and Fangwai, which seems to be the right decision.

The catering, facilities, and scenery are all great, and you can spend most of your day wandering around the hotel. Friends said they wanted to come after seeing it. It is worth mentioning that the service is very good. They are all polite and enthusiastic. You don't have to carry your luggage yourself, and you are picked up and delivered to the room. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the taste is very good, especially the fruits are many and fresh.

He declined the invitation of his classmate and the founding emperor of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Liu Xiu, to serve as an official, and enjoyed the life of a fisherman in the Little Three Gorges of Fuchun River.
The best taste in the world is pure joy
Leaving Yan Ziling Fishing Platform, we came to the last stop of this outing: Hangzhou Fangwai Hotel in Jiande. The moment we took the hotel's shuttle boat, this mountain and water suddenly made people feel that they had come to the Peach Blossom Spring described by Mr. Tao Yuanming: "When the forest ends and the water source is reached, there is a mountain with a small opening, as if there is light. So I left the boat and entered from the opening. It was very narrow at first, but it was passable. After walking a few dozen steps, it suddenly became clear."
After landing at the cruise ship dock, you will see the eight characters "In this square inch, outside the secular world". You can finally let go of your fatigue and give your soul a break.
For a day or two, you can take a hot spring bath or take a fresh morning walk after the rain. Children can also learn handicrafts. In the afternoon, I walked among the mountains and rivers with my wife, jokingly saying "When the mountain flowers are in full bloom, you will laugh in the bushes"; at dusk, the lights dotted by the water are the light that illuminates the return of the wanderers and the fireworks that warm people's hearts. Accompanied by the fried peanuts cooked by hand, we successfully solved a bottle of Longchuan Meidu.
There is a long scroll of Fuchun Mountain Dwelling by the restaurant. I think of Huang Gongwang, as the fourth-class southerner in the Yuan Dynasty, who finally had a great enlightenment after the ups and downs of the officialdom and completed the masterpiece Fuchun Mountain Dwelling in Fuchun Mountain.
Following the footsteps of Yan Ziling and Huang Gongwang, recalling the past and thinking about the present, the beautiful Fuchun landscape may be the place where their hermit souls return.
On the first day of work after the Qingming Festival, in order to catch the early morning red-eye high-speed train, we were fortunate to receive two umbrellas from the hotel staff in the drizzling rain. Giving umbrellas to others is a sweet gift.
The hotel's use of guests' good reviews as an explicit indicator of KPI is a bit superfluous. The hotel's people-oriented and attentive service is enough to win the favor of all guests. Special thanks to the housekeepers Duoduo and Pingping.
If you have other excellent hermit places where you can express your feelings among the mountains and rivers, you are also welcome to recommend them.

msg:Maybe it was because I went there during the Qingming Festival, there were many people, and I didn't feel far away from the hustle and bustle of the world, but Kaiyuan has done a good job in details. The scenery of Fuchun River has been unparalleled since ancient times. It drizzled for a few days, and the mountains were surrounded by mist. The azaleas soaked in dew were particularly conspicuous. Hiking along the riverside in the mountains, breathing the smell of green branches and green grass, it was worth the trip. Because we took a boat to and from the hotel, we could only eat in the Chinese restaurant. There is also a Zhuyin Western Restaurant not far away, but there are not many dishes. I hope that the hotel package can give restaurant vouchers. The price of the dishes must be not low, and the taste is good.

msg:The hotel that has been planted for a long time has returned after a sudden surprise, and it can be regarded as the floor tiles of resort hotels in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. Summary of saving money: Don’t come!
Let’s talk about the advantages first:
1. The scenery is really beautiful. The scenery is beautiful all the way from checking in to checking out and taking the boat.
2. The cats outside the restaurant are very cute
3. The toothbrush in the hotel is very useful.
I can’t think of anything else to praise, so let’s list the shortcomings:
1. I called the frontline phone number, but it was basically useless.
2. After the housekeeper has checked in, he uses the customer’s mobile phone to register a new member on the pretext of helping you connect to the wifi. This is very unfavorable behavior.
3. A teammate with inconvenience went to the guest room to call for a shuttle bus, but was refused by the staff on the grounds that the distance was too close. He strongly requested that he be sent away, and was even complained about, "It will be troublesome for me to reverse the car out."
4. If there are not enough small bottles and spare parts, please ask for an extra set. This is the first time I heard that I have to apply with the director. The reason is that the cost of a set is very high. Please tell me, when Park Hyatt used this thing before, I didn’t see any hidden ones.
5. After making a reservation for the dinner included in the room package, you still need to get a physical coupon to go to the restaurant. I was not reminded about this during the whole check-in and reservation process. I went back and rummaged through it for a long time to find the meal coupon in a big envelope, and the restaurant even looked down upon me. Of course, the dinner was also very bad. The fire went out within a few minutes of the fish soup being served. I asked the waiter to increase the heat and waited for more than ten minutes. I asked the waiter twice. I was very positive when I gave a fruit plate to other ladies at the next table to get praise.
6. When breakfast is full, no one takes a seat. Even if the customer stands in front of the waiter at a loss, he will only tell you to go inside and sit at a big table. The breakfast offerings are basically not delicious, and the resort hotel only opens breakfast from 7:30-10:00 on weekends.
7. You have to wait a long time to get a toothbrush in the guest room, and I have to confirm with you if you really want it.
8. The experience activities in the teahouse repeatedly emphasize that each room has an experience. It is difficult to leave a piece of paper to draw a picture, and there is no one to guide you when doing crafts.
9. The outdoor swimming pool is not open this season. You can pump out the water for maintenance. It is dirty and unsightly, and the sanitary condition of the hot spring pool is also worrying.
10. The hotel with such a high price is relatively new, the toilet is only semi-smart, the hair dryer is of an unknown brand, the suites do not have a double sink design, and the dirt on the walls is not very clean.
11. The garbage was not cleared after turndown, and even the mineral water was not replenished!
12. Rent a bicycle for 50/H, fishing gear for 168, and there are only four pieces of equipment in the gym. When you come outside, there are several paid game machines in the activity center. Even the fish feed is laid out and marked with prices. In terms of making money, it is meticulous to the extreme. , this energy can be spent on providing services.

It's really hard to imagine that this is a hotel with a four-digit price all year round. The feeling of staying there is just extreme searching. Maybe the cost of everything is as expensive as the spare parts.
In summary, 90% of the value of this hotel is reflected in the scenery. Other aspects of software and hardware are disastrous experiences. It constantly refreshes the lower limit of understanding of luxury resort hotels. It may be really beautiful to take pictures, but beautiful scenery can be found everywhere. If you don't want to be taken advantage of like me, please don't spend a lot of money to come all the way to suffer.

The real person is in the scenery and the scenery is in the heart. The butler-style service is very reassuring. Our butler Jingjing is very professional. ,patience.

On Thursday night, the hotel housekeeper Jingjing contacted me via WeChat and told me the parking and boat routes after arriving, as well as the boat schedule. After arriving at the pier on Saturday, the hotel staff contacted us again, fearing that we would not be able to find someone to pick us up in the parking lot. It takes about ten minutes to get to the hotel by boat. The scenery is really beautiful. I suggest you go to the second floor of the boat to see the scenery and take photos.

When checking in, Jingjing helped us choose a good room. The room was connected to the lake outside. There were four white geese walking around in the afternoon, and there was also a platform for fishing. The environment was very comfortable and comfortable, and the scenery was as beautiful as a painting. Listening to Other guests who stayed there also said it was so beautiful.

The interior of the room is also very tidy, and the toiletries are all from Le Labo. It rained at night, but due to the design of the hotel house, the sound of rain was the same as the sound of flowing streams. I slept very comfortably at night and did not feel noisy. Dinner and breakfast were on par. Even though our dinner was the included set meal, the dishes and taste were commendable!

All in all, it was a perfect trip. I hope I can come again in the future and highly recommend it to everyone!

She called us a few days in advance to inquire about the check-in time. She also added WeChat to arrange transportation reminders in advance. She responded to all requests when she arrived at the hotel. My father and husband love fishing. They fish in the inner lake from morning to night. They take the fish to the restaurant for processing every meal. The service from Xiao Pan in the restaurant is very enthusiastic. There was no bait for fishing, so the girl in the teahouse helped prepare bait and nest materials, which really touched the two fishermen. There was also a beautiful foreman who took my mother to pick mugwort and her son to dig spring bamboo shoots. All the service staff are warm and welcoming. My son said this was the most courteous and warm hotel he had ever stayed in. He had so much fun for three days! Come again next time.

Special thanks to the housekeeper Chengzi, who was considerate, arranged a variety of activities early, and sent various tips before check-in. The hotel's breakfast is very good, I like the egg pancakes and noodles. After the meal, I took the hiking energy bag prepared by Chengzi and walked while enjoying the beautiful scenery along the way. All in all, this is a satisfactory hotel with good service, great scenery, first-class facilities, and excellent bathroom supplies. It is a boutique hotel suitable for vacation.

The housekeepers were basically able to give quick feedback and were gentle and polite.
The most recommended place is the restaurant. The breakfast was unexpectedly good, with rich dishes and good taste. You can order dishes for dinner and lunch, which was quite amazing. Although a little expensive, the waiters were very considerate and replaced the empty plates very quickly.

After arriving at the hotel, the butler Jingjing has already greeted you at the pier. The butler Jingjing's service is warm, meticulous and thoughtful, making you feel at home.
For the first time outside Fuchun, I experienced the feeling of escaping from the world. There was no roar of cars here, only the sounds of nature. During my stay, I was lucky enough to see 🌈, and saw the intoxicating beauty of half the mountain with mist and rain and half with clear sky.
The Zixu pork in the hotel's Chinese restaurant is amazing and unforgettable. The hotel also provides various cultural experience activities, which can be enjoyed by adults and children.
Goodbye - see you next time. I look forward to returning to Fuchun Fangwai next time!

Hotel environment: Entering by boat, it really seems like you have strayed into a paradise. The entrance is a branch of the Fuchun River, and the water is cleaner than the Fuchun River. Designed by the China Academy of Art, the new Chinese style is very classical and beautiful, and every brick and tile is full of Chinese beauty.

msg:Among the resorts in Zhejiang, I personally think they can be included in the first echelon. Compared with Fuchun Mountain Residence, each has its own characteristics. The integration between Fangwai and the natural environment will be better, and it will have a sense of escapism. The new Chinese-style design is natural and bright, making people feel more relaxed. Mountain Residence is more majestic and substantial, and the supporting facilities are more upscale.
Environment: The hotel is located on a tributary of the Fuchun River. The pedestrian greenway passes by the hotel entrance, and cars can only park at the pier. With mountains on the back and green waters on the back, away from the hustle and bustle of traffic and horses, the vacation a**osphere is indeed in place.
Service: Each customer will have a corresponding gift to provide exclusive services. Well, this gift is not a gimmick. The concierge Jingjing who provided the service this time was impressive, professional and efficient. It happened to be my birthday and she helped prepare a birthday cake, which was a plus.
Guest room: Upgraded to Tingyu Suite, with 1 bedroom, 1 living room, 1 bathroom and 1 courtyard. The room decoration is not luxurious but of good quality. It has floor heating, dehumidifier, welcome fruits, drinks and snacks for free. The key is that the details are in place, the bathtub cover has been prepared for you, and there are about 8 bottles of mineral water.
Facilities: All the necessary ones are available. It should be limited by the number of rooms, so it will be relatively simple.
Catering: There are not many breakfast varieties, but the quality is the best, with fresh ingredients and good chef skills. The hotel also has a cafe that deserves praise. It is not in the same area as the hotel. It takes about 10 minutes to walk along the river. It is a good place to relax, bask in the sun, and watch the scenery. The only regret during the entire stay was the Chinese meal package included in the hotel package, which was rather tasteless. The dishes in the set meal were not found on the Chinese restaurant menu, and the preparation was rather perfunctory. Later, I added another dish and obviously felt that the quality of the dishes would be better. It is recommended that you simply take away this Chinese set meal, otherwise it will feel very cheap. The Chinese restaurant is located in the same area as the breakfast room, and the dining a**osphere is lacking. The service needs to go a step further. Empty plates were not removed without warning, and bone plates were piled up and no one was replacing them.
Hotel activities: There are quite a lot of activities, and both adults and children can find corresponding projects. There are a lot of books in the hotel lobby, and the seats are spacious and comfortable, making it a good place to read.

The hotel is very special. When we arrived, we first took a boat. The natural scenery along the way was very beautiful with mountains and water. We were also greeted by a warm souvenir at the door.
Here I would like to highlight our Lishi Orange. They contacted us before check-in and arranged a time to book a boat. After check-in, they have been very considerate and made great arrangements for us! ! ! !
There are many activities that can be booked after checking in. I chose to take a bath as soon as I arrived. I felt completely relaxed! ! ! !
I really recommend coming here on the weekend, it’s great to relax for two days! So happy

Butler Chunyan had been waiting for us at the pier for a long time. Thanks to her for this stay, in addition to upgrading our room, she helped us plan the food, drinks and entertainment. I really want to thank her. The wintersweet flowers in the courtyard outside the room were actually in bloom, which was a surprise. The natural scenery with water in front and mountains behind is what I like outside the mountains. Walking around among the greenery is a great enjoyment. The breakfast is a set meal, not a buffet. It's not bad to eat well, but the dinner set meal is a little salty. The hot spring pool that I missed last time was not missed this time. I had it all to myself in the evening, which was super cool.

msg:I made an impromptu decision to come here on the second day of the ***** New Year, thinking that there would be less people here, and the most surprising thing is that the hotel prices during the Chinese New Year are actually not much more expensive than on normal weekends. As soon as my order was placed successfully, the butler Chengzi immediately contacted me and informed me of the boarding time, location and other precautions. It takes about one and a half hours to drive from downtown Hangzhou to the cruise ship terminal, which is very convenient.
The hotel staff are very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to say hello whenever they meet. At the same time, we would like to praise our Orange Housekeeper. We stayed for three nights. She responded to everything and implemented everything. At the same time, before we checked in, Orange Butler turned on the floor heating and air conditioning, which was very warm.
There are not too many activities in the hotel, but it can be seen that they are carefully planned. They are very close to the theme of the New Year, and everyone wants to participate. The most impressive ones include making rice cakes, setting off fireworks, bonfires, roasting sweet potatoes, and setting off lanterns at night. The environment of the hotel is really good, close to nature, quiet and suitable for relaxing physically and mentally. It is so comfortable to ride a bicycle in the mountains and drink tea by the lake.
By the way, the hotel has a homemade hot sauce that is very delicious!

After checking in, I also carefully introduced the various locations of the activity room and the equipment in the room. During our stay, we responded to all kinds of questions in a timely manner, and even prepared a great cake for the birthday child. Makes you feel at home~

Environment: A very photogenic hotel. The hotel provides travel photography services, but the clothes are limited, especially clothes for babies. It is strongly recommended that you bring your favorite clothes when you go there. It’s a pity that I didn’t take the photo this time~

Facilities: There is floor heating in the house, so it won't be too cold in winter. The bathroom uses Le Labo, which smells really good. The faucet in the bathtub personally feels that the hot water is not too hot. If you want to take a bath, you still need to be cautious in cold weather. Since the temperature has been below zero recently... I didn't dare to challenge the hot springs on the mountain. I went to check it out before leaving. The environment of the hot spring pool is great, but for children, keeping warm is the first priority, so I didn't try it. The view of the outdoor soup pool is very good! ! But it’s only warm to the touch, so it will be great when the weather is hotter! The outdoor swimming pool has a thick layer of ice, which is also very interesting.

Hygiene: The hotel is surrounded by mountains and rivers. During my stay, I saw some small insects, such as beetles, which are relatively original. The sanitation work inside the house is very meticulous and very clean. When the service staff cleans the room, they will also mop the floor.

It’s worth coming to Fuchun when the weather is warmer. October should be the perfect date. You can also see the red leaves all over the mountains. I look forward to staying again~

msg:Overall, I am very satisfied. From the perspective of retreat and recuperation, the environment can be given full marks.
The hotel is located in almost the best location in Qiliyangfan. The environment is quiet and it can be said that it perfectly meets my expectations. Especially on the last day, I got up early to see the river fog. The Fuchun River with or without river fog is really a completely different style. It is worth getting up early.
In terms of service, Lishi Pingping is very dedicated and responsible. She tries her best to help me arrange all my requests. The staff in the hotel take the initiative to greet me with a smile. It can be said that the hotel has put a lot of effort into this aspect.
In terms of facilities, the size of the facilities in the room is very satisfactory. The configuration of floor heating and air conditioning makes the temperature in the mountains in winter not a problem. This is also an important reason why I gave up other Fuchunjiang B&Bs with better river views and chose Fangwai. It can be said that there is no problem. disappoint others
The only problem lies in the configuration of restaurants and entertainment facilities. The leisure and entertainment facilities may be somewhat incompatible with Fangwai's escapist positioning, so it is understandable that the configuration is not good. However, in terms of catering, the breakfast is very different from other similarly priced hotels such as Banyan Tree. It is far lower than my expectations. Many breads feel like finished products from supermarkets, and the dishes are not rich enough. Vegetables are often overcooked. It can be said that I was shocked; as for lunch and dinner, the hotel is located in the mountains. The only Chinese restaurant is not sure if I am used to enjoying the monopoly position. There are few types of dishes, the service is extremely slow, and the service staff in the restaurant are uneven. It can be said that I did not realize it. The restaurant is the only thing I am most dissatisfied with during this trip. I hope it can be improved next time.

The set meal purchased included a main meal. I chose dinner and one of the AB meals, three dishes and one soup. The portion was not small, so it was just enough for two people.
The next day, we participated in the hotel's free event - Chinese sachets. The housekeeper helped us get two places. My children and I had a great time.

msg:This is my first time staying in this hotel, which requires a boat ride in and out. It is very special. The hotel environment is very good, very quiet and comfortable, and the room is very clean and tidy. Although there are not many people, all the facilities are open as usual, which makes people feel... The feeling of coming home. There will also be an introduction to the stink bugs in the room, which is very considerate. I only saw two stink bugs during this period. With this introduction, I felt much calmer. The chef in the restaurant is very good, the breakfast dishes are very good, and there are many varieties. All the staff are friendly and no one is disturbing. The whole hotel is simple and elegant. It is a good place for vacation. As the saying goes, it is beyond the world and is worth recommending. Every time Each room has a butler. Our butler Cheng Zi was very good. He helped us with various arrangements and reservations. We skipped dinner on the first night because we were not hungry, and even gave us handmade baked snacks. In addition to the welcome fruits, washed fruits were given the next day. When leaving the hotel, Chengzi would ask if he needed to be picked up from the room door to the pier. Although the distance was only a little bit, he would help arrange a shuttle bus when he came back in the middle of the night. The shuttle bus driver was also very nice, polite and patient. It was dark in the mountains at midnight, so it was so easy to pick him up. The shuttle bus drove on a mountain road along the river, close to the mountain shape, so it was winding. It was obvious that the driver was very skillful. Because he was afraid of affecting the shuttle bus driver, he did not chat with the driver during the whole journey. The ferry is a different experience. I have already recommended it to my friends and will come again next time I have the opportunity.

The butlers Xiangxiang and Pingping provide considerate service from before check-in to departure. What surprised me most is that the hotel provides free dinner.

It takes 10 minutes by boat from the pier to the hotel.
This time I stayed in the Tingyu Suite, which is quiet and quiet near the lake, which is nice.
I experienced the craftsmanship in the set meal and made Chinese medicine sachets.
All three meals are served in the hotel restaurant. The afternoon tea included in the package is also available in the restaurant. All taste good.
In front of the hotel is the Xin'an River Greenway. We walked to the right for half an hour to Zixu Ferry, where the three rivers meet, and then headed back. In the afternoon, I walked left to Qiantan Station and walked to the pier for about an hour. I was planning to take a boat back to the hotel. There happened to be a battery car going in, so I took the battery car in and enjoyed the scenery along the way. Xin'anjiang Greenway is suitable for hiking and cycling.
The hotel has hot springs, game rooms, tea rooms, etc., as well as an empty mirror swimming pool.
The hotel arranged for housekeeper Chen Jing to meet him. Jingjing contacted us in advance and arranged the hotel boat transfer. She greeted us at the hotel. After arriving at the hotel, she took us to visit the hotel and introduced the package arrangement. If we had any needs, we could contact Jingjing to solve them. Thank you Jingjing for the arrangement.

Compared with Fuchun Shanju, the hotel's facilities are still much less. Staying for more than three days will make people feel lonely. Fortunately, there are green trails around where you can walk. Turn right after exiting the hotel door, and you can walk to Zixu Ferry at Sanjiangkou within 20 minutes. Turn left and follow the wooden plank road until you reach Qiantan Station, then cross the bridge to Qiantan Cruise Terminal, which can be reached in 45 minutes. Then take the hotel boat back.

The travel photos provided by the hotel are also great. I took a set of Chinese style photos, coupled with the charm of the mountains and rivers, the temperament is fully displayed!

Off peak hours, the hotel was so quiet that I could only hear the chirping of insects and birds, and I spoke no more than ten sentences a day. It was a pity that I had finished reading the books I brought with me, otherwise I could have stayed one more night.

1. The hotel uses butler service, which many hotels do not have. The butler Pingping took the initiative to contact us the day before we went, arranged our itinerary, introduced various activities of the hotel to us, and provided very considerate services, which made us happy It was a relaxing experience.

The three-person photography team is great, especially the photographer Zhang Tao, who is very good at taking pictures and guides the movements very well. , there are 3 photos for free, but because the effect was so good, we ended up paying to select a lot of photos. This kind of scenery coupled with excellent photography technology, the photos are really amazing! My wife and I are very happy!
3. The scenery in the hotel is really amazing, and the Xinjiang Greenway is quite long, more than ten kilometers. We went hiking, and we could spend a whole day staring at the beautiful scenery along the way.
4. The hotel room is very good, the design is large, and it is very relaxing. There are three types of pillows to choose from. We slept well on the first night there.
5. The locals are also very enthusiastic. Whether they are passers-by or Didi drivers, everyone they meet is very nice and leaves a good impression on Jiande.

In fact, the experience of entering the store by boat 🚢 is not bad. Not only can you enjoy the scenery on both sides of the strait, but it is also more comfortable. The battery car is still quite bumpy.
The scenery and location of the hotel are very good, and the short stay is not bad. The big lawn at the entrance is very good for taking pictures.

For example, for outdoor cycling, shared bicycles are too simple, and they don’t have the courage to sit on them after being exposed to the sun. An 8-year-old child does not have a bike of the right size. And you can also consider adding a spa. 😊

The hotel facilities are good, and the staff are well connected in every link. In particular, the housekeeper, Pingping, has a super good service and is responsive to requests. He helped those of us traveling with us to buy a special medicine from a pharmacy in the town outside. The hotel's Chinese food is very good, there is no need to eat out at all, all the hotel has solved it. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but they are all exquisite and of good quality. The room was specially upgraded for us. The toiletries in the room are very good. The mountain top swimming pool and various activities in the tea bar are very friendly to children. A resort for all ages

msg:The hotel that sails into the boat is a big highlight. Although there was a heavy rain in the arrival hall, it did not affect the good experience of staying in the slightest. On the contrary, it is the water vapor after the heavy rain, which is smoky, which adds to the mystery of the hotel. It is beautiful... leisurely... The butler who received us is called Chunyan. The hotel has complete hardware facilities, quiet environment and fresh air, making it a clean place. I like the toiletries with the smell of sandalwood. Although it is near the water, there are basically no mosquitoes. The children's favorite is the hotel's catering. The chef is very good, not to mention the fresh ingredients, and every dish can be cooked very delicious. Friends who like sports can do yoga. There are yoga mats in the room, and you can ride along the trail in the morning. For friends who like photography, it feels like a blockbuster with just one shot. Great! The hotel is Japanese-style, very clean, with many garden designs and maple leaves. In autumn, when the maple leaves are red, it must be more beautiful. Hope to keep that quiet forever.

The hotel room is spacious, all supplies are of high quality online, the complimentary minibar and welcome fruit, and the hotel afternoon tea are all great.

msg:It's been a week since I left Jiande, and I still can't get enough of it. First of all, they are all single-family villas with butler-style management. Our butler is Ranran. She always thinks about everything carefully. For example, we are 2 big and 2 small. Bed quilt in the room. When traveling, she always arranges the car or boat before, so that we don't have to wait a lot. When visiting, she always kindly sends me nearby items that can be recommended. The hotel is in the scenic area, not as lively as the urban area, but the butler-style service does not make people feel inconvenient at all.
To enter the hotel, you need to take a boat or a car, and you will see the beautiful scenery of the Fuchun River. The latest boat ride is 4:00 pm, and the latest car ride is 9:00 pm, so taking a sightseeing car in the mountains at night is very important for us living in the city. It is also a very different experience for people.
In terms of dining, there is indeed a restaurant in this hotel nearby. We compared it and found that the restaurants in the hotel are relatively large, with fresh ingredients and good taste. If I stay next time, I will choose to eat in the hotel.
On the first day of sightseeing, I put down my luggage and borrowed a bicycle at the entrance of the hotel to ride the trail. The scenery along the way is beautiful, so remember to bring dry food. The next day I booked a Fuchun River boat tour and Huludao rafting through the hotel. The hotel has a VIP lounge at the pier with tea, which is very convenient.

The breakfast is very good, although there are not many categories, it is small but refined. The housekeeper Ran Ran is very enthusiastic and hardworking, and all the staff are well-trained. Billiards is snooker, very new.
Disadvantages: The sleeping room is a bit small and cannot be moved away. The TV is vertical and takes up space. Because many people bring children, the "extra bed" service should be added. There were two outlets in the room that didn't work properly. There are activities arranged in the tea room, which affect the tea drinking experience. Unmanned supermarkets should be air-conditioned.
Although the swimming pool is good, but because of the parent-child hotel, there are many children. Adults and parent-child should be separated.
Generally speaking, it is worth coming, try to avoid when there are many children during the holidays.

It is definitely a big oxygen bar, a good place for health and relaxation. The room is decorated in a new Chinese style, and the layout is exquisite and comfortable.

There are empty withers and fruits in the boat, and the service staff at the pier took good care of them, helping us avoid the hot weather and arrive at the hotel smoothly. Butlers Ran Ran and Ping Ping greeted us at the hotel pier as scheduled. We are girlfriends traveling, and we have made an appoin**ent for travel photography, and we need to make an appoin**ent to pick up the photographer into the store. On the way, another friend of ours couldn't make it in time due to a child's illness, so we had to change the plan. These problems were solved in time with the help of Ranran and Pingping. I am very grateful to them for their considerate and warm service, and they also helped us take the trouble to switch to a more convenient room. Every time I approach them, I get a quick response.

The hotel is built on the mountain, backed by mountains and facing water, and the architecture blends into nature. We stayed in two types of rooms this time: Wangyunju Villa is recommended for family trips; Tingyu Suite is recommended for friends gathering, which has a private space and is convenient for gatherings in the same area. The hotel's meals are also very delicious, and the breakfast is very rich. For Chinese dinner, it is best to reserve a location and select a menu with the butler in advance. The hotel can also go fishing near the water, drink tea and play chess. Children can also have fun in the swimming pool.

I am very grateful to the two housekeepers, Ran Ran and Ping Ping, for their care and companionship, and when they left the store, they thoughtfully delivered the fruit to eat on the way. I hope to come back to this beautiful paradise next time.

Room type: The room is a bit small, and the relaxing feeling of vacation cannot be unfolded
Restaurant: Not many dishes, but surprisingly delicious
Service: The staff will greet each other, and the service attitude of the housekeeper Pingping is very good

Overall, I'm quite satisfied, but it didn't rain, and the whole section collapsed...

The hotel is secluded and quiet, as if it is outside the secular world, it is definitely the best place to seek tranquility, stay away from the hustle and bustle, and wash your heart and lungs.
Taking advantage of the May Day holiday, I stayed in the hotel for two nights. The housekeeper, Ran Ran, was very considerate and considerate, very kind! There is something on call, which is worthy of the five-star service of a five-star hotel. The dishes in the restaurant of the hotel are also very good. I have been eating in the hotel for a few days. The environment and taste are excellent. The hotel's breakfast is also very good, with a fairly rich variety. The key is that the quality is high, and the meals are fresh and delicious. Next time you go, you must stay a few more nights.

The yacht check-in is very ceremonial, and the 15-minute boat ride is just right to experience sailing for seven miles. However, the hourly schedule is a bit annoying. It is recommended to change it to a regular car pick-up, and wait for the hourly time if there is a need for a ride, so that passenger satisfaction will be higher.
There is a butler to take care of you throughout the stay, which is very humane. The housekeeper, Cheng Zi, has been considerate since he contacted her on WeChat. Thank you for taking care of me.
The rain-watching room has a small courtyard, one of which is the door of the living room, and the other is the window of the bedroom, making full use of the scenery. There are small doors for the shower and sanitary ware in the washing part, and there are washstands, vanities and bathtubs outside, which is very reasonable. I love the fact that disposable tub covers are available. It's a waste of time, different people have different opinions.
The price of the restaurant is worthy of the place and the food.

Before the trip, the hotel's Li Shi "Ran Ran" enthusiastically pushed the navigation address, as well as some hotel check-in details. For the next few days, Ran Ran has also been paying attention to our travel, nucleic acid, and dining lights. Thank you very much. In terms of check-in experience, Fangwai Hotel is indeed a good escape hotel. Entering by boat, the scale of the rooms in the hotel is not very large, so there will be no crowded guests; the facilities in the rooms are also very good, and there is a small bar for free. Evian, Paris water. There is a small episode that we have an elderly person who first gave us a room, but the second room actually waited for nearly 3 hours. I don’t know if I forgot or thought that we already have a room, and the guests behind all took the room. We shouldn't have to wait for the guests in front of us. In addition, the second room had a more musty smell. The front desk replied that the same room type was gone. ,, and finally upgraded the room type through Ctrip negotiation. I would also like to thank Ctrip. (It is recommended that the hotel coordinate the plan internally and then reply to the guest. Why does it have to be negotiated by Ctrip to solve it?). There is nothing to say about other aspects of the environment. It is a complete replica of Fuchun Mountain Residence. The hotel's food and beverages are well prepared and the price is not expensive. It is hot and we don't go out. We ate at the hotel for 3 nights. Often the waiter will take a seat. The service of the hotel is generally pretty good. The restaurant seems to employ some local people, and the service awareness is much worse. My wife wants to change a clean drink cup, but it was not clean when I brought it over several times. Picking it by ourselves makes us very unhappy, why doesn't the waiter have the confidence to pick a clean drink cup? The same waiter, because Yakult replenished more frequently for breakfast the next day, she was saying to other colleagues that she was "annoyed and didn't want to replenish", so she had no sense of service at all. Having said so much, I actually hope that the domestic hotel service can really improve the standard. Fangwai has such a good environment and hardware facilities, and if it is managed well, it can indeed be upgraded to China's "Hongxi Nuoya". Looking forward to the next improvement in all aspects

msg:"Between the square inch, beyond the mundane" ~~ Kaiyuan Group's upstart, the hotel is located in the Qili Yangfan Scenic Area.
The hotel is composed of villas and courtyard buildings. The guest rooms are all suites. The basic rooms also have a terrace and a living room, and the bedrooms, living rooms and bathrooms have air conditioning and fresh air heating.
The greening of the hotel seems to be original, but it is actually well-designed. The natural oxygen bar is a "wonderland" everywhere.
The minibar is free and updated daily, and the breakfast has been praised repeatedly by Mr. ^ ^ Fang Wai Li Shi Xiaomei has arranged everything properly, Xiaomei has multiple jobs during the peak season, and is completely a superhuman existence hahaha

However, I hope that the overall service management details of the hotel will be strengthened. The reception at the terminal, the front desk and the restaurant staff feel that they are not in the state, which does not meet the hotel's positioning.

Overall the hotel is worth recommending

Then he keeps recommending their upgraded packages for you to spend. He never responds in time when sending WeChat messages. It must be a request. Reply "No". You can still see strange men looking at you in the yard early in the morning. This hotel is terrible and the service is super bad. I definitely don't recommend it! ! The housekeeper’s name is: Xiaoya! When the meal was half-finished, no food was served, and I had to keep asking people to remind me. Comparing the current menu of their restaurant with the previous menu, each dish was 35% more expensive. They just lured customers into the hotel and tried to kill them. It ******!

Facing the flowing water of Xu Stream, a tributary of Fuchun, and backed by rolling hills, the buildings are naturally integrated with the green mountains and clear waters. As its name "Fangwai" says, there is a kind of paradise, a sense of comfort that transcends all things. You can enjoy the scenery outside the soup and enjoy the scenery, and you will feel this uncontested paradise. I felt a little reluctant to leave Fangwai, thank the housekeeper Duoduo for taking care of her, she is very caring, I will come back if I like it.

The natural scenery is very stunning, and it is a blockbuster if you take a photo of the green mountains and green waters. The room facilities are very new and comfortable. Even disposable bathtub covers and anti-mosquito water are prepared, especially the selection of free Minibars.
The management of the garden is very considerate, helping to coordinate daily cultural experience activities and round-trip transportation, responsive to requests. Every staff member encountered in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello. President Jiang is more approachable and listens carefully to the voice of the guests.
Among the facilities, I like the swimming pool in the forest on the mountain, which is very suitable for cooling off. The hotel also has a soup pool (more suitable for autumn and winter). The breakfast is Chinese-style, many freshly made (soup noodles, wonton and egg cake), and Jiande tofu buns can also be tasted, and the fruits are also very fresh. All meals are served in the hotel, the portion is large, clean and delicious.
I can feel the momentum of Kaiyuan Group to build a national brand luxury resort hotel, and I hope to further polish the service details and become the domestic Hongxi Nuoya as soon as possible.

🔔Service: Duoduo, the housekeeper, arranged boat transfers and various hand-made courses for us throughout the whole process, and also took the initiative to provide help and information, giving her a five-star praise. All hotel staff are warm and friendly, greet each other proactively.

🍃Environment: The hotel is located in a tributary of the Fuchun River, with unparalleled views. The rooms are hidden in the bamboo forest, giving people the feeling of an outdoor paradise.


🚗 Transportation: It takes 3 hours to drive from Shanghai, the whole journey is high-speed, and you get off in Jiande. It takes 15 minutes by boat from Qiantan Pier to the hotel. The housekeeper will contact you in advance, send the address, and arrange the boat transfer.

It is particularly worth mentioning that in the handicraft workshop held by the Tea Art Club, we made a sachet when we stayed in the hotel, and also hand-painted the fan surface by ourselves. The activities were novel and interesting. Sister Xia patiently guided us and encouraged us to do well. It was very happy and meaningful.

Sister Xia of the tea room, a tea master full of oriental rhythm, her voice is soft and gentle, and in the fragrance of tea, four hours of copying, time flies.

Although the hotel has only one restaurant and the menu is a little simple, each dish is a classic, and I can't forget the miscellaneous fish pot after eating it for two days.
The swimming pool and the soup, the venue is small but very delicate, there are few people, and we have reserved the venue for two days. The waiters are warm and thoughtful, and they give us tea every time.
I feel that the hotel attaches great importance to the guest's stay experience. Every day, I can see the general manager in the lobby in the restaurant, observing the guests' feelings and reactions, and asking them about their experience. I believe the hotel service will definitely get better and better.

msg:For the tour around the Dragon Boat Festival, I chose the Fangwai Hotel that I wanted to experience on May 1st. Before the trip, Fang Wai's housekeeper Xiaoya called me in advance to confirm the arrival time, gave some warm reminders, and added WeChat to facilitate contact. Facts have proved that many matters need to be contacted with the housekeeper in advance, such as making reservations for soup pools, making reservations for Dragon Boat Festival activities, making reservations for meals in advance, making reservations for boats, shuttle buses, etc. a lot of busy. One night I asked if there was a late-night snack to order. Xiaoya contacted the restaurant actively and provided us with rich nuts and warm purple potato buns, which were worthy of five-star praise.
Self-driving parked in the parking lot of Qili Yangfan Gantan Wharf. The hotel has an exclusive rest area at the wharf. During the peak of the Dragon Boat Festival, there are frequent boats, 15 people and one yacht, and it takes 10 minutes to reach the hotel. The hotel has an elegant environment, many bamboo forests and vegetation, and a chime performance as a welcome ceremony. Considering that the distance between our two rooms is not close, it is not in line with my prior communication plan. I hope to make arrangements as much as possible. The hotel manager Zheng immediately proposed to upgrade us to a double bedroom. It is a very warm proposal. We can go and see it first. Like it or not, here I am very grateful to Mr. Zheng for his thoughtful arrangement! It is really warm for us with two old and two young children.
The two-bedroom room has a living room and a yard, which is convenient for fishing enthusiasts. My two children are just watching the lake, watching geese, playing with water guns, and can also pull wild bamboo shoots, which is very wild. The rooms are equipped with a capsule coffee machine, a sterilizer and a dehumidifier. Because of the rain, the water tank of the dehumidifier needs to be emptied several times. Overall, there is no noticeable dampness. The minibar is free and the welcome fruit is abundant. The tatami bedroom on the first floor needs to be careful with the steps. The room on the second floor can enjoy the starry sky through the skylight. The two rooms are independent and each has a bathroom. There is a bathtub on the second floor, and children's products are readily available. The living room is equipped with a larger day-bed sofa and desk, with pen, ink, paper and inkstone.
The hotel is equipped with a gym, outdoor swimming pool and soup pool, as well as sika deer and goats can be seen up close. The large lawn in front of the hotel can set up tents for barbecue, but you have to bring your own barbecue equipment. There is only one restaurant in the hotel, which may be a pity. After all, the hotel is inside the scenic spot, and take-out cannot be delivered. Personally suggest that the hotel can consider adding snack vending machines, beverage machines and supper ordering services in the future. The Chinese restaurant and afternoon tea are of Kaiyuan quality, and you can experience the variety, richness and deliciousness. The hotel allows breakfast to be packed for children, and provides packing boxes for guests who arrive late. The breakfast ends at 10:30, and the staff are still serving meals at 10:00. Many five-star hotels fail to do this.
3 days, sunny and rainy. The housekeeper, the shuttle bus driver, the service guy, and the person in charge of the hotel, everyone can show the brightest smile and the warmest service. It's a worthwhile trip! I have recommended a lot of friends. For some people who are inconvenient to leave Hangzhou or the province, Fangwai Hotel is really worth staying at.
Between square inches, outside the mundane. See you next time!

Yacht transfers are required to enter and exit, and enjoy the green mountains and waters all the way, and feel relaxed and happy! The butler's service is attentive, answering any request and answering any questions. Although there is only one restaurant, the taste and quality of the food are top notch!

The surrounding of the hotel is very quiet and you can only hear the sound of birds. It is very suitable for bringing your family, especially parents and elderly people to play.

Needless to say, the scenery, the scenery of the three rivers intersection, surrounded by the most beautiful greenways, can be called a scene in ten steps, and every minute outside the square is pleasant. Unlike some hotels that only look good on the outside, the interior of the square is also great. The bedding and bathroom facilities are very comfortable, and the scent of the toiletries won me over. Coffee and tea are also prepared, and the warm cups and cool drinks make people feel the sincerity and attentiveness of the hotel again, and the price-performance ratio is simply outrageous. The little details add up to make people feel caring and warm, and they are reluctant to leave. Looking forward to meet again.

There is a long tea table on the ground floor, which is very comfortable to drink tea and chat. Two-bedroom suites and one-bedroom suites are moderate in size, and the way of enclosing the courtyard is quite good. The suites by the inner lake have the best views. The butler's service is thoughtful, especially after Duoduo's busy schedule, he has solved many practical problems for us. The hotel's breakfast is worth mentioning, selected varieties, carefully cooked, and satisfied with eating for three consecutive days.

msg:Kaiyuan’s high-end hotel is located on the left bank of the Fuchun River tributary. The scenery is beautiful and natural, and the villas are scattered among the trees on the hillside. Very private and quiet... suitable for couples and couples on holiday. The hotel service is quite attentive. From the beginning of picking up guests from the dock parking lot, I feel the service attentiveness. Especially when you take the hotel’s transportation cruise ship to the hotel pier, there will be a dedicated butler’s little sister docking service, and the check-in procedure is from the time of check-in to the room, warm and efficient. During the stay in the hotel, the butler's sister (Ran Ran) has been providing services on WeChat, such as ordering meals, transportation arrangements, reminders and arrangements for activities organized by the hotel... In particular, I would like to praise that when we left the store on the last day, because the hotel battery car was out of power (this is the negligence of the hotel management), the butler Ran Ran came to our room to help us carry our luggage and sent it to the terminal. I was very touched.......
The surrounding area of the hotel is suitable for walking, oxygen inhalation, meditation..., it is lingering.
Disadvantages: The bar’s location is remote and the interior design is unreasonable. The best view is the bar counter, where guests are seated at the dim internal brick wall (pictures 8 and 9), putting the cart before the horse. And the complimentary afternoon tea is simply tasteless, the dim sum food is not fresh overnight, it is better not to send... Even if the afternoon tea is sent, it should not be arranged at the bar. Such a good riverside tea house is not easy to use to attract customers. Sit down and increase consumption? In addition, it is recommended that the hotel's official website promote more good hardware facilities, such as the infinite swimming pool in the mountains, the waterside tea house, the surrounding trails, etc. photos and text promotion...

msg:I went to live in a three-bedroom villa with my friends. The environment is very good. It feels very good to go in and take a boat. There is a dedicated person to receive the reception, and basically she can reply in time, but sometimes she is more anxious when she is busy. Golf carts can't go out and pick them up at any time, unless you call them every time. The room is a bit disappointing, the three-bedroom villa is actually just three rooms in one building, no common area. . Had to squeeze in a room to play. Very unreasonable. . And there is a smell in the room.
Mosquitoes are unavoidable, and the overall control is pretty good. I was so disappointed with the breakfast on the first day. Because there are few people living in the off-season, we can only order bowl noodles, and the choice is very small. . Very disappointed. The next day, there may be more people and a lot of breakfast.
The catering here is monopolized. After all, there is no takeaway, and it is not convenient to go out. But the taste is ok. The staff in the tea room are very nice, you can sit and write calligraphy when there is no activity time~
The swimming pool is only outdoor, and the indoor soup pool is also very general, and there is no desire to go into the water.
All in all, very natural, suitable for a few days of practice, really far away from the world.

Ranran helped us carry our luggage, introduced the hotel's entertainment facilities, and gave us afternoon tea. She was very patient. Special thanks to the concierge Ranran for the two days.

msg:The overall review of the hotel is great, and it claims to be a seclusion, which the hotel really does. And the service of the hotel is really good. The service staff from all walks of life are very enthusiastic, and they take the initiative to provide various help to the guests, which makes the domestic brand rejuvenate. In fact, it is not worse than foreigners at all.
The design of the hotel is very creative. On the side of the waterway of the Fuchun River, you can only arrive by boat, which not only allows guests to experience the beauty of the river, but also creates a sense of independence from the world. When you get off the boat and enter the hotel area, the waiter is on the shore. Waving to us, and a little yellow dog running happily.
The hotel offers upgrades and afternoon tea to Kaiyuan Platinum members. Although the afternoon tea is simple, when drinking tea, it feels great to see the last gold medal in China's Olympic Games.
There is nothing to say about the scenery of the hotel. Especially in summer, there are green mountains and green water everywhere. No wonder the poets of the Tang Dynasty passed by Jiande and left so many beautiful poems. Fuchun landscape, Jiaxiu world.
In the evening, I tasted the hotel's special dish, handmade meatballs, which is a hidden menu. My friends in the future must order this dish. It is the best meatballs I have ever eaten. The rolls are very tasty.
The hotel's breakfast is all five-star hotels. The fruits are fresh and the ingredients are pure, especially the fried rice. It seems simple, but it really uses good rice, so it is very delicious.
In the afternoon, go to the outdoor swimming pool for a swim, and go to the soup at night before going to bed. The weekend time becomes simple and comfortable. You can also walk along the green trail in Jiande to the mainstream of the Fuchun River, and watch the wonders of the river going north.
The fly in the oin**ent is that there are too many people on weekends, and the waiters can't take care of them when they check in at the same time.

At the end of the journey, standing on the boat and seeing the pier of Qili sailing, I feel that I have returned to the mundane world. The hotel can go around, take some photos, the dining is quite good. The shortcoming is that the weather is too hot and I can't find a place to drink tea slowly outside. I borrowed a bicycle from the post station and rode along the Xuxi mountain road. The uphill can only be pushed, and the downhill is windy, riding to the place where it merges into the Fuchun River, and then cycling along the Fuchun River, occasionally encountered For the tourists who ride the same way, there are probably few people on the hot day, so it's really a quiet place. There are not many people at the station, so I can't ask how to have a battery car tour. It would be better for the hotel to provide this information. When parting, the housekeeper Maomao introduced here, the leaves change color in autumn and you can see the top of the snowy mountain in winter. I want to have another view. everything is fine.

The room facilities are quite advanced, all of which are Grohe and Washlet. The mini bar is free, and it contains cola, juice, Perrier and Evian, and it is replenished after drinking, which is good. A lot of fruits were delivered to the room in the evening.
There are two handicrafts in the tea room every day, and the children all participated and liked it very much. The swimming pool is small and can only be used for children to play in the water. I hope the hotel can develop more activities. In the morning, you can run along the greenway at the entrance of the hotel, which is very comfortable.
The boat to enter the hotel now is 6 o'clock at the latest. If it is later, there will be a courtesy car to pick you up. However, it is still a bit scary to walk on the mountain road at night, so try to come back early when you go out.
There are several good dishes in the hotel restaurant, such as Quanshui Fish Head King, Guotai Tofu, and Braised Chicken. Although there are not many types of breakfast, they are quite exquisite. Jiande Tofu Bun, Soy Milk, Freshly Made Egg Pancakes, and ** Noodles are all good.

msg:A bad travel experience. This hotel can barely survive because of Kaiyuan's reputation. The scenery is indeed beautiful, but the environment, facilities and services cannot be called a resort hotel at all. Those who want to come here for vacation may be disappointed. They spent 4,000 yuan to come here just to experience military training life.
The parking lot is a little far away from the pier, but no one drove to pick us up and help us with our luggage. We had to push the suitcases to the pier by ourselves. There was a shuttle bus at the pier, but the hotel replied that there were not enough waiters and we had to walk there by ourselves. , pushing the luggage in the bright sun, thinking that it would only take 3 minutes to arrive, but when we arrived at the dock, the attendant did not help carry the luggage onto the ship. Forget it. But 👇
Originally, the connection of yachts to hotels should have been a good selling point, but now it has become a barrier that hinders customers from traveling freely. There are no boats going in after 4:30 pm. The trails on the mountain side are under construction. If you want to go out for fun or have dinner or something, I'm sorry. You can carry your luggage and walk on the mountain road for an hour. There are no street lights but there are all kinds of insects. Snakes, birds and beasts keep you company. The hotel has not thought about the remedy of not being able to send a car to pick up the guests due to road construction, so it has decided to either rush back before 4:30 or walk in by yourself. For us guests, we have to stay in the hotel in the afternoon. Already? My friend originally planned to rush to the hotel after get off work on Friday. Fortunately, I checked in early and told him that there would be no boats after 4:30. He contacted the hotel and the hotel told him that you should rush over first and cancel the flight if it is too late. Is this what the service industry should say? ? If I don't notify my customers in advance, I will make them unable to leave in time, which will disrupt the customer's schedule. At that time, it will really be impossible to cope with the situation every day. It does fit the four words "Beyond the World", it all depends on one pair of legs.
In addition, the waiters at the fishing and other activity facilities in the teahouse get off work at 4 o'clock. There are no activity facilities here. You can only stay in the room or go to the hot spring. Oh, by the way, or you can experience a healthy hike on the 5-kilometer mountain forest trail. Remember to bring mosquito bites, a flashlight, and plenty of water.
The Tingyu suite we booked is said to be a separate building, but it is actually only separated from the next door by a wall, so we can see each other.
There is only one restaurant in the hotel. The price is quite expensive and the taste is average. There are also various small flying insects for company. The waiters don't care, as if they are used to recognizing these little guys as residents here.
Everyone who is going to come, please think carefully. If you are here for vacation, I advise you to stop at the cliff. If you are here to experience military training, welcome to come.
Finally, when I booked with Ctrip, I wrote that dinner would be free for two days. When I arrived at the hotel, it was changed to one day. I contacted Ctrip and got a refund for the meal.
By the way, the service attitude of the concierge is still very friendly. There are many things that they can't do and you can't blame them.
I only have one feeling when I come back: Never pay yourself to suffer for online publicity stunts in the future.

msg:The hotel is quite a paradise. When we arrived at the dock parking lot, we took a boat to the hotel for about 15 minutes. The butler Maomao had already warmly greeted us at the dock. The butler's service is in place throughout the entire stay, making the stay experience very warm. The room is spacious and all facilities are good. There are trails on both sides of the hotel for walking or cycling, and the scenery is beautiful.

The hotel's shortcomings are as obvious as its advantages. First, the public space is too small and public facilities are limited. There are only a few tables in the restaurant, and the smell of oil smoke is strong. Dinner seems cramped, and breakfast has to be queued. As a hotel that needs to be reached by boat, it should be expected that most of the guests' dining and leisure needs must be met by the hotel. However, in fact, the restaurant's dishes are extremely cost-effective. Even a home-cooked dish like crucian carp soup tastes like pot water. , but the per capita cost is 300-400, which greatly reduces the entire stay experience. Although there are often activities in the public activity area, the space is too small and does not feel comfortable at all. The same problem applies to facilities such as swimming pools and gyms.

msg:These comments are made in the hope that the hotel can improve! Rather than a mechanical reply, perhaps these are the experiences we have gained from staying in many hotels. No matter whether it is a designer or a brand, only by staying in various types of hotels ourselves can we gain in-depth experience among the people. know what you need
1. The most dissatisfied thing about the hotel is the overall management, especially the hotel catering service staff. The manager in charge directly deceives the guests, and the chef just leaves when the time comes? The order cut-off time of 8.30, even if you are one minute late, and I saw it is exactly one minute late, the communication before and after is directly deceiving the customers, which is the most unacceptable, and in general it reflects a Purpose, attitude issues, whether you can handle the problem well mainly depends on your attitude and cognition. If I drive here for a day, you can't let me order takeout, so why should I choose your Wild Luxury Hotel? The communication between the housekeeper and the hotel is still closely strengthened!
2. I will never choose this hotel again because of the two girls in the tea room! It is recommended to deduct performance directly! Make a punishment! Punishment will make your memory long. I won’t upload the photos, especially of a girl with messy hair and expressionless face. The customer opened the door and came in with a helpless expression. We have to get off work. You are the only one. Come on, while the customer is waiting for your teaching, you just play with your phone and don't care. When we were about to leave, I looked back and stared at her for a long time to see how she behaved, but she still looked indifferent. I was hunched over and playing with my mobile phone. I don’t care what you are doing. The other person kept urging me, when will I arrive, when will you finish? You can make aromatherapy in the entire tea room, and arrange the things on both sides. It's a mess, and it doesn't match the whole a**osphere. It doesn't even have the most basic sense of service. It's no wonder it's messy. And in terms of quality, on such a hot day, when you calm down and make aromatherapy, you must have a cup of tea for each person, right? Maybe this is all a luxury?
3. The hotel only opened in 2020, but the building is really old. The four-bedroom apar**ent I stayed in. If you don’t have a nice table and chairs, why don’t you just have a mahjong table? This is not good whether you want to take photos and post them on Moments for promotion or consider actual functions. I won’t talk about the overall design. There are many shortcomings. Look at Four Seasons Hotel, Aman, Relais & Châteaux and other brand hotels. , maybe Kaiyuan is only at this level. After all, it is not high-end. I have stayed in Kaiyuan hotels several times, but you still have to distinguish them, or make them high-end as a whole, so that customers who choose to stay in villas cannot have a total experience. Give the feeling of the guest room

msg:Kaiyuan's new brand hotel is worth recommending to Fangwai. The most beautiful greenway outside the hotel is very suitable for hiking, and the hotel environment is excellent. The upgraded room is a single-story Tingyu suite with a small courtyard and unique charm. The hotel's butler service is particularly good. Duoduo received us and was very patient. He sent afternoon tea to the room, solved matters during the stay, and made reservations for dining experiences. The service was attentive. The facilities and equipment in the room are very good, and I also like the decoration style. A very satisfying outing experience.

1. 管家服務：提前聯繫，安排妥當；必須點名表揚管家“曉艷”，有問必答，熱心服務；
2. 遊艇接送：碼頭準時出發，遊艇接送進出酒店，儀式感拉滿，更是欣賞富春江的好開始；
3. 服務：恰到好處的距離感，熱情不至於太過；迎來送往，路上偶遇，皆是微笑和問候，真誠，而非KPI的應付；
4. 設施：飯菜可口，早餐略擠；泡湯與酒吧相伴，服務員會提醒你先泡湯（預約制），再泡吧；小型遊藝中心可遛娃，但户外草坪，騎行（暫無小童車），帆船，槳板更是週末運動遛娃的好選擇；
5. 房間：都是套房類型，設施齊全，mini吧免費提供餅乾和酒水，歡迎水果一應俱全；香皂氣味特別，一種獨特木質的氣味；
6. 交通：上海自駕大概4-5小時，導航一定要多次核對，“七裏揚帆·乾潭碼頭”；富春江類似碼頭名眾多，易混淆，下錯高速可能就是1小時的春光；別問為什麼我知道- -！

總之，無論三五好友，還是遛娃帶狗，孝敬父母，還是情侶出遊，都值得你選擇！如果你還有個靠譜朋友，幫你鎖定優惠套餐，全程安排妥善，沖沖沖！

設施：典型的國產酒店，硬件一般，軟件配備挺齊全的。早起在庭院中瑜伽感覺也非常好。

服務：禮士春燕給予了很實在也很體貼的照顧，戒指弄丟了也很細心的幫忙尋找。

總體體驗都很不錯，餐飲和湯泉略差，值得推薦！

msg:很滿意，酒店環境優美，房型好，早餐美味，工作人員都很熱情。酒店前台的魏海坤工作很敬業也很專業，細緻周到。茶室的小姐姐也很有耐心。餐廳工作人員還有清潔阿姨開電瓶車的大叔小哥都很熱情周到。還有我們的管家萍萍也很盡責。但是船上接待客人的那個工作人員就是非常糟糕的。11月21日我們跟前台魏海坤説好了下午兩點半有班船去乾潭旅遊碼頭，三點回酒店。結果上了船，船上的這個工作人員説三點不回酒店，因為三點旅遊碼頭那邊沒客人到酒店。我們衹好下船。當時我是納悶，既然沒客人，你們那麼早開船過去幹什麼呢？第二天，也就是22日，我們又跟前台魏海坤説好坐九點半的船去乾潭碼頭，10點鐘回來。海坤小姐姐説我們直接上船就好。但是那個工作人員又説了前一天那樣的話，説十點不會回來沒客人。這次我們強調在前台預約的，他才讓我們上船。而且十點是有另外兩個客人回酒店的。所以我不明白這個胡説八道的工作人員是什麼心理。如果怕非酒店客人亂坐船，可以要求客人出示房卡或和前台確認。希望酒店加強管理，這樣的工作人員非常敗壞酒店的形象。

可以優化體驗：
1. 酒店房門增加個緩沖，現在開門關門過猛，感覺不太安全。
2. 酒店可以增加採摘園什麼的，目前酒店自有項目留白過多。

酒店的早餐很豐富，中晚餐都是在酒店用的，味道不輸於外面的星級餐廳，用餐環境也很不錯。
酒店配有管家專屬服務，會為我們安排接以及各種活動等。春燕小姐姐的服務貼心周到，給我們賓至如歸的感覺。

到店前短暫的溝通已經讓人反感到想要取消訂單。大部分工作人員並非在服務而是致力於説教和“改造”住客。例如，對餐廳座位上出現昆蟲的説辭為“這是大自然的生物”，此後也沒有將其移開或採取任何措施。真要感謝這位“聰慧的”工作人員，否則我大概不知道這是一種應該出現在五星酒店餐廳座位上的生物。類似的説教式服務不勝枚舉。即使硬件再舒適也不會想推薦任何朋友體驗。
湯泉需要臨時加熱，冬季天氣不冷時也無法達到使用温度。

msg:首先要説服務真的不錯，菁菁很熱情也幾乎有求必應，由於生態原因臭蟲不少，找人來處理也很及時（雖然作用不大，但能理解），不過平時房間打掃可能沒有很全面，房頂以及牆面偏高處都有很明顯的灰塵，會讓人覺得舊舊的。
早餐雖然東西不算特別多，但品種豐富且味道不錯，不過餐廳就衹有一個，連去兩三天吃早中晚餐多少還是會有點膩😶
酒店環境真的一流，置身其中能獲得與世隔絕的感受，酒店外兩邊的徒步路線也很美，人極少很安靜，整個身心都放空
最後説説美中不足的地方，房間裏的茶葉不能帶走，還以為這是包含在房費裏的（嚴格來説是服務人員説的是小罐子不能帶走，但茶葉是散裝的，雖然這是酒店的規定，但這點房費真的不夠負擔這麼小小小一個小罐子嗎），以及電視不能投屏

第五，環境，坐落在富春江支流邊，出門就是竹林鳥語，沒得説。
第六，設施，該有的基本都有，泡湯的喝多了沒去成不好評論😂

衹是可能國慶假期房源緊張，上一位顧客留下的糖漿味道還沒消散就領我們入住了，潔癖如我有點小小不滿意。但床品算乾淨衞生。
酒店硬件較好～維護得也還行。細節方面待加強～如果未來有機會，應該還會選擇！總體滿意。

如果酒店能提供更多的活動供客人休閑，更能錦上添花，滿足不同的需求。期待下次有機會體驗他們家的別墅房型

15分鐘快艇接到酒店，管家（朵朵）就在酒店碼頭向我們招手歡迎，安排小車接送，解放雙腳（僅僅幾步路，長者小孩又或者腳殘黨的福音）。

酒店由中央美院操刀設計，大堂別具風格，山上共有52幢別墅依山臨水，分佈有致。

【朵朵】每日貼心安排各項體驗活動，不重樣。（製作香包、體驗香篆、設計紙扇、拓印圖片等）。安排用車用船，不讓我們操心，太多的小細節一時説不過來，謝謝朵朵的貼心。

我們的入住體驗感很完美，歲月靜好説得就是這裏。或泡上一壺茶，坐在臨湖院子裏休憩；或在湖邊綠道散步徒行，行山水之間，彷彿瞬間穿越回古，住進富春山居的畫卷中，久久不願出畫[偷笑]。


據説方外一年四季美得不同，又期待來次了……

總之，硬件不錯，軟件和餐飲扣分。3000多的價格不會再去。

管家苒苒服務不錯，都在盡力滿足我們的需求，非常感謝。酒店大部分員工對客人都是很有禮貌的。
餐廳性價比很高，但餐點選擇可以再多些就更好了，尤其飯後點心如果可以增加些酒釀圓子這種中式的，會比較符合中國胃，果盤居然要收費，現在大部分酒店或者社會餐飲都會提供餐前或者餐後免費水果了。
早餐自助餐非常推薦，尤其是麪檔，料很足，手工麪也很好吃，現做的雞蛋餅是小時候最愛的軟蛋餅，非常好吃😋，早餐種類還是蠻豐富的。
房間這次升級到了聽雨套房，有獨立的小院子，安靜，整體的設施設備不錯，我非常喜歡進門處拱門設計。
整體入住體驗都不錯，下次願意再帶家人來體驗下。

服務：入住前酒店來加微信，管家是曉曉，熱情貼心。有歡迎水果，冬棗很好吃。其他服務人員也都很好。還可以預約活動，各種做手工，好玩。
下次還會再來～

我們在方外其實是在建德的最後一天，果然最好的總在最後。酒店的功能設計非常輕鬆、便捷，透着一股子愜意。整體建築和地域特色融為一體，彷彿文明生長於此片土地。可以看的出美院深厚的設計功力，藝術感充盈着整個空間，與外界又互訴心意，讓人從目到耳，從內到外都放鬆下來，度假的心情一下就滿足了。

酒店內有大片區域可以活動，漫步林間，或是在臨江小道上慢跑。不愛運動的也可以參加茶室下午的各種活動，臨帖、制傘、垂釣等等。酒店也有泡湯、泳池給親水的客人。可惜這次時間太短，沒能全部體驗。

房間設計以舒適為準，內外分離又相通，非常好的兼顧了會客和私密的需求。這是很多五星級酒店都做不到的設計理念，人性化且不刻板，非常自然、周到。

禮士苒苒的協助貫穿了我們整個留宿的過程，快速響應，全面服務，熱情又不失距離，隨和又不失尊重。我們大家都十分感謝她的服務，為酒店的體驗增色不少！

除了禮士苒苒以外，方外的另一亮點是餐飲。非常值得品味的菜單！有湖鮮、**、山貨等各種選擇，而且烹飪水平高明，四兩撥千斤的吊出食材本身的特點。陽光餐廳和菜品給了我們非常美好的用餐體驗。總而言之，我們在方外度過了非常快樂的兩天，希望在冬天再來一次，看看季節的變化，迴歸自然。

待改進的：
1. 健身房的設施可以再齊全一點
2. 入住時候對在酒店可以做那些活動可以有更加流程化面對面及詳細的介紹，比如，如果我們知道旁邊有一個14km的佔道，可能下午會有更加合理的時間安排。

從酒店出門，有喜歡的徒步棧道，總計大約10多公里，沿途會路過三江匯流，沿富春江景色優美，錯落有致。如果喜歡騎行的朋友，出酒店門右側也有租自行車。沿途初始段一側山花綻放，適合拍照。酒店裡麪還有不少小動物，三衹小鹿，一衹小羊，和幾衹鵝，適合帶着小朋友來一個互動。
酒店內有無邊泳池及泡湯池，適合徒步回來休閑放鬆。
由於酒店地理位置獨特，所以基本週邊沒有外賣，用餐都在酒店餐廳中，菜色不多，但是整體味道不錯。比較喜歡裏面做的黃魚麪，味道非常地道。

酒店實施的是管家的服務，管家小雅服務周到，能給你很多出行及遊樂的建議，微信聯繫溝通非常方便。

希望喜歡的朋友有機會也可以入住嘗試。

方外在景區綠道之中，此行與家人朋友一起，騎行徒步都很不錯哦。酒店體驗，用餐都很好，朵朵安排服務的很妥帖周到，茶室的官官服務熱情。安靜愜意的方外，值得再來。

酒店早餐特別豐盛，住2天有送2次下午茶，也是很貼心了。
略感
美中不足的地方：
一是餐廳上菜時間很長，差不多要1小時上齊一桌菜，有兩餐都是等不及把後面沒上的菜都取消了，大概是因為國慶假期的原因吧，但是菜口味還是很不錯的，餐廳服務員大姐服務也非常好。
二是酒店搞完衞生後，居然不補沐浴露洗髮水等用品，一個房間2天下來就一套，無論如何都是不夠的，打電話後服務員就送來了。但第一次遇到這樣的情況，略感不解。

説説不足之處：
一樓房間有這麼多台階，設計很不合理，晚上起夜調空調時摔了一大跤
草坪不平整，坑很多，腳扭傷了，第二天上午衹能房間裏呆著
餐廳品種少之又少，其他又沒地方吃飯，的確是種遺憾

位置很隱蔽，車子開到碼頭後坐船進來的。到了晚上碼頭關閉，酒店有電瓶車從七裏揚帆的步道開進去。
整個酒店很安靜一共就五十間房散佈在山坡，元旦期間都是住滿的，但不去餐廳和參加活動，幾乎看不到其他客人，非常適合希望能夠安靜的度假的人。

酒店下午2點到9點會開放温泉湯池，就兩個池子一個室外一個室內，但是人很少，我晚上七點過去和私湯也沒啥區別了。

最後也謝謝管家苒苒無微不至的服務

服務很好，感覺酒店裡麪所有的服務人員都非常親切熱情，不管手頭是否有工作，都會停下來打招呼，而且一點也不生硬，就像是遇到老朋友一樣，讓人感覺特別暖心；還有禮士的服務，會預先安排好我們的行程，整段度假就很舒服。
餐飲很好，我覺得在眾多同等價位的酒店當中，這家的口味很出眾了，非常好吃。
這家神仙酒店值得多刷，也會推薦更多的朋友來！

景色：電瓶車入住沿途就是自然綠道應該有的景色。聽雨套房個人認為性價比最高，獨立私密，空間也合理，獨立小院子也很宜人。到了酒店正門，就是景色最佳處，水景如油畫一般，山景如水墨畫一般，簡直美爆了！
餐食：早餐品種雖不如五星級的多，中餐為主。但勝在口味都不錯，肉包和豆腐包都是自家做的，小餛飩的湯底也是濃湯加點辣醋醬簡直完美。然後養樂多、旺仔牛奶、各種高品質水果都深得我心。午餐點菜，都沒點招牌味道也蠻不錯的，重點也不貴（以這環境和口味來講）。期間出去吃了一家叫賦春園，簡直不能再難吃，尤其魚頭。後悔沒在酒店裡吃，哭死！
缺點：可否早餐隔天換些品種呢？
除了貴是我的問題，有機會想二刷！！！！

幸虧管家姣姣提前安排了近水的房間，隔了一片竹林很清靜。
能看出來酒店是很努力想做好的，餐飲水準在線，早餐雖然品種不多但質量不錯。餐桌枱面容易粘水漬。
房間有一個bug，可能由於室內外温差還有入户門密封性問題，地板面容易形成水霧（圖6）

提前會有禮士來聯繫，幫我預約好了船衹等等，乘船進入酒店也是一項非常獨特的體驗，感覺一下就從熱鬧的城市來到了祕境酒店。
酒店的餐飲非常值得嘗試，都是當地的菜餚，沒有像黑珍珠餐廳那樣精緻，但是口味真的堪稱完美，非常好吃。
酒店房間面積很大，功能分佈也十分合理，設施設備很新。
泳池是林間的無邊際泳池，池水很乾凈，很適合夏天。
酒店還有室內外的湯池，我想冬天來體驗一定就很棒。
總而言之，這次體驗很完美，下次一定會再來。

msg:作為酒店控的我對於住各類酒店有着深深的執念，對於這次入住富春山居方外酒店的評價衹有用“完美”來形容。整體入住感受非常的好。
首先來説一下酒店的客房：客房整體的設計很好，類似新中式的風格，又帶着非常濃厚的古典氣息。我入住的房間面積很大，而且景觀也非常好，整個視野就很心曠神怡。強推平時工作壓力大的小夥伴可以來住上個一段時間。
然後我要來説説這邊的餐飲：平時也會去米其林吃，但是這邊的口味真的好，口味屬於建德當地，就一定要吃那個“雜魚鍋”，味道絕了。
還要説一下這邊的服務：之前我入住的酒店也會有什麼管家之類的人員，但其實就很雞肋。但是方外的禮士讓我刷新了對於專職管家的認知，就對接我的是禮士二英姐姐，全程熱情微笑，然後會主動來制定我的體驗計劃，走的時候真的很捨不得。
不要問我會不會回購，問，就是會！秋天見啦！

msg:方外位於七裏楊帆景區之中，需要乘船而至，新安綠道與胥江蜿蜒並進，環山圍繞。酒店右邊不遠處便是富春江的交匯處，清晨徒步綠道其中唯美至極。
酒店的管家服務很貼心，此行朵朵對接我們，幫忙換房間，預約用餐協調包廂，介紹景區景點，解決問題及時有效，服務親切周到，朵朵的貼心服務給家人帶來的美好的體驗。朵朵協調升級了聽雨套房，每套獨棟的房間，安靜愜意，夜晚休息的很舒服。餐廳的菜品美味可口，食材新鮮都是用心出品。
建議酒店夜晚道路的燈增加照明，臨湖的綠化可以更關注一些，這樣會更完美。方外不虛此行，下次還來。

msg:酒店硬件堪稱完美，服務卻是酒店的敗筆，不怪任何員工，所有問題都來自於管理者，硬生生的把一副好牌打的稀巴爛。
從酒店停車場接駁車開始，正常五星酒店都應該笑臉相迎，他卻板着個臉不願意幫客人搬行李，還甩臉子，不知道HR是怎麼招人的，真是給酒店丟臉，門面0分。
上了遊船，外觀很新，但配套跟不上，一小時一班船，硬生生的把豪華遊艇坐成了擺渡人擠人，要去的朋友儘量不要週末下午進出。
酒店使用管家制，其實很新穎，也很貼心，但是介紹設施不到位，感覺這是培訓監督機制不夠，建議實行客人調查問卷打分制，不要把管家做成訂餐小祕書。
酒店設計及園林堪稱一流，表揚一下開元投資部戰略眼光拿下了那麼好的一塊地，請的設計公司也顏值在線。
客房部：房內設施小細節做的不貼心，比如咖啡機壞的也不知道，空調不能冷熱調節，在這種暴雨天氣又在山裡冷的瑟瑟發抖沒法開熱空調，維修人員説要上報領導，我的媽呀不是客户第一嗎？開元的服務體系去哪了？設計空調的人也是不動腦筋。
餐飲部：這個餐廳就一種菜單，建議自帶乾糧，自助早餐也是每天一樣，週末會比平時多了養樂多和楊梅，整體廚師手藝一般，人均200左右，反正吃過一次不會再想吃第二次，餐飲部負責人應該要反思一下。
娛樂設施：游泳池泡湯亮點非常完美，避開人流高峯，吃飯時間去玩可以獨享。準備的塑料袋放泳衣也很貼心，梳子消毒櫃好像沒開這點要加強。
酒吧：9點我們就下班了，哈哈那還叫什麼酒吧？我覺得不要開更好，容易給別人詬病。
茶室：可以上手工課、寫毛筆字，拓印，還算加分。
總結：
硬件設施棒
軟件跟不上
人員素質層次不齊
人事部培訓要跟上
酒店經營者在這個項目上有點不用心，對底下員工管理也不嚴，同樣開元旗下千島湖酒店雖然有點舊，那服務可是讓客人有求必應，挑不出毛病。這就是管理者最大的成功！

msg:首先，出發前 酒店禮士小盧Alina 已經開始與我們聯繫，隨時提醒行程應注意事項及時間，讓此次行程已先感受到温暖，很棒的服務。
因酒店在景區內，需搭乘酒店的船進酒店且有班次的限制，最晚16:00 從遊客碼頭到酒店，需要特別注意時間安排。
到酒店前，禮士已經在酒店碼頭等待歡迎，從下船到房間及對環境設施和房間的介紹都很到位，有任何需要都可以通知禮士安排。
我們到達酒店已快到晚餐時間，禮士小盧很適當的提醒用餐時間及提供菜單供點餐，並幫我們訂好了晚餐。
酒店的環境很好，可以説是隱於湖山景之中，很安靜，對於平常生活緊湊的都市人來説，非常適合之地。
房間佈局很好，有單獨的庭院，同樣對我們住在都市格子房裡也有不錯的體驗。
我覺得這個酒店，每個季節都有值得去體驗的價值，也讓平常已經在都市中所累積的緊張，在這裏得到適當的放鬆。

唯一遺憾的是因為樹木花草多加上臨湖，蚊蟲比較多，不過房間有備驅蚊液。

總而言之，這地方來了一次還會想來第二次。
