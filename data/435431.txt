msg:The front desk receptionist 小祝 is very helpful and responsive. Appreciate for their fast response. We stayed for 2 nights, and the first night, we noticed that there are a stain on the pillow. Next day morning, we informed the receptionist for helping us to let the cleaner to change the pillow case and bed sheets as well. Sadly, when we went back the hotel, the bed sheets are tidy up but just the stain were still there. Meaning that they didn't helped us change the pillow case and bed sheets. We also noticed there were some smoking smells in the toilet as well.

Others were fine. Thanks 小祝.

Love the breakfast buffet spread! It was amazing, ranging from cold dishes to hot food. Especially the noodles live station, you get to curate it based on your own preference. Love their breakfast :) 

Hotel staffs were friendly and helpful. They provide simplified maps to ease your trip planning! It helped us a lot to understand the attraction and deciding whether to visit the place or not. Hehe.

msg:Staff don’t know how to smile especially the front desk, as though I owed them money or a favour. The one and only nicest reception staff was the tall gentleman. The overweight female receptionist and the crooked teeth receptionist both don’t smile and have an aloof manner, it was unpleasant. I asked for later check-out time and it was granted and in returned the staff wants a 5 star review haha. Then I asked why my laptop could not connect to wifi and she told me because it was INTERNATIONAL laptop, but my phone can. No further assistance was provided unfortunately. So if you are international traveler here for work, don’t bother staying here. For the price USD108, I could have stayed in other hotels. But there’s self service laundry machine and a tiny gym with smith machine. Walking distance to Hangzhou center mall.

msg:The front desk service staff小鲍 was very helpful!
We checked in almost 11ish at night. He was patient and gave us additional amenities as housekeeping was already closed for the night.

Breakfast spread is wide. There's a 'live' noodle station. Nothing like freshly cooked hot noodles with wanton. 

Good spread of greens fresh salad and fruits with other Chinese hot items. 

Convenient location.  There's 1 nice restaurant just 1 min down the road that serves till late. Their 'dongpuo' braise pork roast is really good. 

Another seafood noodles & porridge restaurant next door is great too. On the same row is a Lawson supermarket. 
Very convenient. 

InTime shopping centre is within walking distance. Wulin Square is a little further down the road. So is the metro station.

Everything is excellent except the cleanliness of the hotel room. First and foremost, there is a huge urine smell in the dry toilet area. We have requested for the cleaning lady to help to get rid & clean the toilet however no action has been taken. Then we noticed the bed we slept in actually has bed bugs. We have super sensitive skins (u may refer to the pic attached), we woke up at 1.30am to apply ointment due to itchiness :(

A special mention to the hotel front desk who went above and beyond: we accidentally left a charger in our room, and they promptly contacted us and even mailed it to our next destination. A truly cosy and commendable experience.

在杭州Pagoda君亭酒店度过了一个愉快的假期。尽管装饰风格有些过时，但酒店的清洁度绝对让人满意并且维护得很好。特别要提的是酒店的前台，他们非常贴心：我们不小心在房间里遗留了充电器，他们迅速地联系了我们并把它邮寄到了我们接下来的目的地。真的是一次舒适且值得称赞的体验。

msg:1) Very difficult to find a parking space. the hotel should guide guests about where to park. Very congested front of the hotel and no one there to guide you. It was a nightmare to find the parking lot. 
2)The service was pretty ordinary as they didn’t know which pages of my passport they needed to print. 
3) the AC in the room wasn’t working. I called the front desk, they sent a technician but he said it can’t be repaired and you’d better keep the temperature at the lowest and see if it helps… it didn’t help at all.. was sweating all night.. 
4) checkout was a nightmare as well. Too many people waiting in front of me.. I suggest the hotel should assign one person for checkout only.. I had to wait for 40 minutes just to hand in the room key.. 

5) I asked the front desk to give me the coupon for parking.. they said okay we did it in the system.. But when I arrived the exit, the system asked me to pay 100 yuan parking fee.. I had to call the hotel using the number on Trip.com, they sent someone and helped me go out of the parking lot.. 

6)I had to call them again after 4 hours of my checkout to please process my checkout so that Trip.com release my guarantee amount.. After they processed my checkout, I received the guarantee amount within 20 minutes..

Hotel was very nice, rooms were comfortable. Bath tub/shower and associated toiletries were all pleasant 
The hotel has a robot that delivers things to your door (outside deliveries/internal purchases). However, this was pretty hit and miss, as sometimes we would need to go collect things ourselves. That in itself isn't an issue, however for five stars, I feel this service should be consistent.
Breakfast was decent. There were some 'western' options (bacon and egg), but even the typical Chinese foods available were pretty tasty.

I live in Shanghai, so getting around Hangzhou was fairly straightforward, with easy access to Metro and Didi services.  It is definitely worth a visit to the West Lake and Leifeng Temple; the view from the top is amazing.  The hotel staff were friendly on arrival and the standard of the room was better than expected for the price paid.  I didn't eat in the hotel or use the facilities much, so can't comment on those, but I have no complaints; checking in and out was straightforward and efficient, even with the Covid restrictions.  Overall, highly recommended and Hanzhou is an amazing city, well worth a visit.  Just check out my photos; picture 1 is a the view from my room on the 14th Floor.

The service is very good. Seeing that we brought children, the afternoon tea was sent directly to our room, which was convenient. It may be the off-season. We encountered flight delays and we were given a late check-out.
Although it is not very new, the basic environment is fine and the hygiene is OK. The overall experience is very good.

He immediately arranged for us to stay in the morning when there was a vacancy, and there were additional child benefits for children with children. The breakfast was very rich.
There are two other points that I hope to improve:
1. The room is quite humid. I wonder if you can follow up to dehumidify the room.
2. The bathroom on the first floor is independent, and there is no lock sign outside, which often leads to people outside banging the door (although it is locked inside, but I really feel...). I wonder if you can add a sign outside, especially for the elderly.
In short, I will stay here next time I come to Hangzhou.

There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. When I checked out, I asked the staff and they said there was one, so forget it.
We changed the twin room to a parent-child room, and paid the price difference of 100 RMB. Because we stay in more parent-child hotels, we usually get free upgrades, so forget it.
The air conditioner is blowing directly on the bed, which is not very comfortable. After all, it is a parent-child room, and it is unbearable for adults to blow on it, but that's okay.
The parking lot is inside the Xizi Building. It is very small and there are no charging stations. Going up from the second floor below, even a stroller cannot pass through the passage and has to be carried back and forth.
The most outrageous thing is that when I left, there was a large puddle of water behind the trunk. It was urine! ! ! I don’t know what garbage man peed in the garage, and also peed behind other people’s cars. It’s so disgusting!
The staff were all very nice. When asked where they were going, they helped search for maps and gave gifts when they left.

The customer service offered to delay the check-out until 2 o'clock, which was very heart-warming ~ especially for the little ones. Pudding, told us the tour route and other details in detail.

First of all, the check-in was very smooth. The front desk Xiaolongbao MM saw that there was a baby with her and gave her a token for a gashapon. She won a small sachet that she wanted. There was also a souvenir for the baby on May Day, which contained a Rubik's Cube, which is exactly what she is obsessed with recently. The hotel's preparations for May Day are quite sufficient. The breakfast is good and there are many varieties. The restaurant has added more seats, and the speed of replenishing dishes is also acceptable.
The guest rooms are clean, with extra welcome gifts and fruits. Although there are not many mini bars, there are four varieties after all, which is pretty good. What is more special is that there are two types of shower gel, day and night, and the smell is quite different. I prefer the night one, which smells of wood, but it doesn't seem to match the smell written on the bottle. I didn't smell any jasmine and orange. Two suggestions, the bath products are all in English, and there are only two small Chinese characters in the lower right corner, which is not friendly to the elderly. They can neither recognize nor see clearly. In addition, there is no place to put the supplies in the shower room. Look where I put the razor!
In general, it has received rave reviews. During the May Day holiday, it has a prime location near Hangzhou Building and free parking, which makes it very cost-effective.

The front desk is a bit confusing because it is mixed with people coming in and out of other office buildings. But there is a surprise that there are several cherry blossoms outside the hotel that are in full bloom, and there are passers-by checking in here. The interior decoration of the hotel is generally good. It is arranged on a high floor to see the distant scenery, but the windows are dirty and you can't see clearly. This hotel should pay attention to it. Finally, the more surprising thing is that the breakfast is quite rich.

Service: The front desk is not very enthusiastic. I have express delivery for others to take away, and they are not very willing to help. They just said that it is not the hotel and we don’t care.

The entire hotel, from the parking lot to the rooms, was in dilapidated condition. Maybe there is no harm if there is no comparison. The Orange Hotel next to it is also better than this Bianwulin Junting. As soon as I entered the room this time, I already felt like leaving.
The floor is stained, the bathroom door is broken, and the breakfast is even worse. Not worth the price at all.
I was having afternoon tea in the hotel and I was shivering from the cold. There was no heating at all. The KFC next door was much warmer.
Advice to Junting Hotel Group, such a hotel will only ruin its own brand.

This may be a common problem in domestic hotels (Changsha and Chengdu have encountered this problem) (central air conditioning). The outdoor temperature is 20 degrees and the indoor temperature is 28 degrees. The very experienced person directly asked the front desk to send a floor fan. After turning off the air conditioner in the room, the temperature was lowered. I chose Hangzhou Junting Pagoda purely because my experience of staying in Chengdu in January was very good. However, Hangzhou is really far behind Chengdu. The facilities are a bit old and the buffet breakfast is not delicious and there are few categories. If you drive by car, free parking is good, and the underground parking lot is indeed not big. You may need to rush in early to check in.

I remember that when we first arrived at the hotel, Xiao Zhao, who was at the front desk (codenamed Tatami), was very enthusiastic and thoughtfully exempted us from the breakfast fee for the children who stayed for the next two days. Entering the room, I was very satisfied with the size of the bed. I ordered a twin bed. We were two adults and one small. A bed of about 1.4 meters was more than enough for two adults. Drinks in the refrigerator are provided for free, and water is also available, so you can drink whatever you want. There are also welcome fruits. My child said kumquats and longans are so sweet. There were many kinds of breakfast on the second day. I actually had fish noodles. What surprised me the most was the freshly baked candied haws. Haha. By the way, Xiao Zhao also gives us warm reminders from time to time, which feels very thoughtful. Give her a thumbs up manually! !

The room is very spacious, even with two teenage children, they all found it very spacious and comfortable! And the facilities are clean and complete, including a gym...

The dedicated butler and the small cakes are very considerate. When I saw children staying, I specially asked the robot to deliver two small gifts. It was a great surprise and I was very happy😆😆

Hangzhou is a great place, we will come back again!

msg:Four stars is already satisfactory. Although the feeling is very subjective, even a luxury hotel will have some flaws like the Wanbao Encyclopedia. This is what the real world should be like. Please forgive me for rating and evaluating honestly.

Let’s talk about health and environment first. The overall hygiene of the room is perfect. From the towels to the sheets, I didn't see any unpleasant details. Bathrooms and shower rooms can also be described as spotless. Although the hotel is not in the core location of the West Lake Scenic Area, it is within walking distance of the bustling Wulin business district and is full of delicious food. It just so happened that I was on a business trip, and the place of business was only fifty meters away. I was very satisfied with this aspect.

When booking on Ctrip, I saw that Junting's score was higher than that of the conference hotel, and the reviews were full of praise. I finally chose Junting. Maybe the reviews I read made my expectations a bit high. Standing in the hotel, I didn't find many traces of design in the hotel's facilities. On the contrary, they looked a bit old and simple. There were no ironing tools, no sewing kit, and the small refrigerator was almost room temperature. Drawing the curtains across the sofa is a bit hard, and closing the small window requires some strength and skill. Although these are not big problems, two or three items added together can still affect the check-in experience. Therefore, I cannot give full marks.

In terms of service, the xiaolongbao service at the front desk when checking in was very warm, flexible and warm. We were given the highest floor and included breakfast. It's a pity that I can't give it all five stars as I wish. It's not her problem, but I just want to be true to my own evaluation. Sorry. Other services were useless, except that the breakfast room was crowded early in the morning and the service could not keep up. The aunt who cooked the wontons went to work in the kitchen, and the noodle stall was empty. Then I saw an old man cooking noodles by himself🤣🤣🤣. The overall service is patient and enthusiastic to guests. I saw a cleaning lady trying to help an old lady who had lost something. She accompanied her to find someone or something.

I was satisfied with the one-night stay for the entire trip. Write down your feelings truthfully, hoping to objectively help customers who make choices based on ratings and reviews. I believe that any benefits the hotel provides to guests are sincere and can understand the guests' wishes to be truthfully described, and will not cause the relevant personnel to be criticized.

Where is the design? It doesn't even meet the standard of ordinary home decoration. Is this 5 stars given by Ctrip? Or is it booked in Hangzhou?

The hotel facilities and equipment are very easy to use, and the location is relatively convenient. Online taxi rides from Hangzhou City Station and Hangzhou East Station only cost about 15 yuan. For three people with luggage, it is more comfortable than taking the subway (although it is not far from the subway station😁). The housekeeper Meizi will contact you in advance to complete the registration. If something happens, she will also respond promptly via WeChat. It feels like they are well-trained and professional customer service staff. I forgot to take photos of the room, so let’s take a night view to make up for it 😂

I booked a deluxe double room for three nights in advance on Ctrip. Xiaofan, the lady at the hotel front desk, was very nice. She even gave me breakfast after I called for consultation. During the three days of my stay, she often asked me if I had anything else. Upon request, a welcome fruit will be delivered every day. If you order takeout, a small robot will deliver it directly to the room, which is very considerate and convenient. All in all, it was a good experience!

msg:To be honest, it doesn’t feel like a five-star hotel. The hotel is not a single-family building, but half of it is an apar**ent building (not the same entrance as the hotel). The rooms are relatively large, but the lobby, corridors, and overall facilities are far from the standard five-star hotel. The door of the room is relatively thin and light like that of an express hotel. The lock is an iron chain, like the one I stayed at in an express hotel when I was in college more than ten years ago. The lights in the room are relatively simple, all are downlights. The bath water is relatively large, but the water is drained. It's slow. If you wash it for a long time, the water will almost come out... Before booking, I read reviews saying that the breakfast is delicious. Maybe everyone's standards are different. It's very average. The venue is too small and the service can't keep up. The advantage is that it is close to Wulin Square and the subway station, making it convenient to travel. There is a robot delivering food, which is more trouble-free.

msg:There is a serious problem with the design of the parking space in the hotel parking lot. The parking space has an unlocked lock, but the sharp corners around the lock are very sharp. It is very easy for vehicles to get in and out. When we were about to leave the hotel, the tire pressed against the lock, and the entire tire burst immediately. The air pressure immediately changed. Cheng Ling spent the whole night waiting for a tow truck all over Hangzhou to find a car repair shop that could change the tire. He took the tow truck to many shops and finally found a suitable shop that could change the tire. It was so serious that he couldn't just change the tire. He could have gone back to Shanghai directly for a meal. After this operation, I didn’t return to Shanghai until the early morning of the next day, which seriously affected the itinerary plan and made the check-in experience extremely poor.

Advantages: It takes about 8 minutes to walk to the subway station, and it is convenient to reach surrounding attractions. When you check in, you can purchase breakfast at a discounted price. The breakfast is rich in variety and choices. You can reach the hotel floor by taking a lift and taking a card, which makes you feel safe. The room is neither too big nor too small, the bed is big enough, and the pillows and mattresses are comfortable. The bathroom is large enough, separated from wet and dry, with sufficient hot water and sufficient water pressure. There is a welcome drink in the refrigerator. The sound insulation is good and I didn't hear any noise outside the door. The staff is quite enthusiastic.
Disadvantages: The buffet food is not hot enough, everything is cold, even tea, soy milk, and steamed buns are not hot. The room facilities have a contemporary feel, and the cabinets and decorations are relatively old. In addition, because the air-conditioning is central air-conditioning, when the room next door smoked on the first day, our room was filled with the smell of cigarette smoke all day long. It was so smelly and hard that we couldn't sleep. Fortunately, the smoker checked out on the second day, otherwise we would have asked Change rooms.

Stayed for 7 nights in 2023,
Although not as luxurious as a five-star hotel,
I like the floor in the room,
It feels like home. I used to stay at Wyndham West Lake in Hangzhou.
It's a bit far from the West Lake, but it's acceptable.
If I go to Hangzhou again, I will stay there again.
The only drawback is that there is no swimming pool, so forget it.

msg:The service attitude is extremely poor, the work handover is extremely poor, and the customer care is very perfunctory. Traveling to Hangzhou, I saw that it was a five-star hotel, so I booked it. Since I arrived early, I left my contact information. As a result, I had to call the front desk after 12 o'clock in the afternoon to be informed that a room was ready. Because I was out for fun, I told the front desk repeatedly that I needed afternoon tea delivered to the room. When I went back in the evening, I found that there was nothing. After repeated communication, I was told that it was not delivered. The next day, I left my luggage at the hotel and left my contact information again. There was no reply for a day. After three phone calls in the evening, I finally said I had found the item. The manager on duty felt that there was nothing wrong with his work attitude. We went out for fun and wanted nothing to do. We just wanted a good service attitude. However, the staff at this hotel had an extremely perfunctory attitude and avoided the important. Moreover, the soundproofing of the room was very poor. It was not in line with a five-star hotel at all. I would not recommend staying here, even if it is a four-star hotel. Not even a hotel! ! !

Service: The front desk service is very good, but the restaurant service is not very good.
Environment: It is said to be 35 square meters, but I didn’t feel how big it was when I walked in. It was very crowded.
I don’t think it’s worth the price of nearly 600. It’s really a bit of a trap.
I suggest you find a larger hotel. This one is really not that good, mainly because of hygiene~

I finally returned to the hotel and wanted to take a hot shower. Halfway through, there was no hot water. I asked about other people on the same floor. None of the residents have hot water. The hotel's reply to us was that there was insufficient hot water because it was full of guests and they were using water for bathing at the same time.
I really want to ask which high-end hotel has so many guests that it can’t even supply hot water! How outrageous!

msg:Thank you very much to Miss Mei Zi at the front desk. Her service is warm and thoughtful, and she is responsible. She gave me a breakfast coupon, a fruit plate, and delayed check-out until two o'clock. Give it a five-star rating. The hotel rooms are generally quiet and hygienic. There are also robots for food delivery. The hotel's breakfast buffet has a wide variety of dishes and is clean and hygienic. The hotel is located at the southeast intersection of Zhongshan North Road and Stadium Road, a short distance from the Broken Bridge in the northeast corner of the West Lake. The scenic spot is about two kilometers away. It is very convenient to walk, cycle, take a taxi, and take the subway. There are relatively few parking spaces on the ground. It is recommended that you take a taxi to the edge of the West Lake when traveling with children. All roads around the West Lake are jammed, so it is not possible to drive. Walking is fast. If you take the subway, Longxiangqiao Station is very crowded at night.

I am particularly grateful to the beautiful lady Zhao Shi at the front desk. The service is really good.

There was a musty smell as well. Open the room. Weighs. Why is it like a hotel. Not only dirty but also rotten. If it wasn't for 3 rooms booked for 2 nights. I really want to quit. One more room for one thousand nights. Sleeping at night and still sleeping and scratching. Itchy skin. The only one that is OK. Just breakfast. Not rich. But it's OK! The location is OK! There are big shopping malls nearby. Not far from Wulin Night Market. Take a taxi. But I don't think I will live here again! I am completely sorry for the price and the name of Junting!

The customer service was very polite and sincere. We booked two rooms because we arrived early. The other room was not ready yet, but they arranged it as soon as possible. In about 20 minutes, they prepared another room for us. There is a convenience store and other restaurants across the street, which is quite convenient.

msg:My impression of this hotel is very average. From the reception at the lobby to the front desk, there was no enthusiasm throughout the process. I wanted to have a room closer to my sister's family, but the customer service was very indifferent. Finally, after discussing with the front desk manager, he arranged for me to be closer, but I needed to cross the entire elevator.
The size of the room is really not big, and it feels completely different from the picture description on the website. The pictures on the web page look like the hotel has a nice decoration style. In fact, after arriving at the guest room, the decoration is really ordinary. There is no glass on the top of the bathroom door. This door is like an iron door, and it cannot be closed and has no suction. When my daughter and I take a shower, we have to say hello to my dad and never come in. The entire guest room corridor is very low and depressing. It's not a dedicated hotel, it's a former business building converted into a hotel.
Much worse than the Junting Hotel I booked in Yangzhou.

I called the front desk the next day and applied for a free late check-out until two o'clock. Yes There is a man at the front desk, I don't know what the name is. Our family lived very comfortably. The breakfast was very rich, combining Chinese and Western styles, and there were many types. The floor-to-ceiling windows of the room just faced Zhejiang Hotel, and the night view was good.

Secondly, the room is big, the bed is big, the sanitation is very clean, and the bed is very comfortable.
The waiter is very professional and caring, and can deliver everything you need in time ~ because the check-in time is late, a fruit plate is also given.
I stayed here for a few nights, I felt very good, and I slept very well ~ a hotel with super high cost performance. Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will choose it again.

msg:The first time I came to Hangzhou, I searched for many hotels, and finally felt that the rooms in this hotel are more suitable for family travel.
⭐Many families want to live in one room when they travel, which is convenient for taking care of them.
The front desk service is good, but the breakfast service is not good and needs to be improved.
Room hygiene and environment are good.
✔Family room, big bed, good space, suitable for 3 big and 2 small,
The tatami mats are very well designed, suitable for children to play, and they are not afraid of making noise to the rooms on the lower floor. ❌The bed frame of the big bed is a bit loose, and it will make a sound when you turn over. I didn't sleep well on the first day.
✔The design of the bathroom is not bad, it is very clean, and all the necessary supplies are provided.
The housekeeper is very polite. What you need, it will be delivered soon
✔ There is a self-service laundry and drying service for a fee, which costs 8-20 yuan. Hangzhou is too hot, and the clothes are sweaty. After returning to the hotel to take a shower, you can wash the clothes immediately, which is great! ! Also, you can ask for laundry detergent at the front desk, which is pretty good.
(The little brother has a very good attitude and will not feel troubled by asking for laundry balls)
✔ Simple and exquisite breakfast
✔The surrounding area is Zhongshan North Road, with food. It is a 10-minute walk to the subway station, or it is more convenient to take a taxi. 10 minutes by taxi to Kerry Center, Wulin Square, etc...
Overall is good, friends who like quiet, you can choose here.

After finally checking in, the room was so stuffy that I couldn't breathe. The air conditioning was not turned on, so the window was left open all night! The most terrifying thing is the huge difference in sound insulation. I can clearly hear what is going on in the front, back, left, and right, even if I whisper, I have been counting the lights on and off next door all night long! ! ! I spent 500 and had no sleep all night, and I was really convinced! ! ! When I checked out in the morning and registered my license plate, no one paid attention to me. I stood there for 5 minutes and the woman looked at me and asked me what I was doing! "What are you going to do?" This is what a hotel receptionist said to me. I was really convinced! ! ! Probably never in this life! ! !
Protect yourself from lightning, sisters! ! ! ! It is not suitable for those raising children and the elderly, it is extremely neurasthenic! ! ! I stayed with many internet celebrities, but um... the noise was super loud😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬

I checked into an executive room in the early morning and found that the room was almost exactly the same as the deluxe room. I called the front desk and asked the front desk. The front desk vaguely said that the equipment may have been upgraded, but the deluxe rooms are in the opposite corner. My executive room was also at the end of the corridor. I wanted to watch TV in the middle of the night and found that the TV was dead. I called the front desk and asked someone to come over. The task of repairing the TV was handed over to an elder who seemed to be making up the numbers. He came over and told us that the TV could not watch on-demand and could only watch live broadcasts, and then left. The room was very, very stuffy at night. I wanted to turn on the air conditioner and go to sleep. I woke up in the morning because the room was stuffy and the room temperature was 30 degrees Celsius. Call someone to come over and do some repairs. Come over and tell me there is no air conditioning and ask us to open the windows. Check-in experience is very, very poor

msg:The hotel is in a good location, close to the business center and Wulin Subway Station. You can take the Lingyin Temple express line directly opposite Exit E of Wulin Subway Station. This time there were four people staying, so we contacted the front desk to deliver toiletries and other supplies. However, the delivery was missing the first time, and we contacted the front desk a second time to deliver it to the room. The next day when I left the store, I contacted the front desk to postpone the delivery of xiaolongbao until 3pm. The attitude was very good.
Disadvantages: 1. The sound of the toilet in the bathroom being lowered is louder, and the sound of flushing the sewer pipes upstairs is louder at night; 2. The sound insulation is poor. When staying on the 8th floor, you can clearly hear the beeping sound of the horn on the ground and the sound of the corridor; 3. The room settings are older and there are no free tea bags, only four bottles of Nongfu Spring mineral water and fruits.

I give a big thumbs up to the hotel's breakfast. There are basically no over-the-top dishes. It's very comfortable to eat, the taste is light, and there are quite a lot of dishes. For my friends and I, it's completely enough to choose from!
If there is another chance next time, I will continue to choose!

msg:I came to Hangzhou with my girlfriends, and after looking around, I found the location to be okay and the occupancy rate was quite high. I thought it was a designer hotel, but the actual decoration is just so-so, and there is a lonely building facing the other side. The tall trees on both sides of the door block the hotel tightly and always pass by.
After talking about the environment, I would like to talk about hygiene. The surface looks very clean. I felt my arms a little itchy on the first night when I went to check in. I thought it was because I was bitten by bugs during the mountain climbing during the day. It was red and itchy. At first I thought it was eczema and didn’t pay much attention to it. I lived for four days and it got worse every day. There was a large patch on the right arm, right back waist and buttocks. The symptoms on the left side were much milder. I felt something was wrong because I lay on my side every day. Before checking out on the last day, I went to the pharmacy and told me that it was allergic dermatitis caused by insect bites. I went to the front desk to explain the situation. The attitude of the person in charge is still good. He said that there will be a 20% discount on the four-day room rate, and I will be refunded more than 500 so that I could not give a bad review. I definitely won’t give a bad review for the problem. It’s been five or six days. He decided to eat it every day and sprayed it, but it still didn’t help. For the hives caused by it, the prescription cost another 500 yuan. After thinking about it, it is indeed equivalent to paying me for the medicine, but how can I compensate for my pain? A girl in her twenties has little red spots on her neck and arms in Xia Tian Clothes can't cover it, and it's so itchy that I don't know how many days it will last. I really regret letting my friend return Wyndham to live here. I really can't give good reviews or not give bad luck against my will. I want to tell everyone Everyone must pay more attention when they check in, and don't live in room 1207. I was bitten by lying on the left bed. Or your hotel should not only focus on superficial sanitation. Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas are perennially humid, so you need to regularly clean the mattresses to kill insects. I went to Xiaohongshu to check that my symptoms were exactly the same as flea bites!
(The first two pictures are the symptoms at that time, and the last one is the symptoms I have now after taking the medicine for a week, it is not so red but still itchy)

I heard from a friend that when I checked in, I still met the enthusiastic manager Wang, who took the initiative to add a friend’s WeChat account, and sent the surrounding food and travel tips to my friend according to the friend’s needs. This service is really considerate. After entering the room, my friend also checked every corner of the room, and found no cockroaches. I heard from Manager Wang who contacted me that the room where I lived before and found cockroaches had been sealed and disinfected*, and the sale can only be made after the inspection is passed. reason. When I checked in this time, I arranged a quieter room for my friend. Not bad, at least a good night's sleep. The manager on duty at night even brought goodnight snacks to the room. It was really timely. It’s good that I’m a little hungry, and there aren’t many things. It’s good that I can cushion my stomach and don’t need to order greasy takeaway. The next day, my friend also went to try the breakfast. It was really good. There are so many varieties of breakfast. My friend said that he thought it was the best one.
Scallion wrapped juniper, pancake sandwiched with fried dough sticks and brushed with sauce, taste (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧, then I will try it next time I stay. Since my friend was doing business outside at noon and it was too late to check out, the front desk contacted the friend and said that he could give the friend a late check-out without charging a room fee. It took a long time, and I came back immediately to check out. Because I left in a hurry, my friend left the charger in the room. I haven't found it yet. I received a call from the front desk around 5:00 p.m., asking if it was charged. Device, I didn't expect this. After listening to this series of narrations from my friends, the overall service level of the hotel is still online, which is also remarkable. Manager Wang also told me that a group of interns have just arrived at the front desk, and the training may not be in place, and it is indeed rectification at present. I still agree with the behavior that knowing the mistakes can be corrected, no one can guarantee that they will not make mistakes, right, haha. Next time I have a chance, I still have to experience it myself, and also try their breakfast and other services. Thank you also to Hotel Manager Wang for following up on my matter. I really saw the dedication of this manager.

When we go out to play, Help us take the dried clothes back to the room and tidy them up, very recommended~

When I checked in, there were too many small people at the door. I asked if the upstairs is an apar**ent, and the downstairs is a hotel, with the same entrance and exit! !

Service: There is no concierge. The 2 stars are for the lady at the front desk. She said she gave me breakfast and gave me a good review. To be fair, I didn't eat breakfast. I hope to give you a real suggestion!

Facilities: Not to mention smart, the switches are all panels. If you want to switch the lights, you have to go down and turn them off one by one. The hotel door is facing the bed, the bathroom door is not closed tightly, and the hotel windows are not strict. Sleeping at night is like opening a window , I can hear the sound of the corridor clearly. If I didn't check in after 11 o'clock in the evening, I would definitely change the hotel! ! I don’t know if so many good reviews came out? !

Hygiene: The washbasin is like a public bathroom, there is no holder for towels, and the toilet lid has no buffer. Every time the lid is closed, I am shocked. There is no place that I think is the standard of 5 diamonds. I don’t know how Ctrip gave it

It was a particularly tossing night, and the shower in the newly replaced room will drip after use. It may be that the switch is not closed tightly due to the age of the switch, but the rest is okay.

When checking in, she patiently asked us about our requirements for the floor of the room and the yin and yang side. The rooms are also great. Auntie cleaned up very well. It is very comfortable to go back every day. The surrounding facilities are also very complete and convenient. It takes ten minutes to walk to the West Lake. The metro bus station is also very close. Super convenient. Because I booked a room without breakfast, the hotel and the manager also gave free breakfast for two days, and the breakfast was really great! Mom said that breakfast was the number one meal he ate in the past few days in Hangzhou! Next time I go to Hangzhou, I will book this hotel again.

The hotel is cost-effective, with excellent clean and hygienic service. Xiao Wang at the front desk also helped to upgrade the deluxe double room for free. He sent coffee to us who were exhausted by boats and cars. He patiently reminded us of various precautions, very considerate.

msg:A very average hotel, I won’t stay here again next time.
Location: Not awkward or embarrassing. It's too far to walk to the subway station, but too close to take a taxi, and there aren't many places to eat around.
Service: Very superficial and without details. Call before checking in to ask if foreign-branded vehicles can be parked during the National Day. I made two calls and the first one said no problem, just come in. . . The second is not knowing. When I saw the outside sign when I left the store, I told him that it was restricted and I couldn't leave. I called the lobby manager or something, and then he came up with a solution.
When I returned to the hotel at noon the next day, the child asked for a small national flag at the entrance of the restaurant. A staff member guarding a pile of national flags said fiercely that we were only handing out the flags in the morning. I still had to talk to the front desk before giving it. Really overwhelmed.
Breakfast: I ate it for two days and it got worse every day. There are often no vegetables or quilts. Breakfast is not recommended if you don't have very young children.
Facilities: I don’t feel the design. The toy mats in the parent-child room are all dirty. The bathroom door is inaccessible. The sliding door looks like a farmhouse.
The TV was extremely blurry and blurry. It can be said that the facility collapsed.
There are few chargers at the bedside. Very inconvenient. The light switches are hidden in the corners. What kind of design is this?
The mattress of the child's extra bed was so dirty that I couldn't bear to look at it.
The most annoying thing is that the parent-child room on the third floor is not well soundproofed and you can hear everything going on next door.
In short, it is not recommended for families to stay in the Bear Room.

She answered all the questions I asked with a smile, and was very gentle. Regarding the nearby attractions I asked about, she answered my questions patiently one by one. When I checked in, I sent WeChat to ask any questions. She can help me solve things, send me courier and so on. Anyway, whenever there is a need, she can respond and solve it in a timely manner. I really want to praise her service! ! ! I have stayed in many five-star hotels, and the service is not as good as this one, which is particularly impressive. Of course, the environment is not as good as the store in Shanghai, but for the service of Meizi, I think the five-star praise is worth it! Next time I have the opportunity to appreciate her service, I will be willing to come again. It was a good travel experience. Except that the bars in Hangzhou are not easy to book, the rest of the impression of Hangzhou is good! Hahaha

msg:I feel cheated by Ctrip. This hotel is a Ctrip five-diamond hotel, not a five-star hotel. It can only be regarded as an express hotel, full season plus. If the price of the executive double room is 1200 yuan, it is unsatisfactory.
Facilities: There is no luggage rack in the executive room. The room type is obviously changed from an office building, and the toilet is facing the big bed. The mobile coffee table on the sofa is too flexible, and children are at risk for safety. The toilet seat doesn't even have a damper. The TV software is still the kind of express hotel, and you have to pay for it yourself to watch a movie.
Hygiene: There are water stains on the entrance floor, cracks in the basin, rough toilet lights, and there seems to be no ventilation.
Environment: The hotel lobby is too small.
Service: The service is okay.
It’s not that the hotel is bad. I’ve stayed in so many five-star hotels. It’s really not cost-effective at this price. Fortunately, I only paid 600 for the voucher

1. Not hygienic: I wanted to make coffee, but as you can see in the picture, the packaging bag was dirty and sticky...
2. Decoration facilities: The floor looks very old and dirty for a long time, the style is not uniform, and some places look cheap; the TV is also small; and the toilet seat is uneven as shown in the video
3. Location: It is not convenient to take a taxi anywhere! If you want to go to West Lake, it is most convenient to take a taxi here, but it is very traffic jam! It is not convenient to go to other attractions! It's okay to eat! A broken position that can't go up or down!
4. Noise: next to the road, there is a lot of noise
5. Price: The price/performance ratio is extremely low. It is a big complaint to choose this price here!
Hotels of the same level have Atour with a lower price!
If the price is similar, you can live in Hampton by Hilton, and you can live by the West Lake before adding more!
Because I spent this money to book such a broken hotel that is inconvenient everywhere, I even had a big fight with my family! Say it again, whoever comes to this broken hotel will complain!

We arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock and said that we could check in in 1 hour, so we happily went shopping around and ate. It was 16:12 to return to the hotel. I thought I could check in directly, but I waited for another 15 minutes. The room was still "cleaning". I almost fell a big split when I entered the door. This cleaning is quite "fresh".
The next day when I was still in the temple, I received a call urging me to check out, excuse me? On the first day of check-in, in order to apologize, we extended the check-out time to 3 o'clock. What is this operation? ? I politely said "Don't you do handovers", and people replied "No". . . I came again when I checked out. When I checked in, I expressed that I had made an online reservation and issued an invoice just to save time. As a result, the person said, "Online reservation but I still need to talk to the front desk"? ? ? Again, miss, are you here to have fun together? No handover at the front desk of the hotel? ?
I expressed a sentence "Your service is really a problem", and the person replied to me with "Hmm!" . . Extreme operation! ! I also work in the service industry myself, which is really awesome! Pulled into the blacklist and will not recommend anyone to live here😀

msg:Bad, bad, bad! ! The pictures on the Internet are just a lie. The floors and everything are very dilapidated! The room is super dark! The iron frame door of the bathroom has no buffer at all and makes a clanging sound when the wind blows. I'm talking about the wind from the air conditioner. Is this because no one reported it or is it ignored at all? It feels like staying in a two or three star hotel. After staying for one night, I quickly canceled my reservation for the second night and left. I will not consider this brand again in the future.

msg:The current Ctrip score is 4.7. Generally, hotels with such scores are not a big problem to live in, so I booked it. After arriving, I regretted not reading everyone's reviews, especially the bad ones.

Cigarette butts are thrown on the ground at the entrance of the hotel, and there should be few people cleaning it. The lobby is dirty and cold, and the breakfast room is also on the first floor. It is also very cold every morning, and the food will cool down soon after serving it.

When checking in, a female staff wearing glasses was friendly and kind, but when checking out, another female staff not only answered the phone for a long time and ignored her, but also took the initiative to greet her, took the room card and continued to process the information on her mobile phone. Indifferent throughout. Equally indifferent were the male staff at the coffee counter.

The hotel’s corridors, doors, rooms and other hardware may sometimes be not very good, but if the service quality is poor, there is really no way.

As soon as you enter the room, next to the water glass is the woman's dyed hair, on the sink is the woman's fallen false eyelashes, and the damage of the floor drain represents flaws everywhere in the room.

There are also technicians with even more weird attitudes who come to the room to see that the air conditioner is not hot... If you continue to complain, the good life should be affected, so let's just talk about it.

The quilt feels very inferior, and it makes a noise like a plastic bag when you turn over. The room is very low, and it is quite depressing to live in. The bathroom curtain is useless, it is almost transparent to take a shower in it (I really don't understand this design). The floor drain in the bathroom is very small and the drainage is very slow. The service attitude is not bad, and the sound insulation effect is not bad. There are very few breakfast items. It says hot milk but it is cold when poured out, and the dishes are basically cold. My family members have diarrhea after eating.

msg:The overall facilities of the hotel are good, and Xiao Song at the front desk is also very enthusiastic about the service. He also gave the children snacks and gifts, and added an extra breakfast for me. The breakfast is also pretty good overall. If it is up to here, I think it is still very good, and I will give it five stars It was well received, but the little episode in the back was a bit unhappy. I put a child’s silicone baby bottle in the small refrigerator, as shown in the picture, and forgot to take it. I remembered it later. When I came to pick up the car, I came to pick it up. According to the rules of all hotels, The things in the guest's room, the housekeeping staff will check through the front desk and the guest whether they still need it, and then deal with it. As a result, there is no such step here, so they handle it by themselves. Did she refill the small refrigerator, she said no, the fact is that we drank all the contents of the small refrigerator yesterday, how could it not be replenished, and after I went up, she said that there is only one facial cleanser in my room, and I took it out to give Me, why didn’t I report the facial cleanser to the front desk during the ward rounds. Later, when we were looking for the baby bottle, the front desk called several times and asked why I didn’t tell me. Through the conversation with her later, it was obvious that I didn’t give it to me carefully. Throw it away, I think this routine check-out process, as a hotel, should strengthen training, so it can't be so sloppy

There are famous Hangzhou restaurants such as Grandma's House and Old Man Fried Shrimp next to it. Most of the reviews I read before are good, but a few say that the service is not very good. When we checked in, the service from Xiao Mao at the front desk dispelled our worries. The arrangement was thoughtful, and the two rooms were placed on the first floor. Each room also provided a free breakfast for one person, which was very good. The sanitation of the hotel is also good. The room is not too big, but it has a sense of design. Again, I would like to praise classmate Xiaomao, it is very good.

A lot of comfort indeed.
The hotel's elevator and rooms are not luxurious, but they are clean
Moreover, there are four bottles of water directly in the room, which is much better than many hotels.
The sound insulation effect of the room is average, the noise in the corridor or the sound of opening and closing the closet in the next room can be heard
When I left, Ms. Cao at the front desk offered to help me mail the items I purchased, which made me feel that the service of this hotel can make up for all the shortcomings
Although there is no time to catch up with a bowl of noodles for two days, the price/performance ratio of the hotel in the city center is still very good, the transportation is convenient, and everything is responsive

msg:The overall feeling of staying in the hotel is very good, because two families with friends came to Hangzhou by car. The three families choose a 1.5-meter twin room, which is perfect. I drove from Qingdao at 8:30 in the evening and arrived at the hotel at 6:30 in the morning. The service attitude of the girl at the front desk, Xiao Zhou, is very enthusiastic. Because the check-in time is not reached, the luggage is stored for free, and the car is also parked for free. The plan is changed and the stay is continued. The girl Zhou also gave a free breakfast, and there is also a discount, I like it very much up.
The breakfast is okay, but there is a girl in the restaurant and a boy who enters the restaurant. The attitude is not very good. I am a little impatient when I ask them about things. First of all, it is the beginning of the day when the guests eat early in the morning. I really don’t want to be affected by you. Hope to correct.
The little brother who made wontons and the big sister next to him gave good reviews.

msg:We understand that the number of infections has increased after the opening, but customers also pay to stay, so the service must be worthy. The stay this time was very poor, so I have to comment here.
1. First of all, the self-service was canceled in the morning, but they knocked on the door and delivered it to the door at 8 o'clock in the morning, disturbing the rest, and we didn't even deliver breakfast on the last day. When we asked in the restaurant, we said we had to register at the front desk, but we stayed For a few nights, there is no need to log out the breakfast before; for the breakfast, please see the picture below (I think it is a perfunctory consumer)
2. I have been told that there is no staff to clean the room, and the garbage must be placed at the door by itself, but no one has cleaned it up for 2 days. I can't imagine what is in the garbage, and how bacteria and viruses have grown in the corridor in these 2 days. If it is said that no one cleans because of the epidemic, shouldn't it be said that the cleaning work must be done better because of the epidemic? !
3. It doesn't look like a hotel building, it looks like a residential building. The door of the room doesn't even have an anti-theft hole. When someone knocks on the door, they have to open the door to see it. I feel a little less security.

Don't choose here next time, because it really doesn't have the quality of a hotel. Type it out to share, I hope everyone will think clearly before ordering, after all, it is you who consume.

msg:Let’s talk about the key points first for reference. The front desk service is pretty good, convenient and fast. The room is old. From facilities to decoration, hygiene is also perfunctory. Because the curtains are all manual, when you pull the curtains, you see garbage under the curtains. Did the cleaning staff not pull the curtains? There was a musty smell and the humidity was very heavy. The hotel couldn't even talk about dehumidification, and the quilt felt wet. I don’t even say whether it’s worth over 900 a night. I probably won’t stay here again for 200 a night. It might be a holiday, so there is almost nothing to eat, just two bowls of noodles in two days, that's it. I have always had a good impression of Junting. I like to choose to stay in other cities. This one is just like this. I don’t have the desire to take pictures. It’s really disappointing... Read more reviews before booking a hotel. I won’t be reckless. It’s just me. Lessons

msg:Advantages: It is located on the roadside of the Wulin Business District Stadium, and is convenient for driving and subway. The hotel is new, the rooms are large, and the blue linens and bookshelves have an elegant feel. The reservation requires a high floor, so we arranged for the 14th floor. It is said that the executive room will be upgraded to the southwest corner, with floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides. It is spacious and bright, but there is no warm flush toilet seat in our room. The large writing table (which is rarely equipped in five-diamond hotels nowadays) is arranged overlapping with the couch (bed) and is movable. You can choose to face it from both sides. This design is great (but the movement is a bit too slippery). Service calls are centralized on the red ** button of the telephone, and services are arranged uniformly by the front desk. There are mobile service robots. Two bags of hanging ear coffee are provided in the room. The taste is slightly bitter but not sour, which is good. If you have milk, one bag can make two cups. There are not many varieties of breakfast but the quality is good.
Disadvantages: The lobby and restaurant are cramped like a fast hotel. If you want to experience a five-diamond hotel, you will be disappointed (the perspective of the photo is selected, please do not misunderstand). The room temperature is fixed, ranging from 11 to 18 degrees Celsius outside. It is so hot inside that I can only wear an undershirt. The same applies to turning off the air conditioner and opening the windows. I cannot cover myself with a quilt at night. The wardrobe is too narrow to open for a 20-inch small suitcase. The exterior walls of the newly opened hotel building are only illuminated by small light bulbs, and the night view is very shabby. I tried the restaurant's "signature noodles" and the noodles and toppings were not as good as the pictures posted by netizens.

Advantages: The overall environment of the hotel is OK, the service experience is very good, and it helped me to upgrade from a Japanese-style double room to an executive double room for free
Cons: The size and facilities of the toilet really want to complain. Is this the standard for an executive room? And the overall price of the hotel is not cheap. No one in the Price Bureau controls the pricing? No wonder the introduction picture does not have a picture of the toilet. It's too ridiculous and there is no exhaust, no exhaust, no exhaust

The most important thing is that the service is really good. I must praise Xiao Cao at the front desk by name. She is really considerate. She has been troubled all morning with renewing the stay, invoices, and inquiring about all kinds of things. It can be said that there are no details. Just for this kind of service, and will stay again next time!

msg:I haven’t written a review for a long time, so I have to say something about this hotel:
1. Guest rooms: Old hotels are not like new hotels in 2019. Once opened, all cabinet doors in the room can no longer be sealed and closed. The bathroom sink drain plug was rusty and water splashed when flushing the toilet. The shower room had not been cleaned after staying for five days. Hair in the drain kept blocking the water flow, so I had to clean it myself. This is the first time I discovered that a "five-star" hotel doesn't have HBO, it doesn't have any ordinary Chinese limited TV channels. It only provides Internet TV, not VIP, and the basic TV is just a decoration.
2. Restaurant: For the first time, there is no yogurt variety on the dining table of a "five-star" hotel. I stayed there for five days and didn't find it. There were tea eggs on the first day, but then I just boiled eggs every day. The variety is very monotonous. . I have to clean the dining table in the restaurant every day, but it is all black. I observed that the waiter only collects the dishes and chopsticks, and then if there is anything on the table, he just wipes it off with a napkin. It must be all the old dust accumulated over the years. ...speechless
3. Service: The front desk service is good and responsive, but the room service is not good. If you want an extra quilt, ask the aunt and tell us directly to contact the front desk.
4. The location of the hotel can only be said to be okay. Anyway, the transportation is convenient wherever you stay in Hangzhou.
The above is my personal experience for reference only, choose your hotel carefully and don’t fall into this trap.

msg:**The promotion of 499 check-in includes Perrier, welcome letter, and coffee included in the room. None of them are included in the check-in, because I am used to drinking coffee every day, and then I asked about it when I checked in. The front desk hesitated and couldn't explain clearly, and then said that it can be delivered. After a cup, I added a corporate WeChat account. The male employee was not proficient in operating it. Later, I explained that after two reservations were made for two days in a row, I couldn’t operate it. I called another person for help, collected the two-day room fee deposit, and checked in (then I swiped the room card again the next day, but it was no longer valid. After a day of sightseeing around the scenic spot, the road back to the room from the front desk was really far)
After I checked in, there was no Perrier, no welcome letter, and the toiletries were not Hermès. It didn’t matter. I asked for a sewing box on the second day after I checked in. It took me 20 minutes to deliver it after I had to rush three times to deliver it. However, the needles were all rusty. The fabric couldn't be worn at all, and the room was too stuffy. The front desk said that the air conditioner can only heat, not cool, and it has no air supply function.
In the morning, when I went to the first floor to redeem coffee, I said it was coffee included in the room. He asked me how many cups there were. I said how many cups were included in the room, that’s how many cups. He said he didn’t know, so I said one cup would be enough. , then went to visit the scenic spots with coffee in hand, and checked out normally.
After returning to my own city, this employee named Meizi repeatedly asked me for positive reviews. I thought it was troublesome to delete my friends, and then added screenshots of friends asking for positive reviews, on the grounds that I would be deducted from my account for giving me coffee. So I was very curious. When I received the coffee, the barista didn't ask me my room number or register it. How could I accurately pin the cup of coffee she gave me to the room where it was located?
There was no explanation when checking in that coffee was given in exchange for good reviews. If I had to kidnap the good reviews, I could pay for the coffee!
Finally, the food looks ugly, and I also want to know how the hotel’s financial deduction management system is implemented!

msg:This time, I have booked two rooms, a deluxe double room and an executive double room. This time I will evaluate the deluxe double room.

Facilities: The picture of the room introduced by the hotel looks better and the actual situation is similar, but the floor height is not enough. The room space feels relatively low, so the stay feels a bit depressed. The room facilities also meet the standards of high-end hotels. There are some things that should be there, but the shower in our room is blocked. After the phone call, a master came over and messed it up for a while and made a big blow to other people's hair... There is also a bit of a mishap that the hotel's underground parking garage is not shared with the building's office building, so there is a serious shortage of parking spaces on working days. The parking space is not suitable for self-driving tour

Room: In addition to the problem of floor height, the room is good and very clean. I like the sofa bed in the row by the window. The air conditioner in the room is too loud... The air conditioner is still on the minimum wind in the video...

Service: Every employee in the hotel is very polite. From the front desk to the cleaning and then to the master who helped us to pass the sewer, he would take the initiative to say hello to the master when he passed the sewer. Usually from 6:30 to 10:00, there are not many kinds of breakfast. The meat I eat for breakfast is only corn sausage, bacon, and cold-cut meat in meat packs.

The hotel feels good as a whole, worthy of the price of more than 500 a night, but it would be better if some details were done better

Personally, I suggest that the breakfast room needs to add more tableware for guests, such as coffee spoons, butter knives, fruit forks, and I don’t see them. I don’t know if it’s because of the epidemic. Come out. The only fly in the oin**ent in the room is that there is no full-length mirror 😁

msg:I took my baby to the West Lake to play. Because the schedule was very rushed, many hotels had no rooms. Later, I booked an executive king bed on pagoda. There are windows and an office desk to meet the needs of the husband who needs to go out to play and work. The minibar in the room is also free. The breakfast place is not big and there are not many varieties, but the taste is okay and you can be full. The traffic is also relatively convenient, and you can go to the West Lake Scenic Area in 2 stops. But sanitation needs to be strengthened. The bedding and bathroom are okay, and the floor, walkway and wardrobe are all dusty.

msg:This double room originally wanted my mother to sleep with one of them at night, because the parent-child room is a bit crowded to sleep together. I didn’t expect the parent-child room to be okay. The air conditioner in this big bed room can’t heat up for 5 hours. For the sake of the elderly The child is in poor health, so I can only sleep with my husband alone. I called the front desk and asked the engineering depar**ent to take a look. They said that the air outlet was showing 27 degrees, but anywhere in the room was 17 to 21 degrees, so the air conditioner was fine. In the morning, my husband said that he woke up from the cold at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night. He was not in a good state of driving during the day, so he said that the parent-child room was very good, but the experience in this room was not good. Although the front desk of the hotel responded positively, they did not solve the problem and wanted to change it. The room also said that there is no vacant room to change. The hotel's dining is on the first floor very close to the gate. The dining is very cold, and it may not be useful to turn on the hot air conditioner. In addition, after booking the hotel, I found out that there are a lot of bad reviews. I have been using Ctrip. This hotel was only booked at the top of the list. I fully believe in Ctrip’s business capabilities. Please also recommend Ctrip to loyal users like us. Some reliable hotels, after all, if you go out with children and the elderly, you still have requirements for the quality of the hotel. You are not afraid of high prices, but you are afraid that there will be no corresponding facilities and environment if you spend money. As far as the hotel is concerned, I hope that the air conditioner in room 320 can be improved. It is still winter and there will be other guests staying. If it is not resolved, the same problem will still occur. Hope to know.

Auntie put on the sheets and quilt in front of us, and put the sheets on the floor beside the tatami with her shoes on. She must have been watched for a long time, but later we found out that she took off her shoes and put on the quilt with socks on. The hygiene is not bad, maybe passable. There is also the issue of the set meal. It was clearly stated in my order that it included two free cups of coffee. I want to pack two cups of coffee and go in the morning. The waitress said that she needed to confirm with the front desk. The coffee counter was only 10 steps away from the front desk. She also needed to call the front desk to ask questions (the design was quite speechless). She still couldn't get through and waited for a long time before answering. Finally, I was told that this package was not available, so what is the screenshot below? I was also asked to go to the front desk and ask. All in all, the experience was average.

msg:Bad experience. In a very old building with a dilapidated parking lot and the police station behind it. The people I met on the elevator were a little decadent and felt unsafe. The actual location is in the small residential area of ​​Laopo, far away from the West Lake. Transportation is inconvenient. The front desk directly gave me a toiletry bag, which instantly brought me back to the guest house service in the 1980s. Is there something wrong with Ctrip’s star rating? A place that is almost like a Home Inn is actually given five stars? The air conditioning temperature in the room cannot be adjusted, and the hygiene needs to be improved. The only good thing is that there are two 1.5-meter large beds. I originally booked for two nights, but because it was already evening when I arrived at the hotel, I reluctantly stayed for one night and canceled the reservation. Not recommended, will never stay there again. Is pagoda Junting just a Home Inn type hotel? Or is it more like a B&B? In short, it has nothing to do with star-rated hotels!

Is this a designated unit of the Buddhist Association... It has changed my assessment of the star rating of hotels on Ctrip.com Standard; 2. The downstairs is too noisy, there are drunks at night, and there is a square dance competition; 3. The cleaning staff next door is cleaning, but she said that she is not responsible for our room, let me inform the front desk, wonderful, open your eyes , On the sixth floor, you can check the monitoring on the morning of July 1st, if it happened, it's such a big hotel, it's cleaned next door, you can actually reply to the guests like this, absolutely; . I won't live here next time, I'm sorry for the rating given by Ctrip, that is, the level of business fastness, breakfast does not count.

🌟Environmental facilities: Personally, I like the simple design style of Junting Hotel. I just stayed in March. I read that Junting Hotel is in a promotion due to the epidemic, so I immediately placed an order and stayed again. The decoration design and service attitude of the hotel are as good as last time, but the variety of breakfast is half less! The service staff explained that it was changed to semi-self-service due to the impact of the epidemic, but the reduction was too great!
🌟Restaurant: Delicious restaurant on the 1st floor. The epidemic has affected the semi-self-service breakfast. There are few varieties, but you can manage your fill. The steamed buns are actually placed on the operating table. The supply time is until 10:00, and the service attitude is general. I feel the breakfast needs to be improved a lot!
⛱Parking: Free in hotel, underground garage and surface parking 🅿️
🌟Location and Transportation: Bus 🚌28, 11 or more than ten bus lines, get off at Wulin Square South and walk for about 100 meters; walk for more than 200 meters from Exit A of Wulin Square Road Station of Metro Line 1.
🌟 Swimming pool: none

msg:The hotel is right next to the Wulin Gate, next to the Hangzhou Building. There is a lot of food downstairs. The location is very convenient. The door is a bit inconspicuous because it is inside and outside the sidewalk and the main road. Free parking underground parking lot, very good. The corridors feel a little dark tones, the room is not bad, very intelligent, and the bed is very soft. It’s just that the air conditioner is too cold, maybe it’s not turned on yet. It’s too hot to cover the quilt without refrigeration in this season. If you don’t cover the quilt, you will definitely catch a cold, which will affect your sleep. You still need to try it out on a regular basis. Although the toilet is a smart toilet, it is a bit small because it is a rear-mounted cover. In addition, the cover is automatically opened to heat, which is great in summer. . . There is a small anti-skid reminder on the door of the shower room. It should be better to stick with text. The anti-skid pad inside still needs to be equipped. There are grooves in it. It hurts to stand barefoot. The hair dryer has to be replaced, it's too bad, it's very hot but the wind is very small, it's too painful to blow your hair. The service is very good, whether it is the front desk or the lady who visits after checking out. keep up the good work

Because I am a Ctrip member, I have been upgraded to an executive double room. The room is relatively simple as a whole, but the executive double room does not have a bathtub. The breakfast was delivered to the room, and the taste was not bad, but the variety could be increased. The lady at the front desk has a very good service attitude and has always been very enthusiastic.

It takes only two kilometers to walk to the commercial street in the West Lake area, and the taxi fare is very convenient. The decoration of the hotel is very new, the rooms are big and nice! Very satisfied! Later, Hangzhou will choose. Very cost-effective, absolutely!

We received very thoughtful service, especially for my 82-year-old mother. Because of her inconvenient legs and feet, she was delayed in returning to the hotel after visiting the scenic spot. The front desk receptionist Xiao Zhang gave the elderly humane care, which was very heartwarming. Hangzhou has left us with good memories because of Junting. Next time we come to Hangzhou, we will stay here again.

Originally booked a twin bed, I temporarily proposed to change the double bed. The front desk checked the room status and changed it. I also got a bottle of welcome drink, which is grapefruit juice.
The rooms are fairly spacious. The design of the bay window table that can be moved is quite special. When a friend comes over to sit or sit on the sofa, you can push the table away.
I asked the guest room for two things and they were delivered in time. The mini is also free. Overall it’s not bad.

msg:It was the first time that Junting lived in Shanghai. The impression was very good. I had evaluated it before, all five stars, but this time it was very disappointing. The scoring is based on it, not emotional.
1. Hygiene. I took a plate and found the noodles hanging on it during breakfast. Looking for the manager, she actually apologized and grabbed the noodles with her hands. I think a five-star hotel should be: sorry, sir, we have to reflect on it. The main focus is on the customer, not on the noodles.
2. Service: Auntie brought things up and said to me: I don't know what your routine is. . This expression should not be five-star training, or she has not been trained, it may be related to the variety of people living here, consistent with the behavior of the restaurant, and little training.
3. Facilities: The restaurant and room of this designer hotel have a great sense of design, but there are a few interesting points. The door of the lobby is not automatic. The details of the building should be cut corners by the contractor. The key point: The sound insulation effect is extremely poor, I can hear the sound of the switch in the next room, and the speech of children can be clear to the word.
4. But the design of the hotel is great, especially the interior design of the room.
5. Thank you hotel for upgrading my room type.
6. It was once the center of the center of Hangzhou, and it still has a sense of modern history from a height.

But I like the city of Hangzhou, and hope that people who come here can have a good impression of Hangzhou, so under the comment, I hope that more good hotels will emerge.

Free upgrade to the executive room, so happy, the room is more spacious. The spacious and bright rooms, carefully designed and arranged, and the blue tone, instantly relax. The sofa and the desk are one, with clever thoughts. The sofa is wide. The room is very quiet. Only in the next morning I heard the loud voices of a few people passing by in the corridor outside. Particularly worthy of recognition is the careful arrangement of every part of the room. The breakfast buffet is rich, in line with my appetite, and delicious. Finally, there is a suggestion that the floor anti-skid can be enhanced, and specific anti-skid measures should be strengthened in the room and bathroom.

On this trip, I am generally satisfied with this hotel.

餐廳的味道也是很棒的，雖然衹是商務套餐，但是品得出，廚師很用心。早餐雖然是中餐，但是口味一點也不讓人失望，很好吃

但是早餐混亂.9:30分下樓吃早餐已經連盤子都沒有了。紙巾也沒有，有些菜和飲料也沒有了。問服務員盤子呢，就説沒有，後面一個女的直接給一個黑碗。讓菜都打這裏。我想問。我是跑食堂來吃飯了嗎。幾十塊的早餐，給我吃食堂的感覺？

酒店遇到這類客人也無奈。不知是否可以報警
酒店按內部協議價返回我從攜程訂房的差價，也算是一種補償吧

前台的員工‘小籠包’非常熱情，不僅為我安排了提前入住，還附送了一些額外的服務，讓我感受到了酒店的用心和關懷。這種細緻入微的服務，讓我對君亭pagoda酒店的好感度直網上升。
進入房間後，我被這裏的設計深深吸引。君亭pagoda酒店作為一個設計師酒店，果然名不虛傳。整個房間充滿了創意和時尚感，色彩搭配和佈局都讓人眼前一亮。尤其是那些獨特的裝飾和傢俱，讓我感受到了設計師的巧思妙想。
此外，酒店還提供了許多適合年輕人的設施和活動，讓我感到非常舒適和愜意。在這裏，我可以盡情享受我的假期，忘卻工作的煩惱和壓力。
總的來説，君亭pagoda酒店的入住體驗讓我非常滿意。無論是服務、設計還是設施，都讓我感到非常舒適和愉悦。如果你也是一位追求高品質生活的年輕人，不妨來君亭pagoda酒店體驗一下，相信你也會愛上這裏的~

msg:其實很神奇，我預訂的時候選擇是五星級酒店，君亭品牌也不錯，價格也650+，總感覺應該還可以吧，沒想到真是災難的一天。
1.酒店基本屬於沒有大廳概念，完全不配五星（五磚）規格，出電梯需要七拐八彎，類似公寓改建。
2.概念房=邊角房。洗漱盆真的和廉租房一樣，洗面奶都放不下。
3.有浴缸本來想放鬆下，浴缸窗邊，且對面房子窗户正對不足30米，進門時要求換房間，等待一個小時。
4.入住前告知沒有空調，考慮最近天氣20℃左右沒關係，也懶得更換酒店了，沒想到一大早是悲劇，房間朝東，太陽直射，8點左右房間內部温度絕對超過27℃，比室外温度高約10℃，睡一身汗。
5.熱的不行，早點起床去吃早飯，發現又是災難，這家酒店是接團的酒店，餐廳一片狼藉，桌面全部沒有打掃，豆漿牛奶沒有杯子，有吸管沒酸奶。菜剩下一些殘羹冷炙。
6.無奈簡單吃好飯上樓，想着昨天換房間太久，沒時間泡澡，正好也是一身汗就下樓前打開浴缸水龍頭，上來可以泡個澡，上來之後發現水才1/3，再等半小時，才1/2，這個浴缸漏水！！！！
總結：完全不配五星或者五磚，空調沒有，房間畸形，早餐糟糕，交通不便。

msg:入住歡迎禮沒有
入住的時候比較晚前台説第二天會安排 等到回到酒店依舊沒有 懶得計較了 
整體房間比較老舊風 酒店延馬路 窗口正對婦幼醫院…如果介意的人要提前要和前台説不要延馬路的
這個酒店接旅行團 早上如果在團隊用餐的時候去吃早飯 根本找不到位置
早餐的品種不算特別多 但是每天沒有重複這點還是加分的

總體來説很滿意的一次入住體驗。

春節期間這個價位，這個地理位置已經不錯了。
早餐也不錯，品種豐富。
唯一的不足是硬件問題，感覺是個舊樓翻新的，整體略顯陳舊，屋內有點味道，而且隔音不是太好。

早餐也很好吃，就是冷的比較快，天氣太冷了，但要了熱水泡了泡好很多。一樓就是咖啡廳和餐廳，咖啡種類很多，樓下就可以辦公，有暖爐提供。早餐是一起的）。種類很多，中西合璧，選材也很乾凈。六點半就有了，適合趕早班的小夥伴。
最喜歡的是君亭的設計，大廳的磨砂玻璃+前台一個圓形的顯示屏，很特別。每個桌上都有綠植，杭州最近霧霾太大啦，是很需要一些凈化性的植物。
但就是看圖片上有植物，房間沒有～
其餘方面都很好啦，一次很愉快的入住。

反正勝在便宜，各項設施都比較老舊，房間門連貓眼都沒有，十年前覺得君亭挺好的所以才選這裏的，沒想到變化挺大的。

酒店的員工挺熱情的，我們遇到需要洗漱用品、拿外賣等問題，他們都是耐心解答
房間內的設施配備齊全，空調、電視、WiFi等一應俱全。
位置是地鐵旁，交通便利，周邊餐飲、購物、娛樂等場所眾多，有羅森便利店、杭州中心等，逛街吃飯都蠻方便的。

msg:和朋友一起來杭州玩，杭州的朋友推薦的這個酒店，説是位置非常便利，果然入住之後就感受到了。地鐵站就在附近200多米，附近吃飯的店特別多，各種類型應有盡有。逛街也是，感覺杭州的幾個商務大廈都在這片了，每隔兩三百米就有一個，去西湖玩什麼的打車起步價就能到的距離。入住的時候手續辦理的很快，房間空間大，乾淨整潔，隔音效果好，花灑大小和水温都很合適。衞浴產品也蠻好用的。早餐也比較豐盛。推薦！

msg:首先我要説一下，這是我第一次給一家酒店打這麼低的分數。杭州pagoda真是有過人之處！我心疼前台，大家工作態度很好，為客人着想，解決問題能力也強。但是，這家酒店其他的東西太差了。房間應該是老樓改建的，傢俱地板牆紙很有年代感。自助餐東西非常少，九點多去麪包區空盤，雞蛋衹有一顆，培根兩塊。早上想去咖啡廳拿兩杯咖啡喝，我説我要掛房賬，餐廳這個女的超兇超兇超兇，對我靈魂三連擊，你有按金嗎？你剛入住嗎？你哪個房間？我真是氣死了！想要做好酒店的平分，請先提高員工素質！房間也臟，空調出風口黑的要死！
