Our air conditioner was not working and called repeatedly for somebody to take a look at it. They came twice to fix it and confirmed that it was fixed however still ended up breaking again. Not a 5 star hotel in my books and not worth $100+/night to wake up sweaty and sticky. The rooms are also very small with dirty windows that added to the stuffiness. Location wise, it‚Äôs a 10-15 minute car ride to fuzi Miao area. Nothing is within walking distance.

The first night was at Jinling Tower and the second night was at Jinling Hotel which is a separate building. The morning after my first stay, I had some business in the city and needed some extra time to move my luggage from the first room to the second. I called the hotel and reached senior receptionist Echo Xu who allowed me to keep my luggage in the room until I returned at 3 PM. Thanks to her and the rest of the staff at Jinling, I had a pleasant trip and a marvelous stay at Jinling!

The room is ok, but the windows are dirty so the view wasn‚Äôt that pretty. The old carpet floor in the rooms should be replace with more hygienic wooden flooring.
The TV casting from phone function didn‚Äôt work: The Wi-Fi was too poor to keep up.
The hotel is on top of a very good connected subway station - very convenient. The staff in general very helpful and ready to carry bags, press elevator buttons etc.
The bed was comfortable. The air in the room was humid and the climate control didn‚Äôt have dehumidifier function.

msg:I have to say, compared to last year when I stayed in the Asia-pacific Tower, this time the Jinling Hotel gave me a more fantastic experience.

Jinling Building, which was renovated in 2020, still adopts a curved and horizontal layout in the front hall layout, which is entirely different from the four-way configuration of The Asia-pacific Tower and a more traditional sense of ceremony.

The room floor has a light sandalwood smell, with bright yellow light, the display of calligraphy and porcelain, as if in the Jinling period of the Republic of China, elegant and restrained.

However, when I opened the door, my eyes lit up. Sun Yat-sen's bronze statue can be seen at a glance through the window. Unlike the Asia Pacific Tower, which is decorated with flowers such as peonies, The Jinling Building seems to prefer a combination of figure painting and calligraphy with modern decoration. In the meantime, it won't appear too overstaffed luxuriant, also don't make a person feel an element of dull tasteless.

The cloakroom, make-up, and bathroom of the bedroom are linked together. No matter swing doors or sliding doors, the whole look very harmonious with the environment when closing, make me feel a vibrant sense of security and privacy sex.

When I lay in bed, I was pleasantly surprised to find that although the hotel still adopts traditional Chinese bedside tables, they installed the safety switches and sockets at the bedside table on the opposite side of the bed. Compared with the fact that most hotels are used to installing these on the wall, I had to be impressed with the care of the Jinling Building in the decoration.

Finally, the Jinling Hotel is the epitome of Nanjing, traditional, cultural, old but not that stodgy. Just like Mr. ÈôÜÂ§©, the lobby manager, Mr. Âê¥Êµ©ÂÆá, the front desk, and Mr. ÂÆóÂÆá from the Security Department, their warm service, sunny smile, and professional accomplishment filled this building, which was the highest building in East China, and brought me an unprecedented and unforgettable experience.

msg:Every time I go back to Nanjing to visit my family, I stay at Jinling Hotel, and I can stay there several times a year. Every employee here serves the guests very attentively. The breakfast here is a must-eat. All the snacks with Nanjing characteristics are covered. There is no need to go to those places hyped by Internet celebrities to check in. The next day happened to be my husband's birthday. The employees here can accurately locate the guests' seats for breakfast and bring noodles to send blessings. Cheng Mengting and Zhang Yuan of Jinhai Bay provide very good service. When leaving, they also prepared a small gift for the children, which included disinfectant wipes and fruit juice drinks. In addition, Cheng Mengting and Zhang Yuan of Jinhai Bay provide very good service, Xu Yue of the guest room provides great and attentive service. Xu Yue and Li Hong of the guest room provide great and attentive service. When checking out, they also gave the children a lot of fruits to eat on the way. Although I live in Jinling Building, it does not affect my daily swimming in the swimming pool. Wet steam and dry steam, the swimming pool facilities are clean and hygienic. In the future, I will only choose to stay in Jinling Hotel when I come to Nanjing. I wish the hotel gets better and better!

msg:During a recent trip, I had the honor of staying at Nanjing Jinling Hotel. During this period, I was deeply impressed by the excellent performance of the hotel front desk.

Because I brought my children with me, I saw on the website that I had to bring my household registration book. I called the hotel front desk. The front desk manager Xu Chen was very enthusiastic to provide me with other ways to solve the trouble of not carrying it. When I just stepped into the hotel lobby, the warm reception and kind smile of the front desk receptionist Chen Mo immediately made me feel the warmth of home. When we checked in, we happened to meet Manager Xu on the phone. She enthusiastically adjusted a better room for us. After the formalities were completed, Xiao Chen also sent us all the way to the room, which was very considerate. As soon as we entered the door, Aunt Sun Meixia from the guest room prepared fruits and children's supplies for us, which was very thoughtful.

During the stay, the front desk team always performed well. I felt that the big meat buns in the hotel were delicious during breakfast. I asked Manager Xu, who immediately recommended arrangements for us; we needed to mail the Dragon Boat Festival gift box given by the room. Manager Xu, who was resting, specially arranged for his apprentice Zhu Ningjing to help us arrange the express delivery, and the girl was also very enthusiastic. Every time we communicated, the front desk staff showed extremely high professionalism and service awareness.

When I checked out, I met Manager Xu again. She quickly checked out for me and asked me about my satisfaction and opinions about my stay. She recorded my feedback in detail and sincerely expressed that she would continue to improve and enhance the quality of service.

In short, the excellent service of the front desk made my stay at Jinling Hotel very pleasant. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for their professional attitude and enthusiastic service. Without a doubt, I will recommend this hotel to all my relatives and friends, and look forward to having the opportunity to stay again in the future.
Oh, by the way, there is also the enthusiastic service of Jiao Yanan, the supervisor of the breakfast department. She reserved a window seat for us every morning and gave us small cookies when we left. Thank you very much. The children had a very happy stay. I will come again next time. I came to Nanjing to stay at Jinling Hotel. I am very happy on this trip.

Thanks again to the front desk team of Jinling Hotel, especially the team of Manager Xu Chen. Your excellent service has added a lot of brilliance to my journey.

msg:Nanjing Jinling Hotel,
Nanjing's city card,
Nanjing people must stay there to experience it.

This time we stayed in the old building Jinling Building,
The building is 37 stories high, and the room is arranged on the 35th floor.
It has been renovated. You can see the size of the large color TV.
The small table, hair dryer, sofa and other room facilities are all popular in recent years.

Everything is customer-centric.
The first round of drinks in the small refrigerator in all rooms is free.
This is a big pattern.
Sprite, cola, beer and soda are not much,
but the customer experience is different.

Special thanks to the value-added services provided by two employees, Li Hong and Pan Yuxian, and applied for welcome fruits, cookies and mung bean cakes.

The hotel staff was warm and meticulous in their service. Special thanks to Sun Meixia, Zhu Ningjing and Xu Chen, who responded to our needs. Miss Xu Wenling, the Jinling Ambassador, was considerate.
The hotel's breakfast can taste the salted duck of Jinling Hotel. I booked Meiyuan early, and it really lived up to its reputation. It is a classic old brand [strong] Guests can get a discount and save a few hundred dollars. If I come to Nanjing next time, I will still choose to stay in the Asia Pacific Building of Jinling Hotel~

msg:I had a very pleasant time in Jinling this time. I am very grateful to the hotel front desk manager Xu Chen and her team for their warm reception and professional service.
First of all, from the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was warmed by the smiles and polite greetings from the front desk staff. Especially Manager Xu, not only did she check in quickly and efficiently, she also enthusiastically recommended a room type that was more suitable for us, considering it was our first stay, allowing us to move into a new room at a very reasonable and favorable price. The building also asked full-time staff to take us all the way to the elevator. The introduction to the room and hotel facilities was also very detailed, which greatly improved our two-day stay experience.
Manager Xu and her team also had some extra help during our stay and were able to attend to our needs quickly and friendly. Whether it's making restaurant reservations, purchasing and reserving salted duck at the hotel, or solving minor room problems, they always do their best. Meiyuan tastes very good. The girl in the guest room, Sun Meixia, prepared fresh fruits for us every day during our stay. She was thoughtful and meticulous, and the room was also well cleaned. Their service attitude made me feel at home.
Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to the receptionist Chen Xu for her considerate service when I checked out. She prepared the invoice in advance before we checked out, which saved us a lot of time. While completing the checkout process quickly, she also asked about our check-in experience, and sincerely hoped that we would come again to plan our trip to Jinling. A perfect ending.
Overall, the excellent performance and professional attitude of Manager Xu and her team added many wonderful memories to my trip. I have no hesitation in giving their service a five-star rating and highly recommend this hotel to all travelers. I also look forward to having the opportunity to stay again in the future!

The hotel is located in Xinjiekou. Whether you drive, take a taxi, or take the subway, it is very convenient: ‚ë† Take a taxi to Confucius Temple 2.8 kilometers; ‚ë° Only one stop away from the Presidential Palace subway; ‚ë¢ Only three stops away from Xuanwu Lake subway; ‚ë£ Three stops away from Zhongshan Scenic Area, Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, and Meiling Palace Muxu Station subway. ‚ë§ Only one stop away from Nanjing Museum.
There is a food court on the negative 1st floor of the hotel; 50 meters away from the door, the elevator goes down through the subway hub: Line 1, Line 2, Line 4, Line 6, Line 7 and other hub stations. The exits of the hub station are connected to various shopping malls: Golden Eagle International Plaza, Nanjing Xinbai, Deji Plaza, Central Shopping Mall and other large shopping malls. Eating and shopping are very convenient.
2. The front desk is very considerate. The original "Asia-Pacific Building Deluxe King Room" was upgraded to "Exclusive King Room" 5005 room for free.
3. The Asia-Pacific Building has 57 floors, with the executive lounge on the 57th floor and the restaurant on the 56th floor. We stayed on the 50th floor. The floor was high, the view was wide, and the floor-to-ceiling windows allowed us to overlook the city of Nanjing. It was very beautiful.
4. The front office, concierge, and cleaning staff were very enthusiastic and considerate. Unfortunately, I only remembered the names of two of them: Chen Mo and Wei Haiqiu, and did not remember the names of other staff members in the concierge and housekeeping depar**ents. Overall, the service attitude of the entire hotel was very good and excellent.
5. Fruit plates and snacks were provided upon check-in, and alcohol and beverages in the room were free.
6. There was also a thoughtful clothes drying rod after check-in, but you had to call the housekeeping depar**ent to ask for it. If you stay for a few more days, you can wash and dry clothes. It was very convenient.

In addition to its convenient location, the brand and reputation of Jinling are very popular among Nanjing people. It is definitely a face-saving experience to receive clients! In fact, I was not disappointed - I came to the hotel early in the morning to check the location, told the front desk about my various needs, and then they had a manager named Lin to receive me. She quickly arranged everything for me, and then said that she knew the importance of my clients to me and would assist me in receiving them. I didn't expect that Jinling Hotel would treat me and my clients as VIPs even though I was an ordinary customer! The key is that their fast, meticulous and thoughtful service during the reception process made my clients very satisfied. They praised their trip to Nanjing and promised to cooperate with our company. It seems that my choice was not wrong. Jinling Hotel is worth recommending!

It is located at Xinjiekou, next to Exit 6 of the subway, and there are many shopping malls nearby.
We booked Jinling Building, a family double room. The toys and interior decoration of the children in the room are great, and the children had a lot of fun. But I guess Jinling Building is an old building, so the decoration is still in the old style, and it is still a bit uncomfortable to take a shower in the bathtub.
Breakfast is on the first floor, with a wide variety of varieties, and the most important thing is that the taste is very good. The whole family praised it.
I recommend their Meiyuan Restaurant on the second floor. It is worthy of being a black pearl restaurant. The taste is great, the service is also very good, and there are discounts for guests staying in the hotel. But you must make an appoin**ent in advance. I also want to thank their Sun Yin for helping me make an appoin**ent!
This is the most satisfactory stay in Nanjing after so many times. I will choose Jinling Hotel next time!

In fact, I originally chose another hotel, but after seeing the good reviews for the breakfast, I changed to Jinling Hotel. It is really good, with local characteristics and good taste.

The room price is not cheap during the May Day holiday. The room I stayed in is in the old building. The so-called family room is actually a renovation of two adjacent rooms in the corner. The room facilities, especially the bathroom, are relatively old, but the details are still very serious and attentive

The breakfast is standard, with rich dishes, but for guests who stay for several days, it may lack some freshness. The waiters are enthusiastic and thoughtful, and the dishes are cleaned up and removed in a timely and efficient manner

In short, Jinling Hotel will be my first choice hotel to stay in Nanjing. I hope to try the new Asia Pacific Building next time

Although I felt that the pillow was a little high for children on the first night, I noticed that there were many kinds of pillows to choose from the next day, so I called to send them.
In addition to the regular washbasin in the room, there is also a separate bathroom (not a glass door) with a small pool for washing and washing hands, which is very convenient for guests who have small items to wash.
What was even more surprising was that after breakfast, I found that the aunt had come to clean up, which was quite rare on May Day. I thought she would come in the afternoon. When I came back from shopping in the evening, I found that the waiter came again and put a fruit plate for the children. I have to praise the front desk brother Zeng Rui for taking good care of us.
There is also an interesting place in the hotel. There is a "treasure box" in the public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe floor. Fruits appear from time to time. Children who get up early should be able to experience itü§≠

msg:I looked at many hotels in Nanjing before checking in. I booked this hotel because I thought it was conveniently located in the city center. After checking in, I really felt it was worth it. The hotel is clean, the service is definitely the best I have ever stayed in, and there are many types of breakfast. Because it was my child‚Äôs birthday on the day of check-in, the hotel not only sent flowers, but also a cakeüç∞, which is really ‚ù§Ô∏è

Check-in can enjoy the first round of free drinks in the refrigerator, beverages, beer and soda, which are free for two days. Hotel check-in parking can enjoy a capped discount of 20 yuan/day.
The front desk service is great. Knowing that we are here for tourism, we were given a room facing Xinjiekou.
I will stay here again if I have the chance.

msg:Very disappointing hotel. I came to Jinling for the first time in Nanjing and read the reviews. I spent more than 900 yuan thinking it should be good. The room can really be described as old and small. The decoration was in the 1990s, the facilities are old, and the bathroom still uses yellow shower curtains. The corners and door frames are all peeling paint. Can they be renovated and upgraded before selling? This kind of room is really a self-destructive signboard and has no cost-effectiveness. I sincerely remind friends to read more reviews before booking a room, don't be misled!

From the moment I got off the car and entered the hotel, the doorman took the initiative to open the car door, move the luggage, and pay attention to the arrival of the online car we booked. When I checked in at the front desk, the front desk staff saw that I said the sheets were too soft last time and I didn't sleep well, so they took the initiative to contact the floor service staff to add a brown mat, which was very considerate. The hardware is a hard flaw. The room is small, the distance between the twin beds is too small, especially the bathroom, there is no separate shower area, the bathtub drains very slowly, and my feet are soaked in the water for 10cm after taking a bath, which is quite speechless.

msg:The hotel is very close to the subway, which is convenient for going anywhere. It is located in the center of the business district. The hotel is an old hotel, and the lobby reception staff are very good. The room soundproofing is average, but the whole floor is still very quiet. There are stains on the sofa cushions, which should be cleaned but can't be cleaned. The overall hygiene is OK, and the mattress is a soft mattress. There were already quite a few people at 7 o'clock for breakfast. The variety is OK and the taste is not bad. I don't know what kind of specifics can be made in the place where duck blood vermicelli soup and noodles are made first. There was a staff member who had a very good temper at the reception for breakfast on the first day. When I put the food on the table and went to get other food, the napkins were already laid out. The staff I saw the next morning looked a little tired~ Maybe there were too many people for breakfast and they couldn't clean up. There were guests waiting for the table by the window to be cleaned up. The two staff members didn't notice it and were cleaning up the table next to them seriously.

msg:- Facilities: The Asia-Pacific Building is very standard and has the configuration of a qualified five-star hotel.
- Hygiene: Not bad, Virgo is quite satisfied.
- Service: Warm and polite, from the concierge to the front desk, and every staff in the restaurant is smiling. When checking out, they also asked how the stay was and if there are any improvements, and they responded to the questions sincerely.
- Dining: The hotel does not have many varieties of breakfast. I ate it for two days. I didn‚Äôt like the big meat buns, duck blood vermicelli soup, and salted duck (both of us are from Chengdu and Tianjin)... I still ate braised pork noodles and fried dough sticks. Yogurt is still very delicious, and you can add a lot of small ingredients. I ate several in the past two days.
- Environment: The hotel is located in a prime location in the city center, but to be honest, it is still not very convenient. There are no small restaurants, convenience stores, and tobacco shops downstairs. You have to walk a long distance. You have to go through the underground passage to go shopping in the mall. It takes a bit of effort to get there. It may be more convenient if you live in Deji across the street. (There are many places in Nanjing where pedestrians cannot cross the road, and the roads are crooked. It takes a long time to take a taxi to the same distance in other cities. We even avoided the Qingming Festival, and the traffic jam was still quite serious.)

The best food was the egg burger and wonton in the small shop. It is still good for tourism. I went to Confucius Temple, Qinhuai River, Laomendong, and Xuanwu Lake at night. It is very pleasant. The museum and the Memorial Hall of the Japanese Invaders are also worth visiting.

This time we stayed at the Asia Pacific Business Building, which is a new building with higher floors than the old building and a larger room. It is right next to the subway station Exit 6, with a superior location and very convenient travel. The most worthwhile thing is the breakfast on the 56th floor, Jinling meat buns, salted duck, and duck blood vermicelli soup, which are really delicious. I also bought a few meat buns when I went back this time.

You must stay in the new Asia Pacific Building, which is cleaner and tidier, and the facilities are newer.
I recommend the hotel breakfast, the Jinling meat buns and salted duck are really good. You can also order salted duck at the hotel's Meiyuan. I have tried many brands in Nanjing, but I still like theirs the most. Although it is more expensive than other brands, you get what you pay for.
In addition, I have to say that the hotel's emergency response is also very good. We bought the wrong Jinling buns by mistake, and they delivered it to us immediately.

msg:Because of the change of the people traveling with us, we wanted to change the room to a king-size bed room. We communicated with the front desk again and again before they agreed. They said with arrogance and indifference that we didn't have enough rooms to buy and there was no room for you to change. In short, the experience of this stay was particularly bad. Secondly, we stayed in Jinling Building. The hygiene was worrying. It felt like the wood was about to fall off, and there was dust falling from the door. The details were particularly poor. I looked at the room booked by Ctrip. Except for the good location, there was nothing else worth choosing. I had breakfast for two consecutive days without any change. It was exactly the same and there was no update at all. I suggest you eat out by yourself. This is my first time in Nanjing and my first time staying at Jinling Hotel. I don't want to book it for the second time. I brought my children for convenience, but the service and hygiene of the stay were too poor! Because of their seniority, they can take advantage of their seniority and there is no shortage of customers!

There are really a lot of people traveling in Nanjing recently. When we went to have breakfast at 9:30, there was not much left, and because it was almost over, there was no restocking. If you want to have breakfast, you should go early. We ordered the famous salted duck and Jinling meat buns from the front desk concierge. I thought it was the same freshly made meat buns as breakfast, but it was frozen, and it was made by Yechun. It was a big shock!

The front desk service was in place and we upgraded the room upon check-in. Because I didn‚Äôt know much about it, I didn‚Äôt stay in the Asia-Pacific Building. The rooms in the Jinling Building are too small. I‚Äôll try the Asia-Pacific Building next time I have the opportunity.
Swimming in the afternoon. The swimming pool is beautiful. There are not many people. It is very comfortable to exercise.
The hotel is in a good location. It's in the city center with the subway at the door. It's very convenient to travel. I even went to Deji Plaza to browse the luxurious bathroom that was said to have cost 12 million yuan. There are a lot of people and it's bustling.
Free drinks are provided upon check-in and fruits are given at night. Thank you‚ò∫Ô∏è

I had booked the Jinling Building before, but I found out that the price had been reduced the day before I came, so I canceled the previous order and booked a new one at the Asia-Pacific Building. I went there for the breakfast on the 56th floor. Yes, when I checked in on the 7th, the front desk upgraded me to the 50th floor because I said I wanted to see Xuanwu Lake. In the next few days, when the clouds cleared and the fog dispersed, I could see Xuanwu Lake very clearly. I don‚Äôt know who the lights in the back row were at night. It‚Äôs not the lights of the city wall, but the breakfast restaurant on the 56th floor can see the sunrise. Doesn‚Äôt it look like Godzilla vs. King Kong?
If you want to eat Jinling's famous snacks, you should stay at the Jinling Hotel. The only regret is that the wooden comb in the bathroom should be replaced, or at least the row comb. This one is too uncomfortable to use.

I was impressed by the reception manager He Yue and the front desk manager Xu Chen. They maintained professionalism and enthusiasm, patiently and in detail answered my questions, and took the initiative to explain the hotel's special services and surrounding tourist attractions to me.
Especially our floor attendant Sun Meixia, seeing that we brought the elderly, laid a non-slip mat in the washroom as soon as possible.

Careful and affectionate, these four words are the best summary of hotel services. Experienced the "Sleep Care Plan", tried two pillows with different pillow cores, experienced free shoe shine service, and received welcome fruits and drinks~~~The services of Xiao Guo, the waiter on the 31st floor, and Xiao Huang in the breakfast restaurant on the first floor All very impressive and welcoming. There is a receptionist with intermediate level English at the reception desk which makes people feel more friendly. He told me that the hotel conducts an English test every year to evaluate the English proficiency of service staff. "Internationalization" is not only reflected in the foreign language channels on TV, but also in the service and care. Because the hotel experience was so good, we also chose the Meiyuan Restaurant on the second floor of the hotel and experienced the ceiling level of Huaiyang cuisine.

msg:There are many five-star hotels in Nanjing. I compared many of them before checking in. Many of them are foreign-funded hotels. The Jinling Hotel is a national brand with a glorious history, so I came here to take a look. The check-in experience was great. The room attendant Li Hong was attentive in cleaning. Miss Pan Yuxian, the ambassador of Jinling, gave a warm reception. The whole hotel was very warm. I will stay here again next time I come to Nanjing.

Relatives move in. This choice is very correct! Soft power services are in place. From the doorman proactively helping to open the car door, to checking in and out at the lobby front desk efficiently and quickly, to cleaning the guest room, the staff has a strong sense of service quality.
The front desk service answered all questions on the phone, and the rooms in the back were quickly arranged. When the staff Hong Cuihong delivered fruits, he enthusiastically helped us surf the Internet on our mobile phones and responded to our requests.
Although the hardware is lacking (no smart toilet yet), the bath water is particularly good! The water is hot and big. It's enough to relieve fatigue, and the room is well soundproofed. The guests were very satisfied with their stay.
Jinling Hotel has convenient transportation. Check in at the internet celebrity toilet in Deji Plaza. very funny. Go to Laomendong to see the lights at night...

Facilities: I originally booked the Jinling Building. I was recommended by the front desk to upgrade to the Asia-Pacific Building because I liked the view. The room is quite large. There is a dressing room right at the entrance, with a bathtub and a shower room. The toilet is separate. The TV can be cast to the table. The cabinet also has small items such as scissors, pencils, rubber rulers, and paper clips, which are very thoughtful. There is also an air purifier in the room.
Hygiene: Auntie said that cleaning is usually completed before 12 o'clock. Because I turned on Do Not Disturb, auntie did not come in to clean, but she left a card at the door. One time I was in the room during cleaning, and my aunt cleaned the bathtub, washed the toilet, and wiped the dust.
Meal: I tried breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the staff arranged seats for all three meals. Breakfast is on the 56th floor of the Asia-Pacific Building, with a rich variety, and you can see the scenery from the window; lunch and dinner are on the first floor of Golden Bay, which is very crowded during holidays. There are many kinds of food, and you can pick up as many sashimi as you like.

msg:Before coming to Nanjing this time, I read a lot of platform reviews and guides. Although the decoration of Jinling is older, it is recognized for its good service and good location. It is opposite Deji. It is convenient for shopping. It only costs about 10 yuan to go to various attractions. Arrival, the subway is also very convenient. After arriving at the store, you can feel the enthusiasm of each service staff. While waiting to check in, the service staff will enthusiastically provide you with tea. After moving in, the furniture and other equipment in the room were also well maintained, old and not shabby. The bed is of moderate firmness, the quilt is light and soft, relatively comfortable, and the air conditioning is powerful. The swimming pool depth is divided into 1.2 and 1.6, which is friendly to children. It is open from 6:00 to 23:00, which is very good. I just didn't expect that the shower head was broken when I took a shower at night. As long as I opened the water valve, my head would fall off. The shower head fell off, and it is easy to think of it as the XXX that has been circulating on the Internet for flushing. It was already midnight that night and I didn't contact the hotel for repairs or room changes. It was inconvenient and difficult for me to take a shower with my children. When checking out the next day, when the front desk asked about the check-in experience, I learned that the shower head was broken. They had a good attitude and kept apologizing. I felt the sincerity of the hotel service staff. However, I don‚Äôt dare to think too much about the shower head... I have been staying in 5-star hotels in various cities. This is the first time I have encountered this situation. I hope it is just broken. This also became the only regret of this trip to Nanjing.

msg:1. The air conditioning facilities are too poor! It was extremely hot when I stayed in the hotel before. Today I stayed in the hotel and there was always a cold wind. At first I thought I was ventilating it, but it turned out that the cold wind kept blowing. My family also felt the cold wind, so I couldn‚Äôt help but call the front desk. The waiter came and said it was OK. The problem was reported to the maintenance technician, who took almost half an hour to come over and explain: Although the air is blowing cold air, the central air conditioner is different from the one in your home. I said that my home also has central air conditioning. The master was surprised and immediately said that it must be different between home and commercial use. Summary for me: Although you feel like the cold wind is blowing, this is what commercial central air conditioners are like. Let me call you if there are any problems later. Seeing that it was almost 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, I quickly ordered an oil tincture. After I opened the oil tin, it felt much warmer.
2. If the item is damaged, return it to the guest! I took a glass from the drawer to drink some hot water, but I found that the mouth of the glass was damaged and the mouth was still inside. Fortunately, I didn't drink from it, otherwise I would have cut my mouth in a big way!
3. The service is very good! The environment and service in the lobby are very good. Someone took the initiative to help me with my luggage. The newly bought clothes were very wrinkled and the lady even took the initiative to help me iron them. It was very heart-warming!
4. Checked in to Meiyuan on the second floor, the environment, food and service are great! Homemade health tea is very good.
Overall, stay at Jinling Hotel for a romantic stay! I hope more facilities can be improved!

msg:After its completion in the 1980s, the Jinling Hotel (now the old building) reigned as the tallest building in China for several years. It was this building that I saw when looking toward the city from the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. When we accompany foreigners to Nanjing, we always stay at the Jinling Hotel.

It‚Äôs been 40 years since I stayed at the Jinling Hotel again with a touch of nostalgia. Although the hotel is generally less luxurious than modern new hotels, it is still warm and welcoming.

More importantly, I am delighted to find that after so many years, the hotel's management is still as humane as before, which is very commendable. The hotel staff's proactive and enthusiastic service behavior brings guests a feeling of going home, such as the Jinling specially designed by the hotel. The ambassador position is a very good measure. For example, the sweet smile and professional service of the Jinling Ambassador Pan Yuxian I met added a lot to the hotel's image.

When you come to Nanjing, choosing Jinling Hotel must be a true decision.

In particular, the service staff Sun Meixia and Zhu Jingjing kept the guest rooms neat and clean, met the needs of me and my children, patiently answered our questions, and provided us with fresh fruits every day, making us feel at home.
The hotel has complete facilities, such as gym, swimming pool, conference rooms, etc., which can meet the needs of different guests.
The hotel's location is excellent: the hotel is located in a place with convenient transportation and beautiful surrounding environment. It is next to Xinjiekou Subway Station, making it convenient for guests to travel and sightsee.
The hotel's restaurant offers delicious and unique dishes, allowing guests to taste local specialties. Salted duck, duck blood vermicelli soup, Jinling meat buns
All are memorable.
highly recommended! ! !

When I came here in March last year, I felt that the quality of Meiyuan Salted Duck had dropped. This time, it has restored its quality and is delicious. There are various Nanjing snacks for breakfast, all of which taste good. However, as the oldest five-star hotel in Nanjing, the facilities are a bit old. The elevator in the Asia Pacific Building is windy and a bit cold.

For dinner on the two days, we chose Golden Bay and Meiyuan restaurants in the hotel. The prices were not low, but the taste was so good that it was worth it. It should be said that it is a Jinling Hotel.

msg:A well-known and old five-star hotel in Nanjing, it has undergone more than 40 years of development and changes. In the dead of winter, I took my 86-year-old mother back to visit the old place and chose to stay at Jinling Hotel Xinjiekou.
1) We arrived at the hotel at around 10 o'clock in the morning, and there was no room yet. The front desk asked me to register first and walk around. I came back to the front desk to get the key at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The front desk specifically reminded me that the elderly should lay non-slip mats when taking a bath at night, and pay attention to safety. It was heartwarming!
2) I came back late, and the hotel waiter had laid a non-slip mat in the bathtub and sent fruit. It was considerate!
3) The waiter saw the elderly at breakfast and took the initiative to guide and arrange seats. It was enthusiastic!
4) The hotel management, service and hygiene are very good, and it is indeed a beautiful business card of Nanjing;
5) Jinling Hotel is located in the downtown area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNanjing Xinjiekou, with extremely convenient transportation. The hotel gate is right behind the subway line No. 6;
6) There are many businesses around Jinling Hotel, and Deji Plaza is just opposite. Go in through subway Exit 6 and Exit 7 to the basement of Deji Plaza;
7) Walk through Deji Plaza to Changjiang Road and walk to the Presidential Palace. There are many historical sites along the way, where you can stop.
8) Take a taxi to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Scenic Area and other places. There is no road closure when you return, so you can take a taxi back after leaving the scenic area.

There were some minor problems during my stay. I got help from Mr. Liu from the front office and colleagues from the concierge department in the lobby, and they were quickly solved. The service was fast and efficient.

You should book early during the holidays, otherwise there will be no room. Nanjing is a popular tourist destination and Jinling is very cost-effective.

msg:I stayed in Jinling on a business trip. The Jinling Hotel is located in the center of Nanjing. There are many international five-star hotels around, but none of them have as long a history as the Jinling Hotel. Pan Yuxian, the guest relations director of the hotel, entertained warmly and thoughtfully. He also introduced the rooms in the Asia-Pacific Building. I plan to experience it next time. After a while, the room attendant Li Hong cleaned up and was careful. Jiang Siyuan at the front desk and Dai Shichao in the lobby also had a very enthusiastic service attitude. I will stay here again next time I come to Nanjing.

The only thing that feels old is the door, the bathroom door and the room door. Due to the door, the sound insulation is very poor! The soundproofing of the room is not good either. You can hear the slightly louder conversations next door very clearly! And the door is almost touching.
The location is really good. It‚Äôs at the intersection of Metro Lines 1 and 2, so it‚Äôs convenient to go anywhere! Metro Exit 6 is 30 meters away from the hotel!
The hotel's gym and swimming pool are shared with the new building - Asia Pacific Building, very good, very good!
Speaking of service, it is really outstanding. From the doorman at the door, to the front desk, to the guest rooms, to the wellness center staff, everyone is polite and well-trained! It deserves a lot of praise! ! Great, great! !

msg:When I have time, I take my children to Nanjing for a walk. I live in Xinjiekou, and it is extremely convenient for eating, drinking and shopping in the surrounding area. There is a subway station downstairs, which has high traffic efficiency. It only takes ten minutes to go to Zhanyuan, Xuanwu Lake and other scenic spots. Zeng Rui at the front desk was enthusiastic and thoughtful. He made active and appropriate arrangements for my accommodation needs. He also arranged a room facing the bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen in Xinjiekou. Thank you very much! Our child is considered to be a middle-aged child, and most of the slippers given to us when we stayed in hotels were too big. Cheng Ying, the waiter at Jinling, was very professional and considerate, and brought our children slippers that fit just right and special toiletries. The size of the guest room is not large, and the hardware facilities are a bit old, but they are well maintained and clean. The breakfast is very rich, including duck blood vermicelli soup, salted duck, Jinling meat buns and other Nanjing specialties, which are also delicious. The only drawback for me is that the coffee doesn‚Äôt taste good. The machines used in the hotel are a Calome and a very old Shelley. I feel that the maintenance of the machine and the selection of coffee beans and milk are not good enough. The latte produced is drinkable. The aroma of coffee and the mellowness of milk are not revealed. Overall, it was a very satisfying stay. Every time I come to Jinling, there will be small surprises. I can feel the hotel's profound heritage and the service quality is always online.

The upper floors overlook the city view, the room layout is good, and there is a separate bathroom with a sink, a separate washroom, and a separate shower room.

The service was good when checking in, but not so enthusiastic after checking out... There was no one to help with luggage, etc.

First of all, the room in Jinling Building is too small and the facilities are outdated. Especially the fact that you stand in the bathtub to take a bath is unacceptable. The bathroom smells back after taking a shower, which is very disappointing. It is cleaner and more comfortable than this one in the whole season, and it is more cost-effective. The advantage is that it is 100 meters away from the subway entrance and exit No. 6. Breakfast is too expensive, Jinling big meat buns are delicious.

She said I was sorry and wanted to call us when the time came. I asked her if she could issue an electronic ticket? Sorry for the answer. We can only issue paper tickets. Electronic tickets are already popular in 90% of hotels. They still can't keep up with the trend. Shouldn't the management of such a five-star hotel reflect? Finally, he asked me as a routine if I was satisfied with my stay. I didn't even bother to answer the question and left. The service doesn't just stop at the process.

The night view of the city was very beautiful, and the sky in the early morning before the sun rose was full of tranquility and distance. The hotel's service is excellent and the staff are warm and friendly. On the day of check-in, the floor manager personally introduced us to the travel guide.

The service attitude of the hotel staff is very special. The waiters at the gate do not help with luggage; the waiters in the restaurant do not let others walk and get ahead of the guests.

Next time I go to Nanjing, I will not choose Jinling Hotel again.

The three-day stay experience was very good. The hotel is in an excellent location, overlooking the Xinjiekou Statue, and No. 1 is downstairs. Line and Line 2 are very convenient to go to various attractions, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about traffic jams during holidays. The disadvantage is that the price increases during holidays, 1,400 on weekdays and 2,400 on holidays; the rooms in the Jinling Building are not big and the facilities are a bit older, but fortunately they are well maintained. Some suggestions: The glass plate and wine glasses on the top of the bar should be cleaned. After staying here for three days, the dust has increased day by day and has not been scrubbed. After each cleaning, the placement of toiletries is restored to the factory value. It is not respectful to the residents. guest habits.

The most worth sharing is the hotel's service. Nanfang's service is not only perfect but also extremely considerate. Jinling has achieved the ultimate. All the staff I saw in the hotel have very good attitudes. Their sincere smiles and guidance will make you feel very sincere. It is very convenient to receive express delivery.

I went to the new building when I checked in. Fortunately, the two buildings are not far apart and I just walked through the corridor to get there. The service is very good, they will ask if they need help picking up the boxes.
I was assigned to the 18th floor, but the room faces north, which is a pity and the view is not great. The room is not big and the facilities and decoration are in an old style, which is understandable. But I didn‚Äôt expect that the windows in the previous high-rise buildings were all sealed, probably for fear of safety issues. üòìThe paper towels in the room are only available in the toilet, so they are probably included together. All in all, the experience was not very good, probably because the room I booked was too low-end. Welcome fruit was given, which was okay. The only most obvious advantage is the good location, with major high-end shopping malls nearby, where you can buy everything you want to eat.

Hygiene: It is indeed a long-established hotel. It is said that this year is the 40th anniversary. It is full of details. Starting from the fragrance in the lobby, I fell in love with it;
Environment: The hotel is very large, with two floors. The older one is the Jinling Building, and we live in the Asia-Pacific Building. There are also various small shops in the hotel. The executive lounge on 56F is also great. The hotel is right in front of the subway line 2. ,Very convenient;
Service: The most noteworthy thing is the service. 1. From the day before I arrived in Nanjing, Xiaoma in the executive lounge checked with me the travel details and communicated in advance my route to the hotel;
2. After arriving at the hotel, I checked in smoothly. Then when I got to the room, the guest room sister, Sister Sun Meixia, gave me a piece of fruit. Seeing that we were both girls, she took the initiative to give me two more bath towels, which was very considerate;
3. Breakfast: Because of the tight schedule, we went to breakfast early. The service staff Zhan Wengang and Jiao Yanan were also very proactive in serving us. In addition to collecting the tableware, they also reminded us that the freshly squeezed juice was just right, and proactively asked us if the juice was just right. It needs to be sent, it‚Äôs awesome;
4. Key point, key point, here comes the key point. Zhao Jun, the duty manager of the hotel, is so considerate. He thought of what I thought and what I didn‚Äôt think of. I originally only wanted to stay for one night and then changed to another hotel, but because of him, because of Jinling Belt It gave me the feeling of going home and I stayed one more night. A good manager is the key to a hotel's success. He can lead a team well and serve each batch of guests well, which not only increases the hotel's revenue but also increases the hotel's revenue. It has expanded the hotel's popularity, and at the same time, it can pass on this work attitude to every grassroots employee and become the little sun of the team. Thank you to Manager Zhao for his professional service and enthusiastic attitude. I hope that the hotel's senior leaders can see My review is rewarded by Manager Zhao. Because of him, all my friends and family will recommend Jinling Hotel when they come to Nanjing in the future. Thank you for making my trip to Jinling the icing on the cake^_^

Service: The service attitude is really very goodüëç! Compared with other hotels of the same level, it really gives people the highest level of comfort. From the moment you enter the door, they help with luggage and open and close the car door. They are very attentive and always ask if you need help. Since I arrived earlier, I temporarily stored my luggage in the hotel to go shopping, and when I came back to pick it up, I didn't lose anything. Check-in at the front desk is also very fast, and you can hand in your card in less than a minute. The beautiful women speak softly. It was because of the beautiful woman at the front desk on the first day that I decided to continue my stay here. I plan to only stay here in the future.

The first round of mini bar drinks in the room is free, and there are fruits, and the fruit plate is also equipped with a fruit knife. I strongly recommend Jinling Hotel, the price is reasonable and the service is top-notch.

Environment: The lobby is clean and tidy, with good landscaping and a rest area, which is a plus. The room is decorated with local style characteristics, which can make people unconsciously think of the prosperous Nanjing more than ten years ago. It has a sense of story during the Republic of China. When visiting Nanjing for the first time, you can just go without thinking and have an immersive experience.

Facilities: The room is equipped with a plasma hair dryer, which is of better quality than hotels of the same level and pays more attention to details. There are many kinds of pillows to choose from, which is good news for people who are picky about sleep. They wake up feeling comfortable and restored. The bathroom uses an acca kappa set, which is quite fragrant. There are four types of cups, double servings, and a complete set of stationery, only you can't think of it without them, highly recommended! ! !

If you really want to have breakfast, you have to eat outside. I went to the restaurant on the 56th floor of the Asia Pacific Building at nine o'clock. Most of the dishes were Chinese dishes, which were relatively greasy. There were few Western dishes. The only bacon and sausages were cold and were not replenished in time. I got a bowl of tofu curd, but it turned out to be mushy. It smelled mushy and tasted mushy. When I left, I reported it to the front desk. The front desk took it very seriously, but in the end the chef came back and said that organic soybeans were used, so the taste was so. It's a bit big, and because it was made at 6 o'clock, it will last for a long time, so what can I say, I just don't recommend it. The overall living experience is okay, and the full set of toiletries are from L'Occitane, which is not bad.

The biggest feeling is service first, and I feel the ultimate service from checkin. Chen Mo took the initiative to arrange a free breakfast for us to take care of the children. We asked if we could check out later and arranged for a 2:00 check-out, so that we could go swimming the next day, and helped us to carry our luggage to the elevator. I really feel that there is a service above seven stars.

We lived on the 14th floor and it was a bit stuffy when we first entered the room, so we called the service center to ask if they could help open the windows. After a while, two service girls came, one brought a fruit plate, and the other came over with an air purifier. They were really flattered and moved. I looked at the nameplates, one is Li Hong and the other is Zong Wangying. I really have to call them out and praise them.

On the second day, the breakfast was also very special. The waiter arranged the seats and led the position very comfortably. The food has the authentic characteristics of Nanjing. Not only did I eat my favorite salted duck, but also duck blood vermicelli soup and beef pot stickers, coffee taste It's also amazing, full-bodied and full-bodied.

It is a pity that due to time, we only stayed for one night and left the hotel, leaving a perfect impression on our children. Jinling Hotel is not the most luxurious building now, but the service style is indeed top-notch. I definitely recommend it.

I also went to enjoy the Hui¬∑Executive Lounge on the 57th floor. For breakfast, I called and applied to go to a restaurant. The duck blood vermicelli soup is a must! ! ! The soup is clear and delicious, and the ingredients are rich. Coupled with the beautiful high-altitude scenery, it really tastes better than the golden bay! Thank you Manager Dai and Xiaoyou for their warm hospitality, beautiful and elegant! Warm and thoughtful!

After staying in the room, there was a little episode in the middle, and they were very attentive after reacting to the hotel. After going to solve the problem! I can really feel their sincerity during the process. We stayed for three consecutive days. We can feel their service and courtesy when we go in and out or eat in restaurantsüëç

Afterwards, let‚Äôs talk about the advantages of the hotel. We first booked the most worthwhile restaurant in the hotel (Meiyuan Restaurant). On that day, the hotel sent a cake for Mr.‚Äôs birthday. The restaurant also gave a small gift üéÅ very heartwarming!

Hotel breakfast is also very good üëç

Finally, I would like to thank the on-duty manager on the 21st and the early shift manager on the 22nd. When communicating with you, I can feel that you hope that every guest who comes to your hotel will leave happily!

The experience was really bad! I originally came to live in Jinling with feelings, but the result was so disappointing! First of all, they actually charge a deposit for check-in. Nowadays, many hotels do not charge deposits, which seems petty! Secondly, the windows of the Asia-Pacific Building cannot be opened, and there is no fresh air system. The room is extremely simmering, and there is no air conditioning. It feels like I can't breathe! The rooms in Jinling Building are old, shabby and small! Not a five-star standard at all! Totally not worth the price!

After the hotel exits from Xinjiekou Subway Station along Exit 6, the Jinling Fengshang underground passage on the left leads to the hotel lobby. Going to various attractions, whether it is a subway trip or a taxi trip, is a compromise. The occupancy rate of the hotel is very high, and it is quiet amidst the noise.
The Asia-Pacific building where I live is a new high-rise building. The room is quite large, and the layout matches the picture. It is said that it was just renovated in 2020, but the style is still relatively old and traditional. The hotel should promote environmental protection, so the trash cans in the room are not covered with plastic bags.
Breakfast is served for a long time from 7:00 to 10:00. It is rich and delicious, and Nanjing's special breakfast is available.
If you stay, you can use the swimming pool and gym for free. The cafeteria on the first floor is also very good, there are quite a lot of diners, and the dinner is basically full. The photos are not enough.

Let‚Äôs list what I saw and heard after spending 8k‚ûï in 2 days, including but not limited to, the room in the Asia-Pacific Building smelled of disinfectant, and the water pressure was surprisingly low, barely enough to take a shower. I wanted to take a bath after a long day of playing, but what came out was not water but water droplets. Why would a five-star hotel give me water droplets when I take a bath? I went out to play for a day and couldn‚Äôt fill a pool of water when I came back? The executive lounge is very big but also very confusing. The breakfast is surprisingly poor. The two buildings share a small restaurant. It is small and crowded. It can be seen that the chef who cooks is also very helpless. He is completely overwhelmed. I am so tired of typing that I can‚Äôt stop complaining. , that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll write, but I definitely won‚Äôt go there a second time.

msg:Lightning protection. Jinling Hotel is a leading hotel management brand in China. I was very much looking forward to it before checking in, but after actually staying, I can only describe it as a disappoin**ent. The biggest problem is the air conditioner. There is no cold air at all. The room is stuffy and hot, which directly leads to basically no sleep at night. I asked maintenance personnel to come and fix it, and the answer was that there was nothing wrong with the air conditioner. There is no problem with the air conditioner. If I turn it on to 16 degrees Celsius for 5 hours, the temperature in the room is still 27 degrees Celsius. This is just a joke. Secondly, the service attitude of the swimming pool lifeguards is extremely poor and they yell at guests. I'm really surprised that such service staff exists in a five-star hotel. The breakfast was extremely crowded and the quality of the food was very average, not worthy of five stars. Room facilities are very old. It was originally a two-night trip. After staying for one night and checking out early, I can only say that I really didn‚Äôt want to stay any longer.

It's just that there are too many people in summer and it's noisy. Also because I stayed at the hotel, I ate at the Meiyuan Restaurant, otherwise I would have to queue for a long time, and I was given a 12% discount. All in all, it was a wonderful stay experience, next time I plan to live in the Asia-Pacific Building to experience it~

Although the decoration is relatively unfashionable, it is cleaned and set up very well, not looking old. Roll call üëç: The waiters at the Golden Bay restaurant for breakfast üíÅü¶© Yan Junyang and Zhang Jingpeng ü¶© served very well. There were 7 of us, old and young, the location was very suitable, and the service was very good. The location is in the center of Xinjiekou, but it is more convenient to take a taxi directly if you are traveling with the elderly or children. Although the subway is under the B floor of the hotel, you can go out, but I personally feel that there are many subway entrances at the new entrance, and walking underground is very dizzy, and it takes a long time to walk, which is tiring. Exit at Exit 6 of the Xinjiekou subway, and there is an elevator at Jinling Fengshang to the hotel lobby. In addition, when you go out of the gate and turn left, there is an escalator and you can go directly to the subway, which is more convenient. The shallowest part of the swimming pool is 1.3 meters deep. It is on the 4th floor of the Asia-Pacific Building. You have to go to the elevator of the Asia-Pacific Building. The night view of the executive floor on the 57th floor of the Asia-Pacific Building is amazing. You can spend money to buy a cup of tea or coffee and sit in the administrative building. , enjoy the beautiful scenery of Nanjing.

In addition to getting a round of minibar (actually, you can drink freely in the refrigerator) when you stay in the hotel, there is also a waiter who specially sent a plate of fruit as a check-in gift.
It's a pity that the video cannot be uploaded, the room is really great! The service attitude is also very good! It must be emphasized!

It's worthy of 5 stars, and I don't know how those with bad reviews got it...but my experience is very good.

The day before arriving in Nanjing, Butler Kong Mengtian called to inquire about the itinerary and whether any arrangements for special anniversaries were needed. After arriving, the hotel staff were friendly and responsible. The room is quite large and has a good view.

The bathroom in the room is alone on the other side of the corridor, separate from the sink and bathroom, which is a bit special but does not affect use. Except for the life-size mirror in the bathroom, which is a bit scary (), I like everything else. Overall, it was a very good stay.

I wanted to travel conveniently with my baby, so I chose the Jinling Hotel at the subway entrance. The location of the hotel is very good. When you go out, turn left and you are at Exit 6 of Xinjiekou Line 2. You can quickly reach Deji, Xinbai, and ifcx by walking around the underground passage. It is very convenient to buy tea after breakfast. Go there early in the morning Only waited 15 minutes to get it.
I stayed in the parent-child suite of Jinling Building. To be honest, the facilities are a bit old, but the hotel service is very good. It happened to be my birthday during the stay, so I got a love omelette for breakfast, roses in the room, and a birthday cake at night!
The service in the cafeteria on the first floor of the hotel is also very good. There were already a lot of people when we went there on the first day. We arranged a corner by the window and brought baby chairs as soon as we sat down. During the two-day dining period, Ren Qian and Jing Peng sent them A small biscuit for the baby üòä
In short, if you come again next time, you will still choose Jinling Hotel!

I was upgraded to a city view room for free. The room is bright and comfortable. The stationery box on the desk is very considerate. There are 6 free drinks in the mini bar drink.

What makes me more satisfied in the shower room is that there is no need to wait for hot water, and hot water comes out in seconds. The foot bath supplies are white moss, which smells fresh and pleasant, and the Dyson hair dryer is equipped with a weighing scale.

The brightness of the night light for rest at night is appropriate, and it can always be said that it is the best sleep quality I have had recently.

I thought that I would not be able to eat Nanjing snacks in time for the two-day business trip. After listening to Manager Zhou‚Äôs hotel catering history, I didn‚Äôt hesitate to add a breakfast. I tasted the most distinctive Jinling big meat buns and duck blood vermicelli soup. Duck oil shortbread, etc., a model of Chinese breakfast! Also, thank you to Xiaoqi and Jingling for the little gift box that I received from you. The service from the lady manager in the lobby is very heartwarming.

The location is very superior, surrounded by the most famous shopping malls, there are underground subway passages, you can walk there, take a taxi to Confucius Temple, Pioneer Bookstore is the starting price, and it only takes 40 minutes to go to Niushou Mountain, which is very convenient.


Overall, it was a very comfortable and satisfying business trip, and I hope to have the opportunity to stay again next time!

Room facilities:
The hotel is divided into Jinling Building and Asia-Pacific Building. This time I booked the Asia-Pacific Building. The floor is high and has a good view. It overlooks the old city of Nanjing.

Serve:
As an established hotel, the service naturally maintains a standard. The staff from the front desk to the floor are very considerate, and they actively deal with some of our needs. I came back late after going out to play, and there were more than 100 tables waiting for a table when I went out to eat, so I ordered a bunch of takeaways and went back to the hotel. I would like to thank the two young ladies Sun Meixia and Wu Ailing, who have a very good attitude and are very enthusiastic and quick to help us. Tidy up the room, thank you for your hard work üëèüèª

breakfast:
The breakfast category is relatively rich, mainly Chinese. Because there was a wedding banquet the night before, a view breakfast was prepared for the couple üëçüèªüëçüèª

wifi:
surprisingly stable

bed:
The softness and hardness are just right. I used to recognize the bed, but I didn't feel uncomfortable.

health:
Floor rounds are very strict, so that we will find out the places that we haven't found in time and deal with them immediately.

Location Traffic:
It's Titi Xinjiekou Station when you go out, and the shopping mall is opposite, so it's not too convenient to go shopping and eat.

swimming pool:
The swimming pool is on the 4th floor, and it is also divided into deep water and shallow water areas. The lifeguards are also very responsible

Gym:
I went to see it, and the facilities are still very complete. The equipment and some physical training equipment are quite complete, because I go out every day and the crowded people are equivalent to exercising, so I didn‚Äôt actually use it

msg:When you come to Jinling City, there is no reason not to choose Jinling Hotel. Of course, Nanjing people call him a 36-story building. The transportation is convenient, the subway entrance is just in front of the hotel. There is nothing to say about the service. Zeng Rui's service at the front desk is very careful and thoughtful, which is worthy of the Jinling standard. In the evening, you can go to the executive lounge on the 57th floor to overlook the afterglow of the sunset over the Yangtze River, and the scenery of Xuanwu Lake and mountains, until the night fades away. Meiyuan food must be clocked in, but the stomach is too small.

The hotel waiter Pan Yuxian contacted in advance to prepare the room, and also presented afternoon tea at the Asia Pacific Building on the 57th floor, overlooking Nanjing City, Xuanwu Lake, Jiming Temple, Linggu Pagoda... The experience was very good. The Huaiyang cuisine in the hotel's Chinese restaurant is exquisite, salted duck, lion's head with crab noodles, Wensi tofu, shredded duck with shrimps and fresh vegetables are all excellent products, it is worth a try.

Just one point. It‚Äôs really disgusting to charge 20 yuan a day for parking for a few days. How can the room fee of 1200 a day be short of the 20 yuan parking fee? It can be added to the room fee or it can be added! I really don't understand üò°

If you choose Nanjing Jinling Hotel, you will never deceive me. The hotel is the first batch of five-star old brands, with an excellent location, with Deji Square at the door. The hotel has a history of 40 years, and now it is newly renovated with complete hardware facilities. Staying with children for 4 nights and 5 days, you can be surrounded by the enthusiasm of the hotel's service staff every day. Jason and Li Hong from the room depar**ent brought us drinks and fruits. The guest room depar**ent will make return visits and after-sales service inquiries for every request of customers, which is very good! The little brother at the front desk when we checked in enthusiastically introduced us to the night view of the Qinhuai River at the Confucius Temple in Nanjing. Find the receptionist Jin Yu and Lin Wenwen, they will definitely recommend the most satisfactory room for you.
I like Nanjing and Jinling Hotel, and I will come again next time!

I left the store today, thanks to Miss Cai Yuke, the ambassador of Jinling, for sending a small gift after checking out. Brother Yin Ming at the front desk was enthusiastic about the procedures. I deeply feel that the five-star hotels in the motherland are getting leaner and leaner, and have created a very profound brand image! Let the guests really feel the experience of going home. Give them a super five-star praise!

Check in The professional service of the handsome guy Liu Xindong at the front desk made me immediately decide to upgrade to the executive room of the Asia-Pacific Building to enjoy the executive lounge. The warm and thoughtful service of the customer service staff Shi Liting and Sun Meixia made us very warm. The breakfast on the 56th floor is very rich, and there are many Nanjing representatives. Food, service Sheng Qianru, Tingyu‚Äôs beautiful and considerate service is very happy to eat ^_^, the thoughtful service of the manager Zhu at the front desk when we checked out allowed us to check out by phone in the room, which saved us time and effort and made us feel very convenient. We felt warm from the moment we entered the hotel to when we left Thoughtful and professional, it shows that the personnel training from the second line to the first line is professional and thoughtful, which is worthy of praise! Nowadays, hotels are fighting for service. It is gratifying that state-owned hotels can provide such professional, warm and thoughtful service. I hope that state-owned hotels can learn from it.

msg:I took my family on a trip a few years ago, this is the second time I stayed in a hotel, and it still surprises me. Originally, I formed a friend bureau that I haven‚Äôt seen for many years. Ctrip booked a room and I would come to handle and pay first. I didn‚Äôt want my buddies to pay for something urgent. I felt very sorry, so I called the hotel with the attitude of giving it a try. Called the front desk and wanted to ask how to deal with the situation of "paying at the store". The manager Tang Lei from the reservation depar**ent was quick to provide a satisfactory solution at the fastest speed. It really made people worry and feel at ease. When checking in I also got the enthusiastic help of Ding Qin, the parking lot manager, and my good impression of Jinling Hotel has increased a lot! The location is excellent, the environment is pleasant, the room is quite spacious, and the sleeping is very comfortable!
The only thing that I hope can be improved is "there is no washlet in the toilet". The public toilets in the lobby of JI Hotel have washlets. We can't be as good as JI.
When I went to the toilet, I read the Jinling Hotel brand manual, and I understood why the staff can make customers so satisfied:

When a guest walks into the hotel, it is time for us to do things with our heart;
When guests need help, it is time for us to create surprises;
When a customer encounters difficulties, it is time for us to move the customer.

I think it's very good. All hotel employees should follow this practice. Persistence is word of mouth!

I didn't take any photos of the hotel, so I put a few photos of my visit to Nanjing to eat, drink and have fun.

Who would have thought that in the high-end carpets of five-star hotels, sharp nails appeared in many places on the carpet. Before that, we and the children were walking barefoot and even playing on the ground. God bless me, I stepped on it first. I was stung by something like glass slag, I was startled, and immediately took my mobile phone to check on the ground, only to see that there were small nails on the carpet.
The more I think about it these days, the more frightened I am. If my four-year-old child just ran around, what would happen if he fell on it, what would happen to his head, eyes, and feet?
After thinking about it today, I still posted a comment saying that it‚Äôs not that the hotel is not good. The manager on duty also communicated with us after the problem happened, and then asked the waiter to spread towels on the floor for us. When we checked out the next day, the hotel manager also said sorry in person. , I just want to tell everyone that even if you live in a five-star hotel and experience it with your baby, don‚Äôt wear slippers or touch the ground with your hands. The carpet is really not as clean as you think. Remember to wear shoes to avoid scratches.

msg:After graduating from Nanjing in 2004, it was the first time in 19 years that I took my lover and child to Nanjing to travel, just thinking about going back to my third hometown and my alma mater.
When I was in Nanjing more than 20 years ago, the name of Jinling Hotel was very popular. Over the years, although various hotels have sprung up, I still choose Jinling Hotel without hesitation, just because of the obsession in my heart. Facts have proved that the choice is correct.
Facilities: Because I stayed in the Asia-Pacific Building, it is relatively new and quite satisfactory.
Hygiene: The room is very clean and tidy, which meets my requirements and habits. Although it is on the smoking floor, there is no smell.
Environment: The location of the hotel is very good, the night view is beautiful, and the most prosperous side of Nanjing is completely displayed in front of you.
Service: The service is very considerate. When you enter the door, the staff will help you with your luggage and guide you to the Asia-Pacific Building for check-in. When you go through the formalities at the front desk of the hotel, Mr. Tang‚Äôs way of communication makes you feel very comfortable. What a coincidence to meet my junior here. I received the check-in fruit as soon as I checked into the room. In the morning, I took my child to have breakfast on the 56th floor of the Asia-Pacific Building. My son was a little upset. Jiao Yanan and Ms. Wei Tingting in the restaurant were very thoughtful and took some biscuits that the child liked to ease my embarrassment and let my lover and I have a comfortable meal. breakfast. By the way, I personally think that the breakfast at Jinling Hotel is great, including a variety of Nanjing snacks, and the chef will also give some thoughtful suggestions.
But unfortunately, because of the tight schedule, I only stayed for two nights, and I didn't spare time to taste lunch and dinner at the hotel. Next time I come back, I must stay a few more days.
Written at the end, this time I came back to see Er Yuelan who has been missing for 19 years. I saw that she is more beautiful than 19 years ago. I wish my alma mater better and better, and I wish Nanjing better and better. However, I personally feel that the catering at my alma mater is not as good as it was 20 years ago. There is no Xiaochao in the cafeteria. I think there were separate Xiaochao on the first and second floors of the school‚Äôs third canteen. I had to eat food stalls, the taste is passable, and the advantage is that it is cheap. It cost 100 to take a taxi, and 58 to eat in the cafeteria for three people. Friends laugh at me, but in my heart, that is my youth, youth is priceless!
Sitting on the high-speed train leaving Nanjing, my mood is a bit complicated, because Nanjing is my youth that I can't bear to part with, can't forget, but can't get back. Fortunately, I still have a wife who loves me and a lovely son. With their company, life is sweet! I am lucky to live in a peaceful China, and I can enjoy happy family time with peace of mind. May the country live in peace and prosperity!
Goodbye Nanjing, I will come again!

It was the first hotel in China with a high-rise revolving dining hall, and the first hotel in China equipped with high-speed elevators. Title. This trip to Nanjing specially went to Jinling Hotel to experience check-in. When checking in, Wu Jiayi, the receptionist at the front desk, answered my questions with a smile, and introduced the hotel situation warmly and carefully, making people feel at home. Tired. We stayed in the old building of the hotel. The decoration of the room was a bit outdated, but it was very clean and the facilities in the room were quite good: the American Kingkoil mattress, a faucet, was founded in 1898. It is Hansgrohe, a century-old high-end brand in Germany. Cobigelow is a fine product with a mint fragrance created in the United States in 1838. The toilet is a TOTO series bathroom product created in Japan in 1917. It is a pity. It does not have smart functions. The hotel's breakfast is rich and varied, delicious and delicious. I was deeply impressed by Jinling Hotel's exquisite service and check-in environment.

msg:To be honest, when I took my mother to Nanjing this time, I did some homework on choosing a hotel. After reading the reviews of various five-star hotels, I finally chose Jinling Hotel as the first hotel of this trip. Now I am really glad that I only stayed for one night, otherwise I would really regret it. Because I‚Äôm so disappointed! Online reviews say that the service at Jinling Hotel is good. I felt a little uncomfortable from the moment I checked in. The front desk gave me Building 47. I asked why it was so low. He said that people on other higher floors might have to wait for an hour. After I expressed my willingness to wait, he hesitated and said that there were no other rooms, only this one on the 47th floor. I was actually feeling very uncomfortable at the moment. If the room was full, you could tell me directly, but you shouldn't fool me like this. This is not a joke. Let‚Äôs talk about the room. The style is from 15 years ago, which is not commensurate with the price. Talking about the service, I never saw the room service staff from the beginning to the end, and there was no note at all. It made me feel that I must have not paid enough, so I did not deserve the service I deserved. Let‚Äôs talk about this afternoon tea. It tasted so bad that I felt like vomiting. It was also completely different from the menu I was given before. It was inexplicable. The only positive review was the girl in the breakfast room who offered me Jinling meat buns. It made me feel a little warmer than the Jinling Hotel. Thank you. In short, this hotel is not recommended. At this price, you can choose a hotel with better facilities and services.

This is the renovated Asia Pacific Building, because I often travel on business. The location is superior, surrounded by shopping malls, and the underground passage connects Deji, Xinbai, and IFC Center. It is very convenient for shopping. Other advantages are lackluster. The breakfast variety is quite satisfactory and not too outstanding, but there is one thing that makes people feel The comfortable part is that even if it is time for breakfast to end at ten o'clock, as long as there are guests eating, they will not ignore the food. This point must be praised! The lunch and dinner in Meiyuan on the second floor is usually not clear, but during the Spring Festival, I made an appoin**ent two days in advance and it was said that it was full, so in summary, I do not recommend staying at this hotel!

Staying on the 55th floor of the Asia-Pacific Building, you can see Xuanwu Lake in the distance when the sky is fine, and you can watch the sunrise at the restaurant on the 56th floor for breakfast. The breakfast is good. You can taste the Nanjing snack salted duck, red bean glutinous rice balls, duck blood vermicelli soup, Jinling big buns, and soup dumplings.

msg:During the Spring Festival, I stayed at Jinling Hotel for two days. The first day is the Asia-Pacific Building, and the second day is the Jinling Building. So I ate breakfast at the restaurant on the 56th floor and the breakfast on the first floor of the lobby. The breakfast environment on the 56th floor is good, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery while eating. The breakfast varieties on both sides are basically the same, with little difference. Honey is good and delicious. The disadvantage is that the price of breakfast is 188 yuan/person, which is really not cost-effective. The service quality is very good, adhering to the high standard of Jinling Hotel. The family room gave a little rabbit, and the children liked it very much. When I lived in the Asia-Pacific Building, Liu Xin and Jia Wenjing, two receptionists, gave the children Rabbit üê∞ hair rings during breakfast, and the children liked it very much. Both of them are warm and thoughtful.

msg:In the core area of Nanjing, it is next to Mingwalang Food Street, and is also very close to several scenic spots, such as Confucius Temple, Museum, etc. It is very suitable for travelers who want to experience Nanjing's cultural customs.
Five-star hotel with full service and responsive to requests. During the period, the TV was broken, and the waiter came to me many times and apologized to me. Fortunately, it was repaired ~ the service staff were very enthusiastic and greeted me.
Facilities, the Asia-Pacific building has just opened, the room does not have an old smell, the shower is very flush, the water is big! The night view of the city is really a fortress, it looks transparent and beautiful~ But the lights are turned off around 22:00
I am a swimming and fitness enthusiast, let me talk more about this aspect.
The water temperature of the semi-standard swimming pool is really 28¬∞C. It doesn't feel very cold when it is launched in January, and you can get used to it quickly. The water quality is acceptable, the water temperature is high and easy to muddy, and the visibility is less than 20 meters. The smell of disinfectant is relatively small. I stayed in the hotel a week before the Spring Festival, and there were not many people in the morning and evening.
Let's talk about the gym, there are basically no people. A rowing machine, several treadmills and bicycles. The treadmill looks very thick, and the quality should be good. It is very suitable for aerobic people~the strength area, there are quite a lot of fixed equipment, about 8 sets? There are chest, shoulders, back and abdomen, the weight of the dumbbells is not too big, and the biggest impression is more than 20kg. There is no squat rack, only a Smith rack, a small gantry rack, a compound machine, and high pulldown plus rowing. The overall feeling is more suitable for intermediate fitness people. The boss came here to do the unloading week.
I originally planned to stay here for 2 days, but I didn't expect the gym and swimming pool to be so cool, so I directly canceled the trip to the next hotel and continued for another 2 days. It is really suitable for people who travel with their families and like to exercise.

I still booked the Jinling Hotel with the mentality of "I can't get in... how can I get it...". The feeling of checking in proves that my choice is right, and it has lived up to my expectations!
To say that the facilities and the spaciousness of the rooms are indeed inferior to the high-quality hotels newly built in recent years, but I personally think that it is the soft power that really reflects the quality of the hotel, that is, the service!
The little brother who checked in was very careful and reminded me that the room is relatively close to the elevator, but the room faces south and has a good view. If you don't like the noisy people near the elevator, you can change the room. But the experience of staying is that although it is near the elevator, it is not noisy, and it is very quiet at night! The floor housekeeper, Cai Xiaomin, spoke softly and thoughtfully. Knowing that I wanted to open the window because the room was stuffy, she told me the process of opening the window, and then took tools to help open the window. Take care of her repeatedly, and you can contact her if you have any questions... When checking out, the 2 handsome guys also repeatedly asked about the experience of staying in the hotel. If you are not satisfied, feel free to mention... These details make people really feel the service concept of "customer first", very heartwarming! Next time I go to Nanjing, I will definitely choose Jinling Hotel again!

The service is very good. In addition, Jinling big meat buns and sweet-scented osmanthus rice cakes taste like childhood. There are even hash browns, which are very commendable.

The high-quality service of your shop is very considerate; the room environment is also comfortable, spacious, bright and warm; the room service is also very attentive, preparing fresh fruit plates every day and preparing healthy soup in the evening; Jinling Hotel has more delicacies, in the closest to the moon. Dining in the "Home" restaurant, the beautiful and delicious food makes people linger; the quaint "Meiyuan Restaurant", regardless of the price, my experience is that "only in the unrepeatable region can we achieve unique cuisine". In addition, the "Golden Bay Cafeteria" that covers all tastes, the dishes there are rich, clean and hygienic, the sashimi is very fresh, and it is very delicious üòã. The only regret I didn't taste this time was "Pacific Western Restaurant, I can only look forward to the next time."

As a five-star hotel with a long history in Nanjing, the comprehensive level is indeed excellent. The price before the National Day is not too expensive, so I chose to stay without hesitation.
The surrounding is the core of the business district and the geographical location is very advantageous, which is suitable for business travel. I also met a family from Guangdong to participate in the Junior Golf Tournament.
The staff at the front desk who checked in was very friendly, very efficient and fast, and introduced various services of the hotel.
The details of the decoration style are very in place. Although the hotel is large in size, the flow of people is very simple and it is very convenient to go anywhere. After staying in the fitness facilities for three days, there are not many people, and the water quality of the swimming pool is very clean. The breakfast is ok for this price, don't ask too much.

Secondly, the living environment is acceptable. The decoration of Jinling Building is old but simple and elegant. The interior decoration style is ordinary business room type. There is also a children's room in the family suite, which is very cute and comes with a little tiger for children.
Third, the service is quite good! The network is not very good. Call the front desk and immediately have an engineer to check the situation and test the network speed. Cherry Zhu at the front desk is very kind. When calling the hotline, Miss Wu Nan's service is very professional and in place, and the room housekeeper He Lijuan is very enthusiastic. At breakfast, a handsome little brother also packed fruit, and a very elegant sister helped to make three glasses of freshly squeezed juice and espresso. It's just that the taste is not strong, it would be better to have a double shot or a triple shot.

(1) Five-star service. Particular praise should be given to Ms. Lin at the front desk (in a dark suit, perhaps a supervisor) with a party emblem pinned to it, and Mr. Guo Jing. The service of the two is like a spring breeze, and they also gave us moon cakes to taste, extra points and extra points!
(2) The room facilities are slightly outdated. For example, the shower curtain has a very ancient feeling, which makes people feel that there is a fly in the oin**ent. Hope it can be replaced to be worthy of the name of a five-star hotel.
(3) The buffet breakfast is rich and the service is good. We especially commend the two waiters, Xiaoliang and Xiaotong, who are full of concern for the guests and make people love Golden Bay even more.
Summary: Will stay again and hope to experience a better feeling next time.

Service: This is the best, pays great attention to customer experience, the service staff has a correct attitude and clear positioning, and puts the customer's experience first. When I encountered a problem, I took the initiative to solve it at the first time. I was cared for by the service staff without expressing any dissatisfaction. It was amazing.
Guest room: very modern and bright style, not luxurious, but I think young people should like it. The room cleaning is done by two people, and it is carried out according to the needs of the guests. The most amazing thing is that there is a return visit from the supervisor after cleaning.
Breakfast: There are many Jinling specialties, and even the salted duck in Meiyuan upstairs. And the waiters are very diligent, Xiao Deng is very good, and the service is in place ~ the small wontons in chicken sauce are the taste of when I was a child, and the old duck vermicelli soup is also very authentic.
Location: Turn left and go out to the subway entrance. There are big shopping malls on any side of the road, Deji, Xinbai, Dayang, Aishang Tiandi, and it is very convenient to take a taxi.
Meiyuan: Very user-friendly service, it will be recommended according to the number of people, and a place will be reserved for hotel guests. There are places that are not in place to take the initiative to discount, in fact, I did not propose it at all. It looks like a five star
In short, it was a very, very, very satisfying stay. I plan to stay here in Nanjing in the future~

After about 50 minutes, I learned that the mobile phone was missing, so I went to the public bathroom on the second floor to find it. It was this kind lady Li who comforted the owner after seeing the anxious owner and returned the phone to the owner. In fact, when Ms. Li saw the mobile phone left in the bathroom, she immediately reported it to the supervisor, kept the mobile phone, and waited for the owner to come and claim it. When the loser expressed her gratitude, Ms. Li repeatedly declined.

First of all, the two little brothers at the front desk of the Asia-Pacific Building were very kind to help with the inquiry, upgraded to a twin-bed room, and combined the two orders to handle the procedures together, which reduced the time for us to go through the formalities;
Secondly, the service is very efficient. As soon as we entered the room, the waiter brought fruit to check in;
In addition, the smile is very healing, especially the two beauties Li Hong and Zhang Zhengyan, who are very enthusiastic, have bright smiles, and feel very comfortable.
Overall, it was the most satisfying stay in this Nanjing trip.

I drove out at 12:30 the next day and charged me 26 yuan. , 12 yuan per hour, and secondly, there was no smiling face during the check-in, the attitude was very bad and the tone was very impatient, just like I checked him in, this is something I have never experienced in so many hotels Now international hotels generally check out at 2:00 p.m. and force us to check out at 1:00 p.m. after talking for a long time at 12:00.

The Jinling Building I booked this time is older, but the price is more affordable. Cheng Ying, the floor housekeeper, sent a fruit bowl with a thoughtful message. During breakfast, Lily and Xiao Yin presented the small coconut cakes from the Golden Bay Cake House of the Jinling Hotel, which were very delicate. The experience is very good, and the hotel adds points to the trip to Nanjing.

The room is clean and comfortable, and the view from the window is also very good! The service of Xu Biao on the floor is warm, active, caring, and very good! The boy who delivered the meal, Lantian, was a professional service provider and introduced famous local snacks and attractions in Nanjing.

msg:At the beginning of the article, let's not talk about the environmental hardware, we must first praise the service quality of Jinling Hotel! Praise Zhang Dongyu, the service staff outside the Jinling Tower! ! ! On the first tour of Nanjing, I thought that the taxi would stop when I was called, and after checking out, I went directly to the door with a large and small bag of luggage. The handsome guy Dongyu immediately stepped forward to ask if he had booked a car or needed a taxi. When I learned that I chose to call, I enthusiastically helped to ask whether the taxi would accept the order. During the period, I also paid attention to the service needs of other guests who arrived and left the store. I was busy before and after, but my enthusiasm was not diminished. Later, because I couldn't wait for a taxi for a long time, the online car-hailing driver I ordered was not willing to pick me up at the door when I ordered it, so I had to cancel it. After learning about it, Dongyu used his account to help me book a car... The number of words is limited and I won't go into detail about the rest of the process. As an excellent five-star hotel, hardware facilities are important, but more important is the excellent service quality. I hope the hotel can reward employees like Zhang Dongyu, so as to drive more employees.

Although the price is not particularly high, I didn't expect to be so disappointed. Living in two rooms is not enough.

As an old Nanjing native, Jinling Hotel is a landmark of Nanjing and one of the souls of Nanjing. Now Jinling Hotel has a more upscale and luxurious Asia-Pacific business building, which is really great.
I was only planning to stay for two nights, but it was so comfortable that I added another night.
The room is very large, the sound insulation effect is very good, and the curtains are very shading. It is really friendly to people who can't sleep without sound and light! Turn off the lights with one key, the room is instantly dark during the day, and you fall asleep in a second.
I really like the 25-meter-long swimming pool of Jinling Hotel. The swimming pool is very wide. Although there are children learning to swim, there are not too many people. The gym is also very good and fully equipped. In the gym, I also met a super professional and super professional coach Dong. Coach Dong corrected me a few moves, thank you very much! !
On the day of check-in, there is also fruit sent by the hotel staff Ms. Fay Chen, which is very considerate. The auntie who is responsible for cleaning the hotel every day is also super good, and the hygiene is very clean. Thank you.
Little Li when checking out, Li Wei's little brother is very enthusiastic and professional. In short, from check-in to check-out, the experience is really great, and the front desk service is great. It is indeed an old five-star hotel in Nanjing!
Jinling Hotel's famous big meat buns must be eaten! Delicious cry!
The location of the hotel is first-class. It is Xinjiekou subway station when you go out. You can go to major shopping malls through underground passages. Deji Xinbai Central Golden Eagle is completely free of heat and sunshine in summer. It is very convenient to walk to the scenic spots in minutes. Jinling Hotel is highly recommended! The Chinese do not lie to the Chinese!

The service is good in all aspects, cordial and orthodox, the underground parking lot is also very spacious and convenient, and the hygiene is not bad, but the fly in the oin**ent is a little messy.

msg:For a two-day trip to Nanjing over the weekend, I chose Jinling Hotel for accommodation. It turns out that this is the biggest treasure of this trip. The excellent location ‚ûï low-key and tasteful environment ‚ûï patient and warm service, that is, comfortable and surprising, very comfortable experience. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will still choose Jinling Hotel, heheüòÅ.

üöó Transportation: Take Metro Line 1 to Xinjiekou, exit from Exit 6, and walk for 1 minute, which is very convenient. Nearby are the Xinjiekou business district, Deji Plaza, Golden Eagle Plaza, and Xinbai shopping malls. You can't finish shopping. You can basically reach all the scenic spots within 20 minutes. Perfect location, the best choice for travel.

üßπHygiene: Hygiene is relatively clean, I have a slight habit of cleanliness, but there is no discomfort, the overall is good. The cleaning aunt He Lijuan has a very good service, connecting us to the wireless network and providing a disposable bathtub bag, which is worthy of praise.

üîîService: Jinling's service is what surprised me the most. The young man at the front desk, Wang Yiwei, was very patient and upgraded the room type for us for free. Even if my order was wrong without breakfast, he was not afraid of trouble to modify it for me in the background and changed it to Including breakfast, Nanjing people are really kind and enthusiastic. There is also the Jinling ambassador Cai Yuke, who enthusiastically helped us store our luggage, and left us with a West Point made by Jinling himself.

üçÉEnvironment: The hotel has a free gym, the venue is full of large equipment, and I ate a barbecue the night before, and the next morning the treadmill ‚ûï rowing machine ‚ûï Liu Genghong, no guilt, full of energy to start a new day's journey. Friends who like to swim remember to bring a swimsuit. I forgot to bring it this time. I regret it ‚ûï100000000.
üç≤Diet: A hotel's buffet breakfast is an important criterion for me to measure a hotel. Jinling's buffet breakfast is very, very delicious, rich and with Nanjing characteristics, duck blood vermicelli ‚ûï Jinling big meat bun ‚ûï red bean yuanxiao, Nanjing special food directly at the hotel It‚Äôs time to eat, and there‚Äôs no limit to it. After getting up a little late, I can‚Äôt even eat lunch. Haha, I‚Äôm happy.
üåüFive-star recommendation, difficult to choose‚ûïIf the budget is not tight, you can choose Jinling blindly, you can play well if you live well, the gain is greater than the inves**ent, one word, it is worth!

üîîService: The key point is to praise the service of the old-fashioned hotel. First of all, Miss Harui at the front desk is very considerate in terms of attitude and service quality. It can be said that she can answer any questions and requests. The warm and sunny smile heals every tired traveler. , so that customers always feel the warmth of home. The service of Xiao Jia and Xiao Hu of the restaurant is also very professional and enthusiastic. They even kindly asked me about the experience of staying in the room. After I mentioned that the chair was a little low, I saw a suitable new chair as soon as I entered the room. All of these can reflect that the staff of Jinling Hotel is dedicated to serving, with love and respect for easy word of mouth. Perhaps under the influence of many parties, the life of everyone in the hotel industry in the past two years has not been satisfactory, but I sincerely hope that everyone at Jinling Hotel can pass the cold winter smoothly and safely. Rewarded and praised by your hotel.

After more than 30 years of ups and downs, it still stands shining brightly in the prosperous Xinjiekou, witnessing the rapid development of Nanjing. . This time, thanks to the floor housekeeper Sun Meixia and Li Hong for their careful guidance and warm and attentive service, we stayed in a room with a good view on the 53rd floor. The night and morning views are both great, and the Xinjiekou has a panoramic view. I would also like to thank the handsome Tang Lei at the front desk for solving the parking problem for me. In addition, Jinling's breakfast is nothing to say, you can basically have it, there are many original content, which can represent Nanjing and like it.

I had breakfast in the morning. The old building I lived in should have been eating in the restaurant on the first floor. I called and asked if I could go to the new building to eat. It was done right away. Originally, if my sister was over 1.1 meters, she had to pay half price. During the Chinese New Year, the restaurant manager will Freed directly üòå
There is also Jiao Yanan from the restaurant, Liu Xin, two beautiful women who saw that we brought the baby not only to help with the food, but also gave the baby two gifts. I was really embarrassed to eat and take it again‚ò∫Ô∏è
Although the hotel facilities are a bit old (after all, it was built in 1983 and one year older than me), it should have been renovated but it is still a little old, but the location is absolutely core (the view of Xuan Palace restaurant on the 56th floor is really beautiful, when I was a child, my parents How long did it take to save money to bring me here once, although I can't remember)
The last regret is that Jinling Hotel's big meat buns were not bought during the Chinese New Year holiday (I remember that when I was in school, it was 1 yuan and 2 each, but now it has risen to 6 yuan, but I heard that the price increase is to ensure the quality, which is worthy of praise)

msg:The manager Fiona Lin checked in behind me and gave me food recommendations and transportation suggestions. It helped me a lot after my tour in Nanjing and gave me souvenirs. Staying for so many days took care of me and listened to my feedback. The experience of staying in Jinling these days is very comfortable. The first day of the experience really wanted me to leave the store. I didn‚Äôt see the appearance of an old hotel. Later I saw what Jinling should look like. The Asia Pacific Building or the Jinling Building breakfast restaurant service is very good. The variety of breakfast is also very rich. Meiyuan restaurant must have a try. The service or the quality of the meals are good and delicious. Next time I come to Nanjing, I will choose here for convenient travel and high cost-effective location.

üßπSanitation: There is no need to say more about the hygiene of a star-rated hotel, the room carpet is clean, no musty smell, simple and comfortable
üçÉEnvironment: There are major depar**ent stores around the hotel, the hotel does not need to go out, there is a channel to travel directly from the underground, even if it rains, you will not get your shoes wet
üîîService: The key point is that the old Jinling Hotel is most famous for its excellent service attitude. I arrived at noon, but the warm-hearted Miss Peng Yinqian called me to confirm the itinerary overnight. I can check in when I arrive. Wait, when I arrived, Miss Yang Yuhang helped me check in, and she kindly told me that the first round of mini bar was free, and told me the time and location of breakfast. In addition, I like swimming and told me that the fourth floor is very beautiful. You can have a look at the swimming pool. After I got to the room, Sister Liu Ming helped me prepare the fruit again. Because I was going to go out to the hot spring in the afternoon, I took the apples and pears and ate them when I was going to soak in the hot spring. This sister actually helped me make up two more apples. My expression at that time can be used as an expression bag. It feels like I found 10 yuan while walking on the road. My happiness increased, and I woke up at 8 o'clock the next day. Eating the most complete and delicious buffet breakfast in the legend, it may be a little exaggerated when a friend introduced it, but my personal feeling is actually okay. After all, morning tea is still good in Guangdong, but what surprised me was that there was a super-fit little brother who asked What do I drink, he said there is soy milk coffee and milk, I said coffee, drink it in the morning to refresh the mind, but it is actually a cup of coffee with flowers, you know that I am a person who likes traveling, I can only say I have been to a lot of places, but generally I will not help you pull flowers. I also order coffee, but these little details are enough to make people feel bright and happy all day. What is even more surprising is that we At the end of the meal, this little brother also gave us a cake to take away. At this time, I don't know what language to use to praise, but I'm sorry, I forgot the name of the little brother üò≠... but not Affecting my good impression of Jinling, it directly led to the original itinerary to check out at noon on the same day. As a result, I went back in the afternoon to book another night, and then stayed there. I also felt that I was capricious, but I am happy, I am willing, I am not one. People who like to write reviews, because I am lazy, but this time I want to write because it is really worth recommending, whoever lives knows

msg:Jinling Hotel is located in the city center, opposite Deji Square. It is very convenient to eat and buy nearby. As a Nanjing native who has been working hard all year round, Jinling Hotel has always been the first choice for us to visit our parents in Nanjing.

The service of Jinling Hotel is generally very good. The front-line staff such as the front desk and the concierge are not only good-looking, but also very polite, courteous and well-trained. The training is not inferior to other international chain hotels.

This check-in is a little bit of an episode. Because we came from Jing'an District in Shanghai, we stayed for two nights. When we checked in, my husband and I went there. My daughter stayed at her parents' house. At that time, there was a beautiful lady at the front desk Checked and photographed our itinerary code, health code, and nucleic acid test report, and told us that when our daughter came in the evening, we should also go to the front desk to do face recognition and register. When we returned to the hotel in the evening, we honestly took our daughter to register. Who would have thought that the young man who received us was very "serious". He must have asked us to submit a nucleic acid test report on the day we left... and also left a message for handover... We are very inexplicable and are about to leave. Why do we still need to provide test reports? It is not particularly reasonable, and it does not help the epidemic control.

Fortunately, the little brother who checked out could understand our situation and checked out for us without too much trouble. Overall, it was a pleasant check-in experience.

Thank you for him and her, thank you Jinling Hotel, which left us a very good impression and come back next time!

msg:We went to Nanjing mainly to see the maple leaves in Qixia Mountain. The hotel choice is between Jinling and Shangri-La. Considering that Jinling is an old state guesthouse, we booked a room for one night first. We were received by a male waiter. Can we be promoted? He said to take a look, and then said he was promoted. When showing the health code, the network was not working well, and it took a long time. One of the waitresses who received us was very nice and sent us to the room. When I saw that the room was so small, I said there was no upgrade. The feeling was that the floor was upgraded. Although there are defects in the objective conditions of the old hotel, the hotel has taken pains to give the guests experience from the software. For example, the fruit is placed in the elevator court to take it at any time. The shampoo and shower gel are the brand of L‚ÄôOccitane. In addition, each waiter‚Äôs The attitude is very good, the breakfast is relatively rich, the restaurant is also good with a view by the window, if it is hot, you can eat under the open-air pergola. The general feeling is that the rooms are small and it is hard to imagine that it is a five-star hotel, and there is no open space in the lobby, but the service is still very goodüëç. Built in a small room, I decisively booked the Shangri-La for the next day, more than 100 years old, cost-effective.

3. Dealing with complaints, checking the problem, contacted five waves of people, knocked on the door 4 times, the efficiency of handling the problem needs to be improved, the front desk service catering service is still relatively reliable, the breakfast staff is more, the space is more crowded, and the seats can only be seated;
4. Because I live in the old building, the room is relatively old, the soundproofing is average, and it is understandable that it is relatively small, and the corners are more moldy. The room does not have a reasonable place to put the used bath towels. It is recommended to put a recycling box. The countertop is small and it takes up space. If you put it in the bathtub, you can't take a bath.

The underground garage is in the Asia-Pacific building. It is also convenient to walk to the Jinling building with a suitcase. The service attitude is nothing to say. If there is any problem, I will communicate with the guests in advance. This is why I chose Jinling when I went to Nanjing. There are many types of breakfast, and the choice is wide. It is said that the family room is a newly launched room type in Jinling, currently only for families with children. It is hoped that the hotel will gradually introduce adult family rooms, and the bed type and breakfast can also be matched with it. Looking forward to staying next time!

We traveled with my sister and booked a parent-child suite. One day in advance, a gentle-speaking young lady called us and asked about her preferences, and came to decorate the children‚Äôs room. Her attitude was very good. The gentle and gentle lady fell in love with her, and asked about her name, Wei Hai. Qiu.

After arriving at the hotel, after entering the gate, a beautiful sister named Zhang Chufan came to greet us and asked about our needs. After learning that we had booked a room, she took us to the front desk. When we arrived at the front desk, a handsome young man named Zhang Yan enthusiastically checked in and introduced us to the hotel‚Äôs environment and facilities. After that, sister Wei Haiqiu, who called us yesterday, took us all the way to the room and gave us some answers. Question, very professional.

After arriving in the room, my sister liked it very much. The facilities in the children‚Äôs room were very good. There were so many small toys, as well as fairy tale books and sharp turns of the brain. We started to guess in the afternoon. The cutest thing is the toilet. No children would not like it. Bar! There is also a refrigerator in the room. Drinks and mineral water are also provided in the refrigerator for free, great. The hotel occupancy price is really good for this kind of facilities and services.

After playing for a while, Aunt He Lijuan who delivered fruits saw our two rooms and told us to give another one to my sister‚Äôs children‚Äôs room, and told us that if we need anything, we can just call directly. Later, when we check out, it‚Äôs a little thing. , I couldn't check out in time. After contacting Miss Wei Haiqiu, she expressed that she understood very much and immediately helped me to communicate with the front desk to apply, without directly rejecting her resignation.

From before check-in to after check-in, every detail and every staff is very good. I also think that I often go out to play in many hotels. This time it is amazing to me. It is worthy of being the number one old-fashioned hotel in Nanjing.

msg:Very kind hotel. Check out in the afternoon, the high-speed rail has just arrived home, take advantage of the fresh memory to talk about feelings. Ctrip booked a special room. It was only after 11 o‚Äôclock when I arrived at the store. It was not ci time. The brother at the front desk warmly received and told me that the room was ready. I tried to ask if I could change to a twin room. My brother said it‚Äôs no problem. , After inquiring, I said that the twin room has not been cleaned. I have to wait a while and then ask me if I would like to upgrade to an executive deluxe room for free. Although it is a single bed, it is 2 meters wide and the decoration is better than the basic room type. As a person who often mixes with flying guests to study seriously, I certainly know that upgrades are generally only for senior members, and reservations must be made through official channels. Third-party platform bookings are basically not upgraded. This kind of unexpected joy unexpectedly made me meet, and I should consider I bought a lottery ticket. The younger brother learned that the high-speed train was 4pm the next day, and helped me delay the check-out time from 12pm to 2pm. When I booked a room with Ctrip, I knew that I had no membership rights, and I did not enjoy the benefits of membership SNP, upgrades, free breakfast, early check-in, and late check-out. After checking in, I secretly took pictures of the young man's badge before leaving. It turned out that this quiet and honest young man was called Ma Chen. From the beggar room to the executive deluxe room, the bathroom accessories have also become Hilton‚Äôs usual L‚ÄôOccitane. I stayed happily in the hotel for two days, because I was too familiar with Nanjing. This time it was because the epidemic stayed at home for too long and came out to breathe, so I didn‚Äôt visit the scenic spots. I just ate, slept in the hotel and went to the Golden Eagle Central during the day. , After dinner, go to Deji for a walk. Jinling buffet is highly recommended. When you come to Nanjing, don‚Äôt find snacks on the streets and alleys, and don‚Äôt go to those online celebrity shops to check in. Duck blood vermicelli, marinated dry, tofu brain, jelly, salted duck, roast duck, Jinling has the most authentic and cleanest. It's a pity that I didn't eat the steamed meatballs and pepper meat this time. It's a pity. Oh, by the way, at noon, I cheered on the guest room hotline and asked if I could postpone it for a while. The girl who answered the phone asked me what time I needed, and I said three o‚Äôclock would work? The little girl said it‚Äôs okay, you rest assured that you have a lunch break. When I left, the waiter happened to pass by and greeted me enthusiastically, asking if I wanted to take a bottle of water for me to drink on the high-speed rail. I said there were 3 bottles in the room, and there was just one bottle left, so I took it with me. When checking out, the little girl at the front desk asked me how I was staying. I said that I was very happy and the experience was beyond expectation. The response of the little girl reminded me of the hostess of the cabin where I traveled to Switzerland a few years ago. She wakes up every morning. Asked me how I slept and whether the breakfast was delicious, I got a positive answer and immediately danced. It is the joy of the heart that the labor and service are recognized. I casually thanked the little girl from the guest room hotline, Xiao Lu checked and said that she was called Huang Fang. The reason why I write so much is because it is a very happy living experience, and also because these hard-working, enthusiastic and kind ordinary children make me feel cordial. Finally, I would like to give you some suggestions: If the budget is sufficient, go directly to the Ritz-Carlton. For ordinary people, especially family outings, I recommend Jinling. The price of Jinling has become more and more affordable in the past two years. It is located at Xinjiekou, the center of Nanjing, the center of the universe. The center of the city is the subway. It‚Äôs convenient to go everywhere, the service is standard, and the food is delicious. If you think Jinling Tower is old, you can add a little money to live in the Asia-Pacific Tower. I am used to living in Jinling Tower, which is cheaper and closer to the subway entrance. Finally, thank you for the lovely young man and girl in Jinling. It is your contribution that made me happy and warm this weekend. Lined up with a group of old ladies in Nanjing, and went home with a big bag of big meat buns from Jinling Hotel, and was laughed to death by the family.

The welcome fruits and various services are really in place after check-in. The best thing is breakfast, because we like to experience breakfast in various hotels. The design of the restaurant should be praised, sitting by the window, so that everyone feels comfortable on vacation in Thailand or Sanya. The breakfast is also very good. Eating, whether it is the characteristics of Nanjing or Western-style Japanese-style is worthy of praise!

They all felt very comfortable. The location of the hotel is excellent, the environment is tall, the layout of the room is reasonable, the lighting is warm, and the facilities are more user-friendly. The bathroom is currently the most satisfactory in a 5-star hotel. In addition, whether it is double electric curtains or full-length mirrors, including L‚ÄôOccitane wash The care products, refined small wooden combs, sewing kits, etc., all the subtleties demonstrate the hotel's thoughtfulness. On the first day of staying in the Asia-Pacific Twin Room, I opened the door and saw the fresh fruits on the table. A homely feeling came into being. Free drinks and snacks were also provided in the refrigerator, and guests were also provided in the corridors to pick them up. Apple. The hotel management is in place and the service is heartwarming. I think it can be summarized in 8 words: proactive service and responsiveness! Thank you very much for the handsome guy Huo Bin, the senior receptionist at the front desk who helped us upgrade our room for free, and also thank Aunt Sun Meixia who sent us fruit and disinfectant masks, and the restaurant manager who helped us reduce and exempt the baby‚Äôs breakfast fee.

Let‚Äôs start with the service attitude (software). Very good. Xiaolu who took me to change rooms in the Asia-Pacific Building, her male colleague helped me upgrade the room, and the manager who handled the noise for me on the 14th, and the second floor. Han Tingting of Meiyuan and another sister (in charge of the inner area, go straight in, turn right, then right, go straight, the innermost area, my memory can only be remembered here), there are a lot of me Did not remember the name. (Only the doorman is not very good, but Nanjing is too hot, and he works outdoors, so he can understand a little bit) But the hardware is very unsatisfactory, whether it is a noise problem or an aging problem. I really should complain about the noise earlier, because I didn't have the energy to pay attention to it a few days ago. I think the decoration of the Asia-Pacific Building is too dark. This is what my family said, but the problem with the Jinling Building is significant. The advantage of the hardware is that the bedding is very good, and the toiletries are also very good. The feeling of overlooking the traffic in the center of Nanjing is very beautiful. In contrast, I prefer room 2412. If I come to Nanjing again in the future and still live here, I would prefer this room. I have had a wonderful experience in these days in Nanjing. (The first few pictures are 2402, which should be an executive suite, the middle pictures are 2412, and the penultimate picture is 4519 of the Asia-Pacific Building). The staff here helped the hotel get a full five-star praise. This evaluation is mainly to praise them.

msg:The location is very good, the subway is convenient, and several attractions are not far away by taxi. The rooms are quite satisfactory, the equipment is average, and the night view is beautiful at night.

There are many Chinese-style breakfasts. The girl in the noodle soup wonton stall doesn‚Äôt remember anyone. The fan soup was taken away by others and asked me if it wasn‚Äôt wonton. I had to wait again. You can consider issuing a number plate. Western-style types don‚Äôt count. many.

msg:A veteran five-star hotel, opened in 1983 and renovated in 2020, it is still very comfortable to live in. Jinling Hotel is located in Xinjiekou, with an excellent location. It was once the tallest building in China, a landmark in Nanjing, and the first luxury five-star hotel in Jiangsu Province. Presumably most Nanjing people have feelings for it. .
Thank you very much, Miss Xu Mansi at the front desk! ! I originally booked the classic deluxe room in Jinling Building. This room type is up to the 21st floor. I told the lady at the front desk that please try to give me a higher room type, so I upgraded to the executive floor, the area is still the same as before, super happy! !
The breakfast on the first floor is very hearty. The red noodle soup with toppings is especially delicious. There is a lot of duck head meat in brine, which is worth a try!

msg:Taking my son and wife to Nanjing for a trip, the first choice is Jinling Hotel. The front desk has a very good attitude and the rooms are clean. I would like to pay special tribute to the waiter Sun Meixia on the 42nd floor. He brought us fruits as soon as he entered the room. When I saw that we had children, I also brought children toiletries and drinks. Next time I come to Ningxia, I will choose Jinling Hotel.

msg:Bring children to play, the room has been upgraded (although the area is not large), the location of the hotel is so convenient, no matter which scenic spot you go to, it will not take more than half an hour by car. The entrance of the hotel is the subway station, and the subway travel is also very convenient. Although there was a queue on the first day of breakfast, after entering the restaurant, the dining experience was very good, it was very convenient to pick up the meal, there was no queue for food, and there was no empty plate. The dishes are also relatively rich, taking into account the tastes of the north and the south, especially the restaurant staff Zhu Heliang, the service is very enthusiastic, attentive, and laughed all the time. It made our family feel very good. I want to write a letter of praise, but time is too late. I hope the hotel leaders can see it. The front desk and room service are also very good, adding extra beds to the children in a timely manner, and a few more bottles of drinking water. All in all, it was a very good experience. I will choose it next time and recommend it to my friends. In addition, Yin Qian and Li Wei at the front desk have good service.

msg:I placed an order online before and I placed an order at the wrong time. After I arrived at the store, when the front desk checked in, the front desk said to verify the order and also asked me to find her the cancelled order. Then I didn‚Äôt know what to do. At that time, the weather was still hot and my parents stood there with luggage at the front desk for nearly half an hour. We didn‚Äôt say anything. After the front desk said the room was not on the same floor, would it be acceptable? My father said as far as possible at the front desk on the same floor. The rooms are all based on the floor because the waiting time was long. My father was a little angry and said, why do you still ask this. The front desk has a bad attitude and said we need to ask. Then my father said that he couldn‚Äôt change it. Why can't you hurry up and wait for such a long time, the front desk attitude is very bad, and what are you talking about? Then she asked another front desk to handle it. She left, it was already very hot, and the mood was very irritable and irritable. After being extremely bad, I changed to a front desk and the work efficiency was very good. After arriving in the room, the customer service called me and said that the front desk responded that my room had breakfast for two, but I clearly ordered breakfast for one person! ! Make me irritated even more! ! This is the front desk service of your five-star Jinling Hotel? ? Work efficiency? ? This is five stars? ? There was a large piece of water stains in the luggage rack beside the TV in the room. After the water stains were like damp, when I checked out, I told the front desk that the front desk gave cookies as a gift. The location of the five-star hotel is good. The girl at the front desk should also remember her job number at the time. Other front desk service attitudes are pretty good, but her work efficiency and service attitude are really bad! These are the truth, no additives are pure and natural, and established companies are disappointing.

The service is thoughtful and warm, especially Miss Huang Ada in the executive lounge is very sincere. If you go to Nanjing next time, Jinling Hotel will definitely be your first choice.
