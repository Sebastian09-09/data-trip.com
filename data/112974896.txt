msg:Location of the hotel is not in the city centre.  There are not much restaurants around.  It’s good for vacation and the lake view is fantastic.  The reception staffs are friendly and helpful.  Thanks for them for upgrading our hotel rooms plus granting us breakfast discount.  Breakfast is good.  Room is spacious and comfortable.  Blankets and pillows are cosy.  One room has flushing problem while the door locks aren’t in order in another room, nevertheless these problems were fixed in a timely manner.  Although parking is free, however it’s not so convenient as we need to go to the reception for registration before using the car.

msg:Check-in:
After entering the hotel lobby, check in. The service at the hotel front desk is very good. The front desk lady has a sweet smile and a warm attitude, which gives people a sense of intimacy. We feel very warm and comfortable. The front desk staff is very professional, and the service of handling problems and responding is fast and efficient.
Breakfast: It should be mentioned that the variety is not rich enough. The restaurant can be seen through the lobby. There was a little episode during breakfast, but it also allowed us to experience a very outstanding waiter. The breakfast guy Chen Pengyu served very enthusiastically, clean and generous. He always kept a smile after two or three troubles, and he was praised.
Guest room:
The aunt on the floor was polite, and the room was relatively new and very clean; but the hygiene really needs to be paid more attention.
Geographical location:
First of all, the transportation is convenient. There are government agencies nearby. The hotel is adjacent to Yanshan Lake. You can relax and exercise near the hotel. The construction opposite the hotel lobby affects the appearance.
Summary: convenient transportation, good environment, especially the warm service in the lobby. The price-performance ratio is satisfactory. There is no problem taking pictures in the outdoor swimming pool when the weather is good. Remember to prepare a swimsuit and a swimming cap. If you are on a business trip, there is no problem going straight to this hotel.

msg:It was originally Phoenix City. I don't know when it changed its name. I'll try it this time.
1. The order note is quiet, and the twin room (double number) faces the fan of other people's restaurant. The window cannot be opened. I left early and came back late the first two days and didn't notice it. If you don't bring earplugs, it is recommended not to stay.
2. The wash basin is easy to be blocked. The soap and lotion will not be replenished if they are not used up. The main focus is thrift, but the toothbrush is replenished. It's a bit confusing.
3. The people at the breakfast noodle stall use Mandarin, Cantonese and Yangjiang dialect, but there are still obstacles in communication. They either can't remember or are slow. I didn't eat the pig intestine roll for several days, and the replenishment was slow enough.
4. The front desk guy is okay. There is a small park next to the downstairs. The robot delivery can wait for 30-40 minutes at night. It's ** that you have to wait for this time after it is delivered upstairs.

I rented two rooms. The front desk was very friendly and knew that we had children traveling together. They bought a brand new BB bed set for our children. We have arranged a river view room together with the other rooms. The room is super clean and the bed is super comfortable. Our family felt very comfortable during this trip and felt at home. In addition, a free-flow beer package was given to us. If we don’t particularly want to eat out, this meal is actually quite filling. The breakfast is very sincere and delicious! In addition, the facilities in the gym are new and complete. A hotel that is really worth recommending

Sure enough, it was surrounded by lakes, mountains, and forest parks. It was a touch of freshness in the bad air of Yangjiang! Alex at the front desk is very nice, considerate and has strong working ability. I would like to commend him! The room was newly renovated last year and was renovated from the Country Garden Hotel, giving it a second spring! The room is larger, and the lake view from the balcony is particularly pleasant. The automatic sensor curtains and hardware are very good. The disadvantage of the balcony is that there is no drying facility. Drink beer and play billiards in the lobby bar, which is very comfortable. The breakfast is quite rich!

msg:I booked to check in at the hotel on February 15th. Due to the traffic jam on the highway, I arrived at the hotel at around 2:30 am on February 16th. I had sent messages to the hotel twice on the way to inform the estimated arrival time, and according to the hotel order requirements, the room charges for two rooms had been deducted at 18:00 on the evening of February 15th. Unexpectedly, after we arrived at the hotel, the hotel front desk receptionist actually said that only one room was available for check-in, and the other rooms were dirty rooms that had not been cleaned. I was stunned at the time. As a Sheraton, such a thing would happen! And the attitude of the front desk staff was not good at the time. They tapped the mouse impatiently, but they couldn't find a room to check in. Later, I asked the supervisor to come forward. The front desk called the supervisor. The supervisor said that they couldn't clean up the rooms here during the Spring Festival (isn't it funny), and then the supervisor and the front desk had a phone call, and finally tossed out a room that could be checked in. The time was already more than 3 o'clock in the morning. We had to leave at more than 6 o'clock in the morning, and we didn't sleep for a few hours in total.
When I checked out the next day, I asked the hotel to give me a clear explanation on this issue. I suspected that the hotel sold my room without my permission. However, it has been nearly half a month until today, and the hotel has not given any information.
My room was booked on January 28th, and they didn't reserve a room for me when I didn't violate any contract. This is the bottom line that any hotel cannot touch, let alone a five-star hotel like Sheraton. Sheraton, I am so disappointed...

msg:Disadvantages:
1. The service can be said to be non-existent. If you come by car, there are several parking spaces at the door, but the security guard won't let you park, saying that you can only park at the door to eat. The parking lot of the hotel is outside, it takes about two minutes to walk in. Then we two girls unloaded the suitcases by ourselves at the door because there was no one at the door.
2. The hotel construction is poor. The decoration style of the room is quite good, but to be honest, the construction level and details are very poor, the walls are not evenly painted, and the wallpaper has been lifted and glued (picture 1 shows that the wallpaper has been seriously cracked)
3. Hygiene is extremely poor! ! ! There was soot on the balcony, and there was also ash on the floor. I don’t know what was used to mop the toilet, and there were very dirty marks (you can see the picture). It can be said that it is the worst hygiene and cleanliness I have stayed in in the past few days.
4. There is also the option of ordering takeout. The hotel has already opened in mid-November. After the takeaway boy delivered it to the front desk of the hotel, the front desk told us that the takeout delivery robot had not been set up yet, so we had to go to the front desk to get it ourselves. This is a problem caused by the hotel itself, but the guests are left to bear the consequences. (Although the front desk only brought it up after our strong request)
The only two🌟
1. Jerry’s service at the hotel’s dinner was very good.
2. The front desk helped upgrade the lake view room. The scenery is quite comfortable.
Summarize:
Not worth it, far worse than another five-star hotel in Yangjiang in all aspects

除了門口接待處, 其他部門包括餐廳, 酒吧的員工都不懂英文, 我的客戶都溝通不到, 要我來翻譯.  作為是喜來登其下酒店, 個人覺得比較失望, 完全不到水平。
還有, 酒吧餐牌上的酒, 好多都沒了, 我客戶選了幾款都沒有, 心情不好, 連青島啤酒都沒有.... 最後隨便喝了阳江本地啤酒就回房間.
食品質素方面, 酒吧和泰國餐廳都不錯的。
房間方面, 還算是不錯, 挺大的。  但是房間是沒有辦工枱的, 只有一張圓形枱在沙發那方, 好矮的不適合工作, 如果是工作出差住的, 工作就不方便。

衹是前台有些細節位需要加強：
1.不確定前台培訓時是否要求要和客户説明退房時間，和自己訂套餐裏包含什麼內容，可以去哪裡使用，這些在check in時並未告知。需要自己打電話去確認😂，最後還要自己下樓找大堂餐吧確認是否能使用。
2.萬豪會員如果通過第三方訂房無法享受會員服務，但並未告知原因（並不是所有會員都清楚會員規矩改了），最後是自己搜尋瞭解才知道😂。

酒店人員確實不足，所以在服務上可能並未過於及時，不過這家就是four points確實不能拿萬豪其他品牌對比。

不過住宿硬件真的不錯，分衹是給客房服務和房間硬件。

首先，我要特別提到酒店的前台reya。她非常熱情友好，幫我升級了房型，讓我感到非常驚喜和舒適。她的專業和熱情讓我在入住時就感到賓至如歸。

我在這裏入住的房間非常寬敞，有一個很大的陽台，採光極好。房間的裝修風格現代，設施齊全。無論是床鋪的舒適度還是浴室的設施，都讓我感到非常滿意。每天晚上，我都在一個安靜舒適的氛圍中入睡，讓我感到非常放鬆和舒適。

此外，酒店的位置也非常便利。它位於市中心，周圍有很多餐廳和購物中心。我可以在附近輕鬆地找到我喜歡吃的食物和購物的地方。

總的來説，我在陽江福朋喜來登酒店的住宿體驗非常愉快。這裏的環境舒適，服務周到，是一個理想的住宿選擇。我強烈推薦這家酒店給其他旅行者，我相信你們也會在這裏度過一個愉快的時光。
