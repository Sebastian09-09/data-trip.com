msg:We spent two days doing the er-hai lake tour. First day the east side, second day west side. And this is the accommodation we choose to stay at shuanglang area. Very convenient location - walkable to all shopping area in shuanglang. We got the family room for 4 pax and we had a very comfortable stay. If there‚Äôs a gym, it will be perfect. Enjoying complementary high tea in the room was awesome. But breakfast was chaotic, I couldn‚Äôt find a clean table to sit. They ran out of utensils. And all the staff were busy doing their own things to even notice these. Perfect your operations esp on how breakfast manpower is being allocated and this hotel will be perfect. Also, we got stopped three times from entering the hotel because outsiders are not allowed. They were polite, but nonetheless a very districting experience. Trying to personalise your experience with an assigned butler and all, but the constant reminder that you don‚Äôt actually belong here. They don‚Äôt even remember your face. üòÜ

All in all, stay here if you have a night in shuanglang. Convenient location, comfortable room, awesome view, nice high tea, free service to bring luggage from carpark to hotel.

However, most of the hotels are separated by a road and there are basically no water-friendly rooms. Only the hotels in Shuanglang are all by the Erhai Lake. Only the hotels in Shuanglang can watch the sunset over Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake. As long as the weather is clear, you can see the Tyndall effect every day.

The day before check-in, the front desk customer service contacted and sent the parking spot location in advance.

Welcome fruits and exquisite and delicious afternoon tea were sent upon check-in, which was simply great. The fruit sent by the store was not stingy at all, and it was a full portion, all seasonal fruits. The breakfast was delicious, with local specialty rice noodles, etc., with a semi-self-service counter, and the taste was not bad. Speaking of the scenery, the homestay is facing Erhai Lake, and it is a house built on the edge of Erhai Lake. Whether in the room or in the public area, you can blow the wind of Erhai Lake and see Cangshan and Erhai Lake. It's amazing. I also praise the photography sent by the store. The photographer is a beautiful girl, Taozi, who is very patient in taking pictures and has good skills. The whole family is very satisfied.

On facilities: old, except for the small terrace with "sea view".
On service: Ah Qi's housekeeper service is good.
On price performance: the room is small, and the decoration details are really average.
On breakfast: really needs to be improved. (The vegetables in the salad are not fresh)
On environment: the view of Erhai Lake is not picky
On afternoon tea: not bad
On experience: Overall, if the full score is 10, it can only be rated 5.0. The room price of nearly 900 is really not low in Dali, and combined with the above shortcomings, I really can't agree. (I sincerely hope that you can improve and optimize in the future.)

I really like their decoration style, which is pure white. The front desk staff and butler Xiaobo are all very nice. Polite and good service. The breakfast is generally quite rich.

The service is also very good
One-on-one butler service, always online and timely feedback to solve problems
This time Aqi was our butler and was very considerate throughout the entire process.
Come to Dali next time during the off-season
Or choose this hotel to lie down
There is no need to go around the island...

msg:Years ago, I finally came to Dali, which I had longed for. This is a B&B in Shuanglang Ancient Town, close to the Erhai Lake. You can look at the incomparable sea view in the room every day and have afternoon tea. Everything is just right. Comfortable. The store is run by a bunch of enthusiastic young people. The room is very clean and the service is very attentive. The breakfast and afternoon tea are good. It mainly faces the sea. All kinds of things are pleasing to the eye. Our butler, Mr. Zhang, is particularly good. He has good service and responds to all requests. This time I took my children out to play. They also liked it very much and had a great time. I will choose to stay here again when I come to Dali in the future!

msg:The rooms, common areas, and services of the B&B are all very good. It's also quieter, which is really important. The service is just right. It not only serves you at any time, but also gives you enough space to enjoy without the pressure of being rushed. After staying for two days, the children were reluctant to leave. Special thanks to our housekeeper, Mr. Zhang, for taking care of us these two days. It was a trip that the whole family was very satisfied with. We will come back next time

msg:The most satisfying B&B I have ever stayed in, bar none. The environment is great. It is directly on the Erhai Lake and you can see the sunset and sunrise. Watching the sunset from their home is so beautiful! The lobby is very beautifully decorated, and they also provide free photography, which is super photogenic. The hotel‚Äôs lunch and breakfast are really exquisite~
Butler Xiaorao also helped us upgrade for free, and provided late cleaning and sweet soup in the evening. The restaurants recommended by the butler were also very delicious.
There was also a souvenir upon leaving the store! Highly recommended B&B

In the evening, there are also fruits and flower cakes given as souvenirs. The room type booked does not have a balcony, but there is a large window facing Erhai Lake. Super comfortable!

msg:I have been to Dali several times. Every time I choose a hotel or B&B, I spend a lot of time. This trip, I did not make the wrong choice. I was very satisfied with my stay. From the room settings, equipment, sanitation, to the scenery, and the service, everything can be said It is a double gallery ceiling level. Special praise to our housekeeper, Mr. Zhang, who will help with any needs during the stay. Originally booked for one night, we decided to stay for one night at short notice. If you stay at a B&B, you can enjoy the beautiful Erhai Lake from your room. The public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is also close to the Erhai Lake. You can also see the beautiful sunset and feed the seagulls in the public area. Free fruits, afternoon tea, and good night desserts are provided upon check-in. Worth staying again.

The hotel service is warm and welcoming, and the afternoon tea desserts are very delicious. I would especially like to praise the housekeeper Aqi, who was very active before and after the run and met all the requirements. Of course, other staff members are also very honest, kind and conscientious in their work. In addition, the hotel provides free afternoon tea, evening desserts, and free drinks in the refrigerator.
