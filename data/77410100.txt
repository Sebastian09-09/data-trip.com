msg:A perfect stay. I stayed here on June 1st. Philip at the front desk provided very good service. He carefully explained the park's special play areas and hotel facilities, gave the children a snack package, and was very caring during my stay.

The Garden Expo Park in summer is very beautiful and full of vitality. It looks very beautiful.

The room is spacious, well-designed and well-laid out, with good privacy. I really like the large French windows in the room.

In general, the price-performance ratio is very high and I am very satisfied. If I have the opportunity, I will stay here again.

msg:To be honest, a short-distance job that happened by accident allowed me to work in such a beautiful mountain for two days. I upgraded the room type of 2k+ for free to an independent private hot spring near the bamboo forest. The morning of the activity package was beautiful near the mountain. The lunch was also a good value for money with the configuration of a five-star hotel. The Hanfu experience was also very good and the photographer loved it. The scenery is amazing and it is also very convenient to go to other hotels. I checked in for the afternoon tea at Banyan Tree on the cliff in the mountain. I went to Huachu for a 588 dinner. It was delicious and I would go there again after having eaten in a popular restaurant. The white flower sea in the Garden Expo Park, the Reading Bookstore, the Coca-Cola factory, and the beautiful light buildings in the mountains at night are really refreshing. The hotel's swimming pool and Westin are both very clean. The free public hot spring is a cave that is very filmy and unique. At this price, you can experience so many projects. I love it. The itinerary in the mountains for two days is full. The air is very good and the mood for work is pleasant. There is a timetable for each bus, of course, the time is very punctual. If you want to take it, you must wait in advance on time. A very happy stay experience üëçSuper value 10 points

msg:I haven't been to the Garden Expo Park for a long time. I took advantage of Children's Day to relax. I stayed in the King Room of Ning Pavilion and Han Pavilion before. This time I booked the Candy Flying House Family Room. The children were very happy. I slept alone for one night. Overall, I felt that the family attribute was not as good as the Westin next door. The breakfast was semi-buffet, and the variety was not much, but the taste was online. The child fell asleep after playing at around 11 o'clock in the afternoon. I called to inquire whether I could delay the check-out to 2 o'clock. The feedback was that the rooms were all booked and there was no way to delay. However, Ctrip showed that there were still several rooms. I don't know why

msg:The overall environment is really good. The design of the hotel is also very exquisite. It is indeed full of industrial style. The service staff is very enthusiastic, the breakfast is great, and the hot spring is also very comfortable. The only thing that surprised me a little is that after staying in so many hotels, there is still a deposit, and I have already paid the room fee in advance. The check-out time cannot be delayed by a minute. After 12 o'clock, the room card will be invalid. You need to go to the front desk to re-apply before returning to the room to get your luggage. The key is that this is not the peak season. Many big-name hotels are very humane in this regard. In the peak season, they will take the initiative to call guests to check out. Some suggestions based on personal experience, I hope that hotels can be more humane.

The service was very attentive. From check-in reception to dining in the restaurant, every environment made us feel at home. Especially the brother Philip who received us that night. The service was very considerate. It was already past 23 o'clock when we arrived at the hotel due to the late flight.

Unlike some hotels that are just superficial, good-looking but not delicious, Junmao‚Äôs afternoon tea is both exquisite and delicious~ Breakfast is also delicious! After staying in so many five-star hotels, Junmao has the most beautiful breakfast presentation and is one of the best in quality! The service is also very good, everyone will greet you and are very enthusiastic! I was given welcome fruits and a very exquisite souvenir before leaving. The quality of the items inside was also very good. In short, Junmao is a hotel that attaches great importance to quality and service. It was a worthwhile trip and I had a pleasant weekend. !

msg:Two days before the trip, there was a change, so I called the hotel. The hotel said that the parent-child room was outsourced to Ctrip and they didn't care. Then I contacted Ctrip, and Ctrip said they would discuss it with the hotel, and finally told the hotel that they couldn't refund. Then I changed the date, and they said they couldn't change it. What a ** hotel, with overbearing terms, no refund or change. In the end, Ctrip said they would refund me more than 100 to compensate me.
I went to stay there with my head held high, and the bathtub didn't come with shower gel and shampoo, and I was told that it was the hotel's environmental policy. It's okay that the parent-child room didn't have children's shower gel, but even the toiletries in the shower room were locked. What kind of advanced formula is it that they are afraid of being stolen? ? There is no hotel shuttle bus for travel, so you can only take the park bus. Then the only selling point, the hot spring, is also very small. You can soak for more than ten minutes at most.
I won't go there again. The Garden Expo Park is good, but this hotel that charges more than 1,000 yuan a night is the worst hotel of the same price I have ever stayed in, no one else.

The day before check-in, a dedicated person will call to provide you with admission tickets and detailed check-in instructions. When we arrived at the hotel that day, Philip‚Äôs service at the front desk was very attentive and professional. He patiently answered all our questions and provided several pages of printed guides. , there are shuttle bus schedules and food maps in the park, very detailedüëç
The room is clean, tidy, comfortable and beautiful. The area is larger than it looks in the photos, and the circulation is very reasonable. It is very comfortable to live in! Highly recommend the private hot spring room! It is a very special experience ~ more private than the dome pool. Moreover, there is a pool and a bathtub in the room, so it‚Äôs almost impossible to take a dipü§£

The hotel's environment can really be praised for a long time. I spent a long time staring at the trea**ent of the curved wall in the lobby, and the splicing of various details on the ground is really hard work! It is completely integrated into the feeling of the nearby old factory area but has a modern and luxurious design style.

The Cave restaurant is stunning! Please be sure to have breakfast! And what everyone is talking about is the underground pool. It‚Äôs so beautiful that you can take any photo. If you go there in the afternoon, the light will be softer!

Definitely a good place to spend the weekend away from the hustle and bustle

There is a dedicated cloakroom, a large bathroom, and a separate small room for the toilet. The bed is comfortable to sleep on, but the pillow is too soft, which may not suit me personally! The lighting is also great. There are shuttle buses in the park, and you can also walk to the hotel on your own. There is a cuddling paradise on your left ü´≤, which is great. Little friends like it! Walking on the right hand side is the Westin and various gardens! Be sure to take a cable car ride and then go up to the viewing platform for afternoon tea. The pizza is great! It‚Äôs just a bit cold during the covering season, so wear more clothes. It‚Äôs recommended to wear a hat when going out in winter! The restaurant is great. You must order the black truffle risotto. If you have an appetite, you can try the steak. This chef is very good at cooking dishes that are comparable to Michelin! It made people gain two kilograms of meat!

In comparison, the room is a little smaller ~ but it does not affect my favorable opinion of it at all. First, when we checked in, I said that we might want to leave later and asked if we could extend the stay, but the Candy House twin room we booked only had that one. There were really too many people who booked the room. If we left late, it would affect the next batch of guests' check-in. However, the front desk still extended my stay for half an hour. I was very satisfied. After all, it was the peak season of the Chinese New Year. Fortunately, I booked early. What I have to praise is the exquisite breakfast. I think it is really thoughtful and worth it! ! The hotel's hot spring is a bonus for guests staying in the hotel. The shape is very good and it is worth checking in. Finally, the area we stayed in is a hotel. It is in the Garden Expo. You can take a ride on the small train, go sightseeing in the cable car, and take a ride on the double-decker bus. Looking forward to next trip~

Service: Very good. The hotel specially prepared roses and refreshments in the private bath. They are very beautiful and my wife likes them very much.
Environment: Very quiet. The hotel is not big but has a strong sense of design. The private hot spring pool is very large.

Next to the hotel is the Time Art Valley, where the Denghuangtang Mountain and the Blacksmith Flowers are located! The hotel shuttle bus can go to various places and is convenient to ride! What a great day with the kids this New Year! The hotel's dome hot spring is amazing! Choosing the right time to avoid the crowds is an ideal experience! In short, I recommend Nanjing Garden Expo Hotel!

The Turkish pond is beautiful and comfortable, and the method of SPA physiotherapist is a must. This time I chose a private soup room. The room was spacious and stylish, and the space separation was very reasonable. The hotel has prepared a rose bubble bath, lit a candle at night, brew a pot of rose tea, and quietly enjoy the nourishment of the hot spring. The private soup pond seems to have heating function. Breakfast is even more amazing, from the design of the restaurant to the menu production. All the staff encountered this time is very enthusiastic, and quickly meets our various needs. After checking out, I was trapped by heavy rain in the park after checkout.

It is a screen wall, with the bathroom and washing area separated on the left and right. Then you enter the room, which has an oversized glass floor-to-ceiling window and a balcony.

The front desk representative gives customers the first impression, but the whole process is very unprofessional, and the only difference is the front desk. Moreover, the hotel said that check-in is after 3 o'clock, and it is very likely that you will have to wait until 4 o'clock. Logically speaking, you must check out at 12 o'clock. It takes 3 hours to clean the private bath. It is recommended that more people be sent if the cleaning cannot be done instead of thanking me for my understanding. I don't understand. The breakfast in the restaurant is pretty good, and I love the wontons the most. I recommend having dinner at the hotel. The Garden Expo is dark and closed, so there isn‚Äôt much to eat or do. The most important thing is that the hot springs are quite good. It takes an hour to drain the water in your room. The public ones are also very nice and comfortable. All in all, it is recommended

msg:You can drive directly to Nanjing city. The hotel has an underground parking lot and the elevator goes directly to the lobby. The room is large, the bathroom and toilet are separate, the staff are very friendly and the service is attentive. I stayed for 2 nights. On the second night, I was told that the room downstairs would be renovated in the morning and it might be noisy. I was moved to another room. However, when I got up in the morning and opened the curtains, I saw a bug... Overall experience Still very good.

Hygiene: The interior is clean and tidy. I booked a room with an open-air balcony on the first floor. The outdoor sofa is not particularly clean because it is outdoors. It is understandable, but it is best to pay more attention.

Environment: The air is very good. Open the curtains in the room and you will see a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãgreen plants. The whole environment is very quiet and very relaxing ~

Service: The hotel staff are quite enthusiastic and will actively guide the way if there are places they don‚Äôt know. Jack, the manager on duty, enthusiastically helped me introduce the route to the entire park, and the service was also very good.

It is not far from the Coca-Cola Museum, Laika Museum, and Pioneer Bookstore, a 10-minute walk. Secondly, the waiters are enthusiastic and have a sense of proportion, and the front desk butler Perri has a very good attitude. Again, the room layout is reasonable. The sleeping area is far away from the corridor, so you will not be disturbed when sleeping late. The large sunken balcony is very comfortable, and the design materials are interesting and complement the industrial style of the park. Finally, I would like to praise the hot springs and breakfast on the first floor. The hot springs relieve fatigue, the breakfast is of good quality, and the coffee beans are great.

The coffee and wine are very particular, and the coffee is even displayed in different types of beans. I ordered a cup of jasmine-flavored American style, which is very delicious, surpassing the taste of many independent coffee shops in Nanjing and Shanghai. There are also many types of wine in the bar. , and has its own creative signboard, very attentive.
In comparison, Banyan Tree's coffee bar is in the same room as the lobby, which is very perfunctory. There is no service staff at the coffee bar, and it seems to be closing down. Moreover, the coffee list is very simple and the price is high, which is outrageous.
The Autograph breakfast is also quite good. The duck blood vermicelli soup is a white soup, and the taste is one of the best duck blood vermicelli soups in Nanjing. The simple bread and pasta ordered in the cafe are also quite amazing, worthy of the price.
A few minor problems in the fly in the oin**ent are that it is difficult to get through the phone at the front desk at night, and the balcony door of the room does not have a screen door, which is not good for ventilation.

One detail: the toilet paper in the room is not easy to break in wet water, and it is very easy to use. There are two bottles of water in front of the bathtub in the bathroom, which is very considerate.

Later, it was found that it needed repairs, and the hotel actively helped to change the room. However, as a hotel belonging to the Marriott Group, hardware problems are the most basic and should not wait for guests to find out. The biggest problem was that the vacation schedule was delayed waiting for a bath. Fortunately, the hotel's attitude towards solving the problem is basically in line with domestic hotel standards. However, the person in charge of Marriott's suggestions can better reflect the brand value. The carpet in the room is not very clean and needs to be improved.

msg:The bed sheets and duvet covers are of very poor quality, like the bedding in a guest house. The quilt cover fell off as soon as I pulled it casually. After checking into the hotel, there was a problem with the faucet in the hot spring pool. The water output was very small. After leaving it for almost an hour, the water was finally full, but the water became cold. After the maintenance, the staff found that there was a problem with the water pipes and started to repair the water pipes. It took half an hour to repair the water pipes and then re-opened the water. I checked in at 5 o'clock and prepared to soak in the hot springs, but I didn't get there until almost 8 o'clock. There was no inspection done before guests checked in. There was no takeout around, so I ordered takeout. After waiting for more than an hour, the takeout finally arrived. The hotel informed us that it would take 40 minutes at the fastest to get the takeaway from the hotel to the room. We said we would pick it up at the door, but we couldn‚Äôt find the takeout when we arrived at the entrance of the scenic spot. The hotel called again to inform them that the takeaway was brought back. As a result, we made a trip in vain in the cold weather, and even misunderstood the delivery boy.

Also, let me talk about the service, I am very satisfied. First of all, after I arrived, maybe due to the New Year's Day holiday, the original room type I booked was not available yet. The account manager apologized to me and took the initiative to upgrade me to the best master suite in their hotel. It was full of sincerity and full of surprises. Secondly, the account manager recognized me immediately no matter when I was waiting for breakfast or when I went to the front desk for consultation. This made me feel very warm and meticulous! Finally, they gave me a farewell gift before leaving, which was really thoughtful. I give full marks to my stay at Autograph this time!

msg:Excellent gaming experience, the hotel has a metal punk industrial style, and my girlfriend said that it is the top three hotels I have stayed in. The service is very attentive, the restaurant Qishe is a must, very authentic western food, breakfast and dinner are very good. The surrounding area is close to Pioneer Bookstore, Coca-Cola Pavilion and so on, and you can walk there. The cave hot spring is actually a bit small, but it is very suitable for girls to take pictures, and it is very good. Before leaving, I also gave a drink as a gift, and I will consider this place in the future. The only thing I would like to comment on is that the corridor leading to the cave hot spring is really scary, it looks too much like the scene of The Shining, maybe some design or cover needs to be added.

msg:Except for some bugs when booking, I was quite happy after checking in. The entrance of the hotel is very low-key, but it is full of sense of the times after entering. The toughness of the machinery and the a**osphere of the lighting are well integrated. The little boy is very excited when he enters the door. I wandered around curiously, but fortunately, the waiter helped me to check in smoothly. Candy Flying House is loved by both boys and girls, if you get into it, you can say that I will sleep here! The overall style is mechanical and modern, and the details of the decoration are well controlled. It is no exaggeration to say that the decoration details of Banyan Tree are more in place. The temperature of the hot spring is comfortable, but there is no one in the locker room. If you want to get another towel and water, you can't find anyone. The environment and feeling of the breakfast are very good, and the products are also very good, but the taste is average, suitable for taking pictures.

I will stay here again next time I come to the Garden Expo. I especially like breakfast. You can order it a la carte. There are steaks and duck blood. The vermicelli and fishball noodles are very delicious. I don‚Äôt remember the names of Perri at the check-in front desk and check-out front desk. The economy in the lobby is very enthusiastic.

Environment: The hotel rebuilt by the factory is eye-catching, and the lobby also gives people a very bright and comfortable feeling. The Internet celebrity hot spring pool is also as good as the online reviews.


Service: Maybe we are traveling on weekdays. I feel that there are few hotels. Except for breakfast, there are some but not many people. Basically, dinner is completely reserved. From check in to check out, every staff member is very supportive. We are all super enthusiastic and meticulous in taking care of them. We are really fans. The little tips we mentioned when we left the hotel are also very careful and humbly listen to opinions.

If you come to the Garden Expo Garden again, it is very possible to have a second visit. After all, there is a restaurant "The Cave" that can catch my appetite for Western food! ! Fans of strength ü§ó

Breakfast: Very rich, and the quality is much better than ordinary hotel breakfasts. Steak and Benedict are well received~ Beef noodles are also delicious

The facilities in the hot spring are also very complete, just take a swim and go there.

I won‚Äôt talk about the room. I like to bask in the sun on the big sofa on the balcony. It‚Äôs very comfortable~

msg:I came to the Garden Expo Park on a different peak and wanted to relax, but unfortunately yq is closed and the attractions in the park are closed, so I can only stroll around.
There are many Garden Expo Park hotels. After doing a lot of strategies, I chose Autograph Hotel. The actual experience did not disappoint me.

Hotel service: Miss Miko at the front desk is very kind and takes the initiative to help solve the problem~ including all the service staff with a very good attitude. If you want to go in the park, you can tell us in advance where you want to go, and you can take us by shuttle bus, including picking us up, I counted about 7 or 8 calls, and I was very free and happy.

Hotel environment: The design style is indeed as fashionable and beautiful as I thought, and every shot is a beautiful view. Because it is off-season, whether it is a restaurant or a soup, it is a private room. We also arranged a room with a good view on the fourth floor with us. I feel very comfortable~

Hotel breakfast: We booked for two days, so we ate two breakfasts, which were in the form of semi-buffet. The buffet part was very ordinary, the bread and toast were very ordinary, the cold salad was not very delicious, and the √† la carte menu was fixed. Yes, we basically ate it once in 2 days. Except for the delicious beef noodles, I think it's just average... Not up to expectations, I hope it can be improved

If there is a chance in the future, I will come back again. I will wait for the park to open to see the fireworks and take the cable car. I heard that the snow scene is beautiful in winter. I look forward to it~

msg:Taking advantage of the early spring and weekends, I came for a quick trip. Because I brought my children, I decided to choose a place to play. I didn't want to climb mountains and wading, so I chose the Garden Expo Park in Nanjing. After comparing hotels for half a day, I chose Autograph with private soup in the room. The Garden Expo is huge, and Autograph is exquisite. The industrial-style exterior design and modern decoration seem to be a hidden space hidden in the mountains. The child likes the hot spring in the room very much, and has soaked it several times. The breakfast in the restaurant is also unique, and it is worth recommending. Too many, the hotel contacted me two days in advance, asked about the number of people staying, etc., and thoughtfully gave the electronic codes of three tickets, and placed the children's supplies in the room in advance. The service is very attentive, and we feel very warm. The child said that next time he brought his younger sister to live in Autograph again, I believe, he will choose Autograph again next time.

The changing room of the hot spring is very small! There are only two places to blow your hair and a seat for changing clothes! It's hard to imagine what it's like to be crowded on weekends!

I can feel that several details of the room have added elements in this regard, such as the glass-cement pendant above the bathtub. , the pulley pendant lamp at the head of the bed. . . During the stay, the service of the hotel was very good. From the front desk to the restaurant, from the hot spring reception, to the doorman at the door, all the waiters encountered were very warm.

msg:It has a great sense of design, the restaurant is also good, the breakfast is very rich, and there are steaks. Overall satisfied. The only shortcoming is that the hotel's shuttle service is not in place, and there are few shuttle buses. The hotel introduction said that it can provide shuttle service from the entrance of the park to the hotel. We took a taxi directly to the hotel, but depending on the situation of the hotel car, we could not connect. We went to the entrance of the park for a drop-in inspection and there was no car, so we took the dedicated line of the park to the entrance and walked a long way to find the nucleic acid point. The hotel shares the swimming pool with Westin, but the hotel does not have a corridor directly connected, and there is no shuttle bus, so you need to walk uphill and downhill. Later, I specifically asked the hotel to arrange for the car to be delivered, and I felt a little embarrassed to trouble others. Hope the shuttle bus can do better. The Radisson Hotel next to it is not as good as us, but there are many shuttle buses.

It retains the industrial style of the factory building, and regenerates some production equipment into works of art. It is full of personality, fashionable and advanced, and it is completely based on my aesthetics. This time I stayed in the Hanguan King Room. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk, vicky, provided very good service. She answered my questions warmly and patiently and in detail, and even gave me a small gift. Although the variety of breakfast is not so many, it is more exquisite and delicious. The whole stay experience was very good!

First of all, the car enters the park and goes directly to the underground garage of the hotel, which avoids the high temperature of the car from being exposed to the sun in summer.
The lobby is very large and spacious, with distinctive decoration. Miko, the guest service manager, is a big beauty with warm and thoughtful service, very friendly.
Check-in at 3 pm, we arrived early, the service staff immediately arranged for us to check in early, and the reserved room also gave us a free upgrade.
The breakfast has both Chinese and Western styles. Although there are not many varieties, they are all exquisite. The elderly and children are very happy to eat.
I especially like the gym and hot springs, which are clean and comfortable. It is very convenient to live in the park at night to visit the Garden Expo Park. In short, Autograph Hotel is recommended for family outings in summer.

The hot spring has a public area, as well as private soup in the room. The room has a pool on the balcony. There is a bamboo forest in front of you. The pool has a lot of space. It needs to be released an hour in advance.

For dinner, I chose the 2-person set menu in the secret realm of Qishe. The taste is very good, and the pasta is especially suitable for me.

Breakfast is specially mentioned here. In addition to the bread, salad, pan-fried stalls that every hotel will have, Nanjing specialty food, small wonton noodles, Jinling meat buns, etc., there are also eggs Benedict, steak and omelettes to choose from... Juice, coffee, etc. If you don't love it, you can choose Evian and Paris Water

The overall service of the hotel is really good. Every place has a warm and meticulous service experience, which is especially suitable for young people to relax on vacation. Staying for two or three days in a row has a better experience.

msg:The second time I stayed at this Autograph Collection in Nanjing, I was still impressed by her unique design! The streamlined American retro style is too cool. You can shoot high-quality blockbusters pretending to be abroad wherever you go! This time, I accidentally found that the balcony is also very good, especially in the early morning when it snowed in winter, there is a unique sense of loneliness and coldness unique to Autograph, and I feel like I live in a museum!

I missed the bar called The Silo last time, which is in line with the overall style of the hotel. It feels very cold, which is in line with the identity of Autograph's own cement factory, haha. Hidden on the first floor of the hotel, when you go in at night, the body feels a little cold, but it still has a sense of a**osphere!

Metal texture and black tone, put together, not to mention how cool. I don't like bars that are too noisy, and the silo just fits my aesthetic. I ordered a glass of smoothie cocktail, also known as dry cement. The taste is very special, like the taste of mojito, with a touch of mint fragrance, mixed with a little freshness of citrus. The dried fruit inserted in the smoothie must not be missed, kiwi fruit slices and orange slices are actually delicious!

Finally, I would like to praise Autograph's care. Each fragrance is different. It has a very natural herbal taste. It is very similar to Aesop, another Australian plant skin care brand. I love it!

üßπHygiene: Check the sanitation of the hotel, you will know when you enter the üöª toilet~ It is indeed the standard of a star-rated hotel, very clean and comfortable. Not to mention the hygiene of natural public areas and rooms.

üçÉEnvironment: In the private soup in the room, you can see the opposite bamboo forest. It is a little embarrassing that there will be workers who maintain the bamboo forest during the day, so there will be some concerns about privacy.

üîîService: Miss Yuri at the front desk and little brother Nick, the concierge, are not only good-looking, but also very nice in service. They personally help us to introduce the scenic spots‚Äô travel route suggestions, as well as the negotiation of pick-up and parking. I am quite satisfied üòÑ

The breakfast provided by the hotel is good. Both Chinese and Western food are very rich. It is worth mentioning that the Western food area has everything from eggs Benedict, steak, waffles, and muffins. Basic solution for brunch~
Hotel dinner options are relatively limited, only Western restaurants, the price is relatively high ~ the basic per capita in 400-500.
Generally speaking, I am quite satisfied. I hope the quality of the toiletries in the room can be improved, and the room with private soup can be equipped with some small benefits that can be enjoyed when bathing in the soup~ It will be more perfect.

After getting up, the shoes are wet and not easy to dry. It takes a long time to call for slippers and bath towels. By the way, I asked an aunt who was cleaning at the door. Are the items in the Mini refrigerator free? Auntie said: How can it be free, you have to pay for it! After he finished speaking, he turned around and entered another room, and while walking, he said to another staff member in the room, "Ask me if I need money for the things in the refrigerator. How can I eat it for free!" In fact, you can just say that you need to pay, and we don't understand Chinese! Why do you have to shout about the bag, it's very uncomfortable.

Maybe it was because there were so many people. The pasta that cost more than 100 yuan looked cheap. The price of 20 yuan is also very sour. The pure tomato sauce does not have the feeling of meat sauce. The steak is also very average. Although it is not expensive at more than 700 yuan after the discount, it is really unpalatable. The breakfast is even more speechless. It is the first time I have eaten at a buffet. You need to queue up at the door to wait for a seat for breakfast. Do you know that the decoration will not take the passenger flow into consideration? Isn‚Äôt it a bit too low-key for a group of people to wait at the door to call their room number for breakfast? Although I prepared a small car for the children to play at the door, I just felt a bit speechless. Anyway, this is my first time staying in a hotel and this happened to me. It was in the corridor. The aromatherapy smells so bad that it gives me a headache, but the waiters are really nice. I hope that such a high-quality hotel can improve the details.

msg:A hotel with a strong sense of design located in the Nanjing Garden Expo Park, there are textures that I love everywhere. Cement, marble, metal, glass, materials with different mechanisms are particularly well integrated. The soft part also has the popular medieval and camping style. The entire hotel is surrounded by bamboo forests, and the bamboo leaves have different light and shadows at different times through the glass. The design is full of details, and even the courtesy car is industrial. If you like this style, be bold and live here in Nanjing!
.
Liquan is a public soup pool area. There are very few people in the morning. I share the beauty of this place with several other strange ladies and sisters, and do not interfere with each other to take pictures. Hahaha üòÜThe shape of the cave echoes the theme of the entire hotel, and the lighting design is particularly good. The warm light on the walls on both sides flickered like a flame, and the water in the reflecting pool was sparkling. All in all, it's really beautiful! cry!
It is also worth mentioning that the gym is also very good. The equipment is all Technogym, and the variety is very complete. It is a large area in the major hotels in Nanjing. But Autograph does not have a standard swimming pool. If you want to swim, you need to go to the Westin Hotel next door (one of them says it can use a general swimming pool)
.
This time I stayed in a private soup room, and the pool was on the outdoor balcony. It was more than enough for two people who were quite big. The bamboo forest facing them provided privacy. I soaked it at night, and it was really comfortable to soak for half an hour in 0 degree weather outside. If you don't like public hot springs, then be sure to try private hot springs.
.
In addition to accommodation and relaxation, coming to the Garden Expo Garden is to eat, drink and have fun. Autograph should be the closest hotel to Pioneer Bookstore, just a few minutes walk. It is also separated by a Westin from the Thirteen Gardens. However, it is really not interesting to visit the Garden Expo Park as a whole, it is better to soak in the hotel.
If you dine in the hotel's own restaurant, the taste is still okay. It is a western dinner in the evening and a buffet breakfast in the morning. The whole restaurant is very beautiful to take pictures, suitable for dating üåù The service attitude is also good, and the plates and tableware are replaced in a timely manner.

msg:A new hotel with a very design sense in Nanjing Garden Expo Park. It is owned by Marriott with Westin. I booked a private soup room before the snow forecast, and the whole thing was very cool.
The hotel as a whole focuses on the future industrial style, and the public space renovated from the old factory is full of small interests: the lobby is novel and unique and eye-catching, and the sofas and floating devices in the rest area are very distinctive and full of futuristic sense. The room is even more extra. The private soup room has a large space, which should be about 50-60 square meters. The functional area is divided reasonably. The independent toilet has a small wash basin.
It is worth mentioning that the pool that comes with the balcony is very large. With the introduction of Tangshan hot spring water, there is no problem for a family of three to soak in the soup together. It takes more than an hour to fill the pool alone. The room is air-conditioned and heated, so it's very warm. There is also a cave-style indoor hot spring public pool on the first floor of the hotel, which is very distinctive. However, compared with the mottled light and shadow designed by the private soup, the natural landscape of the bamboo forest and the sea, the private soup in the room is more comfortable and worth a try. There is also a place in the hotel that is particularly suitable for punching in: there is a bamboo forest outside, which is quiet and elegant. Personally, the effect of filming makes people feel that you are in the bamboo forest in the lobby of the Sanya EDITION every minute. Hahaha!
Another must-compliment is the breakfast! Full of local specialties, such as duck blood vermicelli soup and Jinling meat buns, it is the best breakfast I have had in Nanjing hotel so far! Especially the Jinling Big Meat Bun, I really wanted to ask the waiter to bring two of them to pack for me, but I held back. Ha ha.
It is definitely one of the most worthy hotels in the Garden Expo Park!

msg:Very good hotel, for the first time I saw a hotel that can be integrated with industrial style, and the photos have a strong sense of industrial film. The hotel is located in the Garden Expo Park, the surrounding environment has nothing to say, you can also enjoy the entire Garden Expo Park. The hotel service is also very good, the staff will greet customers politely when they see it. The room facilities are luxurious, there is a super large floor-to-ceiling window, the balcony has a sofa, and it is particularly pleasant to drink and chat on the balcony to enjoy the beautiful scenery. 100% recommended! !

msg:A very bad stay experience, extremely bad service level and hotel management, said to be owned by Marriott, it feels a bit smashing the Marriott brand.
Let's talk about the advantages first:
1. The room facilities and space are good, it is the level that this price should have, and it is relatively new. The TV with screen projection function is rare in five-star hotels. The balcony is a terrace with a great view
2. The breakfast is delicious and the service attitude of the restaurant staff is very good

Next, let's spit out a few very low-level questions:
1. Before check-in, call the front desk and ask how to get from Dongning Gate to the hotel parking lot in the park. The front desk actually said that the hotel cannot be reached from the inside, and you must detour from outside the park and enter through Gate 4. Later, under the guidance of the security master, it was successfully opened from the inside. The front desk business ability is worrying.
2. After checking into the hotel, I found that there were dead insects on the wall of the room that night, which was very conspicuous. Apparently it hasn't been cleaned up for a long time, very disgusting.
3. The quilt on the bed is not expected to be spotless, but there are many obvious stains. This is not the bedding that a five-star hotel should provide. This is not even comparable to the Han court.
4. When taking a shower in the morning, I opened the wash bag and found that the shaving set was an empty shell, which was not replaced in time. Combining the above two problems, I am completely tired here. Such a quality control, how dare I open the business. As a member who often lives in Marriott, I really think that this store will continue to open like this, it will be a brand name.

There was also a small episode when checking out. A guest at the front desk quarreled because the hotel called the hotel to renew and check out in advance. From this point of view, the management problem of the hotel is really not a little bit.

Comprehensive evaluation, the hardware is no problem, worthy of this price. However, in terms of software such as service and hygiene, it is so disappointing that I don't want to give it one star.
I don't recommend this hotel for friends who often stay in hotels and care about details and quality - a traveler who spends a quarter of the night in the hotel on a business trip all year round.

The lengthy autumn and winter is worse than bathing in the spring and watching the warm sun.

I met with my sisters on the weekend, booked a bath in Autograph Hot Spring Hotel, and shared some experience of staying~

üìçAddress: No. 7 Jinxiu Road in the Garden Expo Park
üöòTraffic: Drive in the city for about half an hour, and you can enter the park free of charge with the hotel‚Äôs appoin**ent text message.

Autograph is a high-end hotel brand under Marriott, and Garden Expo is the third in the country. The hotel is built on the basis of the old cement factory. It is empty, with the main industrial style, and the details are exquisite and have a sense of design.

‚ñ´Ô∏èRoom
We booked two rooms this time, one with twin beds and one with big bed with private soup. The building has an area of 60 square meters, spacious, separated from wet and dry, equipped with a bathtub in the room, and toiletries are made by Appelles. Special praise for the hotel slippers, which are very comfortable and have a sense of relaxation from home.

‚ñ´Ô∏è onsen
The private bath room type is equipped with a hot spring pool on the balcony of the room, and you can enjoy the mountain hot springs facing the bamboo forest after putting the water ‚ô®Ô∏è. For other room types, you can choose the hot spring in the public area of the hotel.

‚ñ´Ô∏èRestaurant
The hotel has an all-day dining restaurant, the cave, where dinner and breakfast are served. The entrance of the restaurant is like a space capsule, and walking inside is an industrial cave world. The dining a**osphere is very good, the bread before the meal is freshly baked, very fragrant, the variety of dishes is not too much, about 600 per person. (The a**osphere is good at night, but taking pictures is better during the day!)

‚ñ´Ô∏èCafe&Bar
On the right side of the lobby is the Qingtai Caf√©, which was renovated by the factory. Walking down the steps, you can see the steampunk bar silo. The view is good, the green plants are pleasant, the morning C and the evening A have a drink, which has a special flavor.

‚ñ´Ô∏èMember discount
Marriott Platinum Card members can enjoy the first round of mini bar for free and stay in the fruit plate~

The garden expo garden has excellent scenery in late autumn. Living in the hot springs in late autumn is the most satisfying leisure trip recently~

msg:Objectively speaking, the hardware is not bad, and the hotel design also integrates with the environment. But it's a pity that the price is not high. We also hope that the resort hotels in Nanjing can do better, and we can have a bubble hotel nearby on weekends. We arrived at about one o'clock when we checked in. The front desk said that it was still cleaning. This is normal. We are going to play first and then come back. Then I asked about the time I could check in, and I replied that it was 3:30 to 4:00. Usually two to two-thirty, it was the first time I met after three-thirty. Then there is a funny point, I asked them if the hotel has an outdoor soup pool? The waiter said that there is Westin next door, we can go there for a dip. At dinner, I asked the waiter if the hotel has a Chinese restaurant? The waiter said that there is Westin next door, we can go there to eat. It's ridiculous when I take the elderly and children around the Westin in a big circle at night, why I haven't decided on the Westin... It's cheaper than this. There is no free drink in the refrigerator in the room, the waiter said there is welcome fruit. We waited until before going to bed and it was not there. I called in doubt, and the waiter said that she checked our room. Even if there are inconsistencies, I am not unfamiliar with this fruit, I just hope that the a**osphere of the vacation is better. I also saw that the fruit served by the waiter was a cheap fruit such as apples and pears. We should not be so embarrassed at this price. At eleven o'clock the next day, my family called to ask what time to check out at the latest, so we figured out the time to clean up in advance. "Hello, what is the latest time to check out?" The other party replied, "Please check out as soon as possible..." Barabara piled up. My family asked again, "No, we know, we just want to ask what is the latest time to check out?" face to answer...! After several back and forth, she said I went to ask, but she didn't know! ! ! Can it be normal? !

The sign is not very clear, but the service staff solved it very well. It is recommended to add a sign to guide the way. The smell of the room is still there, the private bath is on the balcony, the weather is too hot and there are mosquitoes so I did not experience it.
Breakfast is an order ‚ûï self-service mode. I ordered Benedict but the eggs were all solidified, which is very difficult to understand. The breakfast variety and price do not match well, it is recommended to strengthen.
Generally speaking, it is a more suitable hotel to go with your girlfriends or friends. There are not many parent-child facilities, so bringing children may be more limited.

After 3 o'clock, the room was checked and I called and notified me to get the room card. I went out to play with my children and waited. I didn't receive any notification until 7 pm. I got the room card and complained to the hotel. The manager contacted me to give me a piece of fruit. I refused. I would like to ask if the hotel has a serious delay in check-in and the outdoor temperature is extremely low, causing guests and children to wait for a long time. Anything to show the advantages of caring service in a five-star hotel? Compensation for a piece of fruit I don't know how Autograph's manager thinks about it? If the room rate is calculated on an hourly basis, how much can a 4-hour delay be converted into? Guests do not feel any attentive service.
Facilities: The overall design of the new hotel is rather fancy, but as a hot spring resort hotel, the heating in the public area makes people unable to complain, the corridors and lobby are very cold, and the corridor from the b1 floor to the public pool is very windy
A friend booked a private soup room, isn't it really not ordinary hot water? No hot spring water smell
The overall stay experience is very general, the room is also smelly, will not go again

Because ** takeout cannot be delivered to the park, so I called the guest room and asked if I could send someone to buy it for me to pay for it. After that, I called and asked another hotel in the park. They provided earplugs. I called the guest room and hoped to get them for me. I was told that the concierge was going to get off work, and there was no way to get them for me. ? ? ? I was perfunctoryly rejected by the other end of the phone. At eleven or twelve o‚Äôclock in the evening, the lights in the park were dark. How could I get it myself? I don't think my request is too much. The price of more than 1,000 per night should not make customers feel unhappy at all. After all, experience = experience - cost. Your hotel is in the park, which is not convenient enough. Solve problems for customers, luxury hotels are not luxury if they are not hardware, nor are they worthy of the price with a smile on your face. If the hotel is 300 yuan, I will not write this at all.

1388 stay in the private soup building with double breakfast and tickets, you can also stay for a few nights at this price, yes you read that right. For non-weekends, book the most basic room type, the hotel can be upgraded for free, don't book other ones to take advantage of. This slapstick operation seconds *any Marriott Premium Member.
After knowing this black box operation, I went to the hotel to find the theory. The manager reluctantly said "I can upgrade you a big room", but I made it clear that I came to Zhuguan for private soup, even if there is no private soup in a big room, we just ask The same rights and interests as the guests of the same period, others stay 2 consecutive nights at the price of 1388, and we also stay 2 consecutive nights according to this. The manager didn't seem to understand at all, and only replied "Your request is too much". It's ridiculous, if you have the ability, don't let the guests know about the black box operation. If you know, you can't achieve equal rights and interests of the guests? Marriott's customer service is also shirking the ball. Marriott has flourished and declined.
Besides other things, there are very few things for breakfast, except for a few that can be ordered, the self-pickup is simply the standard of a chain hotel like Hanting; the private soup cannot be private, and there is no sunshade; the TV is small and the layout is unreasonable, lying down The bed was unpleasant to look at; there was no desk in the room, etc.
The Garden Expo Park is still worth playing a few more times. The attractions are still increasing, and I will definitely bring babies in the future, but I will not live in this one anymore, including the Westin by Marriott next to it. .

msg:I chose this hotel among many newly opened hotels. I really regret it after I stayed there. There are no children's products, the room has a smell, and the socket in the bathroom is still broken, which is very inconvenient. The design of the lounge area in the lobby is also very good. Unreasonable, my son bumped into the corner of the table twice, really angry! There are really few varieties of breakfast in the hotel, learn more from other hotels
