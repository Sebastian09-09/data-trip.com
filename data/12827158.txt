msg:The main thing is to stay in a hotel. The hotel room is okay. Photos will be posted later. The supporting facilities outside are really unreasonable. They are relatively deserted. There is no shop. You cannot eat lunch or dinner. The hot springs enter at 8 o'clock. Outdoor lights are all. It's not turned on, and the word is black. It is said that it is raining and the switch can't be pushed up. There is a children's play area indoors. Fortunately, the pictures will be played back later!

msg:At about 10 o'clock that evening, I looked for a hotel. When I checked into the hotel, it seemed that I was the only guest. And it rains heavily. It was a bit hard to find the way. I followed the navigation and drove to the back door of the hotel. It was dark and frightened.
See a place where the lights are on, and find the front entrance of the hotel
The facilities are very good and the hotel is very beautiful.

In addition, because of the epidemic, the hotel's hot springs only opened at 2 pm, so the set meal with hot spring tickets was a waste.

It is recommended to read the instructions first when making reservations in the future.

msg:Unfortunately, there is no 0 points, otherwise 0 points must be given. Ctrip rarely gives bad reviews, this is really bad! It was unspeakably disgusting. The room was very dirty, moldy everywhere, and moldy on the top. The quilt was made of ultra-low-quality chemical fiber fabric. Fortunately, I brought my own quilt. Breakfast, ha ha, nothing at all. When we entered the restaurant, there was nothing. The waiter said that the chef helped us get some buns and eggs. We were so angry that we had to return our meal coupons. It was disgusting! There are more than 500 rubbish in one place. The more than 500 I live in other places are at least a hundred times better than this. Too rubbish too rubbish

msg:沒有更差的了，前台那個**臉永遠都不會笑，陰拉拉的讓人看着就來氣。一次性拖鞋質量不好多要一個，説夜間沒有服務員，需要自己前台拿。去拿了，居然還説多要需要收費！搞笑的**！酒店大廳共用衞生間紙都沒有……晚上回去酒店二號樓大堂燈都沒有。辦理完入住以後，上門掏馬桶……不知道早幹嘛去了，關鍵還沒有掏好。挺不錯的硬件，還有温泉，關鍵是軟服務跟不上啊！悲哀！

msg:太棒的親子酒店了，孩子還沒住夠，還要再來住。房間和圖片描述的一樣，三張床帶滑滑梯。送一家的温泉票還有三張早餐卷。就是非節日人不多，所以温泉沒有開全。温泉二樓還有桑拿按摩。晚餐我們去附近的馬頭鎮去吃的，酒店也可以吃。服務態度也很好，見到的每一個工作人員都很熱情。位置離河邊挺近，導航可以找到。

msg:#房間設施木地板很多破洞，門裡麪鎖也壞了一道，長頸鹿玩具也是壞的，房間內燈光昏暗，整體感覺陳舊。親子主題房，除了房間內多一個滑梯，沒有看到任何關於服務親子的服務設施。寒酸的小童遊樂場一層灰，空調暖氣一律不開放，冷的不能玩。親子房間在後麪院子，又黑又冷又遠，路燈都不帶開的，你們這些無腦管理者啊！！！#衞生衞生很差，房間內隨處可見的臟兮兮，別的住客遺留下來的頭髮，碎屑垃圾，地面，地毯很臟，小孩子也沒法拖鞋赤腳行走玩耍，搖籃椅上面更臟，不想説了，酒店管理者看到你自己睜眼去瞅瞅吧！#服務沒有服務可言，房間一次性拖鞋不夠，要個拖鞋磨磨唧唧廢話，前台冰冷無笑容，臨走退按金也是頭都不抬一下。打完折500，嚴重不符合這個價位標準，印象極差！#早餐早餐時間截止到8點半，度假酒店就是休息遊玩，這個時間是不是有點不合理？8點25到的，基本沒飯了，服務員説是我們來晚了。小米粥涼的，就幾個可憐的涼菜。幸虧廚房還給温了幾杯牛奶，僅存一點對服務者的感激吧。#性價比沒有一點！體驗過最差酒店沒有之一！幫身邊朋友避坑！真實評價親身經歷，臨沂度假酒店這應該是最差的！至少我這次是！
