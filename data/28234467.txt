I would like to thank Alex, Jasmine and Tina who received me. Their meticulous service made my experience even better.
The hotel's breakfast and steakhouse are also great, whether it is the taste, service or scenery. You can see the roof of the Forbidden City while dining.
The local location is also very good, right in the Wangfujing area, and there is also a subway station nearby, which is very convenient to go anywhere.

The service is very good, breakfast and afternoon tea are in the Chinese restaurant. Breakfast is semi-buffet and very comfortable to eat. Afternoon tea is a set and seasonal. I actually forgot the waiter's name! (She remembered us, she had worked at the steakhouse before, and she knew Nacho)
Semi-buffet brunch is only available on weekends at Mandarin Grill. Very nice. I highly recommend their bakery. It smells like butter as soon as you pick it up, and the croissant tastes just like what you remember, not the sweet and greasy taste it has now. Quietly, there is a dessert buffet at brunch, so you can eat from the dessert room if you don‚Äôt pursue restrictions. The Nacho team is awesome! Cici is cheerful and Brian is steady! Great team.

msg:My family is celebrating their birthday on the weekend. Thinking about it, I almost live in the suburbs of Beijing. After three years of epidemic, there is really no place to stay in a hotel in the suburbs of Beijing. This time I chose Wangfujing Oriental Mandarin MO in Beijing. Let me talk about the location first. Although I have lived in Beijing for decades and have never stayed in Wangfujing, I can clearly see landmarks such as the Great Hall of the People and the Forbidden City from the hotel this year. The hotel is convenient for going to Tiananmen Square to watch the flag-raising or the Forbidden City and Wangfujing Commercial Street. It is suitable for family travel without wasting time and energy. The hotel is just above Wangfu Central, which is convenient for shopping and eating. Opposite is Hamlet, the largest toy store in Beijing, and Wangfujing Commercial Street.
Service: After checking in at the hotel, a handsome man led us into the room and introduced the hotel facilities. Since it was a birthday, the hotel also upgraded the room type for free. I heard that the children had a habit of napping in the afternoon and arranged a late check-out for us. The service cannot be said enough. Especially the professional and warm service provided by the front desk butler Alex Nana Jeff Lenny.
Eat: The hotel‚Äôs steakhouse serves Western food and brunch. The Chinese food in the hotel is a Chinese restaurant called Zishan. We had a meal and the dishes were not to mention. The breakfast was semi-buffet and it was also at Zishan.
The second MO in Beijing is about to open. It has a courtyard theme right at the front door. I look forward to experiencing it next time.

Later we had a great time and ordered several special cocktails. Every service staff here was full of enthusiasm. Finally, special thanks to Alex, Nana and Lenny.

msg:A very warm and satisfying stay experience. It was very cold this weekend but we felt warm and happy, especially with a baby. Because the baby likes duck elements, we informed the relevant hotel staff in advance and the hotel helped prepare little yellow duck balloons for the baby. I was very happy when I checked in and kept saying that I would come back next time. The hotel took great pains to arrange the baby's sugar control request. The exquisite snacks prepared were specially prepared to reduce sugar. It was great. I took my baby to the hospital today because I was not sure whether I would be able to come back at noon. A handsome and tall staff at the front desk was very helpful. He patiently and attentively told me not to be anxious, and helped us delay check-out until three o'clock, so that we had enough time to take a rest after taking the baby back from the hospital, and the baby could also adjust. In fact, the normal check-out time is two o'clock in the afternoon. Thank you very much for the warm-hearted gesture of the staff in special circumstances. I have been to Beijing frequently with my baby in the past few years. This is my first time staying at the Mandarin Oriental. The internal environment and the overall quality of the staff are worthy of praise. The staff are polite and smiling everywhere I go. I think I will stay there again in the future. I will choose Mandarin Oriental Hotel again with my parents and family, thank you!

Advantages: Family travel, the hotel has an excellent location, cleanliness is the most basic and most important need, the biggest highlight of the hotel is that every staff is very warm and generous. When I came back from going out, I found that there was an extra fence beside the bed, and I felt happy and warm.

Disadvantages: The free drinking water in the room is probably recycled in glass bottles. After taking a sip, it feels like the tap water that the hotel has bottled itself. The taste is a bit strong and I can't drink it. What era is it? There is still a minibar charge, which is a bit too stingy. Although I stayed for 2 nights for 12,000 and got a 600 consumption coupon, it is better to control the cost of the minibar in exchange for the favor and praise of the guests. The room fee is 6400, the room is worth 3000, and the rest is the warm service fee

2. The evaluation is based on personal taste and family taste. First of all, the Chinese restaurant, the dishes and taste are really unsatisfactory. But I really strongly recommend the Western restaurant, both the taste and quality of the dishes are absolutely excellent.
The disadvantage is that the service staff in the Chinese restaurant do not know the etiquette of Chinese food when serving soup food. The water on the lid is actually thrown into the soup, which is a bit speechlessüòì. The foreign service staff in the Western restaurant can speak Chinese but insists on speaking English, which is a bit uncomfortable.
3. The hotel service staff is very enthusiastic, and the surprise is to introduce the room, which is not available in other hotel groups.
Overall, I will choose one of the hotels to stay in when I go to Beijing in the futureüòÄ

I didn't inform the hotel about my birthday, but on the day of my birthday, the room was decorated and a delicious cake was delivered, which was very attentive. Full of experience.
The only thing that I think is not very friendly is probably because the pipes are old and there is no water purification system installed. There are too many minerals in the water, and washing your face and hair will feel unclean, and it is not suitable for the water quality.

msg:I stayed at the Oriental Culture in Sanya a few years ago. Although the hotel is quite old and the facilities are relatively old, the environment is very good and the service is very impressive.

This time I spent a weekend with my baby in Beijing, which was recommended by a friend of Culture East. Of course, from getting off the car to checking in, the service is still very good. Two days before check-in, I also asked about accommodation preferences and the gender of the children, and said that they would prepare gifts, which was very considerate.

But at around 9 o'clock on the first night, my children and I were about to wash up. My daughter suddenly yelled and found a spider in the bathtub. Since we were both very afraid of such insects, I immediately called the front desk and asked to come and deal with it.

After waiting for a while, a staff member came over, wrapped the spider in paper, and brought a cleaner to help us disinfect and clean the bathtub. During the whole process, the children and I were quite nervous until we were sure that the spider had been wrapped. But the staff did not apologize to me, but just let me understand that because of the hot weather, our room is a terrace room, and the spider may have crawled in through the terrace door.

First, we didn't open that door that day. Secondly, it was already ten o'clock at that time, and the room should have a turndown service. Have you checked the hygiene conditions in all aspects? That night, my children and I waited for the cleaners to disinfect and clean before starting to wash. The child is only seven years old, and has completely exceeded the usual rest time. It takes about 20 minutes to wait for the cleaning to be completed. The child was obviously frightened, so he didn't go to bed until very late that night. I

The hotel didn't even have any place to apologize, just asking for understanding...Sorry, I can't understand at this moment...

Since it was very late that night, I didn't mention anything to the hotel staff, I just hurriedly got the children to wash up and go to bed. I wanted to see if the hotel would respond to me the next day. Well, the truth is no. We stayed in the hotel for a total of two nights, and after the incident, there was no more.

It wasn't a big deal at first, but from that night to when I checked out, I was not satisfied with the hotel's attitude in handling such emergencies. As a hotel known for its service, I hope the hotel can make corrections. Treat every customer with sincerity.

The breakfast meal was a bit messy, which caused great inconvenience to both customers and hotel service staff! I was very surprised.

The view of the Forbidden City is very wonderful! There is a commercial street behind the hotel, where you can find everything! The hotel service is also very considerate. Toys and rocking horses are specially prepared for the baby. The baby is tired from shopping and falls asleep in the lobby downstairs. The service staff in the lobby will dim the lights thoughtfully.

I have to say that I felt the enthusiasm of Gunnar and Tongfei as soon as I entered the front desk. Quincy, the manager on duty that day, was also super polite and introduced me Looking at the hotel culture, the calmness and confidence made me have a strong interest in the culture of Mandarin Oriental.


Facilities: Speaking of facilities, we have to mention Mobar, which is on the Forbes list. The environment is first-class. With the help of Miranda, I was lucky to see the sunset of the Forbidden City. Miranda‚Äôs enthusiasm added more youth and vitality to this mobar. The breath, left a happy memory in the bar.
If there is a chance next time, I want to experience it again. Such beautiful and warm memories.

msg:This stay at Mandarin Oriental was as satisfying as ever. At that time, I chose this hotel mainly because of its geographical location. It is downstairs in Wangfu Central, and it is very convenient to visit the Forbidden City or shopping malls. The most important thing that attracted us to stay at Wenhua was his humanized service. From the moment we arrived at the hotel entrance, there was an enthusiastic little brother to help with our luggage. During the entire stay, all the little brothers and sisters were always there The attitude is very good, just this kind of good, not the kind of polite and stylized service, but the kind of enthusiasm that can make you feel intimate. Special mention should be made of a little brother named quincy, during the two days we stayed, he was very enthusiastic to recommend options for us to eat, drink and have fun around, and because there seemed to be construction one night, my husband got up and called to ask As a result of the situation, the hotel even sent the fruit plate as compensation. Although the matter was not a big deal, it was very heartwarming. There is another one, if I remember correctly, the name is Alex chi. Before I left, there were some packages that I bought from Taobao that I had to return, so I asked him to help me deal with them all.

msg:Let me talk about a bug that surprised me first! It takes three minutes for the water in the sink to heat up, and it takes another three minutes to turn it off and on again! Not only does it make people wait speechlessly, but the water is also wasted to make people feel distressed! There is also a downside that is enough to make people collapse, that is, the water in the rain is hot and cold throughout the whole process, and it is impossible to take a hot bath with peace of mind, not to mention relaxing the tired body, it is simply frightening, and the body and mind are ready üò≠ The fire is big! However, the maintenance staff responded quickly and did a good job of repairing it.
Let's talk about full marks~
Mandarin Oriental's service is really nothing to say! I called three days in advance to ask about my preferences, whether there are any children, and asked carefully about boys and girls, because the children‚Äôs equipment (see Figure 12) is divided into men and women, and the children‚Äôs equipment is a big box, absolutely not perfunctory, and the variety is complete Portions are huge! Even the welcome desserts are presented according to the ages of the guests. Because there are children in our family, we present cute chocolate dots (Figure 13). For the elderly in the parents‚Äô room, we prepare a large box of soft pastries ( No picture here), I ate until I left Beijingü§£.
In terms of facilities, the room is quite big, the bed is very comfortable, and the slippers (Picture 8) have a sense of stepping on ****. The tea set (Picture 6) and ornaments (Picture 7) are very historical and fit the ancient and traditions of old Beijing! There are also a lot of hangers (Figure 10), and they are of a complete range. There are corresponding hangers for suits, shirts, trousers, and skirts. Moreover, shoe lasts and lulu yoga mats are also provided (Figure 9)!
The smiles of the waiters are very kind, from the heart, definitely not a professional smile, and they are considerate of the guests, because they arrived early, and the room has not come out after check-in, but you can rest assured to hand over your luggage to them, the room After coming out, they will responsibly send you back to the room, and they will call me to notify me, and they will also help me receive a courier, and send it back to the room thoughtfully.
Although the windows of the room cannot face the Forbidden City, the small windows on the side can see the golden roofs of the Forbidden City! (Unfortunately no picture here)
In short, it is still highly recommended, after all, the water flow in every room should not be so erratic, right? The wholehearted service, perfect bedding, comfortable equipment and well-established accessories really make people willing to pay expensive room rates üòò

msg:Hello friends from Wangfujing Mandarin Oriental, here comes Mr. Xu‚Äôs review, I‚Äôve been waiting for a long time
Except for those in Shanghai and Hainan, all the Wenhua in the territory have the experience of staying
Mandarin Oriental is a hotel that you don't think is particularly brilliant overall, but it is full of details
Belonging is a kind of low-key luxury, which makes people feel very rich
Take a look at Wangfujing Mandarin Oriental from several aspects

Location: There is nothing to say about this location. It is just upstairs in Wangfu Central, and there are luxury stores downstairs to meet shopping needs. Next door is Wangfujing Pedestrian Street, where there are a lot of food and drink. And the scenic spots in that area can basically be reached on foot, such as Tiananmen Square, Jinyu Alley, etc. If you travel, the subway station is less than two or three minutes away from the hotel, and there is also a taxi in the downstairs lobby.

Landscape: I can say that the landscape of Beijing Wenhua is indeed more hard-core than the others, after all, you can see the Forbidden City. The restaurant can directly see the Forbidden City, and there is a terrace outside where you can take pictures, including some guest rooms. You can also see the Forbidden City. It is very OK to have such a view.

Room type: I chose a deluxe double bed room this time. It may be a fan fan or a black diamond from Ctrip. It was upgraded to a premium room. Although I didn‚Äôt understand, what is the difference between a luxury room and a premium bed? The picture is the bed of a premium room. There is an extra wooden frame around, and then my room can see a little bit of the Forbidden City, which is probably the difference. The room is square as a whole, and it doesn't look too gorgeous, but it feels like something. The bedroom part is not particularly big, but the bathroom is very big. What surprised me is that there is a dressing table. You know, many hotels have a dressing table or a cloakroom with a dressing table only if they have an executive-level room type. .

Service: Wenhua‚Äôs service has never been mentioned. I think there is no problem with the top three in the industry. What surprised me this time is that Ctrip called me to confirm the order information immediately after placing the order, because there is a free car in the package. The service of Universal Studios also confirmed the time with me immediately, this is really to like. The second is that from entering the hotel to leaving the store, the staff you meet will take the initiative to say hello. However, there is a slight fly in the oin**ent. When calling for room service, the surname + Mr. was not able to be reported. This can be improved a little. By the way, if you can still have dental floss.

Catering: After enjoying breakfast for two days, many people may think that the food and beverages of star-rated hotels are not bad, but in actual experience, Wenhua still makes more details, such as the freshness of the fruit, and this time I met red bayberry. , You must know that this is a relatively difficult fruit to handle. It takes a lot of courage for Wenhua to handle it well and display it. Staple foods like beef noodles are really yyds, and you have to order two bowls every time.

Price: The price of Beijing Wenhua is indeed very high, but since they have chosen star hotels, the cost performance category has already been put aside. For this price, I think it would be difficult to find another hotel in Beijing where you can see the Forbidden City after waking up.

Finally, I would like to thank Wangfujing Wenhua for preparing the panda and two room cards for me, so that I can take it back as a souvenir. I also thank the friends at the front desk for their warm service, including Quincy Wang and James Song. There is a pretty lady with a mushroom head, I didn't get your card! thank you!

The breakfast options are few, but the advantage is that it is quiet enough and you can have breakfast while looking at the Forbidden City. The location is super good, with many famous attractions right next to it, such as the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Wangfujing and so on. It was such a surprise, and the hotel also gave us Western food from Wudaofang Steakhouse, which was super delicious.

The most valuable thing about the room is the large floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Forbidden City, but the distance is a bit far. Fortunately, the weather was surprisingly sunny at that time, and the Forbidden City can be seen all day long, and the sunset is also very beautiful.
Next time I go back to the mainland, I will go again

I experienced the Mo Bar on the 5th floor of the hotel that night, and the little lion and sunset hunter hidden in the menu must be tried. Generally speaking, during this trip, I played during the day and had a good rest when I returned to the hotel at night. The whole itinerary felt very good.

Because the restricted vehicles could not reach the hotel entrance, the cold weather sent me across the shopping mall to the location of the car. The breakfast was semi-buffet, although there were not many varieties. , but all delicious.

The decoration and facilities of Mandarin Hotel are very good. The breakfast, Chinese food and Western food are all delicious, and the service staff are also very service conscious. This stay is a good experience.
I visited the hotel's terrace room (No. 10) is also very good, but the room can not see Beijing Tiananmen Square
The products used in the hotel's spa feel good, but the strength and techniques of the masseurs need to be improved

I am very impressed with the service of the hotel, the service staff cooperate tacitly, and they are a whole when facing customers. For example, we once called in the room to ask for a Band-Aid. When we checked out, the lady at the front desk would ask if it was bumped by the room facilities; the room on the day of check-in Before we were ready, we went to the restaurant to have dim sum first. When we finished signing the bill, the lady at the front desk appeared in good time and told us that the room was ready; because we added brown sugar rice cakes in the Chinese restaurant on the first day, and after placing the order the next day The chef made a double portion and sent it out personallyüòÇ

The characteristics and services of Wangfujing Wenhua are remarkable, overlooking the Forbidden City, the invincible terrace, and the bustling area. Quiet, the accommodation has a strong sense of privacy, and all the service staff will take the initiative to say hello, making people feel that the management is particularly good. The hotel asked personal needs in advance, helped to arrange balloons, prepared delicious desserts, arranged extra beds properly, and slept comfortably with children. I almost didn't book the swimming pool, and I was also taken care of by the hotel. I liked it manually. The Cantonese dim sum in the breakfast is authentic, and the made-to-order portion is very delicious. Wenhua Steak House was booked for dinner. The bread, oysters, steak, and wine were all excellent. It was quiet and sentimental, and the a**osphere was very good. The representative wines of MO Bar are really innovative, and the taste of the wine is also very good. I will try other wines next time. It is convenient to park and go to nearby attractions. It feels like the best choice for traveling from other places. The disadvantage is that the hotel facilities are not very parent-child, the room is too small, there is no children's pool, so children under 10 cannot swim, and the large terrace is required by the bartender that children must not be noisy (but I feel understandable) may be because the hardware is not perfect , I deeply feel that the hotel is really doing its best to provide services and meet the individual needs of the guests as much as possible. I really like the cultural brand.

Before I checked out, I asked the front desk staff what to do. The staff at the middle desk didn't say anything. On the left, a ******* who seemed to be in charge jumped out and asked if I wanted to leave. Room, our itinerary has not yet been decided and we are confused, but she said that if we check out, we will go to the next hotel staff to report it. It was too uncomfortable. She wanted to leave the matter without asking in detail. Do not speak. All the smiling services before were discounted by this waitress' shirk at the moment, and I was extremely disappointed. As a result, it was told by the security guard of the store next to it that it is enough to use the health care function to check the old and young, and we simply solved the problem. Later, the itinerary changed and the child wanted to go back to stay at Wenhua for one night, but considering the irresponsible attitude of the receptionist at the end, he gave up and chose another home. I hope that the staff member will think differently. When the customer really encounters a problem, you can ask a few more questions and find a way to help solve it. After all, when I asked you, you still have not checked out and you are still your customer. The way you push it is too chilling. .

The welcome card has a sense of ceremonial fire lacquer printing, the quality of the fruit desserts delivered to the room, the Tiptik 70ml large bottle and the room layout details are all luxury hotels. Level, the gimmick premium is relatively enough, you can see the scenery of the Forbidden City a little farther

The location of the hotel is very good, backed by Wangfujing, facing the Forbidden City, with a unique landscape and a wide view. The courtesy of staying in is very ceremonial. The Lingling who received us was warm and courteous, and patiently introduced the facilities of the room to the two elderly people, which made the family very satisfied. It is definitely a luxury hotel worth experiencing in the imperial capital!

msg:The environment of the hotel is really good
In particular, there is a large platform with a far-reaching view of the Forbidden City. Restaurants and bars have borrowed this light and are very popular.
In fact, let me say something weakly, I recently went to Puxuan for two days, and found that there is an unobstructed view of Jingshan in the distance, and the view is so good that it explodes!
Room facilities are very online, after all, very new
Ordinary rooms are medium in size, and the Ctrip booking page says that free extra beds are not available at first.
The reason is that there is a large passenger flow during the holidays, and it is based on the principle of first-order, first-served. The front desk said it for granted, as if it was a reasonable thing to show that the reception capacity was limited.
At the same time, it is a fact that I could not check in at the agreed check-in time. I waited in the cafe for nearly an hour, and made up for it afterwards - a bottle of red wine with an average price of less than 100 was exchanged for an hour's loss. If you feel satisfied, please deduct 1 .
I don't want to say more about extra beds, because there are fewer and fewer good hotels at home and abroad that can provide free extra beds for children under 5 years old. This time, the Rosewood suite allowed a free extra bed, and only gave a bed with a width of less than 80. In the middle of the night, I picked up children everywhere. Compared with Wenhua, there is a guardrail and I don't complain much.
Breakfast and dinner are all in the hotel. I have eaten those dishes several times for dinner. There are few choices. We should make some changes according to the season. If there is a restaurant next to the bar, if you want to order a wine from the bar, you need to walk over and order it. Okay, check out, take a drink from the restaurant, it really doesn't look like a five-star hotel. This is a service issue.
Because the breakfast was semi-buffet, the wrong dishes were served, so there must have been guests who were waiting in a hurry, and some guests ate the meal ordered by others.
The swimming pool gym is a reservation system. It can be used in advance and it is basically a private room. This is quite satisfactory.
In short, the grand style of Mandarin is there, but the price/performance ratio of the two in Hong Kong and Las Vegas is worse.

msg:The world's luxury hotel brand, Forbes double five-star hotel, super service and hardware supporting, undoubtedly, it is definitely the best hotel in Beijing! The hotel is designed by the American HBA design firm
Location: The location is very good, located in Wangfujing, adjacent to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, Jinbao Street, it can be said to be the core of Beijing. The hotel is located in the central ring of the palace. It is very small, but very exquisite. It feels like you suddenly walked into a quiet paradise in a crowded place. There is a feeling of tranquility in the chaos.
Environment: Although the hotel is small, it is very quiet and very private. You must swipe your room card in the corridors of the rooms to enter, especially the gym.
Service: This is the luxury hotel with the best service I have ever stayed in. Butler service. After check-in, someone will send you to the room. When you ask for something at the room call service center, it will be delivered soon! Because I forgot to bring my ID when I came, the hotel will send someone to take me to the local police station to issue a certificate, thank you very much! Today, the room will receive a handwritten welcome letter, but it‚Äôs in English, I can‚Äôt understand üòÖ Welcome fruits, snacks, and a pear tea. The concierge still remembers the guest's name. The staff is warm and polite.
Room: The room is small, but not crowded. The facilities of the room are good. The Samsung TV is equipped with Bose TV speakers. There are also Bose Bluetooth speakers by the bed. The mattress and pillows are very comfortable, but the linen feels a bit inferior. , The body feel is not very good, a bit hard, not as good as Ritz-Carlton and Waldorf. The room separates the bathroom from the bathroom, and the bathroom is equipped with a toto smart toilet, which is very detailed. The disadvantage is that there is no TV in the bathroom in the basic room, and the usable space in the bathroom is very large. The wash basin with double basins and the marble decoration in the bathroom are really beautiful. The toothpaste is also imported high-quality goods. The room is not equipped with mouthwash. And the razor, and later asked to call to send it. The bathroom is also equipped with Dyson's hair dryer. The mouthwash sent is Listerine from the United States. The bath products are made of high-end products, and the French tiptic, but it is a large bottle on the wall! ! This feels very cheap! Makes me suspect that this is a bathing center. . . I feel that this is not a shortcoming that Mandarin Oriental should have! The free drink in the room is very generous, no less than 10 capsule coffee, the capsule coffee here is different from the capsule coffee in other luxury hotels, it is more advanced, and it is also equipped with many jing tea bags. The capsule coffee machine looks very good. Expensive, I don‚Äôt know what brand it is. The mini bar is equipped with a lot of options, but they are all charged. The price is similar to other luxury hotels. The head of the bed is equipped with a wireless charger and a smart switch. The Forbidden City can be seen from the room. The water provided is the world's top mineral water-Sweden's NORDAQ
Design: The design is done by the American HBA design firm, which combines modern and Chinese elements. However, the hotel's most attractive design is not the decoration, but the privacy and layout of the hotel! The long progressive corridors are eye-catching.
Gym: Although the gym is small, it is the comfort and privacy of the guests. It is only open to the guests. Therefore, you must swipe the room card to enter, which guarantees the privacy of the guests! There are not many equipment, but the equipment used is Technogym from Italy, which is very easy to use! The gym prepares Swedish nordaq water, coffee machine, capsule coffee, and warm direct drinking water for guests. And the gym service is great! For example, take the initiative to open the door for guests, it is not convenient to see me open the mineral water, take the initiative to open the door for me, etc.
Breakfast: Breakfast is served in the Zishan restaurant on the 5th floor. I chose to dine on the outdoor terrace. It is semi-buffet and tastes good. The breakfast service is also very good with delicious eggs Benedict. In addition, Zishan Restaurant is also a restaurant recommended by the Michelin Guide.
All in all, the experience of this hotel is very good. I think only this Mandarin Oriental hotel will give guests a unique sense of dignity! In addition, it is said that the fish lamp in the hotel lobby is worth tens of millions.

The price is firm all the year round, it makes sense, the reputation is so big, the service standard is always online, and the price is worthy, I give 4.9-5 points. The following are the bone picks in the egg, which can be completely ignored: 1. The room is slightly smaller and the swimming pool is slightly smaller; 2. The water pressure in the shower is not enough, and it is not pleasant enough. I don‚Äôt know if this can be improved. 3. It would be better if there is tea. Impression In the Beijing Park Hyatt suite, tea was given; 4. The teapot was too big, and the boiling water was gone as soon as it was poured in.

msg:Basically all very good. Service especially praised. Among the five star hotels I have stayed in, the service is the best. The service staff have strong understanding and strong action, including the service staff in every link, even the cleaning staff are very strong. awesome. In the remarks, it was written that an extra bed was needed. When I checked in, the bed was already set up. Will choose to stay next time.
Let me mention three shortcomings, mainly related to facilities, I hope to improve: 1. Pillow, one is too soft and the other is too hard. Compared with pillows in other hotels, it is slightly less comfortable. 2. The design of the faucet pays too much attention to novelty and ignores the practicality. The faucet is too thin and straight, the lever is difficult to find the force point in mechanics, and the hand feel is not soft. Once the faucet was turned off, the hand was clamped. 3. In the kettle, I couldn't find a button to stop the heating. I didn't want to boil the water completely, so I had to pull out the plug forcibly. Compared with the kettles of other hotels, the ease of use is deviated.
One more thing, the breakfast is not very good. As a result, they have lost interest in going to restaurants for Chinese food and dinner. Later, I was too lazy to go out to the restaurant for lunch, which was actually okay. It felt like the restaurant was dragged down by breakfast expectations. Hope to improve.

Hidden on the fifth and sixth floors of the Central Plaza, the service and details are perfect. They also provide us with birthday desserts and red wine balloons to add to the fun. The desserts are really delicious. They are so delicious. , When we came back in the evening and was taken away, I really can't forget it! At noon, it was lunch at Zishan. There were not many people and the scenery was truly invincible. The Forbidden City was not far away. The three of them blindly ordered 5-6 dishes, each of which was delicious and praised! The price is worthy of the word delicious! The next day I woke up and used the gym and visited the swimming pool. The place is not big, but I have everything you need. Drinking water and moon cake snacks are available everywhere. It feels like at home. The breakfast is presented in a combination of order and buffet. It is in the place of Zishan. You want to taste everything. It should be a model of breakfast with few varieties but first-class quality. I think as long as it has enough pockets, Mandarin Oriental Beijing must be the best choice for staying in Beijing!

The hotel entrance is ok, and the welcoming guests are very enthusiastic to help with luggage from the car door. The lobby of the hotel is slightly small, and the front desk is very nice for check-in. I also upgraded the room for free, which was unexpected. Thank you very much.
The room is not too big, the toilet and the shower bathtub are separated very well! The rooms are Chinese style, with elements of the Forbidden City, kettle and tea, and many Villeroy & Boch tea cups and coffee cups are very delicate.
A few days after staying in, I feel: all services are very detail-oriented, and the sanitation is very good. For example, I like to spread a bath towel on the makeup stool, and they will help me to lay a new one, which is very economical and environmentally friendly. The spirit agrees very much. The bathtub is also cleaned every day, and the drinking water is provided daily enough to make tea. An appoin**ent is required for swimming, for 2 people at a time. The service was also very attentive. I saw that my slippers were a little tight, so I immediately took the initiative to change the size of the slippers to me.
The most touching thing is that on June 22, the hotel helped us decorate the room and presented cakes, snacks, fruits and drinks, which left a good birthday impression for the children.
The breakfast is semi-buffet. You can choose from Western and Cantonese styles. There are many varieties of fruits. The freshly cooked pasta tastes good, and the quality of salmon, yogurt, and salad are good. The most important thing is the Forbidden City view.
Thanks to the front office operations director, handsome Shanghai guy, and thank guest relations MOWFJ for all the meticulously prepared everything for us!
Mandarin Oriental loved it!

From the room you can see the Forbidden City, the national flag, and the Monument to the People's Heroes. The breakfast is semi-buffet, ordered according to the menu. After eating for three days in a row, I was a bit tired of eating, this is no way. The hardware and software are not picky, and the toiletries and water to drink are all top-notch. Next time I come to Beijing, I will still choose this hotel and recommend friends to stay in this hotel.

The facade of the hotel is small, not easy to find, nor stylish, the rooms are not big, and the furnishings are modest. The desserts delivered on the first day are not cleaned until the fifth day when they check out. They are kept on the table (there is no move on the next day). pass). The gym is very small and the swimming pool is very small. Reservations are required. Children under ten cannot use the swimming pool. No evaluation will be made if there is no meal in the hotel. It takes about half an hour to take the children to the Tiananmen Forbidden City on foot. The distance is quite awkward. The only thing that makes me feel good is that the service is very good, the front desk is full of smiles and welcoming people, there are questions and answers, and it is very friendly to children. In short, the hotel is not cost-effective, and will not choose the second time.
