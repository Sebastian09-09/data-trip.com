Front desk told me the cable car is closed due to maintenance but is not! Luckily we go to the ticket counter and ask. 
We got discount for ticket to chang cheng when we show our room card, this is also not mentioned in our stay. 
However room is clean and nice, exactly same as advertised.
Overall a nice stay for one night vacation.

msg:There are two top tier hotels in Wtown. One is located slightly outside the town and Beijing Wtown Resort is located inside the town. The outer one is more convenient to drop off luggage as can park directly in front whereas BWTR requires checkin first at the general area at the gate. Would suggest for big groups or wheelchair accessible guests to consider the former. At the general check in area, they can transport your luggage into the town to your hotel  via a porter service.

However once you get inside the town, BWTR is fantastic in terms of location as it is central to everything. There is a public onsen right next door with an option to book a private room onsen (can share as a couple or family) with day or illuminated night views looking at the Jinshanling Great Wall!

The BWTR itself is a nice hotel. Lots of rooms, tidy and great breakfast buffet. The two bedroom suite is great for families.

Luggage services at the tourist center was very helpful and was a great perk considering the terrain of the area.

msg:Gubei water town review for non locals 
There are not many reviews for foreigners and I hope this helps. 

Location
Getting there: we took a Didi ride from Beijing airport which was about 1.5 hours. Had to alight at the car park area outside the water town. There was a shuttle to send you to the visitor and hotel registration center. The luggage could be forwarded to your hotel from the car park area but you will need a local number to do so. After registration, we then had to take another shuttle to the hotel which was located quite a distance inside the water town. The Simatai Great Wall entrance and visitor center to buy tickets was just a 5 min stroll away. 

Alternatives 
There was the main water town hotel near the car park area and  many smaller home stays and inns. 

Amenities 
Heated indoor pool, gym, chess rooms (which were locked), on site restaurant, a number of beautiful seating areas 
Hot spring (onsen) which is free for guests to book on wechat mini program. It is located about 5min walk from the hotel. There is a convoluted indoor walkway or a shorter but outdoors walk.
There are restaurants in the town as well and street food. However, a number were not functioning as it was the tail end of winter. 

Rooms
Very beautifully designed. You have to see to believe. Nespresso machine, dual sinks, daily fresh fruits and water. The tap water is safe to drink as the resort by the way. 

Package
We had a winter package which came with breakfast, hot springs access and one set meal. 
The meals were very good - both the breakfast and dinner which we had. 

Simatai wall
There is a night time access. Cannot climb up but have to take the cable car both ways. You will see station 5/6 only. Main thing is to view the beautiful wall lighted up. 
There is also a daytime access. You can choose to walk up to station 2 (about 30min) or to take the cable car up and down. 
The daytime access allows you to walk from station 2-10. There were some challenging sections but it was totally worth it. 

Overall this was a great hotel to stay at to see the wall.

Park your car in the No. 1 parking lot, check in your luggage at the parking lot gate, and then take the shuttle bus to the service center to go through the park entry procedures, and finally take the shuttle in the park to the hotel, and get the room card directly at the front desk. The hotel hardware is pretty good, the room area is not large and the layout is reasonable, with two wash basins.
The disadvantage is that the front desk training should be strengthened, the room is not equipped with toiletries, and the front desk did not remind us when checking in. In addition, the room brought two hot spring tickets every night without telling us.

This time I brought the whole family to play together, the elderly and children had their own fun, and I will come again next time.

Because my parents are old and wanted to live in one room for easy care, I looked at many hotels and felt that the family room of Gubei Light Hotel was the most suitable, so I chose this one. . On the way here, the hotel service staff, Manager Tong, called in advance to inform us of the check-in process and told us that if we need anything, just contact him in time. Really thoughtful. When we arrived at the hotel, Manager Tong was waiting for us in the hotel lobby, arranged a room for us, took us there, and introduced us to some things about the water town. He was warm and thoughtful. The hotel is very close to Riyue Island. It is very convenient for watching shows and traveling. The breakfast in the hotel is also good. It is much better than the farm food we eat outside, so we chose to have our meal at the hotel the next day. Eat at a Chinese restaurant. The hotel's swimming pool is very clean and beautiful. The hotel's Chengshang Hot Spring Pavilion has a separate bath for women. It feels very respectful to women. My mother and I like this setting very much.

I enjoyed my vacation this time. If I have the chance to go there again next time, I would probably choose Gubei Light again.

Fortunately, Butler Zhao was very responsible and changed the room immediately. On the second night, the family next door chatted until 1 o'clock. This cannot be said to be true. The main problem is that the sound insulation is not good. I have never stayed in a hotel with such poor sound insulation. At least the family duplex room is not soundproof. If you have poor sleep quality, be careful about this duplex room.

Service: The service is very good. In addition to the responsible housekeeper, the cleaning lady and the lobby manager are very considerate.


Facilities: The swimming pool is very clean and the room facilities are relatively new. The location of the hotel is very good. There is a food street 50 meters from the door and Wangjing Street across the street. There is a shuttle bus at the door at any time.

The other thing is that the hot spring coupon is more convenient, and the breakfast buffet is a bit limited.

From the time we entered the ancient town until we checked out, if we had any difficulties or questions, we would respond within seconds. It added a lot of convenience to our trip. All in all, I was very satisfied with this trip.

The hotel also helped me adjust the monitoring and communicated with the scenic spot to help me find it! In addition, there are quite a lot of soup pools. You can soak in many pools. There are fewer people there in the morning. The swimming pool has a heated pool, which is very friendly to children~

Check-in: As soon as I entered the hotel, I felt the warm and thoughtful welcome service.
Guest room: The hygiene and service of the guest room are very thoughtful. The housekeeper Manager Tong's service is meticulous and provides us with a good guide arrangement.
On the first night of stay, we experienced the hotel's beer garden. The temperature is suitable and the a**osphere is harmonious. This is a pure Western-style beer garden. Sitting here, you can see the drone show at night. In short, everything is beautiful...
Finally, thank you Sister Rong for your careful arrangements, which make us feel at home every time we come. Choosing the Light Hotel is the best choice. Children like it, parents like it. Thanks again to every staff here. Thank you for your hard work on May 1st Labor Day.

It is very close to every attraction and is the most convenient hotel. The breakfast is rich in variety and tastes very good. My family said it was the best breakfast among all the hotels we have stayed in. There are also waffles and egg tarts that children like. They are all freshly made and baked. After booking the hotel, Manager Tong contacted us in time to inform us of the performance time and how to get to each attraction. He was very considerate and provided great help in arranging our itinerary. If you come to Gubei Water Town for accommodation, I strongly recommend this hotel👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

The hotel is relatively large and has many rooms, but it is very quiet inside. In time for the May Day holiday, the price is much more expensive than usual. However, the room rate includes a package, which includes tickets to scenic spots, hot springs, tickets to the Great Wall, and a foot massage. Overall, the price/performance ratio is good.
The service is really like the experience of a star hotel, and a butler service is arranged. I feel very happy about this. I can arrange the itinerary in advance and have a considerate person who reminds me all the time. Special thanks to my butler Tie Hammer😊

The hotel is an old hotel in the ancient town. It has a very famous swimming pool, a very good environment, and good hygiene, but the details need to be improved: each room lacks a footstool for children to wash their hands, and there is no toilet. When there are many people, the service attitude of the breakfast chef is a bit perfunctory. Do you think you are polite to complain about the guests in front of them? These small details, I think the hotel management needs to pay more attention to.

The free hot spring is very good, and it is awesome to watch the light show outdoors

Overall, I still recommend Gubei Light Hotel

And the drone show can be seen in the sky by the window of the room (room number 6030). Manager Tong also guided the way to parking + shuttle bus 1 + exchange for scenic spot tickets to enter the scenic spot + shuttle bus 2 + check-in one-stop service, which is very considerate and warm. It is worth bringing the elderly and children to play.

I scanned the code to add a little assistant, but he ignored the hot springs and did not respond until I checked out (see picture). From check-in, booking hot springs, shuttle buses, and luggage check-in, I had to ask, understand, and worry about everything by myself. I did not feel the butler service at all. I was confused for the first time and missed some project arrangements.
During the stay, I reported some problems through Ctrip customer service. Ctrip said that the hotel would call me to explain, but it did not.

msg:Considering that there are both old and young members, we chose to stay at the "Gubei Light" Hotel.
① Location: There is a shuttle bus stop at the entrance of the hotel, which is convenient for taking the bus.
Located in the middle of the ancient town, it is convenient for traveling and coming back to rest.
Next door is Chengshang Hot Spring, which is close to Wangjing Street and Sun Moon Island, and convenient for watching shows.
② Facilities: Good hygiene; two beds can be put together for the convenience of taking care of children; there is capsule coffee in the room; rich breakfast; the hotel has its own infinity pool. ③ Service: Manager Zhao Hui in the lobby called in advance, upgraded the room, and arranged for the child to install a bed guard. Coordinated a room that can be occupied at 12 o'clock, so that the old and the young can rest first. Another room was also arranged at 1 o'clock. Added WeChat to help me answer questions and solve doubts, and finally arranged to send back the items that my family forgot.
About the swimming pool of Gubei Light Hotel: a large infinity pool + four small pools. The big pool is 1.2m deep and the water is slightly cool; the two round pools are empty; the two square warm water pools are shallower, and the specific heights are not found, but: Square Pool 1: I stand up to my navel at 159cm, Square Pool 2: My son stands up to his navel at 91cm, for reference.
Swimming rings can be rented for 38 yuan.
You need to bring a swimming cap (swimming suits and swimming caps are sold), towels are prepared by the swimming pool, but you can't bring them to the room.
Although my son is only two and a half years old, the front desk of the swimming pool said that boys cannot be taken to the women's locker room, but they can help take the child in. We both put on our swimsuits in the room, so we didn't go to the locker room and took them off directly.
There are many types of breakfast, and the service is generally good.

The hotel lobby is comfortable and elegant, and friends are very happy to relax and chat here. The room is spacious and quaint, with free welcome fruits and a very comfortable sleep. The hotel is located in the essence of Gubei Water Town. It is only about 10 minutes' walk from Simatai Great Wall and Riyue Island Square to enjoy the drone show and water dance show, which is very convenient.

The hot spring is just average. The second floor is for ladies only. There is a small round pool with a small slide in the middle, which is suitable for taking little babies to play. There are indoor and outdoor areas on the third floor. There is a strong smell of disinfectant in the house, but it is better outdoors. There are free water dispensers and paid beverage and hamburger areas. The appoin**ent was corrected after 8 o'clock to catch up with the drone show.

msg:The hotel check-in experience of Shuizhen is very good, the process is clear and the service is in place. The room was reserved in advance and there were welcome fruits every night, which made it feel warm. The housekeeping is very good and the attitude is very good. The room size is not large, but the design is reasonable, the space partitions are user-friendly, and the luggage placement, sofa relaxation, and parent-child separation are all done well. I tried the capsule coffee machine and it was pretty good. The hotel is very suitable for customers who like to soak in hot springs. The hotel's exclusive hot spring pavilion is right next door. There are many types of breakfast, but the quality can be improved. Great experience at Simatai Great Wall!

msg:The room was large and the facilities were pretty good, but it was a bit noisy. I was given a free hot spring ticket. When I checked in at noon that day, I couldn't make a reservation, especially for female guests. There is a warm water pool, which is very suitable for children, but the female guests still don’t have cabinets. I don’t understand. After entering, I found that there were not so many people. However, the location of the hotel is very good. When you go out, you can see Riyue Island Square. There were many performances, and I also experienced an Eight Flags fire banquet. The drone Kongming Lantern performance at night was great!

The very bad experience was in the swimming pool area of ​​the hotel. The waiter was impatient in answering questions. When renting a swimming ring, he repeatedly reminded me that he had not paid yet. When he returned to the room with a bath towel, he had to ask for the bath towel to be sent back. This kind of request is really unheard of.
Check-in has to be at 3 pm, check-out is at 12 pm the next day, no late check-out is allowed, and there is nothing much to do. Several guests complained about this when checking in, which really made them feel bad.

Just a few steps away from the hotel is the Sun Moon Square in the center of the water town. You can have a leisurely meal in the evening and watch the Kongming Lantern show. The swimming pool is large and the water quality is good. If you are afraid of the cold, you can go ashore and soak in the small hot spring pool next to it. It is easy to walk the baby. In addition, the service experience was very good. Our luggage was checked all the way. The lady at the front desk was enthusiastic and attentive. We asked our needs and arranged bed guards and children's slippers.

He contacted me from early in the morning to inquire about my needs. The service was excellent! Gubei Light has large rooms and many facilities. I really can’t get enough of it. Swimming, ocean ball, table tennis, and hot springs are all arranged! The hotel is close to the Simatai Great Wall, which is so fun. It would be better if the hotel itself could clearly mark various small facilities for travelers. For example, there are hot spring clothes in the room for free, and you can go to the hot spring through the corridor. It would be better to put a small mark in the room, otherwise it will be a bit confusing for the first time~~ I hope the hotel will get better and better! Will definitely come back next time!

Facilities: slightly older
Health: good
Environment: good, quiet, with a sense of design
good service
When checking in at the service center, please note that the water town tickets and hot spring experience provided by the hotel are only for two people. If your child is over 1.3 years old, you need to buy separate tickets and hot spring experience coupons. The person at the service center told me to tell her where to go. Just buy the ticket and pay for it at the hot spring. In this case, it is 80+150; but if you buy it on the mini program, the price of buying a hot spring ticket and getting a water town ticket is 150. She didn't tell me. However, after complaining at the hotel front desk, the girl at the front desk helped me register, and I paid another 70 when I went to the hot spring. In fact, it only cost 150.
The overall ice and snow projects this year are twice as expensive as last year. The ice slide was RMB 30 last year and RMB 60 this year. It is too expensive and may discourage tourists. Think twice.
Unlimited shuttle bus to Gubei Water Town Scenic Area: I have always felt that the shuttle bus in Gubei is very good, especially in winter, it is particularly friendly.

msg:1. Geographical location: Gubei Water Town is about 130 kilometers away from the urban area, and the drive takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes. It is a good choice for short-distance travel with children in winter.
2. Travel time: I have been there many times, and a one-day round trip is quite stressful, so two days and one night is the best choice.
3. Check-in recommendation: Gubei Light Hot Spring Resort Hotel is located in the most central location in the park. It is very close to various attractions in the park. It is very suitable for families with children. The service is very good. All staff will smile and say hello when they meet. The hotel provides butler-style service. , with the baby, they also specially helped us move to a location closer to the door, and upgraded the room for free. I would like to express my gratitude to the hotel for providing professional and humane service; the breakfast buffet has a rich variety, and although there are many guests, the hot dishes are all handmade. There is basically no queue at the entrance, which is very good. The overall check-in experience is very good👍. I highly recommend staying here.
4. Park tour: There are various performances in the park, which can be watched according to the time; with children, you can choose various ice sports, visit handicraft shops, and there are many places to eat when you are tired, including various snacks or in-hotel restaurants. Yes, you can take a night tour of the Great Wall at night, or go to the cafe on the top of the church to overlook the night view of the entire Gubei Water Town, which is super beautiful. Finally, you can take a hot spring bath, which is very nice👍
5. Summary: What we bought is a package ticket, and the reservation comes with water town tickets, breakfast and hot springs. From the moment we arrive, the park provides free luggage check-in and shuttle buses🚗. All links are smoothly connected and very convenient; the overall experience is very good. This time It’s also snowing, and the Water Town Park is even more beautiful in the snow😄. It’s the first choice for short-distance family fun in winter, and I’ll come back again.

The water in the swimming pool is very clean, and the water temperature of the soup pool is 41°C. The swimsuits and swimming caps inside are not cheap. Overall, they are very good. The breakfast is quite rich, and the coffee and drinks are also quite complete. Various snacks, including wonton buns. Yes, there are both Chinese and Western options, and it’s also very close to the Simatai Great Wall. You can take the cable car or hike up there within a few minutes of walking from the hotel. The only thing I feel is that it’s a bit steep above the 5th floor. Overall, it’s worth it!

When I visited Gubei Water Town for the second time, I chose the Gubei Light Hotel, which has an excellent location. The rooms are clean and tidy, and the room layout is reasonable. The outdoor recreational facilities are especially suitable for parents and children. The tall infinity swimming pool is a plus point of the hotel. What impressed me most was the hotel lobby manager Wang Qing (screen name: Wang Dachui) who received us. His service was attentive and considerate for customers, and his words and demeanor made people feel like spring breeze. Next time I come to Shuizhen, I will choose Gubei Light because of the king’s love👍👍👍

Xiao Zhao is the exclusive butler who stays during this trip. Many things can be handled by someone at the first time. It is also on par with most star-rated hotels in China.

msg:Environment: The location is the busiest place in the scenic spot. The shuttle bus goes directly to the hotel entrance. It is very convenient especially with children. I stayed on the 6th floor this time. You can see a slight view of the Great Wall outside the window, but if you go inside It should be more obvious if you live there.

Hygiene: The room is very clean, but it is a star hotel. There is no smoke smell when entering the room🚬, which is very satisfactory for parents with children.

Service: On the day of check-in, the lobby service staff will call to confirm, and there will be someone to receive you when you enter the hotel. If you have any needs, you can contact the designated corresponding window. The person who received us this time was "Manager Tong", who received us very warmly. I feel grateful!

Facilities: There is an infinity swimming pool, children's playroom, etc. in the hotel, but of course we arrived at the hotel late, so we only took the children to play in the playroom, but I thought it was pretty good and there were no people. It might be the off-season...🤣

▪️Summary: This stay experience was great! I bought a package itinerary, but I didn’t have time to soak in the hot springs♨️It’s a pity. Next time I go to Gubei Water Town, Gubei Light will probably be my first choice!
PS. By the way, I must recommend their breakfast. It should be the most appetizing among the hotels. As we are used to eating Western food, we especially like parini, it’s delicious😋 There aren’t many breakfast options, but I feel it’s thoughtful 👍

But, this hotel really exceeded my expectations, and the quality far exceeded the price of more than 1,300 yuan. The infinity swimming pool is really comfortable, maybe it will be even better in summer. The house is clean and hygienic inside.
The breakfast is rich and delicious, and it feels like the best value for money among water town hotels. Will come again next time. Watching the drone show at the entrance of the lobby is also very good. The only drawback is that the lobby smells like a swimming pool, and the temperature in the room is always around 23-24 degrees and cannot be raised. Maybe it’s because the central air conditioner can’t operate, but the flaws are not hidden, I’m really satisfied👍

This time we are traveling with my mother and we have booked a deluxe family room in Gubei Light. It is very cost-effective for a Sunday trip. The room facilities are complete, with a 2-meter large bed + two 1.2-meter single beds. It will not be crowded if you accommodate four adults and one child. Moreover, the two rooms are separated so that they do not disturb each other. With 4 free tickets and 4+1 breakfast, you can have a comfortable two days in Gubei. I would especially like to thank the lobby manager Zhao Hui for contacting me in advance, sending me Gubei travel suggestions during the show time, and handling late check-out. She answered all my questions and the service was super nice. Thank you so much! The autumn scenery in Gubei is simply beautiful every step of the way. I highly recommend coming to Gubei and staying at Gubei Light!

So I chose this hotel without hesitation this time. This time we are a family of five. We booked a deluxe family room, and the environment and facilities are still great! very quiet! The only drawback is that the breakfast is not as diverse as last year. There is only one coffee machine in the restaurant, and everyone needs to queue up to get coffee (coffee can only choose espresso and freshly ground coffee). This time I finally used the hot spring ticket given by the hotel, which made up for the regret of not taking a hot spring bath last time😀 That’s right! The night view of Gubei in the hotel is so beautiful
I didn’t take photos of the hotel this time, so I’ll use the ones from a year ago! The night view is from this year😂

You can see the night view of the Simatai Great Wall, which is a different experience (the hot spring needs to be used when there are many tourists) Make a reservation on the official account of "Gubei Water Town Service"). After soaking in the hot springs, you can watch the Great Wall light show.
The next day, take the 12:00 tourist bus from Gubei Water Town towards Dongzhimen (you need to prepare cash, no change is required)
Generally speaking, if you like a slow life, vacation is a good choice.

She also provided various considerate voice guidance and answered questions in the evening. To enter Gubei Light, you need to ferry from Parking Lot 1 to the Visitor Service Center, and then ferry back up. Luggage can be brought directly from the parking lot. It is said to take one and a half hours, but it actually arrives in half an hour. Gubei Light is in the park, very close to the Chengshang Hot Spring, and you can directly see the Simatai Great Wall. The swimming pool in the hotel is also free if you don’t want to go out, and there are two small hot spring pools next to it. It would be so comfortable to come back and take a dip in the cold winter night and go home to sleep. The buffet breakfast is very rich, including Chinese and Western styles, and the place is large with plenty of seats.
The duplex family room has a double bed and two single beds. Although there is no bathtub, the four-person washbasin and shower plus the swimming pool downstairs are comfortable enough. There are fruits in the room, a Nescafe capsule coffee machine, and the nut-flavored American style is very fragrant.
There is a shuttle bus directly, and a little further down you will find the town, the dock, the place selling Qiaotou cakes, and the food street, which is very close to Wangjing Tower. The scenery in Gubei is still beautiful, but it’s a bit cold in winter. We have to make arrangements next time. One day is not enough, so arrange a few more days.

 1 Area: It is actually larger than it looks in the Ctrip pictures, and it is also very spacious. It is completely stress-free for three people to live there, so feel free to book.
2 Room temperature: Although it is only October, the hotel has already started to heat the air. When you enter the room, you will feel very warm. We open the windows every day to keep the indoor temperature at 24°-26°. It is absolutely as warm as spring in winter.
3 facilities: refrigerator, safe, capsule coffee machine, scale, moisturizer, welcome fruit, all available.

Second breakfast:
       The restaurant is large and can accommodate many people for dining. It has a full range of Western and Chinese dishes, including noodles, panini, cheese, fried dough sticks...all available.
Three swimming pools:
         The infinity swimming pool is 1.2-1.4 meters deep and has a temperature of 28°-30°. It has no swimming lanes and is very suitable for swimming and playing. There are not many people. There are also 3 hot water pools around it, which is also good for bathing. It would be perfect if the locker room could add a drying bucket.
Four others in the hotel:
        The accommodation provides a 70 yuan snooker coupon. You can play for one hour by paying 30 yuan. In addition, there are coupons for table tennis and chess and card rooms.
Five trips:
        The location of the hotel is quite good. It's close to everything. It also provides a free 24-hour shuttle bus service. The service staff can help call for a bus and the bus comes very quickly. Guests can also use facial recognition and have unlimited access to the scenic spot by 18:00 on the check-out date. This is very important!
Six special thanks to:
       Our service butler is Manager Tong. On the way out, we received a call from Manager Tong in advance, telling us where to park conveniently, where electric cars can be charged, and reminding us to make reservations for hot springs in advance. After arriving at the hotel, Manager Tong took us to the best location to watch the Kongming Lantern and drone performances. He also helped us schedule vehicles and coordinate the timing of the entertainment room for our evening trip. When we left, we left something in the room, and he responded to the message instantly to help us take out the things and store them in the lobby on the first floor. Having him there made our stay feel particularly peaceful and relaxing. In the morning, when the child saw the bronze statue sitting on the phone in the ancient town (picture below), he immediately said: "Isn't this Manager Tong? Hello Manager Tong!"😁😁😁

The communication was very smooth and all the requirements were met. You can see the drone show in the hotel room, and you are given breakfast coupons and hot spring tickets. The breakfast is very rich and meets the needs of the whole family. It is suitable for a two-and-a-half-year-old baby. On the day of the hot spring, you can only make an appoin**ent at Yuda, and the hot spring is average. The shuttle bus and checked baggage service are so convenient, families with children love it!

The second floor is for ladies only, and the third floor is for mixed bathing. From the hot spring outside, you can see the Simatai Great Wall and a little drone show. You can make a reservation through the Gubei Water Town official account before checking into the hotel. I took my parents with me to play for a whole night, and it was very refreshing to take a dip!
😀Gubei Water Town tickets for three people: You can apply for it at the tourist service center with your ID card.

👍Service: I received a call from the lobby manager at about ten o'clock, and then contacted us through WeChat to remotely assist us in entering Gubei Water Town. The manager lady Wang Qing (slang for Tianjin people) received her patiently and arranged the room in advance for us to check in and rest!

Whether you are watching a show on Riyue Island or the Great Wall Water Dance Show, it is only a few minutes away. This time I took advantage of the Gubei Red Leaf Festival, and I still chose this place. When we checked in at the front desk, we booked through Ctrip and there was a dedicated butler. Ours this time was a beautiful woman named Su Ziqi, who thoughtfully helped us pick up our luggage and delivered it to the room. And before check-out, they also helped to delay check-out for half an hour. Very considerate!
The hotel has an infinity swimming pool, but I didn’t go for a swim this time because of the tight schedule, which was a bit of a pity. I should stay a few more days in the future.

msg:When I visited Water Town in September, I happened to catch up with the drone for maintenance and did not see the performance. It happened that the leaves in Water Town turned red in mid-October, so I came to Water Town again. Because of the wonderful experience I had last time, I chose Gubei Light for this stay. The hotel also lived up to my trust and treated me like an old friend, which made me feel how cherished my guests are once again. My two stays within thirty days and the repeat customer tag next to my nickname are the best recognition and proof.

The room decoration and facilities are in line with the promotional pictures, and the service provided by Shuizhenjing Winery is as good as ever. I have said it before and I won’t mention it again.

Special thanks to Su Ziqi, the lobby manager of the hotel. On the morning when I checked into the hotel, he personally made a pre-check-in phone call to confirm my arrival time and preferences. When I checked in in the afternoon, he also personally greeted me and helped me deliver my luggage to the room. All the needs I raised during my stay at the hotel were met with her coordination and help. The next morning, they took the initiative to remind me about the breakfast time, and the service details were full. Her service was considerate and professional throughout the entire process, making me feel relaxed and satisfied; making me enjoy my stay; and making my trip to the water town to enjoy the red leaves even more perfect.

Finally, I would like to add two points: First, the room type I booked was just an ordinary standard room, and the hotel's service made me feel treated equally. Second, the hotel was fully booked on the day I checked in and when I checked out the next day. So I highly recommend this hotel, needless to say more.

We expressed the hope that we can arrange a room that is closer to us. Manager Tong also arranged it. The location is very good and convenient. After we checked in at the service center, the manager also waited for us in the hotel lobby in advance and took the room card and sent us to the room. If we have any questions, we can do it.

Check your luggage directly in the parking lot, take the shuttle bus to the transfer station to check in and exchange tickets, and then you can start playing. This time I checked in with my friends.

msg:Last year I checked in for the first time. I booked the cheapest standard room. After I checked in, the outside of the window was blocked. I was told that the cheapest standard room was like this. This year I booked a more expensive room and called to ask. After making sure that the window could be seen, and that it was not blocked by the bulging roof of the lobby, I checked in and entered the room. It was still the same as last year. I asked the front desk to change rooms, and the elderly and children had to wait for three hours before they could check in again! Very unhappy☹️

msg:Service: I asked the front desk for children's supplies because I was bringing my child. The reply was: I was just checking in. I don't know what the service department has. You can call and ask. In addition, the waiter who checked me in was still muttering that the previous guest was too busy and difficult to serve when I checked in.
The children's playground is divided into two, inside and outside. I took my child to ask the service staff what is in the indoor children's playground. The male waiter said ocean balls in a particularly bad mood. I asked if there are only ocean balls? He didn't quite say it. As a result, I went to see it the next day, and there was clearly a slide.
The waiter on the second day was a woman. She asked me where I was going. I said I was taking my child to the outdoor amusement park to play for a while (because the male waiter's statement the day before made me not want to go indoors). She told me that I had to take off my shoes before entering. It was minus 4 degrees. She asked me and my child to take off our shoes and go to play outdoors. Out of respect for the hotel's "rules", I did not argue and chose to play indoors for a while. As a result, when I came out, I saw many people, even adults, wearing shoes to play in the outdoor amusement park. I went to question the female waiter, but she took a bad attitude and said that I was here to support and I didn't know. There was no apology at all. Okay, you are here to support, but why didn't you say you were here to support when you first emphasized the rules to me? Why were you so sure?
I am very dissatisfied with the service of this hotel, and I don't even want to give it one point. I will never stay in this hotel again.

msg:Since it's a weekend getaway just to go, and it's summer vacation➕weekend, the pressure of booking a room in Gubei Water Town can be imagined. I originally booked an inn in the scenic spot to experience the taste of the small town in the south of the Yangtze River. After submitting the order twice, the reservation was not successful. At this time, Mr. Zhao Benlin, the butler of Ctrip with the strongest executive power in the universe and the butler of Gubei Light, made a grand appearance! Having used Ctrip for many years, the most reassuring thing is their attitude and ability to solve problems. I brought a family of four, and the Ctrip housekeeper contacted the scenic spot, and the scenic spot was also actively helping to find a room type suitable for the number of people. The problem was quickly resolved. The most unexpected and explosive thing was that we were upgraded to a duplex family suite in a five-diamond hotel for free. A 2-meter bed plus two 1.2-meter single beds, I was stunned 😱 and gave me two 520 yuan hotel vouchers to appease my unhappiness that I failed to book a room! But how could I not be happy! It is very difficult for us to book a room on the spur of the moment! Now the windfall I'm dying of joy! Let me try how to use the coupons. It’s simple and rude, and I can immediately reduce it. I booked a hotel in Guangzhou for a business trip next week, and it only costs 8 yuan. I really love the a**osphere of Ctrip! On the way from Beijing, I received a call from Gubei Zhiguang Butler Zhao. He was concerned about whether our journey was going well. He told us to drive carefully and prepare welcome fruits to wait for us at the hotel. If you have any questions in the scenic area, you can contact him at any time. The moment I got the call, I knew it was going to be a pretty comfortable two day, one night weekend getaway. This is indeed the case, this is the happiest and most quality trip in recent times.

The hotels in the scenic area do not all include tickets, but Gubei Light did it! Tickets for four are free! Fast pass! There is a free shuttle bus in the No. 1 parking lot. The hotel guests in the scenic area take the bus for free, and the non-staying guests pay 10 yuan. Every service staff has a sunny and positive smile, which really makes people feel at ease. The car drove to the visitor center to check in here. There were many people and the queue was long, but the speed was quite fast. After check-in, we will give us a yellow list. This is a magic weapon that cannot be lost. It will be very useful for taking a car, hot springs, buying tickets for the Great Wall cableway, etc. After entering the scenic area, the battery car was delivered to the hotel entrance. At this time, the housekeeper, Brother Zhao, was already waiting in the lobby. Because we arrived early and the room had not been sorted out, the housekeeper Zhao told us to get it done as soon as possible, so we saved our luggage and went to have a meal. For dinner, a little brother in the lobby was very enthusiastic and took us to the restaurant of the hotel, and introduced us to the special features. The restaurant is so big that it is really easy to get lost. The little brother kept sending us to the location before leaving. Thank you so much 🙏 for lunch I am very happy. Everyone in the hotel has given us so much care and concern. The service concept and work efficiency are really worth learning for all service industries!

Thanks to the hotel housekeeper Zhao for his considerate service, arranging late check-out for us, and the child took a nap after swimming, it is really full of happiness!

Breakfast: super rich, especially panini and small ravioli stew are super delicious
Water Town Xiaoyue Mooncake Gift Box: As a gift, it will be mailed directly to your home
Gubei Water Town Ticket for Four: Free! Free!
Hot Spring: Free for accommodation tourists!
Swimming pool: free! The water is crystal clear!
Tickets for the Sima Great Wall cableway, discounts for overnight guests, original price 200 for night tour of the Great Wall

The hotel facilities and environment are very good, and the feeling and a**osphere of the water town scenic spot are also good. Unfortunately, there are too many commercial elements in the scenic spot, which is a bit of a show.
One thing that needs to be noted is that it is best to bring some constant medicine with you when you go out. I was a little uncomfortable at night but I couldn't buy medicine, but it was not serious enough to need to call an ambulance, which was quite embarrassing.

msg:This is the second time to go to Gubei Water Town, and I specially chose the famous Gubei Zhiguang Hot Spring Hotel, which really deserves its reputation and adds a lot to this trip. I took my child by car, and I checked my luggage directly into the hotel from the parking lot. I checked in at the general hall at the entrance, and got the Gubei Water Town tickets, hot spring tickets, and Xiaoyue Water Town as a gift from the hotel. Mooncake gift box voucher (surprise surprise). Considering that the official said to check in at 15:00, we arrived at 8:00 in the morning. After checking in the luggage, we took the children to start visiting the ancient town. It may be because of the hot summer. There are not many tourists in the ancient town during the day, so we can appreciate the tranquility of the ancient town. distant. Before 12:00, Manager Tong, the hotel's personal butler, called to tell us that we could check in and upgraded the room for free. Manager Tong was very enthusiastic and told us several special projects of the hotel, several interesting attractions in the ancient town, and the time for night performances, which made people feel very warm. Due to the long time of shopping in the scenic area, it was already past 16:00 when we arrived at the hotel. After checking in at the front desk, the staff at the luggage office personally helped us deliver the luggage to the room. The accessories in the room are very new, and the overall The environment is clean and refreshing. After checking in, after a short rest, we rushed to the famous Internet celebrity check-in place, the infinity pool. The water temperature in the swimming pool is suitable, there are not many people, and the water quality is good. It is very comfortable to swim. If you are tired from swimming, you can take a dip in the hot spring pools on both sides to soothe your muscles and bones. If you are hungry, you can solve it at the hotel or have some snacks in the ancient town. We wanted to watch the night performance, so we ate bridgehead cakes and tofu corners in the town. I thought they were delicious and suited my taste. Listening to music, drinking wine, eating meat skewers, and watching night performances in the music leisure area of ​​Sun Moon Plaza, it’s so comfortable! When you return to the hotel at night, you can soak in the hot springs. There are two types, indoors and outdoors. In the outdoor area, you can see the night view of the Great Wall of China and the scenic spot. The fatigue of the day can be completely relieved. The next day I slept until I woke up naturally and had breakfast at the hotel. The venue is large, and there are many types of food in a variety of styles. Both Chinese and Western food are available. I like to eat honeycomb, cut it myself, and the original taste. After the meal, I went to the swimming pool to burn off calories, and I didn't want to leave! Checked out at noon, checked the luggage directly to the parking lot, reluctantly left the hotel and wandered around the scenic area. At three o’clock in the afternoon, the child suddenly said that he wanted to do the Great Wall cableway. Well, the old mother gave up her life to accompany the child on a hot day. The cableway goes directly to the Simatai Great Wall. The first building, No. 5, stood on the city wall. It didn’t feel stuffy, but there was a gust of cool wind. Looking at the beautiful scenery in the distance, and the Gubei Water Town at the foot, I suddenly became interested, and didn’t want to go back the same way. I want to see if I can climb to Building 10. There is a place on the stairs from Building 5 to Building 6 that feels slippery, and you have to lean forward. Building 6 to Building 7 is relatively easy and the distance is short. Building 7 to Building 8 is relatively normal, but you have to pass through a section of iron ladder This is the only way to enter Building No. 8. Building No. 8 can go directly to the cableway. We chose to climb to the end and return. It was already 16:00, and the Great Wall was about to be cleared at 16:30. The stairs from Building 8 to Building 9 are relatively steep, and some steps are also very high. Fortunately, my child and I held hands, encouraged each other, and climbed up to Building 9 carefully. There is a section between Building 9 and Building 10. The flat road with some slopes is easy to walk. Finally arrived at Building 10! The trip to Gubei Water Town is also complete! The Simatai Great Wall is really a view on the first floor, and it is not the same everywhere! After enjoying the scenery for a while, it was time for the staff to clean up the people in the scenic spot. I quickly headed to Building No. 8 with the staff. Keeping our feet on the ground, we arrived at Building 8 at 16:28. When we came to the entrance of the cableway, we were already the last two tourists. At this time, it started to rain lightly. In the rain, we took the shuttle bus to the first parking lot, went to the luggage, got on the bus to eat some supplies, and started to go to Beijing city. . At this time, the rain was getting stronger, and the road was smooth, and it took 2 hours and 20 minutes to get home safely! The trip to Gubei Water Town has come to a perfect conclusion! I also set a goal for the next trip, which is to focus on swimming and hot springs at the Gubei Light Hotel, a real relaxing trip. Looking forward to the next trip to Gubei!

[Candy] [Candy] Traveling with my parents, it is a rare opportunity to go out and walk. It took several days to choose a hotel, tangled and obstacles, let me talk about my feelings and dissatisfaction first, 1. From check-in to check-out, I basically did not enjoy the professional service of the hotel! A state of being unable to live, eating or not eating, asking about everything, looking at guests with colored glasses! From the T1 car park to the hotel, no one asked us where we were staying and if we needed help? 2. The hotel staff did not greet each other when they met. 3. The hotel and Gubei service center have two telephones. If you have a problem, you should call the Gubei customer service center first, and then the hotel will handle it. The process is very troublesome! 4. Good morning requires the front desk to make an appoin**ent for the next morning's meal time slot before it can be used! The restaurant waiters are cold-eyed and will not take the initiative to clean up the finished dishes at the table!

[Candy] [Candy] The room was simply cleaned up when we left the store. The electric toothbrush was left in the room. The concierge took the initiative to call and deal with it in time. It feels good!

Four-person hot spring experience coupon: This project is not bad, but it would be better if it could be connected to the swimming pool. The charges can be calculated separately. Currently, it is in two areas and requires walking out, which is very inconvenient.
Tickets for Gubei Water Town for four people: included in hotel accommodation fee, very convenient

The point that needs to be complained about is the swimming pool!
The floating board of the swimming pool was not fastened tightly, and the child suddenly became loose while swimming in the middle of the pool. Fortunately, an adult was nearby and fished him out quickly, otherwise the consequences would be disastrous. Just this board costs 38 yuan to use once! !

The hot springs on the city have pools of different temperatures; the large terrace on the third floor can see the whole picture of Gubei Water Town, especially at night when it is shrouded in lights; there is also the Simatai Great Wall in the northeast like a dragon. 🙂
The only regret is that you can't see the waterway through the window of the room🙃

Environment: Green mountains and green waters. Hotel decoration: a**ospheric and quiet environment. Service: Not bad, but as long as there are one or two fatal flaws, it will be zero points! First, the stairs in the duplex family room were very noisy. The children were walking up and down. We went to bed after nine o'clock and had jet lag. We fell asleep quickly. Then we were woken up by a phone call from the hotel, telling us that there was an old man next door and asked us to pay attention. , I really wanted to spit out the fragrance at that time, and I fell asleep after nine o'clock! Do you have any requirements for what time the child goes to bed? You clearly know that we have children, but you still arrange an elderly person next door? If this were my employee, I would scold him for a month. Second point: Too much chlorine was put in the hotel swimming pool. The next morning, the swimsuit still had a strong smell. This environment, this location, this decoration, the room fee of more than 3,000, are you sorry? As a customer of Banyan Tree, someone left a comment, saying that he regretted every time he checked out and was reluctant to leave. Regarding these two things, my feelings are the same. Delicious food, two flies came out of the meal!

Because there were elderly people traveling with him, he also helped adjust the location of the room price. It was only two steps away from the elevator. They will also inform you about the check-in process, promptly remind you to make a hot spring reservation, and remind you about breakfast. Very considerate.

Hotel facilities: The lobby is very large, and the temperature in the room is adjusted to be very hot, which is suitable at night. There is a nespresso coffee machine and capsules, and the mattress and pillows are also very comfortable. I slept soundly after a day of playing.

Hotel food: I read previous reviews that the breakfast was very simple, and the results exceeded expectations. I recommend the freshly baked waffles with syrup, which are super delicious (a suggestion, if there is cream, it would be perfect). The elderly in the family have good reviews for the tofu. .

We got a free hot spring and saw the drone show. We could stroll around the water town at night. It was quiet and very bright. I'll still come back again

It is really necessary to use the room card to take unlimited shuttle buses. It saves a lot of trouble. The staff can help you call a car at any time, and you can even go shopping in the scenic spot after checking out , You can also take a shuttle bus! Not to mention the service. After check-in, we were received by the housekeeper Yang Lijun. He led the check-in and introduced the hotel situation. During the check-in period, he would also remind the activity time and related matters, coordinate with the concierge to help check luggage, etc. The next night, we will go out to the scenic spot for comparison. It was late, and the concierge staff also helped to transport the luggage to the ferry station. I specially saw the name plate called Yao Bingsen. Thank you very much! The snacks and restaurants in the scenic area taste good, and I personally feel that the price is relatively reasonable. In short, I am very satisfied from entering the scenic area to the end of the tour. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Gubei Water Town, and I will stay in Gubei Light next time!

However, when I opened the room, I felt that the smell of disinfectant was very strong, and the vision outside the window of the room was not satisfactory. After communicating with the front desk, I asked the superior for me. To my surprise, it was the manager Ma Limin who came here for a while, and I feel overwhelmed by the attention, because this time is the time for check-out and check-in. Manager Ma can come here to solve such a small problem in his busy schedule. Service awareness and attitude have been well received. The beautiful Manager Ma is not very old, but he is very patient and considerate. After watching two rooms with him, the elderly and children were very satisfied and readjusted a room. Then Manager Ma also thoughtfully sent a fruit plate to appease our troubled emotions. He also explained that the smell of disinfectant water is stronger because the disinfection must not go through the motions. Although the epidemic has dissipated, the virus should not be underestimated. Doing so is also responsible for the guests. In the next two days, Manager Ma also paid attention to our experience of the hotel and provided a lot of help. I had a good trip this time, and I am very satisfied with the service. I will recommend friends and colleagues to stay in Gubei Light in the future. Thanks again to Manager Ma Limin for her thoughtfulness and patience.

msg:Fortunately, I traveled on a staggered peak on May 1st! Checked in on May 3rd and skipped work for a day on May 4th, and the traffic on the 3rd was significantly reduced! The most important thing is that the room rate has returned to the normal level, 1570 for a deluxe shared bed room, but the price has reached 3000 during the holidays! Personally, I don't think it's necessary at all! Double the price but not double the service.
I feel that the reception capacity of the hotel is really average, but the service is very good, so I give it 4 points. I arrived at Water Town at 10 am on May 3, and I was given room 7036 on the 7th floor. In fact, there is no view. See Figure 1. The room is at the top of the stairs. It's impossible to shut up completely in the corridor, especially the normal voice of the bear running around in the corridor can be heard clearly in the room. It's really ** d that other people's children are not as good as 🐶The parents know how to speak in a lower voice, most of them feel that they will be in the room soon, and the children will not stop them from speaking normally. But those who live at the top of the stairs are really unlucky! Although the hotel requires earplugs, no! But in the end, I took the initiative to change the room for me.
The breakfast is really good. I give good reviews mainly because of the breakfast. I have stayed in many hotels in Watertown, and it has the best breakfast! There is Panini! The noodles are also good! The variety is very rich! Even though there were still a lot of people, there were no paper towels, no knives, forks and spoons on the table, because the waiters were too busy, and there were no cups and bowls at one point. At 9:20, there was no more bread, even sliced bread. I reminded me several times, probably because I brought all the leftovers from the kitchen, and there were no Danish pastries and ox horns. Until 10 o’clock, I urged again Several times or nothing! I don't usually eat bread, but I was upset when others ate it and I didn't eat it. In the end, the waiter baked 2 extra for me, which really touched me.
The water temperature in the swimming pool is too low, and I have hives when I take a bath. The sanitation of the swimming pool is worrying, and the facilities in the bathroom are simple.

It is suitable for family trips by the elderly and children. When you are tired from shopping, you can always go back to the hotel to rest and take a rest. On the first day, I wandered around the ancient town during the day, took a lunch break in the hotel at noon, took a paddle boat ride in the afternoon, and watched a drone show in the evening (later I found out that I could also watch it in the hotel without being crowded) and went to the town early the next morning. We walked around for a while, took the children to swim, and the elderly took a bath in the hot springs. There were not many people at this time, so it was quite pleasant to avoid the crowds. There is a free shuttle bus and luggage check-in service for hotel guests, which is generally very convenient. Our room faced the Great Wall, and we could watch the night view of the Great Wall and the drone show in the room at night. The hotel's overall service was good, and the hardware was decent. Manager Gao Wenchao's reception was very warm and in place. All in all, it was a pretty good short trip.

My colleagues recommended that I choose to stay at Gubei Light. During the three days and two nights, I felt that I had made the right choice. sex.
Before arriving, I received a call from the exclusive butler Zhao Benlin. He added WeChat and checked the luggage in the P1 parking lot. The QR code was sent directly to Benlin. There was no need to worry about the whole process. The luggage was delivered directly to the room and the room card was redeemed from the moment he stepped into the hotel. From entering the room to introducing the overall environment and getting around, Benlin was very professional and patiently accompanied and introduced.
The baby likes to eat apples from the hotel very much. Ben Lin prepares fresh apples every day. I heard that we didn’t bring enough mineral water for making milk powder for our baby, so Ben Lin also sent 6 bottles of Nongfu Spring.
It started to rain in the afternoon of the second day after we checked in, so we told Ben Lin that we were going to a hot spring. He also took care of everything from providing an umbrella to calling a shuttle bus.
When checking out, you just need to pack your luggage and put it in the room, and you don't have to worry about anything else. I took the elderly and children to have breakfast, and when I arrived at the parking lot, my luggage had already arrived at the P1 luggage storage area.
Although it was a working day, there were not many guests in the hotel, but every problem and every request was solved perfectly and meticulously. Perhaps these seemingly small things were particularly heart-warming for me with the elderly and children. These attentive features are something I have never experienced before in so many hotels. Precisely because I have experienced such services, I will definitely choose Gubei Light next time.

Whether it's the service attitude or the accommodation environment, everything is very good and makes people feel warm. This time I was especially surprised. It happened to be my birthday on the day I checked in. I didn't even take it seriously. I didn't expect that the hotel actually sent me a small cake. It was so thoughtful. I will stay here again in the future.

It was a pleasant chat, knowledgeable and sincere. It can be said that I have refreshed my understanding of the level of people in the hotel service industry.

msg:I have been to Gubei four times, and every time I pass by, the children say they want to go to this transparent swimming pool. It’s just that there are no rooms when I make a reservation this time, so there’s only the room left for Ba La La Xiao Moxian.
So I quickly placed an order for two. The location of the hotel is near the Riyue Island Ferry Station, in the middle of the entire water town, and it is very convenient to go anywhere. The service staff are also very nice. In addition to the large pool in the middle, there are four smaller pools with higher temperatures, which children especially like.

Therefore, another 2330 yuan needs to be paid when arriving at Shuizhen. 3-5 days after check-out, Ctrip will refund the deposit of 2330 yuan. When making travel plans, the hotel needs to plan 4660 yuan here!

The hotel is very good, and the service staff are very friendly. They can communicate in English from the guest room, restaurant to the front desk. This is very friendly to foreign friends.

The supporting facilities are very complete. After check-in, the manager will call to introduce himself, and the service staff will help to get the luggage to the room. Toothbrush will be provided at the front desk, and there are slippers, toiletries, and hair dryer in the room.

For those with children, the hotel has a children's entertainment room and swimming pool, all free of charge.

Gym and beauty prices are also very close to the people.

This time, the hotel has sent into the town tickets and hot springs and breakfast. The hot springs are great to book in advance. The breakfast is very rich, both Chinese and Western.

This time I traveled with my mother (70) daughter (19) son (4).

Highly recommend this hotel

Breakfast: very rich! I really love it. The four of us are quite satisfied with the food.
Environment: The overall environment is very clean, and there is a small scenic spot behind the hotel, which is very beautiful
Facilities: Very complete, but the windows in the family room are too high, and the curtains are not very easy to draw, but this is already very fussy 😂
Service: It's really amazing and caring. The butler Qiwei is really considerate. In the evening, he thoughtfully delivered yogurt. Because the wind has been windy for the past few days, the child drank less water and had a nosebleed when he left the store. He also specially offered a small gift. Really It's too warm, I give Gubei Light full marks for its service💯
It's a pity that the hot spring roll was sent this time but it was useless, but it is very close, and I will definitely come again next time

If you want to see Gobuksujin, we recommend making a reservation at the hotel.
Because it is located almost at the end of Gobuksujin W Town.
Conversely, you have to go sightseeing. After arrival, enjoy the nearby night view
The next day, you can send the suitcases to the parking lot using the hotel's delivery service, and it's good to go down and look around.
The swimming pool is great, and the hot springs 200m away are also great.

Facilities: Quite average. The breakfast is not very good either. It’s just average hotel quality. I didn’t see the panini and sandwiches that others commented on. I don’t know if they were not available on the day I went. The butter and jam are not from the brand. The noodles are not from the same brand. There is only Noodles available, no other options.
The family room we stayed in only had three bottles of water, and the welcome fruit was one pear and two oranges. As the Mid-Autumn Festival had just passed, we also had two homemade mooncakes.

The only good thing is that luggage can be checked in, but the rest is not great.

msg:We rushed to Gubei Water Town at the end of the Double Festival. It was also our first time to Gubei. Fortunately, Manager Tong from Gubei Light contacted me in advance and told me a lot of tips. Otherwise, I would have been really blind. The car is parked in the No. 1 parking lot. Hotel guests can check in their luggage first, then take the shuttle bus to the service center to check in and exchange tickets. They can stroll around the ancient town or take a rowing boat tour around the ancient town, and then go to the hotel to rest and swim. We came out just in time for dinner, and after watching the drone show, we took a boat directly to buy a half-mile ticket to the Great Wall. A few steps from the end was the Great Wall Music and Water Dance Show. After the show, we took a night tour of the ancient town, and then returned to the hotel to rest. After resting, go to the Chengshang Hot Spring, which is the last one. You can enjoy the night view of the Great Wall while soaking in the outdoor hot spring. Chengshang Hot Spring is right next to Gubei Light Hotel. It would be better if you could go there directly indoors. The breakfast at the hotel was very rich. After eating until I was full, I went to the Simatai Great Wall. If I am strong enough, I can climb up and then take the cable car down. If I want to visit the ancient town, I can continue to eat. If I want to leave, it is not bad to take a boat directly at the foot of the Great Wall and tour the whole journey. . The hotel can store your luggage or check it to the parking lot first. The best thing is that there is almost no need to wait for the shuttle bus in front of the hotel. Hotel guests can sit wherever they want, while other tourists have to buy tickets and queue up to take the bus at other stops. Generally speaking, Gubei Water Town is a good value for money in the scenic area, and Gubei Light Hotel is also very good, especially the service. It is highly recommended.

The car is parked in the P1 parking lot of the scenic spot, and the luggage is checked at the entrance of the scenic spot for free, and a dedicated person will deliver it to the hotel. When you stay in the hotel, you can get tickets to scenic spots, hot spring baths, and unlimited free shuttle buses to scenic spots. Breakfast is a buffet style with a rich menu. The staff are very enthusiastic, especially the hotel manager Gao Qiwei. I happened to meet him on the first day I checked in. He helped us arrange staff, carry our luggage to the guest room, and if we asked him anything, he helped us solve it enthusiastically and promptly. The hotel pool is great! There is also a children's activity area. When you are tired during the day, you can play with your children in the hotel. After dinner in the evening, the elderly can soak in the hot springs near the hotel to relieve their fatigue. Overall, this three-day trip was perfect. I will stay here again next time. Home hotel!

The infinity swimming pool and the children's playground are very popular with children. The free city hot spring is also good, just next to the hotel
The only thing is that the facilities are a bit old. You should be able to live in a better hotel in other scenic spots for 2000 yuan

In the off-season, there are not many people, staying for two nights is not enough. Because I took the elderly and children to play, I chose a hotel with a relatively good environment, and the price/performance ratio exceeded expectations. The price including breakfast, scenic spot tickets and hot springs is not too expensive compared to some other inns. The lobby manager, Ms. Ma Limin, also thoughtfully prepared small cakes, toiletries, bathrobes, etc. for the children, and informed them of all the precautions for playing. The hotel swimming pool is 28.5 degrees and has 4 small hot spring pools. It is very convenient not to go to a special hot spring. There are also indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds, which are very suitable for parents and children.

msg:The room is clean and tidy, with fruits and mineral water delivered for free every day. If you don't have enough, you can ask the front desk for more. The breakfast buffet is rich, but the price is really expensive. The most common standard room costs more than 1,600, and it is more expensive from Friday to weekends! Ctrip seems to be the cheapest. You can check your luggage to the hotel in parking lot 1, and you can take the shuttle bus wherever you want. In fact, the scenic spot is not big. Since we have a baby, the shuttle bus is necessary! If you didn’t go to the hot spring, you can make a reservation through the hotel’s own mini program, and you’ll get a ticket for the Chengshang Hot Spring at the door. The hotel has an ocean ball for children to play with and an infinity swimming pool.

The front desk asked Ctrip users if they could change the room type or upgrade for free. The manager in a black suit ignored him. After questioning, he said that he had just received the notice , Ctrip users can no longer upgrade for free. If the upgrade either costs money or goes through the process, it means that it is impossible to go through the process without a half-day effort for approval. Spend money to upgrade to a family suite, two TVs and three beds, one big bed of 2 meters, two beds of 1.2 meters, sleeping very comfortably. The restaurant in the hotel is delicious. Dianping.com has a meal for two and ordered a pasta. The three snacks are very good. The waiters in the restaurant are very diligent and speak very kindly. After experiencing hot springs and swimming pools, children prefer swimming pools, and there are almost no people there. The driver of the shuttle bus is very enthusiastic and answers all questions. In short, I am very satisfied with this trip. Thanks to the staff of Gubei Light. The male manager in the lobby should learn from the waiters how to treat guests.

Breakfast: Breakfast that meets the hotel's star-rated standards. You can choose your favorite food from a wide variety of categories.
Dinner: I took the elderly and children on a "long-distance raid" and arrived at the hotel very late. I was so hungry that I had to find food nearby. It is no problem for the hotel restaurant to satisfy food and clothing without going out.
Three-person hot spring experience coupon: This is because the elderly and children of our family don't like hot springs, so they voluntarily gave up. I won't say much if I haven't experienced it.
The location of the hotel is very good. Recently, Yuedao (the most prosperous area in the water town) and Wangjing Street, the room furnishings are very new within three years, and all the equipment are available. The welcome fruit is the local seasonal quality in Beijing. Compared with the service of the B&B in all aspects They are all clean, hygienic, convenient and thoughtful. The room on the third floor is one of the best for us, so there is no pressure for a woman with the elderly and children on this trip. I am very satisfied. Thanks to Ctrip, Water Town and the hotel.

msg:Accommodation: I booked Gubei Light Hotel from Ctrip🏨
Although ** also has it and it includes afternoon tea, children's play center and day trip to the Great Wall. If the total price is more suitable than Ctrip, I read the comments and someone said that although the reservation has been made by phone ☎️, it will be temporarily adjusted to other hotels on site🏨 Me too I was afraid that something like this would happen. The second was afternoon tea☕️ and I was also afraid that I wouldn’t have time to drink it. The most important thing was that my family didn’t plan to climb the Great Wall, so I gave up the reservation**
After arriving at the hotel🏨, I read other guides that said to park your car in the first parking lot🅿️ There is a car parking, but I didn't see it, so I walked to the customer service center.
Check-in procedure: The arrival and check-in procedure went smoothly because I made a note on the high-rise reservation, so I was directly given a room on the seventh floor and could go directly to the luggage center to check it in to the hotel (ps: there is a Lawson convenience store and Starbucks at the door, check into the hotel 🏨 You can enter and exit multiple times, but you need to enter facial recognition after entering the park)
Because the original room had not been tidied up when we officially checked in, we temporarily changed it to another room. Haha, the lady at the front desk was very nice. According to my request, she changed my room to a high-rise room with a good view. Thank you very much (I found out at night that I was staying there You can see the Kongming Lantern drone show in that room) ps: Room No. 7063 [呲呲]
Entering the park to play: We just wander around [face covering] and sometimes we take a shuttle bus (it is said that it is free for those who check in, but it seems to be charged for those who do not check in), so I won’t introduce it in detail, but I recommend two projects. One is the Kongming Lantern Drone at night. One of the performances is the Great Wall Musical Fountain
Eat: We ate some snacks such as shredded radish cake, plum blossom cake, grilled pears and so on. The plum blossom cake tasted pretty good.
I don’t recommend the pizza restaurant on Riyue Island. The noodle shop there tastes okay and the price is average. Not very friendly.
The roast pork restaurant on Wangjing Street tastes pretty good. As a person who doesn’t eat pork much, especially pork belly, I can accept it.
The hotel's breakfast is inclusive of two people. I paid for a child's ticket. The breakfast is a buffet, but there is nothing to eat.
Play: The hotel swimming pool is basically for children to play. Adults basically accompany their children. There are four small hot spring pools in the swimming pool, but they are basically used by adults to watch their children.
I don’t know if it’s because of the epidemic. Anyway, I was told to make an appoin**ent.

The environmental facilities are still far behind the international five-star hotel, but it is relatively good in the entire ancient town. There is a swimming pool inside.

Triple hot spring experience voucher:
You can enjoy free hot springs when you stay in the hotel. There are three options. We chose Chengshang, which is next to the hotel. The environment is not bad.

   Not bad, quite satisfactory, that is, there are a little less trash cans. There should be two trash cans in the bathroom.
health:
   It was found that the sheets were not clean and the waiter changed them, and there was nothing wrong with them.
environment:
   There is nothing to say about the geographical location, and it is often far away from Riyue Island. Convenient transportation. There is a shuttle bus at the door. Watching drones and water dance shows are very close.
Serve:
   The hotel also provides fruit which is very heartwarming.
swimming pool:
   Boundless 1.2--1.4, and 4 hot spring pools. If there is no hot spring ticket hotel, there is no problem. Just don't forget to bring swimsuits too expensive.
breakfast:
   It is said that it is 10 o'clock, but the hotel guarantees the quality and quantity of the food, so don't worry that there will be nothing late. The taste is not bad, both Chinese and Western.
advantage:
  It is convenient to eat near Riyue Island, such as: radish cake, pear soup, tofu corner, and roasted sweet potato.
  Just fill in the information in the baggage return scan code applet (baggage check-in), and you can stroll back to the reception center in about 1 hour.
Kind tips:
  The reception center will give you a yellow paper after check-in (check in, take the ferry). After check-in and check-in, you can go in and out multiple times on the right hand side, and you can buy star daddy and Lawson shopping at any time.
shortcoming:
  The air conditioner in the duplex room is too hot and the facilities are a bit outdated.
All in all, it's not bad, gray is often suitable for taking the elderly, and it's cost-effective.

1. Great location! ❤The location of this hotel is on Riyue Island, which is near the core area. I really don’t want to go to Riyue Island Square to watch the drone show. Simatai is not far away; talk shows are also here.
2. Good equipment! ❤Turn on the faucet and there will be hot water, the sign is directly drinkable water, two sinks are very convenient; there are at least 3 sets of plug-in boards; there are floor-to-ceiling curtains between the two beds, so that children can go to bed earlier; all lamps are available at night , play cards, make-up without barriers; there is a dressing stool at the door, which can also be used as a luggage rack, which is very convenient; the bathroom and bathroom are separated from wet and dry, and can be used at the same time; the bed is soft and hard, which is more suitable for children and us.
Much entertainment! ❤The swimming pool is clean, big and small. The deep pool is suitable for my son with good water quality, and there is a small shallow pool with a higher temperature next to it, which is suitable for children; a talk show, a performance by a group of young people, and there is a man named Yueming in the back Little girls are the happiest; billiards and table tennis; chess and card room.
good service! ❤ Check-in at the service desk is fast, reminders are also in place, usually the phone connection is also fast, the lady is very patient; the waiter cleans up the room quickly and carefully, the child accidentally broke the curtain by the bed, and I wanted to come back from dinner to ask the service desk to apologize and report for repairs. When I entered the house, I found that it had been restored to its original appearance 🥰; I checked in on my birthday, and it was a surprise to receive a birthday cake at night 💖; when I met the waiter in the corridor, I would take the initiative to say hello; the swimming pool towels and slippers were all prepared, and my husband even asked me to wear a pair Slippers for returning to the room🙏🏻; the guy at the door and the guy who delivered the car are eager to help carry the luggage, and it’s cute to ask for instructions👍
insufficient:
Rush hour embarrassment! 😅During the Spring Festival, there are so many people at breakfast, it is a bit difficult to find a table. One day I went alone, and finally found a place, and I was a little afraid to get up to get a meal😂
The taste of food is average🙈 The buffet breakfast is complete, the ingredients are good, but not so exquisite, and it is generally considered to be at the upper-middle level; for dinner 🥀 one day, I went to order food at the Chinese restaurant opposite. The standard of Yuxiang is up; when the baby dish comes up, the cabbage heart is actually cold, and it loses 8 points of taste at once💔

If you bring the elderly or children who are not physically strong, it is recommended to choose Gubei Light, which is convenient and not far away.
The hotel facilities are also considered good. It cannot be said to be the best in the ancient town, but it can also be stable in the middle and upper reaches.
The service is very good, the attitude of the staff is very good, and the bathrobes in the room are packaged in bags, which can be guaranteed to be changed once every guest.
I am not very satisfied with the breakfast. During the Chinese New Year period, there are too many people. The hotel does not limit the queues according to the flow of people and vacant tables and chairs. As a result, a large number of people walk back and forth in the restaurant and cannot find vacant seats. The food is still available. It was timely, but the experience was really bad, and my head hurt from the crowds and noise.

msg:N brush Gubei Water Town, catch up with the few people in the past to experience the strong flavor of the New Year, and it has become the first choice for vacation on days when you can’t leave Beijing! This time, I feel that the staff is obviously slack, which may be the reason why they have to go to work during the Chinese New Year... The scenery is hard to pick, the perfect combination of snow scenery in the north + small bridges and flowing water in the south! Gubei Light has hot springs limited to residents, so the experience is very good with few people! It's just that the locker room needs to pay attention to hygiene, the smell inside is not good

When we arrived, a male manager helped us, mother and daughter, carry our luggage to the room. I chose a top-floor room with a good view. After entering, I also introduced the room information. I was very careful and patient. Later I found out that it was a manager named Tong. The service has improved compared to previous years. I hope this will continue to be the case in the future.

I think it is very good to live with children. You can play in the swimming pool until after 10 o'clock in the evening. There are many kinds of breakfast. It is very close to Riyue Island Square. It only takes a few minutes to walk out. Arrived. There is also a street selling snacks, which the children like very much. Before check-in, the hotel’s service steward will contact you by phone. If you have any problems after check-in, they will be solved in time. I would like to thank the service steward Yang Lijun. After check-out, the hotel can check your luggage to the parking lot at the front desk. (It takes an hour, the time is very accurate) ~

The overall environment is clean and comfortable, and the function distribution of floors is reasonable and convenient.
The service, whether it is the front desk, lobby rest area, restaurant, guest room, swimming pool and other leisure areas, is good, and they will answer all questions and satisfy every request as much as possible.
Catering, I had a buffet breakfast at the hotel, which was good in a hotel of the same level, with a wide variety. But the taste of the meal needs to be added, and it can be more delicious. Children over 1.2 meters need to pay 68, which can be paid on site.
The room is very clean. Various room types are suitable for us with children. It is relatively comfortable. The shower and hot water are also very good. Overall satisfaction.
I'm very satisfied with the location. When you go out of the hotel and go down the slope, you will find Riyue Island. It's super convenient to watch the Kongming Lantern with drones and other performances.
This time due to the epidemic, I didn't take my children to experience the hotel swimming pool and hot springs, and I will come back next year.

The location is a 5-minute walk from Riyue Island Square, very convenient. Therefore, through comparison and experience, the Light of Gubei is indeed a good choice for a water town.

The downside is that it is inconvenient for parents and children to travel: after parking, the parking lot is far away from the water town management center, and the weather is hot and tiring, because it is tiring and inconvenient to take the children because of the need to change to a shuttle bus or a shuttle bus.

The scenery is beautiful, and the fish, ducks and geese raised are very cute, adding a color to the scenic spot. This is the third time I have stayed at Gubei Zhiguang Hotel. The quality of the accommodation is good, the quilt is very comfortable, the pillows are slightly higher, and the overall is not bad. Gubeizhiguang is very close to everything, the water dance show and the drone show are very close, but unfortunately the drone show stopped because of the meeting, which is a little regrettable. The acrobatic lion dance and other performances have stopped, and the remaining water dance show is very beautiful. Balala Little Magic Fairy's parent-child room is very good. There are many things for little girls in it, as well as a princess dress. There is also a children's toilet in the bathroom. It is super suitable for families with small babies. There are swimming pools and game fields in the hotel, and there are many ocean balls. The children don't want to go and play for another day. The deluxe bed-sharing room can see the Great Wall and the scenery is better. The Balala Little Magic Fairy Family Room has no view, but it doesn't matter what the view outside the window is just for one night. A very good experience, the leisure area outside the room is also very good and stylish. The service of the hotel is very good. I stayed for more than two nights during off-peak travel and delivered lunch. When I went to write off, the hotel restaurant specially changed different dishes. I ate a lot of dishes at one time, and everyone was very satisfied. There are not many kinds of swimsuits outside the hotel swimming pool, and they are quite expensive, basically more than 300-500. You must bring a swimsuit and a swimming cap when you go. The swimming pool is divided into 1 large swimming pool with 28 degrees and 4 constant temperature pools with 34-40 degrees. Bring your children to play in the heated pool. There is a deer in the water town, if you are interested, you can look for it. Generally speaking, meals are not too expensive, and people are frugal. If you want to know the taste, there are also public comments. Next time I wait for the acrobatic lion dance to resume and go again.

If you are leaving the hotel but not leaving the scenic spot, we recommend luggage check-in service. Let the hotel check your luggage to the parking lot (leave it for at least 1 hour), and then go directly to the parking lot after your own tour.

Many people at the restaurant's buffet breakfast did not wear masks when picking up their meals. I only saw a staff member reminding me that I hope to strengthen the reminder during the epidemic.

msg:After doing the strategy to go to Gushuibei Town of Simatai Great Wall, the first hotel I chose, Gubei Zhiguang Hot Spring Hotel is located in the scenic area. The decoration of the hotel has a sense of history, and the design of the ancient Great Wall is very artistic.
First of all, check-in: (booking hotels in the scenic spot are free of scenic spot tickets and Tangquan tickets) Check-in directly at the entrance of the scenic spot, no need to wait, it is very convenient, enter the scenic spot and take the shuttle bus to take you to the hotel, enter the lobby with a strong smell of disinfectant, Very uncomfortable (understandable during the epidemic) The front desk applied for the room card and checked in directly. During the period, I changed the room. Because of the strong musty smell and disinfectant smell in the room, it was very uncomfortable, but the service of the room attendant is worthy of praise and patience. awesome.
Let's talk about the room: the floor and the bathroom are all water, ask the front desk if the room is just cleaned, and it's over. The facilities and equipment are basically in line with the configuration of a five-star hotel. The fly in the oin**ent is that there is no bedside audio, followed by the TV automatically exiting four or five times in the afternoon, speechless, and the network is extremely poor, using its own traffic. I was in a hurry to go out and didn't bring a razor. I didn't have a disposable razor in the morning wash. It took me two calls to get it.
Breakfast: The cut fruit is not sweet, and the worst thing to eat is the bread, very dry croissant, Danish, it feels like it has been put for a long time, toast and soft bags are all hard, really general. The three kinds of porridge (white porridge, millet porridge, and multigrain porridge) are very thin with water and are layered. The top is water and the bottom is rice, and the heat is not enough. I want an omelet. I wanted to be tender, and I waited for five minutes to pick it up. I didn't say the shape, it was just an egg cake; the wontons were the best in the whole breakfast, they were cooked fresh, and they were great.
I often stay in five-diamond hotels, this time the experience of staying in is general, and it is not worth experiencing again.

msg:This is a hotel I've been looking forward to staying at! The hotel is located in the scenic area, so there is no need to rush back and forth. I like the Chinese decoration style very much 💕 festive and peaceful! Perfect facilities! The breakfast is very rich, especially at this stage, the hotel's breakfast, swimming pool and other entertainment venues need to make an appoin**ent to enter the venue. The personnel density in the venue is moderate, giving tourists a full sense of security! Autumn in the scenic area is getting stronger and stronger, which can be described as one step at a time. There is a shuttle bus back and forth at the entrance of the hotel to pick up and drop off tourists, which is very convenient for sightseeing in the scenic area!

Location: Absolutely C, it takes a few minutes to walk anywhere~ Snack Street, Wharf, Hilltop Church, Wangjing Street, Water Dance Show, it's really just a few minutes, no need to take a ferry at all

Environment: The room is very big. We live in a standard room on the 7th floor. The scenery outside the window is as shown in Figure 3. When the two beds are put together, the children will be very spacious in the middle.


Facilities: Gym, children's playground are great. The best thing is the swimming pool, 26 to 28 degrees, and it's not too cold on the eleventh. There are several small pools with a temperature of 39 degrees next to the big swimming pool.


Two-person hot spring experience coupon: You can enter and exit the city hot spring next door for free with the room card. The hot spring is still very good. There is nothing that is not suitable for children under 3 years old. The 39-degree pool, the temperature is especially suitable! Have fun~

The non-festive Gubei Water Town is still very good and highly recommended!

I chose the Light of Gubei, which I have seen for the first time when I came to Gubei. The experience is really surprising. 1. Because the room was unoccupied the night before, when I checked in in Gubei early in the morning, I was told that I could check in immediately (it was originally at 3 p.m.) 2. There is a caring butler service. If there is any problem during the check-in, send WeChat to help quickly I solve 3. The hotel is a hot spring hotel. The water quality of the hotel is very soft and the bathing is very comfortable. The old mother has been full of praise. If I come to Gubei Water Town next time, I think I will still choose Gubei Light

The hotel's glass swimming pool is a feature. The buffet breakfast is rich. It is more appropriate to book the hotel and send tickets and hot spring tickets. . Because there are not too many people going there at the end of September, it is not as good as the summer vacation and November, so the services are better in all aspects, basically responding to requests. I wanted to visit the Huotang Hotel, but it was not open. The manager of the Hangu Hotel even gave a specially arranged shuttle bus and a special person to take the tour, which is very good. This is definitely impossible in the peak season, and if I see some negative comments, it is basically the peak season. There are too many people at that time, resulting in a decline in service quality or a low price-performance ratio of the hotel. The treasure restaurant - Deyuelou Inn is especially recommended. It is hidden in the world. It is better than the quiet environment. It is surrounded by rivers on all sides. The main dishes are also very delicious. The overall management of the water town is good, and a better experience of play and accommodation can be guaranteed during non-peak seasons.

Booked a family suite and was surprised again. But there is one thing to say, the blood stains on the sheets in Figure 1 brought an unpleasant stroke to this beautiful trip, and the cleaning lady's attitude to change the sheets was not very good, but the most important thing to spend so much money on travel is to be happy. The lady who exchanged tickets at the scenic spot was very amiable. The staff at the hotel dinner were very warm-hearted and gave them a big compliment. Unfortunately, the luggage was checked in the next day, and there was no hot spring. It is recommended to book the hot spring in the applet in advance, but the tour Swimming twice made up for it, the swimming pool also has a hot spring pool, and the water is clean with not many people.

In fact, this hotel has been visited before, and I did not choose to stay at that time. There were open swimming activities before. This time, I simply chose to live here and can swim. Of course, the hotel is soft and hard, and the hygiene and comfort of the rooms are also good. I happened to receive a birthday cake from the hotel on my birthday.

There are many advantages and two disadvantages, which are also sincere suggestions as customers:
1. The facilities are fully equipped, and there are some in the hotel. The decoration is also very stylish, but I can't figure out why the guest room wifi is so bad? ? Shouldn't I be the only customer who suggested it? Because sometimes when you come to the hotel for a short holiday, you may need to complete some work by the way. This network is very critical.

2. In fact, this second point cannot be blamed on the responsibility of hotel management, but more on the self-consciousness and quality of "customers". This swimming pool is the biggest highlight and selling point, but there are big problems with hygiene and management. The swimming pool is not partitioned, there will be many children playing water polo and playing around during the holidays, but there are still some customers who just want to come to this place to relax and swim freely. The children are not partitioned, or the parents don't care, as long as the children have fun , then there will be some adults bumping or kicking children when they are going back and forth in the swimming lane, and no one wants to make physical contact, but it is even more impossible to educate children, so it will be very embarrassing, whether it is based on swimming, or wait until the child What about the show?
The other is the hygiene of the swimming pool. It is recommended to prepare some trash cans, plus management regulations, because I personally saw adults blow their noses in the swimming pool, and then put their hands in the swimming pool to wash... When I saw this scene At that time, there was no desire to continue swimming at all, and he left immediately.

🧹Hygiene: The new occupant found that the bathroom was not cleaned properly, and the relics of the upper household are still there...

🍃Environment: The space is okay, but most of them are patio windows, so it's a pity that you can't see the scenery of the water town.

🔔Service: Let’s focus on breakfast. The size of the dishes is similar to that of the five-star hotels in the city, but there is still a big gap between the taste and service level. The chefs may have been recruited and trained locally, and their hygiene awareness is weak. After stirring the raw eggs, they directly add cooked food to me, which is really speechless.

The most important thing is that the service staff is very nice, a Miss Su provided us with a lot of convenience, and the family members are very happy.
The infinity pool in the hotel is also very good. The water temperature is about 28 degrees, and the children will not feel cold. There is also a small swimming pool suitable for children and the elderly next to it, which competes with hot springs.
The price includes 4 hot spring tickets. Female guests can be on the second and third floors, and male guests can be on the third floor. There is a viewing platform to see the Simatai Great Wall at night. There is also a discount for the residents to buy tickets for the Great Wall and the combined ticket for the ropeway, which only costs 120 yuan. The tram in the scenic spot can also be used for free with the proof of accommodation.
The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, although it is not listed as five-star, but I think the quality is equivalent.

Park your car in the No. 1 parking lot (10 yuan per entry and exit), and then you can check your luggage at the hotel check-in office. You can also take it by yourself, and then make a battery car and go to the entrance of the ancient town to apply for the hotel check-in form. The battery car took people to the entrance of the hotel in the ancient town, and when they got to the lobby, they received the room card. The waiters all smiled and greeted them when they passed by.
The hotel is friendly to Ctrip guests. To the free upgrade, after entering the room. It looks quite big, about 40 square meters, the toilet and shower are separated, there are two sinks, and the bed is also wide. The bedding is comfortable, the bathrobes are sterilized, the protective cover is covered and the disposable label is fixed at the zipper. The details are in place, and it is very safe to use. You can go directly to the hotel swimming pool wearing a bathrobe.
With the room card or check-in list, you can go to various attractions for free by making a battery car in the ancient town.
The breakfast is very rich, both Chinese and Western styles, if the coffee quality is also improved to the same hotel star level, it will be more perfect.
In particular, if you live in a hotel, you must experience the hotel's dinner, which is really delicious.
The overall hotel is very suitable for leisure and vacation. If you stay for three or four days and stroll around the ancient town, it is very pleasant to relax in the hotel.
Will visit again in the future!

🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient.

There are many shuttle buses. We went during working hours, people Not much, no need to queue, just pass in an orderly manner, very quickly.
🧹Hygiene: Personal feeling basically conforms to the hotel star standard. We booked a deluxe bed-sharing room, which was neat and tidy. A small suggestion is to make the air fresher in the women's changing room in the swimming pool.
🍃Environment: Great, the location is very good, the center of the scenic spot, very close to all the attractions, it is very convenient to go around during the day and night, and the food is also nearby. Ha, you don't know when the doll needs to go back to the hotel to deal with it.
🔔Service: I want to give full marks to this. This time I went out for my child's birthday. I communicated with the hotel in advance. The hotel arranged the room and colored balloons in advance. The child was very happy. Another, when checking in, I communicated with the lady at the front desk if I could give the child a small cake. The hotel also arranged it. The child was very pleasantly surprised. Thank you for the thoughtful arrangement of the hotel staff.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory, basically in line with the hotel star standard, and the personal bonus is the natural honey.
The swimming pool is good. The children played in it for nearly two hours, mainly in the small hot spring pool.
There were very few people when we went, and the water town of Nuoda was relatively empty. We still hope that everything will return to normal as soon as possible.
All in all, a very satisfying trip to the water town. Next time I come, I will choose Gubei Light.

msg:After the car is parked in the P1 parking lot, walk to the visitor center to check in. The staff guides you to the shuttle bus, which takes less than three minutes to drive to the hotel. During the whole process, I heard the staff communicate with the walkie-talkie, and the connection is close. The room size is large, the facilities are well maintained and the infrastructure is complete. It's just that the room temperature is a bit high, and there is no cold air just before the vernal equinox. The variety of breakfast is quite satisfactory, basically 5-star standard. The hot spring coupon presented at the front desk is just a one-minute walk away from the door. The location of the hotel is basically in the middle of the scenic spot. In fact, Gubei is not big in general, and you can walk to it without taking a shuttle bus.

The grade of treadmills in the gym does not match the grade of the hotel. There are two of them and one is broken. The one-for-four indoor swimming pool is the largest hotel in Gubei Water Town, and the 2.4-meter king-size bed room is set for a family of three to sleep comfortably. N brushed Gubei to catch up with the biggest snowfall in the Year of the Tiger in Beijing, and I was lucky to be able to see the classic snow scene of Gubei. The price of each ice item is 50 for adults and 25 for children, and the price is reasonable compared to Beihai Taoran Pavilion, which cooks dumplings in the city. . Much stronger.

In my heart, lazy cats can be seen everywhere, doors eroded by years, and the little lights at night warm up the winter. The Gubei Zhiguang Hotel I experienced this time also made me want to write a review. The location of the hotel is excellent. It is very close to several hot springs in the ancient town. The housekeeper in the reception center assisted in the formalities and introduced various precautions, which was very considerate. When night falls and the lights are on, you can overlook the entire ancient town from your bed, which is unrealistically beautiful. The buffet breakfast is rich in variety, which is very friendly to families with children, so there is no need to worry about picky eaters. Looking forward to meeting the spring flowers in the ancient town next time!

msg:The hotel is suitable for parents and children. The location is very good. It is relatively centered in the water town. After exiting the gate, turn right and go downhill to Riyue Island Station. , you can go for a walk. It is next to the Chengshang Hot Spring Pavilion. It was measured that a cigarette was lit at the door of the hotel. After three puffs, it was there. There is a passage in the northeast corner of the hotel lobby. It can also be directly connected to the Chengshang Hot Spring Pavilion from the inside, which is very convenient.

Every staff member who has lived in a five-star hotel for two days will not take the initiative to greet the guests, which is really a bit strange, and when I met a few times to eat, the restaurant staff were idle and the two people were there. Talking about the family in front of the guests, but I don't treat the guests as outsiders... As for the service, I can't pick out any major problems. The overall is still satisfactory, especially the concierge in the front hall, luggage collection, check-in, room delivery, very good Warm and thoughtful.

The decoration and decoration of the room uses a lot of Chinese style elements, which are simple and elegant, but a lot of wood decoration is used, which is easy to appear old, but it is still very clean and comfortable. The resistance of the door handle in the bathroom is a bit large, which is very easy for adults, but it may be a little difficult for children. I don’t know if it is an exception in my room or a common problem. At night, children have to work hard to open the door.

There is a small shortcoming, because I prefer swimming with children, and the bathrobe is a bit wet. Before going out the next day, I thought that I would clean the room for a while and then replace it with a new one. As a result, I came back from shopping in the morning and found that it was not cleaned. So when I went out for lunch, I deliberately turned on the light for cleaning please. When I came back from lunch, I saw the cleaning service car parked in the next room. Unexpectedly, when I came back at 5:30 in the afternoon, the cleaning light was still on, and the room was not cleaned up... I had no choice but to call the service desk to ask for cleaning, changing bathrobes, and replenishing two bottles of drinking water.

The hotel swimming pool is great, the water temperature is suitable and the water is clean.

The tomato scrambled eggs for breakfast are delicious, delicious, and delicious!

msg:This is a very pertinent evaluation: Gubei Light is absolutely unnecessary.
Because it must be hard to find, so I have great expectations for Gubei Light. For this Spring Festival trip, I booked the Kuya room. How should I say, the overall design and decoration of the hotel seem to be made by different teams, and the lobby has a Mediterranean Sea The column, then the decoration is Kangxi and the queen, the room is the same, mysterious, with gold characters on the red background, and then adding the decoration of Kuya, I feel that the "veteran cadre" wind is blowing in the face, in terms of price, Gubeizhiguang has no advantage, and the price has fluctuated. Large, and except for the suites, there is no bathtub which is also a problem. Many people, like me, are attracted to the swimming pool, but in fact, it looks good from the outside, so remember to wear a swimming cap inside) Then there are four pools with different temperatures and only three deck chairs, which is very inconvenient. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, because there are so many people, there are often no seats and queues. This experience is not very good, because everyone comes, and they spend thousands of dollars for the room, which is really not thoughtful. The geographical location is relatively superior. It is very convenient to visit the ancient town, take a bath, and go to the Great Wall on the edge of Riyue Island. When it comes to bathing, there are two options. One is in the city. There is a secret passage from the sixth floor of the hotel to walk there. There are hot spring tickets every day, separate men and women, and private soups are paid separately. There is also the Duan family, which can only be visited once during the stay. It is a little far away and needs to take a shuttle bus to Wangjinglou. The two are almost the same, but men and women can be together outdoors in Duan's house, which is friendly to the family. In the city, it is separated, so it is not friendly to the family.
In conclusion, the Gubei Hotel and Gubei Zhiguang have finished pulling ****s. In fact, many hotels are very good, and the service is more in place. There is no need to follow the trend hahaha, I won’t say more~

msg:The second time I came to Gubeizhiguang, it turns out that it is the best choice to stay here in Shuizhen. The hotel is in a good location. There is a ferry station not far from the door. There are buses 24 hours a day. There are shuttle buses to go there. It is also very close to walk to the town's food street and Sun Moon Square. It is also very convenient to walk to the musical fountain at night to watch the light show. The drone show can be seen at the door of the hotel.
The hotel room is also very clean and hygienic. Although we can only check in at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, we can go to the swimming pool first when we arrive. We will be informed that we can check in after one o'clock in the room. The water temperature of the swimming pool is very friendly. No problem, there are four sized warm water pools next to it, and there are also small children to play. The hotel also has a small children's playground, with simple small slides, and some simple outdoor climbing for children to play.
Children like the super flying hero theme room. There is a small tent, tabletop toys, a small wooden horse, children's slippers, a children's foot stool in the washbasin, and a children's handrail and ladder in the bathroom. It is a good consideration for children! The bed is 1.2, and the waiter helped to put it together. It is no problem for the two adults to take the child to sleep.
There are free hot spring tickets outside the hotel, but now the Duan family hot spring is not open, only the hot spring in the city not far from the hotel, which is completely separated from men and women, so we did not go.
If you plan to take your children to a place where you can swim, hot springs, and a children's playground, then choose Gubeizhiguang!
In addition, it is also good to take the ferry to the children's play hall. The shuttle bus at the entrance of the hotel can go to the vicinity. It costs 100 yuan for one large and one small, and 138 for two large and one small. Guests staying at the hotel can show their room card on the same day and can enter and exit unlimited times, although the game is only suitable for four people. Children around the age of 2, but the venue is very large. If the children have a company, it is good to discharge together in the children's play hall!

This time I took the children to experience the swimming pool inside. It was very good. The big pool is a bit cold now. There are two kinds of temperature: 40 degrees and 35 degrees. Personally, I think 35 degrees is more suitable. If you stay at 40 degrees for a long time, you will easily collapse. When you go ashore, you must put on a towel, it will be cold. The breakfast is very rich and there are many people. It is in the scenic spot and there are free battery cars, so it is convenient to go anywhere.

Infrastructure: After swimming, after taking a shower in winter, the hair dryer is broken, I asked the waiter to replace it, but it still doesn't work... The room I returned to with wet hair in the end, there is no body lotion, conditioner...
🌟🌟After changing clothes after the hot spring, I encountered a strange girl looking through my closet! I said what are you doing? The other party said this is your cabinet? Yes mine. She said oh my friend's cabinet is here too. Then slipped away. We must say that after thinking about it, we are afraid, and we have not realized whether this is a repeat thief or is it true? These lockers are all numbered and locked. How can I open it to someone else? !
It's true, fortunately, I didn't lose valuables, but the memory is not very good
🙅‍♀️It’s not the first time for us to travel with our family. We asked the front desk for a comb for each person. The family said that the front desk stared at me... I really didn’t pay attention. In the end, I also had one less child. I just wanted to brush my hair without borrowing a comb. After all, we have a lot of girls. Fortunately, this comb is made of wood, and it was not in vain.

msg:I booked a basic room type. I wanted to book a family suite, but there is only one bathroom, and the two beds are upstairs, which is not very convenient for the elderly. So I booked two standard rooms. It is not cheap on holidays, but the benefits are added. It's good value for money, not to mention that the better hotels are at this price during the holidays, and it is very, very good when compared to the surrounding areas. The hardware and software are good, especially the service is good. It is indeed worthy of the light of Gubei, and it has graced the ancient town. Went on the second day of New Year's Day. The ancient towns with few people are really good in all kinds, and the management is also very good, and the sense of experience is rising. I will go if I don't get enough

msg:In fact, I would like to point negative points. This hotel is really, really bad! We stayed at the Gubei Zhiguang Hot Spring Hotel on the afternoon of December 31 (room 5018 for two nights), because we did not book a car to return to the city on January 2, we decided to stay for one more night (room 3222 for one night) in January At 6:52 on the evening of the 2nd, 3 of us (2 adults and 1 child) ordered a club sandwich (very cold, including bread, omelette, chicken, bacon, tomato, lettuce) at the restaurant on the third floor and did not eat any food. The child started to vomit around 11:00 pm, and we never left the hotel, let alone the scenic spot (except for medical trea**ent) until 12:00 on January 4th. The doctor diagnosed the child with a bacterial infection. (Diagnostic proof below)
The child is in a healthy state, and the illness occurred after staying for two nights. If it has nothing to do with the hotel food, it means that there is a problem with other facilities in the hotel.
Up to now, the hotel has not apologized or compensated us directly. The hotel manager also used recording equipment when negotiating with me, which is too disrespectful to people. Feel like a criminal.

On the same day, a customer service greeted me at the gate of Water Town and guided us to settle in. Because of the epidemic and there were few people, the hotel helped me upgrade the big bed room for free. Both the lobby and the room environment are very unique, indeed "Gubeikou". The epidemic has eased. The hotel gave a hot spring. It is a bit inconvenient to be outside the hotel. The indoor pools of the hot springs are separated for men and women, and the outdoor pools are not separated. There are not many people in the hot springs, and the water is relatively warm and clean. Often there is one pool per person. The hotel’s breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, which is very hearty.

msg:🔔Service: I have stayed in the hotel in the scenic area several times, and stayed several times in the guest house next to it. It is convenient to live inside if you are with children, and the double morning is very rich. Now the one-to-one service is available in the off-season. From the time you book the hotel, someone will contact you and tell you how to make the process, which is very considerate.
🍃Environment: The location of the parent-child and ordinary standard room where you live is on the sixth floor. The night view is not visible. To see the night view, you still have to go to the hilltop church. In fact, I booked this hotel for the pool and gym, and it happened to be in time for renovation... The hotel sends hot spring tickets to the city hot spring next to it. It would be perfect if the hotel has a parent-child playground, but it is already very good.
🚗 Transportation: You can drive to the parking lot of the water town hotel by car. The parking fee is 10 yuan per time, which is very close to the people.
🧹Hygienic: Not bad, there is no strange smell. What I like about this hotel is that there is a curtain in the middle of the double bed that can be separated. Sleeping in other hotels will cause insomnia. This one will not, and sleep very well. It is better than a hotel in a certain ball studio. Although a certain ball studio focuses on a five-star hotel, it is not as good as Gubei’s.

The room is small in size, the sliding door is not soundproof, the bathroom has no place for hanging clothes, and the shower head is too short. , The most important thing is a bathroom, of course I did not look carefully before booking, but this kind of room design is really interesting... It's really not a low order to book 2 double rooms... But the hotel as a whole is still ok. Someone contacted in advance and received the whole process from the parking lot to the room. The service is still very satisfactory. The child also gave a small cake on his birthday. The breakfast type is also considered as a livelihood. Only one hot spring is opened, and the swimming pool is not maintained. I didn't inform in advance, the hotel is convenient for going downhill by the shuttle bus...Due to the epidemic and the off-season, there are not many tourists, and the overall experience is okay. If you live in a hotel in the scenic area, Gubeizhiguang is still the first choice.

3. The room was not cleaned thoroughly, and there were rubbish left by the previous guest.

Thank you very much to the staff in the housekeeping and catering depar**ent and the young lady who answered the phone~ I soon sent two big cups of hot brown sugar ginger tea. Thank you very much🙏
Special thanks to Manager Li Dongfei for his help. Because the hot springs are closed, we changed to a lunch buffet in time (because we have friends from other provinces and I don’t know when we register for the next ticket delivery). The whole experience is great. I will come next time when I have a chance!

Two bottles of water are missing. The service is very ecological. Poor, I said, it’s okay to add mineral water for five yuan a bottle. I’m sorry, I can’t afford it, can’t drink it. Disappointed, I will never visit again in the future. Anyway, you will not miss me as a customer. The store is not afraid that customers will not come. There is always love to go. I forgot to mention that the toilet is very distinctive. The two paintings stare at you when you go to the toilet. Don't worry about day and night. Don't be afraid. If you are afraid, don't come. But there is one thing to say, Gubei Water Town has a good view, and the Great Wall is also very good. It is recommended to climb the Great Wall at night. The scenery at night is very nice, so be it.

To tell the truth, it is beautiful but a little tired, so I should take the car up the mountain. The best thing to see is the drone show. There are two shows on the weekend. After we went down the mountain, we watched the first show in the square, and then we watched the Great Wall water dance show. We returned to the hotel just in time for the second drone show. In front of the hotel’s floor-to-ceiling windows, I saw the second brush [呲牙]. The next day there was a variety of food, swimming pools and hot springs.

There are opera performances at Riyuedao Square. If you have enough rest, you can go to the hilltop church. The Great Wall recommends to live in the scenic area after 17:00 and enjoy 120 sets of tickets. This is very worthwhile. I have seen the scenery of the Great Wall during the day and night. It is recommended to go down the mountain before 19:20. You can take a boat or walk to Riyuedao Square. There will be drone performances at 20:10-20:20. I went by boat. I have also seen the night scenes. After dinner, you can go to the hot springs and have a foot massage to relieve fatigue. You can also go to the swimsuit pool in the hotel. There are also 4 small hot spring pools that are good. Needless to say, the environmental services and hygiene of the 5 Star World Hotel are very good, but the breakfast is very general. I went to the place where I went to Yuantong Temple, so I walked all over the Gubei Water Town. Overall a good time, I recommend staying at Gubei Zhiguang Hot Spring Hotel👍

On the morning of the check-in day, the customer service staff took the initiative to send a text message to contact, then added WeChat, and sent me the code of the mini program, breakfast reservation, pool reservation, hot spring reservation, the whole process is very convenient, and the contact is not understood during the game. The dedicated customer service (Ma Jian, lobby manager) is very enthusiastic and promptly responds to answers. The experience is great.

msg:The car parked at the mountain parking lot, and the shuttle bus went to the passenger service center. After the procedures were completed, the shuttle bus arrived at the hotel. When it came back, it was difficult to get from the hotel to the parking lot. The shuttle bus had to wait for a long time. The rooms are very crowded, and one car can’t fit a few people. It would be nice if the hotel could specially arrange a shuttle bus for guests checking out during the check-out peak. Before reading other comments, there were people who added WeChat to guide the process to make an appoin**ent. We did not encounter this kind of service. If the swimming pool does not use the cabinet, there is no need to make an appoin**ent. Of course, there are too many people to make an appoin**ent with the cabinet on weekends and holidays. We finished our meal. There are already a lot of people going to swim for breakfast. The room has only one bathroom and shower, which are not big. A small part of the shower water will flow to the next bathroom. If you don’t pay attention to the last bathroom slippers, you will step on wet. Children 68, okay, it is crowded, soundproofed, very close to the fountain at night, overall not bad

I especially recommend the infinity pool and fitness and entertainment center. The facilities are very complete. The location of the hotel is very convenient. You can go to the snack street in the water town at any time. Checking in hotels in the scenic area, you can also take a sightseeing bus free of charge, which is particularly convenient to various scenic spots. The hotel’s service is even worse. It’s still attentive and enthusiastic. This time I was fortunate to meet Li Dongfei, the lobby manager. From check-in to check-out, all arrangements were thoughtful and solved a lot of problems for us. We will definitely come back when we have a chance. .

Late summer and early autumn, the clouds are beautiful and the temperature is right
The deputy manager Zhao Lei contacted in advance, and the moderate service throughout the whole process was a real surprise! It adds a bit of comfort to the wonderful itinerary!
The family room is well-designed and the family lives in a very comfortable environment.
During the epidemic, all projects need to make an appoin**ent in advance, and it is recommended to make an appoin**ent when they arrive.
The light swimming pool also needs to make an appoin**ent, mainly to change the wardrobe. The guests of this hotel can go straight down after changing their clothes in the room. There is also a bubble party in the afternoon.
The breakfast is also very good, the pearl barley fried rice is very distinctive.
Will stay here next time.

Although there are many tourists, the guest room area feels quite quiet. There is a transparent swimming pool that is very popular with children, so you can soak in the pool on rainy days. The light of Gubei is generally recommended. The only comment that needs to be raised is for the managers of the entire Gubei Water Town tourist area. For tourists who go to Gubei Water Town for the first time, it is recommended that the tourist area have more signs or guide route maps. Where to park, I don’t know where to check in at the visitor center. Direct hotel phone calls are also very difficult to get through, which is very bad.

msg:Something happened the day before, and I didn't arrive at the hotel until ten o'clock in the evening. Until now, I have been communicating with the scenic spots and hotels on the phone. Parked in the No. 1 parking lot, the baggage check has been off work, and I took the battery car to the scenic spot. The driver was very responsible to help with the luggage and reminded to wear a mask. After entering the park, take the shuttle bus to the hotel. Because it was a set meal, a total of four people were sent to the hot springs. In addition to the two sent by the hotel, a family of three can actually soak in the hot springs twice. The room is very good, but there is a faint smell of smoke, which hurts people like me who are sensitive to the respiratory tract. The hotel is in the middle of the scenic area, so it's very convenient to go everywhere. The hotel’s swimming pool is great, not very deep, and children love it. If you make an appoin**ent, there is a cabinet. You can enter without an appoin**ent, but there is no cabinet. It doesn't matter if you stay in the hotel, put on your bathrobe and go back to your room to take a shower. The breakfast is very rich, just with small cakes😝. In the set meal, one dinner is given every day, and the written meal for two people can't be finished by three people. The scenic area is beautiful, and drinks and snacks are basically at a uniform price. The waiters I met were very polite and enthusiastic. Wandering around the hilltop church, it is very quiet, soothing music makes people relax. The drone show at night is really beautiful and beautiful, you must not miss it. The center of the square is the best place to watch ~ the scenic spot is beautiful, I like it very much, and I don’t have to go around carefully for my own reasons. But it doesn't matter, eleventh is coming again~ during eleven, the hotel does not accept packages with meals and tickets to Simatai, but the system can order them. I have booked it and refunded it, and I can continue to book as soon as I see it. There is no pharmacy in the scenic area! There is no infirmary! The child fell and suffered a little bit of injury, and he couldn't buy medicine.

Swimming pool: The infinity pool is beautiful, with good lighting, good air, and children like it. There are many people in the summer. It is recommended that the staff stay on the high chairs to keep watching in case of accidents.

msg:Ledi parent-child room booked by a family of 2 big, 2 small and 2 children. For reference! The 1.5m+1m bed is put together. The room is spacious. Overall very satisfied. Special thanks to Zhang Yaxin, the service staff at the front desk, for his enthusiasm and professionalism, especially for helping to solve the problem of renewal.
Advantage 1: The toilet, bathroom and toilet are separated. It is more convenient for the sleeping area and the washing area to be separated by a curtain. Turning on the toilet lamp at night will not affect sleep. There are special children's toilet cushions.
Advantage 2: The hotel fee includes 3 tickets, 3 breakfasts and 3 hot spring tickets. There is also the hotel’s infinity pool, which is large and clean, with 4 children’s pools with a slightly higher water temperature.
Advantage 3: The shuttle bus in the park is free, the Great Wall cable car ticket is discounted, and the children's play hall can enter and exit multiple times after purchasing the ticket. The location of the hotel is in the middle and it is very convenient to go everywhere. I didn't use the shuttle bus after staying for a few days.
The most important thing is that you can go back to the hotel to lie down and take a nap whenever you are tired. This is particularly important when the child is relatively small. So it is recommended to stay at the hotel here for at least one night. Tickets are included directly for the first night.

There are 37 to 40 degrees similar to the hot springs, big courage, That’s a twenty-seven-octave suitable for swimming. The children are quite happy to play. The other one is that he has two playgrounds, and children can buy it for fun.

Where is the hotel? Just inside the ancient city, it’s the ancient city as soon as you leave the hotel. It’s very convenient. It’s very convenient to walk around in the ancient city and find something to eat. Moreover, you can also take the cable car to the Great Wall and visit the Great Wall directly.

msg:5/1假期，和孩子同學幾家相約來到古北水鎮，入住古北之光大酒店。古北光大堂經理毛巍巍服務熱情周到，讓人感覺賓至如歸。
節日裏的古北水中人山人海，古北之光竟然房間都住滿了。我們到了之後，毛巍巍立即幫我們安排入住，告訴我們可以去哪裡吃午飯。因為入住的人多，早餐需要分時預約，她還幫我們一行人預約了早餐用餐時間。
返程回到家裡，又收到毛巍巍的微信，原來是充電器忘在房間裏了，她又主動安排第二天給郵寄過來。
很愉快的一次旅途經歷。夜遊了長城，遊覽了水鎮。更因為毛巍巍無微不至的服務，讓這次旅途更加讓人難忘。雖然酒店旺季房費不菲，但因為酒店服務人員有温度的服務，讓人覺得物有所值，不虛此行！

另外，工作日雨天，在酒店外等擺渡車半小時之久，隊伍排得老長，孩子，長者不在少數。擺渡車座位很少，從始發站開出基本兩站就滿員了，到酒店多輛車不停直接甩站，我們在外等的時間實在過於久了，跟門衞小哥哥建議，酒店能否協商直接安排一輛到酒店的擺渡車專線，小哥哥説不行，也沒有任何想解決問題的態度，回覆我們就這樣衹能等。問題是前面兩站也在不斷的有人陸續過來等候，到達酒店站永遠沒有座位。可以説體驗極差，酒店服務跟不上，不知變通。

古北之光的早餐很不錯，建議錯開高峯，這樣可以吃到現烙的煎餅果子和現煮的混沌。
帶小小孩的話，在酒店下面有遊樂區和游泳池。
在小鎮裏走走看小橋流水就行。

msg:環境：在水鎮靠近裏面的位置，不過吃玩都十分方便，免費擺渡車直達門口，正規酒店的設施和服務，有個大無邊泳池，很適合小童戲水，就是對水質要求不能太高。

設施：衞生間乾濕分離，有沙發，兩個洗漱盆，配膠囊咖啡，總體來説硬件齊備。

價格較高，畢竟是酒店管理，和客棧不能相提並論，不過確實物有所值，每次來玩的第一選擇。

帶娃和長者出行，走100米就到中心島，水舞秀音樂噴泉不遠，泡温泉城上更是直線距離衹有200米。中餐廳是目前古北吃過的四五家餐廳中最好吃的，整體出遊超預期。

來之前就有經理聯繫我，問了我的需求和情況，我們是兩間房，本來以為會提前給安排到一個位置好一些的房間，但到了居然給安排去了一個特別遠的2層的房間，本來訂的標間A，最後其實和標間B放在一層，而且重要的是房間裏很冷，見不到陽光，暖氣還不好用，第一天晚上孩子們睡的都不好…第二天一早打電話要求換房間，協調後才給換到3層的南面房間，明顯温度不一樣！
希望酒店還是要將得用不同的房間區分的更明確，而且硬件真的需要更新了！

msg:第一次來古北之光酒店，一次很好的體驗，一對一式的管家服務讓我們全家人感到很貼心，特別感謝這次我們的管家經理佟經理，在我們到達當天上午就聯繫我們，告知我們如何到達酒店的方法，並在大廳等候迎接我們。退房當天我的眼鏡找不到了，也很積極的為我們想辦法，聯繫同事幫助我找眼鏡，借隱形眼鏡，都放我們心裏暖洋洋的。  
由於我們帶了一個一歲半的孩子，特意選擇的親子酒店。在吃住當面我們也十分滿意。小童樂園跟游泳館都很不錯，孩子玩的很開心。酒店在景區內，遊玩也很方便。酒店的其他服務人員也很熱情。
一次很好的遊玩體驗，下次來一定還會選擇古北之光的。

msg:The Light of Gubei is located in the center of the scenic spot, whether you take the shuttle bus to the gate of the water town or walk to the Riyue Island Square or the entrance of the Simatai Great Wall. Friends with a lot of luggage must remember to check the luggage from the P1 parking lot. You can pick it up about 1 hour after the check-in, and the return journey is the same. The hotel lobby is on the 3rd floor of the building and our room was on the top 7th floor. The most important thing in choosing a hotel room type is whether the information obtained is reliable. Here, I would like to commend it. The layout and actual condition of the room can be considered to be completely consistent with the pictures seen on Ctrip. From our guest room, we can directly see the panoramic view of the Great Wall, which can be regarded as a scenery. The hotel has its own swimming pool, and the extra hot spring tickets can be used at the Chengshang Hot Spring Museum behind the hotel. Breakfast is a highlight, with various types, both Chinese food and Western food are of high quality.
It is worth mentioning here that after receiving us, Mr. Tong, the manager of the hotel lobby, specially arranged for us to watch the program of Kongming Lantern from the drone from the rooftop of the hotel. Although you can't hear the music on the square, the perspective from there is unique, and the drone finally landed in front of us, the experience is unforgettable.
In general, it is worth the money to choose Gubei Light to add light and color to our trip to the water town this time. Thank you Mr. Tong and their team!

缺點：所有的服務人員都不會主動跟客人問好。最後一天因怕泡温泉耽誤時間特意跟前台打招呼可能會晚不到一小時退房，服務人員非常不高興的提示我，房間後面還有預訂，請我不要太晚退房。其實我就晚了45分鐘而已。這點感覺不太好。
中性：早餐種類齊全，中規中矩。泳池沒有體驗有點遺憾。
總之，親子游首選，非假期去性價比還是很不錯的。

msg:四年前去過一次，這次週四去，人相對少，酒店經理在我們沒到達前就聯繫了我們，並升級了房間。
服務：小童樂園既有室內也有室外的，室內主要是海洋球，室外的攀爬類設施居多，挺適合4-8歲小朋友
雙人古北水鎮門票:酒店位置在景區中心，非常方便，累了就可以去歇歇腳。

雙人温泉體驗券:温泉衹開了御大，城上沒開，長者孩子怕冷，沒出去泡，不過在酒店大泳池旁的温泉池子泡泡就很好了。晚上去夜遊司馬台長城後特別冷，回來泡了個温泉，舒服多了。
早餐：餄烙麪不錯，孩子很喜歡現做卡夫餅、新鮮蜂蜜（卡夫餅旁）、甜甜圈、蛋撻
整體體驗還是很好！

msg:因為看攻略分享説第一次來首推古北之光，所以我訂的是景區裏面的古北之光，在遊客中心辦理入住、領票、如果需要出入景區可以辦人臉識別，如果不出景區就不用，拿着一個黃色單子去領房卡，最晚15點入住，12點前務必要退房，免費温泉酒店自帶（不限次）、泳池（不限次）、早餐一次（早餐自助很豐盛中西餐都有，時間：7：00～10：00，建議早點去，雖然餐廳會一直補餐，但是有些吃的去晚了就沒有了），真香！！！而且尤其是要去司馬台長城和泡温泉的小夥伴一定要首先考慮這個酒店，真的很方便，它剛好在中間，往上走就是城上温泉和司馬台長城，往下走是日月島，離都不遠，而且它還可以從裏面直接走到城上温泉不用從外面走[捂臉R][捂臉R][捂臉R]我是泡完才知道，凍死我了，酒店7樓有路標我沒看見，去的姐妹一定要問問工作人員，晚上真的冷[哭惹R][哭惹R][哭惹R]古北之光泳池在一層，入住大廳是3層，電梯不能直達，需要在3層換電梯，有標識，泳池旁邊有4個小池子是温泉，泳池水深1.4米，裏面深外面淺，浮力還挺大的，需要穿泳衣、戴泳帽，裏面也有賣的，就是貴。
缺點：酒店是中央空調，所以是統一熱風，我不知道把空調開開了，結果房間温度直接到30度了，給前台打電話，工作人員來的很快，解釋了一下原因，沒辦法衹能開窗開門等太陽下山，才好一些（PS：我們住的是西邊，門口和屋裡温度能差好幾度…）

辦理入住比較慢，一直在打掃消毒中，小朋友困的在大廳沙發睡著了，催了好幾次終於進了房間。
房間不大裡外間，反正就是夠住，僅此而已。房間可以看到長城，夜晚燈光亮起還是挺漂亮的，還可以在房間內看到一點無人機表演，省的出去看了，零下13度的古北真的是分分鐘臉凍僵。
晚餐直接選擇在酒店吃的自助餐，不到400一人，菜品一般般，當天女士半價，小童免費，主要孩子比較小出去吃太冷了人又多還得排隊就直接選擇在酒店吃了方便一些。
早餐我們去的比較早，八點半左右，人還可以不是很多，早餐比晚餐好吃。

提前和酒店説準備了嬰兒床，還是挺不錯的，整體還是挺滿意的，主要是孩子玩的開心。

msg:很好的入住體驗，環境宜人，離景區街很近，離温泉也很近。住房舒適寬敞明亮，長城下來躺在舒服的大床上特別解乏，上下層設計很適合一家四人。酒店乾淨衞生，餐點豐富多彩，服務周到，感謝佟經理全程貼心的服務，還帶我們找了個絕佳的位置看了很棒的無人機表演，特別好，全程旅行很滿意。
