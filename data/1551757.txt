This hotel would have earned 5 stars had the pool been open, the dinner buffet been available and everything had worked in my room. That said, I’ll be back, as I loved it. Immaculate service tops all. Oh: the beds are firm. Not hard, just firm.

msg:Relaxing one night stay with a friend, RSun was a perfect place to chill. 
Thanks to the wonderful service from Turbo, smooth check in and room upgraded to a suite. His spoken English was good and he was very helpful during our stay. 
The suite was huge, beautifully decorated, comfortable and clean. 
We made use of the hot springs and enjoyed our time there. We visited in February so the hotel and springs were not busy. 
Food in the restaurant was delicious local cuisine. We received  special dish as it was the last day of the ***** new year holiday. We communicated using a translator app. 
I would have liked the downstairs bar to be open. 
There was a good breakfast selection which was refilled. 
I would choose to stay here again.

This time yes, Chinese and western buffet breakfast ( 80% Chinese style but very decent) indoor and outdoor swimming pools, hot spring pools, gym (small but good enough) We enjoyed our stay with friendly staffs and clean-comfortable environment.

msg:We had a great time at this hotel. Our rooms were amazing, spacious and comfortable. The beds was perfect as always worry about a hard bed. The quality of the furnishings are high quality in the rooms with lots of lighting options, remote curtains etc and bath with feet and tv to relax in the bath. The tv has English movies which is rare based on our experiences of hotels in China. There is even a cinema with pre downloaded movie options that you can watch with English subtitles and cinema chairs. There are two large pools, one indoor which is really cool with dark lighting and very blue water and one outside which my kids were brave enough to swim in with a view overlooking the lake. The hot springs were hot and relaxing with Tea, milk and sulphur baths. We are in the restaurant for dinner and have good local cuisine as well as breakfast in the morning with western options. The staff hospitality is what set this hotel experience apart as the staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Turbo was fantastic and spoke good English so he could help us with checkin and other requests during the stay. Thanks so much Turbo and your colleagues for a wonderful stay. We will definitely be back. A gem in Wuxi!

msg:We enjoyed our stay here. The suite was huge and really made us comfortable - and being on the 5th floor we had a lovely view too.
Breakfast was perfectly adequate - fruit, yoghurt, a few pastries, bread, eggs, bacon, sausages, baked beans, and the usual Chinese fare.
The pools and hot springs were lovely too but limited shade at the pools. Because both outdoor pools are completely uncovered, you're swimming in luke warm water by 10am. There is also limited seating - with metal chairs, mostly left in the sun. More shade would make it even better. But the pools are clean and we loved our swimming time. The other thing I found annoying - the hotel is not cheap but you still have to pay an additional fee to rent the floaties - this would be a lovely free thing.
Lunch was reasonable - only a limited choice of Chinese dishes. Dumplings and sweet and sour pork were delicious. Dinner was a bit disappointing. Very few dishes available, otherwise only barbecue. The meat offered was quite fatty and overpriced. Beer was well priced but could have been colder.
Staff were friendly and helpful although no English, so if you can't speak Chinese, this will make it difficult.
We will stay again.

msg:From check-in to checkout, the staff was amazing! We stayed in a villa for a few nights so after check-in, the driver took us by small car to the villa. At check-in I received an afternoon tea so we enjoyed our little snacks and tea. The villas have an easy walking path to go into the main building to eat, play chess, play pool, or go swimming and hot springs. The kids enjoyed the playground. There isn’t much in the area but it’s close to the Giant Buddha (12 minute Didi/car ride) Room service or a dinner buffet are both available for dinner. Be mindful that room service is only available until 8p Sunday through Thursday. Breakfast was included with my stay so it was very convenient from 7a-10a. Grounds were well manicured. The only drawback staying in the villa was that you are supposed to go past the pool to register to go in the pool area.

The hotel has the feel of a castle, beautifully decorated and perfectly kept. The staff are really lovely and attentive, especially Carrie Wen, who took my WeChat and made sure I had everything I needed. 

The Queen hotsprings room is beautifully decorated, with a private hot spring, that can be filled anytime you like. The bed is extremely comfortable and the design of the room makes you feel like royalty. 

The Western food was absolutely delicious and fresh. The breakfast had more Western options, than most other 5 star hotels I have stayed at. 

I highly recommend this hotel, as it is an absolute treat to relax and unwind in the hot springs and enjoy the class and elegance. The soothing music around the hotel adds to the peaceful ambience.

msg:Wonderful hotel with first class service. I stayed in a queen room with private hot spring which gave me my own garden overlooking the lake. The room is small but beautifully decorated and comfortable. I was met by Carrie Wen on arrival and she literally went above and beyond to provide me with the first class service. She took my WeChat and kept in contact checking I had everything I wanted and when. She timed the hot spring fils; found me English films to watch in their on-site cinema; provided me with fruit platters and cold drinks after I’d been out in the heat all day. I enjoyed their bayberry afternoon tea and there were many mosquitoes outside due to the time of year. They immediately brought spray for me and then gifted me a bag of spray and lotion for any bites. There are many facilities on site; it’s close to all the sites in the scenic area and a great place. The only two negatives of my stay were: the water pressure is quite low in the private spring rooms so your shower will take a while if you have long or thick hair. My burger was raw and when I sent it back to be cooked through it returned within 2 minutes in the same cut bun and sides (so fries were cold)- clearly had been dropped in the deep fryer to cook it and not re-dressed it- shoddy for a 5* hotel in my opinion. The Chinese food I had there is varied and excellent so I’d suggest you stick with that.

The hotel has complete entertainment and leisure facilities, including indoor and outdoor swimming pools (the indoor swimming pool is heated), gym, starry sky cinema, sauna room, children's playroom, hot springs, 6-7 hot spring pools, and one hot spring pool where you can play mahjong. It's so creative! There is an exclusive children's paddling pool. The hotel service staff is very enthusiastic, especially Xiao Yang, who actively introduces the hotel facilities to guests and answers all questions. The hotel took the initiative to upgrade my room. The garden view suite is spacious and gorgeous, which is amazing! A gift was also given when I left. It is suitable for parent-child travel and also for retreat and leisure. Taihu Lake is opposite the hotel, and you can take a walk along the road. The famous scenic spot Lingshan Shengjing is nearby, and there is also a place where you can hike and overlook the Lingshan Giant Buddha without tickets: Guanzhang Ancient Road. Those who are physically fit can try it.

The room type was upgraded when checking in, and souvenirs were given when checking out. Some needs during the stay were also responded to quickly. The children also had a lot of fun in the outdoor swimming pool. The only thing that needs to be improved is the breakfast and evening buffet. It may be because the hotel has few rooms and the number of people is limited, resulting in fewer categories and the quality of the dishes is relatively average. Consider a good and refined combination, and a slight increase in the price is not unacceptable.

msg:The most surprising thing about this trip to Jiangnan is the joy that the hotel brought us😄. After getting off the Wuxi high-speed rail, taxis and online ride-hailing almost made me angry😡. I instantly felt discouraged and wanted to terminate the trip. Fortunately, I met an uncle from the Northeast who enthusiastically sent me to the hotel. The guy at the front desk saw that we had a lot of luggage and we were shivering from the cold, so he upgraded the room for free. The moment we opened the door, wow🎊 came our surprise - we were so happy and excited. A big house of more than 130 square meters, unexpected surprises swept away the depression, anger and anger. The extra large space, the comfortable big bed, the European-style large balcony, and the Taihu Lake in front is waving to us👏. My friends can't help but lie down in the hotel. Every second is a happy thing, hahaha. The hotel also warmly provided two oversized fruit plates. The breakfast ingredients were fresh and rich. The waiters were warm and thoughtful, very warm and touching😹. It was a little regretful that I missed the outdoor hot spring due to the cold weather. I hope that when spring comes, I will have the opportunity to go to the hotel to enjoy it again. [A little suggestion: It’s time to replace your hair dryer]. ㊗️The hotel’s business is getting better and better, and the money is rolling in. Special thanks to the hotel for its service this time❤️❤️❤️

The hotel is right next to Taihu Lake, with beautiful scenery. It is very pleasant to take a walk along the lake in the morning.
The hotel facilities are very new and very hygienic. The best thing is the hotel staff. They are very enthusiastic. When Xiao Yu at the front desk saw that we had children and elderly people, he took the initiative to upgrade us to a large suite. The large terrace faces Taihu Lake. He also helped us add breakfast for one person. Thank you🙏
My parents said they would choose this hotel next time they come and stay for a few more days.

The hot spring water washes away the dust, and the light rain and plum blossoms are both suitable.

Hongyang Rockfield Garden Hotel is the right choice. It is located by the Taihu Lake, with a beautiful environment, clean and sanitary villas, and the key is that the hot spring experience is particularly good! There are not many people during the Spring Festival holiday! The food in the hotel is also OK! In short, it was a pretty good trip! Very good!

Traveling and staying with my family, I would like to thank Xiao Yu at the front desk for his patience and thoughtfulness, and his help in upgrading the room and staying there for two days. The hotel is on the edge of Taihu Lake, very close to the Lingshan Giant Buddha and Nianhua Bay. When you are tired from sightseeing, you can go back to the hotel and soak in the hot springs.

msg:This time, I went to Lingshan Buddha to burn incense on the first day of the Chinese New Year, and went to Nianhua Bay on the second day of the Chinese New Year. I booked a hotel for 2 nights. The hotel is not far from the scenic spots and dining areas. I didn't expect that the hotel service was so good during the Chinese New Year. The front desk brother, the electric car driver, the cleaning aunt and uncle, the staff who exchanged afternoon tea, and the front desk of the hot spring hall all provided thoughtful service and met all the needs of the guests attentively and considerately. The villa area booked this time can park the car at the door, which is very convenient to take the luggage. It takes 1 or 2 minutes to call the electric car to the lobby. The car comes. The breakfast is also very rich and replenished in time. There are 10 pools in the hot spring, and there are not many people. If the family soaks, no one else will come, just like the private hot spring booked. In the evening, you can drive a few minutes to Qianbo Bridge to set off fireworks. It is suitable for worshiping Buddha, playing, and vacationing.

msg:It looks like a fairy tale castle, so beautiful. It's very close to Taihu Lake. You can go for a walk by the lake. It's very well decorated, has a large room, and is very cost-effective. The hotel's hot spring feels a bit small, maybe because there are too many people celebrating the New Year.
The disadvantage is that the design is not very reasonable. The bathroom in the suite has to go through the living room to the porch and then enter. It is very troublesome to get up at night. The dressing room in the hot spring is a bit dirty and messy, and the plastic slippers do not feel dry.

Seeing as our family of three, we got an extra hot spring ticket and breakfast. After climbing Lingshan Mountain, I went back to the hotel to soak in a hot spring to relieve fatigue. It was very comfortable. The most heartwarming thing is that when I had dinner at the hotel restaurant, I found out that someone had a birthday that day and they were given a bowl of birthday noodles for free. All the waiters I met had very good attitudes. The room environment is also large and comfortable.

It is quite close to the Lingshan Giant Buddha, so it is more suitable for self-driving travel. If you take a taxi, it may take a while. Overall it's still very good, with no flaws.

Two waterproof power sockets are installed on the terrace, so you can work outdoors or make tea and take a nap. In short, I will continue to visit Hongyang Rockfield Garden Hotel next time.

There are several areas that can be improved: 1. It would be better if the hotel rooms are equipped with children's toiletries and slippers and bathrobes; 2. Family hotels should be an important development direction of the hotel (because of the location, it is impossible to be a business hotel) ), then there are too few parent-child projects, so we need to use more brains to make parent-child features; 3. Although hot springs are not natural hot springs, as special projects, we must pay attention to quality improvement. Some hot spring pools are generally hygienic, and there are too few hot spring pools. Use your brain again. In short, I hope to further improve it and make it a small but refined, small and beautiful boutique hotel.

This time I went to Wuxi Taihu Lake for vacation on November 1, and I chose this hotel online. The hotel is located in Hongyang, west of Wuxi, close to popular attractions such as Lingshan Giant Buddha and Nianhua Bay. It also has incomparable views of Taihu Lake and you can even see Yuantouzhu's fireworks from a distance. But compared to the crowded popular attractions in the central area of ​​Wuxi, this place is relatively quiet, making it a good place for a holiday away from the crowds.

The hotel consists of a European palace-style lobby area and many independent villas. Whether it is a room in the lobby area or a room in an independent villa area, the space is large and luxuriously decorated.

On this trip, I wanted to experience rural life, and more people traveling with me chose villa rooms, so the whole family stayed in one villa. Each independent villa here has a large garden, the villa suites have balconies, and there is a common living room area with a fireplace and sofa on the ground floor of the villa. The children had a great time playing hide and seek inside. There is a hotel battery car to pick you up from the villa area to the lobby area, which is very convenient.

There are various leisure and entertainment facilities in the lobby area, including various restaurants, starry sky cinema, billiards, hot springs, indoor and outdoor swimming, fitness and small parent-child animal areas. Basically, you can think of holiday entertainment. Breakfast is also rich in variety and you can taste Wuxi's special steamed buns.

Special thanks to the front desk staff, Ms. Yang and Mr. Yu, for being very warm, friendly and thoughtful, and working tirelessly to meet our various needs.

All in all, this hotel left a very good impression on me and is a recommended holiday destination.

We braved heavy rain all the way to get here and found out that the hot springs were temporarily closed due to maintenance and other reasons. At that time, our mood hit rock bottom, and the guy at the front desk immediately upgraded us to a family suite to make our mother and daughter stay more comfortable to make up for our regret, and also gave us exquisite gifts. Dinner was at the restaurant on the first floor, the price was not expensive, and the Wuxi pork ribs tasted good. My biggest impression of the entire hotel is that although there are not many guests, the working attitude of the staff is warm and polite. The guy at the front desk, the two ladies at the pool front desk, and the restaurant staff, although the schedule was a bit rushed, they left me a good impression. Very impressed. Thank you to the staff for their enthusiasm and dedication, thank you🙏! In addition, I especially like the outdoor infinity pool, I like it very much!

If you are afraid of getting sunburned, you can stay in the indoor swimming pool or the gym Exercising, is simply awesome. Although it is not a newly opened hotel, it can be seen that the maintenance is very good. The room is clean and tidy, the breakfast is rich and varied, and the service staff are also very enthusiastic. The front desk even provided me with makeup remover wipes and contact lens care solution. This vacation is really leisurely Leisurely, wait until the summer vacation to bring your children to play in the infinity pool!

After searching for a long time on Ctrip, I found that this hotel met the requirements, so I placed an order immediately. Unexpectedly, the satisfaction after checking in exceeded expectations. This hotel has complete facilities, including hot springs, swimming pools, tents, billiards, and theaters. The breakfast has many varieties and good quality. Dinner is a buffet, 299 yuan/2 people, there are fresh barbecue, very cost-effective. The hotel service is super good, regardless of the front desk manager, restaurant manager or waiter, all smiles, thoughtful and meticulous service. What is even more surprising is that the room type was upgraded for us. The room is super large, estimated to be more than 60 square meters, and has a balcony. There is also a gift box of zongzi, which is really very warm. The location of the hotel is also very good, facing Taihu Lake, spring is warm and flowers are blooming, next time I will come with my family and friends💌🧚🏼♀️🌳

The room facilities are a little outdated, but fortunately The bar inside is very practical, and the overall hotel looks like a holiday, because it is right on the edge of Taihu Lake, with beautiful scenery and a relatively remote location.

The indoor and outdoor swimming pools, hot springs, buffets, and theaters are all very good, but because there are a lot of mosquitoes in the mountains, everyone should take precautions in advance.
In particular, the category of the hotel's buffet breakfast is average, but the Wuxi Xiaolong is really good.

The food and beverages are generally acceptable. After staying for two days, the first day is a weekend breakfast buffet, which is enough for me personally, but there are still few choices in terms of five-star standards; The meal is served, but it is understandable, maybe there are not many guests, so the cost is reduced
The room is really nothing to say because the room type has been upgraded. Two people just lived in a quadruple room. The hotel is located in the suburbs, so it is really quiet. It is very suitable for me who just finished a busy weekend. I feel that I can stay in the room all day because of the Too tired, did not experience hot springs
It can be seen that the hotel has been renovated for a long time, the underground parking lot is not big, and later it needs to be charged and parked on the ground, but one of the two charging piles is broken😓

The wall core is good, but the soundproofing of the doors and windows is a bit poor. The main reason is that some guests get up early in the morning and go out early, and the voices in the corridor can be heard. The restaurant's dishes can be more abundant, and the grade should be improved a little bit
Let's talk about the advantages: the service is very good, the staff are very enthusiastic, and they can solve any needs in the first time. I celebrated my 40th birthday in April, and I was given a 6-inch cake, which is delicious. Ha ha.
Basic hardware is available, such as heated swimming pool, infinity pool, gym, movie room, restaurant, hot spring, peacock feeding, fishing, and cycling. But maybe because of its small footprint, the above facilities are a little bit smaller.
The scenery is good, next to Taihu Lake. Sightlines are good.
The price on May Day is a bit high, but usually this price is really worth it.

msg:The room has been upgraded, it is quite big, and I like the high floor, which makes people feel comfortable. All aspects of hygiene are in place.

I could have given a five-point evaluation, but the TV and the remote control have nothing to do with it. I called the front desk and said that I asked my aunt to take a look. After waiting for about 20 minutes, I came after the second call to ask.
Even when it came, it didn’t work. I asked her if the batteries in the remote control were gone?
She left again to get the battery. It doesn't work too well.
Five-star service, keep customers waiting for half an hour? No results yet.

The breakfast restaurant has a good outside environment, but the inside is still stylish, at least the floor does not have the usual greasy feeling.
The ratio of Chinese-style dim sum to Western-style dim sum is roughly half and half.
Regrettably: no cheese, no vinaigrette (asked the waiter and he pointed to the noodle bar, meaning to get the vinegar there. Well I give up on salad with vinaigrette),
I only chose the basic rye slices for the bread, and other breads have nothing to do with the hotel's main "French style", and it should not have much to do with the "five-star" style. It should be the basic money purchased from outside.

With bread, it is naturally milk. In general Chinese hotels, I don't dare to drink milk for fear of upset stomach.
The French five-star makes me have the courage to get milk.
I saw a lot of fried food in the middle. I didn't take it.

Those who were about to drink some tea started to mutter in their stomachs, so they had to leave before their peers and hurried to the room. When I left, I happened to find that they were adding milk. Looking at the packaging, it turned out that it was from Mengniu.
Okay I'm sorry.

I believe in "French five-star",
"French five-star", but let me stay in the bathroom for half an hour, and then I went to the bathroom three times in the next hour.

The trees outside the window are so green, there is wind and birds chirping. Pretty sweet.
It's just that my stomach doesn't allow me to go to any scenic spots -- Wuxi is here for nothing.

One more thing to add: the variety and quality of breakfast should not have reached the advertised standard (RMB amount, or "French five-star"), maybe there are few people today?

msg:The service of the hotel is very good. When we checked in, the front desk helped us upgrade the room to a balcony room with lake view. The room was large and comfortable. Because I am a vegetarian, the staff in the cafeteria enthusiastically introduced vegetarian dim sum to me, very thoughtful. The open-air hot spring is open until ten o'clock in the evening. There is also a heated swimming pool and a movie theater where you can lie down and watch, which is very suitable for vacation. The hotel is adjacent to Taihu Lake, very close to Lingshan Giant Buddha and Nianhua Bay, ten minutes by car.

msg:I booked a temporary trip, and I accidentally saw this hotel. The hotel has a hot spring, so I decided to take a bath at the end of winter. The location of the hotel is relatively remote, which is more suitable for self-driving tours. If you don’t have a car, it’s best to book a car in advance, so that you won’t be embarrassed. Besides, the environment of the hotel is really good, surrounded by mountains and rivers, and the air is fresh. When I arrived at the hotel on the day of check-in, the lady at the front desk saw that we were two adults and one child, and very politely upgraded our room to a suite, and the children's breakfast was also reduced. After introducing the environment, we asked the shuttle bus to take us to the room. The hotel room was very clean, the bed in the suite was big, the toilet was spacious, there was a jacuzzi, and the scenery outside the window was good. Unfortunately, it was raining for two days, so we couldn’t sit on the balcony Enjoy the scenery. The hotel also rents entertainment facilities, which can satisfy entertainment and leisure needs. Hot springs, swimming pools, and gyms are on the B1 floor. The changing rooms are very clean. The hot springs are basically for hotel guests, so there are not too many people. There are 7 soup pools in total. Three people a pool, very comfortable. Because the seats are relatively remote, I basically eat at the hotel. Breakfast is a buffet. Although there are not many styles, the taste is not bad. Dinner is not bad if you order it every day. Especially when you order food, the taste is really good and the ingredients are fresh. If I have the opportunity to drive in Wuxi again in the future, I should still choose it. In addition, the service staff of the hotel are very polite and enthusiastic. At the beginning of the second day, I couldn't book a car to go to the scenic spots, but the lobby manager contacted me for a car, which was really good.

msg:The layout of the hotel room is what I am most satisfied with, with great a**osphere and complete functional rooms. The capsule coffee machine is a pleasant surprise for people like me who cannot live without a cup of coffee every day. On the first night, I chose to have a buffet at the hotel in order to keep my spirit up. The fried lamb chops and Buddha jumping over the wall are at the level of a star hotel. After eating in the scenic spot for the next few days, I felt that this choice was too wise. It is recommended to bring a bathrobe in the room for hot springs, otherwise it will be a bit cold, and their hot spring areas are distributed in different directions. In addition, I would like to praise the front desk staff, the service is very warm, and they can consider the personal feelings of customers. There are two suggestions: the quality of housekeeping needs to be improved. I don’t know if there is a shortage of staff during the Spring Festival. The quilt was not folded for cleaning the room, and the toilet paper was not put out. The breakfast is not particularly rich. After eating on the first day, the next day There is no choice.

First of all, check in, check in at 3:00 pm, because the booked room includes breakfast for 2 people, the handsome guy at the front desk saw that I brought a child with him and he was not taller than 1.4 meters, and directly gave the child breakfast for 2 days , this service gives extra points. The room is quite big and clean. The big bed room is completely OK for our family of three. The hotel is only 10 minutes away from Lingshan Mountain and Nianhua Bay. It is just beside Taihu Lake. It is very quiet and convenient. The next night, because I wanted to order food in the hotel restaurant, I went straight to the first floor. The hotel leaders and chefs were at the entrance of the restaurant. They said that there was only 198 people in the buffet at night. I said that I originally wanted to order food, but then let me see I took a look at the buffet meals, and they were also very good. There were lamb skewers, whitebait, scrambled eggs, lamb skewers, prawn cakes, ice cream and drinks, so I ordered and ate at the buffet. The hotel leaders didn’t have to say anything about the service, and they directly waived the children’s meal Fei, just because of this experience, I am very happy with this stay. It would be perfect if the sound of the air conditioner could be made smaller💪

I feel that the service is impeccable. There is only one word: slow! On the first day of check-in, when we arrived at the hotel at 15:00, we were told that it hadn't been cleaned yet, but the staff was very enthusiastic and took us to their own cinema to watch a movie. The second is that the room on the first floor can't drain at night. After we took a shower, the water couldn't flow out. It made the bathroom look like fish farming, and the toilet couldn't be flushed. I thought the sewer was clogged, but it cleared up automatically the next morning , It is estimated that the relationship between the first floor, the drainage is too slow.

📌Location: The location of the hotel is right by the Taihu Lake. The road around the lake is right out of the door. A cycling path has been built beside the driveway. The hotel has bicycles for rent. You can go around Mashan along the lake road, and there are many village farms and orchards in the middle, which is very fun.
📌Hotel facilities: The hotel itself is very beautiful. There is an outdoor infinity swimming pool, an indoor heated swimming pool, and many outdoor small hot spring pools. The water quality is quite clean. We came to the hot springs on the first night, and the next morning, we found that they had cleaned the water in the pool, and put in new water before opening in the afternoon! It's really important! Children like hot spring pools so much, they run around one by one, although the height is just over one meter, but the height of the hot spring water reaches the waist, which is very safe.
📌 The service should be praised well, and everyone you meet in the hotel greets you with a smile. Special thanks to Xiaojie and Xiaoyue at the front desk, who took good care of us and really felt at home. There is also the attentive and considerate aunt in the hot spring locker room, and the gentleman who met in the lobby after ten o'clock in the evening. The child wanted to go for a walk, and he took the initiative to lead us to find a way. The child was so happy! The lady at the front desk of the hot spring pool learned that we had checked out, but took care of the children's needs very carefully and took the initiative to help us arrange. Anyway, really happy. The children have stayed in many hotels since childhood, but this time they told us to come again next time, just remember this hotel 🤣

The private soup is really fragrant~ After you check in, a dedicated service staff will take you to the private soup hut🛖, there are four in total, if you go early, you can choose the one you like (there are some differences in the yard). You can choose your own "soup base" and heat it up until 10pm. If you go early, you can take a bubble first and then go out for a walk. The vicinity of the hotel is relatively deserted, and it is more convenient to drive by yourself. You can go to Nianhua Bay for a stroll at night, and the next morning you can go to Lingshan Giant Buddha for a stroll. The service staff, Xiao Yin, will be very thoughtful and will ask if you need to add towels and mineral water in the room. I have stayed at Nianhua Inn and Paramito before, and next time I come, I will definitely choose to stay here and take a hot spring♨️

I originally booked a villa suite, but later found that it was a little distance away from the swimming and hot springs, and the temperature was lowered for fear that the baby would catch cold when entering and leaving. The staff upgraded the suite for us for free. During this period, we responded that the air conditioner was not cold, and the small room was a little stuffy, and we were willing to change the room for us again.

Here I want to talk about the hotel's evening buffet, 158 per person, but the dishes are a bit expensive compared to other hotels, because there are not many dishes, I think it is not worth it. The breakfast is also self-service, but unfortunately there are no small wontons, only rice noodles. Compared with other hotels, the dishes are a little less.
In addition, the indoor children's playground on the 2nd floor is very small, and I personally feel that the hygiene is not done well, and the corners are a bit dirty. There are no sanitizers. Improvement is recommended.

The hotel has a place to soak in hot springs, and my aunt was there, and I didn't go to the medical examination, but my husband feedback that it was ok.

In general, some hardware facilities of the hotel need to be improved, and the staff service is very good, which makes people feel very warm.

The environment outside the private soup room is a picture of the world. Enjoying the scenery while soaking in the soup, drinking red wine is simply a beautiful thing in the world.
In terms of facilities, the hotel has a variety of infinity swimming pools, gyms, and hot springs. I chose this place because of its unique geographical environment, surrounded by mountains and waters, which is very beautiful.
The service is also very attentive, call the front desk to ask for the items and they can be delivered. There is also a special praise for Xiao Yi, who showed us various detailed introductions to the hotel from the beginning to when we got lost and took us back to our room several times, and also responded to all requests. Such service, will definitely choose here again next time!

When I was brushing dy, I saw that I could take a hot spring here and booked it for one night.
Thinking about taking a break in the hot springs
When I get here, I feel amazing
It's been sunny every day recently, it's a plus for the landscape
Lush green plants, sparkling fountains ⛲️
Classic car-style shuttle bus with crystal lights in the lobby
all attracted me
The check-in staff put the garden view set I ordered
Upgraded to Garden View Balcony Set
The room is very large, about 80 square meters, and the facilities are also very complete
Accidentally found that Xiaomi's hair dryer is also very useful
Hair is not particularly frizzy after blow-drying
He has two outdoor swimming pools
A shallower one is for children to play with
The infinity pool will be deeper
because of the recent hot weather
High water temperature day and night
Although it is very comfortable to go into the water, it is impossible to swim after two laps.
Indoor swimming pool water temperature is relatively low
Although it was a little shaky at first
But go down
The outdoor hot springs ♨️ are also great, there are even those who can play mahjong 🀄️ haha
I feel like it must be great here in winter
To be honest I'm not bored at all staying here for two or three days!
This is really the most cost-effective and happy hotel I have stayed in this year!

Hygiene: As soon as I entered the room, I found an empty mineral water bottle outside the balcony, which was filled with cigarette butts. I looked at the balconies of several houses nearby. It was obvious that this was left by the previous guest. However, the cleaning lady Didn't clean quickly
Environment: I can only say that the appearance of the hotel is okay, but the in-room equipment and public areas in the lobby are very ordinary. It can even be said to be old.
Service: Maybe it was too busy during the Chinese New Year, so I didn’t feel too enthusiastic about the service. I can only say that it was a process-oriented service experience.
Facilities: There are no warnings on the steps next to the hot spring swimming pool⚠️No warnings⚠️No warnings⚠️
That day, my husband accidentally stepped on his heel, which caused it to bleed and cause a big bruise. As a result, he ended up in the hot spring without even taking a dip that day. Although the service staff quickly asked about the situation and brought a band-aid, but for our family, The hot spring experience is very bad. After all, it cost 128 yuan per person. In the end, I just took a shower and went back to the room (I didn’t dare to take a bath because I was afraid of infecting the wound). I hope the store can put some obvious signs on the steps. There are warning stickers to prevent future customers from accidentally falling down. Fortunately, we are young, but it would be terrible if an elderly person touches it.

The soup house I booked, although the room is a bit smaller than expected, but the environment is very good, I feel like I am in nature and enjoy a privately customized open-air hot spring. The housekeeper Xiao Yin is very caring and the service is in place. I am very grateful for the careful care for three days and two nights. Will come again sometime in the future.

Considering the diversity of the tour, I finally chose Rockefeller. Sure enough, it did not disappoint, a garden castle-like experience. The hot spring featured in the hotel is another wonderful feeling. Xiao Yan, the housekeeper of the hot spring house, used the best service to make us want to go again. The rose hot spring specially changed for us the next day was very beautiful, and we couldn’t help but soak it again. once. Overall the right choice

The inspection work is serious and responsible. It also upgraded the suite with a balcony for free. I like it! The hotel has an elegant and quiet environment, beautiful garden buildings, spacious and bright rooms, and comfortable and soft bedding. There is also a capsule coffee machine in the room, and the freshly made coffee fills the space. The hot spring water temperature of the hotel is moderate and high, and there are few guests who do not interfere with each other. Due to the small number of guests in the hotel for epidemic prevention and control, the buffet was cancelled for breakfast, but there are still quite a few varieties of Chinese and Western breakfasts, which are very delicious. Especially the freshly baked bacon is delicious! There will be a chance to go on vacation again...

We arrived a little early, and the room didn't come out, so we went to Guzhu Road to find a restaurant for dinner. After we finished eating, we went to the first floor to watch a movie for a while, and called us to get a room. The big bed room was very big. The water temperature of the swimming pool was cold, even after swimming for a while, it still couldn't work, and then it was a little shivering. What's even colder is going from the swimming pool to the outdoor hot spring in the wet. There is no block on the road, and there is no heating equipment. When the wind blows, the rain falls, and it freezes in an instant. I have already told the staff and hope to improve. The service attitude is really good and very good. The suite comes standard with 2 breakfast and 2 temperature. Knowing the four of us, we specially sent the old and small breakfast and hot spring. Next time the weather is warmer and the price is cheaper, let's go again, it's still a bit embarrassing during the Spring Festival.

After arriving at the hotel, the front desk very enthusiastically gave me a room in the main building where the front desk is located. At the beginning, the reason why I chose the big bed room in the villa area is because it is in the villa area, and the living experience is a little more unique. I opened the door with the mentality of having a look first, and then changing it back, and then... I am very satisfied! Later, I inquired about the front desk, and the room I changed was an executive balcony suite, which was great👍🏻

The variety of breakfast is not diverse, but you can only choose to eat butter toast ➕ milk, which is suitable for the breakfast of elderly tour groups. The shower in the bathroom that I stayed in this time was like a decoration. The shower head was so big that it was blocked, and only two or three holes came out. In order to upgrade the toilet, the toilet was replaced with a smart toilet. At first, I thought it was broken. It turned out that there was no signal at the remote control position and there was no response. I had to take it out and press it. When the balcony is opened, there is actually a pile of scaffolding simple houses downstairs, which is too unpleasant. The room is still hard-packed. It should be the hotel for a long time.

🌻Location and traffic:
The hotel is located in the Mashan area on the outskirts of Wuxi, close to the Lingshan Giant Buddha and Nianhua Bay. The hotel shop is built against the mountain and faces Taihu Lake. If you don't go to the scenic spot, it is also a good choice to watch Taihu Lake. Along the road, there is the "Ten Mile Pearl Embankment", with trails set up, it is very pleasant to walk around.

🌻Room facilities:
The hotel is a European-style building, very beautiful, and the garden is also big. Upgraded the room and stayed in a luxurious balcony suite, which is spacious and fully equipped. The bar has a coffee machine, tea bags, and drinks in the refrigerator are free. The room is divided into a living room and a bedroom area, the curtains are remote control, and there is a dressing table beside the bed, which is very intimate. The bathroom is connected to the dressing area and has a large area. There is a luxurious entrance hall at the entrance, and the overall feeling is comfortable.

🌻Service:
The service staff are enthusiastic and responsible. Being responsive to the requests of guests, I feel at home. Special thanks to the little brother Yang Qianfu at the front desk, who is so caring and answers every question. He took the initiative to plan a play plan for me and was moved.

🌻 Cost performance:
The highlight of the hotel is the hot spring, there are 7 pools in total, with various flavors. The temperature is adjusted between 38-42 degrees, which is very comfortable. There is a steaming room by the pool with a stone bed and water flow under the bed, which is natural and healthy.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good, right on the edge of Taihu Lake, and the environment is beautiful. There is an infinity swimming pool outside, which complements the baroque architectural style hotel. There are not many hot spring pools, but the advantage is that there are few people. The hardware of the hotel is quite luxurious, with beautiful views everywhere. I thought it was not a chain hotel, and the management would be close. I didn't expect a surprise. The double bed room was gone. The front desk took the initiative to help us upgrade the garden-view balcony suite, and would call us about our stay experience. Except for the restaurant's cooking skills to be improved, there is nothing wrong with it. It is a hotel worth visiting!

My friends said it was bigger than the suites they had stayed in in Macau hotels, with a spacious balcony, living room, kitchen, cloakroom, dressing room, and floor-to-ceiling windows. The scenery is very good. In the morning, you can see the sunrise on Taihu Lake by opening the curtains. Although there are not many open-air hot spring pools, there are not many people. You can also play mahjong while soaking; this is a good place under the current epidemic situation. Vacation place.

The European-style building is very beautiful. It happened to be mid-week. There were no people. The lady at the front desk thoughtfully upgraded us to the family suite. The room was very pleasant, with bathtub, cloakroom, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Very good, full of autumn flavor. After staying for two days, I visited Nianhua Bay, Lingshan Giant Buddha, and soaked in hot springs. The front desk service of the hotel is also very attentive.

msg:The most perfect hotel on the National Day trip. I saw bad reviews when I made a reservation. I almost missed it when I was not an international chain hotel. The hardware of the hotel was very good, and the software service was not bad. It was much better than Shimao’s. My laptop was left in the room. I remembered it for three days. I tried to call the front desk but I didn’t expect to find it. I must go to the second brush for support. The breakfast is also very good. The key price is super high! To be honest, spending some money on Xiaohongshu to grow grass is definitely an Internet celebrity. It is estimated that the price of National Day is not too expensive because of little publicity. The hot springs are amazing, the hot springs with various functions, and the infinity swimming pool are also very nice. The baby had the happiest two days in the hotel. I temporarily decided to stay for one night. It is not too beautiful to go to Nianhua Bay at night. Other environments Please see the picture
[Parent-child facilities] There are infinity pool and bubble pool, the best choice for parent-child
[Lake View Room] Upon check-in, I upgraded to a garden-view suite, which is simply luxurious
[Hot spring hot spring pool] It is very good, I miss it very much, I have already recommended it to my friends and recommended it in a certain book
🔔Service: Very enthusiastic, and the little things that are lost can be retrieved. The service quality is excellent.

It is suitable for parent-child holiday, and strive for the second brush.

Thinking that the hotel is doing well in all aspects, I quickly patted it before leaving. Some photos are messy but the price is real. The price is less than 1,000. The large flat-floor luxury package of more than 130 square meters is perfect to spend a weekend with family and children. Breakfast and dinner are quite satisfactory. There are a few indoors and outdoors. The big swimming pool is really a perfect match for summer. In addition to the seven hot springs in the evening, it is enough to receive a happy weekend for parents and children. I am satisfied, and I will go if I have the opportunity. The surrounding lakes and mountains are very beautiful.

The hot spring soup house arranged for parents has a beautiful environment and is close to nature. The staff of the soup house are also very warm and thoughtful. Thank you very much if any problems can be solved in time. The rose sea salt soup I ordered also prepared a large portion of rose petals, which was super beautiful. After soaking, the skin on the body is slippery.
The Wuxi local dishes cooked by the chef in the restaurant are very authentic, and I recommend everyone to try it. The iced crayfish, Taihu white fish, dried bamboo shoots and roasted pork are all very good.
The only downside is that there is no USB port in the room. It has been ten years since the hotel opened. I don't feel that it is very old.
The staff is attentive and warm, the dishes are delicious, the hot springs are comfortable, and the swimming is fun, all of which make up for the shortcomings of other small details.
Waiting for the autumn and winter to go again, the hot springs still have to be perfect in winter.

That's right, it is an attraction! Baroque-style hotel, the whole area is good for looking, shopping, and fun. The parent-child suite has 2 bedrooms and 1 living room. Parents, children, young couples, a family of five can stay perfectly. All kinds of toys in the room are very popular with Beibei.

The manager Yang Jie is very enthusiastic and patient. He also helped the baby celebrating his first birthday in preparation for his birthday. Cakes and small gifts are so sweet! Thank you~ Perfect memories, I regret not staying for a few more days, I will stay decisively next time!

msg:The hotel is in a good location, suitable for driving families. It is right by the Taihu Lake. If you have nothing to do, you can come out and take a look at the scenery. There are parking spaces in front of the hotel and underground. It was too hot, so we parked underground. The underground is a bit damp. This is also no way. We ordered the little yellow duck parent-child room, 150 square meters, which is really big enough. There is also a study room, a room for changing shoes, and two toilets. Only on the second floor, the scenery is completely blocked by trees. But the stay is very comfortable. The water temperature of the indoor swimming pool is too cold this day, so I can only choose outdoor. It is recommended to go at night. The water temperature is very comfortable, not cold at all, and it is very warm. Swimming is especially fun. Those who like bathing can choose bathing. Breakfast here is average. Our room can accommodate four people, and only two breakfasts are provided. With two additional breakfasts, I think the price of 128 is a bit high. In addition, the waiter on the ground floor has a lovely smile and a very gentle attitude. I am a girl who likes her very much! Give it a thumbs up! The starry sky audio-visual room downstairs is pretty good. You can play movies at will. The seats are very comfortable and you can enjoy the feeling of a movie theater. In addition to the musty smell in the underground, it is recommended to place an air purifier to improve it. The overall hotel is still in the middle, with some characteristics, and children want to come to play in the future.

The hotel has indoor and outdoor double swimming pools, children's pools, and a dozen hot springs.
The hotel staff are very enthusiastic, especially Xinyu at the front desk, knowing that we are the three big and one small, a special breakfast, dinner was also eaten in the restaurant, the taste is very good, and also presented a fruit plate.

msg:The water of Taihu Lake is like a vast ocean surging in my heart, spreading away. It also seems to be the origin of a thousand-year-old culture that took me to continuously explore the imprints left by history. This time, we chose the Hongyang Rockefeller Garden Hotel at the foot of Mashan Mountain in Wuxi. Upon arrival, we discovered that it was actually surrounded by the Lingshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area. Along Shili Taihu Road, I naturally turned into a French-style mansion. The hotel is connected to a piece of high-end residences, which belong to the hotel group’s best-selling real estates. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Entering the lobby, the butler Xiaowen welcomed us warmly. As the room was still being cleaned, we first went to the restaurant for lunch. The set meal, the meat and vegetable match, and the taste were excellent. I can see that the hotel chef is very skilled. After eating, the two staff took the initiative to take us to the private soup house with our luggage. There were only four in total. Our group of six ordered three, and the service staff asked what kind of soup package (there were four) Kind of can be selected) and water injection time. After dinner in the evening, everyone can't wait to dip into the soup pond. The peculiar rainy season in the south of the Yangtze River, the rainy season, the wet pebbles, the dim landscape lights, the diffuse water mist, soaking in the constant temperature soup pond, the graceful feeling is beyond words . In the morning of the next day, after eating the buffet breakfast, the service staff enthusiastically helped us with our luggage and came to the executive suite with lake view upgraded by the butler Xiaowen, allowing us to experience different room types. Entering the room, the first impression is that the room is very large, with a ceiling height of at least 4 meters, cloakroom, guest bathroom, dressing room, kitchen room, electric double curtains, balcony depth... No, not so much a balcony, as it is. On the platform, the field of vision is broad, and you can see the vast Taihu Lake from afar, and you can see the boundless view of Tianshu. The two-meter-two super-large bed, the white bedding is soft and dry. The bathtub of the main bathroom is very large and deep, and you can watch TV while lying in it. The toilet shower separates dry and wet. The double basin design and Hermès spare parts reflect the hotel’s dedication to customers in every detail. This stay was only a short three days and two nights. The butler Xiaowen was attentive and considerate, and the service staff were responsive and busy, so that we can make a worthwhile trip. If possible, next time you come to Wuxi, we will still stay in Hongkong. Yang Rockefy, also came to bother them. When the book is used, he hates little, and the words are not expressive, which can not accurately describe the personal feelings of staying at Hongyang Rockefeller this time. Thanks to the steward Xiaowen, a thousand words bowed, this peace of mind is my hometown.

msg:2間房，都非常大，媽爸很滿意，女兒也很開心。是為了去靈山大佛才定這家酒店的，沒想到在無錫的最郊外，下午去市區單程1個半小時。導致了晚上回酒店直接21點半了。游泳池温泉都要關門了，前台服務很好説第二天退房也可以去玩。第二天早餐雖然東西不多，味道都還可以，咖啡比前一天的另家酒店好喝，小餛飩一碗也有好幾個，不像其他酒店就4-5個餵雞呢！服務員主動打招呼還問需要什麼幫忙可以叫他，中午吃飯還來詢問味道怎麼樣，服務意識特別強，這樣才有回頭客嘛。床品睡着舒服，特別是進房間就空調打的很足，真的意外。環境好，飯後花園兜兜很舒服，室外2個游泳池，都挺乾淨的，所以放心遊泳，不像其他酒店都是各種“漂浮物”就是太陽太曬了。室內游泳池暑假沒空調的，待15分鐘大腦缺氧！温泉數了下大概有5個，40度上下。有一點很奇怪，酒店在郊外，但是滴滴很方便，不知道是不是我的運氣好2天裏打了3-4次，基本7分鐘內都可以打到。前台有提供司機的電話，就是要收雙倍的費用！所以大家去盡然開車或者堅持滴滴，當地的滴滴態度比上海的好太多！定位錯了，也沒生氣，還挺熱情的，總之是次愉快的旅行。

温泉不多就四五個池子，但是服務很舒適，有巖板汗蒸，泡池旁邊有休息室和茶水，有安排服務員就近隨時服務。室內泳池温度也可以，恆温28度的，天冷也可以遊。
兩家人帶了小朋友一起去的，前台小余很不錯，介紹了適合小朋友的各種設施在酒店什麼位置，調整了靠温泉和小童樂園的房間，還非要幫忙把行李搬到房間裏，服務非常好。客房添拖鞋、礦泉水等也非常及時。
早餐種類還可以，有現場湯麪餛飩，中西式都有，夠得上高星級酒店標準了。

花園很美，拍照出片，孩子喜歡；泡湯痴很多，水質非常非常乾淨，孩子很開心；有人偶互動和孔雀投喂，孩子完全被吸引住！
最後大讚服務員，任何芝麻綠豆的事，聯繫前台，立馬落實（送小童拖鞋，送水，要小童牙刷…）熱情迅速，非常好！
要説提高，可能就是早餐加個現煮餛飩吧，哈哈！

在酒店孩子游了泳，長者們泡了温泉，全家還在房間玩了好久牌…感覺這酒店老少皆宜，全家連住好多天都沒問題。

 余知会(Turbo)라는 직원분의  배려로 룸 업그레이드가 되어 이틀동안 아주 편안하게 쉬었다 가게되었습니다. 감사했습니다 🙏 
그리고 로비, 수영장, 식당 직원분들 모두 굉장히 친절하셔서 인상깊었어요[Joyful][Joyful]
야외 수영장은 어린아이들을 위한적당히 따뜻한 얕은 풀장과 좀 더 깊은 풀장 그리고 온천탕이 여러곳 있었는데 , 물의 온도가 다양해서  이곳 저곳 왔다갔다하면서 즐겼어요^^
얕은 풀에서 아이들이 물놀이 할때면 아이들에게 신경 쓸 일이 많지 않아 옆에서 쉴수 있어 좋았고. 아이들도 이틀 내내 즐겁게 물놀이를 했어요  . 아이들 풀장 옆에는 미니찜질방도 있는데 저녁쯤됬을땐  아이들이 수영하다 그곳에서 쉬고 그랬어요 [Grin]
어른들을  위한 풀장  주변으로는 호수가 보이는 경치가 너무 좋았어요
이곳은 수영장 물 관리가 잘 되어있어서 아이들이 물놀이 하기에 제격이라 생각해요 .
재방문 의사 100%입니다[ThumbsUp]

酒店還有中西餐廳、健身房、恆温游泳池.spa和温泉~配套很齊全～去附近的靈山景區、拈花灣、黿頭渚
都十分方便～就算不出門，來這裏聽山閲水．與綠丘嘉為伴，日落爾黃昏，泛舟湖上，也是極其愜意！
不光是網紅打卡地，更是劇組拍攝聖地

做為離靈山大佛（開車10分鐘）最近的高檔酒店，性價比可以，比拈花灣那小小的，還價格特高的房間，我覺得這裏更好，尤其帶個小孩，酒店有小孩玩樂的泳池。

一直在**刷到這個酒店，國慶假期前一天去拈花灣玩，順便住了一晚上.抱着試試看的心態，沒想到物超所值.
酒店環境超級好，很幸運升級了。之前備註了嬰兒床，一進房間就是準備好的木質嬰兒床，超級貼心.兩大兩小玩得很開心，一進房間驚呆了！
有書房客廳已經很驚喜了，居然還有獨立的衣帽間和化粧台！
帶小朋友也很適合，小童備品，拖鞋都很完善。因為老二要泡奶，和前台小哥哥説多給兩瓶水，結果給了好多瓶怡寶，真的有點受寵若驚。
有個叫小傑的，看我們帶娃，超級周到，要重點表揚哈哈哈!
早餐也很棒，應有盡有，小籠包好吃，現煮紅湯麪也很不錯呀。煎荷包蛋的小哥哥做了一個蛋餅，味道很好吃😋！
酒店有兩個游泳池，其中有一個無邊泳池！人不多小朋友玩得很開心!

msg:신년을 맞이해서 가족과 온천나들이를 했다 . 호텔은 호수를 바라보는 풍경이었으며, 우리는 방 2개를 선택하였다 . 방은 넓고 웅장했다. 멋있었다 . 호텔주변에는 음식점이없어서 호텔식 디너를 이용하게되었다 . 인당 100위안이며 음식은 100위안보다 못했던것같다. 야외온천을 이용할 수 있어서 좋았다. 그리고 아침식사는 외국인도 먹을 수 있는 음식이있어서 다행이었다 . 결과적으로 음식을 제외하고는 만족한 편이다.
