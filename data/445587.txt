The design concept of respecting nature is in-depth, and architecture, decoration, flower art, and even wooden handle toothbrushes & peripheral products can be seen everywhere, paying tribute to the master.
The butler service is excellent, and the butler Xiao Tu is proactive and meticulous. He gives reasonable suggestions and arrangements for the activities provided by the hotel, and takes care of the 90+ mothers attentively. I sincerely thank you!
The travel photographer Xiaoqian is patient and meets the needs.
The Chinese restaurant has delicious dishes. I ate 4 meals in a row, and each meal was delicious without repeating the order. The ingredients are excellent, the cooking temperature is in place, the seasoning is light, and the original taste of the ingredients is respected. The deep memories are Qiandao Lake fish head soup, Malantou dried tofu, and bamboo shoots and salted trotter soup. The service attitude is excellent. The only suggestion is to launch a half case to give more choices to groups of less than 4 people.
The buffet breakfast has many choices and good quality, and there is a cheese plate.
Overall evaluation: good, very good, will come again.

In spring, children can dig bamboo shoots, and there is also an upcoming tea picking activity. There are also play areas such as a small zoo and a game room specially set up for children. They can also draw facial paintings and so on. It feels very suitable for children. The hotel also has two book shelves.
The restaurants are the Chinese restaurant Dazhi Xiaoguan and the Western restaurant Hupanju. Breakfast is in the Chinese restaurant, with a rich variety, and there are also Fuyang local snacks (changed every day); the beef noodles in the Western restaurant Hupanju are quite delicious; the Chinese restaurant is famous Hangzhou cuisine.

The day before arrival, the hotel housekeeper Xiao Chen called and added WeChat to inform the hotel of the menus of the two restaurants and weekend hotel activities. Some activities require reservation in advance.

Upon arrival, there were staff to valet the car and help with luggage. The Qiuwang suite was upgraded to a lake view suite, and the hotel's own Longjing tea drinks were given as a gift. I had dinner and breakfast at the table facing the lake in the Chinese restaurant, and lunch on the terrace of the western restaurant. I was satisfied with the food and the service was very good, and they would proactively remind me not to order more.

There are many activities in the hotel. We swam with the baby (praising the water temperature of the swimming pool), took a hand-cranked boat, and went to the "Big Crazy Little Pets" cute pet park to feed many animals (surprisingly, there were ostriches and little foxes. The staff was very nice. Patiently introduced and played with them one by one), I went to the sauna, prayed for blessings, copied scriptures, and walked in the forest. My husband went to play billiards, and the children also went to the indoor and outdoor children's playgrounds. If I had stayed one more day, I could have played a round of golf.

I didn’t have high hopes for travel photography, but the result was unexpected and I’m very satisfied👍

msg:I had my eye on this hotel a long time ago and booked the Qiuwang Suite. Because I wanted a terrace, I upgraded to the Chenlan Suite after communication. Thanks to the full support of the housekeeper William Xiaoqin, the feedback was timely and the service was considerate.
The hotel is located in the Fuchunshanju Golf Club in Fuyang District, which is suitable for self-driving and convenient parking. There are not many people on weekdays, which is very suitable for a quiet vacation.

[Room] The hotel has been open for 20 years. Although it is inevitable that the facilities are old, it is well maintained and the texture is online, which is rare. The room is square and well-planned, the bedding is very comfortable, and the bathing supplies are average. Because it is next to the lake, there will be geese visiting downstairs, and the occasional calls are quite touching.

[Public area] The public area walkway is similar to the layout of Sanya Sun Bay Park Hyatt, but it is not that big. Flowers, artworks, and art paintings are interspersed, which is very artistic.
The swimming pool is very good, and the adult swimming pool with a mortise and tenon structure roof is beautiful and easy to swim. There is an additional children's paddling pool, which is great. The disadvantage is that the locker room is relatively small, and it will be crowded if there are many people.

[Food] The Chinese restaurant Dachi Xiaoguan provides buffet breakfast and a la carte for lunch and dinner. The a la carte meals are good and of good quality. To be honest, the breakfast is average, with few varieties, and the bread doesn't look good. But there are two dishes recommended every day, and they will be served to ask if you need them. These two dishes are generally good and are basically freshly made.
Another Western restaurant, Hulangju, has a row of outdoor seats with a good view, but I didn't try it this time.

[Service] From the entrance, you can feel that the hotel training is in place and well implemented, the internal communication is very timely, and the service in all aspects is very good.

There is no perfect hotel, there will be some shortcomings, but the flaws do not cover the merits. The hotel has done a good job in some of the points I pay attention to, and it is great overall, very suitable for a quiet rest.

It had been a long time coming. Character! After the tour, William picked us up and took us back to the hotel (it was time for him to get off work). Afterwards, the hotel manager arranged for us to get familiar with and understand the design, decoration and environment of the hotel. After visiting, I felt that the overall design and decoration were indeed very particular, especially the decorative paintings in the corridors were very beautiful! It’s like entering a poetic mood!

msg:The hotel is in an excellent location, and the Fuchun Villa is worthy of its name. Jaya's original design in China is unreserved. You can't tell that the hotel is already 20 years old. It is well maintained and still shows its original glory. It is beautiful on sunny and rainy days. It happened that the flower arrangement master had just completed several flower arrangements for the hotel, bringing the breath of spring to the hotel corridor. You can take a walk outside the golf course opposite. The gourd exhibition and the painting exhibition have given the already charming Fuchun Villa a lot of appreciation. The photos taken by Xiaoqian during the copying of scriptures and travel photography are all very good! It would be better if the hotel could install an elevator. After all, it is inconvenient to run up and down the stairs with children and the elderly. The service is up to five-star level. JOJO communicated with the service throughout the whole process and answered all questions. Very nice! Very satisfied.

The day before departure, my dedicated butler Xiaotu contacted me and sent me hotel-related event information and location. They paid full attention to our needs during our stay in the hotel, especially when we wanted to visit Fuchun Pavilion early on the second day of our stay. Xiaotu specially arranged a special hotel shuttle bus to take us there earlier than the morning bus. It was really heartwarming. . The hotel has a beautiful environment and some of the activities are very interesting. It is worth coming back next time.

msg:I booked the Qiuwang Suite for two nights. The room faced a pool and had a great view! Although the hotel was built a few years ago, it is well maintained. The only problem is that the sound insulation is not very good. Fortunately, the rooms in the suite are far apart and there are few people, so there is almost no impact.
The hotel's butler, Vincent, is very nice and enthusiastic. He helped us a lot. Thank you very much. Also helped us arrange restaurants and trips to the zoo.
The best view of the hotel is from the tea mountain side to the golf side, and the cruise ship is also very nice! There is a zoo on the mountain that is very suitable for children who like small animals. In addition, the hotel has some other activities but they are not suitable for our age.
The hotel's dining is surprisingly good, the Chinese and Western restaurants are all delicious! I ordered the food carelessly and was in a hurry when I paid the bill and forgot a fruit plate. They even brought it to my room. They were really considerate!
Finally, it is said that the hotel’s mascot is a squirrel because there are so many on the mountain, but we didn’t see any of them except this stuffed toy. What a pity! I was so angry that I bought a few more at the boutique and took them home!
In addition, there is also a travel photoshoot here, which will give you five photos. You can buy others if you like. It is also good for mothers who are embarrassed to take photos with their teammates with their babies. They can take some photos of themselves.

msg:I played golf at Fuchun Mountain Resort before and had a very good impression, so I came back twice more. Accommodation and meals were basically provided in the hotel. The main reason is that the service facilities of this resort can fully cover your needs.
After many years, here it comes again. This time I booked the Qiuwang Suite and was upgraded to the Oupo Suite by the front desk (but I didn’t see the convenient difference between the two?). The room is estimated to be 75 square meters, which is indeed very large. Although the facilities are not the latest, after all, the hotel It's more than 20 years old, but the details are well done, and it feels a bit like old money. Both the shower and the toilet are very comfortable. The water is warm, the toilet seat is warm, and the details show care. Drinks in the mini bar are free.
However, there are two points that I think need to be seriously improved. After all, the facilities in the room are old and need further renovation and improvement: 1. The air-conditioning fan outlet is right on the bedside. The sound of the fan operating in the middle of the night is rumbling, making it impossible to fall asleep at all. , I happened to have a bit of neurasthenia, and it almost cost me half my life. The hotel's service attitude was very good, and they said they would change my room, but the same room also had this shortcoming in hardware facilities. In the end, I could only turn off the air conditioner. , sleeping wrapped in two duvets, tossing around until midnight, this is really sad; 2. Although it is a suite, there is no door between the actual big bed and the living room outside, only half a carved partition. Instead, there are two doors separating the room and the bathroom. I think it's a bit putting the cart before the horse. I hope the living room and the room can have closed doors, because sometimes two people stay and if they encounter someone who snores, one can be on the tatami in the living room and the other in the bedroom without disturbing each other. This is the meaning of a suite. , the so-called suite should be two separate rooms that are isolated. Hope to adopt.
In other aspects, there is really nothing to complain about this resort. The scenery, privacy, and dining facilities are all in place. The price is expensive for a reason. I hope that customers’ well-intentioned suggestions will be taken seriously~~~

msg:Today, similar Chinese-style resorts are indeed blooming everywhere in general terms. But having such boldness, design concepts and construction standards twenty years ago should have been very forward-looking. Because it is forward-looking, it still does not feel outdated, and because it is well maintained. When we stayed here this time, we can only feel the aging of time, but we did not feel any staleness. Whether it is hardware or services, they are still in good condition. The square-shaped swimming pool under the colonnade is a masterpiece that cannot be replicated, and the sauna pool also operates very well (a shortcoming of many hotel facilities). Everything makes the vacation truly relaxing. Every corner of the public area is carefully decorated. It is not easy to keep seasonal flowers fresh all year round. It can be seen that a lot of effort has been spent. The most important thing is that the aesthetic online cannot be completed in a day or two. Although we live in Hangzhou and are not particularly interested in Jiangnan landscapes, we still think that Fuchun Mountain Residence is a hotel worthy of a special stay. For this reason, it is a self-sufficient destination in itself. A little suggestion, the Cute Pet Paradise hopes to have more manpower so that the little animals can get better care (the current staff are very caring, and it can be seen that they have great working ability, but the manpower should not be enough), so Guests big and small who come to see them can gain more physical and mental pleasure and enlightenment. Special thanks to Butler MAX, who added WeChat before our arrival and carefully arranged vehicles and introduced activities for us. He was very professional and kind! I hope to do better and better. I have already recommended it to my relatives and friends.

     The architectural style of the hotel is very unique. Every place comes from the designer's wonderful ideas, telling the cultural heritage of the building. Although the room layout is a bit old, it is well maintained and feels like home.

The hotel is located on Jilong Mountain, and there is a distance from the entrance to the lobby. It is recommended to drive there. There are quite a few charging spots.
Although we checked in at minus 5 degrees Celsius, the entire hotel was very warm inside. Although the room did not have floor heating, the air conditioning was powerful, but it was just a little dry (there was a floor-standing humidifier in the room, but it was loud and did not have a silent mode).

The facilities in the room are OK and the shower water is large. There is a capsule coffee machine and Longjing tea bags (the quality is not very good, the tea bags are sealed but the tea leaves have turned yellow. Longjing is difficult to preserve and needs to be kept in the freezer to keep it fresh. It is recommended that the hotel replace it with other varieties that are less error-prone). Others are welcome Fruit and rice cake sticks, some soft drinks.

The public area is quite large, and you can rest everywhere. The dishes at Da Chi Restaurant are actually average, with few varieties. I think it's okay to eat 1-2 times, but I can't order more. The taste is also good, the prunes and vegetable wheat cakes are very crispy, and there are no other highlights. The price is on the high side.

msg:It used to be one of the best resort hotels around Hangzhou, and it still maintains a high standard.
The hotel opened in 2004. The first owner came from Taiwan. It took seven years to design and construct. The surrounding area is a very traditional Fuyang countryside. Only by driving into the hotel and passing through the long bamboo forest road can you discover a different world.
You don’t need to drive to the hotel. It is very convenient to take a taxi to and from Fuyang High-speed Railway Station. The hotel has two restaurants, Dachi Restaurant and Hulangju, so you don’t have to go out to eat.
There is Fuchun Pavilion on the top of the mountain. You can take a car to the mountain. Jigong is enshrined here. You can also make an appoin**ent to copy scriptures on the top floor. The waiter said that it usually takes more than 1 hour to copy scriptures.
The only drawback is that most of the hotel is a golf course and is not allowed to enter. The golf club is across the lake from the hotel. You need to make an appoin**ent to take a boat, which also costs 98 per person. There is a tea garden nearby, and there is also a small zoo. It takes half a day to walk around the hotel.
The hotel also has a beautiful normal temperature swimming pool, which can be swam in winter, as well as art exhibitions, souvenir shops, billiard rooms, etc. It is easy to spend two days in it.
If it is the guest's birthday, the hotel will send a free cake if you let them know in advance, which is very considerate.

msg:The resort hotel was built 20 years ago with the pursuit of aesthetics. The overall planning JMG and the interior Jaya were originally designed in China without reservation. The lighting team, landscape, and florists are all other design participants of Aman. It can be called the strongest hotel design lineup in history. It may be comparable to JMG and BB’s Capella in Tufu Bay and Ed and Kerry Hill’s Sukhothai in Bangkok. bump. Moving around to change the scene, I even want to take a picture of the toilet.
The rooms are full, the occupancy rate is not high, and the service has not been reduced at all. Based on the package price and content, the boss is very wealthy and has no hope of making money from this. I was directly upgraded to a lake view room, and the sauna provided was very comfortable. I heard that the spa masseurs are all from Bali.
The hotel's Da Chi Bistro can basically be ranked among the top 10 in Hangzhou. The breakfast is rich in variety and really delicious.
Thanks to William, the hotel butler, for his meticulous care. He contacted us one day in advance to make reservations for many activities and helped us receive express delivery.
If you give it 20 years, there won’t be many hotels in Hangzhou that can compare with Fuchun Shanju.

I like my housekeeper Holly, she is very considerate and considerate of every detail. After leaving the hotel, she even sent me a message to ask if my return trip went smoothly. The front desk was very considerate and gave me two bottles of hot tea when I checked out, saying that I would take it with me on the road in the cold weather. The Qiuwang Room where I live opens the window and faces the mountains and rivers. I wake up to the chirping of birds in the morning. After dark, I sit in front of the window to admire the moon and drink tea. Reading scriptures in Fuchun Pavilion makes me feel peaceful. Everything is my favorite way to spend a vacation. I have already recommended it to my family and friends. I hope to come back for a rest when spring comes.

Although there are not many high-tech equipment, I prefer this sense of tranquility and distance. This time I stayed for 2 nights, and I didn't want to go out from the moment I stepped into the hotel. The pastoral scenery of Fuchun Mountain Residence is restored here, paying attention to the privacy of every resident. The hotel has many activities to suit the needs of different people, including scripture copying, boating, and handicrafts. The masseurs from Indonesia at the spa have perfect techniques and completely relax your body and mind. We also made an appoin**ent for a travel shoot. The hotel for such a shoot must be handed over to a professional photographer. The hotel's butler service is just right and responds to your needs in a timely manner. On the way back, Xiao Yang was still concerned about whether we got home safely, but there was a sudden heavy snowfall on the highway. It's a pity that there was no snow at the hotel, it would have been absolutely beautiful. Looking forward to coming again next time.

msg:I finally pulled the grass out of the ceiling of the Hangzhou hotel and concluded that the trip was well worth it!
This is a hotel that has been in operation for 20 years. I have to say that this is really a warm hotel. Some traces of time can be seen in the hardware facilities, but I always feel that the accumulation of history has added an extra layer of thickness to the hotel's culture, such as the CD player in the room. I smiled and said that it showed my age, but I couldn't help but recall the beauty in my memory. fragment.
The occupancy rate on weekdays is generally not high, so the experience is excellent. The hotel will contact you one day in advance to confirm check-in information and needs; then the housekeeper Xiao Yang Benson will come to add WeChat and introduce all the entertainment experiences provided by the hotel before check-in, and also make appoin**ents for subsequent activities. On the day of check-in, the front desk saw me directly stating my last name, and I felt that they were attentive.
The two days and one night in the hotel were very fulfilling, and the hotel’s activities were all interesting and worth experiencing: 1. Practicing scriptures to calm down the noisy mood; 2. Mountain residence trip to experience the hotel’s design and culture; 3. The most beautiful swimming pool + artificial The wave pool + sauna are perfect for relaxation; 4. Take a rowing boat to the Da Chi Petting Zoo opposite the main building. The hotel raises a variety of small animals, which is suitable for parents and children, but older friends are also attracted by the cute little animals; 5. Travel photography, the photographer Xiaoyu is an E person, he is good at event a**osphere and action, and the film is satisfactory; 5. The Chinese and Western restaurants have excellent food, today's special breakfast is not to be missed, and I also had the best Omre special.
The warmth of the hotel is reflected in the service. Many employees have worked for more than ten or even twenty years and have grown up with the hotel. They are also very happy to share the history of the hotel with tourists. Every service staff we met would smile and say hello. The butler Xiao Yang was always on call and remembered our every itinerary.
I hope I can bring my parents back next time~!

msg:This time I stayed in the Lakeview Suite, which is directly facing the lake. It feels very good to the senses. From time to time, a group of ducks will swim on the lake. Watching them swim around makes you feel very comfortable! Although the room is a bit old, it is well maintained and the overall style is simple and elegant. The size of the entire room is also quite good, more than enough for a family of three! The housekeeper Rachel was also very considerate and arranged a preferential SPA package for us. It felt like the young lady was a Thai, as if she had enjoyed a "horse killing chicken" in China. The technique was skillful and the intensity was just right. It was a very good experience. The swimming pool is truly worthy of being made by a master. It is grand and very beautiful. Unfortunately, there are steps all week long. For me, who is not very good at swimming, the 1.5-meter water depth is still a bit daunting. So I switched to the sauna. Since it was the 28th of the year, the passenger flow was not very large. I used the sauna room alone, dry steaming first, and then taking a bath. After soaking enough, I continued dry steaming until I was exhausted... Breakfast the next day Later, in order to eat, the couple took a walk in the woods to Fuchun Pavilion, a large attic with the same setting and style as the resort hotel - it looked quiet and cultivated. So I went to the third floor, let my mind calm down, and copied a Heart Sutra: Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, walking deeply...
    Another thing worth mentioning is the Chinese restaurant - Da Chi Bistro, which tastes really good. My husband ate the pepper and sesame white *****s twice in a row, and even said that if he comes back next time, he will order more... The Western restaurant I ordered a ball of ice cream, which was 38 per ball, plus a 10% service fee, which felt a bit expensive.

The decorative paintings and flower arrangements also have the same antique temperament. Stayed in the Linyin double room. The room was a bit small, but the bed was still very comfortable. It was quiet and easy to sleep. It coincided with New Year's Day, and there were many New Year's Eve activities and fireworks and bonfires at night. It was really worth it!

msg:After visiting Fuyang several times, I have stayed in most of the room types in the main guest room area of ​​Fuchun Shanju.
Let me talk about the conclusion first: overall praise, comfort and service are very good, and the scenery is an absolute plus.
💫Lin Ying and Guizhou are basic rooms, Lin Ying has a garden view, and Guizhou has a lake view. Qiuwang and Oubo are relatively common open-plan suites, and one has a garden view and the other a lake view. Other one-bedroom villas or two-bedroom and three-bedroom villas are located in the north or south district. They are all rooms facing the lake and have independent courtyards.
💫The basic room is really small. You will feel cramped when you enter the room. The bedroom is always bumpy when walking around. Basic rooms do not have bathtubs. It is more suitable for a person to go out and relax. If two people live there, the room will feel crowded.
💫The overall feeling of the suite is much better. There is a screen to separate the bed and couch, and the bathroom is relatively spacious. Next time I come back, I plan to stay in a suite.
💫The service has always been very good, and the employees in all depar**ents are polite and not overly enthusiastic. Thanks again to the housekeeper Xiaotu for the proper arrangement. I also recommend Fuchun SPA. This time I had a comprehensive experience and a perfect score.

Thank you very much for the pleasant stay experience this time. We look forward to seeing you again next time.

Ctrip’s room vouchers are great value for money, and the free benefits and arts and cultural activities can’t be used up in one night. The complimentary travel photos were taken by Xiaoqian. The aesthetics and technology are very online. The unit price is also very cheap beyond the standard. My husband said it is worth a thousand dollars. The butler Xiao Yang who contacted me was also very considerate and responsive to all requests. The staff I met were all very nice, and I had a bunch of food and drinks when I checked out. It would be perfect if there were more breakfast choices. When Ctrip releases room coupons again, I will definitely buy a few more. It’s really worth it that I went on a business trip to Hangzhou to verify them.

msg:The hotel is really great! I chose this resort hotel for the weekend. It is said to be super five-star. Before checking in, the butler Holly added a WeChat message to inform the optional activities in the hotel. Holly was very considerate throughout the whole process. If you have any questions, you can contact the butler for help. Every employee in the hotel is also friendly and enthusiastic.
Although it is a hotel that has been open for 20 years, the facilities are extremely well maintained and the rooms are so comfortable that you don’t want to move once you stay there. The hotel has a swimming pool, sauna and spa. I really like the design of the swimming pool. You can also go to Fuchunju on the mountain to copy scriptures and pray for blessings. The environment is great for strolling around in the hotel during the day, and there is a golf course next to it. There are also travel photography and small zoos to choose from. In short, it is a good place for vacation. I feel like it’s really amazing to care for the elderly in this environment!

Environment: The hotel's environment is superb. I finally found the reason why it is still so popular after many years of operation. The aesthetics of Chinese symmetry complement the scenery outside the window.
Activities: The hotel has various activities. When checking in, the service staff will explain them in detail and help make reservations. The scenery on the mountain is very good. If you have time, you can go shopping on the mountain, which is also in the hotel.
Food: Due to our schedule, we were not able to eat at the hotel's "Da Chi Bistro". Breakfast has specialties every day, so you can try it. The "Fuyang Wo Tofu" we had that day was very good.
Surroundings: We went to the former residence of Huang Gongwang and visited the place where "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" was created.

The quiet and comfortable 2-day vacation is over, and I look forward to having another chance to come again.

msg:Visited Fuchun Shanju again, everything is still perfect~

Dining experience:
The resort's Chinese and Western restaurants present a rich variety of food choices, allowing three generations of us to find our favorite tastes. The traditional Chinese cooking techniques and the creative use of fresh ingredients in Western food made the whole family full of praise. Although there is a 16% service fee, I believe that the cost is directly proportional to the service attitude of the staff at Shanju.

Service attentiveness:
Butler Xiaoyang's consistent service attitude is unforgettable. He not only responds to every request, but also provides considerate suggestions. His professionalism and attentive service made our family feel welcome and added a warm family a**osphere to our vacation.

Hotel design and facilities:
Although the large swimming pool was closed this weekend due to hotel activities, the hotel arranged the villa swimming pool in time to ensure our needs for water activities. The design of the hotel fully takes into account the needs of family travel and provides a comfortable and spacious accommodation environment, making us feel the comfort of vacation.

Things to do:
In addition to water sports, the resort also provides a variety of entertainment activities. We experienced boat cruises, boutique paper-cutting, sauna, billiards, chess and scripture copying. Whether it is a relaxing SPA or a rich cultural experience, the resort's activity arrangements make We had a fulfilling and enjoyable holiday that catered to the different interests of three generations.

Overall, the resort performed well in terms of catering, service, hotel design and entertainment options, giving us an unforgettable family vacation experience. The attentive service of the butler Xiaoyang added a touch of warmth to the entire vacation experience.

The hotel is very beautiful, with a strong sense of design and a complicated interior, but there will be a butler to receive and help tourists. Our housekeeper Xiao Qin, William, was super nice, very patient, and helped us solve a lot of problems. When we left, the children in the family couldn't bear to part with this uncle!
The main things to do were: praying for blessings by burning incense, the cruise was very comfortable, the 30 degrees in the swimming pool was very comfortable for children, the sauna was surprisingly great, there was a massage pool, one dry steam, one wet steam, and the bathroom was also very big! All service staff are very nice! The indoor and outdoor children's playground is a little less interesting, but considering that the hotel itself is not a family hotel, it is understandable.
The travel photography was also very good. It took half an hour and I took a lot of photos. The photographer Xiaoqian was very good at coaxing the children and took very good photos. He didn’t forcefully promote this kind of routine. It was very practical!

The prices are not cheap, but the quality is first-class. Considering the environment and service, it is completely worthy of the price. This is a family trip with the elderly. In fact, there is not much area to visit in the hotel, because the large area is the stadium and cannot be entered. There are too many steps in the hotel, which is not friendly to the elderly with weak legs and strollers. The hotel also arranges some activities for family travel, which are quite rich. If you are here to play golf, it will be a blast. The stadium is really big! !

The butler William (Xiao Qin) was attentive and considerate. I felt a little cold at night, so he immediately arranged room service to bring me oil tin. We ate at Da Chi Bistro on the night we checked in, and it tasted delicious. At noon the next day, I tasted the signature beef noodles from the Western Restaurant Hulangju. It was such a big portion! There are not many breakfast varieties, but they are rich enough. The hotel provides travel photos, which is especially friendly for people traveling alone and can leave a souvenir. The hotel has beautiful scenery, a lot of activities, and boutiques to visit. One night's stay was a bit rushed, but two nights was just right. I will come again next spring! !
Cleanliness: The room is very clean and the floor is shiny! ! It has been in business for 19 years. How do you do it? It’s amazing.

The aunt who brought you Ting to my room at night was also very nice. When she came, she was wearing single clothes and I said, "Aren't you cold?" She said it wasn't cold because she had to run around serving customers and delivering things. She would get hot if she ran too much. There were thick work clothes, but she didn't need to wear them. It wasn't cold at all. When she spoke, her tone was so sincere, as if it was her mission to strive to meet the needs of her guests. She had a particularly positive attitude.

Lin Ying's room was slightly smaller, but the bedding was very comfortable. I regretted not upgrading to a suite or having a lake view, but I kept spending time outside anyway. People who don’t play golf will not feel bored at all after staying for three days and two nights without ever leaving the hotel. You can take a ferry to the hill opposite to see small animals, and swim in what is considered to be the most beautiful swimming pool in Hangzhou. The massage technician at the spa is an Indonesian girl with very good skills. Comfortable, the Chinese restaurant is of the highest standard. You can take the shuttle bus to Fuchun Pavilion on the mountain to enjoy the scenery. There will also be fireworks at night. It is super suitable for the ending of 2023.
Almost all the service staff are professional and enthusiastic, and the butler Xiao Song can be said to be a little sweetheart. Worth coming again

The housekeeper Xiao Yang received the whole process, and communicated directly on WeChat if we had any basic needs. He would send a message in the morning to remind us to have breakfast, and he also helped us get an hour delay for check-out. We also participated in scripture readings, SPA appoin**ents, etc. They arranged it for us and it was very worry-free. I am afraid that some people will give it a thumbs up.

After checking in, I temporarily decided to upgrade to a garden view suite. After breakfast the next day, I returned to the room and saw a large water wave rippling on the ceiling. It was so beautiful. I always thought the lake view was better.

I usually check out the Chinese restaurant in the hotel, and this little restaurant is also part of my plan. My best friend who has eaten fried shrimps in various restaurants feels that this fried shrimps is slightly inferior. The crispy beef cubes are really delicious. It is a recommendation. The two of us ate six dishes. The overall evaluation is not bad👍

The ingredients for breakfast in the Chinese restaurant are quite fresh. For lunch, we also ordered a few special dishes from the Chinese restaurant. The mixed fish is cooked to order, which is a bit time-consuming, but the best is the fresh taste.
All the service staff in the hotel are very kind. The butler William was very enthusiastic throughout the whole process and even prepared children's toiletries and small gifts for the children.

Not to mention the natural landscape, everything is carefully taken care of and harmoniously integrated with nature. It is quite Chinese classical. The essence of gardening.

The furnishings still show low-key luxury with connotation in every detail. It can be seen from the regularly held art exhibitions that the main focus is on a culture and warmth.

Although the facilities are no longer as good as many newly opened hotels, furniture made of pure wood is not something newly opened hotels can have now.

The food still tastes the same as before, the authentic Jiangnan taste. It is said that the chef has worked here for 20 years, and the food is fresh and has the good taste of time.

The hotel service is still very considerate. Special thanks to the housekeeper Rachel, who was enthusiastic and responsive throughout the entire process. I hope I will have the opportunity to vacation here again next time.

We not only swam in the lake and drank tea, but also went to the city to pay homage to our former residence and take a walk. Binjiang, friends traveling together are very happy.

I particularly like the service at the resort. A group of young people are responsible for the front desk. They are attentive and responsive. Especially the manager Shawn who is responsible for connecting with us. He is handsome and graceful. He learned that we have two ancient sisters who happened to be passing by. On birthdays, red wine and longevity noodles were immediately arranged, which made the elderly particularly happy; when the elderly did not know how to turn on the TV, they turned on the TV in advance and put the remote control on the bedside; when we walked outside in the cold wind When we returned to the lobby, we were immediately served special Longjing tea and told us to keep it warm enough to cover our hands...
All the details allow us to see the future of a company. The advantages of soft power will enable them to win more praise and repeat customers.

He very thoughtfully gave some tips and help during my stay, and also gave me a very cute souvenir from the hotel. It was very considerate, thank you very much!

🍽️Dining: There is a Chinese restaurant in the hotel, Dachi Xiaochu, and a Western restaurant, Hulangju. Personally, I feel that the quality of Chinese food is better. I went to Hulangju for tea and ordered a tiramisu that was said to be pretty good. How should I put it? I think the tiramisu I made myself would be much better than the one they sell. I don’t recommend it.
The variety of dishes ordered at Da Chi Restaurant is pretty good, and the vegetarian dishes may be better than the meat dishes. My personal favorite among the dishes I ordered is the vinegared eggplant. In addition, this breakfast was also at Da Chi Bistro. I think the experience was better than what others said online. The variety is not much, but the quality is okay, especially the dishes that are written as today's specials on the table sign are all okay and worth it. give it a try;
🍎Others: I chose the experience project of praying for blessings and copying scriptures. I quite liked it, but the room was a bit cold when I was copying scriptures on the mountain. I also tried the sauna, which was as expected. I forgot to bring my swimsuit, so I just went to the swimming pool to have a look. It was indeed quite special.

The service is also very attentive, especially Butler Tu, who is really considerate and has a little surprise. I heard that he also designed the delicious little pot of tea. It’s awesome 👍 I’m really satisfied with the overall experience
I participated in the cruise and the zoo. It was very comfortable. The zoo is very interesting. There are also puppies who come down to pick you up. There are many cute animals on the mountain. It is a very interesting experience. I will definitely go there next time.

The service is enthusiastic and very proactive. We went early and the room hadn't been cleaned yet, so they sent us on a lake cruise. If you buy this by yourself, it costs 98 yuan per person, so you save 200 yuan at once. Because I was playing with my old mother, who is nearly 90 years old, the front desk took the initiative to arrange for us to go to the third floor where we didn't need to go up or down the stairs. There were no steps, which was so considerate. After walking outside by the lake, the old man got tired and immediately sent a car to take him back to the hotel. The hotel is truly luxurious, quiet and peaceful.

msg:As a long-established luxury hotel that has been in business for nearly 20 years, Fuchun Shanju has not compromised at all on room maintenance and customer service. Before check-in, the housekeeper Xiaotu added our WeChat account to coordinate the check-in matters. On the day of check-in, he was not available, but he was still able to arrange the reservation of the Dachi Bistro and the matching of travel photos. The next day, he could recognize the guests from a distance. Being able to call out names accurately when you come out reflects the professionalism of a professional service staff of a luxury brand hotel. The hotel has a full resort feel, whether it is the interior designed by master Jaya or the beautiful pastoral exterior, it makes people feel relaxed and happy. The only drawback is that the hotel swimming pool is not open due to events, and the quality of travel photography needs to be improved. Overall, Fuchun is worth a visit. Next time I stay in Fuchun, I will ask Xiaotu for continued service~

There is also a sofa bed in the Lin Studio. Although the room is not very big, it has everything you need. We feel that the biggest feature is the flower arrangement. All the flower arrangements are freshly picked and inserted. They are all real. The persimmons hanging and the pumpkins placed in the current season are really unexpected. There are beautiful scenes everywhere. The Chinese restaurant is expensive and tastes good, but there is a 16% service charge. The breakfast is less than the five-star restaurants we went to before, but the service is good.

After staying there, I discovered that this hotel has great charm, great stamina, and a strong magnetic field! The entire hotel has three floors, but even the staff can get lost; each room has a scene at every step and a professional photographer is equipped to take photos for free📷. It would be impossible to visit the entire hotel even if you walk with your baby for three days...
Without further ado, let’s take a look at what this “top luxury” hotel, which is modestly called “high luxury”, has to offer🈶️
[Keywords]: The service is excellent｜The scenery is beautiful｜High-end brand concept｜Suitable for all types of people

[Hotel Address]: On the mountainside next to the Fuchun River, Fuyang District, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, adjacent to Fuyang River Bindong Avenue in the south, Huanggongwang National Forest Park in the north, with the mountain behind and the river behind.

[Travel method]: Self-driving in Shanghai city ➡️2 hours and 30 minutes, parking is free. ❌It is not recommended to take public transportation!

The public area is well maintained, but the rooms still have some wear and tear when you look closely. There were a lot of people at breakfast on Saturday, and the meal supplements were quite timely. The food served at Da Chi Bistro for lunch was quite fast, and the taste was a bit sweet, but it was acceptable. The view from the terrace of Huyuju was very good. The travel photography service is good, and you can take some photos of family members traveling together. Special praise should be given to the hotel’s butler service. Max, the butler, added WeChat the day before the trip, provided detailed hotel information, helped arrange birthday cakes, made reservations for various free and paid activities, and issued invoices... He responded to all requests and showed his WeChat avatar after check-in. He recognized me and felt that I was a kid who was very attentive to his work.

In the evening, it is the elegance and weight of Chinese style. In the morning, it is the symmetry and peace of the space. Relying on the artistic conception of landscape, mortise and tenon structure and ink elements of blue bricks, white walls and gray tiles, floral arrangements can be seen everywhere and Jaya's iconic light and shadow design. It’s a great place to avoid the crowds of people on holidays and just focus on the mountains and rivers (well, I can’t write poems and my handwriting is not good, I can only play chess and laugh at each other). Thanks to the photographer for taking the photos and the staff who are always on call.

Both the hotel's architecture and interior design pay great attention to the symmetry of the traditional Chinese central axis, including the long and thin doors and windows, lamps, bamboo shutters, room furnishings, tea seats, old cabinets, and old objects arranged inside the hotel.

The hotel design fully embodies the concepts of Chinese aesthetics and environmental protection. All green plants are real flowers, designed by floral masters, and they look great when taking photos.
There are a lot of activities in the hotel, including visiting, sauna, hiking, scripture copying, travel photography, plus where to take photos, a day and a night is simply not enough fun.
The service is very good and the butler is very considerate. If you need anything, please contact the butler directly and arrange activities and restaurant reservations.
The restaurant Da Chi Bistro is very good, with fresh ingredients, exquisite cooking, and elegant environment. The hotel has been open for 19 years, and the chef has been here for 19 years. Generally I don't like eating in hotel restaurants, but this one is definitely worth recommending.

Environment: The environment is very good, very quiet, with beautiful water and mountains, suitable for vacation
Facilities: The hotel has been open for a long time, and the overall facilities are relatively old. A few points: 1) There is no main control switch in the room; 2) There are no sockets around the soft couch; 3) There is a CD player on the table decoration; 4 ) There are large cracks on the wall of the room. It is recommended that the hotel be gradually renovated so that its facilities can keep up with current guest needs.
Hygiene: Generally speaking, it was OK, but there was a small incident. The coffee saucer was not cleaned and there was obvious peel on the back. After feedback to the housekeeper, it was quickly replaced and a plate of freshly cut fruits was given as a gift. The attitude was very good. In addition, the tea sets on the tea bar have yellow stains on the inside, and it feels like no one uses them, so let's forget about it.
Summary: The service and environment are great, but if the facilities are still in an old state, based on the price of 2000-3000, it is not recommended.

Jean-Michel Gathy is responsible for the architecture and overall design, and Jaya Ibrahim is responsible for the interior design. Recently, I have become more and more impressed by staying in old hotels. hskp made If it’s good, you can feel everyone’s intentions
🌳Qingshan Yuandai restores the "Fuchun Mountain Residence Picture". The hotel is full of scenery, with many green plants but few flowers. Most of them are found in the mountains and forests. It aims to pursue the natural taste of the four seasons and is in line with the overall tone of the hotel. Florist Ling Zongyong Indispensable contribution
Sometimes you can hear the call of the big white geese. There are currently 5 of them, which are the mascots of the hotel. There is also 1 wild goose. It is said that the wild goose has been flying here for several years and has not flown away.
🏃🏻♂️ Turn right after exiting the gate to go to the promenade. On the other side of the artificial lake is the Longjing Tea Garden and golf course. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers and is full of green. You can get a moment of peace while wandering there. I heard that there are tea picking activities in spring.
The boutique is not just a decoration like other hotels, so it is easy to browse. Surprisingly, it also sells LYDEEN, a niche perfume from Stockholm.
🏕There are popular camping tents in the outside garden, as well as children's trampoline, and outdoor movies in the evening. There are many activities, and some room types can book a snowpeak camping experience.
.
🛎The doorman will only let the guest in after confirming the identity of the guest, ensuring the privacy of the guest (I don’t know what the rules are for eating)
The hotel has a hotel tour in the afternoon, remember to participate. I couldn’t find the imitation picture of Fuchun Mountain Residence.
A steam eye mask and the hotel's own cotton pajamas are provided when you turn down the bed.
 
🛏86 guest rooms are distributed on both sides. If you want to stay, it is recommended to choose a suite. The room size is a bit small. This time I upgraded to a lake view suite and arranged a cake. I want to thank the butler Benson.
The seats on both sides of the suite are more than enough to lie down on and are very spacious.
Coffee machine sterilizer, minibar (including snacks and beer) on the first night, Fuchun Longjing tea, and plenty of bottled water~
🍇The welcome fruit I chose is Qingwang grape, which is super sweet, and the rice cake bars are also delicious.

🛁The toilet room is separate, and the bathroom is HANSGROHE, with plenty of water, but no shower head
The spare parts are from RE Fragrance Room. It seems to be the first time I have used this. It smells quite good.
The slippers and pajamas are very comfortable, great review!
🏊🏻♀️The indoor swimming pool is very square and spacious, 1.5m deep, so you need to pay attention if you are bringing children.
.
🍽The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is the Da Chi Bistro. The taste is okay and the beef is delicious. If you sit close to the side, the floor is low and it is quite noisy. There is an additional 16% service fee.
🥢Breakfast is from 7:00 to 10:00 in the Da Chi Bistro. As a resort hotel, the breakfast ends a bit early. Most hotels will adjust it to 10:30 or even 11 o'clock on weekends.
The roasted chicken with chestnuts is delicious. The wontons are delicious. I recommend a bowl. The Western food is weak. The bread looks like it was picked from outside. The quality is average.
🧃There are 3 types of freshly squeezed juices with clean taste
.
Whether it's a vacation or a family trip, we can basically take care of it. It can be regarded as a good resort hotel.

You can be comfortable, self-cultivation and quiet. Although the hotel has been in the hotel for more than ten years, there is no peculiar smell and a light floral fragrance. The suites are bright, clean and deep after settling. The wood-colored furniture has a retro feel and I really like the smell.
After breakfast, take a minibus up the mountain to meditate, pray and copy the Heart Sutra in Fuchun Pavilion. When you are tired, you can walk on the outdoor terrace to relieve eye fatigue and take in the beautiful scenery of the mountain. In the afternoon, sit in the Lake Gallery Pavilion, sip Longjing tea and look at the golf course in the distance. After dinner, you must take a swim in the most beautiful indoor swimming pool in China.
During this two-day trip, I saw that the entire Fuchun Shanju Hotel perfectly interpreted the structural shape and detailed expression of oriental aesthetics. People were immersed in it and enjoyed it.
The hotel will also thoughtfully arrange a one-on-one butler before check-in. This time, Max will be the guide. He will arrange reservations in advance for where he wants to go and make some inquiries. His attitude is very good.
It’s a pity that I haven’t taken the route around the lake yet. It’s still very hot in autumn in mid-September. I’ll save it for next time!

The Fuchun Shanju Resort campus is really big. It takes a short drive from the resort's outer gate to the hotel lobby, so the hotel is really secluded and quiet.
Outside the hotel are tea mountains, bamboo gardens, golf courses, and lakes. The eyes are full of green and it is very joyful~
The hotel designed by Amman’s royal designer is naturally very tasteful~
All the decorations in the hotel are carefully considered, and all the decorations are real, with no fake plastic products. In autumn, real persimmon trees full of persimmons are used, as well as pine branches that exude a refreshing fragrance! Full marks 💯
Speaking of service, Ctrip’s customer service staff is very responsive and responsive~
The hotel housekeeper Holly arranged the whole process very reasonably, and the service was very considerate and responsive. I was super satisfied~
There is no inconvenience at all when taking care of children. Love it~

Although the hotel has been in existence for nearly twenty years, it still retains its charm in every aspect. The public areas and rooms are very well maintained. What satisfied me most this time was the hotel’s customer service. All staff members are smiling and patient. Special thanks to the butler Max, who really allowed us to experience butler-style service. If we have any questions anytime, anywhere, he can help us communicate in a timely manner. If we have any questions, he is patient, careful, enthusiastic and thoughtful. During my stay, it happened to be the Double Ninth Festival and I prepared a gift for the elderly in my family. It was such a surprise and it really touched me. I have to give a special thanks to Max! Looking forward to staying again next time!

He will prepare everything in advance according to your needs before check-in.

I remembered the wrong time for breakfast the next day and thought I had nothing to eat. After contacting the housekeeper, I asked the chef to order two bowls of noodles and get milk in advance. Give us. It was a very good experience. I hope to have time to come here for vacation every year in the future.

The experience of staying in the hotel makes me feel the need to recommend it as I don't easily comment. Because the hotel has its own golf course, the environment is quiet and feels like a paradise. The hotel's services are also butler-style, so that you can feel meticulous care everywhere. The butler who received me this time, jojo, provided meticulous and all-round services. The elderly at home felt particularly comfortable and happy, which is what made me most satisfied with this trip.

I really like the privacy of this leisure vacation. Secondly, thanks to the beautiful housekeeper Xiao Qiao, who helped arrange the activities during the entire stay in the hotel, made reservations for restaurants, and even picked them up to the event location in person, the service is 100 points like it The hardworking girl, patient and careful, helped us take a lot of beautiful parent-child photos, thank you! Finally, the waiters in both western restaurants and Chinese restaurants are very service-minded, and manually like 👍, especially in Chinese restaurants. I ordered a dish that might not be suitable for this method, resulting in a bad taste, and I didn’t eat a few bites. When I signed the bill and left, the waiter asked me how it tasted? I told the truth, when I got back to the room, I called and said that this dish was free for me. Full marks for service awareness! After talking about the advantages, I would also like to talk about the disadvantages. After all, the decoration is old, the switches feel old, and the toto toilet seat is not that new, but the room service is still very clean. Therefore, in summary, Fuchun Shanju Resort is worth a second or third brush!

The outdoor views from the hotel's Western restaurant Hulangju and Chinese restaurant Dachi Xiaochu are particularly beautiful.
Software-wise, all the staff I encountered were warm and friendly. In particular, the housekeeper Jojo was very attentive and considerate. He took the initiative to contact us from the night before check-in, responded to all requests, and was considerate throughout the entire process.

This year I seized the opportunity and took my son with me to experience the mountain residence in late summer and early autumn.
The housekeeper Jojo added WeChat the night before check-in, and made everything from arranging hotel activities and dining recommendations to adding baby bed bumpers, arranging for elders to rest, and making weather forecasts in a meticulous and comfortable way.
This is a hotel that is almost 20 years old, so you cannot check in as "new", but it has its own unique beauty accumulated over the past 20 years. The hotel is strategically located, like a large park, with every step of the way. Even in the lobby, the gardening shapes are carefully designed and pleasing to the eye.
There are Western restaurants and Chinese restaurants in the hotel, all of which taste very good. Even the breakfast buffet is outstanding, which adds a lot to the hotel.
The only thing I want to point out is that the hotel seems to have a lot of business meetings and activities, which have somewhat broken the Zen a**osphere it created. I hope that in a different season, I can have the opportunity to experience it again.

The hotel is located in a mountain, a true mountain residence, with a unique new Chinese style, coupled with the surrounding mountains and water, and the blue sky and white clouds, it is really beautiful and comfortable.
I took my mother to enjoy an essential oil spa. The Indonesian ladies Merry and Murni brought us physical and mental relaxation and joy: the massage was of appropriate strength, professional techniques, gentle greetings, and the scent of essential oils was soothing. The hotel sauna also has a small hot spring pool, one with wet steam and one with dry steam. It is a good choice for city workers to relax.
The hotel voucher also comes with a travel photography reservation, and you can enjoy 5 free photos per room. Make an appoin**ent with Miss Xiaoqian one day in advance. A very professional photographer, with excellent scene selection, comfortable composition, and accurate captures. The guidance on shooting postures and manners is also very professional. Good review.
The hotel's swimming pool, Chinese and Western restaurants, the ability to make reservations in the morning to participate in prayer and scripture reading, and various window views are really wonderful. In the future, may I also consider learning to play golf? I feel that the crisp autumn weather will be very beautiful~

I recommend Ctrip to pick up and drop off the car, which is convenient and cost-effective, and is better than taking a taxi. The end point is set at the northwest gate of the hotel for easy navigation. Our taxi drove to the south gate and then transferred, so it was better to book a pick-up with Ctrip directly.
The hotel contacted me by phone the night before check-in, and then the housekeeper Mr. Tu contacted me to confirm the arrival time of the trip, and also gave a lot of hotel activity information. On the day of check-in, the housekeeper arranged the room in advance and introduced the room facilities when checking in (the welcome snacks were already placed).
The room was surprisingly good, there was no musty smell, the facilities and furniture were well maintained, and the toilet kept up with the trends. There are tents and a swimming pool in the yard. The scenery is also very positive.
The hotel has a lot of activities. You can make reservations at the boutique or directly through the butler.
It feels very comfortable to walk along the waterside in the early morning, especially suitable for me as an elderly person.
A hotel where we had both dinners, delicious and very cost-effective.
Although breakfast is relatively simple, it has everything you need.
In short, staying at Ctrip Tun Voucher is very cost-effective. If circumstances permit, you can choose a villa or a villa.
My old man said he would continue to stay here (hehe, I look forward to seeing the little squirrel next time)

msg:It is a design jointly created by Aman's royal designers Jean Michel (overall planning) and Jaya (interior design). It has a mortise-and-tenon style. Although it was built in 2004, it is very well preserved and I particularly like it.
The service is very good. A waiter will contact you one day in advance and contact you directly online. If you have any questions, you can communicate online. It is very efficient.
There are a lot of activities. I strongly recommend praying and copying scriptures, which is very purifying for the soul, hahaha.
Food and breakfast are very rich, with many specialties, such as bar cakes made from Longjing tea, which taste pink and glutinous.
Da Chi Bistro is the highlight, not only is it the meticulous work of the chef with 19 years of experience, it is worth it.
Recommended to friends who like hotels with historical characteristics, it is well worth the experience.

The environment in the hotel is relatively beautiful, the suite accommodation is more comfortable, and the staff are enthusiastic. The buffet breakfast is not cost-effective, and the variety is relatively simple; the dishes in the Chinese restaurant taste good, but the 16% service fee is a bit excessive!

Treasure Lawn~Traveling on the lake by boat is also very fun. The children feed the fish and watch the geese. The whole is very relaxing and leisure.

Ms. Rachel at the front desk carefully helped our family arrange all the itinerary reservations since I first booked the hotel, and also helped the children arrange small beds and little squirrels. The children liked it very much. Little brother jojo from the housekeeping depar**ent helped us repair the coffee machine, adjusted the TV, and gave the kid a squirrel 🐿️, hehehe, thank you very much. There is also the little sister Xiaoqian from the travel photography, who patiently helped our family take photos and pick photos under the high temperature of 37. I am really embarrassed and sincerely thank you. During the 3 days in this hotel, the staff of the hotel were very amiable and the a**osphere was harmonious. I have been here once in 19 years and again in 23 years. I will want to come to your hotel for vacation next time. Hope to see you next time. ^_^

The hotel has white walls, black tiles, and flying eaves as the main theme, giving it a Jiangnan water town style. The tranquil and clear Zen-like decoration in the hotel gives people a sense of fusion of ancient charm and elegance.
Quiet and comfortable rooms, restaurants surrounded by lakes on three sides, the hotel is a beautiful picture everywhere you look.
Special thanks to customer service manager Xiao Qiao for her warm hospitality🌹🌹🌹! The service is thoughtful and meticulous.
Special thanks to the lobby manager Xiaotu for the surprise when we checked out! ❤️❤️❤️ We specially took photos and printed them as souvenirs for the three of us, mother and daughter.

Thanks to the help of housekeeper Xiao Qiao, he provided ginger soup and a thermometer, which was a heart-warming service. Walking to Fuchun Pavilion, it started to rain halfway. I was thinking about how to get out of the rain, and the driver of the electric car came to deliver an umbrella. Travel photographer Xiaoqian took photos of the elderly, mobilized their emotions and recorded their beautiful moments. The scenery of Fuchunshan Residence is beautiful, and the service makes it even better. Looking forward to our next trip to Shanju.

msg:The first time I came to Fuchun Mountain Residence as a guest, it reminded me of the Korean drama #情定大酒店#, because the service staff here gave me the feeling that they are not for work, but really love this hotel and regard it as home.
What impresses me the most is because of "Little Tu". Manager Tu is already here before the hotel opened. He took us on a hotel tour at 5 o'clock, and introduced in detail the historical changes of the hotel in the past 20 years, the architectural interior and even the lighting design, and the humanistic and artistic stories of Fuchun Mountain Residence. , eloquently. Every time I met him in the hotel, he always greeted him warmly, and gave the baby a little squirrel before leaving. Thank you very much.
Secondly, the reception of each service staff to the guests makes me feel that they are loving and kind from the heart, such as Xiao Qiao at the front desk, the little brother who greets the guests at the door (the interaction with our buns is super good), and the store is decorating the Dragon Boat Festival The lady in the interactive activity (so that the buns can play in circles), and a male staff member in the spa room (knowing that I want to take another look at the picture of Fuchun Mountain Residence, he opened the door for me earlier). It is precisely because of these people that this hotel is extraordinarily warm and humane.
Well, let’s objectively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the hotel:
Advantages: rich natural scenery + very rich and appropriate experience activities (really suitable for parent-child families to travel) + first-class service (after all, it was only for high-end VIPs before) such as baby cots (greatly exceeded my expectations), before The mentioned service staff warmly welcome the guests from the heart
Disadvantages: As a 20-year-old hotel, the facilities are indeed a bit old vs. other new hotels at the same price. Fortunately, the quality of the guests may be relatively high and the maintenance is very good. ,Ha ha)
All in all, I would like to recommend family trips, and I suggest that you can spend a day visiting the hotel to experience various activities!

The catering is excellent. The resort hotel just doesn’t want to go out, so good catering is a plus. I was impressed by the tea and fried eggs for breakfast. I can feel the seriousness of the simple ingredients.

msg:The hotel was built in the original site of Fuchun Mountain Residence, and it was designed by the royal designer of Aman. Needless to say, the design and environment, it is rare that it has been in business for 19 years, and the interior is still very neat and clean, and the design style is still charming. The flower arrangements in the corner are very beautiful, and the waiters are very enthusiastic, especially Jojo who gave us a lot of help throughout the whole process. The introduction of the mountain tour let us know a lot about Fuchun Mountain and the history of the hotel. It is highly recommended. The activity of copying scriptures is also very good. Fuchun Pavilion is very comfortable , I wrote quietly in the rain for two hours, a rare peace of mind, I hope the hotel can always maintain this kind of hardware and software strength, and I will definitely go again when I find a chance in the future

It is a rare hotel with a perfect combination of high-end decoration and friendly service. The style of the hotel is very Chinese, combined with the artistic conception of "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains", it makes people linger and forget to return. Various activities arranged by the hotel are also rich and colorful. Just in the hotel, life for three days and two nights is quite fulfilling. What is particularly memorable is the friend-like hospitality. The lady at the front desk, Xiao Qiao, the manager of the lobby, Manager Tu, and the manager of the lobby depar**ent, Manager Tang, all left a deep impression on me. It is really difficult to have a hotel that allows me to remember so many staff members at one time, and I can still vividly remember their faces. I will definitely go again, not only to enjoy the hotel again, but also to see my old friends.

Before the trip, the front desk of the hotel called to greet and inform some precautions. It was very considerate, so I got to know the front desk manager Jojo, and consulted her on WeChat throughout the whole process, always answering all questions. The hotel staff has a strong sense of face-to-face and service. When they arrive at the store, the concierge staff will come up to help carry the luggage and send it to the guest room. Even the intern staff at the front desk are very professional. On the way to lead us into the guest room, they kept introducing the various facilities and business points of the hotel. Hulangju is a western restaurant with a very good location, facing the lake, sitting and looking at the tea mountains in the distance, I feel comfortable. The only drawback is that there is no buffet (except breakfast). The resort is very large, including a golf course. In the evening, no one played golf. It was very beautiful to watch the sunset. The hotel environment and service are first-class, and I will still choose to stay here next time. It is a good place to cultivate body and mind.

She communicated by phone and WeChat, and patiently helped us suggest itineraries and book various activities. Shawn, the lobby manager in the introduction of the hotel tour, also left a deep impression on our family, explaining in detail, let people discover many moving details of Fuchun Mountain Residence. Second, the scenery is great. The building itself and the mountains, rivers and trees are very much in line with the oriental elegant and timeless aesthetics. The tea forests and pavilions seen from the lake gallery look like a section of "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" (the section in the photo). It is recommended that you must go to the open-air verandah of Hulangju to experience lunch or afternoon tea. The scenery is the best in the whole store. The third is that the food is great, and the breakfast has local characteristics. The beef burgers and tiramisu at Hulangju are also delicious (that is, the tiramisu is easy to melt in hot weather, without adding various gels, so you can freeze it for a while). Finally, among the various activities booked this time, tea picking is worth experiencing; it is recommended that you reserve enough time for copying scriptures, and it is best to reserve two hours after copying an article; the ancient brick rubbings are real antiques, but we The finished product is slightly flawed, and the color is a bit monotonous. Adding a small red print will make it look better.

msg:This hotel has good and bad reviews from guests at two extremes.

I was confused before. But after staying here, I immediately understood that the guests with good reviews have not encountered any trouble, and the hotel will continue to send souvenirs to increase their goodwill. Whenever a guest encounters a little bit of trouble before and during their stay, and given the hotel's arrogant attitude, negative reviews are considered polite.

Without him, the hotel is immersed in its own world. The scariest thing is not that the hotel only cares about money, but that it doesn't take the guests' interests, health, and privacy seriously. If you look at the negative reviews on Ctrip after the actual stay, and then look at the hotel’s responses after the negative reviews, you can probably understand what’s going on. I basically went through a lot of copying without distortion.

Although I was furious at the hotel, I didn't mean to say anything bad. The service staff were polite and courteous, which is commendable. Da Chi Bistro is really delicious. What's disgusting is the management, not the service staff. Objectively speaking, the hotel itself is far from comfortable and has the simplest mini bar. The landscape mainly relies on an artificial lake. Yes, I didn't expect that there is no Fuchun River at all. The entire hotel is surrounded by an artificial lake, and cruise ships also circle around the artificial lake. In winter, the hotel is very quiet during the day. There are not many guests, and it feels like a zero park. At night, the lights were brightly lit, there was singing and dancing, and all kinds of good-looking girls came out. It was enviable that they were in a state of revelry and dissipation. No wonder the business was booming and they were full of confidence.

Finally, I would like to remind individual travelers to be cautious when checking in, because after checking in, they will understand that they are not the hotel's target customers at all. What we can do is to pray not to get into trouble, and secondly to see if our mental endurance is strong. If we are not careful, there will be endless consequences.

msg:Coming from Shanghai, I asked Ctrip staff to confirm the epidemic prevention policy with the hotel in the early stage. The hotel said that starting from the low-risk area, inspections are conducted twice every day. However, when I scanned the QR code when I got off the expressway, it immediately showed a yellow code.
Then I was taken by a police car to a certain checkpoint for a unified landing inspection. I filled out a double-sided form and communicated with the computer message. Then I took the nucleic acid test and was told that I could be released without any problem.
As a result, they were intercepted for half an hour at a certain entrance and were asked to provide the same information again. Finally, they were let through.
When we arrived at the hotel entrance because the yellow code did not allow entry, we did not do anything. We dragged the baby from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock without having lunch. I proposed to make some lunch first and we would solve the problem together. I returned to Shanghai and it took a long time to say to myself. It was the duty manager who said we could check in. I asked if lunch had arrived. The child was very hungry and the snacks I gave her were not enough. What did this girl say? I said lunch and she said you can just go to the restaurant and eat - your only responsibility is to let me check in and pay for the room, but spending money later is just the beginning.
I added this housekeeper on WeChat on the first day and asked for a long time if there were any other activities even if I was only staying in the hotel. I didn’t reply for a long time. The result of yoga was that it was fully booked. However, they also said that one person had canceled and asked me to use one with my child. I think as long as I can have something to do, I liked it as a child so I went there. It turned out that there were only four people in total. I was very skeptical about the so-called full reservation, but let's leave it at that.
This butler gave me the impression that you are gentle but have a very poor sense of service and honesty.
1. There are only 10 people in the yoga class I just mentioned. At first it was said that it was full on the same day and the next day. But when I went there, there were 4 people in total including my children and me.
2. The front desk is all interns. Freshmen can make mistakes. If they make mistakes, they should be humble and correct. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
I asked the staff member named shí where to do yoga. She said it was at Fuchun Pavilion. Why did you come out so late? You are late. I came out for yoga at 4:17 at 4:30. She said it would take a long time to get to Fuchun Pavilion. I was at a loss and said, "You didn't make a reservation for the car, right?" I said in a responsible tone. Later, a car came to take us to Fuchun Pavilion. But the housekeeper called me and asked me where I was. I said it was in Fuchun Pavilion, and she said it was in the lobby. While I was doing it, I took my kids to find a car to ride back. On the way back, I happened to meet the staff who asked me to go to Fuchun Pavilion. I said I was doing yoga over there in the lobby. She said it was at Fuchun Pavilion. The staff next to me said no. It's not in Fuchun Pavilion...I'm speechless
3. When I made an appoin**ent at the spa and asked if there was a promotion price, she said there was no result. I later found out at the front desk that there was a promotion price, otherwise it would have been 1680rmb instead of 988 yuan. (Fortunately, I took a photo and there was no way to tell that there was no promotion price, let alone that there were activities. It’s over or something. Since it’s over, it shouldn’t be placed in such an obvious place at the front desk!)
4. Asked the butler how long it would take to reach the destination by car. I asked several times but no reply.
5. Morning prayers 9-9:30 and 9:30-9:50 for copying scriptures. I also told the staff of Fuchun Pavilion, WeChat and the housekeeper to make an appoin**ent to pick up the car at 9:50 and take me back to the front desk. The nucleic acid result for 10 o'clock has not yet been received. When the staff arrived, they didn't see the housekeeper and didn't reply (it's understandable that he has other duties). At 9:59, the lady at the front desk said very fiercely, "Didn't you make an appoin**ent with someone with nucleic acid at 10 o'clock?" I said I made an appoin**ent to pick me up at Fuchun Pavilion, but he never came. Why did you question me instead?
6. I slept very early. My child had allergies. He had a rash on his back and kept coughing. He also said that at about 5 o'clock in the morning, there was an irregular banging sound that woke him up. The closet light could not be turned off, so it stayed on all night. The housekeeper said the housekeeper's reply: Is it difficult to change your room and ask more about the children? I'll solve it myself, and I don't expect you to solve it either.
I discussed this issue with Ctrip before I came here. Fortunately, I am used to bringing allergy medicine with me.
7. I made a nucleic acid appoin**ent at 10 o'clock on the third day and said that I wanted to postpone it to 10:30. It took a long time until 10 o'clock. She replied and said that it was not possible, so two shifts could be arranged. Then the actual dispatching vehicle could be arranged. I arranged it for 10:00 the next day: 30?
I didn’t want to waste any words, so I just said I’d go by myself and asked her where was the address? I asked at 10 o'clock and she replied at 11 o'clock with the address that single-tube nucleic acid cannot be made at all.
The experience at this hotel is all about solving problems yourself don't rely on these poor services
8. I didn’t bring a swimsuit, so I went to the front desk to ask about the price of the swimsuit. Then my sister-in-law Liang said it was not open to the public, but the housekeeper said it was available. Haha, the internal management is a mess!
9. Since I can’t leave the hotel due to hotel issues, why are you trying to trick me into doing something in Hangzhou? A bowl of noodles is 88 yuan, and some vegetarian dishes are 88 yuan.

Why am I here when I am forced not to leave the hotel? I spent nearly 5,000 yuan here for three days and two nights!

Please avoid lightning in this hotel! The service is extremely poor!

There is no reason for the bleak business in the tourism industry caused by the epidemic. Other hotels still have a high sense of service and care about the experience of staying. This hotel just deceives you into spending money. When you leave, it will give you two bottles of watercolor and send you off warmly.
There are so many hotels in Fuyang. I really don’t want to come here again.

I originally booked a one-bedroom villa for 3,700 yuan, and then five people went to open another room for an additional 2,500 yuan. As a result, he said that upgrading to a two-bedroom villa only requires an additional 700 yuan, which is equivalent to a two-bedroom villa for 4,400 yuan. As a result, when I checked out the next day, I was told that the two-bedroom villa cost 8,200 yuan, and 4,400 yuan was the upgrade fee. I was really speechless, too expensive, there was no value, very dissatisfied, and I will never go there again in the future

After remarking with the hotel, the hotel service is very meticulous, and it has been split in advance, and the room type has also been upgraded. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is also very delicious, and there are small gifts for parting 😍😍😍 Five-star recommendation, a hotel that must not be missed in Fuyang👍

msg:The toilet part of the toilet is too small, the exhaust air is broken, and the phone is broken and I can’t reach the front desk.
The whole room is very small and compact, the lobby and public area are too large, and there is a feeling that the public share area of buying a house is too large
In terms of service, it is obvious that the service staff is severely insufficient during the epidemic. It is also necessary to wait and urge to deliver samples. The hotel facilities are not open, and the hotel facilities are not informed, and there is no introduction. This time Ctrip is at this price. 1688 staying in I feel consistent, but the original price of more than 3,000 rooms here is completely non-cost-effective
There are Chinese and Western restaurants in the hotel restaurant, which charge a 16% service charge. What is worth complaining about is that there is no service at all. I feel that they are all interns. I don’t have a sense of service and the dishes are okay.
There is a Huanggongwang Forest Park in the surrounding scenic spots. There is a farmhouse below the scenic spot. There is nothing else, just stroll around the hotel. The recommended index is two stars.

One room is upgraded to a villa. The indoor space is average, but the outdoor environment of the villa is good. The villa as a whole is still satisfactory. The weather is good and the sun is very comfortable
Supplies are average.
The catering is medium and high. The breakfast is simple and understandable, but the quality is generally beyond justifiable. It is recommended to strengthen, it can be semi-self-help, but the things provided can be better.

msg:I have always wanted to see the scenery of Fuchun Mountain Jutuli. This golf resort hotel in Fuyang District, Hangzhou really amazed us! The environment is very private, and there is also a villa area inside which can accommodate families or groups. I heard from the locals that the hotel’s specifications are very high. It used to be a membership system. Because there was a large golf course inside, it was later opened to the public!
(Manual at thanks to "Hotel Front Office➕ Tang Rong")


🏞Room view:
We were upgraded to a lake-view suite for free. The room is very large, with a living room, bedroom, and bathroom. The window view directly faces a small lake of the hotel. The overall decoration is very Zen.

🏨Hotel facilities:
As it should be! Typical resorts have standard equipment: Chinese and Western restaurants, sports facilities, as well as special tea rooms and Buddhist halls, where you can carefully copy scriptures and repair Buddha. The hotel also provides boutique dim sum and Fuyang Longjing. In addition, many paid items are provided, such as ancient style photography, cruises, etc. Of course, there is also golf.
The overall environment is designed by a professional team, full of national style and artistic conception! Even the design team boldly used fresh persimmons to decorate, adding a lot of autumn charm.

🥘Restaurant:
The dinner restaurant tastes great! It feels like one of the best restaurants in Fuyang! The breakfast buffet is also good, the ingredients are fresh, and the dishes are very local.

【service】
From the Ctrip booking, the hotel confirmation before the trip, and the welcoming, reception, restaurant reception, and car service after arrival are perfect!
Special thanks to the little sisters "Cheng Mengmeng" and "Chen Yingjing" at the front desk for their warm and thoughtful service.
【Meals】
The dishes at the Chinese Restaurant·Dazhi Xiaoguan are very good!

The tea tasting room on the top of the mountain can copy scriptures, taste tea, and have an invincible view of the mountain top...

Looking forward to the next stay!

Due to the need to inquire about the epidemic prevention and control requirements, I called the hotel twice the day before and said that a twin room is needed. After placing the order the next day, the phone told me that I need to charge an extra 500 yuan for demolition. This is very speechless. Why didn’t I say on the phone yesterday? After arriving at the store, I took the initiative to upgrade my suite to reduce my unhappiness. The Fuchun Pavilion at the highest point is a good place to copy the scriptures for meditation. The dust on the bedside phone is not clean enough, and there are no other shortcomings. It is a good place to experience the tranquility and beauty.

msg:The biggest advantage of the hotel is its good environment, surrounded by green plants, lawns, tea gardens, lakes and distant mountains. There is a sense of indifferent paradise, which makes the body and mind relax. The service is also very good, the staff can take the initiative to say hello, after check-in, jojo at the front desk took me around the hotel, familiar with the environment, responsive to requests, and solve problems in time. The Fuchun Pavilion on the mountain is a place for copying scriptures, painting, and writing calligraphy. The staff are also very enthusiastic. The welcome fruit of the day was very fresh. Because we learned that we need to celebrate our birthday, the staff also specially prepared exquisite cakes, thank you.
The hotel has a Chinese restaurant and a Western restaurant. The breakfast buffet is relatively simple, with fewer types. I went to two restaurants for dinner, and the tastes were not bad.

The disadvantage of the hotel is that the hardware is a bit old. There is no makeup mirror in the guest room, which is very inconvenient for me who is short-sighted. The guest room staff told me that there is no vanity mirror in the standard room and there is in the suite. I can only answer this question... There is no night light in the guest room, and it is not very convenient. In addition, the air-conditioning vent in the room is directly facing the head of the bed. This design of blowing the air against the head should be avoided, which is very easy to get sick. So I turned off the air conditioner when I entered the room. Fortunately, it was not hot when it cooled down that day.

If you navigate to the hotel lobby, you must locate: Fuchun Mountain Resort Swimming Hall.

The hotel's spa is very good, the environment is comfortable, and the music makes the whole body relax.

Yes, it’s a pity that it’s still three hours away from Shanghai. Otherwise, I’ll get a membership card.
The only thing I was dissatisfied with was the late check-out. I made a good point, but I called to urge it at 12:30. In fact, I saw that the occupancy rate today is not high at the end of the holiday, and it’s not very sympathetic.

The attitude of the service staff is very good and the environment is beautiful. Surprisingly, the Chinese food is very delicious. It is more delicious than our dinners at Naked Castle and Qiushui Villa. The only thing that makes me think it would be perfect in my heart if the breakfast can be improved. The breakfast is very simple. At the same time, I was very surprised and fortunate to have a cruise with the general manager of the hotel. From the conversation to the introduction to us, the passengers felt very comfortable and assured of returning home! Reluctant to leave. It's worth checking in. It's a pity that I didn't have time to experience the spa. Be sure to make up next time.

The environment is also very good, clean and meticulous.
The entertainment activities are actually very rich. There are study rooms, calligraphy writing, cycling, spa, sauna, swimming, and various chess games. It really feels like you can stay in it all the time~
For breakfast, the choices are a little bit less, for example, there are a little bit less desserts, and I didn't see any wontons, but the quality of the dishes is good.

There are not many menus in Chinese and Western restaurants, but the dishes are exquisite and delicious, and the ingredients are very good. We go to the swimming pool when we are full. There are only two of us in the big swimming pool. There are not many kinds of breakfast, but they are all my favorites. I have a full meal every day and I will lose weight when I come back.

The heavy lines constructed by Chinese architecture are perfectly presented here in the lobby, lounge area, and swimming pool.
The service is very warm and thoughtful. Breakfast is available in buffet and semi-buffet. If you choose semi-buffet, you can breathe in the fresh air on the river surface in the morning mist, accompanied by birds and insects, and serve an exquisite breakfast.
The golf course can be booked in advance, or you can walk around the course. It is a good time to blend in in the south of the Yangtze River.

       其次就是房間部分，本酒店有70間房，我定的是一個湖景房，訂房軟件寫的是36平，但是房間滿打滿算也衹有25平米，房間裏放一張床，就沒空間了，（大家可以看照片），安曼即使是在因為本來就是老建築改造無法做大的城市酒店比如Amangaller，最基本的房間都是40起跳，而在比較偏遠地方的度假酒店房間那最少都是80平起跳了。         
      再説房間裏的硬件，從始至終，房間裏的Wi-Fi就沒連上過，前台回覆説有時候能連上有時候不能，房間裏的馬桶有明顯的一圈臟，沖屁股的水注速度被跳到最大，一下子沖上去那酸爽都差點把菊花給沖凋零了，大家可以看圖，由於臨近湖岸，所以房間裏一股濃重的黴味兒，這也是臨湖房子的通病，空調進風口擋板上面一層黴；床頭左右兩邊一邊有插座一邊沒有，空調出風口正對床頭腦袋，叫了酒店工程部他們也無能為力，就這樣一間面積縮水，空調對頭吹一夜，滿屋黴味兒的，馬桶也沒打掃乾淨的房間，還去碰安曼是因為欺負客人都沒見過世面嗎？
      在酒店做了spa，晚餐吃了小火鍋，還安排了做抄經，服務員都不錯，禮貌並且懂分寸，再次感謝三樓餐廳和印尼spa妹妹，早餐比較普通，跟房價配不上套。
      前台就一言難盡了，其實應該是二言難盡，但是算了，也不會再來了打發時間了。

環境優美、安靜，在到處彷彿有一億人的情形下住在這裏依然顯得人很少。唯一建議是早餐中餐廳動線佈局待改進、稍顯侷促，拿東西不太方便。西餐廳湖景無敵，室外用餐體驗很棒！

中餐廳很一般。菜品品質一般，服務員耐心不夠。這個價位以及服務費都收得很牽強。

靠山近湖，比較潮，被褥不太幹。

管家Rachael漂亮親切，迴應及時，一有問題馬上幫忙解決，表示感謝～

酒店導覽人員的熱忱及對酒店的向心力令人感動。

唯一小小的遺憾是這次又到很多攜孩子同行的家庭，孩子們非常吵鬧，除了亂跑外，在餐廳裏還不斷的敲打，也不見家長出來教導任由孩子吵鬧。破壞了整個環境。

我個人更喜歡之前比較簡約大氣的擺設，這次也覺得花藝陳設退步不少，不知道是因為過多的展示品，還是布展的陳列，令人有種格格不入的感覺。

我入住多次，餐飲仍維持一定的水平，服務確實有更加提升，但是空間陳列卻大不如前。愛之所以責之。不過此次入住的優惠，也確實力度很大。

樓下鴨子嘎嘎的叫，每一個服務員都會主動打招呼。
本來還有些忐忑，幾乎沒有人，天又是降温，會不會不好，沒想到服務各方面還是很專業的。

設施：大小遊泳池不同人羣，汗蒸地方不大但還是很舒服的。户外小童樂園區域不大但適合小朋友玩，還有個小旋轉木馬，寶寶玩得不亦樂乎。

衞生：整體來説沒有死角，客人少的情況下這麼大的區域，能夠保證清潔也是不容易的。這裡有一點點小不足，小童泳池的水有些泛綠，建議人少也要保證清潔，特別是小童用的區域。

環境：環境不用説，富春山居，躺着就是在畫裏，心情舒暢。

服務：管家小哥哥服務非常好，隨叫隨到。路過的每一個服務員也都會主動打招呼。小朋友逮着餐廳的服務員小姐姐尬聊，真的是添麻煩了。

整體很滿意，希望還有機會再來！

msg:富春山居是多年前的情懷，也是青春期內心的繁花，當年看見志玲姐姐和華叔的表演劉一直在嬸嬸的腦海裏，十多年前近3000的價格把我嚇到腿軟，這次遇到攜程超級驚喜無敵團購價，直接開通花唄拉滿團購。
       套餐房間很大，設施低調又奢華，沒有任何浮誇的感覺，男女衣櫃分開，處處體現着低調的奢華。五星好評來評價富春山居有點拉低富春山居的格調了，去的時候正好下雨，迎賓打傘提行李一樣沒拉下，前台管家小陳貼心服務，所有套餐內容講解到位，有問題諮詢都是秒回。
       正好是淡季，選擇較多，加錢升級到鷗波套間，直接可以看湖景。帶娃可以考慮下，可以看見幾衹鵝晃來晃去，晚上時不時聽見鵝在叫，比較有童趣。房間超大，沙發睡感比床好，一路開車有點乏，躺上去睡了兩小時，偏硬的睡感，醒來腰部挺舒服。要説缺點，就是少個露台，抽煙要跑很多路。泳池挺震撼的，這麼大一個泳池能做到20多℃恆温，小童池也做的很精緻，在我的認知裏，2000以內套房酒店的泳池富春山居是最好的一個沒有之一，遊了一把，桑拿房泡了下湯，再蒸了一把，這幾天陰雨綿綿身上的痠痛感明顯減輕很多。
      早飯含了雙人份，我們帶娃很自覺的告訴工作人員娃過1米2了，對方一看才過一點都沒收娃的費用，雖然錢不多，但真的很暖心。煎蛋的師傅每次送煎蛋出來都會問下餐桌上沒有煎蛋的客人是否需要煎蛋，需要雙面還是單面？
       第二天難得遇到天氣多雲轉陰沒有下雨，上山抄經選擇了走路上去，山裡獨有的清新空氣，會讓心情愉悦不少。到了藏經閣，讓老婆和娃去抄經了，知道自己幾斤幾兩，我很識趣的去一樓沙發上打盹去了，如果你沒有靜下心來的能力最好別上去抄經，有個小夥陪女伴裝了會忍不住開始小聲説話，其實對邊上人影響挺大的。
       富春山居的早飯品種不多，但很精緻，幾乎沒有預製。讓我最無法忍受就是前幾天在其他地方吃的早飯裏面油條都是預製菜。

2.正如很多網友點評，酒店雖然有些年數，但是整體維護地很好，不影響入住體驗。房間地面鋥亮，阿姨打掃地很乾凈。
3.酒店環境清幽，隱世獨立。非常適合放鬆放空。
4.酒店中餐廳大痴小廚的菜品水準不錯，值得一試。
總體來説是我住過的江浙度假酒店裡比較滿意的酒店，推薦。

msg:非常棒的一次度假體驗。
入住前，管家小陳就主動聯繫，告知酒店各項服務和賓客活動，特意提醒其中需要提前預約的項目，考慮到二娃家庭，幫我們安排了較大的雙床房和沙發床。
酒店建在富春江畔羣山中，車道旁綠蔭環繞，猶如駛在景區之內。雖然酒店有差不多20年的歷史，但整體非常有韻味，中西合璧，大堂有點類似峇里島度假酒店的風格，兩側迴廊有風調雨順四大金剛畫像。
晚上5點有工作人員介紹酒店的山居之旅，我們首次入住參觀下來很有幫助。白天有定時班車來回酒店最高點富春閣，供奉有濟公神像，可以抄經祈福。
酒店的SPA中心也傳承了峇里島的特色，內有來自印尼的小姐姐。方形泳池的所在大堂很壯觀，非常出片。
唯一不足之處是酒店早餐種類偏少，但口味非常不錯，餐廳面山臨水，風景無敵。
總體非常滿意，環境、服務都非常棒。

江南富春江畔的富春山居度假村，詩畫山水的選址，黃公望晚年隱居之地。白牆、青磚、灰瓦、竹林，擁湖光附山色，還原黃公望“富春山居”中的山水畫卷。2004年建成至今已近20年，歷經歲月侵蝕，但整體維護很好，靜謐唯美的空間，平靜祥和的狀態，由內而外散發迷人氣韻。超愛這種避世舒緩空靈的氛圍，選擇山居開啟一場跨年重遊之旅，不亦樂乎？！

#最愛之特色餐飲# 酒店餐食出品從來就是酒店評級最主要的選項之一。富春山居酒店雖衹有2家餐廳但都各具特色。中餐廳大痴小館，設計靈感源於古老的中國茶樓，東方式紅燈籠、卧榻點綴於仿古隔柵與挑高建築的中式設計。早餐在此享用，有中式西式選擇，品種不多但出品精緻。西餐廳湖廊居，全日餐廳，下午茶和晚餐在此安排。跨年小火鍋優秀，牛肉、海鮮、豆製品還有蔬菜各大拼盤，搭配合理，品優量足。新年一頓熱氣騰騰的火鍋，更應景更有氛圍感哦！
#最愛之大師設計# 富春山居是兩位安縵頂尖大師JMG和Jaya聯袂攜手在中國的首秀，耗時七年打造，成就東方美學奢華酒店的經典傳奇。圓柱、迴廊、裝飾藝術，對稱與平衡，移步一境，從青山翠竹包圍的大門，從大堂到走廊再到客房，禪意空間與光影神韻相得益彰。由台灣花藝大師凌宗湧先生主理的酒店花藝，也一樣是大師妙筆中的錦上添“花”。
#最愛之文化體驗# 酒店結合跨年推出創新主題活動，可以逛逛山居的元旦迎新市集，試試砸金蛋、畫糖畫、學剪紙、放煙花，看看藝術畫展，賞賞絢爛煙花，感受跨年的喜悦與歡樂。不過最喜歡的還是登上度假村制高點富春閣，在這裏俯瞰酒店全景，更可以靜心在此書法抄經新年祈福。當然還有號稱亞洲最美泳池之一的酒店室內泳池，榫卯結構穹頂和一池墨潭碧水相呼應~

感謝這次酒店服務管家William滿分5星好評！服務指數100分！還真是有緣，當日抵達前台幫我們辦理入住的正是前日提前加微信聯繫的William，服務周到貼心，安排小車送我們到別墅，房間裏已經提前準備了歡迎水果和多樣點心，是顏值口味齊上線的美美下午茶沒錯噠！！有什麼要求問題隨時聯繫，儘管是在跨年元旦期間客人多事務忙的情況，及時回覆解決並幫忙安排。
總之這次入住體驗全程完美總體滿分！跨年火鍋+璀璨煙火，新年祈福+美好加持！！

msg:十分滿意的一次旅程，富春山居不虧是老牌奢華度假村，雖然二十多歲高齡，但是設施維護的很好，用料以今天的眼光看仍然非常不錯。管家JOJO在出發前便會提前聯繫，確認行程以及預約活動，非常愉快的體驗。

不過整體美中不足的是早餐的品類比較一般，同時因為餐廳動線設計的問題，找起東西比較繁瑣，建議改進。

酒店的服務是無可挑剔的，從代客泊車開始到酒店游泳，遇到都是和藹可親的酒店員工。尤其是我們美麗可愛的管家小喬，對客人關懷備至，處處顯示高端酒店管理人員的素質。

酒店裡每個人都是笑臉盈盈的，我們的管家屠經理很貼心，我們有任何事情都可以找他，我們想隨便逛逛他也會開小車把我們送去路口，告訴我們哪些地方可以走，還提出帶我們去別墅參觀參觀，但是很可惜我們自己沒時間去，下次有機會再來的時候再去看看。
帶小朋友的話一定要去萌寵樂園，動物很多，樂園的工作人員非常熱心，帶了兩衹小狗來接我們，到了樂園也一直陪着小朋友們，給我們講解，介紹每個小動物，體驗感非常好！

很喜歡這家酒店！

每間房都有專屬管家，我們的管家是Holly，非常熱情，有求必應，幫我們約好了各種活動，給Holly好評～
桑拿非常舒服，走了一天泡一泡、蒸一蒸，舒服多了。spa據説美療師是峇里島的，聽聞手法很贊，帶着娃就沒嘗試。在門口聞了下精油小樣，感覺很不錯的樣子。看了下價格也很感人…
晚餐吃的西餐，味道不錯，但不驚艷。服務費16%有點貴了…早飯在中餐廳，味道不錯，但品種偏少。
用完早餐約了旅拍，攝影師小姑娘拍的不錯，抓拍小朋友的pose和表情蠻靈的，打包入手一套照片，準備DIY個相冊打印。
之後在酒店裡徒步走了一大圈，大草坪確實贊，茶山也很美，小動物很可愛，空氣真的沒的説，太舒服了。
美中不足的是，親子服務有待提高，小朋友衹提供了一次性牙刷、拖鞋和浴袍，新的同等級的酒店都是提供完整一套小朋友洗漱用品了，包括沐浴露、牙膏等。小朋友的拖鞋也很拉胯，質量和大人的比差多了，兒子説穿着很不舒服。
下次的話，價格暫時勸退，等有合適活動再入手…

我們是元旦跨年去的，酒店那天晚上安排了煙花，酒店山上有個小動物園，可以餵食，小朋友很喜歡，晚餐酒店吃的，價格有些辣手，口味還不錯。   最後説一下槽點，酒店早餐和連鎖5星酒店比有很大差距，早餐是中餐廳需要和別人拼大圓桌，挺奇怪的，不曉得為啥不安排在西餐廳。酒店住宿的數量決定了不能花樣很多，這個可以理解，但是出品的質量也是大跌眼鏡，如果用的晚上中餐廚子，不應該這麼差，真是沒啥可吃的，總體還是一次滿意的旅行，套餐中有旅拍，雖然加錢付了照片，以後也是回憶。

msg:酒店靠近富春江，離富春山居圖的作者，一代大師黃公望隱居處很近，黃公望故居紀念館有比較逼真的富春山居圖可以仔細觀看。亮點是還有幾卷仿作，包括乾隆皇帝收藏的贋品也在，皇上特別喜歡，出去玩也帶着，題了好多次字，把一幅畫寫滿了。。。所以，普通人看畫就是看個名氣，皇上也看走眼不知道自己珍藏把玩的是假貨。。
酒店風景餐飲和管理不都錯，每個員工都很熱情。住店還有專屬管家，尤其最深的印象是小喬經理，專業服務很到位，賓至如歸，細節完美。

— 客房木地板有點吱吱嘎嘎，起夜有點吵，🤫。馬桶配了衞洗麗，儘管是老型號，但比好多五星都強，就是抽水老需要手工復位，可能要更換零件了；淋浴房換過新的蓮蓬頭，漢斯格雅品牌不恆温，我們三樓這個客房水壓不足，水温忽高忽低，得小心一點。
— 健身房器械太簡單，不符合五星酒店定位，是短板。
— 餐廳整體都滿意，尤其白天重油重糖之後，晚上回到酒店就想清淡健康，兩晚都在西餐廳湖廊居找到合適組合，唯一遺憾是沒有杯賣的葡萄酒。

服務方面，所有交流過的工作人員都非常得體，酒店有專人管家（William）服務，任何需求都可以直接找他對接，i人舒適。

酒店還贈送了旅拍，遇到了攝影師孫老師，特別會引導和取景，創意無限，拍到了很多人生照片。
非常推薦這個度假村和旅拍活動。

親子設施挺多，我們用了小童嬉水池，體驗不錯。
散步時走到寵物樂園想順便進去看看，但是不能當場買票，一定要在精品店買好了票再過去，很不靈活。
不足之處是房間到早餐所在的中餐廳沒有電梯，不方便推車。
服務不錯，管家小屠很貼心很主動。不過夜床服務感覺沒有必要。

服務很好，管家小喬盡心盡力，早早做了妥帖的安排，過程中也特別細心。導覽岳女士的講解很精彩，讓很多精緻和景緻被我們更好的看見和感受。
湖畔漫步，抄經祈福，中意這個讓人可以靜心的地方。再約。

msg:酒店整體的確不新了，但運維狀況很好，加之本身大氣的對稱設計，隨處可見的中式花藝及書法畫作，藝術氣息濃厚。宗教元素亦遍佈酒店四處，使得整個空間呈現出一種莊重意味。

房間內部，套房面積75平較為寬敞，功能格局劃分較好，還有專門飲茶的配置，圓桌上有鮮花花藝，這點很贊，還請客人品嚐當地釀造的米酒，十分甜美清爽。木質百葉窗外，滿眼綠意（溪流噴泉竹林灌木），實木桌上寫着卡片：房間可能有小松鼠🐿️親密互動，可見此處生態環境之佳。

酒店餐廳大痴小館是有名的，很多人認為這家餐廳被低估了，甚至有人驅車從杭州市內奔波來此用餐。我對蘇浙菜並不熱愛，但比較推薦響油鱔絲。

酒店作為度假村活動比較豐富，遊船、祈福抄經、手作等等。最為人稱道的應該是無波游泳池，榫卯結構，光影十分優越。晚上可以去泡池和汗蒸。

酒店服務五星，管家JOJO很nice提前幫忙安排活動和房間，送了一瓶蜜月紅酒。

杭州富春山居和揚州迎賓館是最近一年兩個讓我對中式裝潢，園林造景之美徹底改觀的地方，覺得真的很好看，而不是覺得單純老派。富春這裡有很多橘子樹柚子樹，都很有靈氣

然後這裏可以打高爾夫可惜我衹會在switch 上打。。。有點浪費了。以及天氣冷了沒玩上槳板，其他都很好，酒店管家小羊很負責，有求必應。

哦哦唯一美中不足是我覺得旅拍水平一般哇，沒拍出酒店的美，甚至還有幾張沒對上焦，希望反饋反饋。

房間好多凳子哈哈，該有的都有，作為04年開業的酒店保養的也不錯
酒店活動賊多！酒店的tour，這個建議入住當天就參加，介紹了點歷史和設施分佈。抄經我也挺喜歡的，要抄完建議留三小時，班車一小時一趟，外面有個大露台。
早飯很好吃！麪包丹麥酥驚艷到我！還有每日特色！
晚飯叫到房間吃的，味道不錯，就是為什麼佛跳牆裡有魚頭啊!還這麼大盆！！
spa有活動的時候還挺划算，温柔印尼小姐姐按的。月餅也挺好吃。
付費項目之遊船有點子坑，和西溪悦榕莊比實在是差挺多...香包製作也一般般吧

msg:入住體驗非常一般 。
1、沒有管家提前溝通 ，大門口保安也查不到我的入住訊息，並讓車子停下等候。
2、當我告知前台是銀婚紀念日時，能否稍微佈置得温馨一點，回答沒有，衹能送一瓶紅酒，紅酒很廉價，我們沒有食用，退房時留在房間裏了。可見酒店的敷衍，比起住過的那些大酒店集團的服務真是差遠了。
3、房間設施不僅陳舊，連化粧鏡都沒有。
4、套餐買的一些權益看似很多 其實都有點忽悠，比如山居之旅，以為會帶着走一圈整個度假村，哪知衹是在大堂、餐廳兜一下。
5、早餐沒有奢牌酒店的水準，中餐廳做出的西點蛋糕、蛋卷真的差強人意。
就算設施老舊，服務也不應該差太多吧，不會推薦周圍朋友去

🌻首先酒店的建築很漂亮，世界著名設計師在中國的首個作品。當天的值班經理帶領我們參觀了酒店，雖是二十年前建造，設計的精妙還是震撼到我，尤其是游泳館的設計太驚艷了。酒店的裝飾也有特點，用的是真花真樹真果實。加上園藝師的巧思，處處充滿了生機。

🌻酒店的服務真是一大亮點，有管家服務。我的灑店管家Jojo在入住的前一天就主動和我聯繫。入住時又耐心地講解，處處貼心地提醒。每個項目可為我預約，離店時還送我文創商品作禮品，非常感謝!

🌻酒店有許多活動項目：遊船、抄經，酒店遊覽等。我蠻喜歡酒店遊覽，就是每天有一位服務者帶領住客邊遊覽酒店，邊講講這裏的歷史，十分有趣。酒店為我預約了旅拍項目，在酒店內拍攝效果很好。攝影師小倩服務好，技術佳，1小時拍攝，選片時捨不得刪除，因此都留下了，生圖也很好看。

🌻酒店和《富春山居圖》中的“剩山圖”很有淵源，也是依圖而建，景緻極好，抄經可去富春閣，可也湖邊散步，下午坐在西餐廳的圍廊上飲着茶，看山看水，很是愜意。總之，酒店很美，像住在畫中一樣。

🌻餐飲方面也不錯，酒店的中餐廳名為“大痴小館”，在當地很有名。早餐也在這裏裏，7點至10點。每天有兩道特色點心，每位客人來用餐，服務者會主動詢問煎蛋要幾分熟，很貼心，餐食每天也有微調，整理及地，服務主動。

🌻這個酒店很適合度假，愛打球的可去酒店內的高爾夫球場。享這裏的服務，賞這裏的美景。

服務細緻入微：從自駕進入酒店，前台就已經準備好了checkin登記需要的材料，歡迎茶水和毛巾同時奉上，很震驚一家已經快20年的酒店能把服務依舊做到如此細緻、貼心。管家屠經理Shawn，認真講解了富春山居典故並駕車介紹了整個酒店，作為從酒店開始籌備到現在工作20年的資深員工，屠經理的工作態度和敬業精神，也讓我理解了富春山居的員工願意真心對待客人，尊重客人，保持工作熱情，甚至低離職率的核心。
硬件該換就換：這次入住的是villa，作為一家接近20年的酒店，我們入住前對硬件沒報任何期待，衹要不粘能用，衞生狀況ok就行。但進入房間發現，馬桶更換成科勒高配智能馬桶，淋浴忘了啥牌子，但這是第一次在酒店看到配置這麼高的淋浴系統，中央空調是全新的日立，吹風機是網紅戴森。簡言之就是設備年份到了需要更換就毫不猶豫選了同品類的高配甚至旗艦產品，這對於業主是實打實的真金白銀支出，但對客人的體驗感確實也是質的提升。
最後，再次感謝管家屠經理在我們整個入住期間的悉心照顧，富春山居也確實是我們所有住過的酒店綜合體驗最棒的，沒有之一！非常期待下次入住！

msg:此次中秋選擇來富春山居度假酒店，是我做的很明智的選擇，3天2晚的時間，住的非常舒適、愉悦、輕鬆！
首先感謝我的管家——小喬～正是因為有小喬的全程陪伴，使得我的這次度假非常稱心，順利！

設施：雖説酒店2004年開業，但是完全沒有感覺酒店老舊，酒店整體是紅木很有特色，很高級。酒店很大，有山、有湖、有草坪、有閣樓、還有高爾夫球場可以去打球。
酒店有2個餐廳，1個西餐廳1箇中餐廳。推薦中餐廳，同時也是吃早餐的地方，中餐是中式，適合我們中國寶寶的胃口，特別是白粥榨菜鹹鴨蛋，早上來一碗很舒服。早餐還提供九曲紅梅紅茶，也是非常驚喜，紅茶非常好喝，用料很足，沒有加的水多了味道就淡了的情況。

衞生：很乾凈哦。

環境：可能是我住的時候人不多，酒店很大，整體很安靜，很適合度假～～

服務：管家小喬的服務槓槓滴，其他工作人員的服務也很好，有求必應。

住店期間吃了高爾夫球會的下午茶，期中包含30分鐘高爾夫練習場，感謝小喬給我預約了教練～也是我初次高爾夫體驗，非常good～

酒店Spa是特色，是從峇里島來的技師，我們體驗了雙人60分鐘精油按摩，按摩前技師先幫我們用薄荷葉、熟茶葉等泡腳，泡完疲憊已消失1/3，隨後按摩60分鐘，手法力道都很適合我，按的非常舒服，按完還有點心吃，疲勞消除100%～

酒店泳池是四四方方的，聽介紹説設計跟“華清池”差不多，20×20的泳池，很大。四周都有台階，游泳要小心些，我一開始沒注意，小腿咳嗽一層皮 o（╥﹏╥）o 

我買的酒店套餐包含桑拿體驗，桑拿區很舒服，我去蒸了會兒，很舒服，也不是特別熱，可以接受。洗完澡蒸個桑拿，可太舒服了～

總之非常推薦富春山居度假酒店，度假首選，可以打打高爾夫，喝個下午茶，坐坐遊船（我沒坐，98一人），做個spa，蒸個桑拿，遊游泳，祈福、抄抄經，在酒店內散散步等等……真的太愜意了～

泳池特別美，胖胖的教練特別熱情可愛，還是拍照好手，管家小羊也有求必應。
唯一缺陷是餐廳菜品偏鹹，看台不夠主動及時，提出的意見能及時反饋，一樣以後更好。
此行最美的酒店，有緣還會再去

設施：75平的面積還是很大的，除了床還有兩個很大的沙發榻，感覺睡4個人都可以。帶了小寶，酒店有嬰兒床提供，但是是bugaboo的摺疊床，略小，超過一歲的大寶寶可能會覺得有點短。
小童泳池超讚，水温適宜，孩子玩的很開心。

衞生：很難想象這個酒店已經20多年了，維護的很好，處處都很乾凈，園區裏遇到工人在打葯，難怪蚊子不多。
服務：服務人員禮貌也積極，因為孩子吃奶還幫忙延遲到2點退房。過紀念日還送了好吃的蛋糕。

msg:非常好的一次入住體驗，酒店生態特別好，設施完善，有一些細節特別貼心，尤其是小童泳池，有很淺的區域也有85cm的區域，適合不同年齡的孩子，水温有31度，很適合孩子玩，最貼心的是小童泳池區域還開了暖氣，完全不同害怕孩子感冒。酒店活動準備非常豐富，而且價格非常親民，油紙傘和漢服租借的價格比我預想得低很多，小童樂園裡有旋轉木馬，娃玩得都不想走了。酒店房間很大，住得非常舒心。特別要表揚一下管家Jojo，態度特別好，有求必應，回覆也非常快，退房的時候還説以後有套餐推給我，真是太貼心了。

早餐的自助餐也非常可口豐盛，每日還有兩款“今日推薦”的特色，有餐廳的服務人員提供並向客人介紹，並且味道也很在線。比如蒜香法棍、富陽沃豆腐、法式吐司等···晚餐都是在酒店的餐廳點餐，菜品味道性價比都很贊。（大痴小館）

套房裡包含的文化活動也蠻豐富的，朋友預約了攝影師拍了些家庭照很温馨。還有抄經、拓印、遊船等可以各自選擇。和朋友一起遊了泳，打了桌球～

套房裡還附送了午餐雙人套餐在湖廊居，太實在太豐盛了，幾乎可以三四人分享。並且妥妥的味道和顏值都在線。南瓜湯、餐前麪包、牛肉漢堡、雞肉吐司、意大利肉醬麪、水果、甜品提拉米蘇。

msg:當拿到房卡時，上面寫着“僕歸富春山居”，我就知道我來對了地方。

“僕歸富春山居”是黃公望在無用師捲上的題跋，意思是“我回到富春的山裡隱居”。幾百年前的題跋，印在幾百年後的房卡上，完全應景，實在是妙。

小住幾日，發現房卡衹是一個開始，餐廳的名字“大痴小館”和動物園的名字“大痴小寵”也深得我意。“大痴”是黃公望的名號，温馨雅緻的餐廳確實可稱“小館”，小體動物的動物園確實可稱“小寵”，這一大一小，一古一今的融合，再讓我感歎，妙哉。

妙不止於此，來自“富春山居圖”裏的亭子LOGO，榫卯結構劇場式泳池，凌宗湧的花藝，富春收購富春的緣分，jaya和jeanmichel的現代中國風，美院老師在創立伊始傳真舉薦“富春山居”名字的故事，無不讓我認為這裏就是“妙”的聚集地，當之無愧是中國最好的度假村。

妙之外，是真誠的服務，管家小喬做到了，“讓客人喜出望外”是服務的最高境界，能在如此“妙”的地方遇到如此“妙”的服務，妙之又妙。

祝富春山居，妙百年，百年妙。

距離上海兩三個小時的車程也非常適合週末放鬆小住，目前的酒店套餐性價比非常高，應該還會再來。

酒店的服務很不錯，員工熱情周到，管家小屠在入住過程中服務非常好，隨時聯繫都會反饋並且安排好行程。無論是用餐還是休閑娛樂，酒店都提供了多種選擇，讓人在此盡享愜意時光。

總的來説，富春山居酒店是一個休閑遊放鬆的好地方，家庭遊挺推薦來的。

酒店的泳池很漂亮，小童泳池設施也很到位，非常值得打卡；酒店的西餐廳、中餐廳都很不錯；來了酒店兩次，室內花園和廳內是不同的展覽，就是還滿有格調的。唯一一點感覺酒店有點迷宮，離店時覺得沒有逛完，希望有機會可以再來。

msg:酒店設計上和寧波東錢湖的栢悦在很多地方上是一模一樣，都是中式美學設計，燈光造型和小景設計等細節拿捏上也非常講究。
但這家度假村最令人印象深刻，超出預期的就是服務。全球各地的五六七星度假村也住過不少，各種形式的服務和標準也都見識過，但這家的服務完全可以對標，遇到的各個崗位的員工都是陽光、熱情、友善，還有氣質。這在本地化酒店還是非常難得的。
同樣，非常有幸能遇到管家💃美女小喬，整個度假期間都幫我們一家安排的非常滿意👍正是這樣的服務才讓這家度假村與眾不同。

msg:炎熱的夏日想要尋找一個可以避暑且又要非常安靜，同時又不能缺少一些娛樂項目的度假酒店。在江浙滬內尋找很多的度假酒店，在小紅書上也搜尋了很多的攻略，最後選定了杭州的富春山居高爾夫度假村。首先引入眼簾的是酒店景色，實在是美，與龍井茶園、富春江和雞籠山相伴。一進入酒店就感受大自然的氣息，和喧鬧的大都市完全相反的幽靜。從車子到達開始大堂經理屠經理就幫助我們拿行李，酒店的入住退房，介紹酒店的建造、周圍景色以及酒店內的娛樂項目。此次出行最大的亮點除了酒店景色外，那就是屠經理的服務了，全程屠經理帶着我們遊玩，我們一點也不用操心。晚餐屠經理還給我們預留了“景觀位”讓我們非常的意外和驚喜。本次出行唯一的小缺陷可能就是圍爐冰茶了，茶點點心全是膨化食物，茶水量每個人喝兩杯就沒了，圍爐冰茶套餐4個人為498元，價格與套餐質量不符。最讓我們不舒服的地方就是船上有兩把印有酒店景色的扇子，我們本以為是贈送的，可當我們準備下船時被工作人員叫住，告知這扇子是不能帶走的，那個瞬間讓我們的心情直線下降。酒店多印一些酒店景色的扇子當作紀念品送給客人，雖説物品價值不高，但會讓客人體驗感更好，這麼有特色的扇子還能當作拍照道具，又能給客人當作紀念物品又能宣傳酒店，這不是兩全其美嘛？希望酒店在這些方面上可以再提升。

當然，富春山居是高爾夫度假村，它的18洞標準高爾夫球場也是無可挑剔的。它的場地設施和服務，感覺是在我們這一帶絕對是處在頭部位置的值得優先選擇的好去處。

週六中午1點多辦理入住，從車一到酒店開始，就享受到了非常熱情的招待，酒店小姐姐在門口等我們，看到小朋友剛睡醒出來心情萎靡，特地送了小禮物給他，可愛的小魔方讓小朋友愛不釋手，辦理入住的時候我們也見到了管家小哥哥，非常有親和力，給我們拿行李，拿好喝的茶，一路送我們到房間，房間裏有柿子，但矯情的小朋友想吃香蕉，管家小哥哥專門去廚房給拿了兩根香蕉，小朋友滿意的不得了。
下午去了寵物樂園，從開船的叔叔到寵物樂園的小哥哥，每一個都感覺發自肺腑的歡迎我們，在這個寒冷的冬天，讓我們完全感受到了賓至如歸。
晚餐也非常好吃，小朋友一直説牛肉好香啊好好吃啊，猛幹了好幾塊。第二天的早餐雖然餐品不算多，但每一樣都很美味。
很期待下一次帶來，一定會再來

msg:這次通過雙十一的優惠活動，在攜程app上訂了富春山居度假酒店的2晚園景房一張，在3月預約了使用，到了酒店升級為湖景房，可參與免費和自費的活動不少，性價比很高。

設施：雖然酒店開業已有18年，設施維護保養值得肯定，有一些小瑕疵是客房部分裝修飾品老舊，應及時更換。

衞生：整體酒店的衞生很不錯，服務工作到位。

環境：酒店內外環境不錯，除了打高爾夫之外，有山有水，可以徒步登山、可以湖裡划船、可以游泳、也有不少視覺通透的場景可以發呆冥想。

服務：酒店的各個場景服務人員的態度都很棒，真正賓客至上，感覺很温馨。

msg:這是打卡清單中已列下三年的一家酒店，因為疫情，一直未曾有機會前來體驗。此次專門從北京請假，帶媽媽來入住。果然不負眾望，富春山居無論是從設計、服務還是人文環境上，都可以堪稱是著作。


設施：已開業10年+的酒店，但絲毫不會讓人感覺老，相反每一個配套設施的細節，都可以看出當年設計此酒店時的超前思維和用心至極。

設計：
是我所喜愛的著名奢華酒店設計師Jaya Ibrahim先生生前的大作，根據黃公望老先生《富春山居圖》，用另一種形式造就瞭如今的富春山居度假村。依山臨水，不僅有酒店、私人別墅、水療中心、會所及18洞專業高爾夫球場。雖然Jaya是西方人，但是他對東方美學的理解和詮釋真的是驚人的出奇。尤其是光影呈現，讓居者感受到身邊空間充滿禪意與古樸韻味。如果你對東方美學和建築之美感興趣，一定要來此打卡。花一些時間來深度體驗。

環境：
隱居山林江間的隱匿時光，大自然的美好盡收眼底，處處是景。每一處都很好地呈現了東方美學和建築哲學。無論是在餐廳、房間，向外望去，都處處是景。還可以沿小道步行去到花園小徑，也可以招呼電瓶車，去到高爾夫球場會所，遠眺一場高爾夫球賽。融於大自然中，愜意至極。


服務：
濃墨重彩的一筆，一定歸於這裏的服務文化和藝術。從最初致電預訂，前台Gsm Jojo便很好地為我們創造了第一服務體驗，因為致電時預訂部一下班，Jojo幫忙對接，並很貼心地加了微信，詢問我的具體需求。當得知是我帶媽媽一起入住後，細緻地做了一系列安排，讓人感覺很暖心。入住前也會温馨提示，給與一些小貼士。入住後，前台的Amber接待，甜美的笑容，讓我和媽媽感覺猶如回家了一樣，而不僅是入住了一個酒店。而入住後的轉天，當員工遇到我們，便會稱呼我「陳女士」，並對我點頭微笑。這種被記得的感覺着實讓人温暖、驚喜。

入住的三天兩晚中，基本上除了水療，在酒店內都體驗了一遍，無論是前台、禮賓部、餐廳同事，都是細緻入微的服務，將細節做到極致。

太多這樣温暖的瞬間，前台的Jojo, Amber, Rachel, 禮賓部的先生和帥哥們，西餐廳的Jack和一位美女，中餐廳的團隊，在很多事情的處理上靈活、貼心。還有富春閣的閣主，他的笑容讓我至今難忘，很有治癒力。旅拍的攝影師劉老師，非常敬業，成片質量很高，為旅途留下了很好的影像記錄。謝謝所有人！

總而言之，在富春山居的所有服務人員，一見面就能讓人覺得對方發自內心的親切，沒有讓人感覺公式化、死板的流程，一切都自然而然，好似要去親友家遇到來接你的家人，遇到便全身心的放鬆下來，可以對他們信賴。

這是一趟讓人非常温暖的旅行，媽媽和我都享受其中。非常值得花時間來深度體驗、感受的一個仙境，它已經超越了一個簡單度假村的功能屬性，而是一種自然與美學的融合。

很少會寫評價，但是這裏值得。推薦。

至少住三天兩晚，把時間都花在度假村裡，參加酒店內的體驗活動，體驗中西餐廳，步行至花園小徑，乘車到高爾夫球會所，清晨到富春閣祈福抄經，尋一處靜靜發呆。你將度過清幽美好的日子。

訂了兩間房兩晚，由於工作日都沒什麼人
無論是祈福抄經還是去坐船，幾乎都是包場，舒適感更上一層樓
經過別人提醒知道後花園有個小童樂園，正好經過泳池，小朋友看到泳池簡直走不動路，衹好給他買了泳衣泳帽放他去嗨了
😎友情提醒，大家如果想去游泳，建議自行帶好泳衣和泳帽哦，裏面買真是老價格了😂
而且在這裏還有一點小建議，就是泳池的水真的很冷啊，小童泳池的水大概在30度上下，大泳池更冷了，待久了還是有點受不了
酒店裡大痴小館真是讓人驚艷，在裏面吃了好幾頓了，味道不錯量也不小
一開始看別人評論説早餐是定餐衹有麪條雞蛋啥的，但實際上還是自助早餐，雖然不能算很多但也是足夠了，甚至大早上還有紅燒肉🤣（“富陽人的漢堡包”）
總之這次是非常不錯的旅行，兒子説下次還要再來，希望能有更好的體驗咯🥰

跟酒店小陳加了微信，她幫我合理安排打高爾夫，吃下午茶，還有深度酒店內遊玩，祈福等，真的非常感謝小陳細心的安排[抱拳]

因家人身體不適，受到管家和經理的頻頻問候，第一句話都是“您身體怎麼樣了”，確實體會到了發自內心的關心。

走的時候依依不捨❤️

環境太美了，一切都慢下來看着湖景～就像在水墨畫中。陽光明媚的時間和陰雨天有不一樣的韻味～工作忙裡偷閒小住兩晚，可以緩解好多的壓力～

房間有歲月的痕跡，但整體保養很好～設備沒有壞損。洗手間比較小，出門手重重敲在水池上腫了兩週…但插曲都不會影響整體的住店體驗～

再來説説還是不足的地方吧
1、進酒店以後有點微雨，想問問有沒有雨傘可以租借，正好有小姐姐來送歡迎水果。我詢問，她居然告訴我她也不知道？好吧。。你衹是送水果的。。
2、酒店吃的外賣不允許送進來，要自己做車去大門口拿，都後疫情時代了。問就説不允許接觸客人的食物，真是有點莫名其妙的一點，去前面門口拿也是保安幫我們代收啊。而且現在外賣都有封口。真的不理解。我懷疑是為了幫中餐廳拉生意才有這麼一個莫名其妙的規定。
3、酒店的中餐廳大痴小館真的建議大家別去吃。本來想着高評分不會差，結果就是非常地普通，東西不好吃，感覺還不如某些預製菜飯店，服務幾乎沒有，連問你忌口和用餐體驗都沒有。還要收超高的服務費服務了我點啥呀？
4、高爾夫區域其實主要還是由高爾夫俱樂部承包，那塊區域酒店走過去有點不便，而且都是專業打高爾夫的人你在那散步多少有點尷尬，但是出去那一塊其實酒店面積不大的。

綜上所述，如果是一千多塊的日曆價來還可以，再貴建議選別的

	除了這個小插曲，其他服務人員態度確實很好。會貼心安排接駁車，及時提供雨傘。我們在山中徒步，三個人使用了一把雨傘，接駁車路過還特意停下來又提供了一把傘。公區風景絕佳，環湖或者山間徒步，風景很美，也很出片。
	缺點是客房燈光過於昏暗，32寸的電視、上古時代的CD機和出租屋級別的窗簾，很難和奢華酒店畫上等號。飲用水使用了碧純的包裝水，不捨得用礦泉水。睡袍用黑絲捆綁包裝，也顯得有些詭異。早餐、minibar與前兄弟酒店相比，也簡單太多，早餐也沒有鮮榨果汁。總之這家酒店適合拍照體驗，但客房真的需要翻新了。

這次入住預訂了園景套房，窗邊正對小池塘。由於是老式園林酒店，沒有智能家居空置系統也在情理之中，要是後期維護能加上智能聯動設備就更好了。
坐在軟塌上，品着酒店自製的龍井茶，欣賞陽光透過竹簾打在長凳上的光影，別有一番風味。
度假村離市區約莫一小時車程，頗有世外桃源的質感，度假村裡配套活動豐富多彩，管家小陳很貼心，全程協助預訂酒店各項活動，每天還會及時根據顧客要求給予反饋，給五星服務點贊。在度假村裡絲毫不會因為遠離景點而無趣，因為在這處處是景點。
早飯後搭乘班車到半山腰的富春閣祈福、抄經，午間返回正館的大痴小館享受一頓品質午餐，下午約上山居旅拍在度假村各個地點留下美好的回憶。（在此不得不好好誇獎一番我們的旅拍攝影師阿傑，不僅瞭解酒店取景的亮點，還很會引導顧客情緒。不善於拍照的我到後面都放開了）。
可惜我們入住的這幾天碰巧趕上某私募基金到酒店搞團建，導致後續飯點大痴小館不僅人滿為患，人聲鼎沸，服務員更是忙得腳不着地，加餐換骨盤都叫不到人，衹好全程自助。建議酒店日後有類似活動，提前做好預案，以免影響其他顧客的休假體驗。

【環境】中式風滿滿，富春山居貫穿全場，不愧是Jaya啊！房間好多細節個人都很喜歡，比如窗邊都有躺椅，很適合靠着看書；電視可調節方向，躺床上或者在泡茶也都能看…不過開夜床為什麼衹備1人…

富春山居的設施保養的不錯，內外部設計獨具匠心，窗外冬雨延綿不絕，房內温暖如春，寫字枱上還有老式的留聲機，讓熱愛音樂的娃興奮不已！套房有觀湖的陽台，桌椅一應俱全，可以休息放鬆欣賞風景。在娃的好玩榜中，泳池排第一；排第二是能餵食三衹可愛的柯爾鴨的小童樂園；排第三的就是高爾夫球場，雖然球打的爛但娃玩的開心；再就是看的見湖水山色的餐廳，烹製的菜餚都十分精緻，娃覺得很可口，我則邊吃美食邊欣賞落地窗外的江南煙雨。
最讓我們眷戀的是冬日裏富春山居那遺世之美！我和娃喜歡在飯後撐着傘沿着湖邊步道散步，潮濕的青石板上爬滿青苔，路邊柔細嫩黃的臘梅花暗香浮動，不遠處丘陵上的茶樹層層疊疊充滿生機，環湖而建的富春山居錯落有致，白牆黛瓦莊重而靜謐，在朦朧的雨霧中，有一種恬淡悠閑的江南神韻。對於北方人來説，這種祥和如夢境般的美，真的衹可意會，不可言傳～~

msg:我們在富春山居度過了非常愉快的一個週末。
首先酒店的設計很精緻，雖然開業時間很長了，但是一點沒過時，和西溪悦榕莊並稱雙璧了。西溪悦榕莊更美艷，富春山居更淡雅。這次入住的是乞丐房，沒想到乞丐房也有驚喜，窗外綠蔭修竹，時不時有小鳥和松鼠過來做客。並且房間雖小，還是放了能躺平的美人榻，並且靠窗放了桌子，這點設計很超前。很多酒店都是茶几或者書桌。茶几太低了，書桌單人位，用起來都很不方便。新酒店才普及了在房間裏放個可供兩人同時使用的正常的桌子。
其次酒店的服務也很到位。入住時管家小喬帶着介紹了酒店和房間的設施，我衹有在日本的温泉酒店享受過這樣的服務。但是比温泉酒店更好的是，小喬加了微信，有求必應，安排了各項活動，還給我們貼心送了小點心。此外酒店的行李服務和開夜床也很到位。
還有推薦酒店的桑拿。本來我們都沒有注意到這一項，但是小喬和泳池管理人員都跟我們推薦，強調是免費的。結果收穫了大驚喜。除了桑拿，還有美麗的温泉泡池，而且附帶的淋浴間、廁所和梳粧台都比那種營業的温泉更高檔精緻。

地理位置比較優越，離杭州城區也就20+公里，緊鄰富春江，短距離出行小朋友也比較舒適。
酒店很大氣，在山門位置有個很有氣勢的大門，門衞師傅登記了姓名後，要沿山路開一公里多才到酒店大堂，這段路程中前台已經準備好了入住資料，很是節約時間。
酒店環境不錯，面朝一個湖，步行散步的路比較漂亮。衹是對推嬰兒車稍微不那麼友好。
服務方面很好，專屬管家Jojo很貼心，照顧得很好。

msg:🛶在旅館裏遊船觀景

⛳️富春山居是地處偏僻的一個高爾夫度假村

據説是安縵御用設計師的建築設計作品。裏面的中式園林佈景，木樑、石板、青磚、灰瓦，很有對稱性美學，感受到的是低調的奢華，完全看不出是一家開了十多年的旅館。

它將『富春山居圖』從古詩畫中復刻還原。旅館有遊船活動，可以乘着小木船，親臨感受水墨畫的美，逃離喧囂，享受幽靜安寧的度假氛圍。

🏊方正的古風泳池據説曾經還被稱為最美泳池過。配有小童遊樂設施的院子裏還有三衹寵物鴨可以逗趣🦆。

🚗每天早上有班車可以去富春閣，祈福抄經，也很有趣。

旅館裏設計的各種活動還是很豐富的，不用出門，就好好享受旅館吧。

msg:是獲得全家一行六人一致滿意的週末度假酒店。
發起人本人原意是這家近二十年的酒店再不來住就會因為嫌它老而繼續錯過。但是，酒店的維護是讓我驚喜的第一步。本身偏中式的整體建築風格好像很經得起歲月的洗禮。
第二步就是服務了，從checkin到checkout基本都沒有出現讓我們浪費時間乾等或者沒有服務人員照顧的情況。點名感謝入住期間我們的管家小鐘，所有的酒店項目都是小鐘幫忙預約，且晚上11點還在回覆我的微信，細心且耐心。
第三是花藝，深得我心。不贅述。
此行沒有安排全家高爾夫（除叔叔早起打了半張場），希望下回可以有“住宿＋打球”套餐，必須搶購。
唯一覺得可以改進的就是早餐環節。菜品或許可以有所升級，且全酒店服務窪地應該就在大痴小館了哈哈哈（僅指早餐，午餐服務還是可以的）。
總結，值得推薦也值得二刷。

總結：b格滿滿的招待酒店，長臉要麪絕對好用。。然而這價位非招待的話都很不值得。

酒店環境和風景很好，依山傍水，除了打高爾夫外，還可以徒步登山，和湖裡划船。
服務人員都很熱情，尤其感謝酒店管家小喬，很貼心的幫我們安排時間，規劃行程。
這次因為帶了寶寶，沒時間參加很多項目，就體驗了高爾夫🏌️，然後去富春閣參觀了一下。
酒店有室內和室外兩個遊樂園，小孩也可以打發時間，面積不大，不過玩的小孩也不多，我們第一天去看柯爾鴨，就是包場了。游泳池邊上的室內幼兒園，我也是偶然經過的，玩具不多，但收納的乾淨整潔。
酒店的兩家餐廳，一家中餐廳大痴小館，一家西餐廳。值得一提的是中餐廳的菜，確實不錯，如果開在杭州市區，我肯定會二刷。西餐廳的菜不多，台灣鹵肉麪挺好吃，分量足肉多。
建了20年的酒店，從設計美學上來説無可挑剔，雖然園景房相對簡陋，但畢竟這麼久了維護的也算可以，值得入住

我感受到的一些小細節：進酒店就能感受到嚴謹，門衞是會核對入住人姓名再放行的；從進酒店大堂就有一個小哥帶着，辦完入住小哥領我們去房間，很清晰地向我們介紹酒店設施和開放時間；退房日我們延遲退房了，我中間進出房間的時候能看到隔壁的房間退房後阿姨在很認真地打掃，一間房也打掃了挺久的時間；房間看出去的view非常可，我這一面朝向小池塘，中間影影綽綽的樹影遮住了池塘對面窗户的視線，很好地保護了私隱；房間的水放了8瓶，mini bar也是免費的。
活動：我們參加了畫舫遊船，從船上看有一種酒店建在湖上的錯覺，而且不論從酒店看對麪茶山和高爾夫場還是從對面看酒店，都相得益彰非常和諧，當天的天氣給力，夕陽西下時候的景色讓我覺得置身於一幅畫中。同住人報名了桑拿，整個池子衹有她一個人相當開心，泡完再蒸了幹桑拿，整個人神清氣爽。西餐廳有個雙人小火鍋，要點的話記得提前45分鐘預約，量相當大，三個人都綽綽有餘了，吃完我那個撐啊。
一些其他小點：我們的房間沒有床邊總控開關，可能要爬下去再關燈；早餐種類偏少，不過吃完再到餐廳露台喝杯咖啡，看看湖裡的鴨子引吭高歌還是蠻開心的；辦理了延遲退房，但是中午過了十二點健身房運動完回去房卡失效了，又跑到前台重新激活。
整體是一家很適合躺平的酒店，週末去躺兩天挺合適的。有機會會再來的。

酒店住宿部分面積不大：
以下是滿意的地方：酒店香味比較好聞，內斂厚重；每間房包含2位桑拿，游完泳後可以蒸個桑拿，人不多比較乾淨；最滿意的地方是處處的花藝顯出了酒店不俗的審美。

以下是不太滿意的地方：客房面積45平，沒有浴缸，窗户比較窄視野不太好；下午到了之後酒店包含的贈送活動基本都約不上了，可約的基本是付費的；最不滿意的地方是第二天的早餐，水準四星級都很勉強，價格卻是五星標準（小童1.2米多一點加收168）；

總結：親子度不高，同等價格有很多其他更好的選擇；

感謝管家石婧，在住店期間有問必答，不厭其煩。
入住套餐是園景套房的套餐，但是酒店免費升級到湖景套房，一家三口很舒適，套房面積很大，沙發很多，有個類似小客廳的感覺。雖然酒店造了有些年，但是的確如大多數好評中所説，沒有衞生死角，非常乾淨整潔，打掃房間的時候也幫我們把散落的衣服都整理好了。非常感謝。
酒店公共區域隨處有些沙發供住客休息，還有各種意境的植物花卉，各種棋等，不會讓人急着回房間。
桑拿房和按摩池一定要試一下，佈置得很專業，各種用品齊全，泡完之後很舒展，每一項服務都很貼心，細緻。游泳池絕對一流，但是裝備沒帶，沒有嘗試。
遊船服務也很舒服，還給你泡壺茶和小零食，高爾夫的體驗中有15分鐘指導，也不會有過度推銷，明碼標價，非常好！小朋友大人教練都會帶一下，給翁教練好評！富春閣可以自己爬上去，路不累，富春閣頂上的風景很開擴，驚艷！
酒店送的午餐也很不錯，一家三口基本都夠了。住的3天沒有出去吃，都在大痴小館解決，有8折優惠。
唯一的缺點，就是酒店上菜實在有點慢，小朋友難免餓得慌，希望之後能改進。
非常感謝所有酒店的服務人員！希望能保持！有機會還會入住，是很棒的回憶！

植物：上週末非常温暖，酒店隨處可見春來早的痕跡，梅花、迎春花、檫木、臘梅都在花期，打理用心，且酒店內植物四處可見，看着生機勃勃心情舒暢。
動物：住一樓的房間，窗外就有鳥、鵝子和松鼠，嘰嘰喳喳很熱鬧。酒店在室外活動空間還養了幾衹柯爾鴨，做搖櫓船遊湖能看到很多快樂小魚。
食物：兩天都是在酒店內吃的，實名錶揚大痴小館，服務員安靜有素質，點菜會提醒注意份量勿多點，另外豆花魚好吃，杭州美食荒漠，但他家豆花魚值得一嘗。湖廊居似乎更加註意客人的獨處空間，不會過多關注主動服務，但是有求必應，夜對湖酌，sunrise好喝。客房贈送的梅乾菜小酥餅深得朋友喜愛，水果補充也是儘量滿足。此外minibar的飲料還可以豐富點，除了已有的有糖無糖可樂和啤酒蘇打水，例如雙柚汁這類的清爽飲品可以考慮一下。
博物：富春山居當然是有富春山居圖的故事，20分鐘車程可達黃公望隱居地和森林公園，景色好也漲見識。酒店的富春閣觀景很好，霧天層巒遠黛，晴天一碧萬頃，還有祈福抄經活動，懸腕靜心，難得清靜。
總結：感謝酒店與攜程合作推出優質套餐。如此好的入住體驗必然來自於酒店超強的服務意識，三天兩晚沒怎麼出酒店區域也活動滿滿，尤其感謝此行的管家小喬大美女（字體加粗敲黑板強調），入住開始就事事有迴應，件件有着落，因為晚上外賣不方便還自己拿出了晚上的口糧和我分享，令人感動。因此立刻又囤了攜程推的富春山居新套餐。期待下一次山居之旅。

酒店的中餐廳和西餐廳都去體會了一把，中餐廳的選擇更多。石鍋銀鱈魚、葱油雞、山葯炒芹菜，還有甜品藕粉圓子，小點心和牛酥餅，衹可惜自己不是大胃王。
酒店的服務特別好，入住退房都主動幫忙搬行李箱，跟前台漂亮小姐姐互加了微信，主動幫忙預約了富春閣的抄經和酒店深度之旅。梵音雅樂縈繞，靜心摹寫一首蘇軾的蝶戀花，早春暖陽下的愜意。
非常滿意的一次説走就走的度假🥂

還有大門口的門衞小哥也特別認真值得表揚。

msg:綜合：西餐廳驚喜，力薦Spa，房間夠大
酒店有些年代，整體保養算很不錯了，但部分設施還是有些舊了，健身房方面配置也是有些偏簡單。
先説驚艷到的地方是SPA，外籍芳療師指指到位，力道讓稍微輕了些，按完後面幾天真的有身體打通的感覺。

景色：
酒店像個大公園裡麪，有山有水，放鬆休息都不錯，還有很多活動可以參加。

來這邊晚上不知道吃什麼，因為離市中心比較遠外加堵車，就來店裡餐館試試看。
選了西式這家，出品很不錯：
漢堡：雖是基本全熟，但是汁水調味完全沒有問題，作為漢堡愛好者，這個也絕對算是好吃的漢堡。
魷魚圈：性價比高，分量很足，口感也可以的
甜品：造型肯定沒的説，口感方面感覺提拉米蘇咖啡味可以更重一些會更好吃，不容易膩。

環境：餐館還有水邊觀景陽台打卡地，天氣好也可以選擇室外。

看不出是一家營業了20年的酒店，不知是當初建造用料實在還是保養得當。
店員非常和善，對儀容儀錶估計有要求，打掃阿姨也都是淡粧
看過棋魂真人版的應該會對一些景有似曾相識感
酒店自帶的遊玩活動不少，3天2晚不出酒店也夠玩了
泳池有救生員坐鎮，要自備泳帽哦
抄經沒有書法功底的話，一個小時是寫不完的
旅拍免費5張電子檔，超出20元一張
酒店2個餐廳，各有千秋。口味推薦中餐廳，小貴但很好吃，物有所值。喝了個魚頭湯，很鮮很鮮，喝完也不口乾，可見沒用味精調味。
西餐廳口味就普通一點了，但是西餐廳的室外是整個酒店風景最好的地方。還是要吐槽一下138元服務費另收的牛肉麪，看到評論説牛肉麪是師承台灣師傅的，本人去過數次台灣，整個期待值就拉滿了，結果吧別説和永康牛肉麪比了，甚至不如山姆超市
聽説別墅房可以帶寵物，下次準備帶狗一起來

不論是景色，服務都是一流的。特別感謝熱心的前台石婧，還有小洪，以及真誠大氣的當班經理小喬，讓我們擁有一個美好的親子旅行
