msg:Heshun Bailian Hotel: The Ultimate Experience of Oriental Aesthetics

I recently had the honor of staying at Heshun Bailian Hotel, which was an unimaginable travel experience. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was deeply attracted by its unique oriental aesthetic design.

First of all, the hotel is in an excellent location, located to the west of Heshun Ancient Town, allowing me to enjoy the volcanic pastoral scenery and the quiet pastoral ancient town life. Here, I seem to be in a landscape painting, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and find the peace of mind.

The hotel's room design is ingenious, and every detail reveals the unique charm of oriental aesthetics. The private hot spring pool, SPA treatment room and spacious living room made me feel unprecedented comfort and relaxation. Here, I really experienced what "home away from home" is.

The hotel's service is even more first-class. From the front desk to the room service, every employee is smiling, warm and thoughtful. Their professionalism and efficient service made me feel the warmth of home while enjoying a comfortable stay.

In addition, the hotel's supporting facilities are also very complete. Whether it is the swimming pool, tea room or gym, I am very satisfied. Here, I can enjoy the fun of traveling and forget the pressure of work.

In short, Heshun Bailian Hotel is a very distinctive luxury hotel. It has won my high praise for its unique oriental aesthetic design, comfortable accommodation environment and first-class service. If you are looking for a travel destination where you can relax and enjoy tranquility, then I strongly recommend you to experience Heshun Bailian Hotel. I believe that you will fall in love with this charming place like me.

Later, I asked the previous homestay to help send my luggage over. The flaws do not outweigh the merits. The last and most expensive hotel on this trip is worth the money. Low-key luxury, simple a**osphere, and quiet environment. Remind tourists who come to stay that it feels great to go to the outdoor hot spring early in the morning! There was no one, and the water was fresh. I lay quietly in the pools, looked up and saw the banyan leaves reflecting the blue sky, the white magnolia flowers blooming, the sun was warm, and the breeze was blowing. It was great! In addition, the small Mercedes-Benz sent me to the airport, which felt pretty good.

msg:2023 Tengchong New Year's Eve

After landing in the border town, I first chose Heshun Bailian, located to the west of Heshun Ancient Town, which is also one of the most anticipated destinations for this trip.

I have always heard of Bailian's reputation, but its extremely low-key marketing and unspeakable feelings and experiences can only be more real if you experience it in person.

The hotel is located on the west side of the ancient town. There will be a special car to pick up and drop off at the airport, and there will also be a special shuttle bus to and from Heshun Ancient Town. The location of the entire hotel is in the quietest corner of the ancient town, but it is suitable for walking back to the hotel from the ancient town for 15 minutes in the evening facing the sunset. There is a thousand-year-old tree landscape inside the hotel (Figure 1). The ancient trees under the sunset show a very vigorous vitality, and the thousand years of time turn into a circle of annual rings, quiet and peaceful, solemn and mysterious.

The decoration of the hotel is in the new Chinese style, and large pieces of teak build the structural skeleton of the building. The overall style not only does not look old-fashioned, but has a comfortable order. Every blade of grass, every light and every shadow expresses the forbearance and implicitness of modern Chinese aesthetics. Whether it is the twilight in the morning or the setting sun in the afternoon, through the potted pine in front of the door, time seems to be silent, and only a glance can last for ten thousand years.

The hotel's hot spring is also a very big highlight and surprise. Although the room is equipped with a private hot spring, I went to the hotel's outdoor hot spring for two nights. More than a dozen hot spring pools are hidden in different jungles. The shadows of trees, grass, moon, and stars echo each other and complement each other. Looking up is a little star, looking down is steaming mist, time and space are intertwined, and the stars are moving. Tossing around in different pools, one or two hours will pass quickly. With a sip of ice cola brought from the hotel, it has a unique flavor when drinking it in the 40℃ pool.

The service is also nothing to say. The housekeeper has been intimate since the check-in. Even in the peak season of New Year's Eve, the villa room type was upgraded. Miss Aileen introduced the room type and arranged a car to the ancient town. Not only did she give us the experience of making incense and tasting tea, but she also prepared take-away breakfast and souvenirs on the day of check-out. Although the hotel breakfast is not very varied, each one is exquisite, and the rice noodles and rice noodles cooked on site are very good.

The two-day trip was hurried and short, but I will remember that afternoon at the end of 23 years, sitting in the living room of Bailian and gazing at the scenery outside the window, the sun was golden, the vegetation was lush and green, the world was natural, and everything was harmonious.

You can arrange a car to pick you up in and out of the ancient town, which is much more comfortable than staying in the ancient town. The room is a little less soundproof, but the hotel service responded quickly, and changed the room immediately, and gave afternoon tea as a gift. The housekeeper Wen Binbin's service is very considerate. After visiting the ancient town every day, I came back to soak in the hot springs. I stayed for 4 consecutive nights and it was very pleasant. The blind box set meal in the restaurant is also great and tastes very good.

msg:After weighing between Banyan Tree and Bailian, I finally chose Bailian. The main reason is that Bailian is close to Heshun Ancient Town, and it takes 20 minutes to walk to the ancient town. The hotel has vehicles to pick up and drop off guests every day, which is very convenient. Guests can enter and exit the ancient town unlimited times within 7 days. There is a private hot spring pool on the open-air balcony in the guest room. You can also go to the open-air garden to experience hot springs. Bailian's hot spring is one of the four famous hot springs in Tengchong. There are about 10 hot spring pools with various functions and 2 swimming pools. The scenery is beautiful. When we went there, it was off-season and there were not many people. Guests can enjoy it unlimited times.
There are not many varieties of breakfast, but it is very exquisite, especially the staple food rice noodles and rice noodles are very amazing.
I especially recommend the stone pot beef baba in the set meal. The quantity is large and the taste is delicious. The yellow beef is very delicious.
Bailian Hotel is the most satisfactory hotel on this trip.

📍選址位於古鎮的西巷在火山腳下 濕地旁邊 也是田園之側⛰️後山有幾顆百年古樹和保留了最原始的茶馬古道 幽靜無比

🎨極簡新中式設計極致美妙 院落一步一景 光影流動 線條勾勒 還有極致的材質運用，在這入住能感受到時間的沉澱，也似乎感受不到時間的流逝。
	
💁管家式服務有求必應 細緻入微，房間的各項服務設施介紹清晰 温泉私湯和夜床服務也是主動且恰到好處🛀

🎁外出回到房間意外發現有酒店送的木質書簽，定製了我們的姓名 退房時又送上了自己茶園的茶禮 除了滿足了本身對酒店客房服務和設施的期待外，真的還收穫了滿滿的驚喜🥳
	
雖然五一假期價格有上浮，但做出比本身更多的付出，還是很能俘獲我心❤️

酒店完美的地理位置，身處古鎮中又自有一方天地，對於喜歡人文的旅客來説，能充分體驗古鎮居民淳樸的生活氣息，又能住的舒心愜意，對於喜愛大自然的旅客來説，鄰近的一大片農田中隨風搖曳的油菜和麥穗，小橋流水野草大樹間的光影的婆娑，就足夠醉人。

騰沖柏聯酒店前台管家封禮梅的服務真誠，細膩，周到，站在賓客的立場考慮到各種細節，恰到好處的温度，得體有禮的表達，卻沒有官方的拘謹，倒像是深諳待客之道的好主人，非常舒服的體驗。

如果非要雞蛋裏挑刺，可能就是早餐稍稍缺乏新意，如果可以加入一些更具當地特色的食材飲品，或是古鎮人家做的糕餅小點，體驗或許會更加完整。

温泉：温泉泡了二次，第二次可能是客人比較少，浴巾的籃子裏，翻了好幾個也沒有熱的浴巾。休息室，沒人管，小吃沒了也沒有及時補充。

柏聯的餐飲有待提高，不過早餐的稀豆粉非常好吃，比古鎮內的寸大媽稀豆粉好吃多了！

這次全家人入住了雙房別墅：大客廳，雙卧室，雙温泉～完美～  一定再來！

msg:這家酒店接送的司機和服務員真心態度及服務意識很強而且專業，我特別喜歡。接下來我最吐槽的這家酒店噁心的制度，首先在攜程上定不能開這家酒店的發票，攜程和他們管理者協調了一天了就是不行。然後房間温泉開放的時間好有限制，但可以協調，誰這麼好意思天天協調呀。真服了這家酒店的制度完全不考慮用户感受。這一點非常差勁。
