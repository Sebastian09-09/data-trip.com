It was a good choice. 

In the evening construction noise could be heard until 11 at night or later, the staff tried to figure out the problem, but it was someone outside the hotel.


Thank you!

It's a good option if you want to invite your partner to a business meeting. although there are many cafes and small places to eat nearby, there are not many big restaurants. So a buffet in a hotel was a good option. Thanks, Mr.Yang for his help. Beta was also very helpful. Recommend this hotel!

The hotel staff was incredibly friendly and attentive (especially Lola & Jonathan), always willing to assist with any inquiries or requests. The location of the hotel is fantastic, with easy access to the metro station and within close proximity to a variety of shops and restaurants. 

Overall, my experience at the Shenzhen Huaqiang Plaza Hotel was exceptional. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Shenzhen and look forward to returning in the future!

msg:I recently stayed at the Shenzhen Huaqiang Plaza Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. Here’s a breakdown of my stay:

The room was excellent—spacious, clean, and very comfortable. It had all the amenities I needed, making it a great place to relax after a busy day.

The location of the hotel is perfect, especially if you're planning to visit the SEG Electronics Market. It’s just a short walk away, making it extremely convenient for tech enthusiasts and shoppers.

One downside was the breakfast. It was quite poor with limited options available, which was a bit disappointing. I expected a wider variety given the overall quality of the hotel.

On the plus side, access to the metro is incredibly convenient. You can enter the metro from Exit A, located just near the hotel gate. This makes getting around Shenzhen hassle-free.

Additionally, everything you might need is nearby, including shops, restaurants, and other conveniences. This added a lot of value to the stay, making it easy to get anything I needed without having to travel far.

In conclusion, the Shenzhen Huaqiang Plaza Hotel is a great choice for those visiting the SEG Market and looking for a comfortable stay. Just keep in mind that the breakfast might not meet your expectations.

msg:The ambience of the hotel was relaxed and welcoming.   The check in and check out were handled by Dave who was polite and helpful.  The excellent hospitality given by Winnie was remarkable.  She helped us to plan our intended trips with patience and smiles.   When we pointed out that there were some repair issues around our room (3612), she took our points seriously and would follow up.  We have been staying at hundreds of hotels over a lot of cities, Winnie gave us the impression that she was truly serving with her heart.  She is remarkable and a real attraction for us to return to this hotel again.

Also, the buffet breakfast was tasty, ample and full of varieties.  We didn't have time to try the complimentary afternoon tea, but the complimentary noodle/porridge supper was good.  

The 4/5 points concerning "Service" above only reflected the incidence we encountered on the evening before we checked out on the next day.  What happened was that a female staff surnamed as Wu (?) was rather rude when we asked for the possibility of extending our check-out time to 1 pm.  She was black-faced and questioned us "why do you have to ask for late check out ?".    Eventually, even if this staff reluctantly said yes to our request, we chose to check out before 12 noon.   This was the minor hiccup that made me to deduct 1 point from the points.  Otherwise, it could have been a perfect stay for us.

Staff on reception were very helpful and nice. Lobby is on the 23rd floor and the rooms starts from 25 up to 36th floor. Our room was on 28th floor and we had a great view! The take out was delivered by a robot! I liked it))

Breakfast wasn’t included in our room, but we paid extra 80 rmb per person to get a breakfast. Didn’t really like it, in my opinion it is poor for the western taste. The beacon and ham were terrible, nothing like a real western beacon and ham. They didn’t have fresh squeezed juice, only super-sugary “juice” from the machine.

Overall we are very satisfied and would definitely stay in this hotel again!

The room is large and clean, and the facilities are well maintained. The WIFI can even see FB and IG, but the TV cannot see Jiangsu TV for some unknown reason.

I stayed for several nights during the May Day holiday. When I checked in, Xiao Zhu at the front desk provided enthusiastic service and upgraded the room. When I left in a hurry, I left my valuables in the safe. In panic, I called the front desk Beita. After the first round of searching failed, Beita added WeChat, took photos, and went to the scene with the manager to take photos. In a professional and responsible manner, he finally found the lost property. He also considered the customer when arranging the courier, and searched for multiple courier companies in order of urgency and finally arranged it. The whole process was heartwarming and grateful.

msg:The hotel checks in on the 23rd floor. Although you have to transfer to the elevator once to get from the room to the outside, there are 3 elevators in the ba*****t, so you don't have to wait for too long each time, and 2 of them can go directly to the ba*****t store, which is also very convenient for eating. The lobby is beautifully decorated. Going up to the 23rd floor, it looks a bit like a 5-star hotel in Hong Kong. The rooms, beds and bathrooms are also clean, but the sound insulation is a little different. Domestic hotels don't have too high requirements. In short, these 3 days and 2 nights They all had a very satisfying stay!

msg:The hotel is very nice, the room is big, I have stayed in many high-end hotels in Shenzhen, but I didn't feel much warmth, but I feel very warm in this hotel, especially the service and hygiene.
Service: Special thanks to Sister Yaya on the 29th floor. I also paid special attention to her job number 0018. She is very enthusiastic. It took a lot of time to help me connect to WiFi for the first time, because she has a heavy workload every morning. , Frankly speaking, I feel a little guilty for wasting so much of her time. After checking out, due to my carelessness, I left a piece of clothing and a pair of massage oil glasses in the room. Ms. Yaya carefully saved them for me, and she called me and asked to send them to my new room. Residence, I am very impressed. I didn't pay attention to the check-out time when I went out, and finally found that it was a long time after the check-out time. I was very worried at first, but in the end it was Sister Yaya who helped me go to the front desk to explain the reason and helped me solve this big problem. The hotel owner can find such a good employee. I don’t know what to say other than congratulations to the boss. If there are friends who are as lucky as me to choose this hotel and live on the 29th floor, I believe you will love Yaya as much as I do. sister's. Everything I said is true, and there is absolutely no false exaggeration. You will know it once you go to the 29th floor to experience it.

Liu Huiling at the front desk also left a deep impression on me. I remember her job number is 5449. She gave me a lot of help when I checked in. She told me all the details carefully, including the detailed time of breakfast. , because I am a relatively thick person, she also specially wrote it to me with a pen, and finally took the initiative to upgrade the room for me.
Hygiene: The hotel is very clean, not as some people say, some people are always picky, and the service industry has always been hard to say. Anyway, the 29th floor where I live is very, very clean, especially the corridors are very clean. The beds and toilets inside are also very clean, thank you sister Yaya again.

msg:First of all, the location of the hotel is very good. Downstairs is the Huaqiangbei subway station. The surrounding shopping and transportation are very convenient. There is Starbucks on the first floor. The hotel lobby is on the 23rd floor and the rooms are above the 23rd floor with a good view.

What I want to complain about the most is the person who handles the formalities at the front desk. He seems to be indifferent and annoying. What are you trying to say? I was saying that I needed to go through the formalities, and a man suddenly interrupted me. The front desk just ignored me and talked to other people. Is that polite? Have you been trained? They are all guests of the hotel, so they treat each other favorably! Then I was asked to apply at the self-service machine, but I refused to go! Just let her do it for me! The woman at the front desk didn't even raise her head during the entire conversation. She was very talkative! ! ! How busy are you? ? Isn’t going through the formalities the first priority? Besides, I was the only one who needed to handle it at that time! I didn’t even see the concierge staff, who looked like a five-star hotel!

Including breakfast, the quality is so outrageous that it is not the standard that a five-star hotel should have. It is a bit worse than before! Moreover, I don’t know who has dirty hands or something, but the iron spoons and tongs used to pick up vegetables are sticky, and no one has wiped them. The hygiene is worrying!

I'm really sorry for the service at this price during the holidays!

In the evening, the hotel also provides free supper, which is suitable for those of us who work overtime every day. The air conditioner is very powerful.

The breakfast in the hotel is self-service , The brothers and sisters at the front desk all greeted each other warmly, and they all served with great care.
I drove to Shenzhen and found a place randomly. At first I thought it was an express hotel, but the service was very good. There was a small problem with the room. We didn’t have any complaints. We just wanted to let you know, but the hotel attached great importance to it, and it dealt with it quickly and gave a lot of compensation Very thoughtful, compared to our previous five-star hotel in Hainan, it is simply heaven and earth, and the details will be shown in the vlog later. There is also a very considerate move. The staff even helped to cover the ground where the car was parked. None of the many five-star hotels I stayed in Hainan for more than a month has done this! The positive reviews are overwhelming. After a closer look, it turned out to be a five-star hotel. Decisively continue to live for one day. Although the facilities may not be up to par, the quality of the staff has definitely reached the five-star level.

Originally, I was upgraded to a deluxe room, because I wanted a room with a bathtub, and it was immediately arranged for me replace. The deluxe room and the superior room have their own characteristics. The deluxe room is elegantly furnished and the room type is upright. The superior room that was replaced later has a wide view and sufficient lighting, which is very good. The free supper from 9:00 to 11:00 is rare in other hotels. There are noodles and porridge, which are nutritious and easy to digest; drinks and fruits are also provided at the front desk; the breakfast buffet charge is also very affordable. Staying at Huaqiang Plaza Hotel this time was a pleasant experience. I will recommend it to friends and consider staying again. I hope your hotel will do better and better.

Not to mention the hardware facilities of the hotel, the view of the city is invincible, and the most heart-warming thing is the soft service. From the moment you enter the store, there is a feeling of coming home. Although the hotel lobby is not on the first floor, but on the 23rd floor, this does not affect the feeling of being at home. Welcome drink, orderly check-in guide, introduction of hotel functions and various benefits, etc. In particular, Yang Ye, the front office manager, has become a good housekeeper for the residents by using his proficient business skills and enthusiasm.

The service attitude of Xiao Zhou at the front desk is still very good and he dealt with the problem quickly. When friends come to visit, they will also call to inquire. You need to swipe your room card to enter the elevator. It feels very safe to travel alone. *After ordering takeaway, a robot will deliver it upstairs to reduce personnel contact👍 I arrived at the hotel a little late, and I was a little hypoglycemic when I went out. While waiting in the lobby, Xiao Zhou poured me a glass of passion fruit honey. Drink well🍃Environment: *The room is on the 31st floor, the corridor is very spacious, and there is a hanging garden, it is super convenient to wash clothes (I forgot to bring a hair rope when I went out to eat, and it is provided in the lobby) *When you enter the room, you first have to watch a movie There is a piece of light music, the experience is great and very comfortable; *I specifically want a room with a bathtub, and the bathtub comes with a disposable bathtub cover, which is very considerate* I have always been more concerned about the hotel's toiletries, the design of the large bottle is not only environmentally friendly And it is very friendly to girls, *There is an extra roll of toilet paper towels in the alcove on the toilet, which is very considerate! *The shower spouts hot water very quickly! Like it👍 *Because the hotel faces Huaqiang North, the night view is beautiful at night, and the hotel is very considerate. 🧹Hygiene: The hygienic environment is still very good, the floor has no desktop, no dust and hair

convenient location
reasonable price
High quality service
first-class scenery
room size

Things to improve:
The elevator is too slow and inconvenient
Room decoration is old
HD stations cannot be displayed in full screen
The temperature of the shower water is difficult to adjust, sometimes hot and sometimes cold

Especially praised the waitress surnamed Luo at the front desk. Very friendly, responsive, sincere, cordial and proactive. Light of tourism!

Because I came to Shenzhen from another place, I didn’t know that there was a typhoon in Shenzhen, so I didn’t bring an umbrella. Luo Simin gave me her own umbrella. Thank you very much.

The water flow of the shower is very large, and the water comes out quickly, so there is no need to wait for hot water. The service is also very good. The lobby manager Ms. Yang is very caring. She helped deliver fruit and snacks when I checked in, and added WeChat. She took care of me warmly during my stay. This is the best experience I have ever lived in Shenzhen. One of the good hotels, the service is worth the price.

There were a lot of suspected blood stains on the carpet, which looked a little uncomfortable. When I defecate normally without using too many tissues, it gets clogged easily. The TV responds very slowly, like a TV from more than 10 years ago.

The staff helped bring the food, opened the door to get the takeaway, and didn't say a word until I left. Even when I said "thank you," the staff didn't respond.

All in all, the experience this time was not very good.

msg:I ordered it after reading good reviews. The result was very disappointing. There was a *** male employee at the check-in desk. I wanted to choose a room with a good view. I asked about it. He sounded a little impatient and said that our rooms were all OK. It just happened. There was a foreigner who was also checking in. He asked the person next to him to check in for me and went to serve the foreigner himself. What kind of service is this for the hotel leader? ? ? ? This person should be a supervisor, right? Is he so awesome? Do foreigners have priority in this hotel? ? If it only serves foreigners, please don't accept Chinese people. It feels like it discriminates against Chinese guests and gives priority to foreign tourists. It especially disrespects me. There is also hotel WIFI, extremely slow network speed, and in-room The WIFl signal is unstable, I can't work, and I need to log in again frequently. The breakfast is very poor and not worth the price. In addition to the hotel having a higher floor, the hygiene is OK. The rest is really... more than 800... I will definitely not stay here again. Please think carefully and don't be deceived by reviews.

The room environment is very elegant and the view is particularly good. The hotel robot is also very fast in delivering food. There is also a sky garden on the 31st floor, which is very worth checking in. There is also a self-service laundry room that is also very convenient for washing and drying. The gym on the 36th floor is really good news for those who like to do body building! All in all, there are surprises everywhere! I will stay again next time I come to Shenzhen!

msg:It was an extremely unpleasant stay for me. I placed an order on Ctrip, but I chose a twin room by mistake and paid on delivery. When I checked in at the hotel, I found that I had booked a twin room. I negotiated with the front desk to make up the difference and change to a double room. The front desk found a bunch of so-called reasons. What can’t be changed? There is no double room. If you want to change it, you have to change it. The difference is 300. The order itself is 639 twin rooms, +300, more than 900 per night. There are many more high-end hotels in Shenzhen. Why choose your hotel? It is nothing more than because it is May 20th, you think the big bed room is more popular, and you want to save it for others. Later, I checked online and found that there are still many double-bed rooms, and the price is lower. I contacted Ctrip and asked it to help with the coordination. The hotel still evaded it for various reasons, that is, an extra 300 yuan was required to change the double bed. According to the price on the Internet, I can accept a supplement of 100 yuan, but I cannot accept it if you must supplement 300. Later, I became popular, so I said to send me a piece of fruit, and then it was still +300, give me a luxurious double bed room, and added conditions, asking me to give a good review. Who is disgusting?
This hotel has since been blacklisted.
In addition, I would like to add that the hotel's breakfast is really ordinary, with very few varieties, and I am completely sorry for this price class. All feedback here is based on facts, please be cautious when choosing this hotel.
Going to the price of 600 to 700 yuan a night, I believe there are n many better hotels to choose from in Shenzhen.

The only drawback: the room is a bit old. The washbasin in the first room leaked badly and the toilet exhaust fan was broken. It was much better after changing to another room, but there was still some leakage on the floor.
Although having robots deliver food is a plus, it takes a long time for robots to deliver food during meal times. I hope the hotel can add more robots.

Also focus on the service employee number: 428 Xiaoyu. Very welcoming, with a good attitude, and the room was very clean. Makes people feel warm.

Overall, the hotel is very cost-effective and I would choose it again.

After comparing a few houses, my little sister and I were still the same in the end. I chose this Huaqiang Plaza Hotel, which is located in the Huaqiangbei electronic business district. The location is really good. Line 2 and Line 7 are in front of the hotel. The front desk of the hotel is on the 23rd floor, and the staff greeted us warmly as soon as we entered the elevator. We arrived earlier. Xiao Zhu received us at the front desk. When we checked in, we told the lady, could you arrange a higher floor for us? Ask carefully if we are here to play in Shenzhen? We told the truth, and then the young lady helped us choose a room close to Huaqiangbei very neatly. When we entered the room, the view was good and it was very clean. She also told us that there is a free supper in the evening to get the room card. You can enjoy it. I asked Miss Sister if she had a slightly harder pillow, she recommended me their hotel’s buckwheat pillow, and asked me if I had any allergens before, and if I was allergic to buckwheat husks, I said no, before leaving. I also reminded us that the temperature in Shenzhen is cooling these days. The big temperature difference between morning and afternoon makes us pay attention to keeping warm. Sometimes the relationship between people is really wonderful. The hotel I stayed in is not too small. It is the first time that I have been treated so sincerely. , Or it may be because of my peers, this time I feel great! Wish your hotel business is prosperous!

We went to Shenzhen for 2 days and had a good time, mainly because my parents wanted to come to Shenzhen. Looking at the places I’ve been to before, I thought it would be more convenient to stay in the city center. After choosing for a long time, I finally decided to live in Huaqiangbei. After booking, I called the front desk, thinking about letting me know in advance, because I took my parents with me. With the children, I want the lady at the front desk to help arrange the room; the one who answered the phone was Jing Jing. After learning about my travel situation, he helped me apply for a free upgrade to the deluxe twin room for the manager, added my WeChat, and took a special shot. Send me the photos, let me rest assured, thank you very much. The front desk of the hotel has a very good view on the 23rd floor. The staff will help with luggage as soon as you leave the hotel. There is also handmade lemon tea made by the hotel. It tastes very good and takes care of it very carefully. , Thoughtful, and chatting, we are here to play, Miss Yang, the lobby manager, immediately introduced us to many attractions and food, because she also listed some points that I want to go, Miss Yang helped us to plan very clearly, saving us For a long time, we also have more time to go to more places. It’s very milky. First: The location of the hotel is great. Metro Line 2 and Line 7 are very close to the hotel downstairs, whether it’s simple travel or Tourist attractions are very convenient, and many of Shenzhen’s scenic spots are on this line; second: the hot summer arrives in Shenzhen very quickly, the current temperature is almost 35-6 degrees every day, but the room is quietly given in advance I arranged the room to turn on the air-conditioning in advance, so entering the room is very cool, not sultry, and there is a bowl of noodles and a bowl of porridge late at night. It is really a free service for 24 hours. I have stayed in so many hotels. Suppers are presented to customers once and for all, it feels like home, and it is definitely hard. The beef that day was spicy beef. The beef was large and the ingredients were sufficient. It was really good! The staff are very polite! Very enthusiastic. 99.9 points. After leaving the store, I quietly sent me a WeChat greeting to see if I have arrived at the next stop and always care about us. Our family is very satisfied with the arrangement this time. I sincerely thank all the staff of Huaqiang Hotel. Your service is very sincere. Good, and hope to get better and better, the hotel business is booming!

A waiter also helped to provide mobile drying racks in this special thanks.
Some problems were also found in the room during the period, such as the room exhaust fan did not turn. Then there is the impact of playing electric drills on the side of the construction all night, which will affect the sleepless night. There are also guests who smoke in their rooms, which causes the smell of smoke in the room to be heavy and cannot be eliminated. Compared with other luxury hotel rooms lack an air purifier. Unfortunately, I hope the hotel can configure it.

There is a very intimate introduction to the free nucleic acid inspection downstairs, which saves you from going back for temporary inspection. Check out the left notebook and send it to you for the first time. Thank you very much. Will come to this next time. Thanks a lot.

酒店衛生可以，床品毛巾乾淨，地板和浴室有點痕跡，對得起這個價格了。
今次第一次入住，連住3晚，可能是旺季，大堂職員忙著吧，評論裡其他住客提到的酒店職員主動聯絡關心需要；或態度親切等等，我都感覺不到。
跟我以往入住的萬麗或香格里拉等酒店服務對比，這裡服務是有少許落差。

msg:酒店位置很方便  我們是從香港開車過來的  酒店地庫裏 在酒店附近華強北購物用餐都很方便 酒店還贈送了下午茶和夜宵 性價比非常高 

由於我們在華強北購物的時間不夠 前台的Beta很耐心解答我們續住的問題
Beta是一位優秀的員工  能為客人帶來酒店的好印象 

不好的經驗是  我們離開酒店時  到酒店前台查詢開車離去的程序
有兩位女員工對我們説  沒有什麼程序你們開車直接離開就可以了
於是我們開車到了深南路啲出口  被卡著了延誤半個多小時
我們再致電去前台時  那位女員工説  我們在閘口找個物業開閘就可以了
可是當時下著雷暴雨  找不到任何協助 估計是人為/系統上出現失誤 ...

1、打印機沒有及時更換硒鼓～
2、外籍員工無論是酒店福利還是什麼，都不應該穿工服與客人同時在餐廳用餐以及飲用給客人的服務區飲品。不知道是衹有外籍還是其他高管也可。
3、不知道是否是南北方文化差異，服務好不等於收空盤及時，盤子裏的東西還沒吃完就要給我收走，在旁邊等着我吃完收盤子，這個體驗屬實非常不舒服。
4、會有不是住客，蹭住客的電梯上樓，上電梯後，不按樓層，還跟你一同下電梯，很嚇人，華強北的人很亂，建議在一層設定一個保安，確保每一個上客房樓層的都是客人。

服務：Check in 時那位服務員，應該是任燕紅，可能我唔識普通話，覺得佢有點cool ，有點不快，但加咗wechat ，第二日朝早有主動問候，有需要問嘅問題回覆亦好快，check out 時那位服務員亦好nice，呢項都可以比滿分
衛生程度： 枕頭有污漬，沖涼時去水比較慢，呢度要減啲分
設施：無乜點用，但總體觀感唔錯，比滿分亦可。
初初睇到一啲差評都有啲擔心，但住咗兩晚感覺幾好，雪櫃飲品免費，服務亦好，下次北上會考慮再住。

msg:房間挺大的，衞生也是不錯的，我們入住大概有一個星期那麼多了，真的是在酒店住的很舒服才願意寫點評的，畢競作為入住了那麼多酒店，我是一個很少去點評的人，這家酒店是真的做的很不錯，想着寫一下分享給大家！入住酒店的第一感覺就很讓我很印象深刻了！當時我是和我媽媽一起過來辦理入住的，我們兩個人拿的行李還是很多的，但是前台小姐姐都很熱情，不僅辦理入住手續快，而且還幫我們叫來保安大哥用行李車幫忙把行李送到了房間，，特別感謝！ 再總結一下其他方面！雖不多，但重在楊小姐的那份心意！説真的服務這方面酒店做的很不錯！第一是有問必答，到前台詢問附近最近可做核酸點能否做續住衞生或幫忙打印幾張文件等，工作人員都沒有任何不耐煩的表現，都是很熱情幫忙解決問題。第二是處理問題迅速，一開始預訂的是大床房，後面需要換成雙床房，前台小姐姐也是迅速滿足我的需求，速度幫忙換房間，因為我們的行李很多，換房的時候楊小姐幫助我們一起搬行李！而且還是提供了地下的免費停車場。這點我覺得對於開車人士來説太重要了 ，房間酒店配備的齊全，下次來深圳還可以選擇入住，從設備到服務真的是一應俱全，很滿意。超值了呀，而且酒店房間也很好，晚上睡覺很安靜，拍照的時候放下歌很有氛圍感了，這次相聚不辜負我帶了兩個相機瘋狂拍照呀，住的很開心！！！體驗感蠻不錯的。推薦一下！

樓層高街道噪音很小。
空調有些老了噪音比較大晚上睡覺衹能關了睡。
落地窗能看到華強北全景，很壯觀。

除了空調噪聲大這一問題之外就完美了！

msg:住酒店一定要舒服整潔沒有異味，房間寬敞，完全沒有異味，床上用品乾淨，枕頭床墊非常舒適。酒店位置很好。處於亞洲電子第一市場的華強北主街道，樓下便是地鐵站。服務人員禮貌，大堂經理Kitty主動加了微信，表示有任何需要都可以聯繫她，得知第一次入住還送了早餐，給做了延遲退房點贊，（當然不是因為這些才給好評，是入住體驗真的不錯），房間裏準備的水和飲料都是免費的，水不夠還可以加，比一般的星級酒店講究。酒店還有自助洗衣機和烘乾機，深圳的夏天，出去轉一圈衣服就全濕透，有洗衣機烘乾機真的非常方便。小姑娘熱情，服務周到，總之個人體驗很不錯，希望繼續保持，持續進步，以後會繼續關注，持續選擇，君不負我，我定不負君

每次過來深圳我都會入住的酒店。這次服務員的態度非常好，對比上一次來的好太多了，熱情禮貌！尤其是叫小玉的阿姨，非常感謝她的熱情為我們解決了很多問題。

入住首日提供免費minibar:以前會有啤酒，現在換成檸檬茶
免費店內核酸:每天下午3點半在前台那裡有的做，但樓下也有核酸做，都很方便！

msg:非常感謝酒店楊小姐的熱情服務，在大堂很忙的情況下，給我們送了礦泉水，見我們拿行李比較多，主動幫忙送上房間，還加了微信，有什麼需要直接聯繫很快就能幫忙處理，酒店的員工都很不錯，衞生乾淨，大堂寬敞，酒店下午還有免費的上門做核酸，就在大堂，不用出去排隊，很好，值得推薦給很多需要住店的人。
