msg:The Shangri-La, Tianjin, is, and has always been our favorite Hotel to visit.

This week was a special celebration for us, as we celebrated our 15th Wedding anniversary, as well as our 4th consecutive year in China.

We relocated to another City / Province, about two years ago, and was unable to visit and enjoy our special Shangri-La.

Prior to us moving from Tianjin, we used to celebrate all our special occasions and milestones, at this branch of Shangri-La.

We would always spend our Christmas, New Years, and Chinese New Year's at Shangri-La.

Now that we have returned to Heibei, we look forward to continuing this tradition.

Things change over time, some familiar faces are no longer working there.

However, the new team made us feel right at home again, and went out of their way to make our stay most memorable and special.

As I mentioned to one of the team members, it's not the spectacular Lobby Lounge, nor the beautifully decorated features, that make the establishment, but rather the people.

Without quality staff and superior service, no establishment can ever rely on reoccurring business.

For as long as these values are in place, this Shangri-La can be certain of our patronage.

All team members provided excellent service, from the bellhop, to the waitresses, from the front of house to the housekeeping and of course the management team.

Special thanks to "Francis", the new General Manager, "Danny", the Food and Beverage Director, as well as "Billy", the "Food and Beverage" Manager.

This trio of Management, ensured that we received the best service possible.

Lastly, we would like to thank "Roger" whom assisted us with a Driver / Transportation, upon our early departure.

No visit to Tianjin, would ever truly be complete, with visiting The Shangri-La.

See you soon.

I stayed here for a night after a late flight into Tianjin Binhai Airport and I would highly recommend this place for a convenient location, delicious breakfast, clean room and nice amenities. Only 20-25 minutes from the airport and less than 5 minutes to Tianjin Train Station via car, I was able to catch my train even though I was running late. I would come back here if I ever need to stay the night in Tianjin.

The breakfast is fabulous, the gym is well equipped and the pool is just great.  As a foreigner living in China for some time now, it is so refreshing to be responded to in Mandarin when that is the language I am using.  It is also so nice to enjoy my breakfast without someone insisting I eat it with a fork. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.  The service is fantastic without being cloying .  Every aspect of check in, check out and meal service is professional and efficient.  Have I run out of superlatives?  We have all paid much more and received far less than what this hotel offers.

There are Kerry Plaza and Jinhui Bridge nearby, which are very convenient for shopping and traveling. The rooms and hotel facilities are well maintained, especially the Haihe River view in the room should be one of the best in Tianjin.
The staff are very friendly, including Ms. Ruby at the front desk who introduced various services very carefully, the lounge staff answered questions and cleaned seats in a timely manner, and the aunt and uncle of the room service were very polite and enthusiastic in the elevator and when delivering items, etc., thank you!
Overall, it was a perfect stay with no shortcomings. It would be better if the restaurant and lounge breakfast could be richer and dishes could be added in time when it was about to end but not yet ended.

Yun Coffee Buffet Dinner: Nice environment, good service, rich dishes, and good quality. Maybe there will be more choices if you go to Kerry Plaza next door.

It is very pleasant.

msg:It was my first time to travel to Tianjin, and I chose to stay at Shangri-La. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I was warmly received by Summer Ma, who helped me with my luggage and took me to the front desk to check in. When she learned that I was traveling to Tianjin with my children, Summer also specially helped me develop a travel guide. After checking in, she personally sent me to the room and introduced the room facilities to me, which made me feel very warm when I first came to Tianjin. Ruby at the front desk was also very enthusiastic, which made my trip to Tianjin very happy and satisfied. Thumbs up for you 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

From check-in to afternoon tea and happy hour in the executive lounge, and finally check-out, the hotel staff showed very professional qualities and made people feel at home. Before check-in, I mentioned that it was the "meeting anniversary" with my lover that day. The hotel decorated the room and sent fruit plates and chocolates, which was very considerate; the time in the executive lounge may be the most "crowded" time I have ever encountered. There may be three or four customers with "urgent needs" around a staff member at the same time, but each staff member is not impatient and responds to requests, which reflects a high level of professionalism; when I checked out, the lady at the front desk asked about the check-in experience in detail and sent a set of washing and care kits, which was a perfect ending.
Hygiene, environment, facilities: Five-star hotel, you get what you pay for, hygiene, environment, and facilities are definitely worth the price. In addition, the scenery outside the executive lounge window is great, and there are different experiences during the day and at night. It is recommended to stay in the executive lounge more.

The hotel is in an excellent location, close to the Haihe River, and has a beautiful view. This time I stayed on the 29th floor, overlooking the Haihe River, and the beautiful scenery. The stars are shining brightly at night, and the view is unobstructed. The room is spacious and bright, elegantly decorated, and well-equipped, giving people a feeling of being at home; special What should be mentioned is the swimming and leisure area, which makes adults and children linger; the rich food choices, whether it is the buffet breakfast or the happy hour in the executive lounge, greatly satisfy the taste buds.

This time we were traveling with two elderly people and children. Shangri-La Hotel provided us with very warm and thoughtful arrangements. The front desk service was attentive and considerate. We would also like to thank Manager Du for his care and help!

Highly recommend this place, it is the most reliable choice for business and family vacations! Our whole family was very satisfied with this stay experience and we look forward to coming back next time!

The location was good, and the river view room also saw the Haihe River as I wished. There was ample parking space, the breakfast was rich and delicious, and the bedding was very comfortable. The facilities are a bit old, and the charging socket is not obvious. It took me a long time to find a charging socket for mobile phones. The one beside the bed is far away, the socket is loose, the charging head cannot stay, and there are facilities on only one side; the socket for the writing desk is also very small. loose. The tiramisu cake in the lobby bar felt like it had been left out a bit too long, and the skin was dry and hard.

The hotel's breakfast seemed to be average, and the pancakes and fruits were not as delicious as expected. The freshly squeezed juices seem to only have watermelon juice, etc., but no orange juice.
The above are just minor flaws of the hotel and will not prevent tourists from staying here:
First, the hotel is in a very good location, very close to Dawangzhuang Station of Metro Line 9, just across Jialihui.
Second, the hotel services are basically in place, and there are quite a few guests staying there, at least much more than the nearby Lishunde Hotel.
Third, the hotel's hardware facilities are quite new and neat. At least there are several more elevators than in ordinary luxury hotels.

Second, the quality of toiletries is average, especially shampoo, which has average oil control effect

msg:I have stayed in hotels such as Ritz-Carlton and Lishunde before, and I have a basic understanding of the hardware and services of Tianjin's first-tier hotels. It was my first time staying at Shangri-La, and I was actually looking forward to it. Parking the car and walking into the majestic atrium, the right fragrance, and the festive a**osphere all met the expectations. However, the reception language and expression of the little girl who checked in at the front desk seemed to say that we are not lacking in Shangri-La. The professional indifference on the guest's face really caught people off guard. When I returned to the room, I had to reflect for a moment and convinced myself that apart from the check-in procedure, I didn't mention any additional needs. Maybe this is Shangri-La's style. In addition, I am quite satisfied with the comfort, convenience and newness of the hotel's bedding, bathroom and electrical facilities. Especially the view from the Haihe Wing can instantly beat the window view from Lishunde. The breakfast is rich in variety, the tableware is clean, the dishes are fresh, served in a timely manner and taste good. I have to mention that the male manager who was responsible for diverting traffic in the restaurant during the Spring Festival peak period was patient, professional and responsible, and changed my view on hotel software services in one fell swoop. Another tip: the river view hotel is divided into north and south wings. It is best to confirm with the front desk in advance the location of the room you need. Otherwise, if you need to change rooms after checking in, the front desk may reply that they are not very specific...

Compared with other five-star hotels, the water bar is a bit stingy because it requires extra consumption. The purified water provided is all in small bottles, which is not enough to drink and is not environmentally friendly.

After reading the reviews for a long time, I chose Shangri-La just to see the fireworks on both sides of the Haihe River. I was not disappointed! The location is very good. It’s only 20 minutes away from Tianjin Station. After I’m full, I leave the hotel and walk along the river. I don’t even need to turn on the navigation. I follow the Haihe River and look at the sign of Shangri-la and come back. It’s around 9 o’clock. The fireworks never stopped after that, making people in areas where fireworks were completely prohibited fall in love with them!
The hotel service is also very good and the breakfast is rich.
The only flaw is that the window of the room is on the 29th floor. I don’t know if it’s because it’s too high or it’s windy? There was a slapping sound every now and then, but I was only staying for one night, so I didn't ask the front desk.
Overall, it’s a good review!

The shopping mall is right at the door, which is convenient and the lobby is bright and spacious. In the end, the invoicing machine broke down and after waiting for a while, the waiter chased me out and gave me a bottle of red wine. Not to say how valuable it is, but to express my feelings. I will choose this place again when I come to Tianjin. Tianjin has so much delicious food, but it’s also too cold in winter.

msg:The hotel is located under an overpass and at the intersection of Haihe River. The surroundings are a bit deserted. Moreover, you have to twist and turn to get to the lobby entrance, so the sense of grandeur in front of the lobby of a five-star hotel is visually lost. However, it is not far from the core attractions in the city, so it is most convenient to travel by bicycle. The bathroom in the room is very large and has a bathtub. The biggest problem with the room is that the curtains are one layer of gauze and have no light-blocking effect. Not friendly to young people who like to sleep in. The biggest highlight of the hotel is the service in the breakfast area. The staff will be very enthusiastic to help deliver drinks to your seat. The worst thing is that the room type order shows that river view rooms from floors 8 to 27 are available. But after arriving at the hotel, I wanted a room with a view and a higher floor. I was told that there were only rooms on the 8th and 5th floors. If I added more than 100, I could upgrade to a river view room on the 14th floor. The view and room type were exactly the same as those on the 8th floor. As a well-known five-star hotel with an old brand, it does look a bit ugly.

The TV equipment does not have a screen projection function, so I hope it can keep up with the times. The location is very good, only three to five minutes by taxi from Tianjin Station. However, I made a note of the high-rise hotel and was given a view from the 8th floor. The view from the room was average. I could see the fireworks on New Year's Day, but the view was still a bit unsatisfactory.

Tianjin Shangri-La Hotel gave our family of four a wonderful New Year's Eve experience. Needless to say, the view from the hotel is good. The food in the buffet restaurant is pretty good. The swimming pool is open for a long time. It takes 20 minutes to walk from the hotel to Tianhe City for shopping. The children like it very much.

msg:The guest room is awkward to live in, the facilities are a bit old, the lights are a little dim, and the hygiene is average. It feels like a makeshift room. The quality of the dental appliances needs to be improved. For a room price of more than 1,000, you should not choose a product of this quality. The spherical sculpture on the cabinet opposite the big bed has a concave and convex surface, which makes it look like someone’s head is looking at you at night🥲 Move it away decisively.

Although there are many breakfast varieties, the eatability is not good and there are too many. The bread area does not reflect the level and quality that an international five-star restaurant should have. Goubuli’s steamed bun sign in the restaurant... Even if you choose a better quality semi-finished product, otherwise it will make foreign tourists question the time-honored brand😅

I bought a Napoleon at the lobby bar. The pastry on the bottom of the dessert was already moist, and it didn't look like it was made that day. The rest of the dessert was also dry on the surface.

Check-in is not terrible, but it’s almost 🤣
There is a difference between Shangri-La and other cities
Finding problems is not about complaining
But I hope the above opinions will change next time I stay😊

It's a decent hotel. The advantages of this Shangri-La hotel in Tianjin include: (1) The geographical location is excellent, close to Tianjin Station and Haihe River, with good scenery and convenient transportation; (2) The hotel is very new, the lobby is very large, there are ample parking spaces in the underground garage, and it is very close to the elevator entrance ; (3) There is a shopping mall next to it, where you can shop, watch movies, and eat, which is very suitable for relaxing; (4) The minibar is stuffed slowly, very sincerely! ! ! , I must like it here. Many small refrigerators in hotels are just fake. I was really shocked by the fact that they are like this! ! ! If we have to talk about the shortcomings, we can also find some: (1) The craftsmanship of the Chinese restaurant can only be said to be average, not like a five-star level; (2) The breakfast is rich in variety, but not very exquisite, just so-so.

The photos are all taken outside the windows of hotel rooms and executive lounges.

Shangri-La is an old five-star hotel with a very good environment. The room attendant's attitude is also very good. The waiter on the 12th floor, Master Du, is very enthusiastic. Breakfast is still good as always.

It is very pleasant to walk along the Haihe River at night. However, there were too many guests staying that night, and we had to wait in line for breakfast the next day. The breakfast was rich, but because there were too many people, the experience was not very good. Two breakfast chefs were joking around at the cold plate area. One of them, wearing a chef's uniform, actually put his hand directly into the fruit mushrooms. After selecting them, he helped himself to the mushrooms with his hands. I was watching from the sidelines! He didn't even mind the guests. The management of the breakfast depar**ent really needs to be strengthened!

msg:I stayed in a hotel with a name in Tianjin almost once, but Shangri-La actually slipped through the net. When I come to Tianjin this time, I have to spoil everything.

Let me talk about the location first, it is very close to the subway station, and there are shopping malls, cinemas and so on next to it. Rooms with river views can see the Haihe River, and the floors are fairly high, up to about 30 floors.

The overall hardware condition is not bad, the bed is comfortable, and you can also ask for buckwheat pillows or something. There are shower and bath, L'Occitane full of toiletries.

By the way, the swimming pool is really great. It is said to be infinity, but in fact, you can only see the outside view through the glass, but the bathroom and sauna are all complete. The gym space is not small either.

There is a dedicated breakfast area on the executive floor, but the cafeteria on the first floor will definitely be richer. In addition to common Chinese and Western meals, drinks, desserts, and fruits, there are also some Tianjin specialties such as pancakes and old tofu.

Talking about the service, a female manager surnamed Cao left a very deep impression when I checked in, thank you very much. In addition, when I checked in, I encountered some small episodes. After the feedback, Manager Du He followed up and dealt with the whole process, and did his best. Thank you.

Although there were small episodes, fortunately there were no adverse effects. When problems occur, the professionalism of the hotel is really tested. I hope that the hotel will optimize management in the future and bring more and more guests a safe and comfortable experience.

It's large, the water quality is clean, the water temperature is right, the opening hours are long, and one of the windows faces the Haihe River, which has a great view. The service staff you encounter in the lobby will smile and say hello, and will offer help when they see luggage. As an old five-star hotel, the breakfast is quite satisfactory, but the Tianjin pancakes are really good!

Electric curtains are being installed upstairs, but you can hear clearly downstairs. Because it is a corner room, if the wind is strong, there will be noise. When I woke up in the morning and it was raining, I was woken up by the sound of the rain!
The room I booked includes 2 breakfasts, but I am staying alone, and my friends come to have breakfast together. When I swipe my card, I will be asked to register! I have stayed in so many hotels, this is it! Old hotel, old rules!
The bathtub is also very dirty! and curly hair
The gym is not bad, and the uncle who cleans is very hardworking and serious. To be honest, among all the service staff, the cleaning uncle and aunt are the most polite and smiling. .

All of the above are okay. It's acceptable, after all, Tianjin is a little worse than some good provincial capital cities. The most important thing is the service. In addition to the service of Shang Palace Chinese Restaurant, this hotel is also good. Other services can be given negative points. I drove here, and the electric trunk was turned down manually. The doorman tried his best to open it manually. Did you just start the job without training? The breakfast items have been gone for half an hour and they still can't be put out in time.
I have stayed at at least 10 Shangri-Las across the country. Tianjin is the worst! Thank you, I will definitely not go there again

If you order takeout at a hotel, you have to come down and pick it up yourself, but the robot is not available to guests?
The hygiene is so-so and the bedding is very poor. There is construction around, so many taxi drivers can't find it.

Service: The service attitude is very good, friendly and enthusiastic, and can solve various problems. But when I checked out, the front desk staff of the Horizon Club was not familiar with the business, and did not refund the deposit under the guidance of the supervisor next to me. A few days later, I called the front desk and told me that I was negligent and did not refund the deposit when I checked out. He operated within seconds Check it out and make a critique! In addition, I hope that after the garage elevator reaches the lobby, there will be staff to guide you to the Horizon Club to check in. There are many people at the front desk, but you can't find the staff after searching around. Finally, you can find the waiter at the gate to guide you upstairs.

The bathroom is large, the layout is reasonable, and the ventilation is good. Children have special skincare needs and room service is always on hand to help. I just had high expectations for the executive lounge. Unfortunately, the waiters in the lounge on the first day seemed unhappy, and the food was not very tasty, but considering that it is provided for free, it is acceptable. Finally, the check-out on May 1st can be delayed until 1:00, thank you very much. At noon the next day, there was a clown show. Before leaving, the lobby manager gave the child a cute little rabbit. The robots are also cute. The swimming pool is 1.2 meters deep, and the water temperature is not bad. Swimming equipment is sold, and you can also run errands. Although it is not a parent-child hotel, it is really suitable to book an executive room for parents who do not want to run away with their children. In short, the price-performance ratio is online, and the children are willing to come again.

msg:It was the first time I stayed in a Shangri-La brand hotel. Under the enthusiastic recommendation of the lady at the front desk surnamed Yao, I changed it to a Horizon Club room. I can dine in the restaurant on the 32nd floor, with afternoon tea and light meals in the evening. The experience is very good. I am also very satisfied with the restaurant on the 32nd floor. The beautiful staff lady presented a bottle of red wine produced under the brand as a gift. The service attitude, scenery and food are all five-point praise.

When checking in, the front desk always recommended paying the price difference to upgrade to a better room! I’m really speechless. It’s such an injustice to spend more than a thousand dollars!

Anyway, the traffic is very convenient. If you book an executive floor, you can go to the executive lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner. I feel that the breakfast in the executive lounge is better than the restaurant on the first floor. The toiletries are all from L'Occitane, and the services are also very good. The night view of Tianjin is more beautiful than that of Beijing. It was a very pleasant stay.

msg:I didn’t travel far during the Chinese New Year, so I chose a hotel in a nearby city to stay for two days, shopping and eating. Seeing that Shangri-La’s price-performance ratio and location are good, I stayed for two nights on the last day of the statutory holiday. The advantage is the location and environment. Facing the Haihe River, there is the newly opened Kerry Shopping Center next to it, close to the subway exit of Line 9, one stop to Tianjin Station, and not too far to Joy City and Hang Lung Plaza. Check-in was a bit slow, there was a queue for breakfast on the first day, and it was understandable during holidays. The facilities in the room are a little old. There is a bad contact in the socket of the writing desk. I hope it can be repaired in time. The bathroom has a good separation of dry and wet, and there are two basins for easy washing. Parking is very convenient, you can enter and exit freely after providing the car number when you check in.

msg:I often go to Tianjin to play, and I have also stayed in Banyan Tree, Dongli Lake, and some five-star hotels in Binhai New Area. I wanted to take advantage of the last two days of Chinese New Year to try Shangri-La, an old hotel, and specially ordered an afternoon tea set. To be honest, a little disappointed. The hotel facilities are relatively old, and the sanitation is acceptable. When the front desk checked in, it was told that the upgraded executive room would have a better view of the Haihe River, and you could drink, so I paid more than 300 yuan to upgrade the executive room. After checking in, I found that the size of the room is smaller than that of ordinary rooms, far less than the standard of 48 square meters. The windows are not big, and the sound insulation is not good. The only advantage is that the floor is a little higher. In addition, the drinks in the mini bar can be drunk for free, as a gift A plate of welcome fruit. The standard of light meals and afternoon tea in the executive lounge is not satisfactory, not as good as the afternoon tea in the lobby coffee bar. When you check in, the attitude of the waitresses at the front desk of the lobby and the front desk of the executive lounge is average. However, the two male managers in the hotel's executive lounge and the buffet breakfast on the first floor are very impressive, very polite and thoughtful, we will come to ask you what you need and praise you from time to time during the meal. We can choose to have breakfast in the executive lounge on the first floor or on the 32nd floor, but the light meals and drinks in the executive lounge the night before were really lackluster, so we chose the buffet breakfast on the first floor to try it out early the next morning. The breakfast is quite surprising. There are a lot of varieties, including Chinese and Western food, especially a kind of hot and sour noodle soup called thin noodles, which is very appetizing. My husband also ate pancakes and fruits, but the Goubuli steamed stuffed buns are just so-so. , It feels like the taste of quick-frozen buns heated. Overall, it's nothing but good. The four-point praise is for the male managers and the breakfast on the first floor.

msg:I have stayed at Shangri-La Hotel many times, and I have always had a special liking for Shangri-La. This time I stayed at Shangri-La Tianjin, which is generally not bad. I am especially satisfied with the cleanliness and service of the room. There are a few things I would like to improve: 1. The temperature in the room is very high and it cannot With the windows open and the central air conditioner turned off, it is very hot. Turning the temperature to the lowest setting (16 degrees) and the maximum ventilation is still very hot, and there is no way to adjust it to a comfortable room temperature. 2. The breakfast is quite rich, basically everything you need is available, but the addition of orange juice, fruits, salad vegetables, etc. is not timely. Happens occasionally. 3. The reception at the front desk is not very bad, but it is lukewarm. I don’t know whether it is for the guests who only booked on the third-party platform or all of them. I saw a lot of bad reviews about the front desk in the reviews of Ctrip guests). None of the above mentioned is a major event but a small one, but I still hope that Shangri-La will get better and better.

This time, it is the blessing of the gods to be invited to live here👏 happy

love their gym
You can overlook the entire Haihe River while running
Especially when we run from afternoon to evening
The afterglow of the sunset sprinkles golden light on the river
It is not surprising that such a beautiful scenery can run 5 smoothly [Naughty]

It's a vintage hotel after all
Old but comfortable
Not as fancy as new designer hotels
But the sense of belonging of the space is the most suitable for me👏

msg:Allow me to press Amway Shangri-La again.
My husband and I's favorite hotel brand. Five-star brand hotels, except for the Four Seasons, have basically experienced the rest. There are not 100 large and medium-sized cities at home and abroad, but dozens of them. Shangri-La's quality is one of a kind, impeccable.

Room Facilities:
Shangri-La's room is not the largest among the five-star hotels, but it is definitely the warmest, and it feels like home when entering. From bedding, home appliance curtains, to bathroom washing, tea bar and minibar, the details are really in place.

Value for money:
In a five-star hotel, the price/performance ratio is very high. Compared with some first-tier high-end brand hotels in the group, it is really a civilian price.

breakfast:
The Shangri-La breakfast in each city will arrange local specialty snacks. As a Tianjin native, I ate Shangri-La Tianjin specialty snacks. I know that the special snacks and breakfasts in other cities are very authentic.

wifi:
Seek truth from facts, this is general.

bed:
It's worth mentioning that the firmness of the bed really suits me. I don't like too soft beds.

parking:
convenient.

Room View:
As shown.

Serve:
This must be praised. Of all the big-name hotels I've stayed in, including the Ritz-Carlton, only Shangri-La calls before check-in to ask about accommodation preferences and needs, and then calls the next day after check-out to ask questions and comments about the accommodation. For this serious attitude, it is worth five points. Besides the service of the waiters, from the concierge room at the front desk to the gymnasium of the Horizon Club restaurant, all the waiters serve customers in the principle of meeting all reasonable requirements of customers. However, the bad thing about this check-in experience is that the little brother who spread pancakes and fruits in the restaurant in the morning, I don't know if I didn't have a good dream yesterday or I got up. The attitude is blunt and the tone is not good, which is offensive.

This time I booked the Horizon Club River View Room, which has a capsule machine and a free minibar. There are also flowers, fruit wine and chocolate. Including afternoon tea and happy hour at the Horizon Club on the 32nd floor. Needless to say, basically three meals a day can be solved in the hotel. During the epidemic, it's nice to come and relax occasionally.

Secondly, there is a big difference in scenery. It is good to see the scenery of Haihe River in the west of the hotel. The scenery of Haihe River in the east arranged by the hotel has no characteristic buildings and the scenery is average. I don’t know if the room is not enough or what. Breakfast and afternoon tea were not amazing. Finally, the room is relatively small, not big.

The attitude of the front desk is very good, and there is no ignoring that others say. The infinity pool of the hotel swimming pool is really good. There is a shopping mall next to it. It is convenient to eat, shop and take a taxi. There is no big supermarket, and there is no place to buy some fruit nearby. The common problem of hotels in the north is that the room is full of ups and downs, and the table is on the first floor. Shangri-La is like this, and Sheraton and Hilton are also like this. It's really far from Shangri-La in Qingdao.

So I opened the door and called the waiter who was cleaning another room, let her see what it was, and told her that my child found it under the bed. The room attendant also said sorry, hey! Garbage Shangri-La! Dinner was eaten at Yun Cafe on the first floor. There were not many people on Friday nights, so there was very little food at the dining table. Pizzas and desserts supported the facade. Let it cool down again. The taste of Buddha Jumping over the Wall is very good, but there are no ingredients in it. I only eat mushrooms, but the service is good. The restaurant waiter will take the initiative to ask the Shangri-La membership number to help points, and the concierge will take the initiative to ask if you go out.

msg:Because of the inability to leave Tianjin during the May 1st holiday, I chose this hotel with the old man. There are ample parking spaces and free parking for hotel guests. There are staff in the elevator room of the underground parking lot to check the double code and measure the temperature. In particular, I would like to mention the young man on duty around 7:00 p.m. on April 30. When a guest enters or exits the elevator, he will take the initiative to get up and say hello, and maintain his standing position to watch the guest enter the elevator or parking lot. The little girl who was in charge of checking the code at the entrance of the hotel lobby at about 8:00 p.m. on the 29th was also very good, and offered to help the guests lift heavy objects. When I checked out around 11:00 a.m. on May 1st, the lady at the front desk also took the initiative to inquire about the accommodation experience. When I learned that the guests were not satisfied with the TV in the room and the episode during the breakfast, I immediately recorded it and presented it as a gift. I gave a gift to express my apology, so to speak, all the way online. Hope the hotel can encourage the above-mentioned staff.
Of course, the overall staff's service awareness needs to be improved. In most cases, the staff you meet in the hotel will not take the initiative to say hello. This may also be a difference between North and South regions.
There is no problem with the room view, and the night view is really great; I personally think that there is nothing wrong with the facilities in the house except for the TV. The bathroom is large enough, the hand basin and the shower toilet are separated, which saves the family's washing time; the breakfast is quite satisfactory, in short, there should be There are all kinds, none of them are particularly unpalatable, and of course there are also some that are particularly amazing. A word worth the price.
Although there were some flaws during my stay, I am willing to give a five-star review because of the three staff mentioned above.
Finally, I still hope to have a dedicated smoking floor. After all, I have to choose to stand downstairs and smoke every time. . .

How can I say that Shangri-La gave me a special a**osphere. The Haihe River view is super beautiful, the hardware and software breakfast and Shang Palace are very good, the service is super! In particular, she named Zhao Wen, Miss Daisy at the front desk, she was beautiful and gentle, and she even gave her a baby gift, which was very caring. In the days when I can't go out of Tianjin, I will often come here

msg:This year’s Chris**as🎄Choose Shangri-La
Didn’t disappoint 🥰
Originally I ordered a set meal for 1150
Includes two breakfasts in a double room with river view and afternoon tea for two with a bottle of red wine🍷
Check in at 15:00
The hotel staff said that if you add 385, you will get a free executive floor room.
Plus dinner for two in the Horizon Club
I added it because I thought it was a good deal😌😌
Executive floors are rooms above the 28th floor
The cleansing products are from L’Occitane😊
There is a capsule coffee machine in the room with three coffee capsules
5 servings of branded tea bags, several instant bags
Soft drinks include 2 cans of Watsons soda, 1 can each of Coke and Sprite
1 bottle of Evian mineral water, 1 bottle of Perrier, 2 boxes of snacks
We received complimentary fruits during check-in🍉They are all delicious
Not to mention the scenery. Located on the Haihe River, it is a beautiful scenery in the morning and evening.
The dinner at the Horizon Club on the 32nd floor of the executive floor is average. It’s okay to be full.
But we still ordered takeout at around 12 o’clock 😂 (pancake fruit and cold skin)
There are many cocktails to try
The breakfast at Yun Coffee on the first floor is very rich
We'll go downstairs for dinner at nine o'clock
The meals are ample and there are many freshly made breakfasts that are also delicious
Fruit is especially delicious 😋
Executive rooms can help you delay check-out until 4 o'clock at the latest
We checked out at three o'clock and went to the lounge on the first floor for afternoon tea.
There is live piano performance
There are two cups of coffee for afternoon tea. If the food cannot be eaten by two people, they can still take it away.
The lady at the front desk gave me a box of chocolates 🍫
Very happy this Chris**as 🎄
It’s my first time to come to Shangri-La and I feel very comfortable and warm🤗
Register as a member and bring your family together next time😋🎊🎊
I think my review is pretty good. Please give me some encouragement.
A little ❤️❤️

In recent years, the hotel industry has a great mobility, but I feel familiar with Shangri-La. The service staff, especially the Horizon Club service staff, remembered my name before showing their identity, which surprised me. After all, it has been a long time since my stay was during the New Year’s Day because the room service was very busy. It's the duty manager (Xiao Qiu) who personally delivered the welcome fruit upstairs. When we checked in, the room service staff was very enthusiastic to show us the night view of the empty room opposite. Let me express my appreciation for the Tianjin hotel industry. What makes a hotel is not only the hardware, but also the people and the service. Thank you for your kindness during this stay. The lady of the Horizon Club gave it They didn't accept the tip either, just thought it was what they should do. Special thanks to the following; Serena (Horizon Club Manager), Daisy, Emma, Ruby, Sophia, Vien, Amy. Xiao Qiu, Max, and those service staff who were not specifically mentioned to give silently. I hope you are happy at work and can provide good services to other people in Tianjin and win glory for our greater Tianjin.

I learned that it was a family trip, and the hotel arranged a room overlooking the Haihe River. After checking in, I can really feel the service of the luxury hotel, especially Emma from the Horizon Club Lounge. The service is very considerate. Knowing that it is a family trip, she also gave the child a box of chocolates. In addition, you can overlook the beautiful Haihe River from the 32nd floor. The hotel service is great.

Since he couldn't make a reservation for afternoon tea on Chris**as Day, he even called his colleagues at the tea restaurant to arrange takeout. He also gave us Chris**as chocolates (made on the same day and they were delicious). The service was considerate. Before checking in, the hotel service staff specifically asked if we had any special needs, and specially arranged a location with a good view for us, which was really nice!
Regarding hygiene: Choosing Shangri-La Picture means cleanliness and peace of mind. Checking in did not disappoint me.
Regarding the environment: My best friend absolutely loves the decoration of the room, especially the bathroom. She wants to take off the mirror, hahaha. There are small stools in the shower room, which made me think it was a sauna, and the non-slip floor is also excellent.
Small suggestion: It would be great if there was a takeout robot, so that the takeout would not be delivered by mistake, 😁

msg:Since the epidemic, I cannot travel far. I have stayed in Tianjin Shangri-La for many times, where I can eat, shop, and exercise. In comparison with five-star hotels in Tianjin, I personally think that the price/performance ratio is very high. This time I still booked the river view twin room, the 48 square meters room is not cramped at all. At first I booked for two nights, and then renewed it for another night. Outside the window is the river view. The winter in the north is relatively cold, and it is good after the lights are turned on at night. In summer, there are green trees and the scenery is better. Like the rain water, it's very big and awesome. The sanitation of the room is good, and the single bed is also very large. It is too comfortable for people to live in for a tall person. The mattress is soft and thick enough to satisfy. The electric curtains in this hotel have a 100% shading effect. It is very practical for people who are worried about the light penetration in the morning. Many hotels have electric curtains, but the corners and corners will still see light in the morning. I care more about breakfast, so I took pictures of what I like. Cantonese-style shrimp dumplings and fried noodles are delicious. The smoked salmon is not fishy at all, and the taste is soft and waxy. The soup noodles are also good, better than the fans. There are also many choices of baked buns for breakfast. Fruits and juices are refrigerated at a low temperature and eat less in winter. It is very convenient to live in Shangri-La for dinner. Even if you are not dining in the hotel, you will arrive at Kerry Place by walking a few steps downstairs. There are many restaurants to choose from. Hotel parking is convenient, every time you come to the ground parking lot in front of the hotel.

The overall environment of the hotel is good, and the decoration style is still relatively old-fashioned but quite mild. I booked the deluxe river view king room, located in room 3109, the scenery is still good, the feeling is slightly different during the day and night, the room's shower 🚿 and shower water The volume is very large, the temperature is stable, and it is quite comfortable. The disadvantage is that the toilet🚽 is too old. It would be good to replace it with a smart toilet, so that the price can be increased. Another problem is that the socket on the side of the makeup mirror🪞 There is a problem. The self-contained hair dryer has no power after being plugged in for a few seconds. It cannot be used.
The closet space in the room is enough, and the shoehorn and iron are also complete, which is basically good. Overall still recommend this hotel.

Needless to say, the location of the hotel is close to the Haihe River, next to the Kerry Shopping Center, shopping and eating is stress-free, and Dawangzhuang subway station is only a few tens of meters walk downstairs, and public transportation is also convenient.
As shown in Figure 2⃣️, the free drinks of five-star hotels are ordinary ice dew, which is the standard of small three-star hotel chains. I really don’t deserve the five-star standard!
As shown in Figure 3⃣️, in the room we live in, there is a thick layer of soil on the bedside table on one side. Our health situation is really worrying!
A few more words, there is no light in the closet, it is dark, it is more painful to take the clothes, and there is no trash can in the bathroom, and the waste is always thrown directly in the toilet. It always feels not good...
In short, there is nothing wrong with staying, but the sanitary condition of the hotel really needs attention‼ ️

msg:The location is great, adjacent to the Haihe River. The floor-to-ceiling windows of the room offer sweeping views of the river and city. The night view of the lights at night is even more intoxicating. Looking at the beautiful scenery, the meal feels even more delicious!

The room hygiene is also very good. The service is relatively good. I personally feel that the inadequacy is that the food delivery is not particularly thoughtful. I often order food in the middle of the night, but the hotel does not have a food delivery robot or a delivery service. Every time I need to wear my pajamas and go downstairs to get it. I feel particularly troublesome. It would be great if we could improve in this area.

msg:This is the second stay, and overall it is ok. It is the complimentary afternoon tea: there were four or five tables in the lobby. The waiter also asked for an appoin**ent, saying that there was no snack, and we were going to check out the next morning, which was so insincere. I left the store for three days after checking out, and the credit card refund information has not been received, which is much slower than Shangri-La hotels in other cities.

I drove a pickup truck (Ford F150), and asked me to stop underground for a while, then let me stop here, and stop there for a while, and said that I was afraid that something would fall from the hotel and give me the car. It's smashed, and the attitude of the security guards is so mediocre, which is very annoying. The breakfast service in the hotel is not very good. The service of fried eggs is not very good at Shangri-La. The hotel can park Mercedes, BMW, Audi, pickup trucks. I just wanted to ask, how much more expensive are they than me? Or am I not a guest of the hotel?

msg:As a member of Shangri-La Hotel, I say that this is the worst hotel experience I have ever stayed in a five-star hotel! none of them! According to the staff in the hotel, the SPA center of Shangri-La Hotel Tianjin is outsourced to a third-party company, so can the service attitude be very poor? ! The lobby made an appoin**ent for me to have a massage at 10:30 in the evening, but there was only one masseuse, and the service attitude was extremely bad. I just asked for a one-hour Chinese massage to be allocated to the shoulders, neck and head, and no other excessive requirements. , The masseuse said that he could do it when he asked me to sign the price confirmation form, but after I signed the price confirmation form, he began to refuse the massage many times on the grounds that the company did not train him. He threatened to say that he could not do it, and the attitude was very bad ! I express very incomprehensible! Then why bother me? From 10:30 to 12:00 in the evening, the hotel manager on duty kept communicating with the staff of the SPA center. The masseuse still did not apologize for his service attitude and refused to do the project. The manager on duty expressed his helplessness about this! And called the manager of the SPA center, the manager actually said that the 60-minute program does not include the head, but only the 90-minute program, so I said that it would be adjusted to 90 minutes, but the SPA center staff still had a bad attitude. , refused to massage, did not listen to the persuasion of the hotel manager on duty, and could not give a reasonable explanation, I am also full of doubts? Isn't this the spa in the Shangri-La Hotel? Are their prices free to change? The content of the project is also arbitrarily determined? 10% service fee ➕ 6% tax is to provide such a service? Why does the hotel manager have no power over this employee? Can it be so invisible? Wouldn't it take hours for this trivial matter to be resolved? After two days of complaints to Shangri-La Hotel headquarters and Ctrip.com, the staff of Shangri-La Hotel Tianjin responded and apologized accordingly, but still did not give a reason why, as employees of a five-star hotel, they have no sense of service. Willful and reckless, it can be seen how flattering their hotel management is?

The ladies and sisters in this lounge were very nice, very polite, and the service attitude was very good. , It deserves to be praised all the time, compared with Changchun Shangri-La, it is simply incomparable, the gap is huge, it is unforgettable, hahahaha, like this, I will continue to live next time! By the way, all the mini bars in Shangri-La It's free, I like it very much, much better than Marriott and Hyatt, haha!

msg:I have been living in Tangla Yaxiu before in Tianjin. This time I chose Shangri-La, both in terms of service and accommodation. The administrative corridor on the 32nd floor is much more comfortable than Tangla's. It is quieter, has a good view, and snacks and drinks are also very delicious. I have been eating Chinese food at Tang Palace during my stay. The portion is moderate. I love tomato and wild vegetable soup. Some other Sichuan-style dishes are sweeter. I don’t like this one. If you communicate with the waiter in advance next time, you should be able to adjust it. To your own taste. After a meal, take a walk along the Haihe River across the road, comfortable!
Overall, 5 stars praise, next time I will continue to choose Shangri-La, and finally I would like to thank the staff for the chocolate gift box presented during checkout😁

Although the facilities are not the best in China and the room area is not the largest, but every detail and service are great, from the corridor to the room is very beautiful, everywhere is full of Chinese elements, the room view Very good, can clearly see Haihe. The toiletries are from L’Occitane, the moisturizer is very useful, and the room service is very considerate. After I drank a bottle of books, I came back and found that I gave two more bottles. In the evening, I will help you to lay out the mats and put small cards on them. Sense of ritual. Afternoon tea is very good, the manager of the breakfast room is also very enthusiastic, the pool will play music underwater, bath towels and mineral water will be quickly replenished, the service and details of this software are beyond the Sanya Ritz Carl who just lived last month pause. The tofu in the hotel’s breakfast room is super delicious, and the variety of dishes is super rich. Behind the hotel is Kerry Hall. The Chen Shazi restaurant inside is very good. I will choose here next time I come to Tianjin!

msg:The overall stay is good. The room is arranged on the 31st floor, and the Horizon Pavilion is upstairs, which is more convenient. The hotel has a nice view and faces the Haihe River. There are subways and supermarkets around, and one subway station away from Tianjin Station. The breakfast in the hotel’s executive lounge is not as rich as downstairs, but the dining environment is good, which is actually enough, recommended! The dining environment on the first floor is rather chaotic, the dishes are scattered, the placement is unreasonable, there are many people who catch up with the holiday, and the experience is poor. Afternoon tea and happy hour are also good, that is, the executive lounge drinks and drinks by yourself. It is recommended to arrange a bartender. In addition, the service needs to be improved. It is not careful enough. The reception staff in the lobby on the first floor did not take the initiative to ask about the room type, so we did not Enjoy the convenience of fast processing. But the service of the Horizon Club has nothing to say. Cao Shuang and Ms. Shan Bingjie are very considerate. It rained on the day of returning to the city and helped us with late check-out. A little brother who was in the same class with them that day was also very nice, but he didn't know his name, and thanked him for his warm service. Shangri-La Hotel is still very recommended, but Tianjin is a little smaller, and the others are very good. The room service lady is also very good, and is responsive.

3.最失望的是加床，提前一個多星期預訂，專門打電話讓提前安排好。套房的樓層安排的比較低也就算了，加的床很單薄，床面上的彈簧一條一條的露着，孩子睡在上面硌着難受，一晚上從加床上到沙發上換來換去沒睡着。第二天一早，反饋給前台，一直沒人過來關注解決問題，於是取消了連住。

2、退房的時候男前台服務人員問住的怎麼樣？我們如實説很一般，因為窗户正對工地，週日早上4、5點開始幹活叮叮咣咣兩歲寶寶睡得很不好。結果男服務人員説：下次訂單可以備註。可是辦理入住的時候人家説房早都訂滿了，週末施工怪我們自找的咯？就這態度跟房價真的很不符合！！！
3、早餐説實話，連我家兩歲寶寶都不愛吃。薯餅咬不動，鴨血粉絲沒有鴨血，粉絲以為是鋼絲兒…我們一家三口用半個小時就結束戰鬥起身走人了。

msg:服務四分是送給行政走廊2024年第一天早上服務的短髮女員工
早飯穿了酒店拖鞋進門，不讓進，説不允許穿拖鞋進去，説地上滑，誰家毛不短的地毯會滑？關鍵我每頓飯都拖鞋來每次來人都不多的，從來沒人提醒我，態度比較硬比較粗，非要我去換鞋，否則不讓進去，後來我讓她把規定拿過來給我看，一直不拿來，也不來説一聲，等我去問才説就放在門口，搬不動，很不誠懇，而且沒有服務意識，大廳裏穿拖鞋的比比皆是，就這算不上高端的行政走廊，就不讓穿了？出門看了剛搬出來的牌子，是温馨提示，也並不是必須遵守條款。這位員工的軟服務意識需要加強，達令説我穿太差了也助長了他們氣焰。
行政走廊的飯菜很簡陋和敷衍，當然也不貴就是了，要不是周邊有點偏沒有可飯的地方，外賣也要一小時以上，我也不太願意去吃

msg:整體入住感受很好 就是辦入住的效率希望可以更高些啦 稍稍有些慢 不過也有可能是因為過年大家還沒有返工的原因 

環境：酒店環境真的無可挑剔 大堂很寬敞明亮 從酒店門出來走個幾步就是商場 超級方便 距離市裡也不遠 衹需要過一個橋 停車位也充足🅿️ 房間內景色也是超級棒 不論是清晨、黃昏還是夜晚 望向窗外心情就會很不錯 
酒店三層設有無邊泳池 泳池不很大 可以滿足日常健身需求 如果人少的時候去 拍拍照片也是可以的 

衞生：房間內整潔舒適 設施簡單美觀 就是窗户玻璃需要好好清潔一下啦 

總體來説 還是很推薦大家來香格里拉酒店！

msg:因為小朋友喜歡親子房的古埃及主題，所以訂了香格里拉。直觀感受大堂前台辦理入住退房很方便，值班經理會注意不讓客人久等，服務很好。
房間就是酒店標間加一點親子主題元素。衞生間空間很大，要誇，但是衹有一個垃圾桶，不太方便。也沒有房間宣傳片裏的古埃及主題小童浴袍，嫌麻煩就沒有找客房要，不知道有沒有。小童設施部分，古埃及主題的繪本很不錯。其他沒有明顯缺點或亮點。
週末自助早餐人很多，尤其週日。菜品種類從大類上來講還算豐富，具體每個品類下面種類不多，比如火腿奶酪品種很少，大部分菜品口味也衹能算一般。另外可能是用餐人數太多，雞蛋檔位週六有自選品種，廚師可以現做，週日就沒得選了，衹有煎蛋供應。
地理位置不錯，在海河東邊，酒店旁邊就有橋過河，右轉就是非常美麗的解放北路，走到底就是津灣廣場、解放橋和天津站。左轉就是利順德、卡爾頓，再走遠一點就是五大道。去城裡其他景點地鐵公交都方便，打車也便宜。酒店後面是一個商場，吃飯很方便。

首先入住辦理體驗就很差。週六下午2點到的。被告知客人很多房間沒有打掃乾淨。 等到當天下午6點才順利入住？！ 真無語。晚上才能入住第二天中午12點前就要退房。
其次，停車場收費 入住客人可以免費，但前台不告知。
最後，停車及其麻煩。車位真的很緊張！地上、地下停車場基本沒有位子都要轉小半小時才能有機會夾縫塞進去。為了防止回來沒有車位。 開車住的酒店… 卻衹能打車出去玩 。
很糟糕的體驗。下次不會再來這裏。

msg:優點：
河景房景色不錯（但是對面的建築施工對觀賞景色有一定的影響）
雙人洗手池（但是一個人入住這個設計有一點雞肋）

缺點：
1.地下停車場設計有問題，要轉大概720°，道兒還非常窄，路面不平有坑，非常容易造成事故
2.check in 速度太慢
3.前台説相鄰的客房還沒有收拾好，先給我們一間房間，等另一間收拾好了把房卡給我們送上來，可是等了2～3個小時，她給的房卡根本不是相鄰的，一個1521，一個1515，互相送個東西都得走，很不方便
4.電視特別小，還不在正對床的位置，屋裡的設施也都不太新了
5.最最可氣的一點：打電話問有沒有洗澡用的塑料拖鞋，服務員説要去健身房問一下，問完告訴我沒有乾淨的了，我就納悶了有時間問不能清潔一下嗎？而且拖鞋都沒有備用的嗎？
6.接上一點，因為沒有拖鞋衹能光腳洗澡，地很涼還有點滑，防滑墊很小
7.床墊和枕頭很不舒服，睡完了落枕
8.玻璃不乾淨，想照外面的景色會受一點影響
9.垃圾桶都沒有套垃圾袋，不知道每次清理房間難道要洗垃圾桶嗎？
10.自助早餐非常次，7:20去的，東西都不熱了，而且也沒有擺好菜品標識，他們6:30開餐我去的時候還沒準備好呢還在擺放標識上菜（煎餅果子特鹹，餛飩的餡兒就一點，服務態度很差，我問是什麼餡兒的，他説馬上馬上就好，結果做出來的也不是給我的）
11.接上一點，餐廳設計也有問題，地面灑水了很滑也沒人管
12.整個酒店的服務意識很差，沒有讓人感覺到舒適

以上可能都是小問題，但是對於一個老牌五星酒店真的太不應該了，尤其是服務態度處處有問題，讓人覺得不舒服。

先説32層行政酒廊的免費下午茶，説是免費，其實羊毛出在羊身上，費用也是涵蓋在房費裏面了，衹有幾款飲料和甜品，沒有一個鹹味食品，哪怕有個三明治或者茶雞蛋也好啊，讓糖尿病人情何以堪？

自助餐廳晚上五點開餐，我們六點去吃晚飯，雖然裏面有很多空位，但是説被社會用餐人員都提前預訂了，並沒有給入住客人有餐位的安排，讓我們留下電話，等有空位打電話通知，説我們前面還有四桌等位，結果一直沒接到通知電話，幸虧我們明智的去32層吃了簡易晚餐，否則豈不是一直餓着？

最後再説説洗澡沒有熱水的情況。12點看完中央台的跨年晚會，準備洗澡睡覺，結果沒有熱水！！！説是因為入住客人太多，導致熱水供應不上，這是一個五星酒店的服務嗎？還不如快捷酒店呢！

因為家門口的疫情原本計劃回家過春節也不得不取消，滿心沮喪！幸好有天津香格里拉！早就聽説這個酒店是天津最值得，沒想到更驚喜！按網紅點評選了這個海河邊的香格里拉，為的是豪華閣景色！結果，賓至如歸，温馨順意！Emma小姐姐更是熱心幫忙選擇了特棒的房間，Sophia更是熱心的推薦了香宮，飯菜果然不錯，謝謝兩位姑娘啦！謝謝香格里拉團隊，培養了這麼優秀的員工！

這次住的房間正對海河，好像應該是叫什麼什麼全景房的景觀比較好 直接可以看到津灣廣場
硬件設施也完全沒問題 就是人比較多 感覺酒店比較火 經常承接宴會活動什麼的 
酒店對面就是嘉裏滙商場 超級方便 傍晚過馬路去海河邊散散步也很愜意
停車場住客免費 登記車號自由出入
總之 我很滿意

這次挑選這家也是因為第一次住下來還可以，但這次給我的感受是，第一房間不太好，正好是對着對面施工，河景衹有斜對角看到一丟丟，第二交通一般，這家酒店離商場很近下面就是地鐵，但關鍵是無法直通，下雨天還要打着傘走過去。
設施也比較老舊，總體就這樣吧，國慶期間真的性價比不高。
