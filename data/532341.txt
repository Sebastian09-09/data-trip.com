msg:I stayed 4 nights. Overall the place and the service were good. But I was disappointed by the fact that the outdoor swimming pool was EMPTY (= no water in it!) for the whole duration of my stay. One big reason I had originally chosen Narada was the outdoor swimming pool, which looked great from the hotel's... pictures; too bad it was very different when I got there. My idea of a relaxed mini-holiday is to enjoy the outdoor swimming pool; however, if there is no water in it, what is there to enjoy? :(  

Given the obvious discrepancy between what the Hotel claimed to offer (= pictures of a beautiful outdoor swimming pool) and the reality ( = empty swimming pool) I asked the Hotel to offer me a discount; they instead offer me apologies and wanted to give me a small gift I didn't need (and didn't take); however, they did not offer any discounts. Therefore, unfortunately, I have to give a low rate for my experience there because overall was a disappointment.

After I told her that I liked a quiet room and hoped that the lake view would be better, the front desk lady took the initiative to upgrade the original superior lake view room to the central lake view room on the 6th floor. The view from the balcony was excellent! The hotel's breakfast was also very rich and tasted great! Whether in terms of environment, hygiene, catering, or service, it deserves 5 stars! In Qiandao Lake, where 5 stars are gathered, the cost performance is really high! I will stay at Junlan again when I come to Qiandao Lake next time!

There were six people in total, including two 85+ elderly people and a ten-month-old baby. Xinnv was very considerate to give me and the baby a large room, and also took care of the elderly's inconvenience in driving a car to pick them up. The hotel bedding was quite clean. I brought the baby's mat and quilt for fear of unsanitary conditions, but it was inevitable that she would crawl around on the bed, and she had no allergies. When the weather was good, the scenery was quite good, and it was also unique on cloudy days, which was in line with the phrase "the sky is blue and waiting for the rain". Finally, let me talk about the hotel's restaurant. Compared with the surrounding restaurants, the price is a little expensive, but it is acceptable. The small portion of fish head soup was not enough for five people to finish, and it tasted very delicious.

The room is large. Although it is a bit old, it is well maintained. The room matches the picture.
The only drawback is that the default cleaning is to change towels. If you stay for more days, you need to find a waiter to specifically request a thorough cleaning.
The service is particularly impressive. When you enter the door and walk on the road, all the staff greet you warmly, and there is a special person to consult about the boat ride to the island. The extension of stay, afternoon tea, and membership application are all handled by the female manager Song Xin at the front desk. The service is proactive and enthusiastic, making this vacation very worry-free and smooth.
Reservations usually come with breakfast. The buffet restaurant on the 3rd floor can see the core landscape of the central lake area, which is the same as the central lake view room.

The room of Junlan is large and has a dressing table. The only drawback is that the air conditioning in the room is not strong. The room is still hot when the cold air conditioning is turned on.

msg:The two of us drove to Qiandao Lake. We originally wanted to stay at the Millennium Resort Hotel. After checking online, we found that this hotel was the closest hotel to the boat dock on the central island, so we decided to stay there. I booked this lake view room. After driving to the Zhijia Hotel, the first thing the doorman did was skillfully and enthusiastically direct the parking and help us get our luggage. When we came to the clean and bright lobby, the two ladies at the reception desk were also very enthusiastic to check us in. When Ms. Yu Rong learned that we were traveling by car, she suggested that we upgrade to an executive lake view room. She said that such a room has a better view. If we are tired, we can look at the scenery in the room and rest, which will make us feel more comfortable. So we upgraded to an executive lake view room.
        After checking into the hotel, I felt that although the room was not very big, it was very warmly decorated. The bathroom has a washbasin, a bathtub, a shower, an automatic toilet and other equipment. The view of the lake from the room is very beautiful. When we came here it was a cloudy day and we opened the door. The view on the balcony was as beautiful as an ink painting.
       Their breakfast is also very good and has a wide variety. A fruit plate is delivered to the room every day. Soft drinks and food in the ice bar can be replenished at any time after use and are free to use. Two free afternoon teas are also provided from 2:00 to 4:00 every afternoon. When guests come in and out for fun, a battery sightseeing car will pick them up and back to the hotel gate. When I came back from an evening trip, there were two hot portions of Tremella Fungus and Red Date Soup.
       In short, staying in this hotel is very warm and feels like home. Just this service, this environment and catering, etc. Check-in standard is 630 yuan per day. It is the most cost-effective hotel I have ever visited by car. I also hope that the restaurant will continue to maintain its status. I will recommend my friends to stay in this hotel when they come to Qiandao Lake.

msg:As a resort hotel, it is really good. What touched me most was that the front desk receptionist Song Xinnv was very professional. She was really attentive and patient to customers and was very enthusiastic about her work. Not only did she upgrade our room, but she also properly arranged and handled all kinds of matters when we went to the front desk to consult. She had a very good attitude and no sense of distance. We were originally here to relax and have a vacation. The environment of the hotel and the service attitude of Song Xinnv at the front desk made us decide to stay for another day. It was also good to soak in the hotel. The room was spacious and clean, and the transportation location was also very good. It was very close to the pier and the fish street. You can see the lake in the room, and the breakfast was also great. If you go early, you can go outside to see the lake while eating. There are many varieties. The most important thing is that it is clean and tidy. All the staff are very polite and the training is very in place. Although the hotel has been open for a long time, the facilities are well maintained, without any shabby, and the landscaping is trimmed very timely. I am very satisfied with all the details. The first choice for vacation, I will continue to stay with my family next time! If you bring children, you can also feed squirrels, and there are many small animals raised by the hotel. There are also children's handicraft activities by the lake, which are full of details.

      What impressed me in my final choice was that the hotel is located on an independent hillside around an island, is large, quiet, and has a view of the lake. However, I was also concerned that the hotel opened in 2013 would be old?
     After arriving at Qiandao Lake station, go straight to the last stop of Line 1 and go directly to the hotel. It takes about 40 minutes. There is a bus every hour, latest at 5:10 pm.
    When we arrived at the hotel, we were very surprised. The tall and spacious lobby is not inferior to that of a 5-star hotel. The staff are very patient and enthusiastic. Considering that we are a family of two children and four, the lobby manager Yu Rong even took the initiative to upgrade us to a double bed. house

msg:One of the best hotels in Qiandao Lake. The room faces the lake and is breathtakingly beautiful. The water temperature of the swimming pool is suitable and there are not many people. On Chris**as Eve, the waiter dressed in Chris**as clothes brought fruit and yogurt. The hotel's waiters are all well-trained and serve with a smile, making people feel comfortable and relaxed.

Narlan's service is really nothing to say. I would like to give a thumbs up to the waiter Huang Xiuqin. I would like to thank you for the foot bath bucket that was sent to relieve the fatigue of the day. The handwritten card is really thoughtful. I will choose Junlan without hesitation next time~

msg:I have stayed here before, so I chose Media for this trip. It is built on Linghu Lake. It is very close to Fisherman's Wharf and also close to Fish Street. The lake view I stayed at this time was really comfortable and the room was big enough. The bathroom is also separated from wet and dry, and the shower has a large bathtub. The bathroom is very large and very clean. It is really refreshing to watch the lake view from the balcony. The service is as good as ever. Because I have poor sleep quality and a bad heart, I called the front desk specifically to inform Helped me arrange a quiet room inside. I was really satisfied after checking in. The breakfast was as rich as ever. Anyway, it is better than other five-star hotels in Qiandao Lake. I decided to go to Changsha at midnight so I stayed for two nights. I must give a five-star review. Qiandao Lake is my favorite city when traveling, so I come here often. Media has always been my first choice. I watched Water Spirit again and took the Earl. Overall, I liked it here.

msg:The hotel is really good. I wanted to take my kids to Qiandao Lake on an impromptu trip and chose Narada. I was not disappointed. I booked a family duplex room. I highly recommend this room type for a family. It has a lot of space and privacy upstairs and downstairs. The service is very good, and it is very convenient to take care of children and the elderly. When I went there, I had an extra child, but the package only had four breakfasts. The front desk manager Song Xinnu (must mark it as a thank you) was very considerate and took the initiative to send an extra breakfast. Although the coupon is not much, I suddenly became very fond of the hotel. It is very quiet outside the hotel at night, which is very suitable for walking and chatting. I must stay here next time I go to Qiandao Lake. Highly recommended👍👍👍

It's inconvenient for those who drive there. It's hard to find the intersection when going there. There's construction outside when you go back. There was a traffic jam after waiting for a while. The hotel did not have the best emergency plan, which was not good! The service is very good!

msg:After coming to Qiandao Lake so many times, this is the first time I stayed at the Media Narada Hotel. At the price of 888, you can actually stay in a duplex suite of 80 square meters. There are two adults, one young and two elderly, one 2-meter large bed, two 1.35-meter single beds, and a baby cot. It is really enough. Narada is also a relatively old hotel in Qiandao Lake. At first, I was worried that the location was relatively remote and the facilities were old, but after arriving, these concerns disappeared completely. I would like to thank the lobby manager Yu Rong. Originally, the room only included breakfast for 4 people. Seeing that we were bringing children, she directly helped us solve the problem of children's breakfast. The next day, because we were on the island and delayed our check-out time, she helped us in time. Pack your luggage and check out. Thank you very much. Oh, I also want to praise our room service Huang Xiuqin. I really need to give you a thumbs up for the turndown service. My parents were particularly surprised when they entered the room. I have to give you a big thumbs up👍🏻. If I have a chance, I will choose Narlan next time I come.

The hotel has an exclusive peninsula, the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant, and the natural oxygen bar

Rent a bicycle at the hotel and ride along the lake for an hour, it’s fun!

We asked the hotel staff to coordinate a room upgrade. Lobby manager Yu Rong first helped us check if there were any available lake-view suites. Lucky for us, we also had an executive lake-view suite. I moved there after paying for the upgrade.

1. Transportation: After the Qiandao Lake High-speed Railway exits the station, you can take the High-speed Railway Hotel Shuttle Bus No. 001, which will pass through several stations in the city. The terminal is Junlan. It costs 15 yuan/person. It is very convenient and takes 45 minutes. It takes about 35 minutes by taxi. , about 75 yuan.
2. Facilities: The hotel has been open for many years, but the facilities are well maintained. The sink is also equipped with a small bottle of hand-washing laundry detergent, which is very considerate. The hotel has two indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and the baby had a great time swimming.
3. Environment: The hotel is in an excellent location, next to the cruise ship terminal, and behind the hotel lobby is Qiandao Lake. It has a peninsula lake view and is quiet and exclusive. The restaurant overlooks the lake view upstairs, which is beautiful. The air is fresh and oxygen-rich, perfect for running in the morning and evening. It’s very comfortable to walk, the pictures say it all~
4. Service: The service is as considerate as ever, with a high standard of Narada experience. When checking in, female manager Song Xin upgraded the room type when she saw that she brought a baby with her, and responded to room requests in a timely manner.
5. Breakfast: Because the hotel is located on a peninsula, it is quiet and peaceful, and there are no restaurants nearby. It is recommended that you have breakfast in the hotel. There are rich Chinese and Western meals. Remember to try the scallion oil noodles from the noodle stall and the small rice dumplings from the Chinese dim sum. ! From the quality of the fruits, we can see Narada's control over the details. The watermelon, cantaloupe and grapes are very sweet and taste good. I personally feel that the food and beverage control is more careful than that of the Hilton and Sheraton. Moreover, the portions of various meals and snacks are relatively exquisite and appropriate, without causing unnecessary waste.
One last tip: The hotel can learn from the details of parent-child hotels and equip the room with stair stools to make it easier for children to wash up and make it inconvenient for adults to hold them.

You can enjoy luxury cars, and Didi taxis here are also very convenient to go to scenic spots. Because the high-speed train home was very late, the hotel thoughtfully provided afternoon tea so that we could have a rest.

Also a reminder, if you have friends who want to stay in this hotel, the taxi from the high-speed train to the hotel costs about 100 yuan. It is more affordable to recommend the bus at 15 yuan per person. You need to take a taxi to go to various scenic spots in the hotel. I am actually not very satisfied with the taxi drivers here. They have a strong commercial smell. They seem to be chatting with you, but in fact they are like selling. I personally think it depends on your needs, and what they say may not be true. Affordable! All in all, I think the hotel is pretty good, and you can also see the Sunset Hotel. If you go to scenic spots, it depends on your requirements, as it varies from person to person.

The front desk lady Song Xinnu has been following the service from check-in to check-out. She is warm and considerate. I feel at home. I feel at ease. Thank you. Little fairy.

Transportation: Take the hotel shuttle bus from Qiandao Lake Railway Station according to the instructions for 15 yuan/person. The end point is the entrance of Medea Junlan. The whole journey takes about 50 minutes, which is very convenient. The hotel is a 15-minute walk from the central pier of Qiandao Lake, 5 minutes by car, and 6 yuan for online car-hailing, which is very convenient.

Catering: The fish head soup in the Chinese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, big bream in scallion oil, and Fujian Laofan are highly recommended and taste great. Especially the fish head soup, a must order when visiting the restaurant, the soup is fresh and the meat is delicious.

Service: When checking in, the young lady at the front desk, Song Xinnv, added WeChat and told her that during the vacation, she could contact her at any time if she had any questions. She was very thoughtful and received five-star praise. The big security guard at the gate is also very enthusiastic. He guides the route to the island and the features of the tour, and takes the trouble. The soft power of the five-star hotel must be praised.

In short, Medea Narada is the first choice hotel for Qiandao Lake vacation. Although the facilities are a bit old, the room supplies and services are absolutely outstanding, and the price/performance ratio is very high. I highly recommend it.

The bathroom is very large and there is a children's bathtub. The lobby manager, Song Xin, has a very good service, and she accompanied us all the way. Let us have the buffet afternoon tea first and wait for the room to be cleaned. The Chinese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel is very delicious and not expensive, except that the fish head soup is more expensive. It is recommended that you do not go to the nearby Internet celebrity farmhouse, the environment is poor, and the dishes are also very bad. Looking at the view of Qiandao Lake, eating delicious food, and watching the sunset of Qiandao Lake on the terrace after dinner, it is very pleasant. Go swimming in the open-air swimming pool again, don't be too late, the water will be a bit cold. Opposite the hotel is the pier in the central lake area, but the commercialization is too strong, and it feels less fun than the southeast lake area.

Take the bus directly from Qiandaohu Railway Station for 15r
arrive in about an hour
Lots of hotel guests drop off along the way
We were the last to get off at this hotel
It can be seen that the location is very good

The hotel is built along the lake away from the main road
You can't see the hotel from the outside, it's very quiet
If you are in a hotel like this in Beijing, it is considered very high-end
It's very comfortable to take a walk along the lake after dinner
The air is exceptionally good

The room is also very spacious
Originally booked a deluxe lake view twin room
Yu Rong, a beautiful woman at the front desk, helped me upgrade to an executive lake view room
thank you so much
The service staff of the hotel are very enthusiastic and introduced us
Places to visit around
left a deep impression on us

The hotel is very close to the pier in the central lake area
Enter the hotel's internal road and you can see the cruise ships at the pier
And the cruise ship will pass by the lake behind the hotel
It's so beautiful to take pictures

During the stay, the newlyweds are also required to hold a wedding here
It is also because of the beautiful environment of the hotel
Next time I go to Qiandao Lake, I will continue to choose this resort hotel

All the service staff are very enthusiastic, especially thanks to the female manager Song Xin.

It is said that Qiandao Lake is the county with the most five-star hotels in China. As expected, it really dazzled me. After thousands of choices, "Narada Resort Hotel Mediaia" was finally selected. The hotel is next to the pier in the central lake area, and the lake view room can see cruise ships coming in and out. The bedding is comfortable, the bath water is large, and the wifi is fast. But the room facilities are a bit old (the floor creaks), and the air conditioner is not strong enough. The breakfast is quite rich, and you can enjoy the lake view while eating. The hotel has free underground parking. Not far to "Fish Street". The hotel also raises peacocks, bunnies, and birds.

msg:A vacation trip that suddenly changed due to booking the wrong ticket brought a perfect hotel experience! Before staying at Qiandaohu Media Narada Hotel, the destination should be Qingdao. I wanted to take a quick trip, but found that the wrong date was booked at the ticket gate of the high-speed railway station, and it was impossible to continue. Negotiation I finally decided to come to Qiandao Lake, but the arrival time will be very late. To be honest, such a change is very bad, and I will not feel very good... Choosing a hotel is simply reading the reviews and placing an order. I have never stayed in a hotel under Narada before. Arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. After seeing the room on the spot, I found that the room type I booked was not suitable for us, and then I had to add a lot of money to change the room type. The already bad mood was even worse... At this time, Song Xin, the female manager at the front desk, quickly made a decisive decision Arranged for us to upgrade to a two-story duplex suite for free that night. To be honest, the feeling of entering the room is really great. The super-large upper and lower two-story suites allow us to spend a comfortable night when we are tired. My mood has returned to ninety We split up, and we thoughtfully waived the upgrade fee for the next two days (the price of a three-night suite in the peak tourist season is not cheap). In the past few days, Manager Song has been taking good care of us, and he has been caring about us until the return trip, which made me feel that this trip was worthwhile. Excellent value for money, of course, the excellent service is reflected in all aspects of the hotel, the considerate turndown service of the room aunt, different fresh fruits and drinks are delivered every day (such as the hotel's homemade mung bean soup, white fungus, wolfberry and red dates soup, etc.), and Manager Yu at the front desk helped to coordinate the change of the set menu of the Chinese restaurant, and the two waiters at the front desk ran to help pack breakfast when we checked out at 6:30 am on the 9th (I had previously agreed with Manager Song that the time was 6:45, and she had already arranged It’s done, I’m going ahead temporarily), I can’t list all the above, I can only express my sincere thanks! Thanks to the excellent team of Qiandao Lake Mediaya Narada Resort & Spa! Let's have an unforgettable time! Finally, I want to talk about the hotel again. First of all, the first impression is that the old five-star resort hotel has been carefully designed and has been well maintained. There is no difference between social animals who go out on official business all the year round), vacations should be to enjoy comfortable and relaxing services, and high-quality human services are the most expensive. As a dual gold card user of Wan*zhou*, it is the first time I feel the high-quality service of Narada system, which will give me another good choice in the future. Qiandao Lake Scenic Area is very beautiful, I will come again, as for the hotel, there is no doubt that it must be Mediaya Narada!

I booked two rooms and stayed for three nights. I called on the day of check-in and asked to be in an adjacent room. The lobby manager Liu Xiutian provided very good service. He not only met the request, but also helped us upgrade the room to a lake view room. The room is large and has a good view. My mother is very satisfied with the twin beds of 1.35 meters and two basins.
The hotel does a very good job in breakfast, entertainment and service. The breakfast is very rich. It rained one day in three days, so we can have fun in the hotel. There is a swimming pool, football, children's playground, sand digging pool, children's reading corner, and small animals.
On the day I left the store, I asked for an invoice. Because I was in a hurry, I added the hotel’s WeChat account. Later, Liu Xiutian, the lobby manager, handled the invoice in a timely manner and delivered it to my home.

The only slight disadvantage is the balcony of the room, which is too narrow, and it will be better visually if the depth can be wider by 50 cm. But this is very difficult to expand, I just feel that there is a little bit of inadequacy in the original design.

Manager Zhang Yuping is enthusiastic about her service and has first-class ability. Attentive service is a plus for this hotel.

Later on the boat, I saw a big park in the backyard of the hotel next to Qiandao Lake. The layout of upstairs and downstairs is very reasonable. I will recommend friends to come next time.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed at Qiandao Lake Mediaya Narada Resort. The experience is better than the first time. First of all, the hotel lobby manager Liu Xiutian's service is very good. Seeing that I was on vacation with my parents, I directly upgraded the deluxe lake view twin room so that I can enjoy the best view of Qiandao Lake without leaving the room! And when we saw us, we asked how the experience of living was good. This makes people feel warm and warm. The room attendant will often take care of the room simply to make you feel at home. When we checked in on the day of check-in, the manager Liu Xiutian in the lobby also added my WeChat in time so that I could give her feedback immediately when I encountered any problems during the check-in. It was really great. During the period, due to the impact of the epidemic, the breakfast was delivered to the room and she also It is really humane to understand in time and give more weight. In short, I highly recommend Qiandao Lake Mediaya Narada Hotel. They are considerate of guests in every way, and they are very considerate in dealing with people. It is definitely a brand chain hotel that works with conscience. I will continue to choose it when I travel to Qiandao Lake in the future!

msg:The hotel has an excellent perspective, with a sweeping view of the central lake area, like a big stage, with a magnificent picture unfolding slowly. The boats passing by on the channel are very lively. I feel that apart from the Grand Duke of Huangshan Mountain, the characteristics of Qiandao Lake are all here, and the weather is cold, so there is no need to go out in the house. I went to Hilton first. The landscape there is an inner lake, which is relatively small, and it is not as rich in layers as here. I can't see the characteristics of Qiandao Lake Flowerpot Island and Qunbian Mountain at all. The hotel manager Zhang Yuping received warmly and was flexible in thinking, and immediately helped to solve the problems encountered. In short, the impression is good, worthwhile trip!

The fish head in the Chinese restaurant is much better than the nearby online celebrity shop, very good. The only thing that is so-so is the breakfast, which doesn't quite match the hotel. I went down to take a look in two days, went back to my room and slept until noon to go out for food. The most memorable thing is that I haven’t set off fireworks by myself for many years, but this time it was really cool to set off fireworks at the hotel🥳

If you want to go out, walk for 15 minutes to the pier in the scenic spot, and walk for 10 minutes to the Internet celebrity restaurant to taste the food. The hotel's own restaurant is also very good.
Just for leisure and relaxation, I have been to Qiandao Lake three times and stayed in a No. 3 middle school hotel. This hotel is especially suitable for parents who don’t want to drive and wait in crowded cars. Very good value for money in a hotel with a good location

On the eve of the long holiday, we were unexpectedly upgraded to a lake view room for free. The room is not only big, but the scenery outside the window is beautiful, and the round bathtub is also the favorite of children! After staying for two nights, I also took more than an hour to visit every corner of the hotel near the lake. Parents and children posed in various poses, and regarded it as a special attraction 😀. Here, I would like to thank Zhang Yuping, the lobby manager, for his thoughtful service and answering our questions at any time. If we have the opportunity, we will definitely come again to enjoy the wonderful holiday of Qiandao Lake!

In addition, the hotel provides charging piles, one fast charging and two slow charging. It is convenient for owners of new energy vehicles to use. There is a children's playground on the first floor, which is not too big, but it is not bad. There are two swimming pools, large and small, which are more fun in summer.

The manager Liu Xiutian in the lobby saw that we had children, so he took the initiative to help us make a bed and add breakfast. The service staff in the restaurant and at the door are also very friendly.
Narada's room is relatively large. This room type does not have a balcony. The decoration of the hotel may be old, and some places will be mottled, but it is cleaned very clean.
The cafeteria has a row of outdoor locations, and it is very pleasant to eat in the morning. The quality of the meals can only be said to be up to standard, but this time I stayed in three five-star hotels, all of which are similar, which may be the case with the local equipment.
Overall, it is a cost-effective one, and it is recommended to stay.

According to the beautiful pictures in the promotional introduction of Narada Resort Hotel Qiandao Lake Media (see Figure 1-2), we did not consider the members of the Hilton Hotel Qiandao Lake, but chose to book a two-night stay at the luxury lake at 4,880 yuan from October 4 to 6. King King Room No. 6107, after checking in, I found that I was cheated (see Figure 3). From 13:30-15:00 in the afternoon, it was still unsolvable, wasting a good afternoon.
The hotel management, looking for various reasons, tried every means to justify it, and responded with 2 buffet dinner subsidies, which did not cure the symptoms. On October 10th, the director of housekeeping still had no sincerity in calling, and he always avoided admitting his mistakes, and kept silent about the error correction and improvement guarantee measures that will no longer be put in the luxury lake view king bed room for external sales in the future. For this reason, I would like to expose it on the Coroutine website. The business ethics of the hotel is not good, and I would like to remind you to avoid stepping on thunder in the future.

Let us go to the traditional Chinese medicine hospital for nucleic acid testing. When we came back, we called the manager. The manager came out. Why? Don't let the manager cooperate with the battery car [laughs through tears], when he saw us, he was helping us with our complaints, and he was also helping us with relevant phone calls. I really wanted to lose my temper in a hurry, but I saw the manager sweating outside the car and helping us He made various calls and sent us water to accompany us, so I persuaded myself, because it happened to be stuck at the government lunch break at 12 o'clock. The problem that the government could solve in 10 minutes was solved in nearly 50 minutes, and I happened to meet Manager Li. , I had the cheek to ask him for a breakfast coupon, and they agreed with a good attitude. Thank you very much. At the front desk who finally came in after all the hardships, the lobby manager Yu Lingli and Miss Pepe warmly received them. We also seriously told us how to operate and so on. The same room helped to leave a 1.35 bed. The facilities are really complete. You need to wear a swimming cap for swimming. 15 yuan is also given to children, amu*****t park, sand pool, The buffet is 138. If you have an ICBC credit card, it is 68. Unfortunately, I don't have [wipe your sweat]. It is really a good place to take a leisurely vacation. It is worth recommending. As troublesome as we are, it is recommended, big hotel, integrated leisure and entertainment 😄

msg:Transportation: This time I travel with the whole family. Both the ground and underground garages of the hotel can be parked, which is very convenient for traveling around.

Hygiene: The hygiene of the room is very good, especially the bathroom is bright, spacious and clean. The beds, including the children's bedding, are clean and fresh, and the room is also dry and fresh. The master bedroom on the second floor is equipped with an air purifier.

Environment: The hotel occupies a large area with a lake view and garden landscape.

Facilities: The hotel's children's playground is relatively small, and there are not many projects. And on the first floor, the light is very dark, which is not very comfortable. The sand pool in the lobby on the third floor is still bright.

Catering: The buffet breakfast is quite rich, with both Chinese and Western styles. I especially like Chinese-style breakfasts such as bean curd and fried dumplings. The espresso taste for breakfast is also good.
Especially praise Wen Guangxuan's fish head, it is really excellent. Stayed for two days and ate all Chinese food at Wenguangxuan.

Room: I wanted to book a room facing the lake, but my family wanted to live together. Also considered several other popular hotels, or Narada's family duplex room is better. Although you can't see the lake view from the room, you can see it when you walk around the hotel. This duplex room has 2 floors, the first floor has 2 single beds of 1.35 meters, which is also very comfortable; the first floor has its own bathroom, but there is no shower facility; the first floor has a water bar and a small refrigerator provided by the hotel drinks. The second floor is the master bedroom, cloakroom and oversized bathroom, which are separated from wet and dry. Because it is a parent-child room, there are bathtubs, footstools, small toilet seats and toiletries for children; including the cloakroom, small bathrobes and toiletries are also provided for children. Slippers; the king bed in the master bedroom is 2 meters wide, and there is a baby bed, which can also lie down for adult women of medium height.


Service: The bellman will deliver the carry-on luggage to the room and help with it. A dedicated staff will connect and provide in-store services. There are welcome fruits every day, and drinks in the water bar are updated.

Overall, the experience is good, that is, if the outdoor swimming pool is open during the day, the other small outdoor swimming pool for children does not seem to be open, which is a little regrettable. The scale of the children's playground is not large enough, and there are few projects. I hope the light can be brighter.

A little suggestion: As a five-star resort hotel, the sports facilities, billiards, table tennis, and table tennis are all paid items, except for the gym and swimming pool! And there are too many rechargeable game consoles in the children's park, which I personally don't think is healthy.

We were not disappointed when we came here after check-in. The hotel has its own indoor and outdoor swimming pools and an indoor children's playground. There are many parrots in the playground. The scenery around the hotel is also very good. Not worth it. One more thing, because we did not check carefully before checking out, we checked out and left the hotel. At that time, it took more than 20 minutes to leave the hotel. The lady at the welcome desk called me on WeChat and told me that my husband’s two iPads were left behind. We got the hotel room and let's fold it back to get it. Special thanks to the two young ladies Yu Rong and Yu Lingli at the hotel reception desk. Their service is really good. If you go to Qiandao Lake next time, you will also choose Narada Resort Hotel Media.

Although it is full during the summer vacation, the scale of the hotel is not as large as that of Hilton, and the traffic is not crowded. The hotel walks along the lake, almost no one is there. Xiaolu and Rongmei in the business center have very good service. They can book a lot of items, and the tickets are cheaper than buying them directly. In particular, it is recommended to take the Hilton cruise ship to take the cable car to watch the top of Huangshan Mountain. The whole journey is 2.5 hours, and it is not tiring. The funny thing is that we stayed at Hilton yesterday and asked them that there is no discount for their own project 360. Instead, they booked 340 with Narada's business center! In high season, Narada is highly recommended.
Chinese restaurant ordering is very satisfactory, better than Hilton's Chinese food. Dinner buffet is not recommended, of course not recommended for every dinner buffet, either unpalatable or crowded 😁
Narada's lake view room is also more beautiful than Hilton. Of course, Hilton's facilities and scale are higher, but it is more suitable for exclusive use in off-season 😂

msg:This family trip to Qiandao Lake this time, I didn't expect to be able to check in because I arrived earlier. The room is very big, probably because it is near the water. The room is a bit damp as a whole. The air purifier didn't work either. I took a nap at noon and asked my aunt to change the sheets and quilts. The hotel service was good. I was impressed that the security guard at the intersection of the hotel was very responsible. On a hot day, every car was outside. All cars entering the hotel scan the code, and the epidemic prevention is in place! Hotel services are basically responsive, there are surprises! Because I was excited on the first day of my stay, I simply cleaned up and went out to play the Time Tunnel. It took 2 minutes by car to go to Moonlight Island at night.

If you don’t take the initiative to provide toiletries, you need to apply for it yourself, and there are only toothbrushes and combs. If you don’t apply for it the next day, you won’t get it. For the standard of 4 people staying in a suite, only a mini bottle is given for 2 days. Fortunately, I brought it with me. The upper and lower toilets only gave one hand sanitizer, and the second bottle was given after asking for 2 times; in addition, the water pressure in the room on the 6th floor is too low, the suite has 2 floors, the first floor uses hot water and the second floor does not have it, the second floor The next morning, there was nothing up and down, and the hot water turned yellow in the middle. I hope the hotel will strengthen management and improve facilities and equipment to better serve customers.

  When I arrived at the hotel, I saw that I was bringing two children and would help with the luggage.
 The air in the children's park is a bit bad and there is a musty smell! I'm not feeling well after a long stay
Swimming pool: When we went there, the swimming pool outside the city was not used, but the indoor water level was not high. People who can't swim like me also had a good time. They will provide bath towels if you don't have a swimsuit and a swimming cap. My husband just bought a pair of swimming trunks, 100 swimming caps, 15 swimming caps, and a child's free swimming ring for 10 yuan. It feels more expensive. If you decide to play, you can bring your own.
Room: We live in a family suite. There are a few very careful places in the room. Every corner of the table will be wrapped. There are blankets next to the bed. There are toilets and small toilets for children. There are also bathrobes for children.
The hotel has bicycles, the family rented one for 75 an hour and 150 for the second hour because we have business courtesy, so it is half cheaper, but riding in summer is really tiring!

Thank you very much for the surprise arrangement of the hotel. The hotel service is actually quite good. The waiter will take the initiative to say hello no matter if he is busy or not. The service was given 4 points, mainly at 3:00: 1⃣️When I came back from outside on the 4th, I found that when the new fruit plate was delivered in the guest room, the "old" fruit plate sent on the 3rd was cleaned up (there are still a lot of fruit in it, and we brought it ourselves. lychee), this is the first time I encountered this situation when I stayed in so many five-star hotels (people will just put a new fruit plate); 2⃣️The refund of the deposit was not timely, and it was said that it would be automatically refunded when I left the store. As a result, I drove 3 After returning to Hangzhou for more than an hour, I still haven’t received a refund. After Ctrip contacted me, I immediately received the hotel’s deposit refund text message. On the morning of 3.4, I took the elevator from the room to the lobby to go to the restaurant for breakfast. The waitress in the lobby must be We wore masks and politely informed her that we were going to have breakfast (Hangzhou residents have always been tested for 72 hours, and the green code and itinerary code have been checked many times when I checked into the hotel on the 3rd), but the waitress said, "Have breakfast. Wear a mask too"...I hope the service will continue to improve. Old customer, will come again next time

I think the executive room will be used for the high floor. Yeah, see the picture above for the lake view.

The service is in place. Staying for 2 nights includes 2 days of breakfast and 1 day of afternoon tea. The price is worth the trip.

I booked a parent-child room, and the overall feeling is good, very clean! There is also an indoor swimming pool on the first floor, children's play facilities, and the waiters are also very polite. They will greet the guests when they see them, especially the laundry is dried for us, which is great! The front desk also gave us afternoon tea and DIY cake vouchers, which the children like very much. Although it is off-season to go to play now, it is still worth a visit! The experience is still very good, whether it is Li Zhiying and Wu Zhenni at the front desk, or the cleaning aunt, it feels very kind! Will come again in the future!

The bathroom in the room has been reprocessed, and the glass glue is white without mold, which is much better than expected. The parent-child room is relatively large, with tents, small tables and chairs, and building blocks. It is enough for our 1-year-old and 2-year-old children to play. Floor attendants Yu Lingli, Yang Jianying and Wang Xiao helped us arrange the room in advance and gave us birthday cakes and souvenirs. Thank you very much! The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel’s children’s playground is a bit mini, so bookings made through Ctrip cannot be superimposed with Narada Platinum Card.

The lake view was mediocre, the facilities in the room were mediocre, the price/performance ratio was too bad, and the overall experience was just too bad. I spent 2100 on the hotel! The afternoon tea is very disappointing, the breakfast quality is not high, there is no one-time use in the room, I called twice in the evening because I wanted disposable slippers, the first time I forgot it, the second time I waited for a long time and did not send it, and in the end I simply did not wear it It's too late and I'm sorry to disturb the staff, so far I don't want to stay for the second time! In the end, I lost the charger for personal reasons. I contacted the hotel when I got home, and they said it was not there. I was sure it was plugged in at the head of the bed. It would be amazing if the person cleaning the room couldn’t see it. I don’t want to say anything more. In the end, it was Ctrip. Propose compensation, and remind the compatriots who are about to stay in this hotel to be optimistic about their own things, they will not be able to see things lost! If you have enough budget, choose another hotel. I guarantee that you will regret it if you stay in this hotel.

Now it is too convenient to travel. Just book a room online in advance, and the high-speed rail will take the hotel. The bus is 15 yuan per person and it takes about 1 hour to go directly. This hotel is the last stop of the route and it is a few minutes walk after arrival. Go...The decoration of the hotel looks a bit old, and the service is good. There are free coffee drinks for guests to enjoy. This is definitely a bonus for the hotel....👍The hotel has a nice view with a lake and green trees everywhere, garden view The facilities in the room generally have a balcony, but I like to go out to blow the air and look at it from a distance, but all I see are the gardens...The weather in Qiandao Lake is also very hot this day, and it will be more comfortable in November after seeing it...

I was a bit entangled when choosing a hotel before, because the comfort of the hotel is still very important because of resort-style tourism, so many hotels are a bit dazzling. Miss Lu from the reservation depar**ent and Yu Rong at the front desk patiently answered questions about the itinerary and helped me upgrade to a lake-view room. There is a tourist bus to the hotel at the high-speed rail station, which costs 15 yuan per person, which is very convenient. Narada's lake view is very good, the lake view is wider than many hotels seen along the road. It’s very convenient to eat, drink and play around the hotel. On the first day, I wanted to buy a boat ticket to go to the island. When I returned to my room, I saw the beautiful lake view under the sunset. . In the morning, the variety of the restaurant is still very rich. It is very pleasant to watch the lake view and chat while eating. The hotel is within walking distance to the core scenic area of Silk Street, and it is also close to the Fish Street in the afternoon. Narada's environmental services have left a wonderful place for the trip to Qiandao Lake. Friends are also very happy to have fun. Everyone makes an appoin**ent to spend their vacations often in the future.

It has a wide field of vision, and when you wake up in the morning, you can enjoy the golden light of the morning sun in the clouds while standing on the balcony. The swimming pool is divided into outdoor and indoor. The outdoor swimming pool is unique with bubble pool and hammocks. The entire outdoor public area is basically surrounded by the lake or dotted with greenery, quiet and leisurely. Service: Almost every staff member encountered by the hotel is full of smiles. The fruit gift and good night snacks on the first day are very attentive. Location: Not remote, a few kilometers away from Fish Street and food stalls. It is within walking distance of the popular Yushuiyao.

msg:The location is not very convenient, a little bit off. The sense of service needs to be strengthened, especially in the area of parent-child, no matter how good the main focus is, it is a gimmick to serve parents and children who cannot put themselves in the place! The bathroom is large, but the floor is slippery! Especially after the wet water, don’t ask me how I knew it. There is an open-air swimming pool. Children like it very much. There is also a small children’s playground. Unfortunately, the weather is too hot. Although the child likes to play, he sweats after jumping twice. The hotel’s route design is also unreasonable. It is clearly right in front of you, but it takes a long time to go around. Eating and playing are particularly inconvenient!

4. Phone service is responsive, and IT is also great. You can even make local recommendations even with WIFI
5. The breakfast was good and the environment was amazing! Suitable for couples and families Many places are suitable for taking pictures! The hotel can see the lake view. The room is also a lake view room. Wake up in the morning to see the beautiful view!

I personally feel that the breakfast buffet is pretty good, and the dinner buffet is not very friendly to people who don’t eat seafood, but overall it’s okay, not expensive, and acceptable.
The hotel staff are very kind, and they will take the initiative to say hello when they see the baby. The room service is twice a day. Goodnight cookies and yogurt will be given after the afternoon is packed. The welcome fruit is also given when you check in. The room attendant has a very good attitude. Thank you Wang Caili Director Wang Xiao, caring service and friendly attitude

🔺Because I really want to be empty, I came here for a trip to Qiandao Lake
The location of the hotel is not particularly close to the city center. It is not particularly convenient. It’s on the side of the pier. There are not many takeaway options. Especially... late night...

But it is definitely suitable for a small partner who is going to take a vacation and rest. Book a lake view room in the morning to see the rising sun. Look at the islands and cruise ships on the lake. At night, you can enjoy the sunset. There is also a leisure area on the lake. It is just a kind of enjoyment. There are also multi-person bicycles that can be rented, so you can spend a day in the hotel

🔺I originally booked the lake view room. When I checked in, the two front desk brothers who wore glasses helped to upgrade the executive lake view room and gave the executive courtesy.

🔺There are not too many types of breakfast in the hotel, but it is definitely enough for me. The combination of Chinese and Western, and the scenery and the scenery are already full marks.

🔺When you check in, you will give a fish head voucher for the hotel restaurant. If you don’t stay in the hotel, I suggest you go out to eat. It may also be because I have too high expectations for fish head.

🔺 Forgot to mention that there are small sugar water gifts every day~ The taste is good!

My parents-in-law are getting older, and unfortunately the gods are not beautiful, there is more rain and it is inconvenient to travel, but the view from the room is good and they are very satisfied; I The big bed room with my husband also has a special dressing area for ladies; the waiter in the breakfast restaurant saw the in-laws walking by, and immediately came to greet and greet each other; the other waiters in the hotel were also very warm and polite, and there were free coffee and snacks in the lobby; VR to see the world , Let the parents-in-law also experience high-tech; not to mention the scenery of the hotel; breakfast is ok, in-laws are more satisfied, this three-day trip to Qiandao Lake left us with good memories!

msg:房間：入住的中心湖景房，剛開始安排的6樓，因為陽台風景有遮擋，提出換房要求後，客服餘蓉非常貼心的很快安排了5樓中央正對湖景的房間。房間衞生設施都挺不錯，基本滿意。

環境：正對湖景，視野開闊，非常漂亮，緊靠中心湖區碼頭，偶爾有汽笛聲，不過總體不影響，也算獨有的風景。

服務：客服餘蓉有求必應，迴應迅速。但還是要給貴酒店一些建議。第一：拿行李進酒店大門開始，門僮看了兩眼，毫無反應，既不打招呼也不幫忙安排幫拿行李。第二：換房過程中是前台一個服務生帶着的，看完新房間以後他跟着去原房間拿房卡，看着我們大包小包拿行李視若無睹，直接轉身走人。第三，出遊忘記帶手機充電器，打了電話以後也有服務員送至房間，但她反覆強調這是她的私人充電器，問我們為何不用床頭收費的充電器。。。還是希望貴酒店能為客人準備一些充電器。其餘的都很滿意！特別是入住的第二天，打掃客房的大姐知道我們在外玩了一天，一定特別累，特別貼心的準備了泡腳桶，連浴室地墊都給我們放的好好的，非常貼心。總體來説就是貴酒店的服務給人的感覺是有亮點，但沒有規範流程，更傾向於看服務人員個人職業素養。希望服務這一塊能夠繼續改進。

[位置]離旅遊景點都不算太遠，離中心碼頭很近，離東南碼頭大概18分鐘，而且在酒店也能有非常多的外賣選擇。
[房間]行政中心湖景房很寬敞，裏面有浴缸、沙發畫、落地窗，層高也蠻高。
[遊樂設施]有室外室內兩個泳池，岸邊桌椅休閑區，小童樂園有室內和室外兩個!
[服務]餘經理（餘榮）很親切很禮貌。每天房間還會有小水果~因為是週五週六去的,人不是很多。因為帶的是小寶寶，酒店提供床圍!這點真的是太貼心了啊!
[餐飲]酒店內部有自助和餐廳，早餐還可以。還去吃了炒菜的中餐廳，大眾套餐價格味道都還可以，已經為大家試過了。

預訂時看照片湖景很好視野很好，一眼心動，帶家人出來玩立馬預訂，特地選了高一檔的房型就是為了視野，細數讓人大失所望：
1. 所謂湖景左右下全是建築遮擋，很遠一小片湖；明明有房空着不給視野好的，覺得好欺負？
2. 晚上睡覺門居然是透光的很亮，無語了
3. 衞生間居然透風洗澡很冷

來了之後一跟前台交流我就懂了

平心而論 服務太差了 服務員特別楞 想要服務需要你給她遞話問她怎麼著 她們是不會主動的 我感覺我是給她們服務的 我是前台

最讓我難以置信的是酒店的規模 用我慢慢遛彎的速度15分鐘酒店外步道就能走完 但凡走路快點的10分鐘了不地了

早飯看似豐富 麪包不新鮮很次
客房比較寬敞乾淨 入住率不高所以很安靜
客房服務員比前台親切多了

總之便宜有便宜的道理 誰願意去誰去吧

msg:在這個五一小長假裏，選擇了千島湖君瀾酒店作為我們的度假目的地。這次的親子游體驗很滿意 首先，我要特別提到酒店的工作人員。他們的服務態度真是讓人如沐春風。從入住的那一刻起，每一位員工都面帶微笑，熱情周到。無論是辦理入住手續，還是諮詢旅遊訊息，他們都能迅速、準確地給出答覆，尤其感謝宋新女的熱情服務。大堂有免費的咖啡和茶水。酒店每天提供的小零食，這些小零食不僅種類繁多，而且口味獨特。
游泳池是孩子們最喜歡的地方。君瀾酒店的游泳池開放時間長，水質清澈，設施完善。孩子們在泳池裡盡情嬉戲，大人們則可以在旁邊休息。
早餐也是一大亮點。酒店的早餐十分豐盛，不僅有中式早點，還有各種西式餐點。尤其是臨湖而建的餐廳，讓我們在品嚐美食的同時，還能欣賞到美麗的湖景，真是別有一番風味。
最後，我要説的是酒店特別適合親子游，大堂門口就有小動物，上午鴨子下午小羊，還有租借多人自行車，在酒店入口還有一個小小的萌寵樂園，有很多小動物。酒店裡的遊樂室也不錯，設施很多。

 首先酒店位於風景如畫的千島湖畔，周圍環繞着清澈湛藍的湖水和峽谷山脈，位置理想，步行至遊輪中心僅需2分鐘，非常適合欣賞湖景和進行水上活動。遊玩過程還得到了董總的安排。
其次客房寬敞明亮，裝修豪華典雅。配備了舒適的床品、高品質的傢俱和現代化的設施，我們住的客房還擁有超大露台特別是，能夠欣賞到酒店獨家的水幕電影和噴泉燈光秀，為客人的度假體驗增添了獨特的娛樂元素。清明期間降温，因為帶了長者小孩，酒店的董總還讓前台安排了電暖器。
第三，酒店的餐飲選擇豐富多樣，早餐很豐盛，晚餐自助餐也很不錯，值得體驗。
最後酒店非常適合親子度假，提供了一站式的遛娃度假體驗。有大型室內遊樂場，真人 CS，卡丁車，遊戲廳，還有游泳池，健身房。退房之後還送了伴手禮。

位置環境：在中心湖區，離碼頭特別近步行不到十分鐘，景色優美，尤其是湖景房（如圖1），驚喜滿滿，晚上散步🏃，感覺太舒服了。

設施服務：前台的接待是標桿級別的，態度熱情服務專業耐心周到，尤其是一位姓宋的前台，非常體貼，也很專業，無論任何問題總是專業細緻的回答，酒店門口有鴨子魚等（如圖2），可以花十塊錢買飼料餵養，孩子的最愛，房間很大，床也很舒服，還有迎賓水果。酒店大堂、早餐廳在三樓，餐廳在一樓，吃着午餐欣賞着美景，太舒心了。酒店有自己的碼頭，可以參加酒店的高端小團，從自己碼頭出發，非常方便。酒店有巡邏車把住客送到門口（走路約五分鐘）很貼心。

餐廳其他：早餐非常豐富，現做的很多，還有日料，關鍵看着千島湖就餐心情好不少。午餐也很好吃，廚師水平很高，酒店有室內室外兩個泳池，室外的不怎麼用，室內是恆温適合放鬆，晚上偶爾有燒烤節活動（本人去沒趕上），小朋友的最愛。國慶去時正趕上亞運會，自行車比賽就在淳安，比賽到正好路過酒店門口，帶着孩子看比賽，酒店還精心準備小紅旗，太貼心了，孩子參與了亞運會高興的不得了。

總述：高端酒店，一定要住湖景房，一定不會後悔，還有不少驚喜！

msg:建議把園景房改叫樓景房，房間實際情況與宣傳照片窗外綠植不符。我們由於到酒店較晚，第二天也打算坐遊船，考慮到大部分時間不在酒店，也就沒有和工作人員溝通，衹要乾淨清爽睡一晚就好！
問題來了，酒店的軟床中間下陷，我這一晚翻來覆去睡不舒服，肩膀和腰好酸！第二天早餐也沒去吃賴床上不想起，遊船也不想去了，怕登島太累了。
這樣一來在房間待的時間就多了，考慮到私隱，窗簾不能拉開，屋內光線昏暗，這和無窗房有什麼區別呢？8百多住不到明亮寬敞的房間這合理嗎？
優點也有，師傅主動幫我們提行李，魚頭蠻好吃，房間裏有一小瓶洗衣液，房間裏蠻乾淨的。早餐據我老公説還不錯，比我們在黃山悦榕莊的品質好。

與之相匹配的是，尤其應該提及的是，這裏如家般的温馨服務，貼心關懷，讓人感觸良多。大堂經理餘蓉女士不僅專業，為我們提供許多方便和幫助，同時更顯職業素養，真正把客人當家人看待。出門在外，境遇這樣的貼心服務和如家般的酒店令人流連忘返。

msg:在千島湖眾多酒店裡自然景觀絕對是頭部，辦理入住的時候大堂經理餘蓉非常熱情，安排的房間景觀無敵，坐在露台就可以看到最美的湖景，根本不需要去擠人山人海，誰能想到我這些照片都是五一假期拍的呢？房間裏的佈置也非常細緻，衞生做的很好。
酒店自己就有遊船碼頭，節假日也會安排活動，我們在酒店自己做了棉花糖，還玩了套圈等小活動。
最讚的還是酒店的餐廳，都是湖景絕佳的位置，無論是早餐還是下午茶，都賞心悦目。在酒店度過了非常愉快的三天，今後也會向每一個有意向來千島湖度假的親朋好友推薦君瀾酒店！
最後提兩個小建議，一是房間浴缸最好能加一個靠枕，二是酒店夜間送餐服務有待加強，祝酒店生意興隆！

msg:五一來千島湖玩，在眾多五星級酒店中選中了梅地亞，帶着孩子一共住店4晚，可以説體驗非常好！我們訂的是行政湖景大床房，景觀無敵，每天聽着遊艇的汽笛聲起床，望着湖面上不停穿梭的船支，孩子開心到不行。我們的管家是張玉萍，短髮美女，從安排入住到退房，服務無比周到，可以説是有求必應。酒店整體非常新，孩子特別喜歡酒店前面的山水景觀和一池塘的錦鯉和小鴨子，早餐也非常好吃選擇很多，還有中餐廳，連續吃了幾天都很滿意，價格也很合理。酒店的小童活動區也佈置的很好，雖然不大，但是服務很到位，離店的前一晚還和老公打了打球，60元一小時，玩的很開心，最後特別想説的是這家酒店的服務真的很不錯，每一位員工服務意識都很強，點贊。

設施：（亮點）非常齊全，房間傢俱不論新舊狀況都非常好、設計合理，特別的，套房設計以及傢俱靜音好，對小齡家庭非常非常友好。中餐廳低於預期，魚頭以外的炒菜油鹹，不能及時提醒和協助使用優惠點菜。
衞生：（亮點）超級超級乾淨，每天不論時間長短的出門，回來房間竟然都收拾過，並且收拾程度恰到好處
環境：户外湖景視野開闊，地處湖區碼頭附近，停車位充足，有親子設備、魚池、自行車
服務：（亮點）服務員超級友好、服務積極、人手充沛，前台和門口保安大哥都主動和小朋友互動。
前台張玉萍親和力高、非常熱情，給我們提供了很多住店支持。

全程有餘蓉的友好服務，有問必答，幫我們的行程增添了不少增值體驗，贊一個！感謝～
大堂禮賓處還能寄明信片、騎自行車。正好我們家最近在講《小兔菲利克斯環遊世界》系列故事，小孩子對寄信很感興趣，兩天連寄了兩張明信片。還體驗了騎雙人自行車，衹能説是體驗吧，爬坡太累了～禮賓台的小哥哥都特別好，主動招呼，特別熱情實誠，説還是實習生吧，但就是業務很熟練態度賊好，點贊加雞腿！
酒店在景區裏面，環境好，那麼離鎮中心就回遠一點，從馬路往酒店裡麪也有一點縱深～但是高鐵穿梭巴士終點就在這裏，打車也是隨叫隨到，總體還是很方便的，配套服務很成熟，老少皆宜～

msg:我平時很少評價，但這次必須説上幾句！
此次出差之際隨帶父母去千島湖遊玩了一圈，在入住這家酒店時給我的初步印象非常好，園林式的裝修風格，山頂的建築錯落有致，鳥語花香。毗鄰千島湖的地理位置也非常好。
軟件方面，服務人員看見客人必打招呼，這點做得非常棒。
接下來重點説一下酒店大堂經理（張經理）和副理（餘蓉），兩位得知我是帶着年邁的父母入住後，在我返滬離開酒店時特意準備了路上吃的水果和乾糧。這樣的服務高度是我住過所有五星級酒店裡從來沒有的經歷，同時也反應了千島湖人的淳樸和好客。
至於硬件方面就不説了，能達到這個級別的酒店都非常好，關鍵在服務方面，服務是客房率高的重要因素之一，這家酒店值得被點贊。
暑假我們再相會！
（兩個評價都是我的，父母入住套房，而我嘛，哈哈，大床房就夠了）

湖景位可以説是相當的正了
早餐自助我覺得也很不錯了
晚飯也在酒店中餐廳吃了兩頓
真的很好吃 也不算太貴

千島湖管理的真不錯啊！
環境非常好 商户們也都很熱情善良
沒有遇到那種令人不適的商户
不管是景點賣門票的工作人員
還是餐廳的上菜大姐
真的明顯感覺到她們的態度是特別真誠友善
而不是裝作歡迎你似的
今年的第一次旅遊 非常成功！

還好攜程介入，最終順利退了一個晚上。總的來説，這個酒店的入住體驗非常的不好，從衞生間到卧室到陽台，都非常老舊，先生説，還不如他之前住的隔壁600的綠城。（大家自己衡量）

這個酒店，唯一我覺得比較ok的就是早餐，還是比較豐富的，其他的，嗯……實在找不到更多可以表揚的地方了。就這樣吧，給大家一個提示，切勿踩坑，這個老牌五星，衹有“老”其他都沒有，別來浪費錢就對了。

辦理入住時，宋經理看到我們幾個家庭入住，免費幫我們升級了房間，還贈送了小童早餐和洗漱用品。特別是我入住後才和宋經理提到要預訂晚餐，她幫我們和餐廳溝通後，妥善安排好我們晚上用餐沒有等待太久餓肚子。
酒店的房間裏也配了小童的浴袍，洗衣液，室外晾衣架，環保的理念不主動提供一次性用品。酒店的餐飲做的也很好，早晚餐都非常豐盛，服務員動作也很麻利，眼裡有活。這些都讓我們有機會近距離感受千島湖和君瀾的美。我也非常推薦大家入住君瀾酒店！

但是酒店就在湖邊，外面的景色還是很不錯。

所以訂錯房了

msg:首先對他們沒有通知我們就把我們定的豪華園景房給賣了表示非常的不滿意，到店了直接説給我們升級行政園景房，其實就是把我們定的給賣掉了。而且我們去看了下房間味道有點重，裝修也比較老，我們不喜歡。衹好再加錢換了湖景房。湖景房景色還可以，但是房間裏全是帶血的蚊子！我們拍了大概有20隻！！嚇**。
所以我認為酒店服務很一般。

整體感覺很好。就是酒店一層的餐廳不太好吃😅但值得五星好評～

服務：服務人員都比較有禮貌，入住當天剛好有喜酒，中餐廳服務員比較少，但也還行，菜心做的有點鹹了，魚頭還行。

msg:和朋友一起耒千島湖玩，網上訂了梅地亞君瀾酒店，地理環境很好，天氣好湖水如藍寶石。因我們11點多到酒店，預訂的房間還在打掃，拿到房卡後，前台接待員餘玲莉告訴我們大約要等40分鐘，並介紹我們可以在三樓咖啡廳觀景樓休息一下，20分鐘後她還專門到咖啡廳耒找我們，給我們更換了另一間己打掃好的房間房卡，讓我們早些進房休息，並將洗漱用品也送耒了，服務非常熱情周到，還詳細介紹了早歺和晚歺地點時間。進了房間又有意外驚喜，除房間乾淨整潔外，床單上還有用毛巾折成的小兔子和大象，非常可愛，如果小朋友來肯定要吵着帶回去。床單上的"歡迎回家"竟是用小樹葉一片一片拼成，好感動。特地瞭解了房間服務員是楊劍英。（見所發照片）。景色也非常好，可以看視頻。到梅地亞有賓至如歸感覺，下次來千島湖還會住梅地亞。
