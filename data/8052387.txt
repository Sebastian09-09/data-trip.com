The room was absolutely fantastic, decorations were very unique and stylish and it had great balcony with splenid views.  The room included an afternoon tea which was delicious and another surprise.  The hotel is on end of West Street which is a great location but you can expect some noise as it's a vibrant area. The hotel arranged many outings for us in the local area at a discount to the usual prices.  I'd really recommend both Yangshou and the Yitian hotel to anyone.

I learned that there are rooms with the same design after communication, but I don't understand why we didn't give priority to them when we came so early. Is it reserved for the lucky ones at the end? Regarding the room, I hope the store can downgrade the rooms with the same design to avoid more tourists being deceived. The second problem is that it is very noisy in the morning, with all kinds of drums and gongs, and the noise pollution is serious. Friends who like quiet should be cautious.

msg:The hotel is right at the entrance of West Street. The traffic in Yangshuo is not as congested as usual. The streets are full of people with electric bicycles, regardless of motor vehicle lanes and non-motor vehicle lanes. It is recommended not to stay on West Street. It is inconvenient to take children away from any attraction, unless the young people go to bars at night. . You can't sleep in the hotel until after 12 o'clock in the evening, because the door is the downtown area, and the high and subwoofers make it impossible to fall asleep. Families with children are recommended to stay near the scenic spot, because it is 3.6 kilometers away. It takes 50 minutes to drive to Impression Liu Sanjie and 10 minutes to get there with a battery car. There is a restaurant downstairs in the hotel and accommodation upstairs. Don’t expect it to be as clean as a star-rated hotel. Maybe a business hotel won’t be able to do that.

It is recommended that the hotel lobby be made into an electric door. When the door is opened, it always feels like there is a lot less class. If the layout, lighting, and fragrance in the lobby are more refined, it will appear more high-end. Add some light music in the lobby, and don't put too many things to make it look like a small hotel, which does not match the class of the guest room.

msg:Recommend this hotel! ! !
[Location]: After all, in the county, if you are not traveling by car, it is recommended to live near West Street, which is convenient for taking a taxi. The hotel is at the entrance of West Street, but the balcony door of the room is relatively thick, and the outside sound cannot be heard at all when it is closed, and it is very soundproof.
*[Traffic]: There are too many people on West Street, so there will be traffic control on several roads at night. Fortunately, the hotel is at the entrance of West Street. We got off the bus and walked a few steps there. If you live in a hotel in West Street, you may have to walk more.
[Room]: The hotel is clean, and the attitude of the staff is very good. What's more considerate is that the few clothes I washed were originally placed on the stool on the balcony. When I came back at night, I found that there was an extra floor-to-ceiling hanger on the balcony, and all the clothes were hung on the hanger. The only suggestion that needs to be improved is the shower head. The shower head cannot be moved up and down.
[Food]: There are many things to eat in West Street. [Master Beer Fish] has many branches in West Street, and there is one in front of the hotel. It is delicious. Those who like to eat snail noodles strongly recommend [Aimin snail noodles] in West Street. It takes 5 minutes to walk and the door opens at 8:30 in the morning. Don't eat the noodles on the street opposite the hotel, one family tastes worse than the other, and you stepped on mine twice. I went in and asked 2 tourists who said it was delicious, so I dared to order it.
[Others]: 1. Do not buy tickets online for Eternal Love! ! ! There are a lot of scalpers at the entrance of the scenic spot, and you can cut it down to 160-180 yuan. There are enough VIP seats, so let them book area A, facing the stage, near the front! Those with children can bring swimsuits, and there are water games inside. Key point: The opening time of the scenic spot is not fixed every day, which is very tricky. We went early and waited for a long time. Based on the time of the first performance, the doors will open about 1 hour earlier.
2. Yulong River rafting tickets are hard to grab. The official account grabs the ticket and enters the payment interface. After entering the verification code, it will always display "loading". Don't worry, don't log out, and be patient. I just have no experience. I quit and re-entered but didn’t get it. In the end, I bought a scalper and added more money.
3. Shili Gallery: Although the sidecars look good in photos, they are not easy to ride, difficult to turn around, and they are not allowed on the road, they can only be driven in trails, and there are still many people riding electric vehicles. If you are tired from playing, there is a coffee shop nearby that you must check in. It is in the middle of the mountain.

If you want to go to bed early, it is recommended not to choose it. The room size is large and the fruit is also very rich. It's just that the equipment is a bit old. I saw a lot of cigarette burns on the bedside table, and there was a circle of black discoloration on the chandelier. You can make tea on the balcony, but pay attention to privacy and remember to wear clothes.

Tell me, do you dare to live there? My partner and I were sleeping, and suddenly someone opened the door in the middle of the night, because my girlfriend did it alone when I asked for the room card. I was not there at the time, could it be your hotel? Do you think my girlfriend is the only one in the room and open the door? My family was scared enough, there was someone decorating next to it in the middle of the night, and the people in the hotel said to them, let our customers themselves
Call the police, they are afraid that others will retaliate and I will be speechless, we will come out
Tourists are not familiar with the place, we stay in your hotel, let us deal with it ourselves if something goes wrong? ? g 4 Then what do I give you the money for? .
In the middle of the night in the summer, the hotel's air conditioner suddenly broke down, and it was said that the whole store jumped
The gates are like this, the power will be cut off every half an hour, and the air conditioner will be shut down
Five minutes, I’m really a **** just for this service. A leader with glasses came down from the hotel, didn’t do anything, walked around and left, let us call the police. 2, are you an official through the back door? The attitude of renting a battery car in the hotel is very serious, 50 yuan a day, 20 yuan for you to ride for a day in other places, he must return it before 9:00, and go out at night in summer. What else should I rent if I give it to you before 9:00? People who don’t rent a hotel still say that you don’t rent a hotel and come here to ask why, I’m really convinced? what attitude?

For a five-star hotel, free parking is the most basic service provided by the hotel. Even in a commercial area, you can also have an agreement with the parking lot. The room fee is more than 600 yuan, and you have to pay an additional parking fee of tens of yuan, otherwise you can’t use it during the day It's ridiculous to drive the car out.

The service efficiency of the room attendants is relatively high, and things can be delivered within 10 minutes after calling.
Environment: The smell of various restaurants on West Street will float to the balcony, and now the balcony has always had a strong smell of snail noodles.

msg:This is the corner of the bathroom! The towels are all off-line and old, too thin to absorb water... The door to the balcony is not soundproof. After the lights are turned off at the door, there will be corridor lights coming in, and as long as there are people walking in the corridor, there will be noise... This is a hotel that is not rated as a star. What's even more ridiculous is that the room given was seriously inconsistent with the picture on Ctrip. The hotel explained that it was a random picture on Ctrip and had nothing to do with the hotel. The usual room rate of 200 is 1600 during holidays. The experience is terrible... The lobby on the first floor is full of smells. I joked with the front desk, and the front desk replied: There is a snail noodle shop on the first floor of the hotel!

Hygiene: There was a long black hair on the bed sheets, which was taken care of by myself.

Service: The service is average. I told the front desk to check out at 14:00, and the reply was at 12:30 at the latest. Didn’t you see the late check-out mentioned earlier on Ctrip? In the end, I had to confirm again and again before giving a late check-out. There are no welcome fruits, and the gifts displayed online are basically just decorations.

msg:The hotel is part of the Yitian West Street commercial building complex. It is just at the entrance of West Street. It is convenient for everything. We go to West Street every night for a walk, and watch the small performances at West Street Square on the balcony at night. You can go to the rice noodle shop across the road to pack rice noodles, porridge, fried dough sticks and eat them back to your room, which is very comfortable. The hardware and decoration of the hotel are enough for the five-star level of the first-tier cities, and the decoration is very cultural. The lobby is very small, I thought it was wrong when I first arrived, but when I went to the guest room corridor and entered the guest room, I felt completely different. The overall style of the hotel is a garden resort style, which is very suitable for the a**osphere of Yangshuo. The hardware facilities in the room are complete and convenient, the beds, quilts and pillows are very comfortable, and the toilet room is independent. The only thing I have to complain about is the lighting in the room. The lighting in the room is not reasonable enough. The lighting in the room is dark, especially the surrounding of the vanity mirror of the washbasin is not enough, but the night light is too bright. The lights are linked, and the wardrobe light will only turn on when the bar light is turned on. In general, I am satisfied with this hotel, and I will choose it again next time. The front desk service is thoughtful.

msg:I made an order for a friend before. Asked if it was okay. I thought it would be nice to try it out, but after checking in, I found that it was completely different from the pictures, and there was no view at all. The hotel said they would upgrade me. The result is no view either. Finally, you asked me to cancel the order? !!!Cheating customers? !!It’s been a tiring day. Want me to find a hotel again? !It’s nothing like the pictures on the Internet. Moreover, before checking in, the hotel also asked questions like a household registration survey. My wife didn't check the details in detail. She even asked about whether she drove a car and ordered a car. The customer service call from the hotel basically meant that they wanted to check the room order in advance and provide better service to the guests. But it's really unprofessional. Also said five-star service. Is this the level of service? It's the same as checking my household registration! I asked about the price of booking a car and booking tickets. But when I arrived at the store, I discovered that their hotel actually has a cooperative travel desk. Checked in too late and already got off work. And when I checked in, I asked the front desk about calling. However, they informed us that they never called the customer to explain whether it was the marketing operations depar**ent or which depar**ent performed the inspection. Tell me how sorry you are. They said that you can ask at the travel counter the next day to book tickets. Then about the price of booking tickets and buses. I asked the tourist there the next morning. It turned out that the price quoted by the travel counter was cheaper than what they quoted. This hotel is really disappointing. And comparing what they said before and after, it seems like they are contradictory. It feels like it's all a lie. Now that I think about it, my friend told me that it was okay. He probably felt embarrassed to tell me the truth. I feel speechless just thinking about it. I obviously wanted to arrange a good hotel for my friend. The result is this

Service: The hotel staff are very friendly.
Activity package: The quality of the Hanfu provided by the package is very good, and the lady in the Hanfu store is also very nice. The scenery of Yangshuo and the Hanfu are so beautiful!

It's really too commercial now, even a review has to be faked
 
Because the whole family is traveling, so they have higher requirements for accommodation. All five-star standard hotels
We are traveling as a family, we booked a duplex room, the attic is stuffy
Hardware: High-end fast hotel standard, water storage in the bathroom shower, bathtub considering hygiene issues and not for the baby
Sanitation: The sanitation in places where you can see it is okay
There is nothing remarkable about other places.
The location is really good. It's just on West Street. We ordered McNair for breakfast. I don't know how it is, but I guess it can't be better. The standard of express hotels, the breakfast is just so-so.
Those who want to stay here, please refer to my suggestion
The price/performance ratio is really not high

I spent 1700 a night staying in a hotel for two nights. That's the attitude. It's still a chain hotel. I really don't know where you got the courage to open a store. I will always complain to your headquarters about this matter.

I observed that there will be two special performances from 8 to 10 in the evening. Lively, very recommended for those who like lively. I read the reviews and said it was noisy. I was a little worried after I checked in and found that it was actually okay. It is okay to close the windows of the hotel and soundproof.

The hotel is right at the entrance of the underground parking lot on West Street, which is easy to see. It takes only 1-2 minutes to walk past West Street. There is a lot of food around, and there are also children to play. The most important thing is hygiene. It's pretty good (I am a little dirty and can't stand hygiene). It is very suitable for a family. Come in size. Next time I have a chance, I will be the first choice. Friends are also recommended (I don’t know about other room types, but our room type is really good. The only drawback is that the location on the second floor is a bit sultry, which may be the reason for the roof, but the hotel is also It is thoughtfully equipped with a fan, and the front desk service is also very good, like one!)

The interior room design is more comfortable. The breakfast is quite varied, but vegetables, especially salads, are relatively few. One thing that affects the experience is that it is too close to West Street, so it will be noisy before 11 o'clock. No matter how good the sound insulation effect is, there is no way to avoid this. People who take a break may need to pay attention.

衞生：房間裏和酒店衞生都還是不錯的。

服務：服務還是比較熱情周到的，房間送了下午茶和水果還是不錯的。
環境：有地下停車場，不過電梯不是直通酒店的，要到地面在去酒店所以行李多的話稍微有點不太方便。因為在西街又是暑期9點之前還是有點吵的雖然住在五層，還好11點以後就不吵了。不過其他更靠近步行街裏面的酒店估計更吵。
步行街晚上真的太火爆了，年輕人也很多。真的值得一去。
整體體驗還是不錯的
