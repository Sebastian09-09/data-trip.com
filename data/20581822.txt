There’s lot of restaurants nearby, it’s close to Ice & Snow festival and Sun Island. There’s also a subway station nearby but we didn’t use it because DiDis and Taxi’s are very cheap, and very convenient. The service at the hotel is great, the staff is very attentive and makes sure that you’re well taken care of. The hotel rooms aren’t massive but they’re okay for that price, the rooms are clean. They offer western and Chinese breakfast which almost the same thing. Overall i would recommend this hotel.

The location is fantastic, just a short walk down the street and you’re in the central street where you can find great shops and restaurants. It’s a convenient walk from St. Sophia’s Cathedral and Zhaolin Park. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I just wish I had a bathtub, but the smart toilet almost made up for that. I realised the first night that my shower wasn’t working properly. In the morning, I simply messaged Song via WeChat, having added her upon checkin and the problem was soon fixed. The breakfast was good, though I would have like a little more variety. All in all, a great place to stay!

The location of the hotel is perfect. It’s very close to the Central street and the former Synagogue. The room was clean, cozy and beautiful. I haven’t tried their breakfast but the coffee from the capsule machine in the room was pretty good.(though they forgot to refill it one day) I kinda felt the cigarette smoke in the morning near the bathroom but it’s probably from the other room. I liked that they prepared welcoming snacks and farewell fruits. It was a sweet touch. Overall, if I can come back to Harbin, I wouldn’t mind staying here again.

msg:I was lucky to choose Junyi Hotel for this trip to Harbin. First of all, the location is very close to Central Street. The Hongzhuan Morning Market, Daoli Vegetable Market, and Sophia Cathedral are very close. You can walk to the Internet celebrity places without walking too far. Not to mention the catering, Western food Tadaosi, Madiel, Huamei, etc., Northeastern food Shanhetun, Laochujia, Laochang Spring Pancakes, I don’t know which one to choose. Secondly, the hardware. Although the hotel is not too big, the room area is quite large. There are not only sofas, tables, but also a cloakroom. The bathroom area is not small, not cramped at all, and the bath water is very strong. The room is also equipped with a capsule coffee machine. The most worth mentioning is the service. I added WeChat before coming here to introduce the attractions and food in Harbin. Before the car stopped, the lady at the door came up enthusiastically and took the initiative to help us take the box. The attitude is the best. There are welcome fruits when checking in, and exquisite souvenirs when leaving. There is a front desk lady wearing glasses who is the most enthusiastic and best. In short, although the hotel is not the most luxurious, it is indeed the most comfortable place I have ever lived. If I come to Harbin again, I will definitely stay here.

Service: I was in transit in Harbin for a day after traveling, and happened to encounter road control. When I took a taxi to the station through the software, no one took the order.
! ! I would like to praise the staff at the hotel entrance (Zhang Zhaohua), a fat boy. I don’t know the exact word, but it should be this name. After understanding our situation, he very patiently guided us on how to take a taxi and how to get to the station as quickly as possible. He took the initiative to go to the side of the road to hail a taxi and got a taxi. He was very, very, very dedicated! ! If the hotel sees this review of mine, please give Zhang Zhaohua a chicken drumstick🍗 to express my gratitude🙏

Moreover, the front desk staff are also very kind. Harbin’s tourism service industry is getting better and better. Longjiang people are really happy!

msg:After staying for three nights, I found some problems, but overall it was not bad. If I have the opportunity to go again, I will continue to choose this hotel to stay!

Location: Next to Central Avenue, it is a 2-3 minute walk. There are parking spaces at the door, but it is not recommended to let the car in, it is easy to get stuck in traffic and it is difficult to turn around.

Environment: The front desk is on the right hand side of the door, which is small. Next to it is the book bar, which is the breakfast dining area. The space is not large, and you need to wait for a seat during the breakfast peak.

Breakfast: It is divided into ordering + buffet. The ordering is divided into Chinese and Western, with two dishes in each category. If it is not enough, you can add more. There are not many types of buffet. The hotel is next to the red brick morning market, so it is okay not to choose hotel breakfast.

Hygiene: It’s okay, but there are "little surprises" in the linens, such as hair, and the coffee cup will also have lipstick marks left by the previous user. Train them well!

Service: The only two comfortable staff members are Lin Jing at the front desk. Every time I see her, she is super enthusiastic, helping to communicate matters, and warm and thoughtful; the other is the fat man with a belly at the door (sorry I forgot his name). Every time I go in and out, this gentleman will greet me very warmly, especially when I go out in the morning. Hearing such a greeting will make me feel very good all day❤️
Other people have service awareness, but they are also generous and straightforward like northerners. They are comfortable to get along with, but they are not very professional in the hotel service industry.

Afternoon tea at the Spring Book Bar for Two: It is available every day. You can go directly to the front desk area to pick it up, and you can also take it to the room to eat.

Junyi souvenirs: You have to go to the front desk to pick it up. If you forget, it will be gone, for example, I forgot.

The hotel is in an excellent location. Turn right and walk 200 meters to Central Street, turn left and walk 200 meters to the Red Brick Market, walk to the subway station within ten minutes, and walk to the church in 15 minutes. As a five-star hotel, it is very cost-effective in such a core area. The room is spacious, the bathroom is particularly large, and the hardware is complete. There is a clothesline in the bathroom, and there is a coffee machine and ironing board at the room bar. The service is the best of the best. There is someone to carry the luggage at the door of the store, and there is guidance and greeting in and out of the elevator. Take out 90 degrees bow to say hello, and the waiter responds to any needs in time, which feels very good. The hotel lobby is not luxurious or too large, but it is warm and comfortable. The afternoon tea in the lobby is from afternoon to after dinner, and guests staying in the hotel can enjoy it at any time, without time limit, quantity limit or number limit. Stayed for three nights, breakfast was slightly adjusted every day. In addition to being able to choose a set of Chinese or Western breakfast, other side dishes, fruits, drinks, and pastries can be self-service. There are also welcome fruits and sleep goodnight milk and pastries. I saw smiling faces when I entered and exited the door, and the experience was great.

Hotel location: Turn right and walk 200 meters to the center of Central Street. Turn left and walk 100 meters to the Hongzhuan Morning Market. It is also very convenient to take a taxi to other attractions.
Service: After staying in so many five-star hotels, Junyi has the most thoughtful service. Every service staff is warm and polite. When waiting for check-in, the waiter first delivers hot towels and hot tea to relieve the fatigue of the journey. The handsome guy delivered the luggage directly to the room and introduced various facilities in detail. My son said, I have nothing to ask. This uncle introduced it too comprehensively. I booked a double breakfast room. After arriving at the hotel, I found that it was too close to the Hongzhuan Morning Market, so I wanted to cancel the hotel breakfast. The hotel actively cooperated with Ctrip to help me with the procedures. Ctrip was also very awesome. The breakfast refund was credited in seconds. Afternoon tea is from 10 am to 10 pm. Although there are not too many varieties, there are freshly ground coffee, hot tea, fruit salad, fruit and biscuits. They can also be delivered to the room. The waiters also pay attention to the status of the guests at any time and provide services in time. We were given exquisitely packaged souvenirs when we checked out. Several waiters kept sending us to the car. The driver who picked us up at the airport said that he thought we were friends with him because of his thoughtfulness. 😁
Room: The room is moderate in size and very clean. There is a small garden downstairs where you can drink tea. The room on the first floor has a small yard.
Dining: The two streets before and after the hotel are restaurants frequented by nearby residents. They are delicious and inexpensive, much better than the restaurants on Central Avenue.

It is next to the Central Street and quiet in the bustling city. They will also help to store cosmetics and put them in a neat manner. A very exquisite small gift was given when checking out.

How to cast the screen on the Internet TV: You can scan the code to cast the screen. Sometimes when the network is not good and the device cannot match, you can directly open the video app and choose KuMeow to cast the screen without scanning the code. This is what I found after three days of research. I share it with friends who like to cast the screen to watch movies in the hotel.

msg:This is the second hotel I stayed in Harbin. I received a call from the hotel staff the day before. When I arrived at the hotel that morning, the staff took the initiative to greet me and helped me take my luggage to the front desk to check in. During my stay, every staff member took the initiative to greet me, which made me feel like a home guest. They also saw me off warmly when I checked out. I really felt the enthusiasm of the people in Northeast China. In addition to the service, I also liked the hotel facilities and breakfast. Thank them very much!

msg:My parents and aunt were going to Changchun to attend a friend's child's wedding, and then went to Harbin a few days in advance. I helped them look at many hotels and finally decided to book Junyi. When I came back and heard what they said, it was really clean and tidy. In addition to the convenient location, the most important thing is that the hotel's service is very good. The hotel staff's attitude is very friendly. It really makes you feel at home. , just like at home, in addition to helping with the luggage, there is another detail. My mother and aunt just finished eating the popsicles at the door, and they didn’t know where to throw the packaging bag. Upon seeing this, the fat uncle at the door immediately came to help them throw away the trash. , and the hotel staff also provided very kind farewell service on the day of departure. The three days I stayed here left a very good impression on my parents and aunts, and they always praised me. They asked me to remember the reviews, but dear hotel friends, I'm sorry, I didn't remember your names, but I will come back next time when I have a chance. When going to Harbin, we will still choose Junyi!

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we were warmly received by the store manager Lin Jing. After checking in, she personally sent us to the room and gave us a warm and comprehensive introduction to the hotel and the surrounding area. Such a warm attitude and meticulous and comprehensive service also gave me a real understanding of the hotel's butler service. The hotel room layout is reasonable and comfortable, clean and tidy, and the bedding and sound insulation are also very good. I look forward to staying there next time.

Not far from the hotel gate is the 1903 Mansion, and it is about 100 to 200 meters away from the Central University. Madiel, Huamei, Laochujia, and Por**an are all within a few minutes' walk. . I especially recommend the Wandashan ice cream without water on Twelve Street. I ate five in two days...

It is a one-stop walk to important scenic spots such as Sophia Church, Central Avenue Main Street, and the Songhua River, meeting the needs of citywalk! The hotel environment and service are also very comfortable and thoughtful! In the rest area on the first floor, there are all kinds of afternoon tea desserts to meet the needs of rest and replenishment. The staff are very friendly and enthusiastic, and they take the initiative to greet and remind me to go up and down the stairs. They are not inferior to five-star hotels at all! (After breakfast that day, the staff watched me enter the elevator and bowed 90 degrees to greet me!) The room is of suitable size and reasonable layout, especially the bathroom is spacious, and the shower room is not a small cubicle like other hotels. The spring price feels great value. As a frequent business traveler, I am very satisfied with this accommodation trip!

I could just walk back to the hotel. If I got up early to go to the morning market, I could just walk there (it only took less than five minutes!). My baby, who doesn’t like getting up early like me, could go back to sleep after going to the morning market. Go back to sleep 😍

Facilities🫶: The air conditioning temperature in the room is suitable and there is a humidifier☺️The most uncomfortable thing about going to the north in winter is that the house is too dry. Every time I go on a business trip for two days, my face will peel for a week. The humidifier is really considerate🥰

Service🫶: The lady at the front desk was very kind. She also helped me carry my luggage and provided a lot of guides to tourist attractions! Then there is afternoon tea available in the hotel lobby, and the seating area is also very spacious. If you don’t stay in the room, you can come down to eat and drink! I was given chocolates when I checked out😍

The Qishi Slate Barbeque opposite is delicious and the price is not expensive. Turn right after exiting the hotel and walk. It takes only two minutes to reach Central Street, which is really nice.

It was my first time to stay in such a bad hotel and the price was still expensive! Even the hair dryer was nowhere to be found, and the bathrobe was stained, discolored, and dirty...

I stayed for four nights, but I didn’t expect to catch up with the peak tourist season in Harbin. As a southerner, I have to go back to the hotel every time I go out for an hour or two. The hotel will have afternoon tea (ginger tea, hot drinks, etc.), which is really friendly to us southerners.
The hotel and the room are very warm, and the equipment in the room is also very good. I will also book Junyi Hotel next time I come to Harbin.

It is very convenient to walk from the hotel to the Flood Control Memorial Tower, the riverside, and Sophia Cathedral. The hotel's services are also very good, including help with luggage, elevator guidance, and afternoon tea service. Wait, the lobby on the first floor provides free tea, fruits, desserts, nuts, etc. You can sit down and enjoy a comfortable time at any time. We especially recommend the white fungus soup. It’s so comfortable to drink a bowl of it in the cold winter; the room is also clean. , equipped with a humidifier, and the bedside tables and bathroom are equipped with wireless sensor light controls. The details are very thoughtful.
In short, the hotel I chose this time exceeded my expectations. I will choose Junyi Hotel again next time I come~

The only suggestion is that there should be a big brother at the door to help carry the luggage. The steps are a bit high and a bit unfriendly to women and children who lack strength.

The overall score is five diamonds and there is nothing wrong with it. Any lack of hardware is more than made up for by location and service. I just have one question: Is it difficult to make the hotel’s big name brand more eye-catching on the wall?

After check-in, we will help you carry your luggage from the door and accompany you to the room. Breakfast is an exquisite set of Chinese and Western options, and tea breaks in the lounge area are available from early in the morning. Late serving!

Environment: The location is on the side branch of Central Street. It is very close to the main road of Li Central Street, but there is still a distance to ensure it is quiet and not noisy. It is also very close to the Hongzhuan Street morning market!

Hygiene: Very clean, tidy and comfortable.

The mattress is very comfortable and the bedding is clean. The breakfast is very attentive, with reasonable combinations, exquisite presentation, and delicious taste. The service is really great. I used to think that services in northern tourist areas were generally not worth expecting, but this one really exceeded the expectations. He greets you with greetings and greets you with a smile, answers all your questions and is super meticulous. He is very warm and thoughtful. There were a lot of people at breakfast and they helped deliver food to the room, which was very attentive. The tent room booked is also equipped with toys, which is suitable for bringing children.

During this period, we dropped the drone on the roof of the bank. The bank asked us to communicate with us after the holiday. The hotel helped us communicate and got it back early the next morning. This public relations ability and service attitude are really nothing to say. Junyi will definitely be my first choice when I come back next year.

Before checking into the hotel, the housekeeper started a WeChat group and sent a very detailed and super useful guide. The decoration and environment of the hotel are quite good, every staff member is very enthusiastic, and fresh fruit (gaga sweet) was prepared in the room.
If the main activities are around Central Street and Sophia Church, living here is quite comfortable!

The overall feeling is very good, great. If I have the opportunity to visit Harbin next time, I will still choose this store.
I would like to make a small suggestion. It is recommended to add an insulating material to the button of the elevator on the third floor. Every time you press it, there will be static electricity.

There's no need to say this about this city view room, as you can see the residential building in Figure 2.

The breakfast is also delicious and is available until ten o'clock at the latest, which satisfies us who like to sleep in.

msg:First impression of staying at this hotel for the first time

Service: The elevator was under maintenance on the day I checked in, so I might need to take the stairs. The room was upgraded for me, which was a very good experience.

Breakfast disadvantages: Breakfast is actually pretty good, divided into Western and Chinese set meals, leaving some very small buffets. If you rush for the early bus in the morning, the food service will be very slow. Moreover, the disadvantage of this seemingly customized service is that the guest time is not controllable. When there are more people, many things are easily lacking, and you can only order one breakfast set. Not as convenient as self-service at all. If you're not full, go out and eat another one. The eating experience is not as good as a fully self-service one. The breakfast time is also unreasonable. Guests who take the early bus cannot have breakfast. The accommodation fee includes breakfast, which will leave a gap.
Hotel environment: It is very close to Central Street and only 12 minutes from Harbin Station. The transportation is quite convenient, but the road there with luggage is very crowded. The basic buildings are still full. There is still a gap between online pictures and real on-site effects. There is a small amount of passing traffic at the hotel entrance, which is a bit noisy. The hotel is still small, there is no swimming pool, and there is only one elevator, so if there is a large flow of people, you still need to wait.

Service attitude: It's commendable, but it doesn't make people feel like there is butler service, which is commendable. But it doesn't feel like it's up to five-star hotel standards. Of course, the price is there and I don't ask for much.

To sum up, I feel average and may not want to stay here. In addition to being closer to Central Street and the morning market. Nothing else. close

While we were away, a treat was brought to our room with a sweet handwritten note. The location is convenient, the metro is not very far away, the pedestrian street is very close, and there are also many different cafes around. The only negative is that the choice for breakfast is small, but you can fill up, plus they bring a dish from the menu. Cozy patio.

They even upgraded the room for old Ctrip members and arranged for someone to deliver it to the room. The room was large and hygienic. The breakfast is semi-buffet style with Chinese and Western styles which is quite good. The hotel also offers afternoon tea. It is only a few steps away from Central Street which is the biggest advantage of the hotel. After checking in and drinking, we found that the TV channels were not available. After communicating with the lobby manager, we installed an Internet set-top box that day, which made us feel more friendly as tourists who wanted to watch TV programs at night. We once again praise the beauties and handsome guys at the front desk, as well as the grandson on the third floor. Waiter, I will stay at this hotel next time.

msg:The location of the hotel 🏨 is really excellent. It is only a 5-minute walk from Central Street and the Red Brick Street morning market. However, the sound insulation effect of the hotel is quite good. You can hardly hear any sound after closing the windows in the room. The hotel is quite close to the residential building opposite, so be sure to close the curtains when changing clothes or something!
Service: I read in the reviews that there will be someone to help with luggage at the hotel, but when we arrived (a little after 2 p.m., which should be the check-in time), there was no service staff at the door of the hotel. Because there is no ramp at the door, only a very high flight of stairs, and the luggage we carry is relatively heavy, it does affect the check-in experience. The little girl at the front desk was very nice and helped us upgrade our room (thank you very much!). After checking in, the staff also brought snacks, fruits and cards. This detail is a plus!
Facilities: The room we stayed in was very spacious and the supporting facilities were quite complete. Advantages ✔ There is a door blocker next to the door of the room. When you open the door, you can only push it open a crack. This is really considerate for girls traveling! The toilet is a smart toilet, and the seat cushion will be warm and very comfortable. The room is also equipped with a capsule coffee machine, which is really a surprise! For those who like to drink coffee, it is much better than providing a small bag of instant coffee! Disadvantages ✘The shower room is really disappointing. First of all, the hand shower 🚿 cannot be fixed at all and can only spray water against the wall. If you use a top spray, the water will be very dispersed and the water flow will be small (maybe the nozzle is blocked or the water pressure is not enough). For girls with long hair, washing your hair once is too strenuous. I strongly recommend improvement! There is also the retractable makeup mirror next to the sink. It has its own halo, which is a plus. However, I don’t know whether it is due to time or poor contact. The mirror in our house only lights up at a certain angle (but this angle is also No one can be illuminated -_-||), I am completely speechless
Overall, the hotel has a strategic location, the service staff are very welcoming, and the rooms are clean and spacious. I hope the hotel can improve the issues raised. It is still worth recommending to friends who are traveling or on business.

1. Location: The location is perfect for traveling. It is right on Central Street, where you can go shopping at any time. It is very convenient to bring your baby to eat, drink and have fun. It is only a ten-minute walk from the Sophia Cathedral, and you will arrive at the hotel after a stroll at night after watching the night view of the church. It is also very close to the Sun Island Ferry.
Second, the hotel environment: Although it is not big, both the lobby and the room environment are very clean, no peculiar smell, suitable for living with children.
Three, service: the biggest advantage is the service, which is definitely a five-star praise. From check-in to check-out, the service is warm, considerate and thoughtful. The child is relatively small, and the front desk was very considerate and asked if there was any need for water for milk powder; the child accidentally spilled mineral water on the bed in the middle of the night, and the room responded very quickly, changing the bed sheet and quilt cover; they also thoughtfully sent fruit after check-out, and sent the luggage to Wait outside the hotel.
In short, whether you are bringing a baby to play or not, this hotel is recommended as the first choice.

I don’t know why such a hotel that is suitable for travel is not shown in the Harbin hotel rankings. I booked this hotel late because all the hotels on the list were booked. I searched for this hotel myself. The hotels on the list are not conveniently located. If you are particularly concerned about location, Junyi is definitely the best choice. Besides, it is also very good in other aspects.

The old man's legs and feet were not good. After waiting for a long time, it was not repaired. In the end, he could only move upstairs slowly.
Hygiene: Hygiene is what I can't stand the most. Fortunately, I always bring a travel sleeping bag when I go out. Because when I made the bed, I found dried blood stains inside the quilt and a large stain around the blood stain. I immediately contacted the front desk and asked the guest room to change it. I got a new quilt and told me it wasn’t blood. I could tell at a glance if it was blood. This incident caused me to be unable to sleep all night. I slept with my child in a sleeping bag all night.

Environment: The location is good. It's very close to Central Street, but not noisy. It's quite quiet outside the private houses when you open the curtains.

Service: The service is pretty good. There is a male manager who speaks very softly. He is very good. He can help solve the basic problems reasonably. He left his coat at the hotel when he left. He contacted me immediately and said he could mail it to me. We went back to get it before we had gone far. Thank you very much.

msg:Strictly speaking, this is not a hotel, it is actually a B&B with some hotel services! Don’t ever be fooled into staying in a hotel like this!
First of all, the hotel is not easy to find. The entrance is very small. You can just walk by without looking carefully. In a video I posted, the hotel is hidden inside. Can you find it? The hotel is located in an old community. Opposite the window is a residential building, very close to it.
I was a little surprised when I entered the hotel. It didn't look like a star hotel, but more like an apar**ent.
Secondly, the water in the bathroom in the bathroom of the room was a bit clogged, and the water was almost overflowing.
Let's talk about the breakfast. It's not at the level of a star hotel. I'm very disappointed. The total space for breakfast and food is only ten square meters. The afternoon tea snacks were also very perfunctory.
The hotel said it specializes in butler service, but I don’t know where the butler is! If you order takeout, no one will deliver it, so you need to go downstairs to get it yourself!
For the price of one thousand yuan, staying in a hotel like this makes me feel indescribable and I feel very cheated.

When you go out of the hotel, turn right and you will find Central Avenue, and then turn left a few steps and you will find Moderne Cold Drink Hall. The location is very good. It is very convenient to go anywhere. It takes only ten minutes to walk to Sophia Church.

It happened to be a birthday in the middle, and I also sent a fruit plate and cake

The service of several lobby managers (I can't remember the name, there seems to be a left manager) is very warm and thoughtful. I like tea, and the hotel provides several large bottles of Nongfu Spring. In the afternoon, the hotel also has a warm afternoon tea time, coffee + nuts + fruit, which is very pleasant. Central Street is 200 meters away, and I used the evening time to visit several time-honored shops. A hotel with a good location makes the spare time after business trips more colorful! give it a like

There are free freshly ground coffee, snacks, candies and fruits in the hotel lobby for guests to enjoy freely. The rest area is clean and tidy, and there is also a back garden where you can drink tea and chat. There is a public laundry room on the floor, which is a very considerate arrangement. The location of the hotel is also quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle. It is a three-minute walk to the Central Mall on Central Street. Overall, it is a very good experience. The only problem is probably not easy to fix, but I would like to mention it: the air outlet of the air conditioner in the room is facing the position of the pillow, which is a bit inappropriate. Everything else is very good, there are pictures and the truth, for the reference of subsequent tourists

msg:The 1.8-meter large bed is an upgraded room type. The room is very small, and the corridor and the room smell like decoration. The water in the shower was not hot last night, and the room we looked at at the beginning of the month was more than 600, and we booked it for 1,500 , the price later increased to 2,000+. The hotel is relatively old, and the experience is really average. The bathroom door cannot be closed, and the shower head is crooked, so you can only wash it by holding it. What's outrageous is that I paid a deposit of 300 when I checked in, but only 184 was refunded when I checked out. I called to ask why the money was deducted, and the reply was that another guest reported our room number and went to have breakfast, and the refund was made after verification. . The only plus point is that the gentleman at the door is very enthusiastic to help with luggage. Everything else is average. It is not as good as other hotels we booked later. The price is more favorable and the room is bigger.

The main reason is that the water temperature is too cold, there is no floor heating or heating in the bathroom, and the bathing water is basically warm water. I have caught a cold, so I would like to suggest some improvements. Everything else is good, and the robot food delivery experience is good.

According to Ctrip's five-diamond standard, there are no problems with the hotel facilities. When you first arrive at the hotel, you feel like this is the hotel? Is it an exaggerated publicity on the Internet? As soon as you enter the hotel, you feel different. The handsome guy at the front desk upgraded the room for free, saying that the room would be bigger and more comfortable. , When checking out, I carefully asked if I had breakfast, thank you (*^_^*)
After entering the room, Nan Nan, the housekeeper, also delivered snacks, which is considerate~ The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, which is very convenient... I think the floor has been treated with anti-slip, which is also very considerate... Breakfast is semi-buffet and ordering, I took pictures, taste Fair, good service
Let me express my feelings: now there are many hotels with good hardware facilities, but software is the magic weapon to retain guests. For Junyi, it belongs to the latter

After deciding to live near Central Avenue, I chose this hotel after comparing it to the "antique Russian-style luxury decoration" hotel on the east side of the same street. As soon as I entered the lobby, I knew I had chosen the right one. It was the color and style I liked. The hotel service was also very good. The front desk upgraded the room type for free, and kindly introduced the hotel's facilities and facilities; all the necessary supplies were delivered to the room as soon as possible .
The fly in the oin**ent is that the drainage pipes in the room seem to have a slightly smaller flow rate as other reviews have said, and there will be a little bit of water when taking a shower (but it won't overflow).
In short, if you want to live in the Central Street area, this hotel is highly recommended.

msg:I chose this treasure hotel during my vacation at the beginning of March. I admire myself~ Very nice! ! On the afternoon of the day of check-in, I tasted delicious afternoon tea, and even sent meals to the room after check-in~~ Awesome! I applied for an upgraded room type, which included a rich Chinese and Western breakfast the next day, which my boyfriend and I really liked. The hotel lobby is not too big, but it is chic and refined everywhere, and the restaurant is beautiful. The staff were very polite and helpful in helping us with our luggage and giving directions. The location of the hotel is just beside the central street, quiet amidst the noise, and the traffic is very convenient. The room is very large, and the sanitary ware is of a very good brand. It is clean. You don't have to worry about sanitation. The experience of staying is very comfortable. After returning to Chengdu for a week, I suddenly remembered the U-shaped pillow I lost, so I hurriedly asked, thank you my little brother Wang Tao for helping me find it and send it back. All in all, it is a hotel that surprised me and I like it very much. It is also the hotel with the best experience in recent years. The price/performance ratio is super high. I must book this hotel again next time I come to Harbin! I have already recommended it to friends who are coming to Harbin in the circle of friends. It is really worth it. In our Chengdu dialect, it is quite comfortable! ! !

msg:I have stayed in many hotels in China, and Junyi's service in the four- and five-star hotels is very impressive, and it truly reflects the service concept of being at home. For example, in the evening we wanted to heat up the food packed at noon. The front desk went to our room and took the lunch box to heat it up and then sent it back with hot milk. Although it was a small matter, the details of actively asking if we needed a lunch box were touching.
When we left, the front desk manager and the welcome uncle also helped us carry our luggage to the taxi at the intersection, thank you very much.
The hotel facilities are very new, the bath water is very large, and the smart toilet is well received. The bed, pillows, and quilt make for a good night's sleep, and I plan to continue staying at this hotel on my return trip.
It is located on Dongfeng Street diagonally opposite Modern Hotel, close to Tongjiang Street, and very close to the morning market on Hongzhuan Street.

Due to my carelessness, I chose the wrong date, and there was no order information on the day after I arrived at the hotel, which made me dizzy. After checking patiently by the handsome guys and beauties at the front desk, first let me not worry, rest on the sofa for a while, then help me cancel the original wrong order, place a new order, and teach me step by step. Commendable 👍. The hotel is very close to Central Street, so it is very convenient for eating, shopping and shopping. In addition, the hotel also provides free afternoon tea. There is a coffee machine in the room, and you can have a drink at any time. I am very satisfied with my stay. I will choose your place next time I come to Harbin. 🤝

The hotel as a whole is exquisite and warm, the environment is clean and tidy, and the butler service should also be a major feature.

From the very beginning, the big brother at the door took the suitcase warmly, to the beautiful manager in the lobby who brought tea and water, and the lady at the front desk checked in quickly. Everything was very comfortable, warm and not embarrassing. , the room has been upgraded for free, and it is strongly recommended that the purchase of a room includes breakfast, which is rich in variety, Chinese and Western options, only 30 yuan per person, don't be too cost-effective~ You must know that it is Central Street! There are also free tea, snacks and books in the lobby on the first floor. If you don’t want to stay in your room, you can take a break here and relax in peace. I didn't take any pictures of the room, the official pictures are true, you can choose the room type by yourself, and if you are lucky, you will also get a free upgrade from the hotel~ Oh, there is a humidifier in the room, which is really meticulous and thoughtful, and every time I go out, I will help you pick it up Things are sent to the room, the wife is so enthusiastic!

Sadly there is no safe and the view from the window is terrible (both residential).
Free afternoon tea in the lobby cafe is available every day, but only a little snack, and the taste of the coffee needs to be improved.
It is a short walk from the hotel to Central Street, which is very convenient for eating and sightseeing.

As a northerner who has lived in the South for many years, he returned to his hometown to play when he retired. It is great to choose to live in Junyi. Junyi and Dagongguan 1903 are separated by no more than 50 meters, and they are both a group. The butler-style service of Junyi is warm, caring and thoughtful. The bedding is very good, comfortable and hygienic. The room is soundproofed and very quiet. Suitable for business and leisure. There is also a public laundry room on the 6th floor. The breakfast is very exquisite, focusing on nutrition, and the combination of Chinese and Western food is perfect. The location of Junyi is very good, but it is only 100 meters to Central Street. If you can get up early to visit the morning market on Red Street, you can experience the city life in the Northeast on the spot. The price-performance ratio is higher. Manager He He provides us with many conveniences, which makes us feel at home. Originally wanted to experience different hotel styles in Harbin, Mohe came back to live here.

msg:Generally speaking, it is still very good to live on your own or you can choose to travel on business because the location is very good in Central Street, but the hotel is in an alley for 500 yuan and a small five-star, so I don’t want to choose anything. After all, the price is here. If the couple recommends not because The hotel has a small facade in the alley

msg:The service of this store is absolutely worth one hundred points!
The service can be comparable to the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the key is the price of the Express Hotel, you can enjoy the five-star service.
From the reception to the door, the uncle who helped with the luggage was very hospitable. My suitcase was relatively heavy. The fat security uncle at the door directly carried me to the street and put it in the car. Thank him very much.
The front desk service also makes people feel at home.
The facilities of the key rooms are very good. They are basically the standard equipment of a five-star hotel. The fully automatic toilets, bathrobes are very comfortable, and the toiletries are also good. A large set, and the rooms are equipped with mineral water from Palmer Springs and a capsule coffee machine. , Even the cup is used by Versace. And the distance of 200 meters from Central Street is very convenient.
I also gave away snacks and fruits. It is a small and exquisite boutique hotel with perfect service. It feels like it can be selected into the SLH Group.
Next time if you come to Harbin, you will stay at this hotel. The hotel name is 300 meters from Central Street and is located in the center of the city. It is very convenient for the hotel to go around 7 days and 1903. I regret that I went to Erlu Jaya Hotel.

msg:This hotel is located next to Central Street, on Dongfeng Road. The transportation is very convenient. First of all, the hotel's service is really impeccable and super good. Whether it is the front desk, the general waiter, or the cleaning waiter, they have a strong sense of initiative, so please say hello when you meet. Secondly, even though it is in an old building, the rooms at the National Chiao Tung University, the interior decoration is tidy and hygienic, and the towels and bedding are new and clean. In particular, it is equipped with a flush toilet and has a good sense of hygiene! Although the foyer is not big and there are full cars parked outside, there are tables and chairs along the street opposite the front desk, where you can sit and drink coffee, tea, etc. It feels like being in Europe. In fact, the hotel provides free afternoon tea. There are also many types of tea and snacks, which are very warm. Finally, I must say that the hotel is very quiet and has a niche taste. If you are on a business trip, talking with friends is great. In short, the manager of the hotel made a small hotel very distinctive. Worth a try.

The hotel has complete facilities. Breakfast semi-self-service is very delicate and not wasted. The hotel is very cost-effective. When you check out, you also sent small gifts, although it is a few chocolates. I recommend this place to friends around Harbin.

環境：房間空間不算特別大，內飾該有的都有，屋內有咖啡機和冰箱蠻方便的

服務：住過的5星裏面應該是最好的，比起佔地超大的國際連鎖還是更喜歡這種小但舒適的體驗，工作人員更容易認識每一位旅客點對點照顧。每次出門和回來都有門衞大哥熱情迎接，睡前還有熱牛奶。接待和離店都是丹丹辦理的，非常熱情的姐姐希望她工作順利！

食物：早餐自取區不算多但可以單點好像每天不一樣。下午茶基本全天供應很喜歡，奶茶很好喝和自己家煮的味道差不多，自動咖啡機也不錯我和朋友每天喝兩杯。還有迎接水果和巧克力伴手禮

好久沒認真寫評價，整體物超所會想再來

周到，有求必應，給我們帶來親切感，感覺好温暖。酒店早餐很不錯，還有温柔的下午茶水果等，酒店在中央大街旁邊，所以很多景點步行就能到
達，附近還有地鐵二號線能直接去太陽島景區，還能換三號線和一號線去其它景點，總之出門很方便。這個酒店值得住宿。感謝攜程平台的推薦，感謝酒店的五星服務，使我們這次哈爾濱之行玩得很開心，不虛此行。

　　酒店雖然𣎴大,但是由门口到大堂,由电梯到走廊，房間的内內外外,都非常整潔乾淨,佈局合理!!
我們沒有订早餐,但酒店送了我们兩日早餐,早餐𣎴只精美,味道也是𣎴容挑剔!!
      我們離開時還送我們俄羅斯曲奇和哈爾濱腸，真的非常喜愛這間酒店！！！
