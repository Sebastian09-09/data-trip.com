The hotel's location is excellent, with convenient transportation, making our travels more convenient. Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay, and we will definitely choose this hotel again next time!

msg:We had an incredible time at the Ocean Sonic Resort. The service we recieved from Tab zeng( nimo)was amazing. He helped us with everything we needed from booking activities, ordering room service (because the room service staff didnt speak English), upgrading our room on arrival and making sure that our stay was fantastic. This was our 6th time at the resort and our best time yet thanks to him.As always the pool is fantastic and the location in regards to the beach is perfect. I do wish that the Ocean Sonic Resort still had staff and lounge chairs on the beach like they did a few years ago. Other than that everything was fantastic. A big thank you to Tab Zeng! We look forward to seeing you on our next trip to Sanya

msg:We had a really lovely stay. Our room was huge and had an amazing view of the sea and city. The pool is really big, so even when it was busy there was still room for us to swim about. The pool is located in the middle all the buildings, so the pools is shady, which is a positive for me because I burn easy. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. 

The only negatives are the breakfast and needing some updated all around. The breakfast is a buffet, but no western options and all the Chinese food was subpar. I won’t pay extra for the breakfast next time. And updates all around, it’s an older location and you can see some things that could be updated. Maybe some paint, replacing a few pieces here and there, etc. But nothing that made our stay negative by any means.

msg:Our stay was very nice overall. The swimming pool is very nice, and children friendly. The waterslides are fun, but they don't allow adults.
Something that needs the management's attention, and supervision, is the problem that the swimming pool staff can't manage to provide clean towels for the guest. They were out of towels every single day, even in the morning when they were supposed to have the towels ready for the start of the day. 
The food at the breakfast is okay, and the room service food is delicious as well.
The beach is right in front of the hotel, and it's beautiful, shallow, and children friendly.
Something very remarkable is that all rooms have huge bathtub, big enough for two adults, with amazing seaview (for the rooms that overview the sea.)
The coconut dream corridor, which goes along the beach line is very pleasant for a walk.
The rooms are a bit old, but overall the hotel is very nice, and the seaview is amazing. 
I highly recommend it!

msg:Thank you Ocean Sonic but we have to say farewell and will not come back. 

We (a family with three children) have been to the Ocean Sonic for the second time. First in 2016 we were really happy with our Family Suite and the overall great services everywhere in the hotel. 

Now we came back after five years because we hoped to have again a good time. The location is still very good but the hotel and its services have aged. The room not in best condition anymore. Furnitures and facilities (especially bathroom) was quite old and doesn’t look good anymore. The hotel gave us this time another room layout with sea view (last time we had garden view over two floors) but the family suite was old. The receptionist could only speak Chinese and at our arrival the counter was overwhelmed by the number of guests which made our checkin quite lengthy. 

The breakfast was in the past a real highlight with a lot of good food and a balanced mixture between international and good Chinese food. Now it focused much more on the Chinese guests (which is reasonable in times with fewer foreign guests) but the quality, variety and services also suffered compared to 2016. Individual food stations have been reduced to a minimum and most food is now pre-cooked. The coffee machine was able to provide also cappuccino but often 2 of 4 coffee machines were broken and the queues for the remaining ones were long. The coffee machine and the buffet in the children breakfast area were not in service.

The Sanya Bay is in my eyes still the best place to go because the beach is great and the waterline isn’t steep. The waves are reasonable high and can be managed well with younger children. Around the  hotel you can find many restaurants but mostly only seafood. After 1 week seafood our children were looking for variety but all other restaurants like good Russian restaurants have shutdown.

Overall, the price and the service is still okay-ish for the Ocean Sonic. But now you can find many good alternatives in the Sanya Bay with good prices as well. We will try one of these during our next winter stay in Sanya.

Service was terrible. We had to remind the staff to change the towels, sometimes they would just take them without replacing. Room service was bad because they forget to take dishes away even when you remind them. Only one person speaks English he was more than helpful. But it is very tiring to communicate this way. I got stung by a jellyfish, when I asked for a doctor they just turned their heads and told me to wait. Just terrible.
Food was great. 
There are two swimming pools, a tea room which was closed etc.
All in all, we expected much more for this amount of money and 5 stars hotel.

Breakfast catered well to us and we are foreigners.

Pool area was lovely with great kids facilities, 2 water slides, an inflatable toy to climb and jump off and various large toys to rent at the pool.  Pool towels provided.

Bubble party in afternoon.
 
Small playroom.

Walking distance to some local restaurants which specialised in seafood but had other dishes. 

Our room was affordable with a living room and a bedroom with 2 large single beds. Small cot was provided for my baby.
My kids slept in the living room as the couch as it was so large.

Excellent value for a family. 

Beach across road was great for families with young kids and they had day beds to lie on and beach toys for my baby. 

Ladies sell fresh fruit while you are on the beach too.

There is a nearby set of shops walking distance if you walk left of hotel about 7 minutes towards the city. You will see some restaurants, turn left and there are more restaurants on the right. Downstairs we found a local air conditioned food court which had ice fruit smoothies served in a bowl. They were delicious!

You can also get these delivered to the hotel. Add a staff member on wechat when you check in and this helps immensely with everything you need. They helped me add someone who spoke English.

The proximity to the beach is incredibly convenient which includes a lift and underpass. Our room was large and comfortable the only annoyance was that the cooker in the kitchen wasn’t functional. Breakfast was always an adventure with a large selection of Chinese and western options.

msg:The Ocean Sonic Resort was one of the worst overnight experiences I’ve endured in many years. Given that my last “hotel” involved sleeping in a tent in the Himalayas with a blanket for a door in subzero temperatures, that’s really saying something. I had seen the deceptively pretty pictures of the Ocean Sonic Resort on Trip.com, and foolishly booked a non-refundable 3-night stay for Christmas. My experience at the Ocean Sonic was so terrible, I was happy to waste thousands of yuan to flee to another hotel, rather than staying there for longer than one night. This hotel threatened to ruin my holiday.

The Ocean Sonic is a run-down facility long overdue for renovation, and chock full of very bad ideas. The room decor is a depressing wood panel more suitable for a 1970s college dorm room. The toilet is shockingly low to the floor, guaranteed to injure a few thigh muscles every time you squat. Want to take a bath? The tub is- and I can’t make this up- on the balcony! And while you bathe, you’ll have plenty of folks staring at you, because the only other views from the “deluxe ocean view” rooms are rusty roofs filled with trash, and an abandoned hotel next door. So your neighbors are far more entertained by your nude body in the tub. Muzak- really BAD Muzak, where the singers mispronounce the words-blasts in the hallway outside your room, 24/7, making it impossible to sleep. This is the only hotel in China where they want to charge you for a (usually complimentary) tea bag. 

The resort’s restaurants are barely open for business, except for breakfast, which is overrun by hordes of shoving pushy guests obviously near starvation. While trying to find food at other times within the resort, I was directed to closed restaurants no less than three times. The indifferent staff didn’t seem to be aware that those businesses weren’t open. At breakfast, my table was outside, in the rain with no umbrella. Luckily, there is a food store on site at the Ocean Sonic, part of a complex billed by the resort as a “Shopping Mall,” even though the only other store in this “mall” is a women’s clothing boutique. There are practically no other dining options in the area; only four identically mediocre seafood restaurants a quarter mile away, where your potential dinner sits in fish tanks staring at you. 

I could go on, but you get the idea. Until somebody gets rid of the rude staff (notable shout out to Haj, the sole hard working employee who seemed to care), and sinks $15-$20 million into upgrading the facilities, the Ocean Sonic Resort should be your LAST RESORT for staying in Sanya. Keep heading down the road and choose from countless other excellent hotels nearer downtown Sanya with better ocean views, superb service, luxurious rooms, and edible food. Want to stay closer to the airport? Try the MGM Grand. When I fled the Ocean Sonic, I chose the JW Marriott. 

Consider yourself warned.

However, if you want to use the kitchen you’ll be disappointed by the lack of equipment. My kids enjoyed the swimming pool with its large inflatables, slides, basketball net and foam party.  One problem is limited sun loungers by the pool and no parasols to provide shade from the sun or shelter from the rain. The breakfast was extremely busy and a hectic experience. Although there were some western options (cereal, toast, pastries, egg station) my kids chose to stick with the rice and noodles as they were more tasty. When it rained, it was a problem that there was no indoor communal space to relax. On the positive side, when we checked out a day early, without me asking them, the hotel contacted Trio.com to refund one night’s fee even though the booking was not cancellable!

msg:I was deeply impressed by the Haiyun Hotel. The facilities here are all available, whether it is the gym, swimming pool or restaurant, I am very satisfied. The Southeast Asian style of the hotel is unique, making me feel like I am in a foreign country. It is extremely convenient to travel, with the Coconut Dream Corridor at the door and many attractions within walking distance. The room is spacious and bright, and the balcony has a wide view, allowing me to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the seaside. The housekeeper Miss Debby Huang's service is warm and thoughtful, and her meticulous care makes me feel very intimate. The swimming pool is large and the water is clear, which is a good place to cool off in summer. The beach lawn opposite the hotel lobby is a great place to take pictures. The overall experience is great!

Surrounded by tropical greenery, the swimming pool is rippling, the children's playground is full of laughter, and the gym is well-equipped.

It is convenient to go to all the attractions in Sanya Bay. The hotel is in Southeast Asian style, comfortable overall, and the breakfast is average but enough. The garden terrace on the 11th floor of the hotel is recommended to check in.

Service: I contacted the hotel in advance and added the housekeeper WeChat, and I was given a free upgrade. Any problems during the period were solved and handled in time. The housekeeping was very careful. When I noticed that the conditioner was not replenished in time, I found that there were fruits left outside and immediately sent welcome fruits. When I checked out, I asked if I wanted to delay the check-out.

In summary, the king of cost-effectiveness in the off-season in May, recommended to stay.

msg:A comfortable and satisfying trip to Sanya! We chose to stay at Haiyun Hotel for off-peak travel. The geographical location is one of its major advantages. It is close to the airport, so you don't have to get up early to catch the plane, and you can sleep comfortably! It is close to the scenic spots, so traveling is worry-free and labor-saving! A few steps to the left from the hotel entrance is the bus stop, which can go to Tianya Haijiao, Xidao, Nanshan Cultural Tourism Zone, Xiaodongtian and other scenic spots, which is very convenient. Go out of the hotel gate and cross the road to the right to take the bus on the opposite side. You can go to the downtown attractions of Sanya and Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. The distance is a bit far. If you don't want to take the bus, you can take a taxi or rent a car, which is also a good choice. Across the road from the hotel is the beach coconut forest coconut dream corridor. It is very nice to take pictures of the sunset in the evening! Our trip happened to be low tide on the first day of the new year. The children dug various hermit crabs in the small holes on the beach, which was very interesting. After the waves receded, they could also pick up large clams and starfish. The weather was hot and the children were playing in the hotel swimming pool and didn't want to get up no matter how much they shouted. Our exclusive butler Xiao Long is very considerate. If you need anything, he will respond to you immediately. I have to praise him for his thoughtful service!

msg:This is my second stay at Haiyun, and I am still very satisfied with it. This is the first time for a family of three to stay at Haiyun in 20 years, and we have experienced Haiyun's excellent and friendly service and comfortable and convenient accommodation environment. This time, the second child is already three years old. She should be very satisfied with the unlimited use of the hotel swimming pool and free pasta every day with her brother. I would like to especially thank the housekeeper Miss Huang for her meticulous care. Not only Miss Huang, but also the front desk, concierge, room hygiene service and other hotel staff in every link make guests feel the hotel's caring attitude. Let me talk about areas for improvement. This time I feel that the hotel facilities are outdated. For example, the room should have multiple charging ports, the sofa cushions and pillowcases should be replaced frequently, otherwise the hot and humid environment is prone to produce odors, and the bathroom door is poorly sealed. After asking Miss Huang, the hotel is already undergoing planned renovations. 👍The dinner experience was not good. I ate at a Chinese restaurant once. The price was a little high, and the taste was not as amazing as the first time. It may also be that the dishes ordered were not to my liking. The buffet items need to be enriched. I always have to have better requirements for the second time. 😂The hotel happened to hold a wedding on the day of the return trip. I escaped from the swimming pool and went to the lawn to catch a wedding ceremony with a familiar northern accent. The a**osphere was very sweet and warm, especially the groom's father, who spoke a warm and generous blessing and thanks in a northern accent. 👍I haven't stayed in too many hotels in Sanya, so I dare not compare them horizontally, but the price-performance ratio of Haiyun should be impeccable.

He can help with many small problems when bringing children to the west. He will take the initiative to ask if he needs any help. Haiyun Hotel is really amazing. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with excellent views. Each window is like a carefully selected picture frame, which takes in the beautiful scenery. The location is excellent, which is extremely convenient for both business travel and leisure vacation. There are rich breakfast choices, and it is particularly worth mentioning that there are also special children's meals, which are very considerate. The most gratifying thing is that the beach is opposite the hotel, close to the seaside, and every step out of the hotel can embrace the waves. The platform on the 11th floor is a holy place for taking pictures, and every frame is a blockbuster. Special thanks to Debby Huang, whose service attitude is warm and thoughtful, and he answers all questions, which makes people feel warm. In addition, the surrounding supporting facilities are complete and meet all needs. Haiyun Hotel is really worth recommending!

The view from the room is so good!! The front is the sea view of Sanya Bay, and the scenery is amazing when you take pictures... This hotel also has a small open-air garden. From the small garden, you can see the whole sea view of Sanya Bay. It's amazing! In addition to the hotel, you can directly go through the underground passage to the Coconut Dream Corridor!
The hotel room is also very clean. I would like to especially praise Chen Yueguo from the housekeeping depar**ent. My family accidentally left their insoles on the balcony of the hotel when they left the hotel... Although it was not an important item, my family needed this insole very much. Later, I suggested the housekeeping depar**ent. Chen Yueguo was very responsible and helped to send it by SF Express. It arrived at the hotel where we stayed the next morning! I was so touched. Although it was a small item, I could feel the seriousness, responsibility, honesty and trustworthiness of the hotel staff. I was very touched and left a very good impression on the trip to Sanya!
My family said they would stay here again next time. They were very satisfied! Recommended! !

The beach is 500 meters outside the hotel through the underground passage. The sand is very suitable for parent-child activities. The only drawback is that you have to get the takeaway outside the hotel entrance, which is quite far away. Secondly, the hotel is clean. The towels at least look good and are cleaned every time. The downside is that the daily cleaning and replenishment items are not complete, such as mineral water, tea bags, children's slippers and bath towels. Finally, the front desk service is very good. They will take your luggage and deliver it to your room. After you leave the hotel, they will call and text you to ask about you. This is very heartwarming.

msg:The flight was delayed twice that day. We were supposed to arrive at the hotel at 5 o'clock, but we didn't arrive until after 10 o'clock. The whole family was exhausted. When we arrived at the hotel, we asked if there was any food. We were told that they would not cook anything after 10 o'clock. We had no choice but to order takeout. The power went out less than five minutes after we entered the room. After waiting for the technician to come and repair it for more than ten minutes, we were told that it could not be repaired. Then no one paid attention to me. I called the front desk and was told to go to the front desk to get the room card and change the room. I was furious at the time. The whole family worked hard for half a day and should have rested at the hotel. As a result, we waited outside the room for another half an hour in such hot weather. The child was so tired that he could only lie on the sofa outside the lobby. This made me, as a father, feel deeply guilty for not booking a good hotel. Later, we moved to the retest room downstairs, but the air conditioning was not strong, and it was too late to open it. When we called the staff, they could only helplessly say that the air conditioning facilities were old and broken, and they were powerless. I didn't sleep well all night. I tossed and turned, fell asleep in a daze, and woke up from the heat. When I woke up, my pillow was wet. I immediately changed to the Pullman Hotel next door after breakfast the next morning.

msg:Haiyun Resort Hotel is definitely a holiday paradise in my mind. The hotel facilities are first-class, from comfortable beds to modern bathrooms, every detail reflects quality. What surprised me most is that each room has a balcony. Standing on the balcony, you can see the boundless sea, and the broad view makes people feel relaxed and happy. The hotel lobby faces the sea, and you can feel the comfort of the sea breeze every time you enter and exit. The service of housekeeper Debby Huang is impeccable, warm and thoughtful. Whether it is travel consultation or daily trivia, she can answer one by one, making me feel the warmth of home. The hotel is very close to the airport, only about 15 minutes away. Nearby attractions include Tianya Haijiao, Xidao, Nanshan, Daxiaodongtian, etc.

What satisfies me most is that each room is equipped with a balcony, so that I can enjoy the charming sea view every morning when I wake up, as if I am in a beautiful painting. In addition, the hotel's housekeeper, Miss Debby Huang, is warm and thoughtful. Whether answering questions or providing help, she always smiles, which makes me feel very warm. The hotel's swimming pool design is also very good. The clear water quality makes people feel refreshed. There are also slides specially designed for children, so that children can also enjoy the water fun. It is particularly worth mentioning that the garden on the 11th floor is an excellent viewing spot. Not only can you see the magnificent sea view, but also feel the tranquil a**osphere. Moreover, the hotel is close to the beach and the airport, and it is very convenient to travel. In general, the Ocean Sonic Resort Hotel is a highlight of my trip, and I strongly recommend it to everyone.

msg:Without exaggeration or criticism, advantages: 1. It is close to the beach and convenient; 2. The environment of the old five-star hotel is still good, the price is reasonable, and the duplex suite booked by the family has a large space; 3. The butler service Xiaolong is good, the service is warm, and the shortage is quickly replenished. He also introduced restaurants and entertainment projects with good cost performance. 4. The children's playground and swimming pool are OK.
Disadvantages: 1. The facilities are too old. For those who pay attention to the quality of the stay, it is not recommended to consider it. The cost performance is OK for a family with children and the elderly; 2. Except for the butler Xiaolong, the attitude of other waiters is average, and there is no smile, especially in the breakfast room. Every waiter has a bitter and vengeful expression, and the food is average, and the dining experience is extremely poor; 3. The room is too old, the air conditioning cooling effect is average, many wooden boards have warped, and there are geckos on the air outlet of the air conditioner.
Overall, it is enough to stay once

1. The location is in the Coconut Dream Corridor, right next to Guoguang, with few people and quiet; there are not many shops around for shopping, but you can get takeout, which is quite convenient;
2. The hotel public area facilities are good, there is a children's swimming pool, which is constant temperature and also suitable for the elderly; the breakfast is rich and long;
3. The facilities in the room are old, especially the toilet and bathing area, the facilities are too old;
4. In terms of personnel, the front desk is very good, and all questions are answered by phone. It's just a bit strange. Others' comments have housekeepers adding WeChat, but we don't have any housekeeper contact, so we can only call the front desk if we have any questions, which is a bad review.

5. Don't buy things from the supermarket in the hotel. The price is too different from that outside. Especially cigarettes

msg:It was quite a surprise when I checked in. I was upgraded to a sea view room. I went for a walk at Coconut Dream Corridor at sunset that afternoon, which was very convenient.
It was also very convenient to sign up for a group pick-up at the scenic spot the next day. When I came back, I passed by a Shaxian restaurant and unexpectedly it became my mother’s most satisfying meal.
When I returned to the hotel, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had changed the pillows and left me a message. Thank you to the waiter for his attentiveness. In fact, I simply don’t like sleeping on pillows and can only sleep on very low curved latex pillows.
Before leaving, I found a treasure corner and spent the most pleasant half-hour of the day with my mother. Sitting on the sofa and enjoying the gentle breeze, I felt full of vacation.
Finally, thank you Xiao Zeng. The service was very good. He helped carry the suitcase and gave me a small gift. My mother was very happy and said she would take it home as a souvenir of her stay in this hotel.

msg:Facilities: The facilities and furniture are definitely a bit old, which is a common problem in Sanya Bay hotels. But it was very clean. The room is super big, with a living room and kitchen, and both rooms have balconies. The living room has the best view. The elderly at home are very satisfied.

Cleanliness: Very clean. I'm a germophobe, so I wiped it everywhere with an alcohol-wet paper and it didn't get dirty. Very good.

Environment: On the beach, opposite Internet celebrity attractions. I really like the balcony view, it's very comfortable. I'm afraid of the sun, so I spend most of my time on the balcony watching the sea. There were no bugs in the room. I read reviews on other hotels about betel worms and mosquitoes, but there were very few in their hotel. I saw people spraying pesticides on the flowers every day to kill insects. This is great!

Service: We have a dedicated butler, Xiao Huang, who is really warm and nice. She responds to information at any time and responds to requests. She will broadcast weather conditions and travel recommendations every day. Sister Li who cleans the room is also very warm and gentle, and she cleans very meticulously and cleanly.

Breakfast: Super awesome. There are mutton, beef, offal and beef brisket soup, chicken feet and denim ribs, various fruits and DIY refreshing and tonic, Baoluo powder, Hainan powder and sour powder. It makes you think of being in Hainan. After breakfast, you can look at the surrounding food. The store just feels so so. It was a pity that three people bought four breakfasts and could not return one breakfast.

Disadvantages: Their fish therapy pool is not good. The pool is a bit dirty. My feet were swollen after the fish therapy. Hope the fish spa pool can be cleaned well.

The children had a great time playing. It’s so friendly to children. It’s not like this in other hotels. There is no constant temperature swimming pool in January.

I regret not booking an extra night. The room is very clean and there are no mosquitoes.

It is convenient and comfortable to live in a suite, because the air conditioner outside the room makes noise. After the front desk said it, we were upgraded. It became a room with three bedrooms, one living room and two bathrooms with a full sea view, which surprised our whole family. This room is super big, suitable for three families to live together, and there is also a super large balcony. It is really amazing, bigger than the one we stayed in later. Donghai’s Silver

I remember that when we first arrived at the hotel, a boy helped us check in. The hotel room was not ready yet, and he told us that we had to wait before we could get into the room. But later, when the boy was copying our IDs, he came We had a very enthusiastic female staff - Debby helper. She also asked other colleagues to help us take our suitcases to the room and arranged for cleaning as soon as possible. She also posts food information near the hotel on WeChat and posts the temperature of the day every day. If you ask me anything on WeChat, she will reply quickly. On the last day, my family and I had to go out on the yacht early in the morning and wanted to refresh ourselves when we came back. She would also help us delay our check-out time.
Hygiene aspect is very good, no horrible insects. However, there was a bit of a strange smell when I first checked in. The air conditioner went away after a while, but the smell in the bathroom was also a bit strong. I originally wanted to give it 4 stars, but the enthusiastic help of the staff made me embarrassed to give it 4 stars. 🙈
The swimming pool is very big, maybe there are not enough people, it is not very clean, there are fallen leaves on the water. But there are many places to sit or lie down comfortably by the pool or throughout the hotel! I sat on the beach chair by the pool and fell asleep without realizing it.
The hotel includes breakfast, which is buffet style and the food is delicious.
In addition, the hotel is less than half an hour away from Tianya Yiheng Themed Night Market. The beach is right in front of the hotel! Just go out and cross the street and you'll be there!

From the moment we got off the bus, we enjoyed five-star trea**ent. The hotel facilities are relatively complete, and the children I also had a lot of fun. There is a beach opposite, which is very convenient. Haiyun Resort Hotel left a very good impression on me. I would like the hotel 👍 and the housekeeper Xiao Zeng 👍

From before check-in to check-out, he provides enthusiastic service throughout the entire process and thoughtfully prepares the bed rail for Xiaobao. Helping to upgrade the room type is really touching when Sanya is so busy with work during the peak tourist season. The breakfast is rich and delicious, and the balcony has beautiful scenery. As an old five-star hotel, the facilities are slightly outdated and the room hygiene needs to be improved.

msg:What happened to northern frozen pears in Sanya
On January 14, 2024, Ms. Chen invited her best friend Ms. Zhu to book a vacation plan through Ctrip, and stayed at the Haiyun Resort Hotel, No. 168, Sanyawan Road, Sanya City, Hainan Province for a whole night at 18:00, in Room 61042, Building 2. When I called at 21 o'clock, I first thought it was a mosquito bite. After 22 o'clock, my whole body ached and itched. In the second half of the night, my whole body was red and swollen. I didn't know if it was fleas, bed bugs, or infectious diseases of the heart and blood. I couldn't sleep all night. When I got up and checked, I found a lot of black bugs on the quilt and a lot of blood stains on the quilt. I didn't sleep for a whole night. In addition to causing harm to my body, I was extremely frightened and had a shadow in my heart. We communicated with the hotel in a timely manner the next morning. The hotel's solution was to report it to the leadership. From 9 a.m. to nearly 4 p.m., it has been delayed and not dealt with, leaving us in an extreme panic. The red spots all over our body became more and more serious. It's getting more and more itchy, but the hotel still doesn't have a sincere attitude, and no responsible hotel leader has come forward to solve it! They did not put the lives of the guests staying in the hotel as the first priority and did not take us to see a doctor as soon as possible. After we complained to 12315, the hotel sent a relevant person from the health center to try some oin**ent. Is it possible to apply oin**ent all over the body in such a hot weather of 25 degrees above zero? How to wear clothes on the body? Is it possible to apply oin**ent on all clothes? Take medicine? Is this a professional doctor’s solution? I was bitten by a snake and needed infusion and injection. My whole body was red, swollen and had red spots? Is this the solution? We were extremely disappointed with the hotel's attitude. Why did Ctrip give the hotel a high score of 4.7? Is it facility services? The facilities are old and dilapidated, the floors are cracked, and the bathrooms are hairy. Is the service good? The room phone service doesn't work well and I can't make any calls! I don’t know whether the guests were infected by unknown bedbugs or jumping oysters, but no one asked. I called the mayor’s hotline and the person in charge of cultural tourism only replied that they were coordinating, but there was no answer. Doesn’t Sanya rely on the development of tourism to boost local income? I can't understand the attitude of the mayor and every northerner in Harbin, the northeastern city, to watch ice lanterns and play in the snow. I think the people of Sanya should 100% agree! ?

In short, the hotel is very suitable for the elderly and children. It is recommended to choose a family suite for a better experience!

The staff at the Bay Hotel are very patient, meticulous, and responsible. They are polite and courteous. The breakfast has a wide variety and tastes good. The set meal includes a complimentary buffet hot pot dinner, which is also good. There is also a dedicated chef to help with the fresh baking. Later, they gave me a freshly baked portion. It was a pity. I don’t think I can finish the meal, so I didn’t ask for it. The hotel is very popular and there are many people staying there. I hope the hotel can maintain its service as always. The only regret is that I didn’t have time to enjoy the hotel’s free photography service this time.

I also got a lot of benefits, including a 3-hour yacht trip to Sanya Bay, fish therapy, and afternoon tea and coffee. The balcony of Building 2 faces the east of Sanya Bay, where you can watch the sunrise while brushing your teeth. Downstairs is the famous Coconut Wind Corridor, watching the sunset is great!

The butler Xiao Huang's service is very enthusiastic and the environment is good. But the weather is not beautiful and it rains all the time. Otherwise, the view It will be even more beautiful.

It is really great for me to take my children to catch a flight. Choosing Haiyun Hotel is the right choice. I was a little confused when booking.

The greening of the park is very good, and the air quality on the beach is very good. The room was large and clean. The room service staff provided very good service.

msg:I ordered it for a friend and asked her how it was, and the reply was "pretty good". I lived in a two-bedroom apar**ent with a full sea view, and I was very envious when I went to see her room. The advantage is that the floors are much higher than mine, they are on the ninth floor, and they look newer than mine. The bathroom on the second floor is super large and luxurious. If you have children, your children will like this duplex very much. I just feel that the living room and balcony are not as big as mine, the stairs are a bit narrow, and the study is useless.

I think you can choose a duplex with children. If you have elderly people, it is better to have a full sea view. I heard that the hotel is also renovating the rooms one after another. I hope that next time I come, the two bedrooms and one living room with full sea view will be more perfect.

I like the location of Haiyun very much. It is down-to-earth but not too noisy. There is a pharmacy store just outside the door. There is an old Sichuan restaurant at a traffic light. The stir-fried vegetables and seafood are affordable and affordable. There is also a treasure fried ice shop, which is full of milk and Made from fruit, without adding a drop of water. Takeaway is convenient, and there is an underground passage across the sea. I have stayed here twice and I would like to stay here again next time I come.

msg:It was the first time for my family to travel to Sanya. After reading many hotel reviews, I finally chose Haiyun Hotel to stay for 4 nights. I don't want to change hotels and move luggage around, so it is very convenient to go out to public sites and eat. Xiao Yan, the hotel housekeeper, added WeChat one day in advance and arranged the room for us. The one-to-one housekeeping service is very convenient. The big room for a family of three has a big bed, and there are two very big beds in the living room. There is a big pool on the balcony outside where you can take a bath. This one bedroom and one living room can actually accommodate couples and 2 children. The room type is really good, and you can also bring an elderly person. No problem for 4 people. The room is clean and tidy, the air conditioner is central, and it is very quiet to sleep at night, which is super good. The staff in the hotel lobby and the little brother who sent us to the room were very enthusiastic. I couldn't finish the 8 bottles of mineral water in the guest room in one day. The guest room was cleaned well every day. I asked the cleaners not to make our beds every day. They only needed to sort out the garbage and add some supplies. It really made me pay attention to the service. Overall I feel like a very good hotel. The hotel has a swimming pool, and the water is not cold but warm. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast buffet in the hotel is good. There are new varieties every day. There are so many things that you can eat for 4 days without repeating it. If you need to leave the hotel on the last day, you can discuss with the housekeeper to check out later. I think it is the off-season, so I applied. Just a moment, otherwise I won't open my mouth, so my luggage doesn't have to be left at the door, but can be placed in the room. It's really great. I will come to this hotel again in the future. It's a very comfortable place to live, no mosquitoes, a good hotel if you sleep well and eat well [naughty]
There are also travel photos sent by the hotel, there are 5 free photos, which is pretty good, everyone can take photos for free

There are local special tourist spots nearby, and there are also good food at check-in places, etc. The facilities in the room are similar to the hotel we stayed in Vietnam It is very similar, and it is also a tropical rainforest environment, very comfortable. One of the reasons for staying here is that it is relatively close to the airport and only a road away from the beach. It is relatively safe and convenient. You can reach the seaside by passing through the hotel's swimming pool and large lawn through the underground passage. Xiao Huang's service attitude is very warm and friendly. The hotel's breakfast is very good, with many varieties. The key point is that there is a children's restaurant. There are many foods that children love to eat in the restaurant. There are also many items for children to play in the Children's Paradise. The swimming pool is very large, and the children have a great time playing in the bubble bath every day. During the stay at the hotel, we encountered some minor problems. Manager Li Yang contacted us in time and quickly helped to solve them. I am very satisfied. The overall check-in experience is good!

msg:Stayed for 12 consecutive days, overall it was good. As an old Hainanese, I chose this old five-star restaurant that opened in 2009 when I went home to visit relatives.
Things I hope to improve: 1. The breakfast in the hotel will be cheaper. There is no need to charge 120 yuan per person for breakfast when staying in a large suite; 2. Takeaway is not allowed in the building. Everyone has to go to the takeout counter at the door and walk a mile to get it. ; 3. The outdoor swimming pool needs to be renovated, it is said to be 1.4 meters, but the water is actually only about 1 meter deep. Adults cannot swim in the water, and the water quality is not very good, so the water needs to be changed in time; 4. The air conditioning needs to be improved, and the refrigeration The effect is good, but the noise is very loud at night, which affects sleep a bit.
The service attitude is very good, and I still give it five stars.

The hotel covers a large area and has a good green environment. There is a swimming pool behind the lobby and two The hot spring is a good choice for relaxing after traveling. There are many breakfast options, which is especially suitable for living here with children. The hotel has an underground passage leading to the sea (personally I feel it is more convenient to walk up) and has direct access to the beach. The only drawback is the wardrobe light card slot It's deformed, it's grown up, it affects sleep quality, but everything else is fine!

Hygiene: I come to clean up the garbage and clean the room every day, and I feel better when I come back at night.
Environment: The overall room is quite big, and the sea view room is really beautiful. It is very close to the beach of Sanya Bay, just across the road. There are also some seafood restaurants on the right side of the hotel that taste good. If you are afraid of ripping off customers, you can also navigate to the Little Dolphin Seafood Restaurant not far from the hotel.
Service: When we arrived at the hotel, the waiter immediately came to help with the luggage, guided the check-in, and then took the luggage to the room. The service attitude was very good.
Summary: The price/performance ratio is very high, not as bad as it is said on the Internet. The facilities in the room look old, but they are passable. If you are not going to Yalong Bay, you must continue to live here. The first stop of the trip to Sanya is a very good experience.

It is very suitable for families to bring children, bring the elderly to play, come to experience and vacation. The hotel's overall swimming pool is a Southeast Asian tropical rainforest-style hotel, which is very beautiful. Let's talk about our breakfast. There are nearly a hundred kinds of food to choose from. You can taste Chinese food, hot pot, Sichuan cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, and Qiong cuisine. For the dinner of the four famous dishes in Hainan, there is hot pot with dross, seafood buffet and barbecue at Fisherman's Wharf on the 2nd building. The price is very affordable and very delicious.

The cleanliness of the room is quite satisfactory. The home appliances are relatively old, and the living room is nice. It is very big and spacious. There is no washlet in the bathroom, and our family, who are used to using washlets, don't like it very much.
The hotel service staff are basically locals. The service attitude is acceptable, but the movement is very slow, and it feels like you have not had enough food and are weak in doing things. This may be related to the slow-paced life in the local area.
The hotel facilities are good, there is a big swimming pool on the first floor, and the children had a great time.
There are many night market stalls around for easy eating, and the prices are moderate and not too expensive.
Convenient transportation, two words to describe "chaos". I rented a car for family trips, so I always drive when I go out. There are many, many electric motorcycles and tricycles on the road, and the lanes and motor vehicles are particularly unsafe, and pedestrians cross indiscriminately. The roads are common, and the traffic lights are basically useless. It is very unsafe for drivers to be nervous.
Finally, the scenery of Hainan is very beautiful, the golden coastline is very beautiful, the air is very good, there are many hotels, it is a city suitable for tourism. The food is so-so, the coconut chicken is not tasty and too sweet, the seafood is expensive, Hainanese are very polite, people who like a slow-paced life can live here.

When I first entered the hotel, I heard the front desk clerk say The location is not too busy today, we came to find her to check in and troubled her, and then the toilet in the room could not be flushed for a long time, the shower head was scattered like fireworks, the walls were cracked and deformed, and the refrigerator was dirty Xi, the mirror is full of marks, the curtains can’t be drawn, the gauze curtains are all snagged and wrinkled, the free fish spa is just a large pool with no one in charge, there is a problem with the arrangement of the CS session, I can’t make an appoin**ent at all, give it away There are only two shuttle buses a day for airport service. It’s not the right time at all, and it’s too late to fly. The service attitude is very bad. The hotel should be converted from an apar**ent. It’s actually divided into units. It’s hard to find upstairs like a maze. There are very few breakfast options Not tasty either. In short, the service is very poor, the environment is very poor, the experience is very average, and I will not come again.

It is very convenient to travel. It is only a 15-minute drive to the airport. It is very convenient and close to Nanshan Temple at the ends of the earth. It is very cost-effective and recommended

The balcony outside is very large, with a large pool and a good view. It is suitable for family travel. Children can play on the balcony, adults can Lying on the side to rest, the price is still affordable
Disadvantages: The hotel staff added WeChat on the first day. After arriving at the airport, they asked a few questions and never responded until I checked out. Then they said that there was a small gift to pick up after checking out, but I had already gone to the airport. It should be customer service "too busy". The room facilities are a bit old, and the room smells a bit musty. One of the three rooms is made of hard tatami mats. If you mind, be careful. The breakfast is quite satisfactory. There is a large terrace below the 12th floor that blocks part of the view and there is a dining bar. Fortunately, there are few people going there, and the privacy of this room type on this floor is average.
Overall evaluation: Affordable, the room is suitable for a family, especially children, and be cautious about sleep requirements!

msg:Let me talk about the Haiyun Hotel that surprised me during this trip to Sanya. Because the view of the Coconut Dream Corridor in front of Haiyun is the best, I took my children to live in this hotel, and it turned out to be quite pleasantly surprised. The deluxe one-bedroom, one-living room twin-bed room with sea view is just right for us two. The price is only a fraction of that of Tianyu in the back, and the price/performance ratio feels really high. The kids love the swimming pool and water slide inside the hotel. Tools for digging sand can also be borrowed from the hotel. There are many types of breakfast in the hotel. Hainan's characteristic Baoluo powder, Lingshui acid powder, and Qingbuliang can all be eaten in the hotel's breakfast. We have takeaway for lunch and dinner, which is also very convenient.
The Coconut Dream Corridor is just outside the hotel. Unfortunately, it has been cloudy for the past few days, and the scenery is a bit poor, but for the children who only want to dig the sand, it is very comfortable without the scorching sun. The sea water in Sanya Bay is not as good as Yalong Bay, but the sunset is really beautiful. Finally, let’s talk about the service. I was really surprised. I didn’t expect the service to be so good. The manager Yang Zheng is very dedicated and I feel full of sincerity. Praise.

Everyone knows that Sanya will still get a little sun in the noon or afternoon. Haiyun specially built an underground passage, which is not only sun-proof, safe, but also directly accessible to the beach. If you look at the whole Sanya, Haiyun is also there.
The surrounding facilities are complete. Everyone knows that Sanya Bay is a very suitable bay area for long-term stays. Not only are the prices of the hotel much cheaper, but it is also very convenient for eating, supermarkets, and sightseeing spots.
Not to mention the service. Big-name hotels must have their special features. The manager Yang Zheng helped us check in when we arrived, and patiently explained some problems to us. If you have any questions, just ask him. It is also very suitable for families with children. Haiyun has a special children's restaurant, children's club and various indoor and outdoor entertainment activities. There are live CS, handmade DIY, ocean balls, water super slides, swimming pool entertainment facilities, etc., which are favorites of babies.

The nearby tourist attractions are very close, travel is very convenient and the hotel parking is free. There are many food streets near the hotel where you can taste local specialties.

The lobby and main entrance of the hotel are relatively grand, just like a Thai vacation. At the entrance of the hotel, there are security guards who come to open the door and help with the luggage. This is very good. After entering the lobby area, the manager Yang Zheng guides you to the front desk to help you check in. He is very considerate. Afterwards, if you have any problems, you can find him and solve them in time. The room is relatively good Big, you can see the sea. There is a kitchen refrigerator in the room. It is ok for parents and children to process seafood by themselves. There are cribs, small tents, and toys. There is a large swimming pool downstairs that children will like more, and there is a gym on the first floor. In addition, I suggest that if you want to book this hotel, you can book breakfast included, because Sanya is really too hot recently, and the sun is very strong after 7 o'clock in the morning. There are relatively few people eating on the Coconut Dream Corridor, so I sleep until 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning Going to the cafeteria to have a leisurely breakfast is also a good choice.

It was past ten o'clock in the evening at the airport, and it took ten minutes to get to the hotel by taxi, which was very convenient.

Here you can have a panoramic view of the invincible Sanya Bay sea view. The gradient layering is true. Portraying, the evening sunset is beautiful enough to fascinate me. The size of the room is large enough. I like the design of the dressing table the most. The oversized balcony overlooks the sea view of Sanya Bay. There is an oversized bathtub on each balcony, whether it is early morning or late at night, soaking in the bathtub , looking at the invincible sea view, blowing the sea breeze, listening to the sound of the waves, this is the longing for vacation life.

msg:The first time I met Haiyun in 13 years, it was like falling in love at first sight at first sight. I have been here five times in ten years, and the first four times I felt very good. The meeting after this epidemic is a little regretful.
Let me talk about the advantages first: the service is very good. When I arrive at the store, a little brother will take the luggage and lead it to the room. Check in was quick. When checking out, sister Xiao Huang directly helped to refund, without waiting for my brother to send it to the car.
The location of the hotel is very good, there are many types of rooms, the attic double room is arranged on the ninth floor, it feels great to lie on the bed and watch the sea in a daze, and now I feel that the sea in Sanya Bay is not inferior to Yalong Bay, see the picture, no approval.
The breakfast is very rich, the best among several hotels. There are changes in two days. There are also children's meals and ice cream balls. All people, young and old, have a great time eating.
The regrets are as follows: The supporting facilities of the hotel are basically the same as ten years ago. Ten years ago, I think the facilities are very good. There is also a bathtub on the balcony. It is very pleasant to take a bath while watching the sea. But after ten years, especially the three-year epidemic, the hotel is not willing to replace the old facilities. For example, some of the shower doors in the bathroom can no longer be closed. There is a layer of water on the bathroom floor after taking a shower, and the sliding door on the balcony The rollers below were broken, the doors wouldn't move, the woven chairs were in dilapidated condition, and some small items were loose. Just imagine how your hotel staff would feel if they saw the supporting facilities in other hotels? !
Other hotels seldom say so much. They have feelings for Haiyun, so they just babble. I hope you will get better and better!

You can also rent an electric car and ride around Sanya city. The sea breeze is very comfortable! The terrace on the 11th floor overlooks the sea view is super beautiful! Like the housekeeper Xiao Huangmei, who took the initiative to help us upgrade the room type, handle early check-in and late check-out. Overall very satisfied! ! !

He told us that we had children and prepared the children's products for us. He even borrowed a baby stroller for us. Manager Fu gave us We upgraded the room type and borrowed a swimming ring for us when we learned that we did not bring a children's swimming ring. I am very grateful to Manager Fu for helping us so much.
   The hotel has a good breakfast and a variety of dishes. The beach is opposite the hotel. The central swimming pool is large and has a slide. Ms. Qiuxiang who checked us out has a very good service attitude. There is also a sky garden on the 11th floor! A good choice for travel and living. I will live again next time I have a chance.

I think it is very good and I am very satisfied. The swimming pool is very large, there are many lifeguards, and they are very responsible. The sea water is not as good as that of Yalong Bay, and the beach is better than that of Yalong Bay. It is worth mentioning that Xiaofu has a guest relationship. He has stayed in a hotel before, and this time he contacted him in advance. After telling Xiaofu about our needs, Xiaofu will try his best to arrange for us according to our requirements. The process is very fast. Be patient and have a good service attitude!

My butler Minion is super nice and helped me reserve a playpen for me in advance. Seeing that we have a baby, a stroller and a suitcase, we also upgraded the room type for free. Lying in the pool on the balcony while taking a bath while looking at the sea is really enjoyable, and Haiyun is really good value for money hahahaha

They said that there was no room of the same type on a higher floor. They took me to the 16th floor to see a 3-bedroom suite. The sea view was Good, but the rooms are run down if not changed. After returning to the room for a few minutes, the front desk called and said that there is room 2 on the 8th floor. It is recommended to take a look. At this speed, there are 5 people in a group, 2 children, and a lot of luggage. just stay. The service at the front desk is good, and they gave the children toys and a lot of fruit.
There is one thing to say, the hotel service is okay, but the room should be arranged according to the actual situation. If you have a full sea view, then you have a full sea view. If you can only call it a garden view, you should use a garden view. Don’t use the conditions of the garden view to earn money for a full sea view! I also hope that friends who will stay in the hotel will see the room first before placing an order, so as not to affect the experience of staying in the hotel.

msg:I stayed in Sanya for half a month and stayed in hotels of all sizes. I would like to give a serious review of Haiyun.
1. I bought a package of 1,300 yuan to stay in Haiyun. It is not worth the price at all. Although it is a package, it is not worth it. I booked the same type of room in advance in ** for only 470 yuan per night. Some of the free items are not worth the money. The included dregs vinegar hot pot is not delicious. I lost money in the end. This is another matter. The check-in experience is not good.
2. Price and environment. The hotel's deluxe single room can only see a little bit of the sea. The hygiene is very poor. The room is very old. It is arranged in Building 2. It is far from the sea. The hotel front desk is far away. I told the front desk that I am pregnant and come to take care of the fetus. I don’t want to walk a lot. The front desk said that this room is the only one. But why doesn’t **Ctrip remove the room and continue to book it? This is very strange. I understand. The next day, I asked for a room to move to Building 1. After all, I stayed for two nights to see it first. The next day, Building 1 started to be renovated at 7 am and continued until check-out at 3 am. The lobby manager made an excuse, saying that the workers secretly renovated it and asked me if I wanted to renew the room and asked me to give a good review for this service and this accommodation experience. I don’t know where **Ctrip’s good reviews came from??? I have expressed my dissatisfaction, and you still want me to give a good review? ? ? This is very strange 
3. Service. For the same price of 600.700 per night, I suggest you stay at Howard Johnson Guoguang or Mangrove Wyndham. Seashine is really bad. I will never come again. The service is also average. Takeout cannot be delivered to the room. You have to walk a long way to get it. The hotel waiter will not help to deliver it. I told you that it needs to be contactless. There is nothing to eat nearby. You have to take a taxi to find food everywhere. There are so many hotels in Sanya Bay. Don't choose this one. 
4. In terms of facilities, the swimming pool is very dirty. No one plays in the gym. It is also very small. The children play very small. It is really average. I don’t think it is a five-star hotel. 
5. The hotel’s buffet breakfast is very unpalatable. I might as well eat Shaxian snacks for more than 100 yuan per person. The bread and other things have no taste. Maybe it looks good in the photo, but it’s really unpalatable. 
6. It feels that the lobby manager and some management personnel will not appease customers. The resort hotel starts to renovate at 7 o'clock and hammer things. Everyone has to go to sleep. It’s so hot in Sanya. I get up at 7 o'clock. What do you say? Find an excuse in the afternoon that the workers are secretly renovating. We are all adults. Don’t make excuses and ask for good reviews. I really rarely evaluate hotels so seriously. 
Summary! Don't stay, it's very uncomfortable, don't stay, choose another hotel, you will regret it if you stay. The service is not as good as the B&B. The food is not as good as Shaxian. The hotel decoration is not as good as Phoenix Island.

msg:I live in Sanya Bay, considering the convenient transportation, Haiyun Hotel has a very good location, opposite to the beach, just across the road. The environment is very good, big and clean, and there are swimming pools and children's playgrounds. I lived in a sea view suite with one bedroom and one living room. One day I just saw the sunset, and the doll was very happy.
Although the hotel has been open for a long time, the service is very good. When you get off the bus, the waiter will open the door and guide you to the front desk to check in. Ms. Qiuxiang answered our questions patiently and gave me a souvenir from the hotel. It is worthy of praise!
 There are many varieties of breakfast buffet, which is very good. I am full every day, and the dining environment is also beautiful!

msg:The second stay,
Advantages: The location is in the core area of ​​Sanya Bay, and the viewing platform on the 11th floor is very beautiful. The next day someone called to ask about the check-in experience, which was very good. I told the other party the following shortcomings. The attitude of this guy named Fu Youjun was very good, he kept apologizing and took notes one by one.
It was great that they made a special trip to apologize again when I checked out.
The rating this time is entirely because of Xiaofu, otherwise it will be three points at most
The following are the shortcomings found during this stay:
This time, the pre-entry service experience is not as good as before!
1. Before booking, I specifically asked whether the hotel pool slide can be used, whether there is a height limit for children, and whether adults can play. The answer is that there is no height limit, and adults can play.
The result is that the big yellow slide cannot be used, and the blue slide cannot be used by adults? ? ? ! ! ! I chose it because of the slide, otherwise I would have chosen Guoguang Haosheng next to it.
2. There is no carpet towel in the bathroom of the room, and it is very slippery after taking a shower.
3. Call the service center in the room and ask if the swimming pool provides bath towels, and tell me that there are provided bath towels, so I don’t need to bring them with me. When I arrived at the swimming pool, I asked the staff and said no, I need to bring them in my room. . . I asked the pool staff that they said it was provided by the pool on the phone, and the staff replied that they were newcomers, so they might have made a mistake. . .
4. Call to make an appoin**ent with cs at night, and say that I am off work, and I will call at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, and I will call at 8 o'clock and tell me to go to work at 8:30. . . I said tell me last night at 8 and the front desk told me it might be new. . .
All the questions are wrong, all new here, interns? ?
How did Haiyun become like this?
No. 5. The water depth standard of the central swimming pool is 1.2 meters. As a result, children with a height of 1.1 meters only reach their shoulders, and the water quality is not good.
6. When checking in, there was no introduction about the swimming pool time, breakfast time, where the restaurant is, it all depends on the lobby and the map by yourself.
7. There is a very beautiful viewing platform on the 11th floor of the hotel. It was not introduced when you checked in, and you didn’t even know about it if you didn’t check in for the second time.

The hotel is very small, the room is not big, there is no butler, the air conditioner in the room is broken and there is no wind. The mosquito bites are very bad at night. The deluxe sea view room is on the side of the sea. And there is a shield in front, which is far different from the MGM in Yalong Bay, and the price is not much different by a few hundred. The most amazing thing is that when I checked in, I didn’t see the housekeeper, waiting for me to check out. He sent me a text message, hello, I am the housekeeper, please give me five stars. Good review 😃

msg:Facilities: The hotel is large, the service is very good, and the underground passage at the door can reach the seaside. But the sea in Sanya Bay is really dirty, with a lot of garbage.
I stayed at Haiyun Hotel for my last night. Based on the previous comparison (I stayed at the hotel in Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay), I felt that Haiyun was really not worth the price. The rooms were very average, all kinds of old, and there were many kinds of breakfast. , but the taste is average (because of the previous comparison)
The price of more than 1,000 yuan per night is really not worthy of the price. It does not feel like it is worth spending so much money. The room is not luxurious at all, it is like an ordinary hotel.
It’s time to redecorate after making so much money. The air conditioner was very loud, the wardrobe smelled bad, not to mention the slippers, they smelled bad.

Hygiene: The hygiene is okay, but the room has a bit of smell, maybe because everything is old.
Service: The service is okay, but the service in other hotels is also very good, so it doesn't feel particularly good. It has the same features as other hotels.

Enter the hotel lobby to check in, the beauty service at the front desk is very enthusiastic, the handsome guy at the concierge will carry the luggage and lead you to the check-in room, and introduce you to the location of the hotel facilities along the way. The service is very thoughtful. The sanitation of the room is also very clean and tidy. The most surprising thing for our family is that it was my mother's birthday during the stay, and the hotel gave a birthday cake for free. The hotel service is so considerate, thank you very much! Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose *yun, thank you hotel again!

msg:Before I went, I looked at a lot of places and finally chose this one. First, because I brought two babies with my mother and sister at the same time, and I didn’t want to be separated.
It's good, so I chose a parent-child hotel. Nengjia has three majors and two small ones. It's just right
Haiyun is very suitable, and it is very close to the airport, and it is very convenient to travel nearby. I didn't report much hope, because it is said that Sanya Bay City is old
Old, and the hotel is rather dilapidated, but after moving in, I found that although the hotel is dilapidated, the service is very good, starting from the concierge, to sending luggage to Rujia, borrowing baby strollers, providing a baby bar, and helping to call
Car, take luggage and put luggage, everything is very considerate, two consecutive good
It was late, and I checked out because I was going to other attractions, but it was uncomfortable to live in, so I went back to Haiyun for the last night.
Generally speaking, the hotel is not bad, with complete supporting facilities, round sea view
The scenery is very beautiful, downstairs is the Coconut Dream Corridor, it is very suitable for bringing a baby, to live for a few days, food, drink and entertainment can be arranged clearly, I am a person who never spends time writing reviews, this is This is the first time I write this, because this is also the first time I have traveled with my baby, and I feel very good. If I go to Sanya again, I will definitely choose the sea
Yun, on the day I went to stay later, the manager called me and asked me if I needed an extended check-out, and said that I could contact him if I needed it. It was a very comfortable experience, but the breakfast options in the hotel were a little less, especially It's fruit haha. After eating for three days, the fruit said the same thing. Everything else is fine.

The room facilities are old, the TV is broken, all the bathroom doors are broken, and the air conditioner is very loud. I tell you to eat in Building 1, which is the first floor. building (the price is very high, who else eats on the first negative floor, I am really convinced) but I won’t tell you that you can’t live on the first negative floor of Building 2. We took the elevator down and it was so dark that I still feel scared when I think about it. The child got sand syndrome from playing in the sand, and his feet were so itchy that he couldn't get off the ground. I wanted to go to their infirmary to have a look. The time was 19:55 and I asked the receptionist to let us take the elevator down to the first floor. The result was that it was also completely dark. It says that the working hours are 09:00-19:00. As a hotel staff, if we see a customer carrying a child on his back and it is inconvenient, we can just ignore it and refuse to help. However, they actually let us carry the child on our back after work. We cannot deliver takeaways because the child fell asleep. If you can't come down to pick it up, they won't help deliver it. If you ask where the takeout counter is, they just point to it and they won't tell you how to get there. (Finally, let me tell you that the elevators in their home have no signs, and the ones that cannot be used are not marked. I took the elevator twice in this home to a place where there was no one and it looked like a warehouse. It was very scary)

msg:I stayed for 5 consecutive nights. I originally wanted to stay for two days, but my child felt that they didn’t have enough fun, so they extended the stay for another three days. However, I immediately felt very bad about extending my stay this time. The reasons for the bad situation:
1. Bathroom: The floor drain is not very clear. When I take a shower, the water almost flows out. This seems to be a common problem.
2. Service: After three days of extended stay, I suddenly felt that the service attitude was gone. The two-bedroom and one-living room I stayed in this time had two independent bathrooms, but only one hair dryer. I wanted another hair dryer so that I didn’t have to go back and forth to get it. After using it, the front desk actually asked me: Isn’t one enough for you? Haha, I want to use it for convenience, so why don’t I ask you to borrow it? Then why do you need 2 bathrooms?
3. Bathrobe hygiene: After extending my stay, I was told to wear a bathrobe to swim in the pool, but after putting it on I found it was dirty? I instantly wondered if this had been washed? I called the front desk to get a new one. The front desk was very nice, but the guy who gave me the bathrobe made me laugh. There was no communication during the whole process: knock on the door - handed over the bathrobe - turned around and left. What happened? Your bathrobe is dirty, can I change it to a new one?
4. Bed: This is a flaw! ! I took my child to sleep in the master bedroom. When I turned over, the bed made a squeaking sound. I didn't dare to move for fear of waking the child...
5. Details: When we checked in, there were 4 adults and 1 child. On the first day, I found that there were no children's bathrobes, slippers, and bathroom floor mats. I called the front desk to ask for them. On the second day, I disturbed the hygiene (that is, changing towels and taking out the trash). , I found that the things were taken away. Where is the new children's bathrobe? Still not released...I can't always call and ask for it, right? Will the waiter look at me again if I make too many calls?
6. The soundproofing of the room I stayed in this time was not very good. When I was sleeping at night, I could hear the flushing of the toilet next door very clearly...

advantage:
1. Early check-in and late check-out are possible
We arrived around 12 o'clock, and we were able to check in directly. Compared with Tianyu, where I stayed later, I was only allowed to check in at 5 o'clock. This hotel is really great.
We delayed our check-out until 1 o'clock, so that we had more time, and we could go to the Yemeng Corridor opposite to take a photo in the morning.
2. Room facilities are very good
We live in a deluxe sea view room with 2 bedrooms and 1 living room. We live on the 12th floor with 2 elevators and 2 households. The view is very good. The decoration of the room is Southeast Asian style. There is also a large bathtub on the balcony where you can take a bath while watching the sea view. The kitchen has a stove, refrigerator, and even a food waste disposer, which shocked me.
3. There are many varieties of buffet breakfast
The breakfast variety is very rich, and there is also a children's restaurant. The dishes are delicious and pleasantly surprised. The key point is that you can make your own to refresh and refresh. The coconut milk is not sweet. You can add honey yourself. There are 4 flavors of ice cream. That is, there are no children's dining chairs when there are many people.
4. Good service
A housekeeper will call you to answer your questions. There is a special take-out cabinet at the entrance of the hotel. I recommend Deshu's raw marinade, which tastes super good.
shortcoming:
1. There are not many facilities for children, just a small constant temperature swimming pool, so the big swimming pool is too cold to enter the water, and the slides are also useless.

Because the schedule was late, Xiaofu took the initiative to help us push the luggage, and gave us a souvenir from the hotel when we left the hotel. Attentive service, very cost-effective hotel!

msg:Haiyun is the most comfortable hotel I have stayed in so far, and it truly feels like home. So I regret not booking a few more days. It is very close to the beach, just two steps away, and if you are tired, go back to the hotel to rest. The concierge Evan is absolutely caring, the service is very good, and the customer is really God. The breakfast is rich and delicious. After staying for two days, I gained weight. There are many styles and great taste! I live in a suite, and the sanitation is perfect. Southeast Asian style, water park, various statues. There is also music that fits the a**osphere in the elevator, and the details are full. Even when waiting for the elevator, there are sofas for rest. In short, Haiyun is great! Next time I will live in a sea view suite

Because I brought my family on vacation, I stayed for a few more days. Thanks to the warm introduction and recommendation of Xiaofu from the guest relationship, he helped us arrange it together and took care of it easily. The room has three bedrooms, one living room and two bathrooms, which is very satisfying for a family stay. , especially there is a large bathtub in the room, it is very comfortable to take a hot bath after swimming at the beach. And Manager Wu is also very responsible. The room comes with four breakfasts, and the meals are both Chinese and Western, which can satisfy everyone's eating habits. Very satisfied with the stay and play.

Service: The service is very good, because the staff will help you in a timely manner when you encounter problems in the hotel, and the guest relations Xiaofu will take the initiative to return visits to solve our travel problems.

msg:Please write down your comments carefully, hoping to help other friends who come to Sanya to play. There are many hotels of the same price near Sanya Bay. I looked at it for a long time before I came and decided to stay in Haiyun. Overall very satisfied. Let me talk about it from several aspects.
Service: Before coming, the hotel housekeeper called to confirm the check-in time and the demand for the room. I said that I want a room on a high floor with a view of the sea. The room the housekeeper arranged is very satisfactory. I also called before checking out to ask if I need a late check out. it's actually very good. When checking in and checking out, there will be doormen to help with luggage, and the cleaning staff will also replace supplies in time to ensure sufficient mineral water. The uncle who watered the flowers in the morning would greet me warmly, very happy~ Overall, the service is very good.
Location: Very close to the airport, we arrived early in the morning, so we chose this hotel based on the principle of proximity. The hotel is also very close to the beach. Just go through the underpass. There are elevators up and down the underground passage, which is very convenient. And there are not many people on the beach in front of the hotel, which is more than a hundred times better than the Coconut Dream Corridor. I am in Yalong Bay now, and I feel that the sand here is similar to the sand on the beach in front of Haiyun Hotel, and the clarity of the sea water is not much different.
Facilities: There are places where you can rest everywhere in the hotel, which is very good. There is a public swimming pool downstairs and a children's area. There are also supermarkets and clothes shops inside the hotel, but the prices are slightly more expensive. Food can be ordered on takeaway, but you have to go to the takeaway area of the hotel to pick it up.
Breakfast: very rich! The breakfast is very complete, both Western and Chinese. Every day, there will be Baoluo powder or Hainan powder with Hainan characteristics, which tastes good. The fruit is also very fresh, the soy milk and milk are very pure, and the bread and snacks are also delicious. Opposite the restaurant is the children's restaurant, and you can shuttle back and forth between the two restaurants.
Room: After all, it is an old hotel, the floor of the room and the countertop of the sink will have some traces of use. But the room is very clean and the view is very good. For us, the traces of use can be ignored. It's just that the mattress is not very comfortable to sleep on, it's soft, and there is a sound when you turn over.
In the end, I am very happy to choose Haiyun, and I will come again if I have the opportunity in the future. Thanks to every service staff! Thank you!

The underground Chinese restaurant has good service and good taste. The air conditioner is very powerful, with strong cold and hot wind. The combs provided by the hotel are of good quality.
Besides the actual situation, the room cleaning that I am most dissatisfied with in the hotel is basically a fool. On the table in the balcony there is still red oil sprinkled by the previous guest. The cushions of the chairs were horrible. The crevices of the sofa are full of particles of dust. The toilet leaked. The hair dryer didn't work either. The TV signal is not good, it is full of snowflakes. The hardware facilities really really need to be updated. Otherwise, the good service attitude of other staff will be wasted. The quality of room cleaning must keep up.

msg:This hotel was one of the worst of the trip.
1. The sound insulation is very poor, children crying in the middle of the night, talking next door or in the corridor, one after another, will definitely make your sleep fragmented
2. Since the balcony door was open when I checked in, I didn't smell the smell. When I closed the balcony door in the middle of the night, the room can be said to be very smelly, and the smell of the sewer will make you suspect that you have lived in the toilet.
3. There are unknown bugs on the bed, biting pieces on the body
4. This is not only a hotel, but also an apar**ent where some houses have been sold. When checking in, there was a lot of chaos, no one took the luggage, and no one showed the way to the room. I asked the concierge myself, but they just told me how to find the room, and they didn't guide me.
5. The room is very dirty, there is dust everywhere, and there is a double eyelid sticker left by the previous guest on the sink. The bathroom glass door is watermarked. Thick dust at the head of the bed. There is already green moss in the bathtub on the balcony
6. The door lock is actually broken and cannot be locked back.
7. There are a lot of people on the beach at the entrance of the hotel, and many small vendors selling things come to chat one by one.
8 I called 5 times to ask for a quilt, and it took 6 hours to deliver it
9 The hotel is very small, there is nothing but the swimming pool, nothing.
10 The hotel is very chaotic, all kinds of sales promotion, yachts going out to sea, house sales, etc. This is not a hotel.
If Lutu wants to have a good mood, don’t come to Haiyun

After ordering at the Chinese restaurant at noon, I waited for more than half an hour for a dish to be served. I urged a waiter to remind me, but I waited for a long time before the food was served, so I urged another waiter. The waiter ran to ask Knowing that the order has not been placed in the kitchen, we dare to wait here blindly, waiting for the dishes that will never be served! There are not many tables for people to eat, and the service ability and attitude are very unsatisfactory.

I contacted by phone one day in advance, and after learning that I was staying alone with a baby, I directly offered to help upgrade the parent-child room type with one bedroom and one living room with sea view, and reserved the room in advance, which made my check-in day very smooth. The upgraded room is very good, one bedroom, one living room, one kitchen and one bathroom, very spacious, and convenient for me to work and my children to take online classes. The room was arranged in Building 1 as I wished. The sea view angle is great. The upper floor is the sky garden with a good view. There are simple toys for children to play in the room. Although my child is very big, he still likes the little tent very much. What needs to be improved is the hardware facilities. Compared with the stay a few years ago, it is indeed a bit old. The fish spa pool is not clearly indicated, and it seems that it has not been maintained. There are many people in the breakfast room, and the waiters take a long time to collect tables

Disadvantages: Noisy, because the beach is public, there are a lot of people, the water quality in Sanya Bay is really average, not clear enough, but the beach is gentle, children can play with sand.
Cleanliness: The hotel is relatively old, the floor is covered with tiles, and the balcony also looks very old, but the cleanliness is okay even if there is no cleanliness.
Service: Check-in and check-out are very fast, and the waiters are very polite, but it may be because there are too many people, and there is no impressive service experience, there is no mistake. However, compared with the subsequent hotels in Haitang District, there is still a little distance.
Facilities: You can eat, drink, and have fun, and you have to pay extra for billiards.
Overall evaluation: An old hotel with a good location, convenient, and price, compared with luxury hotels in Sanya, it is still more affordable. All in all, it is recommended.

msg:The fifth parent-child trip to Hainan, and the fourth time to Sanya.
The baby came to Sanya for the first time when he was 1 year and 10 months old, and lived in Haiyun for the first time, which destined his fate with Haiyun. Now the baby is 11 years old.
Sanya was not originally included in the itinerary for this trip to Hainan. There were too many people... I couldn't stand my baby's softness and stubbornness, so I insisted on staying in Haiyun for one night, so we came.
On the first night of check-in, the customer service called to ask about the arrival time and how many people were staying. On the same day, the front desk took the initiative to upgrade the room for us. It was very spacious for three people. After the previous guest checked out, the room was expected to be cleaned up within an hour. We put our luggage in the room and went out for a walk. Halfway through, we received a call from the front desk telling us that the room was too dirty (it was really dirty, I don’t know how the previous family lived in it) , It takes two hours to clean it out. This kind of active communication service is very satisfying.
Haiyun has an excellent location. From the hotel B1, you can go to the beach through the underground passage. Sanya Bay has the most beautiful sunset scenery. Sitting on the beach, enjoying the sea breeze, listening to the sound of the waves and enjoying the beautiful sunset, no longer Think about work and all the annoying things and just let it all go.
Suggestions:
1. The hotel and rooms are indeed old. The interior decoration and facilities are exactly the same as when we first came here. The door of the shower room is not tight, causing the bath water to flow outside. It is recommended that such a room be equipped with a mop that can sweep the water.
2. The quality of breakfast seems to have declined. There are many diners and the management is not strict. Some people directly take the lunch box to put bread and eggs in it.

The basic seafood sashimi, shrimp and oysters are all unlimited, and they are delivered by Dingsa store, so I think the price/performance ratio is not bad. Generally speaking, it’s really good that a hotel at this price can do this. It’s not particularly casual, and it’s very close to the airport and downtown attractions. It’s a good place to stay for a few days when you bring your baby to Sanya.

msg:This is a resort hotel that is very worthwhile to experience when visiting Sanya. The hotel is very large, with two huge unit buildings. Some rooms are facing the large sea view of Sanya Bay and Yemeng Corridor. The front desk manager specially upgraded me to a deluxe sea view two-bedroom and one-hall room. Due to the large area of the hotel, the lobby The manager also took us all the way to the room and introduced us. When I opened the door and saw the stunning seascape, my wife and I exclaimed, and the feeling of vacation was instantly filled. The room reached about 100 square meters. The friends who stayed at the hotel together and returned to Shanghai early and checked out happened to be guests to rest. The hotel guest service manager Fu Zhongren also called during the stay to inquire about the check-in experience. Promised to give me a late check-out until 15:00 and presented a fruit plate, I would like to thank them for their thoughtful service. Although the decoration of the room can see the baptism of the years, it is well maintained and can't find any flaws (in contrast, the electrical appliances and furniture of the international brand Crowne Plaza Hotel I stayed in have different degrees of failure), and compared to the next door Howard Johnson Guoguang Hotel, the hotel has a first-line sea view advantage in viewing. The breakfast is also very amazing. I didn't expect to taste grilled fish, Hainanese special Hou'an noodles, Baoluo noodles, Lingshui acid noodles, ice cream, etc. for breakfast, and it is not repeated every day. The hotel has also followed the trend with swimming pool slides, children's playgrounds, sky gardens, etc. for parent-child families, constantly catering to the progress of travel needs.
From the experience of staying at the Haiyun Hotel, I am impressed by the management of the current domestic self-operated hotels, which also shows the rapid development of hotels in Sanya in recent years. Special thanks to all the staff of the hotel for the perfect holiday experience. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely come to Haiyun.

msg:I can only say that this is the fourth time I have come to Sanya and I choose Haiyun every time, but I will not choose Haiyun again when I come to Sanya next time I chose a corner house next to a warehouse or a storage room, and I couldn’t think of it as a room. As a result, the doorman who led the way couldn’t open the two room cards I gave, so I called for a cleaning staff. I opened a rectangular house with a pass card. I was very angry. I went to the front desk to change the room, and I didn’t apologize. I said that I was changed to the room in the middle of the picture I saw when I made the reservation. There was a table. I was speechless. Why do you arrange that type of room? The shopkeeper is a bit like bullying tenants who are embarrassed to open their mouths! The facilities in the room are really old. The corners of the walls can’t support it, and there are holes in it. The ground is full of raised bags, which are cracked. The bathroom door is also waterproof, and it’s not waterproof. Function The doors are not closed tightly, and all the walls are moldy. It is estimated that it is caused by damp, etc., but the facilities and environment have been seriously affected. Don't you say to redecorate? The experience this time is really bad. Let’s talk about the beach next door to the hotel. I sincerely advise everyone to be careful of betel bugs! ! ! The first time I was bitten, I don’t know what it was, this time there will be more! I don’t know if there are other beaches, but this beach definitely has them, but some people must not have been bitten, but be careful. I don’t know what medicine to use. It’s very itchy. The locals didn’t say anything. Three bought medicine at their pharmacy and felt useless

msg:The hotel is connected with the residence, and the opposite side is the home of the elderly migratory birds, which are not closed. Overall, it's average. If it's a residence, you can enjoy hotel cleaning and facilities, but for hotel residents, it's a terrible experience.

Facilities: An old hotel with relatively complete facilities, but many places have been abandoned. For example, the sky swimming pool is completely unattended, and the fish spa provided by Ctrip is also unattended. The fish spa pool is so dirty that I dare not touch it at all.

Sanitation: There is no problem with the sanitation of the guest rooms, but the sanitation of the swimming pool is really poor! ! ! ! The swimming pool is really dirty, and no one cares about it.

Environment: It may be that the hotel has no characteristics, and the service cannot keep up. There are many middle-aged and elderly people, so it is not recommended for young people to come. It's more cost-effective, but I won't come to that kind again.

The overall is very average, not as interesting as the surrounding B&Bs. It is recommended that the hotel brand strengthen the maintenance of services and supporting facilities, otherwise the low price situation will never be broken, and it will get lower and lower. Other hotels are improving and perfecting, you are regressing, and it will only get worse.

msg:The only negative review of this trip is for your store.
I stayed in four hotels in total during this trip. The rooms in your hotel are not cheap, and the facilities and services are not bad at all.
The room is too old. Many things in the room are broken. The shower head brackets in both shower rooms are broken. The flush button of the toilet is broken. The drain cover of the sink is not tight and it is leaking. I have found a repairman to check it out. There is no solution.
The outdoor air conditioner in the room is very noisy, even if the glass door is closed, it is very noisy. The manager called to inquire and I reported this problem, but the reply said that the problem could not be solved because the air conditioner was too old. He said he could give me a piece of fruit, but I refused.
The restaurant is too hot. On such a hot day, there is no air conditioning in the restaurant, only a few small fans. Even having breakfast is sweaty. The bathroom on the second floor of the room has no air conditioning and is very hot.
As for the swimming pool, the water is smelly and dirty, really smelly.

2 large and 1 small outdoor live CS (45 minutes): Did not play.

30-minute Kiss Fish Spa: No fun.
Besides, the children's activity room is still very hot. Of the two air conditioners, only one is on.
There is no instant coffee provided in the room, only sugar. You need to call the front desk and their staff will deliver it.
Let’s talk about the front desk. I asked a few questions along the way, but the front desk ignored them.

Decorated in a Southeast Asian style, the room is large, but it is now a little bit in decline. There are few people in the epidemic, and the facilities are old and serious. Fortunately, the price is still worth it! In particular, on the evening of the 17th, when the male front desk checked in, he was playing a mobile game. The attitude was indifferent throughout the whole process, and he cherished words like gold, and ignored them. Very uncomfortable.

The interior facilities of the room are not very modern, traditional Southeast Asian style, and there is a certain sense of age, but the advantage is that the room type is transparent from north to south, and the maintenance is also done well, so the living feeling is very good. My room is on the 8th floor, the orientation is very good, I can see the sea from the bed, and the view will be better on the higher floor. I can't see the sea from the second bedroom, but I can see the plane climb and enjoy the plane up close, which is also very good.

The room rate is more than a little lower than the hotel with its own beach, and the price is very high. There are not many vehicles on the road in front of the door, so you can pass by with confidence. In addition, the hotel also has a special underground passage to walk to the Yemeng Promenade. The service of the hotel is also very good, especially Xiaofu, who is enthusiastic and responsive, and tries his best to help the guests solve the difficulties they encounter, which is very good.

msg:Overall, I am very satisfied. The hotel is not big. The swimming pool in the middle of the two buildings is surrounded by shadows most of the time. Although it is very hot, it does not feel hot. There is a special passage to the beach, so it is not far in the past. Compared with many big hotels with private beaches, the distance is almost the same. The only inconvenience is that there are more people selling it. The hotel room is very big, one bedroom and one living room are very suitable for us, the balcony is also huge, and I can always hear the laughter of the children in the pool downstairs, I feel very happy. The facilities are a bit old, the air conditioner is roaring, and the other overall is good. I am not satisfied with the Chinese food in the hotel. After three meals, there are too few waiters and the response is very slow.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Haiyun is very cost-effective and has a rich breakfast. I love haggis and Baoluo noodles. There is also a special children's restaurant, which changes tricks every day to make children happy 😁 There is only one outdoor swimming pool, but there is a bouncy castle that is very popular with children. There are also two water slides, and the Bubble Party is twice a day at noon and early evening, and the point is that it's free. It is acceptable to cross a narrow road to the beach. The sand in Sanya Bay is said to have been treated a few years ago and is now very good. The children picked up a lot of crabs and hermit crabs on the beach. The sunset on the beach is also quite good. Let's talk about Haiyun's room, the space is large, although it has been a long time, it is well maintained.

The family suite with one bedroom and one living room is 90 square meters, and the price is less than 500 yuan, and the suite room type is also upgraded for free. Although the hotel is decorated and the equipment is a bit old, the same price can only live in a 20-square-meter homestay in the small fishing village of Houhai. The hotel here has its own swimming pool, and the underground passage leads directly to the opposite beach, with an invincible sea view. Because I was catching a flight early the next morning, I only stayed for one night, so I didn't have time to visit the hotel or go to the swimming pool. Going to the beach opposite the hotel, there is a beautiful sunset, and there are starfish and crabs on the beach at night. It is 15 minutes by taxi from the airport, and the seafood square is also within walking distance. It is highly recommended to bring children or catch a flight to check in.

🚗 Transportation: It is more than ten minutes away from the airport. It is very convenient and suitable for staying in Sanya before leaving.
🧹Sanitation: Although it is not particularly new, the cleaning is still considered clean. The service of the auntie is also very good.
🍃Environment: There are many coconut trees and green plants in the hotel. It is good for the eyes. During the day, if the outdoor swimming pool is afraid of the sun, you can take a bath on the balcony of the room. In the evening, watch the sunset and blow the sea breeze.
🔔Service: I arrived at the hotel after one o'clock and should check in at three o'clock, but I was also allowed to check in early. In the afternoon, the child's suitcase was locked and couldn't be opened for a long time. At this time, the customer service fu opened the phone and asked me Need help with anything instantly helped me out!

Besides, the breakfast is also quite rich. Overall, it is worth recommending and the price is very high.

When I came here, I used Ctrip privileges and upgraded to a sea view room. I was in a good mood every morning to see Sanya Bay.
The hotel is an old hotel, the equipment is a little old, but it does not affect the use
There is also extreme symmetry in some places, causing extreme comfort hahaha
The only downside is that the swimming pool is too shallow...only 1.4 meters
All in all, great value for money
Oh yes, there is a lot to eat around

The hotel is quiet most of the time, with occasional noises from outside. The exterior is very beautiful. I stayed twice. The first time I stayed in the deluxe sea view double bed. The sea is on the left side of the balcony. Although it is not directly opposite, I can see a lot of sea and sunset. The second time was the garden view. The lady at the front desk changed the one facing the swimming pool for us. The balcony can also see the sea, which is very beautiful. The front desk also gave a fruit plate, although the fruit is average, but I received it in my heart. The building and layout downstairs is very Southeast Asian, and the photos are also very beautiful. The hotel is just one road from the beach, very close, just 1 minute walk. There are takeaways around, as well as food streets, and there is a Thai restaurant for takeaways that is very good. It&#39;s a bit of a hassle to go to the takeaway cabinet to get it.

The breakfast is good and there are many varieties, the most important thing is brown sugar water, which is too friendly to women- ̗̀(๑ᵔ⌔ᵔ๑)

During the epidemic, you can go to the infirmary of the hotel to see it, which is really very convenient, and you don't need to take a taxi to the hospital to queue up. Then when it was time to check out, my daughter fell asleep, and they kindly let me delay my check-out by 2 hours. I really appreciate this.

msg:This hotel is really shabby and old. I moved from the MGM Sanya Bay Hotel. Because of the temperature, I wanted to live closer to the city. I didn't expect that the difference in my last two days of Sanya was marked as one Bad memories, a hotel is good or bad, it really affects the mood of your trip. I have pictures and the truth below. To comment on this hotel, it is absolutely fair and impartial, without any personal feelings.
First: There are children's paintings on the wall. Do you feel that a hotel with more than 800 yuan per night is normal?
Second: When the flip quilt was about to go to bed, I accidentally found that the vest was filled with this unknown brown secretion. Is it normal for a five-star hotel?
Third: The head of the bed is full of broken hair, is it normal?
Fourth: The most important thing is to look at pictures 4 and 5. The first to ninth floors of their hotel are all such guardrails. My son is three years old, and his head can completely leak out. I was on pins and needles for the past two days. With 10,000 hearts, just based on this, you dare to promote yourself as a parent-child hotel? Friends staying with young children advise you not to think about it.
Fifth: The table in Figure 5 is the table on their balcony. Let's take a look at the hygiene. I guarantee it with my personality. This is what I look like when I am staying. This table is sticky and can be used as 502 glue.
Final summary: This is the most unsanitary, shabby, and low-cost hotel I have ever stayed in in recent years. All the good reviews are written. If you speak against your conscience, won't your conscience be condemned?

We can walk on the beach when we walk out of the hotel in the early morning. It is a lot lighter, but for us tourists, it is more quiet. The sea breeze blowing the waves is very leisurely. The Southeast Asian-style hotel has a Thai handsome guy who opens the door to welcome guests, as if you are in a foreign island. This time I booked two rooms. , The rooms are very large, there is a balcony bathtub, the swimming pool has a special warm water area for children, the baby can linger, and there is an indoor children's playground to liberate the mother, the special children's restaurant room, as if entering the children's playground, and intimate The children's catering package made the baby very happy.

Very caring , I also gave a lot of fresh fruits and small gifts before leaving, which made us full of surprises. The central axis of the hotel's No. 2 building is very beautiful. Let me give you an opinion. The bath water in our room is very small, which makes us feel bad when we take a bath.

When I went there, Xiaozhuo at the front desk had very good service, and he also helped me see that it could be upgraded. I upgraded to a sea-view room. After entering the room, wow, very satisfied, the room facilities are very good, and the balcony view is very good. Although the second hotel was 100 yuan cheaper than Haiyun, I still retired the second hotel decisively and went to the front desk to renew my stay.

Both nights were very comfortable. By the way, the younger brother Raj who helped deliver the luggage to the room was also very good. He should be a Southeast Asian and very enthusiastic.

If you really want to say something bad, it is that the door of the room feels a little loose, and I feel a little insecure when a girl sleeps. Of course, the process of living is still very reassuring. In the future, Sanya will become the first choice.

msg:The hotel’s location in Sanya Bay is just by the sea. It’s very convenient for people who want to go shopping in the morning and evening. Meals and takeaways are delivered to the security booth quickly. There is a small convenience store on the gate. In the corridor, the room I booked is on the third floor. I didn’t book a garden with a sea view. If there is a requirement for light, it is not recommended to live in the lower floors. The gym and swimming pool are okay. Taobao also provides photos and clothing as well as duty-free shop shuttle buses. The overall price is high, but for Jimei who likes bright, open and breathable feel, you can choose a higher-level room, otherwise you will feel a little depressed

msg:The landscape is nice, very close to the sea, with its own underground corridor. You can go to the beach without crossing the road on the ground, which really surprised me. After booking with Ctrip, we arrived at a little too much, the hotel did not have a room for us, and we enjoyed the right to check in four hours earlier, and we were in a bad mood. After talking about it with the receptionist, the hotel was a manager-like person. Helped us to upgrade the apar**ent, the original boutique twin bed became a two-bedroom suite, but it was on the top 19th floor. After checking into the room happily, I found that there was a lot of noise, and I couldn't sleep well at night. The soundproof glass was not soundproof, the sound of airplanes, sea waves, and the sound of cars were constant. Basically, I didn't sleep well at night. The complimentary small fish fish spa is too cold to use because the pool water is too cold. The service can't be mentioned anymore, I waited about an hour for a hot pot. Normally, no waiter can be seen in the building. You can only call the front desk if you have something to do. In short, I will not stay at their home again. Too noisy.

It should be mentioned that the hotel is old, the facilities are a bit old, the bathrooms are still moldy, and the cabinets are painted off. Don't expect too much. He is very cheap. The waiters are very professional, the service is very good, the cleaning aunt, including the check-in at the front desk, was quickly upgraded to the sea view room. We arrived early. We can also go to the children's playground for a while. There is a swimming pool.
Close to the airport and across the road is the beach. Ten minutes away from the night market.
I will stay in this hotel for a few days when I come to Sanya next year.

The interior of the room is rather old (maybe this is the Southeast Asian style). Maybe you don’t like the feeling in the room very much, and the round view is also average. It is recommended to stay in a sea view room, but the external facilities of the hotel are quite good and very cozy
Location: The entrance is the Coconut Dream Corridor. The location is very convenient, and there are many food nearby

There is the beach opposite the road at the entrance of the hotel, which is a bit inconvenient to cross the road, but the hotel has a dedicated underground passage that leads directly to the beach, which is convenient and safe;
The hotel hardware is good: besides the large swimming pool, there is also a comfortable, elegant and quiet public leisure area. The guest rooms are spacious, bright, clean and hygienic;
Good hotel services: from reception and lobby services to restaurant services and room cleaning, the service awareness and hotel quality of big-brand hotels are reflected everywhere. Booked for two nights and then renewed it for three nights, showing our satisfaction with the hotel.
The person I want to commend here is the assistant manager of the hotel's general desk. After we stayed for two nights, we took the initiative to call to ask about our accommodation experience, solicit opinions, and we are also willing to help us upgrade our sea-view room for free. I would also like to commend the cleaning staff in charge of room 10320. We stayed for five days and helped us clean the room carefully, professionally and diligently every day, so that we can live in a sanitary, safe and comfortable stay. The breakfast waiter Huang Liqun should also be commended. We can see her diligent, professional, and conscientious working at breakfast every day in the restaurant, in order to allow guests to have a clean and comfortable dining environment while working silently. Haiyun has such excellent employees, so why don't you have any guests.

msg:Evaluation basis: staying in a duplex sea view three-bed room, 9 floors to 10 floors, 4 adults, two families are no problem at all

Room facilities:
Although it is not new, it is basically reasonable. After all, it has been renovated and renovated in the past few years, and the decoration process should be fairly careful, unlike some of the hotels that have been renovated and scratched in all kinds of places. Both rooms upstairs and downstairs can see the sea. There are toilets on the first and second floors respectively, which are very convenient. The toilets on the second floor are super large, and there is a bathtub on the balcony on the second floor! The long cabinet under the TV on the first floor is very practical and can put a lot of things.

Toiletries; pretty good, not high class, but basically enough

bed:
Very comfortable, but the head of the bed on the second floor is a distance from the wall, a bit uncomfortable, but it's still good

Sea view:
The sea view is good overall, you can see the entire Sanya Bay, you can see Phoenix Island, you can see both upstairs and downstairs

breakfast:
Based on the time of 10.1, the breakfast may be different at different times, the richness of the breakfast is ok, the noodles are hot and the beef offal is very good.
There are many types of bread, and there are also delicious snacks such as flower cakes.
Fruit is also good, ice cream, yogurt, coconut milk are all good
And there is a children's area, there are child seats and themes, very intimate, small sausages for children, small egg tarts, etc.

Park environment:
Overall it is ok, there are swimming pools, but there are not many people, there are water slides.

Children's play area:
Large area, more toys, not bad

Beach:
After going out, the beach is just across the road. There are lounge chairs placed by the hotel, which is good. If the budget is not high, it is really cost-effective to come here.

Parking: Yes
There are not many places on the ground. The parking spaces are a bit tight when I come back at night, but there must be parking spaces.

kitchen tools
There is an induction cooker, a smoke machine, and a water basin. It is very convenient to buy seafood and cook it yourself.

First of all, the hotel is full of Balinese style, the details are slow, the lobby is transparent, and the atrium is also very comfortable. Second, the room type has been upgraded. It is not too cool to watch the sea from the bathtub on the balcony. The opposite is a certain net celebrity pool hotel, and the night view is also good. Third, the swimming pool is designed for children. There are a lot of fun, such as shallow water, slides, rubber boats, etc. There are also bubbles to play in the festive season.

In short, when you come to Sanya on holiday, here is really a treasure house. The disadvantage is that the facilities are old and there are more people for breakfast. But compared with its advantages, I think it is acceptable and satisfactory!

There are lounge chairs and veils everywhere. The service attitude is good. There are people at the hotel to send me and my luggage to the room. After all, it is an old hotel. The facilities are definitely not comparable to the newly opened hotel, but in terms of cost performance , I personally think it is quite high! Let’s talk about the hotel’s breakfast, it’s really rich! The breakfast period is from 6:30-10:30. I have been to Sanya more than 20 times. I rarely meet a hotel with such a long breakfast time. I am very satisfied with this. Next time I come to Sanya, the hotel will cross the road to the beach. There is a special underground passage to go to the beach. It is safer than crossing the road. There seems to be a hotel exclusive lawn, where many wedding photos are taken... Next time I come to Sanya, I will still choose Hai Yun!

The breakfast variety is also quite rich and the taste is quite satisfactory. The hotel swimming pool is not very big, and the slides and other parent-child facilities are still complete. Overall, the hotel service is very warm and cost-effective, and the whole family was in a happy mood this trip.

The palm trees make people feel like being in a tropical tourist destination. The breakfast is superb, rich and delicious, and the desserts are sweet and sweet. Not greasy, the service is even better, the pool is clean and you can borrow the ball for free.

It's about 10km from Sanya High-speed Railway Station to this side. APP calls a car for about 20 or so, which is relatively convenient. It is said that it is closer to Sanya Airport. The beach is just walking out of the hotel, and it feels pretty good.
Hotel facilities
In the designated standard room, the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by bamboo curtains, which is embarrassing; there is a shower inside, and a bathtub is set on the balcony, and the bathtub is covered by bamboo curtains; there is a ceiling fan in the room. It’s very comfortable to open the door with a ceiling fan only; the lights in the room are dim and there is no white light source, which makes people feel that the room is darker, and I don’t like it very much.
There is a large recreational pool outside. I went too late at night. I didn’t experience a lot of entertainment. It’s a pity
hotel service
After check-in, someone will guide you to the room; if you have a lot of luggage, you can also send it to Yazi in the room; when you leave the shop, you will help carry your luggage on the car
Hotel food
I heard that the breakfast is very rich, so I bought a breakfast voucher specially. Maybe it’s because the expectations are too high. After the experience, it feels more general. There are indeed many types of breakfast, but they are all very general things and the taste is relatively general; the most distinctive feature is the preparation of a special children’s breakfast area. Breakfast and dining area specially prepared for children
Generally speaking, it's still wide

It is also the best hotel among the 5 hotels I stayed at this time! Not only because of the seaside and large sea view rooms, but also because the hotel is comfortable and relaxing. The room is very large, originally scheduled to be a double room, the front desk staff sees that we have children, they will upgrade us to a one-bedroom and one-living family room for free, with a child bed, the room is very cozy, at least 80 square meters , Double balconies, very cool without turning on the air conditioner! The hotel facilities are also very complete, the rooms have all kinds of thoughtful small things, the swimming pool is also very good, the children don't want to come up for swimming. Although the hotel has a bit of history, it feels very comfortable. The big black Indian brother who greeted the guests was still there for a few years! Still very kind and proactive, the little brother receiving will take the initiative to help you bring your luggage to the room. The price of the hotel is also very close to the people, such a big room is only 300 yuan! It is recommended that you make a reservation from Sunday to Thursday. It is a bit expensive on weekends, maybe at least 700-800 yuan. This hotel will definitely be my first choice next time I come to Sanya!

msg:This trip was a holiday trip with children. It took a lot of time to choose a hotel before I came out. I especially hope that it is safe and hygienic to live with my children. I finally chose Haiyun Resort Hotel. Now I am staying in a very objective evaluation. Friends as a reference.
1. Regarding hygiene is up to standard, I read many comments before saying that it is dirty and smelly. I did not have it when I checked in. The hygiene was done well and there was no smell. Although we did not use the bath towels and towels, I also read them. They are very new. , And very clean.
2. Although the facilities are not as good as the newly built hotel, the room layout is reasonable, dry and wet separated, and double sinks. Some commented on the issue of humidity. The humidity in Hainan is high, which has nothing to do with the hotel. Sanya Bay was developed early, and most hotels are old. There are really not many hotels that are super new and rely on the sea.
3. The location of the hotel is good, and the beach is just across the road. Although it is very close, the hotel has built an underground passage from the hotel to the sea in a very humane way, so that mothers with children can be more at ease.
4. The hotel swimming pool water is very shallow, suitable for all children to swim. Parents don’t need to stare at the children nervously for fear of accidents, and they are also very relaxed. There is greenery around the swimming pool. Even if the sun is strong at noon, they will not be exposed to the sun when playing around the swimming pool. , The scent of lilies in the lobby floats to the swimming pool, refreshing.
5. The hotel has a Chinese restaurant and a buffet seafood restaurant. It is also very convenient if you don't want to go out to eat in the hotel. The price is clearly marked and the price is moderate. The hotel’s breakfast is very rich. I don’t know what happened to those who said that breakfast was not eaten. There must be a lot of people who go there during the holidays, but the dishes are very fast. I didn’t say that the same dish was not served until a long time. It was the first dish. It can be added if it is less. There are limited indoor places to sit, and the hotel has also opened up an outdoor area for dining.
6. Check-in and check-out are fast. There is a place to sit in the public area of the hotel every few steps. Even if you go early, there is enough space for everyone to rest.
Based on the above advantages, I think this hotel is suitable for children.
I am in the tourism industry, and sincerely inform the areas that need improvement
Although the style of the hotel is antique, the light in the public areas is indeed a bit dark, especially the section of the road leading to the elevator from Building No. 1, which can enhance the light.
There are a few points of special praise
1: The hotel had a room card inserted in the room before we checked in and the air conditioner was turned on. The room was very cool and beautiful in detail. This is the intimate first impression.
2. I need to adjust the number and number of days for breakfast. The front desk said she would ask about it. I thought I was perfunctory, but I didn't want to cause trouble with them. I didn't expect the front desk to help them deal with it seriously. After a while, the manager called Said it has been arranged for me.
3. We stayed together. When the waiter came to clean, I said that they were so busy and no longer needed. Just fill me up with water, but the little brother of the waiter cleaned the bathroom carefully. After a while, a waitress came to ask if the waiter was there. Clean carefully? If there is any need, tell them in time.
I think they treat their customers very sincerely, so there are some small flaws that I think are not a problem at all. Then my friends thought of Sanya and I immediately recommended it.
I'm not a caretaker. I often go out to play and live and I am too lazy to comment. The bad reviews of this hotel seem to be really inconsistent, and I only wrote so much for the first time. I hope to give you a useful reference

msg:I have a preference for Haiyun. I came to Sanya 4 or 5 times, and Haiyun stayed in 3 times. There is a large beach in front, and the waves are not big. It is suitable for children to play and play. Although it is across the road, the hotel specially dug a tunnel and installed an elevator to walk directly under the road to the beach. Safety measures are done. well. Although the hotel has been around for many years, the room service is as good as ever. The floor is clean and tidy, and the clothes thrown on the bed will be neatly folded. But in many respects, it’s not satisfactory... This time, it should have been five years since the last stay. I didn’t expect that there are quite a few places to complain. The most important thing is: 1. This time I booked a duplex room. The room type is very good, the bathroom upstairs is very big, the disadvantage is that the downstairs air conditioner does not know whether it is the air inlet or the air outlet. The air conditioner may be out of date and the sound is very noisy. Sleeping at night is particularly obvious. The measured value is about 50 decibels. 2. The breakfast category is slightly thin, and the dinner plate is actually made of plastic. I don’t know how long it has been since I changed it. It’s so cheap! The other thing is that the restaurant is really hot. It was not like this before. I don’t know why the air-conditioning is not turned on enough to rely on a few ceiling fans. What was particularly shocking was that a small table fan was placed next to the fruit to blow. Is this used to cool down or drive away mosquitoes and flies? 3. Although the hotel swimming pool is suitable for children to play, there are slides and water inflatable houses, but according to the children, the water is very dirty, which is visible to the naked eye. Stayed in the past few days and played once. If you still come to Sanya in the future, I hope to meet a better Haiyun!

After the accident, the hotel was still arrogant and said that they had no responsibility at all. They said that they sent a fruit plate out of humanitarianism, but from the time we came back from the hospital until we left the hotel, no staff member came to care. You really need to be cautious when you bring children with you. I was the only one who felt sad when I saw the child bleeding. As a parent, supervision is definitely the first priority, but if there was no right-angle danger in the room, the child would not have been so seriously injured. Moreover, the hotel did not care about it at all and was afraid that we would hold them responsible. You could at least pretend to do it.

The swimming pool is between the two houses and is not exposed in the afternoon. It’s the seaside when you cross the road and it’s very convenient to take a bus at the door. Sanya’s buses are really better than taxis. The buses are clean and there are fewer people. The air conditioning is very cool.
The Huayu Hotel in Bialong Bay is simply too good. The Huayu Hotel’s facilities are successful and the service is not as good as the sea. Although there are three swimming pools, because they are villas, they cannot block the sun and are very exposed to the sun, and there is no place for children to play.

Special praise during the stay: The young man named Shen surnamed Jilin who checked in at the front desk upgraded our room for us. In addition, the guest relations liaison surnamed Fu paid a return visit to the service in time. The male concierges at the door are very enthusiastic, and they are very enthusiastic to help with luggage. I have to say that this year's Haiyun also opened a children's restaurant, which is very friendly to children. The children’s playground is okay for children under 6 years of age, but it should be upgraded. The area is a bit small. There is also an ice cream shop on the first floor, which is especially popular with children. Finally, I like Haiyun’s swimming pool, which is very popular. Not enough shots every time.

The room is very clean and there is no musty smell. The sea view room has a great view
DIY is really cheap

The hotel food is very rich, it is recommended to eat at the hotel, there are many choices. If you want to run out, you can eat nearby. Things outside are more expensive. Tourist area? You know! But every time I go out to eat, feel the a**osphere of the food stalls. The hotel has a swimming pool, kids love it! Duty-free city is also very close, about 100 yuan by taxi. Smoking for a long time to go shopping to buy and buy, huh 😄

msg:🌟Highlights: Parent-child restaurant, children’s pool, children’s slide, direct access to the beach underground passage

The beach and sea of Sanya Bay should be the lowest among the beaches in the urban area. The blue water can only be seen when the sun is strongest at noon, as shown in Figure 1. The hotel has a special underground passage to the beach, and the elevator goes up and down, which is very convenient.

The room is not very wide, but not narrow. The balcony of the Deluxe Ocean View Room can see some sea views. As shown in Figure 2.

The most favorite is the children’s pool at the waist of the four-year-old child. There are two slides. Children enjoy sliding every day. There is also a dedicated staff who prevents adults from sliding, ensuring the safety of children. Every afternoon there is a bubble body, as shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5.

The hotel’s children’s play area is not big, but there are enough types and the staff is very nice. As shown in Figure 6.

Children also like the children's restaurant for breakfast, with small tables, small plates, and bright lights. It feels like a loving environment. Children’s breakfast is also very rich. It is a favorite breakfast for children. An old aunt of mine ate a few bites. The light taste is too suitable for children. As shown in Figures seven and eight. In addition to the indoor dining area for adults, there is also the outdoor under the coconut grove. The air is great, except that it is a bit hot. The breakfast is good overall, with good taste and clean, with special noodles or noodles. Figure 9

Because it has been in business for a long time, the room is a bit old, but it does not affect the use. The hygiene is still better. The room is cleaned every day when I go out and come back. The transportation is also relatively convenient. It takes about 40 minutes to drive to Nanshan Scenic Area and Wuzhizhou Island by car, and it takes about 10 minutes to take a taxi from the airport to the hotel, and the fare is about 20 yuan. The beach across the road is nice, and children can go to the beach in the evening to pick up small hermit crabs. Traveling with children and the elderly chooses here for the price/performance ratio and the sense of experience is good.

Upon check-in, the deluxe sea-view big bed room was upgraded to a suite, a big room, balcony, living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, everything is available, there is also a children's bed, and a small wooden horse and children’s drawing board. It is very suitable for bringing children to play. This is worth five-star praise. On the edge of Sanya Bay, the sea view is very good. There is a very large terrace on the 11th floor with a wide view and panoramic views of Sanya Bay. The service is really good. If you have a problem, press 0 on the landline, and there will be a dedicated person to help you solve the problem. The attitude is very good. In the evening, go directly to the beach to watch the sunset, beautiful, you can shoot the ultimate beauty without filters. You can also try the nearby motorboats, you can bargain, it's really exciting. There are many beautiful women on the beach in the evening. From the hotel to various attractions, every time I walk along the road along Sanya Bay, the sea in the distance, the coconut grove nearby, and the cool breeze in the car, it’s so cool.

From the waiter’s dress, to the enthusiasm of the service, the bright smile, the whole is great. We were upgraded to suites when we checked in. The suite is not only large in space, but also has a bathtub with a view on the balcony. The baby can soak in the daytime and there is a hot spring.
⭐️The hardware is not very good, but it is also very complete. Swimming pools, slides, air beds, etc. are all complete.
⭐️Service, very good. Upgraded the suite. The only bad thing is that I found a pair of slippers next to the bed in the bedroom when I slept, and I felt that I forgot to collect it, which affected my mood.
⭐️ Meals are very cost-effective. In the comments, there are ice creams, but they are actually quite complete. Especially in children’s restaurants, both meals and dining chairs are short, suitable for the height of the baby. And it's really different from adults.

The sanitation of the room is because the facilities are relatively old, the toilet is a bit leaky, the shower is also leaking, the air conditioner is really loud, and the quality of sleep at night is not good. Choose carefully. Ordered a duplex sea view, with a good view and a lot of space. Overall it’s good. In terms of service, we brought two kids here, and one set of children’s supplies was missing. We called the front desk and said that they would be delivered right away. I didn’t deliver it when we checked out. I probably forgot to

The service is very enthusiastic, the garden-view swimming pool is big, I prefer the infinity pool here, and I almost book it out at night. The hotel has a Southeast Asian style. When I heard the music playing in the lobby, I immediately thought of "Little Nyonya" and thought I had arrived in Malaysia. Unexpectedly, Sanya Bay has such a good hotel, quiet, beautiful price, and good service. The hotel has a beach across the street. The hotel has a special underground crossing and elevator, which is too user-friendly. There are food stalls in the surrounding area, as well as the coconut chicken. After eating the chicken, walk slowly back to the beach to watch the sunset. It's so beautiful. The hotel also has a hidden private super large terrace overlooking Sanya Bay, which is a good viewing platform.
The hotel also has a dedicated person to contact the guests to inquire about the stay, feelings, and suggestions.
Now everything in Sanya is much better than before. Everyone is developing in a good direction and competing in a healthy way.
This hotel is worth recommending!

Sanya Bay is very open and the hotel's price/performance ratio is really high! It is recommended to live! The room smelled of damp and mildew just after entering it, just turn on the air conditioner. The hotel has a swimming pool, a gym, there are also small supermarkets, fruit shops and so on. There is also a private party venue on the 11th floor. The service is also very good and very polite. Very satisfied ~ breakfast is average. I will continue to live here next time!

The concierge at the door will take the initiative to help you with your luggage, send it to the room, and immediately return to check in after you check in to see what other needs you have. The downside is that the hotel sea view room can only see the sea on the side, far from the city, if you go out to shop or eat, take a taxi is far away, the room sheets have a small rotten hole.

2、贈送的魚療，我晚上去，結果説設備壞了，沒燈，太黑了
3、房間裏面的設備，各種陳舊（有圖）
4、雖有陽台，但是根本不通風，因為你不敢把窗户打開，蚊蟲超級多
5、要睡覺了，發現床頭的吊燈關不了，問管家才知道，要把陽台的玻璃落地窗關好，吊燈才能自動關閉。關鍵是我關了很多次窗户，吊燈還是沒熄，就衹能穿好衣服，聯繫管家讓工作人員進房間來幫忙，並説了希望是女工作人員來。然後等了半個多小時，來了一個男的工作人員，通過扭轉按鈕來關閉的。我才意識到，原來管家把我在微信上説的床頭吊燈，誤理解為了衣帽間的燈。（有圖）
6、備註説要安靜點的房間，結果給我一間距離電梯衹隔了一個房間的，很吵鬧。隔壁房間的説話聲、吹風機的聲音清晰得很。
7、外賣不能送進來，衹能自己去路邊拿。（疑問：那為啥酒店又是半開放式的呢？沒有門的地方，可以直接進入酒店。電梯也不需要刷房卡。不是這兒的住店客人，也可以去泳池。）
8、浴室碰頭是松的。一直對着玻璃隔間的方向，洗澡的時候衹能要不把噴頭取下來手持，要麼就貼着玻璃那邊洗。
9、浴室和衞生間，雖然是磨砂的，但是很透很透。

但是，大堂幫忙提行李的工作人員，比較熱情。這個可以點贊。

服務：酒店服務很好，上下車幫忙給拿行李，送至大堂辦理入住，尤其李經理，因為有寶寶，帶的行李也比較多，給我們送到房間，還親切問候我們有無其他需求，因為小孩發燒，還給我們送了體温計，很多的水，給個大大的贊👍

酒店交通：
機場到酒店特別近，打車20多塊錢，去第一市場也才16塊多，酒店外面還有公交站，真的特別方便。
房間設施：
總體設施比較簡單，但房間大，海景房能看着大海入睡，在晨光中醒來，設施老舊就忍了。房間裏還有電磁爐和抽油煙機，感興趣的小夥伴可以看着辦。
早餐：
早餐很豐盛，可能是涉外的原因，中西餐都很豐富，還有專門為娃娃準備的餐食，特別貼心：蒸蛋，意大利麪Q，小麪包，蛋塔，切成小塊的肉和烤腸，雞米花，笑臉薯餅，切成小塊的蔬果，孩子們應該能吃得很開心。
游泳池、健身房都有，攜程買還贈送了一大堆福利。
酒店有地下通道直接通往海灘，來回特別方便，海灘上有很多私人拍照的，拿着單反，可以付費幫你拍照，選好了，發電子照片Q給你。
還有各種海上娛樂設施。酒店也有自己的拍攝工作室Q，同樣可以選哈。

海韻酒店從上到下,從裡到外都讓人很滿意.
我老婆懷孕了，管家小曾入住前就聯繫我,幫我安排更好的房間,升級了海景房，還延遲退房，非常貼心。
前台辦理入住很熱情,禮賓部來回幫忙拿行李,打掃房間的阿姨也非常仔細,幹活乾淨利落,位得表揚。總之在消韻酒店住們很開心,下次還會帶家人住.

msg:以前每年都來海韻住，酒店地理位置非常不錯，門口就是椰夢長廊海灘，帶娃上海邊挖沙非常方便，這次假期陪家人來度假，我們一如既往的選擇海韻，酒店時間年限比較長，可以看得出有些歲月劃過的痕跡，但是服務依舊如此温馨！尤其是我們的管家小龍弟弟，非常熱情，我們到酒店的時間比較晚，為我們準備安排好房間，三亞天氣比較熱，提前幫我們開好空調，分享了周邊許多的美食攻略！服務很周到！酒店裡機場很近，第二天父母的航班比較晚，下飛機15分鐘車程也就能到，過來玩剛到三亞的家人們可以選擇海韻，我們先到的三亞，行程比較敢計劃去亞龍灣和海棠灣，下次有機會過來再多住幾天！期待下次海韻美好相遇！

ps:後兩天酒店訂在亞龍灣，對比海韻的小黃助理，這邊酒店的助理就比較失望了，基本沒有服務

msg:非常難忘的一家酒店，服務非常好！我們按照三亞灣→太陽灣→亞龍灣→海棠灣的路線選擇和入住酒店。三亞灣我們選擇了海韻酒店，想着是三亞灣看日落的最佳點，主打一個聽勸。酒店外景和大堂照面是東南亞風格，整體為開放式。大堂兩邊是開放式連廊，海風很大極涼爽，很多旅客在連廊休息小憩打盹兒，非常愜意。酒店樓棟外觀看起稍舊，有一種濃厚的東南亞風格的藝術感。房間很舒適，很人性化，如果要游泳或住的時間長需要晾曬衣服，可以找管家多拿幾個晾衣架。説到管家，我們的管家小曾真是頂呱呱的棒，幫忙預約入住、幫忙推薦附近美食、幫忙借嬰兒車等等還有很多，服務真是周到，必須要點贊。除了管家小曾，酒店大堂的禮賓、前台的服務員、房間的保潔員，都很熱情服務主動周到，讓人完全忘記了初來乍到的陌生和不適。馬路對面就是椰夢長廊，5分鐘走到海邊，感覺是三亞灣黃金點。酒店內部環境很不錯，健身房、公共健身器材、室內室外小童樂園齊聚，游泳池有水滑梯、小童遊戲區、温泉池，整體非常好（點名對比某些高端國際酒店，游泳池和海韻比簡直就是擺設）。點外賣也可以送到酒店樓下。2棟樓頂花園是看日落最佳點，雲多也可以看漂亮的火燒雲。總體來説非常適合一家人或朋友三四一起入住。已經和朋友約好明年來三亞還住這裏，還找管家小曾。
