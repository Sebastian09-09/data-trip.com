msg:Owners must try very hard to operate this BNB in this area. Great place to stay. Food is good. Staffs are super helpful and impeccable. Absolutely gorgeous view from the balcony. You should deep breathe the fresh air in the morning. Bathroom and living area floor are heated. How sweet!

It cannot compare the Airbnb in Queenstown New Zealand stayed few years back but why not give it a try with limited resources they have. 
A must go BNB if you pass this small town. Give it a try.

Something need to improve is absolutely NO Smoking in the dining area and remove the stain in the bench which guests left behind. 

Speed train is only 15 mins away. Highly recommended.

msg:I like this homestay. I can see the care everywhere. The environment is comfortable and the food is delicious. I think the baby fish millet porridge can only be eaten in this place. The rice noodles for breakfast also show the care. Furong Town is actually not big. I think it is enough to spend 2-3 hours at night. We stayed in the homestay most of the time, picking vegetables and peaches, sitting in the pavilion, blowing the wind, and looking at the mountains. It met all my expectations for travel. This place covers a large area. The housekeeper will drive the battery car to pick up and drop off. The one-to-one housekeeper service is so considerate. I would like to praise Binbin here. Our housekeeper this time was thoughtful and considerate. The afternoon tea was a surprise. It was so thoughtful. Thank you for your care😊 I wish you better and better.

The hotel not only patiently shuttled us to and from the scenic spots to ensure that our trip was comfortable and convenient, but also treated guests with great service. In addition, the hotel's environment is also very clean and sanitary, making people feel safe and comfortable. At the same time, we would like to express our gratitude to Binbin, the hotel's housekeeper. During our stay, Binbin was always responsive and did his best to meet our needs no matter what we needed. What touched us even more was that when we accidentally forgot the express delivery, Binbin also specially helped us deliver it to ensure that we would not be inconvenienced. In short, this stay was great, thanks to all the staff for their help!

People who live in this kind of environment will really live longer, so try to bring her here once a year!

msg:Really a wonderful stay experience! I didn’t have high expectations before I booked this homestay. I thought it was just an ordinary light luxury homestay, but as soon as I entered the gate of this homestay, I was shocked. It’s super big, and the whole mountain belongs to their family. It’s like an ecological park. There are mountains and rivers, and the entire homestay is so big that it needs a shuttle bus to pick it up! ! Suddenly it was worth it! As if living in paradise

Their butler service is very considerate, and they will do everything I need in time, and the boss has his own restaurant 🍴 really delicious farm food! ! There is an internet celebrity afternoon tea, and a very large infinity pool with mountain view 🏊♀️ which meets all my needs The window is a 180-degree floor-to-ceiling glass window with a mountain view. It’s so beautiful. I can stay inside without coming out.

And it's very close to Furong Town, about ten minutes' drive away. You can ask the butler to arrange pick-up and drop-off. It's also very close to the high-speed rail station

It is no exaggeration to say that their price is worthy of their configuration and service. If you have a few days of rest time, why not come and experience this paradise homestay hanging in the mountains! !

msg:I'm really surprised. Erzhuo Valley is on the mountainside, ten minutes away from Furong Town Scenic Area, far away from the noisy commercial urban area. The room is large, clean and warm, and the service is really great. I booked this hotel because I wanted to experience living there. Away from the hustle and bustle in the mountains and forests, the butler at the B&B is very enthusiastic. We did not make any plans in advance. The local attractions and tour routes were recommended by the butler, which was very good. I have to mention that the food cooked at the B&B is also very good! Especially the The local chicken is so delicious that I want to stay for another two days. Special thanks to the little housekeeper for taking care of us everywhere. It really makes us feel like we are home. If we come to Furong Town again, we will still choose Erzhuo Valley.

msg:This treasure B&B in Furong Town! I discovered it!
Come to Furong Town for vacation this summer
A treasure B&B discovered by a friend by chance
I don't allow anyone to not know
Erzhuo Valley. Between the clouds!
The B&B also has a store, Erzhuo Valley.Xijianshe. The two stores are across the river.
We finally chose Erzhuo Valley. Between the Clouds
It's brick by brick, step by step, scene by scene
They all have a lot of rhyme to them~
I really love the detailed design in the room
The room is very spacious and the design is simple yet stylish.
The furniture is custom-made and exported, the mattress is from Jin Koer, and the shower is from Hansgrohe, which is super comfortable.
Such an extremely comfortable experience, another 100 stays would not be too much.
Careful details are not only reflected in the accommodation
It is also reflected in the facilities and facilities in the public area of ​​the B&B.
There are karaoke and meeting rooms indoors, and the breakfast room is particularly outstanding.
There is a 2,000-square-meter courtyard outside for fun and fun.
We can gather together for BBQ, cool off in the infinity pool, etc. We are too lazy to go out to eat, so all the dishes we ordered at the restaurant are delicious, affordable and delicious.
Things to do around:
It is 15 minutes away from the center of Furong Town Scenic Area, and the pick-up and drop-off is great
About 5 minutes to Zuolong Gorge Natural Scenic Area
There are also Mengdong River rafting and Hongshilin Geopark nearby. I will definitely come again!

msg:Laerzhuo Valley is undoubtedly the best choice in the hot summer. The air is fresh and the temperature is cool. You can stay away from the hustle and bustle of the city and feel the inner peace. It is really suitable for us who live a fast-paced life in the city. Xiaolong, the housekeeper of the high-speed rail B&B, came to pick us up at the high-speed rail station and introduced the local tourism culture in detail along the way. After arriving at the B&B, there was a shuttle bus that took us to the door of the room. The service was excellent throughout. The room is also modern and simple, which is very suitable for taking pictures. The B&B also has entertainment facilities such as a bar and an infinity heated swimming pool, which are suitable for families to relax and unwind, as well as for couples and girlfriends to take beautiful photos. The lady who owns the B&B is so beautiful, gentle and very nice ~ Don’t forget to check in at the B&B restaurant. If you are amazed, this trip is definitely worth it👍🏻

msg:I often take my children to stay in B&Bs, but rarely give reviews. This B&B experience was so amazing that I didn’t even want to go to the scenic spots. I just stayed at the B&B all the time, so I must give it a good review. Hurry up and get ready for family vacations with your kids!
The B&B was recommended by a local friend. I have been looking forward to it after watching the video and reviews. It was the afternoon when I arrived, and the housekeeper came to pick me up in a special car. He was very welcoming. After checking in at the entrance of the B&B, I transferred to a sightseeing car and went uphill. The scenery was very good. , we stayed in Shibi, and when the children arrived in the room, they couldn't wait to go to the balcony to see the scenery.
The B&B rooms are clean and comfortable, and many of them are very private. You don’t have to worry about your children disturbing others. The facilities are also very complete, including an infinity swimming pool, a bar, a restaurant, and you can also see giant salamanders and goats. Breakfast is in a very a**ospheric restaurant. It is not a buffet but there are many kinds of food. Most of them are local specialties, such as mugwort cake, salamander porridge, bacon and fungus rice noodles. They taste great and I eat them all every time. The Chinese restaurant is open to the public. We recommend beef ribs, salamander, and steamed bacon. They all taste very good, and there are almost no bad dishes.
I stayed for two days. On the second day, because I was busy with filming, I asked the housekeeper to take photos of the Miao ethnic group for the agency I was cooperating with. The scenery inside the B&B was very impressive.
Generally speaking, it is enough for Gu Zhang to take his children to see the night view of Furong Town. There is still a gap between other scenic spots and other well-known scenic spots. Staying in the hotel gives a good experience and it is very relaxing for a short vacation.
Special praise to the housekeeper Xiaolong. My son has always affectionately called Xiaolong brother. He is very enthusiastic and patient. In short, this is a very good experience. I have told my family that I will definitely find another opportunity to come together!

The hotel is not far from the scenic spot and is less than ten minutes' drive away. It is very convenient to travel. The hotel also has a car to pick you up.
Dieyunjian is in the second phase and just opened this year. The environmental services are excellent in all aspects👏🏻Breakfast and afternoon tea are provided, and the taste is also good😌
There is an underground breeding ground in the villa, and the housekeeper took us to see the giant salamanders. It is said that there are more than 20,000 giant salamanders. By the way, they also provide giant salamander porridge for breakfast, which is very delicious😋.
Special thanks to the housekeeper, Fairy Qiao, who is very warm and considerate and responsive to all requests. After swimming in the evening, we were given a large portion of fruit as a gift when we returned to the room. In the afternoon, they also made Kung Fu tea for us, and the service was 10 🌟rave reviews. Will come again~

再一個就是酒店的環境沒得説雖然面積不是特別大但吃喝玩樂一條龍。
最後必須提的管家服務太到位了，從接站到入住後各種幫拿東西、陪玩，特別是還接送景點甚至陪逛街😂，在此強烈稱讚管家小銘，人不夠了老闆還親自開電瓶車到景區接。不得不説整個民宿的環境和團隊都是一級棒。配合價格甚至可以説物超所值！
一句話總結：強烈推薦，無腦沖就完了。

再説説服務，從訂酒店開始就有私人管家聯繫我們，我們是自駕不需要接，管家小姐姐老早就提前在停車場等我們，下車就坐上他們的酒店專屬車到山上的房間，服務沒得説，需要任何東西或者任何疑問，都可以隨時聯繫管家提供💕非常非常棒的酒店，以後還會再來💕

樓下是餐廳，還有無邊游泳池小孩子可以玩玩水～
整體裝修風格我很喜歡，每次要出來給管家發消息就來接我們，管家小姐姐好漂亮的！
另外讓我驚喜的還有他們那裡的娃娃魚，第一次見到那麼大的娃娃魚，吃起來也還不錯，吃了兩種不同的口味的，還有被家人評價最高的就是雞湯👍一級棒，一口氣吃了兩碗飯☺️
超級無敵推薦👍👍👍高品質

值得一提的是個管家俏俏，（圖三的紅衣服妹妹就是她，還幫我們帶小孩子）很有活力和耐心的小妹妹。我們大人和孩子們都很喜歡她。所有的照片也是她精心為我們拍的。
爾卓山谷的服務理念真的很特別，可以稱為跟蹤式服務。比如，提前問到我們一行幾人，會提前在停車場等顧客，然後提前為小朋友們準備好小童牙刷牙膏和浴巾還有一次性拖鞋。為我們準備的燒烤材料也很豐富～總之，超級滿意，以後有機會會再來的。希望爾卓山谷能越來越好！俏俏妹妹也能一切順利，幸福快樂下去！

msg:新開的酒店，環境乾淨衞生，loft的親子房，深得孩子喜歡😍服務非常貼心，有一次免費接送景點服務，老闆和管家服務態度非常好。從餐廳景觀望出去就是泳池，孩子從進芙蓉鎮景區開始，就吵着回酒店游泳，太喜歡了。坐在泳池邊，一邊看着孩子游泳，一邊欣賞着美景，很是愜意。餐廳出品不錯哦，推薦娃娃魚打邊爐和臘味合蒸！

msg:酒店整體環境不錯！氣候很怡人！裝修很有品味！管家式的體驗很享受，服務態度相當nice！特別是我們的專屬管家麗麗及團隊點贊，感謝老闆及老闆娘的親自迎接。最後説一下我認為可以改進的一些地方：首先房間軟裝相比同類型的名宿酒店略簡單些，一晚的費用和配比的軟裝不成正比，如椅子配比不合理（一家人衹配一把椅子），房間連一個小型沙發，普通的電視都沒有，這種設計過於強調品味，而忽視普通人的品質，浴室放置換洗衣服的空間過小，沒有晾曬衣服的設施，洗衣房就是一個雞肋（衹能方便近一點的人），房間燈光的處理也不科學，床頭燈的亮度居然超過頂燈。早餐可選擇型少，就不做評價。就説這些把,總得來説，名宿的品味有拉，但是品質還欠缺一些。

房間很乾凈，環境超級好～住着很舒適。另外因為我們一早趕高鐵，管家得知後覺得我們打車不方便，一大早就睡眼朦朧起來送我們，超級感動！
