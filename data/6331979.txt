msg:Our room was facing the ocean. It was lovely to hear the waves while sleeping. The room was big and clean. The bathroom/dressing area was the same length of the room... lovely. The pool personnel was nice and friendly. One of the pools was closed, however the sea view pool was nice when it wasn't interrupted by guests shouting into their phones or smoking to the side. The wind blows smoke towards the lounge chairs, so smoking anywhere near the pool should be banned. Unfortunate that it isn't a rule for smokers to smoke nowhere in the vicinity of pools. The breakfast was nice in the selection. However, when screaming kids it turned what could have been a relaxing start to the day to one of wolfing down food to escape the chaos. Bus boys would look at our table with empty plates and just look... not take our plates away. Not sure why. We can speak Chinese and even if English scared them away, it was just a plate. Would I return? Yes, because of the lovely view from the room, the size of the room, the pool, the cleanliness, landscaping, and beach (size and cleanliness).

The villa (8610) was very comfortable and well appointed. The staff was always available to bring a golf cart to bring us from the villa to the main building. The on premise seafood restaurant was pricey for the service and quality. The breakfast food and selection was very good, although the lack of available sitting forced us to sit in the overflow area, which was not air conditioned. There are virtually no on premise activities and you cannot swim at the beach due to rip tides. Taxi fare to the duty free and other locations is inexpensive and taxis are always available.

It can be seen that the local tyrants spend money and the investors are willing to invest. The sanitation of the guest rooms is not good. There are tiny bugs at the head of the bed. I got several bites on my body. The services of the fitness center, swimming pool, paddle board and restaurant are all in place, but the room service is very poor. Calling customer service and contacting the hotel's housekeeper did not solve the problem. To be honest, I feel that the hotel's customer service is like a tour guide with a garbage group, not like a hotel's full-time customer service.

Opposite the sea view balcony is Wuzhizhou Island. At night, the moon rises over the sea, which is very nice.

It is very cost-effective for off-peak travel. It is less than 900 per night. When I checked in, there was a one-on-one butler service from Manager Su. WeChat was replied in seconds. We upgraded the parent-child room for free. The baby was very happy. After staying for a day, I still felt that the sea view was not good enough, so Manager Su changed me to a room with a great sea view in the central area on the 28th floor, and took the initiative to refill our minibar with free drinks. The dressing table and bathroom in the room were also super large. It was very comfortable to live in. There were many parent-child activities. My daughter liked almost all of them. Shell painting, kite painting, fishing, mask painting, sachet making, coconut picking, and experience them all. I talked to Manager Su on WeChat, and the recreation center would call me to confirm one by one. I ate almost all of the hotel's Cantonese restaurant, Thai restaurant, lobby bar afternoon tea, and noodle restaurant. They were all good and not too expensive. You can rest assured to bring your baby to eat. The Thai restaurant also provides free Thai clothing change experience, which is particularly interesting. The hotel cooperated with the painting box travel photography, which was very good and left a perfect memory. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Mangrove!

Poor hygiene: There are ants on the washbasin in the room, and there are flying ants and moths on the bed. If you don't know, you might think you've lived in a diamond forest.
Poor service: 1. When I found ants on the washbasin, I called the customer service and the customer service said it was normal. I saw flying ants at night and told them again, and then they said to change rooms. The guy who came to help change rooms also took the room card in a handover manner, and didn't help move things. We used both hands to carry them upstairs.
2. The shower gel was not enough and the phone was sent for a long time. Everything was slow.
3. At night, I saw the earrings fall from the bedside table to the ground, but I didn't find them. The hotel room cleaning during the day also said that there were no earrings. I don't force this point. After all, the earrings are small, but I still have doubts. According to the logic of cleaning without sanitary dead corners, how can I not find them.
Facilities and environment: The overall room is still very large, more than Marriott Westin, but the overall feeling is particularly like a fast hotel, large but not sophisticated.
Overall, Haitang Bay is not short of hotels, this one is really not recommended

The breakfast is rich in variety, but there are many people. There is a special takeaway cabinet, which is more convenient. Parking is in the underground garage. The room layout is similar, the difference is the size and direction of the balcony. The experience of staying at the Haitang Bay Mangrove Hotel is undoubtedly the most comfortable one in this trip. The hotel is spacious and comfortable, with an excellent view. It is specially arranged on a high floor to better enjoy the unbeatable sea view. The hotel gave me a picture box for travel photography, which is very good for taking pictures. The housekeeper Wendy is serious and responsible in her work, and the hotel will notify you in advance of any activities. The housekeeper has strong coordination skills and everything is done. So if there are any problems during the stay, go to her.

msg:I have been to Sanya many times, and Haitang Bay is really a very suitable place for vacation. This time I chose to stay at Haitang Bay Mangrove Resort Hotel. The three-day and two-night package I booked also included the photo shoot. The housekeeper Xiao He was very enthusiastic. He contacted me in advance to ask about my hobbies and prepare in advance. He arranged a room with a very good location for me and gave me fruits and snacks. He was responsive to all kinds of needs and was not vague at all. The hotel is particularly spectacular as a whole. The layout is very a**ospheric. The room is simple. The location of the lobby can see the nearest Wuzhizhou Island in Haitang Bay from a distance. It was a very satisfactory experience to stay. Thanks again to the housekeeper Xiao He for his warm hospitality. I will choose Haitang Bay Mangrove if I have the opportunity to stay next time.

msg:Took my kids to play in Atlantis for four days. Originally we planned to find a nice and quiet hotel for vacation and relaxation. But Mangrove took over a corporate annual meeting or something. It was on the lawn outside our room. The deafening rehearsal started at 11:00 am and lasted until after 10:00 pm. The noise was so loud that I almost collapsed. I contacted the hotel many times, but they said they had no choice. They had already collected money and had to let them be so noisy. It was supposed to be a leisure vacation, but we spent the whole day in a high-decibel noisy environment like a nightclub. The kids were awakened several times during their naps. This is the first time I have encountered such a situation. The hotel sacrificed the interests of the guests in order to make money. It is really speechless.

You can contact her if you have any questions during your stay. The hotel room has a 180-degree sea view, which is really enjoyable. The room is clean and tidy, with modern facilities. There is also a large bathtub on the balcony. You can see the Wuzhizhou Island opposite from a distance. From the angle of the floor, you can see that Haitang Bay is the coastline. There are also many things to do in the hotel. The Internet celebrity river swimming pool and the picture box travel photo are also worth checking in and taking pictures. You can also play kayaking inside. The hotel is in a good location, close to the duty-free city, which is very convenient. Overall, this time is still very good, and I am looking forward to coming to the Mangrove Hotel in Haitang Bay next time.

msg:Haitang Bay Mangrove is a hotel that makes people feel very sorry. It occupies the most expensive location in Haitang Bay, facing Wuzhizhou Island, with endless sea views and large areas of precious mangroves. The modern wave-shaped exterior wall rocket roof designed and built by world-class designers at a high price is also a good existence among the high-end resort hotels in Haitang Bay. The family Star Alliance suite we booked has a 180-degree unbeatable sea view on the 18th floor facing the sea. It is a 172-square-meter double-story duplex. The walls are all hand-painted cartoon patterns, and the furniture and furnishings are all customized with matching themes. It can be seen that the owner‚Äôs intentions and vision when he opened the business. Unfortunately, it is now quite old and even damaged. The replacement cost of this non-standard customized product is probably relatively high. Or is it due to improper maintenance? The hotel immediately dropped its grade after ignoring it. There are many similar examples of mismanagement. When we checked in, we were given a one-meter-long bed for infants, which was not suitable for our teenage stature. We changed rooms, but the room was very dirty and there was a lot of dust on the floor, especially in the bathroom, which had a strong odor. After reporting this to the housekeeper Olga Cai Jie, she immediately took action to improve it. She mobilized the housekeeper Xiao Pan to clean the room and used an air purifier to remove the odor. She also sent an afternoon tea set as a token of consolation. Unfortunately, the odor problem cannot be eliminated and solved by the two employees alone. The underground shopping street on the m floor and the breakfast restaurant have long been filled with the smell of stinky rags. It is the kind of pickled smell of fabrics that are not washed clean, which is disgusting. I reported it to the employees of the small supermarket there, and they asked me if I could smell it. We thought it was okay. It was amazing. This is what it means to be numb to the smell of abalone after being in the abalone shop for a long time. So that shopping street could have accommodated dozens of shops, but now 90% of them are closed and abandoned, and it is extremely dilapidated. Compared with the prosperous business of Atlantis, which is one kilometer away, the mangroves can be described as bleak. If there is a problem with management, no matter how good the hardware is, it is useless. Moreover, even if the hardware is new and good at the beginning, it will be damaged quickly due to improper maintenance and insufficient customer base, thus creating greater waste and losses, and a vicious cycle. On the second night of stay, the large lawn under the hotel was reserved by a local financial credit company to hold an internal karaoke for self-entertainment. It was comparable to square dancing, and the noise was unbearable to listen to. The whole sky was polluted by noise and lights. They simply didn't care about the lives of innocent guests like us. We should have enjoyed the peaceful summer night sea breeze when we stayed there. Why should we suffer from this noise in vain? Isn't this making money from the credit company and sacrificing our room fees? In short, if the management of Mangrove does not make a big cleanup and rectification, the future of the hotel is worrying!

Hygiene: The floor of the guest room is slippery, and the guest room will not wipe it dry after cleaning and mopping. The glass door of the balcony is full of watermarks, which obviously has not been wiped for a long time. The shower room is seriously flooded.
Environment: The swimming pool is small to begin with, and several of them are closed. The hotel receives a large number of team customers and conducts team building until late at night. The entire park seems like a large disco scene.
Service: The housekeeper and the front desk lobby service staff are still good, with good attitude and thoughtful service.

The moment I opened the door, I was even more so by the beautiful sea view outside the balcony. The room is a combination of white and wood grain, simple and a**ospheric, with a super large space and dry and wet separation. The hotel is located in the center of Haitang Bay, close to the Wuzhizhou Island Duty Free Shop, and it is very convenient to travel. When night falls, the light and shadow show in the main building of the hotel is particularly beautiful. The booking package also includes archery, squash, billiards and other experiences. It's a pity that I missed the painting box travel photo shoot. It is said that the photos are very beautiful. Especially considerate is Wendy's butler service. After checking in, I added WeChat and introduced the relevant information of the hotel and the surrounding area. It also met our various consultations during the process, and there were exquisite snacks and fruits for gift. I originally wanted to stay in Xidao on the third day. Thinking of the intimate service here, I decisively extended my stay.

What I want to complain about most is that the area in the park is super large but it is very wasteful. The swimming pool in such a large park is so small, small and scattered, and there is only one available at present. Isn't it the purpose of swimming in a hotel to play in the swimming pool?

You can also order takeout. If you want to go shopping in the duty-free shop, it is not far away! Although it is the off-season, there are more people during the Qingming Festival. There are many people for breakfast, but there are still food supplies and seats. The service of the hotel is still good. There are staff to drag your luggage to the room for you. There are staff on the beach to remind safety. There are also security guards by the swimming pool. Always remind to pay attention to safety, which is quite responsible!

Serve:
I stayed for two nights. Before check-in, the dedicated housekeeper Sumanya contacted me to help me book dinner and asked about my room preferences in advance.
When we arrived at the store, we didn't specifically contact the housekeeper in advance. When we checked in, Sumanya came over and helped the front desk check us in.
After that, if you have any questions, it is very convenient to contact Manya directly.
Since there was no king-size bed room on the higher floor that we preferred, we notified the housekeeping depar**ent to help us merge the twin beds into a double bed, so my daughter and I had an extra-large bed that was nearly 3 meters tall.
The day before check-out, Manya contacted us and registered the room so that check-out would be postponed until 2 p.m.
The above is the service.
facility:
Let's talk about the hotel's hardware facilities. The hotel is very large, very modern, and the rooms are very large. See the pictures for details.
FOOD:
The Mangrove Dinner is great. I will stay at the Yalong Bay Sheraton later. In comparison, the prices are similar. The Sheraton is cheap, but the breakfast and lunch at the Mangrove are of great quality, with excellent ingredients and good taste!
All in all, a very pleasant vacation experience! [joy]
After that, instead of going back to other bays, I will only choose Haitang Bay, and Haitang Bay will also choose mangroves.

When checking in, they recommended changing to a twin room. They mentioned again and again that if we were bringing a baby to sleep, would there be any seams when putting two beds together? They promised to make it seamless, and repeatedly emphasized that it must be done. However, when we moved in and had two children in the room, it was not done. The key point is that the hygiene is really poor. There is an obvious layer of dust on the floor. There was a strong wind on the day of check-in, and the dust from the air conditioner blew all over the bed. Finally, we asked the cleaning staff to change the quilt. It is really not worth recommending.

Service: When checking into a hotel, you must first look at its service. After we booked the hotel, the housekeeper Xiaocui contacted me immediately and was very enthusiastic. Because we arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock in the evening, they reserved a room for us in advance that we liked the sea view. The room had the best sea view, which saved us a lot of trouble! Very considerate. After a lot of twists and turns, I moved into a villa. I would also like to thank Manager Yan for his help! The villa is a one-bedroom villa with a private swimming pool, which is very suitable for families with children.

Environment: When staying in a hotel in Sanya, I believe everyone wants comfort and comfort. This is my first time staying at the Mangrove Hotel. The hotel facilities are complete and some people have not commented that the facilities are outdated. It belongs to a simple urban style with mainly white tones. The hotel has a beach. Dining bar, mini bar. The luxury shopping stores, children's play area, etc. are all very nice, and the photos are great. The breakfast in the morning is also very rich, clean, hygienic and delicious!

Hygiene: In terms of hygiene, it can be said that it is basically spotless from the moment I enter the room. Because I am personally quite mysophobic, I will wipe some corners with my hands when I enter the room to see if there is any dust. Everywhere is clean. On the second day we went out to play, the cleaning staff Li Shifang helped us tidy up. The tidying up was very clean and considerate. He also gave me a shell necklace! love it! Live in a villa later. We went out in the afternoon and encountered a storm. When we came back, the floor of the room was covered with fallen leaves. The cleaning staff Meng Xiangli and two male masters immediately came over to help us clean the room. Because there was water on the floor, the leaves were difficult to clean, so they swept it over and over again. They also thoughtfully wiped the floor-to-ceiling glass doors and windows, and cleaned up the fallen leaves in the swimming pool. The service attitude was excellent and there were no complaints. When we left, we didn‚Äôt forget to ask if the items in the room were sufficient? It's really considerate.
This time I came to Sanya for leisure and spent more time in the hotel. I felt the hospitality of the hotel and really felt at home. Next time I will choose mangrove.

The location of the hotel is nothing special. You can see the blue sea and blue sky. The only thing is that the waves on Haitang Bay are relatively big, so you can only tread water.

The Cantonese cuisine in the hotel is also very good, especially the Dongyang goat cooked in a good heat. The only thing about the hotel that makes people feel out of touch with this elegant environment is that there are so many people at breakfast that it feels like a disaster!!!
The interior decoration of the hotel is modern white and minimalist style. It has a shortcoming. When the decoration is new, it is called design. It looks old and old, and it feels a bit like a fast hotel. But the hardware facilities are good, and there is a takeaway cabinet downstairs, which is very convenient. There is also a fresh beer house with delicious passion fruit beer, and there are live performances in the afternoon and evening. Then there are live broadcasters selling hotels everywhere, from morning to night.

Thank you very much! I will come again. A few small suggestions for reference: the travel photography charges are unreasonable, and they charged thousands of yuan without knowing why, and their attitude is arrogant and does not allow negotiation. It is recommended to improve.

The location of the hotel is very good, very close to Atlantis, and there is a private beach right outside the door, with rich entertainment options. The room is large and spacious, very clean, and you can see the sea view and sunrise from the balcony. I would also like to express my special thanks to Xiao He, the butler this time. His service attitude was very good and he responded promptly to any requests. He also provided exquisite hotel afternoon tea as a gift. All in all, it was a great experience!

msg:The hotel booked a 180-degree sea view. When I booked this hotel, I was also interested in the 180-degree sea view room. The sea view is really beautiful. Much cheaper than sea view rooms in other hotels. Well, how should I put it? The room is a bit older, and the age can be seen from the color of the door. It's not high-end, simple and luxurious, but it's quite cozy. The bathroom is very clean and the most important thing is that it is large and has a dedicated makeup area. The room is very spacious and very comfortable. The older ones can be ignored. I took a small train and circled around the hotel. The hotel is very beautiful, the lobby is also very beautiful, and the photos are very good. Overall, I like it very much. The travel photos provided in the hotel can be taken with confidence. The photos taken by personal experiments are very good. Outside the hotel The restaurant on the grass is also very good. You can try it. It is not expensive and the price-performance ratio is very high. There are several children who love to play in the swimming pool.

It is very close to Haichang Evernight City and duty-free shops. It is also very close to the seaside. It is very convenient to watch the sunrise and the moon on the sea. The hotel has many types of restaurants, including Chinese, Western and Thai restaurants, as well as a ramen restaurant and a craft brewery for drinking beer.

There are foreign singers singing at the poolside bar in the evening, and there are a series of performances during the Lantern Festival, which is a good experience. I tried the restaurants and bars, and the consumption was moderate. It felt more cost-effective than the No. 68 Food City and Duty Free Shop restaurants next door, but there were not many customers. It seems that the hotel should strengthen the promotion of its own restaurants. The sea view from the room was great and refreshing. The only thing is that the furniture and decoration in the room may be corroded by the sea breeze all year round, and some places are slightly mottled. The housekeeper Xiao Xu contacted us before checking in. He was always responsive to any questions we had and provided meticulous service. Happy Holidays!

Only the mangrove forest didn‚Äôt let us open and close the car door or take our luggage. Be proactive and polite! When I checked in, I saw that the staff was too busy and asked me to take my luggage to the room. Haha, I was refused by the concierge guy.
     Mangrove's service must be five stars!
     I really love the room hardware, the oversized bathroom and washroom, and the oversized sea-view balcony. Every day when I open my eyes, I can see the endless sea.
     The welcome fruits are also generous, and the drinks in the minibar are free.

I brought my family here and booked a Star Alliance Supreme Ocean View Family Room. The view on the 17th floor is very good. The hotel is spacious and comfortable, and the view is excellent. It is specially arranged on a high floor to better enjoy the invincible sea view. The photo box provided by the hotel is very good for taking photos. The housekeeper Xiaoqian is serious and responsible in her work. She will notify you in advance of any events in the hotel. There were two rooms.

msg:The service in the hotel is great. First of all, I added the hotel butler Xiaocui. If you have any questions, you can quickly solve any problems. You can pick up and drop off from the hotel gate to the lobby. Especially friends who want to eat at the 68 Food Street next to it, don‚Äôt be brave and walk there by yourself. It‚Äôs really far away. You can take the shuttle bus. Quickly go to Gate 3 and walk for 5 minutes. It is very suitable for the first day. The mini bar has four bottles of drinks and two bottles of mineral water. If the mineral water is not enough, you can ask room service to send it to you. Ctrip group purchase package because I chose to travel in January. An additional 400 yuan was added every night. Only two meals were given for dinner. For children over 1.2 meters tall, the dinner was increased to 298 yuan. Although the set meal is dinner for two large and two small children (children not exceeding 1.2 meters tall), the difference cannot be made up but must be paid. The adult price is a bit depressing. The kids in the back basically don‚Äôt eat breakfast because breakfast costs an additional 198 yuan. But early in the morning, the kids have no appetite at all. Not having the student price makes me feel so sad. The beach is really beautiful at night. There is an active band singing at the beach bar, which is also very nice. The children's beach is also very comfortable. The heated swimming pool and digging in the sand on the beach are very fun. You can freely choose to take travel photos if you don't need it. You don't need to add a package. The hotel provides five original photos without editing. The photos are not bad. It is really a pleasant trip. I will want to do it next time. Traveling to Sanya is so fun hahaha

You can take a taxi directly to the duty-free shop, food city, Houhai Haichang Dream Night City, etc. You can get in the lobby and the distance is not far.

msg:I visited this Mangrove Hotel in February and had a very good impression. It felt like everything was new and the facilities and decorations were very new. I thought it was great at the time. After I went back, I made a lot of videos to promote it to my friends and fans. I came back in December and felt that all the facilities were a bit outdated. There were also more white paint peeling off the outdoor chairs, and the look and feel was somewhat degraded. The outdoor swimming pool only has one parent-child pool, one outdoor pool, and a small pool as a surfing experience area. This is actually quite good. The other empty pools also affect the experience. The situation will be better when I come in February. . Paul's Kitchen in the hotel felt that the quality and quantity of the dishes were not as good as in February. The nine photos included in the hotel package, although later expanded to nearly a hundred, were taken on our own initiative and had nothing to do with the hotel. But the cameraman was not in good spirits. Although he took a lot of photos, he gave people a feeling of impatience and was not in the mood to guide too much. This kind of experience was not good. As a hotel owner, you can also provide guidance in this regard for travel photography set up in the hotel. After all, it also represents the image of the hotel.

The housekeeper Xiaoqian was very conscientious and asked about the accommodation requirements in advance. As a result, it turned out to be a house with closed windows. Xiaoqian quickly coordinated and adjusted the supreme sea view room for us. It was indeed the best floor and angle, giving us a great experience. When we encountered some minor incidents in the later period, Xiaoqian has been patiently communicating and coordinating, just to make our experience better. She is so dedicated to her work, which makes people feel very convinced.

I hope Mangrove can continue to maintain the quality of a first-line sea view super-star hotel, and I will stay here again if I have the opportunity.

The lobby is very stylish. It‚Äôs almost Chris**as and the Chris**as tree has been put up in the lobby. I guess it will be more beautiful during Chris**as. It was lively. I stayed for two days and extended for another day. I liked it very much. The butler Xiaoqian's service was very good. She would ask about the itinerary thoughtfully. The hotel also has a free airport bus, but I had to go to other places without making an appoin**ent. I made an appoin**ent for the painting box. Travel photography and taking photos are also very beautiful. This time I stayed in a sea view room. The scenery was very good. Looking at the beautiful scenery, I felt beautiful.

In terms of facilities, as a hotel opened in 2017, there are still some signs of age. Some parts of the public area can be seen to be in disrepair, but I think the overall maintenance is done. It's still very good. The decoration taste is online. Special thanks to the housekeeper Wendy for her service. She responded to messages in a timely manner and helped to book the airport bus.

This is my first time staying at Mangrove. To be honest, there are many surprises. Even those who have never liked reviews would like to review my experience on a family trip. First of all, I was anxious because my original trip to the Maldives didn‚Äôt make it to the mangrove forest, so I decided to give it a try just because Ctrip was okay. After staying for 3 nights, my experience exceeded my expectations, so I would like to share the following points:
1. Service: Very considerate. The butler contacted me on WeChat even before I left. He told me everything I wanted to know about the parent-child activities and rooms, and then he went through the gameplay guide for each day. It was easy and meaningful. , don‚Äôt waste time.
2. Environment: The 180 deluxe sea view room I booked has a really good view. Facing the sea, the spring flowers are blooming, and I feel comfortable. It happens to be the Mid-Autumn Festival, and it is beautiful to watch the moon on the sea. The room is also very large, with a balcony for bathing. The butler provides disposable bath bags and bubble baths, which the children like very much.
3. Implementation distribution:
(1) There is a slide in the children's swimming pool. Children like it very much. Swimming rings, mosquito repellent, sunscreen, towels and water are all provided for free, which is very good. (2) The floating boat ride is free and very good. The children played it three times. The staff member also took photos for us. We took photos casually. Our family time was a blockbuster. (3) Picking coconuts is free, very fresh, and you can drink them as soon as you pick them. It is very meaningful and the children are very happy. (4) Surfing experience, 15 minutes free experience, I didn‚Äôt go, so I didn‚Äôt experience it. We went surfing in Houhai, but it was better to go there only once, it was too noisy. (6) Self-funded items: You can try the helicopter experience. Although it is a bit expensive, you can try it if you have never experienced it before. It is very good, 580/person/5 minutes, video recording is 300, and my child and I are 1,460, and it can be done in 5 minutes. Although it is a little expensive, it is good to feel that your children like it once. It is recommended that older children can sit in the front row for a better view. (7) The beach is 6-10 minutes away from the hotel. The sand in Haitang Bay is just like that. The hotel here provides children with sand digging and buckets, which is very good. It is recommended to bring a bath towel in the hotel swimming pool so that the children can play on the beach and relax. üòå. (8) Meipai, um, average, but it‚Äôs okay to take a few beautiful photos here, don‚Äôt spend too much money here. It would be great to bring parent-child outfits in advance for photos.
(9) There is a supermarket downstairs for convenient shopping. The Thai restaurant in the hotel is not bad, but children can't eat Thai food. You can go if you like. Eating in the hotel is very convenient and there are many places to eat around. (10) Experienced the hotel's spa, 488/person/60 minutes, good value, suitable for relaxing when you are tired.
4. Additional services:
The dessert table they gave me was very beautiful and thoughtful, but I am anti-sugar, so I ate fruit instead of eating it. My child also ate less when his teeth were changing. It was a pity that it was so beautiful. I also just happened to have a birthday on National Day and gave me a birthday cake. It was quite considerate. Well, the hospitality was good, but I am celebrating the ***** calendar, so I deserve thanks. There were also kids who made a wishing lantern and drew a kiteü™Å at the hotel during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which was quite a surprise. They sang a lot of patriotic songs in the lobby during the National Day, and adding our national anthem would be even better, like itüëç. Recommended!

msg:Advantages: 1. Occupying the C position on the Haitang Bay coastline, it is great to go out to the private beach to watch the sunrise online. It is also very comfortable to go for a walk in the afternoon.
2. The facilities inside are relatively new and well maintained. There are people who are watching the projects that can be played in the water, and they are also very enthusiastic, which is great. The public areas, including the lawns, are well maintained, and you can feel confident taking photos and checking in wherever you go. It's very comfortable just being in the courtyard. Travel photography with a painting box is also possible
3. The room is large, with unparalleled sea views and a great view.
ps: There are lifebuoys in the swimming pool that you can use for free, which is great!
Disadvantages: The room has a bit of an Internet celebrity style. For example, the door opening is a bit difficult to open, and the paint is seriously peeling off in some places. There is a huge difference between a garden view room and a sea view room. Try to give priority to the sea view.
In the end, the overall experience was very good, and our housekeeper, Ms. Olga Cai Jie, provided great service. I will stay at this hotel again.

She introduced the relevant information of the hotel to us in the form of WeChat and gave us the information in advance. I've reserved a room.

I booked a photo shoot with the hotel, and the photos taken inside the hotel are still very good. Not bad. The experience of staying here is great. The scenery of the hotel is really nice. You can see the sea from the lobby, and you can see the sea and the beach from the room. You can watch the sunrise in the morning and watch the sunset in the evening.

The hotel's corridor from corridor to room is like an art corridor, like traveling through time and space. And the room facilities are not as mentioned in the reviews, but are very good, simple yet grand, and match well with the blue sea! There is a gym in the hotel, where archery and squash are free. There is also a photo box that provides five free electronic photos. I will choose Mangrove again next time I come here. I hope Mangrove will get better and better.

msg:1. Book a room: It is recommended to book in advance. Because I arrived at the hotel to book a room at short notice, the front desk said that the room type could not be upgraded for free. After comparison, I booked a 180 Supreme Ocean View Twin Room on Ctrip, which was much cheaper than the one purchased at the front desk. It is said that if you book in advance, you can usually get a free upgrade. It is probably that the rooms are fully booked. 2. Staff: Olga, the assigned housekeeper, was very nice. She helped apply for welcome fruit snacks and responded quickly to any questions. If you have any needs, you can directly WeChat the housekeeper or call the front desk directly. Dafu who cleans the room is very serious, warm and polite. The staff are very nice and responsive to everything. Everyone I meet on the road will say hello warmly and generously. It is indeed the service level of a star hotel. It is very comfortable to stay in the hotel. 3. Supreme Sea View Room: This room type on the 26th floor is really great! Extra large room, spacious and bright, you can also take a bath on the balcony, with unparalleled sea views! Watch the sunrise in the morning, listen to the waves, watch the rainstorm and the sea and the sky merge into one, watch the sun rain in the distance with blue sky and white clouds, and watch the rain in the distance. Watch helicopters, paragliders, and various sea sports on sunny days. You can also zoom in to see the beach from a distance. Horses and ATVs on board. It feels like it's above 10 floors. If the location is good, the view should be good! 4. Free entertainment facilities: There is a small entertainment and leisure building in the hotel yard with three floors. You can register for free experience of land curling, archery, billiards, table tennis, billiards and other projects. You can experience it directly during the off-season. 5. Outdoor swimming pool: Currently, the hotel has opened four outdoor swimming pools, adult pool, children's pool, rowing pool, and surfing pool. The adult pool feels a little small, about two and a half lanes wide. 6. Buffet breakfast: I personally feel it is very rich, with both Chinese and Western food, and a rich variety of fruit snacks, which will be more abundant on weekends. Breakfast is from 7 to 10 o'clock, and many people don't leave until almost 11 o'clock. 7. Hotel courtyard: The hotel‚Äôs own courtyard is very large, and the greenery is more beautiful than other scenic spots. On the left is the villa area, on the right is the area for helicopters and paragliders. The courtyard in the middle is also very large. You can walk to the seaside through the courtyard. The sand is very fine and the sea water is clear. Unfortunately, swimming in the sea is not allowed now. I hope that a safe swimming area can be planned at the beach and the gifts of nature will not be wasted. 8. Location: Convenient. It is a ten-minute walk to Haitang Food City, which has a variety of delicious food. There is a charging parking lot less than ten minutes' drive away, and there is a city that never sleeps nearby, a bit like a night market, with many paid entertainment facilities. The nearby Haitang Square is also beautiful. 9. The shower head is very powerful and the water flow is sufficient. 10. In short, the hotel is great and a great place for vacation! Finally, there are still many points worth exploring, and many points have not been played! come back next time!

I would like to praise Xiaoyu, the housekeeper, for responding to our requests. He first helped us upgrade our room for free, and also coordinated room changes according to our needs. When we checked in, we often asked if we needed any help and whether the items in the room needed to be replenished. Before leaving, he also helped us extend the room to 14:00: 00, let us feel the care like family during the trip. The cleaning lady on our floor, Wang Ping, was also very nice. She cleaned very well and timely. She would smile and say hello when she saw us. We stayed for several days. At first, we didn‚Äôt let her change the bedding because we thought it was too troublesome. Later, she insisted on changing the bedding for us. , not to mention, I actually slept more comfortably after changing it, haha. Auntie always gives us a few extra bottles of mineral water, and before leaving, she also gives the children shells and other small gifts, which is so thoughtful! I was worried after seeing some bad reviews before coming here, but I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. Mangrove proved itself with its strength and provided us with a great living experience!

There are also gyms, swimming pools and other places to play in the hotel. There are also many restaurants, barber shops and supermarkets. It was a very comfortable stay. I will stay there next time. The waiter on the 28th floor is really nice and answers questions patiently. The handsome guy Xu Kang is also responsible and reasonable.

msg:This hotel was carefully selected before my trip to Sanya. I checked in with high expectations and was still not disappointed! It is also my favorite hotel and I would like to go there again. Let me talk about the most surprising points:
1. Very high-quality, enthusiastic and considerate service! She was the first hotel to contact me during this trip. Our exclusive housekeeper, Ms. Olga Cai Jie, was very enthusiastic and attentive. She met her when she checked in and led her to the room. She was meticulous and timely every day after check-in. The greetings and services reflected the super high service level and made us feel very reassured and warm! It was really great to send us back and forth!
2. The hotel has beautiful garden landscape and beach. The vegetation and gardens of Haitang Bay Mangrove Resort Hotel are open and natural, and you can see the beautiful sea at a glance from a low place. The gardens and beaches are carefully maintained by staff at all times, and there are landscapes everywhere.
3. The hotel‚Äôs sailing ship design is very shocking. You can also take photos on the trip. Haitang Bay Mangrove Hotel is located in the center of Haitang City, Sanya. The sailing ship in the main building is gorgeous and elegant. It has a fashionable streamline shape and a luxurious artistic a**osphere everywhere. It is Considered one of the new landmarks of Sanya, the hotel has a total of six swimming pools. The family pool is suitable for bringing children. The surfing pool will have foreigners singing in the evening, which is full of a**osphere! There will also be a light show on the main building of the hotel at night, which is so beautiful and shocking! Next time I come, I will give priority to Sanya Haitang Bay Mangrove Resort Hotel. Thank you to Ms. Olga Cai Jie who served us during our stay!

There were also many activities for children in the hotel, and the children had a lot of fun. The room has a 180-degree view, facing Wuzhizhou Island. The sea view is very nice. You can see Wuzhizhou Island opposite from a distance. The room is also very clean and tidy. The lobby attendant is also very enthusiastic, and the hotel's photo box is also very good.

Although there was a little hiccup in the middle, it was easily resolved. The sea view room we were given was very nice, with a beautiful first-line sea view. The room facilities were also good and the sanitary conditions were good. It was similar to the top hotels in Haitang Bay. There is a gap, but the price-performance ratio is good, and it feels like a vacation! The hotel housekeeper Sumanya is very serious and responsible and has a great attitude! All service staff are very enthusiastic and responsive. We lost something and found it for us. The largest swimming pool is heated at a constant temperature. You can soak in it until ten o'clock in the evening and it won't get cold. I really like this. The travel photography provided by the hotel was very efficient. I took 15 photos in 20 minutes~

In terms of service: the staff are warm and friendly, the guy at the door is enthusiastic and proactive, and the smile at the front desk makes people feel at home. When checking in, the housekeeper provided us with a detailed introduction to the room and hotel equipment and facilities. Special thanks to EIIis for knowing my birthday on the second day. A special birthday cake was prepared, the room was decorated, and point-to-point service was provided. All my questions were answered, which made me feel very warm and comfortable.
Hotel facilities: The rooms are clean and tidy, and the beds are soft and comfortable, making me feel at home every night. Not only that, the rooms are also equipped with modern facilities, such as large-screen TVs, oversized bathtubs, free high-speed WiFi, etc.
Breakfast is also another highlight of this hotel. The food in the cafeteria has a wide variety and wonderful taste, and all the food maintains a natural taste. This allows me to be energized before traveling to find new experiences.
All in all, this hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed in and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and homely stay.

The elderly and children in my family like it here. I stay here every time I come to Haitang Bay. This trip is no exception! In the evening, my child and I went to the front desk to check in. Our exclusive little housekeeper, the beautiful Olga Xiaocai, took the initiative to contact me. Her words were gentle and considerate, and she added WeChat to inform us of various relevant information about the hotel. My child is older. If you are a child, you can spend a day in the hotel without going out to play. You don‚Äôt have to worry about mom and dad. There are plenty of parent-child activities! Olga, the full-time butler, gave us warm and attentive service, allowing us to have a pleasant time. We can also take pictures during the photo tour. The hotel has exciting entertainment projects such as helicopters and paragliders. You can see helicopters from time to time in the room. Planes and paragliders flew over, and the experience was very good! I would also like to thank Ms. Xu Yan from the housekeeping service. She thoughtfully folded the mascot on a towel and left a note for us and asked us to go back to the room after dinner. When we opened the door, we were pleasantly surprised and moved. The children especially liked the mascot! I would also like to thank the handsome guy at the concierge who was on duty today. Seeing that my child and I were women and children, he took the initiative to help me put my luggage at the entrance of the lobby and then put it into the bus. He was very discerning and did not need me to say anything. , thank you very much, but I was in a hurry and didn‚Äôt ask for my name! In short, although it is the National Day and there are many guests coming to the hotel, all the waiters in the hotel can take care of every guest with enthusiasm, making the guests very satisfied and heart-warming! We will come again later, and if we are busy, we will come during the Spring Festival at the latest! Next time I come, I will contact the exclusive housekeeper Miss Olga Cai Jie in advance. Thank you Mangrove and every employee!

msg:Forgive me for not writing a review for so long, I almost forgot, but I must take the time to write it down. This trip to Sanya is really beautiful. I made the right choice to stay in Haitang Bay. Compared with the three bays, Haitang Bay is the best. , the cleanest, most comfortable and most beautiful, suitable for vacation and leisure. Although it is far away from the city and the airport, you come out to enjoy the beauty brought by the scenery. The more lively the place, the less suitable for leisure, and the environmental sanitation is the best in Haitang Bay. Well, the location of the Mangrove Hotel is very good. It is close to the seaside. The scenery is really beautiful. Just staying in the hotel is enough. This time I brought my elders with me. They all said that it would be better to stay in the hotel than to go out for fun. I said I would like to stay there next time. If you want to stay here, the attitude of the service staff here is very good, especially the housekeeper manager Yan Zhigang. He really makes you feel at home. The cleaning is also very clean and meets your requirements as much as possible. I stayed for several days without changing hotels. It's really good. The hotel's picture box travel is also good for taking photos. I will definitely come back next time. If you have trouble with the place to stay, I recommend everyone to stay in Haitang Bay. If you have trouble with the hotel, I recommend Mangrove. Mangrove is still very good in Sanya. In addition, the hotel‚Äôs breakfast is also very rich.

It is true that there are bugs, black ants, and white bugs on the bed as mentioned in the little red book. After I came back, I was bitten and had a lot of redness and swelling on my legs.

msg:Yes, after three years of the epidemic, I returned to the Mangrove Tree Hotel in Haitang Bay, which I was thinking of. The 180-degree view of the sea balcony here is irresistible to me. sickness! Three years have passed, and this hotel has changed a lot. Apart from the invincible sea view from the balcony, the experience it gave me was not very good. The service at the EDITION Hotel is quite different from here. Staying here For three nights, there was no butler service at all. There was no butler service throughout the whole process from check-in to departure. My sister who also came on vacation was connected by the hotel's butler on the first day. She waited in the hotel lobby early, and the service was warm and thoughtful! It's like I'm not staying in the same hotel! Fortunately, I have been here to play on my own, and it‚Äôs okay. Apart from the butler service, the hardware facilities in the hotel room are also old and damaged. I can‚Äôt capture the details when taking pictures. Only the flush button can be used for the smart toilet, and the tabletop is full of stains that cannot be cleaned. Don't you want to repaint it? The vegetation in the garden is still luxuriant, and the vegetation grows naturally in many places. It has been unattended for a year by visual inspection! The wooden path in the park was also seriously damaged, and no one was repairing it. One of the elevators was broken since I checked in, and it was still not repaired until the day I left! Compared with Tianfang Intercontinental and Edison, the types of breakfast are much worse. There are few types, and the taste and texture of the food are average. For me who stayed for three nights, it was really difficult! My sister and I sighed in the same way. I hope that the mangrove forest will continue to improve. Don‚Äôt neglect the maintenance and service of the hotel. I still love this place very much. I don‚Äôt want it to be so dilapidated. I hope that I can still live in the mangrove forest every year and watch the sea for vacation. ! Here is my annual healing trip, I hope the hotel can pay attention to it!

msg:It is the sixth time to stay in the mangrove forest, and I am really moved. I come to Sanya every year, and I choose different hotels every time‚Äî‚Äîfor me, a hotel lover, the paradise of this hotel in Sanya is the city of love in my dreams. There are countless high-end hotels in Sanya, and it feels like time to stay in each hotel only once. Not enough, the experience is endless, but I am willing to give my only time to the Haitang Bay Mangrove Hotel. The mangrove is on my Sanya hotel list every year. why? Because I like this hotel so much! The design of the hotel is entirely based on my aesthetics, and the first-line sea view is the whole reason why I chose this place. The rooms of the hotel are very large, and the modern intelligent design makes people as lazy as they want, and it is completely possible to "lie flat" here. The 180¬∞ sea view is the king of Haitang Bay, truly unique! If you have lived in a sea view room in the mangrove forest, you will feel just soso if you live in other sea view rooms, it is completely incomparable. The design of the hotel is perfect, the light and shadow lobby, you can see the sea at a glance, the garden landscape is very a**ospheric, the central walkway, slowly climb up the stairs, looking up at the starry sky, you can't feel the flow of time. The garden is full of tropical plants and frangipani scattered everywhere, so beautiful! In the evening, there are performances in the lobby bar and the wave bar, enthusiastic singing, cheerful melody, and the holiday a**osphere is instantly full...I sincerely hope that this hotel will continue to prosper and get better and better, so I will evaluate it seriously every time , sincerely recommend. Last year, I commented that the butler service needs to be improved. This year, I felt the caring service from Mangrove‚Äîthe butler Xiao Xu contacted me one day in advance, added WeChat, recommended various hotel strategies and guidelines, and asked in detail about what is special Require. After check-in, the housekeeper personally guides you to the room and warmly introduces the room facilities. I already feel very good here, but I didn‚Äôt expect to feel the more heart-warming service and care from the butler Xiao Xu in the future. For example, at night, I found that there was no stool next to the bed for clothes, so I tried to ask, although it was already very late But Xiao Xu immediately helped to solve it, and sent 2 of them soon. I was really touched! Another example is that a group of us wandered around the lobby and wanted to go archery. In fact, we didn‚Äôt walk too far from the lobby. When Xiao Xu saw us, he took the initiative to ask and drove us there in a battery car. His thoughtfulness can be described as "perfect". ~ During the few days I was in Mangrove, the housekeeper, Xiao Xu, accompanied me warmly throughout the whole process, provided warm service, and responded in a timely manner, which left a very deep impression on me. I will come to the Grove Hotel again! Of course, I still want to make a few suggestions this time: 1. The hotel facilities may be a bit old due to the long period of time, and some facilities are not easy to use, such as the remote control of the bathroom toilet, a few buttons are completely invalid, and the shelf in the bathroom is placed in the green dill If the angle of inclination is too large, the pothos may fall down at any time. 2. The sanitation of the corridor needs to be improved. Some glass and walls are stained. The details determine success or failure. I hope the hotel can notice. 3. Several elevators have broken down. I don‚Äôt know if it is difficult to repair. They have been repairing for the past few days. It is very crowded during peak hours and is often fully loaded. It often takes a long time to go up. Never encountered such a situation before, the experience is very bad. 4. Many wooden trails in the garden have collapsed, and they are not often used by people. I don‚Äôt know if it was not repaired in time because they are not used often, but it looks dilapidated. 5. There is still no light show in the main building of the hotel. I don‚Äôt know if it is due to energy saving. It would be a pity if there is no light show in the future. In the end, I still love this place. I have already recommended Mangrove to many of my family and friends. This year, I came here with my sister. My sister has also stayed here many times. She fell in love with Hongshulin the first time she came here. The invincible sea view of the woods, her circle of friends these days are all mangroves... probably many people are already on the way haha! Hope the mangroves are getting better and better!

The hotel also has many rich Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day entertainment projects that are different every day. It is very enjoyable to listen to the ditty in the sea breeze at night. Comfortable.

During the off-season, we upgraded to an interstellar parent-child room for free. The butler Xiao Min‚Äôs service was very good and the response was very timely. It was like a nanny-style service. A small toy was given as a gift when checking out.

üõèÔ∏èFacilities:
The appearance of the hotel is very unique and similar to Dubai Burj Al Arab ‚õµÔ∏èThe hotel has the same designer. The parent-child room is really big. Whether it is the bathroom or the balcony, the sea view is also super good. However, it failed to live up to the sea view during the typhoon. The decoration of the room is a little simple. This is in my heart. Expectations are slightly different

I think it's normal. After all, the hotel has been around for a few years. It's within the acceptable range.

Overall it's pretty good. If the weather is good, I highly recommend booking a sea view room. It's really invincible. Friends who like squash can also book here.

The middle area outside the hotel building has a large space where a stage can be set up. When I went there, it happened to be during a promotional meeting of other companies. It was quite beautiful with the lighting at night. It has 7 outdoor swimming pools, including one for children. Since it is an outdoor swimming pool and the weather in Hainan is hot, there are many mosquitoes. It is recommended to enter the pool after the hotel has cleaned it. I didn't go to the gym, so I can't provide any further introduction.
All room types in the hotel are relatively large and have an outdoor balcony bathtub. However, it is recommended not to take a bath outside in general room types because there is a risk of exposure, but we took a bath haha~
The room is very clean and the decoration style is relatively simple. There are non-smoking and smoking floors. The basic facilities in the room are complete, the curtains are motorized, the toilet has a cleaning function, and the room buttons are basically touch-sensitive. Nice walking environment. There is also a canteen and entertainment facilities on the ba*****t floor of the hotel.
The restaurant tastes good and has a wide variety of dishes. [Service] Basic services are provided, the service attitude is good, and Hua Xia Travel is great for taking pictures. On the first day we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by staff at the door. [Value for money] In this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHainan, the price is quite cheap.

msg:Modern design, large rooms and balconies, with a sweeping view of the sea, Wuzhizhou Island opposite, with a large green landscape, great service, book the mangrove forest for the first and second nights, the hotel provides free breakfast for two children, There is also butler service. I originally booked a hotel in Sanya Bay for the third and fourth nights, but it is hard to say. After checking in to the hotel, I will contact Ctrip immediately and be sure to check out on the fourth night. I will return to Haitang Bay to book the mangrove forest. This is the proper configuration for a vacation. , Special thanks to Mr. Gao for providing very satisfactory service.
The mangroves and Atlantis reflect each other. Every night, the lights are bright and pleasing to the eye. Through the woods, it seems to be crossing the bustling streets of Song Dynasty.
Food: On the first day, I went to the food stall of the internet celebrity Sister Lin. The taste is average, the environment is average, there are many people, and the price is about 900 for 6 people. It should be the popularity brought by the Internet;
           The deepest impression of food is the red sand food stall in Haitang Bay Food City. The environment is very good, and the dishes are delicious, especially the fried crab in the typhoon shelter is really delicious and the meat is plump. The price is at the same level as other places. The hotel is about a 5-minute walk away. It is worth recommending. It is the most impressive restaurant in Hainan several times.
         The worst impression is the stalls in Sanya Bay. It still feels very messy. The prices are all at the same price or some may be more expensive. The same 88 half Wenchang chicken is mostly neck and some messy meat. The seafood is not good. Dare to order, I ordered a stir-fried clam for 120 yuan, and other seafood will weigh more than 2 catties per catty, so I quickly said no.
The prices of the above three partners are all about the same. The difference lies in the environment, cooking method, taste, and service. The overall seafood and fruit prices in Sanya are not low now, but I hope that the products and services can match the price, so that the cost performance can be reflected. come out.

I have been to Sanya so many times, the hotel rooms in Mangrove are not the most beautiful, but the service is really good. The environment of the whole hotel is also good, the lawn and the beach are good.
The hotel's breakfast is quite satisfactory, not the most amazing, but it has a complete range of categories. Thai restaurant is very authentic.
It is very close to the duty-free shop. The main purpose this time is to walk the baby and go shopping. I feel completely satisfied. There is a bus to the duty-free shop but you must make an appoin**ent in advance.
There are many swimming pools, suitable for children of different sizes.
We also met fishermen on the beach and fishing was so much fun
Finally, I would like to thank Wendy again for her caring and thoughtful service.

I didn‚Äôt expect this time to surprise me. First of all, the hardware maintenance of the room in the past four years is still good; secondly, the hotel has added a lot of parent-child programs, and the functions of each swimming pool have been differentiated. The children played water slides, paddle boards, kayaks, surfed, made pizza, and played the crane machine. There was a lucky harvest of Ultraman dolls. The room is as big as ever. The location of the hotel is very good, facing the sea. Every day when you wake up and open the curtains, you will be healed by the golden waves reflected on the sea. It is worth mentioning that Mangrove is now also using the butler system. The housekeeper Wendy Xiaochen added me on WeChat one day in advance and asked me about my check-in needs in advance. During my stay, I sent messages to Wendy for almost every major and minor matter, and she really responded in seconds and took care of it immediately. This really surprised me, because many butlers of international famous five-star hotels can‚Äôt do instant reply and instant processing . As a senior tourist who comes to Sanya every year and lives in Haitang Bay, I am impressed by Mangrove's high-quality service and perfect price/performance ratio. I may come to three brushes!

When we arrived at the mangrove, the transparent design of the hotel lobby brought a very strong sense of shock. Going down the stairs from the hall, the Central Avenue stretches to the distance, surrounded by blue sea, golden sand and green trees. The little students expressed their sincere admiration: It is really better than Atlantis! Comments on the experience of staying in these two days are as follows.
advantage:
Good service. The lady at the front desk kindly helped us upgrade the room, from the original deluxe sea view room on the 2nd-3rd floor to the 6th floor, and the room is located in the middle of the building with a good view. It is suggested that in addition to the area, the floor range should be marked in the room description, so that tourists can choose easily.
The room is large, the intelligent equipment is convenient to use, and the bathroom facilities are user-friendly. I like it very much.
Although the welcome fruits are regular apples, pears, bananas, and peaches, they are of good quality.
The bar's resident singer, DJ ‚ûïHuowu guy performed and devoted himself.
insufficient:
One bathroom door could not be closed, and the bathtub on the balcony was not plugged tightly. I wanted to take a bath while looking up at the starry sky, but I left it for 20 minutes and found that the water was only 5 cm deep. Can't help but remind me of the compulsory exam questions in elementary school, a pool, a water inlet and a water outlet, open at the same time, how long will it take to fill the pool. I used to think that there was such a strange problem, but this time I finally realized what it means to come from life. In order not to continue to waste water, I had to give up my starry sky bathing plan, referred to as plan bathing.
Compared with 5 years ago, the service in Sanya is better this time. From hotels to restaurants to online car-hailing drivers, I have experienced a sense of service. I hope that the tourism in Sanya will get better and better.

Due to the construction of the opposite government, the children did not sleep well. I told the housekeeper Xiaosu After I got here, I was changed to a c-sea view room, and I am very grateful to her. The children also enjoyed the various parent-child activities in the hotel. When they left, they said that they didn't have enough fun. If there is a chance, they will come to Haitang Bay Mangrove Forest next time.
Facilities: Oversized dressing table, equipped with children's bathrobes and toiletries, and carefully equipped with children's disposable slippers. The facilities are quite complete. On the first day of the room, there is only one Sprite and tea pie for free. Children do not drink carbonated drinks . Other facilities are not bad, but some facilities are a bit outdated, which does not affect the overall effect. The conditioner can be replaced, and everything else is not bad. There is no Starbucks Luckin Coffee nearby and I can‚Äôt order takeaways. It‚Äôs a test for me who needs a few cups of iced coffee every day. Fortunately, the room is equipped with hanging ear coffee and ice cubes can be delivered. You can make your own, and Michelle Ice City takeaway can be delivered .
Environment: c beach üèñÔ∏è 6 special swimming pools for children to play one by one, the hotel is very quiet and suitable for relaxing. It's very close to the duty-free shop. It's about 10 yuan by taxi. You can go later and it's cooler with fewer people.
Service: The hotel's own food and beverage Thai restaurant is not bad. I have eaten a few times. There is a food street near the hotel next door, KFC Pizza Hut. It takes about 20 minutes to walk there. The little brother in the concierge saw that I was very enthusiastic about driving with my child in a stroller. Take me to the side door and walk for another 3 minutes. There are many types of breakfast in the hotel to satisfy all kinds of tastes. Children who have a cold don't have much for breakfast.

Here, I would like to give a special thumbs up to the housekeeper, Sumanya, who contacted me before I checked in, and did my best to help coordinate and meet all reasonable requests, and answered every question. The downside is the air-conditioning in public spaces, especially in the elevators where there is almost no air-conditioning. The weather in Sanya is really boring. I hope it can be improved.

The Thai restaurant that my daughter never forgets, I have to check in every day after coming here, because I have not found such delicious Hele crab and yellow curry beef brisket in Beijing. What I like is the modern lobby, capable butlers, and warm service. Thanks to the housekeeper, Xiao Xu, for the afternoon tea, my daughter really likes it. Pool service is also professional. Opposite the hotel is the famous Wuzhizhou. Immediately after the epidemic ended, I came to the mangroves. We are an average working family but feel it is worth the money. The luckiest thing was that the hotel lobby saw the most beautiful sunset in the evening before Typhoon Taili came. Thank you Mangrove!

msg:Because I came to live in Mangrove in 2018, when it just opened, my husband gave it a try and was very impressed. This time I lived in Yalong Bay, Haitang Bay, Sanya Bay, and my favorite is the mangrove forest.
First of all 1. The front desk upgraded the room type for us because we are regular customers. I feel the happiness and satisfaction of being a repeat customer.
2. Compared with Shangri-La, there is no extra charge for children in Mangrove. All pool services are very good. There is even a swimming pool with a small slide for children, and a safety officer also took the initiative to teach children to swim, and was very enthusiastic. The children had a great time.
3. The decoration style of Mangrove Hotel is simple and clean, but it is different from other five-star hotels. So I think young people should come here if they don't pursue room furniture etc. The room is big and bright.
4. The only difficulty is: the breakfast is indeed not the best among all the hotels I stayed in. There is a gap between the style and Shangri-La.
5. Haitang Bay is not as convenient as Sanya and Yalong Bay for eating, but there are fewer people and it is clean.
6. Every time I leave the mangrove, I feel like I've lost my love, haha. Because what we love is not only the sea, but also freedom and the time spent with our family wholeheartedly.
7. This is a completely voluntary review. I hope to come back in a few years. The mangrove forest is still so good.

The next time I stay, I will still choose the Mangrove Hotel.

It will be more beautiful to see the sea on a sunny day! Opposite is Wuzhizhou Island, you can see Wuzhizhou Island lying on the bed! As soon as we arrived at the hotel, the staff helped us with our luggage. There was also a Ms. Yang who kept bringing our luggage to the room, and patiently explained the various functions of the room. Like it very much! Hotel service is very good!

It is very good to see the sea view from the mangroves in the hotel in Haitang Bay. Open the curtains every day to see the sea view in front of you, as if you are on the scene. It takes about ten minutes to walk to the beach. The hotel's landscaping and greening landscape are good, and it looks like a vacation. My butler Lin Zhihao's service is also very good. He followed up with my service throughout the whole process. Overall, this experience is very good. I will still choose it next time.

msg:Come to Sanya for 5 days for honeymoon, Yalong Bay for 2 nights, and Haitang Bay for 2 nights. Haitang Bay chose this because they really like their sailboat shape, and booked a 180 sea view double bed room. We had an unpleasant dispute over breakfast food on the check-out day of the previous hotel, so halfway through the trip, my husband got gastroenteritis and had a fever for 2 days. On the night of staying in the Haitang Bay Mangrove Forest, we went to the emergency depar**ent of the 301 Hospital. I was very touched and heartwarmed by the hotel's care for us. Although the environment of a certain hotel in Yalong Bay in the previous home is more luxurious, and the housekeeper and MOD speak high-soundingly, but they have a cold-blooded attitude in dealing with customer problems, and bullying us outsiders will be treated coldly if they don‚Äôt make trouble. It formed a huge contrast with the two-night caring experience of this Haitang Bay mangrove.
      Xiao Xu, the butler of the mangrove forest, is very caring. Before checking in, he called us to ask if we had any needs. They also arranged our honeymoon in advance. We didn't go out of the room very much during the period, and we had many questions about the hotel, and we were able to answer them patiently in a timely manner.
      Thanks to the care, my little pregnant woman accompanied my husband to see a doctor on the first night. It was after 9 o'clock in the evening and I hadn't eaten for 10 hours. She offered to show me the menu on WeChat, and asked me to order first on the way back and eat it when I returned to the hotel.
      The duty manager learned of our misadventures on this trip. On the second day, the manager Xiao Gao and the housekeeper Xiao Xu took the initiative to care about the situation of my husband and me. Because my husband couldn't eat anything at the buffet breakfast, they prepared white porridge for him later and hot milk for me, a pregnant woman.
       This trip to Sanya left a lot of regrets, 1 day in the hospital, 2 days my husband was resting in bed with a fever, and every day I complained about the irresponsible bad hotel. Atlantis and many attractions did not go. Therefore, the mangrove hotel has such a beautiful environment, and I didn't take my husband to visit it, and basically spent it in the door. So if you come next time, you must come here again! Make up for regrets.
     Both the cleanliness of the rooms and the environment of the hotel are impeccable. I like their cool elevators haha, and on the last day when I was bored in the hotel, I went to experience the travel photography in the hotel. The effect is really good. Take me to see it The beautiful beach in the hotel, the net red swimming pool, and the dense coconut grove.
     Our husband and wife sincerely thank Haitang Bay Mangrove Hotel for its care and service, and the services of the two hotels we stayed in are also in contrast. This employee doesn't have many high-sounding words, but they really use practical actions to provide service with heart, and put customer experience first. This is the real heart-to-heart comparison! Treat each other with sincerity. The 2 of us who stay at home can also have a good check-in experience.
    Finally, I would like to thank the manager Xiao Gao, the housekeeper Xiao Xu, and the lovely room aunt, for taking care of my husband and recovering on the third day. On the last day, we can also have a good breakfast. The variety is very rich, clean and hygienic ~ the wontons are delicious üòã (I eat for 1 person and make up for 2 people haha)
     There is also travel photography service! Everyone, don't give up the beautiful view of the coconut grove in the hotel! It's worth it, there are many services that exceed expectations here. üëçüèª

Fortunately, after completing the check-in procedure, a classmate Xiao He who claimed to be the hotel housekeeper came towards me. Take the initiative to introduce hotel facilities. When I learned that I was staying at this hotel for the first time. Tell the leader to apply for a fruit plate. The second breakfast is the food stalls in the staff canteen. Everyone said: This hotel is a bit like the county magistrate's brother-in-law's project. This hotel on the National Gold Coast is a desecration of Haitang Bay. Fishing in troubled waters.

In short, this stay was very pleasant, and both adults and children had a great time.

The price is relatively cheap... When I wanted to place an order, I found out that there was a set meal! Only 1299 includes double buffet breakfast and dinner! This price is really nothing to lose! Let's talk about breakfast first! There are many styles of breakfast! There are many types of drinks! And it tastes good too! Compared with dinner, it is not as good as breakfast! Maybe the price of 1299 is not enough to buy too many precious ingredients... But I believe that if the hotel can do its own maintenance and value-added... let alone 2299.. Even 3299 will often be full...

I booked a twin-bed parent-child room, and I went in the off-season. The hotel concierge Kobayashi upgraded the Star Alliance duplex room, with a big bed upstairs and twin beds downstairs. It is recommended to add a concierge, so that you can reply quickly if you have any questions. Hotel facilities are relatively simple. The viewing angle of the sea is quite good.

Special recommendation:
1. The viewing effect is very good, the balcony is super large, the viewing field is excellent, and the balcony also has a large-sized swimming pool.
2. The layout and lighting of the room are particularly good.
3. The powered glider has a full sense of experience, and you can have a panoramic view of Haitang Bay and Wuzhizhou Island.
4. Good service and high cost performance.
To be improved:
1. Toiletries, especially shampoo and shower gel are too much.
2. The hardware facilities are slightly outdated, and the shower head can be properly cleaned or replaced.
3. There are few leisure and entertainment facilities.
4. No welcome service.

Overall, it is highly recommended. In front of the invincible balcony and sea view, everything else is acceptable, and the most important thing is that the price/performance ratio is very high.

I‚Äôve stayed in all the hotels in Haitang Bay and I can only wait in line to send him upstairs. The guy who sent me upstairs is like a ruffian. The room has been renovated, and the porcelain scraping and magnetic powder are all over the room. There are bathtub mirrors all over the room. The handrail glass is all the color of the floor. In fact, these are secondary service awareness, which is the most important thing. When I drove to the lobby, the doorman did not open the door for the guests. There was no greeting or smile. It was as if everyone must stay in this hotel. During my stay, there was only cleaning. The aunt gave me two smiles. As for the housekeeper, needless to say. She was like a robot, as if the copywriting was all edited. After putting forward her feelings after staying, it was like opening the lid of Tianling. I suddenly realized that admitting shortcomings but not correcting them would be the worst hotel in the future. Formal policy. I have stayed in dozens or hundreds of five-star hotels at home and abroad. Only Haitang Bay Mangrove Forest has given me such a bad review. I will never stay there again in my life. Friends who see this comment can use the picture as a reference and will not post it again. I'm not in the mood to take pictures and I don't want to waste time looking for these shortcomings because they are all shortcomings.

The corridor on our floor felt a bit deserted. The paint on the door of the room has peeling spots. Old, old.
The thing I want to complain about the most is the gym. It's not in the building. It takes three or four minutes to walk out to the small house next to it. A very small room. There are no barbells or iron plates in the gym. A small dumbbell rack, the heaviest dumbbell on it is only 20 kilograms, which is really not enough. The only equipment for strength training is rowing and seated chest presses. As a 5-star hotel, the gym hardware is terrible. Brothers who have fitness needs, choose carefully.
The travel photos I received as a gift turned out to be ugly, so I had to deal with them. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt feel it.

This hotel lives up to its name, the entire appearance is a "tree üå≤", the environment is beautiful, the trees are shaded, especially the parking scale on the 33rd floor of the viewing platform, overlooking the panorama of Sanya at a glance... It's really amazing.

The breakfast is also very rich. It is worth recommending Hainan coconut rice, fried dough sticks, and Hainan rice noodles. It would be even better if there is salmon for breakfast in the future.

The hotel's service is very considerate and super humane. The butler manager Yan Zhigang will greet you intimately on the second morning of your stay. Yan Zhigang's service is very proactive, caring and meticulous. When he knew that I wanted to visit the shutdown scale, he would arrange my itinerary in advance and take pictures for me. When I learned that I have a hotel travel photo shoot, they will also help me meet the travel photo shoot queue and help me arrange everything properly. There was also a small episode where I left my sunglasses in the travel photography office, and I was eating outside. Zhigang will take the initiative to help me get the glasses and send them to the concierge depar**ent. Such a butler is really great!

Hotel travel photography is also good, the hotel will send five electronic photos for free. The Jinmu photographer who helped me take pictures is very hardworking and worthy of praise.

In addition, the view from the balcony of the room is simply beautiful. The blue sea is in the distance of the coconut grove. Occasionally, a helicopter flies by, overlooking Wuzhizhou Island...

In addition, the service of Xiao Zhang at the concierge is also good. I think I will visit this treasure five-star hotel in Haitang Bay next time.

When the mangrove was under construction, I was guessing such a large scale The positioning of the hotel must be the seven-star sailing boat. The result of checking in last night was really shockingüò±. I have basically experienced more than half of the hotels in Haitang Bay. I didn‚Äôt expect such a bad hotel to appear in Haitang Bayüì£, even if you use it The big-name designer plus the famous artist can't stand the construction of the rumored county magistrate's brother-in-law. I have never seen such a shoddy project, and it is not even as good as the economic chain hotel under Huazhu. I am not exaggerating, because I am a designer by profession. I will not talk about the professional details. My cousin who is in the same business as a layman rarely goes out and exclaims that the interior decoration of this hotel is worse than the staff dormitory in his factory. My 6-year-old child said that he is particularly afraid of the corridors of their guest rooms. Softened, there is a serious echo, listening to all kinds of noisy sounds in the corridor in the room feels like sleeping in a bridge hole, the toiletries are also quite low-end, all the gaps in the bathroom countertop are moldy, and the bedside socket is loose and cannot be plugged in at all First, the phone is broken, the smart switch is not working, and the bathroom light turns off by itself. I observed it and it seems that there is a sensor. This is the first time I have seen a sensor in a hotel bathroom. Imagine that your toilet is halfway down and suddenly it is completely black What is it like? The light *****s in the elevator are all bursting beads, and the elevator room in the parking lot feels like a civil air defense project. My cousin said that if the team meeting hotel costs 500 yuan, this feeling is acceptable, but the room price is more than 1200-2000. There is a feeling of being treated as a countryman, so I am very objective to comment, Haitang Bay Mangrove is only suitable for teams or meetings, but if you have a little knowledge and requirements for the hotel, even if you are a full-season Home Inn member, you Don‚Äôt come here to step on the thunder. I inquired with friends in the hotel circle. They said that the owner of the mangrove forest thought it was very good. He didn‚Äôt think there was any problem at all. Below are some incredible photos I took casually with my mobile phone. Everyone reference it

Look at the picture, I don't want to complain. The whole hotel is gloomy. Our room is at the end of a corridor, next to a greenery, and there is no one in the next room. It is really scary. The hallway is dark and the lights are dim, that's all it is. The black and red style hallway you decorated is to scare who? There are very few people in the whole hotel. On the first day of check-in, there were activities. It seems that there are more people. I have met people twice after going up and down the elevator so many times. The balcony door didn't work well and I had to find the staff twice. Later, I didn't dare to open it directly to avoid it being unusable. If you want service, there is no service. If you want to order a meal in the room, you can't even scan the QR code. All in all very poor price doesn't match everything. It's too much. Definitely not next time.

Service:: Concierge Kobayashi has a very good service attitude. He has provided us with service since the order was placed by Ctrip. He is very patient. We stayed for three nights and asked what we needed the next day. After check-in, we also sent snacks and fruits. If there is a problem Help out soon.

Environment:: The environment of the hotel is quite good. There are many coconut groves where you can take pictures, so you don‚Äôt need to go to the Coconut Dream Corridor. Maybe due to low season and cold weather, some swimming pools are not open.

Facilities: The bathroom is quite big, and the mirror is very good, so it‚Äôs easy to take pictures^_^. Since the partition is made of log-colored wood, it may feel that it is not a**ospheric enough. It is a good choice for those who like the log style.

msg:This is the first time to travel after the epidemic. It is really a challenge to bring our three-year-old son alone. Fortunately, the Mangrove Hotel provides a variety of thoughtful services and activities, which made our entire hotel experience exceed our expectations.
Before departure, Xiao Xu, the caring hotel housekeeper, contacted me by phone and WeChat, and helped me arrange the room according to my needs. Later, because of the flight delay, I specially helped to arrange to reserve the room for reception. When I checked in, I even gave the children lovely gifts. He is very careful and patient to help children book parent-child activities, so that we can have fun and rest assured. During the stay, Xiaofan, who cleaned the room, also provided us with very attentive service. The doll folded the towels and gave us beautiful conch shells. The children liked it very much.
On the day of departure, because the flight was delayed again, the customer service of the concierge depar**ent also helped to properly store the luggage and send the express, which made it very easy for us to spend the extra time.
It is especially worth mentioning the hotel's rich parent-child activities and beautiful scenic beaches. The activities are different every morning and afternoon. There are hands-on activities, relaxed group competitions, and knowledge classes. There will be small prizes for winners, which are very interesting. You can also choose activities at your own expense according to your preferences. Unfortunately, my children are too young to experience the fun of some activities. The hotel itself also has a parent-child playground activity area, and a claw machine rocking chair. When the sun is hot and the temperature is high, indoor play is also a good choice.
The scenery of the beach is nothing to say, whether it is overlooking from the hotel room or standing barefoot by the sea, the blue sea, the gentle sea breeze, the yellow sand, and the white waves, my son and I happily dig the sand and pick up shells, so that the children can truly touched the vastness of the sea.
The food part was not disappointing, the buffet breakfast was rich and fresh, and the Thai food included in the package was also light and delicious. The surprise is the internet celebrity delicacy in the hotel. It‚Äôs really fresh and tender coconut chicken cooked in the coconut milk of three coconuts. My son‚Äôs favorite is all kinds of coconut milk. They are very fresh and sweet, and I can‚Äôt stop drinking them. .
Summary: It was really a pleasant and memorable trip worth recommending!

The service is enthusiastic. The butler zero added WeChat to inquire about the needs in advance, and followed up with inquiries every day, and also took the initiative to help fill up the small bar.
The breakfast is quite rich, except that the croissants and Danish pastries are not authentic enough (in fact, I haven't eaten Danish pastries with the same taste as Denmark in China), and other things are remarkable. A lot of stir-fried dishes should be very suitable for Chinese stomachs. Salads are relatively fresh.
The bedding is very good, better than that of Atlantis, it feels close to Ritz, and the quilt of Atlantis has a strong duck feather smell.
The room is quite big, the facilities are good, and the sound is very good.
The buffet grilled oysters in the evening were replenished in a timely manner. The price/performance ratio in Haitang Bay is still good, the cake is slightly weaker, which is the usual weakness of this domestic hotel management group.
The travel photography service provided by the hotel was unexpectedly good, and then I bought a few more, and I was very patient with the finishing touches. The facilities in the hotel are quite complete, such as squash, archery, courtball... there are paragliders and so on. Mineral water and mosquito repellent are placed next to each facility. It is very suitable for vacation without going out of the hotel for two days. Although there are many parents and children, it will not be very noisy. The lobby is airy but has few seats.

The rooms are spacious with lots of space. There are many experience activities in the hotel. This time I went to experience surfing. The coach explained it in detail and patiently. The hotel's Thai food tastes good and the price is moderate, and it is very close to the Global 68 Food City next door. And thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Xu for arranging a room on the 17th floor for us. Overall very satisfied.

Before departure, the housekeeper will take the initiative to communicate with you by phone. After arriving at the hotel, the housekeeper Xiao Wang immediately appeared and took us to the room. We introduced the entertainment items in the hotel, and also gave afternoon tea to the children. The service is very considerate. The room is large in size, you can see the sea view, and the temperature of the air conditioner is also suitable. There are 6 outdoor swimming pools in the hotel, two of which are especially suitable for children. There are slides and rowing boats. It takes about 6 minutes to walk from the room to the beach. The sea water is blue. The sand is also relatively fine, and the hotel also prepares sand digging tools, which the children love so much! There are also parent-child activities every day. We participated in coconut picking and crab catching. It is a very suitable hotel for parents and children. Next time we will choose Haitang Bay Mangrove.

Every time I come to Sanya, I have to stay at Mangrove. The first time I came, the hotel just opened, and the feeling when I entered the lobby was really good. I have stayed in several hotels in Haitang Bay. In terms of cost performance, the mangrove forest is still very good. Although not as new as before. It's still very sweet down to everything. The room is big, especially the bathroom. Very recommended. The sea-view balcony facing the sea, in Haitang Bay, should be cherished. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Figure 4-6 The cleaning and tidying is too careless. Warm reminder that there are three sheets, two of which are reversed.
Picture 7 The quilt on the bed gave me a surprise, what is this? Have you changed it? Have you washed it?
Finally, talk about the whole. Okay, I know this time is special, the room is more expensive, I understand that the real picture does not match the real thing when you enter the door, what the hell. It‚Äôs cold in Sanya these two days. I want to turn on the warm air. The air conditioner doesn‚Äôt have this function. I called the service center and told me, well, we don‚Äôt have warm air, only cold air! Is the five-star hotel listed? How to achieve this goal? Before booking with Ctrip, ask Ctrip to negotiate whether the extra bed in the hotel can be free, and tell you that you can't, and the attitude is extremely strong! Well, I understand that during the three years of the epidemic, it is no problem that many people want to make money during the Chinese New Year, but their attitudes are extremely bad. By the way, when it comes to attitude issues, let me mention that the check-in service staff at the front desk can't speak well. I booked a villa, which is not cheap to be honest. I chose Mangrove because I want to live these days. There is no room type we want to live in. Because the hotels in Haitang Bay that bring dogs are relatively limited, the two rooms that can bring dogs are not available in these two Rosewood. I chose a detached house in the mangrove forest, but the experience was really bad.

msg:This time I upgraded to a sea view room, just in time for two good weather, the view is amazing. In addition, the most satisfying thing is that the hotel has made a lot of efforts to reduce the queuing time. I called one day in advance to ask about the arrival time. Because the check-out time is usually 12 o'clock, the mangrove tree is very friendly. If so, do it in advance. We arrived around 12 o'clock on the day of check-in. Although there are no vacant rooms, we can check in first, leave our luggage with the concierge, and then we can go to eat. We can enter the room when we receive a call before we finish eating. Perfect connection. The point is that there is basically no need to wait in line for such a diversion, and it will be done as soon as it arrives, without any delay.
Let‚Äôs talk about the room facilities. The area is relatively large, and the style and layout meet the needs of young people. Less than half of the area is in the bathroom. The balcony is very wide and feels more than 6 meters. The tea table and bathtub are still more than half empty, full of sunshine. The disadvantage is that the water is a bit weak, the washbasin is easy to splash on the body, the toilet is too water-saving, people who have the habit of throwing toilet paper into the toilet need to flush it several times, and the hand-held shower is also a bit small. Moreover, there are many swimming pools but the size is very small, and there are many people who dare not go to the constant temperature pool.
Finally, I really like the welcome fruit on the first day and the little crab on the bed, so cute~

The location of the hotel is very close to the duty-free shop, about 15 yuan by taxi, and there is also Universal Food City, which has all the characteristics of Hainan, and it takes 15 minutes to walk. All in all, the overall experience is good, and I will come again next time

I said that I have work in a while The personnel came to share the room, and no one came after checking out...
Environment: The building is novel, but the interior is very bad. It is as deserted as an office building. The interior of the house is very cheap, not as good as a chain hotel. Everywhere is rough, as if it is not finished... Please believe the bad reviews, I just don't believe it I just stepped on mine! ! ! Don‚Äôt trust Internet celebrity pictures and Xiaohongshu, it‚Äôs really bad, not worth more than a thousand
Hygiene: Needless to say, there is nothing to say about the hygiene. I dare not use their things. The sofa is so dirty that I dare not sit on it! ! ! It‚Äôs really a big gap from Ritz, and it‚Äôs not much difference. It‚Äôs a completely different feeling.

msg:Staying at the Mangrove Tree Hotel in Haitang Bay this time has completely refreshed my perception. I lived there once in the second year after it opened, and it has been five years since the service and facilities have been greatly upgraded. The hotel housekeeper Xiao Wang called the day before check-in and learned that we have children and the elderly, so we prepared children's products and toys for the children in advance, bed enclosures and welcome mosaic, and combined the twin rooms into a king-size bed. The bathroom for the elderly is covered with non-slip mats, which are too thin. We made an embarrassing request to upgrade the room to a better one, and readily agreed to directly upgrade to a 180-degree sea view room. The disposable cotton slippers are so comfortable and look like made of rex rabbit fur. There is also a smart toilet with a super-large makeup mirror that makes my wife feel very comfortable. Satisfied, I want two bottles of water to be delivered directly. This price/performance ratio is ridiculously high! I am a person who likes to eat breakfast, and I actually ate meat buns at his house. The fried dumplings are also delicious. The noodles made with beef and coconut chicken soup are even more delicious. There is a bucket of ice next to the freshly squeezed juice, which is fine! The little brother on the beach also wanted me to give the hotel some advice. absolutely not. If I have to mention it, the sun in the breakfast room is too glaring, and it's good to have some shade, but that's not a problem for the overall feeling. When going to Haitang Bay in the future, mangroves must be the first choice!

We booked a room one week in advance, and the housekeeper Xiao Mo contacted us one day in advance. During the communication process, he helped us upgrade the room type for free, and also prepared children's toiletries for the little one. Although we are not a children's room, it is still worth considering that there are children staying in the room. We arranged a cute kt cat shape with petals, and the welcome ceremony was full!

While we were waiting for check-in, the front desk also presented the baby with a hotel mascot doll. In addition to the welcome fruit provided by the package, because there were two little babies, Xiao Mo also presented our dessert afternoon tea, and the adults followed the baby. Enjoy. Paul's Meal Kitchen also helps us heat up our baby's meals, just sign a disclaimer. All aspects of the hotel services are very good.

Let's talk about the room, the view is excellent, and the photos are well taken. My friend Dou and I quite like the personal photos taken with the view from the balcony of the room. Of course, the countless swimming pools and the seaside downstairs are also excellent photo spots. It is not too fun to take children to play in the water. If you are tired of playing with the rocking horse on the M floor, you can also free parents' hands.

Personally, I feel that it is the best choice to travel to Haitang Bay and stay in a hotel. The breakfast is rich and the freshly baked waffles are the best. Come back after a while, I hope to meet the caring butler Mo again.

Regardless of the invincible sea view during the day or the charming lights at night, you can feel the comfort of vacation. The configuration of the room is five-star standard, only the toilet, Harman Kardon's bluetooth audio, especially the balcony panoramic bathtub, all add a lot of color. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the service. The housekeeper Xiaoyu is very satisfied with the whole tracking service from departure to the end of the trip. Because it is my birthday and wedding anniversary, the room is specially arranged and a birthday cake is presented. All in all, an unforgettable holiday here

The room I booked was a 180-degree sea view room. Very comfortable. There are several swimming pools in the hotel. At this stage, due to the epidemic situation, there are not many people, and it is pleasant to play. The breakfast is also good. In addition, the service staff of the hotel are very good and have a strong sense of service. I will choose to stay here next time.

msg:For the first time in Sanya, I felt trapped because I chose this hotel because of a misstep. Photo deception is really a beauty filter many times over. I spent the money of a five-star hotel and stayed in an express hotel. This is my most direct feeling. Poor quality decoration, full of dust and debris, it feels like living in an unfinished site, the walls and paint in the room are peeling off, the floating dust on the walls is not wiped clean, and all the seats are unwashable. Clean stains, as well as rusted hair dryers and desk clocks. Even more frightening is the restaurant, the floor and countertops seem to have not been cleaned for several years, there are oil stains everywhere, and the dining tables and chairs are old like antiques. Not to mention breakfast, there is no richness at all. It is estimated that those who come to live here feel trapped. In addition, public areas such as corridors seem to never be cleaned and are covered with dust and spider silk. I especially regret that I felt so bad when I checked in that day and didn't check out directly.

After I called and responded, I said that I would fix it the next day. I also called the house supervisor the next day to confirm that it had been repaired, but when I came back at night, it still leaked and could not hold water. The main reason for this hotel is that it can't be used, it affects the holiday mood too much! Only 2 of the 7 or 8 swimming pools are open.

msg:The second stop of the tour, Haitang Bay
This tour belongs to the kind of pure vacation. I don't go to any scenic spots, just look at the sea, blow the wind, and don't play water sports;
The hotel as a whole met my expectations, the 180-degree sea view room was great, really-sea view room;
The hotel is very close to the beach. The overall quality of the Haitang Bay beach is still very good, ranking second in my heart; it is also easy to produce pictures (and wedding photos)
The architectural design of the hotel is very unique, more iconic than Atlantis
Before checking in, the housekeeper Xiao Xu contacted me in advance, which must be praised!
The sea view is really good, you can see the photos I took (üì∑: sony a7m4 ‚ûï2470GM2)
Overall, a great experience!
The fly in the oin**ent is that the equipment in the hotel room is a bit old and the socket is a bit loose (my room is like this, but it doesn't hurt)

There are clean towels prepared by the staff by the pool, and the service is particularly considerate. The fruit takeaway ordered that night was taken by someone by mistake.

msg:When the epidemic came to Sanya, I lived in the mangroves of Yalong Bay. Because I have been to Yalong Bay too many times, I will try Haitang Bay this time. Because the hotel is relatively new in Haitang Bay, the whole decoration will be much higher than the mangroves in Long Bay. There are two types of rooms: full sea view and villa. Both have their own advantages. Although the villa is large and has its own private swimming pool, it does not have a wide view of the sea view room. In order to ensure privacy, it is far from the lobby, but fortunately there are battery cars to pick up and drop off.
It was Manager Xu who received us that day. The service was very professional, and he introduced the advantages and disadvantages of various room types to us very objectively. Any problems during our stay in the past few days can be solved quickly for usüëçüëçüëçüëç
It is a little regrettable that before I came to Haitang Bay, I did not know that swimming is not allowed here. Although the waves are not particularly big, I heard that there are undercurrents. If you must swim in the sea, you need to take a car to Houhai, which is about a quarter of an hour's drive. It's not very friendly for people like me who want to soak in the sea as soon as I step out of the hotel room. But the Haitang Bay Mangrove Hotel itself is really good. Next time I come back, I will ask Manager Xu to introduce us to try other room types ü§≠

Every room in the mangrove forest is facing the sea view. The room is very large, with a large balcony and a large bathtub on the balcony. The facilities are complete and the service is thoughtful. When I went to Atlantis the next day, I realized that the mangroves were really good. No one would carry your luggage with you when I went to Atlantis, and there was no service. I went to my room by myself, and all the rooms had side sea views. It will definitely be a must-choice hotel next time.

This is done by MGM. It's very caring, but the front desk Xiaozhan's free upgrade service is very good~ After leaving the store, Kelly called back to visit the check-in experience. The dog needs more bath towels. The waiter brother is very patient and helps us deliver bathrobes over and over again. Thank you very much.

msg:The epidemic has had a great impact on Sanya's tourism industry. There are a lot fewer tourists than the last time, less noise, and more tranquility. You can take a quiet and immersive vacation, take photos, and Manager Xu in the lobby taught me There are several photo spots, and the results are really good, especially the industrial style of the lobby. In the absence of people, it definitely feels like a large film. Unfortunately, it has always been rainy and cloudy recently. Can't take pictures, the light and shadow effect of the sun shining directly on the lobby. Because of the epidemic, breakfast was changed from buffet to meal delivery mode, saving us the trouble of lazy people who don't want to go downstairs to eat. The room hygiene is also good. The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel may seize the off-season of the epidemic and upgrade some hotel equipment, so the lawn buildings are not photographed.

msg:After living in the mangroves, I felt like I was looking for trouble.
The housekeeper called one day in advance to confirm the arrival time and room type, arrived on time at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and told me that the hygiene was not good. At this time, I was given a sea view room to rest for a while.
     At 3:30, I was taken to the reserved 270-degree sea view room, but the photos on the reservation were different (later I went to see and added two photos, the first photo was only the open room, that is, the open room on the 27th floor. Type 270 sea view room, there is no partition and living room, and there is a large balcony) The room type in the photo is obviously only one room type, and several rooms with similar angles are grouped into one room type, isn‚Äôt it just selling dog meat to consumers. Girlfriend was a little unhappy and asked to change rooms.
(I did show me the room at first, and I thought it was fine.) Then the front desk upgraded me to a one-bedroom villa 8619. I thought there would be no problem, bathroom: watch the video, TV cabinet: the lock on the top is broken, pull it out and almost hit the whole fan on the head (this is a very big safety hazard for women or children). Bed: The bed in the villa is not as comfortable as the bed in the ordinary room, accompanied by creaking noise, and the power supply voltage of the socket on the side of the bedside table is very weak, and the mobile phone cannot be charged. At this time, there is no energy to change the room type at around five or six o'clock. There are mirrors on the walls on both sides of the room. I haven't rested well all night, and I have nigh**ares (it's my personal reason)
      The thing that shocked me the most was the breakfast the next day. I was allergic to small shrimp and couldn‚Äôt eat small shrimp. The wontons here are all boiled in water with the ingredients and put in a bowl with soup. I asked the waiter if I could have a bowl of wontons without shrimp skins. The waiter told me in a very embarrassing way. . Maybe I'm too picky. After all, eating a bowl of wontons will not lose a piece of meat. If you must eat, it may be too difficult for the hotel, and it seems that I am making things difficult.
     After breakfast, you can ask for the sea view and the facilities to be in good condition. Finally arrived at the 180-degree sea view king bed room at the terminal of this stay. Stayed in four rooms for two nights.
     
üßπHygiene: It is one of the few advantages, clean and tidy
üçÉEnvironment: The aging of facilities is serious, and many damages are not repaired in time
üîîService: The concierge is understaffed, the front desk is very patient

Summary: Thanks to Sanya Haitang Bay Mangrove Resort Hotel, I have added a battle and game with the hotel in Haitang Bay, which has nothing to do with it. Friends who like to play games and clear the customs from the beginning can consider staying. Not suitable for parents, couples, friends. The suitable crowd should be middle-aged and elderly tour groups. The Thai food downstairs is delicious. There are problems in hotel management, hotel facilities and a series of problems. When I was reading, I didn't write about the experience of staying in this hotel.

üçÉEnvironment: The mangrove forest is very famous. It was the first time I stayed, and the environment was average. The hardware configuration of the hotel did not reach five stars, the details were too poor, and the hotel's breakfast had too few types. I didn't expect breakfast every day, and the ingredients were not good. The decoration details are too poor, including many things are rusted, it is the first time to stay in a hotel that I want to complain about.
üßπHygiene: The person who cleans the room will not make up for the shower gel that I use every day. After staying for five consecutive nights, I have to call for delivery, which is not up to the standard of a five-star hotel.
üîîService: The service staff in the hotel chess and card room is too slow. After the private room is opened, they will no longer care about us! The night before check out, I called to ask about my post-housing experience. I was not very satisfied and even sent afternoon tea.
We will not move in again in the future. We booked 3 rooms for 5 nights for more than 3,000 a night during the Chinese New Year, which is not recommended at all.

On the day of check-in, Xiao Wang arrived at the hotel at 5 o‚Äôclock and made a room upgrade for me. Then I arranged some children‚Äôs furnishings in the room, including hats and school bags that I must bring when I go out. As the typhoon landed on that day, the storm had been violent and rainy outside, so we had to stay indoors. I stayed, I didn‚Äôt expect that after a while, the bell rang and the waiter brought afternoon tea. Seeing this afternoon tea set, I was about to say that I was going to the lobby bar to sit for a while, and I really went to my heart; all the services In my opinion, the details are all meticulous and silent; meeting such a king made me feel very good about mangroves for the first time; as a former landscape architect, I also took a good look at this A piece of work, I know this is the director‚Äôs hotel work; the people-oriented concept is very thorough, the rain can be heard in the lobby, but the operation function is lacking, and the water will leak if the rain is heavy; but in my opinion, this is not bad Feel the unique natural fusion; the entire building is very irregular, with arc-shaped elements everywhere, but the steel plate material will become rotten, which is not good in the eyes of the older generation, so it is necessary to refuel in engineering maintenance; Most of the unpowered systems used in children's equipment are very close to this design. The first time I stayed in, I felt super five-star, and I hope to do better. I also wish Xiao Wang an early achievement of his life and career goals.

For example, the young lady from Xinjiang at the front desk did not have a room when I arrived and needed to wait, but it was inconvenient for me to carry large and small luggage, so I was refreshed to upgrade to a 180-degree ocean view room, which is super awesome. Because the floors are high, the scenery is very good. Of course, I also hope that the hotel can renovate the details carefully. The decoration company feels really unreliable, hahahahaha

msg:The Haitang Bay Mangrove Forest has clocked in for the second time. This time, the business of the hotel has added several projects, including Marvel's experience store and Marvel-themed clearing bar. It is suitable for bringing children and friends over to clock in. The small lobby The newly added projects recommended by Xu are quite good. The coconut chicken is also delicious. Because Marvel is still in the promotion period, Xiao Xu gave me some coupons, which are really good. It is worthwhile to see the light show in the Rice Park, which is very large and not expensive. The reason for coming to the hotel again is that the mangrove equipment is relatively advanced, the white color looks neat and clean, and the epidemic prevention work is well done. Service is in place

Whether it's reading the itinerary code at the gate or the enthusiastic brothers in the lobby handing out masks, all of them can see the hotel's intentions.

When you get off the plane, you must have a 48-hour nucleic acid test certificate. I checked the itinerary code and fitness code. Fortunately, Peter contacted me one day in advance and told me all the requirements of Sanya epidemic prevention and control, which made my trip go smoothly. After arriving at the hotel, there are also enthusiastic little brothers wearing red ribbons to distribute masks to the guests without masks, which makes people feel particularly at ease.

Although the hotel has already reminded me, staying in a sea-view room is to rest in a quiet and comfortable environment. Encountered this situation and the result was noisy, I personally think that the hotel should give the affected guests a discount.

msg:This is the second time I have come to Sanya to stay in the mangroves of Haitang Bay. The sea is outside the window, and the Wuzhizhou Island on the opposite side can be overlooked from the house. The scenery is really beautiful! Thanks to the waiter Rex, who helped us attentively and thoughtfully. On the first day, I was in a hurry to check in. I chose a low-floor room. The next day Rex helped us upgrade the high-floor ocean view room, set up the honeymoon room, and prepared delicious food. Fruits and refreshments are really great! The room‚Äôs oversized bathroom really surpasses all other hotels I‚Äôve stayed in. The night view is beautiful, and the open-air swimming pool and beach behind the hotel are really pleasant for a walk. It is very close to Sanya International Duty Free City and Atlantis, and there is 68 Haitang Food Street 400 meters away, which is very convenient. The only hotel on this trip where I stayed for 4 days. I hope to make persistent efforts and do better on the basis of maintaining a consistent level of service.

In fact, only when you enter, you can get a sense of vision. Others are really nothing good. It's the same as an ordinary business travel hotel. It's just that it's on the seaside in Sanya. The surrounding shops are quite expensive and too commercial.

msg:After the National Day, I stayed at the Haitang Bay Mangrove Hotel. I was a bit nervous after I got a lot of complaints before leaving. After I checked in, I found that the worry was completely unnecessary. The overall experience is still very good. Let‚Äôs talk about my personal feelings in various aspects:
1. Price-performance ratio: Five-star, purchased hotel package, less than 1000 people stay in a 180-degree superior ocean view room, butler will upgrade to a 180-degree parent-child room for free, and late check-out

2. Service: five-star, one-to-one butler service, butler kenny service is very good, I added WeChat the day before check-in, asked about various preferences, and presented welcome fruits and snacks, which is very rich. Including from the hotel staff, it can be seen that the hotel attaches great importance to the quality of service

3. Location: 4 and a half stars, in the middle of Haitang Bay, there is 68 Food City next to it on foot, with restaurants and supermarkets inside. Take a taxi to the duty-free shop for about 15 yuan.

4. Facilities: 4 and a half stars, if considering the price factor, I will give 5 stars, the hotel layout is very clear, will not get lost. There are a variety of swimming pools, beach pools, water slides, curved pools, etc. There are slightly fewer children playing in the water. The room has an invincible sea view. Sitting on the balcony, you can enjoy the beautiful view of Haitang Bay. The balcony has a large bathtub, which is very clean and you can take a bath. The bathtub and shower room can be connected through a sliding door, which is very user-friendly. The toilet and shower room are very large. Intelligent bathroom equipment and intelligent switch control. Then the main point of losing points is that the style of the room is modern and simple, and the grade of soft decoration is estimated to be similar to that of Atour, using a lot of plates and tiles. The overall style is still relatively clean and bright, which is completely acceptable considering the price factor.

5. Meals: 4 and a half stars, breakfast is rich in variety, quite satisfactory. The overall dining environment is better and not crowded. Due to time constraints, other restaurants only went to the Thai restaurant. The taste is very authentic. Tom Yum, pork neck and curry are all delicious. I have the opportunity to try other restaurants in the future.

The whole is a white series, allowing you to enjoy the sea view of the hotel with all your heart. The furniture became a foil. The sea view is very good, the hotel environment is also very good, the hotel has a beach, but the coastline of Haitang Bay cannot swim in the sea. Those who want to go should be prepared! During the stay, I am very grateful to the butler, Xiao Wang, for his meticulous care, making our vacation more perfect.

The hotel arranged for me a room with a full sea view in the middle, where I can watch the sunrise. He also opened the top helipad to show me the sunset. One's travel is to be so slow. The swimming pool is very comfortable and there are few people on the beach, which is especially good for walking.
Butler Xiaohu (boys with small milk dogs) has a very good service and a five-star service attitude. Any problems can be solved in time.
Areas for improvement: breakfast is more reasonable; there are not many choices for meals at other times (it is probably because there are too few people in the epidemic?).

üçÉEnvironment: The park is rich in vegetation, fresh air, and scattered spaces. There are gardeners working everywhere. There are not as many guests as Atlantis. The whole is clean and suitable for couples. The view of the sea view room is amazing!

üîîService: First-class service, thanks to the customer service Xiaowang, for understanding our special needs, one by one, we also upgraded the room type, and sent a lot of fruits and desserts. Seeing that we have tea needs, we also sent a box of mineral water. All needs can be responded to in a timely manner.

The sea-view room has a relatively large area, and the separate shower room in the bathroom area is also 3-4 square meters. There is a cloakroom and a large dressing table, which can spread out all the luggage.
The balcony is very wide, with an open-air bathtub on one side and tables and chairs on the other. Sitting in a daze, blowing the sea breeze, it is very comfortable.
Generally speaking, the price is very high, suitable for slow-paced leisure travel, and quietly enjoy the vacation.

As a result, there was a dead bird on the balcony. I want to ask how the room is cleaned. After the manager on duty came to see the room that day, even though I was upgraded to the villa area for free. However, there is no sea at all. I want to see the sea. If it is purely for staying in a villa-type hotel, I would not choose mangroves. Hotel room facilities are relatively outdated. However, the service attitude is okay.

msg:The overall experience of the Mangrove Hotel is okay. A housekeeper called us in advance to help arrange a room on the 23rd floor according to our requirements. However, there is a rehearsal for activities in the hotel at night, and the sound is very noisy and noisy. Helped us to coordinate the room in the villa. The sound was much lower. The housekeeper Xiao Yang drove us to the airport. It was a good conversation on the road. Next time I have a chance, I still want to experience the room upstairs because I can see the sea. Yes, but the maintenance of the hotel needs to be strengthened

The room is modern in design, simple and comfortable, and the space is very large. The bathroom design is very special. You can enjoy the sea view outside the window while taking a bath üòé
 
Someone mentioned the butler service in the comments before, and I am still curious about what service it is? ü§î
This time I experienced it by myself, and then I realized that it was really great~üòÑ
I really appreciate the housekeeper Xiao Chen for providing us with a series of warm and thoughtful services during our stay. It‚Äôs really tiring to take a baby out for a trip. Fortunately, the housekeeper Xiao Chen has arranged all our check-in needs in advance and provided you with a full service response. Especially from your perspective, it‚Äôs really comfortable to consider the plan for youüòä

It's a pity that the hotel does not open buffet dinners and some swimming pools. I hope the epidemic will pass quickly and I will have the opportunity to come to the mangrove forest next year to have a better experience.

P.S. The hotel environment is awesome, but it‚Äôs a pity that my photography skills can only show up like this üòÖ

I also specifically asked if the baby is a boy or a girl and how old he is. I was pleasantly surprised when I checked in yesterday. First of all, I helped us upgrade the sea view parent-child room, the hotel has invincible sea view, and the afternoon tea cake specially prepared by Eason for the baby, welcome fruits, small school bags, hats, projector lamps and small toys. So sweet! This is the most careful butler I have encountered in Sanya over the years, like a friend! It may also reflect the service consciousness of the mangrove forest. The duty manager Xiao Gao also provides meticulous service. Today I renewed our stay, and Eason helped us to experience the 32-floor Supreme Suite. This room is facing Wuzhizhou Island. From the room, you can see the sea view. You don‚Äôt need to go out. The hotel has the scenery!
We haven't experienced the leisure place downstairs yet, let's evaluate after the experience!

msg:To be honest, I went out to play with my husband and children every year. I have stayed in a lot of five-star hotels at home and abroad. In the past two years, I couldn't go outside, so I chose Sanya. The Haitang Bay mangrove forest where I lived this summer is the best I have ever felt. Hotel!
        In the summer vacation, there are people everywhere, and hotels are full. I don't expect any service. I can do whatever I want. A few days before the departure, Bo-Alan from the hotel called me and added WeChat to find him if he had any needs. As soon as the plane landed, I asked if I was there and how to take the hotel bus.
         Jingjing, who checked in for us, was super gentle. I cheekily asked if we could upgrade the room for six nights. My lady was very embarrassed. She said that the occupancy rate was over 90% and it was not good for us to increase, but she was still willing to check for us. Check, and then told me that if we can wait until five o'clock, there will be a sea-view room packed out for us to live in. I'm so happy, I didn't return any hope, this is really a pleasant surprise! When I got the room card, Miss Sister gave us two bags of fruit haha~
        The hotel is modern and simple style, simple but not simple, can touch without buttons, the elevator has the same style as w hotel haha üòÑ
        The room is very large, 88 square meters, and the design is quite reasonable. The bathtub on the balcony is the favorite for kids üíï180 degrees invincible sea view, panoramic view of Haitang Bay~
        Bo-Alan asked me again the next morning if I was sleeping well and what else I needed. When I came back from playing at the beach at night, he put a plate of snacks and a fruit plate in the room üòÇ
         Another young man named Xingzhong called me again and said that he was the housekeeper during my stay in the store, and asked me to tell him what I needed. I'm just a black question mark faceüòÇ Do I need so many butlers as an ordinary person hahaha
        In short, the hotel is very good, the environment is very good, and the people are very good. Even the cleaning staff asked me whether the room is satisfied with the hygiene or not. I stayed for six nights and really reluctant to change the hotel. The night before I left I was fed a dessert plate and a fruit plate. On the day I left, Alan asked me what time to leave and said he would come to give me a gift. He also prepared a gift for the child. I'm so embarrassed üò¨ I would like to say goodbye to Jingjing again when I wanted to leave, but I didn't expect her to go to work~
        Xingzhong called again to say goodbye, hey, I am embarrassed hahaha
       In an objective and responsible attitude, I still want to say that Haitang Bay has a good mangrove environment, good scenery, good people, and the hotel‚Äôs Thai restaurant is delicious. The only flaw is that it compares with the Shangri-La where I live behind, whether it‚Äôs self-service. Breakfast or buffet dinner is too general, I often don‚Äôt bother to eat breakfastüòÖ

To the north, we can see Atlantis and Yanlord Crowne Plaza, two other iconic hotels in Haitang Bay. We stayed in a 180-degree Supreme Sea View King Room, which was randomly located on the 10th to 30th floors. Ours was on the 16th floor. The large balcony was absolutely perfect for watching the sea view and the sunrise. The following sunrise video is from OSMO pocket only has editing without retouching, and the rest of the photos are from iphone12pm without retouching. It takes 5-10 minutes to walk from the M floor of the hotel to the beach (it depends on your speed, no one will care if you walk 30 minutes), there are 8 open-air swimming pools on both sides of the road to the beach (of different styles, we didn‚Äôt go mainly because it was too sunny these days), we rented a car, the total cost including insurance and gas was about 200 yuan a day, the hotel‚Äôs underground parking lot is free, the hotel has 3 restaurants, namely the western restaurant on the M floor (we had breakfast here) and the Thai restaurant (Figure 9, the 2-3 person meal ordered by two people on Dianping, it was really delicious and we couldn‚Äôt finish it üòÇ), and a Chinese restaurant on the 1st floor (Cantonese cuisine, we didn‚Äôt go), in addition, there is Haitang 68 Food City next to the hotel where you can buy seafood and process it on the side, and there is also a sweet coconut chicken (ask the hotel staff for the specific location). If you want to eat, go early, otherwise you have to queue up late. Overall it's pretty good. Here are some shortcomings. I guess the hotel's initial investment cost was too high and they hope to open for business as soon as possible. The details of the facilities in the room are a bit sloppy and not so attentive. It's not important. The sea view is worth the money, so don't worry about staying here.

The little brother at the front desk saw us with the children, and was afraid that the children would wait too long, so he was directly promoted to a duplex parent-child suite with a full sea view. My heart was so warm that it exploded (I forgot what my little brother's surname was. I wanted to say hello when I left the store, but I didn't see it. I only know that my little brother is from the Northeast. I hope I can see you next time I stay)
Room: The sea view is beautiful, the room is spacious and comfortable, and there is a bathtub and sofa on the balcony. Facing the sea, you can see Wuzhizhou Island from the balcony.
Breakfast: The breakfast restaurant is generally managed and the attitude of the service staff is average. I hope it can be improved. The air conditioner is not very cool. The breakfast type and taste are not bad.
The hotel‚Äôs swimming pool is also nice and clean. There are places to play in the sand, and you can also swim. There are various water laps in the pool. The waiter told the children to experience it. If you like to rent again, this is particularly good, very human and very angry.
I recommend traveling to shoot the negatives we bought, and I feel that each one is very beautiful. Everywhere is the scenery, and the shots are also very beautiful.
I recommend this Thai food for dinner at the hotel. The yellow curry is delicious, the fish is also delicious, and the children are very happy to eat. Thank you to a waiter named Chen inside. The young lady is very warm. Seeing the children want to pick up fruits, she took the initiative to accompany the children to pick them. She also took good care of us during the meal.
The room attendant on the 18th floor of the hotel would greet us warmly when we saw that we drank a lot, so we said there was no more, and she said that she would help us add these little details.
The butler is also very attentive, helping to make travel appoin**ents, late check-outs, and car appoin**ents. These little details are very intimate.
The overall feeling is great, it is worth recommending, the mangrove forest will be our first choice for a holiday in Sanya in the future.

msg:I have been to Sanya many times and stayed at Haitang Bay Mangrove Resort Hotel for the first time. One day before I checked in, the hotel‚Äôs exclusive butler, Ms. Wang, called me in advance and added WeChat to tell me to upgrade my room type and gave it to me. The best ocean view room on the 21st floor, upgraded from a 180¬∞ ocean view double room to a 180¬∞ supreme ocean view double room, and then take the initiative to greet and help me with all the services in the hotel every day. It is really meticulous service, which makes me feel Very caring.

But it is not inferior during the day, the super a**ospheric lobby reflects the beauty of different light at different times. Four of the six swimming pools are open, each with its own characteristics. The travel photographer presented by the hotel is very professional and dedicated, and the film is very beautiful. The hotel also attaches great importance to the feelings of the guests in the hotel, and take the initiative to ask, the attitude is very sincere, and it also presents delicious handmade snacks, especially to Miss Fu.

msg:I have always lived in Leeds Carlton before. I stayed in the mangrove forest for the first time. The overall feeling is pretty good. The environment, facilities and services of the hotel are very good. It may be an Internet celebrity hotel. The hotel‚Äôs occupancy rate is very high, so the only drawback is the breakfast. The environment, there is no leading service, and it feels messy. On the second day, when Xiaozhan, the hotel's customer service, asked about the feelings of check-in, after giving feedback on his feelings, he sent a warm reminder during the peak breakfast period of the next day that evening, dining off-peak, and thanked the hotel for its positive service attitude and adjus**ents! With such kind and professional staff as Xiao Zhan, I believe it will get better and better! thank you all! See you again!
