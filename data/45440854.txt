The service attitude of the guest rooms is particularly good, which is better than 95% of the hotels in China. There are many artworks in the hotel, which can be appreciated slowly. However, as a resort hotel, there are too few entertainment activities, and there is only Xitang Ancient Town nearby. The Liangshan Chinese Restaurant has a good taste, but the service is basically non-existent, and the most basic dietary taboos of the guests are not asked. As a restaurant in a luxury hotel, it is not up to standard. The service attitude of the restaurant is a bit different from that of the housekeeping depar**ent

msg:The air conditioning in room 2218 where I stayed was very poor. The room temperature was always 24 degrees. My child was sweating and couldn't sleep. The guest service knew that there was a problem with the air conditioning equipment in the room, but they directly gave me a fan. They were very perfunctory and said at 9 pm that I could change rooms if I wanted, but I had children around me and I didn't have the energy to change rooms.
I think the air conditioning at this price can't be used well, and it is completely unqualified.
All kinds of reviews are overrated. The stay experience is not worth the price. I look forward to Xitang's innovative hotel products.
When checking out, I learned that the last room was allocated to a specific channel. I don't know if it is related to my experience.

Figure 1, temperature control is 24 degrees all day.
Figure 2, the fan looks awkward and funny.
Figure 3, I also consumed the bar and restaurant during my stay, which is overrated.

The hotel's hygiene, service, and catering standards are all online, which can be said to be impeccable. As a hotel lover, I have a surprisingly good impression of Liangrang. A few things worth praising: the room hygiene is in place, the night bed service is very meticulous, and the towels have a pleasant and light fragrance. The food in the Chinese restaurant is delicious, especially the roast duck, which is online.

The service is very good, and all the waiters are very professional and polite.

If I have to say something that is not perfect, there are two points: 1⃣️, the coffee craftsmanship needs to be improved 2⃣️, the fee for picking in the vegetable garden is a bit high.

When they learned that we took our baby to the organic farm opposite without a stroller, they actually arranged a stroller for us. The bedding was also very comfortable and the room was big enough. The hotel restaurant tasted good too, providing baby food. The vegetables were all from the organic farm, and the yogurt bread was homemade. In addition, the Liangrang Organic Farm is across the road from the hotel, which is worth visiting. I will take my baby there again if I have the chance.

Every time I went to the restaurant, someone went to the room to pick me up. The housekeeper was indeed available 24 hours a day! In the middle of the night, we gave you pear water when we coughed.
I really like the bedding. It’s very comfortable. People say it’s very suitable for parents and children. I think it’s suitable for children under 3 years old. It’s suitable for taking pictures and checking in. But for children, they definitely don’t like it. The farm also feels boring.
The food ingredients are very good, all organic and natural, and I also saw natural honey. But it was too salty for us, and pepper was added to the roast duck 3, which caused a coughing fit at night.
The coffee is a bit watery overall, but fortunately the milk is very good. Overall very satisfied, suitable for a person to spend time in a daze

After checking into the room, we took a short rest and contacted the butler to help us book the SPA. A 90-minute hotel feature - Himalayan rock salt therapy, my wife and I felt great. Super cool and very comfortable. At the beginning of dinner, the service staff in the hotel restaurant were all smiling and the dishes were very good.

msg:I have been admiring Liangyang Hotel for a long time and finally completed a quiet and comfortable weekend trip.

The hotel is like an art gallery, which will make you stop inadvertently. This time I stayed in a water view deluxe room. It was extremely comfortable to drink tea and watch the scenery on the balcony.

The hotel's service is indeed meticulous and appropriate, and every staff member will smile. I saw cold medicine in the room, and the room service staff Wenfang prepared stewed pear soup, a foot bath bucket, hot water, and mugwort bags. It felt like home, and I was very touched!

The quality of the hotel restaurant is very good, and the ingredients are particularly fresh. Because of the guarantee of the Liangyang organic farm, you can eat with confidence. During my stay, I had every meal in the hotel restaurant, and the dishes were neither too different nor too bad. The breakfast is exquisite and delicious, especially freshly squeezed juices and vegetable juices, which are very healthy. The variety of fruits is of very good quality, which makes the whole family very satisfied.

Just left and already looking forward to the next weekend trip.

Not to mention the design and decoration of the hotel, changing scenery every step of the way, every angle is an aesthetic feast.
The hotel service is also very warm and thoughtful. All service staff will take the initiative to say hello and make you feel at home.
I hope the hotel can launch some artistic activities and experiences in the future, and I also look forward to more shops opening in the art town next door!

My mother got car sick on the way there. When she arrived at the hotel, Aunt Zhang Yeming gave her motion sickness patches, ginger tea, millet porridge, and a foot bucket to soak her feet. The next morning they knew we were leaving and they sent us motion sickness stickers. It is no exaggeration to say that after staying in so many luxury hotels at home and abroad, the service in this hotel is the most considerate. The family unanimously said that they would stay there next time.

msg:In Xitang, Jubin built a garden: the layout of the courtyard in the north is wide and wide; the core of the ancient pavilion in the south is regular; the middle courtyard is full of shallow pools, which is beautiful in the south of the Yangtze River; tall trees are planted in the courtyard, which is as wide as the north. This garden is based on the Four Waters Guitang and encompasses all the lakes and seas. It is a deconstruction of the Chinese garden. With the light of Martin Klaasen, the night is also bright.
There are 164 guest rooms, surrounded by a courtyard called "Youyuan". Not only that, nearly a hundred original works by thirty-five artists are scattered everywhere, including art galleries, tea pavilions, piano rooms, study rooms, bars, etc. Whose house is so pleasing to the eye?
Liang Yang's catering is also a specialty. Liang Shan specializes in Jiangnan water town cuisine combined with Taizhou cuisine, while Sijin Shi specializes in high-end banquet cuisine. Many of the ingredients are sourced from its own organic farm, and the quality, cooking and aesthetics are all excellent.
In particular, I would like to praise Lianglang's service, which is warm and thoughtful, and makes you feel at home. And the service is meticulous. For example, a waiter named "Meixiang" tidied the room and stewed a cup of pear soup to slow down the autumn dryness. She also provided extra desk lamps and wooden foot bath tubs in the evening. The details were touching.

   After we checked in, they immediately helped us place a crib and bed surround, as well as handwritten greetings.
It is worth mentioning that the fertile farm opposite the hotel is perfect for children to have fun and get close to nature. Once inside, there are plants, goats, chickens, ducks and other small animals.
All in all, the trip was worth it and I would come again.

The breakfast was great, especially the bread and fruit. There is no feeling of crowding, so you can have breakfast comfortably and leisurely. The children's playground is connected to the restaurant. Through the glass window, you can pay attention to your baby's movements while eating.
You can go shopping at the Liangniang Organic Manor opposite the hotel. It’s quite beautiful.

I stayed for three nights and four days. I was even more moved by Aunt Wu Lianhua, who cleaned the room. She wrote three cards in three days. It was very considerate and made me feel the warmth of home. The food in the restaurant is also very delicious. It is connected to the amu*****t park, so I feel more at ease when I see the baby. The roast duck is delicious, so remember to make a reservation in advance. The other ingredients are also very fresh. It is said that they come from organic farms with good soil. No wonder they are all delicious. . During the three days, the child tried making vases, painting, baking cookies, and had close contact with nature at the organic farm, and had a great time. I would also like to commend Manager STEVE Han at the front desk for his patience in helping us solve many problems and make reservations for different projects. When he learned that the baby was going to sleep in the afternoon, he even arranged for a late check-out and helped us make reservations before leaving. Ordered 12 Mid-Autumn mooncakes for friends and family. Liangyang is really the first time I am willing to write a review for a hotel with good reviews. My daughter also told me that she would come back later.

The works of 35 art masters interpret the unique "good soil" aesthetics. The atrium of the hotel is a 4,000-square-meter waterscape courtyard. The main hotel building, restaurant, tea room, piano room, study room, and bar are built around the waterscape. The sunken horizontal windows are designed to allow people to sit in the room and face the beautiful scenery of the courtyard. The hardware and detail design of the hotel room are very good, with free drinks in the minibar, turndown service, etc. The stay is very comfortable. The breakfast variety is not the largest but the quality is very good. For example, the noodles will be delivered to the table after ordering. The service in the entire hotel is very good. Whenever you meet the staff anywhere, they will stop and greet you with a smile. The own farm opposite the hotel supplies a variety of fruits and vegetables for the hotel. It's a hotel, it's an art gallery. When people are inside, walking in the scroll, the space and scenery slowly unfold~~

I know that I have brought children with me, and I will send toys right away
The phone calls for an extra bed quilt and will be delivered within five minutes

In terms of dining, the Chinese restaurant is very delicious. Beef and radish are recommended. Although there are not many breakfast items, the quality is very high and the ingredients are very fresh
A very satisfying trip, I will definitely come again next time
A small suggestion: the farm opens at 10 am. According to the relatively hot summer conditions, can the opening time be advanced appropriately?

msg:After more than a month, I came to Liangyang for the second time. I thought it would be too close, and I lost my favor, but it turned out not at all.
The hotel room is not so luxurious and the facilities are not so advanced, but it is comfortable and everything is in line with your heart.
It is rare for an independent hotel to be able to operate to this level of professionalism and to ensure that the details of the service are meticulous.
It was the first time I brought my children over the weekend, and when I went back, I thought about it, and said that I wanted to go to the fertile fields to pull radishes. This time, on the family's birthday, I arranged it again.
Before checking in, I carefully asked about the check-in needs, and after entering the room, I warmly sent a birthday cake. At dinner, the family was very pleasantly surprised by serving cake and birthday noodles again.
The aunties in the room service depar**ent and the waiters who met on the road greeted each other with a smile, warm and appropriate.
This time my husband tried the spa, and came back and said the level was online.
After bedtime in the morning, breakfast was brought to the room, and everything was appetizing. The restaurant dinner is also very satisfactory. There are almost no hotel rooms and meals that can give more than 90 points. Good soil is a family.
Opposite the organic farm, 170 acres, plus points.
Well, the problem is thrown to the good soil again, and the next time you come, what will be a different experience.

The landscape design is a master's work. The hardware is among the top in China. The most difficult thing is the service. The management is systematic, the details are very in place, and the service is reflected by every staff member you see. What I feel is not only the system that requires them to serve well, but the attentiveness, whether it is the service staff of the restaurant or the early morning. The cleaning staff I see have good quality and service awareness, and it is rare that the service is just right. It is very nice to have a 24-hour library. It is very suitable for vacationing with children and families. I recommend their Chinese restaurant. The roast duck is also first-class. The swimming pool designed by the master is worth experiencing.

Needless to say about the design and art, the food is also delicious, the white water fish is amazing, and the restaurant waiter is really smart! The independent hotel team with more than 100 rooms can be trained like this, and it can be seen that GM's management ability is really strong. The farm is quite large and clean, especially suitable for parents and children, but there are few activities suitable for adults. If there are no children, it is great to stay for two days to relax. It may be a bit boring to stay too long. All aspects of praise, wait until May to see the flowers!

The room has a sense of design. The room has a Japanese-style Hoshino hotel. The taste is better. The room service is outstanding. There is only one restaurant for lunch and dinner. You can try a Japanese restaurant, which is more suitable for Chinese tastes. Japanese cuisine can only accept about ten people. There are ecological farms and roses. There are few people. There are few chicken houses and sheep houses. The ancient town of Xitang has a water town in the south of the Yangtze River and some old buildings. The overall size of the tourism design company is not big. The overall hotel is worth staying in the smart toilet. Dyson hair dryer and slippers are better than five-star hotels. Unfortunately, the bathing equipment is not good and the water temperature is not good to adjust the top The shower on the shower does not work. There is a ticking sound on the TV wall at night. There are no activities arranged to raise the cloud. The incense road experience of Aman is very good. There is no Hoshino local activities such as the Geisha show at Atami Onsen. One hour of free plum wine in the evening. Matsumoto’s concert will appreciate these

msg:A hotel that has been planting grass for a long time, the "ceiling" of the light luxury hotel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai has a well-deserved reputation~ It may be that there are fewer people staying in the middle of the week, and you can feel the inner piece with the hotel environment. The restaurant is very good~
Service 💯 There are two rare points: 1. Even cleaning and maintenance personnel who do not need to contact guests on a daily basis are also very service-conscious, and can take the initiative to help guide the way, etc.; 2. You can take the initiative to ask if you want drying service when you come out of the swimming pool. It can be 0.5 steps more than the guests think, which is an advantage over other hotels.
What can be optimized: To the small, it is not reasonable to place a trash can next to the toilet (on the left hand side), generally on the right hand side; to the larger one, the east commercial district connected to the hotel has not been developed yet, and there are fewer dining and entertainment options. .

🧹Hygienic: The hotel sanitation at the price of this person is basically the same, there is not much to be faulty.

🔔Service: The service experience is indeed better, and I believe the managers have also made high demands. The handwritten welcome letter really makes people feel a touch of warmth.

🏠Room: The room area is very large, the layout is reasonable, and it is redesigned and used. There are a lot of things in the mini bar, and the night room service will add some more and deliver snacks.

☕️Dining: Compared with the hotel itself, the Chinese restaurant is a bit overwhelmed. But the breakfast is still very good. In my impression, the breakfast here is second only to naked Valley.

🍺Bar: The environment is very good, and the cocktails are not bad.

Checking in with children, you can get the care of all hotel staff from the moment you walk in. This is the reason why I like him the most for me. The staff will accompany Xiao Pengtian during the meal, and the room will also prepare the children's check-in supplies. These details deserve full marks 💯... The toilet in our room didn't work that day, it should be a minor problem, but the hotel felt very sorry and gave us a big pot of fruit. Every waiter in the restaurant is attentive, and Sean in the bar is also the treasure staff of the hotel😀! We basically get the most satisfying experience wherever we go.
Of course, taking the children to the hotel farm to play... Taking advantage of the benefits of the typhoon day, the sky in these two days is surprisingly beautiful. For your reference:

Dinner is settled in the hotel, because there are elderly people there and there is no set meal, the Chinese restaurant tastes good, and the roast duck and chicken soup are delicious.

A remote hotel that can properly use local elements and art to express the local culture and customs can really make people like this small town.

Thank you Neara

An artistic feast comparable to a museum
The hotel’s service is meticulous (just in the menstrual period, room service specially prepares brown sugar water, super caring) The food in the restaurant is also very satisfactory. The children’s playground is next to the restaurant.
The hotel is relatively quiet and the scenery is pleasant

msg:I chose this hotel because of the high score of Ctrip 4.9 plus the name of the ceiling of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai resort hotel service. Of course I didn’t report that high hope [covering face] The various artistic feelings of the hotel since I stayed. After all, the bottom of the pool designed by Ju Bin is Ding Yi’s painting. Although I don’t understand art, it looks beautiful and comfortable. An organic farm) The taste is quite good. There is no stepping on the thunder. Organic carrots are all ordered ❤️ Mom and Dad are happy to smile [呲牙] After seeing the small notes left by the room attendant, the goodwill of this hotel reached its peak. The six-changing method of love *****s are done in every hotel, but the printed formulaic *****s are really saving paper. Do this carefully, and the handwritten love *****s are warm and dry. My mother's small leather soles are wiped clean. The net key is that the hotel still has an occupancy rate of 80%. This service in my heart can be the ceiling of the resort hotel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai.

There are waiters who give directions and answers wherever they go. The service aunts in the room are also very good. They speak very softly. In the afternoon, they will go to the room to tidy up the room again. The swimming pool is also very good and the kids love it. Breakfast is also very good

msg:對此次的西塘行本來是充滿期待的，但是從辦理入住那一刻就體驗很差。因為有提前聯繫並告知當天是母親生日，登記入住的時候前台已經準備好房間，很貼心。但是在等房卡的時候，有位女士來辦理入住，問了是否能升房，前台告知500元可升級為水景房，女士提出發小紅書是否可免費升級，前台人員，再和領導確認後便同意該操作。自己在邊上其實是很不滿的，如果酒店有條件升房是不是考慮對更有紀念意義的客户，並且也對自己看到小紅書的文章產生了質疑是不是都是免費升房條件下的軟文。
另外酒店的衞生情況也讓我感到十分吃驚，在洗手枱邊上的擦手巾上居然有毛髮和灰塵，一開始還擔心是不是自己的頭髮蹭到了，後來發現連發色都不一樣。對此酒店員工也感到十分抱歉，換了全套的毛巾並送上了果盤、玩具等表達歉意。但是送來的玩具居然都是不完整的，讓客人真的感到服務很流於表面。

最後還是很想感謝餐廳的員工，用餐體驗100分。

農場的體驗也不是很理想，提前打電話問了農場有什麼活動可以安排，是否需要預約，告知僅有烘焙活動需要提前24小時預約，其他都不需要。但是在10:33到達農場大門口後，告知採摘活動有時間表，10:30的活動已經開始，再開始3分鐘後就不能加人了，雖然最後仍參加了活動，但是體驗並不好。看倒大家的反饋都覺得良壤酒店的體驗不至於這樣，但是在自己的體驗中的確就遇到了很多雷區，希望酒店能進行改進吧。

1.開床服務時，看到桌上有小朋友的作業本，主動安排了枱燈，並手寫卡片告知
2.小朋友過生日，在餐廳用餐，除了蛋糕外，還主動送了長壽麪（雖然已經吃不下）
3.對面酒店農場的工作人員，服務態度和意識也是極好，讓小朋友的採摘項目順心完成
4.游泳池去了兩次，每次都會送上薑茶，主動幫小朋友遞浴巾，安全意識也很強
5.整店工作人員的笑容都很真摯，讓度假的人，內心感到很舒適
6.酒店的整體風格和意境，每個角落流露出的藝術氣息，讓住客想不多住兩晚都難
此酒店雖然價格不便宜，但住完後還是覺得是值得的，畢竟度過了一個心情愉悦的週末.
希望酒店可以在全國，開類似品牌的分店，以後有機會也會再次體驗.

環境：酒店很有設計感，設計到佈局都很有特色，讓人一進去就有種心情安定下來的感覺
服務：有點小問題，但是酒店很快解決了。響應速度很快。工作人員還是很nice，路過都會很客氣的打招呼
早餐很豐富 選擇很多樣。晚餐需要預訂，節假日人還是很多的，整體一般，主打有機，價格有點小貴
讓我驚艷的是spa服務，當天正好有些着涼，工作人員還是很耐心的問我身體狀況，根據情況做了項目推薦，而且整個過程都是很用心的，一整套做完感覺人輕鬆不少 很推薦
設施 帶兒子去了游泳池 泳池很漂亮 可能是主要迎合酒店的整體設計 少了些小朋友玩耍的樂趣 有點中規中矩 兒子下水5分鐘就上來了 
農場就在酒店對面 挺適合逛逛的 不錯
酒店整體還是挺高端的，挺適合窩在酒店體驗酒店的服務項目的。
另外，西塘古鎮就在酒店，走過去5分鐘吧，挺方便的

辦入住前台告知進行了免費升房服務，lucky！自帶天井小院的景觀房，真的好美，可惜天公不作美～期待下次
工作人員都很熱情好客，所有人看到你都會主動問候，酒店管理培訓的很棒哦👍🏻

中餐廳的食材都很新鮮，味道很鮮美！

唯一可惜的就是有機農場真的很冷清，帶着小朋友興沖沖的過去，沒想到什麼也沒有有一丟丟掃興，本來預訂了採摘，但是看到裏面冷冷清清的一下子就沒興趣了，希望能在這塊稍微改進下，雖然是淡季，但是我看也有很多帶小朋友的家庭，農場弄的好點帶小朋友過去看看玩玩還是很好的。

期待下次入住～～

其次，設施和用品都不錯。牙刷不是一次性的，牙膏是Grin的，洗護是泰國的一個自然芳療品牌，拖鞋提供了兩款，一款薄的房間內，一款稍厚實可以出房間。床品面料很舒服，感覺是高支棉的。mini吧所有東西都免費。酒店自己農莊的玫瑰花茶好蠻香的。
然後，服務也不錯。入住有服務人員帶到房間，介紹房間內各個設施用品的使用。我們帶了兩個小孩，還提供了兩套小童用品，小童拖鞋還分兩次送了不同尺碼的，很貼心。沙發還給我們鋪了張小床給小孩睡。問了兩次路，保潔阿姨和叔叔都超級熱心地幫我們帶路。
總體還是很滿意的。

❤️哇塞1: 寶寶生日佈置+手作棉花糖生日蛋糕
我在入住前提前致電酒店希望能準備些寶寶的生日小驚喜～當寶寶推開房門的那一瞬間，被房間內的生日佈置開心到連連哇塞！全部是員工手作的🎈和彩燈佈滿了整面電視牆和沙發～
最哇塞的是送給寶寶一個超好看的手作棉花糖奶油蛋糕，很大一個（見圖9），大家去的話可以提前和酒店備註生日福利。
❤️哇塞2: 房內可全套打包帶走的一堆好物
良壤定製棉麻手提袋/良壤定製寶寶拖鞋+大人拖鞋（質感超好還帶絨）/良壤定製手工蛋卷➕有機牛奶➕有機果汁➕一堆軟飲➕一堆水果/良壤定製泰國精油沐浴品/酒店貼心到還配備自製的驅蚊水（味道超好聞，我拿了2瓶🤩），還有全套寶寶洗漱用品！
❤️哇塞3: 酒店自有的良壤親子農場
住店客人免門票，住店期間可無限次遊玩。農場就在酒店馬路對面，裏面全是酒店自己養殖的有機果蔬、花卉、小動物。酒店餐廳的有機食物全部來自這個農場，健康又美味！農場裏還有很有藝術感的滑梯啦鞦韆啦，我家寶寶在農場玩了足足2小時[偷笑R]帶娃放電寶地！
♥️哇塞4:誠意滿滿的精緻有機早餐
早餐品種雖然談不上五花八門，但每一樣都花了心思，很精緻！果汁也全部都是鮮榨的，尤其是水果麪包蔬菜也都來自它們的農場吧我猜。寶寶讚不絕口[贊R]
♥️哇塞5: 員工有求必應
居然還給我們全家免費擦鞋[萌萌噠R]看到我們寶寶年齡小，親自送來了搖搖木馬，讓小朋友在房間隨便玩～
❤️哇塞6: 酒店隨處可見的藝術品
培養小朋友的美商，隨處可出大片。
	
所以我想説，良壤貴得我心服口服！@良壤有機生活
住進良壤的每一分鐘都是享受‼️
	
最後説下交通，上海自駕至酒店約1小時10分鐘，適合所有年齡的小朋友和大朋友們！

從上海自駕1小時，停車也方便，一進方面就送來了生日蛋糕，做的也很漂亮，下午圍着酒店逛逛，欣賞各種藝術品和設計。
房間內的設計和設施很合理，低調的奢華，很多都是定做的，在裝修方面花了血本的。玫瑰花茶和蛋卷我特別喜愛，走的時候買了兩盒。
良膳的晚餐菜品很不錯，沒有踩雷，早餐也品種豐富，咖啡好評。
丁乙泳池水温29℃1.4米的水深，開放到晚上12點，十分友好。
強烈推薦希望靜心度假，追求生活品質的人來到這裏，放慢節奏享受一下。

msg:酒店的服務太對不起這個價格了…尤其是餐飲，因為酒店的位置大家都知道，周邊沒有什麼好的餐飲的，所以一定是選擇在酒店內的餐飲用餐。首先你進入餐廳時位置都是空的情況下，服務員不會立刻告知你坐哪邊，而是讓客人站着等着，然後看訂桌在安排位置，難道訂桌的位置不應該服務員都知道的麼？而是臨時去查看的麼？其次是點菜的菜單，大部分菜是沒有的，時令菜也是如此哈～所以大家要有心裏準備嘻嘻
在來説説房間內部，整個風格是簡約風，用的材料都是好東西哈，但是空調聲音極為明顯，晚上就算開最小風也是很響的，床墊很軟，超級不舒服，第二天客服説可以換一面，難道客人入住前客房介紹不應該提醒麼？白瞎了這麼多錢砸的酒店…
在説説下午茶，下午茶其實就是單點的西式點心，沒有特色，而且等待時間比較久，出餐你是一道道的，而是等半天一下子給你端過來…食慾都沒了，美食不應該是一個個上着品嚐的嗎？唉！總之和內心期待相差甚遠～

1. 藝術品在酒店隨處可見，彷彿置身於博物館。上野雄次的藝術插畫，丁乙老師的泳池馬賽克壁畫。雕塑和裝飾藝術家劉建華的作品等等。修身養性，一步一世界。
2. 良壤擁有自己2000畝的有機農莊，酒店中餐廳的食材部分取自自營農場，健康美味。強烈推薦良膳餐廳的宮廷烤鴨，一口難忘。早餐更是讓人驚喜，有機雞蛋烹飪的蛋餅，菜肉大餛飩，良壤自製的羊角包和油條。水果豐盛，新鮮無比。
3. 酒店房間有花園景觀和陽台水景房，個人更偏向於花園房。私隱性更加，觀賞性更強。房間無衞生死角，床品舒適，戴森吹風機和智能馬桶，免費的mini  bar。
4. 着重表揚一下酒店工作人員的服務精神。尤其是歐進寶主任。作為攜程金鑽貴賓，此趟跟家人的出行承蒙歐主任的關照，倍感温暖。每一位工作人員都有熱情和信仰，急人所急，想人所想。從房間的佈置，送來的泡腳桶，水果小食。到對小孩，長者的照顧問候，無時無刻都感受到除卻人文氣息，良壤更多的是人情關懷。
期待下次與良壤的相見！

msg:業者的用心，感受到了。美術館的燈光和氛圍，讓酒店呈現非常厚重的底藴氛圍。標榜奢華酒店的業者聽到了，真正意義的奢華，絕對不是大理石水晶和戴森吹風機，是你願意讓出很多酒店的公共空間給房客獨處，而不是拿來賣一杯酒或是下午茶。唯一的遺憾，是服務太Over了，不夠sophisticated，到這個境界，加法的服務衹會打擾客人，衹要做減法精準的服務就好了。

1.孩子睡懶覺，早飯不肯下樓吃，我問服務員，可不可以帶兩片烤麪包？（因為大多數酒店是不允許的）但是她的回答讓我驚呆了，完全可以，我幫你去拿打包盒。打完包要走，馬上遞上打包紙袋。老公開玩笑的問，我可以再去拿個蘋果嗎？説，當然可以，裝滿都行.
2.早餐的蔬菜和水果很新鮮，尤其是蜂蜜，拿了一整個蜂巢，真正的原生態。
3.入住和退房，服務員都會幫你拿行李，根本不用你擔心。
4.晚餐在酒店吃就行，不用去西塘古鎮吃，性價比還是很高的。

公共區域也就那麼幾顆樹，沒什麼好拍的。早餐東西少不夠精緻和這個價位不符合。總體來説這個價位不值不住
