msg:Cleaningless
The hotel room initially toilet was not cleaned properly but subsequently house cleaning is great. They provide lots of complimentary drinks too. 

Service
They assigned a butler Arif who is friendly devoted to his job and will message you daily whether require to do booking and offer discount. He gave me 4 pink dolphin as a gift despite not using his service, it will be great if he do check whether my kids is boy or girl. Both my boys don’t like it so we returned 2 dolphin with tips to him. Remember to do a positive feedback and screenshot to him immediately after your stay or he will keep pester you to do it right now. He is very hardworking. 

Concierge not willing to go extra mile to send us to railway station despite nearer than airport. For a 5-7 star hotel, the service is below par compared to the 3 star hotel stayed previously and the 5 star hotel after it. Service is very important and they left me uncomfortable and disappointment. 

I place it 2 star instead of 1 is that at least they did a birthday cake for my friend upon requesting earlier. 

Location
The location is horrible to me as the dutyfree shopping mall nearby does not permit me to do any purchase as my outward bound flight is at Meilan instead of Phoenix airport which my country does not fly to. It worsen the shopping experience and the food nearby is a sky high rate. 

Waterpark 
The only plus point i would rate it great is for the aquaventure water park which is fun and included in the package. The staff is friendly and guide things well to ensure all is safe and secure. 

The aquarium is very small but still considered good, given its included in package

Breakfast
I dined twice in Saffron and it was horrible. Food is very oily, carbo food, place is big, messy and many duplication station. They stuffing hotel guess with carbo and food that is oily. There is no changes in food when i dine the 2nd time. Its worst than 3 star hotel. All 8 of us dislike the food, 2nd time i left in 10mins seeing still no changes. My boy only have 1 slice of bread. Had to spend money to dine elsewhere. Check out immediately early that day as there is no other place to dine early morning. 

I dined once in kaleidoscope which i find at least match standard of 4-5 star hotel. The food is much better, there is no duplication and at least have some protein food. Place is big but much more organised. So if you booked the hotel, i recommend you to dine here instead of Saffron. 

Overall i recommend the aquaventure park and low season stay as price is still acceptable. Not recommended for high season pricing as there is many better options. 

The rating is based on 5 star hotel expectation.

I got a free upgrade which also had an amazing view of the water park and sea view. The Atlantic club meals were delicious and diverse. The water park is a MUST!! I had an amazing experience. I was only there for a week and still felt like there’s so much I haven’t done. I’ll definitely be coming back.

The staff welcomes you with open arms and a smile. Though most can’t speak Chinese, they are still willing to help you. 

Special thanks to my butler Dikshya Kunwar who made sure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Assisted me at any time of the day. 

MAJEED ARIF- who helped me move to much more comfortable room and made sure everything was up to par. 

Maiya at the breakfast buffet also did a splendid job  assisting me. 

Overall, an amazing hotel with great facilities and helpful staff.

msg:I wish there were more than five stars available to rate this hotel! Atlantis Hotel is truly exceptional, with incredibly friendly staff. My wife and I stayed at the Atlantis Hotel for two nights in early April 2024. Actually, this hotel is very well-known for its outstanding facilities such as the, water park, aquarium, spacious and comfortable rooms, and delicious breakfast with endless options. But,
one aspect of this hotel that might not be fully captured in pictures is the exceptional friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. From the moment we entered the hotel, we were treated warmly as if we were the only guests, despite the lobby being full of people. The staff members were so numerous that it is impossible to mention each one by name, but one individual stood out to us: Mr. Aref Majeed, who went above and beyond to make us feel like special guests by providing a thorough introduction to the hotel, checking on us multiple times throughout the day and night to see whether we need anything, and even surprising us with special gifts on our last night to enhance our experience in Sanya. I do not think we ever forget his incredible character and the beautiful smile that was always on his face.
I am grateful to Atlantis for employing such a remarkable staff and for everything they did to make our stay unforgettable. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone in search of a truly special place with incredibly kind people.

Arif took good care of us every day to make sure we didn't need anything, and especially he was a great help to my daughters. It made Atlantis special!
Furthermore, for my family, who is not good at Chinese, he provided a lot of useful information, which made Sanya and Atlantis more enjoyable

The hotel was big and colorful and had a lot of travelers. It is a paradise for children who like active swimming. Yarong Bay would be better suited for couples who want plenty of rest.

msg:We had high expectations for this hotel seeing its reputation and expensive rooms. 
But already on arrival we were disappointed. The lobby was packed with people and the lines for check in very long. Before getting in one of the queues, we desperately tried to find a seat for our old father who was with us. There was none, and we had to ask if he could sit and wait in the car exhibition area that was in the lobby. Luckily they agreed. 

Once our father was comfortable, we proceeded to waiting in the queue. We waited long time before it was finally our turn. We called our father to come over, and just as we were to start the check in, a staff member came over and invited us to do the check in, in the VIP lounge. We have no clue why, but it was totally useless as we just arrived at the counter anyway. 

At the end of the check in (which was long since they have to through your identity thoroughly and take your photo which I really don't like for privacy reasons),  our room wasn't ready yet. So instead of dragging our father back out in the packed lobby, we went to sit with him at the back of the VIP lounge. Then we got our next surprise! A staff member came up to us and asked us to leave! We didn't as we hadn't even asked to be in the VIP lounge in the first place and because there wasn't a single free seat in the lobby for our father. 

The room was big and clean and had a beautiful view of the sea. Absolutely no complaints about the room. 

We also visited the aquarium inside the hotel, which was quite impressive. 

But be aware. Once they've taken your picture at the reception, you enter everywhere with face recognition cameras. Upon entering this hotel you give them your complete identity. 

We also visited the water park which was another bad experience. It was full of people as it's open not only for hotel guests but for the general public. The shortest queue was 40min long. We ended up leaving and went by the pool instead. This was the best part of the hotel. The pool was relatively quiet and you can have something to eat and drink there. 

The beach was also great and very little people. But it wasn't a good time to swim. 

We also went to see the mermaid show but it wasn't that great compared to other similar shows we've seen in China. 

All in all we wouldn't go back to this hotel. It claims to be a 7 star hotel but I've been to far, far better (and cheaper) 5 star hotels. 
Also if you care about animals welfare, you shouldn't go here either. They are exploited and mistreated for gaining even more money for the hotel.

Only problem for me was that the water park was sooo crowded that it was basically unusable. So, yes, you get free tickets to water park, but unless your definition of fun is waiting in line close to an hour for a go on a slide or being part of a human soup on the wave pool, you probably want to use the hotel pools instead of the water park.
Beach is small and there is no shade, but good fun at night.
The butler service was awesome!

The hotel sent me a cake for my birthday which was very kind of them. Also we had a great support from our butler Yu Fan who helped us with everything. It is a very nice hotel for a short stay with kids. We had a lot of fun there!

The hole resort is nice, but staying at the hotel doesn't really get you much added value for the price tag. We went as a married couple without kids, so I guess we fell outside of the target market.

msg:I recently had the pleasure of staying at Atlantis for a couple of days, and my overall experience was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I walked through the doors, I was greeted with warmth and hospitality that set the tone for the entire stay.

The service  was impeccable, and it was the little things that truly made a difference. The rooms were not only comfortable and well-appointed but also maintained with meticulous attention to detail. Every staff member I encountered was friendly and accommodating, making me feel genuinely valued as a guest.

However, what truly stood out during my stay was the outstanding service provided by Ina at the front desk. Ina went above and beyond to ensure that my needs were not only met but exceeded. Whether it was offering recommendations for local dining, arranging additional services, or addressing any queries I had, Ina's dedication to guest satisfaction was truly commendable.

Ina's warm and friendly demeanor made me feel like more than just a guest; I felt like a valued friend. Her willingness to go the extra mile to make my stay enjoyable did not go unnoticed, and it significantly enhanced my overall experience.

In conclusion, my time at Atlantis was marked by exceptional service, comfortable accommodations, and a staff that clearly takes pride in providing a top-notch experience for their guests. I wholeheartedly recommend Atlantis to anyone seeking a memorable and delightful stay, and I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ina for making my visit truly special.

The hotel is busy, if you arrive early you can still leave your luggage at the front desk and your things will get sent up to your room while you enjoy the facilities and services available to you. 
I want to give a huge shout out to Ivy who helped me through the whole process, has excellent English skills and is very hospitable, she added me on wechat and made my stay an immensely pleasurable one. 
High tea, free drinks, free access to the aquarium and water park, private beach and huge pools to play in. 
At night you can lay under the stars poolside and enjoy the breeze.
My room was beautiful, clean and comfortable. The bed was soft and inviting. Wish I had stayed longer. When I do visit sanya again, I will come back to experience it for a longer time. Thank you for a wonderful stay
Ps. The aquarium is part of the lobby so at 9/10 pm you can take cute pics in front of it because it’s not busy.

msg:Cons: 
- super crowded at the lobby and common area 
- occasionally ppl smoke at lobby common area (i.e. lobby, swimming pool, etc)
- no butler service 
- the breakfast buffet just as crowded as night market
- water leakage from the shower 
- poor Wi-Fi connection in the room 

Pros:
- The beachfront looks absolutely beautiful. It’s very convenient for our toddler to access to the water park and aquarium. 

Overall, Atlantis Sanya is not up to a five star hotel standard. I still can’t believe guests are allowed to smoke in the lobby/swimming pool area (at least I saw the staff didn’t stop anyone who’s smoking). The shower door wasn’t quite sealed so the water was leaking in the bathroom. Basically we need to book everything thru the hotel APP. It’s not user friendly to guests with foreign passports as only WeChat pay is accepted thru the app. We went through a lot to get the WeChat pay working. Despite the tons of trouble the adults had been through, our young daughter did enjoy her trip very much.

Breakfast and afternoon tea was amazing as always. We had a man named Bert who helped us during breakfast time. He was so helpful and really attentive and made sure our breakfast time was perfect.
During the whole stay we had a butler named Leif who we have to say a massive thank you to. He helped make a reservation at BSK and Tikki Bar at New Years Eve when it was most busy, and was able to get us in. Without Leif I’m not sure we would’ve gotten in, so we appreciate his help. He helped us as soon as we arrived, providing us with all the information we could possibly need. Leif’s service was amazing and our stay was better because of it.
The pools, the water park and the aquarium were great as always! We will be back for a third time sometime in the near future. ☀️

msg:Atlantis experience was both underwhelming and overwhelming. Depending on your preferences, you may not enjoy this experience. We decided to stay just for one night so we could have as much time as possible to explore what is on offer. Check in was a little stressful as we are English speaking, and out of the large number of staff that you see present, no one seemed to be able to properly communicate with us. This was very surprising as it is the Atlantis. The room was lovely, probably the part we enjoyed the most as we had to escape the crowds of people that flooded the resort. The restaurants offer a good variety, we enjoyed the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, great service and affordable. The aquarium was free as part of your stay, getting in was quite simple, inside there are lovely animals to see, but not very many. The starfish portion allowed for light touching, however there were many people and children aggressively handling them with only one member of staff to try correct this behavior, whom was overwhelmed and could not do it properly. We were worried for the safety of these animals. The water park has a great variety of entertainment, however due to the very hot weather, large amount of people and waiting times we decided to just walk through it. The pool areas close to the hotel definitely lack manpower for lifeguards and therefore most of the areas were closed off. Down near the tikki bar area would be a better option for swimming and seating. The entertainment in the evening was lovely, the band was great and very talented(at tikki bar)- despite having to rush their performance inside due to rain, they set up fast and got on well. 

Buffet breakfast was a highlight. We got there as soon as it opened as we were worried about the large crowds- I would suggest as early as possible to be able to relax and eat well. 

On-site Covid testing was 15kuai, opens 9:30 but get there early if you don’t want to stand in a terribly long line. 

Overall, the resort does have a lot to offer, just largely depends on your preferences. For families, this place would be amazing with everything at your fingertips, and many activities. Also, I think it may be better when school is not in summer vacation and the crowds are less.

Staff are very friendly and helpful. Room with amazing ocean view on 35th flr up to expectations with free minibar and good bottled water supply for hot days, and good bathroom amenities. The only thing they can work on in bathroom is the plumbing, there is a slight odor from the bidet regardless of how many times flushed. Breakfast is amazing lots of selection but crowded as well. Location is convenient for waterpark and dolphin-sealion activities (but expensive to buy photos which are not free). Restaurants and shops nearby are expensive so be ready to spend. Still Gordon Ramsay’s Bread Street is worth trying!! Disappointing part of hotel pool is only 1/3 of the pool was open during peak season🥲.  But Fitness gym is super!!! 👍

If you order some water you may receive it within one hour if you are lucky . Very bad service and unprofessional staff . Towels and shower is not better than a 3 star hotel . Towels quality is very bad . If you want to be respected and have best ocean view room go to Intercontinental Sanya or The Ritz-Carlton .

The breakfast is super huge and plenty of choices but the restaurants where to have it is super old style with cheap furniture and not very attentive staff.

msg:Good morning,

I’m writing to express my unfortunate dissatisfaction after a recent disappointing stay at your hotel in hopes that you will be able to address these issues.

To begin with, the check in experience was extremely slow and chaotic; there were long lines and people everywhere. Then after checking in, there was no one to help us with our heavy bags when we went to look for the room. Upon arriving, we were confused to see that there was no table or chairs to enjoy the balcony that the room had, something which is standard in any other balcony hotel.

However, possibly one of the most frustrating aspects was the elevator situation: each and every time that we needed to go up or down there were major issues and delays. In fact, there were several occasions in which the elevators would stop but we couldn’t enter and had to wait for many to pass like this until there was an elevator that had enough space for us. When that was not even possible, we began to take them UP in order to be able to come DOWN as there were some times of day that it was simply impossible to enter…and we were only two people. It wasn’t like we were a large family. I really found this completely unacceptable as this is a very basic and fundamental part of a correctly and safely operating facility.

Later we were surprised and disappointed to see that there were no lounge chairs on the beach, so we decided to visit the pool only to learn that the majority of the areas were closed off, forcing everyone into a very small section which was of course completely overcrowded and chaotic with so many swimmers and so little space.

Then in the mornings during breakfast, there were times we could not get a clean table, again, even for two people. It was like none of public spaces were planned or staffed knowing how massive the rest of the hotel was as it wasn't able to accomodate the large volume of people who would be using those spaces at the same time. It was all very uncomfortable and not relaxing at all.

If I’m completely honest, I came from a stay at the Marriott expecting the experience to be even more pleasing and comfortable than the one I had there but found myself wishing I had stayed at Marriott for my whole visit to Sanya as it was much, much better than my time at the Atlantis from start to finish (with the exception of the Bread Street Kitchen restaurant which was great). Despite the services and facilities that the Atlantis boasts, I found none of it to match the quality promised, and was frankly much better at our other hotel, which is incredibly disappointing especially when considering the difference in price.

As it stands I cannot recommend the hotel to friends, nor do I think I will be willing to return in to future but hope you take thing issues into consideration to improve your future guests' experiences.

The children are reluctant to go back to Shanghai. I am very grateful to the housekeeper Jiali for her meticulous help from check-in, check-out to the end of the trip. When I checked out, she packed the toys and some toiletries that the children forgot in the room and sent them to my home. I was really touched. Next time I go to Sanya, I must thank Jiali in person. We staggered the peak and ended the last few days of the trip in Yate during the 5.1 holiday. It was basically perfect and left good memories for the children. Thank you Sanya, thank you beach, thank you Yate, thank you Jiali, see you next time!

msg:This is my second stay. The price of this Ctrip event is very cheap. My friend and I stayed in a twin room with one child. The bed is 1.5m long, which is more than enough for one big and one small.
The sea view room is the room on both sides that can see the sea on the side. It feels like there are so many people staying this time. It takes a long time to check in and wait for the luggage to be delivered to the room, but the housekeeper Andy is very nice, responsive, and solves problems quickly. You can really ask him for help with any problem 👍🏻 He will give a lot of small tips attentively, and the service attitude is super good, which makes up for the unpleasantness of waiting for a lot of people!
Both the water world and the aquarium can be played unlimitedly, but children under 1.07 meters can only play in the children's washing pool and rafting in the water world, and it is a bit regrettable that the shark crossing cannot be played! It is still very good to take pictures in the aquarium. Since it was raining almost all the time this time, I only went to the outdoor bubble party once, and the children had a lot of fun. I plan to stay a few more days next time.
The breakfast selection is quite rich, but there is no stone pot bibimbap! Regret!

As soon as I entered the lobby, I received a warm welcome, check-in was smooth, and the concierge sent my luggage to the room. Fortunately, the room was upgraded, and I could see the unbeatable sea view and the water world garden view! 
The layout and supporting facilities of the room are very user-friendly, and those who have stayed there say that they are easy to use. 
Free drinks and fruits from the mini bar are super value. 
The hotel has a variety of dining options, high-end matching or cost-effective selections, you can choose. There are also a lot of takeaways nearby, and there are takeaway cabinets at the entrance of the hotel. Everyone can eat, drink and have fun with confidence! 
2 adults and 2 children can play in the water world and aquarium unlimited times: absolutely worth the ticket price and room rate. There are fewer tourists in the water world in the morning, many projects are brushed N times, the queue time is slightly longer in the afternoon, and there are wonderful water performances and drone performances at 8 o'clock in the evening. The aquarium is the king of healing, and every time I go there, I have new gains. 
I must praise the staff here. Every position can give guests a sincere smile and service, and they feel at home, which is fully reflected in their efforts. I especially like Miss Gina Hu, who accompanied us warmly and treated us sincerely. This trip made our family's happiness doubled!!

The baby's favorite projects were touching starfish, feeding fish with a bottle, and the book in front of the coral tank on the second floor. He checked in twice and drew cute hand-painted pictures. The mini camp movie was also checked in, and the baby liked it very much. Later, we went to the Water World. The baby was not tall enough, so we just watched the water curtain show and came out, and went straight to the family pool, where the baby had a lot of fun. The buffet dinner that was originally scheduled was not willing to go, and had to play until the last minute before coming out. The housekeeper Xiao Dai was very meticulous and recommended all the projects suitable for babies to me. He also helped us to check out late. We slept well the next day and had enough time to check in the infinity pool and the second brush family pool. The housekeeper Xiao Dai also prepared a cute doll for the baby as a souvenir. The overall feeling is very good. When traveling to Sanya, Atlantis is still worth checking in. When the baby is older, we will come again. I hope the service and quality can be maintained.

If you don’t want to play exciting projects, you can stay in the wave pool for two days and still reluctant to leave before checking out.

Service: Our exclusive butler Xiao Dai was very enthusiastic, patiently answered questions, and finally gave us a doll.
Facilities: The only drawback is that the bathroom does not have a washlet facility. Now families have it, and as a high-end hotel, it is a bit regrettable that it does not have one.
This time I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights, and participated in the independent camp for half a day on the second morning. Because it was the off-season, there were only two children. I watched the dolphin and sea lion performances at a very close distance and interacted with them, and experienced the VVIP treatment. Very satisfied. The hotel's own aquarium and water world also have many activities! I plan to stay for two more days next time.

There were quite a lot of people on June 1. The hotel called us the day before to ask about the room requirements and check-in time. When we went to check in, the room was ready.
Not long after checking in, the hotel butler Xiao Yuan called us and added WeChat to provide a lot of useful and timely information. He also gave the children a small gift, which was very thoughtful.
The hotel includes two days of water world and aquarium. The child reached 122cm this year, and finally he could check in all the projects, big trumpet, knight, roller coaster, and brushed them many times in two days. It was very enjoyable. The white whale show in the aquarium was very good.
Atlantis, looking forward to seeing you next time!

If you just want to watch the sea and play on the beach, there will be many places to stay. The Saffron Restaurant is very good. I left my child's water cup. It was solved in less than an hour after I called, and it was delivered. Cherry, the housekeeper, also went to work to contact me immediately. I was really touched. Those who bring children should go there. You won't go wrong. There are many things for children to play, such as the water world, the wave pool, the Children's Day painting, and clay kneading. There is a children's swimming pool, as well as water gun battles, bubbles and other activities. I will go again next time

msg:It’s been a while since I’ve written. Today I’ll share my happy feelings.
As an ordinary consumer, the first thing to consider when traveling is budget and experience.
Before coming here, I only heard from my clients that the hotel is the best and most expensive in Sanya.
After hearing this, I thought about how much it would cost. They only shared with me that it was good and expensive, but they did not tell me about the happiness brought by the hotel. I was traveling as a family of three and booked it one month in advance. Once confirmed, it cannot be canceled. The price It’s 1,900 yuan. Speaking of which, some friends may think it’s expensive per night just based on the price. Now the point is, let’s talk about the service, hahaha
The hotel will call the day before to confirm and explain the play time. My order contains a large number of unlimited entry and exit tickets for Little Water World and Aquarium (10 o'clock on the day of check-in - before 3 o'clock on the day of check-out). Do you still think it is expensive after seeing this? , it’s really great value for money. I’m so good at living, I just need to stay for one night and maximize my enjoyment of this hotel fee~
Let’s talk about the check-in details: Li Zhuocheng at the hotel front desk helped check in with the help of classmate Xiao Li. He also informed the play area one by one and helped arrange children’s bed enclosures. He was very attentive and warm. There was also a guide who helped lead people to the lobby of the room. Sister, they are also very good, give them a thumbs up￼
Here are the details of the tour: We came to the water world first at 11:00. My baby is 1.2 meters tall. When we arrived, we found that some children under 1.22 meters were not allowed. The height requirement here is barefoot, so we came to the children's area, the ocean. The Imperial Slide has basically been completed in this area in the past two days. There is also a wave-making area that we did not go to.
At about 13:00, we came to the hotel beach again. The hotel provides free sand digging tools. Just return them after use. There are some jellyfish on the beach, which are soft and fun to touch. If you look carefully, you can also find small crabs. and mini hermit crabs
16:00 Go to eat near the hotel
I went to the aquarium around 18:00 and saw many kinds of fish. The large glass was very spectacular. Since I didn’t see the mermaid show, I came again the next day to watch the same show. The kids loved it.
At 20:00 we came to the children's swimming pool again. I can only say that the children love the water so much. We experienced various projects in a marching style. We were a little tired, but we enjoyed it very much.
We went back to the room at 21:30 and were stopped by the bar on the way. Hahaha, there are performances and interactions here that both adults and children loved. We ordered a 168 pizza and a 118 fries. At that time, I thought the fries were really expensive, haha, let’s go After the meal, I felt that it was okay. The portion was quite large, the fried food was delicious, and the chicken pizza was also delicious. The child also participated in the interactive dance, which was very happy. As of now, the child is exhausted and slumped on the chair. ￼￼￼The kind where you can carry him all the way back home
When I returned to the hotel, I was surprised to find that classmate Xiao Li had prepared a small surprise gift for me. It was very nice, hahaha~
It’s about 22:00, so I quickly went to bed. Children are the kind who fall asleep within the 200 number~
Well, it was 8:00 the next day. After seeing the scenery, I went to have breakfast. The breakfast was really rich. There were so many varieties. I didn’t take pictures one by one. They were all delicious. I just want to say that this hotel is too It's appropriate, I really like it
My itinerary for the next day is to return to the room at 9:30 to give the kids a bubble bath
10:30 Go to the aquarium to watch the performance of Mermaid Sister
11:30 Go back to room to rest and have some fruit snacks
13:30 Check-out and luggage storage
14:00 We came to the water world again to let the children have enough fun
17:00 Children’s pool rest and hotel that night
Okay, the wonderful one-night hotel stay is over. After seeing this, do you still think it’s expensive? I really think it’s worth it and it’s worth every child to experience it😃😃😃
My writing skills are limited, so I don’t like to understand, I just want to bring happiness to everyone ^_^~

msg:First of all, I would like to give a thumbs up to the hotel facilities and hygiene. You can eat, drink, live and play without leaving the hotel. It is very comfortable to have children stay. Before check-in, the hotel called to ask if there are any special requirements. The children were provided with bed guards and welcome fruits. The small refrigerator in the room is replenished with beer, drinks and milk every day. The mineral water is sufficient. I forgot to count, about 8 bottles of drinks and 10 bottles of mineral water. I was a little tired when I arrived at the hotel on the first day, so I called for food delivery. The same was true on the last day. I enjoyed dining directly in the room. They also took the initiative to add chairs for us. The toiletries are sufficient and smell good. Shampoo, hair care, bath and body lotion are complete. Toothbrushes and oin**ents are also divided into adults and children. There are also shaving sets, combs, etc. The hair dryer can adjust the temperature and wind speed. The makeup mirror is also very large. The shower, toilet and washing area are separated. The above includes the bathtub area and the glass door can be separated from the living room corridor area. Even if you are in the shower, you don’t have to worry about room service. Slippers are provided for cotton and beach use, which is very considerate. The room is large. The air conditioner will automatically turn off when the balcony door is opened, which is very automatic. The room we booked faces the sea, and we can see the Crown Hotel and Duty Free City across the street. We took our baby to the aquarium, the beach (we rented the hotel's parasol and table, and gave him four bottles of water and a fruit plate, and provided bath towels), the swimming pool (basically 1.2 meters, the children's area is shallower, there are a lot of safety guards by the pool, and they will give safety reminders. Children must be accompanied by adults and wear life jackets when entering the water), the Duty Free City (very close to the hotel), etc. There are many service staff in the hotel and in front of the door, who will help with luggage, guide, consult, and call a taxi. Thank you. Finally, a special thank you to our butler Patrick, who is super nice. He will send reminders about dining, activities, and travel every day. If you have any questions, he will answer them carefully. He also gave the baby a cute little whale gift, which gave us the warmth of home throughout the whole process. I will recommend friends to stay here. The experience is so good. Thank you again!

Every post can provide guests with sincere smiles and services, making them feel at home. In particular, I would like to commend Brother Xiao Yuan for his care and arrangements during his stay, his warm companionship and sincere trea**ent. All in all, the stay experience was very good and I look forward to my next stay.

The children were very happy and sent them to us. The tour guide is very useful. It reminds us to arrange our meal time reasonably every day. Although we only stayed for one day, there is really no shortage of services that we should have. They are enthusiastic, meticulous and considerate, and are dedicated to their responsibilities. Next time we come, we will ask for the assistant ina. In short Five-star praise

The aquarium is very shocking. In Water World, I only had the rafting and wave pools because I took my baby alone. The most considerate thing is the one-to-one butler service. Our butler Jackson took the trouble to answer all kinds of trivial questions for us. He was professional and patient, responsive to all requests, and even gave the baby exquisite souvenirs. A very perfect experience, I will come to Water World again next time

Since it is the off-season, there are not many people when checking in, but there is still a queue. The reception service at the front desk is very good and has been upgraded. The most heart-warming thing is the housekeeper Xiao Hao, who not only gave breakfast to the children who had just turned 12 years old, but also added unlimited tickets to the water world, and also gave the two children a little white whale doll. I am honored to meet such a child. Warm-hearted and attentive housekeeper. I will definitely choose Atlantis Hotel next time I come to Sanya.

This hotel doesn't care if people wait for the bus, the management is very chaotic, we wait first The people behind us actually didn't get on the bus. Although the people behind us were picked up by commercial vehicles, they were really humbled. I thought it was like this even before the peak period. In this way, staying in a hotel during the peak period would be more expensive than now, and the service would be worse than now. It feels unfair to think about the money spent. The group of people in front of me didn't even check the order, and there were three people left. Ten people went door-to-door to check orders. I didn’t even understand what a ridiculous operation this was.

In my impression, Atlantis, which is always overcrowded, should be more biased towards self-service and parent-child experience, but I really feel the butler-style service of a top luxury hotel. From checking in to an upgraded room, free minibar extension, hotel park guide, to the final late checkout, Xiaolong Butler made all the arrangements carefully. There are many night activities, including singing and dancing performances by foreigners, water curtain shows, and the dark blue lost ruins scene that is almost reserved for filming at 8 or 9 o'clock. When resting, every room is guaranteed to have an excellent view of the sea. Open the window and you will see the gradient color of the sea! The hotel has its own private beach that is open 24 hours a day. Thanks to this, I secretly completed the proposal of building a Disney castle on the beach. Thank you very much to Atlantis and me, they are equally romantic ~

msg:The moment I stepped into the Atlantis Sanya, it was as if I had entered a sea world full of mystery and fantasy. This luxury resort hotel located in Haitang Bay, Sanya City, Hainan Province, with its unique architectural style and rich entertainment facilities, has become the most unforgettable accommodation experience of my trip.
First of all, the exterior design of the hotel is breathtaking. The entire hotel is like a huge sailing ship, standing on the blue seashore, harmoniously blending with the surrounding natural environment. Walking into the lobby, the spacious and bright space design, coupled with warm lighting and comfortable seats, makes people instantly feel the warmth of home. It is worth mentioning that the fish-shaped chandelier in the lobby can bring its own light show. When we saw the show, we were all wondering what kind of fairy designer could come up with such a magical lobby design.
During my stay, I chose a sea view room, and the hotel upgraded it to a supreme sea view room for me. The room is spacious and well-planned, with complete and brand-new facilities. What surprised me most was that the viewing balcony in the room has an excellent view, overlooking the beautiful scenery of the entire Haitang Bay, and the Wuzhizhou Island not far away seems to be right in front of me. When I woke up in the morning, I stood on the balcony, breathing the fresh sea breeze and admiring the beautiful scenery of the sea and sky, as if the whole world had quieted down.
In addition to the comfortable accommodation environment, the hotel also provides a variety of entertainment facilities. Among them, the most memorable one for me is Atlantis Water World. This water park covering an area of ​​200,000 square meters has dozens of water slides and multiple swimming pools. Whether adults or children, they can find entertainment projects suitable for them here. Our family played in the water world and felt endless joy and excitement. The drone show in the water world at night was also impressive.
In addition, the hotel also has attractions such as an aquarium and C Show Theater. There are all kinds of marine life in the aquarium, which makes me feel like I am in a real underwater world. And the C Show Theater staged a wonderful ocean-themed show, which made me feel the charm of Atlantis culture.
In terms of service, Atlantis Sanya Hotel also did a great job. From check-in to check-out, the hotel staff provided us with warm and thoughtful services. They not only helped us solve various problems, but also provided us with many practical travel suggestions. Here, I felt the warmth and comfort of home. Special mention should be made of the housekeeper Ina who was arranged by the hotel for us. She was warm and generous. After we checked in on the first day, she introduced the hotel to us in time, responded to our needs, and made us feel the warmth of home.
In general, Atlantis Sanya is a luxury resort hotel full of surprises and fun. Whether it is the accommodation environment, entertainment facilities or service quality, it is impressive.

We need to be reminded that we are bringing a four-year-old baby, and the beach is some distance away from the hotel. After the baby plays high, it is indeed a bit far to walk back, so be prepared in advance.
When we left, the baby said she didn’t have enough fun. We promised that she would definitely come again🥳

This is the last stop of this trip. For the children to have fun, we booked Atlantis. We booked a basic room with a view of the sea. It is the best hotel for viewing the sea and the most convenient hotel for the bathroom. The housekeeper Patrick Siyuan will contact us one day in advance to communicate the check-in requirements and tell us the time of the tour projects. The reply speed is very fast, all problems can be solved, and gifts are given to children. The children are really very happy. It is better to stay at least for two nights. One day is not enough to play. I only went to the unlimited entry and exit aquarium and water world tickets once, and I didn't go to the beach. There are also explanations in the aquarium. Beluga whales will swim over to see the children, and it is also beautiful to take pictures. The Poseidon Tower project in Water World is very exciting. My child and I are very happy, but we must pay attention to sun protection. Because some reviews on the Internet are not good enough, I only tried to book one night. In fact, it is very fun, and two nights are more cost-effective. I can play again when the child is older.

msg:The hotel is located in the Atlantis campus. It is quite luxurious and the stay experience is also very good. I booked a 2-night package with Water World and Aquarium. The water world and aquarium are conveniently located on the first floor of the hotel, and the mermaid show is quite good. Behind the hotel is the swimming pool, bar and beach. The environment is great and you can go out on a motorboat for 100 yuan. The duty-free city is also nearby

There is no underground parking lot in the hotel. If you are driving or renting a car, it is best to contact the hotel in advance to help pick up your luggage. It is recommended to enter through the 3rd west door of the hotel and register your mobile phone number when checking in.

In addition, Ms. Ina is really enthusiastic and thoughtful in service and reminders. Big thumbs up👍🏻

The hotel is very high, and you can overlook the surrounding scenery from the room, whether it is the sea view or the hotel park view~
The water world is very interesting, and there are many projects for adults and children. I strongly recommend the two projects of Poseidon Tower, which are very exciting and must be tried!
The hotel park is densely wooded and feels like a tropical rainforest. It is suitable for a relaxing walk. If you want to go to the beach, it is not far away and you can walk there in a few minutes~
Finally, thank the hotel's exclusive butler Patrick Siyuan for his thoughtful service and gave a detailed introduction to all the contents of the hotel~

The hotel staff contacted me the day before check-in to ask about my check-in requirements. When checking in, they considerately upgraded us to the Supreme Sea View Room. From the balcony, we could see the water world and the unbeatable sea view. It was so beautiful. The room was spacious and comfortable, and it was also equipped with a capsule coffee machine, which was very convenient. The next day, the hotel housekeeper Ina contacted me and carefully introduced the hotel's facilities and entertainment projects to me. She especially considerately marked the opening hours of the water world and the aquarium, which was very convenient for the tour. At the same time, a fruit platter and a small aquarium gift were also provided, which was really thoughtful. This hotel stay was a great experience in terms of both facilities and hotel services!

msg:Because the entire hotel opened earlier, the rooms are more ordinary than hotels of the same type that opened later. But the value of Atlantis does not lie in this. Its value lies in the rich activities and entertainment areas in the park. We went in and out of the Light and Water World several times, as well as the aquarium. It's very cinematic and beautiful inside. There is an undersea restaurant in the hotel. From the viewing position, you can see various fish in the aquarium up close. If you have the budget, you can try this French restaurant. The entire meal lasted nearly two hours, the service was perfect, and it was really filling. During the off-season, you can ask the hotel for room upgrades, which will basically be met. Take your family on vacation next time
Free upgrade to supreme sea view room depending on room availability: basically sufficient in off-season

msg:I went out to play with my friend's family. The friend's family is a family of three. Our family is traveling with the elderly and children. The friend's family upgraded to a suite. My family has a twin room. Four people are crowded into one room, and the children cannot play. After checking in, the drinks in the refrigerator were basically empty and not replenished. There were not enough slippers and the size was wrong. The children couldn't wear them. I had to call and ask for them. After asking for them for a long time, they didn't come to replenish them. I went to play in a friend's room. Sterilizer, small toilet, small slippers, small whale (I asked for it, I was told to apply for it when I checked out, but my friend's was delivered to the room when he checked in), etc. I realized that there were so many things that I didn't have. I called the hotel front desk to explain the situation. The hotel still didn’t believe me, right? Think I lied and said I have a friend who wants me to give my room number! In short, the check-in experience was not good. There was very little for the baby to play with. There was nothing for the baby to play in the hotel room. If you asked me, it was not available. Even the small train was charged separately! The aquarium is too small for babies, so babies are scared. If you want to experience the water world, you should buy a separate ticket~

The children were so happy! I will stay here again next time I come to Haitang Bay!

Special mention should be made of the housekeeper Emma Fu, whose professional service made us feel warm and surprised. From the beginning of check-in, Emma arranged small surprises such as bouquets and birthday cakes for us throughout the whole process, making us feel the warmth of home. 
What made us even more memorable was that she also assisted us in booking seats at the underwater restaurant, allowing us to spend a romantic birthday dinner in the underwater world. 
The hotel environment is clean and tidy, and the facilities are first-class, especially the water world and the dolphin theater, which brought us endless joy. 
The water world has a variety of equipment, which is exciting and fun, and the dolphin theater allows us to watch the lovely dolphin performance up close. 
In addition, the C show performance in the evening is a shocking audio-visual feast, which left us with a deep impression of Atlantis Hotel. 
Whether you want a romantic vacation or a family trip, Atlantis Hotel can meet your needs. 
Highly recommended to all friends, especially the caring service of housekeeper Emma, ​​will definitely make your journey more pleasant and memorable!

msg:We brought children aged 2-4 on this trip. Many projects in Atlantis cannot be played because of height requirements. However, if you bring older children, they should be very happy. The aquarium can be visited by small children. The children are very happy. Water World is basically for playing in the wave pool and children's pool.
I felt the popularity of the hotel. We went there in the off-season, and there were still a lot of people. The hotel service was good. We held the sleeping child and were directly guided by the service staff to the VIP room for check-in. There was a sofa inside for adults to hold the sleeping child. In addition, the service of the housekeeper Andy was also good. He sent us a lot of schedules of activities and performances on WeChat. If you have any questions, you can ask him in time.

One thing that is not good is that some projects in Atlantis ended at six o'clock. Because it was too sunny during the day, I hope to have more time to play at night. I have to come again at 10 o'clock the next day. In addition, the light show at night was not allowed to enter at around 7:46, which felt a bit early.
In addition, it is recommended to add some sunshade lounge chairs on the beach of Atlantis, and the holiday sand pond is equipped with lounge chairs, which greatly increases the comfort.

The business, entertainment, scenery, room facilities, and services are all first-class, making people feel relaxed and happy🌸😊 After living here, I still want to stay, after playing, I still want to play, and I can’t bear to leave!
It is worth mentioning that there is a very beautiful tree-lined path behind the hotel, which is full of tropical plants. I heard that the hotel spent a lot of money on these plants! I think many people come to Atletis for the water world, aquarium, swimming pool, and sea. Few people mention that the plant landscape here is also very beautiful! Those with children can take a walk so that children can learn more about tropical plants while playing.
The business of the hotel is also very good. It is very convenient to go to the Water World Aquarium. If it is a rainy day, you can also go to the mini camp and go shopping in the commercial street. In short, you don’t have to worry about being bored at night or on rainy days😊
Finally, I would like to praise the excellent service of Yate. Their butler service is very good. Our butler Xiao He will proactively remind us of the facilities, time, and services that we can use from accommodation, dining, entertainment, check-out, etc. If there is any problem When we asked him, he responded immediately and prepared a small gift for us. It was really thoughtful to meet such a good butler. Thank you😊
Overall, the experience of staying at Atlantis was very good! I really want to do it a hundred times again😄😄

The stay is very comfortable. Vacation is about relaxation and comfort! The hotel's design, environment, rooms, catering, entertainment, and services are different from other hotels. The comprehensive service is perfect②
Atlantis Water World is a water world for young people
♥️♥️♥️Recommended attractions:
Poseidon's Leap: Slide down from a height of nearly 8 meters, stand in a transparent launch cabin, and fall in free fall. It's really exciting! Sea Rage Roller Coaster: You need to take a three-person raft, which can be played by three or two people at the same time, and follow the water flow to watch the sharks and manta rays in the glass wall. Octopus Racing: It is suitable for many friends to play together, because you can compete to see who can slide farther. Adults and children can rush, and the whole track is ups and downs. Shark Crossing: Feel the thrill and excitement of being surrounded by sharks at close range. Rotating Big Speaker in the House Shop: In the nearly six-story high big speaker, you can experience the feeling of instant weightlessness. ♥️♥️♥️Rafting is my personal favorite. I like stable sports when I am older. I lie in the raft and look up at the sky. It is comfortable and relaxing. Pay attention to sun protection for the whole body, which is easy to get sunburned! Be sure to do a good job of sun protection, 🌞 wear sun protection clothes! Many projects will encounter direct sunlight in the open air when queuing, which is easy to get sunburned. Prepare a mobile phone in advance for the place where you play in the water. The cabinet in the park charges 25 yuan, and you can choose to pick up the items in the middle. Shoes are not allowed in all activities. Remember to prepare beach shoes. Try not to bring bracelets and necklaces to avoid scratches when playing exciting activities.
The hotel breakfast is very rich, 7:00-11:00
♥️♥️♥️VS housekeeper Amy, warm and thoughtful service, the child had a great time in the water park and didn’t want to leave. The check-out was a bit late, and the housekeeper Amy applied for a free delay. Thank you.
The hotel’s private beach has very fine sand, and the lawn coconut trees 🥥 lounge chairs rest and blow the sea breeze, which is very comfortable
Various types of swimming pools in the hotel meet the needs of lying flat and traveling with children
♥️♥️♥️C show is also good, the water show is worth seeing, and the children like it very much
♥️♥️♥️Aquarium with various intimate interaction projects with dolphins and other small animals
The hotel can be played for three days◎Atlantis must not miss the comprehensive hotel

Atlantis in off-peak season is really delicious, and my kids like it very much. They keep telling me that they want to come back next time~

facility:
We booked a sea-view twin room on the 32nd floor. The view is very good and we can watch the sea quietly. The elevator is very fast and the bed is very big. We can comfortably accommodate two adults and one child.
Serve:
After checking in, our cute little butler Terry turned on the phone and thoughtfully sent us a guide to visiting the aquarium, a map of Water World, travel instructions, must-do activities, etc. In fact, we didn’t have much expectations for the service at the beginning. Yes, but classmate Terry was almost always responsive, responsive and very considerate. Knowing that we had children, he thoughtfully gave us carefully selected gifts, and finally helped us delay check-out. I was really touched.
Also, Miss Wang Li from Water World Aquarium gave a very wonderful explanation, which helped the children understand a lot about marine life. Thank you very much for your patient answers.
breakfast:
The restaurant is very big. We chose the Saffron Restaurant. It was a pity that we didn't get the pizza. I heard that it was a sign and it happened to be unavailable today. The Baoluo noodles are very delicious, the wontons are a big size with shrimps, free ice cream, free candies, and free baked goods make the children very happy.

health:
very nice! Very secure.

Thank you Atlantis for bringing a wonderful experience to the children, come on 💪

In addition, many items in Water World are sold out three times, and the queue time is very short, which is very delicious!

The water world and the aquarium are also very good. There are few people and no queues. It's very comfortable to play!

msg:The hotel has a good environment and a superior location. The front desk service is warm and thoughtful. The room cleaning is very timely and efficient. The staff are very dedicated and can handle problems in time. They put themselves in the shoes of the guests. A very satisfactory stay experience!

This time I booked a sea view king room, and the hotel upgraded it to a supreme king room for me. The room layout is also excellent, with complete facilities, spacious and comfortable, especially the comfort of the bed is highly praised. While enjoying the hotel's attentive service, I can also enjoy the beautiful sea view, which is really comfortable.

The hotel's dining facilities are also commendable. Whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner, the quality and taste of the dishes are impressive. Especially their seafood dishes, fresh and delicious, which are endless aftertaste. In addition, the beaches and shopping facilities near the hotel are also unforgettable.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the stay experience at Atlantis. I am deeply impressed by the hotel's service, facilities and environment. Butler Patrick contacted us enthusiastically before check-in, and quickly helped us solve the small episodes that happened later. He greeted me every day and gave me a gift before leaving. I am really grateful for Patrick's enthusiastic service. I highly recommend this hotel if you are planning a vacation to Sanya. I look forward to returning one day to experience more of it.

msg:Although there are many hotels to choose from in Haitang Bay, I still chose Atlantis. Although the price is more expensive than that of ordinary five-star hotels, as a parent-child resort hotel, the advantage of Atlantis is that you can bring young children to the water world and aquarium unlimited times. It is so friendly! We can go out for lunch at noon and go back to the hotel to rest, and then go back to the park in the afternoon. And I love the water world myself. I go up to all the exciting projects and then take my child to swim in the wave pool. The child loves water rafting and shark adventure. The hotel housekeeper Emma added WeChat to send check-in reminders early in the morning, which saved me a lot of trouble. The hotel has a unique beach. Because we mainly went to the water world and the aquarium, we didn’t go to the beach to take a walk. I will come again next time if I have the chance.

Atlantis is really worth spending 2-3 days in. You can spend two days in the hotel. When you check in, the housekeeper Xiao Yuan will carefully introduce the hotel's facilities, places to play, and the location of the restaurant here. The C show is worth watching. You can ask you about the water world all day long. There are restaurants inside. Guests staying in the hotel can get towels for free. There are also many performances, and they are very coherent. The hotel can walk directly to the beach. Next to the hotel is a super-large international duty-free city, which is very close. It's really good, just like the small sign on the tea straw here "In Atlantis, I don't have time to miss you" hahaha The lobby is also very busy at night. Sitting in the lobby in a daze in the early hours of the morning, you can also see guests arriving one after another. This is a very satisfactory 5.1 holiday. Thank you for the caring and enthusiastic service of the housekeeper Xiao Yuan, which makes this May Day holiday a good memory.

msg:The housekeeper Patrick responded quickly. As a hotel of this price, this service is OK, nothing to complain about. But the hotel management obviously has problems. I bought the VIP lounge to check in, so as not to queue up and save time, but in fact, the staff inside had no sense of service of high-end hotels. They did not check in in order. Whoever stood at the front desk would check in first. When we questioned them, they would only argue that there were not so many people on weekdays. Then, how come such a hotel, a hotel with about 1,500 rooms, a hotel for families, and a hotel that has been in operation for several years, does not have such a management system for high traffic during holidays? In addition, the vehicles at the entrance of the hotel were disorderly, and the staff did not know how to guide them. When we went there, we should get off at the entrance of the hotel, but we were asked to go to the parking lot by the staff. When we left to catch the plane, the cars that stayed in front and behind for a long time and the bus on the left blocked us for a long time. Now they keep asking consumers to write good reviews. If they don't write, it will affect the salary of innocent housekeepers. This management system and this salary system are problematic. In the end, it should not be the consumers who spend money on vacation, nor the housekeepers who have completed their work who should bear this.

From the first moment I checked in, I was shocked by its unparalleled comfort and luxury. The Supreme Suite is not only spacious and well-designed, but also has quality and luxury in every detail. It also has a breathtaking sea view, making people feel like they are in a wonderland where the sea and the sky are one. In terms of dining, I was deeply impressed by the "Hell's Kitchen Restaurant", "Undersea Restaurant" and "Songhelou" of the Atlantis Hotel. Each restaurant has its own unique flavor and characteristics. Whether it is the creative Western food of the Hell's Kitchen Restaurant, the romantic sea view of the Undersea Restaurant, or the exquisite Chinese cuisine of Songhelou, my taste buds have enjoyed an unprecedented feast. Especially the Undersea Restaurant, its unique dining environment makes every meal an unforgettable experience. Xiaoyan, the hotel's full-time housekeeper, provided me with full and meticulous service. Whether it is the daily care of the room or the arrangement of the itinerary, Xiaoyan can think of it in advance and handle it properly, making me feel relaxed and comfortable throughout the holiday without worrying about any trivial matters. In addition, the hotel also provides a variety of entertainment activities, including the large-scale C show, dolphin interaction, beluga interaction and helicopter experience. Each of them made me feel a different kind of fun. Especially the helicopter experience, overlooking the beautiful scenery of Sanya from the air, gave me a new understanding of this city. In short, the supreme suites, exquisite dining, attentive butler service and rich entertainment experience of Atlantis Sanya Hotel together constitute an unforgettable holiday. For friends who pursue quality and enjoyment, I strongly recommend Atlantis Sanya Hotel, I believe it can bring you a unique luxury experience.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the coffee latte art made by the breakfast guy at the hotel is much better than the coffee made by the self-service coffee machine. In short, it is a hotel worth visiting again~

msg:The room at the end of the hotel is extremely dim. When checking in, I thought I was easy to talk to and was given a single room in the corner. I didn't care at first, but when it got dark, I found that the room was so dim that I thought the light was broken. I contacted the front desk to ask someone to come and help check the light, but no one came. I called and urged them again and again, and they finally came. It's terrible. The staff who helped with the check-in were not trained properly before they started working. The hotel check-in introduction was equal to 0. It was the first time I checked in and I had no idea where the water world breakfast c show was. I had to ask by myself. At least I could tell them which floor the breakfast was on. The guests had to ask everywhere and check their phones. The hotel was full of various salespeople, like a vegetable market. I took breakfast and took something. My child had to go to the toilet and he hadn't eaten yet. When he came back from the toilet, all the things were taken away. I clearly said hello and said he was going to the bathroom, but when he came back, the things were gone. The waiter blamed me for not saying anything. There was a sign on the table saying "dining is in progress", why didn't I look at it? The waiter was also willful and poured out all the breakfast that I hadn't eaten. It was really a waste. He didn't feel sorry for causing me trouble at all.

However, when we first arrived at the hotel, the staff at the door turned a blind eye and asked us, the elderly and children, to drag us into the hotel by ourselves. This was the only time we stayed in three hotels. Atlantis is suitable for older children. There is basically nothing to play for children under 1.22 meters tall, and the service attitude of the staff in the park is very poor.

I am very grateful to my housekeeper Patrick Siyuan. The room he booked for me was very good, clean, bright, and you can see the unbeatable sea view when you open the window. The most worry-free thing is that you can take the children to eat, drink and have fun. You can go directly to the water world when you arrive at the hotel. The lazy river is really fun. The children didn't want to come out after playing for a long time. There are many lifeguards and it is very safe. There are two restaurants for breakfast with many dishes. The saffron on the left is more Western, and the colorful crystal on the right is more Chinese. Guests staying in the hotel can go to the lost space and water world unlimited times. The mermaid show, C show, and white whale science show are so exciting. It's good to bring children to play.

I was really amazed by the aquarium and water world, which far exceeded the amusement facilities of other attractions, and the aquatic creatures were in excellent living conditions. During the stay, the Sun Butler service was warm and thoughtful, and answered and solved problems in a timely manner, which enhanced the hotel stay experience!

msg:It was my first time to stay at Atlantis. I read some things on the Internet saying that the service here was not good. I was quite nervous when I made the reservation, but I thought that a hotel at this price would not be any worse. I was surprised by the result. I felt that the service exceeded the price. First of all, Davis, the butler, was really considerate. He gave me fruits and small gifts for the children. He also sent me some hotel schedules in advance every day. Anyway, I just felt like I was in this hotel. There is always someone taking care of you. This hotel is really big and there is a lot to do. Because the children have a short vacation, I only stayed here for two days this time. I feel that I didn’t get to play in many places. I will stay for a few more days next time. , there is no need to question the service, absolutely super five-star! The room is also large and the decoration style is very nice.
There are also many food and shops inside, including duty-free shops. It’s really good. You don’t have to go out. This hotel is really worth the money!

Thumbs up for this butler again! Just for you, I have to come next time!

msg:I won’t say much about the overall environment of this 7-star hotel. It’s high-end. The rooms are spacious and bright. From the balcony, you can directly overlook the water world, C show venue, and swimming pool. The view is very good. When you stay in the hotel, you can have unlimited visits to the water world and aquarium. You get a free C We did a show once, Water World is quite fun, but there is a height requirement for children, 1.22cm or above. We just played with the children without leaving the hotel at all. 4 days and 3 nights is more suitable, with enough time. The 2nd night was a bit nervous, just to take photos. The seaside lawn and family swimming pool are cancelled, only the beach can be taken (complimentary)
Thank you to the butler Jackson for his warm and professional service. He also gave the children gifts. I am very happy.

[Room] It looks quite big. The gold card saves me the Supreme Sea View Room. Although it is still a side sea view, it is already very good. The room facilities are also very good, with free drinks from the minibar and a capsule coffee machine. The key point is that the sound insulation is very good👍. There was no sound at all during the 2 days I stayed there.

[Service] 95% of the staff have very good attitudes. The front desk reception, mini camp and aquarium fish pond are especially nice. The housekeeper 👨💼 Xiaomo is enthusiastic and positive, helping, and also giving souvenirs. Thank you very much.

[Entertainment] 🌊 Water World is very fun and worth going. The aquarium is slightly small, but it is free for hotel guests. C show is average, but hotel guests have a preferential price of 200/person, so you can just look around and kill time.

❤️In general, stay in the hotel as much as possible, which will be much more convenient in all aspects. I will buy again when I go to Sanya next time~

The only regret is that there are more publicity for paid activities, but no publicity for free activities. We didn't see it until we were about to leave. It is recommended to make a check-in notice for free parent-child activities in the future

msg:When I arrived at the hotel at 10 o'clock in the morning, there were not many people in the lobby. There was no queue for check-in in the VIP room. There were not many people in the lobby at this time. Friends who arrive in the morning don’t need to pay too much attention to this opportunity. Helped with luggage storage.
The VIP room service staff helped arrange the earliest room to be cleaned. I received a text message reminder at 12 o'clock, received the room card, and checked in.
Tell me the advantages
1. Go early for breakfast, lunch and dinner on the 48th floor. There are not many people. The environment is better and you can dine with sea view.
2. The room is on the 48th floor, with a good sea view and no obstruction.
3. The butler Xiao Ruan was attentive and answered all our questions. He also paid attention to us after the next day's break.
4. A small gift was given after leaving the store.
5. We played a project in Water World and there was a lot of queues. We planned to buy a fast pass. The salesperson told us that there were many queues for this project, but there may not be many others. Let us take a closer look. As it turns out, it’s really not much, saving an extra expense.
6. The check-out luggage cart will help transport the luggage to the parking lot throughout the check-out process, and the service is considerate.
7. On the way to the beach, there was a special person reminding you not to do private activities. It is very risky. This is very considerate.
There are a lot of flaws
1. There are quite a lot of people in the Lost Aquarium, and there are a lot of children and they are noisy. The exhibition area has many small windows and does not have the feeling of an underwater world. Finished shopping in half an hour. It’s better to take care of children.
2. After the room is confirmed, the luggage will not be sent to the room immediately. You need to wait for a while or pick it up yourself. Maybe it's because there are so many people staying.
3. The hotel does not have any travel guide or location map, so we just rely on street signs and asking for directions.
4. A room of 3500 yuan does not have whole-house intelligence.
5. There are too few types of meals at Atlantis Club. There are only six or seven hot dishes, without any local characteristics.
6. The sound insulation of the room is poor. There are various sounds in the corridor early in the morning, which directly wakes me up and makes me unable to sleep. The closing sound of other rooms is very loud, which is not friendly for vacation.
7. There is no tour map of Water World, so you can check it all by yourself on your mobile phone.
8. The infinity pool closes very early, so remember to go before 19:00.
9. There are almost no snacks in the evening.

All in all, I am quite satisfied. Friends with children can order with confidence, and it is great for children to play with. You can choose again when you are on vacation or on a business trip.

I will call in advance to inquire about my needs, and then I will actually arrange a quiet room facing the sea on a high floor as needed~ From the time I checked in at the front desk, I felt that the staff at Atlantis provided professional service. I must praise the dedicated butler Xiao Yuan for his attentive service. He is also serious, responds promptly to customers’ needs, and is very considerate of us👍
The room is large, fully equipped, and has its own swimming pool. The number of security guards is very reassuring. The hotel is also very close to the beach. The fine sand of Haitang Bay is not scratchy at all. The hotel also provides travel photography services. The traveling photographer is very skilled ~
The aquarium in Atlantis is my favorite. Hotel guests can enter the aquarium unlimitedly by swiping their faces. It’s really friendly to fish lovers ❤️The water world is also super fun! Go there when it opens in the morning, and you can be the first to queue up for fun activities❤️ While others are queuing up, we have already finished playing twice! It’s simply not that exciting!

The staff took the initiative to ask if it was cold and if I needed it. We covered ourselves with a blanket and ate the crabs included in the set meal. Xiao Wen, the housekeeper at the restaurant, thoughtfully prepared the special nougat for the little dolphins for the children. The taste was very good. The sun was shining brightly on the day we were leaving. The scenery was so beautiful that I couldn’t bear to leave. I stayed at the beach for half a day and checked out. It went smoothly with Xiaowen's help.

Overall, I am very satisfied. I booked the Royal Sea View and was unexpectedly upgraded to a suite. The balcony overlooks the entire water world and leisure area. The housekeeper Terry Xiaoxu was very enthusiastic and provided a lot of help, including hotel maps, check-in locations, and introductions to popular projects. Water world is fun! It is recommended to wear a sun-protective swimsuit. The aquarium is even better, with so many species of creatures.

msg:I came here for vacation during the Spring Festival. I was not sure about the itinerary before booking. The price seemed to have skyrocketed. It was more than three times the usual price for the same room type. I specially chose to come here on the second day of the ***** New Year for my children. This place must be a paradise for children. There are a lot of projects. Let me start with the shortcomings. Parking is quite inconvenient and far away. Especially for first-timers without a reservation, it is very unfriendly to park at the entrance gate from a distance. Fortunately, there are battery cars. Specialized pick-up and drop-off made up for this shortcoming. There is also a beach. The sand is very fine. It has natural advantages, good location and good quality. The only thing is that it mainly operates indoor entertainment facilities. After all, this is a big money-making project. Public vacations such as beaches are basically unmanaged, with an iron gate. Once locked, visitors can go out to the beach on their own during the day. In addition, the paper bags in the guest rooms are not good and strong. It is recommended that the place where water play is mainly used can be equipped with a slightly stronger reusable bag (anyway, our room only has paper bags, and I saw other guests carrying large reusable bags). In addition to the unusually high prices during the Spring Festival Everything is fine except for the money. The aquarium is crowded because it is open to the public. Fortunately, I stayed in a hotel. After watching the C show, I went to the aquarium at 9 and half. It was almost reserved and there was no crowding. This is the only place where I can stay in a hotel. Benefits. Let’s talk about the good points. It’s very clean, the service is reliable, and the food is of high quality. The food in the shopping street is not cheap, but the quality is acceptable. I have experienced it in several stores and the quality is recognized. In addition, check-out is also very convenient, because the children and their families played crazy at the beach and refused to go back, and it was time to check-out again. The gift department arranged for the luggage to be properly stored after a phone call, so guests did not have to worry at all. As a seven-star service, It's impossible to fault. The staff is very friendly and helpful in answering all questions. Overall, I'm quite satisfied. My family thinks it's average, but I overall agree with the objective evaluation. Many expensive hotels may not be able to keep up with the service.

msg:Understood, the following is a regenerated review of the experience of staying at Atlantis Sanya:
 
Staying at Atlantis Sanya is an unforgettable experience. The hotel's exterior design is unique and incorporates marine elements, making people feel like they are in a dreamy ocean world.
 
Entering the room, you are immediately struck by the spacious and bright space and high-quality decoration. The bedding is comfortable and soft, allowing you to have a good night's sleep. The facilities in the room are all available, and the quality is evident in every detail.
 
The hotel's catering is excellent, whether it's seafood or local specialties, it's endlessly memorable. In addition, the hotel also has rich entertainment facilities, and the water world and aquarium are a highlight, bringing endless joy and surprises to guests.
 
What's more worth mentioning is that the hotel's service is very attentive. The employees always greet every guest with a smile, making people feel like home. Here, you can enjoy the leisure and comfort of vacation.

I would especially like to commend the hotel housekeeper in charge this time, Miss Maggie, for her very considerate service and all kinds of warm reminders. She always responded instantly when contacted and all the problems were solved!
 
Overall, Atlantis Sanya provides an unparalleled stay experience and I will choose this hotel again next time I have the opportunity.

msg:There are a lot of weird things that happen to you when you go out. The key is your ability to deal with problems. No one wants to go out and find something unhappy. There is no need to spend money to make yourself angry. There is no need to dwell on the specific details. If anything happens, you will be high-profile. That's easy to solve.
Staying at Atlantis this time is also a long-cherished dream. Good things may not end well if they take a long time. There is nothing that cannot be solved by being upright and upright in everything you do.
To give an overview of this stay, there are no problems with the hotel's scale, facilities and functions. Xiaoyan (Zhang Yan)'s housekeeping service is also very good, and she has certain work and coordination skills. The weak children can complete the government 12345 and travel by themselves. If something cannot be solved in three days, as a guest, it depends on the butler's sincerity and compromise.
The hotel also performed well in the later period. After listening to Xiaoyan's suggestion, it actively arranged the hotel's commercial vehicle to take us back to the Phoenix Island Resort Hotel.
There was nothing dissatisfactory about my stay this time, but the service at the Xipin restaurant was still insufficient. Those who make suggestions are not necessarily provoking troubles, which is beneficial to the hotel's rectification. Guests check in to experience the hotel service. If the service is not good, no matter how wealthy the hotel is, it will not be top-notch.
There are two restaurants in the hotel, one is the "Saffron" restaurant. The service staff there is very good. We didn't comment much on the quality of the food we had at the buffet last night in this restaurant. The service was very satisfactory and the restaurant management is well managed.
We had breakfast at the Colorful Crystal Restaurant. As soon as you enter the restaurant, the waiter who greets you will force you to sit in a corner. This is because the restaurant waiter wants to make it convenient for himself and tries to force the guests to gather in one place to get their meals. It is inconvenient. Eating in nooks and crannies, and not giving up your seat at a table with a bright view. This is a rule set by the hotel manager. Unbelievable. This peasant-like management style of small citizens should be resolutely abolished. You are trying to save trouble. Guests can be grievances. This is a seven-star hotel. According to management logic, hotel executives must correct these practices that save trouble for their own work and ignore the feelings of customers.
In short, I can find faults for you to show that I am serious about experiencing the experience of staying. This is absolutely not the case I can experience in major well-known hotels at home and abroad.
In other cases, the room service is very good, but the humanization of some depar**ents is too poor and should be corrected.
I will definitely experience it again if I have the chance!

msg:For me, who is pursuing off-peak travel, this is the first time I have seen such a busy hotel. The entire lobby was very crowded and busy. When we arrived at the hotel, the luggage carts that had been coded by the concierge and were ready to be sent away were all lined up. There were so many people eating, shopping, and playing in the water. It felt more like a hotel than a place to play. An all-in-one integrated resort.

The guest room is relatively quiet. Due to maintenance, we did not experience the polar rafting in Water World. However, the children were so happy playing in the wave pool that they refused to get up. The fish in the aquarium are also very shocking, several times larger than the fish in ordinary aquariums...! Groupers, golden pomfret, turtles, etc. are so shocking.

Our flight is quite late. So I only stayed for 3 days and 2 nights, and I checked out in the morning and went to the airport on the last day. It feels very inadequate. The children are eager to soak in the water every day. I feel that 4 days and 3 nights is a better choice.

The exclusive butler Xiao Yuan provides services at any time and is very considerate. As soon as I checked in, I received a children's toilet and exquisite small gifts. Let’s wait until the kids are a little older before brushing again!

msg:It has been more than a month since I came to Sanya before the Spring Festival. In the last few days, I went on a hotel experience tour, and Atlantis was the second hotel. When you arrive at the hotel, the check-in hall is lively but orderly. There is a dedicated person at the door to pick up your luggage, store it, and deliver it to your room. Fortunately, the hotel upgraded me to a suite with a view for free when I checked in. It was very large, with an area of ​​105 square meters. The hotel has a wide range of activities, most of which are suitable for parent-child activities. We two retired old people just want to watch the excitement, Water World Night Club, Atlantis Night, Water Trapeze, Drone Show, Laser Projection, fantastic performances, all worth watching. Special praise should be given to the hotel’s butler service, which is a true person-to-person butler service. Our butler Belle proactively informs us in advance from check-in to show time, hotel route, dining location, and check-out procedures after adding WeChat. , the service is very considerate. They also took the initiative to ask if they needed to change to latex pillows or buckwheat pillows. I slept with latex pillows at home, and Jiali Butler asked the waiter to deliver them to the room. I left the hotel and went to the next hotel, and the beautiful butler asked me if I had completed the registration procedures. Thinking about what we want and providing what we need embodies the connotation of butler service.

There is a lot of mineral water in the room, 8 bottles, and the drinks in the refrigerator are free. The beach is very close, with few people and clean. There are free foot-washing faucets and beach chairs (not many) on the beach. The housekeeper Xiao Hao is very considerate and answers all questions. Because there are children, he even gives a small gift. Check-out is also very convenient, just leave the room card in the room. If you have children who love playing in the water world, Atlantis is highly recommended.

We went to get the room card to enter the room. We were assigned a room on the 53rd floor. We were pleasantly surprised as soon as we entered. Not only were there welcome fruits, but the children were also given stuffed toys of dolphins and beluga whales, one for each person. From entering the store to leaving, we were told when to send messages to Belle during the entire process. All replied instantly. We checked out at around 7 a.m. to catch our flight and sent her a message that she was already at work. Super considerate hotel butler. I will definitely look for her again in the future.

When we got to the front desk, we were upgraded to a room type facing the upper floors of Water World. I was really happy! The hardware and environment here can be said to be first-class in the country, and the service is also very good. The day before we checked in, the hotel called us to inquire about the check-in time. When we arrived at the hotel door, someone guided us to the counter to check in. As soon as we got the room card, someone helped us bring it to the room. We put it down as a courtesy. The hotel’s butler was on WeChat. We sent a welcome message, introduced guest rights and hotel activity arrangements, and responded to your needs on WeChat at any time. When you leave the room, whether it's the restaurant, aquarium, water world, swimming pool or public area, there are staff everywhere you look. Stayed here for two nights and felt like I was being cared for by the hotel. It is very important to travel during off-peak hours, but of course there is nothing you can do if you can’t do it. After the 15th, I feel that there will be fewer people, but there will still be long queues at restaurants and popular entertainment projects. At this time, you will find that everyone is waiting in line very quietly, and the hotel will have a dedicated person to guide each wave of guests. and arrangements. In this way, even if there are many people, there will be no competition or disputes between guests. The hotel does a good job in this regard. The guests here are also very well-educated. At some popular photo spots, I mostly saw mutual humility and conscious queuing, with very little fighting or crowding. Eat, live, play and shop all in one, with a good environment and first-class service. Our three days and two nights here were a great experience. Looking forward to coming again next time.

The check-in procedure is very smooth. There is a dedicated butler Cherry who provides travel guides for the entire hotel and thoughtfully helps arrange the itinerary.
Although I had a little trouble due to water leakage when I first checked into the hotel, Cherry helped solve the problem and provided a series of compensation measures and solutions. I am still satisfied with the hotel service.

When you come to the hotel, you must go to Water World. You have a lot of fun. It is almost all-inclusive. All facilities are available. There is also a food court nearby. Renting a car is enough to visit all the facilities in Haitang Bay.

Hotel guests enjoy free parking, tax-free coupons and other benefits. Compared with other places, it is still very good value. Recommended travel

Unlimited facial swipes at the aquarium and water world. Stayed on the 38th floor with an ocean view. The room was clean and there were plenty of bottles of drinking water. Overall Not a bad experience. The butler Clara provided good service. After checking in, she added WeChat and took the initiative to arrange the bus to the airport and late check-out. She also gave the baby 2 beluga dolls, which the baby loved very much. I just complained that the last bus to the airport was 1:30, which was too early, so I ended up taking the Westin's 5:30 bus. For breakfast, I suggest that if you are not in a hurry, don’t care about the sea view, and don’t want to be clean, try B1 Saffron and Colorful Crystal. They are rich in variety and taste good. They also have ice cream for breakfast, but you have to queue after 9 o’clock. We had breakfast on the first day at the Royal Palace on the 18th floor. When dining at the club, the food is so simple that one doubts the quality of the hotel's breakfast. The quality of the Saffron Buffet Dinner is okay, there are cocktails to choose from, and the hotel can order a variety of takeaways. Basically, Haitang Bay doesn't have to worry about eating, as there are all kinds of choices. My child, who is 4 and a half years old, doesn't like to talk and play in the water. He is not interested in the water world at all, so he went to take a few photos. The pink powder was very beautiful at night, and there were performances. I went to the aquarium many times, and there were mermaid and beluga performances. The hotel not only has its own guests, but also guests from other places in Sanya coming to check in. It is generally noisy, especially in the lobby. It is suitable for babies who like to play in amusement parks. It is not recommended for leisure travel. Anyway, if you have never been there, it is good to experience it.

The experience of staying here this year was particularly good because of the attentive service of the butler Xiao Fan, who answered all our questions and provided many details that we didn't know. Thank you very much. There will be a queue after 9 o'clock for breakfast, and the hotel will give out small desserts to those in line. The entire hotel is full of details. Looking forward to your next stay!

msg:It's a smart choice to stay at Yate. Various water sports are barrier-free and guests staying in the hotel can play unlimited times.
Service: I have to mention the service of Yate here. Everyone says that the service of EDISON is very good. Yate is suitable for parent-child travel. I have stayed at both hotels and would like to share my experience. The housekeeper Yat is very good. The housekeeper I stayed in is called Sun Housekeeper, and he responds almost 24 hours a day. Constantly greeting and caring, always reminding me of the start time of the performance and various trivial matters such as dining conditions in the restaurant. At the same time, any small items needed in the room will be arranged immediately. For a hotel with such a huge occupancy rate, the housekeepers are responsible for providing meticulous and thoughtful services. Guests must give positive reviews.
Secondly, I have to mention Xiao Li at the front desk. A very amiable boy. I made a request for a room with a particularly good view, and the occupancy rate was very high that day. It was the weekend and he was very patient in making arrangements for us. This time Yate gives high praise. Staying for two days felt too short. It should be arranged to go in 3 days.

You can check in empty-handed, and you will be notified by text message when the room is cleaned. There is butler service. Jenny Wu sent me water world and aquarium travel guides, registered my license plate, and gave me a check-in gift. If I have any questions, she can respond promptly. This time they upgraded the room for us, and the room was super big. After checking into the room, the attendant will help deliver your luggage to the room. You don't need to check out by yourself. You only need to put your luggage and room card in the room, and the waiter will help store it. So we checked out and went to the beach for a while. The Pink Night performance in the evening is also quite good. It seems that the performance has been non-stop since the afternoon.

The hotel service is top notch and their service is all round. In advance, before I checked in, the housekeeper contacted me to understand my check-in needs, etc. During the incident, after I checked in, the housekeeper Xiao Xu sent me water world, aquarium tour guide, breakfast meal time, dining location selection, and best photos. Location, etc., guided us in every detail, and gave us souvenirs when we left, which made us feel very warm; the cleaning lady was also very careful and clean, even the data cable I put on the bedside table was clean. Help me get around it, see picture 9. I have stayed in so many hotels, and this is the first time I have encountered a cleaning lady who is so diligent in cleaning. Afterwards, a staff member called me to ask about the stay experience and areas that need improvement. It is indeed the seventh hotel. A star hotel, this service level and management ability must be greatly praised👍👍👍.

I had a perfect vacation at Atlantis with unparalleled service and facilities.
First of all, the hotel's design is full of modernity and luxury, and each room is equipped with exquisite decoration and comfortable large beds. In addition to hardware facilities, software services are also top-notch. There is an exclusive one-on-one butler service. My butler Davis is warm and considerate. He will contact you in advance, provide warm reminders, answer all your questions, and respond to all your requests. He can always solve any problems for you in time. We will help you with your luggage during check-in and check-out, and give you small gifts when you leave the hotel, making you happy and surprised. The dining experience is also unparalleled. The restaurants in the hotel serve different styles of dishes. The breakfast has a wide variety to meet the needs of different tastes. The pizza and fried chicken ordered by the pool are also delicious. Shopping is also very convenient. The price of Jiaoxia sun protection clothing is affordable. You can order takeout and it will be delivered to the designated express cabinet to avoid inconvenience when traveling.
The aquarium and water world brought us many surprising moments, and the whole family was full of praise. We will choose Atlantis and our lovely butler Davis again if we have the opportunity in the future.

Come back and rest when you are tired, and then watch a water curtain show in the evening~
The hotel's own swimming pool is also very large, so even if the occupancy rate is high, it will not be crowded and there will be a foam party in the afternoon.
Needless to say, the hotel's hardware facilities are of course, but what's even more satisfying is the service! Every staff member I met smiled warmly! In particular, the housekeeper Jiali contacted us as soon as we checked in to learn about our hotel preferences in a timely manner. She added WeChat to carefully introduce the hotel's facilities, entertainment projects and catering, and responded to service requests in a timely manner.

In the hotel, other waiters are also very responsible. As long as you need it, they will follow up until your problem is solved. After checking out, I found that my baby's spoon was missing, and the housekeeper helped to find it. Thumbs up.
Facilities: The facilities in the guest room are complete, there are no shortcomings, and the children are very safe.
Looking forward to meeting you next time.

It was very reassuring to bring my children to play. The gym is also very good, and the aquarium water world is very convenient! Especially for little ones, there is a great amusement park with a lot of toys. You can lie down and let the children play as much as they want ~

In particular, the handsome guy Wang Qin is serious, dedicated, affable and helpful. He took the initiative to help us pick up our luggage, and after delivering it to the room, he introduced the use of the facilities and the surrounding landscape in detail... The hotel butler Davis was even more serious and meticulous, and every detail of the service was meticulous and refined, making us feel at home. Such as the schedule of various activities, candies and gifts for the children, proactive late check-out, etc... It's great!
Secondly, the hotel is clean and hygienic, with all the toiletries, mineral water, drinks, capsules and coffee available...The breakfast is rich and delicious!
Third, the location of the hotel is very good! It is very close to the duty-free shop, with everything to eat, drink and have fun, and has a panoramic view of Haitang Bay! Especially hotel guests can enter the water world in advance, which is super convenient!
     The overall feeling is that the service is very good! Great experience! Five-star praise! Beautiful scenery! Great food! Great value for money! Super satisfied! I will stay here again next time I come and will recommend it to my friends.

msg:I booked a hotel to play in the water world. There were many people in the lobby, but check-in was surprisingly convenient and fast. There was no deposit, and there was no extra charge for breakfast and entertainment for the children. It was very user-friendly. The breakfast restaurant is large, the dishes are complete, and the taste is great! The waves in Haitang Bay are relatively large, so it is not recommended to go into the sea. It is also fun to walk on the beach. There are many swimming pools in the hotel and there are few people. After all, they are all here for the water world.
The amusement park is bustling with people and has many entertainment items. The average queue time is 20-60 minutes. Although I hate queuing, it is still tolerable. The water curtain light show at night is average, and the drone show is okay. The ticket price for Show C is on the higher side because I have seen many similar performances and they are not particularly outstanding.
The butler Clara's service is very attentive, which is very suitable for a social lazy person like me. When I left, I put away my things and took my children to visit the aquarium. The butler helped me store my luggage when I checked out, and also gave my children a small whale toy to play with. Very happy.

The overall experience is very good. The front desk, catering, guest rooms, clean and beautiful environment, and considerate service are all almost impeccable. Especially the butler Xiaobai, I would like to express my special thanks. The child did not dare to experience diving because of fear. For items that were originally non-refundable, the butler took the trouble to handle a refund and gave the child many small gifts. Next time you come to Sanya, Atlantis is definitely your choice. There are also many projects that I don’t have time to experience. The child said that he must play enough next time. Like Atlantis👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Three days and two nights flew by in a jiffy, because there are so many things to do here. The aquarium not only has many colorful creatures, but also a beluga whale show and a mermaid show. It’s so beautiful! Water World is a children's water park where you can play all day without wanting to come out! C show performance, unique! What attracts us most here is the interaction with beluga whales, dolphins and sea lions. These animals are so smart and cute that you can take photos, interact and pet them up close for a fee! Yate's service is first-rate. A dedicated butler will contact you before you arrive at the hotel. This time, our butler Clara provided great service and deserves special praise! We should still be able to brush Art three, four, five, six!

msg:I was amazed when I came here for the first time. Because I wanted to visit Water World and the Aquarium, it was the most convenient place to stay here. I saw some bad reviews about the Atlantis Hotel in advance. I was so excited that I decided to give it a try and stayed here for two. In the evening, after checking in, those negative reviews were simply nonsense. Otherwise, I would have stayed here directly when I came to Sanya, which made me run around for half a month. First of all, the price is absolutely excellent value for money. It is not just a five-star hotel, it is not special at all. As mentioned in the negative reviews, the service starts from the moment you get off the car. After you get your luggage from the car, you will be helped to deliver it to the room. Everything in the room is completely free of charge. It has complete facilities and first-class hygiene. It is completely clean and tidy. It is so clean. I love cleanliness. I am a very careful person who has stayed in many hotels. I was so shocked here. The room was so big that I couldn’t find any cleanliness corners. From the details, the bedding was completely new. I also paid attention to all the cleaning staff in the hotel, even the lobby cleaning staff. The staff are using a full set of Dyson vacuums and mops. How could it be unclean? The bathroom slippers except the guest room slippers are all new and disposable toilet mats and bathrobes. We have a double bed room, but the disposable equipment is for a family of three. It is equipped with shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, salt bath, toothbrush, toothpaste, body lotion, disposable toilet water, etc. All of them are not cheap products and are very high-end. There is also a set of children's products including children's moisturizer. The rooms are also very quiet and soundproofed. The great water world closes at ten o'clock. There is no noise at all. I stayed for two days and two nights and no mosquitoes or other bugs were found. The bathtub and hardware accessories are very clean and no water stains can be seen at all. There is no unclean place at all. Landis has been replacing it with new ones. There is nothing that looks old at all. One detail can be seen. The glass glue in the whole house is newly installed. The lights are also centrally controlled. The hair dryer is Dyson. The air is fresh, let alone damp. The balcony door is closed and the air conditioner is closed. It automatically turns on the constant temperature. How can it be so trendy? Besides, the service staff are on-site to help you put away your slippers and clothes, tidy up the floor towels, and have anti-slip mats. Especially our beautiful housekeeper Jenny Wu, who takes the initiative to contact you if you have any questions. If needed, she will come to help you immediately to help you with all the food, drinks and entertainment. She will make reservations for you and tell you in advance what activities there are. Just like the fireworks show, which does not happen every day. Fortunately, Jenny Wu has Jenny Wu. She tells me the time, place and how to get to the event, otherwise we would miss it at all. That's a pity. The housekeeper will take the initiative to contact you about what you need in the room. Does it need to be cleaned? In short, if you don't understand anything, she can help solve it. Thank you so much to the housekeeper. She also gave us many small dolphin dolls. The children really like aquariums. If you want to go to Guan Water World, you can stay in the hotel. Many of them are free. The breakfast buffet is not too expensive. The dishes are fresh and really exquisite. One detail. I had breakfast for two days and found that the simplest boiled eggs are all fresh. The eggs are freshly boiled because you can peel them. The airport bus staff will help you put your luggage in the car. When you get to the airport, the staff will help you take it out. We arrived at the airport in 40 minutes without traffic jams that day. There are so many satisfying things. I can’t say enough about it. From the moment you step into Atlantis, you will always feel happy. Every hotel staff and our butler will make you happy all the time. I think it is perfect and great. It is a place for adults to relax. A paradise for children's happiness. When I step into Sanya again, I will not consider other hotels and book here directly. Overall, it is simply great. I don't want to leave at all when my vacation is here. I really recommend that everyone must go there in person to know what a real vacation is. Overall the place is great
Facilities: Fully automatic, complete refrigerator and coffee
Hygiene: Hygiene is really not to mention how clean it is. It’s so clean that I’m embarrassed to throw things away. Atlantis is really amazing in terms of hygiene. It’s just like my own home.
Environment: Comfortable
Service: First-class service, better than domestic five-star service. The housekeeper is enthusiastic and caring.

In this case, they also upgraded to an ocean view. The suite is so thoughtful. When you come to Atlantis, in addition to accommodation, you will definitely go to the Water World and the aquarium. The detailed schedule and guide have been sent to you at the time of check-in! By the way, guests staying at Water World and Aquarium can enter and exit for free countless times, so worth it! What’s more surprising is that the housekeeper specially arranged a small gift to secretly hang on the door. It’s so cute! There is nothing to say about the hotel's hardware facilities. The service can be ranked in the top 3 of several five-star hotels I have stayed in in Sanya!

Why are the hardware facilities so good? , but the service can’t keep up? ? When I contacted him about something, he didn't reply for a long time. Then when I entered, it felt chaotic. There were people everywhere. Then, people checking out, checking in, and people from outside visiting the water world were in a mess. I couldn't find my luggage. Hauling people. I'm completely confused. It's not as good as the hotel services at Yalong Bay MGM, Sheraton and other hotels not far away, let alone other hotels. One thing that needs special mention is the upgraded room type mentioned by "Housekeeper Anna", but it's not Are the benefits included in the housing type? ? ? Does this mean that if I live here, I can’t use anything that is different from the room I originally booked? ? ? I want to say that I am very satisfied with the room type I ordered. Do you have to make reasonable arrangements for upgrading? Or do you upgrade your customers to a room type that is not selling well because of oversold rooms? ? There is no reason why there are too many people in the room type and the service rights cannot be upgraded at the same time, because since it is empty, there must be room for your service staff. Otherwise, the boss who employs so many people just sits in front of the computer and plays with his mobile phone to communicate with customers? No hotel has ever encountered such a statement: Upgrading to a room type does not enjoy benefits. Why didn't it be mentioned when checking in? You said I can choose not to, as long as I choose the room type myself, make it look like I got a huge discount, and then feel that I owe you a favor, and then make it so that I can't make the demands I should have! ! It was the first time I encountered such kind of butler service after staying in a hotel for so many years. I never saw a real person, but when I left, I started asking for good reviews of the service. If you do a good job, I will give it to you, but if you don’t do a good job, I can’t give you a good review! The price of one night in your hotel, what about the price abroad, your service is so bad, your attitude is so bad, this is the first time I give a bad review to a service staff! I originally wanted to stay for a few more nights, but it really affected my mood. I came out just to have fun, but a hotel service staff stood at the commanding heights and made you feel that it was really unnecessary to spend money to buy bad emotions. Anyway, if you don’t change your service attitude and quality, your surrounding friends will also give you bad reviews! I hope the hotel housekeeper service depar**ent and floor supervisors will reflect on it themselves!
We have something to say about Ctrip. Every time we book a hotel or air ticket through him, his service is very good, he helps us deal with it in a timely manner, and the solution is very good. Even if there is no good solution at the time, the speed of the later service to solve the problem is also so excellent. , the important thing is that his attitude is so good, and he also introduces it to his friends around him!

Before checking in, the butler Jackson contacted us in advance and added some itinerary recommendations. He also recommended that we go to Water World to watch the light show, and we would get a free trip. For dinner, there is a breakfast buffet every day. Finally, I received a pair of lovely souvenirs. The service was really good. I will come again next time!

msg:The service at Atlantis Hotel is really good, and my housekeeper Anna was even more considerate.
Enjoy the minibar, a cute little white whale for the kids, and very good quality welcome fruit. The sea view from the balcony is beautiful. You can really spend two or three days in the aquarium and water world.

Atlantis Water World is super worth checking out. There are 9 projects in total, and everyone above 122cm can play.
The first recommendation is the super loudspeaker (four people per kayak, exciting but completely bearable)
Shark crossing (the shark tunnel is perfect for taking pictures with a waterproof cover and mobile phone)
Don’t miss these two projects.
The experience of small speakers and roller coasters is relatively dull.
I really didn’t dare to play Neptune’s Leap and Let It Go, all I heard was howling.

The aquarium has two floors. The ultra-high large glass is very photogenic and visually stunning. The souvenir shop dolls are so cute

This time I was traveling with my baby. We stayed on the 36th floor and had dedicated butler service. Special thanks to our butler Jia Li, who basically responded to our requests and sent us a series of travel guides and precautions from the moment we checked in. Wait, we also gave our babies little dolphins🐬. The children were very happy!
Because there was some delay in taking care of the children, our check-out was delayed to 1:30 the next day🕜very considerate❤️

Service: Very good. After checking in, the housekeeper Xiaoyan called and added WeChat. She kept introducing the hotel's environment and the time for various activities. Xiaoyan was very thoughtful, answering all questions and requests, and even gave the baby a gift. All the service staff are very polite to the little dolphin doll and will say hello when meeting them.
Unlimited access to Water World Aquarium for 2 adults and 2 children: It’s great, but it’s a pity that the weather in January is still a bit cold in the morning and evening, so I can’t enjoy it to the fullest. I plan to bring my kids here again during the summer vacation, so I can enjoy it as much as possible
In addition, the two dolls in the last photo were caught from the claw machine in Water World. They cost 50 yuan and 16 coins. They were caught 8 times. I caught two of them. At first, I was quite resistant to the dolls trying to catch them. With this money, I might as well just buy one, but I was forced by the baby to catch one. I didn’t expect to catch two of them, and I didn’t expect to see the same model in a toy store. The price was 128 each. I instantly felt that the baby was for me. Save money, hahaha, it’s easy to catch, you can try it

Sometimes the reservation application could not be made and there was no timely text message to explain. **'s service attitude is very good, they communicated in a timely manner and gave me coupons, but the Yate merchants couldn't get through on the phone.
My child wanted to play in the water world, so I booked an executive ambassador suite for two nights. Special note, I booked the Poly Rosewood and Grand Hyatt hotels for this trip. The room stewards called and WeChat one day in advance, and the service was attentive and meticulous. Only the housekeeper from Atlantis only added WeChat on the same day. He had no phone number and only had a lot of official polite words, but could not talk about any service! I only got a plate of fruit on the day I checked in, but nothing the next day. I really don’t understand. Who set the price of Yate’s hotel at more than 5,000 per night for an executive suite? ? What kind of benefits should you enjoy? ? As for lunch and dinner, you have to queue up on the 48th floor. The dining environment is a bit like a canteen, and the dishes are not rich at all. On the last day, when I was leaving the hotel, the hotel housekeeper was even more funny. He didn't ask if he needed help taking the luggage to the lobby. There was no message at all. I had to ask the front desk to call the hotel for someone to pick up the luggage! I spent more than 10,000 yuan to stay in this hotel for two nights! Virtue is not worthy! No service, really disgusting

It turns out that the two are not the same project. The science popularization interaction is just to watch the beluga whale show. As long as you stay here, you can enter and exit the aquarium and water world free of charge, right? ? Of course you can watch the performance, why do you need to mention it as a gift? This pie is painted! Beluga Interactive is a single-charge project. If you try it out, you can even download the photos. Let’s pay 3600 to the three of us! Although it is expensive, I think it is worth it for my children! There are various other items that need to be charged separately, which makes me speechless😓But the only thing that makes me feel a little warm is my personal butler Emma, ​​who enthusiastically gave me fruits and dolls, and kept reminding me What activities are there! Thank you so much Emma! Moms who want to take mermaid photos should buy their outfits in advance. My daughter bought this outfit for 360 in the Atlantis store! I honestly just took a photo and haven’t worn it again!

msg:The first stop of our honeymoon trip in Sanya was at the Atlantis Hotel. I read a lot of reviews before going there, some good and some bad. After experiencing it for three days and two nights, it is a wise choice. The hotel room rate includes the water world and aquarium. Free unlimited entry and exit during the stay, which is super cool. After checking in, the hotel arranged a WeChat butler Clara. If you have any questions about the hotel, meal times, aquarium show times, etc., just ask and the butler will reply in time. The most considerate thing is that I felt unwell after playing in the water world that day. I wanted to drink brown sugar ginger water, and they arranged it in time to send it to the room. It was great! I have already planned to stay at the Atlantis Hotel when the weather is hotter, especially when the water temperature is high, and enjoy the water world. There is a beach next to the hotel, there are few people and it is quiet. The sand is fine and the water is very clear. The hotel has two restaurants for breakfast. The dishes are very rich, but there are a lot of people during peak dining times. During your stay, drinks in the minibar are free. The mineral water is from Changbai Mountain, and 9 bottles are prepared every day. When leaving the store, I was given two cute dolphin 🐬 dolls as gifts. All in all, the hotel feels very professional and attentive, highly recommended.

The aquarium is very small and ended in 20 minutes (there were more people staying in the hotel than staying in the hotel). The hotel was not crowded. Compared with shopping malls, there is nothing attractive outside. It feels like it just has an extra sea view than any inland outdoor water play area, and the sea view rooms are not as good as any hotel in Yalong Bay. The kids went to bed early, and there were so many people queuing up for breakfast. I hurriedly checked out after breakfast, which felt like a bit of a bad value for money.

The facilities in the room are also very complete. The comfortable big bed, spacious bathroom, modern furniture and equipment, etc. are all very satisfying.

There are all kinds of water slides, water slides, wave pools and other facilities, allowing our family to swim in the water with constant laughter. The aquarium allows us to come into close contact with various rare marine creatures, which is amazing.
The service of the hotel is the focus of our praise. Every employee serves us with enthusiasm, professionalism and caring attitude, making us feel at home. Special mention is made of our butler Jackson, who is very considerate and can solve our needs as soon as possible, making us feel very at ease.

Especially the seafood food, fresh and delicious, makes people have endless aftertaste.
Overall, we are very satisfied with the services, facilities, catering and other aspects of Atlantis Hotel. It is a very unforgettable vacation experience. Thank you Atlantis for the wonderful time!

The water park looked very good, but it's a pity that I couldn't go into the water because I had a cold. Jackson, the caring butler I also got a beluga whale doll, I love it so much❤️

In addition to the good hardware, this kind of hotel also has very good services. Especially the butler service. Although I didn’t meet Butler Xiaolin, the service was very enthusiastic. He explained the play equipment, gave small gifts to the children🎁, and answered questions. Thank you for the trip to Atlantis Hotel, thanks to Butler Xiaolin.

msg:I haven’t been to Sanya for a long time. When I landed, I chose Atlantis. I booked a deluxe sea view room and upgraded it to a suite. I would like to thank the butler Davis for the upgraded suite room type.
Hygiene: Five-star hotel standards, clean, hygienic, generous and decent.
Facilities: Because it is a suite, the two of us are staying in it. There are two toilets and three wash basins in total. It will be very convenient, especially the two bathrooms. The Dyson, Samsung TV, BOSE speakers, and bathroom products that come standard in five-star hotels are relatively comfortable and easy to use, and moisturizer can replace hand cream in winter. The bedding is still five-star and useful. There are two things that particularly impressed me in terms of facilities: 1. There are more than ten bottles of mineral water in the room, which are everywhere. I like it. The minibar drinks and tea bags are also good; 2. The room is willing to use floor towels. Whether on both sides of the bed or in the bathroom, the floor towels are laid out in advance and slippers are placed in front of the bed. The service experience is good.
Environment: It is close to the seaside. Sanya resort hotels have standard swimming pools, green plants, etc., and the environment is okay.
Service: Davis, the butler, is conscientious and responsible, and he has already felt the advanced service awareness of high-end hotels in Sanya, which is ahead of ordinary inland cities.

Others: The hotel price includes tickets to Water World and Aquarium. Just swipe your face to enter. Overall, it is more suitable for parents and children. There are many projects for children, as well as travel photography. We were adults, so we actually had no experience with the water world and travel photography. The check-out experience was good. The housekeeper reminded me that you can check out directly by putting your room card in the room. There is no need to check the room before checking out, which avoids the check-out peak waiting time at the front desk.

Finally, thank you again to the butler for upgrading to a suite. I wish all my friends good luck in the Year of the Dragon!

msg:I have stayed in quite a few high-end hotels and B&Bs. By comparison,
It is no exaggeration to say that the quality of all aspects of Atlantis Sanya is the best high-end luxury resort hotel I have ever stayed in.
The stay experience is so comfortable. I love it so much😍
I stayed for two nights and visited the Atlantis water park and aquarium with unlimited access. It was a great time.
If you only stay for one day, you won’t have enough time to play. I personally recommend staying for two nights to make a base.
What is the specific method? Let me evaluate it in detail.
.
🍀Environment:
Whether it's outdoors or in the room, the environment is great.
Our room faced the water park and the sea
The terrace is very large and spacious, with a 360-degree sea view and a magnificent view overlooking the water park. Whether it is day or night, the scenery is so beautiful that it is speechless.
The sunshine during the day is very poisonous. Every day when I open my eyes, I see the blue sky, white clouds and the endless sea. It is really happy and healing to the soul.
Who can not love such an environment?
.
💁♀️Service:
The most commendable thing is the service. It is comprehensive and every detail of the service is well done. The service quality is the best among the hotels I have ever stayed in.
Especially our butler's service attitude is really excellent
As soon as I checked in at the front desk, the housekeeper took the initiative to add vx
When we got to the room, he patiently introduced the room facilities and other thoughtful tips. He smiled the whole time and his tone was particularly humble and polite.
And he is particularly proactive in sending various reminders during vx communication.
At the same time, we were given a free upgrade to our room type and a late check-out was also achieved.
Deliver fruits every day and take the initiative to ask if you need more drinks in the mini refrigerator.
When we leave the hotel, we can leave our room card in the room without having to go to the front desk to save time.
If you have any needs, please reply to us promptly. The service response is fast and efficient. Compared with many other high-end hotels I have stayed in, Atlantis is better and more meticulous in many details. The service is very satisfying👍
.
🛀🏻Hygiene:
In particular, I would like to mention that the aunties who clean the room every day are a big highlight. They will take the initiative to help us tidy up the miscellaneous things in the stall.
Even the charging cable was rolled up for us. The room was extremely clean once we returned.
This is something no other hotel has done. It’s really thoughtful.
The room was spotless, the hygiene was very good, and it was so comfortable
.
🚿Room facilities:
It has everything a high-end hotel should have and the facilities are very user-friendly.
The room is very big, with two sinks and other huge spaces. It’s a pleasure to use.
It is convenient to switch between various lighting modes with one click
The only thing is that the shower water could be more powerful. If the bath water volume were larger, it would be perfect. The facilities are all high-end and there is nothing wrong with it.
.
☀️Breakfast:
Buffet style in G floor restaurant
The time is from 7 am to 2 pm. It’s so user-friendly.
It’s very friendly to people who like to sleep in. We were full after lunch every day. The dishes are so rich. There are even steaks and barbecues. It’s a high-end one.
To my surprise, the overall taste was delicious. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the best breakfast buffet.
Especially the wonton noodles, they are so fragrant and delicious that I have to have a bowl every day.
After we finished eating, we took away some fruit yogurt and eggs, which are also allowed.
Very friendly and user-friendly buffet breakfast, real name praise👍
.
⛱️Features:
1⃣️Must brag about ordering meals in the guest room. It’s huge and delicious.
The ordering menu is displayed directly on the TV. Ordering is very convenient.
My mom ordered a bowl of wontons and I ordered Hainanese chicken rice.
The first bite I took made me feel like a god. It was so delicious that I wanted to cry😭
The wontons are big, the chicken is tender and fresh, the rice is fragrant and tasty, both salty and light.
There are no words to describe the divine deliciousness at that time. The chicken soup was so delicious that it had no friends.
Anyway, I didn’t expect it to be so delicious.
Although the prices of the dishes are a little expensive, they are worth it. The food delivery service is also very good.
2⃣️Water World Aquarium
The two largest tourist attractions
The G floor of the hotel is directly accessible and very convenient.
Guests have unlimited access and have a great time, especially suitable for family travel
3⃣️The views are so good, especially the terrace in the room, which is perfect for taking photos and making various films.
The room rate is 2000💰➕ per night. Compared with the high quality in all aspects, it is still worth it. It is a super resort hotel suitable for family travel. Highly recommended ❤️

1⃣️ Service: I felt the warm service from the moment I entered the door. The guy at the door helped to carry the luggage throughout the whole process. Even when I left the hotel on the last day, he enthusiastically helped to carry the luggage. After check-in, the hotel butler will add you to WeChat and inform you about special events in the hotel and breakfast time. I would like to thank the butler JACKSON for his warm service. He also gave me two small dolls, which my baby loved very much.

2⃣️ Environment & Hygiene: Needless to say, the hotel’s hygiene is super clean, and you can’t even pick out any bones from the eggs. During my stay at the hotel, my baby had gastrointestinal discomfort and vomited in the middle of the night, and the housekeeping staff came immediately to clean everything up. The room is cleaned twice a day, the garbage is cleared out in time, the bed is made, and any stains are replaced with new ones.

3⃣️ Entertainment facilities: For family hotels, Atlantis has a great advantage, with unlimited access to the aquarium and water world every day. The hotel also has a small children's playground, child care services and other parent-child activities. Some of them cannot be participated because the baby is too young. You can arrange them all next time when the baby is older.

If you want to save effort in raising a baby, choose Atlantis~

Go to the aquarium, pick up a few blind boxes at Bubble Mart, go back to the room to pack your luggage, and continue to play in Water World. When you have enough fun, you can just leave. It is very convenient. Water World repeat members have free lockers. There are free bath towels at the hotel. The buffet breakfast saffron has Hou'an powder and dregs vinegar, which is delicious.

I had heard that the rooms here were not very good, so I didn’t have any hope of coming here this time. After all, it was just for my children to play in the water world, but the room also gave me a big boost. Surprise, children's bathrobes, slippers, body soap, toothpaste, everything is available. The colors of the TV cabinet in the room and the various soft furnishings on the floor are in line with the tranquility and calmness you want to achieve during vacation. At the same time, the material is high-end and elegant. The breakfast is fresh and rich in variety. The main thing is that it is fresh at first glance and makes you happy when you look at it. Water World is also one of the few cleanest places in China. We have been here three times. Staying in a hotel and playing in Water World is the most relaxing and comfortable. No problem, it’s worth the money!

msg:Let’s talk about the room first. The room is fully equipped with a total of 8 drinks, including 8 bottles of mineral water per day. Because the drinks for extended stays are replenished and not all restocked, you can take out the machine carefully and put it on the countertop and they will fill it up. On the day of check-in, I felt the excellence of the seven-star hotel. First of all, the beautiful butler Xiaoxin greeted me with check-in greetings and warm reminders: from breakfast to the use of the Water World Aquarium, the items included in the package, and the best viewing seats. In addition, the top room in the room purchase package has a good sea view and is very cost-effective. In the evening, we experienced the C-show performance. First of all, the effect was very shocking. The children were very happy to see it and said that it was really awesome. It was indeed a 5-meter or higher diving, synchronized swimming in the water, and various storylines. A few children didn’t understand, so I hope there will be more explanations later; it’s better to avoid the 9.30 rush hour for breakfast because there are too many people and it’s hard to find the location; in the Water World Project Aquarium, those aged 6 and under may be more suitable for the aquarium. It’s not particularly informative. It’s perfect for taking pictures and checking in. There aren’t many games under Water World 1.22 that can be played without commenting. The above comments are my true feelings. Plagiarism is shameful. I hope it can be helpful to those who haven’t come here yet.

msg:The room is very spacious and full of details. You will know it after experiencing it. The children in the water park love it very much and say it is more fun than Disneyland. All the exciting items are repeated repeatedly. It is really worth it. Finally, I really want to praise the room. The housekeeper brought fresh fruits, and also prepared gifts such as refrigerator magnets and a beluga whale. When the children came back from the water world and saw the gifts hanging at the door, I said they were given by Santa Claus (it happened to be Chris**as that day) and I was so excited. I said they had lived there. This is my favorite hotel. Thank you very much, Beibei Butler~

msg:It’s so worth coming and experiencing. I originally saw negative reviews saying that it was a mess, and children often commented like this. I didn't dare to book more. I only booked for one night and regretted it. I really should have stayed in Aklantis for a few more nights. From getting off the bus to leaving the store, staff are everywhere to provide full service. Sometimes you just need a look and someone will ask you what help you need. The hotel's service is all about details. The butler assigned to us is Xiao Hao. The service is superb. He will proactively remind you not to miss the show and will solve problems immediately if you encounter them. The breakfast butler will remind you when the peak time is. We avoided eating there. There are not many varieties, but the taste is very good. You can basically play Water World for two days, and it’s fun to have no queues.

When you check in, you can also swipe your face unlimited times to enter the water world. The aquarium and water world's drone water curtain show at night are all Chris**as special editions, which are super beautiful. Of course, we also received Chris**as fruits and souvenirs from Santa Claus. The room service is particularly meticulous, including every bottle of cosmetics. They are all neatly placed on the cloth, and the slippers are also neatly placed on the cloth. In addition, the room service will also provide small candies from Atlantis, which is a sign♥️The buffet breakfast opening hours are very It’s long, so you don’t have to worry about getting up late and running out of food, and the variety is also very complete. The most important thing is that the service of all the brothers and sisters in Atlantis is very good and almost always respond to my requests. Especially my housekeeper, Miss Maggie, I like her very much! Sanya is so beautiful! Come next time!

msg:I have heard about Atlantis Hotel for a long time but have never had the chance to experience it. I booked a hotel during my honeymoon and wanted to experience the first-tier hotel in Sanya. I was familiar with the Atlantis review guide before departure, but ended up having an unforgettable trip to Atlantis that was beyond my imagination.

We chose Atlantis for our honeymoon trip without hesitation. We were informed in advance that Atlantis would arrive at the hotel earlier. When we arrived at the hotel before 12 o'clock in the morning, the front desk already informed us that the room was ready for honeymoon decoration, which was very considerate. . The room is arranged on the 33rd floor of the hotel room. The room can view the sea and the Atlantis Paradise. The hotel butler Xiaoyun ⛅️ brought him into the room and introduced every corner of the room very carefully. It was very good and a great compliment to the hotel Xiaoyun Xiao. My sister liked it 👍 and also gave us a fruit plate. After arriving at the hotel, we went to Happy World Beach to play in the afternoon, and our knees were bruised. Thank you to Miss Xiaoyun of the hotel for sending the staff to bring band-aids and iodine. It was very warm. , we are very happy with this honeymoon experience🥳, thank you to the hotel staff for the warm reception, thank you all👏👏

msg:I bought Atlantis when I came to Sanya a few years ago, so I decided to be extravagant this time! !
Service: I have to say that the service of a hotel at this price is really unsatisfactory. From the moment we got off the bus at the door, there was a receptionist to help deliver the luggage to the room. There was also a room steward Qiqi who followed us throughout the process. If we had any questions or needs Whatever we asked her on WeChat, she responded in a timely manner. In the afternoon, she also delivered fruit to the room and gave us a small doll to take home for our furry child to play with😁
Facilities: I read some reviews online that the hotel is old, but we didn’t notice it when we stayed here. The cleaning was also very clean, and the toiletries were all AHAVA’s Dead Sea series (smuggled away...)
I won’t go into detail about the aquarium and water world. It’s a bit expensive to buy a separate ticket for 200, but it’s great to be able to check in with your face at any time while staying in the hotel! ! ! The breakfast buffet was until 11 noon, so we had a delicious brunch in the morning and then went to the aquarium to eat and take a walk, and watched a mermaid show by the way❤️

msg:The idea of ​​staying in Atlantis for one night when coming to Sanya, but the real feeling of staying there: It’s not worth it.
The weather in Sanya suddenly cooled down, and it was almost impossible to play in the water world. It was too cold, and the water temperature was about 20 degrees. The loudspeaker and roller coaster projects were closed on the day I went. The projects were similar to the water worlds in other cities. The aquarium is quite small and can be visited quickly. The only heated swimming pool is shallow and not very hot.
Check-in experience: I checked in after ten o'clock on a non-working day, but the housekeeper didn't add me on WeChat at that time, and didn't contact me until five or six o'clock in the afternoon. I had almost finished shopping. To be honest, the travel guide book provided by the hotel was basically charged. According to the project introduction, more than 2,000 yuan is just the admission ticket. If you want to live well, you have to spend money.
Advantages: The hygiene is very good, the disposable supplies are also very good, and the housekeeper Qiqi later gave me some fruits.
Disadvantages: The TV is quite small. You can’t play Water World and there’s basically nothing else to do. Just lie down and spend more than 2,000 to find a place to sleep.

I called you in the middle of the night to change. The aunt who covered the sheets and quilts was really nice. She asked us what we wanted and helped us get it. The housekeeper Clara Qiqi also answered all questions and gave us two children's dolls because the children were too young. One is one and a half years old and the other is 3 years old. They can play in the water world. I will come to Yate next time. I am really satisfied with the trip. It was a perfect ending for me and my baby!

msg:Emily, who was eleven months old, chose Atlantis for her first long-distance trip. That's great! Emily had a great time. Atlantis is very suitable for bringing children, especially babies. The environment, facilities and sanitary conditions are all great. The milk warmer sterilizer provided is from Philips. There are baby baths and more. The hotel staff called to communicate before check-in. There is a dedicated butler for full service. Special thanks go to our housekeeper Amy, who is very warm and considerate. As long as there is a need, it will be solved immediately. Emily's shoes were left on the shuttle bus to the duty-free city. Amy immediately contacted the driver, found the shoes and sent them back to our room. The little whale that Amy gave to little Emily is super cute. Amy specially came to the room to visit little Emily. Thank you again Amy!
No deposit is required for check-in at Atlantis, and check-out is very quick. Room supplies and sanitation were provided in a timely manner.
The shortcomings are that the hotel is too big, crowded and lively.
Little Emily will definitely come again. Next time she can interact with the beluga whale. Next time she hopes to see Aunt Amy.

msg:🌟Environment: The first time I stayed at the Atlantis Hotel, I was really surprised. The hotel is very big, the environment is very good, and of course it is very popular. 😊
1️⃣Arrived at around 2pm, check-in was very quick and convenient. Maggie, the hotel housekeeper, took us into the room and introduced the hotel and guest room facilities in detail. The bellman then helped us push our luggage to the room. At the same time, I folded a towel in the shape of a cake to wish the little baby a happy birthday. ❤️.
2️⃣Open the doors and windows and face the sea. The mood is particularly beautiful. The room minibar has a wide variety of drinks and welcome fruits.
3️⃣

Unlimited access to Water World Aquarium: This is a key review. I highly recommend staying at the Atlantis Hotel when traveling with kids! Because it is very convenient to go to the aquarium water world, and it is unlimited! ! I read reviews before saying that you can see the aquarium for free in the lobby, which is indeed good. But what you pay for in the ticket is the classic one. My friends, the mermaid🧜♀️show kids really like it😍, we watched it 4-5 times! Went to see it again the next day.
There is also a water curtain movie and fireworks show at Water World at night🎆, it’s really beautiful~
4️⃣The hotel’s family pool bubble party, as well as various internet celebrity pools. The water quality is announced every day, there are professional lifeguards on site, and a towel is provided for hotel guests every day. These details are very satisfactory and done very well. The baby 👧🏻 also had a great time.
5️⃣The hotel service definitely needs thumbs up! ! ❤️
I met little brother Ou Zheming in the breakfast room. He took the initiative to care about whether we were satisfied with the taste of breakfast and even gave our baby a dolphin 🐬 lollipop. A good day starts with breakfast. 😝

🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟The most important thing to thank is our housekeeper Maggie, who is very considerate, patient, serious and careful. From the moment I checked in, I was sent a schedule of various hotel activities and answered all my questions. It’s my baby’s birthday, and arrangements are made to send cakes and small gifts🎁. It was really a surprise~ He took the initiative to send us messages of concern and greetings the next day. Many detailed services made us worry-free and happy. Our first trip to Sanya with a baby🏝️ was full of very good memories~❣️We will come again next time I will look for her again~ I love her❤️

😍The hotel is too big, so I took my kids to play all the time, such as the lawn and the beach🏖️, and I didn’t even have time to take a walk, and I didn’t even take the photos given. But it’s good to have some regrets. I’ll continue to unlock it next time and look forward to coming again next winter~✈️

It was still early after all the fun, so I went to a crab restaurant for lunch. I have eaten at this restaurant three or four times. The taste of its curry crab cannot be replicated anywhere else. Simply delicious. After the meal, I received a contact from Terry, the Atlantis housekeeper. The hotel upgraded me to a sea view suite, a one-bedroom and one-living room. Terry provided me with attentive service and also gave our children four small whale dolls. This stay at Atlantis left me with so many wonderful memories. I will choose Atlantis Hotel next time

After staying for three nights and four days, I felt that the staff in all depar**ents of the hotel were courteous and well-trained. The rooms were proactively cleaned every day, and the drinks were replenished. The restaurants had corresponding delicacies 24 hours a day, so there was no need to worry! The butler, Mr. Hao, provided attentive service and arranged all the food, drinks and entertainment during the four-day trip. The service was great! The water world, aquarium, 4D movie, water curtain show, C show, and fireworks show are all exciting and unforgettable! Special thanks to this guy!
Let me talk about the C show in particular. It is a culmination of lighting, music, underwater dance, and acrobatic skills. It is breathtaking and well worth the experience!
In short, leave the perfect vacation to Atlantis Hotel, relax and enjoy life to the fullest!

Even if I am tired from shopping and playing, I can go back to the hotel to rest immediately. The housekeeper Xiaoxin was attentive and enthusiastic. She was able to help us solve all the problems we encountered in a timely manner. Thumbs up for this beauty. The club room type is very worry-free and you don’t have to worry about food problems. You can have tea and snacks 24 hours a day. Finally, I watched the C show. The actors are very skilled and the stage is majestic. I recommend it to friends who are parents of children and will go there to see it. There is a different feeling.

Although the hotel is expensive, it is worth the money!
From the 41st floor, you can have an unobstructed view of half of Haitang Bay, which can be called a three-dimensional living map of the park.
It was a newly opened hotel in 2018. The decoration and facilities are still very new. The room is not too small. There is capsule coffee and a mini water bar. In the afternoon, they also sent clean fruits and two cute little beluga whales as souvenirs. , the children were very happy.
The housekeeper, Comrade Yuan, was very attentive and thoughtful in answering any questions, and also sent travel guides, which was very considerate.
The breakfast was very rich and there was so much food that it was hard to choose. Hainanese noodles are super delicious.
Except for the inconvenience of not having lounge chairs on the balcony, everything was perfect.
There are many activities in Water World that my sister can’t do because of her height. When she grows taller in two years, she will definitely come again!

After arriving at the hotel, the warm greetings from the concierge at the door, the friendly smile at the hotel front desk, and the attentive and warm service from the butler Xiao Ruan after check-in immediately eliminated the strangeness and fatigue of coming to a new city. We feel that choosing to stay at Atlantis is a great value! I would like to express my special thanks to the beautiful housekeeper Xiao Ruan for helping us solve problems and giving us many surprises during our stay. She will also promptly tell us the location of the event, how to get there, and contact you in time about what you need in the room. She can help us if we don’t understand anything. , every detail is taken care of, thank you so much to the housekeeper Xiao Ruan! They also prepared welcome fruits and arranged small surprises while we were out for fun. These experiences brought to us were so wonderful that they will always remain in our happy memories. I stayed at the Atlantis Hotel in the Bahamas in the United States a few years ago. From entering the lobby to checking out, the hotel service is quite different. It is not as good as the Atlantis Hotel in Sanya. Not only the details, but also the I give full marks to the warm attitude towards guests staying here from top to bottom.

Let’s talk about the hotel’s guest room hygiene and facilities. I read a lot of reviews before, and some said that the hotel facilities are old. This time I went, there was nothing that looked old. The bathtub and hardware were very clean, and there was no trace of water at all. The stains and details are all done very well. I am a mysophobic person, and I noticed that all the housekeepers in the hotel and even the lobby cleaning staff use Dyson vacuum cleaners to mop the floors. The bathroom slippers except the guest room slippers are all new and disposable.

I only went to the aquarium but not to the water world. The mermaid in the aquarium🧜♀️ is really beautiful and there are many cute little fish🐠. Although the aquarium is not particularly big, it is worth a visit.

The hotel's breakfast is very rich. Although there are many people, the dishes are replenished in a timely manner and taste good. They can take care of the eating habits of people from all over the world. Even the tofu curd has salty and sweet flavors. Full of details.

There are staff who will guide you and greet you at the forks in the hotel park. Everything makes you feel very friendly. The hotel is also very quiet at night, and you can feel the sea breeze and waves.

During your stay, our butler Xiao Ruan made you feel happy all the time. It was so perfect and wonderful. My parents and I felt very relaxed these days. When I come to Sanya again, I will not consider other hotels and book here directly. I really recommend it. You must go there in person to know what a real vacation place is.

Facilities: Fully automatic refrigerator and coffee
Hygiene: clean
Environment: Comfortable
Service: First-rate, better than other five-stars in China, the butler is enthusiastic and considerate!

msg:Balcony door. That instruction was not posted properly. It was clearly a side pull, but it was not said to be a side pull. A normal person would think it was a push outward, okay? How do girls push? I asked someone to come up. How many times did you call? If it is pulled to the side, it is said to be side pull. If it is turned to the side, it is said to be turned to the desired degree. Can it be all posted and written? I know it's because of the strong wind. The floor is high, so the doors and windows should be thick and sturdy, and they should be easy to use.

The guest door to the bedroom is also so heavy for safety. But can we, let alone make a magnetic thing behind the door, girls can only close it but not open it, right? You have to keep communicating through that broken door.

With such a large hotel toiletries supply, can we get some facial cleanser? There are also samples of moisturizing lotion and the like, which don’t cost much.

Anyway, there were a lot of problems. I reported a lot of them when I checked in, and I can’t remember them all now.

There are also time limits for washing and drying clothes. What about those who are on an emergency business trip? What should they do if they are in a hurry to do laundry at night? And the price setting is too unreasonable. It's too expensive. The hotel has already made so little and so much money in one night. This kind of thoughtful place should be more affordable for people. Don't they all say they want the guests to feel at home?

The one where clothes are washed and dried. What kind of watch is placed in such a secret corner? Even if I ask... I can't find it. Who can see it? Can you hear the obvious part? If the characters are bigger, what do you want the elderly to do? As a young man, I don't know how to operate your laundry process. There are also other things like making phone calls and making reservations. If you want to make money, you have to set so many thresholds for yourself. I don’t know what you are thinking.

Or is Atlantis just a one-time business?

There is also a receptionist who can’t even answer the name of his CEO or boss. Do you think this kind of employee education is reasonable?

In terms of service, both men and women are welcome, and their attitudes are very good. It's just that the efficiency is a bit slow. Every time I call, there are a lot of things reported and I have to talk some official useless nonsense first, which wastes everyone's time. Let's be flexible on this point, okay?

By the way, if your laundry room is not easy to use, we can hand wash it ourselves, which is simple, convenient and clean. For example, we bring our own underwear and the like. Can the balcony be designed as a windproof house structure? Then get a Roman pole for guests to dry their clothes

You have to be considerate, but are you still worried about not having long-term customers? And he is also a long-term financial user.

There is also the issue of sanitary napkins. Shouldn’t such a large hotel always have sanitary napkins? What's wrong? You know how to prepare condoms, but not sanitary napkins? Women can hold back their menstruation. I borrowed the sanitary napkin from the waitress.

Such a big hotel doesn't even have WiFi. Isn't this basic? Small hotels in the mainland have it.

Overall, I feel very comfortable, the scenery is beautiful, the breakfast is very user-friendly until 12 o'clock, and there is unlimited entry to the water world and aquarium. It's great. Also, the hotel housekeeper, Ms. Moon, has a very nice attitude. I especially like her reply on WeChat instantly 👍 She answers all questions. However, the baby was sick, and the experience of going to the 301 Hospital was really a failure on this trip. They didn’t give me a bonus, which was not humane at all, and their attitude was really bad.

The hotel has an aquarium, shopping avenue, restaurants, duty-free experience stores, and you can go to Water World unlimited times. I checked in at the hotel. , the hotel will arrange a housekeeper to be responsible for the reception. The interior decoration of the hotel is also very comfortable and the beds are very comfortable. All the utensils are prepared according to the model of a family of four. I would like to thank the housekeeper Anna for asking for breakfast every morning and asking for any needs. You can contact the housekeeper if you have any questions and you will get a timely reply. It is a very good check-in experience. The hotel itself also has many swimming pools, which are very clean. There will always be rescuers in each pool. The on-site service staff will bring towels and ask if they are needed. In the hotel, we dine in two restaurants, Crocus and Colorful Crystal. It is a brunch buffet style. You can go in from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Each restaurant has its own characteristics. Personally, I prefer Crocus because of its large size. , there are also many dining categories.
Next time I go to Sanya, I will consider Atlantis Hotel. It feels very comfortable.

Only those on high floors could check in immediately and asked us to do so. An upgrade, I added 1200 so that I can have breakfast, dinner and lunch on the second day. I live on the 50th floor.

msg:A one-stop resort for the lazy and the whole family - Atlantis Sanya

I have seen the aquarium room that appeared in Zimei and Li Xian's "Dear, Beloved", which was filmed in Atlantis Sanya. When you go on vacation in Sanya, your first impression may be Atlantis. It is suitable for lazy people to spend a few days with their families. It is famous for its aquarium and water world.

Location:
Located in Haitang Bay, about 50 minutes from Phoenix Airport, surrounded by other hotels, and close to duty-free shops

Public area:
The hotel lobby is very large, and it feels like there are a lot of people in the off-season, but compared to Dubai's Yate, it is relatively simple;
There is also a VIP reception desk on the left and right sides of the reception desk when you enter;
One side is directly connected to the aquarium and Atlanta Mall, and the other side is separate from the low-rise elevator and the high-rise elevator.

Serve:
I feel that the service experience is average, commonly known as "six-star hotel, three-star service"; if the peak season comes, there will basically not be enough waiters, so be mentally prepared; if you are looking for service, Yanlord Crown and EDITION are next door. Doesn’t it smell good?

Room:
This time I stayed in a Supreme Suite and had Atlantis Club privileges. The room is 100 square meters, about the same size as my home. Inside the room, the decoration is simple, with elements based on blue and ocean. The washing space is quite good, and the suite will have an extra bathroom. Equipped with TV, office and leisure areas. The balcony is large and you can watch the sunrise and sunset. The package said that Hermès accessories are provided, but later it said that Hermès was not available. This is intolerable.

Dining room:
The breakfast restaurant adopts a buffet style, and there are two on the G floor. There are many dishes, but there are also many people. If you arrive late in the off-season, you will have to queue up.
The Atlantis Club on the 48th floor can only be enjoyed by staying in Atlantis Club rooms and suites. Six meals are provided every day, breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, happy hour, and early morning tea break. There is no queue for breakfast, lunch and dinner, there are few people, and although the dishes are small, you can fill up. The other three meals are just haha, the food is pitiful and can be ignored

other:
Beach: The sand is relatively co****, the water is not very nice, and the waves are too big to go into the sea.
Aquarium: The aquarium has a lot of movies, but I don’t think it’s worth it if outsiders need tickets because it’s relatively small inside. There is a mermaid performance and a question and answer session. Please refer to the event schedule for details.
Water World: Fun.
Rapids - a maximum of two people, lie down in the swimming ring and drift, which means you may spin around the starting point for half an hour and need the help of a lifeguard;
Shark Crossing - rated as the weakest event by the lifeguards, maximum two people, you need to carry a swimming ring upstairs, but at the beginning you will still be frightened by its spinning and rapid descent, and at the end you will enter the shark to eat and drift for a while, Don’t let this drift fool you;
Raging Sea Roller Coaster - a group of up to three people, the level of stimulation is acceptable, but you need to wear swimming goggles, the water will spray so hard that you can't even open your eyes;
Whirlwind Trumpet - a group of two or four people, experience the feeling of instant weightlessness. After the end, your legs will become weak, and your soul will still stay in the sky;
Poseidon's Leap and Give it a Go - the two most exciting events, but not for the faint of heart;
Others such as Trumpet, Wave Rider, Octopus Racing, etc. have not been played.
Show C: I didn’t go to see it, but I saw the fireworks and drone show at the restaurant
SPA: The price is ridiculously high, not recommended

Summarize:
Suitable for lazy people, a one-stop place for eating, drinking and having fun, taking care of children, making friends, and team building. If you need to enjoy service and beautiful scenery, I don’t recommend this place.

Then during our stay, he responded and recovered in a timely manner according to our needs, helped us answer various questions, and arranged timely personnel to help us get it. Baggage, help us reserve the airport bus in advance. Overall, the experience was very good and I felt at home.
Environment: The room is large and the bed is also large. It is not crowded at all for two adults and one child. The room faces the sea and the view is very good. It feels very comfortable.

Hygiene: Hygiene is great, sheets, towels, and tabletops are all clean.

Facilities: The hotel facilities are well maintained, and all signs and instructions are clear. The gym is very big, the equipment is very advanced, and there are coaches to teach you how to use the equipment, which feels good. There are also many places for children to play, and children have a lot of fun.

Room! The hotel is located on the 39th floor. The balcony faces the sea and has a wide view.

A butler will contact you after you check in. This butler (jailene) is the most satisfactory one I have experienced in so many hotels! Any time you contact her, she will respond promptly! She is a very gentle young lady. Taste
I bought a buffet coupon for 398/person in the evening. I forgot that the food was very rich, and each person got half a wave (this wave is amazing, it goes well with cream cheese)
What a seven! ! )
I have already recommended it to three national hotels, and they said they would come and stay here during the Spring Festival! !
If I have the chance to come to Sanya again, I will definitely stay at Atlantis~

It is said that there is a queue to check in when there are many people. It takes half an hour or even longer. There is no way that children will like it. There are marine animals, various activities, and undersea dining attractions. The price on November 11 has nothing wrong with it except that it is a bit expensive. The hotel provides butler service. Contact us in advance before check-in. You will be sent various reminders during check-in, which is very considerate. The butler Xiao Xu also prepared souvenirs. The check-in staff is a girl named Shu, who is kind-hearted and willing to ask questions. Answer, I helped my children solve many questions, and the recommended restaurants were also very good. I was very satisfied with the arrangement. I stayed there for two days but didn't have enough time, so I extended it for another night. The view from this supreme suite is amazing. I stood on the balcony and looked around at various landscapes. At night, I sat in the room and enjoyed the fireworks. I sighed that every penny is worth it. Live, the money is enough, the location is interesting. Thanks again to housekeeper Xiao Xu and Shu Mei~

msg:The overall living experience is good. The housekeeper Clara's attentive service can't be said enough. The last two days in Sanya were very good. However, the sound insulation effect of the room was slightly poor. There was a child who kept crying and could be heard clearly. The only thing I felt was that this hotel was not too good. Like a 5-star hotel, the overall attitude of the service staff is mediocre, especially in the restaurant in the morning. The girl who took the noodles was as if she owed her something. She was very arrogant. However, I still give full marks to the service of the housekeeper and the check-in girl at the front desk.

msg:The hotel really lives up to its reputation, it's really super comfortable. The sea view room has a large bed with suitable softness and firmness. There is also a TV in the room to watch movies. You can also lie down and watch movies after the facilities are over in the evening.

Water World is of course fun. If you are alone, please note that some facilities require sharing (more than 2 people). Then the fireworks at night and the water jet show are awesome. When working with Honor of Kings, the cosplayers are very professional.

As expected, you have to go inside to see the aquarium. Unlike the large glass outside, there are many other fish inside, and you can even feed them!

There is also Show C. I purchased ordinary seats, which looked fine. If the VIP seats were better, the story would be bad, but the performers were super professional and saved a lot of points!

The food is average, and the prices are similar to those in Hong Kong. Just eat enough. I have to mention that there will be a fruit plate in the room! Very considerate!

There is not enough time to play on the beach, but the tree view in the inner courtyard is very good.

The last thing I have to mention is that there is a dedicated waiter who will answer all your questions about Atlantis. In addition to information about the hotel, she will also care about the experience of staying in the hotel. I relied on her for my entire trip. You gave me your advice to plan it so well! Also because I couldn't use my phone frequently, she used WeChat to contact me. She is Emma, ​​a super good waiter, not a bot 😂 Thank you, give you 5 🌟 🌟.

Finally, I felt so comfortable that I really didn’t want to leave. Goodbye Emma, ​​Atlantis👋🏻

Our family stayed here for two nights this time, and the experience was truly worthy of the name. It's amazing that such a large hotel can provide such meticulous service. The hotel's own aquarium and water world allow children to check in every day. The activities and facilities in the hotel are very user-friendly. I believe I will stop here every time I come to Sanya in the future. Finally, special thanks to the butler Davis for his meticulous arrangements from check-in to check-out.

2. Breakfast is average and not rich in variety.
3. The play area for younger children is not obvious and not interesting enough. This may be related to the hotel’s positioning and is more suitable for young friends.

The experience of the water world in the off-season is very good. There is basically no need to queue for the activities.

When the weather got cold, I also put a towel on my second baby. Very considerate, the hotel's waiters are very enthusiastic and polite. When checking out, the baby held the room card and refused to let go, so the waiter gave the room card to the child, which made the child very happy. The only suggestion is to use the hair dryer. I have replaced it with a negative ion one and I feel much better. A pleasant trip. I feel like there isn’t enough time in one day to play.

msg:The view from the hotel is great! There are many swimming pools inside, and they lead directly to the beach outside. There are also lifeguards arranged by the hotel on the beach! The sand on the beach is very fine, the water in the swimming pool is clear, and they are all constant-temperature swimming pools. You can even feel the warm current inside when you swim at night. The hotel staff are also very friendly. They will greet you when they meet on the road. Their service is very considerate and they will try their best to help you if you encounter difficulties. I was walking next to the beach at night and one of my slippers was washed away by the sea water. The lifeguard at the beach immediately contacted the hotel and sent me a new pair. This time, because I extended my stay for one night, I have two reservations to evaluate. Originally, I gave the previous order a fair rating due to the bad attitude of a certain waiter, but now that I see it, I still feel a little sorry. After all, my overall experience on this trip was great except for that person! The room view in this hotel is also very good and spacious. I recommend everyone to stay there!

I decisively checked out 2 days in advance and moved to Atlantis. Art. Yate meets all the one-stop needs for eating, drinking and having fun without leaving the hotel. The elderly and children all had a great time. The housekeeper Jason Xiaochen is also very dedicated and considerate. He introduced and cared about everything and met my special needs of helping to print a color homework paper for my child.

The environment is normal. Apart from the appearance, there is nothing amazing in the room. What needs improvement most is the service. There is no service. There is poor coordination and communication between various depar**ents to solve problems.
The welcome fruit was delivered as soon as we checked out. The butler was insincere and did not respond to our requests. We booked a supreme sea view room. The front desk said that there was no free upgrade to the room type. The butler said that it had been upgraded to the Royal Club room type. When asked about the rights, he said nothing. , the previous check-in gift and check-out gift were not available, even the children's dolls had to be requested by themselves. The front desk said that one child could receive two, but when checking out, they said that only one could be given. . .

I wanted to bring some bread for my children for breakfast, but I was told that I had to sign a liability exemption agreement. . . Why could I bring it before? Management is too messy
The so-called Water World Aquarium is enough to enter once, but there is no need to play.

You staff are just working at the Atlantis Hotel. Don’t think of yourself as such. Atlantis has a condescending attitude and looks disdainful towards the guests. This service attitude and professionalism are completely incompatible with the hotel. I thought the hotel service was poor, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. I was People who come to the hotel for vacation do not come to the hotel to be insulted. I am really disgusted by these staff.

When I checked in at the front desk, I upgraded to a club room type. The floors of the club rooms are all above 48+. This time I stayed on the 51st floor. I can see the park and sea views more clearly, and the field of vision is also wide. Although there are many attractions, it is difficult to sleep at night. Very quiet, no impact.
Room facilities: The TV can be projected onto the screen. If you are too lazy to go out, you can watch your favorite variety shows and TV series in the room, which is very convenient.
Lost Aquarium: There are cute jellyfish, beluga whales, and various marine creatures, and you can enjoy the wonders of the underwater world.
Water World: The water projects are very thrilling, and there is also a water curtain light show at night. Those who like King of Glory can go and see it.
There is fruit in the room every day, and there are free drinks in the water bar. It is really convenient to have food, accommodation and entertainment all in one place. I like it😍.
Service: After checking in, I was contacted by the housekeeper. Butler Xiao Yuan promptly sent me the meal schedule, and responded to any questions in a timely manner. He helped confirm the reservation status of the airport bus before leaving, and also prepared a small gift for us🎁. I had a great experience throughout my stay and all the services were very considerate❤️

Just for the sake of visiting the water park.
Since I have experience in visiting a water park, the conclusion is that there are three slides and there is nothing to do there. He is very small .

The hotel is beautiful, very big.
Everything is thought out at breakfast, you don’t have to stand in lines.
First one person greets you, then a second and third person sits you down at the table. (This is important because the hotel is large and there are a lot of people there.) The choice of food is good.
The rooms are excellent, newly renovated, Ahava cosmetics. 
The room has everything you need.
The view from the window was gorgeous.
When checking into the room, the children were given two soft toys, which was very nice.
High-speed elevator.
Mini bar was included in the room price.
The girls at the reception try to solve all your questions, they are very hospitable.
Thank you.

Room: I booked a king-size bed room with a supreme sea view. I stayed on the 46th floor. The location was good, but the weather was not good. It mostly rained and a few were cloudy, so the sea view was not beautiful and gray. When I went swimming, the wind blew me cold. The fruits delivered are of good quality, and the free mineral water is too much to drink every day.
Children's entertainment: There is a mini indoor children's playground, which is more suitable for children around 3 years old. The mini camp has free handicraft courses, and many of the toys in it are high-end goods. When it rains heavily and there is nowhere to go, you can spend a day here.
Water World: The only places that children dare to play are the rafting and wave pools and hotel swimming pools. On this point, I still think that bringing children over 10 years old can play **. After all, many of them have height requirements, so children can play in big events. One, the minimum height requirement is 107CM. My father and I couldn't leave, and it was impossible for us to take turns to play exciting and big projects, so we didn't play any of them, which was a big loss. The full day care fee of 598 was too expensive.
Brunch: Very good. There are so many delicious things that you can’t eat them all. There are too many people on weekends and you have to queue up at every stall.
The overall hardware strength is definitely good, but many of them require additional charges. If you want to pursue cost-effectiveness, this is not suitable.

msg:Atlantis Hotel is very famous and well-known. All China knows about this hotel. The hotel's marketing planning is very successful, and the hotel management is also quite successful.
The operation of a hotel depends on service. Atlantis Hotel has obviously worked hard in terms of hotel service. I would like to highlight the hotel's butler service.
My butler is Mr. Lu Baishuo, a young man from Northeast China who has not been in the job for a long time. He is very capable and agile. It is difficult to equate his age of 20 with his maturity, stability, meticulousness and thoughtfulness. During the few days we stayed at the hotel, Mr. Lu's enthusiasm and meticulousness left a deep impression on us. He was able to give us suggestions and guidance on the daily itinerary, and he was like an old friend to us. In addition, Mr. Lu will take the initiative to contact us tomorrow morning and evening to ask if we have any requirements or need help. He is very considerate and caring.
The service in the restaurant is also very orderly and clean, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, and the service attitude and quality are perfect. I would like to highlight senior waiter Dai Zhihui and supervisor Quan Yeli. They both take the lead in working in the restaurant every day. He is a good example and has won unanimous praise from everyone. He is a rare managerial waiter.
The service and service level of the hotel are reflected by the work of the hotel's employees. Everyone's understanding and opinions of the hotel are also reflected from them. We are very grateful to the hotel for cultivating such excellent employees and thank the hotel for giving us Provide such excellent service.
We believe that when the hotel is focusing on management and service, there must be many outstanding employees like Mr. Lu Baishuo. Despite this, we are still very grateful to write this letter to express our feelings, and sincerely hope that the hotel can cultivate more excellent employees. Excellent staff make the hotel's service level truly match the hotel's reputation. A truly perfect match that truly makes guests from all over the world flock here and praise them!

We had breakfast and dinner at Saffron. Daisy Dai at the restaurant took good care of our children. During dinner, she watched our children run several times to get salmon. She directly asked the chef to put a large round plate of salmon for us. It was delivered to our table, and the service was very considerate.

An employee said that the computer was broken and asked us to go outside. A front desk outside was on the phone, and we kept waiting. There was a new queue behind us, and the check-in process was extremely slow. It took ten minutes to check in for the room in front of us. Minutes later, we arrived. I don’t understand why the check-in process took so long? Other facilities were okay. There were no refrigerator magnets or dolphins mentioned when I checked out. When I went downstairs to check out, a waiter asked for the room card and then the room card was gone. . I left in a daze, with nothing left. There are a lot of kids, and the 498 yuan for the dinner buffet is not worth it. 1,000 yuan for two people is really a rip off, but it’s not bad for the price. The key is that it’s worth 150 yuan at most. . Water World is okay, the aquarium can be visited in 10 minutes.

Because I lived on the 38th floor and it was very windy during the few days I checked in, I didn’t sleep well on the first day. At 10 o’clock on the second day, I posted on Moments to complain about Haitang Bay. It was too windy and noisy. When Emma saw it, she immediately sent me a WeChat message to ask if I needed to change rooms, and arranged check-in that night.
You can enter the water world and aquarium as many times as you want. When you are tired, go back to your room and lie down. After you have rested, put on a bathrobe and continue playing downstairs. If the bathrobe gets wet and the slippers get dirty, call and they will send new ones right away. It’s really cool. Very convenient.
It happened to be a Sunday when we checked in, and we caught up with the fireworks show. It was very beautiful, and the water curtain show was also very beautiful. There were many performances every day, and it was great value. There should be no hotel in Sanya that can compare with Yate in terms of entertainment. My parents We unanimously think that Yate is the best in this trip. I will choose to stay at Yate in the future and have a full experience.

Every staff member in the hotel is very enthusiastic, especially Piao Piao's high-quality service, which made the short five-day vacation very happy and satisfying. If you come to Sanya, choosing Atlantis is the first choice without any guide at all, and it is great value for money. Post pictures and share your happiness. I will choose Atlantis next time. Give Piaopiao a like👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻. Thank you very much. See you next time😀😀😀

msg:A very, very satisfying trip! It is indeed Atlantis, and it deserves its reputation! !
      We booked a king-size bed room with a sea view. The room might not have been cleaned because the guest checked out too late, so the hotel immediately upgraded us to a king suite. The hotel room is clean, tidy and comfortable, and our housekeeper, Ms. Mengmeng, is attentive and considerate. The hotel's breakfast buffet has a wide variety of varieties and authentic tastes. If you want to eat Western, Chinese and local specialties, you can find them here!
      The playgrounds in the hotel courtyard and water world are beautiful and equipped with many lifeguards. Parents with children can rest assured. Water World has exciting projects for adults to enjoy, as well as wave pools and rafting projects that are suitable for all ages. The aquarium gives people a strong sense of immersion, reminding me of the scene in the movie "Aquaman". I also caught up with the special water curtain show and fireworks show on November 1, which was so lucky ~
      It is recommended that friends who plan to go to the water world prepare river wading shoes in advance.
      Small details that made my husband and I very touching and unforgettable: it rained heavily on the second day after we checked in, and the housekeeper Mengmeng immediately prepared warm brown sugar and ginger tea for us after learning about it; my husband had a scratch on his foot and asked if there was a band-aid. Mengmeng quickly arranged for a waiter to bring a band-aid and asked about the injury and whether he needed iodophor. The night before I left, the housekeeper Mengmeng specially gave me a small gift, which was a stuffed whale doll! So happy~

There was a free mini bar and free flow of the unique Atlantis mineral water (I even brought a bottle back with me). The second thing is the attentive service of Jackson, the attentive butler. He took great care of us for two consecutive days. The slippers and bathrobes in the room were all tailor-made. He also helped apply for small dolls to appease the children who were busy with their homework. ; Once again, there is the buffet brunch. The restaurant is very large, with a wide variety of food, very cost-effective, and the restaurant waiters are also very enthusiastic; there is also the Water World and the aquarium, the C show is worth seeing, and the light show will dazzle you. It’s worth coming here for a family trip, and I will visit again if I have the opportunity.

The hotel waiters are very enthusiastic and have good attitudes.
The facilities are complete, the decoration is grand, clean and comfortable. We live on the 42nd floor. The elevator is very fast. You can hardly feel the imbalance or weightlessness. You can go upstairs in more than 20 seconds. The room has no peculiar smell, everything is complete, and the view is very good, you can see the sea ~
The interior of the hotel itself is more like a large shopping mall, where you can go shopping. The water world is very fun. Personally, I prefer the aquarium, which has unlimited fun during your stay (it is located near the hotel lobby). The breakfast is self-service, with a wide range of categories, and the taste and quality are very good~
I feel like staying for one night is not enough. The large park is equivalent to a 15-minute living circle of a high-end residential area (the beach is far away from the hotel and the waves are very big, so pay attention to safety)
In addition, I would like to praise Clara~ she is very active in connecting with guests, answering questions, and even delivering small gifts to their doorsteps❤

I personally like to watch the show, but I am a bit disappointed with Show C. Maybe because I used to be an artist, the standards are stricter and the performers are not very dedicated. It's a show for the sake of show, but the ticket price of 200 for staying guests is not bad. The catering of the Royal Club is very good. Both food and wine are rich. Especially the coffee on the 48th floor. I give it a thumbs up. I usually drink three cups of coffee a day. I have high requirements for the taste of coffee. There is a cup of coffee in the room. I am very satisfied with nespresso. I can drink coffee in the morning without going out. At night, you don’t need to go downstairs to watch the light and water show on the balcony, as well as the drone show right at your fingertips. Compared with Atlantis on Paradise Island in the Bahamas, the aquarium and guest rooms occupy a smaller area, but they are better. The service is absolutely 👍👍👍 Paid interactions with various water activities and marine animals are also more cost-effective. The housekeeper Grace is attentive and can solve any problems promptly. As an international brand resort, it would be more friendly if the mini program could have English version guidelines (family members do not speak Chinese)

Got it down to every detail.
Our housing was arranged on the 43rd floor, with a good view. We could see the sea and the sunrise. When we went, it was the rehearsal and opening of the Honor of Kings Festival on November 5, various cosplay and performance activities, plus many pool parties. , C show, fireworks show, trapeze show, etc., I feel that every day is very fulfilling, I feel a little busy in the hotel, and the children have a lot of fun.
There are two small issues to note: First, the day before check-in, we called to ask about the number of people who wanted to stay, but when we arrived, the room did not prepare toothbrushes, slippers, etc. according to the number of people we had. If this detail is in place, It will feel better.
Second, when cleaning the room, if there are insufficient paper towels, they should be replenished in time, so that the guests will not run out of paper towels halfway through their stay. However, they will be delivered as soon as you call, and they will proactively ask if there is enough water, which is quite good.
All in all it's pretty good, very satisfying.

Breakfast is open until 14 o'clock, which is a paradise for vacationers. There is so much water in the room that there is almost no need for service staff to fetch water. All staff you meet on the road will smile and say hello.
The ocean parent-child room is particularly large, and the large 270-degree balcony is also highly recommended.
The aquarium is not big, but it is enough for a five-year-old child to play in, and he visited it twice. The water world is more suitable for older children, but the wave pool is enough to kill an hour or two.
The Su cuisine at Songhelou is surprisingly authentic, and the spa is not a choice either. It smells good after cooking and tastes very high-end.
It would be even better if the hair dryer and toilet in the room were replaced by Dyson and smart toilet. The children said they wanted to come again and looked forward to the next trip.

msg:Facilities: The facilities are well maintained, relatively new, and the decoration style is clean, modern and refreshing. The sofa and bed were also very comfortable. Then the hotel also has its own swimming pool, which is less crowded than Water World, so it’s great to take your kids to play.

Hygiene: This is what I like. It is cleaned in the morning and afternoon, and it is basically kept clean at all times. Quite like it.
The kid had a fall on his leg at the Hilton earlier and had a wound. I brought a bottle over there and it felt unhygienic. I ordered some iodophor here, which is cotton swab type. The iodine is in a tube. It is the same as what is used at home, so it is more hygienic.

Environment: The suite is large and spacious. Facing the sea, it is really beautiful. You can see the sea from every room. The view is particularly good.

Service: The butler service is particularly good, beating the Hilton butler service. We can help coordinate and solve basic needs. Very professional. No flaws. When I asked the housekeeper for iodophor, I told him to go to the Water World in the evening, and the housekeeper arranged for us to come back and give us some ginger tea to ward off the cold. Quite thoughtful.
Of course, there are other things to arrange, and the service is also very good.

Check-in and check-out procedures in the VIP room in the lobby area: We went there in the off-season, there were very few people, we were the only family, so it was very comfortable.

spa: The private rooms are very luxurious and spacious. This one cannot be compared to the Banyan Tree. I originally thought that Banyan Tree would focus on a spa, but in terms of techniques and decoration of private rooms, Xiaoya is better.

Convenience: This hotel in Xiaoya is also better than having its own water world and aquarium. It is very convenient to play. We went to the water world in the morning, took a nap in the afternoon and went to the aquarium, and then went to the water world after dinner. It’s perfect, it avoids the hottest and sunniest times, and I’m not tired at all.

Food: There are many restaurants. This is my first time here, so I chose the most expensive experience, the underwater restaurant. If you go by the meal price of more than 1,000 yuan, the cost-effectiveness of the ingredients is pretty good. Mainly, I spent one thousand to buy a viewing seat. Anyway, it’s worth it to experience it once. Deluxe suites can dine at the Atlantis Club, so you can dine on the 48th floor for lunch and dinner. The ingredients will be better, with abalone on one day and lobster on the other. The lobster is very fresh, chewy and tender. There is no perfunctory customer service. very good. Breakfast is at the restaurant on the G floor of Saffron. The ingredients are relatively ordinary, but there are many choices and the menu prices are OK. However, even though there are too many people, the 48th Floor Club is better, the ingredients are much better, and the crowds are more acceptable.

We went out to play. We stored our luggage at the front desk and asked the staff to room
And I was given a late check-out even if my flight was delayed.
If you need any supplies, ask the waiter to bring them to the room immediately.
Remind us of daily activities at the resort and give suggestions
I have a special liking for hotel slippers
I just tried to ask
Immediately arrange for someone to deliver new ones for us to take away! Simply amazing!
The old ones were taken away too! He said that he should keep a pair at his grandma’s house, and he should also keep a pair at his own house. ୧😂୨୧😂୨୧😂୨୧😂୨

Atlantis Deep Sea Scream Night Ticket: An exclusive event for Halloween. It was very exciting and scared me. The NPC wearing makeup and holding a doll fish was very heart-warming. I was scared to cry when I saw it. It was very heart-warming. The staff comforted me and told me not to be afraid. They also stopped other NPCs who wanted to scare us and escorted us up the escalator. Thank you very much!
Unlimited access to Water World Aquarium for 2 adults and 2 children: Water World is very exciting, so exciting that I don’t dare to play the two signature projects🤣 Come play next time

If you go to Water World and Aquarium, I highly recommend booking this hotel. Not only does it include tickets but also a buffet. It is within walking distance to Water World and Aquarium. The light show at Water World at night is also amazing! Another surprise is that the hotel is also equipped with a private butler service. Our butler Xiao Chen provided excellent service and was very enthusiastic! Very patient in answering various questions. All in all, it was a pleasant hotel experience!

msg:Thanks to the warm hospitality of the housekeeper Summer, I booked the Atlantis executive package for this trip. I added Summer's WeChat account in advance the day before check-in, inquired about the check-in requirements, and booked us a room on the 53rd floor near the villa area in advance. The scenery is really good. It's great...it feels like you can reach out and catch the clouds!
When checking in, I went directly to the VIP reception room to check in. The child got a lollipop, which was very fast and convenient... The room was decorated with welcome fruits and roses. In the meantime, my child had a fever. Summer helped deliver medicine and didn’t ring the doorbell until the child fell asleep. He sent me a WeChat message to tell me that he was at the door... Anyway, he was very attentive...
For the hotel, we deliberately chose the off-season and thought it would be very leisurely, but we still felt that there were many people. When we ate at the executive courtesy restaurant on the 48th floor, we felt that there were many people and we were in a hurry... Friends who pay attention to relaxation during vacation may feel a little uncomfortable. Time-limited…
It is very friendly to have unlimited access to aquariums and water parks by swiping your face during your stay... C Show recommends buying a supreme VIP. The perspective is indeed different. There is a lot of interaction when entering half an hour early...
Personally, I feel that Atlantis is more suitable for couples to travel...

Software services include welcome fruits, birthday cakes, infirmary care, baby gifts, etc. Although other hotels also have them, it can only be said that they are not on the same level. You can experience it in person.
2,000+ per night is really cheap. You have unlimited entry and exit during your stay, and you can enjoy 7-star hotel services. It is the ceiling for domestic family travel! Unexpectedly, I got my child’s love for painting and water. I went home and started cultivating it in this direction. I look forward to painting next time.

msg:This trip to Sanya, I chose Atlantis after a long time. I was very satisfied with my stay here. The housekeeper Jiali added WeChat in advance and prepared baby supplies and playpens. One room was even upgraded to a suite. She really responded to our questions and requests at any time and was considerate of the customers. The hotel service is very attentive. From the moment you enter, open the door, pick up your luggage, and walk a few steps, you can see the waiter, which makes you feel very safe. We had a baby with us, so we went to the aquarium as soon as we arrived. It rained on the second day and we went to the children's paradise. On the third day, the weather was fine. Unfortunately, we had to rush to Wuzhizhou Island to play and didn't have time to have fun in the water world. I was very touched that when we were traveling and shooting in the hotel, we accidentally lost the baby's coat. We told the housekeeper Jia Li, and we mobilized colleagues to look for it together. We actually found it at about 11 o'clock in the evening. Thank you very much. There is also a very rich breakfast, which is available from 7:30 to 2:00 pm, for those who want to sleep in. Staying for two nights is not enough fun, and it is close to the duty-free shop. In short, if you are traveling with children or on vacation, feel free to go!

msg:1⃣️When you check into the hotel, a housekeeper will be arranged to help you carry your luggage. When you check into the room, you will be informed about some hotel activities, dining spots and other information. When you check in, you will also receive 3 small dolphin dolls for your baby. The welcome fruit portion is also very generous, as well as minibar drinks and two boxes of beef. Sugar candy 🍬! If the baby wets the bed, he is very patient and arranges to change it as soon as possible!
2⃣️After checking in, the service of the housekeeper Emma was very good. I must give her a big thumbs up. She added WeChat when checking in. If you need anything, just say it on WeChat and it will be arranged quickly. This service is very good!
3⃣️Check into the hotel and enjoy unlimited swiping at the Water World and Aquarium. My daughter likes playing in the water. She goes to the wave pool every day. She only swiped at the aquarium once. Maybe this kind of place is the best place to go. There are too many, and I don’t like it much anymore! So there is no need to go again, you have never been! Go straight out of the hotel room on the left and pass through a coconut grove to reach the hotel beach 🏖️. My female goose loves digging in the sand, and she comes to dig there every morning! The baby seems to have no resistance to digging in the sand, and he has achieved sand digging🆓!
4⃣️For young babies, such as 1-2 years old, 2-3 years old, 3-6 years old, different groups of babies, there is no detailed description of the specific items that can be played, resulting in many items that our babies did not play. It was a pity that I didn’t see the relevant detailed instructions in the page description when I bought the package in the early stage. However, Emma, ​​the housekeeper, said that next time I check in, she can give me a chance to upgrade the room type for free, which is not bad! The service is really nothing to say!
5⃣️At night, the entire hotel water world is swimming in a sea of ​​pink. The entire park is very beautiful. If you have the opportunity, you can also see the pink water curtain show without anyone taking the show. My female goose said it is very beautiful!
6⃣️There was nothing particularly delicious about the food. On the first day I checked in, I ate the buffet for two that came with the package. The food was really not delicious. For such a big hotel, the food was really a failure. In addition, it was not delicious and expensive, but it was still good. Well, you can order takeout in the hotel and have it delivered directly to the takeout counter at the door of the hotel. You can pick it up after entering the four digits of your mobile phone number. Only after I checked in did I understand why so many people order takeout in such a big hotel. The hotel also has a takeout counter. It’s expensive. Secondly, the main reason is that it doesn’t taste good! This real hotel should pay attention to improving its catering!

Entering the hotel lobby, you will immediately be greeted by a beautiful lady who will arrange the fastest check-in location. The lady who handled the process was also smiling and patient throughout the process. There was no room at that time, so we went to have lunch. Within an hour, we received a text message informing us that the room had been arranged. I had left a message with Ctrip in advance saying that I needed bed guardrails. When I entered the room, I saw that the guardrails had already been arranged. Soon after, the housekeeper Xiao Hao would call me to ask about my experience and whether I needed help. In the past few days, Xiao Hao has been saying hello every day, and he has been very enthusiastic about solving my feedback and questions. Thanks to housekeeper Xiao Hao for your service.
I ordered the Royal Club package. You can really eat it for a day. Breakfast and lunch are very rich. Afternoon tea and desserts are served at 2:30 pm, and happy hour is held at 5 pm. It’s really fun. There is unlimited supply of meat, so you don’t have to go out to eat hahahahaha
Overall, the experience these days has been good. The housekeeper Xiao Hao is also enthusiastic. Come again next time.

Compared to the meals we had a few years ago, the food was already very bad. In the next few days, I drank some coffee and let my kids eat some. After returning to the room, I silently opened the takeout and ordered food!
The room is on the side of the park. I don't know why the room is still noisy after the park is closed at night. It may be the sound of the machine.
The hotel lobby is still a mess!
If you want peace and good food, don't stay here. I will never step into Atlantis again when I go to Sanya in the future.

The hotel's buffet breakfast and dinner are also very good, with many choices. The c show is also very exciting. There is a supermarket downstairs where you can buy snacks and fruits. If you feel that the water world is far away, you can also go to the hotel downstairs with its own swimming pool if you don’t want to do the activities. All the staff are very good and provide me with food in the room every day. Cleaned cleanly. Living in Atlantis is really worth it!

msg:For the sake of bringing a baby, we made Atlantis the first stop of our trip to Sanya Haitang Bay. The overall experience was both expected and unexpected.
Unsurprisingly, as one of the benchmark hotels in Haitang Bay, Sanya, everything from hardware to service reflects the standards of Sanya's top hotels. Sun Butler has been helpful throughout the whole process since we checked in, and helped us arrange a room on a higher floor. Although it has a side sea view, half of Haitang Bay can be seen, and the view is very nice. The hotel service response is very fast and the feedback is timely. The hotel staff answers all questions and has a friendly attitude. My family is very satisfied. Unexpectedly, before check-out on the last day, Sun Housekeeper took the initiative to contact us without us asking, considering that we had two children, and extended our check-out by 2 hours during the prime time of the Mid-Autumn Festival. We played more calmly and made our itinerary more comfortably. Thank you so much🙏🙏, just visiting Atlantis is worth yyds. I will definitely come here next time I go to Haitang Bay.
Free unlimited entry to Atlantis Water World and Aquarium during your stay at the hotel and before 15:00 on the day of check-out👍. Adults and children at Water World had a lot of fun. We were lucky and basically didn’t queue up for a day and a half. , all items have been brushed several times. Compared to the 258/piece of Dichuang Speedy Light Wheel photos, give it a try and get the Poseidon Leap video at 79/piece which is simply a reasonable price. Fortunately, we also caught up with the Mid-Autumn Festival water curtain show + light show + fireworks show. The fireworks show is very unique. It is no exaggeration to say that it is one of the most beautiful fireworks shows I have ever seen. When leaving, the children all said they would come back next time, so go home and work hard to move bricks to satisfy them🤣🤣🤣
Atlantis Hotel is one of the popular hotels in Haitang Bay, and with the Water World open to the public, there are indeed a lot of people in the hotel, and the breakfast is also very popular. However, we did not encounter the problem of queuing for breakfast. Although there were a lot of people, hotel staff guided them to their seats. The breakfast choices were rich and the taste was acceptable. It is worth mentioning that the hotel’s breakfast dining time is 7:00-14:00, which is full. It reflects the positioning of a top resort hotel and provides flexibility to hotel guests. This must be praised 👍.
Overall, Atlantis gave us a good start to our vacation. We were very satisfied with every aspect during our stay. We would like to thank Atlantis Hotel and Sun Butler for the warm service they provided us. We look forward to seeing you again next time. ! ! !

The front desk tried its best to arrange a high-floor location as required. , the room could not be checked in, so I went to the water park first, and later I saw that I could enter the room after sending a text message at 13:30. It was OK during the National Day Golden Week. The housekeeper Mengmeng answered all my questions. After I made my request, I applied for a 2-hour delay in check-out. After check-out, I was unable to enter the aquarium and helped us apply for a temporary entry card in time. I also gave the children a sea animal doll.

The water world and the aquarium are actually very small, the lobby environment is relatively noisy, and there is no service. The delivered fruits are grapes and pomegranates, would you like to ask me how to open them with bare hands? The 388 or 398 buffet is really too low. The shrimp is limited to one serving, and there is nothing else to eat. It is not as good as the 100-plus buffet, which is too bad.

msg:Stayed at Yate for one night. Because there were many guests in the hotel, I checked in at around 10 o'clock in the morning and got the room card to go to the water world or aquarium. I received the information that I could check in at around 12 o'clock, and the hotel housekeeper Davis added WeChat immediately. If you have any questions during your stay, you can find him at any time. His service is warm and friendly. Because it happened to be his birthday, the hotel also thoughtfully prepared birthday cakes and welcome fruits, which can be seen from the downstairs of the room. The hotel has a panoramic view of the exterior and a side sea view. There are also some duty-free shops and some shops to visit in the hotel. The rooms are equipped with children's supplies. It is recommended for families or couples traveling. The disadvantage is that the sound insulation is a bit poor. I hope it can be improved. You can basically stay in Yate without leaving the hotel, so it is quite suitable for vacation and leisure.

msg:Since the epidemic, it feels like the services and dishes (breakfast or buffets) of Chinese hotels have declined. Atlantis gave me a whole new experience. The breakfast buffet is good and you can feel the good ingredients. The service is really good, attentive and considerate. When we went out for a while, the room was immediately tidied up, and they even asked us if there was anything we needed to add or do. What deserves special praise is our housekeeper Clara (Qiqi). She contacted us promptly and professionally after we checked in, and gave a professional and comprehensive introduction to the hotel's many interesting contents. I said we need to make tea, right away They thoughtfully sent us a tea set and 12 bottles of water, as well as daily fruit platters, souvenir gifts for the children... I am very satisfied. A very wonderful vacation time!

msg:Sanya, which I haven’t seen for a long time, I miss it very much. From the mentality point of view, I went there for fame at the beginning, and at the end of the summer vacation, I always felt that I had to go to the beach. There were so many people arriving at the hotel, the room was full every day, and I felt the fame of Atlantis. It is really not to be underestimated. The processing speed and service instructions at the front desk are very fast and meticulous. They also kindly reminded us that the afternoon tea has just started, so we can put down our luggage and go to the dining place to refresh our fatigue, which made me feel relaxed after running around. After quickly completing the procedures, a little brother came to take us upstairs. The room was clean, tidy and spacious, with complete facilities and thoughtful supplies, and the comfort was naturally very high. It is particularly worth mentioning that just after checking in, I received a call from Jenny, the housekeeper. The voice was sweet and gentle. She welcomed us to check in and provided a lot of project introductions. Due to my personal needs, I wanted to know about the hotel's several types of suites, and she was very patient. They gave me a detailed introduction and sent pictures and videos. I feel that they should be very busy every day, but they still reply very quickly. The chats are kind and natural, just like friends, and they instantly shorten the distance with the guests. This impresses me excellent! Because I am timid, I was discouraged by many facilities in the water world. It was very pleasant to raft for three laps. The children had a great time. The lifeguards in the water world are so cute. When guiding tourists, they even sang dinosaurs against wolves, haha Ha ha. It is also worth mentioning that the visit to the Lost Space Aquarium included in the hotel package was not taken seriously, but I was shocked when I entered! The design is novel, the management is in place, and the display is beautiful and eye-catching, especially the huge aquarium that is grounded to the sky shocked me! So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful! The soul exhausted by the secular world instantly found a paradise! It's a pity that I went a little late and didn't have time to experience the diving project. It's a pity! But this is the reason for my second brush! I watched the C show in the evening, hey, the dance beauty, makeup, and professionalism of the actors are pretty good, especially the lead actor who played the prince, all kinds of difficult performances made the audience scream, hahaha, you must come to Atlantis Go check it out! Must review the buffet again! Because I live on the 48th floor, breakfast, afternoon tea, and happy hour for dinner are served at the restaurant on the 48th floor. It is so convenient, so I don’t have the breakfast experience of saffron and colorful crystals on the G floor, but given that the hotel is full, it is better not to go Yes, I think, hahahaha. However, although the restaurant on the 48th floor is not as big as the downstairs (it is estimated that it is set up according to the executive lounge, it is called the Royal Club here, and you need to book the corresponding room type to enjoy it), but it is full of boutiques, and the variety of each meal is obvious. The meals are very exquisite, and there is no make-up meal at all, especially the weekend dinner, which is really amazing, very, very delicious, and the food really reflects the hotel standard! All the service staff in the entire hotel are professional, thoughtful, kind, and meticulous. After cleaning the room, there will be a special return visit. The appeals made by calling the service center are resolved very quickly. It is indeed a home away from home. I must praise 👍 I must mention the housekeeper Jenny, who took the initiative Introduced the characteristics of each restaurant and the peak dining hours, which made me calmly make a choice, so that I can eat well and have enough time for leisure and entertainment. The reminders and services that appeared in a timely manner made me much more convenient and increased my appreciation. The hotel's impression points, the style of the water world didn't impress me too much, but the hotel's service conquered me, tell Jenny, see you next time in Atlantis!

Hygiene: Pretty clean and tidy, nothing special.
It’s what a four- or five-star hotel should look like.
Service: After entering the hotel, the baby fell asleep. The lobby staff immediately took him to the VIP room for quick check-in, and immediately arranged a butler. The housekeeper Xiao Ruan was very considerate and responded quickly. He prepared a small gift for the baby the day before check-out.

It’s really not as overwhelming as what is said online. I will come back next time. Although the water world rafting is not very novel, you can try it out. There is a mini shopping street and food court downstairs. There is a supermarket, which is suitable for families to stay for two or three days. Lazy people who leave the hotel can take care of their children directly. There is also child care, but they need to be over four years old. It seems that there are endless advantages and disadvantages. I haven’t discovered it yet. We are not in a hurry to play and avoid holidays. It is really leisurely. No need to queue

The children in Water World had a lot of fun, the beach sea breeze is not too hot, and the check-in to luggage storage process is smooth. , thank you butler Davis for your attentive service, from the fruit plate after check-in to the bus reservation and the dolphin doll for the children... the overall check-in process was very comfortable.

Hygiene: There is a housekeeper in each room. You can tell the housekeeper when you need to clean. It is very considerate.
Environment: There are various shopping malls and aquariums downstairs, and there is a water world next to it. You can stay in the hotel without leaving.
Service: Sally’s butler service is very good and friendly. She helped us carry our luggage all the way. We are very grateful. She can also help us solve the problem at any time when we check out. We don’t have to go to the front desk to talk to Sally. I put the room card in the room and can check out quickly. Overall experience so far best hotel
Unlimited access to the Water World Aquarium for 2 adults and 2 adults: It is recommended to go to the aquarium when registering for the room card. Although the room has not been arranged, you can start playing after recording your face. You can play while you wait. We actually entered the aquarium three times a day. We swam in the morning without being exposed to the sun or getting too hot. We had a full meal in the afternoon before playing. In the evening we participated in the Pink Night and took our children to watch the drone show, fireworks and Xingna water curtain show. It was so worth it.
Royal Club Buffet Afternoon Tea: Not only afternoon tea, but also happy hour and all-day soft drinks. Don’t be stingy with a few hundred dollars. Be sure to upgrade to the Royal Club or Atlanta Club. You will definitely get back your meal for the day. No. After leaving the hotel, you can always have fun and have food and drink at any time. I stayed for three days and two nights, three adults and one child. We all ate and drank in the hotel. I was not tired and had a great time.

As the name suggests, Sun Butler arranged everything for us clearly like a little sun. Before leaving, they even took the initiative to arrange a late check-out, giving us enough time, which was very considerate!

Breakfast is delayed until 14 o'clock, which is really suitable for those who sleep in. The service of the butler Xiao Ruan is also very considerate. I am most satisfied with this stay. It’s Xiao Ruan! The basic requirements are met, it is hygienic and clean, and the most convenient thing is that you can enjoy the water world and aquarium. You can choose 5 free photos from the travel photos provided. If you want all the photos, you can pack them for 298, which is not expensive and the photos taken are pretty good!

msg:Atlantis is the first stop of this trip, and it is also the highlight of the trip to Sanya that the children are looking forward to. Before departure, the housekeeper Amy contacted us to inquire about our travel needs, and also gave us thoughtful tips and provided the information we needed. Everything is in place.
When we landed in Sanya, Amy had arranged a room for us in advance, installed bed rails, and given us welcome fruits. When we entered the room, the air was fresh and the temperature and humidity were appropriate. I felt that the hotel's facilities and room service were very attentive.
One thing to say, the room is large. Although the order description is 48 square meters, the sea view room is spacious and transparent, and it feels like a 60 square meter room. All public areas are also very spacious, so even though there are many guests, it doesn't feel crowded.
The breakfast is very good, especially the brunch setting. It is very friendly to families with children who like to sleep in. You can get up and go to the aquarium to watch the show first, and then go to eat at your leisure after 11 o'clock. There are restaurants in the hotel, and the prices are relatively high. This setting just saves money on a meal, and it is very leisurely and leisurely.
The check-in and check-out procedures were very fast. The staff in all depar**ents of the hotel are very kind and friendly. The service quality is very good. There is no irritability like other tourist attraction hotels. The housekeeper Amy is even more considerate. As the holidays are approaching, she also gives small dolls to the children. , they sent moon cakes again, and also helped us delay check-out, allowing us to arrange our departure calmly. Thank you very much🙏
Regarding travel, the room comes with unlimited visits to Water World and Aquarium during the stay. This arrangement is generous and considerate, so that we can go back and forth as we like during the three days and two nights of our stay (the disadvantage is that we need to prepare one or two more swimsuits) , other hotels with amusement parks should also learn from it. The price is not beyond their reach, so why bother with the price.
In Water World, many activities are limited to 122cm. Our children are just close to the height limit, so they are faced with the situation that they cannot enter with wet hair, but can enter with dry hair. Fortunately, the children are timid and do not insist on playing the activities, causing The wave pool can satisfy him.
The aquarium is not big, so two hours is enough to see the whole thing and watch the show. It can be used as an option for children to take a walk after a meal.
The hotel swimming pool is quite large and there are enough, so it will not be crowded at all. You can see the swimming pool and the park view in the room, and you can also see the water curtain show in the park at night, and you can see the sea view in the morning, so you won't feel lonely all day long.
I am very satisfied with this trip and I look forward to making arrangements next time I come to Sanya!

As soon as I got the room card, the housekeeper, Judy Shao, gave me a phone call and added WeChat. During my two-night stay, I will keep caring about my experience and what I need! It is worthy of praise👍The children's water world fast track has played every item many times, and the C show performances and so on are very enjoyable! To be blunt is not enough 😂 The hotel’s breakfast is very rich and I just experienced two different restaurants in two days, both of which are very good! There are many restaurants in the hotel at noon and evening. The "Songhelou" restaurant is really delicious. The two children love the baked lobster with cheese! The little friends will come to play during the winter vacation...

The reason why it has become an internet celebrity🍹 and a household name is also because hotel guests can freely enter the spectacular water world, play with dragons and watch shocking performances. The beautiful aquarium and its mermaid are also loved by children💞
The Royal Club is the highlight of the hotel. It provides meals 24 hours a day, so guests have no worries. The meals in the club are not many, but they are quite exquisite. What’s more, the environment is beautiful and you can slowly enjoy the food while watching the sunset. One of the joys in life💞

msg:The experience is very poor and the price/performance ratio is low. The most expensive hotel in this trip to Sanya has the worst service. Other hotels provide butler service on the same day or in advance, but this hotel only added it after one day of stay (maybe it was because I complained about the noise). What's strange is that on the first night of my stay, it was past ten o'clock and there was continuous loud rock music coming from the so-called specialty music restaurant. Moreover, the sound insulation effect of the room was very poor, making it impossible to sleep. The hotel facilities look relatively new, but they don't match the price. There are no smart appliances. The old toilet flushes loudly. The Philips hair dryer and TV are quite small. I'm allergic to bath salts after using them. I don't know why. It's not that it's gone bad. The aquarium is small and exquisite, and the water world is also good. However, there are no discounts for hotel guests. They queue up with tourists who buy tickets. If you want to play during holidays, it is recommended to stay in a slightly lower-priced hotel nearby and use the money saved to buy fast lanes. The gaming experience will be greatly improved.

Our family of three is very well-off, and the breakfast is very rich, and we can eat until 14:00 in the afternoon (the time is too generous [Victory]). Even if there are many people in the summer, the arrangements are tight and organized . The housekeeper Zara He's service is very considerate and considerate. Even with so many guests, the room cleaning arrangement is very timely. When returning to the room with a tired body after playing every day, the clean and tidy environment and the blue sea of ​​thousands of years are what you see when you open the door. Our room includes tickets to the water world and the aquarium, with unlimited access, so that children who like to play with water will have enough fun. Fortunately, there will be small light shows and fireworks shows on weekends. The starlight restaurant in the hotel is also very good. The dustpan chicken set meal at 299 is enough for our family of three. It is really worth it for a five-star hotel to have such a cheap and full-bodied meal. Thank you Atlantis for letting us spend it A great and memorable holiday!

You can freely enter the hotel pool and the adjacent water world as many times as you like. We played in the lazy river every day. The sea is also private, so there are no hygiene issues. There is also a small convenience store and Japanese food, making it perfect for families with children.
Mr. Baishuo, the person in charge at the hotel, is helpful with information. Of course, Japanese is OK. It was a hotel that I would like to visit again.

This time, my butler is called jojo ~ He is really enthusiastic and positive. It makes you feel very safe when you check in. He does a great job of answering all questions every time ~ Taking an elderly person out to sleep on a soft bed is not used to it , changed to a hard bed and buckwheat pillow~ Also, I complained about how the hotel is so big and there is no sightseeing car, only a pick-up parking lot, which is a bit unfriendly~ How come a hotel that costs more than 2500 per night does not even have a smart toilet? The sound insulation outside the door is also a bit poor~ I hope the hardware facilities can be improved~ There are too many people on weekends. The water, wood and fire show are too shocking and cannot be missed. It is just that the crowd is too crowded [frown] which affects the viewing effect

msg:I came to Sanya during this National Day and chose the Atlantis Hotel for the first two days, with the purpose of enjoying the water world. Every time I came here before, my children were not satisfied with playing for two full days. This time, maybe because they are older (12 years old), after playing for a day and repeatedly completing several key projects, they no longer want to play. The advantages and disadvantages of the hotel are obvious. The advantage is that there is a water world. The drone water curtain show at night is very beautiful and there is a big fish tank. The disadvantages are that the room rate is very expensive and the breakfast is mediocre. The hotel also adopts a butler system. Qiqi is our butler. She introduced us to all the fun activities in the hotel and is very responsible.

In addition, just from the hotel's perspective, the services and facilities are satisfactory.
In terms of dining, Starlight Food’s Hainanese chicken set meal is also highly recommended. The chicken is not bad at all and all the food is surprisingly delicious.
During our stay in the hotel, the housekeeper Amy Xiaoxin who provided us with services was very nice and made our family have a great travel experience.
Finally, I would like to say that the interactive projects for dolphins and beluga whales are very good, which makes up for the regret that children could not interact with dolphins up close in Singapore. To be very objective, Atlantis beats Chimelong and is comparable to Ocean World in Singapore.

There will be much fewer people, especially when you enter the park in the morning. There are obviously fewer people. It is so fun to ride the roller coasters together.
The hotel service is super good, the breakfast is rich, the aunt is also friendly, and the housekeeper Xiaobai responds quickly, and I like it manually when I ask.
The fireworks show on the Mid-Autumn Festival night is amazing, a very good memory, and I will come back again if I have the chance.
According to the front desk, if there are two adults and two children, and the children are under 12 years old, the club room is particularly suitable. It seems to include three meals.

msg:I have always wanted to go to Sanya for vacation. This month is considered the off-season. After seeing that the air tickets are suitable, I want to try Atlantis, which has always been growing. Although many people complained about the lack of service staff when doing the guide and couldn't keep up, the two of us traveled at different times and felt that it was okay. Arrived around 12:30, check-in and luggage storage were very fast. After recording the facial recognition, we stopped by the aquarium to check out the aquarium. Since it was a mermaid show these days, it was a pity that we did not see the mermaid show that afternoon. However, when we were almost finished shopping, we met a group of mermaids who came to take pictures and videos in the water. The collective parade was beautiful. There was also a car tourer who came to say hello to us, happy (≧∇≦)/
When booking a hotel, we made a note that we wanted a high floor. When we checked in, we were assigned a king-size room on the 45th floor. The room faced the villa area, but we could see a very beautiful coastline. The beach belonged to the public beach of this five-star hotel. I took enough photos of the hotel where I stayed for a few days and didn’t go there.
The facilities in the room are basically all available. The room is equipped with bath salts, children's slippers and toiletries. Although we didn't use it, we felt that it was fully considered for children. For adults, the tea bar is very complete, and soft drinks can be replenished, which can fully meet your needs. You can also ask room service to bring some ice cubes. The big table is very big, and the takeout we ordered is placed there, which is perfect for dining.
Although many people complained about the hotel's breakfast buffet, it was overcrowded, but I actually thought it was okay when I went to eat it. There are reserved seating signs in different areas and the dishes will not be taken away. It is solved after taking them and eating them together. The key is to avoid peak seasons.
The overall experience was quite relaxing and fun. My butler Davis took the initiative to join me after I checked in and introduced me to various hotel services, dining times, facilities and features, etc. The mysterious gift was also super cute😊

Service: The most satisfactory thing is the service. It is said that only the suites have butlers, but the two Royal Clubs arranged a butler for five days. The butler was Jailene, a lovely, gentle and caring young lady. Whether it was playing or dining, Arrangements for things like travel, room hygiene, fruits, and fences for children are all in place. Almost everything is answered, and you can't find any faults.
Who said Yate's service is not good during holidays? I am the first one to stand up and object! ! !
Facilities: There are a lot of things to play. It’s no problem to bring your baby to stay in the hotel for a week. Xiaobao has such a great time that he doesn’t want to leave when it gets dark every time he plays.
Hygiene: The cleaning was very clean. All the drinks in the cabinet were taken out if they didn't want to be drunk with ice. They were placed on the table and they were not drunk, but not only were they not taken away, but the freezer was replenished hahaha.
Environment: As we all know, you must stay at Yate once when you come to Sanya, so the large number of people is inevitable. Apart from the large number of people and the fact that the accommodation does not include dinner, there is nothing to fault.

This hotel is particularly friendly to parents and children. It actively helps to store luggage after check-out, which is very convenient. It can also take the children to play for a whole day. The children are very happy and want to play. Atlantis has become the best memory of this trip to Sanya.
It's a pity that we can only stay for 2 days this time. The whole family is reluctant to leave. I will definitely stay for a few more days next time I have the opportunity.
I would like to express my special thanks to Davis, the butler, who answered every question during my stay. It was very nice.

We just came to Sanya after playing Disney and felt that the fireworks here are not inferior to Disney. Thank you! All our needs are met here! There are lifeguards at the hotel swimming pool and water world all the time. There are several people in one swimming pool who are very responsible and parents can feel at ease. It was my first time staying in a hotel and I felt reluctant to leave. I also hope that more attention will be paid to hygiene. The wash cup is not very clean, there are hairs in the bedside lamp slot, and I don’t know if the carpet is gray or needs to be cleaned. I personally care about hygiene, but other than these, I have done a great job. It is recommended that everyone come and experience it if you have the opportunity.

msg:This is my first time staying at Atlantis, and I have to praise the attentive and considerate service provided by housekeeper Xiaoyan during this trip. She really responded to every request.
We didn't have lunch on the first day of our stay. They took us upstairs to have lunch before the room was ready and gave us a detailed introduction to the hotel. We were also given generous welcome fruits on the same day. They care about our experience every day and proactively ask about our needs. I had a stomachache when I checked in. Xiaoyan asked the kitchen to specially cook brown sugar and ginger tea. It was really heart-warming. My husband likes to drink tea. Xiaoyan asked her colleagues to bring more tea bags and mineral water for my husband to make tea. My husband said Biluochun smells very good, haha. The toiletries in the room smelled good and were easy to use. Xiaoyan also asked her colleagues in the housekeeping depar**ent to bring me some more. It will also promptly remind me of the performance time of the hotel's water world.
The hotel rooms are clean and bright, and the housekeeping depar**ent has done a good job of cleaning and disinfection. It looks reassuring! Unlimited access to the aquarium is really convenient! I want to see the white whale every day!
I stayed here for three days. Thanks to the housekeeper Xiaoyan, I gave this stay a 💯➕. My husband and I were very satisfied! Looking forward to seeing you next time!
On the first day of my stay, I bought Aniya from the Bubble Mart downstairs in the hotel, which has been out of stock for a long time, and even got a hidden item in the end box! What a lucky day indeed!

Moon (Xiao Huang) was super enthusiastic and specially sent fruits and other items to the children.

The next day I checked in to the water world, and the children didn't want to leave after playing. It seems that the three days and two nights booked are not enough, and several items have not been played yet! When checking out on the third day, Xiaoyan also gave a pink white whale as a gift, saying that the pink white whale represents luck, the children are very happy, and will come again in the future!

The hotel rooms are generally very clean, some facilities are relatively old, but it does not affect the use, and the children's toiletries are well arranged.
The only downside is that there is no separate washing machine and dryer in the room. For children who come to Yate to play in the water, clothes are not enough to change. It is hoped that Yate will operate, and the upgrade of supporting facilities can be considered in the later stage.
Another thing to praise is the TV TV movie service. Although there are not many movies, the Marvel series movies are free to watch, and the movie source can be further improved.
Finally, I would like to thank our housekeeper Amy, the service is very good, and I will answer and help you if you have any requests. I am also very grateful to every service staff who serve us. very enthusiastic. Yate is still worth it.
Thank you Amy for giving our children and my big friend gift dolls at the end, thank you! !

No dolls, no small figures. 😂The Royal Club sea view room is great, and I got a little white whale doll when I checked in. In fact, I can't finish playing in one day. The time I came this time was too tight. Check-in and check-out will be helped by the hotel butler. Thank you butler Leif. There are still many items in the water world that have not been played, and I hope it will not be too long to come back next time. To Hainan Island, if you are traveling by car, the ferry from Xuwengang* to Xinhaigang* is on time, and the ferry time is about 90 minutes (to get to Xinhaigang, you need to drive from Haikou to Sanya). It is also good that Atlantis can also enter the water world and water aquarium with facial recognition before 15:00 the next day.

msg:Atlantis is simply one of the best hotels in Sanya
The Royal Club room I stayed in this time was destined to be noble from the moment I checked in. There is a dedicated Royal Club VIP room for check-in, which can save you the time of waiting in line at the front desk.
This time it included three meals a day, all on the 48th floor of the hotel. I didn’t have high hopes at first. Later, I discovered that there were swimming crabs, barbecued pork, spicy chicken, lamb chops, beef, salmon and other kinds of food. And there were not many people dining there. It was an amazing experience.
The room configuration is very advanced. When you open the door, the power is on and when you close the door, the power is off.
The water world and aquarium are also open to hotel guests for unlimited access. The aquarium is very small and can be visited in about ten minutes. In the water world, we did a shark crossing, which was quite fun.
The housekeeper Cherry is also very enthusiastic and responds to almost every request. She even gave the children Art's little dolphin as a gift after check-out, which is also thoughtful.

msg:Atlantis really deserves its reputation. I originally thought that three days would be enough to play, but I didn't expect it to be far from enough.
Let me talk about the room first. There are two 1.5-meter-large beds in the room, which are enough for two adults and two children to sleep without being crowded. The room prepares more than a dozen bottles of mineral water and free mini bar drinks every day, a capsule coffee machine, and the bath amenities are avaha, an Israeli brand. , except the toilet is not smart, others are very satisfied
In addition, let’s talk about food and beverages, because the reservation is a club room, and the free afternoon tea and happy hour are both in the form of self-service. The only difference between the two is that there is more meat in the happy hour, that is, beef and lamb chops and German sausages. In this way, one day Basically, there is no need to spend. After the brunch, the afternoon tea and the happy hour are ready for the dinner. I wanted to try a Chinese and Western restaurant, but I couldn’t eat it anymore, so I had to give up. I look forward to trying again next time.
As for the items to play, there are three outdoor swimming pools in the hotel. If you don’t want to play in the water park, you can enjoy soaking in the pool. Since the water park is open to the public, although it is large, there are queues for popular items, and the experience is not the best. Okay, but it is very conscientious to put 15 minutes of waves in the wave pool every 15 minutes. It takes longer than other water worlds. You basically don’t have to wait deliberately. This is worthy of praise. The water curtain show at night is very good, children After reading it, I would like to come again😂. There is a beach in front of the hotel. Children who like to play with sand can play for half a day, but it is too hot, and it is not affiliated with the beach of the hotel, so there are no sun loungers and awnings. If you are indoors, you can go to the aquarium. Although it is not big, you can also take a look around. Children should like it more
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Xiaobai for providing a lot of services and providing us with various useful information every day. I hope we have a good time in the hotel. When we parted, we also gave the children a little dolphin as a gift. In short, we spent a very perfect four days in the hotel three nights

Children like to watch the bubble show and water curtain show. The hotel’s exclusive beach is beautiful and very close to the hotel. Playing on sand waves is a favorite among children.
The hotel rooms can see the beach, and the sunrise and sunset are beautiful. The dedicated butler JoJo has a very good service attitude and is very considerate. She prepared bed covers and children's supplies for the children in advance. She also sent specific service items and instructions provided by the hotel through WeChat, and gave thoughtful greetings every day. The housekeeping staff cleans the room on time every day, arranges toiletries and cosmetics in categories, and provides laundry detergent and extra hangers when they see the washed clothes. They are attentive and considerate.
When going to the duty-free shop and the airport, the hotel provides free pick-up and drop-off by bus. The butler JoJo was very helpful in making reservations and gave the children plush toys when leaving the hotel. This trip was very enjoyable and highly recommended!

I was so lucky that I was upgraded to a luxurious sea view suite, with a super large living room and a 270-degree sea view, the water world, Haitang Bay, including the Yanlord Crown on the north side, all at a glance. The Water World project is especially suitable for children. For three days and two nights, each project has been done N times. The poor old father accompanied him. Not only were his old arms and legs conservatively ravaged, he was also forced to experience the soaring blood pressure of the Sea God's Leap. In short, Atlantis is especially suitable for traveling with treasures. Living in a hotel is much more convenient than buying tickets elsewhere to play in the water world. You can go back and rest at any time, and you can go in again at any time. It is recommended that you stay in the water world as much as possible. in Atlantis. Finally, I would like to thank Ms. Mumu, the hotel housekeeper, for her thoughtfulness. Not only did she clearly introduce the various matters of the hotel, but also the various projects and activities of the water world are arranged very meticulously. She also gave the children dolls. The baby is happy Unbelievable, thank you Ms. Mumu, I will definitely choose Atlantis next time~

Because I am traveling with family and friends, I booked three rooms... The first thing I experienced during my stay this time was the housekeeper ina The service, the enthusiasm of this sweet little sister on the day of check-in made me feel more cordial, and the exquisite and comfortable service during the stay made me have good memories of this hotel and a full sense of repurchase...The hotel's breakfast is rich, It is convenient to visit and shop around. The aquarium is suitable for taking children to see the underwater world that they have never seen before. The water world park is super fun. Check out Poseidon's Leap and give it a try. It is really exciting and thrilling. The taste is endless... What happened to my friend in the middle The little incident was handled with ease by the beautiful housekeeper Ina, who handled it decisively, quickly and efficiently...I was so moved that I fell in love with this hotel and this beautiful housekeeper Ina very much...I will come back next time, see you at Chris**as...🥰🥰

msg:As an internet celebrity hotel, Yate has a complete set of facilities. The aquarium and water world are suitable for family fun. The aquarium and infinity pool are really holy places for internet celebrities to check in. The restaurants in the hotel also have their own characteristics. There are rich varieties of breakfast. Play is top notch. But Yate’s room experience is a bit poor, the balcony is small, there are no deck chairs, and except for the suites, they all look at the sea at 45 degrees. That is, if you enter the venue half an hour in advance, you still have to queue up with non-residents most of the time. If you live in Yate purely for playing in the water world, the price/performance ratio is really not high. The housekeeper, Xiaohao, is enthusiastic and responsive, and carefully prepared gifts for the children👍👍

Unfortunately, there was light rain and there were no fireworks. There were also some minor problems in the hotel. I communicated with the housekeeper Cherry in time for breakfast. It's pretty good and abundant. The kids had a lot of fun. I'd like to give you a satisfactory review. There weren't many people in the off-season. Overall, the trip was pretty good.

msg:It was the first time I stayed in Yate, and I was a little hesitant when I saw a lot of complaints on the Internet. But the actual check-in experience was great. Entering the front desk of the lobby, check-in was very fast, and there was no waiting in line. Because I ordered the courtesy of the Royal Club, I don’t have to worry about eating and drinking all day long. It can be said that I eat from morning to night. The taste and scenery of the afternoon tea on the 48th floor are absolutely perfect. It was already nine o'clock for dinner when we came back from the water world, so we went directly to Songhe Tower. The dishes were very exquisite and delicious. The key point is to thank the butler Leif, a handsome, stylish, warm and caring young man, who handles every detail in a timely and delicate manner, and all kinds of reminder services are in place. He even upgraded us to a super-large suite for free and gave us a cute pink whale doll , all kinds of happiness, big and small! In short, this stay is a temporary itinerary, so the time is relatively limited. But the Atlantis Hotel is definitely comfortable as expected from the hardware but the software, and it is an unexpected surprise. I sincerely recommend everyone to come for a vacation! Looking forward to revisiting the old place next time, see you there!

msg:We were initially given a sea view room on the 29th floor. It was on the inside and could only see half of the coastline. (I should mention here that the sea view rooms in Yate can only see half of the sea, not directly facing the sea. Rooms facing the sea are very expensive. ), and later negotiated with the housekeeper to change to a room on the 46th floor with a view of the outside. Although the area is a little smaller, the view is much better. When lying on the bed, you can basically see the entire sea outside the window. I would like to express my special thanks to the housekeeper "Xiao Ruan" for his warm and thoughtful attitude. , daily hotel activities include the aquarium, water world and C show. We are clearly informed and reminded of where is suitable for taking pictures and where is suitable for girls to play.
There are two more points that I am particularly dissatisfied with. 1. The hotel does not have an underground parking lot, but only two above-ground parking lots. It is windy, rainy, and the sun is very strong. Friends who come here for the first time have to carry their luggage to the hotel after parking the car. The lobby is about 300 meters away. Personally, I think the hotel should arrange shuttle buses to shuttle guests between the lobby and the parking lot continuously.
2. There is a large villa area downstairs of the hotel that is being renovated. It is very noisy from 9:30 in the morning to 12 noon. If we imagine that we live on the 46th floor, we can feel the banging on the wall and the sound of electric saws next door. .
Fortunately we only stayed one night

Highlights - Butler: The most moving and warmest thing here is that every family has a butler who can communicate and answer questions from time to time. Our butler is Ms. Mu Mu, who provides professional service, answers questions patiently and meticulously, and will help us to participate in every detail The itinerary is very clear and efficient. From the moment we checked in, our family was touched by surprises. I like this hotel so much, I don't have any worries, and I feel full of security.
Highlights-Safety: There are safety lifeguards in swimming pools, beaches, and water worlds, reminding parents to take care of children at any time, and timely reminding tourists who do dangerous actions.
Highlights - Catering: Breakfast 7-11 o'clock. Room minibar free. The water world has a self-service barbecue and snacks, which are very delicious.
Highlights-hidden items: Dolphin Island sea lion interaction, dolphin snorkeling. Awesome! Give Coach Fu a thumbs up! Professional and patient! A sense of security!
Highlights-Shuttle bus: airport bus to and from, duty-free shop bus to and from.
A little suggestion: Can you put a small swimsuit dryer that scans the code on each balcony, each floor, or a fixed location in the hotel? There are many water sports in the hotel, and the guests staying in the hotel on the last day of the trip will not leave any regrets. Participate in a water activity, shake it and dry it in the sun, which will add points to the trip.

1. The scenery of the hotel is very pleasant, the quality of the royal restaurant is good, the aquarium is very beautiful, the water world and the beach are all near the hotel, within walking distance, children and adults like it very much!
2. Xiao Yuan, the housekeeper, is very caring. He considers all kinds of services and can solve the needs immediately. The service is great. When leaving the store, they also thoughtfully helped deliver the luggage to the hotel bus, and even sent a bunch of dolls to the children. Thank you for your hard work!
3. There is a commercial street in the hotel, and the price of goods is relatively close to the people, which is convenient.
2. Insufficiency:
1. There are problems with the table lamp, toilet handle, and refrigerator in the room. Although the housekeeper can solve them very well at the first time, it is not appropriate for Seven Star Hotel to have these problems. The ward round needs to be more careful;
2. The shooting of the hotel is a little less professional, such a good scene is a pity.
3. Suggestions:
1. The closing time of the aquarium is recommended to be later. 19:30 is usually when I go to play after dinner, but unfortunately the park is closed.

Show C was temporarily arranged that day and it rained, so the plan was messed up. Fortunately, we were told that the Water World could enter at 9:30, so the trip went smoothly. This is what we I have seen the cleanest, most standardized, and least crowded water world. The equipment is very new, very interesting, slightly stimulating, very suitable for children's appetite. You can touch starfish in the aquarium and see many beautiful jellyfish. I went to the beach to play for a while at night. I personally think that the sand in *****long Bay in Haitang Bay is finer and smoother. Nature is so beautiful, it should be cherished [smile]

I was a little apprehensive before I came, because I read online reviews saying that this is not good and that is not good, but I felt different services on the first day of my stay. I think this room It's expensive but worth it. The housekeeper Moon (Xiao Huang) has provided meticulous service from the moment I checked in, which made me feel at home. I gave Little Huang a big 👍. To be honest, there are quite a lot of people in time for the summer vacation, and there are queues for water sports. It takes about an hour. It is recommended to buy a VIP to save the queue. The weekend water show and fireworks show are worth seeing. The aquarium sees different fish. I also like the two big beluga whales the most. We booked with meals , the food is okay, mainly we don’t have high requirements for food 😀 The first stop ended perfectly

    Secondly, I booked Hengren Crown last year. When I was in Yalong Bay, a driver said that Yate’s service was not good. I often heard complaints from customers, which made me dare not book Yate. It turns out that I have always liked the service of Ritz.
    In the end, this time I booked Yate, I did not step on the thunder at all. It can only be said that the value for money is very high. Furthermore, the butler Leif's service is very considerate, making this parent-child trip more comfortable, and it is the best choice for bringing children to Haitang Bay in the future. The scenery is good, it is convenient for children to play, and the service is good (every service staff encountered can serve with a smile, and they are very active and enthusiastic in service, and the needs of passengers will be resolved as soon as possible). Recommended, recommended to stay in the high-rise, the room type of the Royal Club is sincerely recommended.
    It is very convenient to go to the duty-free shop, which is convenient for shopping. In the evening, it is much cheaper to eat seafood food stalls nearby than Bialong Bay Dongrong.

The Royal Club room I chose was a great value. I didn’t even try the three Royal Club dinners and drinks. The dim sum beef was so delicious. There are also various drinks and drinks. The housekeeper arranged a room facing the playground. The two kids liked it. They also gave them small pets. The babies were so happy that they slept in their arms. The restaurant on the G floor can be opened at 2 o'clock the next day. It ended before 3 o'clock, and you could enter the amu*****t park before 3 o'clock. After two full days of playing, I was so tired that I slept in the rafting pool for two afternoons. I support being able to play until the park closes at 9 o'clock. I am so happy. I must visit Sanya. When I came to Yate, I once again felt that the housekeeper Maggie was so considerate!

There were staff members to handle luggage storage, and there was no long queue for check-in. Then I went to the aquarium. By 12 o'clock, I received the information from the housekeeper [Terry Xiaoxu] that I can get the room card to check in, and arranged a high floor according to the previous reservation requirements. The room is very comfortable and the sea view is beautiful. When I was playing in the water world in the afternoon, I received a WeChat message from the housekeeper Xiao Xu, recommending various activities and play suggestions in the water world. In the evening, I thoughtfully arranged and sent a small gift for check-in. I decisively bought a fast-track ticket when I was playing. Except for giving it a go, I didn’t dare to play. I played every other event more than once. I took my son to play the big horn four times, the octopus race four times, the raging sea roller coaster four times, and the Poseidon three times. Leap... really worth it. Let's talk about the brunch on the G floor of the hotel. The food and drinks are very rich. The meal time is from 7:00 to 14:00. Because I wanted to check in the transparent swimming pool the next day, I went to take pictures at 9:00, took the children to play 4 amu*****t projects at 10:00, went back to the room to pack my luggage at 11:00, contacted the housekeeper Xiao Xu to help check out at 12:00, and then went to the restaurant After eating slowly, at 14 o'clock, I swiped my face and entered the water world, making full use of the play and rest time, and received a warm greeting from the housekeeper Xiaoxu in the evening. The whole process of check-in, play, and dining is very considerate. Next time the children are on vacation, they must stay for a few more days.

At first, I was worried that some people said in the evaluation that it was like a vegetable market, and I was afraid of chaos, but my feeling is that there are many people, but it is not chaotic. As soon as you enter, there is a joyful a**osphere. There are so many children, and they are all very happy! My second treasure is unwilling to leave.
The service here is very good👍Jiang Huaiyu from the front desk of the hotel helped us apply for breakfast and play for Dabao who just turned 12 years old. I thought it was great! Not a rigid hotel! If you are willing to help me, I am willing to spend more with you! Butler Moon's service is also quite good! The welcome fruit waiter was a little late. Moon coordinated many times and delivered a large fruit plate. I am very satisfied. I also answered all other questions. When I left, I even gave the child a small gift! The waiters here are also very polite and friendly. Although there are many people for breakfast, they all have seats. It is not chaotic at all, and the taste is also very good. Hainan's Hou'an powder is very good!
Besides, the aquarium, I think it is better than all the aquariums I have seen. Although it is small, it is very, very clean and well maintained 👍The sea animals are so cute! I watched it twice!
The water world is also amazing, but the baby is afraid to play exciting things, and I don't play many sports, it feels more suitable for older children and adults. The water screen movie and fireworks at night are great! This is what a vacation feels like!

The room was chosen to face the landscape of the water world. Watching the water curtain show and fireworks on the balcony on weekend nights is perfect! There are quite a lot of welcome fruits and minibars, I haven't eaten much, I can't finish it! Royal afternoon tea and happy hour are very convenient and filling, but the quality is average. The desserts are nice but not tasty. I hope they can be improved! For breakfast on the first floor, there are too few royal varieties, and there are many varieties downstairs, which is quite appetizing, but it is a pity that there is no sushi that children must eat. Overall good, a relatively complete complex of eating, drinking and playing. The housekeeper, Sun Yang, is also very considerate.

Here I need to give special praise to the housekeeper, Xiao Xu, for his meticulous service and careful reminders everywhere. See you next time in Sanya!

msg:It was a great experience. Before I checked in, I received a call from the housekeeper Xiao Xu. The house was not ready at 3 o'clock. The front desk immediately upgraded the room type. The sea view is great, facing the water world and the swimming pool. The housekeeper Xiao Xu gave a lot of suggestions and strategies for playing. On the second day after I checked in, I took my baby to play in the water world, but the old man was going to watch the C show, and Xiao Xu guided and accompanied him all the way to the theater to find a seat and sit down, and thoughtfully prepared drinking water. She took good care of me, a mother who takes care of both the baby and the elderly, and was so friendly. I have already planned to choose Atlantis for my next trip to Sanya. Looking forward to seeing you next time.

But fortunately, after waiting for a while, I received a reminder from the housekeeper at around 12 o'clock that the room was allocated. The service is really good. Here is my little housekeeper (Xiao Bai)
Hotel environment: The view on the 11th floor is not bad
There are two washbasins, very large, very suitable for a family of three with parents and children
Toiletries are special for children, especially close to the people
You can play in the water world by going downstairs, and you can enter and exit the water world unlimited times. Rafting is really interesting
Breakfast is divided into two halls, Chinese food and Western food
There are many dishes, very rich and delicious
I took a lot of beautiful photos from the hotel's own beach the next morning, I really like it

Arrived at the hotel after 1:00, the concierge was very friendly, basically you don’t have to take care of your luggage when you get off the bus, there is a special person responsible for storing it, and you can send it to the room directly when you come out. There are indeed a lot of people in the peak season of summer vacation, but I don't feel confused, but it is better than other hotels. I gave the room reservation card, scanned the face and went directly to the aquarium. After watching the c show, the housekeeper contacted us directly. The room was arranged on the 7th floor, but it was upgraded to the ambassador suite. The room is bigger and the view is better. It’s not bad 😊, after two days, the butler Davis introduced the event and the precautions very clearly, and answered questions in a timely manner. It’s really great!!!

The starlight food downstairs is delicious. We recommend pickled fish and lobster, and the preserved eggs are also good👍We went to eat it twice!
The hotel also has checked luggage and drop-off services, which is very considerate!
Overall, it is a hotel worth recommending! Our family had a great time 🥳
Hope to have a chance to do it again 😄 The merchant offers more discounts, except for the price, there is nothing wrong with it 😄

The hotel's package items are super value, including two breakfasts for two people and children, and one buffet lunch or dinner for two people. The hotel's water world and aquarium can be played unlimited times. The hotel will also inform you whether you want to participate in the items that require a fee. It's all up to the guest to decide
The hotel's buffet breakfast and dinner have a wide variety that should satisfy the taste buds of most guests. The only fly in the oin**ent is that the steak and lamb chops that should be eaten hot are cut in advance because the hotel is worried about guests, which will greatly reduce the taste of the steak. , looking forward to correction and improvement
Finally, thank you again for taking care of Cherry, and look forward to coming again next time

msg:I stayed in Atlantis five years ago and was shocked by the luxury of the hotel, which left me with unforgettable memories. At that time, I planned to bring my family to experience it in the future. In the first summer vacation after the epidemic, I finally fulfilled my promise and brought my family to Atlantis.
Overall feeling: five stars
transportation:
Arrived on Friday, the flight arrived at Phoenix Airport at 10 o'clock sharp, missed the hotel shuttle bus at 10 o'clock, and waited until the next bus at 11:30. Thinking of going to the beach early, I took a taxi. Online car-hailing is convenient to order a car. When you come out from the exit of the arrival floor to place an order, someone will take the order in an instant. More than 40 kilometers, driving for 40 minutes, the fare is less than 80.
check in:
The booking instructions stated that the hotel would check in at 3 pm, but when I arrived at the front desk, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the deluxe sea view twin room I booked was available and I could check in immediately. The floor was on the 40th floor. Students over the age of 14 will be charged an additional 600 yuan, including breakfast, water world and aquarium. Much more cost-effective than buying separately. This room type is very friendly for two big and two small families, and it is the most cost-effective choice.
After checking in, a beautiful young lady sent us to the room. The room type was exactly the same as the one I lived in before. It was a real revisit of the old place. I am very satisfied with the room. When I open the balcony door, I can feel what the sea and the sky are all in one color. Overlooking the water world, the entertainment facilities can be seen at a glance. The turtles and sharks swim in the aquarium. It seems that there is one more C show venue than 5 years ago.
Eat and drink:
After a little tidying up after check-in, I ate Singaporean food. The Sri Lankan blue crab and grouper were very fresh. The service attitude of the waiters is very good. From time to time, they come to ask about the dining experience and introduce the dishes. I once thought that there is a habit of tipping here, and I began to consider how much to tip. I found out later that it wasn't necessary.
After dinner, I went around the aquarium, just in time to watch the mermaid show. Although the aquarium is small, the scene setting is good, plus different interactive activities every hour, it is worth visiting. Watching the performance time in advance will help with schedule planning. I also went to the reef feeding show at 10am the next day.
After that, I went to the water world. Unfortunately, the equipment failure of the lazy river was suspended. Coupled with the strong sunlight, it took an hour to queue up for the items that dared to play, so I changed my plan to go swimming in the pool and planned to come back at night. I was a little lazy after dinner, so I changed it to come back the next morning. I thought there would be fewer people in the morning, but the queue for Shark Crossing alone was more than an hour. Considering check-out, I only played this project. This became a small regret of our trip to Atlantis.
Not all of the pools are open, but it's adequate and doesn't feel crowded. Lifeguards, bath towels and tea service are in place.
In addition, Atlantis-Starlight Gourmet, although the simple meal of 100 per capita is a bit expensive, but the taste is still good. Roasted duck and char siew double fight, I got the duck legs, which immediately made my praise for the dinner greatly increased.
The hotel buffet is rich in variety, praise.

Pity: 
The time to play in the water world is too short, and the queuing factor was not considered when planning. There is no time to shoot the free travel photos.
I want to complain about STO Express, the beach skirt I bought on Taobao in advance and sent it to the hotel. The delivery status lasted for 2 days, and I made 5 calls to remind the delivery. By the time I left Hainan, the delivery had not yet been delivered and I had to return it. The courier is slow in delivering the package, but very active in picking it up. I don't know if there are other sisters with similar experiences? If there is, this is the routine of local express delivery.
suggestion: 
There is no exhaust fan in the toilet in the room. I don’t know if it’s just mine, or all of them are useless?

msg:Full marks! Give it to every hotel service staff we met during the three days of check-in, including the floor cleaning aunt. Each of them is so friendly and gentle, making people really feel the highest state of "home away from home".
1. The lady at the front desk (sorry I only remember the single name Lin) arranged a very good floor for us, with excellent viewing effects; the check-in process is efficient, meticulous and patient❤ (no one took the opportunity to jump in line)
2. Each room is equipped with a one-to-one butler, which has an excellent sense of ceremony. This arrangement is also very convenient. The butler Maggie is named and praised for her thoughtfulness, caring, meticulousness and enthusiasm; she took the trouble to help us solve many tricky little troubles;
3. The room facilities are relatively complete (the only feeling is a pity), and regular laundry services are provided, but the room lacks a washing machine (or a self-service laundry bar). During the summer vacation, the passenger flow will tend to be tourism, family leisure travel, relatively speaking, business meetings and other forms will be less, so the laundry service provided by the hotel, including dry cleaning and ironing services, can hardly play any role. Instead, you can enjoy unlimited swimming in the water world. I have had a friendly communication with a handsome guy in charge of the floor (I don’t know if it’s the title) on this issue. I hope that I will find a surprise when I have the opportunity to stay in Yate next time.
4. The experience of the saffron cafeteria is also great. After entering the door and checking the room number, there will be a dedicated guide to find a suitable seat for us. Baby chairs, baby tableware, bibs, etc. are all available. There are all kinds of Chinese and Western meals. On the second day, I met Fu Ling, a restaurant feedback officer, who asked us about our dining experience in detail.

msg:Not recommended, the service and management are inconsistent with the prices of high-end hotels. Prices reflect the emphasis on money. There are VIP channels for water sports, swimming pool loungers are rented for a fee, and children who have just turned 12 have to pay for breakfast and tickets separately, leaving no room for negotiation. The management is also not good. The swimming pool actually feels like dumplings, and late check-out to dry out swimsuits is not good. If I had known, staying in a hotel in Yalong Bay would be better than this!

The lifeguards in the hotel swimming pool are responsible. If they see a child alone, they will definitely ask their parents if they are with them. Children who are not tall enough are required to wear life jackets. They will definitely visit again next time.

msg:Atlantis Hotel is what I have always wanted, and this time I finally went with my baby! ~ The hotel has a free bus, drop-off: Hotel-Phoenix Airport 9:00/10:30/11:30/13:30, pick-up: Phoenix Airport-Hotel 10:00/11:30/12:30/14: 30. I arrived at night and didn't enjoy it. I made an appoin**ent with the hotel in advance. If I take a taxi from the airport to the hotel, it is about 42 kilometers, about 1 hour, and the cost is about 140 yuan. The hotel has its own water world, aquarium, C show, and private beach (you can have a barbecue, otherwise it will be too wasteful and black). The doorman welcomes the guests and takes the initiative to open the door to take the luggage. The front desk checks in and enters the facial information, and the follow-up visits to the Water World Aquarium can be entered by swiping the face. The room is large, the bedding is comfortable, double washbasins, the angle of the vanity mirror can be adjusted, the drinks in the refrigerator are free, the table is big enough, it’s just right for takeaway, the place to pick up the takeaway is at the entrance of the aquarium, it’s a short walk from the room , so it’s best to place an order together, and it’s cooler to sit by the glass wall of the floor-to-ceiling aquarium and wait for the takeaway, and it’s nice to watch the fish swimming around. The hotel also has paid entertainment items to participate in, which can be selected in the Atlantis applet, and the hotel also has related counters to inquire about play items. Wake surfing is not in the hotel, but in Dadonghai near Luhuitou, almost in the direction of returning to the airport, one hour one way. Snorkeling is recommended for starry night snorkeling, not so sunny, if you are not afraid of the sun, you can go during the day, the sun really shines. In fact, you should still participate in the diving adventure trip, but the games are full. There are many restaurants in the hotel. There are two relatively large saffron restaurants and colorful crystal restaurants in the morning buffet. You can eat both, and the dishes are slightly different. We went there during the Dragon Boat Festival, and there were quite a lot of people, so the hotel did a good job in emergency response. The area next to the aquarium was temporarily opened as a breakfast venue. There are manicures and supermarkets in the hotel, too thoughtful. The staff in the hotel are very enthusiastic and friendly, and the room cleaning staff are serious and responsible. Before leaving, there is a strong man in the hotel to help you carry your luggage to the bus, and finally get the free bus. I had a very happy stay and will come again in the future. PS: There are seafood food stalls around the hotel, you can check it out in the reviews, many of them provide free pick-up and drop-off.

msg:The two adults and the two children checked into the Atlantis Sanya Hotel that they had longed for on the 21st, and just checked out today on the 22nd. Let’s talk about our tribulation spirit in Atlantis.
The end of July is the peak season in Sanya. We arrived at the hotel at around 11 o'clock. There were many people checking in in the hotel lobby, and it was noisy. Catching up with the noise of Sanya's first farmer's market, we were guided to a place with only two people. The staff checked in at the office, and it only took about half an hour to complete the procedure. At 1:30 in the afternoon, I was notified that the room was ready for check-in. I couldn't wait to find the housekeeper to get the room card and prepare to enter the room to change clothes and take the children to play in the water world. Apart from the long waiting time for check-in, there were really no other drawbacks during this period. Even the housekeeper's attentiveness made me feel quite warm. Unfortunately, after we returned to the room at night, the nigh**are began! I entered the room at nine o'clock, and the family ate takeout together. At ten o'clock, I ran water for the children to take a bath. While the children were taking a bath, I called the front desk and told them that I needed an extra bed, and asked if the bed was wide enough for two children. The answer I got was yes. . Within ten minutes, the doorbell rang, and the waiter stood at the door with a POS machine, saying that he needed to pay for the extra bed before he could bring the bed. Well, after swiping the card, he fell into a long wait again, until the two children I was lying on the sofa and fell asleep before the bed was delivered. I looked at my phone at the door and it was already 11:40. I looked at the bed again and couldn't help but sigh that it was so narrow, but the waiter who delivered the bed said it was 1.2 times 1.8 Yes, I asked her to help us get settled, but as expected, the two eight-year-old children couldn't sleep at all. I saw that the bed was 0.9 wide, so I didn't want to bother and wanted to go to the duty-free shop early when I woke up. , urging the child to go to bed quickly. The result was wonderful... I just fell asleep and was woken up by the heat. The air conditioner broke again! ! ! We quickly called the front desk, and the engineer came and confirmed that the air conditioner could not be repaired within a short period of time, so he upgraded us to a suite at 12:40 in the morning. At 1:30 in the morning, we came to the suite empty-handed, wearing pajamas, and fell asleep. It was already half past nine in the morning when I opened my eyes. All my original plans were disrupted. I had no time to have breakfast at the hotel. I just wanted to race against time to pack my luggage in the original room and rush to the duty-free shop. So when we first met the on-duty GM at the door of the original room, my request was to give my children some souvenirs and delay check-out until 4 pm. The manager readily agreed. At this time, we didn't waste too much time on each other for this matter. When I entered the room, I found that the clothes I washed last night were still dripping because there was no air conditioning. I also saw the useless bed, so I called the manager, hoping to dry our clothes and transfer the extra bed. The fee was refunded to us, but we never expected that the duty manager's actual words were: "Didn't you already make a request just now? So now you can only choose one of the two demands." Although I was full of questions at the time, I was pressed for time. I had to go to the duty-free shop urgently, so I chose to refund the extra bed fee without any nonsense. The more I thought about it on the way to the duty-free shop, the more I felt aggrieved. I felt that I was spending money on something, so I sent a message to the housekeeper to express my dissatisfaction, but the housekeeper responded at 1 p.m. I agreed to dry it, but because the check-out time was too short, I could only dry a few items. I was really speechless at the time. I didn’t understand why a hotel that claims to be a seven-star hotel would handle the problem like this, without humanistic care. Besides, it will only make trouble! The result of this incident was that I boarded the plane back to Wuhan with a bag of wet clothes!
This is the high-end hotel where we spent more than 4k to stay. What we got was that in addition to not having a good rest, we were also annoyed by the GM on duty. We treat customer complaints as you like. Complaints will not affect my occupancy rate. , it is indeed Atlantis that can pay eight salary by the end of the year!
ps: Let’s just talk about it, maybe because the occupancy rate is too high, the hardware inside the room is severely worn out. There are blind spots everywhere in the bathroom, the windows around the balcony are coated with water, and the cryptids crawling out of the drawers from time to time all seem to be incompatible with the hotel’s reputation.

After check-in, the housekeeper Leif immediately contacted and added WeChat, and informed the hotel activities one by one, taking care of him very carefully. I also gave a doll for the children, and the children liked it very much~ The child cut his nails just after checking in. Since he decided to travel temporarily, he didn't bring a lot of luggage, and he didn't bring nail clippers. They were also nail clippers that Leif contacted.
This time, because my baby had a fever, I didn't have a good time. I still want to stay here next time. If I have regrets, I can make excuses for my next visit, hahaha~

The water in the swimming pool is very clean and there are few people, probably because the water world diverted
It's a pity that we don't have time to play in the swimming pool. Next time we will stay a few more days!

Various services and a schedule of various shows and events. When you enter the room and open the balcony door, you will be greeted by the blue Yalong Bay and the lively water park area.

But when I arrived at the hotel, it was overcrowded and there was a queue for breakfast. Fortunately, I got up early. Are there so many local tyrants in China now? However, after real experience, if you only live here, it is indeed not cost-effective, but if you need to visit the water world of Atlantis, living here is super cost-effective. Two days of unlimited play in Water World + Aquarium, unlimited entry and exit by face swiping, back to the room to rest when tired, and continue to play after enough rest, it is not too comfortable. The rooms, facilities, services, and supporting facilities are all very good. Especially the housekeeper, Davis, has a good attitude and helped me find the wheel accessories for the suitcase after get off work. Next time I come to Sanya Haitang Bay, I have to stay here.

Hotel guests can visit the aquarium and water world unlimited times, which is very convenient to bring a baby.

The quality of food in the club on the 48th floor is good, including breakfast, afternoon tea, and happy hour. You can eat almost all day. The fried egg 🍳 is very smooth, the soup noodles will be produced differently in these two days, and the beef brisket noodles are really good.

You can see the swimming pool nearby, the sea in the distance, and look at the clear sky thousands of miles away. It is so beautiful. Unlimited access to the water world aquarium is particularly attractive, and it is also a dedicated channel for residential guests, which is full of thoughtfulness. Thank you for the warm reminder and follow-up service from the exclusive butler Xiao Shen. Will come again, Atlantis, goodbye! ^_^

The eldest just turned 12 years old, and the hotel didn't charge separately. They also provided afternoon tea and happy hour, which basically settled three meals a day. Fairy, the hotel butler, added WeChat in time to remind and ask about needs in a timely manner. She responded to every request and gave the child chocolates and dolls. The child was very happy. It was a three-day itinerary and I had a great time. I will visit again next time.

There are two breakfast restaurants, the saffron is bigger, the Chinese breakfast is more, and the colorful crystal is smaller and more Western-style. It is open until 11 o'clock, so you can sleep in the morning Will be lazy. The water world and the aquarium can play unlimited times, but children over 12 years old need to pay an additional 600 yuan per day. The aquarium is not too big, but the sparrow is small, but it has all internal organs, mermaid performances, white whale performances, and all kinds of fish. Both. The water world is relatively sunny. It is recommended to wear sun protection clothing for 100 days. You can also go to play after 4 o'clock in the night. Children like rafting and thunderbolt/serial trumpet the most, which is a little exciting! If you don't want to go out to eat, you can go to Xingguang Food, the price/performance ratio is relatively high! If you go out, you can go to the Hongsha food stall in Haitang 68 Commercial Street, and order the 438 lobster and grouper set meal. The seafood is very fresh, and you can also buy it on the spot and process it yourself. Overall quite satisfied!

msg:It's the first time I come here, and I feel that this is also the ceiling of hotel services!
After staying for two days, we wanted to change to a room with a view of the water world. The front desk clerk immediately contacted us. On the third day, we changed the room smoothly, which opened our eyes to the child!
The room card was lost, and the waitress got a new one right away, telling us that if we like the room card, we can keep it as a souvenir.
I didn't spray mosquito repellant when I went out, so the waiter brother quickly brought out a brand new bottle for us.
The child's foot was inexplicably pricked, and he cried out in pain. The aunts in the infirmary surrounded him to treat him, and the elder brother of the waiter brought him new slippers.
We didn't taste many restaurants in Atlantis. The breakfast is absolutely good, with both Chinese and Western food. The most beautiful thing is the unlimited freshly squeezed fruit juice. Lunch is eaten at Devil Chef Gordon's breadstreet every day. It is expensive but delicious. The hot bread there is really delicious in the world. It is not to be missed. Anyone who strongly recommends to try this restaurant.
Besides, there are many people in the water world, but compared with Universal and Disney, Quickpass 288 is too cost-effective. My son and I have played in Shark Rafting 20 times! There are also a variety of large and small speakers and a children's playground, a boy's paradise, my son doesn't want to come out after getting into it!
In short, there are too many places that can be given five stars. To go to Sanya, you must live in Atlantis for two or three days, so that your children can enjoy themselves!

The landscape is beautiful, you can see the coastline and the whole water world, the water world at night is pink, very dreamy. Sanya is humid but there is no moisture at all when you check in. It is well-equipped and the service is in place. If there is a little noise from the vent, a master will be sent to overhaul it. The breakfast at Saffron is very big, and there are many Hainan specialties: Hainan marinated powder, seafood in vinegar, salt and pepper fruits (pineapple, carambola, guava), etc. The taste is endless. Guests who go to the water world and the aquarium can scan their faces to enter, and they can enter and exit unlimited times after checking out at noon and before 3 pm. The hotel is very playable. In addition to the Water World Aquarium, there is also a swimming pool in the hotel. The live band at the Tikki restaurant near the swimming pool is really a**ospheric at night, and the fire dance performance is very good.

There are so many things to play in Atlantis, but thanks to the thoughtful service of the little housekeeper, Xiao Ruan, you won't get lost. The time is relatively short this time, and there are still some items that have not been played, so I look forward to the second brush. My flight was delayed, and Xiao Ruan helped me to apply for late check-out and arrange check-out luggage storage, so that I could relax and play for an extra hour or two. Nice!

msg:The 4,000-per-night room was so shabby that I didn’t even want to take pictures. It just looked like a 400-per-night express hotel. As for the service, everything I asked for was nothing. Check-in was not until around 4pm. I was told that I was waiting for news, but I didn't call to urge me. No one paid any attention to me at all. As for the butler service, it's even more ridiculous. It wasn't until noon the next day that I got a call asking you to add a butler. In addition, the so-called Water World Aquarium has unlimited entry. Think about it for yourself. You don’t check in until four o’clock, put down your luggage and get dressed and go immediately. You only played once, and you have to catch the C show at eight o’clock. That show was even more silly and hot, and it was all about promoting VIP upgrade seats. The next day I visited the aquarium and checked out at 12 o'clock. So I have to stay for at least two days. We stayed for two days and it cost 8,000. I think the price at the back is more expensive, so this kind of leeks is the one that many Chinese people eat, so let’s cut it! I will go to other hotels in the future. Of course, there are good things. For example, there are more than a dozen bottles of water in the room at once, and the breakfast is very, very rich. But there is also an incredible thing. The Royal Club breakfast that I upgraded is actually far less good than the ordinary breakfast. So, Are those who spend money being resentful?

But the service is really good, you can store your luggage at the door, and you can send your luggage directly to the room after check-in. There are a lot of people checking in. Fortunately, there are royal club rights, so there is not much queue for check-in. But the room didn't come until after three o'clock. Fortunately, the butler Sally's full service made our trip to Yate much easier. After checking in, go to the aquarium first. There are many kinds of fish and they are very beautiful. After watching the mermaid show, the tour is over soon. The children's playground is a bit average. There are also many people queuing up in the water world, but rafting is very interesting. The children have played several times, and the staff are also very enthusiastic. I like it. The benefits of the Royal Club are still very good, and the food is also very good. The afternoon tea and happy hours are great, and the breakfast is the restaurant with the most variety I have ever eaten.
However, the most profound experience of staying in Atlantis this time is that the service of the hotel is really great. Whether it is the restaurant or the pool service staff, they are very professional and polite, and the food and drink supplies are very thoughtful. fine

When we were playing in the water world, he put the luggage in advance Helped us into the room; also thoughtfully reminded us what time and activities would be held; asked if we needed extended service the next day; asked carefully if we needed help to move the luggage down at check-out time..... All the details are thought out for the guests in advance and arranged in advance. As long as there are any needs, he will respond to them and will do his best to meet them. The sincere service is moving, and the feeling of being at home is really good. Every detail reflects the super 7-star caring service, and the experience of staying in the hotel is particularly good. The first-line sea view of the room is also very beautiful. The blue sea is full of eyes, and the exquisitely designed landscape echoes with the sea view. It is extremely beautiful. There are light shows and drone shows at night, which is really healing! I have been to Sanya more than ten times, and this trip to Atlantis is the most satisfying one. I will definitely stay at Atlantis again next time I come to Sanya.

msg:The butler’s service is pretty good~
The following ratings do not refer to personal butler service:
Summary: Next time I come to Sanya, I will not choose to stay at Atlantis. Instead, I will stay in a nearby hotel and consume entertainment items alone, and I will not recommend other friends to stay at Atlantis;
1. After experience, the price-performance ratio of Atlantis Hotel is not too high, and the commercial content is too expensive. I understand that hotels have management and labor costs, but service attitude is not the only indicator of user retention or return of users. Generally, families only spend time in hotels. Accommodation + free entertainment;
2. The user profile of Atlantis should be parent-child families who are interested in water sports. This group of users should also be the main paying group. However, the consumption level of the hotel must basically reach the petty bourgeoisie level before consumption can be worry-free and only done once. The capital of sexual consumption does not last long;
3. In terms of cost performance, a 2+1 ride on the small train in the park costs NT$98 (just for a single trip), the SPA premium is nearly 5-8 times that of the business district, and the catering prices are also at the business reception level. For the above user portraits of the main paying groups It seems that either you will not choose to consume, or it will be a one-time consumption;
4. The breakfast category is basically the same as that of hundreds of hotels in Yalong Bay, but the retail price of Atlantis is 100 yuan more;
5. The hotel is very large and it is inconvenient to travel and there is no transportation. If you park a little further in the parking lot, you will have to walk for a long time. It is recommended to set up a flexible pick-up and drop-off mobile car;

The butler Davis would like to give special praise. He is always online, and the service is meticulous and thoughtful. He will give hidden benefits and surprise small gifts. The children are very happy. Next month is my mother's 60th birthday. This trip is an early birthday celebration for her, and she had a great time. It can be seen that the hotel is very generous in all aspects, and the service is also very attentive, which is reflected in the small details everywhere.

msg:The lobby is crowded and chaotic. You can see small shops selling things everywhere on the first floor of the hotel lobby. The business model is too heavy and the hotel service is poor. It doesn't feel like a hotel, but more like a tourist attraction. There are many people and noisy ; The most speechless thing is that there is still a queue for breakfast. There are too few types of breakfast, there is nothing to eat, it can only barely fill the stomach, and the taste of breakfast is also very average; the quality of the hotel is completely inconsistent with this rating, and the price is still on the high side. Compared with other similar interstellar hotels, there are many differences, so choose this hotel carefully!

The hotel did not do a good job in diverting this guest. There is also the breakfast Very, very bad. Sorry for the price of 2,500 yuan for breakfast. There are many repetitions, and a lot of food was not replenished in time. You have to queue up even to get a poached egg. Generally speaking, Internet celebrity hotels have a large passenger flow, so it is not recommended for everyone to go there during holidays.

They even helped us to extend the check-out time. It was really nice grateful
The aquarium is very beautiful, and the c show is also beautiful. Children in the water world are very happy to play, but there are few facilities suitable for children.
It's too hot, so wear sunscreen.
Overall very good.

It is very convenient to go to the Royal Club on the 48th floor for afternoon tea and breakfast. As soon as we checked in, the butler Cherry was attentive and considerate. Ask about our needs at any time, and inform us of the afternoon tea and breakfast time of the Royal Club in a timely manner. The butler is great, thank you for your hard work!

Especially the housekeeper Mengmeng, from check-in to check-out, is attentive to understand if there is anything that needs help, and introduces the hotel's project schedule and aquarium in detail You don’t have to worry about the performance time in the hotel during your stay. We also prepared a souvenir, including a small doll with the hotel logo, milk candies and refrigerator magnets. Children must like it. Because the weather is a bit cold, it is a pity that we can’t get into the water. Save some regrets and come back in the summer.

msg:I am lazy and bored to write about my real experience. This hotel has more than 1,000 rooms, so there are a lot of people. Plus people who come to the aquarium, water world and other people, there are various shops downstairs, so it will be more "lively". The Atlantis amu*****t park hotel may be more realistic. Don't have too high expectations, otherwise I may feel a sense of disparity as soon as I enter the door. When I enter the lobby, I feel like I am entering a shopping mall. A seven-star lobby is nothing more than that. However, the breakfast and aquarium are still good. The swimming pool outside may be okay if the temperature is higher. There are more big names in the room. In addition, this hotel has also done a good job in marketing and is famous far and wide. In order to praise the hotel, we have two dolls. Sorry, I reserved a room. The staff efficiency is also quite high. For a hotel with low profit margin, it is considered to be a well-run hotel. It is a hotel that knows how to do business. It's okay if you like to enjoy yourself quietly, and if you like to watch the aquarium and play in the water world (pay attention to the temperature, try to keep it above 25 degrees, and remember to borrow a bath towel). If I were asked to choose again, I would still come, out of disgusting curiosity, hahaha. If you ask me if I would choose it the second time, no no no, then I still prefer Marriott and Crowne Plaza. Personally, I prefer the quiet Shanhaitian Marriott.

msg:The room on the side of the park is very comfortable from the high-level view. As soon as he checked in, the housekeeper, Xiao Yuan, added WeChat and sent notifications about the opening hours and activities of various project facilities, which was quite thoughtful. There is plenty of mineral water in the room, and the fragrance of AHAVA's spare parts is also very pleasant. The response to room needs is very fast. Whether it is the housekeeper, the floor manager, or the service staff, they are quick to move and have a good attitude.
The breakfast buffet is rich in saffron, croissants, noodles, wontons, and salted powder are all delicious, and you will be super full at the first meal of the day. Coupled with the courtesy of the Royal Club on the 48th floor, basically you can have fruit desserts, snacks, soft drinks and coffee when you are hungry. It is super convenient. If the children want to drink milk before going to bed at night, the barista will help to make steamed milk, which is super considerate.
Children are obsessed with the aquarium's ambassador atoll fish tank every day, and love the bubble party in the hotel's heated swimming pool. It’s the water world, because I’m relatively timid, I didn’t play too many projects, but in order to avoid the hot sun, we went to the water world in the evening, and caught up with the pink night event. The advantage of living in Atlantis is that these hotels have slippers, bathrobes and bath towels, and unlimited access to the Water World Aquarium is also very friendly to families with children who are uncertain.
