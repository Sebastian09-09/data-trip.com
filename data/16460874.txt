msg:The stay was impressive. Not only was the room spacious, the site was also peaceful will very few other guests at the time we went.

The environment was so nice that we forgot we were in Shanghai. Experiences of having hotpot next to the river, cycling around the large park, visiting the antique villa and learning about the history, were exceptional.

We were amazed by Johnny Qin and his team's warm hospitality and heart-touching service, especially the hand-drawn welcome card which bear the logo of our company. Attentions were paid to every detail during our stay.

Penny was our yoga tutor and she was so friendly in teaching us and also taking pictures for us. Highly recommended.

As for the afternoon tea on the boat, we had a great chat with Kevin Li 李城城, rounding up a sweet and memorable experience for us at Amanyangyun.

Will definitely come back again.

The staff were really attentive especially Ms Susan ! She took the initiative to link me up on WeChat which makes communication so much easier ! I ate a pepino melon without knowing what it was and I asked her. She then packed a box for me to take home :) I am so touched by the sincerity and care they render to their customers ! I think I am so spoilt by the whole Aman service that I will definitely return for more !
Thank you Ms Susan ! Keep in touch ~

msg:Amanyangyun Hotel is located at No. 6161 Yuanjiang Road. We arrived at the hotel at noon on May 23 and were warmly welcomed by the manager in the lobby. It happened to be my wife's birthday, and Ms. Li from the hotel also presented flowers and birthday cakes to my wife. The hotel also upgraded our room and gave us a large suite in Villa No. 1 and decorated the room, adding a festive a**osphere to the room. The room attendant was also very enthusiastic and helped us further tidy up the room, showing the excellent service of the hotel. We participated in the cultural activities of Nan Shufang and learned painting under the patient guidance of Teacher Cheng. The entire Aman Hotel is a big garden, with a scene at every step, so beautiful, showing the style of a top hotel. In short, this trip to Amanyangyun, whether it is the environment of the hotel or the service, made us deeply feel what is the best hotel and the best service, it is really like home! We will come back to play again if we have the opportunity in the future and recommend it to friends!

There is a big park outside, which is like a gift to Amman, adding a lot of color to Yangyun Amman. The activities inside are also good, with fireworks and free photos. The only weakness is the breakfast, which is not rich enough and is a half-order system. Yihe Amman is the same, with fewer varieties but good quality.

Contact the hotel in advance before check-in, and Kylie patiently arranges a rich list of activities according to our check-in time plan.
Arrived earlier than expected. After checking in, the guy at the front desk took him around the hotel and introduced various activity areas.
A pleasant journey begins.
As soon as you enter the room, there are two small courtyards, one with a swimming pool and the other with a stove, which injects full warmth into the cold winter.
Miki in the children's center was the happiest companion during this trip. The children spent most of their time here. Miki patiently accompanied the children in cutting paper flowers and doing crafts. She also took family photos for us and made beautiful photo frames for us. It was such a surprise.
Lazhu’s little brother is such a surprise to me. Xiaobao cries so much. Generally, restaurant waiters will remind the children to keep quiet. Excellent restaurant waiters will bring small toys. Lazhu’s little brother will bring small toys and play with the children all the time. , so we can eat with peace of mind, no surprises or surprises.
Finally, I am grateful for every encounter I had during this stay. It was really great in every aspect.

msg:Once you enter Aman, you are as deep as the sea. From then on, other hotels are just passers-by...Aman is so great that I can't find words to praise it, I can only express it with "wow" and "**". The whole yard is very big. It’s so big that even after driving around this road for two days, I still get lost and can’t do without the map... The overall ecological environment is excellent, especially the forest park at the back. It’s very comfortable to go for a ride in the morning and breathe fresh oxygen. Stay here The two days just happened to be rainy. It was very pleasant to walk in the rain in the middle of the night or listen to the sound of rain in the yard. The plaque at the door is very low-key and not easy to find for first-time visitors to Aman, but it does fit in with Aman’s character as a retreat. The staff are all warm and polite, and the service is very good. Specifically, the room is of course great, the bedding is very comfortable, and the comb provided is actually an air mattress comb! That's great! And Aman's turndown service made me truly understand the meaning of turndown service. It is not just making the bed, but taking the u**ost care of the guests' daily life details. The gifts given out every day are different. This time I received canvas bags, luggage tags and baseball caps. I will collect other peripherals in the future! Breakfast was at Arva, with a view of the lake. The food was very exquisite and delicious, and the special health drink tasted very healthy... I commended the pork ribs with black bean sauce for their name, they were so delicious that I had to eat half a plate every day. I tried Yinlu at noon and it was extremely fresh. The bowls prepared by the restaurant staff were so delicious! The portion of the single meal is enough for girls to eat and even a little filling, but boys probably won’t be able to. There are many cultural programs and fitness programs that can be experienced in the hotel. I tried the Guqin class, Xiangdao class and Singing Bowl. It was really interesting. Although the experience was only for one hour, I really learned something, which can calm the impetuous heart in modern life. Singing The bowl is like the sound of temple bells. Some of the sounds can be at the same frequency as the body and can even be felt to resonate with the body. The sound passes through the body like a filter to filter out impurities in the body, returning people's hearts to peace and tranquility. Highly praise Aman spa. It is so comfortable. The ice ball massage is particularly comfortable. The hand balm massage tastes very good. It feels refreshing and focused. All the essential oils are not greasy and can be absorbed by the body in a short time. It does not feel washed off. No problem. There is also a facial care program using Aman products that is also worth trying. I didn’t feel much after it, but when I woke up the next day, my skin was in great condition. The whole set of products felt great. It would be great if they were sold to external parties. . The slight drawback is that it is close to the airport. The roar of planes flying across the sky when walking in the forest is a bit ruining the mood. However, the hotel provides earplugs, so it is no problem to have a good sleep. The quality is very worthy of the price, Aman is worth it! It’s really a hotel worth trying! Say goodbye to Aman today and come back later when you have time!

The overall hardware design of the room is good, but the lighting design is very poor: it is difficult to understand and control the appropriate lighting at night. The round table at the head of the bed is not in a good position, which can easily lead to sleeping at night. If someone falls while passing by the restroom, they should consider moving to another place or even moving away to improve the situation!

Simple, pure, elegant and private, it can be said to be a first-class resort experience. The axially symmetrical design technique and indoor wooden materials are warm yet elegant. You can take a bath in the courtyard and watch the starry sky. It is very quiet at night and you can hear the singing of birds and the chirping of insects. It is natural and romantic.

There are bathtubs indoors and outdoors. The bed, quilt and pillows were quite comfortable, and I had a good sleep at night. I was originally worried that there would be noise from planes at night, but it didn't happen, and it was still quiet. Walking outdoors during the day, and planes flying over from time to time. I enjoyed two restaurants. The western food is an Italian restaurant, the Chinese restaurant is called Lazhu, and the non-spicy restaurant has Chaoshan cuisine. The dining environment is good, the scenery outside the window is beautiful, and the service staff also serve with smiles. The gym is great, with good sanitary conditions and complete facilities. I went to the Nan Study Room in the hotel, learned about some tea culture, and visited the Nanmu furniture and some small objects made of Nanmu. It was good. When I got home, I discovered that one of the suitcases had a Yangyun Anman luggage tag attached to it. I have to give this a thumbs up. During the few days I stayed at the hotel, Canada Goose was engaged in construction activities, and some areas were occupied, which was a pity.

As soon as I stepped into the hotel's tree-lined avenue, I calmed down. The room of more than 90 square meters is extremely comfortable and special. It is the spray of the tropical jade forest that allows you to bathe under the huge waterfall and eliminate the fatigue of the whole body.
Because the game was a night game, we rode bikes together during the day to visit the hotel's brand new back garden - Maqiao Forest Park, and visited various precious ancient trees and ancient houses that the hotel investor Mr. Ma Dadong moved from Jiangxi, as well as various kinds of gold and silver. Nan's study room is furnished with nanmu furniture and furnishings, and I also watched the latest American blockbuster with my family in the hotel's private cinema. This week in the hotel was really full of experiences, and the time spent with my family was also very warm. I look forward to the next one. Come again.

By the way, the hotel's breakfast is really great, the ingredients are very fresh, the buffet has a rich variety, and there are even more personalized orders. Dining here is a pleasure!

The entire hotel campus has a wide area, elegant environment, full of pastoral flavor, and poetic scenery everywhere. In the center of the grassland is an old camphor tree that is more than 2,000 years old. In the afternoon when we arrived at the hotel, we were received by Cici, who gave a comprehensive introduction in detail. We also participated in a printing class, and the art teacher patiently and carefully demonstrated and guided us. The layout of the guest rooms is simple and chic, modern and classic, and the fusion is just right. For me, who always has a high quality of sleep, the roar of the plane has no impact. It happens to be raining and the smoke is hazy, which makes it feel special.

The hotel does not separate people and cars, so it is more convenient to use a car, but if you are traveling as a family, it is better not to let children go to the public area to play alone.

The free mineral water in the room is from Evian. It really is a big deal, worthy of a high-end hotel. The bathroom is very big, too big and too comfortable, the water in the shower is so big that I don’t want to come out 😃 In short, the garden view is elegant and quiet... I like it

msg:Facilities: The room is large, there are two yards, and an open-air soaking pool, which is very comfortable at night in summer. A little flaw is that there is a little leak in the bathroom sink, and it was repaired quickly after responding to the front desk ~ like it 👍
Hygiene: Very good and clean, the cleaning is timely, and the attitude of the aunt is very good.
Environment: The ecology of the whole park is very good, with large green area and few mosquitoes. The lobby and the Nan study room are all made of golden nanmu, which smells very fragrant and very comfortable.
Service: Waiters are hardly seen in hotels, but they are always there when you need them. Xiaohong made an appoin**ent for the "ancient building explanation", and Xiaohong was very enthusiastic. After arranging for us to watch the hotel's documentary, he carefully took us to visit the largest "ancient building villa" in the hotel, which gave us a deep understanding of Gan style architecture.
Nan’s study culture experience: I experienced the tea ceremony class in the afternoon. The teacher from Jiangxi was very professional. He introduced us to the tea culture through three kinds of tea. We can really taste different tea tastes through different brewing temperatures and durations.
In addition, everyone must go to experience Teacher Pan’s singing bowl class. The original course has ended, but she saw that I was very interested and taught me alone. I can really feel the relaxation of body and mind in the sound of bowl~
It coincides with the fifth anniversary of Aman. There are many exhibitions in the hotel. I made an appoin**ent to visit the exhibition. The uncle wearing glasses (sorry for not asking the name) drove us to visit them one by one, explained them patiently, and knew the stories behind many artists and exhibits. After viewing the exhibition, he also offered to drive us to the wetland park behind the hotel. The weather was hot that day, which brought us convenience. Thank you very much.

There is a chance to take the whole family to the ancient house for vacation next time. Although the price is high, this experience makes us believe that it is definitely worth a return. Special thanks to the girl Zhongfa who took us to visit the Yangyun Village Art Exhibition on the 14th (the enthusiastic tour guide gave our family a deep impression), the handsome "Rui" Rick who was in charge of boating and taking pictures during the afternoon tea, and helped us arrange travel Cary to all the lobby staff as well as the housekeeper!

msg:Just after the rainy season came out, it was hot and humid. Most Shanghainese had gone out for summer vacation. There were not many people coming to the hotel, and the courtyard was relatively sparse, making it very quiet. Look at the green bamboo outside the Spicy Bamboo Restaurant, look at the lawn on the gentle slope of the river outside the ARVA window, and the lush park on the opposite bank; look at the little turtle hiding under the lotus leaves at the entrance of Nan's study room, look at the thousand-year-old camphor tree directly opposite, and look at the lotus falling And the rain, look at the quiet moss under the hall, look at the vehicles passing quietly outside the door, look at this small and quiet peach garden not far from the city. The room service is very attentive and the room is very comfortable. Occasionally, there are flaws that do not conceal the advantages. For example, there is no light ***** under the tea table, so you can’t see clearly when you come back to make tea at night; the bathroom door in the lobby is heavy, and you will accidentally hit your hand against the wall when you open the door. Add a damper or Doorstops can be avoided. Generally speaking, it meets expectations, the service is appropriate, and the enthusiasm is decent. It is worth visiting again when the trees are sprouting in spring and the yellow leaves are everywhere in autumn.

Sharing a small detail, I left the sun umbrella on the car when I arrived at the store. After the service beauty learned about it, she quietly gave a sun hat and put it in the room.

We should return to Aman again to experience the eco-tour again.

Thank you very much🥹
He helped me put the humidifier before, and after that, he was responsive to every question, and the service was really impeccable. Walking in the hotel, all the staff you meet will take the initiative to say hello and ask if you need help.
The scenery of the hotel is also very good. As soon as I entered this environment, I immediately felt calm and the pace slowed down. Before checking out on Sunday, after breakfast, I was in a daze on the swing chair by the river. It was really a half-day leisure.
The fly in the oin**ent is that there is a little water leakage from the sink in the room, and there is no shower cap in the room, and the air conditioner is a bit cold
I was in a hurry this time, I hope to have a chance to go again next time to experience it carefully🥰

Environment: The overall a**osphere of Aman Yangyun is really good. The big trees that can be seen everywhere make it extra refreshing in the hot summer. The legendary tree king is super beautiful under the blue sky and sunshine. I like it very much.
            Nan's study room is worth a visit. I experienced Chinese painting. The teacher taught me to draw irises. It is very suitable for the theme of early summer. It feels super good

Service: I would like to especially praise the housekeeper Yang Ying Irelia. Although she is not in the hotel, she has been paying attention to the experience of the guests. She helps arrange various restaurant positioning and experience items, which makes people feel very cordial
            In addition, Wan Jiaqi and Xiaohua from Nan's Study Room are very nice and patiently helped to show around and introduce various small gifts in Nan's Study Room. There are so many small things that are very good. They helped me slowly pick out a few small items. I am very happy to have the opportunity to buy them. Must visit again next time.

Breakfast: There are many kinds of fruits, freshly squeezed juices are very good, and various snacks are rich enough for me. The manager on duty in the breakfast room is very good and provides various services at any time

Lunch and dinner: I used two meals at the Spicy Bamboo Restaurant and the products were very good. The most surprising thing is that the dishes are so huge that I can’t finish them🤣Jiangxi cuisine is really good. 😂

He has a strong sense of service, and he has thought out every step of the arrangement for me before I plan. When I come to the hotel, I just need to let myself go. He will plan and arrange everything. Nan's study room, restaurant, and afternoon tea are all arranged properly. The on-call service made my check-in experience completely worry-free. The Nan Study Room experience class arranged is also good, which fits the style of Aman very well. I have tried all three restaurants in the hotel. The short-haired lady in the Italian restaurant arva has a very good service. Her sweet appearance and soft-spoken voice are impressive. But the name is a bit hard for me to pronounce and I don't remember it, sorry hahaha. The Chaoshan cuisine in the Chinese restaurant is very authentic, and the seafood makes me, a northerner, unable to stop. Will still choose when I come back next time

msg:Because of Irelia's subtle empathy, the whole experience of staying has an All-in-one experience;

In the past, I didn’t like the service method of entering the private domain application. I felt that the hotel was a place where I could explore my feelings. Many times, because I added a WeChat, I received deliberate care. Most of them didn’t have time to ask and communicate. The burden of "good reviews"~

Hanging out with friends, without any specific purpose or interest, I talked to Irelia less than ten words in total, just a few moments, I feel that my whole experience is that she is taking care of me, but I don't feel like intervening at all~~

1. Food
Question: "Which one do you recommend, Chinese food, Italian or seafood hot pot?"
Answer: "Chinese food is Jiangxi cuisine, and the building of the hotel is an old house in Fuzhou"
It’s not blindly saying yes, recommending the most unique and suitable for cold weather will increase the confidence of the guests, so I tried the Italian restaurant at noon the next day, and according to my friends, the tiramisu is amazing

2. Incense
Inadvertently, I made an appoin**ent for an incense experience at 15:00 according to the recommendation, and I have forgotten it...
But it happened that she arrived at the hotel 15 minutes earlier, and she was already waiting specially, maybe because the location was hard to find, maybe she felt something?
Finally, this inadvertently participated in the Song and Tang style incense burning experience, like doing an hour of meditation, interesting~~

3. Tea
The route is a bit hard to remember, so I took it to the room in a hurry, maybe I just looked more when I opened the closet~
Q: Do you like to make tea? Evian may not be suitable for boiling water, I asked my colleagues to bring more mineral water~~
Afternoon tea is ready when I go back

4. Bag
Misunderstood that the patio of the room was covered, and hung up the laundry all night
Said it as a joke in the morning
after breakfast,
Wet and dry separation bags and plastic bags have been placed next to the suitcase

Lightness, not micro-carving, just rejoice in everything

After struggling with several options, I chose Yangyun Anman to check in. After the experience, I finally want to thank myself for this decision to settle in Yangyun Anman. It completely met all my requirements for this Spring Festival holiday. I would also like to thank the hotel housekeeper, Xiao Yang, who is so thoughtful and thoughtful. After confirming the order on Ctrip, I called the hotel to inquire about various activities during the Spring Festival. I got in touch and sent me a lot of special activities during the Spring Festival that the hotel can sign up for during my stay. My daughter and I signed up for Chinese painting classes and writing Spring Festival couplets, and booked privately booked movies at the theater (these are provided by the hotel for free for staying guests) and communicated in advance I mentioned that I want to check in at noon, butler Xiao Yang also tried his best to help me to coordinate. I can check in by phone before one o'clock on the day. During the check-in process, the housekeeper Xiao Yang was very professional and introduced this story-telling story to our family along the way. The hotel has a millennium-old tree, Jiangxi old house, Nan Study Room~ Let us experience the cultural a**osphere of the hotel in an immersive way. We are looking forward to Yangyun Amman's hotel rooms without going into details. Let's use it very comfortably. Summarize the room. Three bottles of wine are charged, other food and drinks are free welcome fruit, a large plate of small refrigerator is also full of free drinks, and the hotel's semi-buffet breakfast arrangement is so good that guests don't need to go back and forth to get food and enjoy it calmly The exquisite breakfast time and the indoor and outdoor swimming pools also make my daughter very satisfied. There is basically no mutual disturbance between guests. In particular, I would like to mention Nan Study Room, whether you are staying with children or not. It is recommended to experience the Chinese culture courses provided by Nan Study Room. It is indeed an experience that laymen with zero foundation will like. Overall, the soft cultural services of the hotel are extremely comfortable and fully match this relatively expensive price. My family and I feel that this money is worth spending and it is indeed valuable.

As a native of Jiangxi, this luxury hotel "born from trees and built from houses" has so many elements of Jiangxi: the ancient tree king with more than 1,000 years and ancient houses were all transported from Jiangxi! The "Spicy Bamboo" restaurant in the Chinese Restaurant specializes in Jiangxi cuisine, and it was the first time for me, a Jiangxi native, to eat Jiangxi cuisine New Year's Eve dinner in Shanghai! The dragon and lion dance on New Year's Day was so wonderful that I screamed like a child with excitement. The hotel also has traditional cultural lessons such as books, incense, tea, and paintings. The native woody fragrance of golden nanmu exudes in Nan Study Room makes me intoxicated the most. Walking in the hotel, every place I can see is a kind of quiet and comfortable beauty of "hidden in the city"! Compared with the hardware facilities of the hotel, the service is also perfect. Before check-in, the housekeeper Xiao Yang Irelia will confirm each arrangement in detail, and the service is considerate. The forest park is very big, wandering in it, I firmly told myself that I must come again to experience the beauty of the different seasons of the secret Aman!

msg:I heard that Yangyun Amman Hotel has been around for a long time, and finally took advantage of this 11th holiday to experience it once. Although the price of the hotel during the 11th holiday has risen a lot, the unexpected upgrade still gave me a big surprise, and it was upgraded to The ancient house villa, deeply felt the connotation of raising the cloud once, the ancient house villa should have an area of 300 square meters, with a living room, dining room, bedroom, toilet, 2 cloakrooms, an independent large study, and even a tea room, and The outdoor 20-meter swimming pool and hot spring pool, too many surprises only regret not staying for a few more days. In terms of food and beverages, I tried the afternoon tea on the boat, and rafting on the quiet river to taste tea is also a unique flavor. For dinner, I went to his classic Spicy Bamboo Jiangxi Restaurant. To be honest, I underestimated the chef's ability to handle spicy food. It is really authentic and spicy, not something that ordinary people can afford. . . Ha ha. The semi-self-service form of breakfast is also remarkable. The splendor of the food is no longer about the quantity, but the surprise of the food. I recommend his Jiangxi rice noodles for breakfast, which is authentic! ! Finally, let's talk about the service of the hotel. In fact, the quality of a resort hotel is not only based on whether the decoration is luxurious or not, and whether the food is high-end. The real experience actually requires good service cooperation. This time in Yangyun, I really felt the meticulous service. From the check-in, I will have a dedicated butler who will help me solve any problems throughout the process. Question, James Li, our housekeeper this time, really impressed me. From the beginning, he took us to understand the facilities of Yangyun and pay attention to the details, then to introduce the detailed functions of the room, and then to help us arrange car pick-up and delivery. Part of the time, he personally drove the battery car to pick us up, took us to each restaurant, and helped us arrange all the itineraries and details. What impressed me the most was that the coffee machine in the room was broken, so I couldn't make my own coffee. James arranged for the restaurant to help me make coffee and deliver it to our room. I was really moved. Maybe this is Yangyun Amman's service. It is also the reason why Amman can be based on the world's top luxury hotels! ! All in all, it was indeed a pleasant experience in our house! !

During their stay, the children had a lot of fun playing in the outdoor swimming pool, participated in Chinese painting classes at Nan Study Room, rode bicycles, etc. It was not just a hotel stay at all.
In terms of catering, I ordered spicy bamboo and afternoon tea in advance, which were unexpectedly delicious. The breakfast is semi-buffet. Although it is not much, the taste is quite good. The children are already planning their next stay

msg:Pure solitary vacation. So I chose Shanghai Yangyun. The hotel’s classmate Xiao Yang had already started the matchmaking the day before she checked in. She happened to be on vacation and did not forget her responsibilities. On the contrary, she did all kinds of caring details. It is very nice, thank you. The hotel is biased, and the entrance is low-key. I like it very much. There is not much disturbance inside, and you can relax completely. After sleeping alone for three nights, you don't have trouble falling asleep or waking up in the middle of the night. This is especially rare for people with poor sleep quality. Although environmental protection is important, I think that in terms of the hotel's status in the world, adding high-quality disposable towels and bath towels and high-quality washing and care series can still be icing on the cake, after all, it doesn't cost much. I think customers will be very happy with this one detail. I don’t need to say much about the design and overall feeling of the hotel. After all, the brand is here, and it’s worth paying attention to in detail. The relationship between people, nature and plants belongs to the subtle and immersive design details. I also planted grass for the kettle in the room. In short, you can go again next time.

The hotel spa has indoor and outdoor swimming pools. There is a small disadvantage that there is no lifeguard. The indoor and outdoor are 1.4 meters deep, which is a bit deep for small children. Yinlu's hot pot package is 1300/person + 15% service charge, and the hot pot tastes good. Breakfast is in an Italian restaurant, semi-buffet style, not many types, but the taste is not bad. The kids club can borrow bicycles for free and draw pictures inside. Gigi, the staff member of the Children's Paradise, takes great care of the children and is the staff member I am most grateful for this time at Aman.

Excuse me, how can I live in your whole building for two people, and more than 10,000 is not cheap, not more than 1,000, so learn from Japan's Hoshinoya. I think I have stayed in many good hotels. Going out is also a villa. I didn’t expect to receive this kind of service here. I haven’t booked a restaurant for two consecutive days in the hotel. Why don’t I satisfy the guests first?

The epidemic has begun again because the industry requires that you cannot leave Shanghai and come to Yangyun Amman for a small day. The price is a bit expensive, 6200
Generally speaking, the design is unique and very comfortable, especially the outdoor bathing pool, which avoids the sultry heat of the bathing hall outside, and there are not many free minibars. I am very happy to see Saint Pereul. I ordered the meal and the taste is average. Jiangxi cuisine is spicy.
The Dyson hair dryer in the room, the toilet is average, and the rest are average. I like old luxury hotels. The high-quality service perfectly avoids the update of the equipment. Of course, this is just talking, not Amman, but it's okay.

The bar in the room was empty with a few pieces of fruit and no snacks (I have to ask for it myself.) The service staff was polite but felt reluctant. Because Aman, who only lived in Lijiang two weeks ago, was a little disappointed in the comparison. After all, it is not located in a place with deep cultural heritage, so even if it moves to the old house and the tree in Jiangxi, it is still a little reluctant. What is commendable is the cultural course of Nan Shufang. The teachers of Chinese painting and calligraphy have done their best to let the children learn knowledge. The service of the restaurant staff is also praiseworthy.

The hotel has very good activities every day. You can eat delicious hot pot in the Yinlu restaurant, and the service staff Wu Xiaoxia is super nice, beautiful and thoughtful~~

The service is also very good, from the front desk to the restaurant, very warm and caring. I would especially like to commend Brother Hong Yuan, who served as our temporary tour guide and took us to visit the entire hotel and No. 3 ancient house. The explanation was very good.

The waiter also gave his blessings when I ate at lazhu, and the service was in place wherever I went. Also experienced SPA, gym, pottery and incense classes. There are also shows without leaving the hotel, and the facilities and equipment are exquisite. You can slow down naturally and enjoy nature. It’s the first time to experience the Aman brand, and we decided to come here again on the next anniversary~ hehe.

msg:Our company booked this hotel for one night during the Dragon Boat Festival. A total of 6 rooms were booked. Two of them were in the old house. The price was much higher than usual. In fact, I have stayed in a lot of good hotels. How to comment, but this time Aman still has to complain. The hotel environment is worth the price, but the service is really not as good as Aman. When checking in, I sat in the lobby for a long time and no one came over. Then I said something. An employee who came down was obviously not very impatient, and he hurried to register for you without listening to the request. It seemed to be in a hurry. The weather was relatively hot that day and there was no drink towel. Then I asked for some water and it took a long time. I brought a few bottles of water over, and it was said that the room was about to be arranged for the anniversary, and then everything was wrong, and the wrong room was arranged! In addition, there are Japanese in our party. Obviously, we have a different attitude towards Japanese people. Wait for the above seemingly common little details. I think it really should not happen in Aman. Aman's brand of service I didn't expect it, because Aman, who had lived in Hangzhou before, had a good impression, but this time it completely changed my perception of Aman!

I feel that breakfast is half of Chinese and Western styles, and I can have a full meal. Anyway, it is not the feeling of a big five-star hotel. The hotel is very big and there is no problem with parking at all.

The location of the hotel is remote, and it may indeed be impossible to recruit employees who have a sense of identity with Amman's culture. There is no security barrier between the construction site and the hotel that the hotel is going southward, and it feels very insecure. Above, it is difficult to consider going again.

The scope of the hotel is very small, there is nothing interesting, and the guest rooms are of average B&B level. It is completely different from Fuchun Shanju in Hangzhou, and the price is several times that of the other one. Overall, the price/performance ratio is very low and not worth recommending.

奢侈酒店裡，極美的建築和室內設計不少；也不泛歷史和自然保育的情懷。再加上既專業有分寸感，又健談沒距離感的員工和服務體驗；和用起來實用舒適的設計，細節保養妥當的管理，完美。

Spa, imax 電影，頌缽雨竹冥想，楠書房金絲楠木傢俱tour，古琴課，香道課，獨享泳池，露天泡澡… 各種活動慢慢來。

當中特別感謝Cici管家式服務。臨時安排客户茶會和聚餐，讓我少了很多後顧之憂。

大概經濟條件好的神獸們都出國去了，酒店好安靜，各種單人包場，獨自享受老宅老樹鳥語蟲鳴。單身遊自有其樂趣。

msg:值得推薦，很好，遠好於杭州和麗江安縵。很適合情侶或一家人安靜的放鬆心情，聊天聚會。

先説銀廬餐廳，非常贊！户外環境沒得説，秋天不冷不熱，草地星空，尤其是服務員lucy非常貼心全程服務，幫助介紹和涮菜，不突兀，也沒有打擾，因為當天户外就我們一桌，所以還專門提供藍牙音箱放自己的音樂，拉滿細節。可能由於交流愉快，結束主動詢問是否有吃飽，還送了半分餛燉

服務：細節拉滿，貼心耐心
酒店內部自己有核酸檢測非常方便，所有的服務都會第一時間響應，enoch的前台接待介紹詳細且不宂長。退房後第一時間發現拉了東西，非常主動熱情的處理。

設施：金絲楠木的設計很特別，房間很喜歡，燈光很暖，礦泉水還是依雲，麗江杭州安曼都沒有。屋裡的堅果真的好吃，晚上忍不住直接幹了一瓶啤酒。入户的露天小浴缸很有趣，看得出用心了（如果使用還會提供事先二次清洗）

早餐：早餐環境舒服，音樂也很合景。江西粉很好吃！有特色。服務員都非常友善，主動。班尼迪克蛋、煙燻三文魚、果汁這些都非常棒錢！食材很正，安曼的果汁每家都比較純。

補充：飛機聲有，但我覺得不影響休息，（酒店貼心還準備了耳塞，12點之後其實就沒有什麼動靜了）反而有種反差，還知道在忙碌的工作中，有這樣一塊凈土休息。
做得好就是要全力推薦！

安縵，這個品牌酒店一直在我們瑜伽人心裏都是很嚮往和認可的，希望疫情過後體驗全世界不同地方的安縵。唯一不足，前台哥哥失誤把價格説錯了。我訂成五千多，他説四千多，所以中間房差有問題，他當時也尷尬，這一點我退房時心裏非常不舒服。

🏨位置：在閔行馬橋鎮，自己開車的話，交通還是十分便利的。酒店也有足夠的地下停車場，住在別墅的房間的話也有專屬車位。
💰價格：酒店價格來説不算便宜，也是能加床的，酒店環境和服務還是比較值得的！沒想到上海還有如此寧靜神祕的地方……
💁🏻‍♂️服務：這家的服務真的沒話説，第一次去的時候在門口遇到的是經理Martin吧，態度相當親切，會幫忙按照口味進行訂餐，想的各方面都比較周到！還有要提一下第一次帶我們進房間的小哥哥洪源，他把我們送到房間後，還帶我們參觀了酒店一圈，把酒店的特色和值得去的地方都解釋的十分清楚和明白！以致於我家小朋友次次來都要找他🤣。還有中餐廳辣竹有個點菜的小哥哥也很好，但是每次吃飯都太暗沒看清楚他的名牌，下次補上…😄
📖Tips：早餐品種不算多，但是品質還是可以的，午餐晚餐可以在酒店可以選中餐和西餐，還有個海鮮火鍋之類的。我衹吃過中餐，下次可以換換口味試試！如果不想在酒店吃，附近還有個萬達廣場，撒都有！哈哈哈
總之應該還會再去的，暑假去避暑是個不錯的選擇👌🏻

msg:今年3月份，非常有幸來到一個距離上海市區較遠的“世外桃源”，養雲安縵酒店。多年前，我看過很多關於安縵酒店的介紹，由於自己是一個十足的酒店控，自然把安縵酒店視為“頂配”，決定找個機會好好的感受一下，這次的上海一行讓我這個小夢想成了現實。很奇怪，回想起安縵來，印象最深的不是環境和服務，而是文化底藴。我突然意識到，安縵又讓我對酒店的認知上升了一個層次。我想，來到上海養雲安縵最讓人忘不掉的應該就是“棲息”在後院有着1700年歷史的那顆古樹。它的存在讓整個安縵有了根，這裏的每一個人、物和古宅都與它通聯，我們站在它的面前就像它的孩子一樣，被它看穿、被它包容、被它祝福。古樹旁邊的古井，隨時漲着水，拿起水上的瓢為它澆灌，算是我們與它的調皮和嬉戲。看着這裏的古樹和古宅，會讓你猜想這背後的故事，安縵也很貼心的準備了長達20分鐘的視頻簡介，當然也包括了這些來自江西的古樹和古宅的祕密，非常推薦。作為安縵這種級別的酒店，關於消費我用三個字就可以完全的概括：很講理。這裏的一切都是低調，但不缺失細節的把控，每一個看似平淡的背後都曾經經歷了驚濤駭浪，不深究就容易錯過。我注意到自己聊到現在都不想去説安縵的設計和服務，感覺那樣衹會把它看小。兩天一夜的行程，把時間全都交給安縵，這裏暫時阻斷了城市的喧囂和工作的煩惱。隨着酒店的安排參加了一個香薰課程，仙女般的香薰老師讓我養成了香薰的習慣，從她的眼神中可以看到她對這份工作的喜愛，那份古典氣質彰顯專業特徵，有很強的代入感。其他的課程沒有參加到，想給自己一點點小的遺憾，為下一次的到來增加一份小小的期待。
