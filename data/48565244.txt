msg:Overall the check-in process was smooth and efficient including the tedious task of having to show health QR codes, having pictures taken of passport with China residence visa side by side with phone showing health code, then making copies of visa page, passport page, last China entry stamp page, etc etc. In spite of the time this whole process takes the staff knew what they were supposed to do and went about the process as quickly as possible. A small welcome gift was an unexpected surprise. Special word of thanks to Ms.爱森那赫 at the reception (not sure if this is her actual name). She was the only one who spoke English and was guiding her colleagues to check us in smoothly. She also gave us a good recommendation to try local cuisine for dinner at a restaurant which was a 5 min walk from the hotel. The only confusing bit is the fact that hotel reception is located on the 3rd floor. Our Didi drivers did not know how to get us there as the drive up to the 3rd floor was through a parking lot next to the hotel. The hotel should either post clear instructions on a sign board for taxi/Didi drivers to follow or they should have someone posted at the entrance to guide vehicular traffic up through the parking lot to the lobby for check in. But all in all a pleasant experience and we would not hesitate to stay here again should we plan another trip to the city.

The wrong invoice was issued once during the process, but Miss Su Qi was very patient and issued it again.

1這個酒店的攜程顯示是烏魯木齊前十的酒店，但是這個酒店的樓不是這個酒店獨家的，樓下沒有酒店大堂，樓上還有別的酒店，檔次直接拉胯。
2酒店沒有風景可言，最後一張就是這個酒店的風景，自己看就完了
3第一天定了500的含餐的套餐訂單，兩份早晨兩份午餐或者晚餐，第二天衹定了房間400多，因為是旅遊第一天所有的餐都沒用，晚上和前台協商轉第二天的兩份早晨就可以了，前台也回電話説可以，並希望給好評，第二天早上到餐廳告知衹有一個早餐另一方要花60塊錢買，當時人都蒙了，這老闆是窮瘋了嗎？
總結一下:請該酒店注意一下你們不衹代表你們自己酒店，你們還代表所有住店人對烏魯木齊的印象，一個旅遊城市印象。酒店回電為此事道歉我也接受了，但是作為此行1萬公里自駕唯一差評酒店，我也堅持自己的客觀意見
