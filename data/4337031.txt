msg:The most anticipated thing for the May Day Xiamen trip is this Hongtang Hotel. From landing to check-in, we were not disappointed! This hotel really amazed us~ The whole style is Shake style! The details are very attentive! Including the staff who carry the luggage, the service staff for breakfast and afternoon tea! They are all very enthusiastic and loving! Let us feel that the entire trip to Gulangyu is perfect! Taking into account this room type is very suitable for staying with children! The room design is simple and exquisite! Although the area is small, every detail is perfect! The whole hotel is so beautiful! We also experienced the Red Pig Restaurant, but it’s a pity that there is no classic braised pork rice, and other dishes are also delicious. Although there are not many types of breakfast, the single-point production is very delicious. There are all that should be there! The staff is very busy during breakfast time, but they are very patient and responsive! It’s really not easy~ Although it’s very strenuous to come to Gulangyu, it’s really suitable for staying and walking slowly and strolling slowly! I highly recommend staying here!

Hygiene: The corridors and outdoor areas of the room are clean and tidy (even on rainy days)
Environment: Located in the middle of the island, the location is convenient but not noisy.
Service: The reception is quite satisfactory, and drinks and snacks are prepared attentively. The minibar in the room is also good. The afternoon tea and breakfast provided are also unexpected and worthy of praise. Sweet soup will be delivered in the evening, which is very considerate and attentive.
In addition, I also went to the hotel’s own Red Pig Restaurant. The products are basically good. There are not many dishes, but they are all made with care.

I went to play with two other sisters, so the two sisters lived in a large bed and I lived in a small bed. The facilities in the whole room are very complete and very hygienic!

The characteristic of Red House Hotel is that their public area is very large and very photogenic! Whether it is the restaurant for afternoon tea and breakfast or the restaurant for Red Pig Private Kitchen, I think both the quality of the dishes and the service are very good.

The hotel lobby is also very beautiful and full of artistic sense!

I especially want to praise the young brothers and sisters who serve the hotel. They are really nice. The hotel also provides laundry, in a coastal city like Xiamen. Drying clothes is a difficult thing. They not only wash but also help us dry and send them to the room. It is a very considerate service!

msg:Hongtang is really great, highly recommended.

Facilities: The hotel has a sense of design, and the consumables used are all high-end. The hotel's attentiveness and high-end taste can be felt in every detail. It is also the first time I have seen a hotel restaurant use Stokke's children's dining chair (parents with children should know that this dining chair is expensive)

Service: Impeccable, the hotel's service staff are all young people, probably some born in the 2000s, with rare patience and meticulousness. When you get off the boat, someone will greet you at the pier, serve homemade drinks, and accompany you along the way to introduce Hongtang and Gulangyu. Check-in was quick, and the staff for breakfast/afternoon tea/dinner were all very considerate. There was also sweet soup in the evening. It was pouring rain on the day we checked out. The service staff who sent us out arranged a master to send luggage, and also specially took a few transparent umbrellas, saying that they were afraid that we would get wet without umbrellas after getting off the boat. Meticulous service is always the most touching.

Environment: The location is closer to Neicuoao Pier. It is recommended to pay attention when buying boat tickets to avoid walking a lot. The hotel is also good to walk on the hillside, very close to Sunlight Rock and the beach.

Catering: Breakfast is simple but the dishes are very good. The quality of afternoon tea is higher than most five-star hotels. You must try it. Every dish in the Red Pig Restaurant is amazing. The fish skin dumplings are delicious.

I have been to Gulangyu three times and have been to all the places I should go, but because of Hongtang, I will be willing to come again.

BTW, no service staff asked us to write a review, which is really rare, so I am more willing to recommend this hotel.

The best thing is that when I came back and looked through the old photos, I found that I lived in a homestay in the same location of Hongtang 9 years ago. It was really fate.

msg:I came to Gulangyu, Xiamen, for Hongtang. I was looking forward to it. When the butler came to pick us up at the pier, he handed us brown sugar winter melon water in the hot afternoon. We followed him all the way and told him about Hongtang's past and present. We arrived before we knew it. Then they arranged to provide snacks in the public area, led us to the guest room, and told us that we could have afternoon tea at 3 o'clock. There were so many surprises. I used the ancient key to open the door. When the door opened, my heart melted. It was so beautiful. Listening to the birds singing and the wind, it was very quiet. The room provided tea bags and home-made teapots, tea cups, and toiletries. Lelabo toiletries and Dyson hair dryers are also available. There is also dry cleaning service, which is really necessary for people who travel for a long time. There will also be midnight snacks and desserts for dinner. You can really experience the breakfast yourself. It's super good and the products are great. This service is really super at this price. 
The hygiene is very clean and the service is very good. In summer, mosquito repellent is also provided. It's super thoughtful!

As soon as we met, the butler sent winter melon tea to quench thirst. It was very considerate. There were welcome snacks at check-in, beautiful afternoon tea and rich breakfast at check-in, and warm sweet soup when we returned to the hotel at night. It was excellent.
Hygiene: The only drawback is that the room is relatively small and the bathroom has a slight smell. The toiletries are lelabo, I like it.

The sentence "It's predecessor is a church, and it has a certain history" reminds me of the experience of a certain writer I like staying in a church when he was in a foreign country.
Facilities: Decorated in an ancient style, with a fresh air system inside, so there is no smell. Sound insulation is average and ear plugs are provided. acceptable.
Hygiene: Very clean and cleaned in time.
Environment: It's not bad even close to the pier, but there are a lot of slopes, which will kill me as I get older.
Service: There are butlers to help deliver luggage to and from the pier. very convenient.
Sweet soup is served in the evening, breakfast is rich, and afternoon tea is high-end and delicious. I will stay there an unlimited number of times in the future when I go to Gulangyu Island. I still miss the moment of leisure brought by blowing the curtains. I will think of the salty butter in the afternoon. I will also think of this hotel, which uses my favorite... of perfume...

msg:For the first time in life,
A hotel that I would never leave.

The waiter who picked me up from the ferry terminal was wearing black Chinese overalls, carrying a white canvas bag, and holding a yellow umbrella...

When we arrived at the hotel gate, the girl in white with a big smile came out to greet us...

When we entered the lobby, we were immediately served with welcome tea (Picture 1). We opened our towels, wiped our hands, and drank tea while waiting to check in...

Brother Huang Umbrella and a manager sent us to the room, and explained the facilities and supporting facilities in detail, and even demonstrated how to secure the room door...

Then go to the coffee shop and enjoy the exquisite afternoon tea provided by the hotel. The tables and chairs in the cafe are all medieval, which appeals to my aesthetic taste... What I didn't expect is that the desserts taste better than those in professional shops outside!

Also, after learning that we were here for our wedding anniversary, the hotel immediately upgraded our room for free.

What a surprise.

The hotel is where the famous piano master Yin Chengzong received piano enlightenment from an early age. There are only 13 rooms, and the overall decoration style is retro and high-end. I held my camera and couldn't stop taking pictures...

Breakfast was also very good. Every waiter is kind and polite.

If you come to Gulangyu Island, I highly recommend staying at Hongtang.

msg:The overall design of the hotel is OK. I booked the largest room on the first floor, and the room equipment is quite complete.
But the location is really hard to find, and there's nothing we can do about it. Just ask the butler to show you the way. The service attitude is very good.
But I think there are a few things that are not very good:
One is that the drainage of the toilet is not good and it will be clogged. The water needs to be stopped for a few minutes before flushing to prevent it from overflowing.
Secondly, I know that many people come to Hongtang for the design, but in fact it is really not that amazing. It is still a bit unacceptable to say that this room is carefully designed by the designer, especially at night, the lighting feels quite scary ( See picture)
The third is the free laundry service, which washed my T-shirt from size XL to size M...
The fourth is that the free luggage delivery service is a bit too rude. The mouth of the school bag I received was almost open... (Maybe it was because the uncle ran over too hard...)
The last one is that the coffee shop does not have many self-service items, and the breakfast noodles are basically gone in one bite.
To be honest, a room worth 2,000 yuan could be better.

msg:It was my first time to travel to Xiamen, so I booked a hotel on the island called Humble Hall. It should be said to be the number one hotel in Xiamen. The overall space is secretive and casual, and the environment is really impressive. It is very exquisite and at the same time has the local cultural and historical characteristics. Secondly, both the service and the restaurant are in line with the taste. The most important thing is that the afternoon tea is also very authentic. The butler also invited us to sit down and have a tea break first. It felt like getting together with old friends. Next time we go to the island, we can also I want to go to the Red Hall again and visit my "friends" again.

This hotel provided all the amenities I expected, the location was very central and the rooms were very clean and tastefully decorated which made our trip even more enjoyable.
The butler service is excellent and always ready to help. I highly recommend Hongtang Hotel. I will come back again next time I come to Gulangyu Island.

A housekeeper will contact you when you make a reservation, and a little brother will help you carry your luggage when you arrive at the pier. There are no electric cars on the island, so you can only carry it manually. Although the little brother is hardworking, he is still very enthusiastic.
There is tea service in the lobby and free afternoon tea is also provided. The breakfast is also delicious, with a choice of staple dishes, and other fruits, yogurt, bread, etc. are also available in the buffet. The room is clean and tidy, and there is a Bose Bluetooth speaker. It can be seen that every detail has been carefully considered. Even if there was a small problem with the table at night, the housekeeper would handle it immediately. My mother was very satisfied and praised it full of praise. She thought it was well worth the money. A very great stay experience, highly recommended! I personally thought it was the best B&B in Gulangyu Island!

msg:Surprised, amazing. I originally decided to stay in the Red Hall for one night before returning to Xiamen. I went into the courtyard and drank a cup of hot tea, went to the coffee shop to drink a cup of American style, lingered back and forth in the courtyard for a while, and decided to stay another night. The in-place service and exquisiteness in every corner make you feel at home and everything is going well. The service is better than the expensive cliff hotel I stayed in Bali before. Free breakfast, afternoon tea, and drinks are all available. They are more advanced and thoughtful than hotels and guesthouses of the same level, and the price is super high.
The style of the homestay is also my favorite. It pays attention to the decoration of details, just right, and has an elegant ascetic style. The red hall in the twilight is more beautiful, and the warm lights are quiet and warm, attracting me from afar.

There are people at the ferry port to pick up the station, but since Gulangyu is purely walking on two feet, the guy who picks up the station pushes the luggage in front and walks like flying. We chase after with all our strength. pick up station. There is tea and snacks in the lobby, and the waiters speak softly, giving people a refreshing feeling.
The focus is on the room. The decoration is simple but not simple. The stay is comfortable. The pillow set is the most comfortable, the quilt is the driest, and the air conditioner is the quietest night. There are desserts in the evening and freshly cooked noodles for breakfast in the morning.
A little suggestion: there is a pick-up station but no drop-off station, giving everyone the feeling of taking tea to cool down. It is suggested to increase the drop-off service, so that guests can add more warmth to their memories.

msg:The environment is very good, and the service of the male clerk is also quite good, especially "Master Li" patiently and enthusiastically helping to deliver the luggage to the pier. The breakfast is also very rich and the environment is beautiful.
But the check-in experience was very, very bad. First, the sound insulation of the room is poor. Although earplugs are prepared in the room, you can still hear the sound of the opposite steel pipe if you wear earplugs during the lunch break, and it will be uncomfortable to sleep with earplugs. Difficult for those who want to rest after a tiring morning catching a flight. Second, even if the air conditioner is turned on silently, the wind direction will blow directly on the bed, and the wind direction cannot be adjusted. Third, it is not very safe. The key design of the guest room is old and beautiful, but it is easy for outsiders to pry open the door. Fourth, there is a big problem with the water bath facilities in the bathroom, or it is suddenly very hot, and there is no response after adjusting the cold water for a long time, so that I have to wash my hair with mineral water halfway through the bath. Fifth, the attitude of the girl with short hair and the auntie in the restaurant at the time of check-in and subsequent service in the restaurant are very aloof. Obviously the guests are also very polite, but it seems that they owe them, and they do not have a good sense of service. Sixth, the aunt at the Red Pig restaurant downstairs came up to the restaurant at around 10:30 in the morning to use her kettle in front of two tables of guests to pick up the coffee from the coffee machine for the guests, which was quite shocking. I think hotels at this price should not only have unique features and beautiful decoration, but also pay more attention to the internal living experience of customers and the training of staff quality!

It is no exaggeration to say that it is the best chiffon cake I have ever eaten. The good night sweet soup at night is also very attentive. Let me talk about what I think is insufficient: 1. The water pressure is not stable. When taking a bath, it will be high and low for a while, and it will be cold and hot for a while. 2. There is no main light source in the room, all are ambient light sources. At night, the room can be a bit too dark. In addition, the bathroom in my room is a dark room without windows, so it will be very dark during the day.

The bathroom is less than two square meters. It’s so small that you can’t install it at the door, you can only use cloth curtains instead. The price/performance ratio is very low. I guess the hotels on the island are like this, but if the room price is nearly 2,000, you can choose Conrad Qishang outside the island. Isn’t it good?
2. There are not enough breakfast tables. There are only three tables in more than a dozen guest rooms. The other seats are open-air without air conditioning. In the end, there is no way to share a table with other guests. There are still guests who need to wait for the table. The room is not full that day , The dining experience is so bad that I can't remember how the breakfast tastes at all. I just want to leave early after eating. There are loopholes in the early planning of the entire hotel. Both the guest room and the restaurant are too small, and there is no comfort except for taking pictures. a feeling of

The light in the bathroom is dim, and there is no sofa in the guest room, but a large broom is hung facing the bed, which can be used for meditation at night.
The breakfast and dinner space is small, the content is very simple, the seafood noodles are good, the fried eggs are not zero, they are fried in advance, whether you like old or tender, reverse or double-sided, omelette or scrambled eggs, no cheese.
In the check-in lobby, no matter how stuffy the weather is and the air conditioner is not turned on, it takes more than ten minutes to walk from the pier to the hotel. I am already sweating. At least give customers a cool space to recuperate. The damp smell from the outdoor alley has entered the lobby. The guest room building was the same, the door was always open. And there are many mosquitoes. Lock the gates at night, and you have to ring the doorbell or call the housekeeper when you come back. I feel that the island is not very safe. It is easy for outsiders to come in and steal things.

The hotel contacted me the day before check-in, and added WeChat to confirm the time to go to the island. On the day of arrival, two butlers greeted me when I got off the boat. One accepted our luggage, and the other handed melon tea. Carried it for me, and thoughtfully prepared two parasols. I introduced it all the way from Neicuoao Wharf. When I passed the Gulangyu Contemporary Art Center, I said that the "Forty Years of Chinese Photography" photography exhibition is being held here. If you want to go to the hotel Tickets are provided (tickets are 58 per person, the tour fee is 158/person, and the expenses are all paid by the hotel), and we went to see it the next day. Although we are not photography enthusiasts, it is still worth visiting.
After I arrived at the hotel, I didn’t have lunch until after 1:00. I planned to go to the Red Pig to eat. After the housekeeper heard about it, he asked the front desk to send me the order code. The luggage was put in the room by someone, so I went to the Red Pig for lunch. Checked out the next day and had another meal, highly recommended!
The room is a bit small for those of us with two big suitcases, because our journey is relatively long and we have a lot of luggage. Generally speaking, if you go to the island with less luggage, it’s okay. I really like the style of the room, it’s so high-end!
The afternoon tea and breakfast the next day are both exquisite and delicious! I just feel that the time in the Red Hall flies too fast!
I will come to Gulangyu again next time to live in the Red Hall!

msg:Very good! stay

Facilities: The hotel is located on Gulangyu Island. It was originally built for Christians to gather on weekends. It is constructed of red bricks and wood, and the frame is very beautiful! The current hotel was remodeled in 2009. I asked the housekeeper about the history of the house, and learned that the owner followed the idea of repairing the old as it was, with overall reinforcement + reviewing the history (the old owner’s father seems to be a relatively simple way of practicing Christianity, Life is about simplicity) Therefore, please cooperate with the designers in Xiamen to build the overall concise, clean, retro and peaceful environment of the Red Hall. I personally like the design of the room very much. There are antique renovations and custom-made furniture. It is equipped with a le labo bath set and a dyson hair dryer. It has retro beauty and the convenience of life provided by modern technology hhh
[Favorite place] The small foyer on the second floor: a window facing the yard, an old table, and a few picture albums. The content is very interesting and the location is very comfortable. One day when I was waiting for breakfast, I read books there for a while, especially Quiet and comfortable, gaining short-term inner peace and happiness.
[About sound insulation] Before booking the money, I saw a friend talking about the sound insulation of the house. My personal experience is as follows. Because it is not a special holiday, there are almost no children. We did not feel too active in the overall guest room. Everyone was very quiet and did not disturb each other. The adjacent alleyway is Fair Road. Originally there were not many tourists. One night, some tourists passed by late. It was a bit noisy, but they left in about 5 minutes, and there was no too much noise after that. If you are really sensitive to sound, you can actually communicate with the store or housekeeper to see if you can book a room facing the courtyard on the 2nd and 3rd floors.

Hygiene: clean and beautiful! The cotton cloth of the bed sheets is very soft and delicate, the room is also bright and clean, and the bathroom is well planned! The supporting yard, red pig restaurant and breakfast tea room are also very comfortable!

Environment: I like it very much. Personally, I prefer quiet places, especially places for rest. The overall a**osphere here is very quiet. Compared with the more lively neighborhood of Sanqiutian, Neicuo'ao is an area where old residents live. If you want to think or sleep well during leisure, I really recommend this place! p.s. I really like the [Second-floor Porch] mentioned above and I also like the [Garden Bench].

Service: I must praise [the butler]! I didn't find out until the review that I didn't remember the name of the housekeeper, sorry! The last time I came to Xiagu as a child, my memory was a lot messy, and I asked the housekeeper many questions about money, and he answered them clearly for us one by one. When boarding the boat, they also communicated with us by phone in advance to determine the exit direction. On the way to the hotel, the history and cultural background of the island and the hotel are also carefully introduced, so that guests can quickly understand the local situation. The housekeepers and staff I met after staying in the hotel were very kind, willing to provide answers, and very patient. Full marks for service!
We have been traveling for a long time and have a lot of luggage. The store kindly invited a porter to help carry the luggage, which greatly relieved the fatigue of carrying luggage. I am very grateful 👍🏻.

[About breakfast] You can choose noodles or rice. If I have a bad stomach, I choose noodles, which are very warm. There are also small side dishes, fried spring rolls or dumplings. The buffet has bread, yogurt, coffee, tea, and fruit. There is a piece of bread with chia seeds that is delicious, especially grass😂. The breakfast room is a wood + glass house that was built later. You can see the mountains and the blue sky and white clouds not far away. Coupled with the beautiful scenery of the yard, the mood is very open.
[About afternoon tea] The check-in gift includes an afternoon tea meal. We arrived late on the first day, so the housekeeper specially extended it to the second day for us, thank you! The taste is very good~sponge cake with salted butter, toasted hazelnut kernels are delicious, and coconut pudding, QQ bouncy~
[Red Pig Restaurant] The hotel's own restaurant, please ask the butler to help you reserve a seat. The restaurant is small and has the feel of a family-style restaurant. I ordered [Red Pork Braised Pork Rice, Abalone Bak Kut Teh, Salt Baked Luncheon Fish, Garlic Shark Lips, and Boiled Choy Heart] and they were all delicious! Not to praise one by one, in short, my family and I are full, and we just go out at night and take a long walk.
The only thing I encountered was a little trouble when I was eating. I met a family with a large number of people eating, so the small restaurant was not very convenient to move around, and it was a little noisy. Fortunately, the food was hot and delicious, so I was not very unhappy. .

[Final addition] Hongtang has its own official account, you can check it in, there are surprises! Visiting the characteristic route is also very informative! Thanks to Hongtang, the housekeeper and all the staff, I like this stay very much, furniture, home decoration, tableware, food, house and people I met, hope to see you again!

Before going to the island, the guide had already contacted and waited at the Sanqiutian Wharf as soon as the boat left. After arriving, there will be winter melon tea prepared for free.

msg:The first time I went to Gulangyu Island, I came here specifically for the Red Hall. We walked for 10 minutes after getting off the boat. The wind on the island was extremely strong, and it was all uphill. The little brother who picked up the luggage wanted to fly. We were so tired that my husband and I had no expectations at all and just wanted to lose our temper. Fortunately, I didn't bring a suitcase, otherwise it would be even more tiring.

The design of the hotel, the sense of ceremony, and the catering are really hard to choose. The housekeeper also communicated with us softly. These impressions are very good. The details really make up for everything. Otherwise, I really miss the 10-minute walk on the island. Make a bad review! There is also a very good detail. There are a lot of people on the island during the peak season, but the hotel is not open to the public, only guests can enter, so the only tranquility is maintained, otherwise it is really manic. I originally planned to book two nights on the 2nd and 3rd, but we couldn't book on the 2nd, which made our schedule very rushed and affected some experience. Overall experience: worth living once.

A butler with wit and high emotional intelligence is the face of a high-end hotel. The boss has a unique vision in selecting people. The level of the glasses butler is at the ceiling level. He is neither humble nor overbearing, has a sense of propriety and details, and his personal quality is very good. I give it 120 points, because he put everything you may need but haven't thought of in front of the guests 👍🏼The seamless thoughtfulness is really admirable!
The tea from Hongtang, the aromatherapy from Xiashan, and Songtsam’s photo albums are all highlights that are still fresh in my memory, and I bought a lot of them as souvenirs.
I won’t repeat the good reviews and repeated pictures mentioned by others. Those who pursue quality and details are right to come to Hongtang. Only you can’t think of it, and there is nothing they can’t provide. With this price, I strongly recommend it. !
ps. add
There is no dust at the bedside of the window
The public cups in the hall are equipped with disinfection cabinets, and there is no trace of water wiped by the housekeeper
No one mentioned toothpaste in other reviews? Japanese Haoyue. The teapot is made by Aizawa Kobo in Japan, and the earplugs are 3M. I took it away and used it on the plane. It is full of details! !

msg:Returning to the hotel from the crowded streets of Gulangyu Island, there is a feeling of tranquility in the world. The hotel's afternoon tea, sweet but not greasy cakes, and a cup of black tea with milk tea are the correct way to open Gulangyu Island.
The downside is that because it is during the Spring Festival, the food supply is obviously not sufficient, whether it is afternoon tea or breakfast, there are empty plates and no ingredients to replenish. And even if you make an appoin**ent for breakfast, there are still no seats. Although there are vacancies outside, the wind on Gulangyu Island in winter is really fatal, and there is no way to eat outdoors.
Finally, as mentioned above, you must prepare a hat or scarf and wrap your head when you go to the island, otherwise you will be blown by the wind and doubt your life.

The decoration is in the style of the Republic of China, with taste. Black and white with simple classic. The water provided is Evian, and the hair dryer is from Dyson. The B&B has 13 rooms and occupies a large area. There is a mini venue where you can hold a wedding or something. There are two huge banyan trees in the yard, which are very refreshing.
The breakfast is simpler, which is unmatched by all homestays and hotels. But living in a homestay just likes its tone, haha.
The bedding is very good and the pillows are of the right height.
It's not very convenient to eat around, you need to walk some distance. The chairs in the room were uncomfortable.
Good service, waiters are polite.

Many people visit Gulangyu, and they are always in a hurry, so it is easy to overlook and miss a lot of the real beauty and taste of Gulangyu. Therefore, the most comfortable way to play on Gulangyu is to find a quality hotel and stay for a day or two.

msg:The appearance, rooms, meals, services, and bedding all exceeded expectations.
design. I have never stayed in a hotel with such attention to detail, not even in the Pu series. It can be said that the scenery is everywhere, and it is a painting wherever it is shot. You can stay in a corner of the hotel late at night and early morning, and enjoy this beauty quietly. There are a total of 13 rooms, the space is not large, but they are used as well as possible, which makes people feel very convenient.
texture. The floor of the viewing platform is small gravel, the welcome card is pressed with stone paperweight, the leather tissue box, the ceramics for the tea tableware, the Go chess beside the tea seat, the cotton curtains, the metal window hooks...all and Echoes the relative stillness of the hotel.
meal. Afternoon tea, chiffon, pudding and fruit, the taste is delicate, the plate is exquisite, and the portion is just right. The breakfast is a semi-buffet with pre-dinner salad, toast, homemade yogurt, seafood baked rice or noodles. No heavy seasoning, fresh and natural.
Serve. The handsome little brother came to pick up the station at the pier and handed me winter melon tea. After arriving at the front desk, he rested in the beautiful lobby. The front desk prepared hand wipes, iced tea, and snowflakes to help guests check in.
Guest room: Facilities Panasonic toilet seat, nathome kettle, Dyson hair dryer, Oral B toothpaste, Evian water are all my favorites, and laundry detergent is also prepared. The cloakroom is small but functional. The windows are retro, love the way the wind is rolling the curtains.

These are all external.

The most precious thing is that there is a magical power that makes people calm down.

A good place recommended by friends ~ Hongtang Hotel, on Gulangyu Island, with a quiet location, an elegant environment and a full sense of design. You can take photos of all kinds.
Meals make you linger. A good day starts with breakfast, which is rich in variety, sweet or savoury (Figure 8-9). After three o'clock, about a cup of coffee + pastries, enough to let you kill the hot afternoon tea time. There is also the "Red Pig" canteen that will be launched soon (I didn't catch up this time, I will think about it next time).
During the epidemic, I can't leave the building. It's too much to come to Hongtang for a little vacation, and I want to lie in a daze. .

It can be seen that the owner of the hotel is making a homestay with his heart, hoping to keep it going. The hotel's toiletries are very high-end, mineral water Evian, hair dryer Dyson. The most important thing is that the free winter melon tea and desserts are also delicious😋. Service personnel did not reduce the quality of service due to the epidemic.

msg:Gulangyu Island was scorching hot in summer, away from the noisy tourist routes, and found this quaint building at a cool corner to enjoy the cool, so we immediately decided to live on the island.
The original site is a church that was built in 1936. The entire building rests on a huge rock. Therefore, the stone engraved nameplate of the building is engraved with the words "I will build on this rock". The overall hotel is based on the wood style, with a touch of woody smell in it. The color and taste make people feel that they have passed through the 1930s in an instant, which is very experience. The courtyard behind the hotel is enveloped by banyan trees. When sitting in a daze, you can see the different scenery of Gulangyu Island.
The various small details of the hotel make people feel full of experience. The copper keys and mechanical locks, and various small ornaments can appreciate the intentions of the operators and fit the original identity of the hotel. Under the seemingly simple appearance of the room, the bedding and disposable products are of high quality. The hair dryer is a full set of Dyson. I like the sandalwood fragrance of the toiletries very much. I bought the same style when I came back.
The hotel provides a hearty afternoon tea with a wealth of desserts and drinks. The breakfast is divided into Chinese and Western styles. You can choose by yourself. It is also very hearty. I have the best bowl of seafood noodles I have eaten in Xiamen.
I met the proprietress at afternoon tea, and we had a very happy conversation. During the conversation, I also understood the concept of this hotel, such as the inscription on the key-"The relative stillness of an island". In fact, in addition to exploring new things, the trip itself hopes to keep good memories. Life is hurried, and stopping has become a luxury, but there is always a place where you can stop. It was like that day at the corner of the hotel entrance, we who were forced to stop by the heat, looked up and found the beauty and tranquility here.

msg:紅堂是我住過的，十分少數，實際比網圖要更好的民宿。雖然紅堂的價格在島上算高的，但是真的非常值得來體驗。我在島上待了兩個晚上，但是非常不明智的去體驗了另一家民宿……我非常後悔沒在紅堂住兩天。
設施：看得出來，紅堂所有的傢俱和潔具都十分考究，傢俱的形式美感非常突出，器具與擺件選擇的非常剋制又呼應主題。潔具我非常驚喜的看到了飛機頭，復古又有質感。床墊舒適，床品無異味。洗浴用品和吹風機都是很棒的品牌。硬裝部分細節也很過關。
衞生：房間內所有金屬龍頭、把手都沒有明顯指紋和水痕。床鋪上無毛髮。傢俱枱面無明顯灰塵。
環境：公共區域每個角落都很乾凈整潔。讓我記憶深刻的是那天晚上我們從外面回來，看到庭院的椅子旁點了星星點點的蠟燭。庭院裏沒人，有風，燭光搖曳。我想，主理人應該是個很浪漫的人吧。
服務：可以説紅堂的一半是環境品質，另一半就是服務了。每個服務人員都非常nice，但很特別的是，每個人都性格鮮明讓我記憶猶新。就……應該不是那種很制式的管理，每個人都能保留自身性格的同時做好服務，讓我感到很親切和舒服。
我對紅堂的喜愛可能寫不完，接船的靦腆小弟弟，嚴肅認真的前台大高個，送我們上樓的愛笑小妹妹，打掃庭院的親切大姐，真的超級好吃的下午茶，晚上差點錯過的甜湯，房間的手工茶，超用心的早餐……寫着寫着，突然閃回那個冬日的午後，兩個剛忙完的小妹妹擦了擦手，坐在咖啡館前的長條凳上笑嘻嘻的在聊什麼的畫面。一陣軟綿的風吹過，她們髮絲飛舞，有衹小貓在腳邊懶洋洋的眯着眼，我可能在這一瞬間知道了什麼是“Stay still，一座島嶼的相對靜止。”
下次我要再來呀（*¯︶¯*）

本來也是沒當回事，結果發現旁邊桌子兩個女生，上的兩份沙拉和小食……我問他為什麼別人是兩份，我們是一份，他説因為對方的房型是什麼家庭房，就得給2份沙拉，我説“訂房首頁兩個房型明明都寫的兩份早餐，沒有差別”，他説“我們不在網站上寫那麼清楚，而且他們的房間是最貴的。”真是越來越聽不下去，啥意思所以吃不飽是錢沒花到的問題嗎？！？我説那為什麼剛才我要填一份主食，你説看看有沒有材料，出來就説超時了不給了，我問你的時候就已經超時了，他説的更無語“對的因為過時間了，你加的話我還得重新去準備食材和做”……好吧，所以就是有材料不給做了？那能不能培訓一下，好一點的話術，下次就告訴我廚師下班了，至少不會這麼讓人無語。
講真的好酒店住多了，基本到哪裡，早餐快到時間的時候，服務員都會問一下我們閉餐了要不要再填點什麼……真不是吃不上一份飯就怎麼地，就是，答對的話讓人太不舒服了。據説已經在當地做到口碑最好了，拜託加強一下服務管理吧。

第二天退房送行李的環節我不知道酒店老闆是怎麼想的，我們自己出錢送行李。如果不是管家服務好不忍心給低分，也許給不到5分。

衞生：剛入住的時候正常，但這個客房打掃是真的敷衍啊，衹管收垃圾就完事兒了，拖鞋不給新的，你得自己去拿，洗漱不給補充新的，抽紙也是不補充的，就是一切你得多一句嘴要，就很讓人迷惑。為什麼酒店配置都是很用心的有品味的小眾品牌，但是服務卻是小家子氣扣扣搜搜的，我衹能定義為保潔人員個人行為了。

環境：整體設計都是不錯的，重點在下面👇🏻哦

服務：這個真的要好好嘮一嘮了～從一開始碼頭接客到酒店check in時的服務都極度舒適，讓人感覺友好的同時又很放鬆舒適，晚上還有甜湯提供，到第二天早上為止，不管是酒店的氛圍香還是工作人員的服務都讓人覺得這個酒店贊且有品。

好了，炸裂的事情來了，第二天一早去吃早餐，九點開餐的時候幾乎什麼都沒準備好，一共就兩個服務員在，一個男生在廚房埋頭苦幹，一個帶着迷之優越感的***在外面點餐，問她點兒啥都是一種奢侈品店裡sales的那種高貴感，並且手腳毛糙，泡個茶開水撒一地，***！她就好像是這個酒店所有經過良好培訓的員工裏特例獨行的那一條漏網之魚，讓人感覺很割裂，為什麼要成為一顆老鼠屎壞了一鍋湯，其他所有員工的努力全部被浪費，營造的氛圍被瞬間破壞。

經過這位高貴女士的努力，明明是付過費的自助早餐，硬生生吃出了一種被施捨放飯的感覺，真是太優秀了！在這樣的酒店工作真是屈才了，應該去善堂救濟施粥的，既能充分體會施捨於人所帶來的快感，又能彰顯您高貴的身份，多好～

雖然但是，總的來説，這個酒店還是很不錯的，起碼除了那個***的女士，其他所有人都是非常nice的，特別是前台小姐姐，不光完成自己的工作還要給高貴大姐擦屁股，u should feel sorry and say thank u to your coworker～peace✌🏿

msg:優點：
1 前台和幾位管家態度很好有耐心
2 房間風格喜歡 表面上看起來各處夠乾淨
3 酒店自己的茶飲 水 洗漱用品質量不錯
4 早餐和下午茶都好吃
5 餐廳音樂品味好

缺點：
1 沒有穿衣鏡
2 打掃沒有更換新拖鞋，浴室沒疏通造成第二天堵塞
3 衹帶了手機充電線但房間充電必須帶插頭
4 酒店之外配備的藍瓶礦泉水太難喝了
5 房間燈光太暗很壓抑
6 早餐開餐時間太晚（8點）上餐大概需要20分鐘 如果以為度假就是要睡懶覺就太主觀了 沒有考慮到早起人和老年人的生活作息和需求

整個過程完全體會到——舒適優雅，非網紅民宿之流。
唯一略遺憾的是，在島上如果酒店範圍不夠大，容易侷促、周圍其它在建工地廢料之類影響感觀，尤其相距很近的別家民宿真的好吵鬧-_-||
酒店或許可以考慮配置降噪耳機什麼的。

msg:疫情後的超短途休假
20幾天的防疫封控，把所有廈門人憋的夠嗆，解封后我和老婆決定去體驗一下耳聞已久的高端民俗--紅堂。
最初的印象，還是幾年前，同學住過之後，回來反饋很好。19年開始，老闆用近兩年的時間對紅堂進行了重新裝修，據説有很多專業團隊參與，所以十分期待呀。
暖
平台下單後，第二天就有管家添加微信，告知一些登島和入住細節，不論是幾點或是哪個碼頭，管家都會來迎接。重點來了，我們與管家見面後，管家給我們送上兩瓶冰鎮冬瓜茶，也太太太太暖了吧，這對於舟車勞頓的旅人來説，就像是久旱逢甘露般的貼心啊。之後的入住、就餐、離店，這種暖人心田的舉動，不勝枚舉啊。
細
對於一家衹有13間客房的民俗來説，用兩年時間翻新，其用心程度和對細節的極致要求可見一斑。紅堂的陳設都非常具有場景感和戲劇性，可以用一隅一景來形容，彷彿衹要有人入畫，就是一部大片。提醒大家多帶幾套衣服，室內室外咔咔就是一頓狂拍，特別出片。搓澡巾、牙線、自製茶包、歡迎水果、帶小剪刀的針線包... ...你想不到的，紅堂也都為你準備好了。
木
紅堂的室內主要以實木為原料，地板、牆圍、櫃子、門、床... ...就連室內香氛和浴室備品都是木質調的，Le Labo的SANTAL33洗浴用品簡直就是檀香愛好者的YYDS。
香
因為我們定的是一個套餐，裏麪包含了正餐和下午茶，紅堂供應的午晚餐是比較地道的閩南古早味美食加之一些改良版東南亞菜品，強烈推薦鹵肉飯和黑白切，一個字來形容就是‘真香’。除了吃的香，睡的也很香，床墊軟硬適度，應該可以滿足大部分旅人對床墊的要求，枕頭有三種‘羽絨枕、記憶棉枕、蕎麥枕’，總有一款適合你。
暢
從碼頭到紅堂的路程比較順暢，不會太遠，大約步行十來分鐘就可以到達。紅堂所在位置算是鼓浪嶼的中心位置，地勢相對較高，加之老別墅自身的高度，你可以在二樓的大露台或者是三樓的小露台遠眺，早上起床伴着悦耳的鳥叫聲，都會讓你的心情變得開朗舒暢。
煥然一新的紅堂還有很多細節值得你親自體驗和發掘，stay still，ta一直在那裡等你。

msg:可能是因為住了聆是酒店有了對比，紅堂全鼓浪嶼最貴的一家酒店感受反而非常一般，地理位置無論從哪個方向走，都會經過各種墓地，建築就是老式的上海洋房樣式，內部昏暗還算考究，但是服務比較生硬，尤其是連下一家幾點到都不清楚就要求客户必須在12點前退房，非常不人性化，吃早餐的地方景色也不好，全是建築工地風景，屋子很小也沒有幾張桌子，大冬天還要在外面吃飯，聆海離開的時候店家特意發訊息詢問體驗感受，這家就是一鎚子買賣，再也不會去
