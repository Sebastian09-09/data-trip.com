msg:We’ve always been intrigued by this hotel. We enjoyed the rich history of the place. This is reflected by the intricate details found throughout the hotel—beautiful wood parquet, stained glass, etc. Our room was great, and the bathroom has luxe sundries and facilities (Dyson hairdryer, heated toilet seat, bidet). Included in our room is the access to the Executive Lounge, which offers beverages (canned drinks, a bottle of red and white wine, a bottle of liquor, coffee and tea) and an assortment of packaged snacks, biscuits, and pastries. We didn’t take the tour because they don’t offer it in English. The breakfast was just ok.

It was a good experience.

msg:The hotel is very good. It is not my first time there. I really chose it again because it was nice, though I can't understand why in the both time the front desk suggested to give us an upgrade to an attic room. The previous time I accepted, but apparently the room was so narrow and I didn't like it. Maybe others like it, it is just my opinion. The second time when I went they also suggested this upgrade but we preferred to stay in the room we chose. They were very helpful and nice

I stayed there and felt absolutely spoilt. The staff are so friendly and the environment is rich in history, well maintained and peaceful. 

Book way in advance as there are not may rooms in this hotel. It has a restaurant, many lounge areas, and a beautiful garden where you can enjoy your coffee in the morning. 

Being in this hotel feels like a step back in time due to its classical features. Despite it is a very old mansion, it was restored into a unique and elegant boutique hotel.

The soundproofing of the room was really poor. At night, people walking upstairs made a lot of noise, and I was woken up by groups of people at around 7 o'clock in the morning. Fortunately, the hotel's breakfast was online, rich and delicious. The overall quality of the waiters was very good, but there were rotten leaves and garbage scattered everywhere in the garden, and all kinds of tools were piled up everywhere. It was a pity for this beautiful garden, and it took effort to clean and maintain it. In short, you can come to Mahler Villa to check in and take pictures, but the accommodation is really not comfortable.

I didn't fall asleep until I killed it. The package I bought included a dinner for two, which was great and tasted great. The doorman and the front desk were very considerate.

Shanghai has many European-style buildings. I personally think that you must experience living in a historical site once in your life. After all, the opportunity is rare. Villa Mahler is a 90-year-old garden villa that combines European and Asian styles. It has also been authoritatively rated as one of the "Ten Most Classic Works of Architectural Design in the 20th Century" by the European Architects and Design Association. This is the most expensive hotel in the entire trip, and it’s also the most check-in hotel. I don’t want to check out at all.

🚇Transportation: Take Metro Line 1 to Nanjing West Road Station, Exit 12, and walk for about ten minutes.

🤵🏻Service: There were welcome snacks and fruits when we checked in, but we arrived too late and didn't enjoy them. When leaving, the staff also gave two packs of handmade biscuits and villa-shaped magnets to each room guest. If there were children, toys were given as well, which was really thoughtful.

🏛️Environment: There are two main buildings, namely Building 1, which is mainly a hotel room and a restaurant building in No. 2. There are two outdoor gardens, one is near the restaurant with a large green lawn, and the other is a maze on the periphery. type lawn. The exterior is a three-story Nordic Gothic architectural style, with Norwegian spires and Gothic spires. The exterior walls are made of ocher yellow refractory bricks. The interior is mainly made of wood, with heavy-weight mahogany tables, chairs, and candlesticks. With palace-style crystal chandeliers, stained glass on the indoor dome, Chinese glazed tiles, and many exquisite Chinese porcelain plate decorations, the design theme of combining Chinese and Western elements creates a picturesque scenery in Shanghai!

🏠Room: Superior King Room HK$1,397.04/one night + buffet breakfast (original price)
The package includes free Minibar drinks, one tour of the castle (starting at 10 o'clock every day) and exquisite gifts. I was a little disappointed with the tour of the castle because there are not many facilities to visit, and the second and third floors are not open, which is a bit small. disappoin**ent.

The area of ​​the room is not very large, but the bathroom feels larger. The main color is green marble, which is very fresh and natural, but there is no place to hang clothes, which is a fly in the oin**ent. The interior decoration is mainly in palace style and has complete facilities, but it feels cramped because the dressing table in the middle is too big and separates the big bed and the entrance area, making the room feel cramped.

Although the hardware was not very matched with the price, the service was first-class. I took a mango for breakfast, and the waiter took the initiative to help cut it into small cubes. The 10 o'clock hotel tour activity is not particularly necessary. You can listen to it when you have time to learn more about some hotel stories and design details. It is quite casual. There are not many guest rooms in the main building. The main guest rooms are in the annex building, which was built later to imitate the main building. Personally, I think the exterior of the hotel is more beautiful than the inside.

They were all very good. The afternoon tea restaurant was stunningly beautiful. I will definitely stay in other guest rooms of this hotel next time. Each room is worth experiencing one by one.

msg:The hotel is amazing, both the exterior and interior are so charming. There were weddings held in the garden for two days. The location is also good, convenient to everything. There is free parking, and it is still free to pick up the car after checking out at 18:00 the next day. The toiletries are from L'Occitane. The minibar drinks on the first day include Evian, beer and Coke. There is a tour and explanation at 10:00. The only flaw is that you are not allowed to take pictures in Building 1, not even the guests. The camera does not have a flash, so it does not matter even if it is a cultural relic. I don't know why.

Let's talk about the unsatisfactory parts: First of all, there is really no sound insulation. I take care of my children by myself and I won't let them make noises at night. Can't the hotel remind me? I was woken up n times by the banging in the early morning. People with heart disease and poor sleep should avoid it... Secondly, the carpets and corners really need to be cleaned more. Also, the smell of the toilet comes out when you sleep at the head of the bed... Finally, the service attitude is really good, but the so-called activities and introductions don't seem to be well introduced...

msg:On a family trip to Shanghai, a family of three chose to stay for two nights at the Mahler Villa Hotel. They booked the most common room type in the hotel, a king-size bed room. After arriving, the hotel helped upgrade them to an executive king-size bed room for free, which is more spacious.
I arrived at the hotel at 1 pm and was told that I could only check in after 3 pm, so I left my luggage at the front desk and walked around to find food. I found a Yunnan restaurant called Nanmanzi on Dianping, which is not far from the hotel. I ordered the set meal of rice noodles with mushroom sauce, rose cake, and potato cake. The children loved it and ate a lot.
After the meal, we returned to the hotel to check in. When the front desk learned that we did not bring our own dental kits, they helped prepare disposable dental kits. A complimentary fruit and snacks were provided in the room. There were orange juice, cola and beer in the small refrigerator, all free of charge.
The hotel environment is great, and the lobby is stunning. The children like the panda dolls on the sofa. They play with the panda dolls in the lobby for a while after coming back from outside every day. The scenery in the garden is more beautiful, with small bridges, flowing water, small fish, and a few stray cats that are not afraid of guests. Children also like it very much. Check-in comes with free breakfast for two adults. Children are free. The breakfast tastes very good and the variety is moderate. I was really surprised to eat it on the first day. Bak Kut Teh, black pepper shrimp, fried rice, preserved egg and lean meat porridge taste great, and I am very full. .
The hotel is truly a quiet place in the middle of the hustle and bustle. It is located in the city center and the surrounding supporting facilities are very convenient. Traveling with children is basically a taxi. The natural history museum, shopping malls, and restaurants are basically within two kilometers. If you don’t bring children, you can definitely go there. Citywalk is nearby and Julu Road is next to it, so you can feel the urban a**osphere of Shanghai.
A villa-style refrigerator magnet was given as a gift when checking out. The service staff in the hotel would take the initiative to say hello and the service was very good. Bao’s dad said he would stay here next time he comes to Shanghai.

There is a bus stop at the door but there is only one bus and it is a bit far from the subway station. After checking in at the front desk of Building 2, the staff took the initiative to help with luggage.
Health: Overall health is good. It makes sense that it's not obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Facilities: The basic facilities are complete. Due to the old house, the location of some sockets is not ideal. If you like intelligence, don't book. I booked an elegant room in Building 1. Since the historical building does not have an elevator, the sound insulation is also very average. After all, the old house cannot be greatly modified.
Service: The security at the door is conscientious and the front desk service is super good and basically responds to all requests. The butler service in Building 1 is average in comparison. Upon check-in, the front desk staff will lead you to Building 1 and help you carry your luggage upstairs. When we checked out, we didn't bother the housekeeper to come up and get our luggage, but when one of us, the little girl, took the big suitcase downstairs, the housekeeper looked at us without any inquiry or action. During this period, I called the housekeeper's number starting with 6 but for some reason no one answered.

An extremely exquisite English-style manor, hidden around Julu Road. The hotel is divided into Building 1 and Building 2, both with guest rooms. Building No. 1 is Mahler’s original residence and has a history of almost 100 years! It is said that Mahler himself built the fairyland for his daughter, and every detail inside is exquisite to the extreme. Building No. 2 was built after 2000 and is now used as a guest room, but it replicates the exquisiteness of the old bungalow. The hotel facilities are traditional old school upscale hotel style. There are more breakfast dishes than I expected, a combination of Chinese and Western dishes, and the taste is also very good. The hotel is great for taking photos and checking in!

msg:The room was not big. Since it was a weekend and the hotel had wedding services, the room we were given was much worse than the one for the bride and groom. The front was blocked by trees.
Check-in included executive lounge privileges and a castle tour, and no one reminded us. I didn’t experience the castle tour at all.
The executive lounge was occupied by a wedding party. The cakes and snacks were all sold out. The coffee machine was also broken. Not many people came to take wedding photos. It was messy and noisy. Especially the photographers at the wedding were of extremely low quality. They took pictures of our children without our parents’ consent. There was also a photographer who turned off the lights and took away our children’s chairs for the purpose of taking pictures. , they were not returned to us after the photo was taken.
I asked the logistics to ask for two quilts, one for the four-year-old child, and one for each of the two adults. It was not too much, but the aunt actually gave me one quilt but refused to give me the second one. Her attitude was not good.
Hotels can use weddings to generate revenue, but the same room costs more than 4,000 a night, so you can't favor one thing over another. This kind of service and environment can cost up to 2,000 a night.
Breakfast was not good either, the juice was gone and was not replenished, there were very few dishes, and the wonton meat was not fresh. One person costs 108, which is about the same as someone else’s 68.
Although the front desk finally gave me a small gift as compensation, I have to say that it was still a four-star hotel when I checked in before, and now the five-star hotel is not as good as the original four-star service and environment.
The pictures uploaded are evidence that the environment is messy and the wedding is affecting hotel guests. In short, just to make money from your wedding, you can’t treat other guests as straw men.

msg:Came here to stay for two days on the weekend and enjoyed the trip very much.
Both the check-in environment and the service attitude of the staff are almost perfect🌹.

The hotel is equipped with an underground garage with ample parking spaces and is free for guests, which is very friendly for self-driving friends.

There are strict duty posts at the hotel gate. After entering, you will be asked whether you are a guest or others. You will be released with caution. The security work is reassuring.
On the way to the lobby, there will be a handsome welcome guy who will take the initiative to help you with your luggage. If you don't bring an umbrella and it happens to rain, he will hold an umbrella for you, which is very considerate👍🏻.

The hotel room is clean and hygienic. Out of personal habit, when checking into a new room, I will use disinfectant wipes to wipe the table, chair back, bedside table and other places again. After wiping the wipes this time, there is almost no dust.
It may be because the hotel I stayed in before the temperature dropped. Although it was a warm winter, the air conditioner was not used in the room these two days. The mirror in the bathroom has a heating function and the facilities are very sophisticated. It is warm and not easy to fog up when taking a shower. It makes the whole room very warm.

The breakfast quality is very good. In the restaurant on the first floor, the three hours of dining time are very ample and the location is sufficient. There are both Western and Chinese breakfasts. What surprised me the most was the fruit I ate this time. The pineapple was processed very well without any astringency. It was sweet and juicy in the mouth👍🏻
After the meal, usually around ten o'clock in the morning, a staff member will lead a tour and introduce the castle and the back garden that Mahler built for his daughter. They will also post some partial photos of the castle that were taken this time☺️. Come back next time~

After a while, the water sound subsided. I just fell asleep and called the front desk to ask if the sound was quiet. Can't sleep either. We went for the beautiful garden, but on the day we checked in, there was a wedding in the garden. We were not allowed to enter the garden. We also spent money on afternoon tea and could only sit indoors. The next morning I wanted to go shopping again, but it turned out that the hotel was laying lawn and there was construction debris everywhere. Why can't we choose a time in the middle of the week when there are fewer people, but we have to choose a time on the weekend when the occupancy rate is high. In the morning, it was said that there would be a hotel tour at 10 o'clock, but it started before 10 o'clock. The guide didn't say a few words, and his voice was very low. There were more than a dozen people around, and you couldn't hear anything if you were 1 meter away. I stayed in the hotel once and saw nothing. Bad review!

msg:Last week, I checked into the Peace Hotel, which is also a historic building. I compared them. Both are world-class in terms of hardware and humanities, but the difference in service is too big. The front desk of Mahler Villa would not greet guests and had a straight face without a smile. I checked in at 2:30, but was told that the room was not ready yet. Fair, I walked around and went back at 3:30. There were three families sitting in the lobby waiting for their rooms. There was only one employee named Li at the front desk at that time. There were several guests who had not checked in. I queued for a while and wanted to ask if the room was ready. After waiting for ten minutes, it was not my turn. At this time, an elderly guest cut in line to check in, so I asked the front desk directly if my room was ready. This Miss Li shouted loudly that I had to queue up. I said that I had already checked in and just wanted to know if the room was ready. Miss Li had no memory of my previous check-in. She asked me what my name was and had not followed up on my room situation before. I gave my name and then asked about the room on the intercom. She asked me to wait a moment. I asked if I could check out late the next day. She didn't answer with a straight face. I noticed that her hair was messy. I guess several guests were asking for it. It was not until 3:50 that she told me that the room was ready. There was no apology at all. It was completely the rhythm of the hotel bullying customers. The so-called executive lounge was a joke. There were no staff in the lounge. No one cleaned up after the guests finished eating. The only drinks promised were two unopened bottles of red and white wine in the refrigerator. Taobao searched and found that it was a buy-one-get-one-free deal for 98 yuan. There was no bottle opener. The housekeeper on the first floor was always playing with his mobile phone and looking at the computer. When he saw the guests didn't say hello, he turned a blind eye and was very indifferent, like a state-owned enterprise. In Anna's room, the smell of sewer was very strong. The hotel had been spraying strong perfume to cover it up, so the aromatherapy was unbearable for a while, and once the fragrance was gone, it was stinking. The sanitation was not in place. The cotton swabs used by previous guests were left in the bathroom, which was very disgusting. At night, the guests next door were making noise in the bridal chamber until midnight. The soundproofing was poor. In the early morning, there were two big gaps in the curtains of the doors and windows, and there was no curtain on the glass door of the bathroom. The glaring sunlight made it impossible to sleep.

msg:I rarely give bad reviews to hotels. This stay was extremely disappointing. I have stayed at the East Lake Hotel in the same location and area and everything was very smooth. If anyone is choosing between these two hotels, I recommend staying at the East Lake Hotel.
Let’s talk about a few aspects. The basic room type at Mahler Hotel starts from 1,000 yuan. You think you are living in a cultural protection unit, but in fact you are living in a newly built Building 2 based on the appearance of Building 1, which is similar to the cultural relics. There is no contact with the unit. But the strange thing is that since it is a new building, the entire hotel is extremely not soundproofed. The soundproofing condition is not as good as Atour. I think it is more like a lower-grade express hotel. In the early morning, the bells of the school next to it are ringing one after another, and then there are the bells in the corridor. The sound of door closing and the sound of people passing by. I have never stayed in such a bad hotel in the thousand dollar range. Secondly, the bathroom is also very small, very similar to the accommodation standard of two to three hundred yuan, and no toiletries are provided.
When I checked in yesterday afternoon, I waited for more than half an hour and then decided to store my luggage. When I came back at 10pm, the front desk informed me that our water supply had been cut off, but you could not check out of the hotel. Later, when I strongly requested to check out, I was told that the hotel had water reserves, which would not affect washing. But when I washed up at 11 o'clock, the water temperature was only over 20 degrees, and no one answered the phone to the front desk.
I really recommend if you really want to stay here. Just book Building 1, at least for the sense of history, otherwise it is better to move to other style hotels. There are too many interesting and fun hotels with good service attitude in the surrounding area.

msg:Mahler's villa is a garden villa with a Nordic style. It took nearly 10 years to build based on a magical dream of Mahler's daughter.
 The villa is divided into Building 1 and Building 2. It is a very dreamy castle, and Mahler's deep love for his daughter is fully reflected!

“Fariy land”

As soon as you enter the door, you can see the villa full of fairy tale colors, with Norwegian-style spiers, Gothic spires, and Chinese-style glazed tiles. There is a bronze statue of Mahler’s beloved horse at the door! The walls of the villa are paved with refractory bricks, and the roof is topped with yellow-green Chinese glazed tiles. There are precious flowers and trees such as cypress and cedar in the garden. There is a lawn in the middle. Wedding events will be held in the garden on weekends!

It is worth coming to experience the castle-style hotel. There will be explanations at 10 o'clock every day, so you will have a deeper understanding and feeling of this castle!

But I would like to make some comments about the hotel’s breakfast buffet: Why use some Cantonese morning tea dishes? You should use more authentic Western refreshments or simply stick to local Shanghai cuisine. For me, a customer from Guangdong, your Cantonese tea snacks, porridge, etc. are not authentic and delicious, but also distracting. There is absolutely no need to provide them.

I spent more than 3,000 to stay in the most expensive luxury room. After breakfast, I wanted to take two pictures on the lawn. I was not allowed in. If you want to say that you can’t enter even if you are maintaining the lawn, then I can understand. After all, the lawn is so bald. However, there was a lawn wedding just the day before. There were so many chairs and so many guests could walk around. I wanted to take a few photos after the meal and they were not allowed in. In the end, I was asked to "ask for permission" from their boss, and got a reply saying permission. I changed from high heels to slippers and finally got in. I don’t know if I was treated differently because I didn’t spend as much money as someone who held a wedding, or because the bride, groom, and guests all wore slippers for the wedding? The service in the entire hotel is basically non-existent. I have to come down and pick up things myself when I pick them up. When I pick them up, I am asked what room number it is, as if they are afraid that I am sneaking in to take pictures. Anyway, the experience is very poor and the price is expensive. The price-performance ratio is very low. It is not recommended to stay here. Just take photos on the overpass outside.

Like a charming European castle, the walls are inlaid with colorful glazed bricks. It's beautiful under the lights at night. Full of Mahler's love for his daughter.
This is the beginning of my first night in Shanghai with my mother and daughter. I hope they can feel my love.
The hotel is very close to Changle Road, Sinan Road, Wukang Road and other places. If you like to visit the former residences and buildings of famous people, you can choose here.
Maybe because of the National Day, I couldn't check in early. Neither can negotiation. I don’t know if one of the room types we reserved is gone, but it means we have to wait until after three o’clock. My four-year-old daughter had no place to take a nap, so she had to hold her and fall asleep while playing outside. It would be nice if the service could be more user-friendly.
The room facilities are very good, and the colorful tiles are small and beautiful. The green trees outside the window make it a beautiful sight to take pictures of.

Booked 3 superior double rooms, and arranged two rooms first when checking in, which were the "school district rooms" described in the reviews. It was summer vacation, and the campus outside the window was extremely quiet🤭The room was clean and comfortable.
The third room was upgraded to a Mahler-style double room. It is a few rooms turned from Building 11. It is very beautiful to take pictures. The children really like the space under the bedside window and have a good time. But the room may be poorly ventilated and smelly. There were small flying insects in the bathroom at night.

However, it is not clearly stated in the hotel reservation instructions that there is such a large "level difference" in Building 1 and Building 2. Even Building 1 can take a card to Building 2, but Building 2 does not give access to Building 1. If you live in Building No. 2, you will not be able to enjoy all the beautiful views of the hotel, and these are all prepared for the "VIP" in Building No. 1.
I was shocked that the small amount of traffic (because the hotel entrance is closed to tourists) does not make the balcony very crowded. And the balcony is not inside the private room, but in the public space on the 3rd floor of Building 1. But this view of public greenery and elevated balconies is only allowed to be used by a small number of residents. I smiled wryly at my poverty and envy, but it was a pity for this lonely balcony.

Management, which should be included in the rent, actually does not have this service

msg:The hotel is divided into building 1.2, building 1 is the original villa of Mahler, and building 2 is newly built later. If you want to experience a villa with a sense of history, choose Building 1, which is the type of house in the picture that also has a wooden ceiling. At 10 o'clock in the morning, the hotel staff introduced the history of the villa, which is very good. The only downside is that there was construction nearby on the night of check-in, which affected sleep.

msg:A true fairytale castle that has never been lived in! The perfect combination of Nordic architecture + Chinese blue and white porcelain + nautical ships is known as one of the top ten works of Shanghai's excellent modern architecture and the most classic architecture of the 20th century. Enjoy the beautiful feeling of living in the Art Palace! The elegant narrator tells the story of "Mahler's little daughter and her residence". The history seems to be right in front of you, which is infinitely touching!
The restaurant has a rich breakfast, and the courtyard landscape is charming and quiet. When leaving, 2 waiters helped to carry the luggage, and the service was in place.
The most touching thing was that he forgot to take the child's translation pen when he left and hung up the phone to the front desk. Brother Ren Junhui immediately contacted the room attendant, and Ma Yingchun found the child's school supplies under the table. It took no more than half an hour from making a call to receiving a return call! Although the things are small, they reflect the high-level management and staff quality of the state-owned Hengshan Group!

Stay in Building No. 1 for the second night, experience a real century-old bungalow, and feel the story of the original owner of the house. Mr. Mahler likes horses very much, so there are many elements about horses in the old house, including photos, oil paintings and sculptures. The interior structure of the house is ingenious and very special. Visiting it is like entering an old castle to explore. Since the house is old and very quiet, it is recommended that at least two people or a family live together to make it more lively.

After checking in, I found that the room is very beautiful and unique, not to mention the beauty of the villa architecture, and it also functions as a museum. There is a tour of the entire building arranged by the hotel at 10 o'clock every day. In addition, the small bridges and flowing water in the garden of the villa are also very elegant, and adults and children enjoy it very much. The service is also very considerate, the service staff is very efficient and caring, if there is any service need, it is almost 2 minutes after hanging up the phone, and the person has arrived at the door of the room. Although the ancient buildings are not as clean as the newly built hotels, the cleanliness and humanized services are also a big plus. My child has asked me to stay here again next time I go back to Shanghai

msg:The first time I came to Mahler Villa was to attend a classmate wedding. Lawn weddings are indeed chic. I came here this time to experience the feeling of an old bungalow slowly. As soon as I dragged the suitcase to the hotel entrance, I asked my little brother to help me take the suitcase and lead me the way. It turns out that there are also Building No. 1 and Building No. 2 here. Check-in is in the second building. The large glass mirror in the lobby of Building No. 2 is particularly beautiful. I arrived at the hotel around two o'clock, but it seems that the check-in time is three o'clock. The room was not cleaned well. The attitude of the front desk staff is also very good. He said that he would give me priority in cleaning as soon as possible, let me rest on the sofa seat, and gave me mineral water. So sweet. After normal check-in, I felt that the room was cleaned very well. I am a clean freak and don't like to use hotel supplies, but here I can see that the sheets and quilt covers have clean creases. The description is new and has not been used. The bathroom is also very clean. There are welcome fruits in the room. It is worth mentioning that although the hotel is small, the service is still very good. If there is anything I need to call the front desk, they will solve it for me. Originally, I was just trying to find out if there was a bathtub cover. It didn't take long for my aunt to send it over. There are also breakfast varieties, although there are not many varieties, but they are still in line with Chinese taste. I did a guide before I came and heard that the wontons are good. I ordered a bowl specially. The chef told me that it is freshly packed daily. The taste really needs to be given a thumbs up! Have a good breakfast and listen to stories. It turned out that it took ten years to build it. Immediately full of respect for this villa. I'll come back for another night when the weather gets cooler. Experience the outdoor afternoon tea.

1. The room facilities are dilapidated, the tabletop is damaged, the carpet is stained, the bedside lamp and lampshade are all broken, and many facilities in the room are comparable to the damage caused by the war in Iraq.
2. The water output from the rain shower nozzle is very small, and it is impossible to take a comfortable bath after a tiring day.
3. The school playground is outside the window, and some rooms are directly facing the teaching building, and there is no description on the booked room type. I see that this hotel explained to the previous bad reviews that there are other room types that are good. What is the use of this explanation? Do you only sell other room types?
4. There are garbage bags piled up on the lawn outside the breakfast room, and there are people who look like chefs smoking next to them, very good!
I wouldn't actually give a bad review just because of these things. Even if the hardware is poor. On the night of check-in, because I went out for a late-night snack, I came back almost 12 o'clock. Called room service and asked for two bottles of mineral water. The person who answered the phone was obviously in a dream, and said "Hello..." in a voice close to 0 decibels. Later, I made another call to ask for shower gel and other items, and the room service staff said impatiently: If you want anything else, just tell me. I'll send it to you once.
This hotel costs more than 1,000 yuan, and I have no complaints about this hardware level. It is not too much for you to provide room service once or twice, right? There are also magical operations of the front desk staff, so I won't list them one by one. It's amazing to have this level of service in Shanghai!

On the first night of my stay, around 4 o'clock in the morning, someone kept knocking on the door, opening and closing the door, and there was a lot of movement in the next room. No rest at all! The 1,900 yuan room cannot even function as a basic sleeping place. I couldn't bear to call the front desk at around 6 or 7 o'clock to complain and wait for a solution. However, by 8 o'clock, no one had communicated and solved the problem. I called the front desk again and said that I had not contacted the supervisor yet. feedback! Simply incredible operation. Later, a supervisor surnamed Bai came to communicate and said that there were newlyweds living next door, so it was very noisy so early. Then why did you go to the hotel so early? This hotel has always hosted weddings, and all the impact on the guests will be early. You know it, but you just choose to turn a blind eye! After coordinating to upgrade the room, on the second night of my stay, I returned to the hotel at 19:00 the next day because I didn't have a good rest the day before, and was ready to fall asleep at 21:00, but! The wedding racks were dismantled in the garden and transported to the door of the hotel. Since the room was facing the door of the hotel, the clanging and clanging sounds of the workers did not end until 22 o'clock. I called the front desk and the receptionist's attitude was very bad and disrespectful. Professional, I just asked the doorman and it was almost over! In short, this hotel refreshed my understanding of the hotel industry! Bad review, highly not recommended! By the way, one of the items on the breakfast cold plate is a small 🐛! The stains on the sheets are even more obvious!

There are lights at night, very beautiful and mysterious
It's in the urban area, and it's relatively smooth to take a taxi to the business district
The furnishings inside are very retro. It is an old house with a story.
There is also a small gym
It may be more suitable for family hotels with children. The a**osphere is more suitable for friends and couples. It would be better if there is a swimming pool
The service is very good, helping to transport the luggage, knowing that the child has a birthday, I even prepared a birthday cake🎂 very considerate

msg:The day I checked in was my birthday, and the hotel upgraded me to a business room with European-style furniture and Monet's "Water Lily" hanging on the wall. The smart toilet is what Mr. Wang is most satisfied with. Dierma's tea bags, welcome fruit, and birthday snacks from the hotel, with a green European-style plate, are very beautiful! Entering the gate of Mahler's residence, a colorful castle in a fairy tale world stands out in front of you. Check-in is done in the lobby of Building 2, which is where the large floor-to-ceiling windows with 100% exposure rate of the villa are located, the three-story hollow hall, and the three-story high colored windows. There are three semicircular arched colored windows, the spring scenery of light green phoenix trees, the summer scenery of dark green phoenix trees, and the autumn scenery of yellow and green phoenix trees. Each window consists of 34 pieces of glass, and each piece has a different carving pattern. The sunlight is projecting in through the colored windows, and suddenly there is a sense of solemnity of the church in a trance.
Visit the villa. The building is very quiet, with almost no people. It is as large as the living room, lounge, and terrace, as small as the stairway, on the stairs, and at every corner. There are scenery everywhere, and beautiful pictures can be seen everywhere. It can be seen that the design of the hotel is very careful. The level of the designer is high. Building No. 1 and Building No. 2 are connected internally. Although there are only three floors, there are many corridors and curves inside. It is a bit confusing to turn around in the two small conjoined buildings. No wonder some residents said that there will be get lost. Most of the stairs, floors, and wall panels are teak, which has turned reddish brown under the baptism of years. The interior decoration of the villa resembles a luxurious cruise ship, and the elements of the cruise ship can be seen inadvertently, such as the circular holes on the stairs, the fleet or seascape wood carvings, the compass ceiling, the sea**** and kelp patterns on the floor, and so on.
Turning to the outside, in addition to the main buildings No. 1 and No. 2, the villa is also connected to the annex buildings, which are high and low, rising and falling, and the shape changes irregularly. People have to be amazed and admire the designer's whimsy. With such a large volume, no wonder we get dizzy. The whole floor is ocher red, made of refractory bricks, embedded with colored Taishan facing bricks, which is unique to the world of fairy tales. There are two sloping roofs of different heights on the top of the main building. The sloping roof on the east side is nearly 20 meters high, with arched oriel windows on it, and relief decorations on the top of the spire and the oriel windows; 25 meters with a steep roof. The doors and windows are arched, and the frames protrude from the wall. There are small minarets on the top and corners of the buildings, which are beautiful in shape. Norwegian-style minarets, Gothic-style spires, and this kind of tall and steep roof are the designs for resisting cold wind and reducing snow on the roof in the Nordic region. It's mysterious and wonderful!
The garden is on the south side of the main building, surrounded by colored tiles. The bronze horse at the entrance of the garden is shaped by Mahler to commemorate his beloved mount. It is the racehorse on which Mahler made his fortune. This horse often wins races and is known as the "good luck horse" in Shanghai at that time. A small ditch surrounds the garden, and a small stone bridge is placed in the east and west. There are rare flowers and trees such as cypress and cedar in the garden, and a neatly trimmed green lawn in the middle. There is a beautiful small flower house against the wall next to the creek. The sign on it says "Painted Boat", which is the name of a Chinese garden. I guess it used to be a place for gardeners' tools, but now it is a small private room. Across the lawn, opposite the main building is the flower viewing room. The room was originally equipped with heating equipment. The interior is exquisitely carved and the floor is covered with colorful tiles. It is now used as a lobby of the hotel.

The appearance is like a fairytale castle, and it is even more mysterious at night under the background of lights and sound effects.
I caught up with the explanation of the Mahler Villa, learned about the past and present, and entered his little daughter's room on the second floor of Building 1. I saw the cute cat door and the exclusive small safe, which was very cute.

Especially the little beauty who took me to visit the villa alone, and taught me about the past and present of the villa like a friend chatting, which is the highlight of my journey. Of course, this is a historical building. No matter how it is maintained, the facilities are not as good as those of a newly built hotel.

I couldn't leave Shanghai during that time, so I chose to celebrate my BF's birthday here, and booked a supreme room. The room was really big and exquisite, with classical and elegant decoration, and I liked it very much. The breakfast is said to be not very good, so I don't have much expectations, but it is actually very good. There are not many varieties but the taste is very good. I made an appoin**ent for the villa explanation at 10 o'clock in the morning, it's great! Walking around, I think it is worth staying for one night!

msg:On my birthday, I invited my relatives to have lunch in Guidu at noon. After eating, I took a taxi to Mahler, but the staff in white shirts at the gate said, "What are you doing here?" "Reservation of the hotel" reply has been CI in advance; ask to show the room card and emphasize "I am a (hotel) staff, and have the right to ask you to show the room card!" After asking the hotel manager to come over to deal with it, answer "Why!" And immediately put on a posture to do it!
As an InterContinental SA Marriott Little Platinum, this is the first time I have encountered such a great hotel! When other hotel cars stop, people come over immediately; you are good, not only people are there, but you also ask the hotel guests, "What are you doing here?" I have the right to ask you to show the room card!" Does it still have the right to request the luggage of the hotel guests? Do you still have the right to ask hotel guests to undress for inspection? After all, you are the best hotel staff!
If it wasn't for my parents who liked this kind of historic hotel and had already advanced the CI situation, the ghosts would live in a hotel like yours! The hotel room is ok, but it is a unique school-view room to ensure that the guests staying can get up on time in the morning

The hotel guide explained the humanities and history of the villa while visiting and benefiting a lot! The hotel's waiters are warm and hospitable. The villa is located at the intersection of South Shaanxi Road and Middle Yan'an Road. The road with old Shanghai style is also worth visiting.

Therefore, although it has been repaired several times, it has been restored as before, and the original pattern and style have been completely maintained. The No. 1 building we live in is an old building. Walking in it is like entering the era of more than 80 years ago. The arched cast-iron stained glass windows in the room can be opened freely. The service of the hotel is excellent, especially in our first building. As soon as we entered the hotel gate, the waiter took our luggage and took us up to the third floor VIP for check-in. I especially like the little brother at the front desk who has always been a butler service to us. It is easy to discharge large pieces inside and outside the hotel. Five points of praise!

The overall environment and service are still very good, the bedding is also very comfortable, the curtains are closed and the shading is very good. It's just that the sound insulation of the room is not good, and you can hear the conversation next door.

msg:During the Chinese New Year holiday, I could not go out with my children, so I asked a few sisters to book the Mahler Villa in advance, and stayed for one night to experience the life of the little princess in the castle [Naughty]
Room Facilities:
There is no doubt that the unique geographical location is a treasure land of Feng Shui. The unique architectural style that anyone passing by will take a second look at. If you have money and luck, it is better to book a luxury room in the old building of Building 1. There is also free access to the executive lounge, as well as a coffee machine. Afternoon tea can also be delivered to the room.
The twin-bedded room in Building 2 is just average, and the area is small. There is no coffee machine, and the hair dryer is so small that it is unbearable!

Cost-effective:
The local tyrant sister who was with me quickly booked the largest suite in the old building. When I placed the order, it was gone. There was only a standard twin room in Building 2. I don't know, I'm really getting a knife! Sure enough, the expensive ones are different, whether it is the area, landscape, furnishings, supplies, beds and furniture, etc. are not a star and a half. Fortunately, the local tyrant's room is big enough, and we all went to her room to have afternoon tea and take pictures!
For dinner, we ordered the local dishes of the Mahler Hotel. As a result, the local tyrants ordered too many dishes. The original rectangular table was not fit. The service manager immediately transferred us to the big box for dinner. It can only be used if the low consumption is full 6800. The dishes are all delicious, but the three-cup bullfrog tastes too sweet. Originally, during the Chinese New Year, everyone had a long time to eat, and we couldn't finish the dishes when we ordered too much. The waiter quickly reminded us whether to cancel some of the following dishes, which was very considerate. After the last four different desserts came up, we originally said that we would be full after two bites, but when we saw good-looking desserts, we all said that we could have two more bites. [Naughty] As a result, a few children killed all four desserts. That tirami Su Yan value and taste alike!
The toiletries in the standard room and the luxury suites are all from a brand manufacturer, but the packaging is completely different, and I don't know if the ingredients are the same. But I really like the scent of the shower gel and body lotion, it smells really good.
wifi:
The TV network in our room is very slow, and it is often stuck. A news about the Winter Olympics is stuck several times before reading it.

Room view:
There is almost no landscape outside the window of the twin room in Building 2. [daze]

parking:
There is a parking lot, free parking within 24 hours of staying in the hotel, just report the license plate number when entering and leaving the hotel

breakfast:
Breakfasts are all eaten on the first floor of the old building. Although the place is relatively small, we have tried our best to have everything we need. Chinese and Western buffet breakfasts. There are many people in our company. The waiter specially helped us open the largest round table private room for us. Service attitude Very good, patient and enthusiastic. The private room is said to be the financial room of the original boss Mahler. There are 3 old-fashioned safes that can be seen on the walls of the room. I have learned a lot!

msg:This year of the tiger is a local Chinese New Year in Shanghai, and I asked two families to book three rooms. The experience of old Shanghai and rental culture is particularly profound. Traveling through history, it feels like being in 1936, and it is also like being in Europe. Happy, beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows, sofas and escalators all retain the texture characteristics of that era. The private rooms on the second floor of Building 1 are named after German cities such as Heidelberg and Swan Castle. Mahler rented it to her daughter and the president of the Horse Racing Association in Shanghai. Our descendants leave behind this history and architecture. The candy jar in the lobby is exquisite, the glass in the room is clean and bright, the carpet is clean and comfortable, the millet kettle, the TOTO smart toilet, the TV CNN international channel, the breakfast service is warm, seeing that we have a lot of people, we have prepared a location near the floor-to-ceiling windows on the lawn for us, the jam is delicious , The plates are changed frequently, and there are quite a few categories. The breakfast building No. 1 is the original building, which has the overall quality of international operation and management.

The garden is also very beautiful and well decorated. The arrangement of the room is not ideal, the window is not facing the garden view. It's a pity that I didn't live in the main building of No. 1. It is said that the No. 2 building was built later. But I still like it very much and will come again next time. The service is also very good~

msg:Finally, on my birthday, I checked in to the long-favored Villa Mahler Hotel. In fact, when I first arrived at the hotel, I was not satisfied with the location, because it was a bit close to the viaduct, and it seemed that it was not as clean as a villa hotel. Fortunately, I booked a room in the main building of No. 1. As soon as I entered the building, it was like a dream back to a hundred years ago. I walked up the wooden stairs and came to the room where Mrs. Mahler lived. The whole villa and room are full of details and reproduced. The quality of life of Kehler, the owner's family, was improved. I would also like to praise the breakfast here. It is very delicate in old Shanghai. Sitting on the red sofa to eat, the view of the garden outside the window comes into view, which is unique. PS: Building 2 of the Villa Hotel was imitated in 2001. If you want to truly experience the owner's living space, you still need to choose the room in Building 1 (only 9).

msg:The hotel is full of architecture and history, but the service is really average. The service staff will not take the initiative to say hello when encountering in the hotel, and they rarely take the initiative to provide services. All things are asked by themselves. It stands to reason that for such a hotel with historical heritage, you should take the initiative to inform you that there is a free guided tour program when you check in at the front desk (similar to the Peace Hotel). This is all on your own. I will say that there are no free ones that day, but only paid ones. After a while, I said that there are no more charges. I can only wait for the next day to be free, and it seems that there is only one game a day. It is an embarrassing time at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Check out at 12 o'clock the day before. Check in, so who is this guide for? However, I still have to praise the staff who guided the tour. The whole process was explained and interactive. At our request, I visited the Supreme Room that has not yet been checked in by guests, which boosted my impression of the entire hotel. Another thing I liked was the restaurant’s service staff. We ordered three breakfasts for the parent-child room. She took the initiative to waive the meal expenses of my second child and showed the style of a five-star hotel. The hotel has convenient parking and free for in-house guests, but since the parking lot is next door to the hotel, don’t expect any security or parking services. When we checked out, it seemed that there was a problem with the system. We couldn't find our entry records. The front desk asked us to find the parking lot security by ourselves, saying that it was the guest of the hotel. If it didn't work, let us call the front desk. Yes, it means that you have to do it yourself, instead of asking my colleagues in the Security Depar**ent to come and see you, or I ask colleagues in the Security Depar**ent to wait at the door, and if there is a problem, they will solve it. Later, we didn't find the parking lot security at all when we went out. Fortunately, the parking lot's billing system scanned the license plate and let us out.

msg:The Mahler Villa, also known as Mahler House, has a rich history. The British Jew Mahler built this unique Norwegian house based on the style seen in his daughter’s dream. It was built for 9 years and was completed in 1936. Soon after the villa was built, it encountered the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the Japanese entered the concession in 1941, the Mahler family was rushed to a concentration camp. The villa became a club for the Japanese army. In order to avoid the war, Mahler left China and stayed here. The "dream castle" that can't be taken away. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it became an organ of the Kuomintang, and later the office of the Municipal Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, and now it has become a villa hotel where the people can spend money. After more than eighty years, only cats have been frequent visitors in Mahler Villa.
Closer to home, when we checked in, a big apricot tree in the garden just started to turn yellow, and it should be beautiful in a few days. Whether from the large floor-to-ceiling glass on the first floor or the windows on the second and third floors, you can see the beautiful scenery, and little sisters.

msg:The following gives a pertinent evaluation: Because it is a historic building, a star is added to the hotel rating.
However, both the room facilities and the sanitary facilities are slightly outdated, not in a primitive style, but the decoration design is neither retro nor simple and fashionable.
Parking: It is in the social parking lot next to it. It is underground. There are not many parking spaces and there is no guide from the villa staff. There is a Shenzhou rental car right next to it, so where should I park? No eye-catching signs.
Breakfast: There are not many types of breakfast, and the most anticipated pastries are also very few. If one variety is finished, you may change to another variety, but you can't enjoy it, because you have to wait and wait for new tricks to appear. The only highlight is the noodles and small wontons. If there are too many people, you may have to wait.
Waiter: There are really many waiters. Whether it is cleaning in the corridor or the waiter in the restaurant, changing the dishes is very diligent.
Every time I go out, I can see Auntie Cleaning sitting on the sofa at the entrance of the corridor to rest. I don't know whether to appreciate the building or see the scenery of the cleaning lady.
The whole check-in process did not feel the slightest "home away from home". For example, when I checked in at the front desk, I took the initiative to ask for toiletries and then took it out. The boys were also very indifferent at the time of registration. Is it to cater to the quiet a**osphere of the whole hall?
When I came out of the room, it was not the cleaning lady who said "good morning", but "you are going to check out". This is the first time I was asked this question when I stayed in so many hotels, and I opened the door. For a moment, it felt really bad.
Also, since it is a famous historical building, taking pictures is very common, but on the lawn, in the corridor, outside the house, there will always be a cleaning or greening in the channel sweeping and vacuuming. And when I saw someone taking a photo or even suggested that I could avoid it, I was still very stubborn. I didn't feel that it could provide convenience. It should be because of a strong sense of ownership!

msg:I couldn't go out of Shanghai on National Day. I chose to stay in the historic building Mahler Villa Hotel. I was fortunate to witness Mahler’s dream of a castle princess for his daughter. The entire villa is divided into Building No. 1 and Building 2. The hotel has upgraded the style room for us free of charge. The hotel is of Nordic Norwegian architectural style, and the interior decoration is beautiful, which can fully satisfy the little girl's princess dream. The buffet breakfast is not very big, but there is my favorite shrimp, which is very satisfying, and the view of the restaurant is so beautiful that I don’t want to go to eat it. The disadvantage is that there is no swimming pool, which is less fun for the children, but it is still worth living. It is worthwhile to taste the history.

Then inside is the authentic taste of "petty bourgeoisie". From the moment the butler takes you into the room, time seems to pass. It seems to be a long-lost friend who was placed by the housekeeper. The glass decals on the annex building have a sense of sight of Alice in Wonderland. The walkway with white and purple is like a cabin on the sea. Irregular rooms are laid on the floor with writing, and the stained glass of colored glaze is matched with various oil paintings, which has a special taste. After all, it is an old villa, and the quality of sleep is not comparable to a new five-star. The main building has a different style. As you step up the stairs, you can't help but fall in love more. Those spikes and corners that I didn't like before, probably because of the precipitation of time, everything between up and down the stairs has become a matter of course, just right. The most important thing about a building is the humanities, so you can experience it again at breakfast. The taste is not amazing but there is a rare taste, small wontons, noodles must be tried. I forgot to mention that parking in the ba*****t separated by a wall is very convenient. Walking around, there must be something you want to see.

I'm not lying, I was even worried that I would die of gas suffocation while sleeping. The next morning, I asked to change the room and they changed it to the next room, but the front desk didn't say sorry, even formally. Even in the evening of the changed room, the toilet smelled a little, but it was tolerable. In the case of the room we stayed in on the first day, it is really a room that should never accept guests. It doesn't make sense to charge a high price for a room with a balcony where you can't breathe and sleep even for a single day. It's a room where you can't sleep even if you ask to sleep for free. Other breakfast restaurant staff were friendly. Even if the building itself is too old and outdated to completely solve the sewer smell problem, in the case of room 2107, we recommend that you never accept pitcher guests until the toilet smell is repaired.

I gradually found that there were a lot of bites in the room below the calf. I searched and suspected that it was flea bites. Communicate with the hotel to change the room, but the room cannot be changed when the room is fully booked. The hotel said that it can kill the bugs, but after the bugs passed, I caught two live fleas in the room before going to bed that night! This leaves no doubt that the room has fleas! I went to the front desk with the flea bag in my arms. The front desk looked calm. It seems that I am not the first person to encounter fleas. Checked out at 12 o'clock in the morning and changed hotels. Now I wonder if there are fleas on the clothes. ! Worst hotel stay ever, bar none. In addition, I would like to complain about the hotel's service. A young lady in charge of the room and the breakfast waiter are very enthusiastic, and most of the rest are indifferent.

msg:這次選的老樓（主樓）房型，感覺蠻不錯的，酒店整體風格古典且不失優雅。
設施：整體講非常不錯，這種建築能保留原有的風貌已經很難得，內部設施隨沒有普通酒店的奢華，但是它該有的樣子。
衞生：房間衞生狀況不錯，大堂、房間都香香的。
環境：整體環境非常滿意，花園環境幽雅，內部陳列也很有特點。
服務：可圈可點，從入住到退房都非常有禮貌，入住時行李員幫提行李，由於老樓沒有電梯，行李員一路手提到三層，手動點個贊，這個忘記記下名字了😳（3月29日午後）；還要表揚下退房時的兩個管家帥哥（陸憶年和陳浩棟）禮貌且服務熱情周到，還送了小紀念品，非常貼心，且幫忙寄存行李，很友善。
唯一覺得可以改進的：希望行政酒廊的餐食可以再豐富一些，才配得上這個價位的房間😄

到酒店辦入住已經20:30了，可能是晚上了，大堂衹有一位前台小哥，感覺有點冷清，不熱情。
第二天早餐、退房、在大堂小憩，感覺都非常好，工作人員都很禮貌、熱情、周到，有一種住在一個英國貴族古堡裏的感覺👍。
酒店大方得難以置信：房間迷你吧的8瓶飲料居然都是免費贈飲的（依雲水、啤酒、可樂、橙汁），還有歡迎水果和薯片等小食，洗浴用品是歐舒丹的，退房還送了小禮物。孩子身高略超過一米二了，早餐也沒收費。
酒店在這樣寸土寸金的地段，還有免費的停車場。一切都很驚喜和意外，孩子非常喜歡，下次還想再來

唯一要吐槽的是早餐，在1號樓，這家早餐是我見過最差的，餐品感覺都是半成品加熱，極難吃，服務員也懶得收拾餐位，水果品質極差，還比不上房間裏的。然後九點四十五就開始收餐了，一副十點鐘肯定收完的架勢。是酒店裡特別感覺國企服務質量的槽點，絕對的短板。

吸引我的動力源自他特別的建築和舒適的早餐環境。早餐非常愜意。
但是服務、管理和房間舒適度都很難達到讓人滿意的程度。
第二次入住的房間，應該是當年閣樓傭人間改造的客房，或許可以體驗一次。但是寫字枱對應窗口處整日的轟鳴聲，完全沒有辦法符合一個酒店應有的條件，剛進房間還有比較刺鼻的味道。
閣樓門外，屬於客人的公共區域擺放着清潔物料，這就應該屬於管理的問題了。

從外觀看，色彩斑斕，帶着童話色彩!像一座迷你的歐洲古堡高聳的挪威尖塔，中式的琉璃瓦，老虎窗，還有獨特的三層縱橫牆，鑲嵌着彩色琉璃磚，每一面都有迥然不同的美，宛如一座華麗的宮殿。
記得小時候乘公交車24路經過這裏的時候一直想有機會去裏面住一下。
這個聖誕節帶家人去夢幻城堡🏰實現了自己兒時夢想。
酒店的房間比較寬敞舒適，早餐非常好👍，中西美食結合。

給酒店反應後解決態度很好，賠禮道歉後還專門郵寄了禮物。但這入住體驗實在太差勁，更好的酒店選擇多的是我真是服了。專程來體驗老派風格的，但國企也不能這樣欺騙人民感情吧？！慎選。

2.房間中規中矩，設備，清潔用品保證了一定檔次，但在房間看到了蟑螂和蜘蛛，但數量不是非常多那種；後院有活動，一直在準備，弄的非常臟。
3.最不滿意的是服務，辦理入住時前台就在和一位大爺在辯論一些東西，等了十分鐘後來了第二個服務人員辦理入住，告知房間沒好，等準備好後會電話聯繫我，這一等就是晚六點，我主動前往前台去問，告訴我房間已經好，辦理入住的時候就好了…説是之前的同事失誤，但我連房卡都沒拿不知道打電話問一下嗎？晚九點來了個電話，問我是不是吹風機壞了，可我也沒報修，又整個烏龍，更不用説酒店的服務介紹，快遞領取之類的服務了，基本沒有，這對卧龍鳳雛有事還互相埋怨……真是長見識了。

服務態度也一言難盡，好像挺客氣，但借個充電線特別要求我們自己送還到前台，行。

建築設計和環境裝修可能很多人會很喜歡，假裝很歐洲的調調，店裡有穿着旗袍的阿姨開心的拍照，好，別人開心也好。但我們對這種虛假無感，怪我們自己選錯了。

當天入住較晚，工作人員也很耐心告知設施使用情況，也很貼心將行李送至房間，且房間温度已調試舒適。
特別喜歡十點鐘的別墅講解，不僅僅是建築的歷史和故事，更是家庭的温暖和感動。如果講解再慢一點，温情一點，會更加動人心絃。
中西式結合的裝飾設計和花園佈局，也吸引了賓客或訪客的紛紛留影，一樓大廳略為喧鬧。樹蔭下的休閑座椅，即使是炎炎夏日，仍然頗為閑適。
行走於別墅花園之中，感受着馬勒先生的愛女之心，腦海中的畫面感和花園裡的草木石交匯融合，令人動容且沉醉……

一個小女孩的夢中城堡，父親用9年時間將它建成真正的城堡。

一個家族的事業元素，巧妙地融入這座城堡中。北歐挪威風格，海運遊輪，舷船舵盤，浪花纜索……作為在上海灘呼風喚雨的洋大人，城堡又中西混搭，羅馬柱加蘇州園林拱門，石獅子雕了高鼻樑雙眼皮……

這艘如航船的城堡在歷史的長河裡隨風飄盪：日本人來了，它成了日軍的軍人俱樂部。民國政府掌權了，又是特務機要處。新中國成立，共青團長駐此處……

它的主人以及他的後代，他們的回憶和夢中，上海灘的這座城堡肯定從未遠離過。

飯店分為一號二號兩棟樓，前院主樓主營餐廳宴會，後院二號樓是客房。大堂最大的亮點就是兩層樓高的森系小清新花玻璃窗，置身其中彷彿來到了挪威的森林。

🛏️客房在二樓，路上的每個角落都佈置得那麼温馨浪漫。潔白的長廊，光線明亮，完全想不到這是二十多年的維保。

雙人房不大，老房子的小格局，維保大不如公共區域。傢俱有劃痕，地毯和窗簾色調都略為暗沉，角落裡的沙發奇怪地一分為二。窗外全是院子的頂棚，近距離面對對面樓宇，還不如弄個花窗封閉算了。

🍽️餐飲：入住時請前台工作人員幫忙訂了位。點餐的時候，穿着小背心的年輕員工催促，有點不耐煩。餐廳沒有菜單，雙人套餐衹有點評上800多元的團購，午餐份量足，不過出品真一般。第二天早餐也一樣，中西主食量夠，普通不精緻。

🍃大愛別墅兩千平米的花園後院，幾盆粉色花壇點亮了整個草坪，鬱鬱葱葱，明艷嫵媚。

酒店始終有點歷史，靠近大門處隔音不好，偶爾有小孩在房門走道吵鬧的話會比較明顯，其他房間的關門聲也會聽到，但聲響都在可接受範圍，在浴室也會隱隱約約聽到隔壁的聲音，對聲音敏感的話要仔細考慮。

房間整潔，房間設施確實想到其他現代酒店來說比較老舊，但還算整潔。住一天以上時，在第二天外出時會有清潔人員自行進入房間打掃和補充梳洗用品（這個完全沒有預料到也沒有職員提過，房間也開了請勿打擾，第二天晚上回房有嚇到😂）如果在意有人在自己不在的時候進入房間的話可能要問問職員，和把貴重物品放好。

有早餐提供，種類豐富，每天的餐品也不一樣，餐廳的職員也很友善。

msg:媽媽想體驗上海老洋房，看到馬勒別墅的照片就立刻決定預定這裡了。開始不知道它的玫瑰花園和酒店是分開的，車子送到花園裡面，發現不連通，可是酒店門口就是一個小小的路口，門口還在做施工，停車十分不方便，帶著大大的行李箱一頓折騰。門衛保安叔叔人很好很盡責，指引也很清晰。我們住在2號樓，是後期新修的，雖然裝修風格一致，但是和一號樓還是有很大差距的，這個在預定的時候沒有注意到，小夥伴們要特別注意。2號樓樓高比較低，男友1米86，在客房層站著感覺快碰到天花板了，稍微有點侷促。客房也是比較老派的，但是衛生很不錯。媽媽說看著阿姨在附近房間搞衛生，做的特別的細緻。酒店備品全部是歐舒丹，房間還準備冷小瓶的洗衣液。入住當天碰到一號樓和花園封閉，有人包場辦婚禮，很多黑西轉小哥哥在門口擋路，其實感覺稍微不好，讓人感覺酒店的界限感比較強。早餐還行，品種不算多，味道給個中上吧，廣東以南的小夥伴可能有部分菜品吃不習慣，但這個算是口味不同，和廚師本人無關。

msg:在上海頗具歷史盛名的馬勒別墅，是女生們的夢中情堡沒錯了💐，確切的講我路過了無數次，也是我第二次來，上一次是過來喝了個蠻有情調的下午茶，這次過來直接住店
也是藉著520過來撇個小情調
520這兩天都是新人結婚，唯一的槽點就是草坪很早就被工作人員各種婚禮插花布置等
我入住的這兩天草坪都被婚禮佔了，拍照背景特別雜亂，就整個無語住
雖然説酒店包場結婚無法避免，這也是可以理解的，但我個人認為酒店應該在各預訂平臺中提前寫明當天有婚禮包場會佔用到酒店哪些設施
住客應該有知情權，若我提前瞭解當天有婚禮包場會佔用草坪那我是不會訂房入住的，畢竟直接影響到了我對酒店草坪的使用
或者酒店應該退部分房費作為對住客無法正常使用草坪來作為補償
這些措施都沒有，所以現在的酒店為了賺錢營業也是不講武德的，皆向錢看齊，沒有本着對消費者負責的公德心可言
我評價給了四星，這一星就扣在上面這個槽點上
.
🪴環境：
很早時候看馬勒別墅覺得很大，可能是錯覺
這兩次過來看覺得其實並不大，走過一圈長廊到草坪位置，覺得草坪挺小的
尤其是為了婚禮佈置，雜七雜八的東西一堆，草坪顯的更小了
整體是英式古堡的格調，奢華又內斂
各種花花草草一片綠意盎然印入眼簾，一整個花園別墅到處可穿行，環境絕美
餐廳等內部設計也很古典高雅，處處透露出奢華優雅靜謐的高貴氣息，彷彿置身歐洲城堡別墅
.
🍳早餐：
am 7:00-10:00（10:00準時收餐）
挑選了個單獨靠窗有簾子的景觀位用餐，這個位置太美太奢華了，私密性氛圍感很足
陽光☀️透過窗户照進來瞬間人間值得
很有儀式感的一次早餐
自助餐餐品蠻豐富的
最好吃的是小餛飩，湯汁鮮美很香
其他菜品整體口感一般，有些不好吃
味道配不上環境系列
.
👧🏻服務：
12:00到店都沒能入住，雖説一般規定的入住時間都是下午2、3點
但以前住過的酒店都是12點之前全部入住完畢的，這家入住也太墨跡了
一般酒店都能延遲退房到下午2點左右，這家也不行，房間是真的少吧
房型給我免費升級了，所以對以上的槽點也算了
其他服務沒什麼毛病，服務生態度都挺好的
.
🏩房間景觀、設施：
給我免費升級了房間蠻大的
室內風格有點老舊，挺一般的
四面窗蠻大的，窗外沒啥特別的風景，把窗都打開房內空氣挺好的
洗澡水大很舒服，我衹要洗澡ok就可以了
床蠻軟的，睡覺也挺舒服的
房間乾淨整潔，整體設施🉑️
.
🏋️♂️酒店設施：
健身房很小一個，設備就兩台估計也就衹能呆1-2個人
高端的馬勒別墅裏竟然沒有泳池，這就有點説不過去了，好歹露天或者室內高低總得整一個吧
設施有點欠缺，有待開發提升
.
💰性價比：
520期間房價總歸比平時要貴一些的
便宜的房型1-2千左右，貴的房型3-4千➕
跟😷前比漲了點價，性價比還行吧
.
➕座標：
酒店坐落陝西南路鉅鹿路這一帶，也是上海市區的黃金地段了，地理位置優越
周邊都是各種富有情調的小酒吧和餐館
如果不想在酒店內用餐，那去周邊吃飯或者晚上喝個小酒都是相當方便的
.
ps：
我住的那兩天不是有新人結婚麼，咱就是説草坪不能正常的拍照咱高低也得去湊個熱鬧呀
我去人家婚禮那湊個人頭，這麼喜慶的氣氛不能錯過了呀，用鏡頭記錄一下
雖然露天草坪婚禮有點小，但儀式感還是可以的
婚禮中還安排了好多和平鴿🕊️，幾衹白鴿飛出來停在草坪上不走了，小“嘉賓”們好可愛
新郎新娘男帥女美很配呦，見證了美好幸福的瞬間，沾沾喜氣，到處都是好彩頭嘻嘻🤭
草坪附近還有兩衹常駐的“虎皮”小貓，像是被固定養着的那種，經常在草坪附近到處穿梭，不怕人也不親近人，很高冷
不知道是不是婚禮上的鴿子一直站在房頂上特別悠閑的整理自己的羽毛
角落裡我們還發現了一堆貓，這些小傢伙給馬勒別墅增添了生機活力
雖然酒店門口寫着禁止遊客參觀，但還是有好多阿姨爺叔們進來到處晃白*着打卡拍照什麼的
誒嘛也沒辦法，露天開放的也避免不了吧……

這次另一不悦的是 入住的房間可能前面的客人是個煙鬼 房間留下的煙味很厲害 雖然讓服務員再來清潔一下 那也衹是噴曬一點空氣葯物而已 其實窗簾等已經吸附了煙味 所以整晚睡覺時人感很難受！這樣的住客如此抽煙讓人很無語 特此抱怨下！

msg:總體而言，馬勒別墅是非常值得一住的，環境一流，歷史厚重，建築精美有特色，但在細節上還有一點小瑕疵。首先從設施上講，公主房浴缸的龍頭有故障，衹能用花灑放水。從洗護備品上看，有些是新的未拆封的，有些是已拆封，應該是之前客人沒用完的，於馬勒別墅這個層次的酒店而言，洗護備品重複使用是不太應該的。服務上還是缺乏主觀能動性的，可能是國企管理的通病吧，一號樓從晚上七點以後就沒有見到過前台人員了，服務上的積極性還是能給賓客更好體驗的。另外是一點小建議，馬勒別墅現在是非住店或用餐客人不能入內參觀的，個人建議別墅內的花園、新樓是不是可以對公眾預約開放，舊時代外國資本家的私人府邸在新時代能被廣大羣眾參觀遊覽，這本身就是我們制度優勢的體現，當然這可能增加酒店的運營管理成本，但畢竟衡山集團作為國企，除了經濟效益，是不是還要考慮一下社會效益呢？最後，馬勒別墅是很值得多刷的，也希望每次來都能在馬勒別墅中得到新的驚喜。

其實住這裏無非就是想感受下它的歷史性，感受下歐式夢幻古堡的設計，對房間內的期待就不要太高了，內裏就是普通的老式酒店。
美中不足的就是早飯竟然要排隊，客流量還算是比較大的酒店，竟然所有客人都要在一個小小的飯廳裏用餐，這屬實不太合理…為此耽誤了預訂了10點的講解。不過這裏要實名感謝一下龍景波先生（不確定是不是這個名字了），酒店的工作人員，聽到我們預訂了10點講解但可能因為排隊早飯會來不及，他主動提出讓我們慢慢等安心吃，然後親自單獨帶我們轉了一圈做了講解。真的非常有温度且有人情味！為他點贊！非常感謝！！！

1.有配沐浴液，潤膚露，香皂，牙刷，梳子。但是沒有洗髮水，不知道是不是失誤
2.床墊軟硬適中，床靠背是皮質的，舒服

服務
1.絕大多少工作人員都很熱情，主動幫忙提行李，照顧小朋友。
2.我退房的時間13:08。退房時間到底是廣而告之的14:00還是其他時間。我有個大行李箱忘了拿，轉身已鎖門，刷卡進不去。猜測是過了退房時間。去前台表示要回房間拿個行李箱，前台工作人員表示過了退房時間，所以打不開。我知道啊，我就是要拿個行李箱啊，難道，超過時間，房間裏落下行李都不能帶走了嗎。幫**作房卡後，我去3樓，還是刷不開房門。我告知後，説讓客房工作人員來處理。又等了5分鐘，還是沒有來，我又下1樓到前台重新操作房卡。
3.退房後，預約的網約車到了酒店門口，正在上下行李時，告知我，我使用了房間小冰箱裏的可樂，要扣按金。而我根本沒有使用過。我有些生氣，溝通幾句後，工作人員一種算了的口氣。沒有使用就是沒有使用，能付房費，喝不起一瓶可樂嗎？我要求確認到底是怎麼回事，要實事求是的呀。後致電我説，是客房服務搞錯了。當時退房的衹有我一個人。我實在不理解，到底是怎麼搞錯的。

設施：因為設施陳舊，所以也無法和其相比，冰箱：未開啟，打開裏面都是水，冷藏功能開啟，聲音就特別大；衞生間：未看到梳子，這個有點不應該。牙具，用了一次，扔了，第二天沒有再放🥺，這個大家要注意。洗衣服：還要額外收費，而且費用很高，可以像前台要免費蒸汽熨斗。現在很多酒店都提供免費洗烘機。早餐：確實太一般了，品種也很少。

唯一的弱勢可能由於本身比較受限，供小孩玩的地方不多
還有一個好處是地理位置不錯，去外灘和陸家嘴打車都不遠。

非要説可改善的地方地下停車場在別墅外。但瑕不掩瑜，總之贊贊贊
特別感謝前台富小姐送了本小小紀念冊，等拿房時建議我們先去周邊溜達吃個飯也主動送瓶裝水要我們帶着，特別熱情親切

環境：大廳的香氛很香，房間區域也有淡淡的木香
服務：除了保潔更換一次性物品的時候有些不滿意（知道是因為限塑令，不打電話的話不會主動更換，但是丟進垃圾桶裏的一次性拖鞋又拿出來給我擺在了床邊，很不爽）其他都很好

升級住的一號樓“伯爵房”
看了一些評論説老樓1號樓有黴味，木地板老舊的，親身體驗，並沒有問題！可能剛進入地毯區域會有一點點老舊的氣味，但房間裏完全沒影響！
房間的細節太棒了，用品，贈品，小到古董電話，細到淋浴房滑動阻力門，衹能用一個詞形容：上流！

服務也不用説，驚艷到位，一位戴黨徽的小姐姐親自當嚮導，做解説，領着我們參觀了整個別墅，感謝

最後想説一下，廁所的洗浴，沐浴露，香波，護髮素的瓶口太小了！ 倒着特費盡，其他完美！

外圍有圍牆圍起，難以窺全貌
正門不大，穿過後別有洞天
歐式風的斜屋頂，配有彩色玻璃
雖然在網上已經看到樓房圖片
還是驚歎這城堡的夢幻

辦理入住手續時
前台房曉林女士留下深刻印象
親切的問候
並且分享了周邊不為人知的小眾景點和美食
化解了初來乍到的不安
穿梭在梧桐樹下
四處打卡
在上海有着不一樣的旅遊體驗

感謝馬勒別墅帶給我的老上海洋樓體驗
也再次感謝房女士所展現的上海風土人情

總言之，是一次很不錯的入住體驗。唯有一點，浴缸比較深，洗浴時要注意安全！

msg:洗浴用品、床品、酒店的味道、電視節目，都沒什麼好誇的，房間隔音效果也不太行。茶包品牌一般，浴衣卻還不錯，浴缸🛁也不錯，雖然有個零件壞了，但是能用；智能馬桶也合格；歡迎水果好吃。二天號樓一樓的露台房，露台毫無觀景價值，也是醉了，這錢掙得有點過分。但是浴室浴缸上方的吊燈、背後的壁畫，整體營造的氛圍還是蠻貴族化的。服務就真的不太行了，主要是員工給人的感覺不太專業，比較隨意，彷彿他們在經營民宿，而不是一個五星級酒店。總體來説，作為五星級酒店很一般，作為歐式建築還是很好看的。尤其是晚上，燈光下的城堡，頗為夢幻。早上離開的時候，還看到一些遊人在外面拍照，因為不是住店客人，不能入內，還是頗有幾分優越感的。住一個晚上可以，可以當成玩賞景點，多一個晚上就沒必要了。

🚗 交通：很便利！非常便利，去靜安區、徐彙區、外灘都不遠，去鉅鹿路、淮海路更是步行也能到達。
酒店也有自己的停車場，前台小哥很貼心的讓我們多停了半天，畢竟魔都的停車費還蠻高的。
🍃環境：酒店像一座城堡，裡外都是濃郁的哥特式古堡風格，很美。

再來説説缺點：
🔔服務：吃早餐那邊我們剛拿了早餐準備入座，有個服務員小哥就質問我們怎麼進來的？這邊是預訂了，你們預訂了嗎？這三連問簡直把我問懵了，我們是住店並且有早餐券啊，難不成路過進來蹭吃的？哪怕需要確認也應該換一種語音吧！吃完早飯想去後花園拍拍照，又有一位清潔大叔説不許進去草坪，一分鐘後婚禮的佈置就紛紛踏入，能辦婚禮卻不能讓我們進去？反正就是有點很清高很強勢的感覺，讓人不適。
🧹衞生：總體來説過得去，但畢竟是老宅，衞生跟新一點的酒店比還是相差甚遠。
總結：不推薦

室內裝飾十分講究，過道、走廊等處都裝有護牆板，到處都雕着美麗精緻的圖案，室內穹頂上裝有彩色玻璃，在陽光的照射下呈現出斑斕柔和的色彩。北歐哥特式的建築風格充滿夢幻浪漫的色彩。
