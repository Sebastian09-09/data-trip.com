it was not as good as I expected.
The hotel design is quite dated and observable dirt marks on the carpet. The hotel interior and room are super smelly, can smell strong cigarettes. The cleanliness is just okay.

For breakfast, it has a good selection except that all tea is not hot.

Though it is near to metro station, there are still lots of choices within this range of budget.

msg:Hotel room was very nice. Service staff was a bit hard of hearing and slow on the uptake (I speak Mandarin), but were helpful in the end. 

The main problem I had was that they disabled the AC in our entire floor and the air defaulted to heating, which made the room unbearably hot (it was 20 C outside and very humid). I was up at 4 am, covered in sweat, fiddling with the settings and had to call reception in the end when I realized nothing was wrong with the settings.  They then had a lot of trouble coming to terms with me not wanting to sleep in 28c temperature. 

Finally, they gave me an extra room with cold AC to pass the night, and late check-out for the next day. This also lead me to waking up late and missing the breakfast I paid for.

Near to large shopping complex and plenty of food options.

If u come fr HK via High Speed Train, u can take a leisurely 20 minutes walk to the hotel via a underground shopping street most of the way.

The young lady with glasses at the check in counter is especially deserving for a mention....great service attitude, always earnest to assist and very professional in handling matters considering her young age. The hotel must give her very positive attention in her future career development, or I m sure other competitors might offer her better offers very soon

Staff was very helpful and cooperative to change another room as first room smelled not fresh and the third room we tried was good without smell. The room is big and have nice view. The bath is very nice; big and view during bathing. Nice swimming pool which was not busy and was heated. It had great views towards west (Pingan Tower).

I had issue with bank cards they were very patient due to time difference with UK.

I would happily return with my Chinese family members and UK family should they visit.

However if I am ever in the Futian district again, I would certainly consider Wyndham again obviously cost dependent if any other upper class Hotel was available at could price I would also shop around.

But my statement above goes not take anything away for the staff and service at Wyndham

在这里住了 5 天，工作人员非常有礼貌，细心周到，Eric、Jaina 和 Stella 在酒吧的语言不是问题。

我对银行卡有疑问，由于与英国的时差，他们非常耐心。

如果我的中国家庭成员和英国家庭来访，我会很高兴地回来。

但是，如果我再次来到福田区，我肯定会再次考虑温德姆，如果有任何其他高档酒店价格合理的话，我肯定会再次考虑温德姆，我也会货比三家。

但我上面的声明并没有带走温德姆酒店员工和服务的任何东西

msg:I stay in Room 3301 for 1 night. I always hear some mechanical noise until almost midnight. I believed that the noise was came from elevators or something. The noise was quite disturbing but I didn’t request to change the room since I already took shower and unpacked my stuff.

In the morning at around 7, I started to hear some noise consistently from a construction site across the road. Luckily it was almost time to get up. So I didn’t filed a complaint. 

I booked this room via trip.com for more than HK$1.2K a night, breakfast excluded. The room is huge (not necessary though) but the hardware is not modern. I will only rate this as a 4 stars hotel in China standard. 

For this price and my experience, I will not recommend this hotel for business and leisure travellers.

It’s walking distance to some major malls but with the nearby construction, it’s not very safe to walk on the street. Other than the location and breakfast, we like this hotel’s room a lot.

The location is close to the convention center, with convenient transportation. There are many dining options around, and there are many shopping malls within a few hundred meters. Although the hotel is a bit old, the overall facilities are good, especially the floor-to-ceiling windows and the view outside the window are really nice.

msg:Before checking into the Wyndham Grand Hotel last night, I called to inquire about some situations. The staff who answered the phone and Miss Jossce from the Guest Relations Depar**ent who was later in charge of the connection not only perfectly answered my and my lover's questions, but also thoughtfully arranged the room in advance, connected with the front desk brother, and upgraded the room type for us for free. This provided us with a very complete service for one night's stay and rest, and brought us a very warm and satisfactory experience. The room itself is also very large, with a very high ceiling, and the air circulation is very good. Various facilities are very complete, and the experience of using the swimming pool and the gym is also very good. The service awareness of the staff is very good, but the water temperature of the heated swimming pool is still a bit cold at night in this season, which can be improved. The last time I chose Wyndham, I still received my good brother from South Korea. The overall feeling of staying here by myself this time is really great. No wonder my good brother praised it last time. The advantage of the geographical location makes the view in the room quite good. When taking a bath in the bathtub, you can see the night view and light show of Ping An Center and the surrounding CBD. This double bathtub is indeed quite large. It was very quiet to sleep at night, and the bedding was very good. In short, it is a highly recommended place to stay in Shenzhen Futian Central District. I am very grateful to Jossce and her colleagues for their thoughtful service. I will continue to choose Wyndham when I travel nearby next time.

Hygiene is so bad! It was hard to eat wild food, and I felt very angry. I added money for afternoon tea, but I didn’t dare to eat it. Sushi, sandwiches, and cakes seemed to be left all day long, but no one had eaten them. Many insects flew away. I have never experienced such poor service...

msg:Although the location is very convenient, it is only a ten-minute drive to Bonjour Intown or Bonjour Center. Knowing that we were here to celebrate an anniversary, we arranged the room in advance, but the service attitude at the front desk was average and did not say that we would welcome you attentively. For a similar price and in a nearby area, Hilton's service will be better than this hotel. In addition, the weight scale in the room was broken, and the light of the magnifying mirror in the bathroom was also broken. I don't think anyone expected to have so much damage staying in a five star hotel, let alone celebrating an anniversary. Really not a good experience.

1. Geographical location: The geographical location is superior, just outside Exit D of Gangxia Metro.
2. Housing experience: room facilities and bedding are clean and tidy.
3. Fitness facilities: The swimming pool is a bit small.
4. Room view: The city view is very good.
5. Surrounding restaurants: The restaurant downstairs and No. 79 Fishing Boat opposite have good food.
Finally, special thanks to Jossce for his thoughtful service and birthday gift! I was touched by the handwritten birthday card. Thank you very much!

Only because the room was too close to the cleaning storage room, I heard the rumble of the cart early in the morning, which woke me up.
In addition, the bathroom is very spacious, but when you open the door after taking a shower, water will flow to the toilet cubicle, so you need to wipe the floor with a towel.
But the overall experience is good.

Luckily, I was assigned a room on the 33rd floor. The view is very good. It is facing the Ping An Financial Center. You can also enjoy the view while taking a bath. And I personally think the bathtub is the most eye-catching. The bathtub space is very large and it is very comfortable to soak. Overall, the stay experience is very good. I am also curious to ask why it is so cheap. I see that the normal price is around 800-900.

Since the flight delay notice was issued early in the morning, they also helped to delay the check-out time by half an hour. But there are also problems. When I checked in, I was arranged to room 2002, but when I arrived at the room, I found that the room was not cleaned at all. I feel that the management is quite chaotic. Can't I see whether the room has been cleaned in the system? And it was almost five o'clock when I checked in. Such mistakes should not happen. I couldn't get through the front desk phone on the 20th floor, so I had to go back to the first floor to solve it. It feels very bad. After moving to the 25th floor, the bathtub was cracked. Equipment and service points were deducted.

I booked a car to the airport at 1 o'clock, and finally called the hotel to send a staff member to take the order.

After he saw the scene, he contacted the front desk again. Another service staff arrived and changed the room next door without any explanation. During this period, I also called Ctrip to question the service level of this hotel.

Although the hotel provides WiFi, the network cannot be found. I don’t know why, and I didn’t investigate further.

I regretted it as soon as I entered the room and wanted to check out. The room was dark and the equipment was decorated in an old hotel style. The view outside the window was even more indescribable. . .
You actually said that the night view here is beautiful? ? ? The first picture is the night view I saw at the Yifei Hotel in Chegongmiao the night before. I really want to praise the Yifei Hotel here. The price is really good and there are a lot of restaurants nearby. The most important thing is that the front desk is very warm and considerate. Before checking in, the hotel guy enthusiastically reminded us that there was construction downstairs in the room and asked us if we wanted a free upgrade. After we said it was okay, we checked in considerately. But at the front desk of Wyndham, I made it clear that I didn't need to buy breakfast. I asked my friend again if I wanted to pay for it. Then my friend asked about the hotel room and ignored it. Haha.
Facilities: Old, especially the toilet smells bad.
Service: It can be said that there is no service. I am not sorry for the price.
Pay cash at the front desk and get an instant 20 yuan discount on the room rate: Speaking of this, I got angry again. The hotel will not give you a deduction. Later, I saw that the refund was wrong, so I checked it out and asked the customer service. The customer service said that it had been deducted after verifying with the hotel. I sent the screenshots of the payment and refund, and then refunded 20 to me. If you enjoy your stay, it's okay to leave it as a tip. But the service attitude of the front desk is not worthy! ! !

There is a water leak in the shower. Because of the marble floor, I had to wear slippers and slip to the street.

The water in the swimming pool is not at a constant temperature, so there is no swimming
We all understand that there are many mainlanders living there, but regardless of whether they are mainlanders or Hong Kongers, the attitude is very important😅
It is recommended to follow up on the service attitude of the staff

msg:Location: The hotel is located near Futian Port. Take Line 10 from Futian Port and arrive at Gangxia Station for two stops. Exit D is the hotel.
There are restaurants such as No. 79 Fishing Boat Seafood Restaurant near the hotel, and there is a Meiyijia convenience store downstairs. It is also a 15-minute walk from the hotel to Huangting Square. ￼

Facilities: The hotel has a robotic food delivery service. You need to take a photo of the elevator to reach your room floor. The security is good. There is a Nespresso coffee machine in the room, but the mini bar requires an additional fee. The room is located on the 35th floor and the shower water pressure is sufficient.

Hygiene: The pillows and quilts are very clean, there is no other odor, and there is no hair in the bathtub, drain and wash basin.

Environment: The hotel arranges rooms on the 35th floor. The rooms are divided into one living room and one room. They all have large floor-to-ceiling glass and the night view is great.

Service: When I booked the hotel, I requested a high-floor room to celebrate my birthday. When I arrived at the hotel, the room was a little sp****ly decorated. I was also given a birthday cake and a stuffed animal after check-out.

A small incident was that after returning to the hotel in the evening, there was no frozen water in the shower, and all the water was hot water. After enquiry, I learned that there was an emergency repair. It returns to normal after about 20 minutes.

I have some suggestions for the hotel: after the windows are closed at night, the lights in the room are dim, so some lights should be installed, especially outside the shower. There is insufficient light. During the shower, water flows out of the corridor, and it may slip if you are not careful.

There is a convenience store next to the hotel and a 24-hour porridge shop across the street, which is very convenient. The room is very clean and large. The breakfast is average, there is no seat service, you have to find a seat by yourself, and the waiter will not wait until the guests leave. I took the hot milk, because there was not much in the bottle, and it was flowing out drop by drop. At that time, a male staff member saw it, but turned a blind eye. It was probably 9:10, and breakfast was almost finished anyway, so I added half a cup anyway. never mind. Most of the waiters work slowly and methodically, with little enthusiasm. It would be better to smile more. Breakfast is the same as self-service.

It is very convenient for eating and going to scenic spots. However, there is still vibration noise on the subway. The disadvantage is that the breakfast is average. Although it looks good There is some basic food, but nothing delicious. It cannot be said to be a five-star hotel in this regard.

The main reason for the five stars is the swimming pool, which is really good, 25 meters long and quite long. I drove here this time, so I would like to share my parking experience. Underground, B2 has more parking spaces, but the aisle is really narrow. There is a door directly from the lobby to the parking lot, which is more convenient.

msg:At about 2:00 in the morning, I was suddenly hit by a huge black insect crawling around on my bed and touched my hands and feet. At first I thought it was something like hair that touched me. I woke up several times and ended up leaning over. I looked up and saw a huge bug, about half the size of an egg, crawling on the white sheets on the bed. The particularly big one was black and crawled very fast. I didn’t know it was a cockroach🪳 Or bedbugs? ￼I have never seen such a big bug in my whole life. I was so scared that I quickly covered it with a quilt and tried to crush it to death￼￼, but he ran away too fast. ￼￼￼￼The sanitary environment is really bad. This environment looks good on the surface, but in reality there are cockroaches and bedbugs crawling into your bed in the middle of the night. ￼Contacting the hotel staff to deal with it, they just rummaged through the bedding and said they didn't see it. ￼￼￼I only blame myself for not catching the bug and recording it. The hotel said they would change me to a suite, ￼but Can I trust other rooms in the hotel? The shadow on my heart was very big. I didn’t dare to go near the bed. I really wanted to change the hotel and leave, but it was 3:00 in the morning. I was sleepy and scared. It was too late. It was very late to pack my luggage and take a taxi. It was so inconvenient that I had to change rooms and stayed there without sleeping. When I checked the bed in the suite, I found that the quilt was yellow and dirty. It was such a scary experience. I stayed up until about 5:00 in the morning and left the hotel. I canceled my Window of the World itinerary for the next day and changed my ticket to the earliest high-speed rail ticket that day. ￼￼￼￼I don’t even dare to stay in a hotel because I’m afraid something will suddenly appear in the middle of the night. ￼Contact Ctrip platform, ￼The hotel's reply was that the 170 fee would be refunded. ￼I would rather not have you refund this money, you deserve the corresponding punishment! ! I don’t know how he managed to get a luxury hotel in this kind of environment? ￼Is he worthy? ￼￼Does the supervision depar**ent only look at the surface?

Moreover, knowing that it was my husband's birthday, the room was specially decorated and a cake was given, which was very heartwarming. However, I didn't have a lighter, so I couldn't light candles and make wishes, which was a bit of a drawback. The room is spacious! The place is clean and the location is convenient. Just downstairs is the Gangxia subway station. Finally, I cannot but praise the sister who manages the room. I am a guest in room 3020. Since I have not yet occupied the room, the water in my room has been finished. The sister who manages the room immediately gave me water to drink and taught me how to clean it. The lighting in the room is good, and it will be easy to clean the room. Thank you to the hotel staff for their professional service attitude. I will definitely book a room again next time.

Done, we adults didn't sleep at all, a five-star hotel is completely unacceptable to me.
This time it was all children who requested to stay again. The last time I stayed, I already felt that the staff were completely expressionless. This time, they were so small. They didn't ask us about the night's situation at all when we checked out. We will not stay in this hotel again.

msg:My stay at Wyndham Grand Shenzhen was beyond my imagination. The hotel is located in Futian District and is extremely cost-effective. It is a truly high-end hotel. On my birthday, the hotel surprised me with a free birthday cake, a small detail that made me feel very special and welcome.

The most impressive thing is that the hotel upgraded my room to a deluxe king room on the top floor. The bathtub in this room is located next to the window. You can enjoy the night view of Futian District CBD while taking a bath, which is beautiful and relaxing. The location of the hotel is very convenient. It takes 3 minutes to walk to the Bonjour Center business district, 5 minutes to walk to the subway station, and 7 minutes to Futian Port by taxi.

Breakfast is also a highlight. It is definitely worthy of the standards of a five-star hotel. It has a rich variety and outstanding taste.

The only small drawback is that the switches in the room are not particularly sensitive, and the position settings of some lights are not convenient and reasonable. Although there were road construction and construction activities nearby, it didn't affect my stay.

Overall, it was an unforgettable stay and I highly recommend Wyndham Grand Shenzhen to travelers looking for a luxurious experience.

￼The barbecue set meal provided with the hotel package is average in taste, but the service is first-rate! We were so full that we called the front desk to see if we could have the food delivered to our room later. They delivered it to our room at 9:30 pm!
The only problem is that the windows may not be open and the room is very dusty.
If you ask ** to deliver food in the morning, a robot will deliver it! The robot is so cute!
I slept very soundly, but I still had to beg twice. Overall very happy. 90 marks

Opposite are two popular restaurants. There is always a long queue for every meal. I ate at one of them and it was really delicious😋The hotel room is great. The high-rise suite is very large and has a panoramic view of the city. The lights are bright at night. It is so bright that you can see the prosperity of the city at a glance. The bedding is very comfortable and the bed is large. I am very satisfied with it as I am very picky about sleep. I like the cloakroom the most, it’s big and practical, so convenient! The only thing that needs improvement is that the floor at the bathroom door is too slippery. It will be very slippery if it touches a little water. I almost fell down a few times. The breakfast variety is not very rich, but there are some Cantonese characteristics, and the taste is okay. The service is good. There is a charge for breakfast for children. Miss Eva at the front desk gave the children a free breakfast, which is very nice. The rest need to pay 88 yuan per day. It would be better if it can be given for two days. Overall, I feel good, highly recommended!

The overall environment and service of the hotel are good. It is very close to the subway station and the business trip. I will stay here next time. The room is clean. Sunny at the front desk has good and thoughtful service. The facilities are also complete and the hygiene is very good. The location is good and shopping is very convenient. Will come again next time

msg:An old five-star hotel, compared with the floor height, room type, and size, is still worth the price in Shenzhen. Nick at the front desk was very helpful. He solved problems and checked in very quickly. He also helped with upgrades and arranged a high-rise room. The night view was unobstructed and very beautiful. Breakfast is on the 3rd floor. It has been carefully designed. The decorations are very cute. There are rice rolls, porridge and other stalls. It is a highly recommended hotel!

msg:When I checked into the room, there were two people at the front desk. One was checking in other guests, and the other was busy staring at her phone the whole time, running around and passing by me several times without saying hello. I stared at her. For a while, he didn’t even raise his eyes to look at me, let alone say hello. When another front desk officer finished checking in other guests, he basically only said three sentences to me to complete the check-in. The first sentence, please show your ID, the second sentence, please sign here, and the last sentence, the third sentence that is more interesting, While handing me the room card, he asked me to please leave a review when the time comes. . . . There was no greeting during the entire check-in process, let alone an introduction to hotel facilities, or even directions to the elevator. It can be said that there is no basic service that a 5-star hotel should have. The wash basin in the room ran very slowly, and the water temperature in the shower room was extremely difficult to control. It was either too cold or too hot. The only advantage is that the deluxe room I booked has a high floor and a good night view.

The room is on the 24th floor. Although there is construction going on, I can only hear very light construction sounds occasionally. The bed in the room is very solid and I can sleep all night without discomfort in the waist. I can watch TVB. The bathtub is very clean. The children with me had a great time soaking in the bath.
After landing at the subway station, you can go to the Bonjour shopping mall. There is a supermarket with many kinds of items.
A little more, the shopping mall and the food street under the subway are charged at 10 o'clock in the morning. There is only one or two breakfasts available in the food street after 8 o'clock in the morning, but there is a 711 in the underground food street. There is also a convenience store in the hotel isolation center where you can also buy food.
I recommend this hotel and will choose to stay again next time.

In addition, it was very rainy on the day of my stay, and there were bell boys and other people who got out of the car and entered the hotel, but I didn't have a cover or a cover, so I went to the subway station. Wet. It's close to the subway and shopping malls, but the impression is so bad that it's not worth the price.

The room is spacious and comfortable, especially the mattress is of medium softness and firmness. The family was full of praise for it. Also worthy of praise is that the lighting in the room can be controlled through the bedside lighting system, which includes the switches of curtains and window screens. The check-in process was quick and smooth, and the housekeeping service responded quickly to our requests. Since it was a short stay, I did not use other hotel facilities and catering services, so I cannot comment here.

Later, when I asked, it was because my takeaway could not fit in the robot, so they didn't deliver it to me, and they didn't call to say anything.

The hotel room is spacious, but the sheets in the room were a bit stained the first time, which made this experience a bit reserved.

The buffet is very rich, clean and hygienic, but the oysters are relatively light, and everything else is very good! ￼

msg:The hotel upgraded the room for us, and there are some careful arrangements ❤️❤️ Special praise for a South Asian lobby attendant, who speaks Mandarin very well and is very nice.

The view in the room is very open, and the view from the bathtub is also very good. However, for a five-star hotel, the environment and service are still a bit unsatisfactory.

First, the temperature of the air conditioner is not enough, and I woke up several times at night due to the heat🥲🥲

Second, there is only one delivery robot, so the waiter will always say that it will take 15-20 minutes to deliver it during the peak period of delivery, and once even said that it will take 20 minutes to deliver it, and finally go down to get it by yourself. .

First, there was dust on the table and the table, which was not wiped clean.
Second, the air conditioner cannot adjust the temperature, so it’s a bit hot to sleep at night.
Third, there is a peculiar smell in the bathroom. It seems that the bathroom does not have an exhaust function.
Fourth, the good thing is that it is very close to Gangxia Metro Station and is very convenient.

msg:The details of the service are really bad. Unlike a five-star hotel, the staff speak bluntly and don’t smile. The concierge at the door won’t help with luggage, and won’t help to carry luggage into the car when they see a girl. Just watch from the side, hygienic Ordinary, the towels on the sofa will not be collected, just spread there. If the child wants to take a bath, he needs a disposable bathtub cover, which costs an extra 20. At least I don’t charge for it in other hotels, and I didn’t charge 20 as they said because the quality is better and it costs money. Plastic bags, your hotel costs 1,000 yuan a day, you ask me for the cost of plastic bags? I readily gave 👌. I forgot what kind of restaurant is on the left side of the entrance on the first floor. It is too unpalatable. The salmon in the salmon salad is black and black. The raw salmon and black look like a lump of noodles. Do you dare to eat it? The fruit tea is too bitter to drink. I suspect they have never tasted this taste. Dogs don’t even eat it and serve it to guests? The location is okay, the decoration in the room is very ordinary hotel, not very new, to be honest with these details and the price, I don't recommend everyone to come here.

       1. Is the payment confirmation process of your hotel only through email, and is the reply address of the hotel unavailable?
        2. I renewed my room reservation the next day and during the repeated communication process, why didn’t the hotel staff inform me that the currently booked room type does not match the renewed room type?
        3. After booking a room of a higher level than the previous day, why do you still ask the guest for payment? By how many levels will the hotel's upgraded room types be upgraded? Can I understand that my original room type was full and I did not make a reservation due to improper hotel management?
        4. Is it the service principle of your hotel's corporate culture promotion for the hotel to call the room during lunch break after I repeatedly told them not to disturb my guests unless it is urgent?
        5. It is difficult to guarantee the basic demands of customers, so why do they repeatedly make promises beyond their capabilities? Why don't you take the initiative to contact me personally to solve the problem when you can't meet your promise?
       6. Have the relevant personnel of your hotel experienced the most basic business training and the most basic promotion of service concepts? Or is it just me, do you expect your hotel to exceed the industry average? If it is my problem, I will reflect on myself and offer my most sincere apology to your hotel!

Is there anyone who urges customers like this? The worst self-service experience in a star-rated hotel

Not recommended

Hygiene: Very clean and cleaned 🧹 very carefully

Environment: except the lobby is a bit small, everything else is good

Service: The service is very good, from the welcome at the door to the room service are very satisfactory

It's a good deal to rent a swimming ring for 10 yuan a day

msg:The location of the hotel is very convenient. The check-in process was very slow and took about 15 minutes. We booked a suite. The room was quite big and the bed was comfortable, but the hygiene of the room was poor. The windows were dusty, and there was some yellow liquid on the toilet board. We didn’t know if it was pee. We didn’t dare to use that toilet. Fortunately, there were 2 toilets. It was too late, so we didn’t change the room. We didn’t provide cotton swabs and cotton pads. It was delivered, and I was urged to ask when it was delivered to the front desk. I asked, and waited for another 15 minutes and saw that it hadn't been delivered. We planned to go down to the front desk to get it. When we opened the door, we saw only 2 cotton swabs and only 2 cotton swabs. Those things are placed on the ground, don’t the hotel know how to be hygienic? If you use the things on your face, you put them on the ground without calling the door, who dares to use them. Finally, you can call ** to deliver them. There are more than 1,000 rooms that don’t even have cotton. If you don’t give these basic things, it’s still considered a hotel? The most outrageous thing is that the 1,000 deposit was not refunded after check-out, so I called to ask for a refund, but the front desk called me back and said that a towel was dyed pink and 110 would be deducted from the deposit. I guess it was mixed up with other rooms If it’s on our head, we’ve never used anything pink before. How could there be a towel dyed pink? The front desk said that cleaning found it in the bathtub, so I said it’s impossible. The bath ball we bathe in is orange. There is no pink, and I also said that I can show the receipt to prove that we bought orange, and we found floating objects after we put the bath balls and boiled the water. We put all the water and washed the bathtub again before we dared to take a bath. The bath ball is gone, can clean water dye the towel pink? When it comes to this, the hotel is willing to refund the deposit in full. I won't come again. It's a hotel with no quality.

The last night of Shenzhen people's Shenzhen trip chose Wyndham
Too bad it doesn't deserve to be called a 5 star hotel very poor service and sanitation very bad very disappointing

There is a construction site next to Gangxia subway station. Construction starts at 8:00 in the morning and ends at 11:00 in the evening.
I checked in after watching xhs. I asked for a room that could see the direction of Ping An Financial Center. I gave it to the 19th floor of the lowest floor. The room directly faced the opposite building under construction. There was no reminder at all when checking in.
After asking for a room change, I was told that there was only one clean room facing the same direction, but it was relatively small. It was already past four o'clock and I was too lazy to toss. I wanted to take a break and go to dinner, so I agreed.
The location is next to the room where the facilities are placed. The staff can hear clearly in the room when they walk and talk.
Poor hygiene Large stains on the carpet Water stains around the tub Lots of weird spots on the tiles Bathroom floor tiles look like mold
The mirrors in front of the shower and bathtub look like double-sided mirrors. The mirrors in the shower are still deformed. The smoke alarm is set above the toilet. The camera is really bad
Old facilities, dim lighting, no lights in the closet, air conditioning, and noise, unreasonable placement of items, drinking water is not placed on the mini bar, but in the bathroom
The service is still very poor. It's weird. I asked what was the reason for changing rooms. I said that it was opposite the construction site. There was no follow-up. When I checked out, I asked how the room was. Just like the process, ask a symbolic question

Really nothing but the scenery

When I went to the scene, Miss Lucy was very friendly and enthusiastic to help me place an order on Ctrip, saving more than 100 yuan and giving me an upgrade. After entering the room, I also took special care of the baby. Miss Lucy and a lady next to her gave the baby building blocks and toys, and the baby liked it very much. After check-in, the staff quickly brought over the baby set cleaning supplies. The very cute duckling baby washes the whole product set. The baby is very happy to brush his teeth, and he is also very active in brushing his teeth the next morning! The room is very comfortable and spacious, and the high-altitude night view is very beautiful! It is comparable to my high-altitude night view, haha. Breakfast is on the third floor, and all the staff in the restaurant are very nice! Great service 👍! This Wyndham is very close to my home. The home was renovated before. My husband booked it here for a week. The company signed an agreement and there are discounts for households. In short, if we book a hotel, our first choice will be this one! The transportation is convenient, and it is very convenient to go anywhere in the urban area. You can choose with confidence.

The gym is on the 31st floor. You can watch the scenery while exercising. The equipment is also first-class and top-level Lifefitness. The exercise track is first-class, and there is a semi-standard swimming pool.

The only advantage is that the high-rise scenery is really good, especially in the direction of Ping An Building. It is hard to say anything else. The breakfast buffet is really sorry for the five-star hotel. The self-service is too scary. It is rarely very ordinary. The only child who goes in does not know what to eat. The room is huge and small, like an express hotel, but later we changed the room. Good, but the overall a**osphere is quite disappointing. I think five-star rating still needs a full sense of experience. Children say bad reviews. It may really only be suitable for a short stay on a business trip. It is very fast. ! !

Facilities and environment are also good, convenient transportation in the city center. Maybe I got off the plane and arrived at the hotel a little late that day. The TV station in the room had several creaking sounds, or there was no sound from one or two stations, and I was too lazy to change it. The rest are very good. The room is also cleaned for me every day. The most important little detail is that he also kindly helped me to fold the pajamas that were thrown on the sofa. There is also one who needs nucleic acid collection. You can take the subway to Hall 5 of the Convention and Exhibition Center. In front of the gate, the hotel requires 24-48 hours nucleic acid certificate to enter and exit
Finally, to sum up, the service of the front desk staff is good. When checking out, there is a foreign waiter who seems to be a little brother named Hassan (good Chinese)
The hotel is also equipped with foreign waiters for different groups of guests, not bad! I will stay here next time I come to Shenzhen

The location is great, just outside the subway entrance of Gangxia Station. It is a 5-minute walk to Bonjour Center and a 10-minute walk to Ping An Center.
The breakfast was great and rich!
Our family of three booked a family room, which costs 350 per night for an extra bed.
The first room, 2005, was noisy, but it was much quieter when I moved to the 19th floor.
The washing machine in the room is awesome: you have to wash your clothes every day when you come back from playing, right? Hands free!

msg:Very bad experience, the price does not match the actual standard. First of all, the service attitude of the swimming area of the hotel is poor. The wardrobe in the changing area cannot be opened. I asked the little brother at the door. The little brother clearly had the key in his hand and told us that there were many people in the swimming area and there were no lockers. When I actually went to the swimming area, there were more children. It seemed that there were at most three families. How could there be no empty wardrobes in the men's and women's areas? The room is ok, the space is large, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are also high, but the scenery outside the window depends on luck. My friend's window is closer to the city, so it is all high-rise buildings. The sunset in the evening is also beautiful. I am her door, and it is relatively empty. , the orientation is not correct, the sunset cannot be seen, and the scenery is slightly inferior. What I want to complain most is that the air conditioner is too rubbish. The minimum temperature is 19°C. My boyfriend is more afraid of heat. Finally, I want to complain about the hotel's breakfast. I had a stomachache when I was eating and went to the toilet. When I went back to the toilet and went back to eat, my stomach hurt again after I didn't eat for a while, so I went back to the room and continued to use the toilet. I had a stomachache by myself, probably because I had a bad stomach, but my friends also ate badly. I did a Splatoon together, and I felt a little bit of food poisoning. After that, we had to leave Shenzhen according to the journey, and my stomach was still uncomfortable on the way. Pulled for two or three days. I hope you can find out the reason. The four of us all had stomach discomfort after breakfast. Personally, I think it might be beef porridge. I went to the toilet with stomach pain after drinking porridge. After going to the toilet, I drank a few mouthfuls and my stomach hurt again, so I stopped eating and went back to the room to go to the toilet. Then because I was too sleepy, I fell asleep with the quilt, otherwise I couldn't sleep because of the stomach pain. When I woke up, my stomach was a little better, I thought it was okay and left, otherwise I should have gone to the hospital to check. All in all, this time I feel that the cost is not worth it, and the service does not match.

msg:The hotel "lobby" is too "big", almost no lobby.
The ceiling of the room is too high, 5 meters, uncomfortable.
The view outside the window turned out to be a construction site.
I don't know if it's construction or something outside the window at night, the noise is super loud, and there is continuous noise, I can't sleep all night.
The layout of the room is very inconvenient.
There is no luggage rack in the room, and there is no place to put the suitcase. I asked the waiter and said that this room type does not have a luggage rack.
Both I and the same time booked a deluxe double room. I also booked breakfast included. The price was 100 more expensive than my colleagues. As a result, the room type and view were particularly poor. My colleague’s price was lower but the room type was better, the view was better, and the room The area is much larger, and the bathtubs are double bathtubs.
The breakfast is average and not very rich.
I couldn't find the switch for the bedside downlight. I called the service center and a waitress said "I don't know". Is this Wyndham's service? I said again, so what should I do? The waiter said, "That's broken", and then called the engineering depar**ent to look at it, and finally found that the switch of the downlight on the right side of the bed was on the side of the left bedside table, how high an IQ can a person design like this? do not understand. That switch doesn't work yet.
When I finally left the hotel to carry the luggage to the car, the doorman saw that he was going to carry the luggage to the car.
This kind of environment and facilities, this kind of service, 850 a night is too worthless, and I will not live here again when I come to Shenzhen in the future.

msg:I lived in Nanshan before. This time I chose this hotel with a good location because I was working in Futian. When I checked in, the Indian guy at the front desk was fluent in Chinese and had a good attitude. I had a good impression of this hotel, but I slept at night. At that time, I was busy on a business trip for a whole day, and I was so sleepy. I didn’t expect that the emergency light on the ceiling at the door would “drip” every few minutes, and then the light would flash again. This tormented me all night. At first I thought the room was too dark, so I turned on the night light, but it still kept flashing frequently. It was too much to bear after one o'clock in the middle of the night, so I called the customer service number and the front desk directly, but no one answered. I really didn’t want to go downstairs in my pajamas, so I stayed awake all night. I checked out decisively the next day and went to the front desk to complain. It’s not that I blackmailed the hotel for not wanting to pay the room fee. After all, I was on a business trip, but I didn’t sleep well all night. I feel really uncomfortable~ The lobby manager later came forward to coordinate, and the solution was a free upgrade for the next stay and a free buffet breakfast. Because I had to rush to the next place to do business, I didn't argue all the time, so I paid the room fee and left. I am not satisfied with the result of this trea**ent. I am affected by the rights and interests of customers this time. The hotel's solution is to make up for it next time. That's it. I won't choose again next time. Sorry for the price, it comes from a real stay experience.

When I came back the next day, I was helped to fold my pajamas and make the bed, and changed my towels and bath towels. The bath towels used were taken away without being replenished, the towels on the floor mats were not replaced and were still wet, and the peels of the melons and fruits that had been eaten were not taken away or taken away.
There is no need to spend money if you don’t eat breakfast here. It is basically left over from the buffet the day before. The breakfast for four days is basically the same, and it is basically the same. I drank white porridge for four days

With a large bathtub, the price/performance ratio is really great! It also gave us a birthday cake, which is very good~ But this time I didn't clean it very carefully.

msg:Check-in at night, when I arrived at the room, I felt that the room was a little dark, and there were more dark corners in the room. I won't be very tired after working all night these days because I didn't care too much, so I deliberately found a hotel to get a good night's sleep first. Go to bed and wash up. As a result, a series of speechless things came!
The first one, after 9 o'clock in the evening, I walked into the bathroom and found that there was no hot water. I called the front desk and he said, oh oh, we know that the hot water is broken and the works are being repaired. He told me to turn on the faucet and wait for a while. I said yes. Then about ten o'clock, I heard the sound of hot water coming. I waited ten minutes to go to the bathroom to see it, and the water was full of yellow water! ! Dirty is not good, I let the water out, I am worried and unwilling to let the water, the water is a little clean, and I don't want to soak it, so I take a shower and get ready to sleep.

The second silent incident: I slept until after 11 o'clock, and found that it was getting hotter and hotter, and I was sweating all over, but I didn't exaggerate and really sweat! Call the front desk for feedback, and Qian wants to say, "Yes, that air conditioner is broken. It's really repairing. Wait a minute." I asked how long it would take. He said he wasn't sure, I looked at the time and it was almost twelve o'clock. I couldn't sleep because of the heat, so I ordered a takeaway and prepared to wait.

The third speechless thing: after twelve o'clock in the morning, the customer service called me and told me that it was not so fast, and told me to change the room. So I was helpless to pack up and change rooms.

I have nothing to be unhappy about when things have developed here, and Zhi feels rather unlucky.

Then the big silent event came! ! !

I moved me to the top floor of the 35th floor, the room is a little smaller than the previous layout (but this is not particularly important, I just wanted to sleep and rest) and then! ! This room! ! So many mosquitoes! ! !

The day before I entered the hotel, I slept for more than three hours because of work overtime, and my spirit was very bad, so I fell asleep after putting things in for a while, and I was woken up by mosquitoes at three in the morning! All over the bag!

I went to Lianhua Mountain for a walk and I didn't spend nearly 700 yuan to stay in this hotel for one night and I was bitten by my bag! Hands, back, face, legs, chest are all bags! It was so itchy that I wondered whether it was mosquito bites or whether the bed was not clean!

Then get up at 2 am to fight mosquitoes until more than 4 am! Stop talking about me! Itchy and sleepy! Finally hit the other one at four o'clock.

One more thing to add, when I first started my job, I wanted to take a shower and found that there was no shower cap everywhere in the room. Then I asked the staff to send one when I changed rooms. When I finished typing at 5 in the morning and was going to wash it, I opened the package and found that the elastic cord of the shower cap was broken.... It can't be used at all...
It's almost like I'm going to break down here... but it's not over yet...

Friends, when I got up in the morning to wash up, I saw two healthy mosquitoes flying around in the bathtub!

At this point, I really must say that your hotel's hygiene and service are too worrying! This price is about the same as the surrounding five-star! I came here specially to rest and get some sleep first! ! As a result, I came here to be tossed and fed mosquitoes all night!

I am early. I didn't go to eat, but I can imagine that it is impossible to get up and eat again at 90 this morning.

If the hotel does not improve, then everyone avoids Room 08 on the 35th floor. There are mosquitoes 🦟

The room environment is good, the floor-to-ceiling windows are large, and the outside scenery is very beautiful, especially at dusk, and then the bathtub is very large, and the bath is very comfortable. It is recommended to watch the night view while taking a bath. But the complaint is that the air conditioner is very old, it can't be adjusted to 19 degrees, it is still very hot, and the TV is also very old, but the overall experience is not good, go swimming upstairs, the waiter asked us whether we have a swimming card or accommodation , we said accommodation, and then we said that we need a locker key to put clothes and valuables such as mobile phones. The waiter said that there were too many people swimming, and the locker was full and did not allow us to put clothes in the locker, so let us change from the room? ? ? As a result, there were only three children➕ an adult, and all the people who were not swimming were girls. There were so many cabinets. Besides, it was past ten o'clock in the evening, so what if there were still cabinets? Later, I found out that the locker is only for those who have a swimming card. We can only change our clothes and take our belongings to go swimming. In the end, the breakfast is not great, but it is simpler than the hotel where we stayed at over 300 a night. . . The most important thing is that there were four of us in our group. After eating, we all had diarrhea to varying degrees in the morning. We suspected that it was the problem of porridge, because we all drank porridge, but the porridge was freshly boiled. It is very strange, and it is recommended not to order porridge. All in all, the service of the waiters in the swimming area is not very good and it feels not worth it.

The location is right next to the subway Gangxia station, and there are many public bus stops. There are many convenience stores and restaurants around.
The room was clean and the view was good. The night view is beautiful. Unfortunately, I was bitten by a mosquito at midnight. There were mosquitoes on the upper floors. My child has been bitten by mosquitoes on his face in many places. I had no choice but to go to the front desk at midnight and borrow mosquito repellent goods. It seems that the mosquitoes have died since the mosquito repellent goods were placed. After that, I slept with peace of mind.
Breakfast is plentiful. There are many types of bread and many types of Chinese food. I had a relaxing breakfast time.

1. The parking lot is small, the lights are dim, the parking space is super narrow, and the exit of the parking aisle is very narrow. I tried many times before driving out.
2. The elevator coming in from the parking lot is the elevator as shown in the figure, and the elevator coming out is the scene like a construction site
3. The small image of the reception hall went to a small coffee shop
4. The main road is at the door, and the road is still being built, without any privacy
Wyndham’s house prices are no different from the four seasons nearby, the Sheraton
I also spend money to buy it and feel uncomfortable. I just leave a message and hope that others will not be scammed again.

msg:To be honest, based on the good experience of staying at Wyndham Hotels in other cities before, this time I came to Shenzhen and booked Wyndham, but the result was quite disappointing. The actual hotel is no matter the decoration, supporting facilities, parking lot, and interior of the room. The design is not satisfied, at most it is a quasi-four-star apar**ent hotel. The internal floor of the room is quite high, but it looks like an apar**ent or office building is remodeled. The lobby is very small. The most dissatisfied is the super small parking lot. The aisles are narrow, and the elevators to enter and exit the parking lot have to enter and exit from the door of another building. It does not meet the five-star requirement. Although the night view outside the window is acceptable, the building next door is now under construction at 7 o'clock in the morning. Was awakened by construction! Quite helpless about this choice...not worth the five-star price

msg:Every time I use Ctrip to book rooms and tickets. It is best not to stay deep in the epidemic, but to celebrate the birthday of my mother, I chose Wyndham Grand Hotel under the three shops.

Service: I'm still very satisfied with the environment, especially the room that the customer service lady and brother helped me secretly decorate the room. I am very satisfied, and my mother likes it very much. Everything is worth it, mainly because the customer service has an extremely good attitude and patiently answer any questions I put forward.

Facilities: Same as normal hotels. The fitness facilities and swimming pool are more conventional. Originally wanted to go to the executive lounge and finally did not go to the club due to time. It is on the same floor as the fitness facilities. The feeling of enjoying the private room is really great.

Buffet dinner: 248 adults on Friday night. This is by far the worst buffet I have ever eaten at this price. The price/performance ratio is simple to the bottom. There is nothing delicious. If it’s not for a typhoon, I really don’t want the quality of it. I would rather eat fast food and give away mini oysters and a glass of wine that is not very delicious. The best dessert is the mousse with chocolate feathers attached. Others are really unable to complain!

Parking: There is an underground parking lot, and residents can park for free

Overall: The service that makes me most satisfied is the service, which can meet basically all my conditions. I will continue to consider choosing Wyndham next time. Thank you, ladies, sisters and brothers for their warm service!

The answer is blunt, and the attitude is not good.
Staying with expectation, the room with floor-to-ceiling windows and the corner room is indeed pleasant, but the afternoon tea with administrative trea**ent is really bad. There are three kinds of small cakes in the self-service refrigerator, soft drinks, three kinds of cookies, watermelon, and cantaloupe. . . But it is estimated that this will not be the case with dim sum, so happy hour said that adding salad on this basis, we just don't eat it. The swimming pool should be the smallest five-star swimming pool I have ever seen, but unfortunately forgot to take it. . . I can only say that the hotel is better than fewer people

Although the weather in Guangdong is still hot in October, there are still mosquitoes in the elevator, there are a large number of flying mosquitoes in the drain outlet of the shower room, and there are dead flying mosquitoes even in the bathtub!

msg:今次入住兩晚，頗失望。
特別揀選行政大床房，方便悠閑時到行政酒廊歇歇。怎料食物及飲品選擇不多，特別是食物，不知是為環保或是其他原因，每每需要問才知道會否提供，像配給一樣。所以第二天已經不再去了。
入到房間，房間面積大，樓底極高及有巨型浴缸，抵讚。
但明明是非吸煙房，廁所有煙味，直至退房仍有，不知是否中央抽風有問題。
最不解是退房當日上午，忽然覺得面部非常痕癢，赫然發現有蚊在床頭。
早餐選擇不算多。
比起附近的國際品牌五星酒店，這裏相對遜色，未必考慮再入住了。

前枱服務態度良好。
位置很好，附近就有好多間餐廳，可以給我們選擇。
房間設備充足。


差： 有蚊蟲，滅蟲工作有待改善，
房間照明按鈕設計上不清晰。


整體除了蚊蟲扣分外，都是不錯的選擇。

而在我們今午check out的時候，因為手機上有少許問題，要前台Dino先生幫忙處理，見到他不厭其煩地幫我解決問題，令我感覺到他們酒店的服務確勝一籌👍🏻

酒店大堂寬敞明亮,服務人員十分友好熱情,入住和退房手續都非常高效便捷。房間整潔舒適,配備齊全,床墊柔軟舒適,讓我得以好好休息。浴室乾淨明亮,提供了各類洗浴用品,滿足了基本需求。

酒店位置優越,步行即可抵達市中心的主要景點和購物中心,十分便利。酒店內部也設有餐廳和健身房,雖然規模不大,但基本滿足了我的用餐和健身需求。

總的來說,溫德姆酒店是一家非常值得推薦的商旅酒店。它擁有優質的硬件設施和貼心的服務,是商務出差或休閒旅遊的不錯選擇。我相信下次來此出差時,我還會選擇入住這家酒店。

外環境：一出酒店就是岗廈站D出口，連接連城新天地，十分方便！

服務：有服務員幫忙推行李，態度親切。
中午12:30到達酒店，本預計時間太早未有房間，打算放低行李先午餐，但超驚喜房間已經準備好，馬上可上房！

衛生：房間大，沒有看到灰塵，房間沒有煙味，算是一間清潔的酒店

設施：這是扣分點，原打算給小朋友游泳，到泳池才知道關閉了，小朋友非常失望！

- 我已經冇耐性，叫前台待我晚上回來，必須改回手動模式
- 夜晚半夜，被不知道什麼「東西」咬⋯不知被子污糟/還是其他，手臂/肩紅了幾點⋯
- 訂房明明係要求，安靜、不要尾房⋯什麼也沒有看清楚！
3: 連基本USB 插口都冇，電制十分過時/舊，問前台攞⋯一句冇就處理，還叫我自己去外面走廊有「充電寶」借，有冇考慮我11點夜晚著了睡衣⋯這是酒店，不是「民宿」
4: 還有，細仔自己一間房，叫room service -soup , 之後見到bath bubble ball ，便隨性用咗-點知原來收咗同個湯差唔多$，等我仲要浪費時間查看單據
5: 叫**12點前已經到咗前台，前台有提過，外賣員到打俾前台接食物》機械人送餐到房
- 第一時間打俾前台，男的話冇⋯，原來**到咗，前台講要20-25分鐘左右有機𢬿人服務.
- 我直接打俾外賣員回頭，細仔自己下樓取吧
這個酒店除咗交通方便（崗廈站直上）/ 房間大⋯真係想不出什麼優點
*我3人行，見網上圖片靚，還特別訂咗兩房間（差唔多$2000），我真係：浪費時間/金錢⋯
*全程冇負責任的經理，有專業團隊合作/polite manner 交流，就係bath bubble ball , 阿仔「誤會」用咗，也是因為冇clear note to client . 點解你們不會考慮吓，什麼是client compensation , 起碼我還記得你們的服務質素！

另外，服務雖然沒有大不敬，但是十分傲慢、死板，問酒店要前台要一次性杯子，衹會生硬回答沒有. 早上因為著急開會來不急坐下來吃早點，到餐廳問服務員是否方便打包一份易帶的點心路上吃，回答是可以的，然後給了餐盒讓我自己裝…我就拿了兩個餐包，剛準備裝點水果塊，餐廳經理立馬沖過來説水果衹能外帶整個水果（衹有香蕉和蘋果可以選，問題我又不愛吃這兩種），切塊的都不能外帶. 我就又問有沒有煎蛋，我帶一個好了，經理又來一句雞蛋不能外帶，涉及到食品安全問題。我並沒有打包多少好嘛，就2個小餐包，如果你們小氣不願意客户打包請直説，不用整出一副看似專業但是令人作嘔的解釋，餐廳經理嚴重差評，不但不專業******。住過所有五星酒店，頭一回聽到這種奇葩規定！！至少希爾頓面對同樣需求會貼心的問我愛吃什麼並幫我打包好。
這家酒店的衞生和服務絕對直接勸退，沒有下一次！

最貼心的安排是在床邊安排了兩對耳塞,正當我好奇為什麼有這樣的安排時,在晚上睡覺時就大派用場。旁邊房間在晚上十二點鐘時仍高談闊論地打電話,曾打電話去前台,希望同事有所跟進但情況仍未改善,心想這麼不好彩遇到這種客人。後來發現仍聽到這客人和太太的交談,甚至乎他在後半夜的鼻鼾聲也能聽見,就明白這不是員工和客人的問題,而是房間設計上有結構性的問題。
相信這個價位在深圳的酒店,應該有更好的選擇。

1.酒店位置不錯，周圍商圈發達，好幾家想吃的就在步行範圍內。酒店設施保養還行。
2.前面差評所✍️的衞生間地板🈶️血點，其實是衞生間地板和牆面大理石自帶的紋路。
3.前台和保潔服務很好，但是我分打這麼低，是因為以下。
4.酒店門僮根本不存在吧？但是我2次到達酒店 2次出酒店，都是奔馳級別，居然也不幫忙拿行李，不幫忙開門？ 我每次都還看見有2個門僮，真是好工作啊，一視同仁，不管什麼車，我都不來服務，厲害厲害。
5.我們走江浙滬過來，在深圳感覺天氣很暖和，加上出門都專車接送，因此穿的比較少。妹子穿的短裙。看完演唱會吃完飯回來，電梯邊上居然被酒店那個男的攔下來，查詢住房訊息。理論上是應該配合，但是你別的人不問，就攔我們？ 穿的少讓你有了不良的聯想？還是歧視？還是你以為是？ 不管你做的對不對，我認為你歧視了，所以這差評送出。

服務真的非常一般，酒店也蠻舊的。
現在酒店對面在施工，吵，我完全不推薦。￼
好處是地理環境，還有冷氣夠。￼

msg:以下是不受幹擾的評價，酒店住房後會有人員聯繫住客希望給好評，下次入住會給升級房型&送水果，可能好評一部分是這麼來的。

酒店優點：1）地理位置方便，位於市中心，地鐵站很近，公交車站就在門口；2）早餐口味不錯，豐盛選擇麪廣

服務：真的很離譜，給兩顆星已經是最高了，1）讓送毛巾至房間等了足足20分鐘，送任何東西至房間都需要等待很長時間；2）酒店服務電話經常需要打2-3個才能通一個；3）門口禮賓服務人員寧願站着也不會幫忙拿行李；4）其他五星級酒店的服務也沒有

設施：設施老舊，衞生間的電話是壞的，但是衞生間比較寬敞這一點不錯

環境：不知道為什麼走廊、房間裏有股汗味，空氣不夠清新；房間燈光很暗，全開了燈也暗，無法調亮

衞生：床還可以，沒有明顯污漬，但由於空氣中有異味所以感受不好

其實，5月底就入住了。大堂不大，樓下有免費停車。禮賓部什麼的都有，服務沒得説。因為住的時間長，直接幫我升級了個豪華大床房。需要任何服務，來的很快。也可以幫忙送外賣和快遞上到房間。

但有一個點我不是很滿意，就是網絡。好像説工程部一直在整修了，網速最高1mb/s，看個視頻直播啥的偶爾會卡。到了洗手間信號都不太好。哎這個是硬傷！其他的都還是很不錯的

附近正在施工，要求了安靜朝向的房間也得到了滿足，高樓層景緻不錯，周邊交通方便，地鐵，騎行就在樓下，沒幾分鐘就是商場，吃喝玩樂是不用愁，外賣也很方便。
服務的話沒什麼特殊體驗，因為也沒有遇到什麼問題需要服務解決的，就常規的吧。

缺點：衣帽間裏這個變電箱（？）櫃子竟然沒有鎖住，有安全隱患
洗手枱這個下水有問題
空調是總控的，自己修改不了

謝謝前台升級到了套房的房型，白天覺得非常舒適，但是凌晨一點多被外面的空調掛機吵到無法入睡，被迫聯繫酒店要求換房，換到了一個設施簡陋（洗臉枱連洗漱用品都放不下，坐便器旁邊安裝了殘疾人扶手），看上去就是一個備用房間
酒店整體服務不太好，打電話去前台或者客房表明需求，都是十幾二十分鐘才有迴應的，配不上酒店的規格

msg:這是我近期住過的最差的"高檔"酒店，以後都不會再來，也一定勸退我的朋友來。
1. 酒店設施老舊，最讓人受不了的是空調開了跟沒開一樣，熱的要死，睡了一晚上被子沒蓋都嫌熱，都沒睡好，這還是所謂的高層"豪華大床房"。
2. 洗手間沖水系統也有點問題，不多按幾次可能沖不乾淨。而且沖完之後有奇怪的水聲，半夜上完廁所聽着水聲根本睡不着。
3. 隔音效果差。我去半夜被奇怪牆板撞擊聲吵醒，凌晨又被隔壁甩門聲吵醒，服了！
總之這是第一個我還沒到退房時間就想火速逃離的地方，真是勸大家別來，價格也不值得！

msg:優點：
1.入住房間景觀無敵，正對福田商圈高樓林立，趕上過年的燈光秀一覽無餘，房間大，洗漱間的空間設計尤其合理，臨窗的浴缸使得泡澡時也能夠欣賞到璀璨夜景；
2.泳池景觀無敵，視角同上，還面向小童提供泳圈等游泳設施很舒服，健身房也能俯瞰另一側夜景；
3.早餐品類很豐富，口味也不錯；
4.酒店位置挺好，交通方便。

不足：
1.從房間能看到酒店旁邊有一座建設中的高樓，建成之後感覺會對視野造成影響，入住時是過年，工地停工，不確定是否會有噪音；
2.可能是地段的限制，酒店大堂侷促，泳池也比較迷你。

綜上，入住的體驗相當不錯，尤其是房間內看到的景色，令人記憶深刻。
