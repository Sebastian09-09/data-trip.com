The furniture in the rooms are not very new, but still decent. Big balconies with beautiful views, many pools and restaurants on the territory. 
My son loves here and asks to come back. 
We chose this hotel in winter because it has a warm indoor pool so I don't worry about my child getting cold or burned under the sun

msg:Pros: 
1.Very close to the beach! Barely a walk at all!
2. Great for families with small children as there‚Äôs a lot of shallow pools good for toddler height 
3. Lots of slides. About 5 really good ones for ages 3+ and then some smaller ones for younger kids. Best part is adults can go on the slides too!
4. Good amount of pools and spread out which helps it feel less crowded. Also has a roofed in pool in a cave (great if it rains)
5. Excellent seaside buffet and fun entertainment like magic show, fire dancers etc.
6. Good service and staff add your wechat if you have problems they can speak English
7. Free photo shoot up to 5 pics for every hotel guest. 30 rmb extra for additional photos if wanted. Book 1 day in advance.
8. Lots of activities for kids like climbing frame, pottery making, a small zoo etc
9. Very close to a shopping plaza (across the street). They have traditional Hainan restaurants and even Hagen Das ice cream.
Cons:
1. If you don‚Äôt have small children you many feel very overwhelmed by the crowds of kids. I‚Äôve stayed at several 5 star hotels but this one feels the most noisy and bustling. Not as peaceful and serene like others. It‚Äôs just very crowded and the breakfast buffet gets crowded if you go too late. I highly suggest you don‚Äôt choose this hotel if you don‚Äôt have children ages 0-10. It‚Äôs really catered to that age group. It‚Äôs a paradise for kids!
2. Breakfast buffet doesn‚Äôt have a lot of western food choices. There are some. Managed to see waffles at some point but compared to other hotels the western food section is less.
3. The layout of the hotel is a bit confusing and hard to navigate but after a day or two it starts to make sense. It‚Äôs just like it‚Äôs own little busy town.
4. All of the hot tubs were empty and not functioning. Might be a seasonal thing but we like hot tubs even in July.
5. The map of the hotel and activity schedule for kids is only in Chinese. Would me nice if they had a bilingual version to help out foreign guests.

Overall, I would recommend you choose this hotel if you‚Äôre focused on the pool entertainment for younger kids and safety for kids not quite able to swim as there‚Äôs a lot of fun shallow pools and play areas.

msg:Our stay here was wonderful. The resort is massive, much bigger than we thought with many activities for young children as well. There are multiple pools for little children to adults. There are water slides as well, but these were not opened while we were here (not sure why but we also did not ask). Beach access is very close, so you can walk to the beach directly. We were able to check out late and store our luggage as well. The manager Yan shared his we chat and was so very helpful. He answered any questions we had immediately. The room (Elegant room with mini kitchen) was large and had two rooms (one with king bed and the other with single bed and pull out double sofa). Breakfast was great, lots of options for all diets (we are plant based and were able to have food to eat). We were very pleased with our stay here. Staff were very friendly and helpful, attentive as well. My only suggestion would be to equip rooms with mini kitchens with dish cloths to wash dishes (dish soap was provided, as well as laundry soap for washing machine), and also provide some spoons/forks/knives. This would be helpful when preparing food in the rooms and to clean dishes. We would highly recommend this resort, lots of activities and the pools are so many and big that they never seem crowded, and the beach so close there is lots to do.

msg:It‚Äôs kind of disappointed with the service level rendered by the hotel staff. First disappointment started when we reached the hotel lobby with taxi around 6pm as no one helped us to unload our luggages as we travelled with 2 young kids. Then we have to wait for more than 5 minutes to be served by lobby staff for check in process as there was only one staff working at the check in counter and she was entertaining a guess who was asking for direction and others amenities. Bear in mind we were next in queue. Shouldn‚Äôt this be directed to concierge? If you ever choose to stay in this hotel and wanted to ask for something, do approach more than 2 different person as all of them will give you a different answer. When asked if there is any free shuttle bus to the duty free shop from hotel, the bell boy say no. Then the next day I called the operator and she said there is but appointment need to be done a day earlier hence we were so angry with different service level provided. All the staff are lack of communication and didn‚Äôt know what they are doing. As our departure flight was late in the evening so we called the operator to ask for late check out by just one hour at 1pm and the answer was I will only be able to request it on the day itself and subject the hotel discretion. Do note that the timing I stayed was not a peak period in Sanya yet and this was the service level I received. There was no 5 star hotel in Sanya has given me such an answer before when I stayed in Sheraton, Pullman and MGM as I ever get late check out approval at 3pm and 4pm. However when I approached the check in counter, Mr Ocar was kind enough to immediately grant me that approval for late check out by 1 hour. As a comparison , the room rate I paid in this hotel was lot more expensive then Sheraton and Pullman with the same timing and quite similar room type but definitely not worth the value. This hotel is definitely not suitable for couple or adults who seek for quiet environment  as it is too noisy as the room was not soundproof. You can hear people walking and jumping at the upper floor and kids running at the corridor. The room is kind of old as well and they will not replenish tea bag, room slipper and toilet amenities everyday unless you ask for it. Swimming pool was kind of dirty with tree leaves residue. I only can say we will definitely not going to stay in this hotel anymore in future as damage was done and the hotel never attempt to do damage recovery during the 5 nights stay in their hotel despite complaints raised!

msg:The overall feeling is good. Although it is the off-season, there are still many children. There is a fresh fragrance in the corridor, which is quite comfortable. The room facilities do not feel old. We live on the 7th floor and there is no obvious feeling of dampness. The housekeeping staff are also very good and will take the initiative to say hello when they meet. The breakfast is not bad. We went to Man Xi Lang for breakfast at around 9 o'clock the next day. There were adults and children. We almost couldn't find a seat. However, the taste of several restaurants for dinner was average. If you mind, you can go to the commercial street next to it. There are also Pizza Hut and KFC. However, the seafood buffet by the sea is not bad, and there are entertainment performances. The children are very engaged in watching them. There are many parent-child activities, but there is no reservation procedure, and there is no communication group for feedback of activity photos. You have to go to the site to sign up by yourself. Newcomers may not be able to find the place. It feels a bit messy. This is not as good as the Guoguang Howard Johnson where I stayed two days ago. I personally feel that the service space can be improved. Special praise Comment to the reservation department. When booking a room, I requested a high floor, quiet floor and good view (which was included in the full sea view I originally booked), but they directly rejected it. I remarked again that "we will try to arrange a suitable room if there is one", but they still rejected it and there was no telephone communication. I applied 4 times and they were rejected all the time. Finally, Ctrip's application channel was directly closed, which made me feel very uncomfortable. I called them and said they would try to arrange it if there was one, but they were reluctant to do so. In addition, although the arranged room faces the sea directly, it is very close to the building on the side, right next to the 90¬∞ corner on the side, and the rooms next to it can see it very clearly, so the privacy is not very good, and the view is not as good as the rooms on the side that are close to the sea. However, looking at the comments on Ctrip, many people who booked this room type were arranged in the middle of the building with a view of the sea. On the contrary, I made a note in advance and called them specifically to tell them, but they arranged it like this? I didn't feel very comfortable. The housekeeper who added me on WeChat was called "Second Area Housekeeper" and there was no specific name... But to be honest, it was my first time to bring my child to Sanya, and the overall feeling of Tianyu Hotel was still good. The children had a lot of fun. It is worth recommending. It's just that the service level and service awareness of some departments need to be improved!

Drinks and water are replenished in the room every day, and the aunt cleans very seriously. If you have any needs and tell the front desk, they will basically be met. The activities are very suitable for five-year-old babies. Anyone who participates is very happy. There are a lot of shade trees, and there are many shells on the beach to pick up, which satisfies my experience of coming to Sanya in all aspects during the off-season~ Now there is a baby in my belly, and I look forward to the second brush of the family of four in the futureüòÜ

Luckily, it didn't rain for a few days. The hotel service was very good. The housekeeper Rose contacted me in advance and replied on WeChat in a timely manner. I only remembered to ask for a bed guard when I arrived at the hotel, but there was no need to worry about it. There was no musty smell or bugs in the room. The air conditioning was very powerful, and the decoration was completely acceptable. The soft drinks and mineral water delivered every day were endless. The dishes in Caifeng Pavilion and the self-service hot pot tasted good. The shade of the trees on the swimming pool and beach was so fragrant. It was very convenient to bring the baby to play. The only drawback was that the privacy was not good. You could basically chat with the neighbors on the balcony, so you had to dress neatly. There was no door in the toilet, which was a bit embarrassing. The overall cost performance was very high, and the children had a lot of fun.

The colored mud that the children played with fell to the ground and had been on the ground for many days. It was obvious that the floor had not been treated. It would have been better to vacuum it on a simple day. The buffet was quite rich and neither good nor bad. Because I could not get to the upper floors, I was given some play coupons, and the children also experienced some projects. The indoor light and shadow park was open for free on rainy days, which was quite humane. The children played well in the water fortress of the hotel. I saw that it was not dirty. It was okay overall and was regularly maintained. What satisfied me most about the hotel was the washing machine and clothes drying rack. I took the children to play in the water, took a bath three times a day, and washed clothes non-stop. It was really perfect with these two. It directly solved the pain points and praised them. I still recommend staying at his hotel for parent-child travel. The main feature is that a child can have fun and live conveniently. The guest rooms are indeed old and need to be updated slowly. The cleaning should also be improved. Overall, I am satisfied.
The photographers I met on the Paipai Box were average. I felt like they were just trying to get the job done. Even if they gave me 5 photos, I quickly chose one. There was nothing to pick. It all depends on luck. Some people met pretty good photographers who took a lot of photos and were very enthusiastic. I just went for the experience.

msg:The butler Carson and the service staff Yashi are good.
However, the overall decoration of the hotel is very old, and the hotel itself is very old, so if you like modern and stylish decoration, you can choose this store. I think the biggest feature of this store is that it has a big feeling, and there is a tree above the swimming pool. But I think the design of his swimming pool is more suitable for children with more courage, and it is not suitable for those who are a little less courageous.
The hotel does not provide swimming rings, which is not understandable. You need to buy swimming rings yourself, and then they can give you free air, only provide Fu coins, mainly because I have stayed in another hotel before, and these are all provided by the hotel for free, so I feel that the gap is quite large, and there are quite a lot of paid items in the hotel. We didn't use any of the services provided by the hotel, whether it was airport pick-up or cat petting. I feel that the hotel should provide some practical experience projects.

The hotel's activities, amusement facilities, and the beach are enough for the children to consume. Moreover, the entire hotel is covered with large-leaf trees, so it is not afraid of sun exposure. Parents only need to look at the schedule and take their children there. The facilities in the room are very parent-child friendly, and the details are very well done. Not only do they care about the comfort of adults, but also the arrangements for children are very well done. Moreover, every waiter is very enthusiastic and greets with a smile. If there are any problems, a phone call will solve them immediately. In addition, you must make an appoin**ent for the hotel's paipai box. The photos are very beautiful and the snapshots are very good. Each one is very meaningful! I won't put the front face photo, but put a funny one. Finally, I would like to give special praise to the housekeeper of the second district, Miss Xiaomei, because I went there alone with my child. She was afraid that I would check out too hastily at 12 o'clock, so she called me and told me not to be so anxious. She delayed my check-out for two hours, and finally gave me a small toy when I checked out. It was so thoughtful. Thank you very much. In short, Tianyu Hotel, I will come again with my child next time, and I highly recommend it!

msg:It can be renamed Tianyu Kindergarten. It is really full of children~ There are so many activities that they can't finish playing. The children are very happy. Families with young children can take a shower with their eyes closed, but it is a bit laborious for parents.
The hygiene is also good. I saw that the cleaning staff even vacuumed the corners of the corridor.
I have to praise the service. Before I went there, I saw xhs said that the service was average and there was no housekeeper. I didn't have much hope. As a result, there was not only a housekeeper, but the housekeeper was also very good at handling problems. Even if there was something in the early morning, he helped me handle it in a timely manner. The housekeeper Carson was really great! Most of my good impression of Tianyu this time came from this capable housekeeper.
The room layout and decoration, oh, I won't say much, there are pictures on the Internet, District 1, a better express hotel style~~
The swimming pool water is not very clean, after all, it is full of children, those who understand will understand, but I have stayed in several parent-child hotels, all of them are about the same.
The activities are also very good, except for the fluorescent beach party at night, which is suitable for 6+, let alone young children. For an hour-long activity, the rules were explained for half an hour, and the young children lost their patience and left directly. 150 yuan is a bit of a rip-off. However, the assistant lady was very nice and found us again in the evening to give us a small gift for the event.
It is convenient to eat. After exiting the first area, the Baihua Valley snack street is opposite. We ate at Baihua Valley in the park, which was neither good nor bad. The VIP breakfast was rich. The lawn barbecue buffet was also OK, the grilled oysters and crayfish were delicious, and the kids liked the show.
You can choose this place if you bring your kids to Sanya. The kids like it very much. When you leave, the kids are very unhappy, but I am almost exhausted and vomiting blood here. If I didn‚Äôt have kids, I wouldn‚Äôt come here. It‚Äôs really too noisy.

The housekeeper Coco also thoughtfully applied for a late check-out for us so that the children could take a nap. I will still book Tianyu next time.

In the end, it was difficult to choose the film, so I just bought all the negatives. On the last day of the stay, due to the flight delay, our airport bus changed the time temporarily and there was no seat. Damei at the front desk also helped us delay the check-out. Abao at the concierge depar**ent was also very responsible in carrying the luggage.

My child can play in the swimming pool for three days. The swimming pool slide is super fun. A 6-year-old child can play. The child is crazy. The room is a fresh sea view room in District 2, on the 4th floor, half garden view and half sea view, so beautiful! And the best thing is that the room is on the west side. When I rest in the afternoon, I sit on the balcony without the sun and the wind to watch the scenery. It's so comfortable... Although the room in District 2 is a bit old, I like the holiday style. The room area is also large, with a cloakroom, washing machine, and drying rack. The washing machine is really too important. Wash twice a day. The housekeeper Rose has a very good service. Even though we have already used the airport pick-up, she still arranged a free airport drop-off. On the last day, I made an appoin**ent with the hotel to take a photo box and took a lot of family photos. It's quite good! 599 packed all the negatives and left a souvenir~ This vacation is really perfect!

The green grass of Tianyu is really YYDs! The children were swimming in the pool, and we lay down to play, and that was enough!

msg:Important reminder: Don't book a room in advance during the off-season! !
We booked a triple room on Ctrip in advance for 1600 per night, including 3 breakfasts, and booked for 2 consecutive nights. Later, a family member was added temporarily. Because the order could not be cancelled, I immediately called the hotel front desk to upgrade to a 4-person room. At that time, the price of the Ctrip 4-person room was 2000 including breakfast. The hotel said that it would add more than 500 according to the price of the day. I agreed at that time. Before departure, I found that the price of the 4-person full sea view family room was reduced to 1700, which was equivalent to adding more than 100 on the basis of my original order. I negotiated with the hotel front desk whether the price could be increased according to the price of the day of check-in. The hotel front desk insisted that I agreed to the 500 per night plan on the phone at that time, and it must be increased by 1000 for two days to check in, or they would take a step back and add 900 for two nights according to the hotel listing price on the day. At that time, I considered not upgrading at all. The hotel front desk replied that because I called in advance to upgrade the original room type, it was no longer reserved, so it was no longer available. At this time, I really had no choice but to call Ctrip to try.
I still have to praise Ctrip's service! Although I saw that other platforms, such as Douyin and TikTok, were selling packages, some of which were dozens or hundreds cheaper than Ctrip, but when I thought about the fact that I had booked too expensive on Ctrip many years ago, and Ctrip helped me handle the order on the day of travel, I resolutely chose to travel through Ctrip for all my trips. Sure enough, I used it this time. I didn‚Äôt remember the phone number of the lady who served me on Ctrip, but she really handled all the problems I encountered on Tianyu very seriously. I placed a new order from the platform and enjoyed the off-season discount price. Ctrip customer service helped me contact the hotel manager seriously and promptly to cancel the original order. Thank you for your correct choice. I will continue to choose Ctrip in the future, hahahaha!

As for the hotel, it is really suitable for small children and children, with great shade design and rich activities. The children are very happy to stay, but the afternoon tea given is not very delicious, and the breakfast is great.
Thank you for the toy Transformers car sent by yoyo when I checked out of the hotel!

msg:I was very nervous before staying at Tianyu because there were too many negative reviews, but I was prepared to make the kids happy. It turned out that Tianyu was not that bad.
I booked a full sea view room in Zone 2, and the front desk helped me upgrade to a full sea view family suite. The room is very large and has a 180-degree sea view. It is equipped with a washing machine and a drying rack, so you can wash and dry your clothes after playing in the water. Most of the public activity areas, water play areas, rest and waiting areas of the hotel are shaded by trees, which seems to be unique in Yalong Bay. After all, when the kids are playing in the water, we can't bask in the sun.
The service can only be said to be average. The housekeeper basically won't take the initiative to greet us. Maybe there are too many people.
There was also a super large cockroach-like bug that flew into the room at night. From then on, I dared not open the balcony door again. I lived on the seventh floor. If you are a friend who is afraid of insects on the lower floors, you really have to consider it carefully. There are really a lot of insects.

msg:First, when I arrived at the hotel, the lobby was a mess, full of noise from adults and children. There was no staff to greet me. I had to find staff everywhere to ask questions, and they would send me away after two or three sentences, regardless of whether I understood or not, and would just turn around and leave.
Second, the hotel staff called me the day before check-in and said that the housekeeper would add WeChat. I thought it was a good experience, at least the housekeepers of the hotels I stayed in before left me with a very good impression. However, the housekeeper of this hotel was like this. When you asked questions, she would not answer them. Anyway, she would go around in circles with you and did not know how to coordinate. Anyway, your problems could not be solved in the end. She also did not know how to give guests some good suggestions. For example, the hotel is relatively large, and I just came here and did not know the route. You asked her where a certain activity was and how to get there, and she just mechanically sent you the hotel's promotional pictures over and over again. When you were with your children, it really made you inexplicably angry.
Third, when I booked the hotel room, I noted the room type, and I also called the hotel again to tell the request, and the hotel agreed. On the day of check-in, we kept contacting in the morning, hoping that we could check in as early as possible in the afternoon. The housekeeper said it was about three o'clock, so we arrived at the hotel at two o'clock, ready to take pictures of the box, and estimated that we could check in just after taking pictures. Then it rained, and we couldn't take pictures. Then we asked the housekeeper countless times when we could check in, and kept urging and delaying until 4:30 before we were told that we could check in. During this period, we witnessed many guests checking in before us. We brought our children, and the children couldn't sit all the time. We just walked, got wet in the rain, and spent money, but we still hadn't checked in. The experience was terrible. Fourth, after we entered the room at 5:30, the sheets were not changed with new ones. I don't know, anyway, we found several stains. The room with balcony view noted was completely missing. I don't know if it was arranged intentionally. I called the front desk and asked, and the front desk was very tough, saying that our room had no view. I asked if the balcony of our room type could only see the roof and there was no other choice. The front desk said yes. What's worse, the room we were given was the one closest to the elevator. Next to the room was the staff passage and the restaurant. Before we woke up in the morning, we could hear all kinds of noisy sounds, including the sound of the cafeteria food cart banging against the door.

msg:Tianyu Hotel has very good service. The housekeeper Damei is warm and thoughtful. Our flight from Hainan was delayed and the time was changed three times. Damei helped to extend the check-out time and coordinated the airport drop-off. She was meticulous and thoughtful. The concierge, Abao, was very enthusiastic and helped to pack the luggage. The sugar painting lady in the lobby was also enthusiastic. When we were busy coordinating flights with the airline, she performed skills for the children. Her exquisite skills attracted the two children, which made us less worried when we were anxious about the flight change. In short, Tianyu Hotel has good service, and enthusiastic staff with smiles can be seen everywhere.

msg:Facilities: Overall facilities, I think Tianyu is more suitable for parent-child travel. The only disadvantage of the swimming pool is that there is only one indoor heated swimming pool and the swimming pool is small. It gets crowded when there are many people. Other swimming pools are not constant temperature and are not suitable for babies. In addition, the hotel swimming pool has time limits. It cannot be used after that point. This is also quite unpleasant. The room facilities are quite complete. The children's suit is also quite OK.
Hygiene: Hygiene can only be said about the old room type, and it cannot be 100% covered. Some areas are still dirty, which may also be related to the fact that it is at the beach. There is more sand.
Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is very suitable for parent-child travel, and the a**osphere for children is very nice. There are also more activities. Our kids are lazy and participate less. Districts 1 and 2 are more convenient. There is Baihuagu Commercial Street opposite District 1. Eat more. However, I suggest you be careful when choosing a meal, as some of the dishes are not worth it.
Service: The overall service is quite good, but I can't understand the check-in aspect. We arrived at the hotel around 14:00. Although the normal check-in time is 15:00, we didn't receive our room card until after 16:00. It takes a full 2 ‚Äã‚Äãhours to clean a room, no prompting or explanation. Later, I asked the guest house aunt that it only takes about 20 minutes to clean a room normally. Even if the supervisor checks it, it won't take that long. And generally, most hotel check-outs should be around 12 o'clock. The delay will be about an hour at most. I don't think so at this point.
       In addition, there are game coins sent by Ctrip, and you will be asked to apply for a card during the application process. The cost of production is 10 yuan. Basically, this cost of production will give you 10 more coins for you to spend in the end. Because there will be situations where there is no cash to refund you. Personally, I feel this is a bit of a trap. üòÇ
        During the overall play process. The beach is relatively close. The temperature is more suitable than Haitang Bay because the wind is lighter. There are shade trees on the beach. But the sand is rough and can hurt your feet. The small animal feeding in the hotel is quite interesting, and the children like it very much. Ctrip‚Äôs gifts include mermaid experience, sea climbing and other things, but I didn‚Äôt use them because my baby was too young. The hotel's overall family activities are relatively rich. It is quite suitable for family travel. In addition, the service provided by Xiaolin, the housekeeper in the second area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, and Coco, the housekeeper I met during check-out, were very good.

msg:Before arrival: This is the first time I brought my baby to Sanya. Many people recommended Tianyu as the first choice for family hotels. The whole family booked a suite with a full sea view. The hotel has a bus at the airport to pick up and drop off. After arriving, you can find the bus parking lot by yourself. The bus leaves at about four o'clock on the hour. It takes ten minutes to get to the hotel. March is still the peak season in Yalong Bay. Two or three o'clock in the afternoon is the peak time for check-in. However, the lobby also provides drinking water and rest sofas for guests waiting for check-in. When checking in, the front desk actively inquires about the rooms. According to the request, I specially chose a high floor because the room was not ready yet, so I went to enjoy afternoon tea first;
Before check-in: If you choose a room with a full sea view, you will be a VIP. You can dine in a dedicated restaurant on the second floor. In addition to afternoon tea and coffee, there is also a welcome fruit plate and a set of L'Occitane toiletries; after waiting for more than an hour, the front desk called to inform you about the room. It‚Äôs ok, finally checked in;
Accommodation: I read some reviews online that the room was old and musty, so I might have expected it in advance. But when I went there, I found that the room was better than expected. There was no musty smell, and the air conditioner was powerful. The most important thing was that it had a washing machine, microwave, refrigerator, and heating. Towel racks and other equipment are very suitable for families with children. The viewing balcony is large and has a good view of the sea and garden. There are also specialty stores for children's toiletries, etc., and there is also baby laundry soap, which is super easy to use and can be used on children's clothes. The juice and rice stains come off as soon as you wash them off, which is much easier to use than the various baby laundry soaps used at home. The shortcoming of the room is that the water in the master bedroom bathroom is slow. We checked the reason online and said that I came back from the beach to take a bath, so I had to take a shower with it. It is caused by sand entering the sewer, so when we come back from the beach, we rinse the sand thoroughly~
Food: The Ctrip package included a dinner with coconut garden. We tried it on the first night. All the four children and one child were very satisfied with the meal. My son especially liked the car-shaped children‚Äôs tableware. The taste and price were right, so we even We ate at Coconut Garden for three nights; in addition, the room also included a nine-inch pizza and canned drinks, which tasted good; we had breakfast at the VIP restaurant, with many Chinese and Western varieties, especially the braised chicken feet, which was delicious. My elderly family usually Even those who don‚Äôt eat chicken feet ate a lot; basically, the food experience in the hotel was satisfactory~
Play: Before we checked in, our housekeeper Rose sent us a schedule of parent-child activities. If you want to participate, you can go by yourself. The children are still young and these activities are suitable for kindergarten babies, so I didn‚Äôt participate. However, our daily schedule was full because the room package included cute little trains. There are various activities such as petting, feeding and climbing frames. I go there to play every day and dig sand at the beach, so I am basically very busy. There is also an outdoor swimming pool, which is very suitable for young children. There are many shade trees and will not cause tanning. The constant temperature swimming pool Not recommended, the head is relatively low and a bit depressing, and the smell of chlorine is very strong; there are lounge chairs provided by the hotel on the beach, which are basically under the shade of trees; the sand near the second area is relatively fine, because there are many people, and the beach is also open. There is some garbage in the sand, which is especially obvious when walking to the public beach. There are also cigarette butts in the sand. Although there are hotel staff to clean up the garbage, environmental sanitation cannot be solely the responsibility of the hotel. The maintenance of the natural environment depends on everyone~
Summary: Four adults and one child stayed here for three nights, and both the elderly and children were satisfied. As for the comments on the Internet about being too noisy, this person with children understands that places with many children will not be quiet. People who choose this place should be tolerant of children. It's a bit more expensive; the staff are also very warm and friendly. We ate at the Coconut Garden Restaurant. We didn't order the children's meal for one meal. My child asked for a car-shaped dinner plate, and the waiter even brought us a dinner plate with the color we liked; butler Rose's service is proactive and enthusiastic. Our reservation originally only included one airport shuttle bus, but we used it for airport pick-up. The day before check-out, housekeeper Rose applied for a free airport shuttle for us~
All in all, this trip was very good. I will come again when my baby is older~

There are too many projects that come with it. The baby likes the small train and feeding small animals. The small animals are also very gentle and cooperative. It's so happy.

Facilities: The hotel has complete facilities. We stayed in a newly renovated room. The toiletries are complete. The children's toiletries are all available. The washing machine, dryer, and small refrigerator are all available.
Hygiene: The room is clean and there is no damp smell or other problems. The cleaning is very clean.
Environment: The environment is large and beautiful. Both areas are very convenient. It takes only 2 minutes to get to the beach. The beach is a good place for taking photos. It's beautiful no matter how you take it. The sand and sea breeze are very gentle. The hotel has a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãgreen plants so that it won't be too sunny. It's really happy and comfortable to take my baby to Tianyu for the first time. The seafood buffet at the beach also has a performance to entertain. It's very exciting and enjoyable to eat.
Service: The service is very considerate. Thanks to the considerate butler yoyo. With yoyo's service, this trip has a perfect end. The experience is not too good. If you don't understand or need anything, you can give it to yoyo. Like itüëç

For example, the woman who issues numbers for the train has no sense of responsibility. One moment she says there's no queue and the next moment there's another. An old lady came to cut in line, but she didn't organize it objectively. She just said, "You two negotiate." It feels like the hotel doesn't pay her. We come out to have fun, so we don't want to argue with her!

msg:First of all, I started with booking. I searched a lot of guides and found mixed reviews. I came here with a nervous mood and really felt that it was not bad! I didn't have to wait for a long time to check in. It was our turn in about five minutes (there were a lot of people checking in at that time). The lady at the front desk was very gentle. When you check in, you can get a children's yellow duck backpack and a map, because the hotel park is really big and the map is very useful! After adding the housekeeper WeChat, I told Wendy the housekeeper through WeChat when I needed it, and she would help me solve the problem one by one. It was very good and considerate. There are so many projects in the hotel that I can't finish playing. I booked a room for two days and originally planned to go to Haikou to play after checking out. Because the children liked it too much and didn't have enough fun, I stayed for another night, but because it was booked more temporarily, the original room type was sold out, so I could only book other rooms and change rooms. (It is not a big deal to change rooms. The concierge will help you take your luggage.) On the second day of my stay, I booked the free 5-photo box provided by the hotel room. I originally planned to keep only 5 free photos, but the photos were so beautiful that I couldn't choose. So I kept all of them. I am still not satisfied. Next time I come to Sanya, Tianyu will be my first choice!

There are complimentary items for parent-child rooms and free items in the hotel. It‚Äôs enough for walking the baby, and the baby can stay for a week without leaving the hotel. There are also many self-funded activities that are very fun. We don‚Äôt have much time, so we had a bubble party. The baby was very happy. There is also a free princess party where you don‚Äôt have to buy costumes to wear yourself. It‚Äôs okay, but 20 pictures are simply not enough to post. The only thing I'm not satisfied with is the breakfast. It's far from the breakfast at our Hotel Orlenberg in Quancheng. Anyway, it's just okay.

Huayuhai is the most recommended for breakfast. The place is large and the variety is also rich. If you like Cantonese-style morning tea, you can go to the Coconut Garden Restaurant, which is also good. Someone comes to clean the hotel every day.

msg:There was a small incident before check-in, and I was a little dissatisfied with the housekeeper. Fortunately, the housekeeper immediately changed the situation and solved the problem. The subsequent communication was also very positive and pleasant. We arrived at 4 pm and were immediately arranged to check in. We had a lot of luggage and someone helped push it up.
We were quite satisfied with our stay. We stayed for 2 nights in total. The hotel in District 2 has a total of 8 floors. I was given a full sea view room in the middle of the 7th floor. The view was very good. As soon as I entered, the bed rails on both sides had been put together. I called the front desk to help put the two beds together, 2 meters apart. 4 is really big, very suitable for couples with babies. Let‚Äôs talk about the room decoration. I rarely stay in hotels. I occasionally stay in five-star hotels. I think the decoration is okay. There is nothing shabby or broken to the naked eye. The overall Southeast Asian style. My husband thinks it looks old at first glance. . Except for the dust under the bed that has not been swept away, everything is clean. There is a bathtub, a washing machine, and a drying rack (I didn't notice this when I first ordered it, thinking it was a dryer, so it was perfect. This package is very suitable). The balcony is also quite large and has 2 retractable clothes drying racks. The shower gel for adults and children is not a big brand, but I brought it myself, so it doesn't matter. Anyway, the room is very big. The only thing that affects the experience is the design of the two sinks. Once the water is put in for brushing teeth and washing face, a lot of water will flow out. Because the pool is shallow and there is no blockage, the water will flow to the low glass countertop in the middle.
Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs amusement facilities. When we first checked in, we were confused. We didn‚Äôt know where to play because the hotel was so big. After asking the housekeeper, we chose to take the baby to the Wonderland amusement park downstairs first. Our baby is 2 and a half years old. The slides, ocean balls, trampolines, and climbing frames in the playground are very suitable for him. He has a great time playing. There is shade of trees outside the playground, and the air is better than the indoor playground in the shopping mall that is completely illuminated by lights. a lot of. The baby was still too young, so we took the small train that came with the package one after another, went to the outdoor and indoor swimming pools to play in the water, played in the sand, and also played in the small building block playground near the VIP on the second floor. More was not too much. Play. Baby's favorite things are the wonderland, the building block playground, playing with sand, and shooting water guns.
Let‚Äôs talk about the pat box given by the hotel. We didn‚Äôt make an appoin**ent at first, but we got a last-minute phone call in the afternoon and said there was a schedule, so we went. The photographer‚Äôs routine is very suitable for children, and the children had a great time following the photographer. When the film was released, I originally planned to only ask for free photos, but I simply asked for all the negatives and 5 pre-set template photos, which cost 799. However, his Jian Xiu did not shave his face. My baby‚Äôs face was bitten red by bugs, but it can still be seen in the Jian Xiu‚Äôs picture. Finally, the hotel does have a lot of shade on the beach leading to the pool, which is good.
All in all, it was a pleasure to stay in the hotel, because the schedule was too busy, there was no vacation, I didn't play a lot, and I didn't participate in the activities. I can give it a second try, and I will recommend it to others.

msg:Environment: I took my family to travel around the island during the off-season. I only stayed at Tianyu for one night, but the children had a lot of fun. The various facilities and projects were very popular with the children. They stayed in the water during the day and were reluctant to return to the room for the parent-child project of digging sand at night.

Facilities: Because there were many people on the day of check-in, the check-in time was delayed. The hotel upgraded our superior sea view room in the second area to a full sea view room. Although the view on the second floor is not the best, it is also a 180¬∞ sea viewüòÇ

Service: Helped us upgrade the room type and delayed check-out. The service was very satisfactory. Special thanks to the housekeeper Coco for giving toys and souvenirs to the children when we left the hotel. A very satisfying trip.

msg:This is the third time we have taken our grandson to Tianyu. After our grandson came back from Canada, we couldn't wait to take them to Tianyu Hotel again three days later. We stayed for three days and three nights this time, and we were very satisfied as always. Jenny at the front desk learned that we were old guests here, and she was very warm and caring, and she was very satisfied with the room she arranged for us. I noticed that last time I left a message to remind them that the door magnet was very sharp and could easily hurt the children. This time I found that all the door magnets were replaced without any danger. What particularly satisfied us was the washing machine. This small washing machine was a big help. It was very useful as long as you stayed for more than two days. The hotel is very friendly to guests. We brought two children, and the water provided in the room was not enough to drink. We called the front desk and sent many bottles. I was very touched. They try their best to meet any requirements of customers. Every day here is very fulfilling. Especially the location is very good. The Baihua Valley Commercial Food Street opposite is very convenient. Many things are cheaper than the small shops in the hotel. You won't step on pits when you come to Tianyu to play with your children.

I thought I couldn't check in, but I didn't expect that there was a room available and I checked in early in the morning. There was a small yellow bag with a sign for check-in. My children loved it, and they kept coming back. Carrying.
The rooms in the first area are not too big, but they have everything you need, especially the washing machine and dryer, which is better than many hotels.
There are many varieties of breakfast restaurants in Districts 1 and 2, so you can basically find what you want.
Pat boxes are also great to leave as a souvenir for your children.
The hotel has its own infirmary. Children will inevitably have a bump or something, so it is very convenient to go and deal with it.
There are so many parent-child activities in the hotel that the children won't want to take a nap, and there are also many entertainment facilities such as climbing frames. Especially the water rides are more fun than many places.
Finally, I would like to mention that this trip was a big mistake. On the way back, I took the hotel bus to the airport and accidentally picked up the wrong trolley case with another hotel (not that I was careless, but I encountered a trolley case that looked exactly the same. By the way, I would like to remind everyone of your luggage. It‚Äôs best to customize the box so as not to cause trouble to the police.) After discovering it, I contacted the hotel immediately. The hotel staff helped call the bus guests one by one, adjusted the surveillance, and provided a lot of help. Finally, with the help of the police uncle from the airport police station, I finally found him.
Thanks to housekeeper Xiao Yao, housekeeper Nana, and every staff member of Tianyu Hotel.

My daughter and I shared one room, and my parents shared another. There were two bathrooms, so we didn't disturb each other. The room was cleaned every day. I could always find the housekeeper Rose if I needed anything. She was always responsive. I also received 5 travel photos as a gift. The photos were taken well in the photo box, and they were all taken according to my requirements. The customer service number 10 was very good, and the suggestions he gave when selecting photos were very pertinent. The hotel was also very generous. I could watch the show even if I didn't eat the hotel's self-service hot pot. I watched it with my baby for two consecutive days, and it was very good. There were also many activities for children, and I couldn't play them all.

This room is a U-shaped corner. The room is weird, and the decoration style is like a county guesthouse. Only the toilet can be smart. I booked for two days, but I didn't want to stay any longer. The housekeeper disagreed and said that I could leave early unless I showed the air ticket or medical record of the island. I was very shocked. I have stayed in many hotels, but this is the first time I heard that I can't decide the time of departure by myself, and I have to provide medical records (not even a diagnosis). Overbearing, right? After explaining it to the housekeeper, I agreed to change the room to the fifth floor, and then I knew that the air conditioner in the room can be so quiet. But it's not all bad. The landscaping is very good, and the playground is very good for children. The weird room on the second floor is No. 1251. Don't go. The air conditioner roars like a tractor, and there is a pungent smell.

The staff were quite enthusiastic. We lived in Phase 1, which was said to have been renovated, so the facilities were still good. The washing machine and electric towel rack were very convenient, so there was no need to worry about the problem of washing clothes. The drinks and drinking water in the refrigerator were also free. There were many parent-child activities and good facilities, such as bucket fun, feeding small animals, swimming, beach, small train, lawn... Children will definitely like it here. I also took a bus to the duty-free shop. The Haitang Bay Duty-Free Shop is super big and good to visit.

msg:I compared many hotels, but I still think that the longevity of old hotels is definitely justified. I chose a full sea view room in District 2, with an unbeatable view. Although the room is a little bit old, it still feels high-end and attentive. The only regret of the room is that the TV cannot be projected. The rest is perfect. The staff are also very enthusiastic and polite. They will take the initiative to say hello when they meet on the road. There are too many parent-child activities and I can't participate at all. One night, I participated in an activity a little late. There were only three children. The staff still hosted the activity for an hour enthusiastically. It was very convenient to eat. The whole family, including the children, were very satisfied.
Special thanks to Rose, the housekeeper of District 2 after check-in, who replied to messages and solved the problem quickly. And the yellow-dressed Coco sister who handled the check-out was enthusiastic and made people very happy.

Last year I said I would definitely come back again, especially my kids, and I mentioned that I would come back to Sanya this year and booked another three nights. There really is no harm if there is no comparison, especially during this trip to Hainan, I went to several places and stayed in several five-star hotels. Tianyu is the best in terms of parent-child experience and comfort. Tianyu is really great. It understands parent-child matters and makes both children and adults happy. The breakfast is also the richest and can be eaten in several restaurants. The various children's activities in the swimming pool and children's water village are also the most abundant and fun. In short, our family likes it very much. I feel like I can forget all my worries when I soak in the circulating swimming pool. I don't want to come out even if I stay in the circulating swimming pool for a whole day. Haha, the water in the swimming pool is very clean and clear. The hotel's access to the beach is also very convenient. There are frangipani trees around the swimming pool, which is a good way to avoid sunburn. The hotel staff are also very enthusiastic and will not make you uncomfortable. They are just right.
This year I still made an appoin**ent with the hotel‚Äôs photo shooting box. I still produced great results and communicated with the photographer very happily. I took some scenes that I hadn‚Äôt taken last year and bought all the negatives because I really liked it. In short, Tianyu gave me another It left us with wonderful memories of our trip to Sanya!

I saw some reviews saying that the room in Tianyu is a bit damp, but I think it's okay, mainly because there is a washing machine and drying rack, which beats other hotels.
Although the room is average, the play is really amazing. The children didn't want to leave in Tianyu and said they would come again next time. I think just for the washing machine and children's activities, I will also visit it again!

Opposite the hotel is Baihuagu Commercial Street, which is very convenient for eating, but a bit expensive.

msg:I have stayed at Tianyu several times with my children, and I chose here again this year. I really like the various facilities and activities prepared for children here. The children have a great time playing here. The deluxe mountain view room in Zone 2 that I stayed in this time also had a view of the sea. The room was very comfortable. It had a washing machine, a hand washing stool, special toiletries for children, and free drinks every day. Various supplies are supplied in a timely manner. Rose, the housekeeper, called and added WeChat a day in advance. She asked questions every day during the stay and even helped to delay check-out. Mi Li, the waiter, even folded an elephant out of a towel for the children and chatted with them in a friendly manner. I will choose to bring my children here next time. But there is one thing that is different from the previous stay, which makes people feel uncomfortable. This time, I feel that the hotel may want guests to enjoy the hotel resources better, so whether they go to the beach or leave the hotel to eat on the commercial street opposite, they will always ask for check-in information when they return to the hotel.

She was able to solve any problems very quickly and answered the questions very quickly. The baby fell asleep during the afternoon nap. They also gave us a late check-out and provided us with a very convenient and fast service. The baby had a lot of fun during his stay. There were many activities and he also liked taking the train. They arranged a highest floor for us. What a great experience this time. It‚Äôs really very good! ! !

msg:Comrades and relatives, please listen to my advice and never listen to online reviews. I can only advise one person, but I really don‚Äôt want anyone to fall into this trap again.
Tianyu Resort Hotel, a thousand-yuan hotel! The facilities in the room are old, and the tiles and wooden floors are spliced ‚Äã‚Äãtogether. The wooden floors look old at first glance! Besides, the disposable items provided in the room give you the feeling that Tianyu is always thinking about how to save costs rather than giving you a better living experience. Minibar soft drinks? ? ? The cheapest drinks were delivered, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, Jiaduobao, and Coconut Milk. Just refill this spicy chicken drink once every 4 days. Compare it to Atlantis. The waiter came into the room to refill my drinks. I asked how many I could get, and he answered me "all are OK"; the drinks at Atlantis include VOSS sparkling water, RIO cocktails...
Tianyu claims to be a family-focused hotel, and there is actually an arcade in the hotel. Tianyu understands the hearts of children, and of course the most important thing he cares about is the parents' wallets.
A day's worth of activities from morning to night? Sorry, activities marked with an asterisk ‚Äª are chargeable.
The location of the event is also very particular. Some events are held in restaurants. Do you want to participate in the event? Go to the restaurant to participate. Are you embarrassed not to eat at the restaurant? 298 per person for meals.
How old are the hotel slippers? It's not clean after washing. Fortunately, I brought my own slippers, otherwise I wouldn't dare wear them.
The drinking cup looks like it has been in service for more than ten years.
There were two karaoke machines in the hall, but he left them unplugged and reported a machine malfunction. If the machine breaks down, replace it.

msg:Traveling with children, a family of four chose the Tianyu Family Hotel online. After reading mixed reviews, I was a bit worried about the experience. Check-in was quite slow. We arrived at the hotel at 2 o'clock and didn't check in until 5 o'clock. The room facilities are aging and the balcony door locks can be changed. The hygiene is okay. It feels weird that there is no bag on the toilet. It is worth recommending that there is a washing machine in the room, which is very practical. There are many activities for the little friends, as well as swimming and hot springs. We stayed in the full sea view room in the second area, and the complimentary afternoon tea and breakfast were okay. There are many varieties. You can go upstairs and downstairs and have a buffet barbecue dinner on the lobby lawn. It is quite good. My husband said that the food is not bad and the price is a little expensive. It starts at 500. This is also the price with the coupon. I walked around the first and second areas to eat. Relatively speaking, the children's swimming area in District 2 is recommended in all aspects. The most recommended thing is that the housekeeper Yuanyuan in District 2 helped us solve many problems during our stay and the smart robot sent us to the room. The children watched it for the first time. I was very excited and checked out quickly. It is recommended for family travel. If you are traveling as a couple, check out the hotel next door. Tianyu is full of children and is very suitable for family travel.

msg:To be honest, I received too many bad reviews when I booked the hotel before checking in. When I checked in, I felt that the room was indeed very old, but it did not hinder the fact that it was a family hotel with a ceiling. We booked a full sea view and a good view. The park is large and has a strong family a**osphere. It is relatively friendly to children. My son is almost two and a half years old. He himself prefers this place. For me, who has been in hotel sales for 12 years, the hotel is indeed not a five-star standard. The occupancy rate is too high for new hotels. I didn‚Äôt go there this time in Haitang Bay. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs pat box. In fact, to put it bluntly, the basic package is 5**. You can‚Äôt take pictures in vain after taking more than an hour. After all, the weather is quite hot. Children and adults can enjoy it. It's been a long time, this business has been too hot, to use their salesman's words. I can't take pictures. I can't take pictures at all. I might choose Tianyu again next time, but I need to book for a few more days. I really can't change hotels frequently when I have children. It's too tiring.

msg:The hotel is right on the edge of Yalong Bay, with first-line sea views and beaches. Next to the hotel is Baihuagu Commercial Street. The hotel hardware is generally good, but the toilet seat in the public area is not cushioned, which is a bit uncomfortable for me who is used to cushioned covers. The corridor to the room is a bit long. You have to walk about 100 meters from the elevator to the room, and the corridor is not very wide. There are 4 restaurants for breakfast. The food is similar and the variety is quite satisfactory, but the restaurant environment is a little different. The main Chinese restaurant is Coconut Garden on the first floor, which offers Hunan, Cantonese and Hainan cuisine. There are many parent-child projects, including light and shadow park, small train, seaside climbing, Qiyu Kingdom, open-air swimming pool, etc. The most important ones are the sea and beach, where you can spend half a day playing. The service is very good. You can add the butler's WeChat account when you check in. If you have any needs, you can contact the butler directly. Especially the butler Dan, the service is very considerate and responsive. Overall, the hotel is very good in terms of hardware and software, and among the row of hotels near the sea in Yalong Bay, the price/performance ratio is considered to be the highest.

There is also one-to-one butler service. The butler Nana and the guest room butler Gao Guangxiang have particularly good service. They are humane, patient, solve problems in a timely manner, and have strong communication skills.
 
The room is cleaned every day. The facilities are a bit old, but they are very functional. This time I took the elderly and children on vacation and booked a one-bedroom apar**ent, which was very convenient. The park environment is excellent and the breakfast is average. The surrounding commercial areas are very close, such as Baihua Valley, Yalong Bay Plaza, and Yalong Bay Night Market, which are convenient for shopping and dining.

Generally speaking, it is suitable for bringing children together.

msg:Choosing Tianyu also wanted to experience the experience of staying in a family hotel.
Let‚Äôs talk about the room first. We chose a fresh sea view room in Zone 1. When we checked in, we could only see a little sea view when we walked to the corner of the balcony. It didn‚Äôt feel like it was worth it. The inside of the room was okay, with a heated towel rack. The washing machine and other facilities are fully equipped and have been renovated and are not very old.
In terms of activities, there are a lot of small activities in the hotel, but most of them are for children. In addition, the activities are divided into paid and free, and the format is relatively simple. The claws of the dolls in the arcade are so loose that it is almost impossible to catch them. Our package included a cat petting coupon, which is a favorite among children.
The hotel is large, the scenery is okay, there are many outdoor children's facilities, there is a heated swimming pool, and there is also a cute pet paradise, but the smell is quite strong, there are feces and eggs on the lawn, I feel that the hygiene of the park can be improved.
Nana, the butler customer service, answered all questions and was very enthusiastic.
The family hotel is suitable for staying with a baby for several days, where you can have fun easily. At more than 2,000 per night, the price/performance ratio is very low for those who like to go out of the hotel to see attractions.
There is a commercial street just outside the hotel, and there is Baihua Night Market in the evening. It is very convenient to hang out and eat.

msg:I have heard about the name of Tianyu Resort for a long time, but I also heard from some friends that the equipment seemed a bit old, so I tried it with the intention of giving it a try, and I was more than satisfied with it!

When I came to Sanya from the north, I was very happy to see green trees and red flowers. When I checked into the room, I was actually facing the sea and the flowers were blooming. The view of the sea outside the balcony was so shocking! Breathing in the sea breeze, drinking coconut milk, and eating ice cream, your happiness will really rise.

Although the room facilities look a little old, they are of good quality and fully equipped. There is even a microwave and induction cooker. Although they may not be used, they always provide a possibility. In addition to washing powder, the washing machine also comes with effervescent tablets for cleaning and disinfecting the washing machine. It is very careful and more practical for families with children.

The outdoor environment is great, with stretches of green lawn along the coastline, clear water and fine sand. The workmanship and expression of the small animals in the landscape lights are very online, which makes people see the hotel‚Äôs intentions. There are so many various entertainment and leisure facilities, it‚Äôs like a children‚Äôs paradise with a hotel attached üòâ There are many items that I didn‚Äôt get to experience this time, so I‚Äôll save them for next time. The little animals in the cute pet paradise will wander around the lawn of the park, and they are not afraid of people at all, and they look very loving.

For breakfast, you can choose from three restaurants in Districts 1 and 2. The overall variety is relatively rich.

After checking in, I added the work WeChat account of Xiao Chen, the housekeeper of the second district. The replies were very timely, considerate and friendly. When I was about to check out, my child fell asleep because he got up too early, and he even helped apply for a delayed check out time. Although I have not met him in person, I can still feel the full friendship like a friend. Thank you for his reception and care‚òïÔ∏è

Before we leave, the children have made it clear that they will come again next timeüòä Then, see you next time!

Chicken fat could be seen in the salad left in the morning and in the grilled chicken. Second, good projects are all chargeable, including bubble parties and nightclub activities, which cost 150 each time. Third, the airport transfer is by bus, and there are many people. Fourth, the breakfast and lunch environment was not good, and the waiters did not clean in time. When we went there, there were not many people, all the seats were empty, many tables were not cleared, and we could not find a clean place to sit down. The child spilled water and no one came to clean it up even though we called the waiter. There was a puddle of water on the ground and no one came to clean it up after we left. Let's talk about the good stuff, the room service is good, and there is a washing machine in the room which is very convenient. It is cleaned every day and there is free water and drinks every day. There are abundant green plants and the soft beach is suitable for children to play in the sand. Sanya's overall consumer services are now declining again, and the quality of service personnel needs to be improved.

The room is clean and quiet. There is a tent that children like. I asked the front desk for a playpen and a crib. The playpen was clean and sturdy. The crib also comes with a children's pillow and a small quilt.
There is a balcony with two rows of clothes drying racks on the wall. There are many clothes racks in the cloakroom. There is also a washing machine and an electric towel rack, which meets the drying needs of children who play in the sand and swim while changing clothes.
The service is also very good. They will come to clean and replenish disposable supplies the next morning. When I meet the waiters on the way, they will greet me warmly (because I am busy taking care of the children, in fact, there is basically no need for service. The rooms where needed are already prepared. alright)
There are so many things to play that I can‚Äôt play them all in two days. I can only pick the ones that the children are interested in and play first.
Because there are not many people now, you can get on the airport shuttle bus directly, which is very convenient

On the last day, the children wanted to go to the Magical Cat Playhouse, but were told that they couldn't go in and had to buy tickets. Later, because they were in a hurry, they didn't go. This is a bad review.
In addition, the resident singer of Benmao Yoghurt has a very nice singing voice, and you can‚Äôt help but hum along after listening to it.

The facilities in the house I live in are relatively ordinary, but everything is available. The housekeeper Yangyang is also very considerate. If I have any questions, she responds promptly and even gives gifts to the children!
The box photos were taken very well. The photographer amused the children and took photos all by himself. I am very satisfied with the result!

Because we booked two areas for two days and one area for one day, the room change was very user-friendly. The concierges Xiaohui and Yuanyuan had good service attitude and helped to change rooms. They responded to every request. The child is two years and eight months old and has a lot of fun. There are many projects that he can participate in, but it is a bit overwhelming. I was also pleasantly surprised by the photo box. The photos taken were very natural and beautiful, even better than the photos I spent thousands of dollars to take at home. Be sure to make a reservation in advance

msg:Sanya's Tianyu is a resort hotel that is better at parent-child aspects. It is a place where people with children will not be tired. The hotel has done a good job in parent-child details. This time we stayed in the Deluxe Ocean View Room in Zone 2. The room was very large, and the hotel could help put the two beds into one extra large bed. The middle area was made very flat and comfortable, and it didn't feel comfortable. to the gap. Moreover, the hotel is well equipped for parent-child arrangements. I saw that even the bed surrounds are prepared, and there are many clothes hangers. The balcony has a telescopic and folding clothes drying rod/rack, which is very useful. Moreover, the balcony is not accessible on rainy days and is well designed. The bathroom has a complete range of accessories and consumables, and the Panasonic washing machine is very easy to use. Children love the bathtub very much. Minibar drinks are replenished daily.
There are many choices for breakfast~ The small animal area is the favorite place for children~~ As for the beach, it is not a private beach, so there are not many people, and you can hardly dig anything, so if you want to dig, you have to go to a private beach Or go to a place dedicated to catching the sea. Dandan, the hotel housekeeper, is very good. She responds to all requests and responds quickly. She can tell you anything you need and provide it in a timely manner. This kind of housekeeping care is very good. The only shortcoming is that it rained for several days, so I didn't go to Chengxi Island, which is a bit regretful. Because of rainy days, the hotel also opened the light and shadow park for free, and children loved playing there.
In addition, what can I say about the fisherman's hot pot in the hotel? If you only compare the food and price, it is not worth it. There are just many performances. This one is different. It looks good, although It rained, but a place was still opened for performances in the dining area, so the price is equivalent to dining + watching a show.
Overall, if you are traveling to Sanya with your children, Tianyu is definitely the right place to stay. Moreover, if you book a room directly with Tianyu official website and get a Tianyu membership upgrade, you will have to book with Dandan next time, hahaha.
I'll come back after a while when the weather is better~~

We were short of water. Please send us a message as soon as possible for bath towels. Basically, Within minutes, water and bath towels were delivered to the room.
The rooms in the first area are very close to the beach. There are several children's water play areas downstairs, as well as swings, climbing frames, zip lines, and a cute pet paradise.
The hotel has also prepared a lot of activities for children, the most distinctive ones are duck driving and loach catching. We stayed for 3 days, and the children were so busy that they couldn't bear to go home. When we checked out, the butler Xiao Chen provided very good service and gave the children 2 small whales.

Disadvantages: There are more people and children than the average hotel, so it is not suitable for vacation. I saw an old man holding bread with his hands in the restaurant and then putting it back. The mother with her baby let her baby pee in the green belt, even though there was a toilet in the lobby.
Service: Every waiter is very enthusiastic, especially the housekeeper Nana. From check-in to departure, the Qiancheng WeChat service is responsive to all requests, and helps with late check-out and appoin**ent for airport drop-off service.
Pat Box: The photographer is professional, familiar with the hotel area and knows where to take beautiful pictures and with good lighting.
Catering: We ate breakfast in all three restaurants. The Cantonese breakfast restaurant added 28 yuan per person. The Chinese and Western restaurants in Zone 2 were noisy. The restaurant in Zone 1 could see the sea from outside.
Finally, I like the little yellow duck bag given by the hotel. It is a souvenir of the trip and is very practical. It is really convenient to carry small items when staying in the hotel.

As an aside, remember to bring a thermometer and antipyretics. It‚Äôs half an hour‚Äôs drive from the Maternity and Child Health Hospital, and a taxi ride costs between 30 and 50 yuan.

msg:I took my kids to Sanya and made a guide on Xiaohongshu before going out. Xiaohongshu was full of advertisements for Tianyu. The biggest selling points were the shade trees and the many parent-child activities. So I booked for 3 days in a row, each night costing 1,300 yuan. On the first day, I didn't even book a full sea view room, only a deluxe sea view room. The underground parking lot was shabby, just like a hotel. As soon as we entered the room, the decoration was really old... There was even old dirt on the sink that couldn't be cleaned... I didn't even say anything about it. The housekeeper would ask and answer a question, but he would have to wait for a long time just for that question. The service staff was clueless and didn't even smile. The next day, I changed to a full sea view room, and the floor dropped directly to the 4th floor. The opposite side of the room was still being renovated. I asked if there was a higher floor. I was told that I had to wait until after 4 pm. I said that I could wait in the original room. Reply Said no, you can only store your luggage at the front desk. Should I take my baby outside to bask in the sun at noon...
In the end, I had to check in. I didn't get through the door yet. One of the key cards was broken. The air conditioner was also broken. I could only stay at 21 degrees silently. I couldn't turn it up or down. I came to fix it twice, but it couldn't be fixed. At night, The children upstairs started running wildly and making noises. I have decided to cancel on the third day and change to a hotel.
On the morning of the third day, I canceled my subscription from Ctrip. I would like to give a thumbs up to Ctrip‚Äôs customer service. If I had booked through the Tianyu Mini Program, it would probably have been useless... Finally, the hotel agreed. The manager called me and asked me why. To check out, I calmly told her the reasons such as the air conditioner was broken, the room was old, and there was noisy upstairs. She was told that we can check you out. Logically speaking, you cannot do so. I hope you can be respectful when you leave a review... Please , can you use your advertising energy to improve the rooms and services, or even express your determination to me? There is no apology, no improvement, just a word of praise... How much advertising money did you spend on Xiaohongshu? Shock.
Those highlights, such as the tree-shaded swimming pool, are shaded by trees. The swimming pool is huge, the slides are broken, and there are mosquitoes. The beach chairs next to it are the same as those at the roadside stalls. Can't they be upgraded? There are many parent-child activities, including charges for small trains, bubble battles, and fun things. Is there any difference between this parent-child hotel and ordinary shopping malls? ? ?
In order to be fair and impartial, I carefully searched for the advantages. It may be that it is relatively close to the seaside. The sea in Yalong Bay is still very beautiful. Apart from the messy breakfast restaurant, the durian cake tastes good. .
All in all, no matter how many people recommend Tianyu, I don‚Äôt recommend it very much. I hope that more advertising energy can be used to improve the hotel‚Äôs hardware and software facilities...

Shooting with a photo shop in a hotel: The photo box is good. It can especially arouse children's emotions, make them laugh, and capture happy moments. It is not expensive and has good value for money. Although I don't know the name of the photographer (it seems to be Gao Fei). , but the photographers in this store should be pretty good.

The beach is great, the entertainment facilities are complete, and the room facilities are comfortable and complete, equipped with a mini kitchen, washing machine, and dryer. The service staff are all very enthusiastic. From the baggage attendant A Bao at check-in to the housekeeper Yang Yang and Huang Mengzhu at the front desk, they all left a deep impression on me! In addition, you must definitely come here to visit the cat pavilion. There are 26 cute kittens in total. It is really soothing! ! The guys in the cat petting salon are also gentle and enthusiastic. I couldn't bear to leave and stayed for another day because I wanted to pet the cat. A great stay experience.

Some said that the rooms in Zone 2 are large and have old facilities, while the rooms in Zone 1 are small and have new facilities. I considered that there are rooms in Zone 2. The bathtub allows children to take a bath and play, so I booked the second area. After checking in, I found that the facilities were not as old as the reviews said. On the contrary, I really liked the decoration style. It was very clean. As a family hotel, there are many activities in the hotel. , the breakfast is also very rich. I will choose Tianyu again next time I come to Sanya
Hygiene: The entire hotel is very clean, the rooms are also very clean, and they are cleaned every day
Environment: The hotel is very close to the beach and the sea. It only takes five minutes to walk to the beach. The scenery is beautiful, and there are trees above the outdoor swimming pool for shade. My baby had a great time.
Service: The waiter will help with the luggage. When meeting the waiter in the hotel, he will take the initiative to say hello. The housekeeper Xiao Dan is also very nice. He gave the baby a small gift when checking out. The baby was very happy and made the whole stay experience great. The hotel The photo box provided was my biggest gain during this trip. I originally wanted to choose the five free photos given by the hotel, but the photographer was very professional and patient, and was able to capture the children's expressions and movements very well. I took a lot of family photos. The staff will give suggestions when choosing photos after taking them. They will not force you to choose photos. It is all voluntary. I feel that I am very satisfied with the photos and the service. It can be regarded as a reward for this time. Sanya is a family trip to keep as a souvenir, so I chose the package. The photos were carefully edited and typed. I highly recommend the photo box. It‚Äôs nice.

Therefore, even if they stayed in luxury hotels many times thereafter, their parents could not forget it. The experience of this stay is as good as ever, but the theme has changed to parent-child. In this regard, the hotel can be said to be full of details - children's toothbrushes, pajamas, tableware, clown activities, panda performances, small trains around the park, and many more So many activities! In addition, a small accident occurred during check-in, and Ms. He, the manager on duty, helped me solve it properly, which made me feel more gratified during this trip.

Tianyu Hotel is really nothing to say in terms of environment and room layout. The lady at the front desk arranged a room with a full sea view and a great view. It is indeed a family hotel. The room comes with children‚Äôs bathrobes, slippers, clothes drying rack and washing machine. I really like this! There are many activities for children to play, and we had a very comfortable stay with our children. During the stay, the housekeeper Yangyang actively and enthusiastically answered questions and replenished the minibar for free. The hotel breakfast is relatively lacking in variety, but it does not affect the stay experience. The fish hotpot dinner was average, but the stage performance entertained both children and adults. The room cleaning staff are enthusiastic and clean. Both the front desk lady and the arranged photographer were very enthusiastic about the Paipa Box travel photo provided as part of the Ctrip package. They happily interacted with the children and the results were very good! Overall, the kids had a lot of fun in the last two days, and staying at Tianyu was really comfortable and unforgettable! Very, very good hotel!

Room: I booked a parent-child room on the first floor of the second area. The room is large, has two bathrooms, and a small loft and slide for children. The children can play in the room for two hours every day. The only drawback is that the first layer has a slightly damp smell, but the kids like it and it‚Äôs worth it. The room was cleaned promptly and very clean;
Park environment: I have to say that the outdoor environment and facilities of Tianyu are very considerate. The swimming pool is basically under the shade of trees, and the fallen leaves are cleaned up in a timely manner. The large lawn is neatly trimmed and suitable for taking pictures.
Service: There are many service staff and a dedicated butler. The butler responded to my questions in a timely manner;
Others: The hotel provided family photos as a gift. Teacher Ayuan who took the photo box was very patient and the photos he took were very beautiful. After shooting at two o'clock, I chose the film at five o'clock. I also patiently explained the film selection and provided suggestions.
As a family hotel, Tianyu has a very good overall experience; in addition, there is a food street with quite a lot of choices for eating.

msg:I really recommend this hotel to everyone. Don‚Äôt come here if you can. No matter it is Yalong Bay or Haitang Bay in Sanya, any family hotel in Sanya will make you feel more comfortable than Tianyu. It should be an old brand, and it is the top of the parent-child list, but it is really flying.

Service: The hotel's service is very, very poor and the management is extremely chaotic.
I chose a deluxe sea view room for the two rooms I booked for two nights, but I was given a fresh deluxe sea view room in one of the rooms. I didn't realize it at first. I took my kids out to play every day and didn't really distinguish the rooms carefully. When our family prepared two rooms for one more night. The front desk told me that one room was for freshness and the other was for selection. Only to find out that the check-in staff booked the wrong room.

However, when the so-called manager contacted me, he did not apologize in his tone or tone. Instead, he first asked if he wanted to extend his stay. If he did, I would upgrade my room type. Please? It was you who booked the wrong room in the first place. You should not have solved the wrong problem first. You actually asked me to extend my stay and then upgrade my room type.

Finally, after I repeatedly emphasized the problem of getting the wrong room, the manager agreed to give breakfast to two adults (not that he was very generous. He first said that a children's program would be free, but I didn't ask for it. Then he said that he would give a small train, but I didn't. Yes, the whole communication process felt like haggling in a vegetable market. To be honest, why didn't I order breakfast? There were few types of breakfast and there were many people inside. A casual breakfast at Baihua Valley opposite would be quieter and better.) And The manager proposed to add a small discount on the renewal room fee. Then the manager said that the price difference for your room was 120 yuan, and the breakfast was 150 yuan per person, which is equivalent to paying you 300 yuan, so the discount on the renewal room fee was gone. Hahaha, in a five-star hotel, it feels really uncomfortable to be on a budget. I don‚Äôt want to say anything else. We are not people who are short of dozens of yuan. I thought about it after breakfast the next day and couldn‚Äôt help but pull it.

As a result, we went to have breakfast early the next morning, reported our room number, and said that no one had arranged breakfast for us. Then there was another theoretical argument before we could eat this breakfast. It means that the entire hotel's explanation from top to bottom is simply rubbish and does not align with the guest's information.

The overall feeling of this hotel is that it is not generous and very fussy. Even if they were wrong in the first place, they seemed to be rightly wrong.

In addition, I finally learned that it was not that I booked the wrong room on the day I checked in, but that the Selected Deluxe Ocean View King Room I had booked that day was simply not available. The two rooms were booked in the wrong place, one had a fresh sea view king bed, and the other had a fresh sea view king bed. I chose a sea view twin bed (when we went to ask for the twin bed to be replaced by a king bed, the front desk kept insisting on the words so that we could see clearly that the note in the photo was "As much as possible, arrange a king bed", and repeatedly said that there was no room that I could book that day. I chose a king bed room with sea view). So that room type was simply not available that day, and he was not allowed to refund the price difference and exchange for something else. He was only allowed to add money to exchange for a better one.

Hygiene: I checked into the wrong fresh room and encountered a gecko on the first day. The hygiene of the two rooms was acceptable.

Facilities: The facilities in the wrong fresh room are old. Although the sea view twin room is slightly newer, it is not as good as other five-star hotels. There is a washing machine in the room, which is more convenient.

Then there is the fact that although the hotel is a family hotel with free items, there are really many paid children's items that we spend money to play. Bubble party is 80 per person, one large and one small is 160, and the small train is 50 for one large and one small. In the evening The treasure hunt party is 150 per person, a small handful of cabbage to feed the animals is 15, and so on. The bubble party is really free in many hotels, so there is really no need to come to this hotel.

The next day we changed to other family hotels in Haitang Bay. No matter in terms of service or room type, it really felt like we were getting better every day.

In short, I will definitely not come back because of the hotel service concept of being very careful about every penny from top to bottom.

msg:I stayed at Tianyu again after two years. It is still the first-tier family hotel in Sanya. The hotel has a variety of activities and it is no problem to stay for a week in a row. It's a pity that we didn't catch up with the bubble party these two times. I didn't notice this activity last time. This time, because the hotel only held it the next day, I went to the swimming pool without checking the activity schedule on the first day of my stay and missed it. (It is recommended that the hotel check-in staff, for families with children, remind them of the activities when checking in), but fortunately, if the free activities are not completed, they can be exchanged for game currency. We would like to express our special thanks to Yubaobao‚Äôs Sister Xixi, Sister Little Bear, and Sister Fantuan. The child lost her own mobile phone while playing the game console, and the ladies found it and returned it to us. In addition, on the day of check-out, I was anxious and left the hard drive connected to the TV, so the hotel staff helped send it back to Beijing.

msg:When I brought my children and my mother to Sanya, it was raining and I had no choice but to stay in a hotel. I specially booked Tianyu for 2 nights. The advance guide said that the fresh rooms in the first area were newly renovated and were relatively better, so I booked a fresh twin room with the possibility of sharing beds. Maybe because of the rain, the quilts, sheets and pillows were relatively damp, making it uncomfortable to sleep on. However, there was a washing machine and drying rack, as well as a baby toilet, which was really a plus. The occupancy rate of the hotel is very high. Most of them are families with babies. There are really many parent-child programs and there are many play facilities. The children are very happy here, so the humidity in the room can be ignored. In addition, the butler star service is considerate. Even though I was nervous and shielded my face, I helped delay the check-out.

By the way, there is a fruit shop opposite Paipai Box in the first area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel. You must drink his small milk coconut, which is 12 yuan each. It is very delicious. After checking out, my daughter drank another one before leaving. There is also his Durian is so sweet that it makes your throat so sweet, you must try it.

msg:When I arrived at the store, the price increased to more than 8,000 per night for a room in District 2, which should be relatively new. I was really surprised when I arrived. It was very old, and almost all the furniture had scratches everywhere. The whole thing is old. Not everything is made of solid wood. The bathroom doors are all plywood sliding doors. They make very, very loud noises! The door lock of the room is broken and cannot be locked. The bathroom door is also broken and cannot be closed tightly. Both doors to the balcony are broken. The TV is broken. I stayed for two nights and had to call the front desk to fix it every night. I waited for several hours on the second night and received a call after 11 o'clock. Do you still need to repair it? I was really speechless. The shower head was also broken and leaked all the time. The leak was very big. It was uncomfortable to take a shower after a day of playing. I didn't take any pictures of the shower head. , the quilt and sheets were also stained. Staying for more than 8,000 yuan a night is really not cost-effective. As soon as I returned to the room, I felt bad. There was also a problem with the curtains. The public facilities were good, but the room was not worth it. The standard of the hotel was really HeartbreakingüôÑ

I chose to stay in a hotel during the National Day and didn‚Äôt go to any scenic spots, so I checked out the hotel. Whether it was entertainment or interactive, the children enjoyed it, and my wife and I were very relaxed.
Although I checked into the second phase, the housekeeper who mistakenly added me to the first phase was not kicked out to the second phase. I was able to make car reservations, food orders, and enquiries. Especially when ordering food, I was given a seat in the first row of the performance. Seats, surprise.

Compared with Yanlord Crown, the price is about the same. The difference in all aspects is not a little bit different. Children can live in it.

We quickly checked into Tianyu at noon. As soon as we entered the house, we saw a clean and spacious cloakroom, where we could place our clothes and luggage neatly. The double bed room was very spacious for two of us to sleep in. There was also a washing machine in the house and a balcony to dry clothes. Lie on the lounge chair and watch the beautiful scenery outside
Needless to say, there are parent-child activities in Tianyu. There are very interesting parent-child activities in every time period. In addition to these, there are also various slides and various boats. When you have enough fun, go to the beach to play in the sand and soak in the sea. The beach is clean. Only children have good physical strength and cannot stop for a day.
The parent-child travel photography that I took in the box photo was also very good. I also made beautiful continuous shots. The photographer was very friendly and the children had a happy photo-taking experience. I will take travel photos when visiting scenic spots in the future.
The Mid-Autumn Festival performance of Yujia Hotpot is also very richüòÄ
It is also very convenient to eat. Not far from the hotel, there is a snack street and a supermarket. It is also very convenient to buy fruits.

msg:A room that costs nearly 1,400 a night is actually not as good as an express hotel. The lobby is hot with no air conditioning and lots of mosquitoes. There was a musty smell in the corridor of the room, and the inside of the room looked old. When I checked in, the shower head and washbasin faucet were broken and leaking. The master came to repair it before it can be used normally. The most unpleasant thing is that the security guards are very strong when parking. They must report the complete 4-digit room number. For example, if we live in 5XX, it must be *25XX* written on the room card, otherwise we will not be allowed to park no matter what. Later, after many complaints, the security guard came to apologize, but the unpleasantness had already affected my mood. My biggest regret during this trip to Sanya was that I booked Tianyu. The cost was high but the experience in every aspect was very poor. If you are looking forward to the journey, don‚Äôt book with this hotel.

I booked a room in Zone 1. Overall, I was satisfied with the room. There was basically no smell. The bathroom had a washing machine and dryer, and especially a disinfectant block...
The hotel is quite rich in things to do. It is indeed a family hotel recommended by everyone, with many swimming pools, seaside climbing, mini trains, interactive parent-child games...
The sand on the beach close to the sea feels a bit harsh to my feet. The children had a lot of fun chasing the waves. You can catch small crabs on the seaside at night. The deck chairs on the beach are also covered with trees, and the hotel also provides sand digging tools...
Overall, as a parent-child hotel, the children are happy and worthy of this trip. I would like to especially thank the ladies at the front desk, Huang Shu and Xiaomei, for their enthusiastic and considerate service! ! ! ! ! !

There is also Jinli Seaview Restaurant in COFCO Plaza, which is also very affordable, delicious and fresh!
The only drawback is that we checked in too late. We arrived at the hotel at 4:30 pm and we couldn't check in yet. We had to wait until 5 o'clock to get a room. Since our return flight was at noon, there was no need to delay. Otherwise, we could discuss with the hotel about a delayed check-in. Late check out.

msg:I stayed in the children's room for two nights and one night. The room had a musty smell. I wanted to sleep in the next day, but I was woken up by the sun. The distance between the curtains and the window was too big and the curtains were too short and they couldn't be drawn all the way in the morning. When I got up for breakfast, I saw a small cockroach next to the coffee machine. I stayed in a sea view room the next day and changed rooms in the morning, but the front desk asked me to take all my luggage to the lobby with a one-year-old baby and take the luggage again in the evening. I was really speechless about the room. I told the staff in the morning that I wanted a three-sided bed surround and a toilet. But when I came back to the hotel at night, I was told that the larger bed surround was gone and only the small one could no longer be smaller. I called the front desk and they informed me. No, I told me to coordinate after my strong request. In the end, I took two slices before unpacking the bag and came around the bed. I felt that I had been deceived and was really speechless. I ate half of the breakfast in the first area the next day. There was a power outage. I went back to the room and packed my luggage and prepared to check out. The whole building was out of power and the elevator stopped. I waited for a long time. Anyway, it‚Äôs better not to stay in Tianyu when traveling with children. It‚Äôs too old and the facilities can‚Äôt keep up with the musty smell in the room. It‚Äôs too heavy on service and can‚Äôt keep up with the experience. It‚Äôs not as good as an express hotel. By the way, if you book a hotel that comes with photos and it‚Äôs not from a hotel, then you have to wait until you see the photos before deciding which one to buy because we‚Äôre staying there first. We bought the photos taken with the Yu Paipai box after seeing them first. On the third day, MGM gave us a photo. The Platinum travel photoshoot turned out to be very nice. The tones were better-looking, more realistic and softer than the previous ones. I bought them again before and after. I spent 5,000 or 6,000 to buy the photos. Picture 1 and 2 are the curtains. Picture 3 and 4 are the new unpacked bed surrounds. Picture 5 is breakfast and the last few pictures are from the power outage. I will regret my stay.

msg:The room is very popular with children, the design is exquisite and reasonable, and the garden outside is especially great! The hotel facilities are very good. It feels like being in a palace. It is very clean, the environment is great, and the service is in place. It is no exaggeration to say that the hotel has exclusive access to the C position in Yalong Bay. The travel photography arranged is also good, but it is better to take snapshots of smaller children, and the effect is better if they are not required to do specific actions. Just participate in various activities as you like, and you will have a lot of fun. Once you have been here, you will understand why this hotel is so popular. All in all, a very happy trip.

Facilities: I have done a lot of guides before, saying that it is old and so on, and I am still a little nervous, but after coming here, I have a good experience. I booked two rooms, one for parent-child forest play, and one for mountain views, each with its own bathtub, washing machine.
Hygiene: Very clean, the child is playing with water in the bathtub, and the bathroom is full of water, communicate with the housekeeper, and he will come to deal with it soon.
Environment: Children's paradise, very happy to play, very close to the beach.
Service: The service attitude is very good, the lady is good-looking, and she is very patient in communicating with the children.
The experience is very good! No need to go out, the hotel has food, drink and entertainment!

Sea project (choose 1 out of 3): Didn‚Äôt play, time is not enough
Play in the children's water park: children almost open their eyes and soak in it!

It is very friendly to families with children. There is also a cosmetic bag in the bathroom The place is very convenient, the big bathtub is separated from wet and dry, and the room is very big, which is really nice. Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs facilities. Here you can host parents for a whole day, swimming pool playground, children‚Äôs playground, cat play hall, small train and various entertainment venues. Children don‚Äôt want to come out after playing in the swimming pool for a day. The hotel has a pat In the box, five photos were sent in the room. I made an appoin**ent in advance. The photos are so beautiful. This is an effect that cannot be taken with a mobile phone. The photographer is also very patient and polite. In the end, we asked for all the negatives. The weather is good and there is really no need to repair them. Everything is so beautiful, it‚Äôs worth the trip! Finally, next to the hotel is Baihuagu Commercial Street, where you can find everything you want to eat and drink, and there are villages nearby. You can find it by searching Dianping. It is fresh and delicious, and the fruits are cheap and delicious. The boss can pick you up for free. All of this is wonderful, and I will choose Tianyu every time in the future. Really, really like it.

The layout of the whole room is very cramped and uncomfortable. Righteousness, I have been to Sanya so many times, and it is the first time I live in such a room. The TV is hung on an extra pipe, and you can see yourself in the mirror when you turn sideways next to the bed. Don‚Äôt mention how scary it is at night. The elevator is very noisy in the morning and evening, and there are a lot of people coming and going.

The next day I simply changed the room, but what I didn‚Äôt expect was that there were a lot of jumping bugs in the room, and I knocked out more than 20 of them in one go. It‚Äôs true that there are shadows when I sleep at night. I don‚Äôt know why I spent so much money. Come and live in such a hotel to find guilt! ! !

msg:It's still a bit outdated, but this idea is a capable person. It's good to turn the first floor, which no one likes, into a parent-child play room, but it's enough to stay for one day. The disadvantage of adding a first floor comes out, and there is no view. In other words, you can't play on the slide every day. The small yard is nice, suitable for simple dinners, but the layout of the house is not suitable for multiple people, and the small fountain is too small. It's a bit far-fetched to call it playing in the water. In general, it's fine to stay for one day. long stay is not necessary

She also helped to borrow swimming rings and sand playing tools. The impatience of checking in was wiped out‚òÄÔ∏èYes A faucet is broken and it will be repaired soon~ The restaurant staff is also very nice~ The biggest advantage of the whole hotel is the lazy tree. The sun is shining and the children can also play in the water~ The princess parade is very interesting, the children I like princesses and Sister Coke, but the weather is too hot for outdoor activities. The hotel can also consider parent-child activities on the water. Let me talk about the places that are not very comfortable. Room ~ Check-in was at a peak time, and it took me half an hour to wait for my turn. I really recommend taking measures to solve the problem during the peak period. What is lost is the playing time of the children ~ Of course, the front desk service is very good. 2‚É£Ô∏èThe little train can go around to understand the layout of the hotel. The driver asked to wait for the next bus. The lady next to me hung up the sign before 9 o'clock. Asking her for help, she just said that she would wait for the train to come back and ask. After getting on the train, another A young lady asked for the room number as if she wanted to interrogate a prisoner (maybe she was too tired at work, so she took a picture of her name, so she won‚Äôt release it here, not for individuals) 3‚É£Ô∏èThe infinity pool is closed at 7:30 in the brochure, but it actually starts before 7:00 I drove people away, and my attitude was unfriendly. I asked why, and I didn‚Äôt know. I asked if there were other swimming pools. I also said I didn‚Äôt know. I asked myself to go and have a look. Later, the director of the swimming pool came to say hello, and the director kept saying sorry and didn‚Äôt want to embarrass others. Just left 4‚É£Ô∏èConsumption coupons can be accepted without change, accumulative consumption is not acceptable, for example, 80 coupons have to be used at one time, and the people at the snack counter are also expressionless. Later, I thought of a way to store ice cream~ [Summary] The attitude of Tianyu's staff is directly linked to their own quality. Some people are under their own jurisdiction and others don't know it. The overall management and system management of the hotel are not good. In the evening, they communicated with other ÔøºÔøºÔøºguests and agreed that they didn't feel at home. Feeling~~It may be that the expectation is too great, especially from the Pullman Sanya Bay, which formed a psychological gap. The Pullman who did not expect it gave us a surprise. The sand in Yalong Bay is not as fine as Sanya Bay, and the waves are big. The bottom of the sand is steep and deep. ÔøºLittle friends are not very good at getting into the water, so they can only step on it~ In general, Tianyu‚Äôs shaded swimming pool still has an advantage. Atlantis doesn‚Äôt have shaded trees, but Sanya hotels are too competitive. Strong, if you don‚Äôt keep pace with the times, it‚Äôs impossible to improve your level~^_^I hope Tianyu will get better and better

msg:The children said that after three years of the epidemic, they stayed at home for three years, and the summer vacation is coming to an end, so they should have a beautiful trip, so they directly decided on the "parent-child Tianyu" trip without thinking. It was very late when we got off the plane, and the front desk called to ask about the itinerary, reassuring us not to worry, they have already arranged the room, and told us not to rush. When arriving at the hotel, Xiao Cai at the front desk enthusiastically prepared the room card in advance, and the check-in procedure was super fast and awesome! The full sea view room is clean and tidy. Children can lie on the bed and watch the sea. The washing machine frees the hardworking hands of the mother. Every small detail in the room is full of serious and responsible staff. Chen Xiaobo and Hu Shaoqin from the housekeeping depar**ent smile every day and ask if there is any What needs help, they are very attentive, and always prepare everything before we go back to the room, and feel full of happiness. There are also housekeepers Damei, Xingxing, and coco, who accept various consultations and help online at any time, and take the initiative to solve problems such as sending them to the airport. In short, you can get everything you need in the housekeeper WeChat group. One day after 11 o‚Äôclock in the evening, you can ask the housekeeper on WeChat, and you will get a reply within minutes. It is completely "you just ask, we will respond at any time"! Let‚Äôs talk about the parent-child activities in Tianyu. There are many parent-child activities arranged every day, such as small trains, swimming pool games, Pai Pai Le, light and shadow park, climbing frame... The park is full of trees, and small animals such as big snails and sand crabs are very popular at night. When I came out, the children were so happy to play, and it was also very relaxing for the adults to play with them. Tianyu is the hotel I stay in every time I go to Sanya. The beach here is clean, there are many recreational items, the staff is enthusiastic, and the service is first-class. I am doing my business card of "parent-child" with my heart. Putting children in Tianyu's arms is my favorite. Good choice. The people of Tianyu are devoted to the hotel and guests with sincerity. They are not only staff members, but also friends and family members. I met Xiao Gao, a staff member many years ago. With the passage of time, we became good friends. Although he has left the hotel, But the relationship remains the same. Hearing that we are coming, Xiao Gao came to see us with gifts and brothers, told us about the beauty and joy of Tianyu, and poured out their love and reluctance for Tianyu. Although they have left Tianyu, But I am full of nostalgia for Tianyu's yesterday, and full of blessings and expectations for Tianyu's future. This is Tianyu, he will make everyone who leaves and stays love deeply, Tianyu, who is changing forever!

msg:Tianyu Tianyu, the price of the ceiling, the experience of hell! A room of 1800 per night, I can only sigh who has the confidence to cheat people like this? The real service is no more than 200, which is obviously the grade of a fast hotel, with old and dilapidated equipment. Half an hour after checking in that day, all three of us felt headaches and discomfort, and there was an indescribable strange smell. We applied to the front desk to change rooms, but the 48-square-meter room was changed to 30 square meters for me. I am not **. Because Ctrip booked a four-night stay, the request for check-out was rejected. I just want to ask Ctrip, do you not control the quality of your cooperation? Or is there a chain of interests among the relevant specialists? They are working together to deceive customers and have overlord terms. During the period, the hotel duty manager also asked me to give a good review! I have my own opinion, and I can't let more people step into this pit. Besides the supporting facilities, there are always floating objects in the swimming pool, and there are staff members salvaging them, but there are always. Living facilities: breakfast buffet, overcrowded, and the charge standard is 150/person. There is really no other way but to order takeout. In this area, the cheapest are KFC and pizza. Fortunately, there is a commercial area nearby. Bucket of instant noodles is 6.5-7.5 yuan per bucket. It's just an experience. Whenever you come here, you will have a hatred with money. The average price of a meal is 100 yuan, and a 20KM trip is about 75 yuan. Anyway, it's a waste of money. There was pain in the early stage, but I just became numb in the later stage. Three people, one adult and two children, spent 26,000 yuan for five days. I won't come again.

The hotel is divided into one district and two districts, and we booked a sea view room in the second district. 2785. You can watch the sea from the balcony, and listen to the sound of waves and birdsong in the morning and evening, which is very pleasant.
The room facilities are very complete, and it is very friendly to live in. There is laundry detergent for the washing machine, but we bring our own laundry detergent. Every time you play in the water, or at night, wash it quickly. Usage is high. There are two long drying racks on the balcony, which are enough.
The bathroom has double sinks, and a large bathtub, separated from wet and dry, and there are toiletries for children.
There is also a fridge and microwave. We can continue to eat hot when we come back hungry after eating out. There is also a minibar in the refrigerator, which is replenished once a day.
The room is very big, the twin beds we ordered can be put together. There is also a large cloakroom.
The room did not find the return of moisture that others said. But it is true that the decoration is relatively old-fashioned. But this does not affect the experience of later life.
District 1 and District 2 are connected. It is suggested that when you come, you can take a small train to go around first, so that you know how many places you can play. There are many swimming pools, infinity pools, children's play pools, water slides, etc. The hotel has arranged children's activities, curling, catching ducks, catching loach, water shooting, etc., a full day.
The hotel has a pat box studio. Five photos are included in the package. Make an appoin**ent in advance. The reception staff in the store are very friendly, and the photographer is also very patient and polite. After seeing the finished film, I will ask for all the negatives!
Opposite the hotel is Baihuagu Commercial Street, but it doesn't feel right. You can go to Yalong Bay Central Plaza to try it out. Not far either.
In short, I am very satisfied with Tianyu Hotel.

Children can't stop playing on the water slide, and there is also an activity of throwing basketballs on the water to win ice cream. The water play areas are all shaded, and this is largely the reason for booking Tianyu. It is not too hot to play in the water during the day, but it is very cool when the sun sets a little bit.

Facilities: There are washing machines, bathtubs, laundry detergent tablets and washing powder. Balcony drying rack, very useful drying rack. There are children's high stools, children's toothbrush and toothpaste, and children's shampoo and shower gel. We put the twin beds together, and we called the service to deliver the bed circumference and crib. The young lady took a big sheet and put the bed together to help us make the big bed. It is wider than the bed in the big bed room, and it adds up to 2.4 meters. Very comfortable stay. The hotel is a bit old, but it doesn't affect the children's super happiness. They don't care about it at all. They think it is enough to have a bathtub and a lot of fun outside.
environment:
The shade of the swimming pool in the second area is more open until 7:00 pm, and the shade of the first area is less open until the hotel at night. There are also olive trees on the deck chairs on the beach, which is an important reason why I choose Tianyu, the shade is too important. Children's naughty treasure is very big, clean, tidy and very fun. I played n times in three days, and went to play once after swimming. The climbing frame is also very fun, but it is best for parents to follow, and it is easy to get stuck. The lawn is very beautiful, and I saw a small lizard when taking pictures. The Light and Shadow Paradise is very fun.



Service: The service is really good, and the things are delivered quickly after calling. It is estimated that there are service points on each floor. It is very good to make beds and add sheets. There are towels next to the pool, and life-saving armbands that can be used for registration. You can get swimming rings and sand digging tools for free near the beach. There is no need to take a lot of them down to play. You can see all kinds of children's activities everywhere throughout the day, and the young ladies and brothers are very enthusiastic. Just in the naughty castle, we have participated in several activities. After participating in the event, there are small gifts. The kids were so happy. The pat box is very good, very worth it, much better than other hotels, and the pat box is fast and good. I ordered a package package for all the film retouching. The small train goes around quite far, it is very fun and the scenery is very good.


Hygiene: The walls of the bathroom are a bit dirty and the space is narrow, so you can see clearly at a glance. The details need to be strengthened. There are more children in the swimming pool in the second area, and the water does not seem to be too clean. There are too many people eating in the breakfast area. It is obvious that the waiters are too busy to finish their work. We can increase the number of people and strengthen the accommodation for two nights in a deluxe mountain view room in the second district

Facilities: There are washing machines, bathtubs, laundry detergent tablets and washing powder. Balcony drying rack, very useful drying rack. There are children's high stools, children's toothbrush and toothpaste, and children's shampoo and shower gel. We put the twin beds together, and we called the service to deliver the bed circumference and crib. The young lady took a big sheet and put the bed together to help us make the big bed. It is wider than the bed in the big bed room, and it adds up to 2.4 meters. Very comfortable stay. The hotel is a bit old, but it doesn't affect the children's super happiness. They don't care about it at all. They think it is enough to have a bathtub and a lot of fun outside. There is also a water outlet on the beach for children to dig a river, and my baby played for three hours.


environment:
The shade of the swimming pool in the second area is more open until 7:00 pm, and the shade of the first area is less open until the hotel at night. There are also olive trees on the deck chairs on the beach, which is an important reason why I choose Tianyu, the shade is too important. Children's naughty treasure is very big, clean, tidy and very fun. I played n times in three days, and went to play once after swimming. The climbing frame is also very fun, but it is best for parents to follow, and it is easy to get stuck. The lawn is very beautiful, and I saw a small lizard when taking pictures. The Light and Shadow Paradise is very fun. The sea view is great, the sand is relatively thick, and there are many small shells and corals in the sea

It is obvious that the waiters can't finish their work. We can add some manpower, strengthen the cleaning near the food counter, and clean up the used dishes in time. If possible, I hope to control the number of people entering the breakfast. Cleaning around the food counter and clearing up used dishes in a timely manner. If possible, I hope to control the number of people entering the breakfast.

Overall, if you have a baby, you can choose if you are under seven or eight years old. There are many activities and facilities, and the supporting facilities are complete, so you can't finish it. Bringing babies is for their happiness. It is recommended to stay at least two nights. If the requirements are higher, parents who have high requirements for a sense of vacation should choose carefully, because the noise of babies and babies is quite lively everywhere hahahahaha.

They thought it was completely fine, and there were too many activities in the hotel. They brought their wives and daughters with them, and everyone enjoyed it. I am very happy. It takes only three minutes to walk to the beach. If you come to Tianyu for a relaxing vacation, you don't want to. Whether it is food, service, or hotel facilities, I am very satisfied, especially the butler Carson's service is very considerate, next time I bring my family to Sanya for vacation, I will definitely choose Tianyu

I heard from the local driver that Tianyu Phase II was good and suitable for children. I temporarily booked one (I didn‚Äôt book the second one) Phase 1), I want to watch the sea in the room and booked Phase 1. Although the room is smaller than Phase 2, the space is okay. It is closer to the swimming pool where children play. Tianyu is very suitable for children. The swimming pool has loudspeakers and slides for children. Internet celebrity gondola, rock climbing ladder (children really want to play, fortunately, Ctrip package has it), there is a pet playground and children's exercise area, it is very considerate for children, children like it very much, and the housekeeper Carson will arrange a car pick-up (the original package is only one time) , and arrange a free drop-off), delayed check-out, so that the journey is not too rushed, the waiters are very polite, before leaving and waiting for the bus, the little brother at the door gave the child a small Transformer, the overall feeling is very good.

The swimming pools in the second district are basically under the shade of trees, so you can swim safely during the day. The swimming pool in the first area is open until 9 pm. There are also favorite hotels with washing machines and drying racks, which are too user-friendly. It is also posted with a washing machine disinfection tablet.

Parent-child activities are still these, children like it very much, the swimming pool is shaded by trees, it is convenient to eat, walk out of the lobby and across the road to eat a lot of food in Baihua Valley, next to Haidilao, Hey Tea, Ajisen Ramen, it is convenient to eat and buy things. There are washing machines and drying racks in the room, which are very convenient. We have to change a lot of sweaty clothes, swimsuits and towels every day.
Disadvantages, the room type in the second district, the sliding folding door of the bathroom in the master bedroom is broken, it feels like it will fall down, and no one comes to fix it. Forget it, I live in it with my children, and the bathroom door is not a big problem. The toilet in the bathroom leaked, and no one came to fix it, so spread a towel to absorb water. Is the infrastructure not maintained?
Also, the beach is very rough this time, with broken shells piercing your feet. The beach was not so thick two years ago. The beach in Yalong Bay was repaired later. Now the sand is very poor, not as fine as Sanya Bay.
Overall, I hope the room will be better next time.

msg:The last time I lived in District 1 more than ten years ago, this summer Tianyu‚Äôs house supply was tight. The front desk upgraded it to a double bed with sea view, and Ctrip‚Äôs customer service Liu (?) coordinated very seriously. Four days and three nights, the overall feeling is comfortable, the adults are relaxed, and the children are happy.
Room: The room feels very good as soon as you enter the room. It's refreshing and refreshing. It doesn't feel as old as it says on the Internet. It's clean and hygienic without any peculiar smell. The room is big and comfortable.
Facilities: There are two washbasins, but there is a place where the water in the basin should leak, often forming water on the ground, and there are plastic stools stepped on by children; the single bed is 1.2 meters, and it is 2.4 meters when put together. I asked the hotel for the bed circumference. Delivered soon. There is a washing machine, but it is not used, and there is a white towel in it that should have been left by the previous guest. The cleaning is a bit sloppy. There are armbands and bath towels next to the children's pool, which can be borrowed for free. There are many lifeguards around.
Activities: There are many activities for children. We sent an activity schedule when we checked in, but we hardly participated in it, and we were all busy playing in the water. I only took one of the three small trains provided as a gift. When you don‚Äôt get the room card, you can go to the kids‚Äô club to play. There is air conditioning, mainly ocean balls and small slides, etc. Free socks for children to go in and play. There are swimming pools in District 1 and District 2. The swimming pool in District 1 is a bit far away. We all play in District 2. The infinity pool is also above the children's pool. There are also four slides in the second area, two of which can be used for double skating. Before 9:30 in the evening, there will be a male and female singer playing and singing in the first district and the second district. At night, you can come out to enjoy the sea breeze and listen to the songs.
Service: Thank you Li Rong, the housekeeper, for patiently and meticulously answering various questions encountered during the check-in process. After checking out, something was left in the room, help us find it and express it to us.
Mute: According to previous reviews, it is noisy. I haven‚Äôt encountered such a situation after checking in. Although there are many children in the hotel, it was very quiet in the rooms and corridors for three nights.
Diet: Very convenient, there are many restaurants, there are three points for breakfast, and there are many people going there after nine o'clock. Opposite District 1 is Baihua Valley. There are many restaurants, and there are many seafood shops in Yalong Bay Square next to it. You can also order takeaway and pick it up from the express cabinet outside the lobby.

We stayed for three nights, including breakfast. Going to Sanya in early June is indeed a little bit hotter than I went in February, but even if there is a lot of green shade, even the beach has a green shade. The hotel has many children's entertainment facilities, golf balls The ball ocean, climbing ladders, swimming pool, etc. are all free, only the small train is charged. The beach in Yalong Bay is also not bad. There is a section of the beach where children can play casually. Because it may be because of the sand filling, the beach in this section is very shallow and flat.
Moms, feel free to rush. The hotel is clean and the staff provide good service. There is a bus to pick you up from the duty-free shop, which is very convenient.
The hotel's breakfast is also great. It's super comfortable to sit on the balcony at night and enjoy the breeze.
Next time I have a chance, I will go to Tianyu again hahahaüòÜ

Outdoor self-service parties, hot pot, barbecue, beer, drinks, cakes and fruits, everything you expect to find, the key is there are various and rich performances, the experience is great, and the price/performance ratio is still ok
Pat box: The photography studio inside the hotel has a very good experience. Our family of four on a hot day did not want to be exposed to the sun for too long, so we quickly took a few groups of photos of the inner lawn at nine o'clock, fearing that it would be damaged by the sun. I didn‚Äôt go to the beach after I finished, and I took more than 40 photos in total. As a result, I couldn‚Äôt hold back when choosing the film. I asked for all the negatives, because there were too many films. I can't bear to have it! To be honest, the results are much better than those taken in ordinary photography studios, and they haven‚Äôt been refined yet, so I think it‚Äôs super awesome. I bought the package and the merchant gave me five additional photos for finishing. I look forward to the finished film.
Children's Water Park: There are many large and small swimming pools inside the hotel. Children have a great time playing in the water every day. The key point is that the hotel has a high shading rate, and they are not afraid of sunburn when playing in the water during the day. It is simply a paradise for children.
Facilities: The old hotel was renovated many years ago. Compared with Haitang Bay, the facilities are indeed a bit old. The rooms near the sea are all wooden structures. There is a slight musty smell, which is understandable.

Airport pick-up or drop-off: This service is not used

Facilities: complete, not very new
Hygiene: clean and tidy

Service: Nice and sent two dolls after leaving the store

There are baby cribs, fences, etc. Baby products are all available, very thoughtful
Butler service is okay, after all, there are a lot of people
The swimming ring only has a simple arm ring, but it is also very easy to use. It is best to use a butterfly ring by yourself

District 1 and District 2 are both good. I think they are all about the same distance. District 2 is newer, but District 1 has a big and retro room. I like it. It has a big balcony and baby hangers, but you don‚Äôt need to wash your clothes at all because they can‚Äôt dry at all! Three days without a single thin dress

A bottle of Evian water 18. The food in the Chinese restaurant has not stepped on the thunder. The sour fish soup is very appetizing. The fried rice noodles are very large and there is a lot of beef! Qingbuliang is also delicious!

The breakfast is okay, not like a hotel breakfast shopping at the vegetable market! It was crowded and noisy, and it was late for breakfast. I said that the child still wanted to eat an orange, and I cut a big plate without saying a word! ! Awesome

msg:A friend recommended Tianyu. When I came in, I found that it is really a big resort with a very good location. It is the first hotel on Yalong Bay Beach. It is opposite to Baihuagu Commercial Street. It is very convenient to eat. Inside the hotel, District 1 and District 2 are connected, and the scale is very large. We live in District 2, which has a balcony to see the sea. The hotel room is large, with complete facilities, washing machine and balcony for drying, which is especially convenient at the seaside. The hotel's swimming pool is very fun, just downstairs, we have played the slide countless times, and it takes a few minutes to walk to the beach, and the private beach can be visited anytime. In terms of service, it is very considerate, the service staff is very polite, the service is very efficient, and some details are well grasped. For example, the hotel sent a cake for our birthday during our stay, and when we left the store, we did not bring wireless headphones. The hotel attendant Wu Jinchun took the initiative to remind, and sent it over immediately, which was very heartwarming. There are a lot of parent-child activities in the hotel, and there are actually a lot of activities outside the hotel. Next time I come here, I will keep playing in the hotel. A very happy trip

It comes with a mini kitchen, a small washing machine and disinfection tablets. It‚Äôs a surprise. It‚Äôs very convenient to swim and change clothes in time , There is a door in the room, which cannot be opened. There are twin beds next to the kitchen. There is no power supply on either side of the bed, and the TV is far away. After reading other people's comments, I found out that this location should be the living room, and the next door should be It is another room, but Tianyu changed the living room into a kitchen and bedroom, and the next door is probably made into a separate room, so good at doing business! Fortunately, except for this small problem, the overall experience is good. I participated in the bubble party and ate the fisherman's hot pot and seafood buffet by the sea. It was very lively, and the dishes were also very rich. You can also watch performances, but the place is too crowded, and the dishes are not cleaned up in time , may be too busy, haha! Our package also includes VIP breakfast and Cantonese morning tea. The taste is pretty good, and my parents are also very satisfied. The scenery of Yalong Bay is still so beautiful. I took a lot of beautiful photos, but it was too hot!

The amu*****t park in the second district has a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãshade, which is too friendly for babies. There are cribs and baby pots, which are very considerate and the details are also very good. It is more suitable for babies under seven or eight years old than MGM. Swimming without sun exposure has killed everything in seconds. Moreover, the beach is gentler and more delicate than MGM. Staying at MGM for two nights, I almost didn't step on the sand or prick my feet barefoot.

There are many parent-child activities in the hotel, and the most attractive to children are several swimming pools, one is the hovercraft slide with a big horn, and the other is the jungle slide in the pool in the second area. When checking out, because it was Children's Day, the housekeeper Lirong gave the child several small gifts, and the child was very happy

msg:Taking advantage of the low season of tourism, I took my children to Hainan for a week, driving from Haikou, Wanning, Lingshui and Sanya. I stayed in two hotels in Sanya, one is Tianyu Resort Hotel and the other is Yalong Bay Guest House.
Let me talk about Tianyu first:
We check in at 12 o'clock and we don't need to wait until 3 o'clock to enter the room directly (some rooms are not cleaned well, and rest rooms will be arranged for the guests who are about to check in).
üè†The deluxe room in District 1 is half smaller than the guest house I stayed in the day before, and the furniture looks old. When I sit in it, I always get a strange smell, but I don‚Äôt plan to use the washing machine. We changed rooms. Later, the waiter took an air purifier and put it in the room to improve it. I personally don't have too many requirements for where to live. As long as the 100 yuan and 1000 yuan are not too dirty, I can accept the older ones. After all, I won't stay in the room most of the time. If you mind, choose carefully.
üíÅPersonally, I think Tianyu's service is pretty good. As soon as I get off the bus, someone will carry my luggage to the front desk to check in, and after successful check-in, someone will bring it to the room. At the same time, the housekeeper will contact you on WeChat. We contacted the front desk to get the small toilet, fence, table knife, fruit plate, and small quilt. Every time it was delivered quickly and with a good attitude.
üçúWe also ordered takeaway twice, both of which were picked up in the lobby. Later, when I went to the opposite Baihua Commercial Street, I found that I could eat fresher ones at the same price (you must buy the set menu to get more discounts). Regarding the buffet breakfast, because I prefer to be vegetarian, I am very satisfied with the abundance of fruits and vegetables. Children can eat noodles, porridge and various breads.
üé®You can get the balloon in the lobby at noon every day, no child can escape the magic of the balloon. We also participated in archery competitions, kite painting, and watching magic shows... Most of the rest of the time was spent playing in the swimming pool. I felt that the whole day was very fulfilling and many activities were too late to participate.
üèäThe swimming pool in the second district is especially suitable for younger children. There are terminalia trees planted around the swimming pool, which makes it cooler all day long. Maybe because of the fallen leaves, the water in the swimming pool will not be so clean. Every day at 11:00 and 5:00 p.m., there are basketball or frisbee activities. We participated in three times and received coconuts, ice cream, and popcorn rewards. Children have a special sense of accomplishment, and they go to the lobby to collect her before meal time every time. booty.
üöÑReservation is a gift of a small train, in fact, one ride is enough, the small train itself is relatively slow, and the enthusiasm will decrease after sitting for a long time. Furthermore, there is not enough time every day, and basically I will not spend extra money to sit again. We included the coconut chicken combo and it was not bad for dinner by the sea. I am also quite satisfied with the five photos presented in the Paipai box (the previous article has been written).
To sum up, bringing children to Tianyu is a place where you can play for a long time and have fun!

msg:The old five-star hotel in Yalong Bay now focuses on parent-child vacations. The hotel has its own travel photography depar**ent. Of course, you know the price. The landscaping has a high coverage rate, and various tropical plants are planted. It is the first time I saw a terminalia tree, and I really want to bring a seed back to Shanghai to plant one!
The swimming pool is designed to suit children's psychology. There are many varieties of buffet breakfast, and the staff are soft-spoken from the elderly to 18 years old. After check-in, the guests will be taken to the room. There are three types of pillows that can be exchanged when calling the room service choose.
There are uniformed security guards at the entrance and exit of the beach. There are quite a lot of hotel facilities, and it is a bit difficult to step on them all in one day. The temperature in Yalong Bay at the end of May is 27-33¬∞C. On sunny days, the color of the sea water varies with the time of the day. Although the photo shoot on the beach is very hot, it is still amazing to see the color of the film produced by the traveler.
After eating for two nights, the Baihuagu Catering Commercial Street across the road from the hotel is generally 100+ per capita, and the price/performance ratio is not high. When ordering, you will find that vegetables are particularly expensive. At 21:00 in the evening, walk eastward from Baihuagu along Longhai Road, the more you walk, the quieter you will be until you arrive at the Seaview International Resort Hotel in the east of Yalong Bay. Go through the lobby of his house and go down to the public beach, then walk west along the beach of Yalong Bay, you can walk back to Tianyu, you will pass through the totem poles of Yalong Bay, the round trip is 3.8 kilometers, and it takes more than an hour to walk.
Tianyu has a shuttle bus to and from the airport and a bus to the Haitang Bay Duty Free City, which must be reserved one day in advance.
The service attitude of the housekeeper Coco was good when checking out, and even gave the child a hand-held electric fan before leaving.

Every time I come to Sanya for vacation, I choose Tianyu because the beach of Tianyu is very suitable for stepping on the water with children. The sea water is also the most beautiful sea view in my opinion, and it is pleasing to the eye. When I came to Tianyu this time, I found that there is a washing machine in the room, which is great! It saves you the trouble of washing clothes by hand in such hot weather, especially for those with children, who understand everything, super bonus points! What's more, the service is also very good. The butler Xiao Liu is very considerate and thoughtful. He greets me in time every morning and helps me coordinate various problems. Very, very nice! The room service is also very good, and they are interrupted in time every day. In short, the check-in experience is very good, but it is true that there are many children and many activities, and many of them are too much to play! It is recommended for children aged 3-7 to stay in Tianyu, the swimming pool is suitable for children!

I live in a sea view room in the second district. The room is cleaned every day, and the clothes are folded neatly. There is also a washing machine in the second district, which is really convenient. After going out to swim and play with the sand every day, there is a washing machine to free your hands, which is so fragrant.
The service is super warm. The staff will greet us warmly when they see us. We asked for a few more bottles of water at the front desk, and the staff directly brought us a box, as well as a small toilet for children, small pillows and quilts, and various children's products. Everything is available.
Let‚Äôs talk about playing, the sand is very soft and comfortable to step on, the paddling pool in the second district is covered by trees, and the hotel provides children‚Äôs swimming armbands, water guns and sand digging tools for free, and enough bath towels can also be prepared.
There are many activities every day from morning till night. Magic show, clown show, small parent-child sports, water shooting, three-year-old children can basically play, and there are small prizes, children have a lot of fun.
In the evening, I participated in the starlight party, which is highly recommended. Brother Shark is very interactive, and the children will have a great time playing and learn a lot of body expressions.
Tianyu is really super suitable for bringing children to play, it is worthy of the ceiling of a parent-child hotel.

The room is quite big as soon as you enter the door, but it's really old. The bathroom is very humid, and the washbasin is not designed well. Every time you wash your hands, there will be a lot of water splashing on the countertop and the floor. There are indeed bugs in the room, so you have to check carefully.

The breakfast is not very rich. There are the most people eating breakfast. The restaurants in the hotel are very expensive and not delicious. It is recommended to take out or go to the commercial street to eat. The commercial street has more choices but it is not particularly delicious. It will not be delicious when you go out. Just be it. Tianyu‚Äôs room service is very good. I call at any time and answer it within 3 seconds. The male waiters are also very enthusiastic about cleaning, but they are really tired. The room is full at any time and they have to keep cleaning. I feel that I am almost out of energy. , This hotel has never been to this hotel before and the Internet said it was very good, so I came here to experience it. The feeling is not as good as I imagined. I didn‚Äôt participate in parent-child activities. The children just swim. The beach waves are quite big and the wind blows the child‚Äôs nose. Tianyu is really 10 Eight of the children are coughing, but they are not infected with influenza A or norovirus. I try to bring the children so that they do not get together. I will change the hotel later and I will recommend Holiday Inn to everyone. I really live here and feel that the room hygiene and breakfast are simply the ceiling. . The hotel also gave 5 travel photos as a gift. The staff of the travel photos have a very good attitude, and an extra photo is 38 yuan.

I feel that the facilities are not as old as those mentioned on the Internet. We all like it. The service It's really good, all the staff are enthusiastic to help solve the problem, and later I stayed in a room in the first district. The first district and the second district are different. If you can experience them all, you can experience all the free room packages, spa Ah, there are a lot of family food packages, you can see what you need, the baby doesn't want to leave the store today. . The Pai Pai box in the hotel was also taken for Baobao Brigade, and it was very popular. We finally ordered a package to record his childhood. . . This is the first time I write so many reviews, and the whole family likes it very much, because I play crazy with my baby every day, and there is no time to take pictures of the beautiful scenery. . .

Big speakers, double slides, infinity pool near the sea, small train... the baby had a great time playing! The hotel's service is also very good. The restaurant has building blocks for babies to play with and SpongeBob SquarePants TV. There is even a bed for babies to sleep in. It's really considerate! In addition, the hotel also has a trolley loan service, which frees our hands. Finally, the travel photo box sent by the hotel added to the icing on the cake of our trip. At first, I was worried that the baby would not listen to the instructions, but the little brother was very good at capturing and guiding, and preserved many beautiful moments. It was really an unexpected harvest.

I stayed in a fresh standard room in District 1, which should be the lowest priced room, but I was very satisfied with everything after I checked in. Children's bath and shampoo products, children's toothbrush and toothpaste, the toothbrush is very cute in the shape of a rabbit, there are also booster stools for children, washing machine, balcony It's big, and the room is big. I didn't see any bugs. It's very clean. Once I entered the hotel, I gave up the idea of going anywhere. There are so many friends in the hotel. There are so many free activities, mainly The outdoor swimming pool is super awesome. There are very large water parks in the first and second districts. You can play all kinds of exciting slides for unlimited times. It's so cool! You can see the sea from the hotel, go directly to the beach, the sand and the sea are good, there are deck chairs and sand digging toys, and there are many small animals in the hotel... The service attitude from check-in to departure is also very satisfactory, it is worth it, take the children to play in Sanya Absolutely number one! My child is four years old and doesn't want to leave after playing. I originally wanted to make an appoin**ent for a trip, but I didn't make an appoin**ent in order not to delay her play. The most important thing is to be happy. Although I gave a small gift when I left, I hope it will be well received, but if I don't give it to me, it will be well received. Very attentive hotel, worth five stars! By the way, the little duck baby sent at check-in is very cute.

msg:The total score is 4 points.
I booked a duplex room with a swimming pool terrace. When passing by the corridor of the hotel, I felt that the decoration style did not meet my taste. When I entered the room, the lighting in the living room was very dark and there was no main light. The lighting in other locations is okay, and the decoration can be said to be very old-fashioned. It has been a long time since I have seen a spherical revolving door handle. Part of the wooden decoration is rotten and slag, giving people the feeling of an abandoned mansion. The fridge was in dilapidated condition and the shower was badly leaked. Regarding the complaints about the terrace, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my back or the wind on the 8th floor is that strong, and the glasses were blown away when I put it on the sideüòÇ I stayed for 3 days and there was a strong wind every day, and it‚Äôs more difficult to go into the water this month Difficult so the pool was useless. Toiletries are nice. I gave 3 to 4 sets of L'Occitane on the first night, and then I gave one set every day after cleaning. Health status is acceptable.
Then I will talk about my feelings these days.
The overall a**osphere at the front desk of the hotel is acceptable, but when you step into the hotel, the staff in other locations seem to be very busy, and they seldom greet each other proactively. Felt not up to the standard of the hotel itself.
Regarding the outdoors: There are a lot of things for children to play in the hotel, but some of them need to be spent. But one thing to note is that the entrance to the public bath is on the left hand side of the hotel, and people are mixed. Some public bath tourists also come to the facilities in this hotel.
The travel photos sent by the hotel booking are okay. Anyway, the effect of 5 selected for free is not bad.
Regarding meals: Breakfast is really nothing to eat. Compared with the Ritz World, it is bread slices with pure milk oa**eal and an extra bowl of noodles every day during the few days of stay. About VIP club afternoon tea: This one is not bad, but it has fewer styles than other hotels, not as good but at least not shivering.
In short: I'm sorry for the price of 6888. At the same price, I can go to the Ritz to book a garden-view one-bedroom plus a standard room with breakfast, which is completely enough. The food is also relatively average. I didn't take my children to play very much. On the day of check-out, the children needed to take online classes and wanted to delay the check-out until 2 o'clock. The housekeeper replied that the room was full and needed to apply. At around 9:50, I refused to delay the check-out on the grounds that the room type was booked. At 10:30, I checked the listing on Ctrip and it was available for reservation. I felt very speechless. üôÑ

In addition to the more lively Dadonghai in the urban area, there are more Internet celebrity restaurants and more food. Yalong Bay is more suitable for vacation. Tianyu Hotel is located in the center of Yalong Bay. There are several shopping and food courts next to it. It is very convenient to eat, drink and have fun, so we did not rent a car for the three nights we stayed, and all places can be reached on foot, but the hotel is too big, so I didn‚Äôt go out of the hotel very much these days. 10,000 steps üòÖ We booked a deluxe room in the first district, which is not a sea view room. Because we have elderly and children, we booked the first district. The first district is newly renovated and has smart toilets, washing machines and dryers. The whole room is very new and the equipment is also The new washing machine is equipped with disinfectant powder and washing powder, which is very convenient. There is also an area that is best selected for selection. I originally planned to choose a full sea view room, but the full sea view room is a fresh room, so I gave up. The selection room is really good, but our building There is only an elevator on the first floor, so it is really far to go to the room. The hotel has complete facilities, there are various swimming pools, children's playgrounds, zoos, climbing frames, etc. We stayed for three days and only played part of it. It is recommended to stay for more than three nights, otherwise There is no time to play, and there are many activities, but it is not suitable for children under the age of three or four. They are basically playing games and competitions. It is not free. We signed up for a beach night party for 150 yuan. I meant to rest. Let the baby go to play, and all kinds of competitions with the baby made our parents tired. But the baby is very happy. The hotel said that takeaway is prohibited, but takeaway can also be delivered. You can pick it up at the express cabinet at the door. There are many restaurants in the hotel. Our first day The buffet is very good. If you book in advance, you may not have a seat. The seafood buffet is more than 200 per person. There are not many things, but it is rich. It is next to the sea, and there are various performances at night. Children like it very much. It‚Äôs pretty good. Other restaurants are good. So-so, there is also a lawn bbq, which is not bad. It is recommended to add breakfast. There are three breakfast restaurants in total, one of which is Huayuhai, which has an invincible sea view. I ate at 10 o'clock every day, and I saved lunch, but I would get tired of eating delicious food for three days. Before I went, I read Xiaohongshu that the hotel flu was serious, but we went there, but we did see some children In the case of vomiting in the breakfast room, it is best to prepare salt supplements and oseltamivir to be prepared. There are hotel lounge chairs on the beach, and there are tree shades on the beach chairs. Children digging sand next to it will not be good for the sun. After going to several bays, I think it is still Yalong Bay Best of all, the sand is not too thick and not dirty, the sea is clear and the wind and waves are not too big, you can go into the water. The last time I went to Haitang Bay, I could only dig sand. It‚Äôs really boring to have nothing around. I‚Äôll come again next timeü•∞

Let‚Äôs talk about the room first. The children‚Äôs room we booked in the second district is on the seventh floor, so there is no mosquito, musty or damp feeling. The whole is very big and clean. Although the decoration is a bit old, I hope that after the second phase, we can also install a washing machine , dryers and the like are too much needed! There is nothing to say about the overall environment of the hotel, it is really beautiful, there are deck chairs everywhere on the beach, and there are shades everywhere, so you don't worry about sunburn. Regarding parent-child projects, there are a lot of activities from morning to night. The baby's favorite is the bubble party and the little train, which is highly recommended. You will never be idle all day long, it is a happy paradise for your baby. Let‚Äôs talk about food and beverages. The breakfast is rich but the taste is a bit lacking. Huayuhai Restaurant facing the sea is the most beautiful of the three breakfast spots. The taste of the hotel's dock restaurant is also good. Regarding the swimming pool, there are several large and small ones. The infinity pool and water slide are in the second phase, and the big speakers are in the first phase. Each of them is very fun. I personally feel that the water is clean and not crowded. Regarding the pat box, because the baby is not very cooperative, the effect of the photo is average, but after an hour of shooting, I finally took all the photos as a souvenir. You can also make an appoin**ent to take pictures by yourself, and the price may be more suitable. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the service, which is what we are most satisfied with. I was worried when I saw all kinds of complaints before coming here, but I found that everyone was very enthusiastic during the whole stay, from the airport pick-up to the front desk to the concierge depar**ent to the housekeeper Damei. , all needs are quickly responded to, this time I only stayed for two nights and my baby has not had enough fun, I will continue to choose next time I come, give me a thumbs up!

The two-bedroom house in the forest in the second phase, the room decoration is quite interesting, the room in the second phase is not old, and it is acceptable, but I thought that the second room must have at least one door, but it turned out to be a big room. This room type is located on the 1st floor. We checked in before 12 o'clock, and many rooms were not cleaned properly. We were given the first room in Figure 5, which is the first room on the left when entering the door. It is convenient to travel, but if you encounter parents with low quality Children, they are still running and playing in the elevator room at 11 o'clock in the evening, it is really noisy. It is recommended that you ask the front desk to arrange a room away from the elevator hall. Moreover, there are many mosquitoes on the first floor. On the first day of my house, I was scratched all over my body in the middle of the night and couldn‚Äôt sleep. I turned on the light and saw that my whole body and face were red, and there were many red bumps. The skin was extremely itchy. I rushed to the hospital. Fortunately, I brought some calamine when I went out. I didn‚Äôt know if it was helpful, so I applied it all over her body. It seemed that the temperature had cooled down and she could fall asleep. I was bitten by 4 large bumps on my forehead, which should be from poisonous mosquitoes, and then caused systemic allergies, like hives. Later, I told the service staff who cleaned the room that they brought mosquito repellent and sprayed it on the small terrace at the door. He said that the hotel also has a doctor, and if the child is still unwell, he can go to see it, which is not bad.
There are quite a lot of parent-child activities in the hotel, but some of them are charged. The evening party is 150 once, and it is enough to participate once. We played twice, and the content is basically the same. There is no need to spend twice.
The hotel's heated swimming pool is not big, and there are too many people, like dumplings. Because the water is still a bit cold in mid-March, everyone chooses a constant temperature swimming pool.
The seaside train provided in the package may be suitable for small children, and the children in the kindergarten class will find it boring.
Come on Duck Little Yellow Packet: A small yellow bag is given away, which is very convenient to use in hotels
Pick up or drop off: We used the drop off service and it was fine.

On the contrary, the environment and location of the hotel are superb. Two families with two children can basically enjoy themselves without leaving the hotel. As expected of an old-fashioned parent-child hotel, the children refused to go home after playing. In the end, they forgot their mobile phone on the hotel shuttle bus. After arriving home, they contacted the butler Xiao Liu to help find the mobile phone and send it back. They were enthusiastic and kind throughout the whole process, really It's really great, and it helped me a lot. It must be a five-star praise. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay in Tianyu

The breakfast at Huayu Sea is basically the same, because you can see the sea and the environment is good. There is no difference between the three breakfast places. If you are not picky about the taste of breakfast, it is good. The beach environment could be cleaner. Although it is not as good as it was when I came to Sanya after filling it, it is still soft. Is it possible to see cigarette butts when digging the sand with children? I hope it can be improved. Also, it is hoped that each room can provide a bathtub set.

The first area is very good, the room is clean and tidy, there is a washing machine and a heating towel rack, the utilization rate is very high, and the full sea view room is also amazing! When I returned to the room during my stay on the second day, I had already changed clean towels and made the bed, which was very good. Not to mention the parent-child facilities in the hotel, it‚Äôs just more suitable for older babies to play, but our little ones also had a good time playing and refused to leave. We also ate Tianyu‚Äôs self-service hot pot. Although the dishes are not exquisite, they are better than the artistic conception. Facing the sea, eating hot pot and watching various performances, it is really beautiful to eat and play with the baby. Let‚Äôs talk about check-out, because there is still a task of taking pictures, Damei at the front desk kindly changed the check-out time to 2 o‚Äôclock, and there is also a handsome guy to help us carry our luggage.

msg:I took my baby to live in Yalong Bay for a week and Haitang Bay for a week. I booked two full sea view rooms in Tianyu Yalong Bay. It was a relatively thorough experience of Tianyu. Except for MGM and Hilton, Yalong Bay has basically stayed in other coastal hotels. Personally, I think it is still ok Speaking of dry goods, experience sharing is as follows:
advantage:
1. The geographical location is unique. Opposite the neighboring business district is Baihuagu, you don‚Äôt need to take a taxi to eat and cross the road, which is more convenient than other hotels; of course, even if you live in the Ritz-Carlton, it only takes 7-8 minutes to take a taxi to Baihuagu, and there are many cars on call.
2. Rich parent-child activities. Although there are repetitions every day, it is still designed with care, which does have certain advantages; parent-child facilities are relatively complete, the hotel fish pond, chicken coop, game hall, slides and swings are basically complete, and the guest rooms are equipped with bathroom drying racks and telescopic clothes drying poles Wait, basically configure it according to the parent-child configuration, especially the washing machine is very useful, and it is directly second to the Renhe Crown in the small 3K one night in Haitang Bay.
3. The price is relatively affordable. Of course, this is compared to the 5-star prices of Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. The peak season price at the end of February remained at more than 1,000.
shortcoming:
1. The facilities are old and lack of maintenance. I know Tianyu is old. After all, I came here when I was a child, and now my baby is several years old. I specially chose a new major, but it was unexpected. The TV remote control is broken, the hair dryer is not hot, the shower rack cannot be fixed, and the balcony door handle The frame fell off, and it felt like four words, broken and tattered.
2. The pool temperature is too low. There is only one indoor swimming pool in the second and a half phases of the hotel, where dumplings are served at a constant temperature, and the others are ice-cold pools with a blind test of 20 degrees.
3. Room service procrastination and lack of training. Even with a butler (I haven‚Äôt seen you for five days), the response to inquiries and requests is very slow, and I only reply after I solve it. It can be seen that the butler is too busy with countless guests. If this is the case, don‚Äôt match it. One-on-one but no one-on-one service level, all the waiters in the five-day hotel did not greet each other, and some even chatted with each other, so learn from the Ritz-Carlton to feel at home.
4. The breakfast is crowded and the dishes are lackluster. After 8:30, there is basically a long queue, the management is chaotic, the turnaround is slow, and there is nothing amazing about the food. The only thing I remember is the long queue of beef offal rice noodles.
5. The beach is dirty and littered. This has nothing to do with the hotel. After all, I know it is not in the category of hotel management, but it is indeed too dirty. The best beach in the country is full of garbage, and photo-tourist hawkers are chasing and fooling you. The way it looks like, Koh Samui in Bali is a few streets away, the same price (even cheaper) why should I come here.

Viewing: Some hotels do not have sea view rooms, but you can see the garden view. This hotel‚Äôs garden view and sea view are in the same place, so the mountain view room at the back really can‚Äôt see anything. If you want to see the view It‚Äôs the sea view room that makes people feel lively
Facilities: There is no washing machine in the mountain view rooms in the second district, but it is convenient to have a self-service laundry bar in the first district, but the laundry detergent will not be provided in the next few days, so you have to bring your own laundry detergent
Hygiene: After checking in on the first day, I found feathers, melon seed shells, and spider webs in the corners. After all, it is a room with an average price of 2,000+ per night. I cannot accept the level of hygiene. After seeing the cleaning tools of the waiter in the next few days, I understood, because the wooden floor does not need a vacuum cleaner, just use a mop to mop it, but the corners cannot be mopped.
Environment: The room is too old, the wooden floor creaks, you have to be careful when going to the toilet at night to avoid waking up your family, and the sliding door is always loud!
Service: The attitude is very good. If there is any problem, I will actively solve it. It is also very fast to ask for some water and towels. The meeting will say hello. The waiters in the public area are also very polite. The service experience is not bad
Catering: There are three breakfast rooms, and the food is the same. There is no difference in the food. Among them, Huayuhai can sit outdoors and enjoy the sea view, and the other two are indoors. The decoration and utensils are very poor, and the farmhouse is optimistic. There are four restaurants open during the day: Boat House (you can sit outdoors by the swimming pool and the seaside, there are coconut chickens, the billboard says 298/half, the actual checkout is 368/half, said the price has increased); The dishes are mixed, everything is not authentic, it is the lowest price among several restaurants, and it can solve daily meals); Yeyuan (Hainan cuisine, the taste is better than the others, the price is slightly higher); there is also a fisherman's hot pot , I didn‚Äôt go because of the bad reviews. Every few days there will be a bonfire barbecue buffet on the lawn. It‚Äôs cold outside these few nights.
Beach: The lawn leads directly to the beach, with shade trees, deck chairs, fine sand, suitable for children
Recreational facilities: large climbing frame 90 yuan/time, paddle board 198 yuan/time, slightly cheaper to buy on the official account
Others: On New Year's Eve, the mask in the last picture was presented as a gift, which was a surprise

There is also a small train that children like, and a movie viewing paradise Waiting for a lot of activities, the beach is also very large, and the environment for watching the sea is good!

There are a lot of water parks outside. It was a bit cold during the few days I could stay, so I didn't dare to play in the water, which was a pity. There is a beach behind the hotel. Although it is a public beach now, it feels that there are relatively few people behind the hotel. The hotel provides free sand digging tools, and my baby has been digging sand here for three days!
The hotel's service is perfect. I brought a baby to stay. I provided a bed circumference, a crib, a milk warmer, and a bottle sterilizer, but the bed circumference is very small, and there is no way to completely surround the 2-meter bed, and it doesn't feel too strong. Finally Still used the crib.
Special praise to Xiao Zhou from the concierge depar**ent. The service is very thoughtful. When I left the store, I had too much luggage. I helped to send the luggage from the room to the airport bus.

There was no room, but when I left to store my luggage, the waiter told me that there was a room. Did not wait until 4.5 pm like other friends.

msg:Facilities: After all, it has been a few years, and everything is good, but the decoration color is a bit old-fashioned, and the floor still creaks when stepped on. I booked a family room, because my father snores and I am a light sleeper, so it is better to have a partition.

Hygiene: It's quite clean. Old decoration doesn't mean it's dirty. It's refreshing and clean as soon as you walk in.

Environment: The lawn is huge, there are many swimming pools, and children like it very much. They have to swim every day, and the beach has natural shade. This is especially friendly to children who like to dig sand. I didn‚Äôt think this was particularly important, but it‚Äôs a sunny day It would be much better to have the shade of the trees. It‚Äôs okay for us to go swimming and dig the sand at noon.

Service: Most of the services are very good. The butlers Wang Ting and Mengzhu are very friendly and enthusiastic. There are only a few people who are not very enthusiastic, and seem to be irritable, especially the clerk at the dinadora ice cream side, why, can't I use group purchase coupons to buy ice cream? A look of helplessness.

The photos sent by the hotel, the pat box, I feel that there should be no good-looking pictures after the day, the baby is not very cooperative, and it is the first time I come to the beach to dislike the sand on the beach, but the photos I took are all very good-looking. great.
I will come to Tianyu again next year when my baby is older and not afraid of sand. It is very convenient to have a commercial street next to it.

The front desk upgraded the room with a bathtub, but because there is no balcony on the second floor, there is only a big roof, so the view outside the window is a bit of a hindrance. For babies, the roof can be used casually. My child has a big roof. It's a bit wasteful, but I love the big bathtub. I live in Baoting to Sanya these days and I have to take a hot bath every day.
I read a lot of reviews saying that District 1 doesn‚Äôt look like an express hotel, so we didn‚Äôt have high expectations, but we felt really good after checking in. The room is big. Although it‚Äôs not fancy, the decoration is exquisite and the details are in place. , The washing machine and drying rack helped a lot, and I saved a lot of clothes for washing during the self-driving trip. If there is something bad about it, it would be great if the bed could be replaced with one above 1.35m.
The biggest advantage is that it is close to the sea. It is only a few steps away. There are different water slides in the first and second districts, and children love to play. The heated swimming pool is not big, full of children.
There are plenty of activities in the hotel. If my children are a few years younger, they will be so happy. The hotel sent a bubble party. Although they belonged to the oldest group, they looked like they hadn't grown up, and they still had a lot of fun.
The pat box given by the hotel is very popular, so you must make an appoin**ent when you arrive at the hotel, otherwise you will not be able to make an appoin**ent.

3. The first area I live in this time, the interior decoration is bright and comfortable, and the children like it very much. Living in it feels like sleeping peacefully.

4. The hotel service is very patient. This time I went to Tianyu, there were many tourists in the hotel, but the lobby service staff checked in very patiently. Thanks to the two butlers of Tianyu: Li Rong and Wang Ting. Patiently answer customers' requests and feel their enthusiasm and meticulousness. Kudos to Tianyu's management.

Finally, let‚Äôs mention the pat box. At first, I was curious about what kind of high technology it is. Let me reveal it to curious babies. It is a photography shop with a cute name.

The children have a great time playing. If parents feel tired, they can take care of their children, and the fee is not expensive. When the weather is good, the sea in Yalong Bay is very beautiful. There are trees specially planted on the beach of Tianyu. The large area just provides shade for the beach lounge chairs. They are very careful. It is said that they have been cultivated for many years. Thank you

advantage:
1. Checked in after 10:00 in the morning, and the room needs to be handed over at 3:00 in the afternoon. I was given a key to the lounge. I thought it was just a locker, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be an exclusive lounge with two beds. You can rest in it change clothes!
2. For the most basic room type in the first phase, a small washing machine is equipped on the balcony, and disinfection blocks and washing powder are also provided. It is very important for tourists who travel for a long time. They have to swim every day and change a lot of clothes!
3. I made an appoin**ent for the bus drop-off at 4:00 p.m., Yaxue at the front desk took the initiative to help extend the check-out until 2:00 p.m., which is very considerate when there are endless tourists!
4. There are plenty of activities for children, and there is no need to make an appoin**ent, just participate when the time comes.
5. There is a large heated swimming pool, even if the temperature is not enough, children can swim!
6. The restaurant in the second district has a richer breakfast, there will be queues during peak hours, and jackfruit and papaya are free üòÅ
Talk about the disadvantages:
1. The bathroom is too small, this is also hardware, there is no way to change it
2. The sound insulation is too bad. I can hear the doorbell next door clearly in this room. I often think my doorbell is ringing. I took a hanger in the closet and thought it was in my closetüòì
3. Children's manicures are so pitiful and chaotic, 28 yuan will be lost the next day!
Generally speaking, the size and condition of the room is not as good as that of the opposite Huayu, but the activity area and the swimming pool are completely superior. By the way, there are fireworks on the beach at night, just wait

When we first arrived at the hotel, the room was not tidied up. Yaxue at the front desk warmly helped us with the formalities and stored our luggage. Let us go first. After the hotel tour, wait for the room to be tidied up and then call me. There are a lot of children's activities in the hotel, and the amu*****t facilities are also very rich. Experience a few projects every day and the day will pass quickly. The daily breakfast is also very rich and varied. We stayed for three days, and the room attendant cleaned it every day in a timely manner. The children had a great time playing, and before leaving, Yaxue gave a small gift from the hotel. Tianyu Hotel has a good experience

The environment of the hotel is very good. It was the first time I stayed in Tianyu District 2. They said that the facilities were old, but there were no such facilities in District 2. The balcony is large, the room is large, the bathroom has double washrooms, a large bathtub, and there is a separate cloakroom with sliding doors on three sides , don't hold your breath. Very close to the sea, suitable for bringing children. The breakfast is also rich. The VIP dining area can see the garden and the sea. The hotel service is good.

The room was equipped with a washing machine and a smart toilet. The room was also very new, not as humid as the sea view room, which was great. There are also many types of breakfast. There are two restaurants where you can eat, which can reduce the flow of people, which is very good. There are many facilities for children to play in the hotel, and the hosting service is also very good. My 4-year-old child was reluctant to leave when he left. Looking forward to staying here next time!

Tianyu Holiday
Good: The hotel is very complete and has everything
The highlight is that it is suitable for families with children
All kinds of activities are not idle all day
Opposite is the commercial street, too much delicious
Full marks for clothes drying rack and other details!
Too many good ones to list!
not good:
The room is like an enlarged version of 7 days, and the hardware feels a bit behind (especially the shower room in the bathroom... It doesn't feel like the price of 1300 a night)

The room is super soundproof (neighbors quarreled in the early morning, because there is no soundproofing, the children next door crying at night can be heard clearly)
In general:
Tianyu is a very suitable hotel for children under 5 years old
Not suitable for couples, couples without children, or children over 8 years old
From morning to night, someone will help you take care of the baby and engage in activities and interactions
There are zoos, swings, beaches, grass, deck chairs...
Overall, I think if you have a baby, you must come.
There are baby bathrobes, toothpaste, small stools, etc. in the room, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt have such a small child

msg:Every year when you come to Sanya to play, you must stay at Tianyu Hotel in Yalong Bay. You can experience the advantages and disadvantages of Xiatianyu with your conscience.
1. The location is good, Yalong Bay. The c seat is nothing to say. The first-line sea view is very beautiful and it is very close to the beach. The hotel has a private beach. Now Yalong Bay, a beach in Sanya where you can go to the sea, is very good and beautiful. You can go out from the lobby of District 1 to the Valley of Flowers. Take a taxi and order takeaway It is very convenient. It is convenient to go to any scenic spots in the center of Sanya.
2. The hotel facilities and services are really good. As long as you make a request, it will be satisfied without special circumstances. The sea view room of the hotel room has a very beautiful sea view, and the hygiene is also very good and serious. Various children's activities and play areas are suitable for children of all ages. The swimming pool is not big but it is enough for children to play. There is also a heated swimming pool in the cave that children must go to. It takes only a minute or two to walk to the beach from the lobby. Various greenery in the hotel The garden lawn design is very reasonable and beautiful. And now the hotel has cooperated with Paipaibox to take free travel photos, and the photographer is very patient.
3. The hotel's breakfast is worthy of the price. It is very good. There is nothing special, but it can be seen that it is very attentive. The hotel's afternoon tea is really good. You can eat whatever you want and you can take it unlimited.
Let me focus on the disadvantages of Tianyu Hotel: the interior of the room is old and the facilities are seriously aging, and it looks very dilapidated, but there is no way that no matter how good the decoration is, it will be finished. It can be seen that the designer spent a lot of money on the use of room space Thoughts, but I really don't understand why there is no door to the toilet in the sea view room in the second district! Make up the rest by yourself.
To sum it up, if you bring your children to Sanya, Tianyu Yalong Bay is one of the must-stay parent-child hotels. Pay attention to choosing a good room type and recommend a room with a full sea view. The rooms in the second district are larger than those in the first district.

In the end, we chose sea view. After all, every city has parent-child rooms. We get up early and have breakfast before going to the beach Play, there are a lot of shade trees, especially friendly to babies, our room seems to have been made a mistake by the front desk and turned into a panoramic sea view room, the view is very open, recently Sanya has been very windy, but 10:00-16: 00 It is no problem to bring children to play outdoors. Be sure to pay attention to sun protection. You still have to wear thick clothes for your children when you go out at night. It is very close to Baihuagu Commercial Street, and you can go out in the first district. The price of the sea experience project behind the hotel is also very suitable.

In Tianyu, the children's vacation can also be the parents' vacation. As long as the children are handed over to the hotel, the parents can completely liberate themselves and enjoy the leisurely vacation time. It can completely overthrow the curse of "the gods and beasts are on vacation, and parents have a headache" [laughing], Happy children and happy parents, I think, this is the charm of Tianyu!

When I checked in at the front desk, the staff of the Guest Relations Depar**ent kept chatting with my parents because they were afraid that the elderly would be bored. There were clowns in the lobby , Magic show, coax parents very happy. The park is picturesque, the lawn is lush, and there are rows of big-leaved terminalia trees for shade. After lunch, parents sit on the long rocking chairs on the lawn, blowing the sea breeze, listening to the sound of the waves and looking at the sea. It is very pleasant. There is also a park The cobblestone foot massage stone road is really considerate for the elderly who like to keep in good health. I like it [strong]. In the evening, I took my parents to experience the health-preserving essential oil massage in the hotel SPA center, and the parents gave a high evaluation. When eating in the restaurant, the service staff is also very enthusiastic to help the elderly run around, and enthusiastically recommend meals suitable for the elderly. The price is also relatively suitable, and the dishes are also suitable for the taste. Recommended [strong]. There are also a lot of parent-child activities in the hotel, which are uninterrupted every day. When passing by, you can feel that the children's response at the event site is very good, but it is a pity that this time the daughter has not had a holiday, so she did not experience it. I will bring my daughter again in the future Come.

The key point is that the price is right haha~ The environment in the hotel details is also very good. Check in and select the sea view room. Everything in the room is quite new and I am very satisfied. The hotel environment is very good, the scenery is also very beautiful, suitable for taking pictures, there are a lot of big leaf trees planted beside the hotel pool, which can shade the sun, don‚Äôt worry about the sun exposure, you can rest assured to play in the water. There are many swimming pools in the hotel, and there are also constant temperature swimming pools. I didn‚Äôt play because I was afraid, but my friends did. It‚Äôs really comfortable to play at the beach at sunset. Now the sea is not cold. The hotel is very close to the beach and a 5-minute walk. Next time you stay, bring your family to play and book a family room. There are many parent-child activities in the hotel, so my brother and sister-in-law must bring their children to play next time‚úå

Advantages: 1. I am very satisfied with the service. Wang Hong at the front desk is very patient and gave a good review. The hotel also sent a fruit basket, which is very considerate!
2. The Coconut Garden restaurant in the hotel had lunch for three consecutive days, and the taste was delicious! There is a children's package, and children like it!
3. The hotel's heated swimming pool is very suitable for babies, other swimming pools are also very clean, the park environment is beautiful, and the beach is amazing!
Disadvantages: 1. The hotel room facilities are old. I was not satisfied with the forest play room for two days.
2. Later, I booked a full sea view for 2 days, which was much better, and the room was more spacious, but in the tropics, small flying insects cannot be avoided, and the view outside the window is very pleasant.
3. The cleanliness of the room is not very meticulous, the room smells strong, and the higher floors will be better!
Suggestions: 1. It is recommended to put disposable bags on the trash cans in the room to make them cleaner!

Personally, I think Tianyu is the most cost-effective, the most popular, and the most suitable for bringing children. The scenery is fine. Haitang Bay is not as comfortable as Yalong Bay. Decided to stay in Tianyu for a while after refunding the air ticket, it is so easy to bring the baby. The environment seems to have come to Southeast Asia.
Check-in at the front desk is super friendly. Zhao Chenjun checked us in, he was very professional and comfortable. I have to give her a thumbs up!
If you want to say which part of this hotel is not perfect. Breakfast is average. But there are more than 100 people. You can have everything. After all, the prices outside are so expensive.
Children can't get enough of playing here all day for a few days. Parent-child hotels are still the first choice for Tianyu.

The room is also good, no smell.
Sanya is really off-season recently, and there are very few people. If you are playing water slides in the hotel, you can tell the little brother in the swimming pool and specially drive it for us. Only the two of us have fun.
There is also a cute pet paradise, haha. I saw a tour guide and a sister with a small pot friend, and I went over to rub it.
The housekeeper Xiaorong is very caring and answers all questions patiently.
Under the epidemic, the beach hotels in various scenic spots in Sanya seemed a little cold, and they also lamented the difficulty of the service industry, so I gave a big praise and went to play more during the off-season.

msg:I came to Tianyu for the first time ten years ago. At that time, Tianyu had not been transformed into a parent-child hotel. I remember that the most impressive thing was the beach, the swimming pool and the rocking chair.
Bring the children to Tianyu again, the beach is still soft and white, the rocking chair swing still faces the sea, and there are more parent-child projects after the transformation, such as Xiaoshuizhai water park, water slide, swimming pool basketball, circular pool, infinity pool, water sports It is colorful and very friendly to children, especially the 3 water slides are really fun. The old mother also used her strength to overcome her fear and played it several times.
There are rocking chairs, rocking beds and swings all over the place, as well as ropeways, climbing, small trains and other projects. The hotel also presented a light and shadow park and a pottery experience class, and experienced a bubble party and a cat pavilion at their own expense. The beach can also borrow sand digging tools for free, which is so intimate.
I like the style of Tianyu very much. It has a bit of Southeast Asian style. Although the lobby is not imposing, it is very down-to-earth and very popular. Passing through the lobby is the grass swimming pool and the sea is far away. It is very close to the sea. . The small hot pot by the sea is impressive, and the children prefer the performance between meals. There are three restaurants for breakfast that you can choose freely, and the dining table in one of the restaurants is made low for the convenience of the baby to take meals, which is very friendly. The pasta and papaya for breakfast was very good.
Tianyu is very close to Baihua Valley, just across from the door. After foraging for several meals, the children like KFC and Pizza Hut, and the old mother finally ate the Lingshui sour powder that she longed for.
Special thanks to Ya Xue and Li Rong from the guest depar**ent for their very thoughtful service, as well as a drop-off service and small gifts for children.
A very good trip to Sanya, it is recommended for families with children, it is a worthwhile trip.

The hotel provides airport pick-up service. The room we are in should be the closest room to the sea. The view is pleasant. These days It's a sunny day, and the color of the sea is very layered!

There are also many service staff by the pool, and they are well organized! The safety factor is very high! There are too many activities and projects in the hotel to play, and there are still many projects that we haven't had time to participate in before we leave the hotel! During the epidemic stage, there will be nucleic acid testing services from 15:00-16:00 every afternoon, which also saves the trouble of finding nucleic acid points! Four days and three nights are racing against time! The journey is very happy, and will come again next time! ps: Bring sun protection equipment + beach shoes! It is recommended to bring a variety of quick-drying clothes! Get out of the sea or the swimming pool, and the room can be dried quickly after taking a shower!

I especially praised Brother Clown and the young lady who hosted the pitching activities in the swimming pool. They were very conscientious and did not feel perfunctory.
However, there are still a few things that I think the hotel needs to improve, such as room hygiene, the glass in the children's room is not scratched, the hot water cup is not clean, etc., which are issues that need to be paid more attention to, but the waiter is also very humbly accepting suggestions and offered to deliver fruit in the afternoon. Services such as tea. The decoration in the room does not feel like a 5-star level, and the materials and materials are relatively rough, like some convenient hotels, the pillows are not very comfortable after sleeping for two nights, and the bedding can also be improved.
In general, the service (some of the catering service girls feel unfamiliar with the business and have a cold attitude, and experience is good), breakfast, and game facilities are all very good. I hope Tianyu will do better and better!
Suggestion: For dinner, you can go to the commercial street that is 5 minutes away from the opposite side, and you can eat the seaside hot pot buffet at the hotel once.

The activities are from morning to night, the entertainment is complete, various swimming pools, and children's facilities. The best part of Yalong Bay is that the waves are small and you can go to the sea, and the water is very clear. The only downside is that the hotel opened earlier, and the decoration is the pure wooden style of the past, so it is very old.

First, the quality control of the Chinese food ingredients in Caifeng Pavilion is absolutely fine.

The hotel does not have a swimming pool, which is also good. Suitable for children to play.

The room is okay, but the decoration materials are too low-grade. Basically, it is an aluminum panel on the wall and a plastic floor. It is a good thing to have a washing machine, which solves a major problem in travel. Special praise.

There is a food street in front of the hotel. You don't have to worry about eating, but it is expensive.

There is always aromatherapy in the corridor, which is especially good. Comfortable.

The whole is suitable for children under 8 years old, and they can travel by themselves. Big boy, I really don't know what to play.

1 The housekeeper service is in place. My housekeeper Wang Baiyu came to contact me on the day I checked in. He basically responded to all requests and made various arrangements. He had a very good attitude and was quite helpful!
2 There are a lot of parent-child activities, and the teachers are very attentive. Every morning, there are clown performances, stage performances, and various small science courses, which are very interactive. In such a hot weather, several teachers also wore heavy clothes to perform attentively. As a parent, I am very impressed!
3 Amu*****t facilities are sufficient, the playground is indeed very small, but other things are available and fun. My baby likes climbing frames, the small drifting in the children's water village in the first area and the children's water park in the second area. The water park can do it. To full shade, you can go into the water at noon.
The hotel does have some shortcomings. As most of the comments said, the hotel is old, but the children are really happy. There are other hotels with better facilities in Yalong Bay, but the children like Tianyu the most. The hotel is really good. I know children too well.

Service: This is really speechless, the check-in is messy, the little yellow duck bag in the package is not given, the parent-child map is not given, and there are no sand tools. Borrow, let customers buy! Because of the sudden increase in the number of customers during the summer vacation, a large number of interns were hired. I can't understand what I'm talking about. I push a luggage cart and hit the wall for a while, and then knock over the sweeper, but I'm convinced. Daily cleaning if you don't keep an eye on the manager of the day, you won't be able to wait for four o'clock to get your room cleaned.
Swimming pool: I come to Tianyu to take children to play in the shaded swimming pool. I will talk about maintenance and inspection by city leaders! Stayed for four days and the swimming pool was broken for three days! The fragility of this pool is also yyds!
Breakfast: Don't go to the VIP morning hall, there are many people and the room is small, and everything is lacking, so there is nothing you want! Morning tea is still good.
The good thing is that there are indeed many kinds of children to play! But every step of the way asks for money! 128 for an hour, 188 for a clay sculpture, and there is even a charge for the bubble war! 80 a person, adults also need to collect money! What night light stick activity 128 a person. Anyway, other hotels don't charge money here! Don't use it if you don't have money.
Restaurant: I have eaten at several restaurants, Caifeng Pavilion is not bad, rich and frugal! The seaside buffet was so hot that I didn't eat anything
Finally, thank Ctrip for solving the problem for us in the middle of the night and giving us full marks

When they can really play, they can only accommodate about ten children, but the hotel advertises itself as a parent-child hotel. There are too many children and it is very crowded.
Arrived at the hotel at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and asked me to wait for half an hour to get my room. The family next to me lost their temper after waiting, and the customer service arranged a VIP room for them to rest.
The food street across the road is very lively, but the restaurant tastes very bad, the price of the tourist area, the unauthentic taste.
The room may have been five stars a dozen years ago, but it is definitely not five stars now. There is no major problem, that is, there are many children, and the children's pool is too noisy. Some areas of the pool are not open.
The water in Yalong Bay is very clear, but the security will close the beach before 6 o'clock. Only play with sand.

msg:At that time, it was actually quite tangled when booking Tianyu. Many mothers complained about the poor hotel facilities and so on. Moreover, we stayed in Yanlord first and then Tianyu, and we were also worried about the big difference.
As a mother of Virgo, give a real evaluation of this hotel.
First of all, let‚Äôs talk about the advantages: Tianyu, as an old-fashioned parent-child hotel, has a large area and is divided into two areas: the first area and the second area. The second area is newer than the first area. There are really a lot of children's amu*****t facilities in the hotel, including light and shadow park, feeding small animals, six themed water play projects, etc., and there are many big trees in the water play area, so mothers don't have to worry about tanning.
Disadvantages: Because the hotel has been open for a long time, and the furniture is mahogany, it looks old, but I personally think it is acceptable. The second place is the hotel aisle carpet. This design was installed very early, so it shows the hotel's sense of age. The whole style of the third hotel belongs to the design elements of Southeast Asia. In addition, there are many plants in the hotel, so there are many mosquitoes. Every time I go downstairs to get takeaway, I always get bitten by mosquitoes. The room type description of the Fourth Hotel is a bit strange. I booked a sea view room, but in fact it only looks at the sea from the side, and I can only see a small part of it. I personally think that this type of room cannot be called a sea view room, which will mislead consumers. .

After arriving at the store, the front desk upgraded us to a deluxe sea view family room. The house is super large with two bedrooms, two living rooms and two bathrooms. Parents and children are very happy. Rest and entertainment do not disturb each other. The hotel's swimming pool is the favorite of children. There are 5 outdoor swimming pools. The scenery of the sea and sky in the infinity pool is really beautiful, and the children's water village makes the children endlessly happy. There are also cat pavilions, Linhai zoo and parent-child programs at different times throughout the day. It is like a small playground, and children will not get tired of playing in the hotel for two days.
We stayed for a total of two days and everyone was really reluctant to leave. Tianyu Hotel is really a family-friendly hotel with high cost performance. Highly recommendedüëçüèªüòÅ

There are swimming pools in the first and second areas of the hotel. It's over. The second area is 1.3 meters to 22:00, directly facing the sea and the hotel lawn. The environment is beautiful. I booked a sea view room in the first area. I can see the sea directly from the balcony. Folding drying racks, this is more user-friendly. The interior decoration of the hotels in the first district is not like a five-star hotel. The hotel is very close to Yalong Bay Tropical Paradise Forest Park. It costs about ten yuan to take a taxi. The hotel's breakfast is very rich and delicious. It is also very close to the beach. The hotel also gave a little yellow bag for refueling ducks for guests to put their room bracelets on, and they can also be used for taking pictures for children. I made an appoin**ent for a travel shoot in the hotel and took a photo of the box. The photographer is very good. I think it is very rare to look good. Got the 1888 package! When checking out, I made an appoin**ent with the hotel to drop off the airport in advance, and the welcome service of the handsome guy at the door of the hotel butler is also very good üëè

Tianyu wanted to bring children in the future when they didn't have children. They all said it was a parent-child hotel. This time it finally happened. I read other people's comments before saying that the room is old. The second-phase mountain view room I stayed in was only given to the second floor. It smelled very musty and the room was not big. It's possible that it's all in the family. There are plenty of activities every day. The first and second phases of the swimming pool are shaded by trees. You can come to play even at noon. Even the beach chairs are shaded by trees. There are also several slides in the swimming pool. The guard is very responsible. I saw with my own eyes a little treasure could not get up after going down the slide, and a lifeguard jumped in and lifted it up with lightning speed. Of course, there are also dull service staff, who are reluctant to give it as if they were questioned by a prisoner with a bath towel. There are also light and shadow centers, pet parks, climbing frames, video games, and some items charge a fee.
The breakfast in the second phase was very rich, but it didn't change the pattern. I gave up after eating it for two days. After that, my husband drove out and bought it at an early shop, which was cheap and delicious. We had three meals at Caifeng Pavilion for dinner, and the taste and price were acceptable. Coconut Garden is a little more expensive, and other houseboats have no experience outside. The other phase is opposite to Baihua Valley, and there are more choices for dining, which is really convenient and reliable. There is nothing to say about the location of Tianyu.

Service: The overall service is still very good. But the concierge who delivered the luggage on the first day didn't know which floor was on, and he didn't say sorry if he went wrong, so he felt quite unhappy. There are programs, performances, etc. to make children happy everywhere, and the paid rides (such as Bubble Party) are fun for adults. Erbao is more than 3 years old and a little scared, Dabao is almost 6 years old and is very happy ü•≥

msg:Tianyu Hotel is more old-fashioned parent-child hotel, and its location is very good. Although there was a typhoon in the past, the hotel has rich parent-child activities, and I don't think the hotel is boring at all. The children tried various swimming pools and water sports, and the best project was the blue sea and golden sand. The sand excavation project is never tired, and it is not fun. The hotel also has a pat box. At first, I only planned to take a few free pictures, but I took more than 80 pictures when the child entered the state. The background of the pictures is unique, and I liked them very much. Such photos are also rare, and the photo service is also very good. The only regret in the room is that the opposite room is being renovated, and the electric drill still rings at 8 o'clock in the morning after calling twice. The hotel has been renovated for such a long time of the epidemic, and the peak season will give us a bad experience. The housekeeper added WeChat and services before leaving, and the details of the hotel still need to be improved. Also, the hotel's breakfast is really bad. For a five-star hotel, the quality and quantity of breakfast are not good. It's messy. Coconut Garden morning tea is okay. In addition to the problem of breakfast and decoration, extra bed sleep is not bad, but the problem of dust mites caused by humidity is serious, and the child needs to take allergy medicine. Overall, we basically played in the hotel and had a happy vacation.

msg:I stayed in Tianyu for two days. I read a lot of reviews on Ctrip, and I also saw Tianyu‚Äôs manager refuting rumors below. I also hesitated, maybe it was deliberately black Tianyu, and many friends have been there and said that everything is good except for meals and accommodation. . But I can only talk about my personal experience. Generally speaking, the five-star hotels in Hainan are not high-grade, there are many items charged, and the waiters are uneven, but most of them are relatively average. We have been to Sanya five times and stayed there. I went to a lot of hotels, but the waiter of Tianyu saw people and ignored them, saying thank you and didn't respond. This is the feeling of service. The swimming pool in the second area is a children's playground. It is very fun to have a slide, but it cannot be regarded as a parent-child, because adults are standing and waiting for children, and there are stools next to them. There is no swimming ring, and the surrounding hotels will basically provide it for free. There are too many children, and they are crowded around. It is not suitable for couples or children above kindergarten. Finally, the most disturbing thing is that our second treasure slept for two nights and developed a rash for two nights. It rained for the past two days and excluded the sun. I didn‚Äôt eat seafood and only ate some basic bread and other foods to rule out food problems. As soon as we touched the bedding, the child had a rash all over, and we adults were slightly uncomfortable. The first night I lay in bed with the smell of mold in my nose. My child tickled before going to bed. I woke up at 2:40 in the middle of the night. I took allergy medicine with me. , The first night passed like this. After applying for a room change, the taste was only slightly improved, but the more serious thing was that the child had another night of trouble, from the neck to the legs, all the rice rashes, and ate dichloride before going to bed Lei was useless. The child scratched her back. She gave her a bath at two in the middle of the night and woke up at four. When she woke up, she was covered in Mimi. It's itchy, and it's very puzzling. After two nights, I was sleepy but not so worried. At least she won't have more serious problems because of the rash.
But it is fair to say that the hotel also has its advantages. There are many activities for children. Although it is messy, it is also more interesting.
Finally, I would like to thank Ctrip very much. From booking tickets to helping coordinate the hotel, I have always put the customer first. I am very moved. People feel respected in different places, and such a company will last for a long time. Thank you Ctrip for your help.

msg:I seldom write reviews, but this time I would like to share it sincerely. It is a very suitable hotel for parents and children. It is very friendly to children. The dry equipment won my heart. In addition, children&#39;s facilities and parent-child activities are also very rich. The parent-child photos of the box are also really good. If there is room for improvement, the room area is not large and the decoration is average, but it does not affect the experience. .

msg:I saw a blogger recommend Tianyu before, saying that it is an old-fashioned parent-child hotel, so I booked it for two nights with the mentality of trying it out, but I didn&#39;t expect to step on the thunder. Booked a family suite with a mini kitchenette, two bathrooms, a queen bed and a sofa bed. The moment I opened the door, I was disappointed. There was a big musty smell and the smell of old furniture. The decoration of the room can really be described as ancient (here weeping while hiding our face). I really don&#39;t want to complain about the sofa bed. It&#39;s not even as good as a rental room. It looks dirty, and I can&#39;t sit on the bed sheet. If you look closely, there is a lot of dust and debris on the ground, and you can see that the sanitation is in general. The refrigerator and washing machine in the mini kitchen are yellow and don&#39;t want to touch. What I also want to complain about is the electric mosquito-repellent incense liquid in the room. It is impossible to see whether it is on or off when the power is plugged in. The light is very hidden. The overall feeling of the bedding is not dry, the humidity is heavy, and it is uncomfortable to sleep. The child developed a rash after staying for one night, and then decided to switch to Intercontinental. Although it is an old-fashioned hotel, the maintenance of hardware facilities is really poor. Partners who like to stay in a new hotel should really think twice. It is commendable that the service of the hotel is still very good, the staff are warm and courteous, considerate and answer any questions. The location of the hotel is also very good. It is within walking distance to the public beach and the Baihuagu commercial street opposite, which is very convenient for those who do not rent a car. If the budget is sufficient, I would recommend a newer hotel.

It's not as good as here, just in terms of parent-child, it's more suitable for three-year-old children. So we continued to live properly. There are many parent-child activities here, and the most surprising thing is that you can go to the beach to catch crabs at night. There are really cute little transparent crabs, of course. After being caught, it was released. Then I have to do fluorescent hands or something, and arrange the child's life properly every day. Sister, the service of your little brother and sister is also very good, basically responsive. And the price of his house is also the most cost-effective among Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay hotels. In short, if you want to bring children, this is the place.

Because you have a baby, the bathtub is specially disinfected with 84. There are many activities in the hotel. If you stay for a few more days, you can let the older children go by themselves. Participating in activities, parents can be lazy and relax in their room or on the beach. The breakfast is also very rich. If you sleep in late, you don't have to eat lunch after eating. Children like it very much!
Disadvantages: The standard room we live in may be due to the continuous rain. There is a faint musty smell when the room comes in. I don't know if other rooms have this smell. If the balcony door is opened for ventilation, the air conditioner will not work.
In short, the children like it very much, five-star praise

Tianyu is especially suitable for parents and children. Before coming here, I stayed in a hotel in Dadonghai for three nights. I regret not booking all of them in Tianyu.
The hotel is very large, and the first area is being renovated. The room originally booked was changed to the second area, and the room type was upgraded.
The breakfast is very rich, and all kinds of Chinese food and Western dim sum are very rich. The fruit is first cut very fresh.
There are many large and small swimming pools in the park, and there are slides that children like. My daughter is very happy to play, and she has to go into the water every day.
The hotel has a children's playground, a small train, and small animals to feed. Going down is to go directly to the beach, the sand is very fine, much better than the beach in Dadonghai. There are free toys of various sizes and buckets and shovels for sand digging at the beach, so children don‚Äôt need to bring their own.
There is Baihua Valley nearby for dining, and it is not bad to eat several restaurants in three days. It‚Äôs enough to order Starbucks for takeout
It is worth mentioning that the service staff Bai Yu met when we left the store was very enthusiastic. He asked about our accommodation experience, took masks for the children, and gave small souvenirs. will come again next time

msg:From Haikou to Sanya to play, I originally planned to go to Haitang Bay, but due to the special period, I chose Yalong Bay Tianyu. I stayed in Tianyu with the mentality of trying it out. Let me talk about the feeling of staying for two days. The cost performance is very high.
The first service From check-in to the front desk, I feel that from the bellman to the waiter, the room waiter, the restaurant waiter, the quality is very high, enthusiastic, serious, and amiable
Especially the front desk manager He Yue'e, we booked a superior sea-view room in the second district for one night and found that the room was a little noisy. After reporting to the front desk, Manager He happened to be present and heard that I was not sleeping well and immediately resolved it, so that we could feel at ease for the next night. Get a good night's sleep and give a thumbs up to Manager He Yuee here. With such a responsible and dedicated employee, Tianyu will definitely get better and better!
Second, let‚Äôs talk about Tianyu separately from eating, living and playing.
1 Eat Although Tianyu is very close to the commercial street, we still choose to have breakfast at the hotel during special times. We can have two restaurants in our room. On the first day, we went to a restaurant where we can eat Cantonese morning tea. We have to say that it is very authentic Cantonese For morning tea, all kinds of porridge, dim sum, and pasta are all made fresh. The next day, I went to another restaurant. I was surprised that there were all kinds of freshly made raw porridge, freshly made sandwiches, children's butterfly noodles, fruit, and super delicious jackfruit in the evening at Coconut Garden Restaurant. Can do a variety of dishes, tastes really good, the price is not outrageous
2. Although Tianyu has been open for a long time, the software and hardware facilities in the room are very good. The rooms are all solid wood floors and furniture. The big bed is solid wood. It is super comfortable to sleep. There is a washing machine. The pots, bowls and kitchen utensils are readily available. You can cook by yourself. The balcony is super large and the shading effect is very good.
3. I personally feel that Biyat Renheng has done a good job in addition to the water sports and land projects. The equestrian cute pet park climbing frame and other children's activities are arranged in a variety of activities. Teachers will lead the children to play and live for two days. I didn't play enough to live for two days decisively
The little friends who can come out and play bring your baby to Tianyu. Tianyu is the best choice for you to come to Sanya. Believe me, I am not an adverti*****t or a hotel's drag Tianyu. I will come again. raise your salary

I arrived at the hotel at 1:00 pm and checked in immediately. The hotel room facilities are still very good. The bed of the big bed room is really super big and suitable for a family of three. It also deserves to be a parent-child hotel. There are many facilities for children to play. The most satisfying thing is that the seaside of the hotel is relatively close to the room. During the period, our family ate the buffet bbq dinner at the hotel and felt good and not cheap, but it was okay in the Yalong Bay tourist area and there were performances. The children were very happy. In short, it is a hotel suitable for bringing children to vacation. Finally, I would like to thank the hotel butler CoCo for its excellent service.

The shade and indoor heated swimming pool are plus points. Also gave small gifts to children. I live in District 1. As soon as the elevator comes up, there is an indescribable smell. I feel it is the smell of carpet. It is really not recommended to spread carpets in public areas. The hygiene of the house is not as bad as the Internet says, and the washing machine is not recommended. , I think it can be used for disinfection. When I took the clothes, I looked through them and washed them all. I don't know if there are insects or mosquitoes in the room. Because the first few hotels did not put mosquito coils, it was fine, so I didn't put them in. I I was bitten a few times, and the child bit a bag. I was too careless. I thought it would be fine one day, but it turned out to be that kind of bag with pus. I didn't expect it to be so poisonous.

msg:Coming to Tianyu is probably the most correct choice for this trip to Sanya. The room with full sea view in the second district has a balcony facing the sea. Children and the elderly like it very much.

It only takes two minutes to walk to the beach, and then you can dig sand, which is the children's favorite. There is no need to buy sand digging toys here. The hotel provides it for free, and you can return it after playing.

In the past few days, the weather was bad, and the outdoor swimming pool was too cold to go into the water. There is an indoor swimming pool in the second area with hot water, which can be considered as a dream for children to swim.

There is a Baihuagu commercial street near the hotel, where you can eat and play. You can also walk to the Yalong Bay Guest House, there is an undersea restaurant, the children can't hold back when they enter, they are so happy that they fly!

There is a small cute pet park in the hotel. Although there are not many animals, it is more than enough to "fool" the children, and you can also feed the animals yourself.

There is also a small train in the ring hotel, so to speak, whoever rides is happyüòÅ, get on the train behind the hotel lobby in the first area. It is very popular, and you must wait for the car to drive up and take a seat.

At night, all kinds of lights in the hotel will be turned on, and the children will run wild on the grass, which is really happy. There are also activities organized by the hotel every night, which are very rich and fun.

On the day before I left, the weather in Sanya was getting warmer, so I quickly went to the beach to take some photos, and the beautiful journey was over.

msg:The only thing I regret a little bit is that I stayed at this hotel for a short time this time. This time I came to Sanya, I stayed in a hotel in the city, I stayed in a B&B, and I stayed in Tianyu. Let me tell you my feelings, I didn't want to set Tianyu, because I saw Ctrip, I felt that the room area was a bit small, and I felt that it was a bit difficult to bring 2 children, but after reading the comments, they were all recommended, and I was entangled. Decided to have a 2-day experience, and found that a professional parent-child hotel does have a professional reason. In the 2 days, I have never left the hotel except for dinner. There are various activities for children and various parent-child amusement programs. There is no repetition from morning to night. The feeling after 2 days is that I have not played enough. The next time I checked out, I stayed at the hotel, ready to play until dinner. . . In addition to all kinds of fun amusement facilities, the room is also worthy of praise. Although it is indeed not as big as other five-star hotels, the optional cribs, baby toilets, and children's dental appliances all reflect the parent-child hotel. profession. All service staff will greet each other kindly when they meet in the corridor, and every time they call room service, they will be very timely. What was particularly impressive was that when I was leaving the hotel and checking out, I was pushing a trolley and pulling my luggage up and down from the elevator. A passing staff member came up to help me push my luggage away. Yes, all kinds of service details are full of praise. Last but not least, when checking out, because of the queue at the front desk, Li Rong, the guest depar**ent, took the initiative to ask. Perfect. This trip is not over yet, so I plan to plan the itinerary in July this year. For the next trip, I will definitely use Tianyu as the only accommodation arrangement.

üçÉEnvironment: The location is super good, the second district is three minutes to Baihua Valley, and it is very convenient to eat. This is an important reason for taking children to choose Tianyu.
This time it is three small and two small rooms. The elegant family rooms are selected. The rooms are more spacious and comfortable.
Secondly, the activities are very rich. It is enough to play in the hotel every day without leaving the hotel. There are also some small animals that children are more interested in.

üîîService: The service is very timely, and the children also gave birthday cakes on their birthdays. The mineral water in the house is refilled in a timely manner and the amount is large, unlike some hotels that send two or three bottles of water for half a day.

üßπHygiene: Not bad.
Before reading the reviews, many people said that the facilities are outdated. The facts are really old but acceptable. After so many years, think about the volatilization of formaldehyde.
There is a "photo box" in District 1 and District 2. After making an appoin**ent in advance, take an hour to take a parent-child photo. The original film is very beautiful without intensive editing, and the photos are all very satisfied and packed away!

msg:This year, I stayed in Tianyu for the first time. I chose the 360-square-meter Royal Pool Suite. The room is on the top of the building and faces the sea directly, with a private swimming pool. The decoration is a little old, and the color of the sofa also feels a little old, Hawaiian style. But the room environment is really good. took a lot of photos.
The reason for giving five-star praise is because of a manager named Lin Shaozhen. Her service is really caring and professional.
1. If there is anything that the hotel does not understand and needs, she will help coordinate the first time.
2. The private room on the second floor of the sea-view restaurant for me not only prepared extra gifts for the children, but also provided very delicious and reasonable meals. (There is only one private room, which needs to be booked in advance, and there is a minimum consumption. However, the service and environment should be considered relatively advanced in Yalong Bay.) The self-service hot pot in the boat-shaped house, because the child has an online class, we only arrived at 8:15, and Manager Lin also Arranged to put the bottom of the pot, small ingredients and drinks on the table in advance. Be considerate.
3. When checking out, we also coordinate and arrange relevant staff to provide storage bags and help them put them in the car.
4. After checking out and leaving, my wife's bag was left at the hotel. She learned that I was staying in other places nearby, so she drove the leftovers to me as soon as possible. Very caring.
Therefore, I strongly recommend that two friends also stay in Tianyu, and at the same time, they also ordered rice (the scenery is really good).
Of course, is there a problem with the hotel? There are also some, in contrast, the service of the rest of the staff is not so professional. The decoration of the room is a little old, but it does not affect the overall situation.
There are a lot of things to play with the children and they have a lot of fun.
1. Needless to say, the water park is great, and there are many safety guards.
2. There is also a cat pavilion for cute cats. More than 20 cute cats of different breeds, as well as long-haired rabbits, chinchillas and more. My kids go to pet cats every day.
3. There is also a horse riding place in the second district, and the staff in charge of horse riding are also very warm and friendly.
4. We also took time to make some ceramics in a ceramics-making place in the hotel, and professional service staff helped children and adults to complete.
The food at Yeyuan Restaurant is also reasonably priced and tastes good. In fact, you don't even have to go out to eat.
Rarely come up to comment and see Manager Lin's warm and sunny smile. Decided to come up and compliment it. Hope to be able to help other friends who are staying.

msg:I don‚Äôt want to post pictures. It‚Äôs true that many short videos are now recommending this hotel, saying that it is very suitable for family vacations. The back room card can't open the door. Fortunately, the waiter asked me to call the concierge, and then I waited in the corridor for ten minutes to open the door. After entering, the first impression was old, not bad, 90s style It is said that it was renovated in 2015, but in fact, it has not been installed. The TV cabinet is like the cabinet of Che Chiguo in the 86 edition of Journey to the West, the cabinet where Taoist priests changed to monks, there is garbage on the beach, and the sound of the air conditioner in the room is very loud, which affects sleep. Like the parent-child hotel that everyone thinks, it is strongly not recommended!

Hotel There is also a self-contained travel camera called Paipai Box, which is very good. There are many private photographers on the beach. The price is basically 10 yuan for a photo. It seems cheap and easy to be tempted, but the effect of the shot Compared with the Paipai Box, there is still a big gap, and the Paipai Box has a package, and 599 has more than 100 negatives, so everyone must keep their eyes open when choosing. In short, the happiest part of this stay is the children, as expected Old-fashioned family hotel.

Not only I and my family have been here several times, but I also recommend it to all my friends who plan to travel to Sanya with children, none of them. I am very satisfied with this trip. What needs special praise is that when you booked the room, you booked a superior sea view room in the second district. Because I have lived in a luxury sea view room before, there is no concept that the superior sea view room is a lower floor. It was found that the outside is facing the room on the side of the Mangrove Hotel and the sun is bad at night. Contact the front desk to request a room change. The first time to upgrade the luxurious sea view room facing the pool garden for free, to the little brother who did not pay attention to the name at the front desk of the second district. Click a big like. Of course, next time you come, you will definitely book a deluxe sea view room or a full sea view room, so you don't have to add to the front desk of the hotel.

msg:Ctrip ranks Hainan's second parent-child hotel, which is indeed worthy of its name. Due to the epidemic, the number of guests staying in is really much smaller than before, and rooms in a district are closed. The original 6-7 large and small restaurants are now only open to the outside world, so the software strength of the hotel is more reflected at this moment.
It was Manager Xiao Jingchuan at the time of the reservation. When she learned that her son was 6th birthday, she was very considerate to help upgrade the room, and arranged a birthday cake. The next day, to dry the clothes, she found sister Xiao again. She was very enthusiastic to receive her. Solved, but we are also very satisfied with her service attitude and give it a five-star.
Due to the avoidance of summer vacation and the epidemic situation, the entire hotel has fewer guests, but the experience is better. There is no need to line up for any activities, meals, registration, etc. The children are very happy to play. Every day I go to the beach, to the infinity pool, to the water village, to the Yubaobao video game city. My son also played a jet ski for the first time. It was too exciting.
The breakfast is also quite hearty. It is served in the VIP club on the second floor. There are not many varieties, but both Chinese and Western flavors are good.
Generally speaking, the hardware of Tianyu Hotel is not a strong point, especially the room decoration is relatively old and old, but in terms of parent-child attraction, we have stayed in 4-5 five-star hotels in Sanya, and Tianyu must rank first.

The decoration style of the room is too ugly, it is better to be fast The decoration of the hotel, but some details are still well done, there are washing machines, drying racks, and children also have separate toiletries. In fact, the important reason for choosing Tianyu again is that the swimming pool in the second area is covered by trees and there are slides. The biggest feeling this time is that the staff are not enthusiastic, and most of them show their faces. This is not like a parent-child hotel. It feels much worse than when I came three years ago, and the service is far worse than Hilton and Clubmed.

Tianyu, as a parent-child wine, has many activities for children. Daily activities can be arranged from morning to evening. Each activity has small gifts and many small details are well done. For example, there will be a private bathroom for children by the pool. At night, all kinds of colored lights are on the lawn.

msg:I first booked the Yalong Bay Guest House for five days and upgraded the lake view room. It is really super satisfying, new, beautiful lake view, super good service, I also give children toothbrushes, as well as folding crabs and snails on the bed for babies to see. The bed was super comfortable, the TV was new and big, and the room was so big that I was really satisfied with it. The four elderly people were full of praise. I wanted to continue my stay, but because the temperature in this season is not suitable for cold water swimming, the heated swimming pool only has a constant temperature for the children's pool. This is a flaw, but next summer I am still willing to stay in the guesthouse, which is really good. You can eat breakfast while watching tropical fish. The baby is super happy. The children have arranged many activities, and the babies are small and participate less. Insufficient places. In addition to the heated swimming pool, there is only a children‚Äôs pool. There is also a place for children to play. Socks are charged for another five yuan, and the socks for adults are not non-slip, because it is not safe for adults to hold children in case of slipping, and the other is very small. The children of Japan are not very suitable for this slide. The slide is too long and suitable for children over three or four years old. Babies over one year old have less things to play, but there are a lot of coin-operated play at their own expense. The above are all the good things and some shortcomings of the guesthouse. Changed to Tianyu in the last few days. I thought the price was more expensive, it would be at least good, maybe because the basic room was ordered, but I refused to upgrade for free. For the room on the second floor, the overall attitude of the service staff was relatively bad, much worse than that of the guesthouse. Let me talk about the advantages of Tianyu. The beach is beautiful, there are many swimming pools, and there are many constant temperature swimming pools. This day, the bubbles are more comfortable. The infinity pool is good for photography and well equipped. The facilities for babies to play are suitable for children. If they happen to meet them, they will also have snacks and fruits. Children's non-slip socks and adult non-slip dolls are free to use. These are better facilities for children to play, suitable for children of all sizes. The activity is arranged well, although I only participated once, I gave up when I was planning to participate in the second time and it was not suitable for children. The overall a**osphere, well-equipped facilities. The tree by the sea is very beautiful. The sea view is beautiful and clean. Insufficiency except that the attitude of the service staff is much worse than that of the Guest Hotel. What makes the room sad is that the price is much higher than that of the Guest Hotel, and the room is really up to three-star standard. When I entered the room, there was a big smell of paint. The decoration was obviously old. I really didn't understand why such a big smell. I didn't mind if I could live for a few days. I can only say that I will stay for two nights. I really feel wronged, and I won't choose him next time. There are a lot of choices for this price. I turned it around and found that MGM‚Äôs exterior looks pretty good, but I‚Äôm not sure about the details. My colleague said that the hotel in Haitang Bay has been updated, so I‚Äôll try it next time. One more complaint. On the day of Tianyu, I made two calls and said that we can give us a room at three o'clock. To be honest, there is no room upgrade. I turned to the front desk again to find out that there was a room, and I was able to live in advance. I had known that I would check in so late, so I had a good time at the Guest House before coming over. In addition, look at the small train taken by other tourists. On the morning of the check-in on the 16th, the small train was finally stopped. The drivers came and said that they would not stop on the way, and the charge was 50 yuan, the attitude was so bad, and I was free. Don't want to sit down. All in all, at Tianyu, I am really wronging the adults themselves, letting children play with these facilities, and it is more convenient to play on the private beach by the sea. The so-called pick-up and drop-off does not start at 9 o'clock in the morning, so we only have our own APP to order an earlier paid airport drop-off. The whole trip was not so comfortable and pleasant because it ended in Tianyu, and even the old people complained that the guesthouse was not as good as the guesthouse in all aspects.

msg:Thanks to the waiter Li Xiaolan. I left the Apple wireless phone in the room when I checked out. She picked it up and handed it to the front desk. The hotel promised to express it back to me. Thank you very much! Great!
üöó Transportation: Very convenient.
üßπSanitation: The room is indeed a bit old, Nanyang style. There is nothing unsanitary, it is old, after all, it has been for many years. Those who are particularly concerned about the new and old rooms and furnishings should look at the pictures more or lower their expectations.
üçÉEnvironment: The beach is very good. The happiest part of us this time is the beach üèñÔ∏è; the hotel is full of olive trees, covered in shades, shade is very good, there are on the beach, lying underneath is much more comfortable than umbrellas. It just falls out of bugs. I was bitten by a red ant and it hurts. But it was a very low probability event, and it was nothing but pain at the time.
But to be honest, the flower wall of the hotel lobby and the 12 zodiac paper lanterns on the lawn are indeed a bit of a drop in price. I saw a comment saying that "large farmhouse" was shown to me. It can be seen that the original design of the hotel is still tasteful, at least Not bad at the time. Now I don‚Äôt know why it didn‚Äôt improve but fell...
üîîService: The design of the hotel hand ring card is great. You don't have to worry about the card when you go out. I haven't picked it up after staying for 4 nights. Too friendly to my kind of lost mother. Room service is also good. The bottled water was delivered quickly, and several bottles were generously provided.
Breakfast was ok, at least during my stay.
There are refrigerators, washing machines, and microwave ovens in the room. Although they are old, they can all be used. Swimming in the sand every day, a washing machine is too convenient.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about parent-child activities. The hotel organized some parent-child activities and we didn‚Äôt participate much. After watching the clown show, there was no interest in others. Everything we played at the end was charged, and the price was not cheap. This is the part that disappoints us.
Overall it is pleasant. Thanks again to the hotel for picking up money!

There are many kinds of parent-child activities. Unexpectedly, there is pottery. The child is reluctant to leave. The boss is very enthusiastic. He accompanies us to chat and introduce local specialties and food. There are teachers who are very patient to teach the drawing, and there are teachers outside to guide the children how to decorate and paint. The children who usually can't sit still become very quiet and focused in front of the mud. It takes about two hours for the child to see that the muddy mud is turned into a beautiful work. It is a very meaningful process to receive the work 15 days later. Bringing children to live in Tianyu has dynamics, statics and beautiful scenery, it is recommended!

 The location of this hotel is very good. It is very close to the busiest commercial street in Yalong Bay and can be reached on foot. It is a little farther to enter and exit from the second district.
 
 There are many parent-child projects, and the projects arranged every day are different. Arrange the children clearly from morning to night, and go to the corresponding location to participate in the activities according to the timetable given by the check-in. The slides in the children‚Äôs pool are fun, and both adults and children have fun.

 There is a photo box next to the lobby on the first floor. Guests who stay in can make an appoin**ent to take photos for free and give 5 free negatives. The photographer has good skills and is very patient, and is very good at guiding children. The effect of the photo is quite satisfactory~ It is still very good to have a record of travel.

The washing machine is filled with washing powder, and it feels like it is not wiped or cleaned. Then there are service and hygiene issues. It is the first time to clean the room. We only wiped the water on the ground and the sheets were not cleaned. We made 4 calls on the same day, but no one took care of it. Then the trash can in Figure 2 is tidy up. The ashtray is not washed, and the trash can is all It‚Äôs yogurt. When we went out, we put in our own garbage bags. We didn‚Äôt expect that after we came back, it was even more dirty than when we went out. The waiter said that they don‚Äôt have garbage bags in the trash can. I gave a few to me. The room service seems to be an intern. Everyone feels passive, service and attitude are very poor. No one responded to the cleaning of the room until the third day of our stay, and came forward.

It was difficult to change my booking or I went. As a result, the plane took off and arrived on time. Then it is forecasted that the weather will be thunderstorms for a week, and the compass typhoon will also make landfall in Hainan. As a result, the rainy and windy days ended in one day and one night. The rest of the time was the sun, and the final return journey was also on time. If you have children, this hotel is simply fun. It‚Äôs all activities from Monday to Sunday. A child in the store will send a bag. Both swimming pools have children‚Äôs areas, so you can change to play.

Children‚Äôs pool slides have many water facilities, and entertainment activities for children of different ages are arranged at different times of the day.

There are disinfectants in the elevator and the epidemic prevention is also done very well. The hotel is divided into one and two districts, which are about the same distance from the swimming pool and the beach. The beaches of Yalong Bay are the most suitable for taking children into the sea. The rich breakfast is especially suitable for children, and there are also prepared children's tableware. I also booked a photo shoot in the box on the first floor of the hotel. The photographer was very professional and captured the real seascape in my eyes. The old man's hand card was not found, and the front desk also comforted the old man. We were very touched.

msg:When I first went there, I didn't rent a portable trolley. I was dissatisfied with all kinds of Tianyu. After living for four days, I found it was really convenient! ! ! Lightweight and hygienic strollers, washing machines, electric towel rails, and cribs are really saviors! His goodness is really more obvious after I lived in the Sheraton Haitang Bay behind me. Tianyu is really child-centered in everything! This is the first time for my husband to take our 2-year-old twin male baby out for a trip. Once or twice a day, the whole family will throw in the washing machine and take a bath. It‚Äôs not too convenient for the family‚Äôs bathing suits to have a meal, or to dry on a heated towel rack. Rubbing clothes is too much energy! It is more suitable for a 2-year-old baby to play in the low-school swimming pool in the second zone. The water slides fly up. Although the facilities are a bit old, the children are not caring at all. It is a paradise! Going out and crossing the road is Baihua Valley. The new Hainan restaurant in it is quite appetizing to our Hunanese. Children's light dishes. We have Sichuan and Hunan dishes! If you are tired of eating, go to Shiwei Restaurant and change your taste. Either Pizza Hut pasta and beef pizza is also very exciting. Hey Tea is in the nearby square. Take a walk every day after dinner for a drink! Go to the beach at night to watch the glow sticks and climb the ladder. This is a charge of 150 yuan per child. We are too young to take a look. The teacher will also give a few glow sticks to play for a while. Great! The first time I went to Hainan, I didn't go to any Internet celebrity attractions. I spent four or five days in the hotel. At night, you can see small sand crabs near the beach chairs. Take the kids and catch the sand crabs. They are super obedient and follow around looking for crabs. When they find it, they immediately unscrew the cap of the mineral water bottle to pick it up. The experience is really rich! The most amazing thing this time was the free photo box given by the hotel. I had to hold 5 free photos if I didn't want to hold it. The result was amazing. It is super suitable for parents who don't have time to take photos with their babies! Compared with the 2-year-old photo teacher I took in the professional photo studio in the mainland, he is more able to tease the children. It is natural to call Mr. Xiaohui very patient. The two babies took us around the hotel and went to the seaside swimming pool. ! Seeing the photos, I immediately paid for more than a thousand packages, all the negatives were given away, and I was very willing! After changing to the Sheraton Haitang Bay, the contrast is too obvious. The facilities are not convenient! In the future, I will brush the sky domain for the second time! Highly recommend a fresh room with a washing machine and heated towel rail

msg:I came to Tianyu for the first time after getting married in 2003. After 18 years of absence, I moved in with my two children during the November holiday. I felt cordial and warm. The hotel has been successfully transformed into a parent-child hotel, which is a paradise for children. The front desk, guest room, restaurant, cleaning and other service staff are warm and thoughtful, and every greeting can be felt from the heart. The second phase of the elegant family room was very comfortable. The bed was fully enough, two large and two small, one extra-large bed, one single bed was enough, and the sofa bed was not opened. One bedroom and one living room are spacious, and the balcony has a view of the mountains and the sea, which is very good. Children's supplies range from slippers, bathrobes to toiletries, and they are carefully equipped with pedals. For breakfast, you can choose from three restaurants. I didn't feel crowded at 8.9 o'clock, and the order was very good. The food was also good. Opposite the first phase is Baihua Valley, which is convenient for eating and shopping. The hotel has an airport shuttle bus, you can make an appoin**ent in advance, it feels better than taking a taxi. Because the children are relatively young, I would like to thank the hotel for the late check-out time during the eleventh peak. The concierge Xiaozheng is attentive, especially thanks to Tianyu‚Äôs many swimming pools, both in the first and second phases, which are very suitable for children and water amusement facilities. The children like it very much, and there are trees in most places, so there is no pressure to go out during the day. This time I was very satisfied with the 4-night stay, and I will bring my children.

msg:Really unexpectedly invincible satisfaction! Tianyu is indeed a parent-child hotel! I stayed for 4 days, all convenient and very happy~
1. Booked a hotel pick-up in advance, it is a carpooling minibus. When I arrived at the airport, I waited in the parking lot. There were not many people, and the air-conditioning effect was good.
2. For the check-in in the first area, the sister at the front desk of the hotel is very nice and upgraded the room in the second area for free, as shown in the picture. It's really not old, I am very satisfied with the room, all convenient facilities are complete, children's bathrobes and slippers, and stairs for washing hands. The air conditioning effect is also very good.
The two beds in the twin room are huge together, so it's perfect for us to sleep with our children.
The hot water temperature in the room is very good, there is no need to adjust the cold water, the child washes just right.
The toilet flushing is so quiet, and the child is not afraid to disturb her when he goes to the toilet at night.
The sound insulation effect is average, but they are all with children and go to bed early, so it‚Äôs so quiet every night~
3. Breakfast. It can be said to be extremely rich. The variety will be changed every day, and the hotel will replenish it in time after eating. The waiter will bring seats and baby chairs for breakfast with so many people. It's really good!
4. Swimming pool. With various shaded trees, you can play in the water in the sun during the day~ The children have fun on the hotel slides.
5. There are parent-child activities in the hotel, many children are very happy together
6. The train is free~
7. There are small animals in the hotel (pigs, goats, ostriches, peacocks, fish, rabbits, etc.). My child shouts every day to see, but I like it
8. It's not far from District One to District Two. It's actually very fast to walk around and get familiar with it.
9. The first area lobby is Baihuagu Commercial Street, where you can eat all kinds of food. It's not expensive, every meal is changed to a restaurant, and all kinds of food are available. There is also an open-air playground next to the commercial street, trains and electric toy cars, merry-go-round trampolines. My cub goes to jump on the trampoline every day...
10. The most important thing is the beach of Yalong Bay. I have been to the Dadonghai in Sanya a few times. The first time I came to Yalong Bay, it was so beautiful and so beautiful! ! The sand is fine and the beach is long, which is really very suitable for children to play. I go to dig sand every evening
Going to Tianyu in the off-season is really invincible. ! !

After hesitating between Tianyu and MGM, they still chose Tianyu. Facts It proves that there is no wrong choice at all. The price/performance ratio is too high. Tianyu is very suitable for children under 6 years old. For children, Tianyu is actually more impressive in children‚Äôs hearts because there are too many items that children can play. As for the service and accommodation conditions, it is definitely not comparable to Yanlord, but the price is not the same. Tianyu's local brand, the service is as close to the people as the price [Âë≤Áâô], as for the hygiene, I think the room type of the Royal Club of BYAT is good, Yate It‚Äôs hard to say a word about the hygiene of the tianyu. Anyway, I have insomnia all night. There is a musty smell in the Tianyu room. It is indeed because of the age, but this is also better than the water pipe. It is very easy to accumulate. Water, but I think the price of Ctrip 539 per night is also negligible.
All in all, parent-child travel is highly recommended [ÊÜ®Á¨ë]

msg:The overall is great, and I have decided to continue coming next year.
It is especially suitable for bringing a baby. There are many activities to play. There are activities every morning and afternoon, singing, dancing, playing, playing games, and hosting. Swimming pools with children, slides, water villages, small loudspeakers, sand, zip lines, swings, lanterns, zoos, climbing frames, and small trains are not necessarily enough for three days. Also give a little yellow duck bag. I‚Äôve seen some rankings before and I don‚Äôt understand that Atlantis is ranked No. 1 in Sanya‚Äôs parent-child hotel. I also went to live there. The comparison between the two is obviously that Tianyu is more suitable for babies, and Atlantis is actually suitable for young people. Regardless of the supporting facilities, the aquarium water world swimming pool, the baby can play is very limited, but it is suitable for young people and Internet celebrities to take pictures and film. And the price is too expensive, everything is sold at more than three times the market price.
Speaking of Tianyu, there is a special area on the beach, with deck chairs, free toys, and an area in the sea to play, there are lifeguards, and there are many photo shooters on the beach. I heard that it seems to be 10 yuan per 100 yuan 20 There is no limit to 200 photos, but we don‚Äôt edit the photos directly for the electronic version. We took the one at the hotel and gave us five photos for free, and it‚Äôs okay. The water in Yalong Bay is relatively shallow, so you can walk in it for a long time without reaching the waist. The fried chicken is suitable for floating. There is no wind and the waves are not big, once the wind is very troublesome, the waves are not allowed to go into the sea.
The buffet breakfast is very average, with a wide variety of dishes but not many hard dishes. The hardest is probably the boiled shrimps. Anyway, they are full but not of good quality.
It is estimated that some facilities are outdated after being opened for too long. The refrigerator was not hot on the first day and the TV could not be turned on after the refrigerator was ready on the second day. In the end, it was said that the socket was not well connected. The toilet is a bit difficult to flush, and it is not blocked, but it has to be flushed many times.
I was very dissatisfied with the check-in at the front desk of the first district on the first day. I waited for half an hour. Is it so slow? Then it was said that the battery car took us to the second area, and the welcoming people couldn't see the welcoming people finally had to walk over, but there was someone at the entrance of the second area lobby.
The swimming pool is probably not finished because of the epidemic. The first district only opened the water village and the second district opened the endless, ring and children‚Äôs slides. My baby played on the slides for two days and I didn‚Äôt have enough.
There are several restaurants in the hotel. They are not expensive and taste okay. There is a commercial street directly opposite the lobby of the first district, where you can eat a lot.
The hotel has a pick-up and drop-off, but it is scheduled

Seeing your sincere smiles, it is correct for us to choose to come to Tianyu every year. Tianyu is really the best for parent-child activities. Other hotels charge children to take care of them. Only you are free, and the activities are rich and varied. Children have to participate in activities every day. When they go to other hotels, they yell every day to return. Tianyu. These are all true love in exchange for sincere dedication. There is also SPA that people have to praise. When I came last year, a friend recommended it. This year we can‚Äôt wait to do it. It‚Äôs really super comfortable and relaxing. The technique and service quality are really great. It is worth recommending. We did it twice in a row. Second-rate.

msg:If you bring your children to Sanya, you have to play in hotels. Check-in at attractions is only suitable for adults. Children are too troubled when visiting attractions, tired and hot, and children are not interested, so choosing a good parent-child hotel is a must. Kids in Tianyu There is so much to play, all kinds of parent-child activities, children are full of fun, and adults are also relaxing. There are children's exclusive toiletries, bathrobes and slippers, and the sterilizing underwear soap is quite easy to use. My favorite is the heating drying rack. The clothes and towels can be dried in a while, which is very convenient. The 1.5-meter-deep heated swimming pool is better, with large shades of trees on it, and the water is warm without swimming. The water in the children‚Äôs pool with a slide is too cold, and the child‚Äôs mouth turns purple after playing for a while. The slope of the beach is too large and the sand is not fine, not as good as the beach on the Coconut Dream Corridor. Hotel breakfast is more expensive, it is better to directly choose the set meal with breakfast. Generally speaking, it is the best parent-child hotel in Yalong Bay.

There are also a lot of taps for washing feet and so on. I experienced lawn barbecue buffet. There is also a young lady from Xiao Yaxue who listened patiently to our opinions.

We went through the procedures for early check-out, and because of the epidemic, we left early and did not experience the fishing hot pot that can be eaten by the sea.

Just a 5-minute walk from the hotel to Baihua Square, you will find everything you need to eat and drink. The hotel has ground and underground parking lots which are very convenient. The shortcoming is that all the trash cans in the room have no trash bags. I personally feel unhygienic. Then there are white ants who told the customer service that night. Although they will deal with it the next day, there is no following. Hope the store can give feedback in time next time. Overall, it is good. Good value for money

1. It is preferred to stay in the second zone, close to the water park, convenient for changing clothes. Invincible lawn, zip line, net celebrity swing, everything is available.
2. Whether in the corridor or outdoors, the service staff take the initiative to stop and say hello, which is very rare. Towels dried outdoors can be taken on the go.
3. Invincible water park, four water slides, my son said he would play for 100 days. The key is to have a few water races every day and drink coconuts for free for two days.
4. Diving pool 4 meters deep brings surprises. As a middle-aged person, I actually recall the feeling of diving from a high platform.
5. The bubble tea in the lobby is highly recommended. I feel that the serving little sisters and the boss have a grudge, the amount of pearls added makes you feel that the milk tea is simply superfluous, and it's so delicious! My son doesn't want milk tea, just pearls.
6. Say the important thing again! You must travel to shoot if you have time! ! ! We walked to the photo box in the lobby of the first district. A local photographer from Hainan helped us to take more than 90 photos under the scorching sun. It felt like a blockbuster! The key is that a little girl from Inner Mongolia who patted the box gave us a refined photo. These photos are fond memories of our trip to Tianyu!

Great, I was so happy after staying for a week. During the epidemic period, everyone went abroad to play less. Basic vacations were also to Sanya, which caused the increase in hotels in Sanya. This is the reason why we gave up Haitang Bay this time. I chose the right one. It‚Äôs really good. The recommendation index for taking kids to play is full.

In the end, I chose Tianyu. I didn't expect it to be a surprise! The room is set for the second zone with full sea view. The room facilities are not as old as some people commented. They are clean and tidy, like a big hotel. The originally arranged room smelled of musty, so I contacted the front desk and quickly changed the room. I live in 5218, there is no taste at all, the balcony has invincible sea view, don't be too cool! I heard people say that there are bugs, so I specifically asked for a high floor. I live on the fifth floor. There are no mosquitoes at all. My baby has a physique for mosquitoes. I didn‚Äôt expect to stay in Sanya for a few days without getting bitten in a bag. I don‚Äôt know if it is repellent. The mosquito measures are well done, haha. As for the poor service that many people mentioned, the luggage from the concierge was born to help unload the luggage and lead the way when we got off the bus. Although it‚Äôs true that there is no smile on our faces, we do our best and respond to all requests. In the past, all kinds of requests made on the phone were very enthusiastic responses and solutions. The aunt who cleaned the room was grinning and easy-going. We had a lot of things these days. We needed a breast warmer later, another room was changed, and another time was added. Slippers, a baby toilet later, and a fruit knife later, are all delivered quickly, so I think I can give at least nine points for the service. The key point is that the baby is having a lot of fun. The most talked about every day is to go out to play and not to go home. This trip left a very good impression, and I will definitely live in Tianyu next time I go to Sanya. To talk about the shortcomings, well, the summer vacation is actually so expensive.

The Tianyu Hotel has a children‚Äôs entertainment area, a water sports area, a shopping area, and four different restaurants for eating to meet various tastes. There are also many options for breakfast. Western-style Chinese and morning tea, the service staff in the store are very responsible and enthusiastic. The hotel is directly opposite Baihua Valley. It is a very satisfying parent-child hotel. The front desk staff Huang Yanfei and Xiaowei are warm and polite, and will help if you have any questions. We actively solve it, it's great!

My mother broke her foot, and the wheelchair and doctor came to the door immediately. Will stay next time.

msg:An old parent-child hotel in Yalong Bay-Tianyu. Opposite the hotel is Baihuagu Commercial Street, so you don't need to take a taxi to find food. Fortunately, I have upgraded my room type + late check-out, a fresh twin room with washing machine, smart toilet + towel drying rack + balcony, finally I don't need to wash my clothes three times a day. A personal butler will contact you on the night of check-in. The hotel focuses on parent-child, swimming pools, water parks, cute pet areas, and entertainment facilities for children on the shore. Because my baby only needs to soak in water, I didn't sign up for any hotel activities. You don't need to bring the towels and bathrobes in the room, because there is a towel table in picture ‚ë¶ next to the swimming pool. There are shading cloths on the pool, because the sun is too strong, and there are enough deck chairs on the shore. Picture ‚ë® is the hotel room card, so don‚Äôt be afraid to take it away. Coco, the butler of the Guest Relations Depar**ent, Rong. The service attitude is super good. If you have any requests, you can send WeChat directly to the butler. He also gave my son a small gift when checking out

The hotel is adjacent to Baihua Valley Commercial Street, it is very convenient to eat and drink, coconut chicken is very delicious, Hey Tea, Starbucks also have it. The hotel's breakfast buffet is quite rich, and there are prawns, which is very refreshing. The swimming pool is divided into a paddling pool with water slides and a heated swimming pool. The slides in the paddling pool have small slides suitable for young children, and slides suitable for older children to slide down in a rowing boat. In addition, the climbing facilities are also very distinctive, and other hotels do not. It is a pity that the waves are too big to swim in the sea, but it is still fun to play in the sand and water.

The sanitation, facilities and services are all satisfied, because the main focus is on parents and children. There are so many activities to participate in. Since we only stayed for three nights, we didn't have time to participate in many activities. Tianyu has an independent beach, and there are free sanding tools to borrow. The beach is very clean and the sand is very fine. The dinner seafood buffet is rich in Jingmei activities. The seafood is super fresh, and the barbecue buffet dishes are slightly less, but it is also very fun to watch the show and eat barbecue on the lawn. The overall feeling is that there are no mosquitoes nor bitten by insects. Overall, I am very satisfied, and I will choose Tianyu in the future.

These five days of free travel, the whole journey of relaxation. The reflection of the sky is the most profound. Here, you can stroll on the beach in the morning to start a day of leisure. After having breakfast in the Cantonese-style morning tea, take a break and take the dolls to participate in various activities in the hotel. After a simple meal at noon, you can lie down on the lounge chair in the corridor and have a rest, feeling facing the sea. In the afternoon, take the dolls to the hotel swimming pool to swim and play. After swimming, go back to the room and rest for a while. At this time, dinner time almost begins. After dinner, the sun has set, but the sky is still very bright. At this time, the dolls are digging on the beach. The happiest moment for the dolls is this. After introducing the hotel's activities, I also need to introduce the hotel's services. The most thankful person here is the housekeeper Xiao Yaxue. During the two days of our stay, she was responsible for the whole process and recommended many parent-child activities in the hotel, which was especially considerate. If you come to Sanya again next time, what choice do you need? Bring the children to Tianyu directly.

In fact, what I look forward to is parent-child activities and facilities. After I came, the receptionist Zhao Chenjun was very enthusiastic and the service was very attentive. He upgraded us to the superior sea view room for free, and there was a free bus to the airport. Ask the baby what activities he wants to play to satisfy the baby and actively arrange it. The baby is so happy, I feel so lucky to meet such a nice person. The hotel facilities are a bit old, but the parent-child a**osphere is very strong, full of various activities, there is a swimming pool for children, and it is very close to the beach. It is really suitable for parents and children, but also suitable for the elderly. The breakfast is very rich, and the baby eats a lot. In the end, the check-out was very fast. Rong Rong helped to handle the check-out. It was very fast, very enthusiastic, and very considerate to give us small gifts. The child was very happy. In short, Tianyu‚Äôs service staff is a highlight, making you feel like you will still live in Tianyu next time on vacation! good!

It is very suitable for children to play. You can go directly to the beach in the hotel. Next to the hotel is a small commercial street. You can take out or eat out. Convenience.

The interior decoration of the room looks old and not modern, but there is no problem in using it. We stayed in a children's room in Zone 2 this time. There is a small tent in the room with picture books, etc. The children will be a little interested.

The hotel breakfast is not particularly rich, but I think the fried food is surprisingly good, especially the French fries, which is very delicious. That is, there are more diners.

The trees in the hotel are well built, just like natural parasols.

Because I bought a group purchase package, which includes a boat-shaped coconut chicken hot pot, it is really the most unpalatable hot pot I have ever eaten in my life, there is no one.

There is no charge for the small water village, which is okay. The hotel is basically a family with children, there are many children, like a big playground. Also, the room is really aging and can't keep up with the times. The room is small, the toilet is very small, and there is no separation of dry and wet. It is particularly inconvenient to stand in the bathtub when taking a bath. However, it is enough for the children to have fun, and the room facilities are indeed a little bit different from the current five-star hotels.

The beauty who sang asked if any kids would like to perform on stage, and then I persuaded my sister to go on stage to play the piano (our sister is very shy, timid, coercive and courageous before she is willing to perform on stage. )... But when we raised our hands, the singing beauty asked us, are you also pianos? After answering yes, a very disgusting expression appeared immediately, let us wait! ! ! After waiting for a long time, my sister was very disappointed! We are also disappointed! Let me choose next time, I think I will never choose this hotel again! Another point is that when we checked in on the same day, it was said that the duty-free bus should be reserved in advance. As a result, we arrived at the waiting area on time. A large group of people who did not make a reservation got on the bus, but the person who made our reservation has been waiting under the sun! Excuse me, what is the effect of reservation?
