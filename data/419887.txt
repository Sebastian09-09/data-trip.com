He make the experience special and always available to support even when he is during non-working hours

I’ll for sure stay here again and it is always my choice when I want to stay close to Guangzhou airport. Very close to the airport with shuttle buses service every 30 minutes for T2. And, T1 is just in the back side of the hotel.

Cleanliness was great, no doubt about that. Service & facilities were great as well. Breakfast was very good, Chinese style, Western style and Japanese style.

Overall, worth the money and you will like it.

However, the attitude of the chef during breakfast at the noodle station was disappointing, barking at us when placing an order as if the customer disturbed him by ordering food. Definitely not five star service. Will try another hotel next time.

msg:The overall experience starting from the shuttle service all the way to the reception and room service were great. This is my second time staying in this hotel. But nothing had change over the year. You can tell that the room was old and definitely will do a lot better with some upgrades. The hair dryer was old and not serving its purpose. The rain shower head was spoiled and you cannot imagine why would you have the alternate shower head pointing directly towards the shower glass door. Water leaking through the glass door causing the entire toilet floor wet. The TV needed to be upgraded too. One good thing to mention, despite the flooring being carpeted, it did not smell bad at all like some other hotels would along the corridor or our room. 

Location wise, think it is great for those who intend to stay in the hotel just to relax and use its facility like the swimming pool and spa just for a night to transit as it is within wall distance to T1 and just a 5 min shuttle ride to T2. Shuttle service is every 30min. But if you do intend to head to city area, then you will have to take a taxi ride of about 40-50min to town which cost us about 90rmb. 

Kudos to the concierge team, the receptionists and the housekeeping team. They were all polite and very keen to help.  

Overall, we did had a great time at the hotel.

msg:Pros: The location is a walking distance from the airport Terminal 1 (South Airport).   It provides a free shuttle every 30 minutes to Terminal 2 (North Airport).
          You can take Line 3 Metro (subway), and walk two floors up and walk out to the hotel in about 4-7 minutes.   The breakfast selection is better than Sheraton in Tianhe, Guangzhou.
Cons: As far as the room, I felt like staying at a 3-star+ hotel.   Usually, in a 5-star hotel, they provide shower caps, combs, sewing kits, and toothbrushes.  Here, they handed two toothbrushes at the front desk.  That's all.  I gave 3+ (plus) because it provides the bathrobes and slippers.  The shower door does not close.  Therefore, a lot of water leaks outside the shower.   The safe deposit box's lock does not work.

However Pullman Guangzhou Hotel did not drop the service standard during the pandemic period. The Guest Experience Manager Mr Wang Yang called me one day before my arrival. He was very patient to explain the current Guangzhou pandemic circumstance and reminded us to do covid test before arrival. Due to my friend will fly to overseas at Guangzhou airport therefore we had a lot luggages. Mr WangYang arranged the airport pick up service and he personally came to pick me up was really surprising me at B4 Gate of Terminal 1.That is really convenient and we don't have to carry luggage to walk long way at airport to Hotel. Check in was very fast due to Mr WangYang assigned the room before arrival and he delivered our luggage through cart to our room.
Hotel is big and lobby looks luxury, room is spotless and super quiet so we can have a  good sleep . Breakfast is not bad also althrough not allowed to dining in.

msg:Third time stayed and will again do so, but please make sure you understand about the bus from terminal 2 as they changed and the bus doesn’t show Pullman Hotel anywhere, so I had to wait almost an hour (at midnight) until a lady helped me. Also the breakfast is from 5:30 not 5:00 as used to be so I booked room with breakfast that I never used, instead the front desk provide me with a yogurt and orange and few breads (not what I expected) rather than that if it wasn’t for the missunderstanding of the bus to the hotel I could have had few hours more sleep. But I total recommend the hotel for their service cleanliness and convenient location to the airport!

msg:this hotel is horrible.

1)  transportation to the hotel is only once every half hour.  no location advantage.   

2)  rooms have no windows that open.  there is no way the hotel can freshen the rooms.   they reek of sour sanitizer.  they need to buy some ozone machines so the rooms don't stink

the only good thing is the service people.  they try to help in a very bad situation

3)   after 8pm only one dining choice.   noodles are 125rmb  coke is 38rmb.   

I love the Pullman brand but this hotel is not well thought out

I will never book here again.

Bathroom equally big and well stocked with toiletries. Room service fast and efficient, the beef burger was very good and am sure that applies to the rest of the menu.
When I checked out I asked for a taxi, a few minutes later it arrived. Overall a most enjoyable stay in a very impressive hotel.

The person who did checking for me didn't explain about the hotel, but my first time was everything taken care by the personnel. The floor of the bathroom was not really clean. And the breakfast looks better that it taste. This morning was barely any juice for example and the food was quite cold. Now it is quite convenient if you fly in the morning early as you are literary minutes away. If you stay please choose exwcutive room that's my advice!

Hotel is as I remember from staying there numerous times many years ago and I feel I was in almost the same room as then - just know it's like a rabbit warren and one can get lost very easily so take care - call for concierge to collect you when you leave! :) Otherwise, all good for a stop-over between flights as it was.

msg:Reception staff (day and night) were welcoming upon arrival and  quick to resolve disturbance caused by other guests at night respectively. Aside from this positive,  given the cost and international brand, the stay was disappointing. While the room was well supplied with usual amenities, it was very small for one person - a couple would arguably be uncomfortable - and the bathroom was ridiculously tiny. Restaurant (U8) staff were polite, helpful, and attentive;,however, the evening buffet (RMB 198) was poor on variety and quality for the price. It was surprising that while the location of the hotel is stated as being within walking distance to the airport, this is somewhat deceiving as guests cannot access the terminals directly because the hotel is actually located outside - specifically between the two terminals, which means a shuttle bus must be taken to reach your terminal. It should be mentioned that again, the staff responsible for the shuttle bus service were excellent. All in all, this is a hotel that is supported by wonderful staff - nevertheless, it is one that I could not recommend because higher quality for the price  is expected from a recognised world class brand.

The bug is that the executive building is a bit too far away, dragging the suitcase has to walk a long way, and you have to change elevators.
Although the executive lounge has a "happy hour", there are only very simple snacks, which cannot be taken by yourself, which is a pity.
The breakfast is great. I originally planned to just have a couple of bites to catch the plane, but I couldn't bear to leave.

When I was having breakfast, the waiter checked my room card on the computer repeatedly like a thief, and I felt that my room card was stolen. I was dressed casually, not wearing a suit and tie. If you don't have a foreign face, you can't stay in the executive room, and you have to check your card repeatedly. Do you look like a **? The shower in your room is small and half of the holes don't water. You have the nerve to charge such a high room rate for the executive room. It is not comparable to hotels like Yazhi and White Swan! Their ordinary rooms are many times better than yours. I won't stay here again!

The waiter told me, "serve by seat, if you don't ask, it won't be served." After working for half an hour, three foreigners came in, looked at the empty plates on the induction cooker and the thin drinks, and left after sitting for less than 10 minutes. Blindly reducing costs and increasing efficiency will not bring about the development of new quality productivity! !

As a result, I can't open the room in the west wing with the east wing room card, and the waiter is still rude. When I checked out the next day, I waited in line and watched the front desk issue invoices to others. The restaurant on the second floor was very considerate. I ordered a wonton noodles, but was reminded that it was "alkaline water noodles" and asked if I was used to eating it, so I could change it to braised noodles. The housekeeping service is good.

Fortunately, the hotel pick-up ended at 2 o'clock. At 1:05, I got my luggage and went to Gate 46 on the third floor to wait for the bus. The bus departed at 1:15 and arrived at the hotel smoothly. The bus people were very enthusiastic and helped me carry my luggage. After arriving at the hotel, I quickly processed the room card login information and went back to the room with my children to rest.
The next morning I postponed my check-out and transferred to another place. The front desk staff was very enthusiastic and asked me what flight I was on. She helped me check. The flight I booked in advance was at T2, but I didn’t expect it to be changed to T1 after checking. It was really helpful for me. I checked it directly at T2. It is very convenient to go up the escalator in the lobby and take your luggage out of the other entrance on the third floor. T1 is opposite. It saves time and saves a lot of trouble. I am very satisfied. The breakfast is so rich that I can’t eat anymore😆
  I sincerely say that apart from the decoration feeling old, I am very satisfied with everything else.

The 6-hour room rate is slightly more expensive, but still affordable. The large bed room in Building 2 that I was given at the beginning seemed smaller than what Ctrip posted online. The front desk was pretty good. Upon request, I was changed to a twin room in Building 1, which was much bigger. The room was clean and tidy, and the bed was comfortable.

msg:The hotel is relatively new. You don’t need to swipe your room card to reach the floor. The facilities are very consistent with the age of the hotel. What I need to complain about is that we, two mothers with two children and three luggage, walked across from the airport to check in. There were obviously staff who saw us, but there was no waiter to help us carry our luggage. It is considered a relatively high-end airport hotel, and it did not reflect the hospitality it should have! In addition, children over 6 years old need to pay for breakfast separately, and they are told that drinks in the refrigerator need to be paid for additionally when checking out. In other hotels, you can drink for free. It feels like the hotel’s rules are still ten years ago! As the last night of our trip to Guangzhou, the check-in experience is the worst. If you need to catch a flight, it is recommended to stay at the Novotel next door. The price is cheaper, the accommodation is the same, and the decoration is new.

msg:1. The so-called free shuttle bus to and from the airport has to be waited for every half an hour. If you are in a hurry, you don’t need it at T1. You have to call a bus yourself to go to T2. The hotel's shuttle bus operation model is too formalistic and tasteless. It would be better not to.
2. The front desk clerk, whether checking in or checking out, kept a straight face and stiff tone throughout the whole process. It felt like the front desk did not welcome guests to check in.
3. The room the front desk gave me actually had other people living in it, so outrageous! Fortunately, the manager on duty came immediately to help me move to another room and upgrade to a suite. Such an outrageous mistake greatly damaged my impression of the Pullman hotel brand. For such a large hotel to have such a problem, it is obviously not the personal problem of the front desk and duty manager.
4. Because I had to catch the earliest flight, I asked the hotel to pack breakfast for me and put it at the front desk. When I got on the plane and opened it, the bread inside was as hard as a rock. The surface of the apple was still rotten and there was no label on it. Please tell me. Are the standards of Accor hotels so low? I can't even eat a bite.
5. The taste of the food delivered in the guest room is also very average. The fries and sandwiches both give people the feeling of pre-packaged food. At 158 ​​per serving, the selling price is not cheap at all.
The service level of the staff is very mixed, the room service is very polite, the concierge in the lobby feels like a temporary person is hired to make up the decorations, and the service quality at the front desk is not as good as the level of the whole season. Even though the hotel's supporting facilities seem to be richer than those around the airport, many of them are not useful for travelers who want to catch a flight. The hotel should pay more attention to how to improve the guest experience. Overall, I feel Unless absolutely necessary, it is difficult to consider staying in this hotel again next time.

The one within walking distance of the airport is the timing lounge and the other is Pullman. Cross the road at Gate 13 on the departure floor, and then walk through a wind and rain corridor to the hotel. After entering, go down the stairs to the lobby. I booked a double room, and I was pleasantly surprised to get a suite. It is very comfortable, with a reasonable layout and considerate service. It is very suitable for tired people to take a good rest here.

msg:It can be said that it has no merit except being close. It is one of the worst five-star hotels I have ever stayed in. If you can't avoid it, stay as far away as possible.
I dragged my child out of the car and waited at the door for two minutes. No one helped me with my luggage. The flight attendant of the airline dragged several pieces of luggage by herself and they were all stuck in the turnstile. No one came to help. The concierge watched you all the way. , will not provide you with any service.

The house facilities are old, the decoration smells, and the smell is moldy. It is difficult to believe that this is a five-star hotel.
It's very close to the airport, but the shuttle bus takes half an hour. We went out at 10.02pm and were told that we would have to wait until 10.30 for the next bus. Fortunately, there happened to be a taxi driver at the door to take us there, otherwise the flight would have been delayed.

In the end, we were charged 300 yuan. (Less than a kilometer, driving time is less than 2 minutes). Of course, I also understand the matter of charging money, but is the charge of 300 reasonable (this is still the result of bargaining, it was 500 at the beginning).

msg:The plane in the early morning chose to stay at the Pullman Hotel, which is very close to the airport, and you can walk to T1 on foot. When I checked in, I chose to upgrade to an executive room. The food during happy hour is relatively rich, and you can also print the itinerary in the lounge, which is very convenient. The staff in the lounge are very warm and caring, especially Cherish and Kitty, thank you for their thoughtful service, give me a thumbs up👍

Finally, a little girl came, without a word of apology. I walked in front silently, myself Dragging my luggage, I was speechless. When I arrived at the hotel, I wanted to order dinner, and the response of the food delivery service made me see a new world.

As soon as you enter the hotel, there is a faint aroma, a strong festive a**osphere, and the room is big and clean, making you feel at home!
The most important thing is that it is really close to the airport T1. When the plane arrives at 9:00 in the morning, you can eat a buffet before dragging your luggage to check-in. The weekend breakfast is particularly rich, and the egg tarts are super delicious!

I think it’s because I really like this hotel and its super big bed, which is neither soft nor hard, just right, which makes me feel like going home and lying on my own bed I feel that when I go out, I always suffer from insomnia because I am not used to the bed, but this time, it is the first time that I feel that this bed is so comfortable. Originally, I was unable to go home due to flight problems, so I planned to spend one night here. However, because I was very comfortable in the hotel, I only stayed for three days. I also took this opportunity to go shopping in Guangzhou. I really like the warm scent and well-trained staff upon entering the hotel, who are very polite and warm. Thank you for sticking to your posts during the Chinese New Year.

msg:I arrived at three o'clock in the morning, and the room couldn't be opened. The concierge brother was very good. After running twice, I finally changed the room. I was too tired at night and didn't take a shower. I dragged my tired body to take a shower in the morning, but found that there was no toothbrush. I called and asked for a toothbrush. The waiter said that we didn't deserve a toothbrush. He was full of confidence, and I was a humble mess. More than a thousand in exchange for the result is so humble. I have long hair, and I was about to wash my hair only to find out that this hotel not only has no toothbrush, but also didn't leave me with a piece of soap on the sink. So, I called again to ask for a comb, but the comb didn't come for a long time, so I called again~ At this time, I was burdened, because I also paid the price of a five-star hotel, this is the hotel It's a high-end budget hotel with no services, so it's a prudent choice for a five-star hotel. "I am on a business trip and settled in early in the morning, the toothbrush that may break down is the one"

msg:Frankly speaking, in addition to the good service attitude and the geographical location does have a monopoly advantage, other aspects are not worth the price. The facilities are slightly outdated, the room is full of bugs, there is only a USB socket on one side of the bed, there is no power supply, and there is no USB on the other side, so charging is extremely inconvenient. Without a master switch, the light cannot be turned off at one time. The rain shower head in the bathroom can be taken off, the angle that can only be adjusted in height but cannot be adjusted, and the direct-injection glass can be hung, but the button on the top of the head cannot be pressed, and the shower can only be held by hand... The most unsatisfactory is when you check in, next to the toilet in the bathroom There was still soot from the cigarette butts that had not been cleaned up. I remembered to go out for nucleic acid testing in the middle, and I called room service twice, saying that they would come to clean it, but I came back two hours later and still did not deal with it, and called for a third time. Came and said I didn't pay attention. On this morning flight, the actual check-in time at the hotel was 12 hours. As a result, the hygiene was delayed for so long. There was no solution except to say sorry. All in all, it cannot be said that the stay experience is particularly satisfactory.

As soon as I entered the room, there was a smell of body odor that made people want to vomit. Yes, it was body odor, and the smoke could not stand. I had no choice but to call the front desk where no one answered, and finally got through and asked to change the room. As a result, the waiter came up and changed it to the one facing the road. I was a little speechless, so I had to ask to change to the one facing the atrium. First, hygiene issues, can a room with this smell be a clean room? Second, the service problem, the front desk that can't get through. Unprofessional service.

They force guests to wear masks during breakfast, saying that he is afraid of the sun, but our guests are not afraid of the sun. Acrimonious and arrogant, almost speechless, as a five-star hotel, there are such people serving the guests, and the Pullman brand has messed them up.

Staying at the Pullman Hotel at the airport has become the first choice of course. All aspects and services of the hotel are still the same as before. This time, I feel that the passenger flow is a bit less after the domestic liberalization, and Pullman is still good.

It is also a breakfast restaurant), a pasta + a Indonesian fried rice, 326 yuan is too expensive, this is obviously a one-time business. The deluxe twin room of 959 yuan a night only has one breakfast, and the other one needs to be paid for. The lady at the front desk said that on Ctrip, you can add one yuan to order two breakfasts.

Early flight the next day, the hotel is a 5-minute drive from T2, and there is a special car for pick-up and drop-off.
Check-in experience:
The advantages, the service is in place, the lady saw that my friend's legs were inconvenient, and immediately arranged to upgrade the room, and chose the nearest elevator, which was very in place.
Check-in at the front desk is simple and fast.

It can't be said to be a disadvantage, but I would like to make a small suggestion for personal stay:
1. The shower is too hot to hold
2. The socket on the side of the bed is blocked by the back of the bed, and the plug cannot be inserted
3. Disposable slipper bottom slip
4. The telescopic arm of the makeup mirror is too short. I don't know how others use it. Anyway, it is not friendly to my 158-tall girl.

I took the third picture because I read the comments that their equipment was old and fell off. Anyway, the facilities in the room I lived in were intact. Overall pretty good

1. The temperature of the air conditioner is not controlled.
2. The room has closed windows, plus the first point is very stuffy and uncomfortable.
3. The matching is very poor, and there is no choice to eat and buy.

The only bright spot is that it is close to the airport and the bed is huge.

The room was upgraded to a suite, but I just came and went, so it's hard to make too many comments. Soundproofing is good.

There was a wake-up call at 4:30, and the front desk even left a breakfast for me.

You can go there from the ground floor (the 3rd floor of the departure hall is connected by a covered bridge, and it is closed during the epidemic). After crossing the road, take an upward slope to the hotel, and also pass through the Golden Mile nucleic acid testing point, which can be exited. English report, convenient to go abroad.
The hotel has complete facilities and can print color nucleic acid test reports in the lobby. Western restaurants are open for business, and gyms and swimming pools are open.
There is a shuttle bus to T2 every 30 minutes.
In short, it is the first choice for travel in Guangzhou.
Special thanks to the guest manager Mr. Wang Yang for his thoughtful help, providing room upgrades and helping with late check-out, thank you!

msg:I have lived in the worst five-star hotel, and I feel that all the equipment is old equipment and decoration 20 years ago. Only the lobby is well decorated as the door face, and the house feels like a guest house. There is no charging head on the side of the bed. The phone is shown in the picture, and the hair dryer is similar. It will take 10 minutes to dry. The bed is really small, my friend is 1.7 meters, and my feet are close to the bed. The service is also very poor, only official business affairs are done, and there is no thoughtful service. It takes about 5 minutes to get to T2 by bus, but it also takes half an hour. When I checked in the previous day, I asked about the bus situation and didn't say how many times there are. I thought that the distance would be such a short distance, so I asked the front desk in the morning. In the room reserved by Ctrip, the invoice can only be issued by Ctrip. I asked the front desk if I could make two. I don’t know if the attitude is very bad. 🤷‍♀️Find Ctrip by myself.

Due to the epidemic, my plane was cancelled and I felt irritable. After staying at Pullman, I gradually felt that the rest was relieved. The buffet at night was much better than I thought. I ate wildly when I didn't pay attention.
The staff are very warm and friendly, and you can feel sincerity from the tone of their conversations with the guests.
The beds and beddings in the guest rooms are very comfortable, especially the long latex pillows, which made me sleep so well for the first time during this business trip. I really praised it and got fans.

The second is that the pillows are very large and small, which is very suitable for sleeping surrounded by pillows, especially there are two large latex whole heads, which are very comfortable. The third is sound insulation. It is a real cow. I never thought that I could not hear the sound of a plane at all. It would be easy to fall asleep without getting on the alarm clock. Fourth, the hotel is very large, and the garden is also very large, but unfortunately the epidemic does not dare to wander around, and there is not so much time to catch a plane. Good experience will live again.

msg:Due to the early flight the next day, I chose the Pullman Hotel at the airport. Very good check-in experience, the room was upgraded to a suite, and there was a beautiful young lady picking up the airport on arrival, and it felt so good. In fact, it is relatively convenient at the airport. There is a subway for travel, and you can eat and drink. However, it usually takes an hour to deliver food. Fortunately, the hotel’s characteristic Pullman pizza can be delivered to the room, full of seafood and cheese, which can’t be finished by one person, so I had to eat all the tops and leave the noodles. Taking into account the early flight, the hotel thoughtfully advances the breakfast time to 5:00. To T2, you can take a shuttle bus every half an hour, and it will be there in 5 minutes. It only takes 5 minutes for the T1 trip, which should be the most convenient transit hotel in Baiyun Airport. With a photo of the night view of T1, the hotel room has a great view. Although it is right next to the airport, the noise of planes taking off and landing is completely inaudible.

msg:I booked this Pullman hotel next to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport because I had to transfer the next day for convenience, and I was greatly surprised! The hardware facilities and services of this hotel are all five-star! Especially the service is really heartwarming! Due to the epidemic and other reasons, I arrived at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport at half past midnight last night. The pick-up master arranged by the hotel called me in advance and was waiting at the airport. He took the initiative to help me carry my luggage and introduced me to various hotel services.
I went to check out as usual at 2 o’clock in the afternoon the next day. The lobby manager Lucia learned that my flight took off at 9 o’clock that night. She was considerate and took the initiative to renew the room for me for free for half a day, and thoughtfully let me rest. Only checked out that evening and sent me to the airport.
I want to go shopping at the airport at noon. When I leave the hotel, the waiter at the gate actively reminds me to bring my ID card. I don’t think I need an ID card to board the plane? So dubiously, he went back to the room and fetched the result. When he entered the airport, he had to show his ID card, otherwise he would not be allowed to enter.
There are many star-rated hotels with good hardware, but whether it can win a good reputation depends on high-quality and considerate service. Through the quality and service attitude of the staff, the management level of the hotel can be appreciated. The Pullman Guangzhou Baiyun Airport is worthy of five stars. Level this title and level! Like the hotel management and all employees! I will continue to choose his home when I travel to Guangzhou in the future!

The room equipment and facilities are not up to date, but they are well maintained. Too suitable for transit stay. I think, even if it is not a connecting flight, if the transportation is convenient, I will try to stay in Pullman again if I come to Guangzhou again. This is the charm of service.

The hair dryer is the style of ten years ago, the wind is too small and too difficult to use. The weight scale is also a style 10 years ago. It is recommended to update it.

因為今天乘機時間比較長，所以，提前一天入住酒店，希望休息好點，提前給酒店打了電話，到酒店前台告知免費升級豪華雙床房，結果去到房間很大的異味。於是打電話希望換房間，結果前後等了20分鐘，換了房間。
晚上在健身房運動後，去洗澡沒有熱水，也沒有工作人員，想去乾濕蒸都沒有打開，自己開了幹蒸等待温度逐漸上來，才看到工作人員告訴她沒有熱水，她去打開水龍頭説放放才可以熱，一會兒告訴我熱了，你沖不沖？這邊幹蒸温度剛上來，所以我説等等吧，她接著説，這樣一直放着熱水？無奈，全程感覺自己打擾了這位工作人員，不應該出現在這裏.

床品一流，能睡得香甜，隔音好，不會被吵到！
服務有引導員帶到房間，太大了，不會走！

現在説好的。客房和前台態度好，迅速派人解決了花灑問題。並在修理空調無果後免費升級到行政套房+延遲到下午三點退房。距離機場很近，步行十分鐘。酒店大門有外賣櫃，不用擔心外賣被偷哈哈

msg:服務：5分給到酒店大堂的工作人員，很熱情友好

服務： 3分給到禮賓部接電話的工作人員，不算有效解決地下停車場行至酒店大堂的指引問題，雖然這個鍋也許是酒店規劃人員的，但禮賓部也沒起到引導作用。辦理入住前的體驗非常非常差。

服務：1分給到客房清潔人員，落下電動牙刷和定粧噴霧，也沒有聯繫住客詢問是需要回去取或郵寄或棄置。

設施：建議需要在酒店停車並辦理入住的朋友停在地面停車場，如果已經入住有房卡的朋友可以考慮地下停車場，停車場是酒店住客也需要收費的。

地下停車場對需要辦理入住的客人非常不友好，地下停車場的電梯上並不是酒店前台，而是宴會廳。
地下停車場體驗總結是晚上十一點需要自己抹黑從行政樓側門出去找酒店大堂，如果想去地下取車，麻煩從地下停車場出入口走斜坡下去，因為這個時候行政樓電梯在一樓是打不開的🙃

具體事情經過很有趣🙂晚上十一點左右從地下停車場上到一樓發現不是前台，也沒有指引去前台辦理入住的方向，電梯雖然是停在一樓，但也不再按得開了，完全卡在一樓宴會廳門口上不去也下不去。聯繫前台後，前台電話告知地下停車場的電梯不通往酒店大堂，往上的樓層是需要刷房卡上去的客房，可以給我轉接禮賓部，禮賓部派人去接宴會廳我。聯繫上禮賓部後，並沒有派人來接，對於我提出的需要工作人員來接的需求完全無視，而是電話指導。工作人員讓我從側門出去，但側面所有的門上分明貼着“此門已鎖”的紙。經嘗試發現，側門確實沒有鎖，但門前有個往外向下的斜坡，斜坡限制了開門的幅度，衹剛好人和小行李箱通過。從側門出去後工作人員還指引了錯誤的方向，和我説出門左轉走到地面停車場，但明明右轉才是，左邊黑漆漆。事實説明靠人不如靠自己，還是自己找路吧。
因為從下車到酒店大堂就已經很不方便了，擔心第二天趕飛機的時候取車不方便，就想回去把車開到地面停車場，禮賓部説衹能從地下停車場出入口走斜坡下去，這個斜坡也不是人車分流的，此時非常慶幸我手上拿的是登機箱，要是28寸的箱子，怕是要被箱子拖着下樓。

因為是家庭出遊，預訂了兩間，有一小童需要加床，入住當天給了非常大的驚喜，不僅免費升級了房型，而且一開房門時加床已經提前安排好，並贈送了小童早餐。兩間訂房也幫安排好了相鄰房間。
因為體驗經理王陽的細心安排，極高的提升本次入住的體感，感受到了人文軟服務為酒店硬件帶來的質的提升。非常感謝。

酒店的位置很好，距離機場最近的酒店了。
酒店的環境讓人很舒適，一進門就覺得大氣不失設計感。酒店處處都很乾凈，寬敞明亮。

👩🏻酒店服務:
我帶着孩子下車，禮賓就很快幫我拿行李，並且拿着行李一直陪着我辦入住，又送我進房間把行李放好，禮賓的小夥子們真的很棒。
前台姑娘們的服務也超好，很有親和力，看我帶着孩子立刻給我升級了行政大床房，説這樣有利於寶寶睡眠，環境相對安靜些。很温暖很貼心的服務，讓人很感動。
酒店房間:
房間很大，洗浴房很寬敞並且和衞生間乾濕分離，很舒適。洗手池枱麪很大，女士們的化粧品有足夠的位置擺放。大浴缸泡澡超級棒，孩子很喜歡。房間衞生也做的很細緻。
感謝禮賓部小夥子Alleo（英文名字實在沒記清楚 大概是這幾個字母😅😅😅）我退房要準備坐大巴車去機場了，突然想起來我把孩子的葯品遺留在房間，這位禮賓部的小夥子百米沖刺的速度跑步到房間給我去拿葯，真的很感謝。
 選擇鉑爾曼 一定不會錯！

第一，約了4點飛機，僅僅晚了兩分鐘，也沒有人溝通就直接不等了，而且説下班衹能半小時，這個鐘點到哪裡找車去客運大樓。這樣的服務很差。
第二，房間沒有窗，空調進房間就打開了而且設了25度，床上的還有個羽絨被子，不去看根本不知道開了這麼熱，結果根本睡不了。
總之體驗很差，這個酒店性價比很低，不推薦去。

酒店的服務質量非常貼心，前台的Yuttie温柔體貼，由於本人睡覺很輕，一直擔心睡在機場附近回睡不好覺，Yuttie不但幫我安排了非常安靜的房間，還免費幫我升級到了行政樓層房間，更感動的是，在詢問了我的下一程航班是在第二天晚上時，還幫我免費延遲退房，讓我在房間得到充分的休息，非常感謝Yuttie，謝謝酒店全體服務人員，下次一定還來。
