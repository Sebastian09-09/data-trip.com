msg:We had a fantastic stay at the hotel. The staff are incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make our stay extra special. A big thanks to Royce, Qiao, Scarlet and Nina for making us feel so welcome and providing us with all the information we needed for our trip. The 17th floor housekeeper, Xiang xiao e, made our room super clean and felt just like being at home. The hotel is conveniently located and there is a metro station right next door. It is very easy to get to all the attractions. I highly recommend having breakfast at the hotel. There's a huge variety of food to choose from and the signature hot dry spicy noodles are delicious.

Breakfast was also great with a large spread. This was probably a nicer Ritz than others that I have tried in China. Will definitely stay again when I come to Xian.

My room (Club King) included free use of the executive lounge, which had food and coffee and cocktails available all day. Lavanya at the executive lounge was very kind and welcoming.

It's a good hotel that doesn't need any explanation.In front of the hotel, in the lobby, and on each floor, sculptures and paintings by Chinese, Korean, and Japanese artists are displayed.

Gary greeted us at the hotel entrance upon arrival and helped us figure out how to get our green health code. We had many meals at the lounge which consisted of tea sandwiches, sushi, a noodle station and other snacks. Hot dishes and dessert plus a salad bar were also available. Drinks were plentiful and they have a wine dispenser with 4 white and 4 red bottles. All the staff were lovely, but I would like to single out Shawn at the club lounge and Gary at the arrival area.  What consistently phenomenal customer service! I would not hesitate to book again at this hotel.

msg:Booked here to celebrate my birthday for a night and the place is definitely superb made sure to make it the most amazing and unforgettable experience ever. We were greeted with a very hospitable staff and welcome us with a nice snack  shorts, and our room was perfect. Its was well decorated and thanks to the ladies and gentlemen who were doing the lifting to do necessary arrangement. I and  some of my friends also went to stop by at the top floor bar, 'The Flair" it was so cool and the view was just outstanding and mind blowing location for intimate chillax night with friends and love one. The night was just superb and glad to say it ended  which guest and I were definitely satisfied. Here's more,  in the morning I  had breakfast  and I thought it will end it there checking out but  when i asked and confirmed if I can check out a little bit later they confirmed that my stay could be until 5 pm . then  it  is translated to me staying for lunch at the club lounge. I made to swim and enjoyed the pool for sometime ( it just a bit annoying when I saw one of the guest swimming  and spitting with a loud clearing  throat on the pool and when I called the attention of the pool in charge , he just seem to shrug it off like its nothing so I just left the pool. ) before heading back to lounge for  tea  (it was exquisite! ) ..I sat at the veranda where I can see a great view from top and same time feeling refreshed.
Location is great, walking distance to mall  and some other restaurants but who needs one ? haha I would like to special mention  to JoJo who made all the things possible from coordinating and making sure everything is just right  even though she was off duty that day her amazing hospitality skills really is evident. Everyone at the hotel made my stay  enjoyable and was very friendly and accommodating. Shout out to the decorating team who pop and hang the balloons and to  house keeping team thank you for the bead welcoming arrangement. It is just creative .
I have a full day activity although I didn't make it to cocktail because I have to check out due to some commitment. It is a recommendable hotel with a high praise and satisfaction, If you have the chance, don’t miss out on experiencing this 5 star service hotel, definitely Ritz!

msg:Before this trip, we would not really have thought of ourselves as a "Ritz Carlton" type family.  We like Air BnB's and and finding local places and, well, saving money.

The staff at the Ritz Carlton have ensured our return to this and other properties. Rianna, Richard and Daisy turned our most miserable day into our most memorable day.  

We were finishing our six week holiday around China and had left Xi'an to return to our home in Shanghai.  The train stopped at the first station.  Track problems up ahead (we would find out later that day it was the massive flooding that you've heard about on the news). Minutes turned into hours.  We were stuck for nine hours and sent back to Xi'an.  We scrambled to get a hotel. Everything near the train station and airport was booked. Our young kids were miserable.  Going through trip.com I thought, "Ok, lets do something special for the kids".  Time for putting on the Ritz. 

We get to the hotel and we're greeted by Rianna at the concierge  (I went to the wrong desk) and she kindly guides me to Richard.  Somehow Richard sees that we're totally exhausted and immediately suggests giving us an upgrade.  Wow.  Next we get in the elevator and Rianna escorts us to our room.  She asks if we're here for business or vacation.  I explain that we were on vacation but now we're here because trains aren't leaving the city. I explain its been a rough day.  

We get to our room and I order food from a place nearby.  Becuase my Chinese is so terrible I have it sent to the wrong place.  I'm searching the lobby and Rianna finds me, checks my phone, calls the delivery guy, and then walks me down the street to the mall where I have had my food delivered by accident.  

After dinner, we're getting the kids settled into bed.  Knock at the door.  Rianna and Daisy come in with glasses of warm milk and adorable stuffed animals for the children.  There is also a card from all three of the staff members that says that they hope that our stay has helped us turn the day around.  There was even a hand drawn picture of the four of us on a train and smiling.  It was the most thoughtful gesture I have ever experienced from someone that we had only just met. 

That is how they turned our miserable day into a memorable day.  

The room was amazing and comfortable, the breakfast buffet was delicious and fresh, but the staff was extraordinary.   

Thank you Richard. Thank you Rianna.  Thank you Daisy.   Our summer trip could have ended on a sour note, but because of you, it ended with the happiest of memories. 

Thank you.

I was very happy to meet Vincent, who was very professional and attentive. He enthusiastically introduced the surrounding area of ​​the hotel and the internal facilities of the hotel. There is a large shopping mall next to the hotel, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. The subway station is nearby and it is also very convenient for travel.

In addition, there is one less kind of tea. Now there are only tea bags. The quality should have declined in this regard. In addition, the service is lacking. For example, I have paid for the room. But the room card was only opened for one day. Also, when you enter the room for breakfast, the guide said that they would pour you a cup of black tea. But for two consecutive days, they didn't do it, so you should do it yourself. And don't stay here. The room closest to the elevator is too noisy. The batteries of the mirror in the room are all rotten. They have not been replaced in time. As you can imagine, I haven't seen this place for half a year. The cleaning lady at the entrance of the lobby was actually wiping the floor with a small rag. This is really worthy of praise! The variety of breakfast is quite rich.

In terms of service, Cassie from the hotel contacted me the day before check-in and provided very good service. She heard that we would arrive at the hotel early, so the hotel arranged a room for us very early and let us check in early.
In terms of the five meals a day, everything was delicious, especially the noodles in the lounge, which were a must. The noodles for every meal were delicious. I personally feel that they are better than those in nearby restaurants. The afternoon tea was also very exquisite, and the freshly baked scones were large and generous. I highly recommend it! I personally suggest that those with sufficient funds can go for the executive room type.
Overall, it was a very good experience

It took several times to give them little by little, and they gave me gifts of another theme. I was a little disappointed, but the service of the front desk lady and brother was really great! I told the brother after checking out and he left the room card to me. I really like it! ! The environment is very good for dad to take the children to swim, and the children have fun. I also want to praise the children's washing and care products! It smells so good, the children like it very much, and they take the initiative to wash their hair and take a bath. The sleeping bedding environment is very comfortable, and the breakfast on the second day is even better. I have a variety of different flavors of breakfast, biangbiang noodles, cold skin, and roujiamo! The specialties are also very rich! Come again next time! 
Small suggestion: The little yellow duck in the theme room is dried and placed. There is water in it and I dare not give it to the children. There is also a guest room aunt knocking on the door. I was about to open the door, and I opened it myself. I felt a little offended! 
The overall environment and service are still first-class! Looking forward to next time!

Hygiene: The hygiene is also good, and it was cleaned twice a day
I will choose Ritz again next time I come

msg:1. The light could not be turned off during the whole stay. I thought I had not found the switch. I slept with the light on. It affected my sleep until the next day. I asked the front desk to call a professional to check it out. The maintenance staff said it was indeed broken. I was very angry and could not fall asleep again. It affected my rest.
2. The TV turned on automatically in the middle of the night for some reason. I woke up. It was very dazzling and played music. It was very strange.
3. As soon as I checked into the room, the cleaner knocked on the door and said they wanted to clean it. I had just checked in for less than an hour. What was they cleaning? And when a cleaner came to deliver something, he was still talking on the phone while knocking on the door and handing it to me. I don’t know how the hotel trained them. Impolite

msg:I came to Xi'an for a weekend trip, and everything was great at the Ritz-Carlton! On the first day of check-in, Jocelyn, a hotel staff member, called to confirm the check-in information and asked if there were any needs, which was very considerate!

After arriving at the hotel, the staff in the hotel lobby were very polite~ Especially Xuanzi, who helped check in at the front desk. Although there were many tourists in Xi'an, I felt that she was still very efficient and enthusiastic when checking in. She asked about our needs and introduced the hotel before we took the elevator. The process made me feel very comfortable! During the chat, she recommended that I must try the oil-splashed noodles for breakfast at the hotel, which has received many positive reviews from guests! It was really good!

The hotel's decoration and design are also very advanced, and every detail design is very good. The public space is beautiful, the bedding feels good, and the transportation is convenient. I recommend everyone to stay at the Ritz-Carlton when they come to Xi'an!

The back and side panels of the toilet in the guest room are detached and cannot be closed. It does not affect the use but the appearance is not very good. There is a lot of dust and fluff in the guest room, and dust accumulates quickly. It is said that a fully enclosed room with central air conditioning will not have this problem. The water spray conversion between the bathtub and the shower is not easy to operate, which is laborious and not intuitive.

What was even weirder was that there was a bone in the room that was leftover meat from someone who had eaten it. When checking out, I gave feedback to the front desk and the attitude was perfunctory. After checking out, I went to the Chinese restaurant on the second floor for dinner at 1:30. The waiter was very unprofessional. Maybe in a hurry to get off work. In short, two thousand yuan a night gave me the feeling of a fast hotel.

📍Location: Compared to the Hualuxe where I stayed before, the Ritz-Carlton is a little further away from the attractions, but the hotel is connected to Zhongda International, so shopping and dining are very convenient.
🏡Environment: The room is large and bright, the sofa and bed are soft and comfortable! The bathroom is also large, with double sinks and excellent shower facilities. Like it👍🏻
🛎️Service: The service in the executive lounge on the 23rd floor is very considerate. The restaurant on the 3rd floor has no service at all. There was no waiter passing by our table from beginning to end. There were tables on the left and right. What does this mean? Maybe we are transparent...hehe...

msg:Worthy of the title of Ritz-Carlton, it feels the best among the many five-star hotels in Xi'an. Whether it is breakfast, lobby bar, room facilities, or service, they are all impeccable. There is also a high-end shopping mall next to it, where you can eat, drink, and have fun, which complements the Ritz-Carlton, so you don't have to worry about being bored when staying in the hotel. I recommend two places to eat, which are a little far from the Ritz-Carlton, but not far away. One is 3511, where there is a chain store of Xi'an local food Yuanjiacun, as well as various other snacks. Compared with other chain stores, this Yuanjiacun feels more spacious and refreshing, and the taste is also good, it is worth a try. In addition, there is a Tongshengxiang branch of Mutton Soup with Steamed Buns not far away. I often come to Xi'an and will definitely eat Mutton Soup with Steamed Buns. I have eaten in many of them. To be honest, they are all good. I don't feel any difference, including breaking the buns by myself or by machines. They are all almost the same. I guess the resolution of my gourmet cells is not high. So for friends who come and stay in the hotel, if you don't want to join in the crowd and just want to quietly taste the authentic Mutton Soup with Steamed Buns in Xi'an, this one is good. The machine can break the buns. In addition, for friends from other places, when eating steamed buns, it is recommended to tell the waiter to ask for a wider soup, that is, more soup, otherwise friends from other places may not be able to eat it. Finally, I can recommend this store's own sour plum juice.

msg:I chose Xi’an as my first stop in the new year. I’m a big fan of Marriott. One of my hotel control goals was to visit Cassian Ritz to collect room cards. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be the most correct decision for this trip. Even my picky mother didn’t like it. Absolutely.
From check-in to check-out, the smiles and services of all the staff melted into our hearts. After sending the luggage into the room, he shyly wished my mother a happy Women's Day. Thanks to the concierge for kindly reminding us of the hotel. There are shopping malls and hotel special breakfasts next to us. The lady who checked in made us more aware of the situation. She took us all the way to the room and introduced all the facilities in the room. She thoughtfully asked us if we were resting well every day. The super beautiful and gentle housekeeper, Sasa, retired. When I checked in, I asked if I could leave a room card. The beautiful lady at the front desk gave me two. After check-out, the concierge director Gary pushed our luggage all the way to the car and waved goodbye. Even the aunt who cleans the guest rooms and everyone The little brother and sister who helped deliver things the first time all smiled sweeter than honey. I asked Xi'an Ritz, do you recruit people based on their looks? How come the staff are so good-looking and have such strong business capabilities! !
It's a pity that I didn't know the names of the concierge guy who delivered the luggage and the two ladies who checked in and out. I didn't write them down. They all said that they would give me a 5-star review if possible. How can I say 5 stars is enough? I want to give you 12 stars🥺I love every staff member
The Nanjing Ritz I checked in in March last year was said online to be the best Ritz in **************. However, after staying in Xi’an this time, I discovered that no matter how strong the hardware is, it can’t compare to the comfortable and pleasant service attitude👍🏻
When visiting Xi'an, I highly recommend the Ritz for accommodation🌰The service attitude of all departments is ridiculously good, even surpassing the St. Regis Changsha and the Ritz Xi'an, which have the best service in my opinion, making guests feel truly at home and another home away from home👍 🏻👍🏻👍🏻

msg:Cleanliness: The room was cleaned very well, and other areas were also spotless. The cleaning efforts were in place.
Environment: Downstairs of the hotel is Zhongda International, which is very convenient for shopping and eating. It's a good place to go shopping in the afternoon.
Service: The service is relatively average. I have stayed in many Ctrip Golden Diamond hotels. As the flagship store of Ritz in China, there is no front-line phone number. When checking in, the front desk said that the room was fully booked the day before. It is understandable, but at this level Hotels in this price range need to pay attention to this issue. Another personal suggestion is the issue of minibar charges. The prices of hotels such as Chongqing Regent and Guiyang Amber are similar to those of the Ritz. However, Dyson hair dryers and free minibar soft drinks are standard in basic rooms, and Ritz executive rooms have Coca-Cola. I think the hotel management can think about improving the fact that they all charge a fee. Others, such as the meals in the executive lounge and the warm attitude of the service staff, are pretty good and there is no problem.
Facilities: I heard that the Xi'an Ritz and the Kyoto Ritz were designed by the same designer. As expected, the overall style is quite obvious, but many places are still full of the unique charm of the ancient capital of Xi'an. The hotel has been open since 19 It has been more than 5 years, but maybe because of the three-year epidemic, the maintenance is still very good. I personally like this style better.

In addition, the temperature of the bath is not stable. The service was excellent. The laundry was very clean and it was relatively cheap among hotels of the same level. In addition, the capsule coffee tastes a bit unpleasant. Overall it can be said to be the best hotel in Xi'an. The bar on the top floor is also very good. The room price of 1,000 is very cost-effective compared to the whole country.

I stayed at the Yanta Westin for the first two days. The service was not as good as the Westin. Except for the young receptionist at the restaurant and lobby bar, the attitude of the high-level staff inside was quite satisfactory, a bit arrogant, and unfriendly, such as the ordering staff and coffee maker at the restaurant noodle counter.
We checked in with our children, but the room was not cleaned out. We were asked to go around and wait for the room card first. The luggage would be delivered to the room, but the room did not prepare children's slippers, bathrobes, and toiletries, which was very inconsiderate. There will be no small gifts from the online reviews. The child likes the little lion and bought it extra, and there is no welcome fruit.
When checking in, I heard a guest complain that it seemed that he did not match his rights. The hotel explained that it was full and there was no way, and the guest was super angry.

It’s not that the service is not good, but I always feel that something is missing (for example, there is no introduction to the hotel facilities, and whether there is room upgrade, etc., there is no explanation...)
Later I met Sienna Li and she directly helped me give feedback to the upper management.
Cloris Li, the hotel duty manager, contacted me directly and finally delivered breakfast for the next day and fruits and desserts in the evening.
This experience simply exceeded my expectations
Later, when I checked out, the lady from the customer service depar**ent, Sasa Hou, also gave me a small gift. I liked it very much.
(There is a little interlude here. I had already arrived at the airport. I received a call from the hotel saying that I had missed a piece of clothing, and then I realized that I had forgotten all my down jacket. I also bothered the hotel staff to arrange for express delivery. I really thank the hotel for the express delivery. I paid for it myself😂)
In short, the Ritz-Carlton in Xi'an should be the first choice when visiting Xi'an in the future.
(The transportation is also very convenient. In fact, there is a subway station downstairs)

The swimming pool experience is not very good, the water temperature is a bit cold, and the small pool next to it is actually under maintenance. Fortunately, there is a pool in the locker room to make up for it. Generally speaking, the hotel is more business-oriented and does not have a children's playground. It is really difficult to find a family hotel in Xi'an. However, the Ritz is generally suitable for check-in. It would be perfect if there is a children's playground and parent-child activities.

They plausibly said it was for better service, and what we needed was to finish things early and go back to the room to rest. After arriving in the room, I contacted the front desk but couldn't get through.
Room: The room type is arranged in the corner, and it is extremely inconvenient to get in and out. The curtains were said to be electric, but they were broken and couldn't be opened at all, so you couldn't see the outside scenery.
Hygiene: There is a lot of dust in the room and it smells like dust. There were finger prints on the bathroom door, and the cleaning didn't pay attention to detail.
The overall feeling is that the price is high and does not meet the standards of a star hotel.

msg:The room was very nice! As soon as you enter the door, the curtains slowly rise and the scenery gradually comes into view. The decoration of the room is very Xi'an, with paintings and ornaments.
Special thanks to the duty manager Leo Zhang Jiahua! Contact me by phone before check-in to help me arrange early check-in. On the day of check-in, I was given a little lion and a small mirror! ! ! (I like it very much!!!) He also took me to visit the executive lounge and introduced me to the surroundings in detail. During the chat, there was a message on Manager Zhang’s phone, but he ignored it and continued to introduce it to me. He was very respectful to his customers and was serious and responsible! Really praise it! Nice hotel! Staff service is better!
I give full marks to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel during this trip to Xi'an. I am so satisfied. Next time I come, I’ll order Ritz again, nothing to say.

I will definitely visit again when I come to Xi'an in the future. Thanks to all the hotel staff! It left wonderful memories for our family.
It's just a little regrettable. I hope the quality of the hotel's slippers can be improved, as it is slightly inconsistent with the Ritz's positioning.

I arrived at the hotel front desk at 23:25 in the middle of the night. The executive king room I had booked was told that the room was no longer available. Because there was a conference team, they wanted to give me a so-called upgrade, but I didn't agree. Finally, after staying up for twenty minutes, I was given an executive suite. I reluctantly accepted it, but in the morning I had to go to the executive lounge for breakfast, but the room card could not be swiped to the executive lounge. It was outrageous.

Then the little lion didn't send it...

Although the oolong incident affected my mood, the final encounter with her was great. It was such a cold weather and the unknown middle-haired lady sent us to the car at the door. I really felt sincere and warm. Thank you. .

When I arrived, the concierge at the hotel was very enthusiastic and took the initiative to help me carry my luggage and deliver it to the room. The young lady named Zhang at the front desk has a super nice attitude! (Because the lights are a bit dim, I don’t have the nerve to keep staring at the nameplates.) Carefully inform me about the benefits of the executive floor and explain patiently. The processing speed was very fast, and I even helped press the elevator button and sent it to the elevator door. Maybe because I arrived late, there were no welcome fruits and small gifts in the room, which was a bit disappointing. After all, I booked an executive room. But the next day, I had fruit supplements, turned down the bed, and gave me a small bookmark, which was very Xi'an style. I am very satisfied that you can have breakfast in the executive lounge on the executive floor. Although there are few types, it has everything you need. It is very quiet and the service is very good. I like it very much! The lady at breakfast on the executive floor was also super nice! It was her who worked the morning shift for two days ~ Hehe! The view from the executive floor is very good. It is very comfortable to look out from afar after breakfast in the morning. Because I have a hobby of collecting hotel lion cubs, I always keep one at the Ritz-Carlton wherever I go. Xi'an is no exception~The lion team is growing!

msg:Choose to try it on the last day in Xi’an🌰
I stayed at another hotel for the first two days (not disclosed)
The first is that they didn't call me in advance to confirm my check-in. In the past, the hotels I stayed in would call a day in advance, but these are small things. The second is that they didn't have a robot, which I think is quite inconvenient. When you get tired from playing at night and order takeout or something, you still have to run downstairs to get it yourself. Maybe you can upgrade it?
In terms of service, I didn’t feel very enthusiastic when checking in and out. No one told us where to take the elevator or where the breakfast address was. This was not very good because it was my first time to live in Xi’an. It was a bit discounted.
The facilities are quite average. There are no windows in the room and it feels a bit stuffy.
Two FLAIR special cocktails: The overall environment is not bad, but there should be traces of wine spilled under our seats and it is very sticky, but we wanted to take it back and they quickly packed it up! Very considerate.
Breakfast: quite satisfactory with many varieties, similar to hotels of the same level.

I chose this hotel by chance this time, but it also made my honeymoon trip unforgettable. Because I owe my girlfriend a birthday party, I want to secretly make up for this regret here. I added the butler's WeChat account in advance. The butler arranged the room very carefully, and there was also a super delicious cake. My girlfriend loved it.
  Their breakfast is very good, especially the porridge and fried noodles. The quality is definitely higher than Atlantis in Sanya. The hotel is relatively quiet, which is what I like. The bedding is very comfortable and suitable for people like me who like to stay in bed. Those who can swim can experience the feeling of floating in the constant temperature swimming pool, which is really nice.
 Having stayed in so many hotels, this is the first time I write a hotel review, and it can be said that it has won my heart. In fact, a hotel of this level pays more attention to service. Today I will share my experience with you. I hope you will have a wonderful trip to Xi'an~

I stayed in an executive room with a Chinese style, harmonious color matching, spacious rooms and unparalleled views. Every morning, the button automatically opens the curtains, giving you a panoramic view of the surrounding scenery, which is refreshing. Next, let’s talk about the service. There are five meals a day in the executive lounge. The meals are exquisite and delicious, and the desserts are also great. In terms of service, the waitress is very enthusiastic and will take the initiative to ask the guests' needs. Especially the executive lounge manager Zhang Di Joyce is enthusiastic, professional and provides good service. Miss Xiao Han is also very enthusiastic, proactive and friendly. I saw her sweet smile both days. There is also a young man at the front desk of the lounge who is also very attentive. The food he brings is very hot and he will give careful instructions. You can go to the third floor for breakfast. The restaurant on the third floor has a very good environment and rich meals. There are various Shaanxi specialties, such as Roujiamo, and various Shaanxi special pastas. The one who impressed me the most was a guy wearing glasses in the omelette section. His service was very good. I ordered an egg benedict and forgot to pick it up, but he took the initiative to bring it to me. I felt embarrassed. Since the flight tickets were late on the last day, Sister Li at the front desk helped us delay check-out. We had a lot of luggage, and she enthusiastically helped us to send them out of the hotel together. She was so enthusiastic that it was a bit embarrassing. In short, when I came to the hotel, I adjusted my itinerary because of the comfort. I really wanted to spend more time in the hotel. Finally, let me talk about my personal experience: If you are looking for quality when traveling, I really recommend staying here. Although the location here is not in the center of the tourist area, the subway is very convenient. Line 6 can basically reach: near the Bell Tower and Drum Tower, and the Yongding Gate of Xi'an City Wall Wait, going to Terracotta Warriors from Line 6 to Line 9 is also very smooth. The most important thing is that the subway is right across the street from the hotel downstairs (very convenient). Don't hesitate, if the price is right, come and experience it now while there are not many people~

It is also very convenient to take the subway if there is a traffic jam. The hotel's cleaning lady was very careful in cleaning and tidying up all the items I threw away. She was very friendly to a lazy person like me. The service attitude of the concierge is very good, especially Alan of the concierge. I was delayed in Beijing due to something and kept pushing back the pick-up time. He was very patient in re-arranging a vehicle for me. When I was dropped off at the airport, I was in a hurry and communicated with him. We immediately arranged a car to take us to the airport, and the recommended Shaanxi cuisine restaurant was also delicious. The hotel's breakfast is good, and many of the dishes are about Xi'an's specialties, so a lazy person like me can eat Xi'an's specialties in the hotel.

The mistake made me almost lose my good impression of the hotel, but later, Manager Miao from the concierge depar**ent dealt with it in time and gave us a lot of help, which I am very grateful to! A hotel with such management staff will really be recognized by many guests. Once again, the hotel's breakfast food is very rich, and the biangbiang noodles and steamed noodles are really delicious!

msg:I checked into the room in the afternoon. When I returned to the room in the evening, I found a strong smell of smoke in the room and obvious ash on the ground. Moreover, the entire hotel is non-smoking. The housekeeping service said they didn't know and arranged for the cleaning staff to come and check. After the cleaning staff entered the room, they also smelled a strong smell of smoke and saw soot. The cleaning lady called another supervisor. Then a person who looked like the cleaning supervisor came into the room. They saw cigarette ashes and smelled smoke, but they thought it was a cleaning problem. They took photos on the spot and wiped off the ashes, and said they would arrange for me to change rooms. After that, I waited for the customer service call to ask me if there was a smell of smoke. I was very dissatisfied because two staff members had already checked it. There was no communication between the staff members and they asked me the same question repeatedly. After that, the customer service went upstairs to check and smelled a strong smell of smoke, so they changed my room. As a result, during the process of changing rooms, all the power in the room was cut off. I stayed alone in the room without power for about 5 minutes. The customer service apologized again and changed the room. Based on my trust in the hotel, I did not choose to call the police on the spot. As a result, the hotel replied to me the next day and said that they had checked the surveillance and no one entered my room. I was very dissatisfied with this answer. I also called the police afterwards, but I could not because there was no loss. After filing a case, the police also said that they quickly checked the surveillance and found that no one had entered. So far, no senior hotel officials have contacted me and there has been no compensation.
So this matter is either a **** or the hotel is hiding something.
Whatever the reason, the entire hotel handling and service was speechless.
What's even more outrageous is that I compiled this incident into a note video and posted it on a certain platform. Unexpectedly, a suspected hotel staff came to the comment area of ​​my note to abuse me for directing and acting, and discriminated against me for being a bad customer who booked the hotel through Ctrip. .

The lobby is quiet and comfortable, not too noisy. The waiters are very caring and answer questions in a timely manner.
There are Chinese food area and Western food area for breakfast. It also provides Xi'an local delicacies, Hu spicy soup, whistle noodles, and meat sandwiches. The taste is average, and it is suitable for those who don't have time to find food. The western food is good, especially the desserts.

Convenient transportation, very close to the subway. The basic scenic spots can be reached by subway. There is also a shopping mall next to it, and there is a supermarket inside

msg:This is a very difficult hotel to review
Everyone's service is very enthusiastic
For example, the lady in room service
The lady checking in at the front desk
Including the housekeeper...
But I really can’t compliment the professionalism of what I do.
The management feels chaotic.
1. The wrong room type was arranged when checking in
I booked a 1.35m twin room with Ctrip
I was given a 2-meter double bed room
It’s really shameful that you can make such low-level mistakes.
And when I questioned that the room type was wrong, the girl’s defense was that I didn’t question it when she confirmed everything with me during check-in...
Please write it clearly on Ctrip's order. Shouldn't it be that you want to be optimistic about the room arrangement of the order? I fully trust your professionalism, okay?
After entering the room, I realized that the room type was wrong.
2. Tent
Because I had children with me, I booked a children's room decoration on Ctrip. Very well laid out, matter of fact. The little tent is very cute and comes with small desserts, an apron for the little lion and a reusable bag.
However, when we went out for fun the next day, the hotel called us and told us that we had only booked the decoration of the children's room for one day. We had to take back the tent today, otherwise we would have to deduct an extra day's decoration fee... We couldn't go back to the hotel right away while we were outside. Then you go into the room to pick it up... The experience is not good. The tent is just there for decoration. Is this the only tent the hotel is rushing to take the next order? Either make it clear when checking in and let us know the hotel's rules in advance. We will just check in and tell us when we must return it, otherwise it will be really disappointing.
3. About check-out
My bookings on Ctrip were not consecutive for two days. Because I wanted to make sure that the elderly and children liked it, I made a reservation for one day. After checking in, I immediately placed an order for another night and sent it to the housekeeper for confirmation. She said there was no problem and she would stay in the original room. But the next afternoon when we were out playing, we received a call from some hotel depar**ent asking us if we had checked out? I am very surprised. Is there no communication between various depar**ents? Will the hotel information not be updated?
I feel that there is a problem with the connection and cooperation between various depar**ents in the hotel.
Everyone is very enthusiastic, but the lack of cooperation with each other should be a problem of overall management. Professionalism is also lacking, and pre-job training is insufficient.
4. Regarding room charges and breakfast charges
I was asked to pay the deposit for the second day. I went to the front desk and asked about the fee for the first day. The girl checked the computer for a long time and said that only 1,900+ was deducted from the room fee, and a breakfast was given to us as a courtesy. I was speechless when I heard this: It was obviously the room rate plus an extra breakfast fee. I paid for the breakfast myself. Why did you say it was given to us? I showed her the order on my mobile phone. The order on Ctrip was clear. The room rate was 1,700+. The little girl was confused. She checked the computer again. She couldn’t figure out the reason for a long time. In the end, she could only take a screenshot of the Ctrip order on my mobile phone and said to ask. Ask and then reply... Professionalism is real...
Can’t I see the order fee components on the hotel front desk computer? If I have any questions about the charges, who should I check with? Do you need to ask your superiors for permission? I don’t understand, I don’t understand.
In the last phone call, I was told that they had indeed added the cost of a breakfast. Please, it’s just a room rate plus a breakfast. How complicated is that? Why do you say it's a gift when there's obviously no gift... Speechless
5. My daughter’s foot was scratched by the picture frame (metal) beside the bed. It was not serious, and there was a little blood. But those who dare not think about it if the sharp corners touch their foreheads. Future guests should be careful. The hotel handled it promptly and added anti-collision corners.

After staying for two nights, at noon on the day we were about to check out, someone who claimed to be the director called us to apologize and wanted to apologize in person. I said no, but she still apologized in person when we checked out and gave us a lion that is only available in suites. Photo frames for kids.

To be honest, it was our first time in Xi'an. Among the several hotels we stayed at, the W Hotel and Yunhe Yebo Hotel had the best impression. The services of the other two hotels were nothing to say. In addition, the breakfast at W Hotel was better than Much better. The price is the same. The content is rich and the quality is better. You can eat several Roujiamo in a row. It’s very enjoyable. Ritz’s Roujiamo is cold and the meat inside is hard. In comparison, it’s high. Immediately, the breakfast at W Hotel is highly praised~
Yunhe Yebo has the best service, and the hotel facilities are not bad at all. The price is one level cheaper than W and Ritz, and the price/performance ratio is the best. In addition, the restaurant in Yunhe Yebo has very good cooking. I had a dinner and it was very cost-effective.

msg:This time I stayed in Xi'an for four days and chose the Ritz-Carlton. You can't go wrong with the old luxury five-star blind selection. This Ritz is newly opened and relatively new in every aspect.
Service: The doorman has a very good attitude. He will help open the door and pick up the luggage every time. He always greets me with a smile, which makes people feel very good. He is the most praiseworthy among the many luxury five-star hotels I have stayed in. The receptionist's attitude was average, and he didn't do much to introduce the hotel. There was no smiling face when checking in. The service attitude of the bar is very good. I went to the bar on the top floor of Flair every day. I got to know almost every bartender. They were all talkative and had a good image. They made good wines and I also tasted the wine that the guy just developed haha. .

Room facilities: I was given a high-rise room, Room 01. The layout was a little unreasonable. The dressing room was at the innermost part of the room instead of the outermost one. The bedding was very comfortable and the bathroom was large. However, there was something very strange on the TV on the sink. It's dusty and the air conditioning is well controlled, which is the advantage of a new hotel.

Gym: The locker room is the best I have experienced in recent years. It is very large and has a great sense of privacy. There are many functional areas and are very reasonable. The massage pool is good for dry and wet steaming. The swimming pool is also very clean, but not very big. Business hours to 11 p.m.

There is a shopping mall downstairs from the hotel, which is very convenient for eating and drinking, but it is not close to the scenic spots, and it takes seven or eight kilometers to take a taxi. The breakfast at the hotel is also very rich, but after a few days I got tired of it hahaha. I will definitely choose it again next time. It is known as the largest lounge in Asia. Come and experience it next time.

msg:The overall experience was not good.
       Let’s talk about the ok aspects first. The staff in the hotel’s material service depar**ent are ok, and the breakfast is good, so I gave it two points.
       In terms of poor experience, firstly, the room is relatively small, secondly, the quality of the bedding is too poor, the quilt cover and quilt core do not fit very well, and it becomes two sheets with a slight movement, and the texture of the bed sheet and quilt cover is ridiculously poor. The elders in the family couldn't sleep all night because of the squeaking noise. They turned over and made the squeaking sound for fear of disturbing their children, which made them feel very uncomfortable all night. To be honest, this kind of bedding is not even as good as a hotel worth 200 yuan. I don’t know how this so-called five-star hotel is managed. Doesn’t it have any quality control? ! Third, takeout cannot be delivered to the room. Being able to order takeout proves that it is inconvenient to go out. As a result, you have to go to the lobby to pick it up yourself. There is not even a food delivery robot. Fourth, when the waiter asked about satisfaction when checking out, I explained that the elderly had not slept all night due to bedding problems. One of the waiters could verbally apologize, while the other had an arrogant and indifferent expression.

msg:This time I came to Xi'an, the most sensible choice is to choose the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. In particular, I met Edward, the chief concierge of the Golden Key. He added WeChat one day in advance and learned that my daughter was celebrating her birthday. He specially arranged a room for her, presented her with a birthday cake and a little lion, and customized a special commemorative room for her. Card, made us have a wonderful and memorable birthday in Xi'an. He tried his best to help us with any needs. Since Xi'an is a popular tourist city this year, there are huge crowds of people everywhere. To be honest, the experience is not very good, but when I return to the Ritz-Carlton, it is like "Welcome home" as the hotel staff said. It seems that I have really returned to my comfortable place. At home, sweep away the fatigue of playing outside. Whether it is the beautiful sister at the front desk or the little brother who carries the luggage, they all greet you cordially, like a spring breeze. Cici at the front desk also gave us N 95 masks. The housekeeping depar**ent saw that we had a lot of clothes, and thoughtfully sent a small bottle of laundry detergent; when they saw that we had brought some books, they would attach bookmarks. And all the reminders are in the form of handwriting, bit by bit, heart-warming, Ritz-Carlton has achieved the ultimate in humanities and ideas.
        At the same time, the transportation downstairs of the hotel is convenient. We travel by subway to popular attractions, which is convenient and free from traffic jams.
        Moreover, due to different eating habits, Xi’an’s snacks are a bit uncomfortable. The executive lounge and the fresh kitchen on the third floor of Lizzy Carlton satisfy all our tastes, and also include Xi’an’s gourmet features, drinks, juice coffee, bread Pastries, different mains each day, etc. We dine at the hotel every day to satisfy Mei Bui. Once again, I would like to sincerely thank everyone in the hotel for bringing us "home".

msg:The first stop in Xi’an, the Ritz-Carlton, was known to be the leader in the hotel industry before booking. I haven’t stayed in other cities yet, and my expectations were relatively high, but it really didn’t disappoint. Miss Lydia called me the next day after I booked the hotel to ask if I had any extra needs and what time I expected to arrive at the store.
The breakfast is also quite unique. It has all the characteristics of Xi’an. There are also various pastries and fruits. We are very satisfied with the food here. After eating in the morning, we don’t need to eat lunch. We eat dinner around 4 o’clock in the afternoon. Two meals a day are enough
I like the decoration of the room. I checked the style of the hotel and the time of decoration before booking. The smart curtains, lights, and smart toilets in the bathroom make it feel exactly like living in my own home.
The hotel's response was also very timely. I called and got the things within a few minutes.
This time I stayed in Xi'an, Ritz-Carlton, Wyndham, Marriott, except for Wyndham, others are very satisfied
When we checked out, there was a young lady named cici who was very small. Our suitcases were super heavy. We were embarrassed to push them for us anyway.
Next time I come to Xi'an, I will choose Ritz-Carlton again

The breakfast fruit is delicious. Xi'an is completely different from 10 years ago. The transportation is convenient, the scenic spots are standardized, civilized and hygienic, and there are staff and police everywhere, so I feel safe. Datang Everbright City is domineering and magnificent. Xi'an is an economically developed city.

msg:As a relatively new hotel, it is more business-oriented, so the hardware should be ok. Check-in is relatively comfortable, but it has no features. In terms of software services, they can't keep up at all, and they have no sense of service. The hotel stipulates to check in after 2:00 pm. I arrived at 3:00 and checked in at 3:05, but I didn’t give the room card for a long time. I waited for check-in and waited for 50 minutes to get the room. During the period, I repeatedly communicated with the front desk and told me to take it. After arriving at the room, I had to go to the museum, and I was told that the museum could not be entered at 04:30 in the afternoon. The hotel still did not coordinate and deal with it even though it was fully aware of this matter. It kept telling me that the room was ready, but it had to wait for the supervisor to confirm. Room card can be given. I couldn't bear it, so I could only coordinate with Ctrip. Ctrip responded very quickly and helped me get the room card at 15:55. I immediately called a car to go to the museum, but it was still 5 minutes late. As we all know, tickets for the Shaanxi Expo are very hard to get, which caused me to regret not being able to make the trip, and the hotel is to blame for this. However, the hotel did not pay attention to this matter, and there was no apology or sincerity in the communication with Ctrip. On the contrary, Ctrip is quick and sincere. No one took the initiative to take them to the room, and no one told the time and location of breakfast. When I went back to the guest room at night, there were no children's toiletries or slippers. I couldn't write with a pen. The shower was broken. There are a lot of people at breakfast, and the person who leads the seat will bring 2 waves of people at a time, regardless of the past and the future. It is only good to take guests to the executive lounge to rest after check-out. Expectations cannot be too high.

It just so happens that there is an afternoon tea downstairs in cooperation with HR. The gift package is very cost-effective. It is also a fate to experience it randomly.
The only small problem that must be mentioned can be improved. 1. The ventilation in the room is not good because the windows cannot be opened. There is an indescribable smell in the room, and there is no ventilation system in the bathroom.
2. The hotel does not have spare earplugs. Most of the higher-priced ones I have been to have prepared them, but when I called at night, the front desk told me that I need to buy them from the concierge.
The hardware and service are impeccable. There are many types of breakfast. It’s really wise not to live in groups. I still like a hotel with a tonality. There are not many children. The Ritz Xi’an is impressive.

Going out during the day and returning to the hotel at night, go to the executive lounge to sip cocktails, enjoy the night view, and chat with the post-00 waitresses in the lounge about life insights. It's really pleasant! I casually mentioned that I want to drink mojito, but I didn’t order anything else on the wine list and didn’t take it to heart, but after a while, CC brought me a glass of mojito, obviously putting the needs of customers first, and Jolin, The cocktails made at such a young age are good in appearance and taste, and they humbly came to ask me for advice. I am really touched. The two young ladies deserve praise! When I checked in, I found out that I hadn’t got a ticket for the Shaanxi Expo, and Marshall from the concierge depar**ent had been following up on the matter and helping me find a solution; when I learned that I needed the performance schedule of the Everbright City of Tang Dynasty, Edward from the concierge depar**ent sent a tour guide Give me and provide effective advice...sincere thanks to them! The day before leaving, I asked the front desk for the Ritz room card as a souvenir. When I returned to the room that day, I saw the room card with my name engraved on the table. I am very satisfied with the details! In short, full service is online, the best choice to come to Xi'an, everything is worth it!

I mentioned it to Ctrip, and the hotel prepared a birthday surprise for the child! The bathroom in the hotel is very big, and the smart toilet was complained by the children. Did my mother think I was a boy with the smart toilet? Why did the two toilet lids lift up!

msg:I have to say that Ritz’s service is really good. Before I checked in, Willow from the Guest Recognition Depar**ent contacted me and added WeChat, asking her to recommend some delicacies that local people in Xi’an often eat. Willow shared a lot of authentic Xi’an delicacies , the taste is very good~ After arriving at the hotel, Willow warmly welcomed me and prepared fruits and snacks. The view of the Ritz room is still very good, the photos are very good, the hardware facilities are also very good, quiet and comfortable, the second night Willow recommended me to go to Flair to taste the Silk Road cocktail served by the guest bartender. She booked a location with a great view in advance and drank with the night view. The experience was really good! Next time I have the opportunity to come to Xi'an, I must taste more delicacies and choose Ritz.

It's super close to Ganjiazhai subway station, you can take the subway or take a taxi
The service is super good, and the little brother will contact you in advance
Various running routes and travel strategies are also recommended
The style of the room is relatively simple, but the details show the quality
When checking in, the service is also very good, because there is a queue downstairs, the lady guides you to the executive lounge to check in
The overall living is very comfortable
And very quiet, very satisfied

msg:It's the first time I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Xi'an, and I feel very good. The room is very comfortable, the service industry is just right, and the sense of proportion is very good. The breakfast is very rich, with local characteristics, both Chinese and Western styles, suitable for all tastes, and there are many types of bread and desserts, it is worth it. A few points that are very humane: 1. Because the bus was late in the afternoon and there was no place to go, I asked the front desk if I could check out later (it was supposed to check out at 12 o'clock), and it was very easy to delay until 1 o'clock. 2. I was told to put more bottles of water, but when I came back, I set up a bowling alley for me, which was thoughtful and funny.

msg:Also as a member of the Ritz (Shanghai Pudong), of course I have to experience the sister hotel when I come to Xi'an this time😘. I transferred from GRO to sales, so the friends from the concierge to the front desk also felt very friendly when they saw it.
  The lady who helped us check in at the front desk is called joye? (I didn’t look at the main nameplate carefully, but I saw that most of the comments from other guests were Judy in the front hall. I didn’t seem to see any comments about joye😥, so I don’t know if it is I didn't see the typo in the name. The young lady was very kind. She took us to the elevator after check-in. She wanted to help us with our luggage, but we didn't let her carry our suitcases and bags because they were very heavy. (Because I have a deep understanding in the past, when I helped the gentlemen and ladies who checked in take their luggage to the room and introduced the hotel situation along the way, some people’s luggage was really heavy 😂
  The hotel's hardware and software are very good and there is nothing wrong with it. Shanghai Pudong Ritz has been open for a long time, and the hardware facilities are aging. If it can be refurbished according to the decoration style of Xi’an, the room may be kept full every day. P.S: If the breakfast in the hotel can be improved in the future If there is ice cream provided, it will make people feel more eye-catching😘
  Now that there is a subway station downstairs in the Ritz, it is more convenient to travel. The only regret this time is that the time is a bit rushed, so I didn’t experience the largest executive lounge in Asia. I must experience it when I come to Xi’an later. During this trip to the Ritz, Joye? Angel at the front desk, and Joyce and Emma at the service center were all great, and I was quite impressed with them.
  If it is possible in the future, I also want to live and work in Xi'an for a period of time. If this wish can be realized, I will definitely apply for an internal transfer to work in Xi'an Ritz. I will definitely have a full sense of happiness, provided that there is a corresponding depar**ent position , under the premise of vacancy😝.

Hygiene: The cleaning is meticulous. Aunt Zhang Yaqin asked if she wanted to clean it again before going to bed at night after helping to clean it during the day. The public area, lounge, and lobby are always cleaned. Tables are also sanitized after guests have eaten.

Environment: The environment is elegant! Compared with the nightclub style Lisi like w, it is really much better! ! I always feel that w is a bit cheap... The decoration in the Ritz room is also more textured. At the entrance of the lounge is the authentic work of Picasso, and many works of art are also collected in other places. Although the design of Grand Hyatt is also very good, overall Ritz is better.

Service: The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. The concierge will help deliver the luggage to the room when you check in, and someone will drive the door at the door. Just not being able to get takeaway upstairs is a real pain for me. GR Angel is very enthusiastic and patient, and the return visit is timely.

The meals in the lounge are super delicious. I really like the pepper chicken and cumin lamb chops with lotus leaf rice! I saw someone say that the fried noodles for breakfast are delicious, so I tried it too, it was really delicious hehe. Afternoon tea is also good. The staff said that the cocktails are also delicious, so I will try it next time.

msg:The Ritz has always been synonymous with luxury and high-end. This is the second time I live in Xi'an within three months. It is funny to say that it is because of the little sisters on the executive floor. Not to mention the hardware, it is very new and bright. I have only eaten breakfast, and the variety is quite rich. Anyway, I don’t eat more stir-fried vegetables, desserts, and meat. A bowl of hot noodle soup in the morning is enough in any city I go to. The most attractive thing for me here is the oil-splashed noodles made on-site, the taste is no worse than that of the online celebrity shop on the street.

Now let’s talk about the service. I was surprised by a small gesture. I ask you for your room number at the entrance of the restaurant, and then lead you to sit down. But when you pick up food at the restaurant or prepare to leave, a foreman or manager who has never met , will call out your name naturally, which is rare in five-star hotels. Very old school style, well trained. Of course, it feels like everyone knows you at the front desk or in the executive lounge.

Finally, let’s talk about the little sisters in the executive lounge. My wife and I have brought two children, one is four years old and the other is just able to stand. We are exhausted every day. Thanks to the little sisters here, who try to help us play with the children as soon as we finish the work at hand. It's not easy for a group of girls in the blooming season. They can't even hold a child, let alone accompany them patiently, so I am very grateful. This is why I stayed here for the second time in three months. While enjoying the delicious food in Xi'an, I also give it here. Take a vacation yourself! By the way, I also prepare small gifts for the children every time. I only remember the name of the executive floor manager, because she is so easy to remember, thank you Manager Zhang Mimi! Ha ha

msg:The overall rating is 4.5 points. The Ritz-Carlton is a flawless hotel. Its business features are superior to many hotels in Xi'an. The service is basically the ceiling of Xi'an hotels, but there are also shortcomings. I hope to continue to improve. It is worth mentioning that Sophie's service is proactive and enthusiastic , delightful.
Personally, I will come again and hope to improve the deficiencies in the future

Let me talk about the advantages and the small flaws of the hotel:
1. The gym and supporting facilities are basically the ceiling of this level, which is very good, and the bathing facilities in the gym are also very good
The flaw is that the swimming pool is very small, about 20m back and forth
2. The service of the hotel is very good. This must be mentioned. The service personnel will make mistakes in peak season, but the service will dispel the dissatisfaction of the guests.
3. The hotel’s accommodation conditions are also very good, and the airy bedding is also good. It’s so soft that you’ll sink yourself into it. The electric curtains are very friendly to people who are sensitive to light. The skin care products are also very good. I’ve been using asprey in private. Brand but other toiletries are average
Flaws: The fresh air system used in the hotel + all glass curtain wall, no windows, no ventilation, no balcony
Let's talk about the shortcomings and the hotel's solutions
1. The reserved parent-child room was originally checked in at 2 o'clock, but the room was not available until 5 o'clock
Solution: The hotel provides another room to rest first
2. There are not enough skin care products. It takes a long time to call the front desk. Considering the large number of people, it is acceptable
Solution: Send two or three sets of skin care products afterwards
3. Although the quality of the hotel's breakfast is good, the quantity is really mediocre compared to the same price. W wins in this aspect, but Liz's desserts are good
Solutions: None for now
I stayed three or four times in two years, and the breakfast was always the same. I bought lunch two or three times, and it was just like that

msg:New hotel with good room facilities. However, the hardware maintenance is not good, and problems occur frequently. The service is even more inexperienced.

Good place:
When I checked in, I took the initiative to arrange the room for the elderly at the elevator entrance. In order to arrange our room and the elderly on the same floor, one of the rooms was upgraded for free.

The problem that arises:
1) The water in one of the rooms was poor, and it took a long time to change the room, and it took a lot of phone calls to solve it.
2) The refrigerators in both rooms are not cold
3) The rowing machine in the gym is broken, and no one cares about it. I called my room the next day to say it was fixed.
4) The Chinese restaurant made a reservation for the New Year’s Eve dinner, but I only remembered the name of the person who made the reservation, but I didn’t know the room number. I went there and reported my own name (there are two people in our room) and told me that I didn’t have a reservation. It is very unreasonable to greet the next guest.
5) For the sake of convenience, I placed a few more orders, and the connection was very troublesome. I spent a long time explaining and communicating with the so-called account manager, but the front desk didn't know it at all, so I had to say it again.
6) Member discounts are also discussed with the account manager. The checkout front desk doesn't know about it at all, so I have to say it again.
7) There is no 24-hour restaurant. On the 29th day of the ***** calendar, I arrived at the hotel at 2 pm and wanted to eat, but I was urged to go quickly, saying that I would leave work at 2:30.

I feel that the customer manager is just a decoration, and there is no conversation between the service and the front desk. There is no butler service. It is the feeling that I am directing a group of disobedient children who are not very talkative.

Use some experienced service managers! This is not an internship hotel!

The coffee and tea bags also have local characteristics, convenient transportation, nearby food, shopping malls are convenient, and the staff service is considerate and meticulous. In particular, Angel contacted by phone before checking in and learned that we brought two children and specially prepared the children's toiletry bag. , Free upgrade to a room type on a higher floor, special care during the stay, it was a wonderful experience!

The Ritz-Carlton, Xi'an has the largest executive lounge, so I chose two executive rooms for this trip, and the price is quite cost-effective. After getting off the airport, take a taxi to the hotel. If you think that Ritz’s service is from the concierge after arriving at the hotel At the beginning, it was a big mistake, the elegant service of gentlemen and ladies of this Ritz, the Angel of the Guest Recognition Depar**ent called us a few days in advance to understand the purpose of our trip, and carefully asked us about the room and other special requirements , I think this has surpassed 99% of the hotels currently on the market. From the moment you arrive at the hotel, you can really appreciate the wonderful experience brought by Ritz. The staff Angel greeted you in advance and helped you with the relevant procedures, sent us to the room, and informed us about the hotel's restaurants, nucleic acid and other services. time.
Ritz's elegant service is enough to bring a wonderful experience to this trip to Xi'an. The room is very tidy, with many small designs, the mix and match of old objects and modern minimalist design is refreshing. The room is well-equipped and very new. The bedside Bluetooth speaker is also very useful. It returns to the core theme. The bed is very comfortable to sleep, and the fatigue is swept away. There are also small snacks and drinks in the room, I like it. The breakfast is good, the environment is great, and the dining experience is perfect. The executive chef Gaara is also very serious about the control of the dishes. Lunch and dinner were eaten in the lounge. The staff in the lounge, Duanmu, were very enthusiastic.
After checking out from the Ritz, I went to the W Hotel, another luxury hotel owned by Marriott in Xi’an, but it was not as good as the Ritz in every aspect. It can even be said that the W Hotel cannot be included in the ranks of luxury hotels, and the staff have no service attitude In stark contrast to the Ritz, it is no exaggeration to say that the Ritz in Xi'an can be called the benchmark of Chinese hotels.
Thanks again to Angel for arranging this itinerary

msg:This is a belated super review. I am a lazy person. If I could write a review, I would definitely feel the difference. This Ritz-Carlton in Xi'an gives me this feeling. The quality of all staff is super high. Starting from the check-in at the front desk, the unnamed executive floor chef and the entire working team of the breakfast room. All are very caring and considerate. Worth mentioning is the team on the executive floor. The professional and patient manager Duanmu Wenjie (Sophia), the child's favorite Ms. Sarah, Nana who draws super well, and Cassie who is quiet. Thank you so much for taking care of our family. Looking forward to seeing you next time. 🌷

msg:I like to stay in a different hotel every festival. This is an experience that exceeds expectations. I am more concerned about details and experience. Ritz gives me a really good feeling. Share a few highlights:
1) One-to-one butler service: from the beginning of the reservation, there will be a butler to connect. My butler is called Shanxi, and his name is also very beautiful, and the whole process of communication will not make people uncomfortable. Picky people really feel unpretentious and very comfortable😜, including the security guard at the entrance of the store. The height and appearance are all online, and you can even call your surname when you leave the store, which is surprising😘
2) Various details: the slippers in the room are of different sizes; the overall decoration style, bathroom wall, tissue box, toilet trash can lights are all elements of diamond 🔶 grid; because I brought a book, the night service hotel gave me I gave you a bookmark 🔖, it's warm; there is also a reading lamp by the bed, the design is really ingenious;
3) Other facilities: I experienced afternoon tea, flair bar on the 27th floor, swimming pool, all are quite good, the service meets the five-star standard of Ritz
4) Additional services: The room can enjoy free cleaning or ironing of a piece of clothing, because I delivered it late, and I need to check out at 2:00 the next day. The hotel has noted special requirements and will be delivered at 1:00 the next day. The clothes were delivered halfway through and they were professionally washed.
5) When I left the store, my housekeeper Ms. Shanxi also arranged a small gift for me, a little lion, because I am a Leo♌️, so this gift is sent to my heart🤩🤩🤩

Others: The hotel is completely non-smoking🚬, which is not very "friendly" to smoking guests, but you can smoke outside the cafe on the first floor and outside the lounge; and now during the epidemic, takeaways cannot be delivered upstairs, you need to go downstairs to the outside of the hotel Self pick up, this is a little inconvenient but understandable

Overall feeling: The hardware facilities are generally good, and the style is also my favorite, worthy of the five-star standard; the professionalism of all the personnel in the software and the interaction with the guests are quite good, I want to use the simplest two words to summarize - "Wow" 🤩

During the summer vacation with children, I chose the hotel for a long time, and finally settled on the Ritz-Kelton Hotel. Because of the children's birthday, I communicated with the hotel to arrange the room in advance. The hotel ladies and sisters are super enthusiastic, carefully arranged, and moved the old mother 😂, parent-child Baby must choose Ritz, hot moms rush 🥳

We called the front desk in the morning and hoped to be able to delay the check-out. There's nowhere to go, attractions are closed, and restaurants across the city can't dine in.

In addition, the executive lounge trea**ent is very good value.
The last nitpicking is that the location is a bit off, the swimming pool is a little smaller, and there are more people in the swimming pool during the summer vacation. This is also a hardware problem, which can be overcome. The soft factors of hotel management itself are impeccable.
Thank you for the wonderful experience you brought us.

The most commendable thing is that the service level can always observe your needs before the guests open their mouths and give the most timely help. Bring children to check in. There is a special person to accompany the children to paint and play, so that adults can check in with peace of mind. During TV time Chelsea gave the children a drawing of crayons, the hotel's mascot lion doll learned that we were going to the Terracotta Warriors the next day and prepared a book about the Terracotta Warriors for the children during bed time. Nicole drew a vivid greeting card for the children and the children couldn't put it down .And Edward and Chelsea took the initiative to add me on WeChat to recommend us about restaurants and routes... There are still many such warm gestures. I don't know how to express my gratitude. I can only use simple words to record and give praise. Thank you for your hard work.

During the epidemic, all hotel staff did not do nucleic acid, which is quite courageous. Because of the epidemic situation, I can't use takeout delivery as an excuse. I asked the staff at the front desk to show the nucleic acid certificate. The reply from the front desk staff of the hotel was that I did not receive the nucleic acid request.

Every staff member is professional and enthusiastic, which makes me have a professional experience in Japan. Edward Miao from the concierge is especially so.

First of all, the bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The toiletries are also comfortable to use, and what touches me most is the service, which is super caring. Maybe the climate in Xi’an is relatively dry for me as a southerner, causing me to bleed. Gary of the concierge is definitely a responsible person. People, when he found out, he and his colleague Mike specially asked the kitchen to boil rock sugar and Sydney syrup for me to bring to the room with a small card and a small gift. I was really warm, and my friend and I were waiting for the bus downstairs. At the time, a person named Ah SA was also very warm and polite to chat with my friends. In short, I did not feel the discomfort of being in a foreign country after staying here for a few days. Everyone came to Xi’an and it is worth staying at this hotel~ … Next time I come to Xi’an or my friends come to Xi’an, I will recommend this Xi’an Ritz-Carlton first, and enjoy it properly~

Whether it is architecture and environment, or catering and services, the Ritz-Carlton, Xi’an is absolutely worthy of the title of luxury hotel. The most satisfying thing is the cleanliness and comfort of the room. The hotel has only been opened for two years, and the facilities are very new and very clean. The soundproofing effect of the room is excellent, the bed is also very comfortable, coupled with the excellent night view of the city, can definitely let people enjoy a super comfortable sleeping experience, and cure sleep dysfunction in minutes. The smart curtains, smart toilets, high-end toiletries, and minibars in the room all demonstrate the hotel's taste and sense of luxury! Let's talk about the hotel's breakfast, which is rich in categories, delicious in color and can fully meet the needs of people with different tastes. And the breakfast time is until 10:30 in the morning at the latest, so there is no need to worry about missing breakfast due to a lazy night's sleep. In addition, the bar on the 27th floor and the executive lounge on the 23rd floor add a lot of color to the hotel and are also places to talk about and are worth visiting and experiencing. Finally, we must give special thanks to the service staff of the concierge depar**ent, especially the manager Edward Miao and director Gary Li of the concierge depar**ent. From before check-in to the last check-out, I felt their meticulous care and warm service. The exquisite welcome card and private customized travel guides all moved people's heart, and I instantly felt what it means to be at home. Thank them so much! Life is long, the Ritz Hotel will definitely be a rich and colorful stroke in the memory of the journey, which will let people have a long aftertaste! If you go to Xi'an again, you will definitely have another relationship with Ritz!

If anyone is dissatisfied with the Ritz-Carlton, then you can only live in Dubai. (Gary from the concierge depar**ent is very serious and responsible)
3. The breakfast is very rich in variety, which can basically satisfy everyone. If you have to pick a thorn, it is that the hotel does not have a fried steak or lamb chops. There will be relatively few western-style dishes, all of which are bread. (Reception at 10:30)
4. The swimming pool is very suitable for children with a water depth of 1.2. (The swimming pool is also external, not only for hotel guests, you can swim for an external fee)

Pertinent evaluation, I hope it will be helpful to everyone. Very recommended hotel.

I wanted to sleep for more than an hour. I didn’t think that the bar lamp in the room could not be turned off. I called for help. No one answered the call three times, and it was useless to turn off the main switch. The light was on and I couldn't fall asleep. It was extremely hot. Every person on duty in a five-star hotel is also called a five-star? One side of the front desk is the concierge, and the other is the front desk for check-in. Every time you go wrong, the people in the concierge are hard to speak, but it's the one over there. The Ritz-Carlton went bad when they walked to Xi'an.

2. The service center is unprofessional. I ordered a glass of lemonade and some lemon slices from the service center the first night. It was delivered to my room professionally and smoothly, but I called again the next morning When the service center asked for lemonade, the service center said that it needed to transfer me to the food delivery depar**ent. Do two different depar**ents have to manage the lemonade for two days?
3. When I called the service center for paper bags on the third morning, the service center asked me which room? Don’t you need the room number two days ago? This fully reflects the unprofessionalism of the service center.
4. But in general, the first day of experience is the best. The concierge is also very enthusiastic and has a very good attitude. It has been waiting for me to check in before leaving. But the unprofessional service center is really angry.
5. Before I checked in, I communicated with the gentleman on Ctrip. I want a higher floor. The gentleman asked me to book an elegant double room, but when I checked in, it gave me the 12th floor. I asked the front desk why It’s not a high floor. I’ve asked before. I need a double room on a high floor, but the front desk said that I need to wait for an hour and a half. I must go to the twin room first. After waiting an hour and a half, I will go to the double room, but When I booked with Ctrip, I had clearly stated that I would check in at 14 o'clock. When I arrived at the hotel, it was about 16 o'clock. Why do I need to wait for an hour and a half? So what should I do if I have something to do during this period of time?
Overall the service is really! very! Do not! it is good! Unprofessional and efficiency are really down!

msg:第二次住西安麗思了，這次是在行政套房過生日。驚喜（抑或巧合）的是，幫我辦入住的紳士淑女竟然與我同年同月同日生，可以説驚喜從進入大堂就開始了

由於是生日，禮賓部送了🍰，水果和油潑麪。三合一做的非常地道，香到讓人忍不住説額賊的地步

點名表揚禮賓部的Marshall，他雖不在線下，但一如往日地為我提供了貼心的服務照顧，及時解決了我提出的問題與要求；和他同樣出色的是禮賓部的Edward，令我印象最深刻的是他温和的笑容和行禮如儀的姿態，頗有英國管家風範；上次入住時未曾見到行政酒廊的Joyce，她的招待也十分體貼入微；為我打掃房間的一名姓冀的阿姨有着過人的耐心與細微的工作態度，她與其他同事一樣值得表揚

雖説本地人一般不在當地住店，不過我認為，如麗思般服務出眾而飽含真誠，造型古雅而不失精緻的西安酒店，恰恰更需要西安人的支持。

豪華酒店的待客之道是一個城市的門面，展現着相對高級的腔調，西安從來不乏煙火氣和生活態度，但如果想在一定程度上比肩一線，想做到中國的長安而不侷限於西北的標桿，那就需要進一步提升自己對客户的接納態度與服務能力，需要更多的西安麗思卡爾頓酒店

設施：酒廊很大，人很少，視野好。房間里的大圓桌也點個贊，吃吃喝喝孩子做作業方便。
衛生：其中一天正好出門晚，看著阿姨搞的衛生，乾淨利落。
環境：酒店新，在高新區，周邊不堵，下楼有地鐵六號線，去市區景點也算方便。
服務：這個要重點誇下酒廊的Joyce。因為春節期間房態緊張，我們又是提前了一個多小時到達。Joyce和客房的Sabrina幫忙安排了兩間同一樓層的房間，在酒廊簡單吃點午餐就可以入住了。後來因為隔壁有小嬰兒比較吵，中途換了房間。Joyce聽說我們晚上回酒店較晚，主動說幫忙搬房間，等我們晚上游玩结束回酒店，一切安排已就續。工作人员在搬的過程中不慎遗失一個剃須刀，我们原本觉得算了，客房的吴欢还买了个同款的送回来。为工作人员负责任的态度点个大大的赞，以后如果来西安必须首选丽思。

首先，我要感謝Joyce對我的熱情接待和周到關懷。她不僅專業，而且非常貼心，時刻確保我的需求得到滿足。在我入住期間，她積極解決了我的問題，讓我感到賓至如歸。
其次，我要讚揚麗思卡爾頓酒店的員工團隊。他們始終保持着高水準的服務品質，讓我感受到家外之家的温馨。每一個工作人員都展現出了專業、友善和樂於助人的態度，為我的住宿體驗增添了許多美好的回憶。
最後，我要感謝Joyce送給我的驚喜禮物，紅酒和龍年限定小獅子。這份小小的禮物讓我的入住體驗更加特別，也展現了麗思卡爾頓酒店對客人的關懷之心。
總的來説，我在麗思卡爾頓酒店度過了一段美好的時光，這完全歸功於出色的團隊和卓越的服務。我會珍視這次難忘的經歷，並期待着再次光臨西安麗思卡爾頓酒店。

特別欣賞的是所有前台人員，餐廳服務員，非常有禮貌，親切的招待，特別是第一天遇到的Leo，感覺到真誠。他們的不是像香港 日本的服務員，雖然也有禮貌，但專業的笑容，千篇一律的應對，還是較為冷漠（客觀上講 他們的城市也太急速，沒空招呼每個人）。

我8年沒來西安，驚訝這個城市的發展驚，沒想到變得這麼快 這麼好。下次回來 還來這家酒店

msg:先説結論，非常棒！
之前住過的上海的Riz感覺很好，這次在西安Riz體驗更好，一下子把Riz拉高到我心中酒店第一～
地理位置：不在古城區，所以我帶娃第一晚是住在古城區的酒店，兩個白天把古城區逛完後，第二晚開始入住Riz。交通便利，下樓是地鐵站，雖然沒坐，但我們打的出行去華山和兵馬俑上高速很近。樓下是一個大型商場，超市是Ole，也有葯店，一應俱全。
房間：寬大，舒服，一如既往的高品質，我要誇的一點是隔音非常好，很安靜。洗護用品是Diptyque，廁所是智能馬桶。有浴缸，有淋浴間，淋浴間裏有坐凳。
服務：重點來誇誇了。本人不幸在華山崴了腳回酒店，需要冰敷，餐廳一次次把冰桶送來。打掃衞生的阿姨貼心的多給了方巾給我包冰塊用，還給我拿了很多純凈水。我問客房服務有沒有枴杖可以借，説沒有，衹有輪椅，那就算了。結果沒多久回電我説，給我問到附近葯店有枴杖，可以代購送過來，雖然最後我評估了腳傷沒有買，但真覺得很貼心。他們是真的為客人着想，而不是回答沒有就結束了。另外再誇一下餐廳，room service 送餐都很好，東西好吃，送餐的小姐姐都很體貼。
最後一丟丟遺憾是，才知道是可以保留房卡的，早知道就留做紀念了，555～
西安Riz棒呆～

總之，放假本身就想放鬆，花將近2萬塊，這個服務確實不值得。且距離近點都太太太遠，每天打車來回都要300塊，又非常堵。強烈建議住威斯汀或W吧。勸退！

先説優點：1位置好，酒店小門出來就是中大國際，走10m就是甘家寨地鐵口，吃喝行都方便。2環境好，裝修風格簡潔優雅，房間結構佈局合理。3服務好，要了幾次水和拖鞋都及時送達，臨時指甲劈了，要了剪指刀也及時送來了。
提幾個小缺點：1大床房的床太小了…比我自己家兩米的床還小，一家三口睡着很侷促，建議更換成2.2米大床，適合不能加床的小寶寶家庭出遊。2現在很多酒店已經自動配備一次性浴缸袋了，建議放在浴缸前。3水吧做在了櫃子裏看着很乾凈，但是用起來非常不方便。4房間整體都很乾凈整潔，由於酒店客房沒有可開窗，使房間及樓道的確有異味，開着空調也解決不了的裝修和傢俱的味道，建議做除味處理。

因為西工大母校在附近，也因為了解西安比較好的酒店名單裏有栗子的一席之地，於是留出兩天住在這裏。
房間不大，燈光控制和細節處還算貼心。沙發和圓桌非常實用。洗護用品是蒂普提克無花果系列，酒店裡高端的洗護品牌。衹是香皂很油，不太好洗凈。此外，感謝生日的佈置小驚喜。突然想起去年國慶，廣州塔旁的栗子，同樣是預祝了生日。算是巧合。
酒店禮賓部印象最佳，氣質與服務都很得體。還有早餐餐廳，煮麪區點好後可以離開，隨後服務員會幫忙直接端過來這一舉措也非常點贊。很多酒店都有煮麪區高峯需要傻傻端着碗排隊的問題，但是栗子解決了。所以即使高峯期人流量比較大，用餐還算從容有序。
本來非常想體驗套房，但是沒有雙床套房選擇，加床總會有點不方便。如果有類似上海前灘香格里拉的套房就更好了，客廳沙發晚上可以直接鋪成大床。希望以後出行可以多一些房型選擇。感謝款待。

到達房間看見專門準備的蛋糕和水果，還有歡迎氣球
房間的樓層是26層，可以俯瞰整個高新區的城市景觀
感受到酒店的專業和用心
酒店的硬件很好
床品也很舒服
服務也超級貼心
半夜要充電器，客房服務5分鐘就把充電器送過來了
很喜歡酒店的晚餐，鐵板燒，
而酒店中我最愛的部分，當屬於位於 27層的flair酒吧，作為西安為數不多的高空酒吧，設計十分出彩，分室內室外兩部分，室外部分可270度觀看科技路，夜景，而室內部分，衹需點一杯cocktail，聆聽爵士樂的美妙之聲
旁邊是個大商場，中大國際食逛都超級方便
超級推薦大家去西安住麗思 
從入住到離開無一不體現着工作人員的無微不至服務

不過美中稍顯不足的是初一之後面對基本滿房的情況，整個早餐餐廳座位不是很充足，還是希望以後能有臨時措施予以應對。

住了三晚，房間乾淨整潔，隔音很好，有任何需求也能馬上得到反饋。
一天五頓的行政酒廊，每次過去都會得到真誠的問候，一句歡迎回來讓人覺得十分温馨。遇見最多的是lucy，非常nice的一位小姐姐，不經意的幾句問候讓人覺得心裏暖暖的。酒廊的餐食非常棒，有常規的菜品，也有不少西安美食。如果入住該酒店，強力建議體驗一下他們家的行政酒廊。

到西安是旅遊和看演唱會，開始覺得在高新區是不是位置不太方便，後來發現樓下就是地鐵站，其實坐地鐵出行在西安挺方便的。
預訂到店後升級了三晚臻享房，攜程積分換了三天的雙早。早餐種類豐富，非常不錯。
部分小建議：浴室插頭有壞的，吹風插上沒電；淋浴連接處漏水。酒店不算很舊，但是細節確實還可以再改善，及時檢查、維修或更換硬件設施，才是🌰應有的水準。
總體評價很好，值得入住！

RITZ的奢自是不必多多贅述，而從CICI的工作中是很實在的體現了RITZ的貼心和熱情。“重在細節”不是説説而已。

然後孩子拿了兩個甜甜圈吃不下去，想帶走，服務員告訴我們“浪費了沒事，但是不能給你打包盒，不能帶走。”好在主管給解決了，不然我真的給萬豪寫信了，這是什麼奇葩服務？這是什麼奇葩培訓？我親眼看見她給另一個人打包，難道是我早晨沒化粧看着好欺負嗎？

早餐的麪包味道不錯，種類豐富，且連續去的兩天種類有變化。
水療中心的spa整體也不錯，環境很舒適，香氛是我喜歡的味道，項目很多不過稍有點虛有其表，很多項目看名字不一樣其實內容物雷同，但問題價格卻有挺大差距，希望還是好好精準分類一下。😅

msg:非常差的一次體驗，麗思從未讓我失望，這次的確是過分了，帶着三位長者，要三間房，硬生生給我放在三個不一致的樓層，（而我後面的客户卻被其它前台人員妥妥的安排在了一起，甚至做了升級）服務極差，效率又低，這不應該是麗思，更不是麗思的文化。既沒温度又失去麗思本真的味道，非常不愉快的一次體驗，很糟糕，以後再也不會去了。

西安麗思卡爾頓酒店位於西安高新區核心位置，樓下就是中大國際商業中心。
酒店整體設計低調奢華，藝術感氣息濃郁。
客房面積比較大，設施齊全，衞生細節做得很棒，服務也能夠做到及時周到，彬彬有禮。
早餐品種非常豐富，而且還有具有西安特色的美食。
停車非常方便，酒店有寬敞明亮的地下停車場。
當然，不想開車的話旁邊就是地鐵，非常方便。
絕對算得上是西安奢華酒店代表之一。

1.酒店的前台態度熱情，但不夠真誠，在一些問題的處理上顯得有些業餘。比如，我訂的是大床房，進到房間卻發現是雙床，與前台溝通，前台小姐起初支支吾吾，不知如何是好，後來找來了一位經理層才算是協商了一個解決辦法。當問到房間玩偶是否為贈送時，保潔和前台説法不一致，最後再次致電才給出肯定答案。
2.酒店設施齊備，但是細節上還有欠缺。比如，梳粧台下方沒有垃圾桶，其他地方的垃圾桶也並沒有明顯標識，要不是問了保潔真以為房間衹有衞生間有垃圾桶呢，拖鞋不讓穿到浴室，卻並沒有配備浴室專用的拖鞋，明明是親子房，卻沒有給小孩子準備洗漱用品，跟前台要泡澡袋，衹給一個。這些雖不是什麼重要的事，但卻不如其他五星級酒店做得用心。
3.酒店房間隔音不好，旁邊房間談笑風生，在我們這邊甚至可以聽到談話內容。

1、設施設備一貫的標準，怪不得巴老爺子就是喜歡麗思卡爾頓；
2、出門右轉就是地鐵口，實際上很方便，但是今年五一西安的人太多了，太多太多了，地鐵也解決不了問題，正常情況下交通沒有任何問題。
3、服務一如既往的好，十年前喜歡香格里拉就是因為服務，後來衹要城市裡有麗思卡爾頓，都是首選，有一天身體不舒服，想要一塊姜，泡點水喝，結果送上來的不衹是姜還有煮好的薑湯水。👍👍👍
很晚了送東西的阿姨也很耐心，陳雅琴棒棒的。
4、行政酒廊的午餐、下午茶、夜間酒廊都很不錯，非常值得體驗；酒店熨燙的衣服，絕對乾洗店一級標準。

msg:第一次住西安麗思，還是專門換過來的，整體評價就是非常非常失望。
先説好的，酒店裝修，硬件設施，維護保養都還不錯，純粹五星該有的，很舒服，樓下就是地鐵站，交通也方便，隔壁還有購物中心，這次來下大雨外出鞋打濕了，就全靠這個地方及時換了乾淨的鞋襪。早餐種類很多服務也很好，用餐體驗非常好👍
不好的，最爛的就是服務，首先作為麗思，五星酒店，我們到店連個幫忙推行李的都沒有，而且還是冒着雨我老公推着箱子一路小跑到大門口的，感覺就很不好，但是已經到了就辦理了入住，前台服務還可以，但總感覺是走標準化流程，就是你覺得還是有人跟你説話，但不是服務，因為沒有表情沒有温度…客房服務就不錯，明顯感覺不一樣了，入住了三天兩夜，期間都有去景點，無論出還是進，這個地方好像沒有禮賓部這個部門一樣，從來沒有人來開過車門或者開過門……從兵馬俑回來那個下午也是下雨，打車到酒店門口，連曹操司機都知道開個車門，禮賓部兩個小哥哥站門口就跟雕塑一樣，其中一個看手機，我開了車門就不下車，我就看他過不過來，最後他還是走過來了我也就準備下來了，他看我腿邁出車門了，人家馬上停止了，就是意思你都要下來了我也就不用過去了，我簡直服了
酒店套餐很多，也沒有客服人員大致介紹，歡迎水果説沒有因為套餐不同，我問什麼套餐有，酒店方也説不清，衹能確認我這個沒有，天吶，我沒少花一分錢我的沒有總要告訴我一個理由或者可以得到的通道方式吧。最後值班經理打電話來説還是送一份，其實我想説我並不是一定要這份水果，到走其實我也沒吃完，可是我不應該知道我花了錢和別人的區別在哪裡或者獲悉一份明確各種套餐的區別以供選擇嗎
最後，寫這篇評論我已在西安W，真的是趕緊走的那種感覺，我覺得我就是買了兩張床睡覺，其餘什麼也沒有，此刻我很認真的看了關於西安麗思的大部分評論，很多人也給西安麗思關於服務方面的好評，大部分都是那麼幾位有姓名的人員，個人建議真的可以不要衹是那麼兩三位突出員工，是整體服務意識需要提升，差評裏有一半都是關於禮賓的，難道這麼久，貴酒店領導真的就視而不見，任由發展，還是説我們來需要靠運氣，碰見那幾位受表揚的員工我就住麗思，運氣不好就自生自滅當旅社

整體感受都很好，房間很大，很舒服，就是稍微隔音有點一般，聽得到走廊和附近開門的聲音。  

工作人員服務很好，特別是kayla，因為火車改票到晚上，在酒店房間有空餘的情況下kayla很貼心的幫忙申請了延遲退房，很感謝～
