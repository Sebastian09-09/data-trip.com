msg:A good place for vacation, the room is clean and hygienic, the environment is very good, the store manager and service staff here are very nice, I got up late in the morning and no breakfast, my aunt cooked noodles for me overnight, it was delicious, and the lunch at noon was also very good It’s delicious, and you can do handicrafts. It’s fun. It’s not easy to take a taxi here to go to other attractions. The store manager drove us there personally. Thank you very much! I had a lot of fun this time and will come again if I have the chance!

msg:The environment of the room is very good, especially at night, when the lights bloom among the deep mountains, it is very beautiful.
There is no hot spring. Are you saying it is being repaired? !
The water in the swimming pool was dirty and cold.
The surrounding supporting facilities are basically not yet formed.
The best thing is that it is really quiet and far away from the world. It is especially suitable for the whole family to lie down during the holidays. The children like it very much and find it very novel.

msg:The overall service awareness is still lacking. No housekeeper took the initiative to carry the luggage, and no one contacted before check-in;
There was hair in the room, and the hygiene was a bit worrying;
A small souvenir was given;
The waiters were quite honest, the breakfast lady was very enthusiastic, but lacked professional training, and the kitchen could allow guests to enter and exit, which was a bit worrying.
The room is relatively new and has just opened;

I can swim with my children. I am very happy just thinking about it. The handmade steamed buns for breakfast are really delicious, and the aunties are very warm and thoughtful. I like it 😘

There are few types of breakfast, but the fried dough sticks and soy milk taste good. Overall, the services provided by the hotel at this price are... The corresponding facilities do not match at all

msg:The advantages are that there is a mountain forest, the environment is good, and the service staff is very friendly. The disadvantages are that there is no supporting facilities, there is a simple breakfast, and there are no other dishes for lunch and dinner. There is only a very simple small hot pot, otherwise you have to drive out to eat. The triangular wooden house you live in is hot during the day and cold at night. It feels that it has just started operating and is not very mature. The price on May Day is really not worth it.

It was suitable for a weekend vacation. The hotel service was also very good. It was clean and hygienic. Super high rating. I will come again if I have the chance.
