Environment: There was a nice flower scent downstairs, and the car could be parked directly next to the building, which was very convenient.

Facilities: The executive suite we booked was very spacious, but some of the facilities were a bit old. The lighting in one of the bedrooms was a bit dim, the water pressure in the shower was insufficient, and the shower head fell off halfway through the shower.

The children also participated in the Green Art Education activity in the morning and learned about legumes. They told us a lot of plant knowledge on the way back. Thank you very much for the hotel's attentive service! The front desk clerk was very enthusiastic and thoughtful. The staff at the swimming pool was very responsible. I had something to return to the room, and he took care of the children throughout the whole process. I felt very relieved. The children didn't want to go back to bed until 21:40.

msg:It's a rare vacation, and it's the first time for my child to stay in a hotel for travel. The main reason is that my child said he wanted a hotel with a swimming pool, so I chose this one. First of all, the executive housing room type of this hotel is just right for my family of three people and one child. This room type is in a three-story building, with two households per elevator and a parking space at the door. Hotel guests can park for free, and there are charging piles, which is very friendly to new energy self-driving. We live in a two-bedroom, one-living room, one kitchen and two bathrooms, with a bathtub and a smart toilet. It is very suitable for the number of people in my family, and the hotel community environment and sketches are particularly good. The scenery is excellent at night, and the background is very beautiful with the Jingu Bang. There are not many people in the off-season, and my child and I like it very much. The hotel's constant temperature swimming pool and gym are free to use when staying in the hotel. The key is that there is a children's bathtub with a water temperature of 30-33 degrees, which is suitable for little friends to play in the water. The key is that it is clean and there are few people. Secondly, the hotel service is really considerate. Knowing that I am bringing a child, I specially chose a first floor, a quiet location, and the landscape pool is outside the balcony. And every time I go swimming, they will help us heat up the children's pool in advance, and even if I swim alone, someone will watch to ensure safety. Finally, the location of the hotel is behind a business hotel. It is very quiet overall, close to various attractions or food, and very convenient to take a taxi or order takeout. So if you come to Binhai New Area and want to stay in a hotel with quality, few people, and good food and travel, welcome to this hotel.

Service: The service is thoughtful, and there are also plant experts who take children to visit the plants in the park and explain various plants. It is very beneficial

Overall, all aspects are good, except that the bed is too small. It is rare to see a 1.5-meter bed in a large hotel now

msg:Regarding the environment, Green Mansion is a villa for sale, equipped with a renovated hotel, and the environment is more suitable for accommodation.
Noise, the renovated hotel has poor soundproofing facilities. The water splashing in the shower upstairs was very loud, lasting for more than ten minutes, and could be heard in the middle of the night. You can hear people walking and talking in the corridor across the room, and the TV is quite noisy, so it is not suitable for customers who are light sleepers.
The service is extremely poor and very unpleasant. The hotel service is the kind that is not professional in hotel service. You know, it is just a formality and many things are not considered thoroughly. For example, the check-in process is not considerate enough, the service staff teamwork is poor, the customer's impatience with long waiting times cannot be detected in time, and early detection and early processing cannot be achieved. The worst thing is that there is breakfast on the cooperation page with Ctrip, and you are given a dining card when you check in. You are not reminded that there is no breakfast during the whole process. The breakfast and meals are already on the table. It tells you that there is no meal, which delays the meal arrangement too much, even if you are in the middle. Just a reminder, you can also arrange time and so on. It's very unpleasant, but Ctrip deserves praise for providing processing subsidies in a timely manner to calm the mood.

From the service to the hardware facilities in the room, everything is OK. When I checked in this time, it had been renamed Greenwood Hotel. The previous team had all been replaced. The room that cost more than 1,000 a night no longer included breakfast. In addition to the installation of access control facilities, the house was slightly outdated. The master bedroom The floor drain in the bathroom of the second bedroom is blocked in various ways, the shower nozzle is different, and when you take a shower with water at the same time, there will be insufficient water pressure and uneven distribution of hot and cold water. This has never happened when I checked in in the past. A new big earth that glows blue has been added to the park's scenery. The morning glories on the windowsill have become a thing of the past. The lawn mower has changed from an amiable person to a hateful one... There are so many changes that it is impossible to forget. I have gone through them one by one. The only thing that has not changed is that the Binhai New Area landmark building directly opposite the park has been completed. I prefer to call it the Bullet Tower.

At this price, you can live in two bedrooms and one living room, and there is a swimming pool, gym and children’s play area. Although the facilities are not new, they are maintained by dedicated personnel everywhere. The restaurant that provides breakfast mainly provides meals for foreign workers in Tianjin. The hygiene and taste are very good, and it is not far from the Internet celebrity library and the fort. I really recommend it to friends traveling with children! If it weren't for the fact that school was about to start, I would have really wanted to stay a few more days just for the clean and less crowded swimming pool!

The location of the hotel is excellent, the environment is very quiet and fashionable
The room was tidy, and the front desk and cleaning services were particularly good.

A few shortcomings, only my own opinion
1. When we checked in, we clearly heard that the other party was unwilling to check out, so they changed the room for us. Although the room was not inappropriate in any way, I don’t think we should compromise.
2. When I went through the check-out procedures and refunded the deposit, I asked my roommate to do it for me because we were not in the hotel since we were going to sea. The front desk remotely asked me to take screenshots of the collection code and payment code (the system prompted that it could not be provided). Our friends must have been waiting at the front desk for a long time, because I heard that they were repeating orders one by one.
3. I consider myself not a picky person. God knows that a person who falls asleep as soon as he touches the pillow has insomnia. It turned out that the pillow was too low and uncomfortable. We applied to the hotel for extra pillows but they were too high and the bed was not that comfortable, but I can't figure out the reason. The environment is really good.

This review is really out of the hope that the hotel will get better and better. I personally still listen to recommendations and will visit again.

Although the samples are not dazzling, they have both Chinese and Western dishes. It's delicious! I like the cold salad dishes, fresh and delicious! The main thing is to pick your favorite dishes and mix them yourself, it’s delicious! The environment is really nice! ! I will live here when I go to Tianjin in the future! ! ! Just to mention, the doorman is very responsible, and the service staff at the front desk and breakfast are very enthusiastic! ! Really recommended! But those who like luxurious decoration can consider it! Everything else is fine! The decoration is really average! ! The first comment to write so much! ! ! ! !
