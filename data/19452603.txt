The service was excellent esp my housekeeper‘ Jeong soo Juan’ was very helpful and assisted us well with room change as they gave us a room which wasn’t same like the one I booked so I asked for a change and she helped with it, she was also proactive in calling the golf cart to and from room to restaurant and lobby :) overall, I had a decent stay and May like to return back :)

msg:We had a very satisfactory experience during this stay. First of all, we would like to thank the housekeeper Xiaoyan for her professional and timely service, which solved many of our problems.
Secondly, the working attitude of all the staff of the hotel is very enthusiastic, which we are very satisfied with. In terms of food and beverage, the only drawback is that the mapo tofu and bamboo shoots meatballs in Shuixieju are not consistent with the pictures and texts, and the taste is slightly unsatisfactory. However, the rice crust fish, cabbage vermicelli and curry shrimp on the second night were all very delicious, which added a lot to our dining experience.
The hot spring facilities are also very good, the environment is clean and tidy, giving people a comfortable and relaxing feeling. However, there are too many mosquitoes in the hot spring area, which affects the overall experience.
Finally, it is recommended that the hotel can open a taxi reservation service, because many five-star hotels have this service, which will further enhance the convenience and satisfaction of customers. Overall, this stay was very pleasant and we will consider visiting again.

msg:A family of four came to Anji for a three-day vacation. This time, we chose Anji Hantian Resort.
I had stayed at Hantian Resort in Jurong, Zhenjiang before, and I had a good impression. The first place in the review ranking search was also Anji Hantian Resort, so I chose this hotel.
Before departure, the housekeeper Xiaoyan added us on WeChat and sent us various instructions, hotel travel guides and facilities in advance. The service was very considerate.
I had almost 8 meals in the hotel's Chinese restaurant. Whether it was a buffet breakfast or ordering dishes for lunch and dinner, the dishes were very good and I was very satisfied with the food.
The hotel room type is also very good. I opened the window and sat on the balcony, surrounded by green. There was also a window on the left side of the room. At night, the green outside and the lights were really full of a**osphere.
The hotel shuttle bus is also very convenient. Whether it is to go to the mountaintop cafe or to visit the Tea Expo Park for tea, the service is very good and available at any time.
The hotel environment and service are very good. I recommend the mahjong room and KTV room. It is really a one-stop service for eating, drinking and having fun. The experience is particularly good. I will come here for vacation with my family next year and I am very satisfied.

The housekeeper Xiaoyan is very considerate. She is always there when needed. She also provided a clothes drying rack on the balcony when she saw that it was inconvenient to dry clothes.
The room originally had a Hanfu experience, and the front desk took the initiative to give an extra copy. The photographer was very patient and professional. After the shooting, he adjusted the photos according to the requirements and was very satisfied.
Children's bathrobes and toiletries are provided separately.
The viewing platform on the top of the mountain is in a good location, but the tea garden was not too lush at that time, and the scenery on the top of the mountain was still good. Afternoon tea is OK, eat the environment.
The swimming pool is not open, and you have to wait until the summer vacation.
The restaurant environment and dishes are OK. Children like to feed small fish and swans after meals.

Food: The Western restaurant feels that there is nothing to eat, and the Chinese restaurant is okay, but I think it can be appropriately increased. The breakfast is quite rich

Housekeeper: The housekeeper Xiaoyan answered all questions and provided very good service

Facilities: After taking a hot spring bath, I suggest that the water be heated up a little. Although the weather is hot, there is no bubble in water over 30 degrees; the room environment is OK, the hygiene is good, the bed is comfortable and soft enough, and it is strongly recommended to match it with a disposable bath bag. If you have a toilet cover, can't you also match it with a bath bag (laughing and crying) That sound therapy singing bowl, um...how to say it, I feel it is meaningless. I suggest that the chair inside be replaced with a softer one, or you match it with a headrest, otherwise it is uncomfortable to lie down on it. It's hard

msg:After struggling for several days and looking at many hotels, I still locked on this one because it has a high cost-effectiveness. I also looked at other platforms and finally found Ctrip to be the most cost-effective. Now the trip is over. I can responsibly say that it is a really good vacation. They didn't let me comment. The main experience was so pleasant that I came to comment. Here are the details:
1. Service: It's really too good. There are really enthusiastic staff everywhere. Very confident and thoughtful service. I won't expand on the details because there are too many
2. The room is really big, and there is a big balcony. The sanitation is also clean and the decoration is also new
3. The surrounding scenery is beautiful, you can also climb the mountain, and the air is fresh
4. The Hanfu experience is also super good, and the effect of the photo is super beautiful. In order to protect privacy, I won't post pictures. Many people take photos of Hanfu, all kinds of styles, all beautiful, super like 😍
To sum up, it is worth experiencing, especially if you want to take photos of Hanfu! If you come in April, it will probably be more beautiful. It's all tea gardens, but the tea season is over now

The only shortcoming is that there is no small stool for children to wash, and it would be better if the washing is upgraded!

There are stairs outside the mountaintop coffee shop to go up the mountain to see the tea bushes and breathe fresh air. My father, mother and sister are all very satisfied! The price is also very favorable if you book the room in advance. It’s great! !

There is also a white tea museum and hot springs inside. This sky bubble hot spring is quite suitable. Children like the game consoles and trampolines next to the lobby the most. It feels like they can play in the hotel all day 😀, but there are more insects in the mountains, so it is recommended to bring relevant insect repellent spray

It is a bit regrettable that the sound insulation of the room is not very good. There is a little noise during the day, but it is very quiet at night. There are also too many mosquitoes. I dare not stay on the balcony for too long, but there is no way to enjoy the pastoral life with many mosquitoes. Overall it is worth recommending!

The hotel resort is in the form of a mountain. The tea garden, mountains, streams, hot springs, mountaintop swimming pools and pavilions are integrated with nature. There are scenery at every step, and you can sit quietly for a long time anywhere. Feeling the natural scenery can also gain a moment of peace of mind and leisure.
The bedding and catering are very textured, and the new hotel decoration is very design-oriented. You can buy whatever you want to eat.
I didn't go to the outdoor children's playground because the kids played table tennis, billiards, and trampoline for a long time after the hot spring. The next day, I visited the Tea Expo Park and took photos of Hanfu, and there was no time to play other things.
In the summer vacation, I called a few friends to book a cliff villa. The adults played cards and the kids swam. It should be very comfortable. I hope the price will be more affordable.

The hotel room is very large, with two 1.5-meter double beds, which is very friendly for a family with two children. The only thing that needs to be improved is the toilet cover. The material is too cold. Either replace the cover, or the curtain is electric, which can only be fully opened or fully closed, and cannot stay in any position. This is very incomprehensible.

The hot springs are not that big. There is also a children's amusement park next to it. There are peacocks, squirrels and parrots. The only shortcoming is that the open-air yellow sand pit is a bit dirty. At night, I also experienced singing bowl sound therapy. The girl followed me and returned it. I fell asleep and laughed to death. The next day, I tried out Hanfu. The girl took a set. It happened that I hadn’t taken any photos recently. I saved several photos for 30 yuan each. The family group said the photos were good. After checking out, I went to feed the koi in the lake. I went to the game arcade in the lobby with Duck and played for a long time.

msg:We booked a twin room, which was very big and had very good air. We chose this place mainly because my wife has severe allergies and wanted to relax here! We had no idea that this place gave us a very good feeling! There are shuttle buses from the lobby to Yaju, the restaurant, the parking lot, the tea museum, etc. The hotel's catering must be praised. There are many varieties of breakfast, which is great value! The dishes in the Chinese restaurant are also good, and the price is not expensive! The hotel's hot springs have a total of seven pools, which are not many but enough! A dip is enough to relieve fatigue. The hotel's service staff are also very enthusiastic. Although it was only a short 2 nights, we fell in love with this place! I look forward to going to Anji Hantian Resort Hotel again next time.

msg:The service is very good, the scenery is pleasant, and it is a holiday and health resort. I stayed for two nights. On the first night, we ate at the Chinese restaurant. The 6 people ate for more than 600 yuan. The taste was great and the price-performance ratio was very high. On the second night, we ate Western Teppanyaki, which cost 350 yuan per person. You need to make an appoin**ent in advance. The dishes are well made. The overall service is very good, and you can see that the management is very good! Several bosses are very satisfied. They will come again for the next party. Great.

Two adults and one child slept very comfortably~ Although there were some problems at the beginning of the room check-in, there was no electricity in the room (but an engineer was quickly found to repair and solve it). There are inevitably mosquitoes in the mountains, and electric mosquito repellent was prepared, which was very considerate💗 I checked in and experienced the hotel hot spring ♨️ Hanfu and the white tea museum~ It was great~ I have to say that the ladies in the hotel are all beautiful and pleasing to the eye, and the service attitude is so cute! It can definitely be included as one of the hotels I will stay in again~

msg:The room is relatively large. There is an outdoor swimming pool on the viewing platform on the cliff, but it is only open in summer. There is a coffee bar next to it, and there are resident singers in the afternoon and evening. The resort has its own hot springs, with 5 hot springs and dry steam rooms. The advantage is that there are not many people and you can soak in it. There is a white tea museum next to the hotel, which has paid items. This time I experienced digging bamboo shoots, picking tea and frying tea. The coupons issued by the hotel front desk can be used for 30 yuan. Each person can dig 2 bamboo shoots and take them home. Picking tea for 40 minutes + frying tea for more than half an hour. The final product is just a little bit, and the fun is an experience. The restaurant's pork knuckle tastes good, and the other dishes are neither good nor bad. I drank white tea beer, and it seems that there is a little bit of white tea flavor. There are 2 kinds of rice balls for breakfast, sweet and salty, and the sweet ones taste better. The overall feeling is good, and I can come again next time.

However, Aunt Jiang Lan specially added extra time for us to soak for a while, and also poured tea for us and accompanied us. The aunt in the hot spring locker room was also very nice, and kept asking us to slow down and not to rush. In order to soak in the hot spring again the next afternoon, we specially changed the high-speed rail ticket. The housekeeper Tiantian helped us to delay the check-out, basically meeting all our requests. In the end, we couldn't get a taxi when we left, and the lady at the front desk took us down the mountain after work. In short, it was a perfect experience! I hope I can come again next time if I have the chance!

This time I didn't deliberately choose a hotel, I just arranged it near the Anji Music Festival. The traffic jam on the holiday was not a problem, and the experience of staying here was beyond my expectations.

Room facilities:
The room is not small, with two large beds and comfortable bedding. The next day, I opened the curtains and saw a towering bamboo forest and the fragrance of grass. I was satisfied.
Breakfast:
The environment facing the lake is good, with not many varieties, and the dinner rolls, coffee, salads, etc. are average; but the rice balls are the best I have eaten recently. The old lady uses glutinous rice to wrap the fried dough sticks, both sweet and salty. I put a little rice sugar, which is great.
A place where you can embrace nature without going to crowded attractions is worth coming again.

The breakfast was much richer, and the service was more meticulous. Especially the housekeeper service was improved to a higher level. I realized what super five-star service is. Our housekeeper Xiaoyan was our housekeeper when we came last year, and she is still our housekeeper this year. Her service is very thoughtful.

In short, the butler service is well-deserved and makes me eager to come to Hantian again next time.

My experience has been attracted by its unparalleled charm from the moment I checked in, especially every detail from the environment, facilities, services to catering, which is unforgettable.
The environment is the number one selling point of this hotel. Set amidst lush tea mountains, the hotel is surrounded by rolling hills and endless tea plantations, allowing you to enjoy the tranquility of nature.
In terms of facilities, every design of the hotel reflects the thoughtful consideration for guests. The spacious rooms were equipped with modern furniture and technology, ensuring that my stay was both comfortable and convenient. In addition, the hotel has a wide range of leisure facilities such as activity rooms and outdoor hot springs. Whether I want to maintain my daily exercise habits or simply relax, the hotel can meet my needs.
In terms of service, the hotel staff is undoubtedly its valuable asset. Not only were they professional and enthusiastic, their attention to detail was impressive. From the welcome at the front desk to the daily cleaning of the guest rooms, the service staff used their u**ost professionalism and sincerity to ensure that I was comfortable and happy throughout the journey. It is particularly worth mentioning that the hotel housekeeper Xiaoyan was able to provide personalized services according to my needs, which made me feel distinguished and extraordinary trea**ent.

Regarding dining, the hotel’s food is also a highlight. Including local specialty snacks, Huaiyang cuisine, Cantonese cuisine and other diversified menus, which can meet the needs of various tastes.

Not only can you taste delicious food, but you can also enjoy koi, ducks, and black swans while enjoying the food, which adds a lot of romance.

To sum up, this resort hotel with the tea mountain as its background is extremely satisfying in terms of environment, facilities, services and catering. Not only is it an ideal place to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life and seek tranquility and relaxation, it is also an excellent choice to enjoy a high-quality life. I look forward to visiting this paradise hidden among mountains and rivers again in the near future.

I really like this feeling of relaxing facing the green mountains. The Zhuyun Hot Spring is the specialty of this hotel and is indeed worth experiencing. The hotel has also arranged a costume experience. There are many costumes to choose from. The stylist will help you with your hair style. Hanfu photographer Xiao Zou will follow you throughout the whole process. The shooting effect is very good and the film is brilliant.
There are also singing bowl classes available in the evening to help relax the body and mind. There are also hiking trails around the hotel, allowing you to experience the tea fields up close without being crowded, giving you a sense of winding paths leading to seclusion.
The hotel services and facilities are also very satisfactory. The housekeeper communicated on WeChat one day in advance and recommended activities that can be done in the hotel. If there are any questions, he will follow up at any time. The room service is also responsive. If the air conditioner is a bit hot, he will send a fan. If you need to dry your swimsuits, a clothes drying rack will be delivered to you, and the shuttle service will respond quickly.
Finally, I have two small suggestions: One is that the changing room of the hot spring is relatively small and crowded during holidays, so it can be optimized. Second, you can add some Anji specialties to breakfast to enhance the experience. Third, electric vehicles can be used for shuttle buses. The smell of oil-powered vehicles is not very good, which destroys the fresh air around the hotel.
Overall, the experience is very good. I also like the Yunju guest room this time. I will come back next time when I have time~

The scenery is extremely beautiful. The bamboo forest in Anji is swaying in the mist, and the lake and sky are the same color, making it a perfect scene. After breakfast with my family, we walked and climbed mountains in the clouds and mist. We felt relaxed and happy, and the fresh air moistened our hearts. It earned the reputation of "Forest Oxygen Bar".
Let’s talk about what’s special about the resort. The environment is elegant and comfortable, and the service attitude is the other. Every staff member we met showed enthusiasm, tolerance and respect, from the thoughtful introduction by the butler when entering, to the free coffee and tea when leaving. It makes people feel the warmth of being in a foreign land. The third is special activities, such as renting Hanfu to take pictures and play in the mountains and forests, the light fountain at night, the special hot springs to recuperate the body and mind, the carefully built tea culture museum, the ducks on the sparkling water, the quiet and elegant mountain trails, and calm the mind. The special sound therapy is rich in activities and enjoyable, and there is no additional charge. The fourth thing that surprised me the most is that I am a music lover. I met two singers from the Philippines in a cafe on the top of the mountain. Their singing skills are really good. Their mastery of English songs is far better than that of domestic singers. Moreover, the two singers also It's really admirable to be able to perform Chinese songs so wonderfully. The two singers actively interacted with the audience. I was lucky enough to go on stage to sing with the two singers. I couldn't help but sigh: The enthusiasm of Anji Hantian Resort knows no boundaries. . The fifth is the special delicacies. I was lucky enough to taste Anji’s bamboo shoots and white tea, which are amazing! I love tea and bamboo shoots in my family. The meals and tea for the past two days were so appetizing. The prices were affordable and the ingredients were fresh. Get up with the morning light, open the curtains and you will see a sea of ​​bamboo forest, hazy in the morning light, rest at sunset, lie in the outdoor hot spring in the dim lights, all the fatigue and worries will disappear in an instant, everything will be silent, go back to the room Then he fell asleep peacefully. I have been to some similar resorts, all of which have beautiful scenery and excellent infrastructure, but none of them have left me with such memorable memories as Anji Hantian Resort. I wanted to write less but couldn't stop. I think this is inseparable from the enthusiasm and kindness of Anji people, as well as the little surprises everywhere in the hotel. I would like to see you again.

msg:It was a very happy trip. Special thanks to the housekeeper Tiantian for his enthusiastic service. Because the Tianmu Lake Hantian Resort where I stayed last year had a very good image, I chose Anji Hantian Resort this year. The breakfast was very rich and the food at Shuixieju was delicious and clean. It was hygienic. The waiters were very warm and polite. We originally booked a six-day trip, but we had to go home a day early due to family matters. Ctrip and Hantiansha Hotel quickly checked us out, and the room fee was refunded at the original price. Special thanks to! ! I will choose your Hantian Resort again next time.

Hygiene: The hotel is very clean. I went out to have breakfast and the room was very clean when I came back. (Interlude: My son had a nosebleed at night and soiled the quilt and pillow, but he quickly cleaned it up the next morning)
Environment: Sitting in the tea mountains, the air is really great, the weather is also very good, you can take a stroll in the tea mountains at any time;
Service: What I must mention during this trip is the hotel's service. It is so attentive and considerate. Every time the timely feedback is reassuring, all requests are answered, thumbs up👍

msg:The room is large, 50 square meters, with a bamboo forest outside the window. Unfortunately, there is a roof that blocks part of the view. Welcome fruits and all kinds of tea, coffee and drinks are provided for free, which is very heartwarming.
Don’t go out, just have fun and eat at the resort. Soaking in hot springs, climbing mountains, visiting the White Tea Museum, walking through the bamboo forest, taking photos in Hanfu, singing in a cafe in the evening, and experiencing singing bowls, it was really fulfilling!
The included breakfast is also a great value, so you can eat it later. Lunch was saved😄
Feeding the swans and fish after the meal was very pleasant.
Come back by car in the future. You can also visit the surrounding attractions.
Thanks for the coffee before leaving, it was a great experience!

The hotel is on a mountain, with tea gardens, bamboo forests, and hot springs, and the scenery is pleasant. The Hanfu experience was great and I took satisfying photos, especially taking photos in the snow. The housekeeper Xiaoyan is attentive and reminds us of various hotel activities every day. The breakfast in the Chinese restaurant is also very good. If there is anything that can be improved, I personally think the hot spring changing room can be expanded.

It would be better if it was sunny, but we had a snowy day, and it would be nice to build a snowman at the door or something like that!
There are 7 hot spring pools in the evening. The water still feels quite hot. The hot spring is 39-42 degrees. I met like-minded ladies and chatted for a long time while soaking in the hot spring. Hahaha

Shuixieju serves buffet breakfast and a la carte lunch and dinner. The breakfast options are rich, and the a la carte dishes at lunch and dinner are also delicious. During my stay, I also experienced singing bowl sound therapy, white tea museum, and climbed a tea mountain to breathe fresh air. Overall it's a great place for a weekend getaway.

msg:Hantian Resort is a hotel chain.
The resort in Anji was chosen to be surrounded by tea mountains, with the original intention of creating a paradise-like mood. Facilities: There is a hot spring halfway up the mountain♨️; Japanese style structure; hardware facilities are OK.
Flaws that need to be pointed out:
1. The artificial lake at the entrance lacks artistic conception. The row of restaurants by the lake have practical architecture; but the aesthetics are too poor; they are consistent with the aesthetics of the farmhouses of crab farmers in Yangcheng Lake, Jiangsu.
2. The room is a Japanese-style structure; but the area is small; the structural design aesthetics are also similar to ordinary hotels.
3. The faucet of the washbasin is too short; it is inconvenient to wash hands.

Overall; compared with the resorts in Tianmu Lake, the scenery and temperament are one level lower. Japanese style can be learned from. But the Japanese style shows "little family spirit".

As a five-star resort. What a sigh of relief.

1. For the tatami room type you chose, the hotel prepared fruits, tea, coffee, etc. It is very comfortable to watch movies at night😌
2. Stay for two nights and get breakfast for two nights. It is rich and delicious. After eating, you will receive two packs of food at the front desk to feed the swans and koi. They rushed over as soon as they saw the food.
3. Take a walk in Tea Mountain and watch the snow scenery
4. Go experience the singing bowl at night, which is also given by the hotel.
5. I took a photo of Hanfu during the day the next day. The experience is free, and the styling is also free. You can let the photographer in the store take photos. The photos are free. You only need 30 photos to take away. I bought a few good-looking ones ~
6. For dinner, we went to a town not far away to eat skewers. It was very cheap.
7. Finally, I went to the hot spring. It was not cold at all. Even though it was the end of December, I had warm ginger water to drink after I soaked in it. The staff inside were very kind and told everyone to be careful about falling. There was an aunt. Helped my boyfriend and I adjust the temperature of the jjimjilbang, as we were worried that we might overheat when we went in just after running.
8. The hotel has billiards, table tennis and other facilities, which is very fun.
9. I was so happy at the resort for two days🥳On the day I left, I went to a heritage park provided by the hotel and took a walk🚶🚶
10. Come again next time! ! !

It is very convenient to have battery cars to pick you up and down the top of the mountain. When we checked in, the front desk helped us upgrade to a room with a balcony, so we could watch the sunrise in the morning. There are many free things in the room freezer, as well as welcome fruits. The resort's security guards, room attendants, and restaurant waiters are all very polite and friendly. We had two dinners at the resort's restaurant. It was not expensive. The four of us had about 400 per meal. We had a good meal. The dishes were cooked well and tasted good. Breakfast was very rich. Individual guests and groups dine in different restaurants, which is a better arrangement! There are seven pools in the resort, and I soaked in hot springs twice, which was okay.

The hotel lobby and parking lot are halfway up the mountain. Yajufang has to take the short-term parking in the hotel to the top of the mountain, and all travel requires short-term parking.

Cleanliness: spotless. Everywhere in the hotel is clean, especially the restaurant and rooms.
Environment: There are seven outdoor hot spring pools, but because there were too many people during the winter holiday weekend, we didn't go.
Service: It can be seen that every staff member of the hotel is serving attentively, especially the staff member Xiaoyan. The day before check-in, Xiaoyan will contact you and inform you of some precautions. If anything happens during check-in, you can directly find Xiaoyan, which provides convenience for guests.
A resort full of sincerity, I will come again next time!

I will still consider Hantian when I come to hot springs this time.
Breakfast is in a row of houses with beautiful night views. The light is very good, which is very suitable for taking pictures. The breakfast is quite rich. I almost have everything I like.
This trip was a little rushed, so I didn’t use the white tea tour tickets I received. I’ll stay there for two days next time.

First of all, let’s talk about the advantages. To be honest, I don’t have much expectations for service in a hotel like a resort. However, this hotel does a good job in service. Whether it is the lobby staff, restaurant waiters or cleaning staff, The aunts have a very good attitude and will take the initiative to say hello and come forward to ask if they need help, making them feel at home. The surrounding environment of the hotel is good, there are tea gardens, you can also take their shuttle bus to the top of the mountain to see the scenery, and they also gave you a Hanfu experience coupon. This is very attractive to girls. Anyway, I wore Hanfu and shot around the hotel for more than an hour, and the film was finished. Outstanding. In addition, the farm food in the hotel restaurant is delicious and the breakfast is also very rich, which is also satisfactory. After talking about the advantages, let’s talk about the disadvantages. The only disadvantage is that the hot springs are really average. There are very few pools (there seem to be only 7) and even fewer pools with moderate temperatures (several of them are above 41 degrees, very hot). The hot spring scenery It is not as good as Tianmu Lake Hantian. If you come here specifically to soak in the hot springs, there is no need.

There are many activities in the resort. After breakfast, you can ask the staff for fish food to feed the fish, ducks, and swans; the hiking trails are very scenic; the Teppanyaki is also very unique; the Hanfu experience far exceeded my expectations, photographer Xiao Zou is very good at taking pictures and the price is very cost-effective.
It was snowing in Anji when I came here. I watched the snow scene in the resort and experienced a different feeling on a sunny day the next day. It's a pity that I didn't go to experience the hot spring due to physical reasons. I will come again if I have the opportunity to experience the scenery in other seasons.

There were not many hot spring pools, but they were enough. It was very comfortable after soaking. After breakfast the next morning, we fed the fish and swans, and then played football and Frisbee on the large lawn in front of the hotel, which is especially suitable for walking children.

The second time I booked two rooms with three of my best friends. This time I wanted to find a place to stay for my best friends’ birthday, so I chose Anji Hantian! In this weather, it rains a lot. Is there anything more comfortable than staying in a hotel on the mountain? Although the hotel is not new, the service, room configuration and scenery are totally outstanding! From the moment you book the hotel, you will be contacted by the butler via WeChat for service. After arriving at the hotel, I didn’t leave the hotel for 3 days! Taiai Shuixie Restaurant is not as expensive as ordinary hotels. The per capita consumption is more than 100, but the food is really delicious. After waking up, we had a breakfast and lunch buffet at the hotel, and went to the Waterside Restaurant in the evening. We went to a hot spring on the first night, and a singing bowl for healing on the second night. This is my first experience. I don’t know if it heals me or not, but I feel really good sleeping. The front desk also gave me a coupon for afternoon tea at the top of the mountain, and asked the front desk to help call a sightseeing bus. I feel like I don’t need to bring any clothes to Hantian, just pajamas and hotel slippers for the whole journey! Next time I plan to take my kids there, there is a swimming pool, hot spring, and an outdoor amu*****t park, and then I can go see the tea garden experience. It seems that there is also a Hanfu experience that would be good. It is said that TV is also updating smart TV, which is even better! Very very good hotel! For my best friend’s birthday, I also gave her a 6-inch cake. Thank you to the housekeeper Yanyan...

I didn't leave the hotel for two days, but I still didn't have time to go to many places. Mom had a great time and the stay was comfortable. Anji Hantian is really a great choice for a flat trip 😉

msg:A colleague has lived in Hantian before and thought it was good, so he came here at the end of the summer vacation.
There are very few cars on the road from the highway to the front of the hotel. The green mountains and green waters are really very relaxing. The little brother at the door can help carry the luggage. We only stayed for two nights and didn't have any luggage, so we chose to drive directly to the parking lot. There are several parking lots, so you don’t have to worry about being full and running out of space.
We booked a little yellow duck themed room. The room was full of cute little yellow ducks, and there was also a small tent. Our ten-year-old child was very happy.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon we chose to soak in the hot spring. There were few people and the weather was good. Looking at the mountains in the distance and admiring the bamboo forest by the pool, we forgot all the hustle and bustle of the city and all the trivial things in life. After the mountain top pool opens at three o'clock, you can go to the mountain pool to play. There are not many people and it is very enjoyable. When you are tired from playing, you can take a rest and admire the tea mountains as far as the eye can see.
After taking a shower, you can go to the Chinese restaurant on the first floor to eat. The price-performance ratio for dinner is pretty good and worth trying. Fried rice and pork knuckles are very good. The bamboo is also very fresh, and it feels delicious without any seasoning.
If it rains at night, you can play table tennis and trampoline in the playroom.
The butler will contact you one day in advance to inform you of the business hours of various places on the route. If you need to go up the mountain or go to the Tea Expo, it is very convenient to contact the front desk or just talk to the housekeeper.
The overall value for money is very good, the service is very friendly, and the environment is very good. I can come again next year.

It was raining that day, and there was a little brother at the door to help with the umbrella and carry the luggage. The lady at the front desk was very polite and smiled throughout the check-in process. Service, because I received a rose when I checked in on Qixi Festival. During the two days of entering and leaving the hotel, all the staff members will smile and say hello politely. The dishes in the restaurant are not bad. After the meal, you can get fish food to feed the fish, ducks and swans. I didn’t go to experience the hot springs due to hardware reasons. Instead, I went to the mountaintop coffee for afternoon tea. The taste is not bad. There are staff at every point in the hotel. You can ask the staff to call a shuttle bus to pick you up wherever you want. The waiting time is very long It's short, the car will arrive within a minute or two. There are children's playgrounds, game consoles, table tennis, billiards, and board games indoors. You won't be bored even if it rains. After breakfast the next day, I took some fish food to feed the fish. The children liked it very much, and they will come again next time.

msg:The hotel is 20 minutes' drive from the high-speed rail station and the transportation is very convenient. After checking in, the housekeeper Xiaoyan greeted me thoughtfully, and informed me of all the details of the hotel and introduced the hotel's services. The thoughtful and timely service throughout the entire process was very considerate! In addition to well-equipped entertainment activities, the hotel also provides detailed introduction to surrounding attractions. Whether you stay in the hotel to relax and breathe oxygen, or go for a spin in nearby scenic spots, it is a very good choice. I have stayed in other resort hotels, but Hantian's meticulousness is impressive. The lady in the restaurant will remind you to cool down and keep warm, and will enthusiastically introduce the source of the hotel's tea aroma. The doorman and security uncle are not only responsible for safety, but can also tell you a little story about the stone in front of the hotel while you are waiting for the bus. The waiters at the mountain top cafe will also They will take the initiative to help call the car back to the residence, as well as the tour bus driver and the aunt who cleans the room. I am very lucky to meet every hotel staff during this trip. They are super patient and lovely! The Tea Museum in Hantian is also highly recommended. The long-standing tea culture allows busy people to feel calm and peaceful in the tea ceremony. Overall, this is my third visit to Anji. The experience and service at Hantian exceeded expectations. I will come back again!

msg:Very nice hotel, went for the hotel's hot spring. The hot spring is really good. I heard that the spring water is changed every day, so it is closed in the morning.
But what’s even more surprising is the Hanfu shooting and the White Tea Museum here. At the White Tea Museum, I experienced making matcha mooncakes, going to the tea mountain to pick and fry tea leaves, and order tea. I thought it would only take 20 minutes to visit the museum, but I ended up spending the entire afternoon. The shooting of Hanfu is also very good, the photographer is very good at framing the scene.
In addition, the hotel's restaurant is very delicious and provides coffee upon departure, which is a bit of a surprise.

msg:I planned to take advantage of the holiday in the last week of August and take my children on a spontaneous trip, but I had not decided where to go, where to stay, and what to play until 5 days before the trip. I accidentally saw Anji, which is said to have bamboo forests, tea gardens, green mountains and clear waters, and countless high-end and low-end hotels.
I actually wanted to choose a parent-child hotel and take my children to the hotel for 5 days to really take a vacation away from the hustle and bustle of the city and relax. My first choice was clubmed. I chose Anji between Qiandao Lake and Anji. I booked a day of clubmed on **, but later there were many disappointing bad reviews on Xiaohong. I wanted to refund but couldn't, so I booked and refunded among many hotels. Finally, I chose Hantian for the first three days. After returning, I felt that this decision was too wise.
First of all, the service. The hotel butler called one day in advance to confirm the itinerary and added WeChat to send the location and other warm reminders. We rented a car in Hangzhou, which was about a 2-hour drive. There was a receptionist at the entrance of the lobby, who enthusiastically moved our luggage from the car to the lobby. Parking was free in the resort. After checking in, the hotel butler took us to the door of the room by parking. I booked the cliff residence on the top of the mountain. The whole resort is very large. You can call for parking at any time. The staff, whether it is the front desk, parking driver or room service staff, are very enthusiastic and take the initiative to greet the guests and chat. It is not a mechanical business greeting, but simple and pure, comfortable and natural. The butler sends some warm reminders on WeChat at every time period. A family letter and welcome fruit are warm and ceremonial.
Speaking of room facilities, the hotel is clean and hygienic. The large French windows of the cliff residence are like living in a painting. Taking a bath in the bathtub in front of the window and looking at the scenery outside the window are very comfortable. Electric curtains, smart toilets, Dyson hair dryers, room audio music... romantic and technological. The disposable items such as toothbrushes and slippers provided are of good quality. I don't want to praise one and criticize the other. The experience of staying at Clubmed on the last day was really much worse than that of Hantian. The quality of the supplies was average, the hygiene was average, and there was also the suitcase. I didn't use the suitcase once in Hantian. When I saw that I wanted to carry the suitcase, the staff of Hantian hurriedly stopped me and said that he would take it, so I didn't have to do it. In the end, I checked in and checked out at Clubmed, and I carried the suitcase myself during all the processes.
Let's talk about Zhuyun Hot Spring and swimming pool. Due to the renovation of the hot spring in the first two days of check-in, the water was not hot, but there were three hot springs with warm water and good water. It was repaired on the last day, which was very lucky. The main attraction is the environment of the hot spring. Deep in the bamboo forest, there is a different view in each place. It is very comfortable to soak in the hot spring while enjoying the green eyes and listening to the birds singing and the wind. The swimming pool is at the top of the cliff, opposite the cafe. Although it is not big, the water quality is very good, which can meet the needs of children playing in the water or swimming exercise.
Finally, let's talk about food. All three meals can be solved in Shuixieju. Breakfast is self-service with rich varieties. You can eat from 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock, saving lunch. You can order dishes for dinner. The dishes are exquisite, the price is not too expensive, and the taste is delicious. The main dishes are tea-flavored pork knuckles, which are delicious. The average cost is about 120 yuan per person.
In summary, the resort is large and the area is relatively scattered. Even if it is full of guests, it is not noisy. In the evening, it also provides singing bowl therapy courses. The experience is very healing. The white tea museum is also good, and the price of goods is not expensive. The resort experience is comfortable and it is a place you want to go again after visiting.

msg:Immediately after returning from Anji, I commented passionately, absolutely positive 👍

Service: We must emphasize the service. From the hotel housekeeper’s proactive contact to provide service before departure, greetings every morning and evening; from the lobby to room service, to battery car pick-up (there are many battery cars in the hotel, it is convenient to travel) to the hot spring staff’s attentive introduction, check-out They also thoughtfully provided coffee and water (very surprising), etc. All the hotel staff are attentive, proactive and considerate!

Environment: It is surrounded by mountains and rivers. From the balcony of the room, you can see the mountains, forests and sea of ​​bamboos. There are black swans in the water pavilion restaurant and lake, and the whole is green water and green mountains.
The main point is to praise the hot spring♨️ for its cleanliness, and the responsible and considerate staff. You can also see the mountain view and bamboo forest while soaking in the hot spring. The environment and quality of the hot spring alone are worth coming back👏

Facilities: The hotel rooms are spacious and fully equipped. Welcome fruits and special white tea are all available. It is also very clean and hygienic!
In order to avoid crowds during the National Day, have a leisurely vacation and avoid scenic spots, this hotel alone is worth visiting, I really like it👍

msg:The children are on summer vacation, and friends recommend Anji Hantian Resort, which is really suitable for all ages.

First of all, this place is really delicious. I recommend Shuixieju. Every dish is delicious and amazing. I feel refreshed after eating here every day. Strongly recommend fish soup, fried amaranth, fragrant rice soaked in stone pot, and vermicelli with cabbage in sand nest. The buffet breakfast is also here. Because the dining area is long and narrow, it is not crowded at all, and it is accompanied by wonderful scenery, which is very pleasant.

Second, it's so much fun here. 1. The resort itself is in the Tea Expo Garden, and we bought a hotel + play package, so it includes a ticket for the White Tea Museum. If you have never been to Yunshang Grassland or walked through the glass plank road, you can come here to experience it first. The museum is on the fifth floor. There is a glass plank road near the exit of the tour. You can walk around and the scenery is very good. 2. The hotel swimming pool is on the top of the mountain. It is too hot and too sunny in summer, so the opening hours are set, 7-10 am, 15-20 pm, there are many people at 18 o'clock, and there are much fewer people at 19 o'clock. 3. Zhuyun Hot Spring is the most recommended. There are seven pools. We didn’t see clearly when we went there at night. We played in Zhuqu Pool (the pool with ocean balls) for a long time. The temperature of this pool is not high, about 34- 35 degrees, suitable for children, and then back to the white tea pool at the door, about 38-39 degrees, the temperature is relatively high, the elderly and children should not soak for too long, it will consume more energy. The opening hours of the hot springs are from 14 to 22 o'clock on weekdays, and until 23 o'clock on Saturdays and Sundays. The locker room is relatively small and there are lockers. It is recommended to change clothes in the room before coming back. 4. Hanfu experience. At first I thought it was just to change clothes for fun and take pictures casually, but later I chose the photographer in the store, so that I can do my hair for free. The sister who does the hair is really ingenious, and the hairstyle is done quickly and well. The hair accessories are also very nice. Finally, after the shooting, we packed all the photos, and the elderly and children were satisfied. 5. Singing bowl experience. I'm not sure there will be more of this in the future, but it's really novel. Courses like meditation are also very expensive outside. 6. Game room on the first floor. There are table tennis, billiards, trampolines, arcade machines, and photo sticker machines for a fee. 7. Children who eat a good breakfast every day can also get feed for feeding fish and swans. Remember to use this to motivate children to eat well. 8. You can sit in the cafe on the top of the mountain; you can go for a walk in the tea field; the trail around the mountain is recommended for those with physical strength.

The most important thing is at the end. The service here is really good. Everyone is very friendly and enthusiastic. The housekeeper can add WeChat one day in advance to predict the location and situation of the hotel in advance, and do a good job of communication and docking. We brought a 7-year-old Children, I took the initiative to give our children a buffet breakfast and hot springs, which is super considerate; the waiter at the door can take the initiative to help with luggage, and every time I go out, I will ask where I am going and help call a shuttle bus; the check-in at the front desk is very fast, Since the hotel is very environmentally friendly, it doesn't take the initiative to provide disposable items, but if you need them, remember to say that the front desk can help you, including children's bathrobes and toothbrushes; every waiter is very friendly and met in the elevator , will take the initiative to recommend fun places, and will take the initiative to ask children about their stay experience.

This is really a very cost-effective hotel I have ever stayed in, and I strongly recommend it. By the way, there is a small surprise when you check out~

Why is there still a touch of emotion after returning from travel? Ah, that was brought to me by Anji Hantian!
On a summer Sunday, before 3 pm, when I checked in, I saw guests yelling at the reception staff! I was prepared in my heart that I would not get the room card! Unexpectedly, we checked in very smoothly! And someone will deliver it to the room!


Facilities: The little yellow duck room we booked is full of yellow and lively little yellow duck elements, very cute! Daughter likes it very much, bouncing and bouncing! The room is large and well-equipped! A letter from home brought the distance closer in an instant, ah, I'm home!

Wherever you go, there are cars to pick you up! No matter who it is, as long as the hotel staff sees you, they are full of laughter, whether they are passing by or receiving you! Really feel the warmth! This service awareness is the real corporate culture, engraved in the bones...

I soaked in the hot springs: I drank the coffee on the top of the mountain; I visited the museum; I went to the glass bridge; Interesting...Focus on one, keep the other...

Let's live in Yunju next time. There will be a period in the future

msg:I have stayed at Meike, Clubmed Yushui Hot Spring, etc.
Anji Hantian, I can only say that it does not deserve the word "resort", nor does it deserve a rating of 4.9 points.
1. If the service is not good, what kind of resort can we talk about?
First of all, I would like to acknowledge the service attitude of the guest room aunt, the front desk and Junjun on the day of check-in. Every time I was greeted with a smile. But there are always a few people who spoil your mood for vacation. The security guard who just arrived at the hotel entrance kept asking you what you were doing before you even got out of the car; a girl wearing a suit at Waterside Residence on the first night I had a bad look the whole time when I asked for 2 cups for dinner. We met again at breakfast the next day, and we still had a bad look, but I smiled happily when I took out my phone to play with it.
2. Facilities, the thermometer next to the hot spring shows 40°, but the feeling of entering the water is probably about 30 degrees. If you come to the hot spring, you will basically be disappointed. The surrounding environment is just okay, so I won’t be the first to complain. In addition, there is no laundry service in such a large "resort"? Not even the laundry room, so professional!
3. The decoration standard of the guest room is quite good, and the smart guest control is also good and very convenient. However, the door of the guest room is basically not soundproof, and the voices of people in the corridor can be heard clearly.
Finally, it is very suitable for team building, because this "resort" is quite lively.

msg:The epidemic has been closed for two years. This time, I took the children to Anji for rafting during the summer vacation. After looking at several hotels on the Internet, I finally settled on Anji Hantian Resort. After reading online reviews and actually visiting the store, the experience is still very real. It takes 2 and a half hours from Shanghai to Anji Road. When you get off the expressway to the hotel, you can come in one way. Along the road, you can see tea trees all over the mountain. The scenery and air are very good. Added the hotel housekeeper Xiaoyan WeChat one day in advance, and notified the address and precautions on WeChat, and registered the license plate in advance to enter and exit the hotel without any burden. When we arrived at the entrance of the hotel, Libin helped us send the luggage in the car to the lobby, and the front desk was also very fast. All check-in people must show their ID cards, and breakfast is by swiping the door card. After check-in, send us directly to the room. In the evening, I was not happy to go out to eat dinner at the hotel, and I also ate breakfast there the next day. There are still many varieties of dinner, such as fish head, sliced ​​skin duck, braised pork, and fermented glutinous rice balls, all of which are very good. There are not too many varieties of breakfast, but it will definitely fill you up. Outside the dining area is the lake view, and there are many groups of ducklings in the lake. The room we booked is the Banshan Hot Spring Exclusive King Bed Room. The room is very large, and the drinks in the ice bar are provided for free. The welcome fruits and preserves are free, and the experience is very good. If you have any questions during your stay, you can ask the housekeeper Xiaoyan to answer them, and they can be resolved quickly. What surprised me the most was that after we checked out, Xiaoyan prepared three cups of freshly ground coffee for us to drink on the way. I was really touched. After returning to Shanghai, I sent WeChat greetings to see if I got home safely. These small details and services will definitely make me choose to stay here next time. Very satisfied, five-star praise!

Because I am sensitive to sound, the room type I booked at the beginning was a bit noisy
Upgraded the room type of Yunshe on the mountain for us, it is very quiet
They came to help us carry our luggage upstairs and kept saying that it was their problem and immediately improved it.
I want to eat teppanyaki temporarily on Qixi Festival. The booking is full, and I tried my best to help us coordinate and vacate the place.
Because the hotel is on the mountain, a shuttle bus is required to go back and forth. The housekeeper even went to help me get it for me when I lost my food.
What kind of fairy service is this? It's invincible
The environment of the hotel is very good. It is very cool to go in August. The tea fields are super beautiful. The white tea museum in the hotel is very good. You can experience the same style of tea ordered by Menghualu
The hotel facilities are very good. The rooms we live in all have smart home Dyson hair dryers
Children's Paradise Hot Spring Swimming Pool Hanfu Experience Tea Ceremony Walking You can spend a whole day in the hotel
Chinese restaurant with reasonable price and great taste

Dinner at Shuixieju is cost-effective, and the restaurant also gave birthday noodles, which made our tourists very touched by the series of humanized services in the resort, and also made tourists spend an unforgettable birthday.

When I stayed at the Hantian Resort, the housekeeper Xiaoyan contacted me in advance the day before I went, and sent me some check-in information. After arriving at the hotel, the room was upgraded, furnished, and presented with fruit. The minibar... The service is really meticulous and good ! When I checked out, I ran into Xiaoyan herself, and prepared two cups of freshly ground coffee for me to drink on the way. It was so considerate...Thank you!

Room facilities:
The room is quite big, with a balcony, a big bathtub, and a 1.5-meter bed. It's very comfortable to sleep in! The room is also very quiet, very suitable for vacation!

The room was very large and clean. Parents are tired from playing during the day, so they go back to the hotel to soak in the hot spring at night. The breakfast in the Chinese restaurant is very rich, and the dinner is also delicious. Every dish is not a surprise. We ate white tea pork knuckle for two days. The service of the hotel is great. The housekeeper, Miaomiao, added me on WeChat the day before check-in. She will coordinate and solve any problems. The shuttle bus is always on call, and all the service staff are very enthusiastic. When we left on the last day, Miao Miao thoughtfully prepared two cups of coffee for us, which was a very good stay experience. Mom and Dad were very happy, saying that it is better to go out to play with their daughter, and everything is well arranged. People of their generation are used to saving money, and they are not very good at using the Internet, so they always stay in fast hotels when they go out to play. I feel that the old man is like a child when he is old. I played in the water for three days in Anji, and I even saw the shadow of my daughter in my parents. Next time I will choose Hantian.

msg:The first impression of Hantian came from the Internet. Choose here because there are hot springs, swimming pools, singing bowl sound therapy, and the most beautiful tea mountain. Moreover, it has accumulated extremely high star ratings in the past. After coming here, I may also choose some supporting facilities that I want to have, such as bathrooms with ambient music, automatic curtains, and beverage refrigerators. But I have changed. In the future, when I choose a hotel, I will give priority to everything mentioned above. When I drive for a few hours and arrive at the hotel, the service staff will immediately come up to greet me and help carry my luggage. Afterwards, the housekeeper will be on hand all the time, and will be able to meet all your requirements. Thank you for having such a team, from the welcome to the front desk, and the busy driver after that, to take you where you want to go. There are hardworking chefs who cook delicious meals. A special mention to Ms. Zhang Li of Xiashuixieju, who is enthusiastic about her service and cares about the needs of customers. There is also a girl who only knows that her work card is 523. She is beautiful and kind-hearted, and she serves with a smile all the way, which makes me feel warm. And I'm sorry I couldn't remember all of your names. However, I will recommend this place to people I know. Hantian is not only a resort, but also a Hantian person. In our position, we silently treat us here with our hearts. So 5 stars, you deserve it! The most beautiful Hantian people!

The hotel is very large, among thousands of acres of tea mountains, it is very quiet, the twin beds are 1.5 meters, and the balcony is wide. The most important thing is that the butler Miao Miao is serving you well, which makes people feel very cordial. Next time I go to Anji, I will choose Hantian again.

I chose @Anji Hantian Resort for the Dragon Boat Festival holiday by mistake
Treasure! ! ! ! ! !
Arrived at the hotel after 1 pm on the first day of the holiday, and arranged a room in advance to check in.
13:15 Departure to Song Ming Tea Expo Garden (no one is happy)
14:15 Went to the mountain to ask about the hot springs, but there was still no one there. This is the Dragon Boat Festival!
In the afternoon, we played billiards on the first floor ◎ table tennis and small football. king of fighters
Afternoon tea set at the top of the mountain at 17:00!
At around 19:00, I went camping on the lawn outside. Laotan pickled vegetable instant noodle shop
Going back to recharge the electric fork for the singing bowl at 21:00, take a rest in a daze
The housekeeper Xiaoyan will add WeChat in advance, and make an appoin**ent in advance for the 22 o'clock supper izakaya.
(Yes! There is also a fountain at night, so it’s nice to see)
You can also feed the fish and swans after breakfast the next day 2
Also experienced a 1-hour Hanfu transformation into a chivalrous maiden
After checking out, we walked the Chashan Trail again, let alone, this Chashan is so spectacular!
Maybe our itinerary was different from others. Many people went to the hot springs after dinner, so there was no one there. Such a big resort was obviously full of people, but we didn’t meet anyone. It was such a happy holiday! Lock up Sakata, hahaha

Although it is in the parking lot halfway up the mountain, hotel shuttle buses are available everywhere. A thumbs up to Anji Hantian's staff, whether it's the little housekeeper Xiaoyan, the front desk, the restaurant, or the driver of the shuttle bus, they are all super enthusiastic. There is a swimming pool at the entrance of the hilltop cafe, and the hotel has a rich breakfast. In the evening, the taste and environment of the Shuixieju restaurant are also very good. The supporting facilities of the hotel are also very complete. There is a large entertainment hall with table tennis tables, game tables, and pool tables. I came to the resort to lie down for three days and two nights, which is true. Each room is equipped with a drying rack, and the bathroom can also play music. The facilities are very new and the environment is very good. I will come again next time. The fly in the oin**ent is that the bathroom toilet in our room has anti-odor, and the small refrigerator does not work, and there is no refrigeration function. Although the refrigerator in the hotel lobby can help store refrigerated items, it is still a bit inconvenient after all. Regardless of these small flaws, overall, it is a very good resort experience, the hot spring is also very clean, and ginger tea is prepared for the guests very thoughtfully, and all the details are praised. Once again, I would like to thank the hotel staff for their enthusiasm. The typhoon was approaching on the day of departure. During the rainstorm, they helped open the umbrella and put the suitcases into the car together. The little housekeeper, Xiaoyan, was very considerate both before and during check-in, including after check-in. Gave all kinds of information and helped to contact the hotel shuttle bus.

From a distance, you can see the white main building. The view from the top of the mountain should be very good. The restaurant is next to the main building. There is a long row of breakfast buffet dishes. It is very rich. It can be said that the restaurants are all in a small lake outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. You can enjoy the lake view while enjoying the lake view. There are black swans and ducks in the lake to watch carps. There is a red wine pool, a bamboo leaf pool, a white tea pool, and a children’s pool. After staying for 3 days, the butler, Miao Miao, has added WeChat in advance. The whole process is thoughtful. The service of other hotel staff is also very good. They will greet each other and there is a small lake that sometimes has a fountain at night.

I lived in Hantian in Changzhou a few years ago. The one in Anji is newer than the one I have lived in. The room type is also more comfortable than the one I have lived in before. The scenery is beautiful as soon as you enter the door. The swimming pool and coffee shop are right next to Yaju, which is very convenient
I ordered a set meal at the coffee shop that afternoon. Unfortunately, I accidentally fell and knocked over a cup of milk tea. The cup was broken, and the waiter didn’t ask me to pay for it. It's bruised, and it may take a while to heal.
Leaving wrestling aside, everything else is perfect. The variety and taste of the dinner and buffet breakfast at Shuixieju are very satisfying. My baby also likes to feed 🐟 and 🦆
This time because the weather was too hot, I didn't go to the hot springs. I hope to experience it again next time.

The coffee shop very close to Yaju is highly recommended, see picture 2! The breakfast is so rich, I like it very much, it can be compared to the breakfast of a star hotel in the city, the most important thing is, you can enjoy the lake view while having breakfast! !

Haha, let’s stop here, I seldom write comments, but I highly recommend to experience it, it’s definitely worth it! ! Look for housekeeper Xiaoyan, she will help you choose a beautiful room, provide considerate service throughout the whole process, and even bring a few cups of warm coffee and snacks before leaving! ! !

The white tea museum next door is not very interesting. It is not the tea-making season, and no one is working. The most surprising thing is the Hanfu photo project provided by the hotel. Although you can wear your own mobile phone to take pictures for free, I still called a photographer, who will guide you how to move, and the results are surprisingly good. One piece is 30 yuan. I chose 18 pictures and got a discount. Haha, my friends said when they saw it Looks good, oh, yes, the Chinese restaurant tastes good, and the price is not too expensive. In short, if you come to Anji and want to relax in a hotel for two days, it is recommended

The aunts by the pool also gave us umbrellas one by one when it rained heavily that day. It was so cold, I went to the front desk and asked for two pairs of disposable slippers. The front desk looked at me from head to toe and then gave me slippers. It made me feel very unfriendly and uncomfortable. The little yellow duck parent-child room only provided two breakfasts, and the child was charged. What kind of parent-child room is this? Of course, the hotel said that it is free for children under 1.4, so I can only blame the child for being so tall. I paid 100 yuan for breakfast. I really think it’s too bad. There are also people who give gifts when they check out. We don’t have it. There is still a difference. When booking the hotel, it didn’t indicate which room is available.

msg:I stayed for two days and felt very good. The room in Yaju is very spacious, facing the tea garden and the mountain. Although it rains or shines from time to time, it is really relaxing to lie in the bathtub and watch it;
The overall service exceeded expectations. When we arrived at the hotel because of the rain, the staff arranged very well. First, we took it to the front desk to check in, and then took us to park the car. The shuttle bus helped us put our luggage on the car, and then moved to the room. During the period, it was raining heavily, and the staff were very polite;
The housekeeper Miao Miao added WeChat one day in advance, and answered all kinds of questions and arrangements for help in almost seconds, thank you! This vacation was great!

A hotel suitable for traveling with elders,
The private butler Miao Miao is very kind, and will provide and reply to any needs in time. The bathtub in the room can take a bath, and you can enjoy the music while taking a bath with essential oil balls.
Breakfast is in the Chinese restaurant next door, it tastes good
You can choose western food for dinner, and the environment is not bad, but the air conditioner is a bit too cold. The hotel staff prepared shawls for us.
Afternoon tea at the top of the mountain is also great, with white tea, beverages, milk tea, and coffee

The room includes a hot spring ticket. There are not many people and the experience is good, but it would be better if you can put some dry towels by the pool. The temperature was low a few days ago, and after soaking in several pools, you can only return to the shower area with wet towels , very cold, if the elderly and children are weaker, they will get sick easily, I hope there will be a change when I go next time!

After two years, I returned to Anji Hantian again. At first, it was the spring bamboo shoots that the whole family missed together. This time, there was more yearning for the beautiful scenery, amazing service and nostalgia for human kindness.
Huang Yan and Ms. Lin Meng at the front desk are great. They have become friends with Ms. Huang Yan in just three days. Miss Lin Meng is super gentle, it's the second time we meet.
Let’s talk about the accommodation environment first. The Yaju Hot Spring King Bed and the Supreme King Bed are strongly recommended. They are very strong and straight to the point. When it rains, you can see the clouds and the sky connecting together. You can watch the scenery while soaking in the bath. In the case of a very fast-paced work, coming to Hatchland will definitely slow down your life rhythm and fully relax your brain. Shuixieju's hand-peeled bamboo shoots and tea-flavored pig's trotters are a must-eat! After eating, you can also ask the front desk for two packs of fish food. It is also a kind of relaxation to take children to the back mountain to feed fish, ducks and swans
My family is about to have a birthday. I communicated with the housekeeper, Ms. Huang Yan, about this matter at 3:00 p.m., but at 5:00 p.m., all the details including the cake, kitchen, dining room and guest room were completely completed. I am very grateful to Ms. Huang Yan, the cake delivery boy who grew up on Hot Wheels, and all the staff. I am dumbfounded by such efficiency and cooperation. It turns out that the owner of the resort treats the employees very well, so the employees will also reflect the care and love they feel for the hotel in the service. This is a positive cycle!
In short, except for the poor phone signal in Yaju, everything else is perfect!

Before check-in, call and add WeChat, report the license plate of the private car, and inform the resort of all facility service hours and precautions. Check in with you upon arrival. Luggage is also helped throughout the process. During check-in, they also answer questions and solve problems at any time. And will take the initiative to inform some entertainment items, reminding me that I can ask the restaurant for fish food to feed the fish. At the end of the check-in, I was given coffee for me to drink on the way.

The service attitude of all the waiters in the hotel is very good. He will answer all questions, and will take the initiative to ask questions about the situation.
Room: I don't want to put any photos. The official release is not a photo cheat, and the scene is basically the same. The sanitation is also good. The problem of insects is unavoidable in the mountains, but there are screen doors, which can be opened and closed at will. If you find that there are still, it's okay to ask the housekeeper, and they will arrange for cleaning to catch them, so you don't need to do it yourself.
Scenery: Because you live in Yunshe, you can see the scenery while sitting on the bed, and then you can go downstairs from the viewing platform on the top of the mountain.
Restaurant: There are Chinese food, teppanyaki, and Japanese food. This time, I was with my parents, so I ate all Chinese food. I forgot to take a picture of dinner. The picture is lunch. The per capita is more than 100. The quantity is good and the taste is good. The breakfast is also a Chinese restaurant. I think the variety is quite rich. The service The attitude is also good, and the speed of the bottom and small wontons is good.
Short parking: The speed is very fast, and the waiters at all points will call for you. The phone booth next to the scenic spot is not decorated.
Hot springs: There are seven hot spring pools (it seems, I forgot to count them), as well as stone baths, steam rooms, and water bars (free ginger tea is available from the waiter's introduction). Bring your own swimsuit, slippers and bath towels are provided. There are waiters in the hot spring pool who will tell you how to soak and remind you to rest.
Hanfu: The house provides a one-person Hanfu experience, which is very good, and the clothes feel very clean, not the old ones of the scenic spots. There are also many props. You don’t need to spend extra money to take pictures by yourself, let the photographer over there take pictures, and you will be charged for choosing photos.
Others: There are many scenic spots, but some of them have to climb the mountain by themselves, and you can get there by calling a car if you can park for a short time. There are also entertainment facilities indoors, table tennis, billiards, and chess and card rooms.
The only downside is that the temperature is a bit embarrassing now. It was 27 or 28 degrees when I went there, but the room is centrally air-conditioned. Now it can only heat the air conditioner and supply air, so the room is very stuffy.

msg:Because of the rain, I didn't go to other attractions when I came to Anji, and played a full set in the hotel. There is a white tea museum in the hotel, where you can experience picking tea, frying tea and ordering tea
Went to the hot springs in the afternoon. The hot spring is not big, but it is very private, basically a family in one pool, you don’t need to squeeze with others, and you can also experience the special pool. I like the white tea pool from the dressing room the most. The temperature is right and the taste is very fragrant. I eat it at Chinese restaurants in the morning, lunch and evening, and it tastes good. In the evening, I experienced the singing bowl, which was quite interesting.
Great breakfast the next day! The pickled meat with pickled vegetables is so fragrant, I strongly request it to be added to the menu. Also experienced Hanfu. I won the afternoon tea in the coffee shop by lottery, and the taste is also very good. There is nothing to say about the overall hotel service, they are very enthusiastic and responsive, and there is also a 24-hour WeChat communication with the housekeeper.

In the bamboo forest directly opposite the balcony of the room, the breeze is blowing the bamboo leaves, making a rustling sound, which wakes up one after another. Fat bamboo shoots seem to really understand the phrase "with you, with me, and with the mountains and rivers". I would also like to thank the housekeeper Xiaoyan for her considerate service. After checking in, Xiaoyan helped us take our luggage to the room. In addition, she also sent us a hotel map and hotel introduction. Every morning, she would send greetings and introduce the time for breakfast. I asked if I got home smoothly. The other staff of the hotel, including the reception staff in the lobby and the service staff in the hot spring hall, provided very good service, and the hot spring experience was also good. Finally, I would like to thank Mr. Yang in the Hanfu experience area for making beautiful headwear for friends for free, and he is also very nice. It is worth going to experience it when you have time. In short, this is a very satisfactory stay experience, and I will definitely go there again in the future of.

The housekeeper, Xiaoyan, will contact you by phone one day in advance and inform you of the check-in details.
The hotel is located in a scenic area. After parking, you need to take a shuttle bus to pass. When you arrive at the store in the afternoon, the CI is very fast, and it will be done in five minutes. The detailed rules will be informed, and the room card booklet will also be written.
The room is relatively open, the design is reasonable, the hardware maintenance is not bad, and it is very new. You can soak in the hot spring at night, which is very pleasant, with hot water and ginger tea.
There is room for improvement in breakfast, and it would be great if a small cup of special white tea could be given during ci.

msg:I give this hotel 💯 points!

It's still quite cold in early spring, it's really good to come here to relax in a hot spring👍


Environment: The hotel is located in the bamboo forest of Chashan, with one step at a time around,
There is a white tea museum next to it, and you can also take a stroll.


Facilities: The a**osphere in the public areas of the hotel is also particularly good.
The room is very spacious, with large floor-to-ceiling windows, and the scenery outside the window is unobstructed. I especially like sitting on the sofa in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking at the scenery in a daze, and feeling very comfortable.
The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and it is equipped with a large bathtub. The bath products are also very good, and the hand sanitizer smells particularly good.
The light music in the room is also a plus, you can listen to it while taking a bath.


Hygiene: Very clean, the bed and quilt pillows are soft and comfortable.

Service: I really want to give it a big thumbs up👍, we don't have much luggage, only two handbags, and the clerk is very enthusiastic to help carry it to the door of the room. Now there are few places with such good service.

Exclusive hot spring for two people: There are about 7 pools, hidden in the bamboo forest, not many people, basically ☝️ only two people soak in the pool, it is no different from a private bath! There is also a dry steam room and a salt room. Although the dressing room is a bit small, it has a complete range of supplies, including a sewing kit, which is very considerate.
The hot springs only provide towels, and you can wear the bathrobes in the room.

The breakfast is also very rich, the key taste is good! The Chinese restaurant Shui Xie Ju is good, and the food tastes good and the price is moderate.

In short, it was a very good travel experience, and I will come to Anji again in the future.

msg:I booked the hotel half a month in advance, and navigated there that day, and the location was in the Songming Tea Expo Garden. The housekeeper, Xiaoyan, added WeChat one day in advance, and asked us to provide the license plate number so that we could park in advance. When we arrived at the entrance of the hotel lobby, a waiter enthusiastically took the luggage and guided us to park.
When I checked in, because the reserved room hadn't been cleaned, I waited for a while. The front desk also expressed apologies to me, and offered to upgrade me to a room type for free. Then I called the shuttle bus to take us to the room on the top of the mountain. The mountain road along the way is surrounded by tea mountains. The environment is very good and makes people very comfortable.
This time we lived in the highest Yaju hot spring king bed room on Yaju. The room is very large, with 80 square meters, which is equivalent to suites in many other hotels. The room is very clean, and the living room is very large. There are two The sink and bathing pool are at the entrance of the balcony. The balcony area is also very large, with a wide view, and you can see the continuous tea mountains. The only downside in the room is that the facilities are a bit old, the cover on the air conditioner console keeps falling off, and the curtains can't be closed halfway.
In the afternoon, I went to the hot springs at the foot of the mountain of the hotel. There were 7 different hot spring pools in total. I tried them all, and the temperature was different. Because it was a weekday, there were fewer people, and the experience was good.
In the evening, I went to Shuixieju next to the hotel lobby for dinner. The price is normal and the taste is good, especially the braised fish head, which is delicious, but the speed of serving food is a bit slow.
I went for breakfast around 9 o'clock. There were still quite a few people. There were many varieties of dishes, including Chinese and Western dishes. The best thing was the noodles. The soup base was very delicious.
The overall experience of this trip is still very good. The service staff of Anji Hantian Resort are very enthusiastic and responsive, and the hotel has a complete range of supporting facilities. I will come again next time if I have a chance.

There are a lot of people in the hotel on weekends, and most of them bring their children for a family trip. If you want to be quiet, it is recommended to come on weekdays. The room was booked in Yaju, which is small in size but has a good view. The fly in the oin**ent is that there is no hanger or wardrobe in the room, and the coat can only be thrown on the sofa. The housekeeper, Xiaoyan, was very polite and gave a good review. Because there were too many people on weekends, I didn't go to the restaurant in the hotel. I will try it next time.

The location of the hotel is very good, surrounded by tea mountains. I stayed for two nights this time, and I didn’t go to other places. I just stayed here The hotel is very comfortable after soaking in it. The shuttle bus can be sent to the top of the mountain and then walk all the way down. The air is very good. I visited the tea expo garden next door. I watched the tea-picking aunt pick tea. I also picked some tea. I was very happy and had a good meal. Convenient, you can order food at Shuixieju in the hotel, there are many dishes, and the taste is also good. There are also large tables and private rooms. The hotel service is very thoughtful, especially the housekeeper Binbin reminded us that we can ask the front desk for fish food to feed the fish and ducks after breakfast , After checking out, we even made two cups of latte to drink on the road. After checking out, the shuttle bus master specially sent us to the parking lot above. The only downside is that the sound insulation is not very good, and the sound of closing the door It's very noisy, and there's a big gap between the doors, so you can hear someone talking in the corridor very clearly. Also, because the air conditioner in the room is centrally controlled, it can be a bit stuffy at night. It's recommended to turn off the air conditioner to sleep. I don't know the situation on the first night, and I was woken up by the heat I saw that the temperature in the room was already 30 degrees. The front desk explained that because the hotel is in the mountains, it will be cooler at night, and the temperature of the air conditioner will be higher. You can open the balcony door for ventilation. I am satisfied with other aspects

The hotel has its own scenic spot, with mountains, water and pleasant air. Stay in a 200-square-meter suite in Longyi Building, with two bedrooms and one living room. The master bedroom has a large bed with a small garden; the second bedroom has a 1.5-meter double bed with a viewing balcony. Longyi Building is located on the top of the mountain. The hotel's battery car is on call 24 hours a day. It is very convenient to shuttle between the main building, restaurants, hot springs, and the top of the mountain for unlimited times. At the same time, you will be given a visit ticket to the White Tea Museum and a Hanfu experience ticket. The hot springs are only available to hotel guests, so there is no need to worry about being crowded. It is really pleasant to relax in a comfortable bath.

The rooms are clean and the facilities are well maintained. The scenery of the hotel is invincible, and the observation deck where the outdoor swimming pool is located is still a check-in point for Internet celebrities; the staff are polite and enthusiastic, and always greet you with a smile. The uncle who drove the battery car knew that we were going to the Bamboo Expo Garden to see pandas, so he recommended Yucun, who was on the way, to check in xi’s big footprint; thanks to our housekeeper Binbin, who not only communicated with me about check-in and registered the license plate in advance, but also carefully prepared coffee and white tea to drink on the way before check-out. The service level is super five-star.

The breakfast is rich, especially suitable for the Chinese stomach, and it tastes good; the restaurant provides guests with small bags of fish food, and there are hundreds of colorful koi in the lake at the entrance, and they swarm over after a handful of fish food. There are also black swans cruising in the lake. Unfortunately, on the first afternoon, a black swan's body was found by the water, and I told the staff that it was fine not long ago, and I don't know what happened. I hope the remaining three are healthy and well.

The second phase of the hotel will be put into operation soon, and there will be small villas on the mountain at that time. I am looking forward to it, and it is worth coming again!

You can also visit the Tea Museum and experience Hanfu for free. It feels too late to play in an afternoon. Dinner is settled in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel. This must be praised. The chef is absolutely on-line, and the price is reasonable. The restaurant is right by the lake, and it is raining outside, misty and rainy, so cozy. I went to the hot spring at night. There are not many pools, but there are not many people. Basically, it is a pool. Also, most of the staff here are locals, who greeted us warmly and reminded us to drink water and take a break before soaking. Although it was raining lightly, it did not affect our hot springs at all. There are several mountain climbing entrances here. I wanted to climb the mountain after the rain stopped the next morning, but found that the road was a bit slippery, so I had to give up. This place is very suitable for a family to take a vacation. There are many places where there is no time to go. I will bring my family next time.

msg:I chose this Hantian if I wanted to go to the hot springs
The overall feeling is very good! The environment is good, the hot spring is comfortable, and the room is also satisfactory
Our room has a 2-hour experience of sending Hanfu
⚠️The attitude of the staff in charge of Hanfu is really not flattering [sweating]
That aunt had an extremely bad attitude because of my experience
At the beginning, I kept selling photographers. During the period, I asked the bottom line. I even asked whether I should use a mobile phone or a camera to take pictures. Can I turn on beauty? ? ?
Then I said no + photography cannot include makeup and hair, and if you choose a thick Hanfu, there is only an outer cloak, and there is no Hanfu inside. I chose a set that includes a cloak. She has been making faces since I chose clothes.
It is understandable to want to sell
But the next operation is really speechless. Let me choose two or three hair accessories and do it myself. I have been impatient with me when I was choosing, and all kinds of yin and yang mean that you are just experiencing it. Understand, it should all cost money If you don’t have customers for money now, I will give you an experience
May I ask if I didn't pay the room fee or what? Later, I said that I was too ink-stained and wanted to give me a hairstyle. God knows how ugly a left-right asymmetrical braid can be. After a while, a new customer came and directly asked me to stand beside me and do it myself [Halo] and regretted that I couldn’t choose hair accessories. She gave me I took it, and I asked her to remove her ugly hairstyle. It really makes people angry. Seeing me get angry, I immediately changed my face. It’s a bad experience.
But the attitude of other staff is very good [love] the manager is also very fast in handling the problem, except for this aunt [heartbreak]

Each has its own characteristics. The children like it very much. The service of the housekeeper Junjun is very good. The other service staff are very enthusiastic. Compared with The Hello Kitty Castle Hotel is much better, and the food at Waterside House is also delicious. Unfortunately, my appetite is limited. I really want to try every one. Although Anji is a county town, there are many places to play and they are all scattered. The location of Hantian Hotel is relatively remote and suitable for self-driving. Taking a taxi is not very convenient. If you just stay in a hotel, you can face nature quietly and stay for two or three nights. Not bad, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

The price is also 140 per person, and the taste is pretty good~ The breakfast is very rich, with many varieties of Chinese dishes Western style~ It is worth mentioning that their service is really super warm and super good~ Whether it is an ordinary aunt or my housekeeper Binbin, they are really super enthusiastic~ I will come again next time I have a chance~

Cliff house, on the top of the mountain, has a wide view and is relatively quiet.
There are 7 soup pools, not too many people, at least a family can soak alone.
The dinner was eaten at the water pavilion, the quantity was large and the taste was good.
The Hanfu experience provided by the hotel package, the shooting effect is very good, it is better than the studio I found alone, the price is right, a set of big snow scenes, absolutely amazing!

msg:I originally wanted to order Tianmu Lake Hantian to soak in the soup, but I saw a crowd of people in the circle of friends, and I decided to cancel the order. I chose this place blindly, and the result was unexpectedly pleasantly surprised and satisfied.
The first one is that there are not many people, it is elegant and quiet, and the place is very large. In fact, Ctrip has already been full of rooms, but no one can be seen. Probably the tourists have dispersed, so it is more likely to miss the peak. I like this feeling of quietness in the midst of the hustle and bustle. The environment in the mountains is super good and the vegetation is dense. It feels very suitable for a second visit in spring and summer.
We live in Yunshe on the top of the mountain, the room is very big, the decoration style is modern, simple and stylish, the materials are also exquisite, and the facilities are complete, only you can't think of it, even the hair dryer is carefully designed, which is better than those five-star chains 😜
I didn’t eat breakfast. My son who came back from the United States spoke highly of it. He said it was richer than many big five-star breakfasts. Maybe it’s because he likes Chinese breakfast. Breakfast in hotels abroad is full of bread and ham sausage🤪
The terrace of the room is huge, it should be very comfortable to bring a barbecue and tea making equipment in spring and summer
The facilities in the public area are also very complete, the air conditioner is fully turned on, and the entrance and exit are all sensory without hands. These details in winter are very pleasing
The only downside is that you can't directly bathe in a bathrobe, which is not a downside, because we chose to live on the top of the mountain, and it is estimated that we can live in the middle of the mountain. So this shortcoming doesn't exist at all.
Swimming and camping in summer
It's more than 2 hours' drive from Shanghai, so you must use it twice
I just hope that my good reviews don’t push up the price 😂

Overall, the trip was worthwhile, the weather was not good, the coffee bar on the top of the mountain did not experience it, it was all fog, the body was not strong, there was no hot spring, the room was clean and satisfactory, but the toilet was not smart enough, and the air was really good. The experience of Hanfu is also good, casual photo shoots are still very good, the housekeeper will add WeChat the day before check-in, basically everything that should be informed, and reply at any time, the breakfast is also full and rich, and you can also feed carps and swans. The free white tea museum is also very good, the battery car over there is on call, it is very convenient, and it doesn't feel very commercial, it is very clean, with the tranquility of a vacation. It's better not to go to that waterside house except for breakfast, it's really unpalatable.

msg:Overall very satisfied with the three-day and two-night vacation
The room is very big. Ask us to upgrade to a room with a balcony. There is a minibar and welcome fruit
My mother communicated with the housekeeper for her birthday and sent a small birthday cake, which is delicious
Generally speaking, the requirements are basically met, but the initiative is on the guests. The housekeeper may be too busy to think proactively for the guests. For example, it was stated in advance that three people will stay, but after check-in, they found all the toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, etc. It's still for two and it's not prepared in advance.

In addition, the hot springs are great. On the mountainside, it is so comfortable to soak in the hot springs in winter. It is very refreshing to soak in the seven pools.
But the dressing room is too small, the sanitation is average, the bathroom smells a bit bad, and the slippers worn by others are not disinfected, so keep putting them in the next closet

The breakfast is very rich. It’s a bit early to finish at ten o’clock. Dinner is settled in a Chinese restaurant. The taste is not bad. 100 per person

I also like singing bowl sound therapy, very relaxing

In addition, there is Hanfu experience, the rental is free, and the photo is charged. The effect is not bad.

It has been raining for 2 consecutive days, and the walking trails up and down the mountain are not easy to walk. We can only take the shuttle bus to the top of the mountain, take a look at the scenery and then take the car down. I hope to wait for the weather to come back and take a good walk on the trail.
The room is big and the bedding is very comfortable. I slept soundly both nights. There is a big bathtub in the room, and the water is put in at night, and the children have fun in it. I just hope that it would be better if I can prepare a disposable bath bag~
The service of the hotel is good. Basically, they respond to every request, but the service awareness of individual service staff is not very strong. They are satisfied only when there is a request, and they are not active enough~
I think the catering at Shuixieju is also very good, especially the rice soaked in stone pot is very suitable for my taste~

Enjoy the hot spring for two people: Mom and Dad went to take a bath and said that the water is very hot and there are not too many people, which is good.
Sixiantang Hanfu rental is free for 1 hour: Photographer Gu is very good at amusing the children, and the children are also very cooperative. The two sets of clothes are very cute and beautiful. It belongs to a special travel memory. Like it!

msg:Summary first: I like Anji Hantian very much (I am the highest level member of X Hao, so I still have requirements for the hotel)
[First impression] One day in advance, the housekeeper Xiaomin called me, said to add me on WeChat, sent me a bunch of hotel information, and asked me what I needed, very considerate! You know, I just booked the second-level room type of his house, which is not that expensive room type, but it also has butler service, which is a pleasant surprise.
[First impression] The hotel lobby smells very good, and it feels very soothing as soon as you enter the door. I really like this clean and refreshing hotel style, and it is not the cold decoration of a five-star chain. The use of a lot of wood colors is the feeling. Arrived home. Nothing beats being at home. The front desk is very warm and efficient (By the way, all the staff I met in the hotel, including but not limited to, the housekeeper Xiaomin, the concierge at the door, the front desk, the aunts and uncles in the hot spring, and the staff in the restaurant, are all very, very warm and enthusiastic. People feel very warm) Then I just checked in, and Xiaomin immediately sent me all kinds of information about the hotel. Where can I find such considerate service?
[Room] It's not very big, but the toilet is big, clean, and the bedding is very comfortable
[Let's talk about the highlight] Hot spring! ! In the open-air hot spring on a hill, it is so comfortable to soak in the hot spring in winter! ! Everyone looks at the picture, is it a feeling of winding paths leading to secluded flowers and trees, soaking in it, surrounded by bamboos swaying, it is comfortable and comfortable, and the body and mind are completely relaxed. There are 7 swimming pools, 1 of which was repaired that day, and I soaked in the remaining 6 except the children's pool. I like red wine the most and the most secluded.
[Breakfast] At 8 o'clock the next day, I received a WeChat reminder from Xiaomin, reminding me of the breakfast address and time again. The breakfast is very good, with a wide variety of dishes. I took three rounds, which is much richer than many five-star dishes, and the replenishment is very timely.
[Tea Mountain] We only stayed for one night. After breakfast the next morning, we started to climb the tea mountain. It was really tiring. . But the scenery is very beautiful. Bamboo and tea are all objects of meditation. By the way, it is said that you can pick tea yourself in spring and summer. Haha, I am envious.
[Summary] It is a warm and comfortable hotel. The employees love their hotel and their work very much, and treat guests with the most sincere service. The hygiene is in place and the food is delicious, and you can also climb mountains. really satisfied

msg:For a good hotel, the hardware is of course important, but the software can make people linger and leave a deep impression. I have been to many hotels and have added many "butlers", but this is the first time that I have such a caring and warm service. It is because of this kind of service that I have a great impression of Anji Hantian Resort. Referrals between circles and friends.
The housekeeper Xiaohui contacted me the day before check-in, added WeChat, sent me the corresponding precautions and routes, and helped to make an appoin**ent for the evening singing bowl activity in advance; on the day of check-in on the 8th, he sent us to the room and gave a general introduction of various types Equipment and activities, helped plan the itinerary - after resting in the room, go to eat at 5 o'clock, go to the hot spring at 6 o'clock, go to the singing bowl at 8 o'clock, and return to the room at 9 o'clock; help to call a car throughout the process, and reply to information in a timely manner, very relaxed but yet Enrich;
On the morning of the 9th, we reminded us of the meal time, and then went to take photos of Hanfu, and told us that there was fish food to feed the fish. When we went back to the room after a round of play, we were surprised to show up and gave me a birthday cake. This is really touching, Xiao Hui said that after seeing my identity information, the cake was made by a chef early in the morning on the 9th, and it was freshly baked. Even my mother was amazed at this point~ The birthday process has gradually been simplified in recent years. I was very moved. I thought the hotel would send a gift like a towel at most. I am really happy to be able to do this.
In addition, when checking out, because the room is close to the coffee shop and far from the lobby, I wanted to have afternoon tea first, and then go down the mountain to return the room card, so Xiaohui came directly to get the room card to help check out. The cake was too big to finish, so he put it in the refrigerator of the coffee shop. When he left, he did not forget to ask not to miss it, and packed 2 cups of coffee to drink on the way. After a series of operations, I can only say that it is very heartwarming~ My mother also repeatedly lamented that this guy is really careful (because I really completely forgot to take the cake and coffee without reminding me)
All in all it was a very pleasant birthday experience, hot spring trip. The scenery in the room of Yaju is pleasant. When you lie down, you can see the continuous valleys, lofty mountains, and fluttering mountains and haze. It’s like a fairyland. It’s very relaxing and comfortable without doing anything. There are also many welcome fruits and snacks. My mother who always brings a lot of snacks also said, I knew I would not bring them with me, so I brought them all back~ The service staff are also very friendly, whether it is the driver who drives the car or the staff of the Hanfu shop, they are all very friendly; there are 7 hot spring pools, and the staff are also enthusiastic to give advice. Where to go, where to go again, overall the experience of staying is very good.
There are two flaws in the oin**ent. One is that when we had dinner at the hotel restaurant on the night of the 8th, someone was smoking at the next table. The service staff saw it, but they didn’t stop it and remind them. I also saw someone commenting like this on Dianping), I hope this can be improved; second, when I went to the museum, the visitor center was closed, and there was no sign when I arrived at the building. I didn’t know how to get in. I almost went around and asked. It was only after a while that I realized that the elevator went directly to the 5th floor. It was actually a souvenir shop. I walked around casually, bought a can of "Everyone Health" and returned. It is recommended to put a sign so that you will know where to go after parking the car.

Welcome fruit, a letter from home, and a mini bar are all very considerate. If there is any need, room service will also be replenished in time. Suggestions: The mattress is slightly soft, the curtains are less shading, and there is no satellite TV, but it does not affect the stay.
Eat: Give "Shuixieju" a big thumbs up, every dish is delicious, and all of them are CDs. The raw materials are very fresh, the price is not bad, and a half portion option is thoughtfully designed, which is suitable for people who order less;
Play: hot springs, mountain climbing, adventure... very suitable for family travel. The hot springs are only open to staying guests, so they are very private. It is suggested that the temperature of individual hot springs can be lowered, which is more friendly to children; climbing the mountain really gave us a big surprise. After dinner, the sky is full of stars, and it is very interesting to climb to the top of the mountain under the moonlight.
Services: From security guards, shuttle bus drivers, front desk service, room cleaning...all are warm and smiling services. The housekeeper will contact you one day in advance and give instructions, which is very considerate.
The overall price/performance ratio is very high. When the spring is warm and the flowers bloom, if I come to Anji again, I will choose to stay here again.

The balcony is also very good, you can drink tea and watch the scenery, but it was too cold when I went there. The activity hall on the first floor of the hotel is also very rich in activities, including billiards, table tennis, and small game consoles! Love the breakfast here. There is a coffee shop on the top of the mountain, where you can read books, which is very good. The Japanese teppanyaki on the mountainside is also good 👍 Reservations are required. The snow scene is beautiful!

The room is large and the service is in place. The breakfast is very rich, but it is a pity that there is not much time left, and there is no time to go to the Hanfu, white tea museum, and singing bowls.
You must go to the hilltop cafe! Otherwise, you will miss the natural beauty~ The air on the mountain is also super good, and you can climb the mountain when you have time.

Children especially like it to satisfy their curiosity. Going out of the lobby to the mountain is the hot spring. The water is very clean and each small pool has its own characteristics. There is also a paddling pool specially prepared for children. The water depth is just right for children. You can also order coconuts in the hot springs. The cafe on the top of the mountain is also good overlooking the tea mountain

msg:The resort is located in the Tea Expo Garden and has a whole mountain. It is a tourist attraction in itself, and the added value exceeds expectations. The wild hot spring pool surrounded by tea fields and bamboo forests allows you to pretend to be in Japan; tea fields, trails, and bamboo forests are all for you to relax at will. The resort integrates nature and fashion, every detail is thoughtful, and every waiter makes you feel at home. The only downside is that the hot water in the room comes too slowly, it takes a long time to wait, and the water is too small.

The room is on the mountain, but no matter where you go, just tell the housekeeper Xiaojie, and there will be a shuttle bus coming within two minutes~ The driver is very kind! I came here specially to soak in the hot springs. The hot spring pools are so comfortable. The mugwort pool and the red wine pool are most recommended! The resort has western food, teppanyaki, and Chinese restaurant. Unfortunately, both teppanyaki and western food are fully booked, but the Chinese restaurant is also very cost-effective. After breakfast, you can feed swans and koi. After breakfast, you can go to the tea garden, which is comfortable ! I am really satisfied with the service and environment, and I will continue to come again next time ~ feel the culvert in spring and summer!

Exclusive hot spring for two: There is a special pool for children and a lot of ocean balls. The pool water is also clean.
The hotel can also get free fish feed to feed the fish, experience Hanfu for 1 hour for free, and take children to participate in the Tea Garden Museum. Makes sense.

msg:The housekeeper, Xiaomin, added a WeChat message one day in advance to give a warm reminder. On the day of check-in, the wait for check-in was nearly two hours, and he was slightly dissatisfied. However, the butler immediately sent the afternoon tea package on the top of the mountain. Although it was just a simple two cups of milk tea and two desserts, it was an apology (although the swimming pool on the top of the mountain is not open, you can pass some time by looking at the scenery on the top of the mountain). After checking in, I found hair left by the previous guest in the corner of the bed. I immediately communicated with the housekeeper to replace the whole set, so let's just let it go. The advantage of going the day before the weekend is that there are fewer people, and there will be no dumplings in the soup. The singing bowl sound therapy class in the evening is also full of people. Let me digress. This kind of singing bowl class still pays attention to personal qualities. Some people just can't turn on the mute, hey! It was raining heavily the next day. After breakfast and check-out, the butler still came out to say hello to yesterday's episode, and presented two souvenirs. I was very touched. The top 1 hot spring hotel in Anji is not because it is luxurious and high-end, but because of the enthusiastic service and response of every staff member in it, just like Haidilao. I want to give this five-star praise!

The price is moderate and there are a lot of good reviews. After we arrived, we were not disappointed! Because it was around 5 o'clock in the evening when I arrived (about 2 and a half hours by car from Shanghai), I ran directly to the hot springs, a total of seven pools, the temperature ranges from low to high, and there are bubble baths designed for children. Less, the hot spring is also very clean, you can enjoy the exclusive hot spring for two people. There are Chinese food and Western food in the resort. We finally chose Chinese food (because it is closer to the room). The taste is also very authentic Zhejiang food. Two people ate for less than 200 yuan, and the price is very reasonable. We didn’t kill customers just because we were in the resort. ~The breakfast in the morning is also very rich, satisfying the taste buds. The room is very large, and there is also a huge terrace. Although it is winter, the temperature is very comfortable. Drinking tea and eating snacks on the terrace is super enjoyable! In the future, it will be the first choice for hot spring + vacation!

I said in advance that it was for my partner's birthday, and I also gave a big cake as a gift, and it was very delicious. The seven hot spring pools are enough for soaking, as well as sauna rooms and hot stone rooms. The quality of the dishes in the restaurant is good, and the portions are large. The waiter will remind two people not to order too many large portions. The variety of breakfast is also quite good, and the food is added crazily near the end, for fear that we are not full, the quality is the quality of a five-star hotel. The cliff dwelling room is great. The service staff in the resort are very friendly and enthusiastic, responsive to every request. A very caring and comfortable vacation. Come again in spring.

As shown in the picture, there is a wall and table next to the bed in the master bedroom, which separates the bedroom and the bathroom, making the bedroom appear very narrow and closed. The bedroom and the bathroom are connected through a small corridor. The view is not very good either. Moreover, this room type is in the corner and the layout is really not open enough. I do feel that staying in this room for more than 2,000 during New Year's Day is a bit uneconomical.

After Ctrip placed the order, the housekeeper Xiaojie took the initiative to call us and added WX to facilitate later service. Knowing that we brought our children to celebrate their birthday, not only did they upgrade the room type with a good view, the hotel also specially sent a birthday cake and birthday noodles separately, which was very pleasantly surprised. No matter which depar**ent this hotel is in, from the front desk to the waiters in the hot springs, to the waiters in the Chinese restaurant, and even the stylists and photographers who experience Hanfu and take pictures, they are all very warm and friendly. This is rare in other hotels. Other five-star hotels may be due to the good attitude of some people, but the Hantian Hotel can provide good service to basically everyone. Next weekend for a short trip, I will still choose this hotel. There are some minor problems with the facilities, but good service can offset them 😀. The room price we set on weekends is 1420, and now it only costs more than 800. Friends who have free time can choose non-holiday travel, which is very cost-effective. Usually when we go out to play by ourselves, we also choose hotels based on reviews. So this review is for your reference. There is another detail, their twin room has a 1.5-meter bed, and other hotels basically have a 1.2-meter bed. Super bonus. The four children in our family took their aunts out, and the twin beds in both rooms are enough to sleep. I hope the hotel can add 🍗 to the butler Xiaojie after seeing the reviews, the service is thoughtful and considerate. see you next time

Environment: Very good, in the mountains, the environment is very beautiful, bamboo and tea trees are everywhere, this season is full of sweet-scented osmanthus.
Service: Very good, the little sister at the front desk, the driver of the shuttle bus, the sister Yang in Hanfu, Xiao Zhang, and the aunt in the hot spring are all very nice.


Hygiene: It's also pretty good, nothing to be picky about.
Exclusive hot spring for two people: I went for a walk in a nightgown and swimsuit. There were very few people in the afternoon. The two enjoyed a pool and liked the red wine pool very much.
Sixiantang Hanfu rental is free for 1 hour: you can make a simple style, but there are not many clothes, and you can choose less if you are picked. There are photographers who can take pictures, choose 20 yuan a piece, or you can take pictures yourself.

Healthy drinks from the minibar: I forgot, but I gave a coupon for afternoon tea. On the top of the mountain, the environment is good and the taste is average.
The Guoba fish in Shuixieju is very delicious.

Before going out, the housekeeper Xiaohui sent me the check-in instructions to facilitate my travel. The hotel staff are warm and hospitable, greeted with smiles and feel very warm. The housekeeper Xiaohui is even more attentive and considerate. In the evening, I participated in the singing bowl sound organized by the hotel. The ethereal sound of the bowl brought people to sleep, which was very good. Bamboo culture is permeated everywhere in the hotel, and I also tasted bamboo tea for the first time. The white tea presented in the room is fragrant and refreshing. The tea season will open next spring, and I would like to come and experience it.

msg:I booked this resort hotel on Ctrip only a few days in advance for the temporarily arranged holiday trip, but I definitely got an unexpected surprise. The hotel covers almost the entire mountain. The cliff dwelling on the top of the mountain overlooks the tea garden, and the mountain dwelling halfway up the mountain can view the bamboo forest. The room is very spacious, with a large viewing balcony, the decoration and design style is still very good, and it is also very clean and hygienic. The hotel focuses on hot springs. A total of 7 hot spring pools are built in an orderly manner on the mountainside. Each pool contains natural extracts with different effects, such as white tea, mugwort, lemon and so on. It is really enjoyable to have a hot spring in the mountains surrounded by bamboo forests! Generally, the restaurant in the hotel is average, but the Shuixieting restaurant in this hotel is really delicious, the taste is very authentic, the price is very high, and the service is good. The overall service standard of the hotel is very high and the experience is excellent. Special thanks to the two waiters Jiang Jie and Lu Jie in the hot spring area for their very thoughtful, meticulous and caring service. Thanks again, I will take my family to stay at this hotel again in the future.

♨️Tired of playing, go to the resort's mid-mountain to soak in an open-air hot spring. The hot spring is half hidden in the bamboo sea of the tea garden. You can enjoy the scenery and wash away your fatigue. It is a popular item all year round.
🎋The mountaintop swimming pool of the resort is also very good, but unfortunately it is only open from July to August, but the viewing platform by the swimming pool, the scenery is first-class, the rolling tea hills and bamboo sea, the beauty makes people linger
🎋In addition to the beautiful scenery and bathing, the resort's activities are also very rich and attentive, including Hanfu experience, singing bowl sound therapy experience, etc. Even if you stay here for 2-3 days, you will not be bored
👍🏻The most worth mentioning is that the hotel service is very good. During our stay, every staff member we met was very enthusiastic and responsible. At the same time, there is also a one-to-one service with an exclusive butler. Our butler Xiaohui is very thoughtful and meticulous. He can always take the initiative to think of our needs in advance and arrange them properly. He communicates well and responds quickly, making us feel at home. Thank you so much 🙏🏻

        The hotel is halfway up the mountain, the mountain is full of green, full of tea gardens, and the scenery is beautiful. My husband and I like it very much. The hotel room is very big, the facilities are very new, clean and tidy, the bed is comfortable, and the quilt and pillow feel like the sun has been exposed. Smells good. Background music, automatic curtains, full green balcony are all our favorites.
        The breakfast is in the Chinese restaurant, which is rich in variety, clean and delicious. The surrounding lake is beautiful. The children push the door and come out to feed the koi. The koi scramble for food. After enjoying the afternoon tea on the top of the mountain comfortably, we slowly walked down the trail, feeling happy and relaxed; our two-day dinner was also served at the Chinese restaurant.
        After dinner, I went to the hot spring for a walk, because the hot spring only accepts hotel guests, so everything is so clean and tidy, I like it very much.
        There are also frisbees and small footballs suitable for children to play on the lawn outside the hotel, and there is also a children's playground on the mountain.
        The road to the top of the mountain is very steep. The hotel arranges car transfers at any time. No matter where a car passes by in the hotel area, it will stop and ask if you want to pick it up. It is so convenient and the service is really good.
         The minibar is free to drink, and if you need to deliver water and tea bags, a small robot will be arranged to serve.
         Here I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the housekeeper Xiaohui for his thoughtful service, for letting us spend three days and two nights in Hantian pleasant and relaxing, and then we will arrange for our parents to come and relax on vacation.

The place is also huge, and surrounded by tea hills and bamboo forests, it feels good. Basically, we have experienced all the projects we can participate in: hot springs, afternoon tea on the top of the mountain, entertainment room (slides, table tennis, billiards), feeding koi and geese, musical fountains, singing bowls, tea museum, glass plank road, tea mountain hiking.
If there is a shortage of food, it is expensive and small, and the taste is very good. It can be made into a private kitchen grade. There are no other choices around, so every meal has to be solved in the hotel. The buffet breakfast is also relatively average, and there is no buffet dinner. , It's a big pity in terms of catering, I hope it will be improved next time.

The dishes are more in line with the taste of Jiangsu and Zhejiang people, small and delicate, and the taste is not bad. The most intimate thing is that when we left, the hotel steward specially packed coffee for us, which can be more refreshing to drink on the road, too careful.

msg:The cloudy and rainy weather disrupted all the plans to go to the beach for autumn vacation, so I could only temporarily decide to come to Hantian Resort to soak in a hot spring! I first booked the cliff house on Ctrip. I didn’t expect that the price of the cloud house was about the same. I was going to upgrade to live at the top of the mountain. The lobby staff looked at it and helped us upgrade it for free as long as 20 yuan was added. The Yunshe house on the top of the mountain is open. Seeing Chashan, I opened the window and opened the bamboo sea. The endless green is really pleasant. However, the only drawback in the room is that the curtains were not designed properly, and the light leakage was very serious. It doesn't matter, as expected, rainy days are the best match for hot springs! The little girl was very happy about her first "bathing". Every staff member greeted her with a smile, and the one-touch telephone shuttle bus was also very quick to sense it. All slowly, the auntie in the wine area over the hot spring pool was afraid that the child would be too hot in the hot spring pool. She poured tea and delivered water, and even cut apples for the child to eat. The service is much better than that of Hantian in Tianmuli. I will bring it after a while. Parents come back! ♨️🧡

Considering the situation of avoiding too many people gathering, the total number of rooms in Anji Hantian Resort is 124. The hotel is located on the mountain, divided into the main building, Yaju and Longyi Building. People will not be concentrated together. It felt safer, so I chose the 200-square-meter Yunshe Junlin Suite in Longyi Building. First, after the reservation is completed, the hotel will contact the hotel housekeeper by phone before the trip. The housekeeper Xiaojie is very warm and patient to inform some local epidemic prevention and control requirements. The introduction of the hotel's special services, etc., made me feel at ease before traveling. When we arrived at the hotel, the housekeeper Xiaojie was very warm and greeted at the entrance of the hotel lobby. The check-in staff were also very warm and patient. After completing the check-in very smoothly, the housekeeper and a little brother helped us carry our luggage and took the hotel shuttle bus to the suite on the top of the mountain. The shuttle bus is available 24 hours a day. If you need to inform any service staff, they will contact the shuttle driver to pick you up. Every shuttle master has a very good attitude. The weather is hot and they are very hard. The layout of the suite is reasonable, a**ospheric, and the facilities are complete and high-end. The large floor-to-ceiling glass wall makes the room viewing experience very good. The hotel's breakfast is rich and satisfying, the service is thoughtful, the service in the Chinese restaurant is satisfactory, and the special dishes are good. In addition, there are not enough items for children to play as a parent-child hotel. Overall, the resort I stayed in this time felt very good. The location of the hotel was excellent. I was not disappointed. I hope to stay again in the spring and autumn.

The disadvantage is that the software needs to be further improved, and the waiter will come up to clean up during the breakfast, which may be approaching 10 o'clock. A small incident before leaving took a toll on satisfaction. The two battery cars were staggered in front of the hotel lobby and kept on both sides of the road, with a distance of one car in the middle, so our car could only temporarily park in the opposite direction in front of one car because we had to pick up the two luggage at the door, and the waiter stopped the car. Complain, of course, it is not appropriate to park in this way, but the reason is that the hotel's two battery cars blocked the way to and from the direction.

msg:The first evaluation, unexpectedly, the environment is very good, Manpo White Tea Mountain, there are activity rooms, hot springs, cafes, Chinese restaurant chefs are very good, not including breakfast, I have eaten three times. Compared with Qiandao Lake and Mogan Mountain, which have been visited many times around Zhejiang, I think this hotel is very cost-effective. It is 1,2,000 during holidays, and only 6,700 yuan in normal times.

msg:Hantian's appoin**ent was delayed for a year due to the epidemic. When I first arrived at Hantian, I was a little surprised by its size. The shuttle bus that came and went was busy. Ya Ju, who took the view into the room, was relaxed and happy, and the smile of the serving aunt was very warm. Welcome fruits and minibars are readily available, and put a tank of water to relieve fatigue. Three days and two nights seemed not to be enough. Follow the on-call shuttle bus to experience the music of bowl therapy, soothe the mind and relax. The Hanfu of Sixiantang benefits from the dressing of Auntie's skillful hands. Although the travel shoot is a bit streamlined, it is stronger in the later stage. The Chinese restaurant is built around the water, and the musical fountain on weekends adds to its splendor. The dishes do not step on thunder, and the dim sum is very standard. As for breakfast, it is better than many five-star hotels, with rich varieties and fresh ingredients, which will start the day full of energy. The mountain top swimming pool is intoxicating blue in the green embrace, leaving a lot of laughter and laughter. Go to a hot spring, there are also considerate and thoughtful service, reminding you to replenish water in time. The baby likes the wormwood pool the most. She said that it looks like a warm emerald under the light. The White Tea House seems to be still under construction, and the expectations were rough, but the results exceeded expectations. Going slowly, there are various forms, which not only deepens the tea culture and understands the development of white tea, but also makes the material conditions and life of the people more secure and auspicious. The small bamboo dragonfly fits perfectly seamlessly, showing the agility of a little water, and we are amazed. Recreation room, sports room...waiting for everyone to unlock. Butler service, self-driving license is reported in advance, the feeling of smooth travel is super cool 😊 Two cups of cold brewed coffee are specially made when leaving. Han Tian we will come again. Thanks to the housekeeper Xiaojie, the aunt in the guest room, the shuttle drivers, and the meeting.

Hygiene: Hygiene is in good condition; rooms are clean and tidy
Service: The staff are very friendly

Environment: Halfway up the mountain, surrounded by tea fields, the staggered architectural layout and the winding path design of the moving lines satisfy the imagination of being able to escape from the world.

I came here by car with 2 friends and it was a very comfortable stay.

The hotel's food and beverage prices are moderate; the hot springs are very artistic; the cafe on the top of the mountain is very suitable for reading and daze, and the milk tea drink is delicious.

The fly in the oin**ent is: the hotel room corridor is very hot; the first time I cleaned the room, the bathroom left water stains and peculiar smell, and it was dealt with after I told the front desk, which is still very good.

In order to avoid the noise of the scenic spot, we chose Hantian. From tea fields, bamboo forests, mountain paths to hot springs and singing bowls, we walked almost every road in Hantian in 2 days, and encountered many scenery on the way.
The accommodation is divided into downhill and uphill. The rooms on the mountain are built along the mountain. Although there is a distance from the downhill to the mountain, the shuttle bus is very convenient. The Mid-Autumn Festival hotel presents fruits and moon cakes, and the restaurant also presents osmanthus cakes; regardless of the environment or service , are very suitable for family, parent-child travel.
If you come to Hantian in the near future, you must go to the cafe on the top of the mountain and sit on the terrace for a while, smell the sweet-scented osmanthus in the breeze, feel the fragrance of the sweet-scented sweet-scented osmanthus in the breeze, and enjoy the beautiful scenery from afar.

The service is very good and responsive. My housekeeper, Xiaojie, contacted me the day before the trip and will arrange my needs in advance.
The room comes with a hot spring ticket. The hot spring is a Hantian feature and it is very clean. There are five small soups, but a simple bubble for an hour is enough.

msg:The first time I stayed at this hotel, I booked a room on Friday when the summer vacation was about to end. The overall feeling was good, and the comfort was okay. The room in Yunshe was booked, and there is a reason for the high price. Bonus points: First, the hotel's hot springs are really good, and they are also divided into lemon pools, wormwood pools, and so on. Seems to be well maintained. Choose to go at a time when there are fewer people, really don't feel too comfortable. There is a cold water swimming pool on the top of the mountain, but it did not rain, but the scenery is still very good. Second, the service staff is in place. In particular, the service staff of the hot spring pool are very warm and tell you where to replenish water and where to steam. At the same time, the cleaning of the hot springs is also in place. There is also a shuttle bus master who is also very enthusiastic. Butler Xiaohui is always on call. It is recommended that the above-mentioned bosses should add chicken thighs. The third is that the dining environment of Shuixieju Chinese restaurant is relatively good, the buffet breakfast is relatively rich, and there are many choices. Fourth, the shuttle bus is on call, which is really convenient. The above are plus points. Disadvantages: First, the singing bowl physiotherapy course provided by the hotel. I wanted to relax for an hour, but I was bitten by the mosquitoes in the closed room for three bags, and I couldn't grasp it. It felt very painful. Second, the dinner at Shuixieju Chinese Restaurant was really a failure. For example, one of the attached pictures is a photo on the price list, and the other is a real shot of the actual dish. The local pork is actually more pickled vegetables and bamboo shoots, and the meat is obviously the kind that has been cooked several times. Except for one Sichuan-flavored beef slice, the other dishes are really not that good. Of course, we ordered about seven dishes, which cannot be generalized. The price/performance ratio is really not high (although the dishes are relatively unpalatable, but there are also one or two not-so-beautiful Internet celebrities who are scratching their heads and taking pictures). The third is that the quality of the hotel guests is uneven. When they went to bed at 11 o'clock in the evening, the next room was still like a chicken blood. From the point of view of the traffic environment, the place is still relatively remote, generally spending or playing near the hotel, and there is no other place to go. The victory is in the hotel environment and service, so the overall evaluation is good. Will consider staying next year.

        The resort is really hidden among the bamboo forests among the mountains, wetlands and streams, and the scenery is breathtaking. We booked a cliff dwelling room with a sweeping view of the cascading terraces.
        After checking in, the hotel provided us with a butler very considerately. The butler's meticulous and thoughtful service allowed us to enjoy a peninsula-style holiday experience.
         The resort facilities are all available, and there is basically no need to go out after checking in. There are chess and card, table tennis, coffee shop☕️, hot spring♨️. I especially like the open-air swimming pool. The Japanese restaurant 168's two-person set menu is very cost-effective.
        But here I still want to make a small suggestion. It would be perfect if there is a luggage rack in the room.

msg:Anji ~ "Safe and auspicious, the heart of the house is happy". Come to Anji to choose this hotel.
Transportation: You can just follow the navigation. The only downside is that there is no underground parking lot. Huzhou's recent high temperature approaching 40 degrees is like a steamer.

Hygiene: The standard of a five-star hotel does not say, of course, there are still some "uninvited guests" in the room occasionally, so you must close the windows when you go out.
Environment: It's amazing. The water town in the south of the Yangtze River, the bamboo forest and the green sea, and the green eyes are full of green. If you come to catch the tea picking season before and after Qingming, it should be an even more pleasant journey to change your lungs. The Shuixieju restaurant in the hotel has many local specialties, and the breakfast buffet is also very rich. There is also a Hanfu experience hall next to the restaurant. Each room is given a one-hour Hanfu experience coupon. The staff will help to comb the hair accessories. If you are interested, you can also ask professional photographers to take pictures. I happened to take a few pictures for the children after a thunderstorm. This photo has the artistic conception of the misty rain in the south of the Yangtze River.
There is an open-air swimming pool on the top of the mountain, and there is a cafe next to it, which is said to be a place for Internet celebrities to check in. If you live in Yaju, you can open the curtains and enjoy the lush greenery. However, the restaurants and hot springs are all at the foot of the mountain and you need to take a shuttle bus. It takes two or three minutes to arrive. This time, the big bed room of the hot spring room is more convenient. Anji white tea is quite famous. There is also a white tea museum in the hotel. It is also a good experience to go there to escape the summer and learn about ancient Chinese tea culture.

For well-known reasons, I did a 2-day parent-child tour of Anji, and I was very lucky to be able to book Anji Hantian Resort during the summer vacation. The hotel housekeeper, Xiaohui, joined me one day in advance, informed the hotel's various supporting services, made reservation details, and helped me deliver a full set of several boxes of luggage to the room when I was having lunch, and also when I checked out, very caring and warm . It's almost like you micro him and respond immediately. There are also sneakers and bathrobes for children. All in all, 120 points for service. On a hot day, a suit and tie looks hard.
The hotel has a very local bamboo forest, the tea mountain is unique, and the floor-to-ceiling windows of the cliff dwelling. When the curtains are opened, the beautiful scenery of the mountains is amazing! I really like the Hanfu costume rental + follow-up photography presented by the hotel, and it is also the finishing touch. It happened that the sky was beautiful, and it was not too hot and not exposed to the sun at 13 o'clock that day. Take a set of children's fun pictures. The swimming pool is also very clean, go in the evening, the sun is warm and comfortable, and the Chinese restaurant dishes are also delicious. Parents with sufficient budget suggest to stay in Hantian for a few more days, which is very suitable for a daze vacation. Finally write a poem to end this journey

msg:Anji Travel Notes
1. The Natural History Museum is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. If you have a baby, remember to bring a stroller and make an appoin**ent in advance. It is recommended to play for an hour and a half, and all the 7 halls have been walked through. Dinosaur Museum, Oceanarium are good.
2. Next to Shiguang Slow Banquet is a restaurant opened in a sell-out center. There are too many people at noon on weekends, and the food tastes okay.
3. The hotel can only be checked in at 15:00. The outdoor swimming pool is next to the top room. It is very good. It is recommended that those with children should consider changing their swimsuits. The room from the swimming pool directly back to the top of the mountain is also very close. Even if the indoor air conditioner is large, the child should be placed directly in the bathtub in the room.
4. Hanfu Brigade Filming made a special unexpected film. Because the hotel itself has beautiful scenery and few people in the summer, after breakfast in the morning, I have to go to the next photo shoot to start combing my hair and changing clothes. The lady who combed her hair was very attentive, and the two babies were very satisfied with their vows.
5. The books of the Mountaintop Cafe are all recent bestsellers, which shows that the hotel is managed carefully.
6. The Chinese restaurant in Anji Hantian is good for breakfast and dinner. There are many varieties. The baby is very happy and the service is also very good.
7. There is skiing in Anji in winter. You can drive around on the mountain road. In winter, you can take a hot spring and enjoy a different scenery. Anji should come again.
8. Drifting is really the same as tropical storms, all soaked in water, except for extra sets of clothes (including underwear), mobile phones are stored. Because we have a baby, we chose the North Zhejiang Grand Canyon which is the least exciting. We originally wanted to have a meal after rafting, but we could only go back to the hotel to take a bath after we were all wet. Fortunately, the hotel can deliver meals to the room. In the afternoon, there is a heavy rain in Anji. After taking a bath with the baby, eating some hot noodles and taking a nap, it is still very good.

msg:Write the conclusion in the front: strongly strongly Amway this hotel! Taking advantage of my daughter's first birthday, I took my parents on a vacation around the area. I chose Hantian for a long time. I stayed in the exclusive double room and the exclusive twin room. In the end, the family was very satisfied and the experience was worth it.

Transportation: You can drive for one and a half hours from Hangzhou, and the road is very smooth and not difficult to find at all.

Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy, the restaurant is also good, the public area is ok except for the children's playground too many people and the carpet is dirty

Environment: first class! ! The view from both rooms is very good. The whole hotel has the taste of paradise. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers. The restaurant is built near the lake. There are black swans in the lake. The view from the top of the mountain is also very, very good, overlooking the entire tea garden.

Service: Focus on service! ! I have basically stayed in all five-star hotel brands, and Hantian's service is no.1☝🏻. Because it was a child's birthday who wanted to set up the room, I contacted the hotel manager Cao in advance. Manager Cao was very straightforward. First, he helped me measure the size of the room, and then found a more spacious and bright venue (Hanfu Hall) for me, and helped me receive materials by express delivery. On the birthday of the child, I organized staff to help me assemble and install it. Friends who have done balloon parties should know that it is very troublesome to set up. Manager Cao said "Leave it to me", and finally it was really done! ! Mr. Yang from the Hanfu Museum also worked overtime to wait for us to take a good photo. I am really thankful to my wife! ! The children really had a successful and unforgettable birthday~ In addition, Hantian's careful service can be reflected everywhere during the two days of stay. The staff are very friendly to children. The back of the room did not forget to give us a few bottles of water and told us to drink more water in the hot weather. These little details are very heart-warming. Here I step on the Banyan Tree Anji. I have lived there and the service is really average. Compared with Hantian, Banyan Tree will appear more indifferent.

Finally, I will summarize the highlights of Hantian for your reference. It is highly recommended to bring the whole family to play for two days!
1, the food is good, the hotel is completely enough
2. It is suitable for all ages, the elderly take a hot spring bath, and children have various amu*****t projects
3. There are a lot of photo-taking points, and the scenery is first-class
4. Good service! Live comfortably!

msg:First of all giving five stars mainly because our housekeeper Xiaojuan's service is very thoughtful, give a big like👍

Mainly reflected in the following points:
1. Warm and friendly attitude, will interact with the baby, and actively ask if you need help
2. Respond and answer questions in a timely manner, and sincerely address the needs of guests. For example, we asked about the nearby mother and baby shop and she shared a small shop with affordable price not far from the hotel. The reason why I think it's affordable is because I only have one bottle of bottle cleaner and I didn't buy it, and there is a small shop a few hundred meters away that sells exactly the same thing.
3. Delicate thought for the sake of customers. For example, on the first day of our stay, we saw that we had a baby and quickly arranged a guardrail. When you see your baby being bitten by mosquitoes, offer to help provide mosquito repellents.

Because it is the first time to travel with a baby, I am a little worried, but the overall feeling is that the staff are very friendly and suitable for parent-child travel.
Baby meal: When we order beef stew, we will tell you not to add seasoning + less oil. If you change the taste, you will ask for a gnocchi soup (it seems to be called this name). There are small shrimp + mushrooms + gnocchi in it. It is very chewy, and the baby likes it very much. It is also without any condiments. It is a big bowl. If adults don't like it, it can be served with Sichuan cuisine. Boiled beef is recommended. For baby activities, there is an indoor and an outdoor children's playground, and there are peacocks + pheasants outdoors. You can go to hot springs and swimming pools. There is also a Sixiantang next to the restaurant with children's books + chess and cards and other facilities.

In addition to Xiaojuan, I would also like to commend Guan Xiujuan. She is a staff member in the women's changing room in the hot spring. Seeing that I was in a hurry with my baby, she took the initiative to help protect the baby. She also told me to take a dry bath towel to avoid The baby is cold. Later, when I came out, I saw that the baby was bitten by mosquitoes and put mosquito repellent stickers on us and warmly greeted us to come back the next day. I was very moved, so I quickly looked at her badge and wrote down her name, but I was a little unsure if I remembered it accurately because I was busy with the baby, but I still wanted to express my gratitude. There is also a little girl in the restaurant. She has never had a badge and I don't know her name, but she can be seen every morning and evening at dinner, mainly in the middle and rear areas, and she looks young. We lost a bowl on the first day of eating and she helped us collect it and return it to us. During breakfast, she would walk around with a drink cart, and when I needed coffee, she would happily tell me how she researched how to make coffee better. I drank it and it tasted better than coffee I remember, not so bitter. These little bit of kind and friendly details add up to an overall great experience.

Finally, some suggestions: bring the children back from the outside at night and call a shuttle bus at the front desk to go to Yaju. Because the children were a little tired all day, we kept standing outside waiting for the bus. Taking the shuttle bus is also very fast in our experience, and many times there are no people. As a result, the car just arrived, and the uncle at the door was helping another car park, so he didn't pay attention. Suddenly rushing out from the lobby, seven or eight people, old and young, all dressed in nightgowns, rushed directly into the car and sat down. Because I didn't rob them with my child, I had to go to the front desk to call for another one. The overall reason is mainly this group of unqualified people, but I also want to give a suggestion to the hotel, whether it is possible to pull a guardrail at the entrance of the lobby when there are many people, so that at least order can be achieved, first-come-last-arrival, rather than obeying Rules for guests to be patient. The front desk of the hotel and the housekeeper Xiaojuan expressed their apologies and made suggestions here, hoping to improve in this regard. In addition, if you live in a cliff dwelling, you can see insects every day. If you mind, it may be better to recommend the mountain.

Two big and one small order 3 dishes for over 200 yuan, and I am full. The breakfast is also ok. My favorite is noodles, fat intestine topping and radish brisket topping. My husband ate two bowls, and overall he is very satisfied, suitable for vacation

From the terrace of the room, I can directly view the entire park from the top of the mountain. The mountain breeze was blowing, and the smell of the forest after the showers made me unable to resist a few more sniffs.
🏠Package: The hotel has restaurants with different flavors of Chinese food and Western food, which are suitable for people with different tastes. There are also hot springs, swimming pools, singing bowl concerts, lawn canopies, cafes, bistros, etc. I have experienced the above, and I really relaxed physically and mentally in two days.
🔔Service: From the uncle of the doorman entering the park to the reception staff in the lobby, to the shuttle bus, the cleaning aunt, and every staff member of the hot spring, it feels like a spring breeze, always so kind, with any I will try my best to meet the requirements, and it really feels like home.
Last but not least, thank you Jiashuai! He was really attentive, many problems were considered for us, and he gave us suitable suggestions and solutions. This trip to Anji is really comfortable and safe!

msg:Second time to Hantian. Compared with two years ago, there are more amu*****t halls and outdoor sports lawns, and the experience is better. The hot springs in Hantian are my favorite. They are only open to hotel guests. The hot springs in the outdoor mountains, forests, bamboos and seas are very comfortable. The hot spring water is changed every day, and because there are few people, the water quality is very good. Water room is readily available. This time, I stayed in the exclusive half-mountain twin room. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the room and the scenery are excellent. I sit on the balcony and drink tea and feel the fragrance of birds and flowers. I also like the cafe on the top of the mountain. 128 can enjoy the joy of afternoon tea in a private room. After afternoon tea, you can also climb the mountain and visit the tea fields. It is very convenient to have a shuttle bus back and forth. Anji is also a treasure land of feng shui, and I would like to come again next time. The service of the staff is also very attentive. We left things at the hotel, and they arranged the delivery as soon as possible and also paid for the freight. I am really grateful.

msg:Hantian is the most satisfactory hotel the family has stayed in these days. I booked a hot spring exclusive twin room, and it is just right for 3 adults and 1 to take a nap. We only stayed for 2 nights and could really feel the humanized service of this hotel, which was really responsive. Because of the large number of people staying, the hotel provided us with quilts, buckwheat pillows, toothbrushes, slippers, pesticides, Toilet water, mineral water, beverages.
Wechat 1-to-1 reply is convenient and fast. Special thanks to Cao Jiashuai in the front office. He can also reply to various questions of the guests at the first time in the middle of the night. The cave shoes provided in the room are very convenient for swimming and hot springs. The hotel car can be picked up in 1 minute. The hot spring service staff also sent tea to the hot spring pool, so that we can drink water while soaking in the hot spring. From these small details, we can feel the care of the staff for the guests, and the taste of the hotel's cooking. It's also very good. These days my husband and grandma have been praising the hotel for its good service. My husband has given the hotel Amway to his colleagues!
Reminder: Mosquito repellents are on the bedside table, and swimming caps must be worn in the pool.

msg:It was really an unexpected encounter with Han Tian! I was deceived by other homestay photos, and when I arrived, it was construction and there was no swimming pool waterproofing, so I decided to refund the money and change the hotel. Fortunately, I chose Hantian, the big bed room in the middle of the mountain and the hot spring, and the price is also cheap. After the reservation was made, Manager Cao of the hotel immediately served as a butler service, added WeChat, asked us for the license plate, and sent the hotel's careful information. All kinds of introduction and guidance, very meticulous and considerate. Because I was delayed by the last hotel, I went to Hantian after dinner. It was dark, but as soon as I entered the lobby, the two managers of the hotel received a very warm reception, which swept away the previous unhappiness. The manager of the hotel, Zheng Xiujuan, also sent us upstairs with great enthusiasm, and introduced various kinds of introductions into the room. She was very kind and professional. Although the room facilities were a little ordinary, but because of her enthusiasm, I felt that the value of a five-star hotel was highlighted. That's true The caring for customers and the new service, praise for her! In the evening, I went to the hot spring. In fact, the hot spring in summer has a wonderful feeling. It is not unbearable. The hot spring among the mountains, forests and bamboos, accompanied by the occasional stars of fireflies, is very romantic and cool!
The breakfast on the second day was also very good, and the taste was very good. After eating, I went to the swimming pool on the top of the mountain. The scenery was super good, and there were few people.
Then there is the entertainment hall in the hotel lobby, which is really fun. On such a hot day, there are game machines, pool tables, basketball hoops, table tennis, etc. It is very fun. You can play there after you check out. The hotel is also in a scenic spot, very beautiful!
I would like to thank Manager Cao Jiashuai and Manager Zheng Xiujuan for their enthusiastic care and service, which left a deep impression on the short-lived relationship. I will definitely come back in winter!
Take your child's recommendation to the nearby Zhejiang Museum of Natural History Anji Pavilion, a good place for free strolling!

msg:Hangzhou is about 1 hour and 20 minutes away from the urban area.
The resort environment is really nice. Butler service, you will be contacted before moving in. Important times will be notified every day. I forgot to mute when I went to bed at night, and I sent a message every morning after 7 o'clock to remind me to have breakfast, which affected my sleep a bit.
During the day, you can walk or take the hotel shuttle bus, go to the mountaintop cafe to read a book, stay in a daze, and soak in the hot spring at night.
There is an open-air swimming pool at the entrance of the mountain top cafe. In summer, you can swim while watching the mountain view, which should be very leisurely.
The hot spring is just a 3-minute walk from the hotel lobby. It seems that there are 7 or 8 pools. On the day we went, because there were few people, only 5 were opened, but it was enough for two people.
There is an entertainment area on the first floor of the hotel, and the equipment is a bit old.
The breakfast was mediocre, nothing special.
There is also Songming Tea Expo Park in the resort, which can be reached by shuttle bus.
There are tea culture introduction and tea tasting experience. There is a glass plank road outside, which is not high and does not feel much.

During this holiday, there were very few guests during the epidemic, but the service quality of the hotel was still very high, especially the housekeeper Xiaojuan, who was professional and serious in her work. The day of check-in coincided with his wife's birthday. Xiaojuan immediately contacted the food and beverage depar**ent to make a cake for free, and checked in. On the second day, asking about our needs from time to time made us feel at home.
The hotel's hot springs are also more distinctive, and the hotel's dishes are also very good, very suitable for a 1-2 day vacation
Looking forward to going with friends next time.

On the morning of the departure day, we received a phone call from the housekeeper saying that the reserved Yuntai room could not be checked in because of the heavy snow. The service of the hotel is very good. There is a full-time butler at any time. The butler Feng Yue is really very enthusiastic and professional. It makes people feel comfortable and warm, and there is no accident. Next time, I will bring the whole family together for the New Year. As for the beautiful scenery, I don't say anything. The first is that there are too few dining options, and the second is that the entertainment cable car and Feilongtai are still under construction. I hope it will be better next time.

Although it is not on the mountain, the room does not see much scenery, but it is clean and spacious, with complete facilities, and it is very comfortable to live in. Strong family travel choice twin room, much more spacious than double room!
🍚 Catering: It is convenient to travel. Lunch and dinner are all handled in the hotel's Chinese restaurant. There are many dishes to choose from. The spring seasonal menu is very good, and the price is acceptable.
☂️Facilities: Except the cute pet paradise is a bit disappointing (just a peacock, a rabbit), other supporting and entertainment facilities are very rich. The outdoor swimming pool can only be seen in cold weather, but fortunately there are hot springs to soak in, and the indoor activity room can also play for a long time because there are few people. But the next day, I was a little bored and didn’t know what to do, so I checked out early in the morning and went to the surrounding attractions to play. It is recommended to add some seasonal activities such as fruit and vegetable picking and digging bamboo shoots.

The room is the cliff dwelling, where you can see the bamboo forest and tea garden. In autumn and winter, the mountains are cold and foggy, giving it a fairyland feel.

🧹Sanitation: OK The room is relatively clean. The size is suitable for couples or a person to relax. The cleaning aunt was very diligent, and she cleaned up when she came back from breakfast. The rooms are well equipped. Those who like to take a bath can bring their own bath balls. There are few hotels, and some provide plum snacks and welcome fruits.

🍃Environment: Mid-mountain scenery, with mountains, bamboo forests and tea gardens, very quiet. The hotel needs to take electric cars up and down to the cafes, restaurants or guest rooms, but you can walk not very far.

🔔Service: The service is ok, every staff member greets you with a smile and responds to your needs. The food and beverage taste of Shuixieju is also good. The buffet breakfast is also rich, there are no fancy things, but the taste is still relatively recognized. There are many kinds of beer in the cafe, and the price is not expensive. You can try beer from various countries. The hotel is equipped with a ktv and a private movie room. The equipment feels good. There are several rooms. Unfortunately, this time I only discovered it on the last day and did not experience it.

The housekeeper Feng Yue is serious and amiable.

The environment was sent to the circle of friends and was asked by many people!
The next afternoon, I came to Sixiantang to experience Hanfu. The clothes are very delicate and not cheap at all. Hairstyle props will help and give suggestions. The service is very patient and gentle. I really love it and must praise it! The life of taking pictures and vacationing with my girlfriends is so happy.

On the mountain outside the hot spring, there are seven pools from the bottom to the top. Pick one that is not crowded. There is a room halfway up the mountain where you can drink and rest. You can measure your blood pressure and send ginger tea to the hot spring pool for free. ,thoughtful.
The room is so big! All bathroom fixtures are Toto.
There are activity rooms on the first floor, two ping pong tables, two billiards, basketball machines, darts and more. There is free supply of tea.
The whole feels friendly and welcoming. Humanized love is reflected everywhere.
Mountaintop Coffee enjoys the scenery of 10,000 acres of tea gardens, and there are mountain roads to climb mountains on both sides.
The dishes of Shuixieju must be eaten! The dishes are delicious and the ingredients are exquisite. I feel that the owner is really loving!

In the morning, the housekeeper said that it was snowing heavily, so I got up excitedly and looked at it. I haven't seen such heavy snow for a long, long time! The hotel and the snow are really well matched. The panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows of the restaurant, while enjoying the snow while dining, are unimaginable. The service of the staff is really good. Special thanks to my housekeeper, Cao Jiashuai, for letting us experience such a great trip! Today is really hard work for the little brothers and sisters of the hotel to remove snow! It's inconvenient to travel when it snows, so it's super interesting to experience Hanfu activities at the hotel's Hanfu tube! Kids are having fun playing in the snow! You can also take a hot spring bath! What a perfect day!

About the hot springs: There are 7 pools. There are many children when I go on Sunday, and there are a lot fewer people when I go on Monday night. It is a little inconvenient to have to bring a bathrobe from the room by yourself, and there is no towel by the pool, only a towel in the box, it will be very cold if you get wet and wipe it.

When you are tired, you can play billiards, table tennis and other recreational activities in the leisure room. Remember to bring a bathrobe in the room when you soak in the hot spring at night. After soaking for a while, you will feel comfortable. The breakfast is very rich. Remember to go early, too many people. The location is not good. Look, if you have time, you can go to the back mountain to climb the mountain, and the experience is good.

Arrived at night, the housekeeper Zheng Xiujuan contacted us early to remind the cold mountain to bring more clothes. After arriving at the hotel, the service was attentive and enthusiastic, and I also carefully prepared toiletries and pajamas for the children.

The food in the Chinese restaurant of the hotel tastes very good and the price is very good. I wanted to try the western restaurant at noon the next day, but the breakfast was too rich~

The room was booked on the cliff house. The room is actually on the cliff. The big balcony can see the tea mountain in the distance. You can also enjoy the scenery while soaking in the bathtub. There is a detail that the bathtub faucet will automatically have music when it is turned on~

In the evening, I went to the hotel to soak in the hot springs. The butler also gave us a hand card in advance. The soup pool is very comfortable. There are also slate rooms and dry steam rooms. The environmental facilities are first-class. You can also go to the water bar to drink ginger tea for a while.

All in all, this hotel has first-class service, first-class facilities and first-class environment.

msg:I went to Anji Hantian Resort Hotel with my girlfriend during Chris**as. The ultimate service experience was touching.
Service:
Attentive service, the scarf was left in the hot spring, and the butler delivered it directly to me, which is really great. Generally, check-in is at 2 pm and check-out is at 12 noon. If the room conditions permit, you can check in early if the room is not tight that day. , the housekeeper will be very considerate and help you to delay check-out for free. You will also get free fruit snacks when you check into the hotel. All the drinks and snacks in the room are free. The hotel also gave you a small gift when you left. After checking out, we were waiting for the bus in the hotel lobby. The housekeeper was very considerate and gave us free coffee and snacks. The ultimate service definitely warmed our hearts.
Room:
We booked a cliff room. It is on the cliff. The room environment is very good. The bed is very big. The bathtub is facing the natural scenery. Lying in it and taking a bath, facing the large floor-to-ceiling windows, the scenery is unobstructed. Watching the sunset in the early morning is like a human being. wonderland. There is also a balcony outside, and it will be very pleasant to drink afternoon tea on the balcony in autumn. The room equipment is relatively new, including electric curtains and a **all genie. The lights in the cloakroom are sensor-controlled. There was something wrong with my room. It turned on several times in the middle of the night. I reported it for repair the next day.
Hot spring:
You have to bring your own swimsuit, towels are provided, or you can bring the nightgown in the room. The housekeeper asked us to bring the bathrobe, but in fact, you can ask the waiter to change the towel for you, and you don’t need to bring the bathrobe if it gets wet. When I go back, I can get a new one. There are about 7 soup pools. The first one is the milk bath. It is very beautiful to take pictures and full of fairy spirit. Secondly, the white tea poison soup is very unique and has a fragrant aroma. There are also saunas, rest rooms, spa rooms, and canteens. , we went there on Chris**as, the hotel was full, but when we went there in the afternoon, there were not many people, it was just right, which is great
🍃Hotel environment:
There are Chinese restaurants and Western restaurants. The Western restaurant is halfway up the mountain. You need to make a reservation one hour in advance. The food is pretty good. At the top is the Yaju room. There is a cafe over there. There is a shuttle bus to and from the mountain. There is also a Hanfu experience center. It is free for one person when booking a room. It is one hour for one person. If you buy it by yourself, it is 50 yuan for two hours, which is not expensive. Entertainment includes a private cinema and KTV, and the lobby also has billiards, game consoles, basketball, etc. When you book a room, you will also receive a singing bowl experience as a gift. You can experience the healing power of sound on site, which is very relaxing. There are about 20 seats in the room. It is recommended to arrive early, otherwise there will be no seats and you will have to fill in. There are too many seats and you will not be able to lie down.
🍃Scenic area environment:
The hotel is located in a scenic area. The vast tea mountains and bamboo forests are so big that we booked it for one night and couldn't finish the tour. It is recommended that we choose two nights as the time arrangement is more reasonable.
🔔Service
The housekeeper who received us was Miss Feng Yue. She was kind-hearted and very patient. She contacted us in advance and arranged our itinerary. She accompanied us to the top of the mountain and helped us book a room. If we had any questions, she would be patient and meticulous. We solved it and made us feel the ultimate experience.
Finally, I attach the beautiful photos taken in Hantian, I hope it can help everyone.

The mountain cafe and swimming pool have a great view, and the hanging chairs and round tables and chairs are spotlessly clean. The room is clean and hygienic, the breakfast is not too rich, but the quality and taste are good. Let’s talk about a few shortcomings. The liquid outlet of the sanitary napkin hand sanitizer bottle is rusty. Every time you press it, the rust and the hand sanitizer are mixed together. There is no lotion in the wash bag (sent to the front desk on the phone). In several hot spring pools, only one has a water temperature of 39 degrees, and the others are only about 36 degrees, which is too cold. It can be said that there is only one pool for bathing, and I went to the hot springs, so I was very disappointed, which directly affected the overall experience and mood. Checking out in the morning, I saw the cleaning attendant in the elevator. After looking at each other, I didn't say hello, hoping to strengthen the training.

 ～～If there is something not so good, then it is the hot spring. Although it is a hot spring resort, this hot spring is really far from others. There is no small fish pond or various functional pools, so it is more like a bathhouse! But other places can still give 5 stars! The whole staying experience is still very good!

It is said that the replacement of accessories may improve in the future.
The staff are warm and considerate and respond quickly, especially the exclusive housekeeper Zheng Xiujuan, who is very attentive and professional, and knows that my husband has a small surprise for his birthday 😊 like it
Hot springs are ok, and the service staff next to them are equally enthusiastic and thoughtful. On weekdays, people are less like private baths and walk very close from the room in bathrobes.
The restaurant dinner is very delicious, it shouldn't be as delicious as a resort hotel should be 😂 Just close your eyes. However, the dining room seat looks a lot of stains, it may not be easy to wash. The longevity noodles given are too big, we two of us hardly eat less than half of it 😂 enough for eight people

I basically didn’t go out in the hotel for two days. It’s very interesting to play in the hotel. The hot springs are also very comfortable and clean. The aunts at the hot springs really didn’t have the service. They were a little thirsty and had ginger tea. The hotel’s dinner tasted. It's also very good, and the price is moderate, so you don't have to go out to eat. I searched the nearby attractions and there is one of Asia's largest natural museums. It's still free after 25 minutes of driving. It's worth a visit. It’s definitely the best choice for people who like to soak in hotels and don’t like to visit scenic spots. Shanghai is also very close in the past. The scenery on the top of the mountain is very good. Now the season is full of sweet-scented osmanthus, the mountain has rained and the smell of grass, just sit I was very relaxed in a daze.

The front desk took the initiative to upgrade the room and sent hot spring tickets. The singing bowl experience is good, the teacher is more professional, and it really relaxes a lot after the one-hour course. All kinds of service staff are warm and polite. A la carte in the Chinese restaurant is not expensive and tastes good. The bed is more comfortable and there are four types of pillows to choose from.
Minus items:
1. There are only four charging parking spaces, some are occupied by petrol trucks, and two are broken. After 10 o'clock in the evening, there are vacancies, and the 7kw slow charge is 1.6 yuan once. After the charge was completed the next morning, I took the initiative to move the car away, but the hotel should register the license plate number to ensure the utilization of the charging pile.
2. Although the room is big. However, the electric curtain leaked light in a gap, and the night light at the bedside was broken and couldn't be turned off. The door was not well-soundproofed and was woken up by the corridor cleaning aunt early in the morning. These are not conducive to the rest of the guests.
3. The shower mat is moldy and hot water comes slowly on the second floor. Call for a small bottle of moisturizer and bring a bottle of conditioner. These details need to be strengthened.

The hot springs are supposed to be man-made, and it’s not bad to take a bubble bath in the bamboo forest and look at the stars. Overall, the resort hotels I have stayed in in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are not bad, give it 5 points.

The hotel's hot spring area has a beautiful environment, each pool has its own characteristics, surrounded by bamboo forests, soaking in the hot springs, listening to elegant music, it is very comfortable and refreshing!
From the beginning of our stay, the butler Zheng Xiujuan began to provide meticulous and warm service! Let us feel cordial and warm!
Because there are some special needs with children, Manager Jiang from the housekeeping depar**ent helped us to reach them eagerly and quickly, which made us very touched!
I was a little worried about the dining issue before I came here. I was worried that the hotels in the mountains did not have a wealth of food choices. I did not expect: the breakfast here is very rich; the Chinese food at Shuixieju is also good. It is set by the water and you can enjoy the scenery while eating; in addition, The Pujie Western Restaurant is a pleasant surprise! Chef Li is very good at cooking and the food he cooks is delicious! We ate in the western restaurant for 8 nights. And the coffee pastry and wontons at the Peak Cafe are delicious! At night, if you are hungry, you can also order supper. Fried rice and wonton are available, which are very delicious. Therefore, some of the food we brought was not eaten, and we brought it back when we went home.
When we checked out and left the store, we hurried away and left my important accessories in the room. After we set off, Manager Jiang from the housekeeping depar**ent called and sent photos for confirmation. Butler Zheng helped me pack my pendants safely! (Wrap it in foam paper, wrap it in a towel, and put it in a box) Then send it to me by SF Express and it will arrive the next day.
️ This trip made us feel very comfortable! This hotel is very humane! The service is very warm and thoughtful! We were deeply impressed!
Thank you: Manager Jiang of the hotel room depar**ent, Manager Cao of the front office, Manager Zheng, Manager Hui of the restaurant depar**ent, Chef Li of the western restaurant, Manager Wang of the hot spring depar**ent, Liang Mingjun and Jiang Lan and other staff.
This time, we stayed for 10 days and were very satisfied! We will stay here next time we come to Anji!

A series of activities such as hot springs, parent-child activities, renting Hanfu, feeding fish, etc. are all included in the room rate. It may be a package package for Ctrip. Generally speaking, ordinary homestays during summer vacation are more expensive than this price. , The scenery is beautiful and there is a hiking trail. If it doesn’t rain, we will go climbing. The swimming pool on the roof is also good. I didn’t play in the rain this time. I should choose here again next time.

msg:Hantian is still very worthy of its old brand. There are hot springs, mountain-top swimming pools, landscape lakes, and mountain-top terrace swings. It is very suitable for family trips. The service is also very good. The attitude of the aunts or the housekeepers everywhere is very kind, if you don’t want to run too much You can choose here if you take the elderly and children and don’t want to be too tired. Two days on the weekend are just right.

The cliff house where I live is at the top of the mountain. There is a shuttle bus for the whole journey. The prepared fruits are full of fruit flavor. The tea room on the top of the mountain is open until almost 10 pm. Although the room is not particularly large, it is quiet and private. The weather is good and you can see the starry sky. The indoor TOTO bathtub is great, turn off all the lights and open the curtains, you can see the flashing fluorescent bugs and the faint starlight;
Recently, due to the impact of the epidemic, the number of tourists has been affected. The price is very complete compared to the supporting facilities of the same price. There are still more parent-child tourists. Both the breakfast hot spring and the mountain top swimming pool need to be aware of the staggered peaks. It is recommended to have dinner early and then go to the meeting. Hot spring, get up early and go to the mountain top swimming pool. Breakfast ends at 10 o’clock. If it’s a two-day trip, you can come to Hantian. If it’s a 4-5 day Anji trip, you can also visit Hantian as the first stop.

msg:A very good resort. But there are two things that I think can be improved: one is that the bed in our room squeaks when it turns over, and the duvet is also rustling and noisy all day long. Another thing is that the bathroom that looks super beautiful during the day is dark and the lights are dark at night. It is too scary when you go to the bathroom alone! Because the side and front of the toilet are mirrors! Damn! What a terrible feeling! I went to the toilet without turning on the light at night, and I saw a dark figure on the opposite side rushing over to me... I really scared myself, funny and scary. I hope you can add a roller blind in the future, so that the faint-hearted can cover the big mirror on the opposite side at night hahaha. In short, it is still very good! Worth living!

In particular, Mr. Yang from the Sixiantang, the two children heard that they can learn to make bracelets. They are very interested, Mr. Yang. I was very patient, taught them how to knit by hand, and then taught them to fold the umbrella. This is too difficult, the baby did not learn 😂 Finally, Teacher Yang gave the baby the bracelet and the small umbrella, happy! In addition, I also encountered the lessons of the little pilots, which was full of rewards!
In short, Anji Hantian is especially suitable for parents and children, swimming on the top of the mountain, doing handicrafts in Sixiantang, playing chess, painting, reading books, playing with bunny in the children's playground, climbing tea hills, enough activities, and there will be a chance to stay for two more days in the future.

msg:As a family member of a lazy person, I can’t climb mountains or walk long distances, so I always choose hotels in the scenic area, and must have swimming pools and parent-child facilities. This time, because of the travel time, which changed N times, Han Tian was finally selected. Because I have stayed at Hantian Hotel in other places twice, the impression is very good.
This time, I felt that the appearance of the hotel was not conspicuous at first, but from the lunch in the hotel on the first day, I felt relieved and knew that I had chosen the right place. Hot springs, swimming pools, and children’s playgrounds are all set up beside the mountain. Children play, and adults relax in the forest or on the top of the mountain and enjoy the scenery. The Chinese restaurant by the lake, Sixiantang, is very pleasant. Because it’s not a weekend trip. On the first afternoon in Sixiantang, I just wandered with little things. He learned to make bracelets. I read books. I was really relaxing. I can rent clothes for 50 yuan and take pictures of costumes. Suitable for commemoration. At about 5:00 pm, I went to the top of the mountain for a swim, but there was no shower on the top of the mountain, but you can wear a bathrobe and go directly to the hot spring bath. There are full bathing facilities, but there are not many places. We are on the fourth floor and the floor service is also very good. The overall experience is very good. By the way, I recommend the Zhejiang Natural Museum. The environment and display are very distinctive.

In the tea garden, you can see the bamboo sea by pushing the door and the tea mountain by pushing the window. It is really suitable for relaxing and relaxing. The hotel has its own hot springs. There are 7 or 8 hot springs in total, which is not too much, but it is more comfortable with fewer people.
For dinner, I chose Shuixieju in the hotel. The taste is good, especially the bamboo shoots.
After checking in, I found that there is also a Zhejiang Natural Museum nearby. It is very large and free. I made an appoin**ent and rushed to it immediately. I didn’t finish shopping until the museum closed. The exhibits inside are still very good. It is recommended that you take your children to see it. It takes about two minutes by car. The podcast is delivered in ten minutes, and the hotel also has a singing bowl class, which is the first experience. I feel that my body and mind are still very relaxed, and I have gained a lot of relevant knowledge.
We planned to go rafting on the second day. The breakfast was quite good, and then we took the hotel’s shuttle bus and walked around the mountain. The air in Zhushan in the early morning was really fresh and I felt very relaxed.
The housekeeper is also very good. I added WeChat as soon as I arrived at the hotel, and I would reply to any needs in time. The experience was quite good. The child’s toothbrush was also delivered by a robot.

msg:This is a very serious bad review.
I would never recommend Hantian to my friends. Although the decoration is new and the environment is good, I really don't know how the hotel manages, trains and recruits people. Deeply revealed the extremely poor service from top to bottom, as well as the extremely sensitive and shirk of responsibility, the quality of the character is really embarrassing! !

[Front desk] The only male receptionist at the front desk was very indifferent. He didn't lift his head when talking to the guests. When he arrived before 2 pm, he asked if there was an existing room. He said no. I didn't take the initiative to contact the person immediately, so you want a ghost?

[Restaurant] There is one thing to say, the food is delicious! But this restaurant has really serious service problems. After eating for 3 days, there are irritating things every day, I even wonder if this restaurant has KPIs for angry customers?
1. [Will the restaurant's life be killed if the guest drops the umbrella? 】
On the first day, on the evening of June 12, I encountered a heavy rain. I brought the long-handled umbrella in my room to the restaurant. There was an umbrella tube full of umbrellas at the door, so I put the umbrella in. As a result, after the meal was over, the umbrella tube was empty, because I was worried that there would be a dispute over the loss of property in the room, I found a slightly fat front desk in the restaurant.
We asked very politely: "Hello, what if the umbrella we brought was taken away by other guests?"
The front desk suddenly said angrily: "If you leave it at the door, you will definitely be taken away!"
We were a little inexplicable: "You didn't tell us, we didn't know that everyone would be taken away when they put them in the umbrellas."
The front desk was very impatient: "Then you see that we don't have an umbrella now, don't look for me!!" Then he ran away with the delivery tray.
Later, we came to the front desk of the hotel to explain the situation. The lady at the front desk hurriedly asked colleagues to give us another umbrella to register.
I really don't understand, is it so difficult for us to go to the front desk of the hotel and ask for such a simple matter? I believe this phenomenon of holding umbrellas is not the first day, right? This attitude reacts as if we are going to settle accounts with her.
2. [The whole staff is yin and yang strange, and the farts are big and trivial, and they must be forced to shirk on the customer's head]
On the evening of June 13 the next day, the restaurant was full (of course, no one guided us to take a seat), when we were looking for a seat in the restaurant, we saw some unpacked four-person seats, so we asked a male waiter: "You Okay, may I ask if there are four seats ready?" The waiter said, "We don't have any."... It's over? This reaction is really funny.
3. On the second night, I was seated after 7 o'clock. I ordered 8 dishes on my mobile phone. The waiter ran and said that 2 dishes were gone. It took 5 minutes to come over and said that the other 3 dishes were gone. Good guy, it's only 7pm and I ordered 5 of 8 dishes? ? There is really no other restaurant to choose from, so I let the waiter wait for us to watch and order again. The waiter brought a thick paper menu at this time (a friend was very angry, and asked if there was a paper menu the day before, and said no)
Later, when my friend paid the bill, I found that it was 900+ RMB in total, which felt wrong. After reading the next meal, I calculated an extra chicken soup of more than 200 yuan. I came to the front desk and said that I haven't ordered this, so let's remove it. Then please pay attention to the wording of the slightly fat front desk: "Oh, this is on your order, the kitchen has not yet served the food, and you have not told the waiter to remove it." I went straight to the fire and ordered 8 We didn’t have 5 of the dishes. The waiters all told us to order from the paper menu. You have to remove 2 of the dishes yourself, but you forgot to remove this one. I didn’t ask you to argue with you. It’s your responsibility. For trivial matters, do you have to forcibly blame the customer? ? I was really funny. When I got angry, I had a hypocritical smile as if I met an unreasonable guest. I didn't mean to apologize. This woman really made me feel sick! !
3.【The soup is sprinkled on the hat of the guest, without any regrets】
On the third day, June 14th, at noon, I ordered a large bowl of noodles. When the dish was served, the large spoon in the soup bowl fell off my friend's white hat on the table and spilled a piece of soup. This male waiter surnamed "Fu", He glanced down, picked up the spoon, and left without saying a word. We were all shocked. My friend was very good-natured and raised his hat to ask him if he had a tissue to wipe. He went to get the tissue without saying a word and left. I'm really disgusted.

【There are insects in the room! ! 】My friend said that he woke up early in the morning, and there was a large circle of flying insect corpses around the sink. He was frightened to death, and he reacted to the housekeeper. The housekeeper was very sorry and asked the staff to come to the door to help remove the insects. After explaining the situation to the staff member, the staff member's first reaction was: "How could there be insects? Impossible, do you keep the screens closed?" The friend said it was impossible. A circle of bugs. Staff: "Impossible, how could there be bugs, absolutely impossible"
? ? My friend is really good-natured, and I will definitely scold me. We didn't ask your hotel to take responsibility. We just wanted you to help with insect removal. Which glass heart did we hit? Do you still think that we are lying with the theme?

[Disposable bathing bag] Funny, this kind of hot spring resort bathing bag has to pay another 10 yuan per piece, and it took 15 minutes to deliver it. That's okay, our room bathtub is a round bathtub, you Why don't you give me a long tub bath bag? What's the difference between me directly soaking in a dirty bathtub


A resort of this level shouldn't have such a service, right? Hundreds of hotels a night can't have such poor service. Of course the service is also remarkable! The pick-up masters are all very good! Very enthusiastic! When the parking lot saw us tidying up the trunk, we even turned the car over and asked if we wanted to go along with us. Thank you very much! The security guards at the door are also very good. They help with umbrellas and luggage when it rains. They can feel that they are really good for the guests. I hope Hantian can take them as a service model and manage them well.

msg:I booked the hotel late during the Dragon Boat Festival. Unfortunately, I only booked a Pusu double room. It was indeed very simple. There was no balcony or view, and the floor mats were a little dirty. I don’t recommend this room type. It is recommended to stay at the top of the mountain or in other rooms with views. Because the hotel is located in the Tea Expo Garden, the scenery is quite good, with a mist-shrouded feeling and rich green plants. Those who like mountain climbing can try walking up the mountain. The best thing is the hot spring in the hotel. There seem to be 5 hot springs, mugwort, milk, etc. Even when the hotel is full, there are very few people in the hot springs. Some hot springs are empty. There is also an ocean ball hot spring that children like, located in It’s great to take photos among the bamboo forest. The hotel sent welcome fruits, and the breakfast was good and rich. The lunch and dinner were local farm dishes. Some dishes were a little salty, which may be related to the local taste. The Teppanyaki shop is halfway up the mountain and the environment is very good. Unfortunately, I didn't make a reservation. There is a children's playground above the hot spring, with some small animals, rabbits, peacocks, etc. You can also take the hotel's sightseeing car to the top of the mountain, where there is a swimming pool. You can order a cup of Anji white tea at the top of the mountain, and the view is very pleasant. There is a singing bowl sound therapy teacher in the hotel. He has one million fans. I have experienced the teacher's sleep-aiding sound therapy for free. It is a unique and comfortable experience. The housekeeper Xiaoying was very responsible and had a very good service attitude. She even gave us handmade soap she made before leaving. The aunt in the hot spring changing room was also very friendly and patient. She took the initiative to help me change the children's clothes and sprayed them with mosquito repellent. The hotel is a bit remote and far from the city or other attractions. There is Liangpeng Town nearby and there are some farmhouse restaurants. However, the Tea Expo Garden where the hotel is located is actually enough for two days. Overall, it is a relaxing and leisurely vacation trip.

Especially after dinner, the mother-in-law climbed half of the mountain and felt dizzy and uncomfortable. We met Manager Wang at the hot spring, who immediately picked up the battery tour bus up the mountain, which was so heartwarming. The hot springs delivered were very relaxing, with free tea to replenish energy, and the waiter repeatedly reminded us of the precautions, which made us feel the five-star service. Very good experience, next time you recommend a friend or colleague to come

msg:The 3 days and 2 nights of Anji tour is over. Hotel location: The hotel is about 12 kilometers away from the center of Anji by car for about half an hour, and about 6 kilometers away from the Central South Baicao Garden (Nature Museum), about 15 minutes away by car. There is no food around the hotel. It's nice to have a vacation on the weekend. If you want to play attractions, it is recommended to live near the attractions. Hotel environment: great, at the foot of the mountain. The parking lot is free, and the hotel has a free electric car pick-up and drop-off in the middle of the mountain. Shuixieju has a good eating environment. There are koi and black swan at the Shuixie Tower. There is free fish food at the bar at the entrance. I didn't go to the hot spring because the hotel has an oversized bathtub, so I can take two small pots of friends and soak in the hotel. It is very comfortable and convenient. A baby cot can be added for free, but the bed is 2 meters wide, which is enough for a family of 4 to sleep. The hot spring bed room is big enough, we only went out the next day and stayed in the hotel the rest of the time.

酒店環境很好，地理位置絕佳，早起可以步入竹海茶園，山路散步，早餐相當豐盛，享用美食的同時，還能欣賞窗外的湖景，吃完早飯，沿着湖邊棧道去喂喂錦鯉鴨子，鴛鴦和天鵝，好愜意！酒店還贈送了温泉泡湯池，邊泡湯，一邊俯瞰山景，給早春多了一份悠閑寫意。從紅酒池、艾灸池、白茶池還有小童海洋球池還有幹蒸房為你泡好後排除濕氣。
漢服拍攝款式多多，山頂下午茶、白茶博物館，吳越考古遺址博物館，豐富的免費活動排滿了一天的行程。非常感謝管家小艷，真的能無微不至的關心到每一個細節，貼心服務直至延續到我們離開安吉，給了我們一次不錯的度假體驗。

環境：抵達涵田度假村即步入了一個充滿茶香和山韻的世界。這裏的空氣帶着茶葉的清新和泥土的芳馨，這樣的香氣在城市是尋找不到的。繁密的銀杏林，悠長的竹徑，以及在輕風中搖曳的茶樹，每個元素都為這裏繪製了一幅生動的自然圖卷。早晨，陽光通過樹梢斑駁地灑在小路上，一個人漫步在這樣的環境中，有種穿越古代文人墨客筆下仙境的錯覺。

設施：設施齊全的茶山度假村，無論是室內還是室外，都相當考究。温泉泡池最吸引我的是紅酒池，一邊泡湯一邊欣賞山景。度假村最引以為傲的當屬其獨特的白茶博物館，讓賓客在專業的茶藝師引領下，深入體會茶文化的博大精深。

服務：服務細節彰顯了涵田度假村的至高標準。工作人員訓練有素，彬彬有禮，始終保持着恰當的距離，既不讓人感覺疏遠，也不顯得過於熱絡。餐飲服務同樣出色，無論是早餐時的現磨咖啡，還是晚餐時的精緻茶點，都讓人忍不住贊歎。特別值得一提的是，他們提供的私人管家服務，回答了我們所有的疑問。

安吉涵田度假村，每天都能體驗到不同的驚喜和美滿。猶如茶葉在熱水中慢慢散開的過程，我的假期在這裏逐漸豐富，釋出生活中最精緻和寧靜的那一部分。這不僅是一個放鬆身心的地方，它更是一段難以忘懷的旅程，一個讓人心靈得以昇華的所在。

早餐不太行，如果想吃西式早點，沒什麼選擇；
風景尚可，但是温泉更衣間非常破，不如一般的洗浴中心。

環境：風景宜人，有山有水，還有茶園。和家人開玩笑説，涵田度假就當一次徒步爬山的旅行。住的是崖居，房屋建在半山腰。私密性極好，陽台遠眺是山，是茶，是綠色，是陽光。

衞生：設施挺新的，整體衞生還不錯。

設施：温泉小了那麼一點點，温泉的湯池還有花樣設施不是特別多。浴袍需要從房間裏拿。

餐點：早餐還可以，水榭居的其他餐點一般了。上菜時間較長，不過沒想到的是點餐後可以送到客房的這個服務，時間還挺快的。小朋友特別喜歡水榭居的魚兒們，餐廳也是依山傍水，比較雅緻。沒有預約到鐵板燒，可能門店比較小能容納的人員有限。

我住的是半山温泉雙床房，房間很大，大約55平方，新中式的設計也很舒適。更加驚喜的是，房間配備的吊頂音響系統，可以通過藍牙連接客人的手機，由此就可以把自己手機裏想放的音樂設成房間的背景音樂。這樣的設計，即便是國際奢牌的五星級酒店也沒太見過（其它五星級酒店也就是牀頭櫃，有一個台式音箱可以藍牙連手機）。
温泉泡池在半山腰，風景非常好而且大部分都有頂棚，即便下雨下雪也不影響，温泉區域還有桑拿的幹蒸房。温泉的更衣室雖然不大，但是設施齊全，管理也比較有序，會根據客流量做限流和導流。
中餐廳水榭居建在一個人工水庫旁邊，透過大的落地玻璃窗風景很好。中式為主的自助早餐非常豐富，除了瓦罐土雞湯，還有紅燒的走地雞或排骨，這些在大部分的五星級酒店自助早餐都不容易吃到。晚餐是點菜的，價格也不算貴，人均100多可以吃的比較舒服。
在這裏度假，可以體驗的活動也不少：體驗了酒店晚上的頌鈸療愈，非常放鬆；活動室裏還有乒乓球桌球桌以及遊戲機；也參觀了酒店旁邊的茶葉博物館。
酒店的服務也很貼心同時又不打攪，管家小艷提前一天就和我電話聯繫，加了微信以後，發給我關於酒店的基本訊息、地圖以及其它活動安排；在入住期間及時回覆我的問題，也會及時提醒我早餐時間，還包括可以體驗的活動，比如在早餐的地方可以領飼料來喂水庫裏的鯉魚和鴨子。
總之是很滿意的兩晚三天的體驗，春夏天肯定還會再來。

msg:服務滿分，出發前有管家小艷專門加微信對接，因為是帶家人出來過生日，還專門準備了一個大大的蛋糕，非常貼心。因為去的那幾天一直下雨，在度假村基本上通過小電車出行，跟管家説一下車很快就到了，比較方便。

房間寬敞明亮，環境舒適安靜，美中不足就是一直下雨，沒有爬茶山，春夏秋去的話應該會更好。

水榭居臨水而建，環境優美，早餐豐富，午餐晚餐也是在那邊吃的，菜量不大，但是考慮到在景區，價格還算合理，而且味道很好，贊贊贊

msg:趁着寒假帶娃自駕遊，第一天入住的是湖州其他親子酒店，第二天才來的涵田度假村。雖然是第一次來玩，但是兩家酒店對比很鮮明。無論是酒店環境，房間，服務等等涵田都做得更勝一籌！房間寬敞舒適，依山傍水，一家三口住綽綽有餘。餐飲方面，菜式品種和味道都不錯，早餐品種也非常豐富，可以感覺到涵田是用心在做的。服務方面，無論是酒店工作人員還是管家小艷都很細心耐心熱心，有問必答，退房臨走前台的小姐姐還貼心的給了我兩瓶水讓我們路上喝😊管家小艷的暖心問候，天氣雖然寒冷但是心裏很温暖！温泉的環境也很幽雅，晚上去的時候人也比較少，基本每個湯池都去泡了一下，孩子最喜歡的還是海洋球的湯池，玩的非常盡興～唯一美中不足的是更衣室比較侷促，人多的時候換衣服比較不方便。
對於我們經常帶娃出去自駕遊的家庭來説也住過不少酒店，涵田是我們下次還會選擇再來玩的酒店。

msg:提幾個建議
1不適合家庭度假，涵田現在都走團建路線，完全不顧及一下家庭客户的需求了吧，家庭房和雙床房預訂都是沒有的，盲猜都給團客了嗎？ 打聽了價格散客也是貴很多的，一家三口不得已定了榻榻米客房，那客房備一個簡易床墊應該增加不了多少成本吧，問問也是沒有，所以對於一家三口家庭應該不會來第二次了 。把家庭客户拒之門外了吧 
第二，服務專業性是沒有的，這是江浙酒店通病，好像都沒培訓過似的，蠻亂的
第三，那麼大一塊地皮造的酒店，全靠接駁車，毫無特色，真沒有什麼觀賞性，環境一般般 ，室內也一般般，什麼都一般般，拍不出什麼照片
第四，温泉進去換衣服的地方又窄又亂。。  還不如很多普通澡堂子的細節

尊享雙人温泉:有温泉池、石板浴、汗蒸房，週一晚上21：00去泡人不多。由於温泉22：00關，所以在21：50左右會有工作人員催促提醒她們要下班了。

環境：空氣不錯，房間外景觀也很好。度假村內有茶山，參觀博物館時可以看到。

設施：有KTV、室內休閑場所（桌球、電遊、乒乓球）、小童樂園、茶博館等

總結：散心好去處，就是酒店房間門隔音不好，早上會被其他住客講話聲音、拖行李聲音吵醒。

服務貼心，無論是餐廳 大堂 温泉 房間遇到的服務人員都挺熱心熱情的
餐廳美味，在餐廳吃了幾頓安吉本地菜，口味都不錯，價格也不貴，蝦籽冬筍很好吃，脆、鮮。早餐主要為中式早餐，品類也不少，一大長溜，哈密瓜和西瓜非常新鮮甜美！吃完早餐可以領取魚食餵魚餵鴨子和黑天鵝，很有趣。應該也很適合帶寶寶來
温泉也很舒服，一定要泡，環境是在山裡，本身就像個景點。

建議
浴室毛巾有一小點點不太乾淨
隔音不太好，總有樓上聲音
晚上去温泉的山路好黑

環境：在茶博園的半山腰，酒店本身就是一道風景，週末帶娃登高呼吸下新鮮空氣非常愜意；
服務：可以説是江浙滬這個價位的天花板，此處需要表揚下管家小趙，有求必應，由於此次入住正值娃的生日，不僅提供了客房佈置還驚喜準備了小蛋糕。

總結：三天兩晚，意猶未盡，下次有機會再來。

想動？可以徒步茶園，想靜？可以參加一堂頌缽療愈課，在頌缽發出的嗡嗡聲中昏昏睡去～

喝了那麼多年的茶不到茶博物館還真不知道茶始於蜀再東移，唐煮宋點碾末飲法到明朝才變成用沸水沖泡葉茶、印象中的“昏君”宋徽宗居然是茶專家… 在竹林環繞 茶葉飄香的環境裏 編個髮髻穿個古裝 似乎這樣的裝扮才不違和～晚上也閑不着，有七個温泉池子等着一個個泡過去呢

就連退房後也能去山頂的書吧裏翻翻書 驚喜地發現了不少好書 讓我對涵田度假村的好感又增加了十分！

特別推薦漢服攝影師小鄒和化粧楊老師 專業又耐心！還有在泡温泉時遇到的姜芳老師 對客户熱情周到的服務 總之 超過預期

msg:總體體驗還是很好的，酒店很美環境什麼都很乾凈，周邊景色也十分美。酒店還提供了户外温泉，晚上去泡泡湯十分舒服。唯一美中不足的是餐廳水榭居，菜品價格都偏高很貴，而且每道菜的量很多，比較適合全家六到八人的那種量，而我們本次出行是三口之家兩大一小，這就導致我們不敢多點，但每次要硬着頭皮把已點的兩三個菜吃掉，不然就會浪費。建議餐廳可以降低菜的價格，同時量要考慮到三口家庭的量。舉個例子，有次吃晚飯我們明明點了一份牛排，價格是68元，結果確上了一份沒有切的牛仔骨。這個還是有些失望的，牛排和牛仔骨我們還是吃的出區別的。

餐廳午晚餐零點，口味適中，價格不貴，服務好，完全不用擔心踩坑！
酒店就是小景區，小橋流水人家，大鯉魚黑天鵝鴨子熙熙攘攘，孩子很喜歡。

酒店面積很大，建在茶山裡，山上還有竹林，環境很好，各種娛樂設施一應俱全，包括温泉，私人影院，KTV，乒乓球等。停車場內有充電樁。

我們這次預訂的雲舍尊享雙床房和半山雙床房，半山房在主樓，雲舍房在山上，需要坐酒店內的接駁車，車很多，我們幾次下山時都有車在山上等，如果沒車也可以和管家聯繫叫車，響應也很快，但是想更方便些還是建議預訂同一個區域的房間。

我們在酒店吃了晚餐和早餐，中餐廳的晚餐正常水平，早餐很豐富，味道很好，而且在入住率很高的情況下也不擁擠。

總體來説，安吉涵田是一個休閑度假的好選擇，推薦！

首先度假村裡麪環境很好，有竹林，有茶山，有湖泊，接駁車隨叫隨到，山腳下半山腰山頂上都有不同的去處！

入住後的一個下午泡了免費温泉，喝了山頂咖啡，參觀了茶博館，晚上還體驗了頌缽音療，總之就是被各種項目安排得滿滿當當！

預訂好之後就有管家加我微信，各種問題各種預約就找管家，幾乎都是秒回，退房又送我兩杯咖啡路上喝。

淡季這個價格享受這樣的服務和配套，幾乎感覺自己沒花錢還賺了！強烈推薦雲頂咖啡的冰拿鐵和半山腰的樸界西餐廳！另外感謝我的管家小艷，絕對是經理級別的接待！

第一次在攜程寫小作文，送給安吉涵田度假村！明年再約！！

msg:安吉《涵田》是我們一家人都很願意去的度假點，之前去過3、4回，感覺一是交通方便，高速安吉北出口下來沒多遠就到了；二是有山有水、有崖有谷，茶樹遍佈，怡人宜居；三是露天温泉泡池是一大特色，依山而建、翠竹陪伴，浸泡其中絕對是一種享受😎；四是餐食好吃，就餐環境好，水榭中餐廳令人難忘。
        這不，這個週末又邀約了3家人（訂了4間崖居房）一同前往，大家都對此地讚賞有加：午餐訂了水榭的包間，房間很大、裝修別緻，帶有一個大大的水上露台，欣賞湖光山色之餘，可以投喂黑天鵝，鴨子、錦鯉等小動物；晚餐安排了鐵板燒，菜品極為豐富，現場氣氛也很好，廚師還特意為我們營造了巨大的火焰供拍攝，很出彩[強]；居住的房間寬敞明亮，台階式的佈局製造了層次感，不用下床便可以遠眺山巒、近觀峽谷，移步陽台則有更大的篇幅收入視野，綠意盎然、清新逼人；此外，温泉泡湯、萌寵樂園、室內遊樂園等等都給大家留下了美好的印象……
        值得一提的是，《涵田》的服務總體令人稱道（但擺渡車司機隊伍這塊仍要加強），讓在這裏的時光温馨而愉悦，尤其是水榭中餐廳包間的服務，真是好！[強][強][強]
        希望《涵田》能保持茶園古樸、山青水秀的風貌，不要過度開發及商業化（這次感覺進山的路邊多了很多新建築物），用原生態的品質和過硬的服務來贏得客户的認可[微笑]

衞生：不錯！每天打掃得很及時～
環境：空氣好，周邊環境優美～
服務：很好，有求必應！員工素質都很高！接駁車的司機反應也很迅速，送接都很快，還幫忙拿行李！管家小姐姐也非常貼心，退房走的時候還送了兩杯咖啡帶在路上喝～
酒店提供很多體驗活動，都是免費的，頌缽療愈體驗也很有特色！其他的比如温泉也不錯！温泉的女賓部的阿姨人很好，泡完之後還給我泳衣進行了甩幹！人很熱心！
唯一差評的體驗是那個白茶博物館，去的時候樓上連一個接待的員工都沒有，裏面銷售櫃枱的的工作人員也很冷漠，我們逛了十幾分鍾全程沒有任何人來講解或者接待，直接坐車回去了！

總體推薦這家酒店，很適合度假哦～

msg:今年生了寶寶後一直宅家裡帶娃，心情略壓抑，於是決定錯峯短途遊。因為要帶小baby，所以做了一番攻略後選擇了安吉。安吉涵田度假村是攜程上搜的評分靠前的，前兩年工作原因住過溧陽涵田，當時對涵田品牌印象不錯，所以這次最終也決定住涵田。我們一行是三大一小，訂了1間半山至尊大床和1間半山高級大床。總體感受如下：
房間設施：房間設施齊全，整體空間寬敞，衞生乾淨，兩個房型視野都不錯，一打開窗簾我家寶寶看到外面的景色就開心的不行，要説缺點的話就是可能開業時間久了，茶水台的櫃門有點老舊關不緊。
服務方面：入住前一晚會有管家來添加微信，告知入住相關事宜，入住期間有事也可隨時聯繫管家，服務態度很好，響應客人的需求也很快。
酒店配套設施方面：入住後每晚是可享受酒店的温泉的，我因為特殊原因沒去體驗，但路過時看前往的人還挺多；入住時還會送白茶博物館的門票。
用餐方面：每晚入住都是包含次日早晨的早餐的，在水榭居中餐廳，種類較齊全；因為小孩才7個月外出不方便，所以我們2天的中餐晚餐都是水榭居吃的，菜品味道比較清淡，但也合喂口，我們三個大人每次我們都3菜一湯，價格的話200-300能吃的不錯了。
總體來説酒店還是值得來住的，帶長者和小孩泡泡酒店挺合適。

設施：基礎設施還不錯，該有的都有。崖居房間的落地窗很喜歡，衞生間和浴室都很乾凈，床很舒服。

環境：環境很nice，訂的崖居，辦理入住後會有人開車帶到住處。很幽靜，風吹樹林、鳥語、蟬鳴，沒別的聲兒了。日落前泡壺茶坐在亭子裏看遠處茶園很愜意。

服務：全程的服務都很滿意。入住前一天會有管家打電話來，然後加微信。入住期間詢問、叫車基本都是秒回。餐廳、温泉的服務人員也都很熱情。

尊享雙人温泉:一共七個温泉池+汗蒸房+幹蒸房。睡前去泡個温泉、汗蒸一下，睡得很舒服。

全日餐廳衹有一個水榭居，不出去的話我們基本一日三餐都在那裡吃，餐廳菜品出色但是衞生狀況還是有待加強，洗乾淨的筷子拿在手裡當遊戲棒，來回揉搓，還有很多無法言語的動作……本來還想這麼好的景色喝會咖啡，實在是看不下去了
管家君君服務好，小姑娘人美心善一個人幫我拿了好多行李，晚班的小哥哥服務到位給小朋友送來了熱牛奶！
度假村夏季滿山的竹林帶來清涼的確值得入住！

房間各方面都不錯，就是隔音太差，走廊上的聲音、樓上樓下的聲音太影響睡眠，這方面可以考慮住山上的獨棟房間，環境更幽靜，就是出行不方便，高峯時候接駁車還是要等一會的。
服務方面參差不齊。入住的時候沒有人幫忙拿行李，也不提供行李推車，進入大廳的路衹有台階。但有些服務人員的態度很好，很貼心，會主動熱情的提供服務。管家的服務很到位，基本上有任何需求能立馬響應，給出門在外的住客很大的生活保障。

小朋友當天體驗了温泉，連續三天光顧山頂泳池。每天坐電瓶車上下山也是一種樂趣。
要特別誇一下中餐廳，也就是吃早餐的地方，我們其中兩天中餐和晚餐也都在水榭居解決，品質得到了全家的認可。吃完早餐，小朋友還可以免費餵魚和天鵝，飯店提供的餌料。
我們住的涯居房，是最有特色，景色也很棒。房間設施智能，夠大。還有個大浴缸，小朋友遊玩泳，回來就能泡個熱水澡。
有機會還會再來的！

酒店服務人員態度都很好，走廊遇到都會打招呼。
白茶很好喝，也買了幾包帶走，不過跟網購價格差不多，不是很划算，如果以後住店客人可以多優惠點就好了。
不是挑剔的客人，所以感覺酒店的衞生還可以。
温泉每天下午2點開始，去泡温泉，也很方便拿乾淨浴袍換。
山頂泳池如果能做成無邊泳池就好了，現在這樣，感覺顏值不夠。
總的來説，玩的還是很開心的，吃的也比較喜歡。
孩子長者都對本次出遊表示滿意。

整體服務態度很好，酒店內設施也足夠多，可以住個兩三天也不會無聊。

中餐廳很好吃，價格也能接受。

度假村內如果不想走的話，可以叫車接送，因為帶着腿腳不方便的長者，所以就方便

臨行時還送上了伴手禮，很貼心。

有待改進：
此次選擇的是半山榻榻米，是由大堂後門進入的。走進去的通道黴味很重，地毯也很臟，這點體驗很不好。建議提早定其他房型。

可能正值旅遊高峯，酒店有很多實習生，業務正在熟悉中，有時候的回答讓人有些啼笑皆非。

但瑕不掩瑜，下次有機會還會再來。

對於安吉的印象一直都在幾年前的漂流，這次來選了安吉涵田，覺得非常不錯哦，有可能是我很久沒有出來看山山水水了，一進房間感覺還是非常好的，視野非常棒！

服務：非常棒！耐心且用心！非常細緻，從進大門有人迎接到你退房走的時候給你送上咖啡！

設施：酒店看起來挺不錯的，除了衞生間的淋浴水有點小以外都很不錯！

這邊有泳池和温泉，想放鬆自己的心情可以來呆兩天！特別適合雨季來，自己坐在床邊看看窗外淅淅瀝瀝的雨飄下來，喝一杯冰美式，真的是一種格外的享受！

      剛訂好酒店不久，會有酒店管家打電話過來，要求加微信。原本以為會有些許騷擾，但後來證明完全沒有這樣的感覺，有禮有節讓人很舒適。

      酒店房間也會讓人有眼前一亮的感覺，偏中式，但佈置的很温馨。最喜歡房間外有一個大露台，周圍是小片竹林，對面是一座山，可能我們去的時節不錯，人不多，沒有喧鬧聲，特別安靜。房間裏還有藍牙，可以直接連上手機放音樂，音響效果還不錯。
 
     辦理入住時問了下加份小孩的温泉門票多少費用時，酒店特別大方直接送了一份。温泉池子不算多，但勝在人少，玩得不亦樂乎。

      第二天的自助早餐也不錯，吃完還能領一份魚食，喂旁邊的錦鯉和鴨子。鴨子們為了食物一個個都練成了“凌波微步”，真是可愛的不行。
  
      可能唯一的缺點就是附近沒有什麼商店，出去吃得開車十幾公里。雖然衹住了一晚，但感受頗深，以後來安吉還是可以選擇這裏。

再從服務看，服務非常好，態度很好，能力也很強，熱心地幫忙解決問題。家裡小朋友晚上有些發燒，酒店經理和師傅大晚上跑了眾多葯房幫忙買到了小兒退燒葯。真真切切地讓人感受到了温暖與貼心。

餐飲，我們衹吃了水榭居。鐵板燒要提早訂，比較特悶，容易滿座。八大碗，就是八個煲，不能自己點菜的，晚上8點才開始，而且這八個煲，有些水榭裏也有。水榭的話、我覺得本地菜口味一般，反而是川菜，沸騰魚片，粵菜咕咾肉都很不錯。早飯也是在水榭吃，早餐自助式的，內容還算豐富。水榭是從早上7點開到晚上9點。

房間，我們定的是崖居，風景還不錯，沒有遮擋。就是山裡容易有蟲，要小心不要陽台門。就是覺得浴室和衞生間設計的有點怪。也可能是我選的房型不對，浴室衞生間分離的，但是開放式的。我覺得最好把浴室衞生間和房間做個隔斷，這樣比較適合。

msg:在位於九龍山宋茗茶博園內的安吉涵田度假村住上兩晚度個小假，坐擁近2000 畝茶園，內斂淡雅的建築隱逸於竹山林海之間，度幾日與山水共眠共清歡的生活。全程管家小艷的服務很好，整個度假村上上下下各部門的服務意識都超強，相當的訓練有素👍充分體現了服務至上。水榭居的自助早餐品種多元化，如果能開放户外長廊用餐就更完美了。半山竹林中的竹韻温泉環境宜人，7個温泉池雖不算多，但衹對住客開放，保證了安靜清幽和私密。茶山環抱中的避世之旅，2024的第一場温泉♨️羣山點翠，御水生煙，竹林深處滌盪身心，盡享山水自然，讓一切思緒歸零。泡着温泉看風景，舒坦愜意。退房後還贈送每人一杯咖啡，帶着上路。總之，在這裏度假絕對是身心愉悦，同伴們都讚不絕口哈。

由於是給家人過生日，提前告知了苗苗，當日入住的時候有幫忙佈置了房間，還很細心的準備了生日蛋糕🎂第一印象好感拉滿。
酒店環境✔是個坐落於青山裡的避世好地兒。整個兒被茶林和竹林包圍，加上日式格調的裝修，彷彿整個人置身於山裡，把遠離大城市的舒適感放大的剛剛好。落地玻璃窗加分，環境融入感被加強。
而且酒店有露天温泉，美美的泡個澡加上深度睡眠，疲勞感全都被拿掉啦。
綜合，是想一直去住的酒店☺️

msg:房間很大，管家小艷提前一天與我聯繫，並且把要入住的相關事宜提前告訴我，很貼心啊，把我們的車牌也提前錄入系統，我們到達大門後直接就能進入啦，超方便，整個酒店給人的體驗感很好啊，酒店裡負責接送的觀光車也很給力，去哪都有車子接送，我家這次去有老有小大家都覺得服務好贊；晚上泡温泉，因為不熟悉就沒有把浴巾帶上，我媽媽想要回更衣室取，但是温泉區的阿姨看到後急忙説幫我們去取，還知道我們是4個人直接給拿了4條浴巾，並且看到我們有小朋友就主動教我們怎麼給小朋友圍浴巾，太棒了。酒店的中餐味道也非常好哦，菜品不踩雷，早餐也很豐富！入住期間管家小艷實時會提醒我們用餐時間、泡温泉時間，還在我們退房時給準備好了咖啡，感謝。雖然我們衹住了一晚，但是小朋友好開心還嚷着不想回家。下次一定還要再來！
衞生：非常好
設施：非常好
環境：非常好，非常適合親子
服務：非常好

缺點：1 設施有點舊，牆紙地毯都有點舊有點臟。2 泡池不是天然温泉。3 早餐一般，種類品質和酒店定位不太相符。
總體的感覺還不錯的，沒有趕在節假日來，價格也還可以吧。再貴就覺得有點不合適。

就是天氣太炎熱了，所以每天都窩在酒店，倒也覺得挺充實的，管家小艷每天早上都會告訴我們可以去前台領取魚食，讓娃也每天牽掛有事可做。酒店旁也有徒步路線，帶着娃衹走了一半，如果在涼快些走走還是不錯的。
剛入住也就十分幸運的還抽到了山頂雙人下午茶套餐，在空調間裏泡着真是這個天最舒服的活動了。
晚上去泡温泉，小童池有海洋球也給娃增添了泡湯樂趣，感覺泳池也在定期消毒，整體還是乾淨的。
水榭居的餐飲也很合口味，臨河用餐的感覺也很舒服。

msg:非常滿意的一次出遊住宿體驗，此外以下發生的事件，特別想要反饋及表達感謝

我與家人一行四人下午抵達度假村，行李放定後即出門空拍。結果空拍機在大門前半山腰撞上巖石，摔落石縫中。當時，立即與前台萬虎經理反映。很快的，萬經理請來了工程部羅順全先生，依據我的陳述，上山找飛機。經過了好一陣子的折騰，終於發現了飛機的蹤影。但當時天色已黯淡下來，飛機掉落處單人無法觸及。本已預做放棄的心理準備，卻見羅先生回單位拿梯子；萬經理也隨羅先生一起上山取飛機。最後，空拍機終在兩位先生鍥而不捨的努力下重回我手中。

除了當場向兩位先生致謝外。我更想藉此，讚美 貴
度假村以客為尊的員工教育訓練做的非常紮實。希望我的案例能成為貴公司優良案例之一，對萬虎經理與羅順全先生以適當的表揚與獎勵。

msg:這家酒店是入住前1天才定的，主要是出發前本來對安吉之旅非常期待，但是越看評論越心涼，每家價格不菲的酒店都有各種差評，還竟是讓我接受不了的衞生、服務等等問題，所以糾結了很久才定了它。這酒店還真是沒有什麼坑和槽點哈哈，可以放心住。
【位置】在一個茶文化園裡，也是山裡，比較安靜愜意，尤其我們定的房間在山頂，基本上去哪兒都需要擺渡車，不過擺渡車很好叫，打6000或者跟管家説，都很快就到。如果點外賣好像不現實，不過酒店裡吃的就還不錯。
【管家服務】管家苗苗人美心善，從入住之前就加了微信，給我們發一些開放時間的提示和都有什麼遊玩內容，方便提前安排好行程，我們2大2小，3個人都想漢服體驗，還幫我們協調了3張體驗券。早餐後還提示我們前台可以領餵魚和天鵝的魚食，又多了一個歡樂的體驗。
【住】房間很大，2張雙人床但是並不是特別寬，如果2個大人睡一張還是略微有點擠的，衞生間和房間都是落地窗，榻榻米上是茶几和蒲團，在上面玩耍，喝茶，看風景，很是舒服。房間插頭都比較靠下，如果做熱水最好離孩子遠點或者用衞生間的插頭。樓下就是咖啡廳，聞起來很香，裝修風格也喜歡。
【温泉】來這個酒店主要是看上了温泉，5月出遊想玩水很尷尬，泳池基本都沒開，漂流又有點冷，所以有温泉還真是棒棒噠。都是室外獨立泡池，人很少，有浴巾，有一個小水吧能點些零食，還有免費的紅糖薑茶和熱水，還是很愜意的。孩子從4點一直泡到了8點多才走，中間讓爸爸去中餐廳外帶了衹烤鴨回來，好香。
【其他】吃了酒店自助早餐和前一晚中餐廳的烤鴨，都還不錯，能吃飽食材也挺新鮮的。大堂旁邊有個帳篷露營區，我們沒時間去了，不過路過看到覺得挺好的。黑天鵝有個小寶寶，真的是醜小鴨的既視感，好醜哈哈，它們和魚都很喜歡魚食，吃的超瘋狂。
【意外收穫】酒店送的漢服體驗券，可以免費換上漢服自己去拍照，不過我們還是讓這兒的專業攝影師拍了，果然沒錯，30一張的價格也完全可以接受，孩子還挺有古時候的韻味，有點意思哈哈。

更值得加分的地方是服務簡直就是7星級，我家小孩有點咳嗽，管家馬上幫忙去買了葯，第二天還幫忙修了雪梨蘿蔔水止咳，小孩走的時候咳嗽基本都好了！
推薦理由：
1.酒店每晚都有誦缽，免費體驗，特別放鬆神經
2.小孩子有專門的遊樂設施
3.温湯無限次進出，湯池據説有二十多個
4.免費漢服體驗，幾十款衣服隨意挑選
5服務真的特別好，使命必達
6酒店機器人送東西到各個房間，順便把小孩哄了，我們家小孩每天都要求機器人來房間送水，特別好玩。
當然最重要的是這家酒店的風景特別大氣，逛的特別舒服，心情非常放鬆，所以續住了好幾晚

msg:設施：酒店開了有些年數了，有些設施不是很好了。地板之間裂縫有點大，洗手間的移門也有點老化。
環境：環境有山有樹，綠氧肯定沒話説非常棒的，就是生態環境太好了，房間裏會有臭蟲的，害怕的人可能會介意，當然你也可以致電前台告知，會讓清潔阿姨來抓。
服務：服務不錯的，入住期間在設施方面也遇到了一些問題，但好在管家和經理處理的非常及時，非常關注，這個要點個贊。
