Highlight was the bath. The aircon did not work properly and was a very uncomfortable stay with it being too hot in the room. 
Don't think we would stay again.

Only annoying part is that you cannot take the towels from the swimming pool to the rooms. They make a big fuss about it and basically run after you.

msg:Surprisingly, this very affordable hotel can complete my trip. With very affordable price, this hotel has such a high price to value ratio. 
Its location is golden, right in the center of cbd. It has a very complet gym and big indoor swimminh pool.

Another plus of this hotel is its club rooms.  They are located in higher floor so that  they will have greater view compare to the other. The club rooms also allow me to check out at 4 PM (as long as condition permitted)

I can not give it 5 score because many of its employees can not speak chinese. Only a few in front office can speal basic english. This hotel really need to step up its game since i saw many international visitors during my stay. This hotel also need to educate its laundry man. He need to know the politeness standard when he want to access international visitor room. I know he means well but the way he behave make me feel uncomfortable becaise i feel he is very weird.

msg:Disaster stay!! I’ve been living and working in China for over 10 years, have stayed at this hotel multiple times and have had great stays. This time however was a complete disaster from start to now (I’m still here and am dreading the next few nights). Check in was fairly smooth and I was informed I had received a room upgrade; unfortunately, the room I was ‘upgraded’ to was facing south west, with a view of 3 huge buildings which resulted in the room being incredibly dark due to most sunlight being blocked. In addition to this, the room was absolutely filthy. There were dried on white water marks over every bathroom surface, the shower and bathroom window were smeared with stains, there were uncleared splashes over the bathroom walls, rim stains from cups, collections of dust in every corner, stains on the carpet. It was disgusting, an absolute disgrace in fact. We didn’t notice this initially as we went straight out after check in but when we did it made our skin crawl. I asked for it to be cleaned thoroughly and sone of it was done but the carpet stains and window smears remained. Breakfast was an underwhelming, unfriendly affair, with there being no apparent serving staff and station servers trying to give you cold, waiting food rather than cooking it fresh (both the noodle station and the egg station did this).The pool is nice to look at, very cold but looks nice. Again it was an unfriendly affair. The pool attendant was a stiff, grim faced man who clearly wasn’t happy with children playing with parents in the pool (shaking his head when we laughed or splashed, standing far too close to us, following us around the pool (even though there were only 1-2 other guests present who weren’t phased by us). The most ridiculous situation however came when it wad time to change and leave the pool. I entered the female changing room with my 2 young children (boys), to quickly and quietly change. Half way through changing the custodian cleaning was incredibly rude and told my kids to leave as ‘no men were allowed’. When I asked where they should go (we were all in a state of undress at this point)- she opened the door and indicated that they should wait half clothed on the hallway alone or should go to the male changing rooms unattended (my son is 5 years old). The harassment continued  when a guest tried to translate which led to my children feeling incredibly embarrassed and again further when leaving the changing room, the grim pool attendant and another unknown male began shouting at me, from the pool side, scaring my young children. The 2 men felt it appropriate to now indicate my children were ‘too old’. The hotels absolutely ridiculous policy could have been told to me when entering the pool to avoid all this distress. I’m interested in hearing the hotels response and plan on how they equitably support single parent travelers with young children in the presence of such ridiculous swimming pool legislations. What are my options here? Get my children naked and changed at the pool side (how is this less ‘offensive’ than taking them into the changing room?). Walk them soaking wet through the cold air conditioned  hotel to get sick and changed back to the room? Send them alone and unaccompanied onto a male changing room with strangers aged 5 - a massive child safeguarding issue!!). Regardless, male and female staff shouting at me, pointing fingers at my children and seeking to shame them is absolutely unacceptable. They are innocent children and should not be subjected  to such ludicrous treatment due to incompressible adult prejudices. The staff should be absolutely ashamed of themselves!! Needless to say, I’m completely underwhelmed at the prospect of another 2 nights here!

msg:The hotel is located right within prime CBD in Beijing, barely 3 mins walk away from FFC and WFC where many top MNCs are located, so it's definitely ideal for the business traveller. It's also linked to the Fortune Mall at Level 2 so you can avoid exposure to the weather if you wish to get a quick meal or shop there. The breakfast option is great if you have it included as default, but don't think it's worth the additional top-up of ~200 RMB for 2. 

Can tell it's a slightly dated hotel through its public and room amenities like analog temperature control - you actually need to insert your card into a slot to activate the lift buttons, which is a hassle compared to the tap or swiping in most modern hotels nowadays. Its top notch service and quality of room cleaning makes up for it though.

A staff of lobby bar even showed her bad temper over a subtle dispute that could be easily solved. We plan to organize a big group of over 100 room nights in this area and this staying experience apparently gives me the answer that Mellennium is the last choice. Last but not least, the hygene condition of room, as shown in the photo, is bad in some particular points, that their management never noticed. I will not rate you too low because overall is acceptible, but we are not satisfied as being served in a three-star hotel paying a five star rate.

Reservation&FD: no any specific setup and arrangements even though I have written down one day before that my parents and kids will stay. (So why I need to pay time to show my requirements ?)

HSKP:  The hotel has been informed in advance that we’re all allergic to dust and mites. Obviously we stayed with dust for a whole night.

FD: it’s so strange that I checked in the room and finished all the process, took the room key. For the next day, I forgot my room number and left the key in my room. I took my ID card to FD and just required a new key, but I was told I was not registered. After I insisted it more than 3 times. This hotel still need to call my families to confirm it?????

Please go to check PSB system or opera records to prevent this complicated situation. Do not make the easy to be difficult.

Please be a real luxury 5 stars hotel in the future.

We wanted a hotel that has a lap swimming, a gym with good variety of gym equipments, close to subway stations so we could easily get around the city if we needed to; however, for the most parts we took "DiDi." Room and bed were comfortable, strong shower, no shortage of bottle water on the house. Great all-you-can-eat dim sum restaurant inside hotel. We'll return to this hotel in the future.

The indoor pool is well maintained and heated, and there’s also a jacuzzi, so it’s a perfect place to relax especially if you have kids who love swimming. 

The breakfast was disappointing, after reading so many good reviews. Maybe due to COVID they didn’t offer such a large selection of food. 

The room is spacious but showing some signs of age, but nothing to deter from a good stay.

While visiting the swimming pool on Saturday afternoon I realized the hot water pool was a little dirty. We still had a swim though. On Sunday morning we headed to the same pool and this time around it was real dirty. I saw dirty foam on the water with brown things drifting on the water( I can only imagine what that is) we immediately got out of the water and rushed to the room to shower and clean off. My two year old daughter was in the pool as well. This is very unhygienic and unacceptable.

From the arrival check in - the polite staff gave me a quiet room far-away from the elevator banks - through to the excellent breakfast and other amenities. Special mention should be reserved for the Club Floor and Executive Club. The facilities and service was fabulous. The two Club Managers - Joy JING and Lisa LIU were amazing hostesses. We managed to hold important client meetings and interviews in the Club and our guests felt very well looked after. Another boon is the hotel’s connected Restaurant L’Ox where Ray and his Team will look after you specially. Fabulous experience! Thank you.

However, I suffered from stomach trouble both days after breakfast. I suspect it was the coffee. The machine might need cleaning or the hotel might consider changing the supplier of coffee beans.

During the check in process the counter staff was a trainee and had difficulty with handling the booking system. Her English wasn’t the best and she wasn’t used to serving a foreigner. I tried upgrading my original room but due to language barrier it was difficult. After paying the upgrade amount she ended up giving me the original room. While it’s a non-smoking hotel, this was fully ignored as was evident by the guests in next door room. After being moved to the upgraded room it was all sorted. My only other complaint would be the TV was very outdated as I couldn’t connect my laptop using an HDMI cable. I asked the concierge for an adapter but no luck. This item should be improved by the hotel given its 2021.

Service, the front desk receptionist was very impatient with my cancellation of the order, the male waiter in the western restaurant had a bad attitude, the dishes were super deceptive, and the dishes were falsely advertised😓
Facilities, the elevator card had to be swiped more than ten times, and the western restaurant didn't even have a white tablecloth😓

The bathtub does not have a disposable cover, and the bathtub was required to be disinfected but it was not disinfected! The hygiene quality is worrying. There is no trash can in the toilet! It is very inconvenient. There was no water the next day. We had to call and ask for it to be delivered. We asked in advance and learned that we should check out at 2 o'clock, but they urged us to check out before 2 o'clock! The attitude is very bad. In such a prosperous place like Guomao where high-end hotels gather, do you only serve foreigners? When you see foreign friends, you are very respectful, but when we ask, your attitude and service are bad! If this is the case, then you can put up a sign saying that you only serve foreigners! Rubbish hotel!

Although it is located in the Guomao business district, it is quiet in the bustling city, the rooms are comfortable, and the various services are very humane and not fancy, especially the software services are really heartwarming. The room attendants solve every request quickly, and also give warm reminders when checking in. There is a Ms. Rosy at the front desk who specially guided me on how to book a room and check in faster, which reflects the professionalism of a five-star hotel.

msg:Overall, it is old and not suitable for family travel. It was a mistake to book a hotel!
1. The facilities are old and there are many damages. Like the swimming pool, the railings for launching the water (the only way to launch the water) are directly rusted and broken. A reminder notice was posted, but there are no safety protection measures.
2. The service is like an old woman holding a pipe, unfriendly in various ways, no toothbrushes for children, no slippers for children. Check-out is slow, invoicing is slow, and everything is slow.
3. The breakfast is like a simple meal, not delicious, with few varieties, and does not meet the five-star standard. (A five-star hotel breakfast of 138 yuan, just think about it) The waiter at the entrance of the restaurant has a sharp eye. My child is 122cm and needs to pay half price. OK. Adult breakfast is 138 yuan and children's breakfast is 113 yuan, which is unreasonable.

Relatively speaking, only the sanitary conditions are excellent. I accidentally touched the back of the bedside table, which was also clean and dust-free.

The lady at the front desk who looked like a supervisor was so nice. My children didn't want to leave after staying in this hotel. The Millennium Hotel was the most pleasant surprise during the three-day trip to Beijing. It was less than 900 yuan for a view room like this on Holiday Inn. It was so worth it. For this hotel, I still want to go to Beijing during the May Day holiday. I don't even want to go to Disneyland.

And this season is particularly hot and humid, the indoor temperature can reach 27 or 28 degrees or even higher in the middle of the night, room temperature! With this room temperature and the dryness in Beijing, there is basically no need to sleep. Ask the hotel, you can only open the window. If you open the window and the room is facing the Third Ring Road, then congratulations and you will get a noise!
In short, if you want to choose a hotel near the China World Trade Center, the Kerry will be better at the same price of just over 1,000 yuan. If the travel budget is high, you should stay at the Rosewood or leave the China World Trade Center business district to find a new hotel!

The water doesn't stop until three o'clock in the middle of the night. If you're celebrating Chinese New Year, experience the horror! The hotel negotiated and said, why didn't you ask for a room change in the middle of the night? I want to ask, who's family stayed until midnight to change rooms! Is such a horrible room the facilities of a five-star hotel? This is Great Beijing, so those who come from out of town to live there have to be a little bit aggrieved.

    There was hair on the nozzle, and the faucet in the bathroom was so sci-fi that I couldn't unscrew it with my bare hands. Later I learned from experience: I wrapped it in a towel before I could unscrew it.
     The breakfast room is similar to most restaurants of this level, no surprises.

msg:Kevin at the front desk was very nice and made my stay a pleasant one. Millennium Hotel Beijing - A great stay!
I recently had a fantastic stay at the Millennium Hotel Beijing and I must say I was very impressed with the hotel.
First of all, the hotel's location is very good. It is located in the city center and is surrounded by many restaurants, shopping malls and tourist attractions, making travel and shopping very convenient.
Entering the hotel, the lobby is very grand, the front desk staff are warm and friendly, and the service is attentive, making people feel particularly comfortable.
My room is very spacious and bright, with exquisite and elegant decoration. The bed was comfortable and soft, allowing me to sleep peacefully every night. The facilities in the room are all available, and free wireless internet is provided, allowing me to stay connected with the outside world at any time.
I was also impressed with the hotel's food and beverage service. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner, the hotel's restaurant provides a wide variety of food choices with excellent taste, which made me satisfied.
Finally, I would like to give a special mention to the hotel's gym and swimming pool. I don't forget to maintain the habit of exercising while traveling, and the hotel's fitness facilities are very complete, allowing me to exercise easily.
All in all, I am very satisfied with my stay at Millennium Hotel Beijing. I highly recommend this hotel to all my friends who are going to Beijing. I believe you will fall in love with this hotel as much as I do!

msg:There is a reason this store has a low rating. In the room on the first night, water leaked from behind the bathtub faucet and when I opened it, my clothes got wet. The biggest problem is that when I stay in a hotel for the first time, I will be woken up by the smell of sewage in the middle of the night. I endured until dawn and called to ask for a room change. During this period, the service staff came to the door and I asked casually. I learned that there were two room types that often had bad odors and were asked to change rooms. In other words, the business owner refused to repair and improve the conditions even though he knew the smell in the room was so bad that it would affect his sleep. He also pretended to sell the smelly room to customers. I really don’t know how he got this five-star rating. His attitude when calling the switchboard was also very bad. Sorry, I knew the room smelled bad so I could change it for you. I didn’t apologize for the fact that I spent more than 1,000 yuan on the first night and was woken up by the smell and had a child with me, which seriously affected my sleep and endangered my health. So everyone should pay attention to avoid pitfalls. If you must stay, be sure to avoid rooms ending in 18.

The security guard told people not to leave the car, and when they went to the toilet, the security personnel informed them through the intercom: Watching people wearing white clothes while going to the toilet, I think it’s a bit much!

It is next to CCTV, in the heart of the Guomao Business District, and right at the subway entrance. It looks very impressive just from the appearance. But there is basically no service at all from the moment you walk in. The hardware inside the room is seriously aging, the TV is small and there are snowflakes, the sliding door is broken, the shower head does not work, the night light is flickering, and the overall hygiene also has a lot of room for improvement. I feel that there are also problems with the internal management of this hotel. When I went out, I heard the staff cleaning the guest rooms cheering themselves up while working, "It's a day to be happy, and a day to be unhappy." How can such an angry employee serve customers well? I regret being cheap (after all, the price is not in the thousands), why not add 200 to stay at Marriott.

msg:The rooms are very clean, but the last room in the corridor on the lower floor is terrible. On the first night I stayed on the 8th floor, which was the last room in the corridor. I was suddenly woken up by a huge roaring sound at 2 o'clock in the middle of the night. When I struggled to fall asleep, ** *****, my phone suddenly played music by itself, I almost died of fright. What’s even weirder is that the music is played by a video clipping app (I haven’t opened this app in more than a year). At 3 o'clock, the noise became louder and louder, so I had to call the guest room and the front desk for help. The housekeeping depar**ent said that the engineering depar**ent would come to check. . . Let the engineering depar**ent check where the noise is coming from? After half an hour of tossing, no one showed up. The next day I received a call asking for compensation. There was no compensation, not even a plate of fruit. After I pressed for it many times, I was moved to a room with a higher floor in the afternoon. The room was located in the middle of the corridor, and it was also the same day. It was windy, but there was no wind noise at night, and I had a good sleep the second night. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk, Daisy, was very nice. She was given access to the executive lounge. However, I was busy traveling outside during the day, so I didn't use it much. The service in the executive lounge was very good, but the breakfast didn't have much content. It was just a few kinds. One less person. Also, the room card is very insensitive and it is very difficult to use the elevator.

Not only did she patiently introduce the surrounding facilities of the hotel when I checked in, but she also took the initiative to ask me how my stay was every day during my stay. Next time I come to Beijing, I will choose Millennium!

msg:The feeling of the hotel is not satisfactory to me. The overall feeling is like a slightly better business hotel.

When checking in, the front desk would rather have two people deal with the issues left over from the previous order. Instead of taking the initiative to help the guests in front of them check in, the front desk would rather let the guests stand in front of them and watch them deal with it.

The hotel facilities are a bit outdated. The handle of the curtain rod was broken and my hand was pricked when I was pulling the curtains. The slippers are just ordinary ones without a logo, just like the products of an unknown small hotel.

There were no cups in the water bar, only two teacups on the table.

Because I was having breakfast alone, I deliberately wrote a note and put it on the table. When I came back, the utensils were taken away.

The smell of mold on the floor was very strong, and the leftover tableware from the dining room in the opposite room was left at the door without being taken care of all night!

The next day, the electric switch in the room tripped. I tried it several times and then moved to the next room. Unexpectedly, the toilet water kept gushing. Finally, I moved to the 22nd floor, holding a pile of clothes and pushing a suitcase. Went, luckily the waiter helped, otherwise it would have been too embarrassing. These are not the most important. The most important thing is that we arrived at the hotel on an early morning flight and negotiated with the front desk many times. If there is a room, we will make accommodations. The front desk staff was very determined and refused to make arrangements before 11 o'clock. So we were seated from 3 o'clock in the morning. I struggled on the sofa in the lobby until 11 noon, and my whole body was about to collapse. If you don't have a room, I understand. Even if you have a room, you won't arrange it. The front desk insists on upgrading the room and charges more than 400 per night to arrange it. I hope the hotel can be more user-friendly.

In addition, although the front desk asked the employee of Leeds to issue the invoice for half an hour, which delayed me for half an hour, but because I had reserved half an hour, I just caught up with the business at the last minute and did not really delay myself, so forget it. The service quality of this hotel is really not good. I am not the only one who says this. I think many people give one star because of the service. Many things have happened. If you don’t feel that service quality is needed and you feel that you are in a good mood even if you encounter trouble in the hotel, then you can still stay.

1. Tea bags and coffee did not appear in the room until the last third day of check-in (I thought there was no @@)
2. Thanks to Ms. Fan, an employee of the Chinese restaurant, because my power bank has a withholding fee, and there is no refund. She is very enthusiastic to help me deal with it, and she is very enthusiastic about service. I hope that the Millennium supervisor will reward and love this kind of employee.

msg:Really, when this hotel sells for 800 yuan, the Kerry Hotel across the road sells for 1400 yuan, for obvious reasons, and the millennium service is so bad, or even no service:
The five-star plaque given by the Tourism Bureau is hung on the wall at the front desk, but it does something that only a three-star hotel will do.
①If one guest checks in, only one room card can be given! Come on, many people don’t feel safe with only one room card, okay? They asked repeatedly and even gave two room cards after a quarrel. It’s so funny. (Excuse me, what’s wrong with giving an extra room card? Even if some people accidentally take it away, so what. You can’t just issue one room card. I still don’t agree with this approach)
②The basic room has two orientations, one of which is to watch the cctv, but when you check in, you don’t ask which orientation you want, and you just give it to the person who doesn’t watch the cctv: under the same conditions, give the bad room to the guest by default? ? Is this a normal way of thinking? Under the same conditions, shouldn't it be better for the guests? I didn’t ask you to upgrade to a higher room type. It’s just that there is a good orientation in the same room type. The default is almost. I still can’t understand what kind of thinking it is
③ The hotel is very old, poorly maintained and cheap equipment
④ There is no concierge at the entrance of the hotel, no doorman: when you get off, no one opens the door, no one greets you and says "Welcome to the Millennium Hotel", no one helps you with your luggage, there is only one security guard to maintain the order of the vehicle
⑤ Pay attention to hygiene. The buttons in the elevator room are full of spots, which cannot be wiped off? Use potion, use abrasive paper, it’s terrible, I dare not press it with my hands every time I go up and down the stairs, it’s too dirty
⑥Is the housekeeping depar**ent serious? Look at the photo, the quilt cover is so wrinkled, full of big lines and big folds, can you take it out and use it? ? I can't understand it at all.
⑦I informed the duty manager on the first point and the second point, but it was only a verbal apology and it ended, and at the front desk I told the front desk mm that I would write a bad review if I was dissatisfied, but all the people in the hotel did not have any remedies and no sense of service (when I learned that the customer was not satisfied and even had to write a negative review. Shouldn’t the manager on duty have a face-to-face talk to save it? No)
 
If this hotel continues like this, it will definitely be si

In addition to the excellent location, there is nothing else.

msg:I recently stayed at the Millennium Hotel in Beijing for 3 nights. I felt very bad. The interior decoration facilities in the room were outdated, and the hinges of the door could not be closed; the WiF was stuck, and I had to use data; the TV was very small, which was not the same as the size of the room. Matching; there are few buffet breakfast dishes, and the yogurt in the yogurt machine doesn't even taste like yogurt. Anyway, it's a five-star hotel. The lobby is well-decorated, and the rooms are really not good.

Environment: the environment is the only satisfactory item
Service: The service level of a five-star hotel is not as good as Atour Hotel
Facilities: relatively old, quite satisfactory, but with a strong traditional flavor, friends who like to live in old and retro hotels should be acceptable
Parking: There is a fee, about 100 yuan a night.
Summary: It’s okay to stay at a low price on weekdays or at a discounted price. It’s recommended to choose other better options for staying at an expensive price on holidays.

The most troublesome thing about New Year's Eve is where to go to eat and drink, because no matter where you go, there are many people queuing up, so you don't have to think about anything when you stay in a hotel, and you can spend the New Year's Eve warmly and comfortably. This hotel is beyond my expectation. It is good in all aspects. I didn't keep reminding me because I stayed up late and checked out a little late. Thank you very much. The check-in experience is very good, and it is convenient to go everywhere. Will come again if there is a chance.

#Facilities: The overall facilities are high-end and ok, but some of the facilities in the room are old, and the detail management is average. For example, there are tea bags and coffee bags in the room, but no spoons? The wooden shutters next to the bathtub have begun to peel off paint, the bath towels have been skipped, and the small door of the maintenance room under the bathtub cannot be closed...
#Management: The floor is clearly non-smoking, and there are indeed a lot of cigarette butts on the small trash bin at the elevator entrance in the corridor. When I checked in, I asked about the strong smell of smoke in the corridor.
#健康: There are handprints on the glass doors of the toilet and bathroom, and I found it a little annoying when I first checked in.

msg:There are many good and bad hotels that I have stayed in for business trips and travel. Never has a hotel felt so poorly balanced. It's hard to pick out a good spot.
 Encountering the health treasure pop-up window on the second day of check-in was depressing enough. I found the front desk coordination. At first, I was impatient and evasive. If I asked too much, I would be unhappy and treat us like a ball.
 On the first day, we cooperated actively. After thinking about leaving Beijing, we went to fill out the emergency departure form in the evening. As a result, we bought a relatively late air ticket at their meeting and the price was relatively expensive during the day. As a result, at night Filling in the form, I swore that I would help, but in the morning, the health treasure did not touch the pop-up window. We called the Cultural Tourism Bureau and got feedback that the hotel did not upload our departure ticket information from Beijing. At this time, it was less than three hours before we boarded the plane, and it took more than an hour to get to the airport. They also made us wait.
During the forty-eight hours of staying here, I saw not only quarrels with us, but also a quarrel with three or four ladies downstairs, and all kinds of pointing. The hotel room is clean and dirty, and the bathroom is very bad and clogged with rain and water.
What's even more ridiculous is that we got a pop-up window. They notified all the staff without permission and someone took the initiative to ask us if it was a pop-up window. What's even more disgusting is that our nucleic acid results are all out. We eat takeaway (the hotel restaurant is not allowed to enter) and we want chopsticks. The elder sister who took the chopsticks was almost two meters away from us and wanted to throw the chopsticks at us and run away. We are a pop-up window given by big data, not a diagnosis.
Faced with a lot of problems in this hotel, we called to inquire about the departure procedures, but we heard a loud discussion clearly on the other end of the phone, what happened to them. Helpless speechless disgusting hotel. We will defend our rights, and we cannot swallow this bad breath for nothing else.
Let's take a look at the picture, this is the first layer that was spread out after opening the TV cabinet. It's all gray, and the water stains from the handprints in the ice bucket below are not clean. There are a lot of yellow things in the refrigerator I don't know what it is.
We stopped taking pictures of the toilet’s drainage, and we also took pictures of the two front desk staff who were arguing with us to save face for you. Hope you can really improve it

The setting sun shines on the water in the evening, which reminds me that the location of the hotel is the "Golden Terrace". Sunset”; the third is outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of the restaurant on the first floor, where the tall French plane trees bring eyes full of green.

Disadvantages and suggestions: The facade of the hotel is very important. The staff at the front desk and lobby basically have no smiles and greetings, which does not meet the etiquette standards of a five-star hotel; a girl at the front desk does not have any welcome and explanation when checking in, it seems If you say a word, you will feel tired; the service is given 1 extra point because you helped me with a free upgrade, thank you; secondly, the hygiene of the room can easily see dust and dirt, the pillowcase has holes, and the bathroom handle is full of Imprints, the five-star hotel said that they could not understand; before going out, I turned on do not disturb. I didn’t expect to find that the hotel service staff had entered the room without permission after returning to the room. I really need to strengthen training⚠️

msg:We arrived at the Millennium Hotel in the evening of 8.21 because it is five-star and because it is more convenient to go anywhere in the city center. Next, I will evaluate the stay experience.
First of all, the environment is ok, but the smell of the corridor in the room is very bad. I don't know if it's the carpet or what. It's very deductible. The hygiene is not bad. The cleaning aunt is very good and docile. This is the reason why I give four points for hygiene

Next, in terms of service evaluation, it is well known that five-star hotels are one of the most important points compared to other hotel services. We got off the plane and arrived at the hotel on the same day to check in at the front desk. I thought I was in an ordinary hotel. Attitude is not a smiling face 1. There is no honorific, let us sign the epidemic prevention guarantee letter, and it is not clear where the signature is. I am also very reluctant to point out that I think I am too sensitive How can I know the exact place across the road when I go out? I can't say the address, but I keep emphasizing that it's the next day or we are on Baidu Navigation. Obviously, we have to walk for a while and say what kind of professionalism is on the opposite side of the road. When you don't even tell where the elevator is, you have to ask and be cold-hearted. Who knows where the elevator is for the first time?
Your Millennium Hotel usually doesn't do staff training? Is it just because the location is good and the price is rated as a five-star rating? Plus, it was popped up on the third day, and the service was really messed up. Or was it because you were going to renew the fee on the third night? A front desk surnamed Fu gave me some comfort and took the initiative to ask how our room was very patient and very good. I don't know if it is the manager on duty or not. This is the first front desk to ask us how we feel instead of Blindly mechanical work is really gratifying

In the end, many of the equipments are very old. The room we stayed in the first two days was very humid. Later, we adjusted the direction of the room for us to relieve some. However, the water temperature is constant and the hot water is basically three seconds, which is worthy of praise.

Hope to improve and hope to be worthy of your so-called five-star level

Because of the convenient transportation and beautiful price on the East Third Ring Road, I chose the Millennium Hotel as the first choice, and there were surprises everywhere. First of all, we chose the executive double room, just to enjoy the benefits of the executive floor, all-inclusive food, lodging and play, saving worry and trouble. The services of the executive lounge and the front desk are warm and thoughtful, especially the service of Joy Jing in the executive lounge on the 10th yesterday was more attentive and cordial, making us feel at home. The room service is also very prompt, the attitude is good, and the swimming pool is amazing. In short, Buqi is a five-star hotel, with great value, and will come again during the National Day holiday.

Only the last time the hotel waiter helped to open the door to the front desk. The check-in was very slow. There were few staff and the order was chaotic. The five-star and the most dissatisfying thing is that what happened in the swimming pool is not big and there is no clear statement that children are not allowed to enter. During the period, I encountered a foreigner with very low quality and some unpleasant words from the staff were really okay. In China, foreigners in Beijing need to be superior to others? Can be arrogant? The public space is not his private swimming pool.

The location is very good, the transportation is convenient, there are also subways around, it is convenient to travel
The hotel environment is clean and tidy, the rooms are large enough, and the facilities are relatively complete. A suggestion is that the bathtub would be better if it is equipped with a bathtub cover
Hotel facilities, gym, baths (not open during the epidemic)
Overall worthy of a five-star hotel, still very good.

msg:Very bad, very bad! After staying for two days, I wanted to drink a Coke in the middle of the night. At 12:30 in the evening, no one answered the phone at the front desk. I called N and no one paid any attention. After the last half an hour, I called again, answered, thought To drink a coke, I said that there was a QR code in the room. I searched for a long time, but there was no QR code at all. I stayed for two nights and there was no QR code in both rooms. It was clearly a lie! Finally, I placed an order with the front desk and bought a Sprite, a soda, Sprite, 20, soda is Watson’s, 45 yuan, and then I bought a Sprite, 20, and a service fee of 3 yuan, that’s all. The result told me to pay now. I obviously still have a deposit, so I just need to pay the account directly. Why do I have to pay directly? Can I run? Drunk you a sprite? In a five-star hotel, there is only a refrigerator in the room. Are there any decorations? If you don’t have a bottle of drink, you can pay for it, and you can pay the bill. Is your hotel so anxious to charge? Really speechless, never come to live again, not to mention the environment, I am also sorry for one night 898, outdated facilities, if not for the convenience of transportation, I would never come, the service is also extremely poor, I have never seen the same money! Everyone, please don't come, I really didn't write a bad review to the hotel. I was really uncomfortable, so I don't know how this five-star hotel gave it. It's a fake to go through the back door!

msg:I go to Beijing for business all the year round, this is the hotel experience I have experienced very dissatisfied with. First of all, we checked in at 3 o'clock and transferred from a hotel to Millennium. On the last day, I hoped to see CCTV as Ctrip said, and I told Ctrip in advance to make arrangements as much as possible. Secondly, after arriving at your store, the front desk told me that only one hotel in Nuoda is clean, and there are no big pants to look at. I'm a little disappointed, but it's not a must-see. After entering the room, there is still a smell in the room, and a thick layer of ash has accumulated on the desk and the side bookcase! too disgusting! Exactly like a room left uncleaned all year round! The curtains must be pressed all the time to lift and lower, and the shading effect is extremely poor. Pulling the curtains by hand will knock on the glass, and you will be woken up when you sleep! Later, I contacted the service area (the waiting time was very long), and my aunt came up to wipe the desk, but she didn't completely wipe the dust off the side. I thought it was just for one night. Later, when I went to sleep, I found that the bedside table and the corner of the bed were all dusty and itchy. I doubted whether the room was properly sanitized and whether it was properly disinfected during the epidemic prevention and control period! ! The shower head of the toilet is difficult to turn to the side and difficult to use. Finally, the front desk staff made me feel that I did not meet the attitude of a five-star hotel, and made me feel that we were not very welcoming and lofty attitude. Originally, we wanted to say that the best thing about the hotel is the staff who picked us up and picked us up at the door. Unfortunately, when we checked out and left the hotel, they turned a blind eye and no longer had the enthusiasm when we checked in. In conclusion, I will not be staying at this hotel and would not recommend anyone around me to stay. Hygiene and service attitude, bad review. At that time, I was exhausted and didn't have time to take pictures. I was responsible for my comments and hoped that the hotel would strengthen its management.

msg:Never give bad reviews to merchants, it's really intolerable. The lobby was dark, and a musty smell came out of the elevator. Because the air conditioner does not cool down, it will be changed to room 2147 around 10 o'clock in the evening. After sitting on the sofa for a short time, three mosquitoes were found and they were beaten to death with slippers. Later, it was found that the insect bite was not caused by mosquitoes, and a careful search revealed that it was fleas and unknown insects. The response was sent to the lobby manager, and he was perfunctory and evasive. After Ctrip's customer service stepped in, Shanshan gave me a room change. It was already more than one o'clock. After such tossing and frightening, he stayed up almost all night. Change to another hotel in the morning. After checking online reviews, this hotel has been exposed to the silkworm jumping incident. It is really infuriating that a five-star hotel has so many infectious disease pests living with its guests, and indifferent trea**ent after responding to the problem! If you post this post here, if the hotel causes my health or other adverse consequences, I reserve the right to follow up.

msg:The hotel is relatively close to China Zun Guo Mao, which is only three to four hundred meters away. But the room I stayed in couldn't see, the China Zun and CCTV Broadcasting Building at night. The overall hotel environment is relatively outdated and looks like an old-fashioned hotel. Perhaps because of the earlier opening, the overall facilities are relatively outdated. Personal feelings, overall feelings, no longer look like a five-star hotel. The hotel is equipped with a swimming pool and a gym. The swimming pool is relatively large, but the gym is relatively small. The overall fitness equipment is relatively outdated and the equipment is relatively small. The hotel equipment has no special features, it is Longli's own brand, and it is also made by other three factories. In his price, I personally think it is more suitable if it is a five-star hotel, but there are many newer hotels at this price to choose from. Although the hotel is a five-star hotel, there is no welcome gift or welcome fruit plate. The overall service is relatively poor, without the feeling of a five-star hotel. Generally speaking, I personally feel that it is more suitable for business trips and not suitable for traveling and staying with friends. It belongs to things that are more complete, but relatively old. Personally, it is not very recommended. The hotel does not have a parking lot, and the outside parking lot is also chargeable, not the hotel's own. The overall room size is relatively spacious, but the layout is not very reasonable. If 5 stars are full of stars, the personal recommendation index is only two and a half stars. It is a five-star hotel with relatively high cost performance, but the equipment is relatively outdated and the service is very average.

msg:Let me talk about the disadvantages first:
1- No welcome gift
2- Pay the deposit at the store
3- I delivered less meal baskets for breakfast, only two slices of whole wheat bread and a stomach of water QAQ
4- Some furniture is outdated
There is no night view below the 5-10th floor, and the distance between the buildings is very close.
6-Bottled water is cheaper, but it should be refilled in time
advantage:
1- The doorman, cleaning, and waiter are of high quality, and the service is in place and fast
2- The parking lot is very large, the doorman can park and pick up the car
3- The environment is clean and a**ospheric, with ample sense of space
4- Security awareness is very high during the epidemic, and a green code must be provided for each entry
5- No indoor recording and radio equipment detected
6- The gym swimming pool is open normally
7-The meeting area on both sides of the hall is luxurious and luxurious, and there are also professional meeting rooms that can be customized
8-The room network diagram is almost the same as the real thing
9- There are more choices of catering services, and the food delivery is fast
10- In the center of the business district, International Trade, Sanlitun, Fortune Plaza, shopping and leisure are not afraid to return late

Generally speaking, it is a hotel that will stay again, and the personal experience is good.

msg:Stayed here for two nights and probably commented on a few aspects I paid more attention to

Transportation: Very good location, next to big pants, a few minutes walk from the subway station, basically at the subway entrance, easy to take a taxi or public travel.

Surrounding: Next to the hotel is a shopping complex, Burger King Green Tea Watsons and other basic restaurants are complete, from the second floor of the hotel can go directly into the mall, eating, drinking and having fun.

Landscape: Different room types have different landscape directions, you can consult the front desk in advance. My big pants are right, okay

Housing environment: The area is large, about 45 is spacious, basically is the standard area of this price. The supporting software and hardware are complete, manual toilet, electric curtains. The bathtub is not very smooth after water discharge, cleanliness is general. The downside is that the room door is not soundproof, the air conditioning system is old, I don't know how the other rooms are. I feel that this room has a little old smoke smell at first, and it is better. If I feel inappropriate after I stay, I can actually find a replacement at the front desk. I am too lazy to make a fuss.

Remarks: check out at 12:00, late check out can be communicated with front desk

Score:
Traffic 5/5
Housing environment 4/5
Housing facilities 4/5

Checking in or reusing the room card requires queuing. It is not humane at all, and from the door. From the child to the lobby service to the room service, the attitude is mechanized, and the service level is as fast as that, which is really disappointing.

樓下步行十分鐘，有各種美味的餐廳，麪包店，早午餐咖啡館。
酒店旁邊就是金台夕照地鐵站，自行車騎到三里屯也就十幾分鍾，到國貿也差不多。
酒店雖然不新，但是設施可以看出來品質很不錯，並不破舊，反而有些老派的美……當然也有可能是周邊美食給我的濾鏡……😊

我們辦完入住，自己把行李推到房間，行李車放到走廊，一直到第二天早上出門，行李車居然還在原地！一整晚沒有任何人管。我們好心把行李車推下樓。
退房離開的時候，帶了一堆行李到門口，車到了往後備箱裝行李，禮賓的人沒有送出來，門口保安居然看見我們裝行李故意跑到遠處。
相比於其他酒店禮賓熱情幫忙拿行李，這家服務差到不知道該説什麼，旅行全程最差的一家酒店。失望，不會再住了。

另外，如果後續入住，需要非常注意，如果提前退房，剩下的天數是無法退款的！！！

環境：房間面積還是比較大的，周邊簡直不要太便利，美中不足不能免停車費，不過國貿商圈酒店都一樣。
服務：服務人員服務意識較強，住的並且久感觸也不是很深。有機會再去可以好好體驗。

槽點就是物品擺放位置不合理，你每次把紙抽和垃圾桶擺到你常用的位置，打掃的時候就會給你挪到原來的角落，來回好多次真是心累。
感覺比較坑的是停車費，住店不免費停車還8塊一小時巨貴，住幾天停車費1500，太誇張了。
服務還不錯，趕上維修第一個房間飄進來走廊的油漆味，反饋後就有工作人員幫忙換房。就是設備也比較陳舊了，換的房間門栓和枱燈都出了點小問題，洗澡的時候吊頂裏還冒火星。。
