msg:Another great stay at Kempinski! 

We often come here to simply enjoy quiet and relaxing time to get away from busy city life! It sounds crazy to say to come to the centre of the city but if it book Club room with executive lounge it‚Äôs possible! You can enjoy quiet breakfast, lovely lunch and cute afternoon tea and great happy hours with less people around with stunning view from 28th floor! Stuffs here are always great wiling to help you and attentive which we can‚Äôt see often‚Ä¶we can see people are working with smiles that is from their heart so hospitality is wonderful.
Always great to stay at indoor swimming pool and Spa which is quite relaxing with amazing view from 30th floor! 
From the moment you arrive at check-In counter and during your stay and at the check-out you feel like detox stay at the beautiful Kempinski! 

üçΩÔ∏è: variety food of breakfast and they will prepare extra things if you ask them 
üõåüõãÔ∏è: lovely decorations with new sofa, very comfortable bed and sofa makes your stay very relaxing! 
üç∞üçáü´ê: Kind fruits and sweets service, it‚Äôs very sweet arrangement! 

We will definitely come back again soon for another relaxing staycation!

The room is clean but the carpet in our room is worn and stained., and shower was leaking big time. The bathroom is huge and has a large great soaking  tub. The room where we stayed was large but it was a bit noisy- perhaps the room above us or that we were right by the elevators during May holiday. So first night we didn‚Äôt get much sleep. If you can get a room in a quiet area, it‚Äôs worth the stay. Beds are quite comfy.

It made for an excellent focal point for exploring the city, and the surrounding area was vibrant and bustling with activity. The facilities were generally quite good. The room itself was spacious and well-appointed, providing a comfortable environment to unwind after a day of sightseeing. However, I did encounter a minor inconvenience during check-in. The process took longer than expected, which was a bit frustrating after a long journey.

The staff, despite the extended check-in time, were courteous and professional. They were attentive to my needs throughout my stay and were quick to address any concerns or queries I had.

Also, the receptionist acted like a scam way in which he readies my room key and room no. Before he told me to pay!

We had to wait over an hour to check-in because the room was not ready but the staff made it up by letting us check out late. The staff were great, room was great, my biggest disappointment was the New Year's Eve party that was advertised as Latin Style but the DJ was not playing latin music majority of the time. There was also a lot of children on the "dance floor" which I didn't expect. There are many options for NYE parties around the city and I will def avoid this one again next year. Everything else was fine :)

Take note that the spa‚Äôs windows are see-through, so I‚Äôm guessing the people from the banking tower opposite can see the nak*d sauna users. We found this out when we were at Level 1 and could look at the ceiling of the spa ‚Äî meaning if you were horizontally opposite, you‚Äôd be able to see the floor to ceiling of the spa. Anyway, we weren‚Äôt allowed to check in despite having landed in shanghai at 5am unless we upgraded to an executive suite which costs $200sgd more per pax ‚Äî way to upsell some sleepy and tired tourists who alr paid to upgrade to bund-view. The view of bund was lackluster as it wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúhappening‚Äù part. Oh well. Location wasn‚Äôt very near a metro too ‚Äî it was quite walk (10-15 mins) to the nearest Lu Jia Zui metro. Furnishing was old-fashion and the heater was working overdrive ‚Äî it was soooo warm. Wouldn‚Äôt consider again, will probably do Shangri La or Conrad for less and a better view of the bund.

Staff was pretty helpful with everything and quite fast at fulfilling requests. The room I stayed in, had the view of the river, not the best view, still a view though. To be staying at a high end hotel, you expect your towels to smell nice. They smelled real bad as if no detergent was ever used. The shower leaked out of the shower door, too. The overall was okay. I might stay there again, even though I think it‚Äôs overpriced for the above mentioned reasons. Thanks to the nice people working hard there.

The lights in the bathroom were also far too dark, sometimes I could barely see myself or what I was doing.

Didi from room service was very bubbly and helped make a great choice for dinner. If I could make a suggestion , It would be for the TV, all of the channels are in Chinese apart from 2. To cater for all guests , Chinese speakers and non Chinese speakers, maybe smart TVs would suffice so that guests can airplay their favorite shows. Thank you

msg:Our experience at the Grand Kempinski Hotel was amazing because of its great location, the view was great as well. The front office staff during check-in was very helpful and the best thing is, she speaks english.

The only disappointment was during the check-out. The front office guy handling our check out was in my opinion trying to overcharge us with room rate and Havanna bar charges even if we did not order anything. Our room rate in C-Trip was CNY1,600+ and the hotel staff printed us a room charge of CNY2,900+/night and CNY80+ Havanna Bar Charges. Totally dishonest where in fact our C-Trip booking reservation was noted during check-in and of-course the room rate is also there. Why would all of a sudden give us CNY2,900+/night room rate out of nowhere? When I refused and told him the rate is wrong, he suddenly made a new print-out with the adjusted room rate but still incorrect since his breakdown was CNY1400+ room rate and CNY80+ Havanna Bar charges totaling to CNY1600+. Again, we never ordered anything at the Havanna Bar.    

So if you plan to stay at this hotel, make sure to check the room rates during your check-out and the overall bill in general. Other than that, Kempinski is a great place to stay.

The extra effort made by housekeeping and by front of house was appreciated. Quick to arrange the kids' extra sheets for their fold out bed, brought them a welcome bag of treats to make them welcomed.
The pool staff were not all that keen on young kids, and we're disapproving of a lot of the normal pool play activities we expected, even when there were no other guests or visitors in the pool.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

The inroom tub was small (but I am a large person (about 190cm). I absolutely loved the bed. One of the most comfortable I have experienced in Shanghai. They let my friends and I use a common space to play board games all day and night, which was a huge benefit. My biggest complaint is that I sent the hotel a message about a safety concern regarding the pool (adult hot tub and the children's pool) and they have failed to respond. If you let your child in either pool, be very careful around the filter suction on the bottom of the tubs. The suction is super strong. A child I was there with complained that it hurt, and I felt the same with my own feet. I was waiting to review here until I heard from them... But it's been nearly a month. Other than that, I would not hesitate to stay there again.

Bringing children to stay, the housekeeping depar**ent also prepared children's toiletries and slippers, as well as a Stitch doll, which is really good.

The room service is good, and it is also timely after calling if something needs to be delivered.
Disadvantages: I personally feel that the design of the room switch is not very reasonable. After the main switch is turned off when sleeping, other switches cannot be turned on. The child gets up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and uses the mobile phone flashlight to find the switch,

msg:I have never stayed in a five-star hotel with such poor hygiene. The toilet was not cleaned at all. It was disgusting. I called the hotel management and arranged a cleaning lady to come and take a look. Then she went back to get the cleaning tools and cleaned it. The cleaning lady was very enthusiastic and had a good attitude. Then there was nothing else. As a hotel with such a big problem, except for arranging a cleaning lady to come, there was no follow-up call or active action to solve the problem. It was so disappointing. The room was not soundproofed. In the morning, the children next door were shouting, and no one intervened. I didn't know what was going on upstairs. It was like decoration, and I was woken up before 8 o'clock in the morning. It was torture. I will not stay in this hotel again.

In front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, we overlooked the winding river and the city skyline, which was refreshing. The room was fully equipped, including a comfortable big bed and high-speed Wi-Fi. What I lingered most was the hotel's swimming pool and health room, which are located on the 30th floor. Through the huge floor-to-ceiling windows, you can enjoy the glittering Oriental Pearl Tower.

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, located on the Lujiazui River. The Binjiang Avenue downstairs is a pleasant place for walking and cycling. It takes only five minutes along the river to the Oriental Pearl Tower and the pier; the Taitongzhan ferry is also downstairs. Take the ferry to the North Bund on the other side to see the night view, completely avoiding the surging crowds of the Bund.
I was worried about whether the hotel would be old before, but I completely dispelled it after checking in. Not only did I get two rooms with super views, but the quality details and maintenance were also very online, and the bathroom was also excellent. It is definitely a first-line old-fashioned management level. Kempinski is very friendly to children. Welcome gifts and children's supplies have been prepared in advance, and there are enough White Rabbits~ Although the gym and swimming pool on the top floor can be seen to be old, the facilities are very new and the view is invincible. Havanabar has good wine and the resident singer is great~
The catering level is online, facing the Oriental Pearl Tower and Lujiazui street view in the rain, parents and children like it very much~

I stayed for two days. On the first day, the bed sheets and quilt covers were not clean, so they were changed. Then the hot water in the shower could not be adjusted. It took half an hour to fix it, so I had to change the room.
When I came back the next day, I found that the bathroom was cleaned, but the room was not cleaned, and the bed sheets and quilt covers were still messy. I changed the room again.
Changing rooms twice in two days is tiring.

msg:In fact, objectively speaking, the hotel is quite satisfactory in terms of hardware. It is not amazing but has no flaws. The hygiene is also good. The most fatal injury is the service. Arguably zero. First of all, there is no concierge at the drop-off area to help with luggage. The concierge is busy greeting foreign friends and has no time to take care of compatriots. It makes people feel bad at first sight. There are worse ones. There is a large piece of iron plate next to the revolving door at the drop-off area. It happened to be raining heavily in Shanghai during the few days I checked in. When I was in a hurry to get into the car, I slipped a big step and almost fell. In a moment of shock, I realized that the security guard at the door had seen me and was just watching indifferently. He neither stepped forward to ask nor wanted to help. His expression was silent, which made me very angry. Moreover, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel that looks like a skating rink when it rains does not have a warning sign or any prompts. As a star hotel, it can be said to be too bad. Not to mention the sight of people who are so busy serving foreign guests but then indifferent to their compatriots. I won't stay here again next time. This hotel seems to be for conferences. There is occupancy, so there is no focus on guest experience.

Sheraton Hangzhou, Kimpton Suzhou and the experience was very good. Both my mother and my partner liked it (usually) I stayed in the same place for two consecutive days without changing hotels. I was too lazy to take my luggage. This is the only hotel where I couldn‚Äôt stay there. I dragged my family of four with my luggage and changed rooms to Jing‚Äôan InterContinental the next day. As soon as I walked in, I felt comfortable.)
The difference is that the facilities are old and old. I won‚Äôt talk about it. I called the hotel phone number left on Ctrip the day before and on the day of booking. I never called. I checked in at two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon. Only one room was given to me and the other one was being cleaned. Let the family first. Check-in We two young people are going to Disneyland to play at Disneyland. It‚Äôs almost 11 o‚Äôclock. We want to call and ask if they can help us move our luggage to the room. It took seven or eight calls to get through (I‚Äôm really speechless). It's either a busy line or there's no answer.) When we got back to the hotel, we had all the messages processed in the afternoon. It just took a few seconds to give us the room card and it was OK. I don't know what the handsome guy at the front desk was doing to help with check-in. They didn't even have time to give us a room card. We asked two or three times and were impatient and asked to wait. It was really short-staffed and it was really interesting. I was originally a five-star hotel and it was my first time to see so many. There were only two people at the front desk so busy at night that they didn't even have time to reach out and give me a room card? Later, we were already cold and tired. I immediately got angry and said that I would check out without giving the room card. Can't I go to so many hotels next door and just book a room? The guy at the front desk just looked at us and got us a room card. .
Kempinski is really blocked and I will never go there again in my life. This is my first bad hotel review in my life. It‚Äôs really awesome.

Are the swimming and spa facilities on the 30th floor outsourced? It feels different from the hotel. Parent-child room Pig Man, I can see that the hotel has put a lot of care into it, and put a lot of props, but it only highlights that the carpet needs a big cleaning, the colors are uncomfortable, and the guest room configuration is indeed old. The TV should be updated to a larger size as soon as possible, or the bathroom should be upgraded as soon as possible. In terms of cleaning, the guest rooms are much behind the luxury five-star hotel.

msg:It was not a particularly pleasant check-in experience. First of all, we couldn't check in at six o'clock in the evening. They said that the room was not ready, so we were asked to go to the restaurant with a bunch of luggage to eat first (the executive room itself has simple meals, so if not Don‚Äôt you have to wait?) According to the regulations, you cannot check in before three o‚Äôclock in the afternoon because there are many people during the Spring Festival. This is understandable, but it is already six o‚Äôclock and you can‚Äôt check out at 12 o‚Äôclock the next day. So why is the half-day room charge not included? Forget it? Secondly, my room type obviously has executive benefits and I can check out at 4 p.m., but I was told that I would check out at 12 p.m. the next day. Later, because I checked in too late, I was told to delay my check out until 2 p.m. It seemed that I had taken advantage of this. It‚Äôs my fault that I didn‚Äôt read the order carefully and only found out after I checked out. However, as a global high-end hotel chain, the service didn‚Äôt even provide the most basic reminder. I don‚Äôt believe it wasn‚Äôt displayed in the hotel system because I specifically asked for the check-out time. I checked out at 12 o'clock; thirdly, my order clearly stated that the room should not be close to the elevator hall. The order showed that my special request was accepted, but the actual room I was given was right next to the elevator hall, and it was the first one. I'm really too lazy to argue; fourth: the sound insulation effect of the room is extremely poor, the noise from the corridor and the bathroom in the next room are very noisy, there is no ventilation fan in the bathroom, and the air conditioner is very hot (temperature adjus**ent does not work). Staying in the bathroom for a while will make it uncomfortable. It feels like there will be a lack of oxygen, and there are no windows to open in the room. It is a fully closed window. The only consolation is that its location is good and the desserts in the restaurant are delicious

msg:Guide to avoid pitfalls: 1. The executive suites are not available on the executive floor. They said that the upper floors are all long private rooms. They were given a room on the 12th floor. They boasted about being close to the river. However, the room on this floor is opposite the office of DBS Bank. There is no such thing. There is privacy at all. If you want to book an executive suite, it is best to confirm in advance. 2. Be careful when eating breakfast alone. The breakfast on the 28th floor is much less than that on the 1st floor. There is no freshly cooked breakfast. There are many people eating breakfast on the first floor and you have to queue up. Come in, I finally got in, and got some snacks. I had to wait for noodles and egg pancakes. I went to get them after a while. When I came back, I found that the waiter had cleared away the seats for others to sit. I was the one holding the noodles and egg pancakes in the wind. It was messy, and then they said there was no room for the time being and they had to wait. I was obviously the one who was there first, so why did I have to wait again? What is the level of service? Third, the water temperature of the swimming pool is colder than other hotels, and it feels a bit like winter swimming. Fourth, the executive benefit of late check-out until four o'clock is written in writing, and it will not be given even if the room is not fully booked that day.
The above is a guide for avoiding pitfalls. I have to mention the good points. It is relatively close to the Oriental Pearl Tower. It only takes a few minutes to walk there. The river view is indeed beautiful.

The window of the room faces the Huangpu River. The scenery is good during the day and at night, and the field of vision is wide. You can see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the swimming pool, which is surprising.

Facilities: Judging from the style, it should have been a while, but the front desk said that the executive room was renovated two years ago, so overall it is OK, not to the level of "shabby" (different from the previous reviews), and the shower is quite comfortable

Hygiene: Very clean. My only suggestion is that the bathroom smelled like smoke when I first entered.

msg:I spent a long time choosing a hotel for my trip to Shanghai, and finally chose Dakai. The various reviews online were overwhelming, but in the end I firmly chose to trust the well-established hotel. There was no surprise or disappoin**ent. Check-in and check-out are relatively fast. The city view room has floor-to-ceiling windows and the view is okay. The gym can see the Pearl Tower. This location is relatively quiet and it is not noisy when sleeping. Hotel soundproofing is a problem that many hotels have. You can also hear the sound of the electric curtains in the next room, which is acceptable. Although the hotel facilities are a bit older, they are well maintained and acceptable. Breakfast is very rich around 7:30. The breakfast items on the first day are not that rich. If you buy breakfast separately after checking in, there is no need. There are special cabinets for takeout, which is very convenient to take out. This is also acceptable. It's just that at this location, if you don't go to the commercial district without taking the subway, you need to take a taxi. Although it's not far away, it's still convenient because it's across the river. The cleanliness is generally acceptable, except that the box of cherries left by the previous tenant was under the table and had not been cleaned. In terms of service, there is help with luggage and opening the door. These issues have been addressed in previous reviews, so I will just write down my experience based on my own stay. Overall, it still has the advantages of an established hotel. If you really want to choose among the same level in Shanghai, I still recommend Dakai!

It also brought back my memories of Shanghai in the past. This time I checked in, I felt that a hotel is not enterprising. Kempinski Hotel, a world-famous luxury hotel brand, has not improved or kept pace with the times in terms of facilities and services. The old TV, the old power switch, and the facilities from more than ten years ago are exactly the same as when I came here more than ten years ago. The staying environment and experience are not even as good as an Atour hotel.
You need to go downstairs to pick up the takeout you order. No one or robot will deliver the takeout to the room.
Before moving in, a guarantee was required, and upon arrival, the room fee and a deposit of 1,000 yuan were collected. In total, 3,000 yuan was basically deducted. In fact, this is nothing but trouble.
The bath water came out green, and the more it came out, the greener it became. I didn‚Äôt bother to care anymore.

There is a charge for drinks in the small refrigerator in the room. This is something I have never heard of in any hotel. It was an eye-opener for me. For four bottles of drinks, the most ordinary Coca-Cola, I paid an extra 150. I really didn‚Äôt see you have a charge sheet, and I really didn‚Äôt expect to charge for the drinks in the refrigerator.
There is no laundry room, and the laundry service charges are very high, so I gave up.

The scenery of your hotel is really good, but your environment and facilities that have remained unchanged for more than ten years will make you go downhill forever. No, you have changed, you have changed your name, but you cannot change your unruly and unruly heart.

They specially prepared a happy anniversary cake for us, so sweet! We also prepared a children's gift bag for the children, which not only included toiletries but also gave Stitch. Hotels of the same level in this area are too expensive, but Kempinski is the best value for money in my opinion, and it has a history of more than 120 years. I don‚Äôt want many people to rush in because I rarely repurchase hotels, and this is one. I want to come every year from now on. The environment is quiet and the service is good. There is an Italian üáÆüáπ restaurant and a üá™üá∏ restaurant on the second floor.

This hotel is considered one of the best in Shanghai, and this recommendation is not unfounded. The hotel is located in the city center, only a three-minute walk to the Oriental Pearl Tower. Whether traveling to a partner's office or visiting the city's attractions, transportation is very convenient. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the service is first-rate, and the staff are helpful and solve all problems quickly. The hotel also took the initiative to upgrade our room so that we could enjoy the magnificent view of downtown Shanghai. Breakfast offers so much choice that it's hard to decide which dish to try. We are very satisfied with our experience at the Kempinski Hotel, from the quality of service to the facilities, everything is amazing! Highly recommended, whether for business or tourism, it is an ideal accommodation choice in Shanghai.

When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff came out quickly to help with our luggage. Considering that the space in the original room was relatively small after adding an extra bed, the staff recommended us to upgrade to a suite when we checked in.


facility:

The hotel has been open for a while and the facilities are not too dilapidated. The lighting system in the room is a bit difficult to use. Once you press the main switch, you need to walk through the room of more than 100 square meters to turn on the lights.

Service: The experience is very bad. I stayed here for a week on business and left immediately after staying here for one day. The river view room was of the same price. The other hotels I stayed in a few days ago were much better. besides
There was also takeout and shopping, but the concierge did not deliver the service upstairs. This was the first time I had encountered this problem when I stayed in a hotel in the past ten years. I had to go downstairs to get it myself, so I decisively abandoned the store and ran away.

The connecting door in the middle of the room I arranged for the first time didn't feel like the privacy was very good. I moved to a lower floor with a much worse view. Later, I moved to a room with a better upper floor. Points of dissatisfaction:
1. My request was very clear, but I didn‚Äôt get a room change at one time. I had to change rooms twice. The attitude of the front desk was not good when I changed rooms in the middle.
2. The waiter who changed rooms for the second time did not provide adequate service. He threw down the room card and ran away. He had no intention of assisting at all.
What I'm more satisfied with: the first time I changed rooms, the waiter was very enthusiastic to help with some luggage. I was not feeling well on the day of check-out and was very considerate and gave me hot water.

2. Sound and vibration isolation is not good. At twelve o'clock in the evening, two children next door were making loud noises and banging on the wall, which woke me up. I called room service and it was resolved in 10 minutes.
3. There were several weddings on both mornings, which was a bit noisy.

Another thing I have to mention is the service of the hotel. It is worthy of being an old German five-star.

The service staff will take the initiative to say hello wherever they encounter in the hotel. Ms. Lenita Xie who checked in was very polite and enthusiastic. She also asked us if we had any other needs after checking in. We paid to get the river view suite with floor-to-ceiling windows and the river view was particularly beautiful.

You can find everything there, including McDonald‚Äôs, Burger King, Tims, coffee, Starbucks, Xiaoman‚Äôs hand-made noodles, Xiaoyang Shengjian, etc. have.
Second, although I came here for nostalgia, the hotel furniture and bathrooms are really too old. . . . .
Third, it‚Äôs quite quiet and the scenery is nice. You can see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the rooftop bar.

The hotel at this location should have a very high occupancy rate. I don't know where the musty smell came from.
However, the service attitude from the entrance to the lobby was good. My ID card was dropped in the elevator shaft. The hotel staff initially said it might cost 300 to 500 yuan. Later, I was told that the relevant elevator service company only needed to pay 100 yuan, and the scan code was very formal and they issued an invoice. I have to praise Shanghai for its high efficiency. But when the hotel staff first told me it was 300 to 500 yuan, I was puzzled.

The guest room is spacious, about 30 square meters, and the bathroom is also large, with wet and dry separation, separate bathtub and shower, and two wash basins. The single bed is estimated to be over 1.3 meters tall. Four bottles of drinking water are also provided daily. However, the facilities are relatively old. The resolution of the old Philips TV is estimated to be less than 720, and the TV programs played are muffled and cannot be watched. In addition, the night light is designed as a recessed light ***** on the roof (unreasonable). I booked a river view room. The large floor-to-ceiling glass windows can see the Huangpu River. However, due to the location of the hotel, I can only see the North Bund of Puxi. There are many varieties of breakfast and the service is also good. However, the quality of the food is not satisfactory. Western pastries (muffins, Danish rolls, etc.) and coffee (flavor, etc.) are always lacking.

msg:I have booked a hotel with Ctrip for many years and this is the first time I write a review. I really have something to say.
Before coming to Shanghai, I looked at all the hotels near the Bund, and finally chose Kempinski due to mixed reviews. After staying in, it‚Äôs really hard to comment.
Let‚Äôs start with the check-in. I took my daughter on a high-speed train trip alone. From the subway station to the hotel, I pushed a stroller with my left hand and a suitcase and two backpacks with my right hand. The concierge at the door did not greet me or help me. I took my luggage, and when I checked in, I told the front desk that I wanted a room on a high floor. She told me that the floors were randomly arranged. Finally, at my insistence, she offered me the highest floor room type, 2329. Remember this. Don‚Äôt stay in this room in the future! My daughter went swimming at night, and I didn‚Äôt know which side was the deep water. There was a waiter standing by the pool. I looked at him with confusion and said, ‚ÄúWhich side is the deep water?‚Äù He actually turned his head. I thought for a while that I The resident worked as a waiter. Then I was about to get into the swimming pool. I felt the water was deep. I looked up at him and saw clearly that he had a work badge on his chest. So I asked him again and he answered me. Later, when my daughter was swimming, I gave it to her. When I took the video, no one else was photographed. The waiter immediately told me that taking pictures was not allowed. I said, "??? I can't take pictures of my own daughter?" He said no, I would take pictures of others. I understand that taking pictures is not allowed in the dressing room. This is the first time I heard that photography is not allowed in the swimming pool. Back in the room, around 11 o'clock, I gave my daughter a bath and found that the children's products in the hotel were very poor. As for toothpaste, it was actually for adults. This was also the first time I encountered it. Then I called the front desk three times and no one answered.
Here comes the highlight. When I was sleeping, the bedside lamp suddenly turned on and off on its own. This happened multiple times throughout the night. I was living alone with my child and God knows how scared I was! I didn't dare to sleep, and I couldn't sleep at all, because the light was right next to my bed! Around 4 o'clock in the middle of the night, my daughter suddenly sat up and said she had a stomachache and vomited again. It was around 5 o'clock. I called the front desk to ask if there was a hot water bottle, but no one answered the phone! So I used my mobile phone to call the hotel number on Ctrip at 5:53, and told the front desk that the lights in the room kept turning on and off by themselves. She asked a technician to fix it if it was convenient. I directly said that I wanted to change rooms, so they gave me no compensation. I changed to a room of the same level, which I am not satisfied with. The lady at the front desk said there was no hot water bottle and asked me to find a warmer. Although I didn't get it until after seven o'clock, I was very grateful. I called in the middle of the day because it was already breakfast time. I asked the front desk to bring me a bowl of hot porridge for the child. I told her that the child had vomited many times and wanted her to drink something hot. Another male waiter answered the phone. He asked me if I was not going to have breakfast. If I still wanted to have breakfast, I would be charged for ordering food in the room. Do you understand? I paid for my breakfast with my own money. I wanted a piece of hot porridge. I was not allowed to eat, or else I would be charged extra. I stressed many times that the child was not feeling well, but he seemed unable to empathize. When he called me back for the second time to confirm the meal delivery, I couldn‚Äôt hold it back. After fighting him, he finally sent it. Finally, I would like to thank the two waiters in the restaurant. I took my child to the hospital and went to the restaurant to pack breakfast, but ended up vomiting all over the floor. A chef handed me water and paper, and showed all kinds of care to my child. I am ready After wiping the floor clean, the girl who helped me pack said that it was fine, just take care of the kids and we would be fine. In short, I will not choose Kempinski again in the future.

4. The breakfast is very average. If you are not expecting the room, you should have breakfast, but the breakfast should be similar to that of a locked hotel
5. The location is worthy of recognition. It is five or six hundred meters to the Oriental Pearl Tower, and the cruise ship terminal is also very close. The lobby is not bad, and this lobby can match the five-star standard. If you spend 1500‚ûï, I think there are many places to choose from. If the room in this place exceeds 800, it is not cost-effective, so choose carefully

When I checked in, the front desk said that I could upgrade to a river view room, but due to the Spring Festival, I needed to pay. , an increase of 400 yuan per room per night, I agreed, but I didn‚Äôt feel the trea**ent of the executive river view room at all. I only gave my child a bath and fruit for check-in once, but never again. Moreover, I was not told about the benefits that should come with an executive room. The room I stayed in was different from the one in the picture. This was after I checked out. Just discovered it. After spending so much money, I didn't get the service and trea**ent I deserved.

The infinity pool on the 30th floor can be entered as long as you check in. Remember to bring a swimsuit if you need it. Although the hotel facilities are not very new, they are clean and tidy. I read comments before saying that the front desk was inefficient and did not send luggage or anything. I have never encountered it. The front desk service is warm and efficient, and the luggage is delivered after check-in. The luggage storage is also more considerate, and the courier called for taking the baby out to play halfway also helped to accept it. The view from the room is good. Dolls like big bathtubs. The room facilities are basically the same as the photos on Ctrip, and many details are good. Check-out is also a fast check-out, without delay, the staff at the door will help to carry the suitcase directly to the trunk of the car. When you go out of the hotel, turn right under the DBS Bank. There are Burger King, McDonald's, Lukang Town Tims Coffee, etc., and there is a family convenience store. After a traffic light, you will find the Aquarium and the Oriental Pearl Tower. You can buy sightseeing bus tickets under the Oriental Pearl Tower, bypass the overpass and walk a short distance to Zhengda, which feels more convenient. The subway entrance is about 700 meters away. In short, it is a relatively good experience.

I have stayed at most of the iconic hotels on the Bund in Lujiazui. This time I stayed at the Kempinski for two days and the experience was very poor. 1. The check-in efficiency is low, the service attitude at the front desk is very average, there are many people queuing up on site, and the order is chaotic. 2. The view of the elite business river view room is just that, it depends on the location of the hotel. 3. What I want to complain about the most is the hardware of the room: the two days I stayed in the room, the room was stuffy and hot, and the stuffy heat affected my sleep for two consecutive nights! ! ! The air conditioner couldn't cool down, and all the air coming out was warm air. I called maintenance personnel and they said they had turned off the warm air, but it still didn't work. They said it was because the outdoor temperature had warmed up, causing the temperature inside the hotel to rise, and Many guest rooms have reported this situation... I have communicated with the front desk and lobby manager, and the reply is that there is nothing they can do. It is full during the peak season and cannot change rooms. By the way, the soundproofing of hotel rooms is really second to none. It‚Äôs the worst soundproofing I‚Äôve ever stayed in in a hotel worth over 1,000 yuan.

I was given an afternoon tea as a gift when I finally left. The front desk said that it was not given. I was too lazy to care and just wanted to leave as soon as possible, so I never commented. I will never go to this hotel again, and the Kempinski brand was ruined in this way.

msg:I stayed at the Kempinski Hotel in Hangzhou for a few nights on a business trip and it was a good experience. So I stayed at the Kempinski Hotel in Shanghai when I came to Shanghai. Since the itinerary was undecided, I could only book the original room extension service for one day, but the original room was not allowed to be extended the next day. , you can extend your stay by going to the front desk, but the price is more than 500 yuan more than the original one. The extension service of the original room is firstly convenient for you if you want to make a fuss, and secondly, you have a good experience on the first night and the itinerary has not changed. It is convenient for you to continue staying without fussing. This problem As a consumer, you first contact Ctrip and then communicate with the hotel. However, Kempinski Hotel Shanghai has a tough attitude and directly reported to the front desk that the reservation was 1,900 yuan. Why don't you grab the money? In the end, the platform negotiation was more than 100 yuan more expensive than before. Now objectively speaking, the service of this hotel in Shanghai is average, the rooms are old, the wine bottles in the lounge are okay, and I don‚Äôt have time to experience other things. If I choose again, I will definitely choose the Shangri-La or other hotels next to it. s brand.

Facilities: The Philips hair dryer is rigidly connected to the socket, which is inconvenient to use.
Slippers are soft and warm, especially after a day of shopping.
The toiletries are specially designed for hotels, with a moderate fragrance and easy to rinse. Especially the soap, which is very distinctive and has its own anti-slip function. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. It is waiting for you to experience it.

Hygiene: If you bring a baby, you are used to sanitizing the bedding. I booked a twin bed. One of the beds has a short hair, and there are 2 holes in the quilt. It is broken, but it is still in use. Save, just one night, no trouble . I said it when I was thinking of checking out, but it turned out that I was asked to check out quickly. Well, let me make a suggestion. After all, it is a five-star hotel, and hygiene must be paid attention to.


Environment: It is considered the cheapest star-rated hotel along the Huangpu River, and the scenery is not bad. The constant-temperature soaking pool on the 30th floor, the view of the river at night is quite amazing.

The breakfast is rich, especially the coffee, which is no less than Star Papa. Remind everyone that you cannot wear hotel slippers when dining.


Service: We treat the customers staying in differently, and we are very warm to foreigners. Why üßê...hehe

Hygiene: The hygiene of Kempinski has always been very good, and the auntie cleaned it very well

Environment: The environment of Kempinski has always been my favorite, I love their home so much

Facilities: The facilities in the hotel room are pretty good, with big floor-to-ceiling windows, the view of the river is really beautiful. Every time you stay in an executive room, there are welcome fruits, but I feel that the welcome fruits are the same every time.

msg:I chose this hotel because I wanted to see the river view. It is also the hotel with the worst experience in this trip to Shanghai. Apart from the location advantage, there is no service at all. It took nearly ten minutes to check in. After us, we started to line up, because I came from Disney at night with a lot of luggage. The children were very tired and needed to be hugged. I asked the service staff in the lobby to help send the luggage to the room, but was rejected. I think any star hotel will send the luggage to the room if it needs it. After checking in, because there was no toothbrush for children, no one answered the calls to the front desk. If you order takeaway, you need to go downstairs to pick it up. In the end, I vomited a bit, because I personally didn‚Äôt read the reminder to wear room slippers and went to the restaurant. I was told not to enter. I went back to the room and changed my shoes before going to eat. However, during the meal, I saw a few foreign friends wearing room slippers. Being blocked is based on the fact that Chinese people don't embarrass Chinese people, so I didn't go to theory, but I really feel uncomfortable being treated differently.

 Checked in early on the first day of check-in. My family was sleeping in the afternoon. When I woke up, I found the door was open. Maybe it was opened by cleaning. It seems that there is no laundry service. I couldn‚Äôt find it in the service booklet. I suggest you refine the lighting.

The executive room I live in is above the 25th floor. The view is not as good as the river view rooms in Pudong Shangri-La, you need to turn your head to look. The disadvantage is that it is facing the HSBC Bank opposite, and the neon lights of the big logos of several banks affect sleep.
Everything else is fine.
1. The swimming pool is 25 meters long. It is not open air, but a constant temperature pool. It is not cold at all to swim in April. On the 30th floor.
2. The bar, the highest floor is the 30th floor. I saw that the elevator adverti*****t was 28 yuan and 58 yuan; after I went up, the price was 98 yuan, and I drank four times the cocktail. I like Pink Lady. There are many foreigners, and the resident singer sings Spanish, and the interaction between foreigners is very cheerful.
3. Service. I left my facial cleanser at the hotel. I promised to send it to me today, but I haven‚Äôt received it yet. I will wait a few more days. The service can at least be registered and give a good review.

At the same time, because of the good location, there were various groups checking in, which made it very messy. When I returned to the room, I found that there was no electricity. I called the front desk to change rooms. I had to wait for the electrician to come to the room to find out the reason. The adjusted rooms and customer service were far from the service standards of a five-star hotel; the Wi-Fi was broken and repairs were carried out, and it was still not repaired until check-out the next day. It is understandable that the hardware facilities have some problems due to their age, but I hope the service awareness needs to be strengthened.

They will not say hello to the guests when they see them, and they are not very polite. The staff went on a rampage during breakfast and the guests had to be careful to avoid it. This morning, one of the elevators broke down and occupied the first floor, causing other problems. The elevator couldn't press the button, so I came down and asked the staff but there was no response. Hope it can be improved.

Of course, the price of a river view room in this location is more than 1,000 points. The old internal facilities are almost in line with the price, and it is acceptable. The main advantage is the good location. The riverside pedestrian trail behind the building is great for taking a walk every day. The Oriental Pearl Tower and several museums are also within walking distance. The buffet seafood dinner in the hotel's element western restaurant is good value for money. There are many seafood and barbecues that leave a deep impression.
One of the things that bothers me the most is that there are no sofas, seats, etc. in the lobby that are not suitable for consumption and waiting (only a three-seater sofa is not enough). Sometimes if you come early and the room is not cleaned up or you have to wait for a while after checking out, and you don't want to go to the lobby bar, there is no place to sit.

On the night of check-in, the baby's feet were punctured by a rusty nail under the carpet at the door of the bathroom, bleeding and crying, because it was 10 o'clock in the evening, and the baby was tired from playing during the day, crying to sleep, so I resisted not looking for a hotel, and turned over the carpet during the day Really annoyed to see the row of nails below. At noon, I talked about this problem with the concierge staff who delivered the bandages. He came in and took a photo and told the front desk to give feedback, but no one contacted me to give me a response before checking out. When I checked out, I mentioned this problem to the front desk staff, and the manager only came over to greet me, and I didn't even bother to say anything and left. The baby cried many times overnight, and walked with his right foot limping during the day, and the front sole of his foot did not dare to touch the ground. This negative review is Ctrip's first negative review in many years. I hope the hotel will completely rectify this problem. My baby is the last victim!

The hotel was worrying in all aspects.

msg:This is the third stay, and the previous two were okay; but this third stay, I was very dissatisfied, and suddenly made me have great doubts and doubts about Kempinski's service and training, and I couldn't help but ask Write such a bad review.
The first point: I booked two rooms, and the first room was checked in at one o'clock in the afternoon. I waited in the lobby for an hour, queuing randomly, no one maintained order, and there was no service staff after asking twice Response, in this process, either arrange for a person to guide you, and check in according to the sequence; or you should say, sorry for the long wait, how long will it take, very, very dissatisfied! There are so few hotels in Lujiazui, and this is the only way to encounter such an uncomfortable situation.
The second point: Check-in said that there is no room. My friend who checked in first said that there will be no room until after four o'clock. I arrived 20 minutes later and said that there is a room. Are you waiting in the lobby without anyone to remind you? It's ridiculous. I don't know how the hotel staff communicate with the guest room at all. When I made the reservation, I clearly indicated when I will arrive. I don't know if the room is reserved, which will affect the follow-up time process.
The third point: I left my earphones in the hotel. I searched for them according to the icloud positioning and navigation, and found that the green light was flashing at the restaurant on the first floor. I happened to pass by and they were having a meeting, so I told the front desk to deal with it in order not to disturb the meeting; it took so long It has passed, and there is no feedback or situation to inform me; I am clearly lost in the room, but the earphones are located in the restaurant and they are online. I don‚Äôt know how the hotel handles this matter; but as a high-end hotel , I feel very unreasonable and dissatisfied!
To sum up, although these are small problems in the service, they have encountered a very big loophole in the training of personnel. If other people lose their watches or jewelry, how should they deal with it? There is also a check-in at the front desk. Do people wait in the lobby for a few hours without asking? I also need a reasonable explanation for the above problems, and I also hope that the hotel can improve the service.

She raised her chin and pointed me in the direction of her chin, but I witnessed the lobby work with my own eyes. The staff treated foreigners with a nod and a smile...except for the doorman (concierge) who was really nice! Helped me every step of the way ~ The bathroom mural is eerie and scary, with a pair of blue eyes facing the toilet... Going to the toilet at night is very disturbing... The bathroom does not have any sound insulation measures, it is just a glass door, with light transmitting from top to bottom, and a frosted film in the middle.

There are three water outlets in the shower room, which is quite special, but the sealing ***** is probably old, and the water overflows along the seams.
The price/performance ratio is very high, so the occupancy rate is high. Once you need to provide services, you will find that you can‚Äôt find anyone.

The river view room has a panoramic view, from morning glow to sunset, the beautiful scenery is unobstructed. The front desk has added an executive room, and breakfast and dinner are free, which saves you the trouble of finding a place to have dinner but not daring to eat too much.

The fly in the oin**ent is that the sockets in the hotel rooms are not reasonable enough. There is only one plug at the head of the bed in the twin room. I suggest that the hotel can improve it. In general Said that the old high-end hotels can still experience it, and the price is relatively moderate.

We arrived at 5:30, and we didn't check in until nearly 8:00. Although it is the Spring Festival, the hotel should arrange for additional manpower in advance! Secondly, I informed the front desk that there are children. The front desk said that children's toiletries have been prepared in the room, but in fact there is no preparation at all, and I have to take the initiative to call again to ask for it. I am really speechless!
For breakfast the next day, we went downstairs at nine o'clock, and there was a queue, and the queue was not usually long. This feeling is really bad, bad! After finally queuing up to go in, there are quite a lot of ingredients, but the taste is not flattering!
Although the hotel location is good, but I will not consider staying again, the price is sorry for its service!

Administrative courtesy is really unnecessary. Afternoon tea and happy hour are all ready-made cold food. The taste of coffee beans is not as good as the capsule coffee in the room. In short, it is very unappetizing.
In the afternoon, there was a problem with the facilities in the room. After communicating with the manager, we upgraded to the Diplomat Suite. Because the floor is low, we can't see the Pearl View. Generally speaking, Kempinski has aged seriously, and the angle of Jiangjing is also average. There should be no next time.

Because we arrived a little early, the hotel originally required us to pay an extra half-day fee. Later, the hotel enthusiastically provided us with an extra half-day check-in, and it was free. Big thumbs up, and we didn't have to wait in the lobby. It feels good to bring the children to Shanghai, which is half public and half private. The hotel's swimming pool, small hot springs and sauna are all very good.
On this special day of Chris**as, I brought my foreign friends and gave Chris**as gifts to the children, which deeply reminded my lover and children of the "New Year" in my hometown, where gifts are light on gifts but affection is heavy on affection.
If I had to find faults, I think the hotel's pillows are too high (I didn't ask the hotel if I could change the pillows), and the indoor temperature was a bit high (I personally prefer a slightly lower temperature). So I didn't sleep very well.

The room was pretty good. Bath supplies are also very good. Room service is good! The breakfast was better than expected. The only drawback was that the restaurant was a bit cold in the morning! The content of the sukiyaki buffet dinner is only a platter. The food is average, lower than expected! The grilled lamb skewers and grilled chicken wings are delicious. The old duck stewed in Jiangxi soup is so coquettish, oily and ineffective! The smoked salmon was too dry. The sushi is quite delicious! The cakes and desserts are amazing, every one is delicious!

msg:I was a little worried after seeing some bad reviews before, but after personal experience, I have greatly improved the service of the hotel. After the hotel learned that it was our wedding anniversary, it upgraded us for free, and arranged the room for us very thoughtfully, and gave us fruits, macarons and cakes. There is also spa surfing next to the swimming pool on the 30th floor of the hotel. I left the hairpin in the shower room when I was rinsing. When I asked casually the next morning, the staff actually kept it for me. The hotel's buffet dinner and breakfast are good, and the restaurant service staff will collect the plates in time. I feel that the staff at the front desk, guest room, restaurant, and the swimming pool and spa on the 30th floor are very professional and thoughtful.

msg:I came here by car. When I got to the ba*****t after arriving at the destination, the uncle at the concierge office in the ba*****t was very warm and thoughtful and told me which parking space to park near the lobby, which gave me my first impression of this hotel. It's very good. but! Later, a very unpleasant incident happened. I was completely disappointed and would not recommend anyone to live in. The concierge told me to leave within 15 minutes after entering the license plate number. I forgot something in the room. I asked my friend to go up and get it. I was afraid that I would drive the car out after 15 minutes. The weather in Shanghai is very cold at night, so I thought about parking the car at the gate. My friend can stop blowing it. I got in the car with a little wind, but the fat uncle at the concierge (should be from the Northeast, with a Northeast accent) just stopped at the gate and asked me what are you doing with a bad attitude? I said that I was waiting for someone here, I will come down immediately, and I will leave immediately. He directly said that you didn't see that this is a one-way street! I asked if you could speak well, and he gave me a few words in a sarcastic tone! Let me drive across to wait. First of all, I didn‚Äôt know that the entrance of the hotel is a one-way street. It‚Äôs my first time here. I‚Äôm not familiar with the road conditions. Secondly, I rolled down the window and explained to him. He said in a very aggressive tone, what are you doing? I‚Äôm not here to do it. Thief, I don't know what you mean by your high-ranking tone of commanding me? The attitudes of the two uncles are in stark contrast! I'm not here to spend money on suffering! I pay you to serve me in a completely equal transaction. I don't know where I messed with him. He is showing his face and acting weird. Originally, I didn't want to have any disputes with him. I didn't even ask his name, and it was not easy to go to work. But then when I went back to the hotel at night, he gave me a face and I was really speechless!

First of all, the toilet seat is crooked. Every time I go to the toilet, it will "click" and I almost think it will fall! Secondly, the sewer of a washbasin is not smooth, you have to unplug the plug to barely drain the water! The power socket is crooked, the bedside lamp is crooked, the quilt is dirty, the toilet smells bad, the sanitary bag is forgotten, and the mist of water seeps all over the floor. And the 23rd floor says it faces the river view, but people who can see the administrative building next to it, basically I dare not open the curtains, because I am afraid that what I see is not the river view, but other people drinking tea and watching the river! Here I must praise the cleaning lady on the 21st floor, who cleans it very clean every day, and has not leaked anything for a few days!

There were banana peels on the window sill. Then before going to bed at night, I found that the curtains were broken and the blackout curtains couldn't be closed at all. I opened it. I called the service desk, the switchboard, and the guest room, but they all couldn't get through. Ctrip customer service couldn't contact the hotel. I had no choice but to go down and find someone to repair it. There were still people checking in at the time, and then the repairman said that the curtain track was broken. I can only hang it up and can't open it anymore. All in all, it's a very bad experience, the worst I've ever stayed in. In short, if there is an emergency, I can't contact the hotel and get help.

The first city view room I stayed in, the bathroom I was given was dimly lit, and the bathroom was a bit gloomy. It can be seen from the facilities. Come out, this is a brand with historical precipitation. Finally, I thought about upgrading the room type. After seeing the river view, I felt a lot more happy. I could see the night view of the Huangpu River at night. The breakfast was quite satisfactory. The reception at the door was also very timely. . The most satisfying thing is to appreciate the Huangpu River. Although the facilities are a little old, they still have the charm. Very good, picture 6 is the first city view room. Nucleic acid can be done across the road opposite the hotel.

Even one of the female staff working in the lobby cafe spoke with a tone that taught customers. When the red-clothed female employee who looked like a manager also asked about the location of the elevator, she raised her arm carelessly and pointed to the elevator.

msg:The location is excellent, the view is good, the room is spacious and comfortable, the room service is fast, the toothbrush is of high quality, the slippers are of different sizes, friendly to big feet, and the door card design is unique.
Disadvantages 1. The phone at the head of the bed was broken. I contacted the hotel by phone. The front desk said that it was arranged to be repaired, but there was no engineering team to repair it until I left the store.
2. No physical door lock (see Figure 1)
3. The bathtub and toilet room are really too dark, super super dark! We thought that the light in the bathtub was off, but later found that there was no light at all, only a light on the left side of the toilet... It's really scary to take a bath in such a dark place, and I don't dare to go to the toilet alone at nightüòÇüòÇ
4. The bedding is not comfortable, the mattress is not comfortable, and the pillow is not comfortable. Later, I changed to a buckwheat pillow, which is also super short.
5. I asked the waiter to change the sheets the next day, but I found out that they were not replaced, many folds were not like freshly washed, and the location of the dirt was the same as the previous day.

msg:It's disappointing. I have stayed at Kempinski in Sanya before, and the impression is quite good. The location of Shanghai is not very good, so I have never considered it. Due to the relationship between the epidemic, Puxiang hesitated between Puxiang and Kaibin. After finding out that Puxiang‚Äôs Spring Festival service thunderstorms, they finally decided to stay in Kaibin during the summer vacation. I ordered a package with a buffet dinner, but I still added money at the front desk to upgrade to an executive room. It can be said that your executive floor service has saved my review of your hotel. Noisy lobby, noisy cafeteria, terrible dinner menu, chefs who serve German pork knuckle but don't know moral sauerkraut, thin Buddha jumps over the wall (I'm too embarrassed to call that stuff Buddha jumps over the wall). Fortunately, there is also an executive lounge that provides quiet, comfortable, qualified meals and drinks, and can still replenish meals at 8 o'clock in the evening. The next day's breakfast at the restaurant on the first floor was still quite substandard, even if it was required by ordinary five-star standards. The service in the executive lounge saved a bit, but the quality service in the lounge was still lost to the terrible kitchen. The fact that a 5 star hotel doesn't even have smoked salmon on the menu is beyond me. Asparagus and mushrooms are the side dishes of omelette, but the kitchen actually said no, is this a western kitchen? ? Fortunately, the American foreman in the lounge went to inquire after learning about it, and the kitchen only provided it again. It can only be said that the performance of the catering service completely dragged the front desk, guest rooms, recreation, especially the executive lounge service. Won't be going a second time.

We communicated several times and booked a higher floor for us. On the day of check-in, Mr. Qiu at the front desk was very dedicated.

The Chinese restaurant set menu is very delicate and delicious, there are no people, it is quiet and comfortable.
Western restaurants are crowded, and there are long queues for breakfast in the morning or buffet in the evening.
There was also a long queue for check-in on Saturday, and the room promised at 3 o'clock was not received until 5:30 in the afternoon. Fortunately, the front desk kept comforting, sent coffee and drinks from the lobby bar, and agreed to delay check-out until 2 o'clock. By the way, the latte in the lobby bar is really delicious. I don't like coffee, but I also like it.
The diplomat suite is more than 100 square meters. It is quite large but the facilities are old. The river view is very good. It is 180 degrees. The carpet is gray and old. . There is a jacuzzi, and the bath is very comfortable, but the wall of the bathtub is too high and it feels unsafe to step in and out.
I was paralyzed on the sofa at night, turned off the lights, and enjoyed the night view of the North Bund riverside. The fabric sofa is in some places where people often sit, and it feels that it has collapsed and soft, and the sitting feeling is not as good as that of a chair.
Kempinski is really good to eat, both Chinese and Western food are delicious, it is more cost-effective to stay in ordinary rooms, and the price of expensive rooms is cost-effective, because there is no preferential trea**ent, check in, have a long queue for breakfast, and soft drinks in suites Pay extra
To sum up, the hotel service and river view, the food is still very good, and I will come to eat and stay next time~~

The front desk shirked that the Ctrip confirmation slip could not be received, and asked the guests to wait in the lobby for 30 minutes. I am really sorry for the service of the five-star hotel. I am very speechless. I can't do it without complaining. Check in, the experience is too bad to spend so much money! The room service phone didn't work. . . In short, it is not recommended

The bed is not bad, the TV doesn't have HD channels, bad reviews (I really didn't expect the TV in a five-star hotel to be so bad and not smart, it doesn't even have high-definition channels)
The hotel swimming pool is not big, the scenery is good, there are many people during the day, it is recommended to go at night, there are no people, there is a hot pool in the locker room, it is not bad to have a bubble.

After the buffet dinner in the evening, downstairs is the Binjiang Runway, riding a small yellow car to the Yangpu Bridge, blowing the river wind, very comfortable. The hotel buffet is very good, Wellington steak and delicious Buddha jumps over the wall, skewers, which are excellent in the five-star hotel buffet. The hotel swimming pool on the 30th floor overlooks Lujiazui Financial Street and the night view of Huangpu River, which is very good! The best choice to cool off in summer and walk your baby!

msg:Traveling to Shanghai during the epidemic is already a luxury, so finding a place in Shanghai where you can relax and swim to escape the heat can be considered a kind of relaxation. I saw Kempinski‚Äôs introduction in Ctrip‚Äôs Top 10 Luxury Hotels Column in Shanghai. I called first to learn about the epidemic check-in policy, and I mistakenly dialed the phone number of the hotel‚Äôs Element Restaurant. The man who answered the phone was very enthusiastic and took the initiative to ask gave me my number and told me to transfer the phone number to the hotel room reservations and call me again. After a while, I received a call from Miss Xu, who was booked by the customer service. She introduced the hotel's epidemic prevention policy and some matters of check-in in detail, and gave professional advice. On the day of check-in, Xiao Zhou at the front desk saw the old man we were traveling with and asked us what special requirements we had. With his enthusiastic help, the old man was able to stay in the invincible river view room on the high floor and spent a wonderful night. In fact, during the stay, from the welcome brother at the door to the waiter in the restaurant, the active and enthusiastic work attitude left a deep impression on us. Others such as meals, swimming pools, etc. are satisfactory: the crayfish buffet dinner is rich in variety, pure in taste, replenished in time, and foreigners in charge of the restaurant are constantly inspecting and checking, and the same is true for breakfast. The swimming pool is on the highest 30th floor of the hotel, with a glass skylight with full sky view, the Oriental Pearl is close at hand, and the beautiful scenery of the Pujiang River is right under your eyes, which is very comfortable. Finally, a tip: compare the price recommended in the WeChat public account XX Hotel XX Life, Ctrip is more than 100 cheaper, this money can go to the front desk to upgrade the river view room, just add 120 less than the city view room. Much better.

msg:A common problem with hotels in Lujiazui is that the river view is used as a selling point to hide the fact that the facilities are outdated. There was nowhere to go during the summer vacation, so I visited the Lujiazui Gaoxing Hotel. The air conditioner in the public area of Kempinski was seriously insufficient and the sound was very loud, and the sound insulation of the room was not very good.
I really don't know how to charge more than 200 for these categories, which is much worse than Jin Mao and Park Hyatt. What made me even more unpleasant was the service staff. The breakfast restaurant told me that I could not wear hotel slippers, but when I went downstairs again after changing my shoes, two guests in the same elevator who were wearing slippers entered without obstruction. Let‚Äôs not talk about five or six people wearing slippers in the restaurant. Is this policy of co-authoring only for me? What's even more funny is that the registrar at the door came to me halfway to confirm the room number and number of people for a second time. Is it because I don't look like I can afford breakfast?
The front desk of the swimming pool is also very weird. When I entered the door, I was told to register. After registering, it said that the locker was gone, and the other two guests who had not yet registered took the last one...
I wanted to pass the weekend, but now I can only resolutely check out and change to Wenhua

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Ms. Huang for her warm reception, and she also upgraded the administrative river view suite.
For the well-known reasons, I haven't been out for a long time, and I happened to have a dinner near Lujiazui on the weekend, so I ordered Kempinski.
The old-fashioned five-star hotel, so the experience is also very in line with the old + five-star characteristics.

Location: Not far from the Oriental Pearl Tower, it is very convenient if you come to play near Lujiazui. But it's not very good. This time I stayed on the 25th floor. The river view is acceptable, but the angle is not suitable for viewing the Bund. The Oriental Pearl is just half blocked by the building next to it.
Services: Upgrade the administrative river view suite, the lady at the front desk guides you into the elevator, delivers welcome fruit, and two ladies deliver the afternoon snack to the room.
Facilities: The overall hardware support is still very good, maybe because the hotel is relatively old, some small places have some problems. For example, there are few plugs, and several plugs seem to be broken. There is no response when inserted, only the plugs in the room are useful. The bathtub didn't leak, so the bath water was left in the bathtub overnight.

The experience during the epidemic is probably the same. Since the executive lounge is not open, it is not very recommended to book an executive room type, a non-executive room type, and the price/performance ratio is still very good.

msg:The hotel is located next to the DBS Bank Building, very close to Ocean World, and it takes ten minutes to reach the most prosperous area of Lujiazui. If the room provided by the hotel is suitable, the Huangpu River view is unobstructed, the night view is quite good, and Binjiang Avenue is also a good place to stroll.

Check in the hotel on Sunday to upgrade the executive room, the room service is responsive, the room is cleaned twice a day, and the supplies are replenished in time. Check in with a padded jacket, Kraise and Heyley at the front desk gave extra chocolate, four kinds of fruits and balloons, my daughter likes it very much.

It would be better if the hotel breakfast could be more varied. Kempinski feels at home.

They upgraded the room for our seniors free of charge, which satisfies our desire to view the scenery. Thank you, Mr. Qiu! The rooms are clean and hygienic, with complete facilities and very comfortable living, especially the swimming pool on the 30th floor. The water quality is crystal clear. The Oriental Pearl Tower can be seen in the rest area of the swimming pool. The swimming pool environment is very good. Worthy of praise!

msg:A very pleasant and intimate three days and two nights. Because of the epidemic, we stayed in Shanghai for the Chinese New Year with children and booked the hotel one month in advance. Because there were few double beds on the executive floor, we booked a river view room for 2 nights. Because of the New Year's Eve, there was a large passenger flow when checking in on the New Year's Eve. More procedures were required for epidemic prevention and control, and the waiting time for the entire check-in process was prolonged. After waiting for 45 minutes, considering the reason of my old mother's leg disability, I took the initiative to contact the waiter in red in the lobby, and got immediate attention and response. Take the initiative to lead us to the 28th floor executive floor for check-in. The old mother sat and waited throughout the whole process, which was very considerate. When arranging the room, I got the considerate care of Lily and EVA on the executive floor. In the case of a large passenger flow, the family was still arranged in a room on a floor facing the river view, so that the children and the elderly could stay in the room after check-in. Very happy.
During the breakfast period on the first day of the new year, although there was a large flow of passengers and the queue for more than 40 minutes, the restaurant manager's proactive and unabashed work attitude made people feel the excellent corporate management of Kempinski. After upgrading the courtesy of the executive floor, the waiters on the executive floor tried their best to make up for our negligent service when we encountered a large passenger flow, and were particularly satisfied and understood as a guest.
The large passenger flow during the Chinese New Year is an emergency, but in the face of emergencies, Kempinski's front-line employees and management showed a good attitude and first-time handling plan, which made people feel that Germany was established in 1897. The corporate management and brand vision of the brand. Special thanks to Lily and Eva on the executive floor for giving the elderly and children a full range of life care during their stay. From you, I really feel Kempinski's excellent service and high efficiency.
Will come to the store again, thank you! A very pleasant stay.

Yesterday, I had to wait an hour at the front desk to check in at Jinmao. Today, I came to Kempinski to receive such a courtesy. It was a great experience.
The river view is also great, because it is close to the Huangpu River, so the scenery is good. Although Jinmao has a high floor, there is a platform and railings outside, and the floor-to-ceiling windows of Kempinski are comfortable and clean!
Before living in Shangri-La, the facilities are a bit old, and the window is very small. Jin Mao, Shangri-La, Kempinski, the price is almost the same, in contrast, Kempinski wins!
The TV supports the hdmi interface of the switch. I went to the Zhengda Plaza for lunch and played in the secret room for dinner. Unfortunately, due to the time conflict, I did not try the buffet.

It‚Äôs really interesting to find that the hotel now uses soldiers to represent Germany and white rabbit toffee to represent Shanghai, China! The son spent a few minutes at the front desk and ate his first white rabbit haha. I also stole two spares. I made an appoin**ent in advance for the buffet dinner in the set menu. But the young lady at the front desk reminded me thoughtfully. The buffet was good, the son applauded, and the wife took the son very tired. Everyone knows the baby about 2 years old. I took a leisurely meal and had a good meal. Zhoupu lamb is superb, but sheepskin is absolutely perfect. Lamb liver and tripe are also good haha. Breakfast was also good the next day. Very good anniversary. The wife asked his son if he would come next time, and the son said he would come again haha! The last two photos are a souvenir of the wedding 2 years ago haha.

Get up! Answer the phone üòµ‚Äçüí´. These still happen when the screenshots of nucleic acid have been taken to the hotel every day. The other is the room service. This is the first time I encountered whether the room has been cleaned or not. I have to ring the doorbell to confirm it by asking the guests. I ask every day, and after questioning, they reply to me that they are all like this. If I went to open the door a little late, I might encounter a direct swipe card at any time. Thinking about it would be really scary if I was in the shower or in the bathroom, so in the next few days, I almost did not disturb the whole time. In short, this hotel lacks in protecting the rest of the guests. It is more casual and does not care about the feelings of the guests. In addition, the breakfast is also a big bug. It can only be said that the dishes and tastes are very ordinary. Should not choose to stay again.

The choice, especially the Miss Betty lv at the front desk I met this time, I want to give a big praise. The river view is very beautiful, whether it is the blue sky and white clouds seen when the curtains are opened in the morning, or the lights on the opposite side of the river reflecting the water at night, it is refreshing. Finally, I will praise the newly improved noodles and rice noodles for breakfast. The soup is very good, and you can also season and match it yourself, which is very delicious. Next time I come to Shanghai, I will still choose here.

You can see the Bund 4-piece set not far away. The parking space here should be very tight, right? ! I didn't dare to drive here that day... During the epidemic, I could not leave Shanghai for nearly 2 years. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in Magic City. In contrast, I feel that the facilities of this hotel are of the central level...the rooms are not too big...the bathrooms are also relatively compact...there is no smart toilet...Of course, I booked a city-view room. However, standing in the room can still see the river view of Lujiazui Financial City and nearby parts. it is good! Hygiene Good plan! Very clean! it is good! Service should be good! Maybe it is because there are too many people on the festival and they didn't notice it carefully... When checking out, there are a lot of people waiting to check out at the front desk, and there are waiters who collect the room card and do the check out directly. This is the same as Shimao Shenkeng Hotel. it is good! Breakfast is on the first floor. There are a lot of people, you have to wait in line to enter the restaurant...The variety of breakfast dishes is good [strong]

One was the reception staff at the entrance of the swimming pool. It feels like a smirk and a professional smirk. A girl can make do with it. The service quality of a male waiter in the morning of October 7 needs to be improved. Since it is a supporting service of the hotel, it should not be perfunctory. Swimming pool reception There is free water at the entrance of the desk. Is there a cup? I didn‚Äôt answer me. I took a cup out of the drawer and gave it to me. I accidentally got the water on the table when I poured water on myself. I was also embarrassed. Hurry up and say embarrassed. Then, as a staff member, should you take the initiative to take things?

The staff who checked in on the first floor asked us if we were an executive room, and then guided us to the 28th floor executive floor to check in. It was worthwhile to avoid the trouble of queuing. great. But what happened after check-in on the executive floor was not so pleasant. First of all, it was said that two children‚Äôs supplies would be delivered after the meeting. After returning to the room, I waited for half an hour and did not deliver it. I called once to remind us. I went out and returned to the room at night, but it was still not delivered. The children couldn‚Äôt wash and change slippers. When I called the front desk, I was already quite angry. Another 15 minutes passed without delivery. Then we went directly to the manager on duty. After complaining about this, I sent toothbrushes, toothpaste, shower gel and slippers, and the children‚Äôs bathrobes were sent on request. I didn‚Äôt see the Stitch dolls that other guests said. The welcome fruit plate was delivered after repeated requests. Because the day arrived late, it was already more than 4 o'clock, and the afternoon tea time for the administrative courtesy was only at 4:30. At that time, the waiter said that the room rate was only for our adults to have the administrative courtesy, and it was a promotion that we would spend more than 200 to buy two children. Administrative courtesy. I said that I couldn't eat this afternoon tea. She took the initiative to help us extend the administrative courtesy to the next day. We still thought this arrangement was considerate. The administrative courtesy is that you can enjoy breakfast, afternoon tea and a small buffet in the evening. According to our understanding, the small buffet in the evening is postponed to the next day. Therefore, we did not use this small buffet dinner on the night of our stay. But at 4 pm the next day we learned that only the afternoon tea was postponed, and there was no dinner. As a result, there was nothing to eat in the afternoon tea, and dinner was useless, and it cost more than 200 for nothing. This kind of experience is really bad.
The geographical environment of the hotel still has nothing to say. We are an executive river view room, with a panoramic view of the river. The Oriental Pearl Tower and the aquarium are also within easy reach. Sanitation is also okay. It is the previous service experience that greatly affected the mood.

msg:Change the hotel in disappoin**ent. Comment on Kempinski, disappointed, a terrible stay. First of all, I would like to thank the girl wearing glasses for the warm reception when I checked in. This is the only point of satisfaction with the hotel.
1. After check-in, I took a rest in the living room in the afternoon. I was suddenly woken up. I heard the slamming sound of the wall in the living room. I opened the door and saw the next room cleaned. I closed the cabinet door and drawer under the TV. Are you afraid of breaking things in the hotel? I'm a guest and I don't know how to close the door.
2. After a while, Procter & Gamble started talking in the stairwell, alas... it can't be changed. Same as staying in March, every time! Order marking is also useless.
3. I need a memory pillow at night. From about 22:30 until 23:43, there are 7 service calls, of which 5 times I don‚Äôt answer, the mobile phone calls the hotel once, and the waitress surnamed Xu at the front desk is angry at me. Happy! What hotel is there is a big sister in the room at night, very busy, too busy! You wait another 15 minutes, you wait another 20 minutes, the point is that I waited for more than an hour, and I didn't see the pillow! The intermediate communication process has been reflected with the lobby manager. I hope that the lobby manager will ask the waiter surnamed Xu to ask the hotel to run errands and deliver pillows, and communicate with the management. That is really a "five-star" trea**ent! Figure 1. Figure 2 is what Kempinski thinks is the "memory pillow", the brackets ~ the pillow has goose down coming out, and the goose down is on the coffee table in the lobby. Figure 3 shows the Lujiazui Xiyue Memory Pillow. Figure 4.5 and 6 show memory pillows in Europe, Switzerland, and Spain. Memory, memory, what kind of memory pillow does the waiter surnamed Kempinski Xu look like? Goose down soft pillow? Popular science knowledge: Memory pillow is a pillow made of slow-resilient materials. Its function is not to increase people's memory, but because pillows that are often used form the inherent shape of the human head and neck. Memory pillows are mostly slow rebound pillows.
3. The sanitation of the back kitchen of the 28th floor restaurant is impressive. The placemats on the windowsill and the boxes on the ground are messy. The corners are placed on the ground. The pastry of the back kitchen is bare on the plate without covering.
The service call was unanswered for a long time, no matter whether it was in the afternoon, at night, or during the day. The accommodation environment is confused! Guests are not noisy! Noisy cleaning! The cognition of basic bedding is unheard of! The accommodation environment cannot be quiet, and basic bedding cannot be provided! Food can't be hygienic! The service can't meet the basic standards! Except for disappoin**ent! disappoin**ent! Still disappointed! The hotel hardware is outdated, so don't be too old!

The overall sanitation facilities are good, but the shower in the shower room feels that the water is too loose, and it is not the most comfortable to wash.
The buffet dinner in the restaurant on the first floor is great, and there are discounts when you pay with Dianping. The breakfast variety is also very rich, and the pan-fried buns and chicken porridge taste good. There are no small wontons, what a pity!

Now to see whether a hotel is good or not, we first look at the number of employees. After all, the labor cost of a hotel is the bulk of it.
The security guards at the door, the doorman, the etiquette lady in red in the lobby, especially the receptionist and the aunts in the room were very warm and friendly, and the children also gave small gifts.
The breakfast room is good and has a lot of stuff. It is very cost-effective in the Lujiazui area. To be honest, that's the case with MO and Regent, location is still incomparable.

The facilities in the room are really old, especially the TV. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you can‚Äôt watch playback on demand. The picture quality is really powerless... I don‚Äôt know if TVs in higher-end rooms are like this. The Wi-Fi signal is not very good....If you go after 10 o'clock for breakfast, you can't make up if something is missing. You have to wait in line for the fried eggs, so there is no need to increase it. Even though the dinner is a crayfish buffet, the crayfish has only three flavors: spicy, salt and pepper, and drunk... and it's not big, so it's very slow to replenish drunkenness. For sashimi, there is no Arctic shellfish...it needs to be improved.

At night there will be waiters to make night beds. The service is very good. A small tip: The toilet in the bathroom seems to have lost the standard of a five-star hotel, it would be better if you can update it

Generally speaking, those who have requirements for hardware are definitely not too satisfied. It can meet the needs of room size and river view. The key is the same location.

msg:Check in on February 4th, check out near noon on February 5th. He admitted that he had left out the children's Disney white tiger doll due to insufficient cleaning, which was placed on the pillow at the time. On the evening of the 5th, the child remembered and called the front desk of the hotel at 9:00 am on the 6th. The answer was that there were a lot of check-outs in the morning, so he left a message to the housekeeping depar**ent, and will reply in time when there is any news. So I continued to wait, and the front desk of the hotel called back at 15:33 in the afternoon, just four words: not found. Would like to state here: Of course I am not satisfied with this answer. Although this doll is not valuable, it is about the size of the palm of an adult male. It is placed on the pillow in the room. I believe that the room attendant will definitely be able to see it when cleaning the room. It is not a necklace. Or earrings, which are relatively small, I believe the waiter may have been wrapped in sheets and discarded due to negligence or blindness. I remembered that I also missed a piece of clothing when I was on a business trip in Zhejiang last year. After checking out, the hotel staff immediately called to ask if there was any missing clothing. Secondly, when I called the front desk, I repeated the situation. The front desk did not ask my room number immediately, but just asked your surname and left your mobile phone number, and it was just a matter of a few words. Maybe this doll is not very important to us adults, but it is relatively important to children. The hotel may shirk on the grounds that the hotel is busy during the Chinese New Year, but as a 5-star hotel with such a long history in Shanghai, shouldn't there be a regular process when tidying up the rooms? Shouldn't any size missing items be sorted into one uniform place? Or leave it to the room attendant to take care of it? This has to make people feel the belly of a gentleman with the heart of a villain, and have to doubt the integrity of the staff.

The Lujiazui subway station on Line 2 is two intersections away. The river view room has a beautiful view. Every night, the child goes to the 30th floor pool to swim, facing the Oriental Pearl and Huangpu River. The hotel breakfast is also good, there are many kinds of variety, and the child pays half price to eat is also worth it. It is Kempinski, and will choose here next time you come to Shanghai! After walking around, I found that hundreds of millions of Tangchen products are nearby.

Although the river view of the room is not very positive, it is still very beautiful. The hotel‚Äôs air conditioning, bedding, and hygiene are very good. The breakfast is quite satisfactory and delicious, but I personally feel that there is room for improvement in the ingredients. If you are a friend who is visiting from other places and want to live in Lujiazui, the price ratio is very high here, so I recommend it.

msg:It is believed that the breakfast restaurant on the 30th floor serves important customers. But the area is small, there are few things, and the management is chaotic. Now it is digital management, which can determine the breakfast configuration according to the number of high-end guests, and use other restaurants as a maneuver to let the guests wait for their seats. The phenomenon of misplacement, wrong meal, and insufficient meal equipment is very incompatible with five-star hotels. It greatly affects the experience of staying in the hotel. It is a very bad experience for guests who are willing to pay for river view rooms and suites. Hope to improve in the future

The hotel is more business-oriented and it is indeed more suitable for business people, but there are also many families with children. Even the cleaning aunts are warm and polite, and the children are willing to talk a little more. The location of the hotel is good. The overall price-performance ratio is very conscientious compared to the surroundings, but there is nothing delicious around, and the hotel‚Äôs meals are not used to it. Chaos.

Service: Take the elderly and children during the peak of summer vacation. There is a lot of luggage. The car parked at the entrance of the hotel and someone took the initiative to help take the luggage. Although the front desk is busy and need to line up, you can understand that business is better this season. I want to see a better view of the river. I asked the front desk, gave a part of the discount and added money to upgrade to the 29th floor viewing room, which is relatively satisfactory. The room was cleaned and the children received a gift bag, which contained a children‚Äôs bathing suit and a doll of an interstellar baby. The capsule taste of the coffee machine inside is also very good!
Meals: The cafeteria is not too big. I ate breakfast and lunch buffet three times in three days. I think the taste is okay but I can't give full marks. The service is very good. The waiters are very enthusiastic and are very active to change plates. Collect plates. I compared several hotels with similar locations. The meals for young children are charged. Kempinski is completely free for those under 120. I am very satisfied!
In addition, parking is very convenient! There are parking lots on the ground and underground, and you can park for free if you provide the room number and information.
Children's feelings: Children like toys, the feeling of the room, and the 30-story swimming pool. I will bring my family next time!

The hotel does not take the initiative to provide small items such as toothbrushes and combs, but guests can ask for them, and the attendant can provide them. The guest room is arranged on the 10th floor, and the entrance looks very beautiful. The opposite bank faces the landmark building Music Gate on the North Bund of Binjiang in Hongkou District. The room is very clean and there are four free bottles of mineral water every day. The bathroom has a double basin, the shower room and the bathroom are separated from dry and wet, the brand of toiletries is the hotel‚Äôs own logo, the hotel‚Äôs toothbrush is too hard, it is recommended to bring your own, the hair dryer is fixed, girls with long hair may use it You may feel that the wind is too small. There are electrical sockets in the bathroom, 110 volts, flat plugs, and 240 volts, but pay attention to round plugs. The water temperature in the shower room is just right, it is constant temperature, the water flow is large, and it is very comfortable. The toilet is Kohler, a little old-fashioned, without a washlet. If there are children passing by or someone talking in the aisle outside the door, the guests inside the door will be noisy, and the sound insulation of the door is not very good.
The room cleaning staff is very good. When you come back, the room has been cleaned up. The slippers are neatly placed next to the carpet in the room. The scattered photos and books on my desk are also properly placed on the leather board. , The cosmetics are also in place, and the added toiletries are also in place. It feels good to come back.
We stayed for two days, and the breakfast for two days will be adjusted. There are both Chinese and Western styles, and the main Chinese styles are more diverse. There is no need to wait for the poached egg, it's warm, very good. It is recommended not to go to dinner after nine o'clock, you must wait in line outside. The waiter in the restaurant is a super express courier to clean up the table, and a brand new table can be cleaned up soon.
The waiter who stored the suitcases looked indifferent and not very enthusiastic.
In short, the overall score is still acceptable. In the Lujiazui business district, Kempinski's price/performance ratio is still high, and overall satisfaction.

The afternoon tea in the executive lounge is a variety of cakes and sandwiches, as well as fruits and juices, which is so-so. Happy hour can be full, but there are not many choices. The hotel service is good, the attitude of the staff I contacted is very good, and the price is good.
