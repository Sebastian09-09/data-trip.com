msg:Complaint Regarding My Stay at Mandarin Oriental Hotel Sanya

I am writing to express my deep disappointment and dissatisfaction with my recent stay at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Sanya. As a loyal customer and someone who had been looking forward to this post-Covid family trip, I must say that my experience fell far below the expectations I had for your esteemed establishment. The series of incidents I encountered during my stay has left a lasting negative impression.

Firstly, upon checking into my room, I discovered that the bath salt had been used, indicating a lack of attention to detail in the room's preparation. This immediately made me question the overall cleanliness and hygiene standards of the hotel.

Secondly, I was appalled when my mother was almost hit by a golf cart while we were moving around in the hotel. The incident left us shaken and concerned for our safety. It is absolutely unacceptable that such a dangerous situation could occur within the hotel grounds, which should be a secure and protected environment for guests.

Furthermore, I must address the lack of professionalism displayed by the manager on duty who approached me to apologize for the used bath salt. Not only did the manager fail to address the issue promptly, but they also referred to me by the wrong name, which demonstrated a disregard for customer service and basic attentiveness. This level of carelessness only served to exacerbate my disappointment.

Even worse, when I reported my grievances of the bath salt to the hotel staff, they sent me two unwrapped cakes that appeared to be in a sorry state. The cakes were clearly an afterthought and lacked the quality and presentation one would expect from a renowned hotel such as Mandarin Oriental. This gesture not only failed to rectify the previous issues but also displayed a lack of consideration and effort.

Additionally, the behavior of the concierge staff was highly unprofessional. Throughout my stay, they consistently neglected to greet to guests and instead indulged in playing with their phones. This type of behavior creates an unwelcoming and impersonal atmosphere, which is a stark contrast to the exceptional service one would expect from your establishment.

Lastly, the incompetence of the butler assigned to my room was evident in their inability to navigate the hotel mini program on WeChat. Despite my repeated requests, the butler continuously sent me the wrong links, resulting in my inability to order food through the designated platform. Also, I asked the butler to book your spa hotel for me on my arrival in your hotel but did not get any response during my 3 days stay. This level of ineptitude further exemplifies the lack of proper training provided to the staff members.

My family and I had been eagerly anticipating this trip, hoping to create cherished memories. Instead, our experience at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Sanya was marred by a string of disappointments and subpar service. The incidents I have outlined make me question the internal staff training and overall commitment to providing a superior guest experience.

I trust that as a reputable establishment, Mandarin Oriental Hotel Sanya will take immediate action to address these issues. I kindly request a thorough investigation into the matters raised and appropriate measures be implemented to ensure such incidents do not recur. Furthermore, I expect a sincere apology and a gesture of goodwill to compensate for the inconvenience and disappointment caused during my stay.

Our 管家, Wendy, was very helpful in helping us book a snorkeling time (with a coach who can take underwater pictures of you feeding fish using a GoPro) and the seafood buffet on the beach, which had unlimited Australian lobster, steak, and other seafood, and needs prior reservations. Overall, fantastic resort that's worth the price.

The hotel is quite big, but the infrastructure is really well done, so even if the occupancy rate is high, you don't feel bothered by the crowd. All the staff was going above and beyond the deliver a flawless service (rare in Sanya!). The food is really good, probably the best breakfast buffet we have tried in Sanya if we compare it to other hotels. The Chinese restaurant, Sunset Bar, and the seaside restaurant Fresh were equally great. Fresh is a bit overpriced for what it is (tomato + mozzarella 180RMB when it is a small portion is really overpriced). The rooms are a bit old but very clean and big. Probably our favourite hotel in Sanya for now.

msg:When I first came to Sanya, I chose Mandarin Oriental, and it was a good choice. It was a good start, which made me feel good about Sanya and wanted to come to Mandarin Oriental again. I didn't know much about it at first, and I was a little disappointed when I saw that the bay was small, but I was slapped in the face immediately, because although it was small, it was exquisite, just as the Internet said, it was full of essences, with clear water and fine sand, coconut trees and shadows, no filters, and it was especially beautiful under the sun.
I lived in the Xishuiwentao room, which had an exclusive small pool in the yard, and the noodle bar was very close to the water swing. Mia, the little housekeeper, was very friendly and polite. When she learned that we were on a honeymoon trip, rose cakes and love cards were all prepared in place, and the air conditioner in the room was also disinfected in advance. As soon as I entered the door, it was fragrant and cool. When I opened the curtains, the shadows of the trees were dancing, and facing the sea, the spring flowers were blooming, and my whole body and mind were particularly relaxed. Little Mia knew that I had a cold and I prepared ginger soup. It was so considerate. The room was comfortable, and the pillows and quilts were soft and skin-friendly. I completely stretched out and fell into a deep sleep. I have certain requirements for sleep quality, and I got it easily here. I was so happy and energetic to enjoy the hotel's special seafood buffet, which was also surprisingly good, with unlimited lobster, foie gras, beef, lamb, durian, pineapple, etc. Food, beautiful scenery, and lover by my side 👫 Really feel warm and romantic ♪(^∇^*)~~ Having said so much, I still have to praise the staff in the end. They are all in good spirits, polite, friendly and enthusiastic. They will take the initiative to ask the tenants walking on the road, which is a plus. At the same time, I was impressed by the lady who received me at the front desk with a high ponytail, beautiful makeup, and a powerful and magnetic voice. I didn't see the work card but was very confident, friendly and polite. There was also a chef with a short hair and sunny foie gras stall at the seafood dinner. He had a good understanding of food. The fried foie gras was cooked to the right temperature and was fragrant and soft. I don't like foie gras, but I ate 4 pieces in a panic. He also took the initiative to share with the chef next door how to check the heat. It's good to love sharing. Of course, there is also Mia, the customer service who did not show up throughout the whole process. She is also polite and friendly, and has a good sense of propriety. She always thinks of my needs when I am about to find her and arranges them in advance. Thank you very much 🙏 The overall feeling is that a good hotel meets good employees. The staff are very passionate about life and have an attitude, so they unconsciously show confidence at work, and are especially friendly and polite. For this spirit, I will still visit Mandarin again. It turns out that there is a reason why my family always comes. It is really good.

Mia is very considerate and greets you in the morning and evening. All needs are coordinated and met. Welcome fruits and snacks are also arranged😋 
Sunset seafood buffet barbecue I thought it was worth paying for the beautiful scenery! Unexpectedly, the barbecue is very fragrant, the grilled shrimp sauce, small blue dragon, and oysters are very suitable for my appetite, and the durian is also as much as you want. The young man in the restaurant is very attentive in such a hot day.
Breakfast ends at 11:00, a proper vacation rhythm! I drank 3 cups of freshly squeezed juice in a row, and it was very clear after drinking it in the morning!

Next time I will bring my parents to experience it together.

Environment: The environment is a feeling when it is cloudy and raining heavily. The sea water is really beautiful when the weather is good.
Service: I didn't expect the service of this old hotel to be very good, and I saw a lot of complaints that the service of this hotel is not very good, but after a real experience, after staying in the Capella behind, I think Mandarin Oriental has the best service. Butler Angel added WeChat in advance and met all my requirements. Bring me many bottles of hot milk and mineral water with a baby. I installed a bed fence and encountered the rainy season in Sanya. I stayed in the Sanya Mandarin Oriental Hotel, which is full of Southeast Asian style. The guest relations officer Angel's service is very considerate and responsive. The room facilities are quite complete. The only drawback is that the baby stepped on a small glass in the room. Although it was nothing, I think the hotel still needs to pay more attention to hygiene. My husband and I spent a few days in the Mandarin and had a very comfortable vacation. We will stay here again next time.

msg:The Mandarin Hotel in the off-season was a really great experience. Before I checked in, the housekeeper Kennys contacted me in advance and helped me upgrade the room type for free. I also got a squirrel doll when I checked in. The hotel's public area is really a scene at every step, perfect for taking photos. The shuttle bus is very convenient, the swimming pool is beautiful and clean, the room facilities are a bit old, but it's acceptable. Overall, it was a great experience.

msg:I stayed here last time I came to Sanya, and I chose to go here again for the May Day holiday. There are too many hotels in Sanya, but the Mandarin Oriental is unforgettable. Although it is in the noisy Dadonghai area, you will feel quiet and relaxed as soon as you come in. The toiletries in the hotel are from Oulong, with a light and high-end taste. There are also many pillows to choose from. The scenery is very good, and each villa has a car to pick up. The breakfast is very good and I ate delicious lobster wontons. Of course, I have to give special praise to my housekeeper, Ms. Jessica. The lady is nice and beautiful. She prepared the room for me in advance and picked us up as soon as I arrived at the store. She took very good care of our family throughout the whole process. Whether it is snorkeling arrangements or preparing rooms for children, they have given us a lot of help. Come again next time on vacation!

msg:This is my second time staying at Mandarin Oriental. Although there are many different reviews, I still like Mandarin Oriental the most among all the hotels I have stayed in Sanya. It feels like a holiday and is very quiet. The service staff are also very friendly. The only difference is that the breakfast variety is a little less. Our housekeeper Rita is very good at guest relations. She sends messages every day to ask if there is anything she needs. She helps to arrange all the requests. I was very lucky these few days. The weather is very good. Coral Bay is a jelly sea that is not inferior to Southeast Asia. I will choose Mandarin Oriental again when I come to Sanya in the future.

msg:I booked a sea view room at Guanhaixuan and arranged a room on the 5th and 6th floors with the housekeeper in advance. The room balcony has a wide view, and the pool garden and the sea in the distance are in full view. The room is well maintained overall, but there is dust on the headboard. Because it was already late when I saw it, I was too lazy to toss it and crawled on the bed to wipe the places I could reach with a wet tissue. The hotel's tropical garden is beautiful, the sea in Coral Bay is also beautiful, the breakfast quality is good, and the Chinese restaurant food tastes good. The service is responsive (I don't ask for much), but there is no initiative and no surprise. Overall it's pretty good.

The resort hotel is very large and there is a shuttle bus when going out. Desserts, fruits, and handwritten greeting cards were given. The scenery is so good that you can lie down comfortably anywhere. The room is also very large. The garden view room has a quiet corner. When you open the door, there are green plants, which makes you feel comfortable. I will definitely stay here for a few days in the future.

msg:Environment: Super beautiful! The garden is beautiful! The sea view is also beautiful! It's really a scene at every step, and you can't finish taking pictures! Full of vacation feeling! The hotel is close to the city (convenient and delicious), but it enjoys the quietness of Coral Bay and its own private beach. You can have a glass sea without going out! You won't get tired of playing in the hotel for two or three days! 
Facilities: Although the facilities are not very new and have some years, the hotel decoration itself uses very good solid wood, which is well maintained, and everything is very textured! Very comfortable! Very clean! The room is a Dyson hair dryer! I love their mattress! You can fall asleep immediately when you lie on it! 
Hygiene: Cleaned very cleanly! No need to worry at all! There is no moldy, rusty, dirty corners in the room! The toiletries are from the Olong Grapefruit Paradise series, which is very refreshing in summer! I love the swimming pool! The water is clear, and it is really comfortable to soak in the afternoon to watch the sunset! The hotel also has mosquito repellent, sunscreen, water, etc. Don't worry! 
Service: The service is really great! Super five-star wow! Our housekeeper sister Angel is really super good! The check-in time and any needs will be confirmed one day in advance! Very considerate, it really makes people look forward to it before they arrive! When we arrived at the hotel, she greeted us in the lobby! Her smile is super sweet! She greets us every day to see if there is anything we need to add! She will try her best to apply for some surprise benefits for us! The hotel shuttle bus responds very quickly and the driver is a great driver!
I have to praise the Earl Travel Photography Experience that comes with the hotel package! Go for it! Otherwise, it will really waste the beauty of the hotel! Now that we are here! How can you know how beautiful the photographer can take your photo if you don’t try it! I don’t mean to advertise, but I am really satisfied!

msg:I chose two hotels for this trip to Sanya, one is Mandarin Oriental and the other is Park Hyatt. I stayed at Mandarin Oriental first. Before I came, I read the mixed reviews. In fact, staying in a hotel mainly depends on personal preference. You may feel differently if you focus on different things. My feeling is that if you want to go on vacation and relax, this hotel must be a good choice. The swimming pool is large and can be open until 10 pm. The barbecue buffet restaurant by the sea is both good-looking and tastes good. Although it is the last two days of May Day, the service is very thoughtful. The service of the housekeeper Rita must be praised. She is responsive and proactive in asking about the needs of customers. Today is my first day at Park Hyatt. To be honest, everyone is cold and the housekeeper rarely sends a message. It feels like they are all clichés. Another highlight is the Platinum Travel Photography in the hotel. The photographers are very good and can amuse children. This hotel is especially suitable for taking pictures. Don't miss it. It's also good to leave a souvenir. Of course, the aging facilities that everyone is concerned about also exist, but it does not affect the mood of traveling. I pay more attention to the comfort of the service and environment. In short, this trip is a correct choice, and I will choose here next time

There were quite a lot of guests during the May Day holiday, but the hotel was big enough and the villa area was very quiet. Except for breakfast, when there were more people, it was just right at other times, and the public swimming pool was also very fun.

My parents and children were very satisfied, and when they left, they said they wanted to stay for another week.

Special thanks to our housekeeper team: Jason, Eric, Lee, who were very busy during the holidays, but the response speed was still very fast; the restaurant staff were also very friendly, in short, I was very satisfied~ I will come again next time if I have the chance~

msg:This is my first time in Sanya, and I don't have much experience to compare. Just from the experience of this stay, I strongly recommend that you should experience Mandarin Oriental when you come to Sanya. I considered choosing a room for a long time before. Because I was traveling with my parents and children, I finally chose the Sea Breeze Pavilion Family Room. I was also worried that the coconut trees would block the view of the sea, so I asked the housekeeper Rena to help reserve a room with a good view. Sure enough, when we entered the 8301 room where we stayed, the whole Phoenix Garden was in front of the balcony, and the sea view was also beautiful. It was really beautiful. I think this room can also be called an Internet celebrity, and I want to stay here next time. I stayed for three days and two nights during the May Day holiday, and the whole experience was very good. I especially recommend Earl Travel Photography. Although it costs a lot of money, the effect is really good. The housekeeper Rena and the front desk staff are very good and responsive. Although it was expensive during the May Day holiday, the buffet dinner on the beach was 1188 per person, but I was still very happy to book the most beachfront position (actually the second row position is also very good). The overall experience is great, and I think I will stay here next time. Maybe I prefer this kind of decoration. The room doesn't feel old at all, and I like everything.

The outdoor area is more fancy and lively, and the combination is not inconsistent. The service is very good, with few restrictions. It is quite comfortable to stay here. If you want to take a bath, you will be provided with a bathtub cover. The barbecue at the beach is not only delicious, but also very nice. It is also nice to go to the sunset bar at night to have a drink and listen to the violin. The holiday a**osphere is great~

However, the room originally booked has a terrace garden, but the front desk said that it had rained and was not cleaned, so it was changed to a balcony room, which is not very good!! The buffet is very good, but the price is relatively expensive, about 1200 per child, and there is no charge for children. The beach is very clean, the hotel environment is very good, there are not many children's playgrounds, and if it rains, there are fewer things to play. The hotel has electric cars for pick-up and minibar is also provided free of charge. It's a pity that the travel photography was not arranged. The hygiene is very clean. I will come again next time!

msg:A wonderful trip always leaves people wanting more. This time I came to Sanya for a beach vacation, and I chose the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, wanting to enjoy a luxurious, private and quiet vacation time. Here, I deeply experienced what a real holiday paradise is.
First of all, the Mandarin Oriental Hotel is located in the Coral Bay Military Management Area, which is quiet, private and isolated from the world. Even in the bustling city of Sanya, it seems to be in a paradise.
Secondly, the hotel is extremely private, with only a small number of guest rooms, so that each guest has sufficient private space. Every plant, tree, stone and scene in the hotel has been carefully designed, making people feel the elegance and elegance of the East.
Finally, I must mention the hotel's catering services. The restaurant of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel offers a variety of cuisines, from international buffets to authentic oriental cuisine, and every dish is memorable.
In short, I highly recommend that you come to Sanya for a beach vacation and choose the Mandarin Oriental Hotel to spend a luxurious, private and unforgettable vacation here.

The sea water is very clear and the infinity pool is also very interesting. This time I still stayed in a sea view room with a wide view. It happened to be a sunny day, and the sunset view was very spectacular. The various restaurants in the hotel are also very flavorful. I like the noodle bar, Chinese restaurant and sunset bar the most. Uu who loves Western food can also go to Haijiaoxuan, which has a very good experience. In addition, I would like to thank the very considerate Mandarin housekeeper Mia, who arranged the birthday setting very carefully, sent a small cake, and arranged a late check-out room very considerately. There are greetings every day, and they will also take the initiative to ask if the room daily necessities need to be replenished. They are responsive to requests, and reservations, taxi calls and other service needs can be efficiently responded to and met. In short, this Mandarin Oriental can be said to be one of the best resort hotels in Sanya. In addition, it is not far from the city, ensuring privacy and experience without losing convenience. It is highly recommended!

msg:A great experience! It is worthy of being called Mandarin Oriental. I have seen some bad reviews in the comments before, but we didn't encounter them at all. The room is clean. Although the facilities are not the latest, for example, there is no smart toilet, but for a hotel that has been open for more than ten years, I don't think I can be picky, and the service is awesome👍This is the key to the hotel! From entering the hotel on Friday to leaving on Sunday afternoon, almost three days, all the staff I met were polite and considerate.
On the first night, we checked in at the hotel and asked the hotel staff to send the luggage to the room. We went directly to the western restaurant for dinner. After dinner, we walked back to the room. Because we didn't know where the room was exactly, there happened to be two young ladies (who should be off work, driving a small electric car). When they heard us asking for directions, one of them came down immediately and took us to the side of the building before leaving. We didn't even ask her name. In addition, there is the housekeeper Grace, who has been paying attention to our entire itinerary and providing us with meticulous help👍There are also Shi Huan and Wang Qiuhui from the western restaurant. The dinner was very beautiful and enjoyable. The spa is also the most recommended in Mandarin 👍 and Kiki at the check-out front desk made us feel valued, thank you 🙏
Of course, there are also regrets. We were unable to go snorkeling for two consecutive days due to the weather. My little baby said he wanted to come back to make up for this regret! 😊

msg:This is the third hotel in this trip to Sanya, and it lived up to expectations. The public area of ​​the hotel is really beautiful, with many places that can be filmed. The whole environment exudes a very leisurely a**osphere, with a strong sense of vacation. Many masters in the hotel (feeling like the engineering depar**ent) will greet you when they pass by on electric vehicles. As long as the shuttle bus driver is empty and has no tasks, he will take the initiative to stop and ask you where you are going, and whether he is willing to take you there. During the peak period of car use, even when there are guests and empty seats on the bus, he will stop and ask you where you are going. As long as it is on the way, he will invite you to get on the bus. The guest relations depar**ent will call one day in advance to ask if you will check out the next day. If you go to the airport, they will take the initiative to delay the check-out according to the flight time. Check out in the afternoon, and there is a housekeeper knocking on the door at noon to ask if you need to add drinking water. Not to mention the housekeeper Jessica who added WeChat before check-in. You can WeChat her for any questions during the stay, and she will reply and arrange quickly. When turning down the bed on the first day, she even came to the room to tell the housekeeper of the housekeeping depar**ent about our preferences. And there are a lot of employees in the whole hotel. It feels that everyone I meet puts the needs of the guests first, and there is never any intention of shirking. The quality of breakfast is also very good. In short, I am very satisfied with my stay. The only downside is that the hotel's restaurant seems a bit expensive. There are a few children's facilities, but this should be related to the hotel's positioning.

msg:This time, I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel with my parents and children for three nights. The experience was great! When I checked in, the housekeeper Ellie helped arrange two opposite-door Guanhaixuan (king/twin rooms) in the same building. The door inside the room was opened to connect the rooms, so I could visit each other happily at any time. Before checking in, I was prepared that the internal facilities of the room might be old. After checking in, I felt that the room was well maintained. The view on the sixth floor of Guanhaixuan was excellent, and the internal facilities of the room did not feel old at all. The Platinum follow-up shoot that the hotel cooperated with was also very powerful. The photographer was very good at guiding and took a lot of beautiful photos. The hotel recreation center will provide some activities for children. Thanks to Ellie for helping to make an appoin**ent. The children didn't want to leave after playing for more than two hours. The hotel is indeed a beautiful scene with every step. There are new surprises every time you walk. The children like the frangipani by the swimming pool and the huge jackfruit tree. Walking and swimming in the hotel every day, the feeling of vacation is really great.
This trip to Mandarin Oriental, the whole family is super satisfied, thanks to the housekeeper Ellie for her attentive reception, come again next time

msg:The most impressive thing about Mandarin Oriental Hotel is the hotel service! Butler Nick added WeChat one day in advance. Since there were only king-size rooms in the Sea Breeze Pavilion, he was very considerate to help add a sofa bed, and my parents slept very well. The room type also met the needs of being close to the sea with few obstructions as much as possible. Every staff member of the hotel will greet you with a smile no matter where you go, which is really heartwarming. If you have any needs, they will meet you as soon as possible. The hotel is indeed a scene at every step, with a sense of design, and a full Southeast Asian holiday style.

msg:I have always had a very good impression of Mandarin Oriental. This time I went to Sanya and chose Mandarin Oriental. The hotel's privacy is very good. Moreover, every step in the hotel is really beautiful. Many of the stone carvings are very unique. I can't help but take out my mobile phone to take pictures. The staff are well-trained, professional, quick to respond, and not overly enthusiastic. Lily, who is in charge of hotel guest relations, contacted me in advance and asked about my check-in time and other details. She responded very quickly and attentively.
The hotel's electric car pick-up and drop-off was also very fast, and I was very satisfied with my stay. The only thing to note is that there is no fine beach here in Coral Bay. If you want to take your baby to play in the sand at the hotel, be careful. During the Spring Festival, I saw that the hotel launched many parent-child activities. There was always music and bubbles in the artificial swimming pool, and many children had a lot of fun there.
The meals are also very good and the variety is very rich, including barbecue, hot pot, Chinese food and Western food. If you want to make a reservation, you can contact the staff in charge of hotel guest relations via WeChat.

The environment of the hotel is full of resort a**osphere, and every step of the way is really surprising! The best thing is that on the second day of our stay, we met a couple having a lawn wedding, which was really romantic! By the way, you must go to the spa when you come to Mandarin. The spa has a beautiful and Mayan-style area. Each room is a small single-family villa with a courtyard. Don’t miss it! The massage techniques are also very good! Sister Amber made it for me. She kept giving me biscuits. She was very kind and made me so comfortable that I fell asleep... Recommended! This visit to Mandarin Oriental left me with wonderful memories and surprises! I will come again next time!

Thanks to the housekeeper Rita for the service and help during the stay. This time we arranged room 3506, which can see both the garden and the sea, and the view is great. Rita also thoughtfully sent us anniversary cakes and roses for arrangement. The battery car service is also very fast. There is also a shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, and the transportation is also very convenient. The hotel staff will greet us warmly when they meet on the road~
The hotel's breakfast is also delicious. I especially like lobster wontons and special beef noodles. I have to show off one night every day~
This time I also snorkeled in the hotel. Although there were fewer fish, it was very convenient and happy, and the sea water was also very clear~
The hotel also thoughtfully sent a travel photography service. I was smart and made an appoin**ent for evening photography a week in advance. The sunset that day was also awesome. Thanks to Teacher Sun for taking beautiful photos of us, and Tingting for helping to select the photos. In addition, we added several photos, leaving super beautiful memories~

We are also equipped with a dedicated butler Mia. The service is great👍🏻You can contact us at any time to help with things. We also gave you a fruit plate. It is a great experience and very considerate❤️
The breakfast is very good. There are many varieties and the taste is good. The hotel has a separate beach, but the sand feels very heavy. It is all coral particles. The sand is not fine. It is indeed a Coral Bay~
The only thing I don't like is that the room is too old and has an old-fashioned feel. Middle-aged and elderly people like it very much, but young people are a bit incompetent...⋯
In addition, the prices of the meals in the hotel and restaurants are on the high side, but the taste is not very good. It only has a sense of a**osphere. The photos are nice and the scenery is nice, but it is difficult to satisfy the appetite.

msg:I bring my kids to Hainan every two months. This is my first time staying at Mandarin Oriental, because after living in Sanya, I love the facilities in Dadonghai Business District. I choose Mandarin Oriental because I trust this brand, but overall I am not so satisfied. I only have the Garden Room when I book it temporarily. The room facilities are old, which is understandable, but I hope they will be well maintained. I have eaten breakfast and dinner and I am satisfied with the breakfast. There is also a boy in red clothes for breakfast. I don't know if he just came and his clothes are different from other staff. I have to praise him. I met him in two days and he took the initiative to clean up for the guests in time. For the dinner buffet, I had to find a seat by myself. Highlight: Durian Xiaoqinglong. 798 is a good deal for my family. The price was not calculated for the child, so he found a seat by himself. I hope that next time I come, there will be no such situation. The child runs in the swimming pool during the day and the playground in the Big Pineapple Shopping District at night. The beach of Wenhua is still very dirty. I hope it can be cleaned in time. There are cigarette butts, paper towels and other garbage. It is not the quality of Wenhua I expected. Those welcome necklaces and fruits, I didn’t get them when I booked them at the original price on Ctrip. I asked for them actively because I was not satisfied after I moved in. So let it be. If you love Wenhua, you will stay there anyway, and you don’t read these reviews.

Suggestion: Take the initiative to prepare toilet water for guests. Being bitten by mosquitoes is really uncomfortable. The reception efficiency at the front desk is relatively low.

I stay in beautiful hotels in Sanya every year. My favorite is Mo.
I hope to come back after the renovation to experience a better environment and service

msg:The goodness of Mandarin Oriental must be savored after you check in. You will live in a leisurely, beautiful and comfortable living a**osphere, and you will feel comfortable being nourished by the sea at close range every day. After staying here for a week, I have fallen deeply in love with it~

At first, you will feel that it is a little different from other hotels. The facilities are relatively old and Chinese-style. The wooden furniture requires strength to move. You need to look for things many times to find them, which is consistent with daily habits. Not quite the same.

However, when I was lying in the yard and watching the coconut trees swaying, I saw the sea in front of me, and everything else was just floating clouds. The distance between this room and the sea is very suitable. It will not be disturbed by the waves, it will not be too humid, and you can feel the sea up close. The site selection and design of Xishui Wentao Pavilion is really amazing! Suitable for everyone who loves the sea~

I have tried every dining place, and the scenery is beautiful. The sunset at the barbecue buffet is the most panoramic. The overall design style of Western food will be more stylish than the barbecue place. The noodle bar is the place where I eat the most. It’s less crowded, quieter and more leisurely. It’s the best place to watch the changing weather and sailing on the sea.

As for the food itself, the service of Western food is very good, but the food is average. One is that I don't like the taste, and the ingredients are not particularly outstanding. The BBQ is the most popular, really rich and worth trying. The noodle bar has the best taste. The noodles in the afternoon are delicious and the small hot pot in the evening is also very special.

There is no problem with the service of the big hotel, but when there are too many people, it is inevitable that the phone calls will not be connected and will be slower. The service provided by the front desk manager Alex was very good. At that time, the butler assigned to me did not respond, so he became my personal butler. He responded to all my requests and was very professional. Thank you very much.

The happiest thing was the free follow-up photo shoot with Platinum. I met a super professional and super cute photographer. He was very professional, interesting, and very good at guiding me. He knew how to explore my beauty, help me relax, and interact with the beautiful scenery, which made me Even those who have difficulty taking photos have taken beautiful photos~ I forgot to ask his name, he is a senior photographer~

The Phoenix tree is a very beautiful existence. If you have time, you must go to the grassland to experience this beautiful existence~

All in all, it was a great trip~

Private beach, avoiding the embarrassment of crowds. In addition, the room is very private, unlike other resort hotels where there are many rooms on the first floor. The single room in a single building makes the resort a**osphere really straight forward. The hotel service is very good. I would like to specifically mention the front desk manager. His service is very empathetic, warm and friendly. Helped us properly solve the room replacement problem. It simply filled the room with a sense of staying experience. This is a very outstanding leadership team. I was very nervous before coming because I read online that the hotel was old. When I checked in, I found that although it can't be said to be new, it is overall very clean and has an old-fashioned luxury feel full of Southeast Asian style. From now on, whenever you come to Sanya, you will stay at Wenhua!

msg:The overall environment of the hotel is very good, the public area is beautiful and easy to visit, and there is also a special children's place for children in the hotel. The style is similar to the Bulgari Hotel in Bali. Prices are okay in off-season. Love the hotel's infinity heated swimming pool and sea swing! There are many coral stones and shells on the beach, which children like very much. Especially the housekeeper Rita's service is very good! He is also very enthusiastic and considerate, and will respond to and solve any problems in a timely manner. The hotel's breakfast is also rich. There is my favorite fruit Danish, and lobster wontons. We went to eat before the plane took off at 7 o'clock in the morning. Overall, the stay experience was very good.

The hotel is so lavish. I can’t finish the water provided. The water is bottled Evian.
Every detail of the garden is full of scenery. It only lasts for three days, and it’s a great place to film.
There are many little surprises on the beach and the water is crystal clear.

The beach is still so good, heated swimming pool and sunset dinner
Everything is still so good

Fortunately, the style itself is this Southeast Asian style. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were easy to use, although they were not unique. Building, but the rooms next door do not interfere with each other, privacy is good, overall satisfied, I will come again next time, looking forward to the effect of the new decoration, by the way, one-third of the beach in Coral Bay is okay, don't think about picking up shells, almost No, it's close to the city, but there are a lot of cars. The temperature of the heated swimming pool is not high. It's okay to play at noon. The Chinese restaurant tastes good and the ingredients are fresh.

Thank you to Brea, our housekeeper, who was very attentive and considerate. She added me on WeChat early in the morning to inquire about my needs. Finally, I wanted a little squirrel to take back to my child. The store was out of stock, so she offered to send me one of her own. It was very heartwarming. .
The buffet dinner was also booked by Brea for me. In fact, even if I am not in the first row, it does not affect the experience. I can’t use group buying coupons before the Chinese New Year, but my husband and I both think it is worth it. We all enjoyed the little green dragon, durian and ice cream. . Thank you Cultural Oriental for giving us a great experience on this Wangzai trip. I would like to take my family here again next time.

It is also suitable for couples to walk hand in hand on the beach and take photos at the check-in spots. The water is clearer than other bays, and you can see the sunset.
Swimming pool: The heated swimming pool faces the sea, so don’t be in a bad mood!
Breakfast: The wontons and noodle stalls are okay, the pastries in the pastry area are average, the coffee machine is not ground coffee from a commercial coffee machine, and the taste is always bad. There are plenty of sliced ​​fruits and several kinds of freshly squeezed fruit juices. I hope there can be more breakfast varieties.
Restaurant: Picture 9-11 is the Waterside Restaurant. There are tables on the beach facing the sea at night. It is very romantic and requires reservation in advance. It is a buffet seafood barbecue.

Special mention is given to the beautiful housekeeper Mia, who made a meticulous decoration for my birthday and anniversary: ​​the room is full of details, and the beauty of various decorations is very online! In addition, during the stay, Mia was completely responsive to all requests, communicated appropriately and generously, and had an excellent sense of proportion. It made people feel like spring breeze and put them in a good mood every day ~

Let's talk about the rooms. I read reviews before and found that many people felt that the facilities were a bit old. After checking in, I didn't feel that at all. Maybe this kind of log-style room with slight traces of use makes it look more natural. Compared with those splendid glossy lines and marble decorations, wood-veneer furniture makes people feel more friendly and relaxed, and has a comfortable feeling of blending into the mountains and sea. In addition, the view in the room is unobstructed, the light is very good, the hygiene standards are high, the shower gel has a sweet grapefruit scent, and the power of the hair dryer is friendly to girls with long hair. These are all plus points.

In short, I have been to many foreign islands and resorts. In comparison, Mandarin Oriental Sanya is really cost-effective in terms of quality and experience. It is a conscientious hotel suitable for leisure vacations and self-cultivation. I will come back in the future.

The room facilities are a bit old, but the cleanliness is good. During the few days I stayed, I changed to three room types. One is a camping room. There is a grass field outside the room with a small tent and camping seats. The children like it very much, and the room is not bad. The low-floor room in the middle is particularly bad. The air is not circulated. The musty smell of the whole room is stuffy in the room. The temperature of the room cannot be raised even if the air conditioner is turned on. I would like to praise the housekeeper Amy. She added WeChat before checking in and followed up throughout the process. Any problems were communicated and solved in a timely manner. The room problem was also solved in time the next day and the room was changed!
Checking in at the end of February is the peak season in Sanya. There are really too many people, so the overall service is a bit inadequate and can only be considered okay in all aspects! I checked in at four o'clock in the afternoon and met a very nice guy at the front desk, but I didn't remember his name. He was the thinner guy!

Our room is 3205. The courtyard room has a small yard where you can drink coffee and dry clothes. It is very quiet. The bathroom is very spacious, the bathtub + shower room, two sinks and toilets. There is a separate room. It is not very far to go to the breakfast restaurant, the seaside heated swimming pool, and the hotel is not far away. It is also very easy to pick up a car. Conveniently, every staff member is very friendly. The heated swimming pool is just below the hotel lobby. Free bath towels and swimming rings are available for rent.
The butler Grace's service was warm and thoughtful, and she answered all our questions. She gave us a latex pillow (the pillows are optional, including cassia seed, latex pillow, memory pillow, etc.!) and lent us her sea-going tools! Thanks to her, the children had a lot of fun. They found a lot of starfish and hermit crabs. There were a lot of broken corals and shells on the beach. When we were there, it was sunny every day. The sea view was super beautiful and there were many tropical fish in the East China Sea. We didn’t have enough time this time. We must find a housekeeper next time. It’s fun to book water sports
The rooms at Oriental Mandarin are really spacious and tidy, and they are cleaned every day. Drinks, water, slippers, toothbrushes, etc. are all changed every day. Children will be provided with child care, bathrobes, and slippers on the first day of their stay. If you talk to the front desk, you can Install anti-fall fence
When he saw the notebook I brought, he even prepared a screen cleaning cloth for me. Perfect detail!

The lobsters were not deliberately grilled slowly. But it lacks the services that a luxury hotel should have, such as the service level of roadside restaurants, expressionless faces and inconsistent clothing. When leaving after eating, several people at the restaurant front desk chatted around each other, and every guest was indifferent. . When I read about the hotel, netizens said it was old. I thought it was okay as long as it was clean and tidy and the scenery was pleasant. . But the old one is a bit too old😅There are many damages in the room, the water in the bathtub cannot be turned on, and the air conditioner is slow to cool down at this temperature. The water surface of the swimming pool outside the room was not clean, and the fallen leaves and ****s on the steps were all dry. It can be imagined that it had not been cleaned for a long time, and there were damaged areas everywhere in the hotel that had not been repaired. . I forgot the honeymoon decorations arranged in advance when I checked in. I hurriedly made them up after dinner. The service from the housekeeper Rita was good, and the supervisor also called to apologize. This hotel at this price point needs too many improvements. . It’s okay to take photos and eat, but not recommended for staying here

The travel photography package comes with 5 free electronic photos and a 15-second short video: you can only select photos offline, without considering the guest's itinerary. Although I went because of bj, I had no choice but to give up, probably because I wanted to promote it. I can't make up the time, so I still spend money to make an appoin**ent for a photo shoot, hehe.

msg:A satisfactory hotel experience. The housekeeper July was very considerate all the way. From before check-in to check-in to departure to the airport, she would greet you attentively. Any questions raised would be handled quickly and effectively. During my stay, every staff member was very kind and the service was very good. There are beautiful views at every step in the hotel, far away from the hustle and bustle. The travel photographers and photo retouchers are extremely professional and responsible. If I come to Sanya again in the future, I will still choose here.

msg:Facilities: What I was most worried about before coming here was the old building that was complained about online. After checking in, I found it completely acceptable. It has a very traditional American design. There is no USB charging port, but there are enough plugs in the room. The floor and furniture can be seen to be old, but they are not dirty, and the bathroom facilities are relatively new.

Environment: The scenery is excellent, the beach is fine, and you can catch the sea in the reef area. During the non-peak season, you need to reserve a good seat at the seaside restaurant two days in advance, so remember this.


Service: The room service is timely and basically available on call; the shuttle bus has many online slots, which is okay in non-peak seasons. You have to wait for a long time for breakfast, and it is within 5 minutes at other times. Butler Chen was very attentive in his service. He prepared the room in advance, helped with reservations at the restaurant, followed up daily, and was very attentive in delivering snacks to the children.

Travel photography is more expensive than other hotels, and the lighting for the free photos is very poor and hard to choose from, but the photographer is really good, and there are all kinds of free clothes to choose from, so those who are willing to spend money can take a good photo.

Breakfast tastes much better than Shangri-La MGM. Freshly squeezed juice replaces water every morning. I love it.

msg:The worst MO I have ever stayed in. As a fan of Shang Fan Hui, this hotel is really disappointing. I fell in love with Mandarin Oriental because I once stayed at Fan Hotel in Wangfujing, Beijing. If my first time staying at Fan Hotel was in Sanya, I believe I won't have a good impression of this brand. It doesn't matter that the rooms are old. After all, it has been open for a long time. The public areas are very beautifully designed. However, the quality of the hotel does not match the Mandarin Oriental. It looks like a cheap guest house. The room does not even have the most basic capsule coffee machine that should be equipped in a luxury hotel, and the minibar is extremely basic. The hardware is not updated, the facilities are not maintained, and the hotel is dilapidated everywhere. This may not be the case if the decoration is old but the hardware is regularly updated and maintained on a small scale. The hair dryer equipped in the room is very cheap. It feels like an old hair dryer from more than ten years ago. The mattress is on the hard side. I think the most speechless thing is that as the world's top luxury hotel brand, it actually made a funny operation of limited two bottles of Evian with unlimited Nongfu Spring, which really lowers the level of the fan. If you're afraid of high costs, you won't be given high-end mineral water, and you might as well just use normal mineral water as standard. The standard drinking water in other Mandarin Oriental hotels in China that I have stayed at is either one pure glass bottle mineral water from New Zealand, or high-end glass bottle mineral water such as NORDAQ. Moreover, the drinking water provided by most luxury hotels in China is a series of high-quality mineral water such as Tibet Glacier 5100 and Bama Platinum Spring. In short, the standard drinking water in luxury hotels is not lower than the standard of mineral water. The configuration of this hotel feels out of touch with the standards of Mandarin Oriental and even luxury hotels. This is the first time I have seen a luxury hotel that does not come with mineral water as standard in the rooms. I didn't seem to find room service in the room. I don't know if I didn't see it or if it wasn't there at all. If not, it was really bad. The room also felt dirty everywhere, and there wasn't even a mouthwash in the supplies. The toiletries used are French Olon, which is favored by Mandarin Oriental and Four Seasons. There is still a hint of Mandarin Oriental. The hotel service is also average. Guests were not asked if they wanted coffee or tea during breakfast. This is the most basic service standard for a luxury hotel breakfast, and the variety is not very rich. The beach buffet in the evening costs 798 per person. I feel that the service and quality are not worth the price. The turndown service was also seriously out of line with Mandarin Oriental standards. They didn't know how to hang or fold the clothes. They didn't know how to place a cup on the bedside. There were no slippers next to them. They just spread sheets and left the dirty places. Still dirty. But I have to say that the guy who picked me up by the hotel's battery car was pretty nice, warm and thoughtful. The housekeeper is also good. All in all, the hardware, equipment maintenance, service, configuration, and quality of this hotel have nothing to do with the words Mandarin Oriental. It is a miracle that such a bad hotel has not been withdrawn. If I hadn’t found the hotel, the fan-shaped logo at the door, and the #I am a fan slogan in the work area on the official website of Shang Fan Hui, I would have thought that I was visiting a Four Points by Sheraton hotel that has been open for a very long time. This hotel feels like listing Wyndham Howard Johnson is not too much... It is indeed a bit excessive to compare it with the Mandarin Oriental Wangfujing in Beijing, the Asia-Pacific flagship store, but at least it cannot be inferior to the standard of a luxury hotel. The price of the Mandarin Oriental in Sanya is 2,000+, which is in no way comparable to the Mandarin Oriental in Guangzhou, where the usual house price is less than 2,000!

msg:It was my eighth vacation in Sanya that I met the Mandarin Oriental. Although I was late for a long time, I was worried that her old age would be a bit redundant. From the moment I met Mia, the perfect experience also began. In addition to being arranged in the middle to view the sea, the room Location, Mia also helped us arrange an a**ospheric welcome, red roses and light lilies gave us a homey feel. The scenery of the hotel is so beautiful, with the sea and sky as the background. You can see each scene at every step. The heated swimming pool is super large. Swimming in winter feels great. I like to blow the sea breeze and listen to the sound of the waves under the sunset. The hotel is full of resort style and I can't bear to leave. Finally, I would like to thank Mia for her enthusiasm and thoughtfulness, which took the entire experience to a new level. Breakfast is also suitable for our taste. The wontons are freshly wrapped and not frozen, and the fried dough sticks are also soft and freshly fried.

The hotel is at the end of the road, with greenery, mountain views, and beaches. When I open the balcony door in the morning, the sea view is right in front of me, and the chirping of various birds makes my holiday mood take off.
Most of the rooms are built against the mountains and are connected by electric buses. Except for check-in and check-out, no transportation vehicles are used. It is very pleasant to walk slowly on the mountain paths and the beach.
The hotel arranges exclusive butlers for guests. The girl we contacted is called Jingran Kiki. If you need anything, just send a voice message on WeChat and arrange services immediately.
Every staff member in the hotel greets you warmly and thoughtfully and takes the initiative to guide you. Super comfortable vacation experience

msg:I booked this old Mandarin Oriental hotel with my childhood dream in mind.
The housekeeper Amy added WeChat in advance to communicate, and reserved a perfect location in Building 8 for us. She also upgraded to Guanhaixuan with a large balcony. She gave us the little squirrel and necklace that we cherished so much. She asked us what we needed every day and pressed I bought a buckwheat shell pillow according to my needs. I was very enthusiastic and truly managed the butler service.
The rooms and common areas are great. After passing a section of seaside road, we entered the private space of Yiwanyi Hotel. The front desk staff greeted us warmly, and the shuttle bus man introduced us to the distribution of the entire park in detail. The room is in the Southeast Asian solid wood style, and all the copper metal accessories show a calm a**osphere. The 1.35-meter wide bed is very comfortable to sleep on. The bed is decorated with flowers with welcome words, and the Evian mineral water in the glass bottle is more classy. Outside the window are large lawns, banana trees, the sea and distant mountains. The multiple heated swimming pools are beautiful, and the staff changes towels promptly and provides free swimming rings. Haijiaoxuan, the sea swing and the English letters on the grass are beautiful places to take photos. It is so pleasant to sit on a deck chair by the seaside and watch the red sunset at 5 o'clock every evening.
The breakfast, seafood noodles at Yiyang Chinese Restaurant and Noodle Bar are all very delicious.
The guys who connected the battery cars were very nice. When we passed by, they would say hello and ask us if we wanted to use the car. It was also very convenient to call for a car on the phone. We arrived at the door in a few minutes. Once when it was raining, the shuttle bus boy took the initiative to ask us to get on the bus and take shelter from the rain.
Generally speaking, the hotel's service and scenery exceeded expectations. The old man was very happy and the scenery was beautiful with few people. Special thanks to housekeeper Amy.
Problems such as the indifferent shuttle bus, lack of housekeeping service, and damp quilts in the room that were mentioned in previous reviews did not occur. The only drawback is that the hair dryer really needs to be upgraded. It would be even better if it could be converted into a smart toilet.

msg:Many comments say that the hotel is too old, but the hotel has a strong resort a**osphere that is worthy of being tested. The overall mahogany-colored decoration complements the resort a**osphere. The design details of the hotel all reflect the carefulness, and this careful carving is also reflected in the design details of the hotel. The staff will greet you warmly when walking across the street. If you need anything, you can contact the hotel's housekeeper. Some people may say that the lobby and rooms are far apart, but not being disturbed during vacation is exactly what you need during vacation. Just wave and there will be a response, wave without being disturbed, just right. If Sanya represents sunshine, blue sea and sky, then Mandarin Oriental represents a clear, calm and peaceful a**osphere. If Sanya represents fashionable youth, then Mandarin Oriental is more like a Trojan horse in the playground, accompanying you throughout your vacation.

msg:I booked a sea view room and communicated with the hotel housekeeper Amy in advance. There are complete children's supplies. It's a pity that it's not the highest floor, and the view is a little blocked, but there is no check-out upstairs, so there is nothing we can do. There were very few people in the swimming pool, and the temperature in Sanya had cooled down. We wore thickened diving suits that we bought specially for Double Eleven. We shivered when we got into the water. It stopped being cold after a while, but the temperature of the pool was still around 26 degrees at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Regardless of the cold water, ultraviolet rays will burn your hands two shades darker, so pay attention to sun protection. At 4:30 every evening, I would stroll through the hotel and the various mountain roads and trails. It was very similar to the French resort Pimalai I stayed at when I was on vacation in Koh Lanta, Thailand. The difference was that the rooms in Pimalai were larger and newer. Maybe Wenhua's rooms are a little simple and small, but this unique location will make people forget the existence of time. The first night we had a buffet, in the second row by the beach, the food was sweet and the service was good. On the second night, I ate in the business district and was not very satisfied. I went back to the hotel pub and ordered more fries, which finally made me full. The night before leaving, I asked Amy to book a reservation at Haijiao Xuan. The cool breeze was blowing and the waves were lapping against the rocks. The definition of romance finally had a concrete image. In general, the hotel's service and scenery exceeded expectations. The price of more than 2,000 was due to the off-season. After three years of not leaving Shanghai, this hotel feels like a great value. Of course, the consumption level in Sanya is indeed high, and it has isolated many people, but there must be a time of luxury in life, and it must be spent in worthwhile places. Mandarin Oriental is worthy of all my dreams in the past few years, and it is a bit more than expected. Thanks to the hotel for its good taste and giving us a dream,
Thank you also to the housekeeper Amy for being responsive.

msg:Three-Night Cultural Oriental Tour
It's perfect for my kind of hotel-style travel. During my three-day stay, I hardly left the hotel except for late-night snacks.
Serve:
The person who received us this time was Mia. Who is so lucky to have such a good housekeeper? It's me. Everything I asked for was answered, as if I was a spoiled baby. They were afraid that we would have trouble moving our things, so they applied for us to extend our stay in the original house. Don’t take too much care when decorating the room by yourself. From handwritten cards to shaped balloons to small cakes, it’s hard for most boyfriends to do it, haha. There is also a small necklace that I miss so much. A good butler can really add a lot of points to the hotel's impression. As a guest, you can feel Mia's sincere trea**ent and her continued care after check-out. I hope the company can add chicken drumsticks to her haha. I hope I can get a small fan when I have the chance.

FOOD:
A hearty brunch in the morning, including Wagyu rice noodles and lobster wontons every day. Half of the bread will be updated, but you have to eat the hot buttered bread every day. The fruit was very fresh and sweet, and I realized how good the food I had eaten at other hotels before checking in was. But the watermelon grade is a bit average. Other cold meals are basically the same every day.
In the evening, we had a western dinner for two at Haijiaoxuan as the sun set. Who's to say it's not delicious? More than 1,300 people don't have this view in Beijing, not to mention that every dish was perfect. The seafood platter, from lobster to grilled skewers, is firm and fresh. According to the waiter, it is better than the buffet seafood next to it. Anyway, I am very satisfied with the taste. The sunset was especially beautiful that day, and it was the best seaside dinner experience I had. However, if you want to use 100 US dollars, you need to pay a service fee.
Public area:
I swam in the swimming pool every day. The relaxing environment allowed me to learn how to do a small dive while sitting. There are shade trees next to the infinity pool, which is also great for swimming during the day. But there were a lot of floating objects in the other swimming pool with trails and pavilions, so I didn’t swim in it.
The structure of the hotel is very suitable for walking. Half the time, we didn't call a battery car and chose to explore the forest trails on our own legs. Three days is just enough, not boring.
Among the Sanya Scenic Hotel, Mandarin ranks first, and it is far ahead. One step at a time, the entire glass sea in Coral Bay was really beautiful in the morning. I picked up a lot of beautiful corals and small shells while walking. However, be aware that the sand is a bit harsh on your feet.
Activity:
I was lucky enough to catch the annual Chris**as lighting ceremony, and the a**osphere was no less than the highlight of my last Chris**as watching the drone show in Gubei Water Town. The sudden spray of bubbles and colorful pieces all over the sky is really romantic. The wonderful performance made me forget to take two bites of the cake haha.
Rooms:
The Guanhai Pavilion where I stayed made it possible to watch the sunset in the room. I was mentally prepared before coming. As for the age of the room, it is actually well maintained and the taste of the hotel can still be seen. Except for some things that really need improvement, like the old toilet and no exhaust fan. But I like this small bungalow very much. It feels more like a vacation than the guest rooms in a large building.
Travel photography:
The hotel sent 5 photos and a short video of the Earl's trip. Before I went, I promised that there would be no extra charge. However, the photographer, Director Hong, is so awesome. He can adjust the a**osphere and find the best angle for me. He keeps telling me, a lady, to smile a little bit when I am laughing. I don’t know if it’s luck or the configuration is different, but my subsequent travel photos in other hotels were not as good as this one.
Among the top luxury and five-star hotels in Sanya, I really like the Mandarin Oriental the most, and I have become a little fan since then. I hope to add some projects outside the hotel, because as a Beijing native, I rarely have the opportunity to go to the Mandarin Oriental in Beijing, but I also want to experience other activities.

What was even more surprising was that they arranged to decorate the room with a birthday a**osphere when it was our birthday. Oriental Mandarin is the first choice for vacation in Sanya. Thank you to all the hotel staff for your sincere evaluation. I will come back next time.

msg:Before choosing MO, I had been researching for a long time. For a family of three like me with a child under two years old who simply went to hotels, and it was also a period when various epidemic viruses were prevalent, I finally chose MO. The main reason is that MO is not a popular family hotel, so it avoids the crowds; its public area is really suitable for vacation. However, I saw a lot of comments on Xiaohongshu about the hotel's old facilities and unsatisfactory service. I was a little worried before checking in. But from the moment I arrived at the hotel, I felt like those reviews didn't tell the whole story. (This review is a bit long, but it is a true experience)
1. Regarding check-in efficiency and front desk service quality
I called the MO front desk at 12 o'clock on the day of check-in to ask if the room was ready. After all, I brought three large suitcases and naughty and clingy children. If I arrived at the hotel early and couldn't check in, it would affect my mood. Moreover, Wanda Ruihua's housekeeper applied for a late check-out for me. If MO's room was not ready yet, I would continue to rest and wait in Ruihua. But what I didn't expect was that my room was ready for occupancy, so my husband and I quickly set off with our children and three boxes of luggage.
As soon as the taxi arrived at the hotel and stopped, a smiling staff member opened the door, helped us with our luggage, and guided us to the front desk to check in. When checking in, since the hotel we stayed in before had not checked out for us (it should be the check-in system of the Ministry of Public Security), face recognition could not be entered. Even though I contacted the Wanda Reign housekeeper to urge it, the second time Still no success. The front desk staff may have noticed my anxiety, so they asked us to check in first and then come back when we were free. Then, we successfully got the room card and were ready to take the shuttle bus back to the room. The whole process took less than ten minutes. By the way, we were also assigned a housekeeper, Amy, which was quite surprising because I had heard that only villas have housekeepers. In the following days, thanks to Amy, the holiday became relaxed and enjoyable. While waiting for the shuttle bus, I also received a welcome necklace (with a 🪭 shell).
2. About room facilities, equipment and supplies
I actually checked in on December 6th and checked out on the 9th. Among them, Ctrip couldn't book it on the 6th, so I booked it from the official website for one day, and the price was the same. Originally, we wanted to book 0113 this time because it was the last room, so it would be relatively quiet and undisturbed. Unfortunately, there were already guests in the room on the day of check-in, so they arranged 0110 for us. It turned out to be very good and excellent. The view and pavilion are perfect for lying in a daze for a day ~
Although the hotel is a bit old, the facilities and equipment in the room are well maintained, clean and tidy, and there are no sanitary blind spots (the child's toy car was driven under the bed, and when I went to pick it up, I found that the bottom of the bed was also spotless). Cribs and children's toiletries are also specially prepared. The red panda slippers are so cute~
I've seen reviews before that the hotel's soundproofing is poor, but I stayed there for 3 nights and was not disturbed by any noise from next door. The children are put to bed at 20 o'clock every day, and everything goes smoothly. Of course, I did occasionally hear faint voices next door, but I wouldn't say I was disturbed.
Room cleaning and turndown service are provided daily. The drinks in the mini bar are also rich and varied, including Coke, Sprite sparkling water, beer and bean juice, Wong Lo Kat, and of course, a large bottle of Evian. It is replenished every day. Except for mineral water (because it needs to be soaked in milk), there is no way to finish the other drinks. The room staff was worried that we wouldn't have enough, so they specially prepared two extra large bottles of Nongfu Spring for us to soak in milk.
3. Hotel dining and entertainment
Regarding dining and the breakfast buffet, we went there around 10 o'clock. There was basically no need to wait for a table. There were also child seats and tableware, so there were no special surprises.
You can choose takeout for meals at other times, but you need to pick it up from the takeout box in the lobby. You can also dine at the on-site restaurant. The Internet celebrity check-in spot "Haijiao Xuan" is really lively, so we just took a look, after all, the children are not used to Western food. So I chose a Chinese restaurant facing the ocean, where you can also see the sunset from the window position. Surprisingly, Yiyang also has a children's menu, but the selection is limited. It’s really hard to comment too much on the food, it’s just average, but the service is still very good.
After breakfast, I took the children to the recreation center to play. Very limited children’s play space, 50 square meters or 80 square meters? But after all, MO is not a family hotel, so it doesn’t matter.
The free Bojue travel photography provided by the hotel was also very good, so I couldn’t bear to pack it all in the end.
4. About hotel services
From the front desk to the concierge, and from the guest rooms to the restaurants, I felt all the warmth. To put it more specifically, the front desk maintained a gentle tone and patience in response to my inquiries; the concierge was very proactive in helping me with my luggage throughout the process, and even borrowed a stroller during the process. I said that they would contact me to replace the new trolley once it was returned; the housekeeping depar**ent cleaned the room and replenished the fruit every day, and even came to ask if there was a need for more supplies, and also replenished us with minerals for making milk. water; the children's swimming ring we brought floated to 0113 overnight, and the staff responsible for salvaging floating objects from the swimming pool also enthusiastically helped us bring it back; the service staff in the restaurant were also very gentle to the children, which I am very grateful for. The most important thing is our housekeeper Amy, who is responsible for our daily life. If we have any needs, she will help. She applied for a late check-out on the day of check-out, so that the children can sleep comfortably and happily. Went to check out. When checking out (the child broke a cup), Amy also gave me a little squirrel (actually this is my dream souvenir, because I have already caused a lot of trouble for Amy, so I didn't have the nerve to ask for it directly).
By the way, we were lucky enough to meet a newlywed couple's wedding on the day of check-in, and the wedding was decorated on the day of check-out. It was really festive.
The overall evaluation is that it is beyond expectations and is a comfortable and worry-free vacation mode.

msg:I have been to Sanya several times before, but I have never dared to make a reservation because I heard that the rooms at Wenhua Hotel are relatively "old". However, the view of Wenhua Hotel has always attracted me. This time I took advantage of the children's Chris**as vacation to try it. The day before departure, my dedicated butler Mia contacted me to communicate relevant matters and took great care of me. When we arrived at the hotel, Mia upgraded our room, arranged playpens and pedals for the children, as well as cute children's bathrobes and slippers. Mandarin's butler service is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and Mia's service is like a spring breeze. And the room is not too old, and the accommodation has a Southeast Asian flavor. Highly recommended if you are just on vacation.

msg:Special thanks to the housekeeper Lily. I stayed with my two children by myself. The younger one, who is only one and a half years old and weighs 20 pounds, needs to be carried all the way. There is a lot of luggage and a stroller. She really gave me a lot of help. We have been in constant contact via WeChat. We have many things to do and have to trouble her. Whether it is helping me pick up my courier when it arrives and delivering it to my room, or helping me return goods. When I leave, my luggage is too big and small and is difficult to handle. She also helps me deliver it directly. Get to the car. Even when I was about to drive to the next hotel and my phone ran out of battery, she helped me get a power bank without worrying that I would not return it or give her money after I returned it. This is my first time staying at Mandarin, and I will definitely come back next time. Although the room is really old, it is so quiet and suitable for vacation and relaxation. I am particularly grateful to every service staff in the hotel, who are always responsive to my requests. Although it is not a parent-child hotel, the attitude towards children is very warm and good. It is even better than a parent-child ceiling hotel I stayed in later. I will definitely come next time! Although the room is really old, I will come back next time! By the way, the travel photos provided by the hotel were really unexpected. I only wanted 5 free photos, but I couldn’t help but spend money to buy many photos. The photographer is so professional and really friendly to children. My boy is too naughty.

My housekeeper Brea was super considerate and arranged the honeymoon decoration for me in advance. I was so touched when I saw the little card left for me. She was really thoughtful and even gave it to me in the evening. The small gift of the necklace came and I communicated with me in advance about my room needs. I was also very satisfied with the location of the room. The room has a view every step of the way in the hotel. The room is two minutes away from the beach. There are many places suitable for taking pictures. It is very suitable for checking in. Breakfast is until 11 o'clock. It is very friendly for people who stay in bed. An absolute vacation spot!

msg:Overall feeling very satisfied. The housekeeper Rita was very friendly and enthusiastic. Since the room type I booked was no longer in the ideal location, she upgraded the room type for free. The hotel provided Earl with travel photos, and the photographer who followed us was also very professional and enthusiastic. The water pressure in the shower is high, there are many choices of pillows, and the battery shuttle is readily available. The breakfast is simply a feast for the eyes and taste. Every hotel employee greets you politely and with a smile. We drove out to run some errands in the evening. When we returned to the hotel, an employee rode a scooter and followed us until we parked the car. We thought something was wrong, but it turned out that they came to care about whether we had an umbrella in the car. They were afraid that we would get out of the car and get wet in the rain. The whole family They all felt warm in their hearts. The hotel's private beach view is incredible and must be praised! Finally, I would like to point out some shortcomings. It is recommended that the room be equipped with a 3x makeup mirror. It is 2023. This thing is not expensive and is already standard equipment in hotels. Will definitely come again!

msg:I have been planning to stay at the Mandarin Oriental for a long time. This time my son turned 18 and chose this hotel for his coming-of-age ceremony. I am really lucky to have met a very loving, beautiful, serious and responsible fairy housekeeper Kiki! Because kiki’s appearance lit up the entire trip, I have to praise her! First of all, Kiki took the initiative to contact me on WeChat about a week before check-in, and paid attention to the weather conditions in real time, because at that time, there were two typhoons forecast in Sanya. He also offered to upgrade my room type for free, and considering that we have three generations of grandparents, he also offered to add an extra bed for two nights free of charge. During the call, I learned that National Day was my son's 18th birthday. He was very considerate and helped me reserve a room with the best view in the swimming pool pavilion. He also helped me with the decoration, ordering cakes, etc. I was shocked the moment I arrived in the room. The scenery was so beautiful that I couldn't take my eyes away. The happy birthday decoration was very a**ospheric, and there were also National Day cakes and various fruits. As long as I ask any questions, Kiki Butler will solve them as soon as possible. They are fast and efficient. They also took the initiative to contact me many times during the period to ask me if the room was good and if I needed anything. I have really stayed in so many hotels, and the vacation feeling at Mandarin is really great. Business was definitely good during the National Day holiday. The kiki housekeeper even delayed check-out when the room was full. He came to see me off before leaving, gave me a lot of water, and helped me carry my heavy luggage. I sincerely thank the housekeeper Kiki for her enthusiasm and care, which allowed me to easily bring my children to vacation. I have never stayed at any resort hotel twice, but because of the beautiful scenery and Kiki the butler, I must experience the charm of Mandarin Oriental again when I go to Sanya in the future!

After calling for a taxi and waiting for 20 minutes, it didn't come. The three of us checked in, and Addison would take the initiative to ask us for extra gear for one more person, but your staff at Mandarin Oriental had no such awareness at all. The attitude at the front desk when checking in was also very average. I ordered a seafood dinner at Haijiao Xuan and asked if I could move it to the first row. I was rejected directly. Why not communicate with me? You are not a low-end hotel, but you still need to cultivate the corporate culture. Don't say no to guests directly! Later, I went to Haijiaoxuan for dinner and was moved to the first row. Let me tell you that the service at Haijiaoxuan was very good and I was very satisfied. Every other aspect needs improvement! !

msg:Overall, it is a resort hotel with almost no shortcomings.
The Mandarin Oriental Hotel is located in Coral Bay. It is the only hotel in the Bay Area. The coastal path in front of the hotel entrance is also very beautiful. It is a restricted area, so the hotel is very quiet and there are no helicopters buzzing around. It is very suitable for a quiet vacation.
The hotel's swimming pool is very beautiful with pavilions and green plants, and there is a slide to increase the playability. However, when you go swimming, you will find that there are still some fallen leaves and floating dust in the swimming pool.
Walking from the lobby to the seaside, you will pass by the seaside buffet restaurant, Haijiaoxuan is in the corner. Under the setting sun, the dinner tables and chairs are arranged in an orderly manner on the ground of green grass and stone bricks. The fountains and coconut trees blocked the setting sun and turned into gray silhouettes. The scenery of the seaside makes people feel emotionally stable. Walking along the seaside to the hotel, the layout of check-in points along the way is very natural, even better than the photos. There are no areas in the hotel that you have to pay to enter, so you won't feel disconnected when you stay and play.
There are many stone statues in the hotel. They look very Southeast Asian. They are not strange or normal, but they always attract attention. The breakfast is not very rich, but the freshly prepared ones are delicious.
In addition, the service is also very good. From door greeting to check-in, battery car pick-up and drop-off are all professional and efficient. However, the butler service is required when checking in. It seems that they will not be contacted in advance. Thank you to the butler Chen Chuan for your service.

Our housekeeper Lily was gentle and sweet, warm and thoughtful, responsive to all requests, and even gave her a little squirrel as a gift, which my daughter loved very much. The sea view from the Guanhai Pavilion on the 6th floor of Building C where we stayed on the first day was great, but that night the guests next door seemed to be singing K live broadcast, and they were noisy after 11 o'clock. I contacted the manager and dealt with it immediately. The next day we changed to Building 1 Room 0102, Haifeng Pavilion, has very good sound insulation. The hair dryer is upgraded to Dyson. It is very convenient to go to the beach and swimming pool. There are marble steps at the door instead of lawn, so there will be no mosquitoes. It is the first choice for bringing children!

As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we met the housekeeper Rita, who was very beautiful and soft-spoken. After checking in, I entered the room and saw a little squirrel, a toiletry set, panda slippers and a very sincere handwritten letter prepared by Rita for the children. At that time, I felt very warm that I had chosen the right hotel! Rita asks about her needs and housing experience every day. Before check-out, she also proactively asks if she needs to delay check-out. The service is very attentive and thoughtful, so she must give it a perfect thumbs up!
The scenery of the hotel is really beautiful step by step, and it will be a blockbuster if you take a photo. The breakfast was also very delicious. I tried basically everything and there was nothing wrong with it. Although I lived in a courtyard room on the first floor, I didn't see a single bug. The shuttle bus is always on call, the driver is very skilled, and the bus drives fast and steady. My children are super excited every time they take the bus.
If I have the chance to come to Sanya again, I will choose Mandarin Oriental again.

Bojue travel photography is available. The housekeeper reminded me a day in advance, but I didn’t go to take pictures because I was really tired. When I was walking in the hotel in the morning, I saw a lot of people taking pictures, and the effect looked pretty good. Hahaha. I should. It’s a good experience!

We were very happy to upgrade the Sea Breeze Pavilion on the day we checked in. Traveling within the hotel was also very convenient. The guest room directly dialed the electric car service with one click, and the response was very fast. The guy drove the car smoothly and exciting hahaha. The guy on the electric car on the day of check-out would also take the electric car service. Knocked on the door and asked if I wanted to move my luggage.

There is nothing to say about the environment. It has an unparalleled sea view and is very healing. I like the smell of Oulon toiletries~ I will come here next time when I feel tired at work hahaha

msg:11 This trip to Sanya Mandarin Oriental Resort was great🌟The hotel exceeded expectations and I am very satisfied! First of all, the scenery of the hotel is so beautiful. The private beach🏖, infinity pool, coconut palm waves, quiet and elegant. Secondly, the service of our personal butler Grace was very good. She took the initiative to ask our needs every day. The service throughout the hotel was in place, and the car was always on call. The Chinese and Western food in the hotel are delicious, and it is very pleasant to listen to music and drink wine at the bar in the evening! Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Mandarin Oriental!

Thanks to Miss Mia from Mandarin Oriental for arranging honeymoon decoration, birthday decoration and turndown service for us during our honeymoon and my husband's birthday. Very considerate and considerate, they arranged a small birthday cake and longevity noodles, and also specially wrote a blessing card. We specially experienced the buffet dinner, YYDS! The family swimming pool is also very fun~ It is recommended to try the free travel photography~ It is not a waste at all to spend half an hour experiencing it~

msg:If you stay in Guanhaixuan, you can see the blue sea from the balcony. The scenery is different every time from morning to night. The hotel is large, the rooms are reasonably distributed, and the environment is quiet and not noisy. It is very suitable for vacation. The beach is full of beautiful scenery, and you can take a photo of it and it will be a blockbuster. Several swimming pools also have their own characteristics, and there are various swimming rings for babies to play in. The service is beyond praise, all the staff are very nice, and the housekeeper Lily tracks the needs throughout the process, and the experience is very good. I will check into other Mandarin Oriental hotels if I have the opportunity in the future.

msg:The hotel's swimming pool is great, each has its own characteristics, and there are many things to play: water slides, underwater propellers, bubble parties; the beach has obvious advantages and disadvantages in comparison, it is not delicate enough, but it has good scenery and floating Scuba diving and paddle boarding are also very cost-effective. It would be better if there were more marine projects. The food in the hotel is very good. The buffet barbecue is highly recommended. It has many categories and is very good. Haijiaoxuan is also highly recommended. The scenery is good and the quality of the dishes is also good. It’s worth the price, but you need to book in advance. The Chinese restaurant feels that the product quality has declined this time, and the taste of some dishes is a bit too strong. As for the noodle bar, it’s a pity that there is no supply of sour rice noodles. The other items are still of high quality, which is very suitable to satisfy your hunger while playing. Bowl; there are quite a lot of breakfast categories, and I didn’t feel tired after eating it for a week. The lobster wontons are very good; the food at Sunset Bar is quite satisfactory, and the drinks this time refreshed my understanding: the combination of coriander + spicy millet It was really sour and refreshing. The only thing that I felt was a little bit wrong was the coconuts in the hotel, which were not very tasty. Anyway, I ordered a total of 8 coconuts for takeout in the end. The service in the hotel was very good. The staff were all responsive and very fast. I had the battery car service. It’s the fastest among the resort hotels I’ve stayed in. I don’t know if it has something to do with the off-peak travel, and you’ll be notified by phone when the bus is approaching, so you don’t have to go out and wait. The hotel has fewer parent-child programs, except for the children’s swimming pool and I have never experienced the children's paradise, but unfortunately bubble parties are not always available. I think the hotel's landscape design is very good, especially when walking down from Coral Bay, you can stop and take photos everywhere. , and there are also man-made landscapes such as Shanmeng Oath Pavilion and Phoenix Garden, so I really don’t worry about not being able to make a movie; finally, let’s talk about the rooms. It is true that the facilities in some rooms are a bit old, and there may be some spider webs on the decorative paintings. Silk thread, but mostly clean and tidy. If vacation is about relaxation, eating, entertainment and taking photos, then Mandarin Oriental will not disappoint you. I hope I can stay next to the water slide next time and experience the feeling of being able to slide into the swimming pool right out of the door.

msg:I have stayed at Mangrove Tree and Hilton in the early days, and in recent years I have stayed at Ritz-Carlton (I was impressed by a few restaurants, but nothing else), and Atlantis (nothing special except being close to the Water World). I stayed at the Tianfang InterContinental in the first half of the trip (it has strong overall strength, the room has a large view and sleeps comfortably), and the Oriental Mandarin in the second half of the trip. Although I didn’t sleep very well, I still highly recommend coming to Oriental Mandarin. First, the scenery is really beautiful. It’s very unique and multi-layered. I won’t post too many pictures. This is something that neither Yalong Bay Hotel nor Haitang Bay Hotel has, and it’s worth a visit. 2. The service is very good and the service speed is very fast! It's very different from the bad reviews online. This time the housekeeper RENA is responsive to all requests. If you want to see the room, you can see the room, if you want to adjust the extra bed, you can adjust it, and if you want to make an appoin**ent, you can make an appoin**ent. It's really super fast! Good review! It's really convenient. The hotel cars arrive within 5 minutes, and they will greet you if you encounter them on the road. Even if they are very busy, they will make arrangements. I would like to praise all the service staff in the fleet, introduce the hotel facilities, and adjust each other. It can be seen that it is very busy, but still patience. I would like to praise Chen Wei for the catering. Because I bothered him to get food many times with my baby in my arms, he was very patient. He also remembered my preferences the next day and took the initiative to serve tea for breakfast. 3. Recommend Haijiaoxuan buffet dinner, be sure to come when the weather is nice! Come sunset, beautiful. I arranged this buffet on the first day I arrived and was pleasantly surprised by the scenery and taste. The all-you-can-eat lobster steak and grilled durian tastes great. Although the taste of several other restaurants in his family is good, the price/performance ratio is much weaker than it. If you don’t consider staying in a hotel, it’s a good idea to hang out in a hotel and have a buffet here. 4. The infinity swimming pool by the sea, with few people and beautiful scenery. It is so relaxing to swim and enjoy the sea breeze. The lifeguards are very good at laying out blankets and towels.
Let’s talk about the room type. The room is indeed not big or new, and I feel like I don’t want to sit on the sofa. Haha, I will lay my own sheets for everything. There is a seal on the toilet door which will cause a loud noise when the door is opened at night. The accompanying picture shows the balcony views of three types of Sea Breeze Pavilion rooms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In the end, I chose to walk down to the first floor by the seaside. It is very close to the lobby restaurant and swimming pool. I can’t see it in the photo, but the first glance when I got there was amazing. Disadvantages: The room feels dark. It doesn't feel safe to sleep with the window open at night because it is on the first floor. If you close the balcony door and draw the curtains, the room will be a bit stuffy. But if you are bringing a baby, this room is very suitable because it is close and there are many steps in Wenhua, so there is no need for a stroller at all. In addition, because the hotel is well greened, there are still mosquitoes, so be careful to prevent mosquitoes.

msg:When choosing a hotel, after reading various reviews, I still wanted to choose a hotel with a good environment and a resort feel. Facts have proved that Mandarin is very suitable. Although many reviews said that the hotel was old, so my expectations were not high, but the result was unexpectedly satisfying😀
Environment: There was a typhoon, strong winds and heavy rain, but it could not stop the beauty of the environment. Walking around the shore and feeling the wind and rain was a different experience. Everywhere is a scenery. It’s really nice to be able to maintain this experience after so many years. The sun was shining when we left. Come back next time to enjoy the scenery you missed!
Hygiene: Although the facilities are relatively old, they are very clean. On the first day after the typhoon passed, the leaves and sand in the public areas have been cleaned up, and the rooms are also neat and tidy.
Facilities: The only shortcoming, especially the hair dryer, has been worn out and is seriously inconsistent with the hotel's positioning.
Service: The staff are very nice. They will say hello when they meet on the road. The battery car comes quickly. The butler July responds in a timely manner.

After check-out, I also helped to apply for a late check-out, which is a response to every request~

Environment: The environment is also very good. The sun finally came out on the last day, which was touching! The photos are great! Lying on the beach and watching the sea is the way I wanted to spend my vacation, and it happened!
You can call a shuttle bus wherever you go, and you can enjoy the scenery everywhere you go by yourself in the garden. No need to go to other attractions. Just stay in the hotel~


Facilities: The facilities are indeed as everyone commented. They are a bit old and the hair dryer is not very powerful.

Overall, it was a good experience! Will come again!

I remember that when I first came to Wenhua in 2021, I met a mother with a very beautiful 6-month-old mixed-race baby. At that time, I thought that if I have a child, I must bring it with me. This time I brought my five-and-a-half-month-old baby. The hotel is very child-friendly and the child did not get any mosquito bites. .
During this trip to Sanya, I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Sanya for the last three days. I was very satisfied. The environment of the hotel was still so beautiful and quiet. It was a very pleasant vacation. I took my mother and children with me. My mother liked this hotel I booked very much. hotel. The service attitude of the hotel staff is also very good, especially the butler Chen Chuan, who is enthusiastic, attentive and thoughtful. He helped me make the crib fence and crib very good. The bedding in the room was very comfortable, and the stay experience was still very satisfactory. When my children get older next year, I will leave a few days for Wenhua when I come to Sanya!

Welcome fruits and fresh lilies were brought to the room. If I was not satisfied with the room, I contacted the housekeeper Sally. Sally was very professional and responded promptly. They handled the situation very well and gave us a very satisfying island vacation. Sally also helped us book snorkeling in advance. The snorkeling was very happy, and there were many small yellow croakers. No matter where you go, you can call a shuttle bus. It won’t be inconvenient because the park is so big. When you left, the housekeeper even called for a drop-off in advance. Thank you very much ~ If you want to check in, try not to go at 2pm, as there will be a lot of people. It’s a great experience. The breakfast at the hotel is quite rich. I’ll come back next time.

Compared with some other hotels I have stayed at, the price/performance ratio is very high, the scenery in the store is good, the coastal area is large, the service is the best overall, and the environment is warm and comfortable
This time I still contacted Fiona, the housekeeper who stayed at the hotel before, and she was still very helpful. She actively helped coordinate and communicate in advance, so I didn't have to worry about taking care of my baby and the elderly, which made me feel very at ease.
The breakfast is much richer than that of Mouyue, and the restaurant staff are highly professional. As long as there are still customers after the meal time, they will remind you and collect the food at a snail's pace.
Catch the sea in the morning. There are many small seafood, and the variety is more colorful than that of Sun Bay. Of course, you still have to let the animals go to play. My kids like it very much.
While eating hot pot at the noodle bar, I felt that the parasol was in the way of blocking the setting sun. A male clerk wearing glasses was very proactive in solving the problem, leaving no regrets for the customer. After eating at two restaurants, the quality of the restaurants cannot be overemphasized and the ingredients are very good.
It’s just that the weather was calm and I didn’t play like a sailing boat, and it rained heavily and I didn’t eat in Haijiaoxuan outdoors. I’ll keep this in mind next time I come back.

1. The service is considerate, every staff member is very kind, like a family member, responsive to every request.
2. Although the house price has risen, some supporting facilities have also caught up. For example, the toiletries are very good, and even the purified water has been replaced with Evian, which is of a higher quality!
3. There is also a free travel photography service. Although it is a routine and we asked for a lot of photos at an extra cost, it also added a lot of memories to the trip.
Dissatisfied:
1. The biggest shortcoming is the breakfast. Before I came here, I heard from a friend in the travel agency that the breakfast at Mandarin Oriental is different from before.
2. The swimming pool is seriously aging, especially the infinity pool. The floor tiles have fallen off and pinched your feet. It is uncomfortable. I enjoyed swimming in Mandarin, but this experience is a bit disappointing.
3. Check-in is really slow. Generally speaking, there is an explanation in advance around 12 o’clock. It is too long to wait for more than an hour when we arrive at the store at 14 o’clock. We arrived in Sanya after the whole morning flight, and we didn’t have a good rest. , so I feel a little uncomfortable.

msg:I chose a hotel for a long time before booking. Seeing the mixed reviews of Mandarin Oriental, I was quite worried. The actual check-in experience is pretty good.
The hotel has its own beach, which is very private. In August, there are fewer people in the hotel except for breakfast time. The water is very blue and there are many corals on the beach. Watching the sunset by the coconut tree is also ok. It's a pity that the net red swing has been blown off recently.
There are several areas in the swimming pool. There are beach chairs by the sea where you can lie down and watch the sea at any time, and there are lifeguards guarding the water. There are 24-hour battery cars to help with transportation. But walking from the beach actually doesn't take long to get back to the room.
The rooms are all 2-story villas, and Jade Garden is on the first floor. There are no bugs, very clean, and the rooms are quite large. The toiletries are from Oulong. Two bottles of Evian glass bottles of water a day. The room is very air-conditioned, and it is very cool when you come back from the outside 😂 The basic online reviews are not thunderous.
Hotel staff are also friendly. Thanks to the butler Grace, I contacted you in advance before check-in, and the communication during the check-in was very timely and smooth~ Since the last day of Bojue's trip was in the afternoon, I also helped to communicate as much as possible to delay check-out. very nice~
The receptionist at the entrance of the hotel lobby is also very friendly and will help open the door and take luggage. The deposit refund after check-out is also very fast. Maybe there are fewer people in August.
What may be inconvenient is that takeaway can only be delivered to the door of the hotel, and you need to pick it up yourself. Breakfast is from 7 to 11 o'clock. After 10 o'clock, you have to queue for about 20 minutes.
There is a big pineapple shopping mall more than 2 kilometers around, where you can do simple shopping. It is also very convenient to take a taxi from the hotel.
Overall it is quite recommended.

The boy black who drove the welcome car introduced the hotel environment from the moment we checked in. terrain. The breakfast is rich. The park is very large and suitable for taking children to play. The small birthday cakes are very delicious. Although the room facilities are a bit old, the service and overall environment are definitely worth the price. I will definitely bring my family here again.
The sea, coconut groves, sunshine, drizzle, strong winds... Can you experience a richer climate than this?

When walking in the park, hotel employees would take the initiative to say hello (perhaps they were afraid that we would get lost), and electric cars would arrive for pick-up in about five minutes. , the hardware equipment is a bit old, but the hotel strives to make up for it with software services.

The sea is right outside the room. It is really beautiful when you come back from a walk on the seaside after dinner! I would like to express my special thanks to the housekeeper Mia, who is very attentive and able to solve problems. The hand-painted cards made us feel that we were treated with care.

If it wasn't for the children to go back to class, I think I can stay for another 5 days. The staff are very courteous, and they greet each other warmly when they meet on the road. Although it is only a small detail, they feel very comfortable. Especially worth mentioning is the handsome butler Kennys, who is really responsive and has a very good attitude. Because I didn't want to bother to pack my luggage and wanted to continue living in the original room, Kennys patiently helped me coordinate the room. If I had any questions during the stay, he also took the trouble to find him. He really made me feel at home. Big thumbs up to Kennys 👍

msg:Stayed here for 3 nights, check-in experience for your reference [shy]

🏨 The housekeeper will + V one day in advance to confirm the time of arrival at the hotel with you; we arrived around 2 o'clock, and the front desk told us that there was no vacant room and we had to wait. When we were done, we would call and upgrade the room type for free; there is a tea room next to the front desk where we can rest , Tea breaks and water are prepared inside~ The waiting time in the middle is a bit boring, I took a stroll by the seaside, the scenery is beautiful, and every shot is a blockbuster❗️
	
🛏️ Room: I stayed at Raffles Lingshui for 3 nights before I came here. The room is very big. There is some contrast when I open the door of the Mandarin Oriental room. The space here is limited and the facilities are a bit old, but it is very clean and the sound insulation effect is also good. ok; we live on the 3rd floor and can see a bit of the sea; the minibar is replenished every day and can be enjoyed for free
	
⚠️ One thing I want to complain about is the shower in the bathroom. The angle is difficult to grasp. Turn it to the innermost position to avoid water spraying out of the bathroom
	
🚌 The hotel is very big. If you live far away from the lobby, you will basically rely on the shuttle bus. After you call and call for a taxi, as long as it is not a rush hour, you can get there within 5 minutes~
	
🌸 The staff are more service-minded. The little brother who drives the shuttle bus will take the initiative to say hello to the guests on the road. It is very nice~ He will also take care of families with children. It is not as bad as it is said on the Internet
	
🥗 Breakfast is open from 7 to 11 o'clock, and the peak period is about 9:30. We come down for breakfast at 8 o'clock and there are almost no one; if you want to sit indoors during the peak period, you need to wait; outdoors generally don't have to wait too long; Check out was relatively late on the last day, and the traffic of the restaurant at around 10:30 is also good at this time~
	
🍢Beach BBQ: Simply put, 🦪🦞🍨durian freedom is achieved; the grilled oysters are super delicious, and the ice cream recommends cappuccino and mint chocolate flavors; the taste of lemon passion fruit flavor is a bit heavy and pitted; the first row View seats must be booked in advance❗️We booked late and only caught up with the second row~
	
🏊♀️ Swimming pool: Two large public swimming pools, the one with slides is open until 18:00, and the other one is until 22:00; the one with slides has a shallow water area, and there is a bubble party every afternoon; the slides are very fun, both adults and children 🉑️
	
🤿 Water sports: See the end picture for detailed prices. You can report to the hotel for snorkeling, or you can go down to play by yourself; if you talk to the hotel, please contact the housekeeper in advance, it is not open when the water level is shallow; we brought our own snorkeling equipment and went snorkeling Twice, the water is very clear, 🐠 a lot
Tips: Remember to bring ham sausage, the little fish will chase you~
	
In addition to 🤿, I also experienced the paddle board. The children liked it very much. They also succeeded in trying to stand up paddle board. The coach was very patient.
	
📷 Photoshoot: The seaside swing is gone now, the wind and waves were too bad a few days ago [流泪]

I made a guide in advance and found out that the hotel was old and the service was poor, but after experiencing it, I didn’t complain about it like other people did.

msg:I specially selected the Mandarin Oriental in Coral Bay, Sanya, Hainan, for a staggered vacation at the end of August. During the three-year epidemic, the most popular restaurant in Shanghai was Mandarin Oriental. Their service concept is quite good, and the design is more Southeast Asian and island-style. This time, Wenhua in Hainan has put a lot of effort into the design of one bay and one mountain. It was opened in 2009. Although the year is already old, the garden of the entire hotel is more mature. The roads are basically surrounded by green trees covering the sky, from high plantains and coconut trees to medium-height frangipani flowers. , Terminalia trees, birds of paradise and other flowers are dotted among them. Even if you don’t take the shuttle bus, you can feel the refreshment brought by the plants while strolling along the mountain road.
One day before check-in, Mr. Chen Chuan, the caring butler, contacted us in advance to understand our floor preferences and help us prepare the room. Afraid of the impact of the three typhoons, he also asked about the weather conditions. Mr. Chen responded quickly one by one. He felt very comfortable with the step-by-step service before he checked in. The car is parked on the third floor of the hotel, and the staff will guide you to the hotel lobby on the second floor. Since the guest room has not been cleaned, the family has a short rest in the sunset bar. The housekeeper, Mr. Chen, sent us the room card. Tong also expedited the check-in speed for us. After receiving the notice that you can check in, take the shuttle bus to help deliver the room.
The 5th floor of the 2 buildings we stayed in, the bathrooms are on the left and right when you open the door, you can directly see the balcony and sea view. The curtain and door next to the bathtub can be closed, and children are not afraid of being cold in the bath. The bath water is very large, very comfortable, and there are all kinds of toiletries. There are also slippers, toiletries, and bathrobes for children. It is so cute to swim in a bathrobe. Two double beds of 1.35 meters, no pressure to sleep with the baby. The drinks in the refrigerator will be replenished every day. There are also two large bottles of Evian mineral water in sufficient supply. Of course, you can also choose Nongfu mountain spring water. On the third day of our stay, we don’t know whether the neighbors upstairs or next door left the takeaway and instant noodles at our door, and the swill inside flowed out. We saw the sewage flowing across the house early when we went out, so we informed the housekeeper, Mr. Chen, as soon as possible. , help solve it quickly. After we got back from breakfast, the door was cleared. Every time Mr. Chen's service is in place, including the drop-off, he did not receive a confirmation message, which is also troublesome for Mr. Chen. Wenhua's butler service is really responsive, and we must give it a thumbs up.
Due to the vacation with the baby, we didn't go anywhere for four days and three nights, and ate in restaurants. There are many kinds of food in the breakfast pavilion, such as lobster, noodles, fruits, all kinds of freshly squeezed, coffee, bread, hot and cold dishes, which can fully satisfy the children's eating habits; lunch noodles, grouper seafood noodles are so fresh They all fall down; the barbecue buffet in the waterside pavilion for dinner, the tomahawk steak in Haijiaoxuan, each restaurant has its own characteristics.
Just sitting on the beach for a while and watching the waves roll, from dark blue to light blue in the distance, to almost transparent with a little bit of blue, and finally to the milky white of the coast; I can't see the layers of waves rushing forward and backward The waves hit the waves and bounced back at the connection between the sea and the shore, taking away part of the sand and stones, exposing the white coral stones and scallops; the small crabs that occasionally climbed out quickly walked on the beach, seeming to be in a hurry. Every day we take a leisurely walk in the garden, blowing the sea breeze, looking at the distant sea, watching the lights of the lighthouse alternate, and observing every ebb and flow of the tide.
The river and the sky were completely dustless, and there was only a solitary moon in the bright sky. No rush, no attractions, just enjoy this slow time with family and cubs. The moon has not yet set, and there is a reflection of the moonlight on the sea surface, sparkling on the sea surface, the world has become very quiet, only the sound of the waves can be heard~~~

msg:I have been to Haijiaoxuan (the place where the lanterns are hung) for my birthday before. I did my homework and knew that the room is relatively old, but the public environment of the hotel is really too outdated, so I still came here
Before the hotel check-in, the housekeeper Fiona added WeChat to understand the needs, and took the initiative to send a chocolate mousse cake (super delicious), and also made up for the room decoration, which made up for the fact that the room was not new enough. The hotel daily necessities are also very good.
When I asked the housekeeper to help me book the seaside buffet dinner the day before, there were no seats in the first row, and there will be no more seats in the next three days, but it was successfully coordinated in the end, which is great. I mainly only ate three things: grilled lobster, grilled durian and foie gras
Travel photography is really popular. After telling the butler what you want, you will call to make an appoin**ent immediately. The time slot is very satisfactory. It doesn’t have to be a day in advance. I am willing to spend money to gather two circles of friends
Finally, the seat at the front of the noodle bar restaurant is amazing. It’s so close to the sea, and it’s great to eat a bowl of noodles at the price of the airport. I suggest that sisters who arrive early in the room and don’t come out of the room sit there. It’s so comfortable when the breeze blows

When we arrived at 12:30, it happened to be cleaned in advance and we would check in immediately. Great! 👍I booked the spa and snorkeling before check-in, and the spa is very satisfying, the tide-like technique is very professional, and the experience is great. Due to the inflammation and fever of the children's tonsils, it was a pity that they missed the snorkeling because they couldn't go into the water. Grace also thoughtfully helped to delay the check-out until 13 o'clock, so that the children could rest for a while, thank you very much. Bojue travel photography is also satisfied, the photographer mobilizes emotions and captures very professionally. The tight time experience is too short this time, and I look forward to coming again next time.

msg:Let’s talk about the reason for giving one point first. The housekeeper of this hotel contacted me in advance, added WeChat, confirmed the itinerary, and asked me about my detailed arrival time, personalized needs, etc. But nothing was done. Asked me for a positive review after I left the store. Let me send her edited text. This is so a**! So everyone knows what the good reviews in the comments are about.
Next is my evaluation. The location of the hotel is very good, the facilities are relatively old, and it is quiet. It is suitable for vacation. The beach is average, but the reef beach is very good and the scenery is great. The guest rooms are relatively scattered, and the busiest and best service provider is the concierge who drives us to and from the hotel. He greets us every time. Room service is also good. The restaurant and front desk and other people you see and ask are all trained to have a "professional" tone and answer your questions mechanically, with all kinds of evasion and no solution to anything, but with a good attitude. I booked a panoramic view of the beach and coast in the Xishui Wentao Pavilion in advance. Literally, it is the room closest to the beach and the sea. It is very suitable for taking children to play. The housekeeper confirmed the arrival time. I arrived about two hours later than the time told to her. I arrived at the store around three in the afternoon. The front desk went through the formalities and said that the room was being inspected and that it would be fine soon. I went to have tea and wait nearby. After a while, I took the children to play on the beach. After an hour, no one paid attention to me. If you ask, everyone is doing rounds and they will be fine soon. Later, I asked the housekeeper on WeChat, and she said she was going to see what was going on. She later replied that she saw that I was bringing my children to upgrade a villa for me. Note that the reason for the upgrade was to give my children more space to move around. But I came here to play on the beach. You didn't tell me in advance that you didn't have the room I booked, and you didn't tell me at the front desk that you didn't have it. I waited for more than an hour and you still didn't say you didn't have it. You still found a so-called reason from my perspective to help me. So we arrived at the villa on the mountain at almost five o'clock in the afternoon, which was far away from the beach. There is a swimming pool, and it is estimated that few people live there. The children swam in the swimming pool for a while, and the green algae film on the bottom of the pool floated up. At breakfast the next day, there were many people queuing up. There were empty seats outdoors, and many guests were willing to sit outdoors. Sorry, they weren’t allowed in. Even though there were seats available, they had to wait in line for more than ten minutes. (Don’t ******** me when you see this at the hotel. I specialize in taking videos). After breakfast, we went to the beach. The children played for a while and didn't have enough. They asked the housekeeper if they could extend their stay, but they still wanted to stay in the room I booked. The reply is, go to Ctrip and place a new order for the room type you want. This is the most annoying thing, because the subtext I read is that if I upgrade you to a villa, you have to extend your stay, and you have to take advantage of our hotel. You don’t have to do this if you extend your stay normally, right? You didn't give me the room I booked. Your selling point and my needs were all written in the room name - Panoramic view of the beach and coast of Xishui Wentao Pavilion. Sending it to me on the mountain has nothing to do with my needs. I was very angry here but I refrained from swearing. I told the child that he really didn't want to leave, and he was told that the room was not available on the website for extended stays. Let's see if the hotel can coordinate. He replied that she would go take a look. Then there is no more. After more than an hour, I took the initiative and said, forget it, I can’t stand it any longer. Checked out and left. That's it, I came back the day after I checked out to ask for good reviews.
To sum up, the scenery is good, the facilities are average, and the service is excellent. Its service is sorry for the view and location. At this price, any hotel in Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay in Sanya has better service than this.
And I had the seaside buffet. The ingredients are just okay, but the taste is not good. This seafood buffet is only suitable for photos.
I'm sorry, I spent 4,000 yuan to live in your villa worth more than 10,000 yuan, and I took advantage of you! (Don’t book this villa, no one will live in it and no one will maintain the swimming pool)

Some people think that the guest rooms are old, but they are, but fortunately they are clean, tidy, and comfortable. I also ate at the seaside buffet. To be honest, the taste was not very good, but since I came here, I just treated it as an experience. Anyway, the a**osphere was perfect. The main reason is that the vacation feeling is so strong. You can really spend a whole day in the hotel. Every step takes a scene, and you can take a photo and it will be a blockbuster. It is really not a loss for sisters who like to take pictures.

msg:During this trip to Sanya, I saw a lot of hotels in the guide, and finally chose Mandarin Oriental without hesitation. I stayed for 3 nights this time, and I am really satisfied!

Environment: The landscape design of the hotel is really amazing. Coconut trees, blue sky, sea, one step at a time, you can feel the beauty of the seaside without leaving the hotel. It feels like a vacation in Bali. It should be said that it is very unique among the many top hotels in Sanya!

Hygiene: The hotel room is clean and tidy, and the butler service is also very considerate. We have also upgraded Guanhaixuan. Every time we go out and return to the room, it is cleaned and tidied. It is almost twice a day. The room is cleaned very well!

Service: The most worth mentioning is Wenhua's service. From check-in to check-out, it took 4 days and 3 nights. Every hotel staff I met was so enthusiastic and sincere. Although I encountered a small episode during the stay, I met the duty manager Joanna, a beautiful lady who patiently helped us deal with the problems we encountered. At the end of the check-out, he was picked up by a battery car. Especially on the first day of check-in, he enthusiastically introduced the hotel and room facilities, which left us with a good first impression of the hotel; Haijiaoxuan is a restaurant that must be checked in at the hotel. The a**osphere and scenery are superb. The restaurant manager Greg is a handsome Swiss brother, and there is a very caring waiter lady (sorry I don’t remember the name). When it rained suddenly, he brought us an umbrella to serve the food. The dining experience is really great.

Overall, choosing Mandarin Oriental is really the most correct choice for this trip to Sanya. It was a very memorable trip, and we will come back again!

msg:The hotel is very large, the overall greening style is very resort-like, the super large swimming pool, and the independent beach is beautiful. After staying for three nights, I feel that the hotel staff is obviously not enough during the peak season. Everyone is very busy and inevitably neglects some humanistic care for guests. The sunset buffet is very rich and lively, and the cocktails at the sunset bar are also delicious. There is also a beautiful resident singing lady with a beautiful singing voice and a full sense of a**osphere. Generally speaking, this holiday experience does not conceal its advantages. If you avoid the peak season, the experience will definitely be better.

msg:Before I came here, I saw a lot of negative comments about Mandarin Oriental, but after experiencing it for myself, I really feel very good. The garden landscape is Southeast Asian style, and the water in Coral Bay is clear, with different levels of blue. The exclusive snorkeling for hotel guests is worth returning once a day. The ticket price is high. The sunset and sunset glow in the evening are so beautiful. You can catch the sea every night. You can see crabs, small fish, starfish and sea cucumbers, and the staff is very friendly. I am very grateful to the housekeeper, Amy, for contacting me before check-in and introducing the situation of the hotel. If you have any questions, you will be there in time Feedback was resolved, there was a small problem during check-in, and the supervisor was also enthusiastic to help solve it. His attitude was so good that every driver of the battery car who passed by would also take the initiative to say hello. In short, the 4-day experience was very good, and I will come for vacation in the future

The sea view of Sanya is still Dadonghai. The view of the hotel is a big one. Except that the room facilities are a bit old, there is nothing wrong with it. My daughter had a good time in the swimming pool. The butler Grace served in a timely manner and thoughtfully gave a squirrel doll, which the baby liked very much.

msg:Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Sanya is definitely a must-choice hotel for a trip to Sanya. The environment of the hotel is very good, and the photos are also very good. The hotel is located in the coral bay management area. It can be said that the hotel enjoys a bay alone. The hotel is very quiet. Holidays are also very relaxing, especially the butler Chen Chuan has a very good service, a very warm and careful attitude. The hotel's catering is also very good, in short, the environment and food are very good. Will choose to stay next time.

msg:The hotel exclusively enjoys Coral Bay. It is located in the military management area, with good privacy. There is a duty-free product experience store on the second floor of the hotel. You can purchase products by swiping the mini program and inputting the flight number to send them home. It is very convenient. Entertainment includes double sailing, snorkeling, slide paddling pool and outdoor swimming pool with infinity sea view, recreational game room and fitness room. The beach water of the hotel is relatively clear, but there are many coral fragments on the beach, which is a bit thorny. The overall design of the room facilities is good, but the space It's a bit small, and the wireless direct charger on the bedside table can only charge Apple phones, not Huawei's. It's a pity that the lighting in front of the full-length mirror and the mirror in the washstand is insufficient or the lighting effect is not good.
Services: Front desk, telephone main station, battery car pick-up, room cleaning, catering, recreation and spa services are all very good, especially the butler Jingran Kiki has a very good service attitude and can help solve problems encountered in a timely manner. Waterside buffet breakfast restaurant Meng Ting's service is warm and thoughtful, very professional, thank you.
Meals: The lobster, durian and foie gras buffet is very good, Sunset BAR and Yiyang Chinese Restaurant are also good
Spa: Compared with the Mandarin Oriental Spa in Taikoo Hui, Guangzhou, it is slightly inferior, but the overall experience is still good

msg:I highly recommend Mandarin Oriental. Before this trip, I chose Mandarin Oriental. After doing all kinds of homework, I chose Mandarin Oriental. This is how a beautiful encounter begins. The one-on-one butler service is very heartwarming. The day before departure, the butler added me on WeChat. He greeted me warmly and paid attention to the landing time, and helped me estimate the arrival time. Because of military control, the plane was delayed again and again. The butler was very helpful. Patient service. When we arrived at the hotel, every service staff was very enthusiastic. The coastal road leading to the hotel is very beautiful, surrounded by blue sea and blue sky. Enter the lobby to pick up the welcome necklace. The child likes it very much. In the words of the child, every brother and sister are very, very enthusiastic. There are many check-in points in the hotel, and the photos taken by rookies are also very beautiful, because the scenery is beautiful. The hotel enjoys a beach exclusively, and every photo is beautiful. The park is winding and secluded, and each room is like a small villa, very quiet, and it is a resort. No matter where you want to go, just make a phone call, and the car will be picked up within 5 minutes. I hear a lot of greetings every day, and even the children who have never been sensible have become polite, and they keep praising the brothers and sisters who serve. The hotel's infinity pool has many different depths, and the water quality is particularly good compared to other hotels. If you are on vacation and don’t know where to go, come here, the Southeast Asian style decoration, the service and the beautiful scenery alone are worth it! Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Qiqi very much, see you next time. When I checked out today, the children didn't want to leave, but Haitang Bay Hotel couldn't check out, so I had to come next time.
Full marks for service, environment and sanitation 💯

msg:It can be regarded as an old-fashioned luxury hotel in Sanya. Considering that this trip is for an old mother to bring her baby alone, she doesn’t want to go to an overcrowded parent-child hotel, so she chose a small fan with Jingmei and snorkeling in the hotel. But after arriving, I found that there was a lot of people checking in. When I arrived that day, it was after 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I completed the check-in procedures first, and the room was still not cleaned until 3 o'clock. Checked in for me for 3 nights, let me talk about some feelings comprehensively:
Although it is not a parent-child hotel, there is also a parent-child activity room, but there are few things, and it is not very playable for children over 6 years old. The activity room carpet looks very old, and there is a musty smell in the space. People who are allergic to mites are advised not to go. My family only went there once to pass the time while waiting for the room. I put a mask on the child the whole time, and I took the child away after staying for half an hour.
The swimming pool has relatively less traffic, the water quality looks clean, and there is a circulation device. Every day, the staff are seen salvaging floating objects, and children must go there every day. Next to it is a children's pool with sand, which is very shallow. I don't know if this is because there is sand in it, it doesn't look very clean. In terms of details, both the swimming pool and the hot spring provide drinking water by the pool for guests, which is more humane. There are also public sunscreens and sprays provided in the hot springs.
The buffet dinner in the water pavilion is free for children under 1.2 meters. It is the most cost-effective place in this place where the per capita consumption is high. The food variety is also very rich. However, it is not recommended for people who are afraid of heat. The seaside scenery is really beautiful, and the heat is really hot. Eat while eating Khan, the meal starts at 6:30, one big and one small. At 7:30, take pictures and get back to the room after eating.
The housekeeper, Sally, added V one day in advance, and the service attitude and efficiency during the stay were very good and fast. Because of the musty smell in the room (later I learned that it seems that old hotels along the coast have this phenomenon), the guest room was notified to take lily flowers for physical deodorization. Including some other living needs and scheduled itineraries, sister Sally can arrange it for us immediately. On the last day, because the child was still in the swimming pool, it was too late to check out, and we applied for a one-hour delay. Before leaving, the children were very happy with the check-out gift.
It is a pity that the spa was not available on this trip. On the one hand, the spa coupons given are limited and must be fully charged for a single item to be deducted, which is a bit dishonest. I bring my baby alone and want to participate in the parent-child spa together. The total number of items for the two of us must exceed a thousand, but it just doesn’t work. There are manicure programs for children, but the spa staff suggested that children get a massage during the consultation, which means just applying nail polish, and the staff are better at massage. Can the tasteless project of children's nail art be removed from the project?
Finally, it is inconvenient to take out food. Food cannot be delivered to the room. If there are many people traveling, people can be allocated, so we can only order expensive food to be delivered to the room.
The snorkeling project was not experienced due to natural reasons such as the water level during the stay, but this is completely understandable, and water entertainment should be carried out based on safety.

The housekeeper Jingran Kiki added WeChat in advance to understand my various needs. She also helped coordinate and upgrade the room because the room was not cleaned that day when I checked in. Later, she also helped to book beach self-service and travel photography in advance. I have children and the elderly with me, and the room service staff are always paying attention. Drinks and toiletries are replenished in a timely manner, and their attitude is very enthusiastic. Every staff member will take the initiative to say hello, and the service is considerate. We live very comfortably in Mandarin Oriental. Moreover, the hotel environment is good and there are not many tourists, which is very suitable for leisure and vacation. I really recommend it. I stayed for three nights this time. If I come to Sanya next year and come to Mandarin Oriental, I will stay for a few more days!

Compared with the noise and noise in those two bays, Mandarin Oriental is quieter, more comfortable and more suitable for vacation. The hotel facilities are also very complete. It is also very convenient to go out and take a taxi to eat. I live in a military zone. There is also an inexplicable sense of security. The housekeeper qiqi added WeChat before check-in, helped me arrange the room in advance, gave me meticulous care, and made our whole family feel at home. But everything is full but there is a shortage. Let’s talk about the shortcomings. Since the guests in the room need electric cars to pick up and drop off, the transportation capacity is obviously insufficient during the summer vacation. I and other guests have encountered the problem of waiting for a long time and cannot arrange the car. The weather in Sanya is suddenly rainy and sudden The sun, children and the elderly exposed to the sun or exposed to heavy rain, the collapse can be imagined, the manager Jacky gave me four coconuts, maybe they have seen this kind of situation a lot, it is no surprise, but this situation still affects the stay For the experience, I hope Mandarin Oriental will get better and better, and I will stay again next time.

msg:Different from the modern design sense of Internet celebrity hotels, mo is a hotel that integrates with nature. In my heart, it deserves the first place in Sanya's public area. When paddling, you can see corals in the sea, stone-carved coconut groves, swimming pool gardens, Worth spending a day wandering around.
If you want to really experience Sanya mo from the room, you must book from the Haizitou room. After watching a lot of videos, the room will be upgraded in the off-season, but the Dragon Boat Festival is too hot, and all the Haizitou rooms in mo are booked. This time, I booked the Sea Breeze Pavilion one month in advance. I chose a room with a good view, opened the curtains, and faced the sea. I could hear the sound of the waves even when I was sleeping. Even if I lay on the balcony all day, I didn’t feel bored. Wentao Pavilion downstairs is more convenient, and you can walk to the beach in a minute, but I prefer Haifeng Pavilion, which can take into account privacy and landscape.
After staying for three nights, every turn-down will surprise me with diptyque body lotion and sunflower hair clips. Butler service can arrange everything, battery car spa and water sports, just let me know on WeChat. The battery cars will say hello when they pass by, and the other staff are also responsive. The most popular buffet and Haijiao Restaurant must be ordered in advance by calling. It is a pity that I didn’t eat it this time.
I was given a surprise when I left the store. In order to make up for the regret of not collecting the room card when I went to Pudong mo, I asked in the lobby on the third floor if I could take the room card as a souvenir when I checked out, and immediately picked a new one. My room card was given to me, as well as mo little squirrel doll and ballpoint pen. While waiting for the bus, I also asked where to buy Sanya MO’s folding fan. The duty manager, Ms. Kiki, knew that I was a fan and went to get Sanya MO’s goldfish folding fan for me. Fortunately, I didn’t get on the bus soon. Thank you again Miss Kiki!
There are many top luxury hotels in Sanya, but if I go to Sanya for vacation again, mo is still my first choice.

msg:The hotel environment is very good, it feels like Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Thailand, and the room is very large;
There are many corals and fishes and small crabs on the beach, and many children like it very much;
But this time my check-in experience was not good.
Let me talk about the praise first, the housekeeper Kennys and the two technicians in the spa are very enthusiastic and serve well.
Bad: There are big problems in the communication among the overall staff of the hotel, and there are a lot of slots. To say a few unbelievable things, the hotel cotton swabs are moldy... Go to the "snorkeling center" for snorkeling, the changing room is a toilet....
These two places are impressive; I waited for more than an hour to get the room, finally got to the room, and waited for another hour for the luggage; the housekeeper still apologized very thoughtfully, and we are not difficult guests (too bad to say) It's a pity that this hotel, no matter how good the environment is, how beautiful the service is, if the equipment is not perfect, it will not go far

Facilities: OK
Hygiene: OK
Environment: very good

msg:I have been to Sanya so many times, and I have always had reservations about Dadonghai. Choosing Mandarin Oriental is a recognition of the hotel brand. After staying in this hotel, I feel that this hotel is the right choice. Exclusive access to the beach, shaded by green trees, clear sea and fine sand, meeting all the elements that a resort hotel should have. The dolls who finished the high school entrance examination experienced snorkeling, went to the sea, had a good time playing, and were more satisfied as parents on vacation.
    Mandarin Oriental's service is always worth recommending. After check-in, the exclusive butler Jason (Wang Mingxuan) takes care of our needs in advance, but it doesn't make people feel nagging, and the speed is well controlled and very attentive.
    In short, the choice of the hotel has been well received by the wife and daughter, and I look forward to the next vacation.

The attitude of each service staff is very good, especially the housekeeper Lyndi is responsive and heart-warming. Wechat messages are replied in seconds. They also gave us two large fruit plates. Because of the sea fishing time, they also helped us apply for a late check-out. It was a good start for this trip. I will come again in the future. I will definitely stay a few more nights next time. Sea projects can be played for several days!

msg:The housekeeper, Ms. Jessica, arranged the dream high-rise sea view room one day in advance. You can overlook the sea without leaving the room. Because I said in advance that I will go on my honeymoon. As soon as I entered the room, I saw rose petals made of love, and there was a whole bouquet of roses on the bed. On the second day, I also sent a small celebration cake in the head vase, which is super delicious and has a strong black taste. My favorite hotel, Haijiaoxuan, the invincible sunset barbecue. The swing on the beach is a good place to be in a daze. Little Chaos was very pleasantly surprised and praised the battery car for connecting in a timely manner every time. They would ask me if I need a car when I meet them on the road. I also like that the hotel toiletries are all made of bamboo to match the overall style of the hotel. The only fly in the oin**ent of the holiday a**osphere is that the loofah may be due to climate or storage environment problems. The musty smell is very obvious. Because we want to use it too strongly, we wash it with body soap three times and let it dry on the balcony before it becomes fragrant. You can add a suggestion. It is estimated that the plastic film and the like can be avoided. Everything else is very good. We played a lot of water sports and snorkeled and saw a lot of corals and small fish haha. Looking forward to seeing you next time

msg:Needless to say, the hotel environment, the Southeast Asian garden landscape is really ok, surrounded by mountains and sea, with first-class scenery.
The service is also not bad, especially the service staff who pick up and drop off by battery car, they will greet everyone when they see them.
The housekeeper Teresa is a very enthusiastic girl with good service.
Let’s talk about the not-so-good aspects. First, there is no elevator in the room type, and you need to go up and down three or four floors to travel. This is very unfriendly to guests with babies and the elderly. The second is that there are no baby strollers. As a five-star hotel, I think it really shouldn't be. The third is that there are very few places to eat light meals, and there is nothing to choose if you want to eat something at two or three in the afternoon.

❤️Landscape: There is a very beautiful coastal road outside the hotel. The beaches, lawns, phoenix trees, and swimming pools in the hotel are all very beautiful ~ the transparent blue is beautiful under the sea water sun!
❤️Service: As soon as you get off the bus, you will feel the professional, warm and friendly service. The younger brother in the concierge depar**ent will help you pick up the luggage, and the younger sister will give us a welcome necklace. There is a welcome drink to relieve the heat at the check-in office. My favorite is to take the battery car hh, it’s a bit like a hidden project, when sending off other guests, you can also enjoy a wave of scenery ~ sitting at night has a feeling of traveling through the jungle!
❤️Room type: We booked Cuiyuanxuan, the room is just behind the swimming pool and the breakfast dining area, very convenient ~ welcome fruit and minibar to relieve the heat!
❤️Recreational items: snorkeling, paddle boards, and sailing boats need to be booked earlier in advance. I didn’t experience it this time, so I’ll try it next time!
❤️Location: Not far from Sanya Yacht Club, the first market and other places; we went there by car, the parking lot is sufficient, and overall it is more convenient. Non-self-driving taxis may have to wait for a while.
❤️ Meals: I was too tired after surfing on the first day, so I ordered room delivery. The spaghetti and burgers tasted good. There are many varieties of breakfast buffet! The quality is also better!

msg:After comparing countless hotels, I decided on Mandarin Oriental with trepidation. The comments on the Internet say that the room is very old, and I was worried that the elderly and children would be dissatisfied before the trip. Before I checked in, the housekeeper contacted me and arranged for me two rooms in the Sea Breeze Pavilion on the first floor. When you walk out of the room, you will see the sea and the swimming pool next to it.
The food is better than expected, and the breakfast is quite rich. In terms of service, the staff is also very enthusiastic, calling for a car is also very fast, and they take the initiative to help. The service personnel maintain a comfortable service distance, but are responsive. There are many swimming pools, and the children had a great time. They said they would go swimming every day, and they also experienced the slides that slide down from high places.
The room is indeed old and cannot be compared with the brand new hotel decoration, but it is better than the view.
I was given a travel photo when I checked in. I am very satisfied with the finished film. It is true that the scenery is great and there are few people. The film is very good, and the photographer is also very dedicated.
Special thanks to Jing Rankiki, the housekeeper, for helping to reserve a room, check in early, send welcome snacks, answer various questions, and sometimes even give the children a little MO squirrel. Very dedicated and caring~ Ctrip platform booking is very reliable, I want to come next year.

The public area of ​​MO is really invincible! ! ! Don’t you have the feeling of vacation in Southeast Asia? ! The travel photos I gave are not bad, in short, they are definitely better than my husband’s photos. The most surprising thing is the spa, the Southeast Asian method, which is very, very comfortable!
My husband went to experience snorkeling. Now the water is not particularly clear, but there are still a lot of them.

I live in the sea view pavilion with swimming pool, the scenery is invincible! The room is a bit old, and the pool outside the room is not as clean as the pool in the public area, but it is good for taking pictures. The room is generally comfortable and clean, and it is the off-season now, and there are not many people.

In terms of restaurants, Yiyang Chinese Restaurant is the best. The breakfast is quite satisfactory and there are many types. Haijiaoxuan has booked the best location, but the western food tastes so-so. The seafood buffet next to the water pavilion looks very tempting, and I will try it again if I have a chance. The drinks at the sunset bar are delicious~

The overall experience is great, I will come again next time, and I will praise the spa again!

Before I came to Sanya, I also saw a lot of negative comments on Sanya Wenhua, and I couldn’t help but feel a little timid (although other companies at the same level also have different praises and criticisms), after thinking about it, I still feel that I will follow the footsteps of MO faithfully. After checking in, all worries disappeared immediately. Although there are many aspects that are not perfect, they have exceeded my original expectations. The overall feeling is quite good, but the food quality and check-in efficiency are still quite different from other MOs. After all, the main thing of this hotel is the main environment. Some people who care about the new and old decorations also advise not to come. After all, the opening time is there, and the decoration style is Balinese style. It may look old (mainly for those who like to pose for photos), but it is not old It is equivalent to poor, after all, the maintenance and decoration of the house are still in place, and the traces of time are also a kind of charm. The hotel's various services are also in place. Thank you Grace for coming to care about our daily arrangements from time to time; there is also the careful cleaning lady who sent the bookmark in time after seeing that I didn't bring it.

msg:Although there were many hotels in Sanya to choose from before the trip, but after doing some homework, I decided to choose Mo. After all, vacations need some vacation a**osphere. This time I stayed for three nights in two room types. Guanhaixuan can overlook the sea view, but the equipment and decoration in the room are indeed a bit old, but it will make people willing to spend more time in the beautiful public area. On the last day, I changed to Sea Breeze Pavilion. I was pleasantly surprised that it was so close to the sea. There was a large sofa on the balcony that could lie flat, and the hair dryer was replaced with a Dyson. I will consider this room type when I come back in the future. The service staff in the hotel are very enthusiastic, and they will greet you wherever you meet them. The butler Jessica responds to messages in a timely and thoughtful manner. Although it is said on the Internet that the shuttle bus sometimes needs to wait, I can accept it personally. After all, vacations are not just about slowing down. Familiar with the terrain, I prefer to walk and stroll back. After returning home, I was still very surprised to see the beautiful scenery photos on my mobile phone. No matter how avant-garde the design of other hotels is, only MO is integrated with this sea, which makes people linger.

msg:It is probably the worst hotel ever booked in my life. The hotel is more than 2,000 yuan. The experience is extremely poor. The hotel is very old and the sanitation is also very poor. The room smells very bad. It is super scary to enter. The curtains are made of glass on both sides, very dirty, and you can see the patio from above, which is very scary. It’s really not as good as a Samsung hotel. It’s more than 2,000 yuan. It’s like being cheated. I immediately called to ask for a room change. Finally, the manager arranged for us to stay at 0129, which was barely enough. I have to accept it, the shape of this room is not as good as what Xiaohong said, it is also aging, and the small pool in the yard feels deserted, and there is a public toilet in front of it, which is probably also deserted. I didn’t sleep much all night, and the room has Snake, the breakfast is very ordinary, there are too many mosquitoes and flies, the price is very good, the Mandarin is too bad, it is an old-fashioned resort, please read the real reviews, the only satisfaction is that the manager is very willing to solve it question. There are also boys at the front desk who are indifferent, expressionless, and don't know that there are two glass doors on both sides of the room. It is far from Capella and Park Hyatt.

The check-in experience is very good, the hotel environment is good, the privacy is very good, it is very clean, and it is very good to take pictures everywhere. Special thanks to Kennys, the service is very good, and he is very attentive. He helped us coordinate the snorkeling time, let us catch the plane in time, and gave us a gift when we left the store.

￼The hotel is a Southeast Asian-style villa hotel, very close to nature, with a holiday a**osphere. The furnishings are a bit outdated, but it doesn't affect the vacation experience. The private beach has many photo spots for internet celebrities, swings, camping chairs, hammocks, Haijiao Pavilion, etc. The breakfast is very rich. The self-service seafood barbecue on the water side is good, and it is very pleasant to eat while listening to the sound of the waves. Then the personal butler Zora is also very enthusiastic, always waiting for service. On the day of check-in, the hotel lobby will give you a necklace made of coconut shells, which is very beautiful. There is iced Zen tea in the lobby to quench your thirst. ￼In short, the experience is very good. It will be the first choice next time.

It’s very worry-free without having to plan the itinerary. The service is super good, one-to-one butler Serve.
This time I was on a business trip. I was alone without my husband, but the hotel made me feel like I was home and being taken care of in all aspects. My housekeeper, Chen Chuan, was very careful and spoke very comfortably. Thank you very much🙏
There are also girls who are worried about taking pictures. The hotel sent a travel photo. The effect is very good. You can travel beautifully by yourself💪🏻

I have been to Sanya many times, and this is the second time I have stayed at Mandarin Oriental. I have stayed in several hotels in Haitang Bay before, but only Mandarin Oriental can give us the resort a**osphere!
The concierge and health aunts in MO are really proactive and enthusiastic, and the guest service phone is easy to get through, and there is no need to wait so long for breakfast and battery cars! The service manager Joey is also very enthusiastic and enthusiastic!

I originally booked the swimming pool pavilion, but because the room was still being cleaned when I checked in, the room was delayed, so it was a "blessing in disguise" and I lived in a duplex two-bedroom villa with a market price of over 10,000. I am very satisfied with the room upgrade this time. It is great to have a private swimming pool. There are 3 toilets and 4 showers. It is no problem to live with a family. The room facilities are also complete. There are countless drinks in the minibar. evian glass bottle of water. Before leaving, I also gave a small gift. Kenny, the housekeeper, provided a good service, which made the experience of staying this time more complete.

msg:A perfect encounter from two days to a sunny day

I have been looking forward to experiencing Mandarin Oriental, Sanya for a long time, and it rained for two consecutive days when it arrived. I was worried about the experience, but every item exceeded the full score experience. On the last day, the weather was bright and everything was perfect.

The first thing I would like to thank is the housekeeper Teresa: from the communication before check-in to the care during the check-in process, the housekeeper Teresa has always provided very meticulous and appropriate services. We tried our best to meet all our needs and really felt at home. The attitude is friendly but not too intrusive, and at the end he gave a small gift very thoughtfully. Can't describe how grateful I am to her!

The hotel on rainy days has a special flavor, as if you are in a two-season tropical rainforest.
One step at a time, the sea breeze and raindrops are mixed, and even the next two feel very comfortable. I stayed in the Swimming Pool Viewing Pavilion. From listening to the sound of two drops on a rainy day to falling into the swimming pool in the sun on a sunny day, every second is paradise.

I also went to experience The Spa, and every second of the experience was extremely relaxing. All the service staff are very good at serving details with a smile, and they are private and will not be offensive. The entire courtyard of The Spa is so beautiful that there are not many premium spas in China.

All in all the whole trip made one not want to leave the hotel at all. Butlers, restaurant staff, spa, travel photography, all kinds of details make people feel extremely relaxed.
Will definitely come again!

Hotel environment: Exclusively in the Coral Bay area, the privacy is very good, and the overall resort feeling of the hotel is also very strong. Although the booked room is far from the seaside, it is quite good to walk along the coconut forest path.
Hotel catering: In addition to the breakfast for 2 days, I also experienced the seafood buffet in the evening. The food and beverage area can actually be done better, and it lacks some features.
Hotel room: Because the hotel has been in operation for a long time, the room as a whole has a sense of age, but it does not affect the check-in experience. The cleanliness of the service staff, the replenishment of the minibar, and the replenishment of toiletries are all in place in a timely manner.

I came to live here six years ago, and I still can't resist liking the beautiful scenery every step of the way.
Although the room facilities are relatively old. The outdoor environment and independent beach🏖️ are absolutely unmatched by other hotels in Sanya.
Self-help on the waterside beach, the originally romantic dinner was disturbed by a heavy rain and became messy indoors. Everyone is busy moving tableware, tables and chairs, meals.
Snorkeling with children🤿Although the water is very shallow, the children are very happy.
Finally thank you Fiona for the butler service.

It is very rare to have such a quiet place in such a noisy place, which is very Southeast Asian holiday style. The Kennys butler service in guest relations is very good. During the stay in the hotel, she actively responded to the service and responded to every request. Because of the rain, our seaside BBQ self-service barbecue could not go forward. She also thoughtfully helped us change it to the next day. There is really nothing to say about the scenery of the hotel. You can take a large picture of the scenery in every corner. It is considered to be very well protected. It has its own coral reef. Guests staying in the hotel can snorkel and sail in the hotel. The hotel has free Wi-Fi. Dining is very convenient. There is a Chinese restaurant and a noodle bar. The food is very delicious. In the evening, it is very relaxing to have a cocktail at the sunset bar and listen to live music. The singer's voice is very good. I hope to have the opportunity to stay at Mandarin Oriental Hotel Sanya next time~

After check-in, there will be a battery car to send it to the room. If you want to go to a distant place, you can call a car and room
We stayed at Guanhaixuan, the sea view is superb, and it is super convenient to swim right outside the door. The weather in Hainan will not feel humid either. There is a list of hotel activities on the table, you can participate if you have time, some are free and some are at your own expense.
· Swimming pool There are many swimming pools, close to the beach. The infinity pool is very shallow and you can play in the sand pool. You can rent swimming rings for free (Unicorn Bay, Big Pineapple, Big Eggplant, and sand-digging toys can also be rented, and you can also help inflate the swimming rings
· Private beach
Because the hotel is also shaped along the long ***** of the sea, the coastline of the beach is very long and there are very few people. The coastline is surrounded by green trees, deck chairs and hammocks are placed randomly, and I feel like an island owner hahaha
·Dining room
Breakfast - Chinese and Western styles are very complete, as well as Hainan special Luofen, the more

The open-air seaside restaurant has a beautiful view. You must go to have a late dinner. The housekeeper Rena is very responsible for all requests. I will definitely come again next time

msg:Best hotel ever stayed in so far 🏨
There is nothing to say about the service, butler Rena is very caring and quick to reply, and will give pertinent suggestions for various questions~
The hotel is very big, and you have to take a battery car to go everywhere, but the speed is very fast, and the car-calling and driving services are very good
The room I chose was at the sea view angle. After waiting for a while, I didn’t clean it up. I went to the next building to rest and then changed. Although there was a small episode, the lobby is really patient and will help introduce the hotel to the map.
The hotel's breakfast is a highlight. It is very delicate. Most of them are prepared first. The waiter will patiently guide the guests to find a seat. This has already surpassed many hotels in seconds. I strongly recommend the lobster wonton
The room facilities are a bit hard to find, such as clothes rails and plug-in boards. It took a long time to find them. It is recommended to bring a change of clothes when you come here. Most of the clothes here will not be dry.
The hotel is full of scenery. My little regret is that there was fog in the two days I went there. I didn’t see the big sun and blue sky. Otherwise, I should take pictures to look better.
Earl’s travel photography is also a highlight. The service attitude and professional skills are second to none in other hotels. I have been tangled in choosing the film for a long time, and they are all so beautiful.
In short, I highly recommend those who want to come to Sanya. The environment is really good and private, and there are all kinds of facilities. Even the activities need to be booked in advance. If you don’t know anything, just ask the housekeeper. It’s very worry-free and suitable. Couples, girlfriends, family outings
The other thing is to choose the right weather. Seaside projects really depend on the weather. If the waves are big, it is not suitable for snorkeling. You can’t see anything. Paddle boards are still very fun.

Breakfast: rich variety and delicious taste! The western pastry here is my favorite.
If I have to find out the shortcomings of the hotel, it is that there are really few people in the hotel... 😆😆😆

The villa’s room type is great, and the decoration is the type I like, but what I’m not satisfied with is that the air conditioner in the master bedroom makes me insomnia at night. Intermittent loud noise.
Then there is the Lanhaixuan Seaview Suite, which is obviously not as well maintained as the villa, and the cleaning is not very careful. When you enter the door, you can see a huge flattened insect on the wall, and there are blood stains on the walls in other places. But I think the room type is satisfactory, and the air conditioner is also normal. But but! The lawn with phoenix trees in front of the sea view suite has annual meetings/weddings every night during the weekend, so there are many workers building the stage on the lawn from the daytime, the music is loud at 7 or 8 o'clock, and it is time to go to bed at 10:30 in the evening , There are tinkling outside dismantling all kinds of devices... This is too disrespectful to Mandarin Oriental... It doesn't consider the guests who enjoy vacation in the hotel

I am very satisfied with my stay, it's great! All the staff are very enthusiastic, the housekeepers Wendy and Zora are especially good in service, giving people a kind feeling, and they need to be resolved in a timely manner. While admiring the beautiful scenery, I always feel the considerate and tireless service of the butler. I sincerely thank Wendy and Zora!

In particular, the housekeeper Wendy asked about the cold and warm, and gave a lot of help, helping to upgrade the room type.

The breakfast is also very rich, and the buffet by the sea is also delicious. Next time I will choose Mandarin Oriental.

All the staff in the park are very professional and gentle. The small trams pick up and drop off at any time. The design of the entire hotel is also very sophisticated and artistic. The western restaurant is good and worth the money, and the breakfast is also very delicious😋. The guest room is a garden view room. There is a swimming pool and a breakfast restaurant when you go out. The room is very good except that the bed is a little short. The quality of soft drinks provided by the minibar is also very good👌. Next time I come here, I will choose Wenhua again.

msg:I booked two twin rooms with superior garden view in Cuiyuanxuan. I arrived at Wenhua after one o’clock in the afternoon to check in. The place to get off is on the third floor. I have to go to the front desk on the second floor to check in. I checked in when I arrived. There are not many people, but the processing speed is very slow. I booked two rooms of the same type, and I insisted on arranging one on the first floor and one on the third floor, and there is no elevator. I disagree. I asked for the first floor. I am arranged in two buildings respectively, well, then it is easy for me, after a while I looked at the system and changed me to a double bed room and a double bed room, both in the same building and on the first floor, I can Accept it, it's just not packed yet. Let's go to the sunset bar first, have a light meal and drink some water, sit and rest and wait. The wait lasted for two hours. I called at three o'clock and told me that one room had been packed, and I needed to wait for another room. Well, I went to the front desk to get the room card and thought about putting my luggage back. I have received my little sister, and I have changed my brother. This little brother has to adjust the room for me. Now I can't bear my temper. I made the guests wait for more than two hours after half check-in, and the room type will be returned. I have adjusted it several times, don’t sell it if I don’t have a room, or just upgrade me to a better room type and I can accept it. I always want to transfer me upstairs to figure out what’s going on.
Later, I saw that I was not as good at communication as before, so I was given two rooms next to each other and both on the first floor. I had originally booked a room on the first floor, but what does it mean to arrange me upstairs.
Let’s talk about the welcome fruit. In one room, it was delivered to the room at about 6:00 pm. In another room, we returned to the room after 8:00 o’clock after eating the seaside barbecue buffet. We called the housekeeping depar**ent directly to ask what happened. , It was delivered shortly after the phone call.
I just want to talk about the environment, landscape, and travel photos of Mandarin Oriental Sanya, which are really good, but the cleaning efficiency of the rooms is extremely low. The service staff at the front desk are polite, but they don’t have a smiling face. I owe it to everyone. They are like money.
The attitude of the concierge is still very good. Hereby praise 👍
The food at Sunset Bar is pretty good. The barbecue buffet by the sea is just for watching the scenery. The food is not good, so it is not recommended.

msg:Facilities: There are several swimming pools, large and small, in the hotel. There are cooperative sea-going projects, such as sea fishing, snorkeling, paddle boarding, and sailing. The recreation center can play games🎮 There is also a table tennis case where you can play for free, in the hotel It's no problem to play leisurely here for a day or two... I also gave Bojue's travel photography as a gift when I checked in. The photographer was very serious and responsible. After shooting for more than an hour, we finally selected the film and saw that the effect was good, so we bought it separately More than a dozen photos, kept as a souvenir~
Hygiene: I was a little worried after seeing everyone's comments before checking in, but after checking in, I think it is still good. Although there are some traces of time, the room as a whole is clean and tidy ~ an acceptable level...
Environment: It's really suitable for vacation. The whole hotel is a three-story villa area. We are traveling as a couple. We booked Guanhaixuan. You can see the sea when you open the balcony door. You can walk to the seaside not far away. Really Very healing~ There are also a lot of deck chairs on the beach, and there are also some spots that are very good for taking pictures and checking in. I saw a lot of good-looking ladies and sisters taking pictures and checking in📷
Service: All the staff are very polite. Our butler, Fiona, added me on WeChat the day before check-in. All the itineraries and all the problems in the past few days were booked and solved by her. Very helpful She is fast and efficient, and she also answers all questions. Thank you for letting us have a pleasant vacation~ There was no waiting at all when we checked in. We arrived at the hotel after 12 o'clock. We originally wanted to store our luggage, but unexpectedly the staff gave it to us We checked in directly, and because we bought a package for the first night, which was different from the room type we booked separately later, the little brother at the front desk directly helped us upgrade the house for the first night, avoiding us tossing and changing rooms in the middle, really I am very surprised and thankful~ The cleaning sister of the hotel helps us carefully organize the things on the table every time, and even folds our littered clothes neatly. The older and younger brothers of the hotel's shuttle bus are also very nice , and some pick up more times and get familiar with it and chat a few words~
Staying here for a few days is really healing, and I feel very relaxed. I look forward to staying here again next time...

msg:First of all, I must thank the housekeeper Jessica for a very satisfactory stay.
I stayed in the Tianyu Children's Parent-child Hotel for the first two days, and booked the Mandarin Oriental for the next two days. It is a completely different style.
It is more quiet and comfortable, with a feeling of Southeast Asia; I booked a twin room, and they helped me to make a bed. The MiniBar in the room has a lot of water and drinks, and welcome fruit.
Knowing that the baby is staying, I sent a bathrobe, slippers for the little panda, and toiletries🥰.
Children snorkeling were also taken care of very well, and they gave us ham sausage to feed the fish, and the staff kept teasing the child to ask him if he caught any fish~ It was a very special experience, baby.
I asked my baby which hotel he prefers, and he actually chose Mandarin Oriental, he has a good eye 😘

When I left, I also gave the child a small squirrel toy as a gift. In short, it is not necessary to travel with children over 5 years old in a parent-child hotel!

The breakfast is delicious with a lot of variety!

In the end, because I had a lot of items on the return trip, the housekeeper Jessica also helped arrange the express service, which was very considerate.
Sanitation is clean, the environment is pleasant, and the service is considerate. I will stay here again next time.

Keywords: sense of space, sense of comfort, service, scenery

The first is the sense of space. We booked the Swimming Pool View Sea Pavilion, where you can enjoy the private swimming pool in the room, which is very private! When you go out, you can see the sea, and when you open the window, you will see coconut groves, beaches, and oceans...

The second is comfort. When I came to Mandarin Oriental, I felt like I fell into my comfort zone. I tried three restaurants in two days: Yiyang Chinese Restaurant, Haijiaoxuan, and Water Pavilion. They were all great!

The most outstanding thing is the service. Wendy, the housekeeper, added WeChat in advance before checking in. She is very kind! He also helped us book the location of the water pavilion in advance, and the arrangement was proper! From the hotel lobby to the room, you can notify the concierge staff in advance to arrange a car. Basically, you can get there in two or three minutes. Traffic is not a problem!

The hotel has a private beach with unique scenery! You can feel the ebb and flow of the tide every day~ Mandarin Oriental Hotel is really the best choice for leisure and vacation!

Let me talk about the room facilities first: the free drinks in the refrigerator include Starbucks coffee and a large bottle of Evian mineral water, etc. The welcome fruit is a large plate. I live in Guanhaixuan. The room is very large and all the furniture is very high-end!
Let's talk about the service! The service started the day before check-in. The housekeeper added me on WeChat the day before to communicate with me about my needs for the hotel. Special thanks to the housekeeper Wang Zhiyi kennys. Not only is he handsome, he is also very considerate!
Besides the environment: there is only one hotel in Coral Bay, one hotel per bay, one scene at a time, all you can see is beautiful scenery, you can’t get enough of it!
In short, I come to live here every year because I like it so much!

The wind and waves are not big, and I also took a sailboat and paddled a paddle board. Wentao Pavilion is a designated place. Open the door and you will find your private lawn, and then walk a few steps to the beach. It is very convenient to go to the beach. When the children get wet, they can go back to the room to take a shower and change clothes. The butler service is also very good. The housekeeper kiki contacted us on WeChat to understand the needs one day before arriving at the store. After staying in the store, he was even more considerate and enthusiastic. All the requirements were met, and the message was returned within seconds, and the response speed was very fast. Although the facilities in the hotel room are a bit outdated, the flaws are not hidden. The cleaning lady also cleans very carefully.

msg:I have stayed in Wenhua on a business trip for 21 years. It is a pity that I have no time to experience the various entertainment items of the hotel. This time I went on a free trip with my family on my birthday, I was still attracted by the charm of Wenhua after choosing a hotel.

Let me talk about a few projects that I am very satisfied with:
1) I heard that Wenhua's Spa is very good. I happened to have a shoulder and neck problem at the hotel - I arranged it directly that night. I chose the Oriental Rhythm 90-minute detox massage. Great experience!
2) I made an appoin**ent for the hotel's sea fishing and snorkeling experience 🤿 I didn't expect sea fishing to be so interesting! ! This is how I started a new hobby🥰Before going to sea, the coach will carefully inquire about personal physical condition and safety instructions, and teach us the fishing operation method in detail after boarding the boat. Summary of experience, for beginners, one is to try their luck, and the other is to slowly practice the hand feeling. In addition, due to the influence of natural factors such as warm currents and tides in the sea, the size of the fish mouth is also different. After playing for two days in a row, I finally caught 1 🐟, this trip was worth it! ! (Haha, if I experienced this project earlier, I might have to soak in the sea the whole time I entered the store 😂)
I'm not good at snorkeling. . I was a little scared, I was shivered by the fish, and my nervous knee hit the rock 😭 woo woo
3) The Bojue travel photography presented as a gift is very pleasantly surprised by the finished film! Thinking about the late appoin**ent, the time was tight and I almost gave up. The customer service still tried my best to communicate and coordinate the time for us. The photographer teacher was very professional and dedicated. Many poses usually feel like fine art, but they are not. . The filming effect is excellent, haha!
4) There is also a Chinese restaurant to boast about! When going out, I still miss the traditional dishes after eating too much local specialties. I was going to go out, but I was trapped by a heavy rain, so I turned my head and went into the Chinese restaurant. I ordered boiled chicken, pineapple rice, crispy meatloaf, and a soup dish. Except for the taste of mulberry leaf vegetables, I can't accept it. The taste of other meals is very online, which satisfies my homely stomach

Let me talk about some areas for improvement:
1) Diarrhea continued after the first breakfast, and I didn’t feel better until I left the store. I took medicine and suppressed it all the way. I don't know if there is a collision of food attributes, or if the food is not clean, the weather is hot and there are a lot of flying insects, so I have to find a way to keep it fresh.
2) The garden-view room of Cuiyuanxuan I stayed in this time is located on the first floor, and the room cannot be exposed to the sun, so it will be extremely humid and cold. However, this room type should be very comfortable and cool in midsummer. Friends who choose a room can pay attention.

Zora, the housekeeper who stayed this time, was very serious and responsible, and provided timely and effective communication services throughout the whole process👍🏻

Overall, I am very satisfied with this trip! ! Vacation mode is fully relaxed and happy! !

msg:Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Sanya on the tip of your tongue
Vacation in Sanya, only delicious food and beautiful scenery can not live up to it!
In the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Sanya, there is a kind of invincible sea view called backing the mountain and facing the sea to be comfortable and leisurely, and there is a kind of gluttony called enjoying the time from the lips and teeth to the heart. The Mandarin Oriental on the tip of your tongue, the seafood buffet where you can watch the sunset with the sea breeze, the convenient noodle bar...
One-to-one service from hotel butlers
The service quality is very good. When we checked in, Alex chose the best one-bedroom sea view double room in Sea Breeze Pavilion for us. The check-in procedure was simple and efficient, and we highly praised it.
Special thanks to Ms. Jessica, the hotel steward of our trip. She is very nice, beautiful, and thoughtful. The hotel's activities are very well introduced. She helped us book restaurants and various other items when the time was tight. , A few times I asked questions at night, and I could reply in time and arrange them in an orderly manner. If you are on vacation, you must choose this place. I look forward to seeing you next time.
hotel environment
Because the hotel is under the military management of Dadonghai, it is extremely quiet. Whether it is day or night, the hotel has a quiet, lazy, and peaceful feeling. Especially suitable for couples or family vacations. Because the hotel is in Dadonghai, there are many delicious food nearby.
Hotel food:
Chinese restaurant, western restaurant, barbecue, bar, lobby bar, and all-day meal delivery service are still very enjoyable.
Haijiaoxuan, it is recommended to come at sunset in the evening. It provides seafood dishes. You can watch the sunset while eating by the sea. It is a super romantic date.
room design
The room types of the hotel adopt an open space design, allowing the sea breeze and sunlight to enter the room naturally. The all-wooden structure is decorated with a little plant, which is full of island style, and the sea is just outside the door.
Highlights:
One sea, one bay, one hotel, enjoying private beaches and stretching coastlines. Built in a hot garden, the room density is low, and the room is close to the sea. Take the crystal boat floating sponge, the breeze is blowing, and you can still enjoy the hotel beach with the infinity pool facing the sea. It is highly recommended.

The blue sea and blue sky can also completely see the orange sunset
 
All of a sudden, the whole person will shine, sweeping away all the haze and fatigue.

Hotel facilities are a bit old, after all for many years
There is no garment steamer yet, but the scenery is really beautiful and the sea is clear
If the photos are completely ok, the service is considerate and thoughtful. There is a seaside restaurant at night, but if you come to check in, you must make a reservation in advance to avoid missing the queue. The restaurant is very hot and the barbecue tastes great. The Haijiao Pavilion will always be full.

Eating barbecue by the sea and listening to the waves is very romantic.
(Breakfast is just like that, because I may not be able to compare with Sanya in Shenzhen because of regional differences, but Sanya is definitely ok)
 
Oriental culture has its own taste, it will not stick to that kind of modern business, it will wander in some customs

Butler service is also very attentive
 Special thanks to Zhang Wenlin Island for being very considerate

Wenhua is a resort-like hotel with a very slow pace. I was a little worried about the service not being able to keep up with the reviews before coming here, but this time the experience is very good. The battery car will arrive within 5-10 minutes after calling, and the room service efficiency is not bad. Very high, this time I lost something twice in 2 days during breakfast, and the hotel staff quickly delivered it to the room. In addition, the only downside is that the basic condition of the room hardware will be a bit old, but overall it is still acceptable!
In terms of landscape, Wenhua is particularly good, especially suitable for couples or families who are looking for a romantic vacation but are a bit lazy. The scenery is really amazing! Taking pictures is easy, one step at a time, the seafood buffet at the Waterside Restaurant is worth a try, and eating by the sea in the sunset feels so healing. The breakfast at the hotel is also okay. Although there are not many varieties, it is enough to eat. I ate soup and rice noodles for 2 days. It was so delicious! Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Wenhua again!

I went to the front desk to coordinate, and finally Changed to Guanhaixuan (see picture 15 for the scenery), the price is really expensive, but the scenery is also really beautiful. It feels super comfortable to watch the scenery from the balcony~🌴🌴🌴
	
After packing up, go to the beach 🌊 and walk around, then go to the noodle bar to eat noodles 🍜 (about 200 per person), and a 15% tip is required [笑哭R] (see picture 13 for the scenery). The dinner at Haijiaoxuan in the evening is also very beautiful, but it is a pity that it needs to be booked half a month in advance (700➕ per person).
	
Next, I will share my real feelings about staying here🌴
	
⭕️Advantages:
1. The hotel has a private beach, and there are not many people, which meets the needs of sisters to take pictures at will, and is very suitable for couples to stay.
2. The housekeeper will contact me via WeChat one day in advance to understand the check-in needs, and provided a crib and a stroller 👶🏻 according to my requirements.
3. The hotel provides turndown service at night.
4. The refrigerator and water bar in the room are all free. The buffet tastes good.
	
❌ Disadvantages:
1. Check-in at the front desk is slow, I hope this can be improved in the future. Later, when I wanted to change the room, a male service staff at the front desk only said that ➕400 can be changed to a double room, and did not inform that there are other options, but another female service staff said that ➕200 can be changed to a twin room. I don't understand why this low-priced option was missed, and I urged me to let the customers in the future choose first. The service attitude is obviously not as comfortable as Pullman hotels! ! ! The service of the hotel really affects the mood of the holiday! ! !
2. It is understandable that many people complain about the slowness of the battery car, because the hotel is still quite big, and it is not so easy to have several electric cars to meet the needs of all the guests in the hotel. I believe the hotel has done its best. But to be honest, it is really troublesome to take an electric car everywhere, it is not as convenient as walking.
3. There is only one children's playground, and there are no other parent-child activities, so it is not suitable for bringing children.
4. I stayed at the Pullman Sanya Bay Ocean Residence the day before, and the service there is relatively more enthusiastic than the service staff here.
5. The sea next to the hotel belongs to the protected area, so there are many stones on the beach. If you want to feel the feeling of stepping on fine sand, or if your baby wants to dig sand, this place is really not suitable. My daughter likes to play with sand [crying R][crying R][crying R]
6. I saw someone complaining about the old room, but I personally think it’s okay, as long as it’s clean.
	
✅Finally, the scenery is good, but next time you bring your baby, you should not come here, and you will choose a hotel with more parent-child activities.

However, there are also areas for improvement: there are too few power plugs in the room, and boiling water must be placed on the ground or on the bedside table. There is no parking space in the ba*****t and no signage, so you have to turn around to get out, which is a bit laborious.

Let me talk about the advantages of the hotel. The environment is good, the beach is where you go out, and the place to live is very quiet. There are few people, which is very suitable for rest and relaxation. The hotel adheres to the principle of environmental protection. The toothbrushes and combs in the room are made of wood. Let me talk about the things I was not satisfied with when I checked in. The hotel is a bit When I checked in, I told us that the refrigerator was broken and not cooling. If I wanted to check in, I had to wait, so I didn’t ask for a replacement. After taking a shower at night, I found that there was no hair dryer, but fortunately, it was delivered in time. Once I was looking for a restaurant in the hotel and asked. I saw a staff member who ignored it directly. I don’t know if I didn’t hear it. Overall, I’m satisfied. If I come next time, I will still choose it. Finally, I will post the most satisfactory photos.

Hygiene: The housekeeping depar**ent cleans very promptly. Every time you go out for a meal or take a walk, the guest room is always clean, and the refrigerator is full of drinks.

Environment: The overall Southeast Asian theme style, there are a lot of photo spots, and the film is also very good. It is very suitable for taking a leisurely stroll in the hotel.

Service: Sanya’s luxury hotel service is the best. It’s not a bragging point. I’ve stayed in so many hotels, including Cape, Bai, and Eddie. Culture Oriental’s service is the most considerate, whether it’s the early communication with the housekeeper Zora before check-in, asking about needs, or I waited for my wife and I in the lobby in advance, immediately arranged luggage and hotel check-in, and the hotel explanations were very detailed and enthusiastic. The hotel was also like Baidu in the process of living, and immediately provided answers. Although it is our first time to visit the culture, the hotel All the important experiences are experienced in place. Just like an old friend for many years (Huang Weiqiang at the front desk is also very nice. When he saw that we had pregnant women staying, he immediately arranged for a free upgrade of the existing room type to reduce the waiting time.)

Summary: parent-child, parents, vacation, hotel, photo needs, eyes closed.
Everyone has their own preferences in environment and design, but the service ceiling of a luxury hotel in Sanya must be experienced once (again, the butler Zora is highly praised. She is indeed the most thoughtful and careful one among so many hotel butlers. The boss raises salary!)

Over the past few days, I have carefully felt the charm of the fan. The service is very enthusiastic, and the service staff are also very polite and friendly. The scenery of the hotel is also relatively good. As a resort hotel, the overall a**osphere is relatively leisurely. Although the texture of the reef beach is not good, it is also a good choice to lie under a tree or by the pool for an afternoon.
It was said that the room was a little old before I came here, so I was a little worried, but after checking in, I felt that the maintenance was okay, not as exaggerated as I said.
The overall food in the hotel is relatively average, not very amazing, which makes me a little concerned.
During this experience, all the activities in the hotel and the housekeeper Zora did their best to help us, and I really appreciate her. We also gave us souvenirs when we checked in. In short, I recommend everyone to come to Sanya to experience this hotel.

On the second day, I decisively increased the money and upgraded to Haifeng Pavilion, and I felt comfortable immediately! 2. I accidentally hurt my foot in the room and it was bleeding.

I called one day in advance and said that there was no news about the butler adding WeChat. I went to the front desk to ask for an addition on the day of checkin, but the butler was not there. But you can sit when you go out, and you can accept a small queue for breakfast. The invincible scenery of the hotel is enough to offset these small problems!

The old-fashioned holiday style can stand the test, and the environmental service is impeccable. Sanya, which is crowded during the Spring Festival, has nothing to do with us.

msg:Super five-star praise, very suitable for family outings. I read other people's comments before the trip, saying that the room is old and the sand is not fine enough compared to Yalong Bay. The personal test is completely too picky. First of all, the room is new and old. For a hotel with a Southeast Asian resort style, it is actually difficult to feel the new and old of the room. It is simple and quiet, in my aesthetic point of view; besides, the sand, the advantage here is not the beach. After all, swimming in the sea in winter is also quite difficult. The key is It’s a lot of fun to catch the sea on the reef. We were around 7:00 in the morning, and the people together caught fish, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, pippi shrimp, and starfish. When we moved a piece of reef, there were shells with hermit crabs everywhere. The children were very happy ! Let’s talk about the advantages, it’s quiet, very quiet, which wins my heart. The noisy environment in Bialong Bay is much better; the swimming pool is very good, with few people, so you can swim freely. There are also many considerate services, such as free-flowing refrigerators, on-call battery cars, towels that can be picked up at any time, and sea fishing, snorkeling, sailing and other sea projects in the store (of course, additional fees are required), which can solve the initial stage of children's sea projects. The basic needs of the experience make it very relaxing for adults to swim in the hotel. If you mainly focus on leisure, looking at the sea, swimming, and catching up with the sea, it is worth staying again and again. In addition, there is a cdf in the hotel. You can spend all your time resting. It is very thoughtful. We stayed in the hotel for two days and did not leave the hotel. It was a very comfortable vacation.

Before getting off the plane, the butler Kennys contacted me and was ready to welcome us at any time. It was really warm and safe. On New Year's Eve, I ordered the tomahawk steak set meal at Haijiaoxuan. The chef is very professional, and the dishes taste great. Of course, the most important thing is the sunset view at Haijiaoxuan. The room Kennys arranged for us is also very good, you can spend your vacation by lying in the room. Wenhua’s service for the whole four days is very delicate. The battery car is on call, so you don’t worry about getting lost or getting tired. It is very friendly to the elderly. My mother caught a cold and had a fever. Kennys quickly sent several large bottles of Evian mineral water, which was very touching. Although many Sanya people and most of the hotel rooms are full during the Spring Festival this year, I was worried that they would not be able to keep up with the service. Now we can see that Wenhua has maintained a high level of response as always. Compared with the Ritz-Carlton we live in now, it is better. There are too many, especially for the housekeeper. Liz's response is much slower. Kennys also gave us two small gifts when we left the store. In short, Mandarin Oriental is worth it! There are many things to share that I won’t list here, everyone must come and experience this place full of vacation feeling.

The hotel is backed by the mountains and faces the sea. Each room is a single-family villa. The environment is very good and quiet. There is nothing to say about the scenery. Every shot is a big movie. The hotel has a private beach. It is very convenient for children to play in the water. Take pictures It is especially good when there are few people in the scene.
        The hotel cooperates with Earl Brigade. Each family can send five photos and one video. The one who took the photo for us was a little brother. He is not very old, and he took the photos very professionally. He took dozens of photos, and I feel reluctant to delete them all. , I just gave up and chose 40 pieces. The young lady who accompanied us in the selection was very patient and even gave me a table set. I am really satisfied. Finally, it is recommended to bring a few more sets of clothes when taking pictures. It will be a surprise and the effect will be super awesome👍🏻

Sailing is essential for going out to sea, and Bojue travel photography will leave unforgettable memories for the whole family (thanks to photographer Zhang Bidong).

msg:First review because I was pissed off. When we arrived at the hotel, there was no doorman to guide us. My friend walked to the door and the platform waiter asked if he was staying. He didn’t take the initiative to pick us up, and then called us to go to the second floor to check in, and no one showed us the way. It is understandable that the room did not come out during the peak season after check-in, but no one came to help us with our luggage, nor did we introduce where we could rest, and we didn't even have a welcome drink, just in the lobby. Is this the welcome service of a 4000+ resort hotel? Two points for service here.
Then the hotel cooperated with the outside world to shoot travel photos. It’s so simple. I almost exploded. You want to take a quiet vacation and watch the sea blowing in the evening breeze. There are countless photographers shouting in front of you, all over the hotel. I may not be there. The top resort hotel, did I arrive at the photography base? Therefore, one point for the environment is not for the geographical location but for the experience of the entire environment. Share the video for everyone to experience. You can take pictures, but as a resort, is the experience of guests more important?
Then it feels like the peak season, probably the hotel has recruited a lot of new people. They are not familiar with the business, and they can’t even find the location of each part of the hotel. We have to ask a few people to get the destination. It takes two or three calls for room service to be answered. I think such an expensive hotel service should keep up with it?
In addition to the bad experience of welcoming guests, the attitude of other waiters is still very good, I hope to keep it. The hotel spa must be praised, the technique is very good, almost dreaming back to Thailand. The location of the hotel is also unique, very beautiful. The food in the Chinese restaurant is delicious.

msg:Very good hotel, the service is very good, the hotels in Bialong Bay and Haitang Bay are much higher. Mandarin Oriental deserves full marks for its resort feel, garden design, service professionalism, decoration taste, and interaction with the sea. The only downside is the sandy beach. The Haijiaoxuan buffet dinner has a great environment and is delicious, but the price is slightly expensive. There have been a lot of check-ins recently, and the average response time of room service is 15 minutes. I hope it can be improved. Thank you for upgrading to the Wentao Room on the first floor when you checked in. You can go to the sea when you walk out of the lawn at the door in the early morning. The sea water is clear, and you can see fish even when snorkeling. will come again

Many views are covered by trees, so it is a pity that I did not see the complete sea. There is also waiting when checking out The car waited for a long time (hope it will be more efficient in the future). In addition, I would like to praise the travel photography company in the hotel (the photographer and the team are excellent). The SPA experience is not bad~

msg:Before coming to Mandarin Oriental Hotel, I also read a lot of reviews. I know that the hotel has a certain age and the facilities may be a little old, so I have already prepared myself before coming here. After all, it is a prestigious hotel, so I feel at ease, so after coming here, I basically look at the hotel and feel it. This hotel is very good. Although the facilities are a bit old, they are very well maintained. Not so many hotels can do this. Just like a glass of wine, or a nobleman. The hotel's private beach is very private and relaxing. There are hills behind the hotel, which are full of greenery and contrast with the beach. The hotel is very private, the greenery is superb, and the resort style is very strong. I stayed for two nights and lived in different room types, one is a high-rise and the other is a townhouse, each with its own scenery and pleasant feelings. I am very grateful to the housekeeper Jing Ran (KiKi) for his patient and meticulous service, which made me feel the profound charm and heritage of Mandarin Oriental. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay at Mandarin Oriental again.

Either turn down the bed. Or delivery! Still all kinds of services are very considerate. You can feel their understanding is very strong. Butler mia not only gives good service. Good advice will also be given on playing and eating. Think of places I didn't think of. For food, the choice of four restaurants is very good. Must try the bbq! On the beach, listening to the sound of the waves lapping. The sea breeze is blowing! Enjoy unlimited food! You will feel that the people around you are worth it! The hard work is worth it! It's a great charge! Because the body is beautiful. So you will work harder to make your life better in the future!

All kinds of small crabs, snails, and sea eggplants are still very interesting. After picking them up, whether they are released or given to others Everyone can go back to the room to take a rest, go to the hotel entrance to eat seafood at noon, come back to swim and take various photos, dinner can be eaten by the sea, and the bar's live music is very good... This hotel belongs to the kind that you can stay in all the time without getting tired. The most important thing is to thank Zora, the housekeeper this time... It's really great, because there are elderly people, who are doing their best to help the whole process, and are very patient. No matter who encounters such a housekeeper, they will give extra points to the whole stay experience!

The scenery is also very good. The earl travel photo sent by me, Hong Sir is super professional. I feel that none of the pictures I took are ugly.
I recommend Haijiaoxuan's seaside dinner, a very romantic experience, although our day was the coldest day.
Service: Be sure to give the housekeeper Casey a super five-star praise, help arrange and upgrade the room type, respond to every request, and solve problems in a timely manner, soothe the customer's emotions, give her a thumbs up👍
Let's go to sunset, even if the weather is very cold, there are not many guests, there are singers singing in the evening, the singing is very good, the price of drinks is reasonable, the waiter Chloe, the service is also very considerate.
Facilities: The facilities are really old, and the socket at the head of the bed keeps falling off. The toiletries include Diptyque and Oulong, which I like very much, and the drinks served in the mini bar are also of high quality, including Evian, voss, soda water, and Starbucks coffee.
But the slippers are simply the level of the slippers of the Express Hotel. It is really recommended to change them, otherwise it will really lose points. There is also a small screw in the room. I accidentally stepped on my foot, and directly inserted the slippers, which made me hurt. Without Casey's timely communication and handling, I would not have given this good review.

Overall, except for the really old facilities, the breakfast is at an ordinary five-star level, nothing amazing, everything else is really great! Recommend everyone to experience

msg:Originally, I had to bring my family to Wenhua in November before the epidemic was released. Later, due to various reasons, I only came in December. I only booked 4 nights. The scenery is really beautiful, and I booked another 7 nights. My mother liked it very much. The environment of the hotel is secret and clean. It is in the innermost part of the military quarantine zone. It is very safe. The breakfast needs to be ranked because there are many people. There is a service fee. We didn’t know it beforehand. The food tastes good. We also made an appoin**ent for the barbecue buffet in the evening. It’s delicious, but the seaside is too cold. The barbecue is completely cold when the wind blows. I recommend you Let's eat earlier next time, let alone the elderly, my young man's stomach hurts from eating cold barbecue.
 I would also like to thank the butler Casey for her comprehensive and attentive service. She gave the old man freshly baked biscuits and helped us upgrade to a sea view room. I have to say that the view of the sea view room is really beautiful. When you wake up in the morning and open the curtains, you will see the beautiful scenery. The old man likes it very much. . The performances prepared by the hotel on New Year's Eve are also very good, such as concerts, band performances, etc., and the elderly also like it very much. Generally speaking, although the price has increased due to the end of the year, it is still very worthwhile overall. The only thing is that when checking out, I called the front desk to ask the concierge to help pick it up because the box was too heavy. It took five phone calls to get through, and it took a full 40 minutes for someone to come. I understand that the staff is busy. , but let the customer wait for 40 minutes, can we pay attention to the problem of manpower arrangement? In addition, the five travel photos given by this room type are from Bojue. If you want more after the shooting, you have to pay extra. If you think their skills are good and it is suitable to buy a package in advance, the retoucher will sell and buy photo albums when choosing photos. This is one link after another. If we don’t buy it, our attitude will turn 360 degrees. We just didn’t buy a photo album. The photo retoucher I met was Zhang Shan. The customers who selected the photos today all bought photo albums. The tone of the voice clearly felt like finding fault. The old man was very angry. I reported the situation to Bojue’s customer service. The customer service sent me the photos and kept apologizing and explaining. Wake up, this kind of travel photography is all about serial marketing, marketing is not terrible, at least everyone is happy if you have a good attitude, otherwise it will have a bad influence on the guests staying in the hotel. The overall 10-day trip is still very good, and I will consider staying in the next ⛱️ vacation.

Then I stayed for a day and lived in high, and I continued to live for two days. The location, hotel layout, vegetation, and architectural space are all very appetizing. Watching the sunset during the entire Sanya vacation should be better than this one. Thanks to the manager Hanson for the butler service throughout the whole process, and also sent the cake thoughtfully. The seaside sunset barbecue buffet, the content and service are nothing to say, thank you miniee for your thoughtful service. There will definitely be more opportunities in the future.

msg:An extremely bad experience. As a luxury hotel, Oriental Culture has a room rate of 3500+ a day. I want to have a happy vacation, but I have experienced the feeling of being a grandson.

1. [This hotel cannot deliver food! ! ! A few hundred meters away from the room, I have to run to the front desk to get food. Ask the reason, there is no reason, because the hotel does not provide such a service. I wanted to see specific policy adjustments, but was dismissed indifferently. Similarly, the efficiency of the hotel to deliver luggage is extremely low. It is the first time that a guest is rushing up and worrying about the loss of luggage. 】
2. [Managers and employees are uncles. The quality of staff training is extremely poor, and there is no respect for customers. Roll call manager on duty: Guide Liu Andy. The attitude is extremely bad, indifferent and negligent, with no sense of service. He explained that he was unwell and wanted to send some food, but the yin and yang replied strangely: Sorry, if you are "in special circumstances", we will consider it as appropriate. Co-author Am I lying to you? ? ? ? I still need your approval to be unwell? ? ? ? 】
3. 【Where is the so-called butler service? Before and after check-in, there is no butler service, everything is a "buffet"]
4. [The first time I met a five-star hotel and waited for 30 minutes for breakfast! ! Chaos is like a big box store. 】
5. [The room facilities are old, and the infrastructure in the hotel is chaotic, especially the beach and other places, which are very rough, and discarded garbage can be seen, which is obviously old and lacks maintenance. 】
6. [The hotel did not notify customers on the New Year's Eve, and began to rehe**** the extremely rustic outdoor New Year's Eve performance from the afternoon. Outside the lobby, temporary wires were piled up, and the people present were miscellaneous, and the layout and items were piled up in a mess. Even though the performance was past 12 o'clock in the morning, there was always a super loud external sound, the sound was deafening, the DJ's selection of songs was extremely unpleasant, and the music was completely earthy, which seriously affected the rest of the guests. 】

msg:It is very correct to choose Mandarin Oriental in Sanya this year. I think people who understand life must understand the goodness of MO. Bill Bensley's sustainable design concept allows people to have the opportunity to integrate with nature, surrounded by green trees, there are seven or eight trees growing freely around a seaside rocking chair🌴🌳, and the phoenix flower tree in the town store, the image extremely beautiful.

Walking to the water pavilion in the morning, the staff will say "good morning" in a friendly manner, enjoy a rich breakfast in a pleasant a**osphere, go for a walk on the beach after the end, bring a book to enjoy in the sunshine ☀️, next to the waves 🌊, and live in the world for a long time The tired body and mind can be cleared up and calmed down in one morning.

The lunch in the noodle bar and the Chinese restaurant each have their own characteristics, but the waiter’s kindness remains unchanged. When I was eating at the Chinese restaurant, I asked if the coconut meat in the coconut rice was edible, and warmly brought me a small bowl of coconut meat. I ate it while eating. Imagine it gathers energy and grows day and night by the sea.

This time, the body and mind were not in the best condition, so I couldn't overcome the fear of snorkeling in the sea, but thanks to the coach and housekeeper Jessie for their patience and guidance, the signs to protect the coral were also very impressive. Whether it is a cloudy or sunny afternoon, Coral Bay has its own beauty, with dark clouds above the head, waves of waves in front of the eyes, and mountains in the distance lying on their sides and sleeping. At that moment, people seem to be finally connected with heaven and earth. If I have to say regret, it is that the boundary of the scenery is clearly visible, and I wonder if there is a more magnificent place.

During the seaside barbecue, Brother Lobster kept telling everyone in line that there were many more, all of them, and the scene was hilarious. The dinner at Haijiaoxuan is indeed a highlight moment, no filter is needed, and the changing sky and dusk can't be enough to take pictures, it is extremely beautiful. The hotel boy from Switzerland is probably a dedicated and professional manager who pays attention to everything and does it himself, which is impressive. He said that he has been in China for four years.

The turndown service was very good. One day when I returned to the room, there was a card on the wooden tray, asking us about the type of pillow we are more used to, and the silk interlining under the cosmetics. The waiter was reluctant to mention these details.

Before I came here, I saw some sayings about the old hotel rooms. After I moved in, my personal feeling is that I love such a simple and natural style, throwing away all unnecessary complexity, leaving logs, fabrics and artworks to the end, which is infinitely close Life is true. When I woke up in the morning, the trees and the blue sky came into view outside the window, and the beginning of the day was very good. The stone carvings of the hotel also have the color of ancient civilization and modern mischievous design, with different expressions and movements. With the garden design, it can make people slow down and return to their hearts. If I want to write a long-planned novel, I will definitely choose to live here for a long time, get along with myself, and let nature breed inspiration.

Special thanks to Jessie, the housekeeper, who made reservations for seaside dining, shuttle bus, and warm reminders every day. She is professional and friendly. The shuttle bus service inside the hotel is also very convenient, and the waiters who drive are very polite.

Suggestion: The front desk can prepare some small bottles of drinking water for guests to carry when they go out.

msg:I am very grateful to Mandarin Oriental for providing me with such an excellent experience on my first stop in Sanya.
As a veteran luxury hotel opened in 2009, Mandarin Oriental did not give me any bad feelings because of its "oldness". The picturesque scenery and the warm and considerate service made me ignore some shortcomings in the details. The hotel has a strong sense of design. The Southeast Asian-style garden design, excellent swimming pool view, and ultra-low room density all give me a strong sense of exclusive experience.
The hotel's snorkeling project is strongly recommended. Compared with summer and winter, the water is slightly muddy, but there are still relatively clear sea water with fish swimming around. Explore in the sea as you like, and the feeling of dancing with fish still beats all the "deep diving experience" packages in Sanya.
Speaking of catering, the lobster barbecue buffet by the sea is not cost-effective based on the variety of dishes, but the excellent products and the sunset view by the sea make me feel that it is worth the money. Although the lobster is not live and grilled, I personally feel that it is killed and steamed at noon and grilled at night. After all, it is impossible for guests to wait too long for self-service. The steak is produced in a cafeteria, the grilling level is stable, and different batches can be perfectly cooked, and the sirloin in the buffet is still full of milk flavor.
Although the family swimming pool is not open, you can see the water slides, the poolside beach, and the water slides cleverly set up in the excellent garden can bring children a wonderful experience of jungle adventure.

msg:Really irresistible to his scenery!
The butler, Ms. Jing Ran, is really nice and considerate.
Master Zhou Wei is still so diligent
Living in Wenhua now really feels like coming home.
The fly in the oin**ent is that this time, just as Rolls-Royce is doing an event, the third-party planning company hired occupies the beach, and the security guards are scattered all over the hotel, not only disheveled, but also always restricting the movement of guests. Putting up a table and continuing construction feels like it will damage the hotel's brand image. During the mask period, I have stayed in your hotel so many times, and I can really feel the hotel's persistence and hard work. It is not easy to receive an event. With the mentality of mutual fulfillment, guests can understand more and feel the helplessness of the hotel to the third party. I hope the hotel will do its best to ensure the safety of the guests during these two days. Privacy and Security.

Dining in the Chinese restaurant, the restaurant waiter Xiaomei is very professional, and the food tastes good, but the food selection is a little bit small.

The room type 0110 also has a small pavilion. It is highly recommended. Only 6 rooms share a large private pool. There are not many people in the off-season now, which is equivalent to contracting this swimming pool ~ the facilities are not old as mentioned on the Internet.
The service of our butler Jingran Kiki is very good. He gave us a lot of fruit drinks and souvenirs~ The reply was very fast and met our needs in a timely manner. The experience of the butler service is very good. I hope that next time I have the opportunity to stay, I can meet such a good butler as Jing Ran Kiki.

The dinner experience at Haijiaoxuan is also very good. Although it did not catch up with the sunset, it is still beautiful.

msg:When I came to Sanya before, I usually chose Yalong Bay or Haitang Bay, but I didn't pay attention to the Mandarin of Coral Bay. I heard that Mandarin is the most resort-like hotel in Sanya, so I decided to try it for two days.
Before arriving in Sanya, the hotel arranged for housekeeper Emily to contact me. Not only did they arrange a birthday room and sent a birthday cake, they also upgraded my room and gave me macaron snacks the next day. It was really sweet~ The spa and water sports were introduced to me in great detail!
Wenhua's garden design is excellent. The swimming pool, restaurants, and swings on the beach are all blockbusters, as if you are in Southeast Asia. If you want to stay in a hotel, this is the right place to choose.
In the evening, I am a fan of the small beach bar. You can listen to songs, order songs, and sing by yourself, all for free. Stayed for another day.
At five o'clock in the morning, I also encountered a starry sky.
Next time I bring my family, I will choose Mandarin~

msg:This is the seventh Mandarin Oriental that I only remember after Geneva, Lucerne, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Hong Kong Land. The service of Mandarin Oriental will never disappoint. The housekeeper Casey gave full care, and the concierge depar**ent The spa services in the guest room depar**ent, catering depar**ent, and the front desk work are also very efficient. The pool service is warm and thoughtful, but the efficiency of connecting services with the catering depar**ent can be improved (after all, ordering food and drink by the pool should be a common demand), and the services in the recreation depar**ent It was a little bit worse (I went to Kangle to ask what time period is suitable for snorkeling when the tide is high every day. The dull Kangle front desk answered irrelevant questions, and finally told me that this is an uncontrollable natural factor. Finally, I checked the tide level on Baidu. Maybe it’s because I don’t need their snorkeling coach service, so I don’t even want to tell me the time. Snorkeling is the biggest selling point of this hotel. It’s a big failure if you can’t do this basic tip well)

This is the hotel with the best snorkeling quality in China that I have stayed in. It is better than Park Hyatt Sunny Bay. There are many colorful fish and live corals on the beach. It is low tide now, so snorkeling can only be done before 10 am every day. By noon the water level was too shallow. Every night and morning, fishermen cast nets outside the hotel beach to catch fish secretly. When snorkeling, you can see many beautiful fish swimming and hitting the net to die.

The rooms are quite big, but not designed, people who are expecting a room may be disappointed. The breakfast is good, but the products of other catering are average. Don't expect too much, but it is understandable that even the chefs of the top Hainan hotels are generally not top-notch.

Generally speaking, this is a top choice among domestic seaside resort hotels (depending on personal needs, I have high requirements for snorkeling, so I will not choose Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay).

I really like this patchwork layout design. Along the private coastline, you can stop and enjoy the small scenic spots everywhere. You can sit or lie down, close your eyes, listen to the waves, and enjoy the sea breeze. Because it's not peak season, the occupancy rate is about 50%. It's very comfortable and suitable for a quiet vacation～
Of course, I was very lucky to meet our butler Kennys, who is warm and decent, thoughtful and meticulous. Every communication on WeChat is quite timely and effective, which greatly improves the comfort of this hotel experience. Thank you for his reception these days, and look forward to meeting with Oriental culture again~

Before moving in, prepare buckwheat pillows for the elders intimately, like! Due to a problem with the nucleic acid test at the previous hotel, he was given a yellow code and stayed for an extra night.

At the same time, I would like to thank Steven, the night shift manager that night, who helped me consult the airport and the epidemic prevention office, and gave us a lot of care. Thank you very much! The hotel is not old and well maintained, the rooms are clean and tidy without dust. Thanks also to my colleagues who helped us catch geckos at night, and let us sleep peacefully. Chinese and Western restaurants are very delicious, which is rare. Sunset Martini at Sunset Bar, please try it! The service attitude, awareness and quality of all staff are outstanding. Unforgettable vacation experience!

The hotel is equivalent to wrapping up a mountain. When the car drives in, it is still a noisy world outside, and it is like entering a private world. The swimming pool is very beautiful, and the private beach is also beautiful. After checking in, there was a little episode. Fortunately, Alex, the front office manager, helped to solve it in time and was very considerate as our housekeeper throughout the journey. They also gave us a super delicious afternoon tea at Sunset Bar. He also helped us upgrade the super-beautiful water pavilion and late check-out, so that I, who liked Ge You to lie down when I went out, felt comfortable and refused to leave. Room service is very good. At the beginning, the shuttle service was a bit slow, but it was improved immediately after it was proposed, and the breakfast service was also improved very nicely. The ZANA service in the Chinese restaurant is great. Thank you Alex and the other enthusiastic staff for making our vows journey a smooth one.

After learning that we originally planned to depart from Shanghai, he promptly reminded us to pay attention to the measures to prevent and control the epidemic in Sanya, and helped us inquire about the epidemic prevention policies of the community where the hotel is located. Finally, we set out from Wuxi. Arrived in Sanya smoothly.

Sanya MO is very suitable for vacation, sitting on an exclusive bay, away from the hustle and bustle of the city and commercial a**osphere, suitable for relaxation.

Service: The hotel staff were very friendly and upgraded our room type after knowing that we were here for our honeymoon. Especially our housekeeper, who not only helped us arrange honeymoon arrangements, make restaurant reservations, but also gave us welcome fruits and desserts, etc.~

Facilities: According to the reviews, the room facilities are a bit old. I think it's okay, it's easy to use. My husband and I pay more attention to hygiene, which Mandarin Oriental has done very well. There are also many types of MiniBar in the room, including Starbucks, sparkling water, coconut juice, etc.

Environment: The water in Coral Bay is really very clear! It's a pity that the days we stayed there were not beautiful, and we didn't have the opportunity to go to the sea to play.

We also experienced the SPA in the hotel this time, 60min is a bit short, I suggest you choose 80min if you go~

Facilities: Before I came, I heard that the facilities of the MO room in Sanya were old, but after I checked in, I found that it was the design of this wooden structure that made me return to the seaside resort in Southeast Asia in a second.

Hygiene: There are 1-2 room cleaning services every day, and there will be a special service for turning down the bed at night. When you return to the room after a tiring day, you will see the opened corner of the bed, the slippers placed by the bed, and the dim light suitable for sleeping. The lights are really annoying

Environment: Hidden in the urban area of Dadonghai, it is very convenient to travel. The water quality and beautiful scenery of Coral Bay make people feel happy.

For example, there are no women’s products that can be provided in an emergency; when the recreation center called to ask about the snorkeling time, they kept saying that they were not sure, and they didn’t say that they could confirm the call. As a result, they missed snorkeling and made three calls, like a ghost hitting a wall. The service staff mechanic is like a robot, only the restaurant is better.

The environment, sanitation and environment are very good. If you give up the obsession with the level of advance and retreat of the waiters, you can enjoy the fairy life here.

The Guanhaixuan where I stayed this time, and the Haifeng Pavilion where I stayed last time, are more cost-effective than the Guanhaixuan. I will continue to choose Guanhaixuan next time.

Because Guanhaixuan can see the beautiful and unobstructed sea view. We are fortunate to live on the top floor with unobstructed sea views, and we live in the third building, which is also very close to the front desk (if you want convenience, buildings 1-3 are very close to the front desk).

The Haifeng Pavilion is close to the sea but the floor is low. In fact, the sea cannot be seen, and the price is even more expensive.

Therefore, Guanhaixuan is recommended. The photos are all taken in the room for reference.

Thanks to Wenhua Gang for upgrading the room type to the first class, you can listen to the sound of the waves. The view here is also very superior. There are garden craftsmen in every part of the hotel, and the privacy of the beach It is also one of the characteristics. Sailing to the sea has become the finishing touch. The super beautiful sunset and the refreshing BBQ dinner also conquered my heart!

msg:In the second week of coming to Sanya, I chose Mandarin Oriental. Mainly I like the Southeast Asian style here, and there is a holiday feel. The scenery of the hotel is not to be mentioned. All the rooms are built on the mountain and have a private beach. Although the beach is very rough and all stones 🫠, it is located in the East China Sea, so there is no way! But the sea water is particularly clean, and the sunset is so beautiful, not to mention how beautiful it is! The most important thing should be the service, every staff is very nice and warm and thoughtful. I booked a suite so I have a dedicated butler. She has a very nice name Luna. Luna has a caring service and efficient work. Really special thanks! Also impressive is the pair of twin brothers from the concierge, who are very handsome and drive buggy every day to pick us up and down in every corner of the hotel. All in all, the family was very happy and satisfied during the few days here. Happy Holidays.

msg:Mandarin Oriental, Sanya claims to be low-key luxury, but I think it is neither low-key nor luxurious. Along the coastline of the hotel is an online celebrity check-in point. It feels like the people who stay in the hotel are all punching in and taking pictures to complete the task. The core of the hotel is considerate and subtle service. The overall service of this hotel is blunt, and there is no feeling of being respected or seen. The geographical location is built on a mountain, so you have to not take a battery car to get out of the room, otherwise you will have to climb the mountain with your legs, resulting in a slow hotel capacity. In short, the photos are beautiful, but the connotation is very empty, which does not meet the positioning of a luxury hotel.

The hotel service issues are as follows:

1. After cleaning the room at night, the housekeeper took away all the used bath towels, but did not put a new towel back. After taking a shower at night, I found that there were no towels in the room.
2. Large garbage bags full of old towels were piled up at the door of the guest room, and no one took them away until the evening.
3. The hotel is built on a mountain. Unless you take a battery car, leaving the room is equivalent to climbing a mountain in the sun, resulting in a slow hotel capacity. It is very slow to call to make an appoin**ent for a battery car and to wait for a battery car.
4. The guest service calls have basically failed since the afternoon, no one answered the phone, and the VX butler can only solve the problem, but the butler also added VX after I asked for it after arriving at the store.
5. The hotel has snorkeled to the beach. The coach requires that children over 6 years old must be accompanied by an adult to snorkel together. No one reminded them during the entire booking process. The brochure in the hotel room shows that the snorkeling price is 180 yuan, and the coach at the beach says 220 yuan. Just don't ask me, you go to the hotel.

The last point that made me feel very uncomfortable is the guest service depar**ent of the hotel. Any additional requests will not be assisted, and the staff's replies are all standard speech, impersonal and direct rejections. In fact, we don't expect the hotel to solve all the difficulties or requests that the guests have. What we hope is to be seen and respected. But the customer service always refused very bluntly, and would just keep repeating, "This is our hotel's policy, and I can't solve it." "I didn't say anything, I didn't say this." Such a reply It makes people feel very uncomfortable, and it feels like the hotel is shirking responsibility up and down. The service depar**ent of the hotel gives me a feeling that if you have any questions, please don't come to me. I am not responsible for anything other than my work.

This is the first time I write a hotel review, I don't know if the hotel manager can read it and draw your attention. Hope to see your progress.

msg:Advantages: The Mandarin Oriental Hotel has a good sense of vacation, the seaside is beautiful, and it is a special film with Coconut Grove.
The sea water is excellent, Biyalong Bay is clear.
The seafood buffet BBQ in the evening is also delicious, but it is small and expensive, 658 per person.
Cons: Only two pools are open. I feel that the maintenance of the park is poor, and there may be insufficient manpower. For example, the room will be cleaned after 2:30 hours. There is a lot of rubbish on the beach, but there are no staff to maintain hygiene, which feels relatively bad. Private beaches should be better at this.
Except for the snorkeling area, no other places can go to the sea, there is no beach, mostly coral rubble.
The hotel is more utilitarian. The basic feeling is that there are various fees, snorkeling fees, photography selection fees, etc. The experience feels that it is still a lot worse than the Madai, but the room rate has almost caught up with the Madai, I ordered the Haifeng Pavilion, More than 3700 per night, the price/performance ratio is not particularly high compared to the things you enjoy. After all, it is not a villa. The villa here is from 20,000 per night😣
There should be some mineral water drinks everywhere in the park for guests to drink, but there are none.
Generally speaking, it is ok. It is more like a hotel in Madai in China, but it is still worse than Madai, and I hope to improve soft services.

Although it has been in business for more than ten years, the maintenance of the room, the garden design of the public area, and Miss Jing Ran Kiki, who received us, are very online.

Exclusive access to the sea view of Coral Bay, the sense of vacation is full and privacy is very good. You can experience snorkeling and sailing without leaving the hotel. Although the buffet dinner in Haijiao Xuan is too popular, it is not bad.

The only regret is that the Dragon Boat Festival holiday is in a hurry, the signature spa has not had time to make an appointment, and I look forward to the next trip

The restaurant's seaside buffet is really good, lobster free, much better than the so-called shrimp buffet in an alphabet hotel. The breakfast is plentiful and there are many varieties of cheese.
All the staff were helpful, including sailboats and paddleboarders there. It's a pity that there is only one small slide in the swimming pool, which is still broken and under maintenance. The swimming pool is outdoors, so it is dirty, like an "ecological tour". Children's Beach suggests that it's time to change the sand. Sunscreen and spray are provided by the pool, great. In order to arrive at the store at 3 o'clock, I specially bought a morning air ticket, but I got no room at 3 o'clock. I waited for more than two hours to get a room. Like the Intercontinental family, even if we arrive early and wait for the room, they will apologize and give a few bars. Drink coupons are cool and waiting, the waiting room here is hot and dry.

I would like to thank Ctrip and the hotel for helping to coordinate the reservation when the room inventory in the summer peak season was insufficient, and the final check-in was successful. Before moving in, Nicole, the housekeeper nursery rhyme, added WeChat in advance and helped to upgrade to Haifeng Pavilion. Our whole family likes Haifeng Pavilion very much. The strong Southeast Asian style of the hotel makes us feel as if we are back on vacation in Southeast Asia, an era when there was no epidemic. The seawater of Qingchi, the quiet garden, and the considerate service can meet different vacation needs. We strongly recommend the seaside seafood buffet, which is beautiful. Because the hotel is a few years old, the hardware facilities are slightly insufficient. Unfortunately, the air conditioner fails and the air conditioner is not strong enough. As a result, the temperature is high in the middle of the night and cannot sleep. Because I don't want to call the feedback problem, it will affect the child's sleep. Contact the housekeeper, but Nicole, the housekeeper nursery rhyme, responded in seconds, and has been assisting in communication and solving problems. You can feel at home in MO. Although the air conditioner is not enough, you need to use a fan. The breakfast is slightly inferior to Capella and Park Hyatt. Live longer. Thanks again to Nursery Rhyme Nicole for giving our whole family a weekend full of happy memories! ! !

General sound insulation, water noise is relatively large. The attitude of the staff is very good and warm. The only room card could not be opened at 11:55, which caused me to wait outside the door in a swimsuit for a quarter of an hour before the staff helped me open the door, and the experience was greatly reduced in an instant.

You need a car to travel in the room. Reminds me of Conrad in Koh Samui, more special. The effect of travel photography is particularly good, and you can capture the sunset! Many hotels can't take pictures. We recommend more than 100 people at the seaside restaurant BBQ6. If you book in advance, you can sit in the row closest to the seaside. The scenery is amazing! The St. Regis Seaside Restaurant where I lived later was far from it! The key is lobster and foie gras, unlimited steak! It tastes good 😊 Because it is in Coral Bay, you can snorkel directly at the hotel. The price is 180 yuan per person, and it is about 268 outside. Don't forget to make an appoin**ent on the day you just checked in. We didn't make an appoin**ent on the first day, but we made an appoin**ent on the second day because the project was cancelled due to sudden heavy rain, and we didn't catch up. But the next day I took a power sailboat, which was a great experience. If you have a snorkeling mask, you can actually go directly into the water without paying. If you haven't dived before, you can pay a coach to teach you. In addition, there is a children's playground and several swimming pools, and children have a great time playing. The only shortcoming is that the facilities are indeed a little old. If it was ten years ago, it should be more amazing.

Generally speaking, the five-star hotels in Sanya are not particularly up to the standard, and each has its own problems. The facilities of Oriental Culture are relatively old, the deck chairs by the beach are very old and not well maintained, but the environment is well designed. I have to say that the photos are really good, and there are slightly fewer people in Coral Bay, unlike Haitang Bay. Crowded people. There are 2 swimming pools, which are relatively large, and the swimming experience is not bad. The slide is estimated to be closed for safety reasons, which is a bit disappointing. This time, all the restaurants and bars in the hotel have been tried. The taste is good, and the breakfast is very rich. In terms of entertainment, I tried snorkeling and sailing. You can book activities in the hotel, which is very convenient. If you like a modern and clean hotel, you can choose Haitang Bay. Generally speaking, I prefer Oriental Wenhua, which has a better sense of vacation. There are many plants in the hotel, which is very romantic. The housekeeper, Luna, contacted and added WeChat in advance, and the problems were solved in time. The hotel service was still very good, and I spent 6 pleasant nights.

msg:It took me a long time to start writing this review, because I really don't know how to write it?
This trip to Sanya really started from the expectation of Mandarin Oriental, but it also ended from the disappoin**ent of Mandarin Oriental!
A total of four hotels were arranged in Sanya for this trip: Sanya Bay Mangrove Palm Parent-Child Hotel, Westin Haitang Bay, Atlantis Hotel, and Mandarin Oriental. The whole trip started with convenience and was ready to end with a hotel, but Mandarin Oriental disappointed me that it was not as good as mangroves!
First of all, a special thank you. Special thanks to Jing Ran, the PR staff member of Mandarin Oriental, for her service is absolutely in place, responsive and quick to respond! What was particularly touching was that I told her that her daughter's foot was twisted and it hurt a little. She immediately contacted her if there was any medicine in the infirmary. When she learned that there was no medicine in the infirmary, she immediately called the courier to buy medicine and send it to me, and she was resting that day. I am really very, very grateful!
But apart from Jing Ran, the others are not so good. Maybe because of the summer vacation, there were so many people, and it was obvious that the reception of Mandarin Oriental was not enough. 1. I drove to the hotel and parked in the parking lot. There were obviously not enough parking spaces. What was more annoying was that I saw a car go away and then parked in. A staff member came over and said that this is a parking space for charging the battery car. You can't stop, I think you have to figure it out, I stopped when someone else left, others can stop, but I can't? Don't I deserve to be a hotel guest? 2. During the peak check-in period, I finally got in line. The staff left without saying anything. I just continued to wait! 3. The so-called welcome drink in the lobby is also an empty pot. In such a hot day, there is no water during the waiting process. Such a five-star hotel is too bad. 4. The worst battery car service in this process. Tell me that because there are many people, the car has to be called 15 minutes in advance, but even if you call 20 minutes in advance, you can still wait 30 minutes, even if you check out and go to the airport to catch a flight, you will still be asked to wait. They keep saying that we are urging us, but there are several empty cars passing by the door and they will not stop. Even if they stop, they will tell you that you have to wait for arrangements to call for a car, and I cannot pick you up... This is Mandarin Oriental The service was so disappointing. Ms. Tong Yao, the person in charge of the tram service, is not fit to be the person in charge. She has a bad attitude. She also asked me the time of the flight when I checked out to catch the flight. When she learned that the flight time was still early (3 hours before departure), she felt very It doesn't matter, I think it's too early. As a result, I dragged my luggage with a child with a twisted foot, and limply dragged the originally smooth time to the airport to get the boarding pass and almost boarded the plane! 5. The hotel's spa is also offered at random. I bring a 10-year-old child, but he is taller, and he is charged at the adult price. I didn't pursue the fee, because I was happy when I came out, but then another staff member told me that the child was calculated at the child's price. What happened to the previous staff member? Training is a mess! 6. The water in the swimming pool is very dirty. After the child swims, his legs will look like the picture, hey...
Maybe such a hotel is not suitable for peak season! A good low-key luxury five-star hotel, to be honest, the overall service is not as good as the mangrove, I am really disappointed

msg:It is difficult for any hotel owner to refuse the charm of Mandarin Oriental.
As a hotel that has been in business for more than ten years, Mandarin Oriental has become more and more warm in the years.
This time it's a honeymoon trip~ The creation of a sense of vacation reflects the hotel's intentions.
Thanks to the caring service of the housekeeper Jenna, the honeymoon arrangement adds a sense of ceremony. Due to the itinerary around the island, it was originally only booked for one day, but at the moment of check-in, it was decided to continue the stay. It also coincided with Mr.'s birthday, which gave us an unexpected surprise.
Service: 100 points. Jenna is attentive and responsive.
Environment: 100 points. One step at a time, a selfie stand, shooting alone, is already a blockbuster.
Item: 100 points. Surrounded by snorkeling fish, take a video as a souvenir.

The turndown service is turned on to add a sense of ritual, the mosquito repellent has been turned on, the slippers have been put in place, and the quilt has been folded.

The beauty of Mandarin Oriental is reserved only for those who appreciate it.

msg:Hainan·Sanya/Sanya Coral Bay Mandarin Oriental Hotel Recommended index★★★★+★ (the environment and service are too good QAQ plus one star)

At the end of June, we finally arranged the long-awaited Mandarin Oriental, a four-hour drive from Meilan Airport to MO, which enjoys a whole sea. The hotel has a strong Southeast Asian style and a lot of green plants. Each room features a spacious terrace and balcony with stunning sunset views that MO is proud of. (But I was probably not able to see it because of fate.) Fortunately, Sanya was still in heavy rain the day before, and the sun was shining on the earth for three days!

There are three open-air swimming pools in the hotel, but no indoor venues. At present, the heated swimming pool does not have a constant temperature due to the hot climate. All three swimming pools are open during the day, and only the infinity swimming pool is open at night. Non-standard swimming lanes, and children like to play in the water in summer, so they did not experience it.

After choosing the most basic Cuiyuan Pavilion with my friends, I jumped two levels to upgrade to Guanhaixuan, which can see the sea. If it is on a sunset day, the view is invincible. The housekeeper will directly connect with the housekeeper the day before check-in, and you can directly feedback the problem with the housekeeper. All the amenities in the room are Oulong, there is no coffee machine in the room, and the MINIBAR in the refrigerator is free to use. Two bottles of 750ML Evian are provided every day. In addition, the call center for drinking water needs to be increased (Nongfu Spring).

Our housekeeper, Nicole, has been attentive to help arrange all kinds of matters since before we checked in. I am really embarrassed to be harassed by me at 11 o'clock in the evening, and sent two super delicious coconut jelly and a little squirrel doll.

Lightning protection point 1: There is no air conditioner in the hotel lobby. It is hot in summer. When customers arrive at the hotel without air conditioning, it will inevitably lead to emotional sensitivity due to the heat. The number of staff is far from meeting the needs of dealing with various problems. Within ten minutes of my check-in, I encountered at least 3 customer complaints. (Staff is very nice, just can't handle the problem at the same time)
Lightning protection point 2: It is still a manpower problem. The hotel is far away from the lobby so that the room type needs a shuttle bus wherever it goes. It takes at least a quarter of an hour or more to wait during peak hours. (Including the need to wait for half an hour or more if ordering take-out needs to be delivered to your door)
Lightning protection point 3: The hotel opened in 2009 and was renovated in 2018, but the bathroom does not have a separate ventilation fan. The bedside charging port in the twin room only has a single bed, and the other side needs to be unplugged (there is no USB straight port). The sound insulation effect is really a bit poor, and the sound of turning over the toilet lid in the middle of the night can be heard, which is harmful.

There is a good view everywhere. The swimming pool is huge. Why do you need to take a photo before you open the table? Well, the spa has made a hot bowl. It is cost-effective. Generally, the park can only be entered through the spa lobby. After 80 minutes, you can only press your feet. After finishing, there is only one lime to eat.

During this period, my housekeeper KiKi Jingran arranged to see several other room types to change rooms. The housekeeper arranged it again and again, and I really liked the location of the room I chose. During my stay, KIKI always responded quickly to my questions and was very considerate, and even gave me a small gift when I parted. On the hotel's private beach, children also participated in sea fishing and snorkeling, which is also highly recommended. It is recommended that the hotel open an indoor cafe to cater to pure resort hotel guests.

msg:A very happy stay experience, there are indeed some small flaws, but it is not important in front of the service and the overall scenery
The hotel is located in Coral Bay, Dadonghai, with a private beach. The sea water is crystal clear. I saw a lot of corals and colorful fish when I went snorkeling. The snorkeling services and equipment are also very complete, and even snorkeling glasses have different degrees.
Walking on the edge of the beach in the evening, watching the ebb and flow of the tide and the dazzling sunset, really calms down the irritable heart, suitable for parents and children and lovers, romantic and warm. It is surrounded by mountains and the sea, the sea is blue, and the mountains are all green and safflower, it feels like living in the scenic spot.
The service is very good, although every service staff is very busy, but there are things that will be very patient arrangements and guidance. Thanks to the housekeeper ALEX for his considerate service throughout the whole process.

Small flaws:
1. The battery car service sometimes takes a long time, maybe because it is too busy.

It only takes 15 seconds to walk to the beach, which is probably the closest room to the sea in Sanya. The service of mo has always been a benchmark in the hotel industry. I am very grateful to my housekeeper Lexie, who communicated and solved various problems in a timely manner during the stay, and also gave the hotel fans and dolls as gifts. All in all, this was a perfect holiday experience, and I will choose Mandarin Oriental again in Sanya in the future.

It is quiet in the middle of the city, and the winding path leads to a secluded feeling. It is also very convenient to be away from the city. There is no need to go out. The hotel&#39;s private beach, as well as the typical Southeast Asian landscape greenery and environment, focus on complimenting my hotel steward, Miss Luna, because it happened to be my birthday, Luna specially arranged the room and cake, and when I left I also gave a little squirrel doll. The service staff everywhere are super nice, and Haijiao Xuan also gave a cake when they dine~ It was a great travel and hotel experience! !

🚗 Transportation: It takes about 50 minutes to take a taxi from the airport. There is a bus to the duty-free shop in the hotel, but we did not go out and did not experience it.

🍃Environment: It is very quiet, there are not many people during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, except for the sound of the waves, there is no noise. There is no need to describe the scenery, it is all in the picture.

🔔Service: Butler Jingran added WeChat one day in advance, answering any questions. From explaining the epidemic prevention policy to sending a new room card in time after losing the room card, we always help solve the problem as soon as possible. The other staff are also very warm and thoughtful. If you order takeout, they will help you deliver it to the room.

The hotel staff are very nice. The housekeeper, Luna, is very considerate and will take the initiative to ask for needs and respond to any requests. Strongly recommend the BBQ sunset dinner, with a baby, the first time a meal can be eaten for so long. (We usually eat the buffet for at most one hour and then leave after eating) But this time to enjoy the sunset, children play with sand on the beach, watch the moonlight, watch the stars blow the sea breeze, drink sparkling wine, and chat, you can have a good time 🥳The hotel also has Snorkeling is also a very good project. Children at the age of six can follow their mothers to feed the little fish. The second time you brush this project, you can see how much the child likes. In the afternoon, I followed my father to catch crabs by the reef in a mini-type rush to the sea 🤭 There is another point to be commended, that is, the Ctrip booking gave 5 photos of the trip, and the whole process was comfortable. It's not like the distressed feeling of spending 1,500 photos in a hotel. In short, I was very happy this night. I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya, and this one is the most relaxing and fun🤗🤗🤗

It must be said that the hotel is quiet and very private, and there are basically no other people except the hotel guests and staff. It is really the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in in Sanya. We live in Guanhaixuan, the view is wide and the sea view is beautiful. The hotel is also very big. My little friend and I did not take the shuttle bus at the hotel all day yesterday and walked more than 10,000 steps. Every staff member I met was also very enthusiastic.

The service is very good👍 Whether it's Jane the housekeeper, or everyone at the front desk in the lobby~~ My husband felt that the sea view of the original room was not good enough, so he changed it to another one. The breakfast is rich and the environment is also very good. There are also Haijiaoxuan seaside buffets that must be booked at least half a month in advance, the evening breeze is blowing, the singing is good, lobster, crab, steak, fruit and so on. Not to mention taking pictures, you can make movies everywhere! Love love love ❤️ will come again next time

🍃 Environment:
The garden is really super beautiful, especially from the balcony, the pool and the lush garden are blended together. It’s so healing. There are many check-in spots in the hotel for camping⛺️ You don’t have to go out to find the photo spots. It’s very convenient. The Sunset Restaurant
🧹Sanitation: The room is good, but the hotel is a bit old and the air conditioner is not cold enough
🔔Service: The service must be praised. Sanya is really too hot. It was too hot at the end of April. When I went out, I was sweating like crazy, but you can contact the staff on WeChat at any time. I will drive the ferry to pick me up immediately. Hard work! Also gave us an upgrade to a sea view room~

First of all, the service attitude is not mentioned. The housekeeper Gao Jing, Miss Mia, is very enthusiastic throughout the whole process and will answer any questions. The whole hotel environment is very good, and it is very good to take pictures. Unfortunately, the weather in Sanya was not good in the past two days, otherwise the pictures would be better. The hotel's breakfast is rich, and there is a seafood buffet dinner in Haijiao Xuan. It tastes great. It is 1300 for two people, and it is estimated that they did not eat 600 yuan, haha.

The service is not to mention, the housekeeper contacted me before moving in, sister Zora is so caring! ! ! All aspects are considered super thoughtful. When I was far away, I said that I wanted a room with a better view. Guanhaixuan upgraded me for free. Knowing that my plane was at 8 o'clock, I offered to help me with a late check-out. It may be off-season. There are fewer rooms and less pressure, and it actually gave me a delay to check out until 4 o'clock! ! My mom was moved to tears when she stayed at a hotel where she checked out at 4:00 for the first time! !
The seaside restaurant that needed to be agreed a month ago also helped me fill up a seat! ! The sunset is super beautiful! ! When I left, I also gave it to my hotel for the anniversary! ! ! Invincible cute squirrel doll!
Of course, the facilities in the room are relatively old, which affects the experience of staying a little bit. If the MO room is renovated, I will choose MO without hesitation! ! ! !

The environment is very good, the privacy is also excellent, the sea water is transparent and blue, and you can participate in snorkeling at the hotel. The small fish are also very cute and entertaining, and the children are also very happy to play in the heated swimming pool. It's better than Capella. After all, the heated swimming pool may be more perfect this season. The housekeeper Han Xinyu before check-in also asked our needs very enthusiastically. After check-in, he also solved various needs in time.
The hotel's turndown attendant, Chen Shuling, is also very good and gave us a small gift and a plush toy. Because the water is a bit cold, but it is also very comfortable to relax on the loungers. The hotel's seaside self-service personally thinks that it is possible to achieve the freedom of lobster. The taste is also good. When the weather is good, the romantic a**osphere is also great.
And the most worthwhile thing is that the hotel itself is the scenery, and the scenery is everywhere. I think I will stay here next time. The only disadvantage is that the hotel facilities are old, but I think this only disadvantage does not affect the whole hotel. After all, there is no one The hotel could have been brand new and it has been well maintained

The sea water is good and clear, but unfortunately the beach is very prickly, the sea is full of rocks, you can't go into the sea freely..
The housekeeper is very awkward, and there is no service at all. Of course, maybe I was unlucky and met the air housekeeper.

🧹Hygiene: First of all, I said that although it is a relatively old-fashioned hotel, the various facilities and room cleaning of the hotel are very attentive and comfortable. It can be said that it is spotless, and you can’t find any strands of hair. Very cleanliness to the extreme, every day They will change the latest equipment for you, and there will be a turndown service in the evening.
🍃Environment: The vegetation coverage is very wide, the various settings of the coconut trees in the courtyard are beautiful, and the photos are also beautiful. All restaurants and check-in points can be filmed. There will be distinctions between swimming pools, public beaches, and snorkeling areas. The key point is that the sea water is clean. Yeah, sitting in the coral reserve, snorkeling is so interesting, you can see a lot of corals and tropical fish, it's also very simple, the breakfast is delicious, all restaurants are okay, eat noodle restaurants, barbecue BBQ, Chinese restaurant, the most recommended Cape Xuan's Western food and BBQ BBQ buffet, steak, seafood, foie gras, wine all-you-can-eat, so cool
🔔Service: Immediately respond to the service at the entrance to the store, assist with luggage, assist in check-in, the receptionist at the front desk is very polite and enthusiastic, with super strong business ability, and quickly handles related questions and check-in, this month is the birthday month , Thank you for upgrading the experience of Haifeng Pavilion. The hotel will be picked up and delivered by electric vehicles throughout the hotel. You can see electric vehicles shuttle at any time. You don't need to walk a lot, but I like to walk the road near the beach, because there are many facilities to check in and rest. I would like to focus on praising Miss Jing Ran for the guest relationship at Mandarin Oriental Hotel. First of all, WeChat and I have solved many restaurant reservation problems throughout the whole process. The lady is still helping me deal with the duty-free shop discounts and car use issues at night, and the service is first-class. , super good, there are still many small questions answered in seconds, I was late for the duty-free shop shuttle bus that day, the lady and the driver waited for us for a while, and when we left, she would greet us in time and ask about the accommodation experience, I am also an education service worker, which made me feel the ultimate service. At the same time, I would like to thank me for being MINA of Mandarin Oriental, Sanya. I also communicated with me to assist me in the early stage of some check-in problems, and solved my confusion in time. Thank you for meeting everyone.
Passing by the coconut forest check-in point for breakfast today, I found that the supervisor of the hotel park may be criticizing the maintenance of some lawns, which makes me think that Wenhua is a hotel that has perfected the details.
Next time I have a chance, I will choose Mandarin Oriental, it's worth it

The location of the hotel can be said to be quite superior. When the car drove into Coral Bay, it did not see its store, but saw its beach first. The hotel has its own private beach, the marine protection is very good, and the sea view is beautiful. It is also very convenient to order takeout, and there are attractions such as Luhuitou nearby. If you want to go to the duty-free shop, there is a regular shuttle bus every morning and afternoon.

This time, we also accidentally got the opportunity to upgrade for free. The original garden view room was upgraded to a sea view room. We just loved it so much, the holiday vibe was full.

The service of the personal butler is also very considerate and in place. This time, the little butler who accompanied us is Wang Zhiyi Kennys. He can advise us on our itinerary, help us book a car, etc. After swimming, he also prepared brown sugar ginger tea for us intimately~ If it is a family trip, the housekeeper will add a lot to the whole trip.

This time we are traveling off-peak, so the service is in place in all aspects. If you have the conditions and want to enjoy the best service, it is recommended to travel in the off-season

msg:Sunset is the most beautiful time of the day at this beautiful hotel 🌅

Sanya Mandarin Oriental is not excellent in terms of room hardware, but the garden landscape and public area design are still top-notch in Sanya. Coupled with the meticulous service, it can be said that although there are some shortcomings, it is still the best hotel in Sanya in general. one.

Jing Ran KiKi, the hotel guest relations & itinerary manager, contacted me and added my WeChat before check-in. During the stay, I received very timely feedback and satisfaction. For example, I quit sugar-sweetened beverages and brought sugar-free beverages. Substitute diet drinks in the free mini fridge.

There are many hotels in Sanya with free minibar, but there are only a handful of them that can do this. It seems like a trivial matter, but in fact, it truly realizes the performance of customized services, and also reflects the unity and cooperation between various depar**ents of the hotel.

Many hotels will only bluntly tell me that the drinks in the refrigerator are complete sets and cannot be replaced after I make a request. Really can't? They are just too lazy to coordinate with other depar**ents, and they don't care about the needs of the guests.

In general, Jing Ran KiKi's service made this trip to MO perfect. I originally booked a basic room type, but it was upgraded to Haifeng Pavilion. When I left the store, I also gave the hotel's mascot, the squirrel, which is very good.

Mandarin Oriental exclusively owns Coral Bay, which is an excellent place to watch the sunset. The natural landscape with mountains, sea and sky in the same frame is beautiful.

When I checked in, I forgot to ask for a double bed. When I got to the room, the door opened and found it was a big bed. The housekeeper Yaya quickly helped coordinate and helped us change to a double bed 15 minutes later. The sun loungers by the hotel swimming pool with tents can completely shade and change clothes, which is convenient and thoughtful! And there is a very clean pool next to each pool, so you don't have to run a big circle to find a bathroom. The package includes snorkeling, and my son is very happy watching the fish. The travel photography I sent, leaving a few family photos for the family of three, is also a harvest. In the evening, we will send your favorite pillows: buckwheat pillows, memory pillows, and maternity pillows, all of which will improve and pay attention to the sleeping experience of guests! Zhang Xiaonan, the staff member, was warm and friendly throughout the whole process. When I left, I also gave my son a little squirrel, and the children liked the hotel even more. When checking out, the master who connected the battery car said: The occupancy rate is very full. When I am busy, I am worried that the guests will wait for a long time. This attitude of being able to find problems and consider the guests personally makes me feel that good service is really good. The brand value of Mandarin Oriental has left an imprint on my heart! Thanks to Zhang Xiaonan yaya for the cleaning service staff!

The swimming pool is big, but there are relatively few slides, but the cold water is not warm enough in the weather, so the children have been staying in the heated swimming pool. The hotel is very large and has a battery car, and it is also very pleasant to take a walk occasionally. The breakfast is very rich and the taste is good. In short, I am very satisfied this time.

Dinner can be plentiful or simple, both Chinese and Western food are top-grade, seaside Western food, poolside lunch, you can also experience snorkeling, travel photography, water slides...

msg:I have been planting grass at Mandarin Oriental, Sanya for a long time. This time I finally pulled the grass. Here is a fair comment:
*advantage:
1. The geographical location is very private;
2. Has complete resort facilities: independent beach, water activities, travel photography, gym, yoga room, game machine room, etc. Everything is perfect enough to just want to stay in hotels (I am a person who hates hotels, but I am willing to stay in Wenhua~ ~)
3. The scenery is very beautiful, with the most beautiful Cape Pavilion;
4. Haijiao Xuan's buffet is very good. It is a seafood barbecue buffet sitting on the seaside. It realizes the freedom of Xiaoqinglong, durian, and steak... 598 people, need to book in advance;
5. The gym facilities are relatively complete, and there are special fitness classes available;
6. Good service (after all, it is Wenhua~);
7. In the toiletries, the lotion is actually diptyque (cow).
Be
*Deficiencies:
1. The sound insulation of the room is really bad. It was so clear to wash and move the stool next door in the middle of the night that we thought it was right next to us. Difference)
2. The battery car service takes too long to wait. We ordered the car half an hour in advance, and finally it exceeded the reserved time, and it took 4 reminders to come. This point needs to be improved~
3. Regarding the snorkeling included in the room package, when I went there, I didn't explain in advance that I would pay for the coach to take pictures with Gopro. After taking pictures, I told us that it was 180 yuan per person. When I saw the pictures, I was a little nervous Confused, this shot... it's better that I buy a waterproof bag and shoot it myself! It's not worth it~
4. Regarding the travel photography in the room package, it only contains 5 photos, and it is not refined. The cameraman will take 40-50 photos. If you want all of them, just buy the cheapest 699 package, or buy them one by one. , but a personal suggestion, shoot it yourself, the angle cameraman has found it for you, you know~
Be
*Finally, a reminder:
The hotel is located in a military jurisdiction. If you rent a Tesla, you need to park in the parking lot outside the resort, and then ask the front desk to arrange a car pickup. This is not very convenient, because waiting for the car is a problem, and the reimbur*****t of parking fees is a bit troublesome. There is no invoice in the parking lot, you need to ask the customer service to confirm it. In short, to avoid these inconveniences, it is better not to rent a Tesla.
Be
*Summarize:
If you go to Mandarin Oriental, you can actually rent a car for two days less and just stay in a hotel~ You can try the buffet~

msg:The scenery of the sea view room is very good, but the sea view is much worse. If you are looking for an excellent experience, it is recommended that the sea view room is above. The public areas have good scenery and are very relaxing and pleasant. What makes people complain about is the service that does not match the environment and the price. Each customer service service has to wait a long time, including the response speed of the concierge during check-in, the efficiency of the front desk and any other matters that require manpower to provide. It should be due to the lack of manpower and lack of training caused by management confusion. I hope that it can be improved seriously and can be worthy of the brand and price. Overall, it is okay. The attitude of the on-duty manager to solve the problem is commendable. If you put management first and no bad problems occur, the experience will be better.

msg:This is the second time to come to Wenhua 😋 It is still so beautiful after a year! It's really my happy hometown
       In fact, this time I was entangled in whether to try another resort hotel, but Wenhua really took into account the resort style I wanted, the convenience of dining near the city, and the quietness of people, so I came again! This time I stayed at the Sea Breeze Pavilion 😎 is very close to the sea! The room is well maintained, everywhere is clean and warm~ The staff are still very kind and say hello when they meet 🥰 Thank you very much, Miss Jing Ran KiKi! From upgrading the room type, contacting the travel shooting, and picking up and dropping off the airport, they helped us in every possible way, and the check-in and check-out procedures were completed very quickly. It's really as cordial and comfortable as returning home.
        I will choose Mandarin Oriental when I come to Sanya again next year🥰

msg:This is the first time I came to Sanya, I was lucky to choose Mandarin Oriental, and even more fortunate was to upgrade to a villa suite. The layout and experience of the hotel's one-stop resort is very much in line with my expectations. Although the sky is not beautiful (there is a typhoon in December), I still enjoyed the comfort and surprise of the holiday in just one day of stay.

In a short day, from the surprise when the door was first opened, to the excitement of jumping into the pool like a big child, to the coziness of walking on the beach, to the satisfaction after enjoying a hearty breakfast, all of this finally came together. Every moment of happiness, I hope I can visit again in the future on a sunny day with blue sky, white clouds and sunny days (I regret that there is a typhoon again).

Special thanks to the butler Callie He Yuting, the very considerate service, which is the finishing touch of the entire hotel service. Especially thanks to Miss Sister for remembering to send brown sugar water to my family during her busy schedule, and to compare her heart.

Private bay, quiet space, staff's warm service, and the ceiling of Sanya buffet session, this is the reason why I recommend it. Finally, I would like to thank the front desk lady my personal butler Max for giving me the (most enthusiastic) (best quality) service and thoughtful arrangements before and during my stay at the hotel.

msg:I chose to go to Sanya for vacation during the Chris**as week. Overall, this hotel is great. This trip is my first time to Sanya. I studied for a long time before choosing a hotel. There are so many hotels to choose from, each with its own merits. After reading the domestic guide and looking at the external Internet, the hotel's ratings were all 4.9➕, so I decisively placed an order to book a room. Because we planned two months in advance, we couldn't consider the weather. As it turned out, the day we arrived was when a typhoon made landfall, and it was almost rainy the whole week. I was still a little disappointed. To be honest, thanks to choosing this hotel, it made up for all the shortcomings caused by the bad weather. The hotel is exquisite and incomparably beautiful, with a Southeast Asian style. There are no small buildings higher than three floors, and the whole hotel has a strong fake style. Although the hospital provides battery car services, we enjoy walking on the beach or in the gardens every day. Although you can't go into the sea, the hotel's heated swimming pool is enough to meet your needs for water play. The hotel has complete facilities, including a rich and varied breakfast buffet, various Chinese and Western restaurants, especially the seafood buffet, which is fresh and delicious. The gym is fully functional. There is also a very high-end spa. This location is super close to the city. We went to the city once and had a coconut chicken. Nothing else was special. It was more comfortable to stay in the hotel. There was a sunny day in the middle and we paddleboarded, which was a lot of fun. It can be said that we have experienced all the food, drinks and entertainment in the hotel. The hotel staff are also super friendly, and they also have a personal butler. In particular, our butler Shona immediately arranged for a coffee machine to be delivered to us on a rainy night, which was very touching. We also chose the hotel package for travel photography. Our photographer, Mr. Sicheng, was also very dedicated and even took photos twice if the weather was bad. All in all everything was perfect, highly recommended. I will try to go again in April, looking forward to ingz

After the request was made, the hotel staff only replied that they would verify it, but there was no follow-up news. They called again and asked to verify.
After the complaint and feedback, although I can understand the service staff, I find reasons throughout the whole process... It's better not to communicate...

🔔Service: need to be strengthened. . . . Totally not worth the price right now.

There are many rocks on the beach, but the sea is still very clean, which is different from the beach style of Haitang Bay.
The seafood barbecue in the evening is worth recommending. The Chinese restaurant has a large amount of dishes. If you order it carefully, breakfast will be useless.

msg:For the experience of Mandarin Oriental, Sanya, from the beginning, disappoin**ent to satisfaction. "Disappoin**ent" mainly comes from the service. The attitude is good, but the management is not in place. Various mistakes and various connections. "Satisfaction" still lies in the good weather and complete hotel facilities
Several points of service
-On the first day at noon, I ordered the food in the restaurant. Wrong cold dish was ordered. I ordered noodles. No order. Finally canceled... Four copies of Yangzhi nectar were served, two copies were served, and so on.
-The sofa bed in the room. Two waiters came to make the bed. They found that the bed hadn't opened yet. They said that they wouldn’t open.
-The breakfast is very rich, but there are so many people.

Sanya after the typhoon 🌀 Double Rainbow + Invincible Sunset. There are several heated outdoor swimming pools. At a few time points, there are not many people in the swimming pool. There are also many scenic spots for taking pictures. Finally, everyone is satisfied.

The hotel staff were very enthusiastic. From the moment I got off the car, I felt the warm, thoughtful and just right service and reception. First of all, the environment of the private beach by the mountain and the sea is very comfortable. The room is spacious enough. The small butler YSERA is always responsive. Whether it is an event restaurant reservation or a question inquiry, he responds to the arrangement in a timely manner. When I come back from snorkeling, I also sent ginger slices to boil the heat. The ginger tea, I feel cared for all the time. The swimming pool is always accompanied by a lifeguard, and cleaning is also very timely. All in all it is very recommended, I would like to stay at the hotel.

Our rooms are the Sea Breeze Pavilion and the Wentao Water Pleasure Pavilion. It is not far from the seaside when we open the door. In the morning, we can wake up to the sound of waves and birds.

Haijiao Xuan and the Yiyang Chinese Restaurant next to it are well received.

And the spa is really amazing, it's worthy of MO. The most intimate point is that the mobile phone in the spa area has no signal and cannot connect to the wifi, in order to allow travelers to stay away from electronic products and relax and enjoy. The technician said that this massage was awarded, and the experience is directly on the ceiling. How can I go to other places in the future!

The personal butler Chai Yanan Lrene is really great and the service is serious and attentive. I will choose to live here next time!

The most pleasing thing is that there are few people, being quiet, avoiding parent-child noises and winking eyebrows with Internet celebrities. They are all normal people. The sunset bar is great, it's nice to order a glass of wine. Unfortunately, Haijiao Xuan didn't experience it because of coming alone this time.

The only drawback is that the breakfast is relatively ordinary, the room plugs are less, the beach is not good, the takeaway cannot be delivered to the door, and the privacy of the hotel needs to be strengthened.
The three favorite places in the hotel: the bathtub where you can see the scenery outside the balcony, the logo of Im A fan, and the seaside tent at night. Sitting in a tent by the sea, watching the stars, listening to the sound of the waves, and lying in the arms of my lover, it is too romantic, and I will not forget the romance in this life~ I hope I can go to more Mandarin Oriental with my boyfriend in the future. .

Because of the epidemic, I missed the comfort, so I finally came to see the largest island in the motherland after carrying my bags. I think twice about choosing a hotel. I like to be quiet, and I like to lie down by the pool and soak up the sun. That kind of parent-child hotel, such as Atlantis, is directly out of my consideration. In the end, I chose Mandarin Oriental. The Mandarin Hotel feels that there is no mistake in which country to choose. Facts have proved that it is true. The only one opened in the military management zone, very quiet and comfortable. The whole hotel plan is also the kind I like, which happens to be off-season and there are not many people. Spend a few days lazily and let yourself go. I asked the hotel’s travel photography depar**ent to help me take good-looking photos. No worse than the Hawaii, Bali, and Caribbean seas I went to, such as Cancun and Varadero, Cuba. Fortunately, the weather is perfect, neither hot nor cold. The hotel service can be said to be top-notch. Special thanks to the housekeeper Han Xinyu Shona, who can be said to be meticulous. Must give a thumbs up here. Next time I come, I will still choose Mandarin Oriental, and I will also choose shona to help me arrange it. I feel relieved.

The design that is not practical for customers is the worst design. There is a charging plug by the bedside of the room. No, it is very inconvenient to boil hot water, and I am completely sorry for the price. The living environment and decoration are similar to that of the Express Hotel

msg:I chose a hotel for a long time before I traveled, and finally chose Mandarin Oriental and Edison. But after three days of staying, I was too satisfied and unsubscribed from Edison to continue staying in Mandarin. The water pavilion is recommended for 120 points. It is the garden and the beach and the sea when you go out. The swimming pool pavilion likes the convenience of swimming, and the two room types are very good. There are many water projects in the Mandarin Hotel, such as sailing, paddle boarding, and snorkeling. I haven't been out of the hotel for almost a few days. It is really a perfect leisure vacation. Special praise for the hotel’s service, especially the housekeeper Gao Jing Mia, who is responsive and patient and enthusiastic. He reminds us of various matters at any time. I am also the first time to provide professional and attentive replies during vacation, which makes us feel great during our stay. convenient. Next time I come to Sanya, I will choose Mandarin Oriental, and I will recommend it to friends around me!

One sentence summary: The guest is God [Shy] As long as you want it, no hotel can't do it [wangchai] Thanks again to my housekeeper, Ms. Gao Jing, Mia, okay 💋 This stay with the elderly and children, so There are a lot of minor situations, I have been troubled by Ms. Mia throughout the whole process. Thank you for taking care of me during the whole process. Thank you very much~ I also want to thank the middle-class brother Jack, who took the children to the beach and offered shoes and sunscreen, although he was very small. However, it shows that the hotel’s cultural and corporate training for employees is really customer-oriented. Finally, I would like to thank the manager and staff of the hotel’s Haijiao Xuan seafood buffet. The takeaway order was cancelled and no delivery. The kid was very hungry just after swimming, so there was no way. He went to ask the waiter for a bun, and the waiter agreed , I also gave a lot of skewers, I really appreciate it 🙏ps: The scenery of the hotel is beautiful, and it’s a film!

During the two days in the hotel, the weather was particularly good, and the feeling of blowing the sea breeze and listening to the wind bell was so graceful. Thank you so much for the gentle and sweet shona, the reply is timely and meticulous, and the experience will be even better after upgrading to the Sea Breeze Pavilion. There are no shortcomings in the room except for the small animal episode. I will want to live here next time and hope to meet the lovely shona.

The staff is very welcoming and will deliver fruit every day. It is no exaggeration to say that the fruit is the sweetest in the hotel I have ever stayed in. Room service Dong Hongling is also very considerate.
The sunset dinner should be booked in advance, it is a good memory.
You must experience the spa when you come! It will not let you down!

msg:Come to Sanya for your honeymoon~
Give the hotel a five-star rating. For those who like to take pictures, it feels like there is no need to go to any scenic spots in it, and the place is not crowded with adults.
Has its own beach, the water is quite blue, because it is in the coral area, so the sand
The beach will be a bit sloppy, but it's ok to play in the water.
We live in Haifeng Pavilion, and it feels like the sea is too open when the windows are opened
Cool! The hotel has a battery car. You can sit anywhere in the hotel if you want to go out of the room, but I think it’s okay to walk, and you can also enjoy the scenery on the way~
I clocked in the Haijiao Xuan restaurant and booked it early, so I can sit down
A good location. Before the typhoon, I was very nervous and I was afraid of rain. As a result, it was the sun and the setting sun these days. The scenery is beautiful~ The feeling of eating seafood on the beach with the sea breeze is great!
There is snorkeling in the hotel, we went to play in the morning, there are diving suits and equipment
Provided, it is very convenient. It can also help you to take a group photo and take a video. The time is an hour, but we may have just had breakfast, and we may vomit after soaking in the water for a long time, so it came up after about 40 minutes of playing. You can see a lot of small fish and corals.
There are free travel shots in the package of our hotel, which needs to be booked in advance.
Time, taking pictures of my brother Chen Siyuan is very good. I took a lot of pictures for you under the big sun. When I selected the photos the next day, all the photos were well-tuned, and I chose 5 for free~ All in all, the vacation of enjoying a slow life is too comfortable~

Environment: It is full of Southeast Asian wind, the day is beautiful, the sun is so good, the beach is so beautiful, seeing the emerald sea, it really makes the mood very happy.
Service: I have heard that MO’s service is well-known. As expected, it is here to commend luna, the little girl is beautiful, I added WeChat one day in advance, all kinds of careful greetings, all kinds of arrangements are properly arranged, second The day check-out was delayed until 2 o'clock, and the best room type was reserved. In short, the service was really attentive. Accommodation: Haifeng Pavilion 0220 is forcibly pushed. It’s really good. Since entering the yard, there are various styles. Many people say that the rooms are old, but I personally think it’s okay. Anyway, I think it’s more in line with the Southeast Asian style. Let’s talk about the hotel’s travel shots. I booked the time in advance. Here I want to praise Mr. Chen Siyuan, who is very hardworking and level. It is regrettable that the clothes I chose this time are not suitable. It is recommended for those who come to shoot. Wearing self-cultivation will be more beautiful, but Mr. Chen's picture is also very good, it's hard for him. If I didn't go back to rush to work, I really want to stay a few more days, or I will leave this little regret for the next time. Sanya, goodbye!

This time I have a special body. I will inevitably feel tired when I come to vacation with a little tiger treasure in my belly. Jing Ran KiKi, my housekeeper, not only upgraded the room type, but also carefully arranged the location of the room that is more convenient for me to move around. Every day I check in, I have caring greetings. I really feel that MO’s service is not only polite but also more caring. It’s just the weather in the past two days. The weather is uncertain, and I can’t go to the swimming pool for fear of the cold, but the a**osphere of the whole hotel is very holiday-like. Next time I will bring my family and the born tiger baby to play again, remember to try the hotel’s seaside buffet BBQ. The ingredients are fresh and appreciate by the way.

Southeast Asian style, composed of thirty or forty independent small buildings, scattered around, and long-distance commuting requires a shuttle bus. The overall style is simple and steady. Those who are used to the simple and modern style may feel old-fashioned, but I personally like it quite a bit. The rooms are well-regulated, the highlight is in the park, the design is exquisite, and various facilities are readily available. We experienced volleyball, basketball, paddleboard, slides, diving boosters, etc., and we enjoyed it very much. The heated swimming pool is long and deep, so you can go here if you want to take a serious swim.

The service is very good. Chen Shaotong, who received us, is very enthusiastic, has a friendly and amiable attitude, and can respond to customer inquiries promptly and patiently. In the face of some emergencies, he will also calm the guests' emotions, praise!

Quite a good experience. Will come again.

It felt like a room that no one had lived in for a long time. It had a strong musty smell. The housekeeper reported that he brought scented candles to cover the smell.
🍃Environment: The scariest thing is that there are spiders in the room🕷️There are also centipedes. They are not ordinary small spiders, they are the size of the palm of your hand. They scared the elderly so much that they even crawled into their clothes. I stayed there for two consecutive days and had a terrible experience. The Ritz-Carlton where I stayed overnight was far different in the same price range. The room was old and smelled of sweat from the staff. It was really not on the same level as the cultural oriental hotel I stayed in in other areas such as Guangzhou.

In addition, the quality of the Yiyang’s set meals is very good, grouper, braised chicken The pieces are delicious; disadvantages: the hotel’s breakfast needs to be improved, mainly because many of the food produced are very rough, such as the soup in the flour stall. Although there are as many as six kinds, most of them are very sloppy. The quality of the fried dishes in the hotel is basically black; the fried potato shreds used in the pancake stall are also dark, and many breads are close to bake. The most important thing is that the breakfast lacks a sense of exquisiteness and does not have sophistication. It will reduce the brand value of Wenhua, and there is a very obvious gap between Ritz-Carlton, Park Hyatt, and Edison in the breakfast session. You can visit the breakfasts of these restaurants. This aspect is in urgent need of improvement. Our family is still I like this Mandarin Hotel very much and hope that there can be a good development behind the hotel

At the front desk, there is a small refrigerator in the waiting area filled with drinks for free for guests. Although it is not a lot of money, there are several hotels that have this attitude. Although the price of the hotel is not cheap but I think it is worth it. It is a very suitable place for vacation. You can already enjoy the best side of Sanya in the hotel for three days.
After boasting, let me talk about a few points that I feel are insufficient.
1. The seaside buffet has a beautiful view. It is very dreamy to watch the sunset accompanied by the sound of the waves. But time is a bit awkward. The opening time is 6:30 when the sunset is the most beautiful, but they are bitterly queuing for the meal. It is suggested that you can arrange the start time flexibly according to the sunset time. In addition, the barbecue booth is too smokey but there seems to be no solution. The taste is really very general. It can only be said that the scenery is worth the price.
2. The beach chair cushion is wet after the rain and there is no solution. It is a bit embarrassing after the showers clear up. This can actually be solved.
3. The ground of the hotel itself has a certain height to the beach. The sand is mixed with coral stones and it is not easy to walk. If you can set up some steps to the beach, it will be more attentive.
Thanks again to Miss Liao Xiaohui for her attentive service. Next time I have a trip to Sanya, I will choose Mandarin Oriental again

msg:This time I came to Sanya to live in Mandarin Oriental in Coral Bend and Yanlord Crown in Haitang Bay. The services of the two have nothing to say. The Mandarin Oriental has a strong Southeast Asian style, and the hotel is one step at a time, with blockbuster movies everywhere. I thought that the children didn't have much to play with, but I didn't expect the children to fall in love with the battery car in the hotel. I booked a seaside buffet in advance. The seafood is fresh and the scenery is beautiful. Special thanks to Miss Chen Shaotong at the front desk for adding WeChat before checking in. The whole butler service is very nice and attentive! Next year, I will choose Mandarin Oriental in Sanya!

The buffet barbecue restaurant is the best place to watch the sunset, especially when we know that our plane is at night. Before I flew, the butler helped me arrange late check-out and airport drop-off, a hotel worth visiting again!

Hotel with the best environment and best service! freeking love it! The sea is also the cleanest ever seen in Sanya! Spike Yalong Bay Haitang Bay. Snorkeling, fishing, sailing, etc. are available in the hotel. There are so many items that you don’t need to leave the hotel. This time I lived in Haifeng Pavilion, and the scenery was super invincible, because it was the honeymoon travel housekeeper, Miss He Yuting, who also prepared the room decoration and welcome gifts. The people are also super enthusiastic. If you have any questions or need to make an appoin**ent, you can directly contact her. Super convenient! This time I came to Sanya and booked two hotels. My husband didn't want to leave when I changed hotels. If it wasn't for the second hotel, we would stay here again! My husband strongly urged that I would not go anywhere in Sanya in the future, and live in Mandarin Oriental! Hahahahaha 😂

There are a lot of fish in the snorkeling area, and a little ham will attract a large school of fish. After the low tide in the afternoon, you can catch crabs on the beach. We also saw Pippi shrimp, jumping fish, starfish, jellyfish... By the way, there are several squirrels living on the big tree by the pool.
Butler Yolanda Wang Jinxuan received us very warmly, because the flight was at night, and he also kindly helped us to check out late.

msg:🚗 Transportation: We went to the hotel directly by renting a car at the hotel. We checked in soon after we arrived at the hotel. There are many battery cars in the hotel, which is very convenient. You can call the car directly in the room, or stop the car or call the room directly on the road. They will arrange the call after the card. One day we came back from the duty-free shop quite late, and Chen Xizhe’s little brother was very diligent to pick us up. It was great.
🧹Hygienic: The hotel should have been for a while, but it is kept very clean, the bedding and towels are free of yellowing stains, and the toilet shower facilities and cabinets are free of dirt and dust.
🍃Environment: Undoubtedly superb, coming to Sanya is to stay in a hotel with a bay. There are few people and clear water. It is super healing to see such beautiful scenery every day. There are also many trees and flowers in the hotel. The overall style is partial to Southeast Asia, which makes it feel like a holiday.
🔔Service: 120 minutes, the housekeeper Jing Ran Kiki is gentle and considerate throughout the process, and can respond to any request in time. It is that the phone in our room has that kind of current noise. When I first called the spa, I told the young lady that they had an appoin**ent for repairs, but they had not been repaired. For other projects, we experienced spa and snorkeling. The spa volcanic shell project was warm, and the essential oils were super comfortable. The snorkeling instructor is also very patient, and he can also let the instructor use gopro to take photos and videos (for a fee). The breakfast at the hotel is rich in variety and delicious. Every morning, I have a bowl of noodle noodles and omelette. Others are served. It is comfortable and full of Chinese and Western food. It is great. I also went to experience the seafood barbecue buffet at Haijiao Xuan at night. The taste was average and the scenery was good.

All in all, I will come next time, a hotel suitable for a leisurely vacation.

The air conditioner makes strange noises in the middle of the night! ! On the last night, there were cockroaches under the sink! ! ! ! ! I really can’t complain! The environment of more than 2,000 yuan per night is really not as good as the Grand Hyatt in Haitang Bay with more than 1,000 yuan per night! The room is big! The balcony has a wide view! We could only see a few large coconut trees from the balcony of our room! No sea view at all! If I had known earlier, I might as well have stayed on the first floor since I couldn't see the sea and the price would have been cheaper! ! ! With such environmental facilities, the housekeeper and the buffet waiter asked us to give them good reviews on Ctrip Dianping! I think the good reviews are all due to them! Speaking of seaside buffets! Originally, the dining environment was just the same. The first row of tables were so densely packed that it was impossible to take good photos. Most of them were internet celebrities and the whole process was broadcast live! It’s so noisy that it affects your mood while eating! The special car to the airport didn't arrive on time as promised, and the pick-up driver got the wrong message. This hotel is really amazing! I don’t know how to manage it, but nothing goes smoothly. Even when I applied for discounts through cooperation with duty-free shops, it didn’t work! I have to pay the bill, but the duty-free shop said that the discount was not found! I waited in the store for more than half an hour! It really affects your vacation mood! I will never come to Mandarin again! Too disappointed! ! !

Listening to the sea to fall asleep, snorkeling underwater, and the trip shots sent are also very good ~ really really relaxing. It's a pity that when I booked the first-row viewing seat of the Haijiao Xuan restaurant, it rained indoors that day. The hotel's service is "home away from home", it's really welcoming, and it makes up for a little bit of obsolescence in the facilities to a large extent. Mrs. Callie He, the housekeeper, helped us to arrange the itinerary every time, from pick-up to check-out, and even reminded when to go to the airport to pick up duty-free goods. I also gave a lot of small gifts. amazing

At the same time, birthday cakes and decorations were arranged because of my birthday. Because I am a pregnant woman, I also take care of all aspects of the needs very well. I don’t have a coffee machine, but I sent a set


🍃Environment: Although the park is a bit old, it has a strong sense of vacation. It is very similar to the layout of the Bulgari Hotel in Bali. It is very Zen and what we need. No need to go out of the hotel to play
Restaurant: I’ve tried all the restaurants in the hotel. Maybe I’m more picky. There is no surprise. The Mandarin Oriental, which started in London and opened to Hong Kong, should be Cantonese cuisine. At least the one in Hong Kong is amazing. The Chinese restaurant here in Sanya is not too salty. The fresh Cape Xuan is not bad, the scenery is good, the buffet tastes ordinary but good by the sea
Spa: The spa is unexpectedly praised. The super large single-family room, the steam and sauna room and the special massage for pregnant women. It is very comfortable and the face is good. It is my favorite Spanish cinema brand.
🚗 Transportation: convenient
The travel package bought at the hotel is very good. The park is very popular. I took the pregnancy photos. After the baby is born, I will take my baby and the dog to go on vacation.

Let’s talk about Mandarin. The hotel is in Thai style. The villas are full of vacation style. The attitude of the service staff amazes me. The toiletries are diptyque, the water is Evian glass bottles, and the minibar is free, every day. I will be replenished, and I will ask you if you have enough. If you don’t have enough, you can bring it back. Every morning, the aunt will tidy up everything when I go out for breakfast and call the battery car whenever I go out. Wenhua is not a popular hotel. In the militarized management zone, sitting on its own beach, low-key, introverted, quiet in the noisy, I love it so much, I will still choose MO next time.

Water sports are also richer, although there is no way to experience it with a baby. Coral Bay's travel photography technology is also good and the price is reasonable. In addition, the hotel is super-released and must be arranged. But be sure to book as early as possible. We are not experienced enough to choose one day in advance and cannot add it.
I booked a swimming pool and sea view. The view is not good, so the experience is average. If I come again next time, I will choose a sea view room above the second floor, which has a wider view. After all, the public swimming pool is also quite large and beautiful.
The breakfast category is very rich, like carambola and jackfruit, coffee garland is also great. The taste of pastry is also very good.
The room is really old, the diptyque is great for toiletries, the minibar is free to drink, and the takeaway can be delivered directly to the room (although there is no order, I see a lot of brothers coming and going)

msg:At the 18th week of pregnancy, my husband took it for a stroll. Because I couldn't play entertainment, I just went to the hotel. I chose Mandarin Oriental for the last night in Sanya. They said the environment is good, so come and feel it. The hotel arranged for the housekeeper Wang Shouzhe to serve us. The little boy was very serious and responsible, and made it as convenient as possible for us. He helped us make an appoin**ent for the trip in advance. Later, because of the air ticket problem, he helped us modify the drop-off time in the middle of the night. Thank you very much.
The hotel is very large, you can call a battery car when you go out. There are many places to take pictures. There is no need to go out. The food is also delicious. My friend ordered the Haijiao Xuan Western Restaurant in advance but I did not order it. It is said to be super delicious. I go there at noon. After eating the noodles at the noodle shop, the grouper noodles are especially recommended! A few photos are attached. I especially like the scene of the swing. Other pregnant women don’t want to follow me to take photos. It’s still a bit dangerous. Please pay attention to your safety 😊

msg:The Wenhua in Sanya made me think that I came to Thailand. It was wonderful. I enjoyed it with my whole body and mind. When I first checked into the hotel, I would also give a dressing necklace prepared by every customer of Wenhua! Mr. Will, the housekeeper, was attentive and thoughtful throughout the whole process, paying attention to every detail. The room was arranged perfectly, very loving! The taste, environment, and service of the Haijiao Xuan Western Restaurant that were booked 3-5 days in advance have exceeded 100 points. You must choose Wenhua next time you come to Sanya!

The hotel’s facilities and services are very good, but a good housekeeper is even more important. The most important service experience, thank you very much! Really recommend!

The hotel has beautiful scenery and belongs to a Thai-style garden-style hotel. The water is very clear. You can catch the sea in the morning and evening. There are many small crabs, which are very cute. There are a lot of shade trees in the hotel, and the greening rate is very high. The breakfast is also very rich, I will choose here again when I come to Sanya.

msg:Mandarin Oriental is really a treasure hotel in Sanya, it is still very quiet during the summer. There is no old age, many places are many times as high-end and western as the hotels in the same price range in Long Bay. The most recommended is their snorkeling, just go out on their own beach, surrounded by ropes, very safe, and the paddle board provided in the package, my second grade is very happy. This is not available in other hotels. The entire hotel is well managed, and everyone's service awareness is very good, which makes people very comfortable. I strongly praise Su Qiongzan in the breakfast room. My child’s braces were pulled in the restaurant and was thrown away as trash (in a paper towel, others don’t know). He turned the trash bag 4 times in the back kitchen, about half an hour. , I am not afraid of being dirty or tired, and still taking care of us all the time, it is so touching. The only flaw is that his beach is not good, but there is also a small piece of fine beach in the snorkeling place. In addition, the line up when breakfast is late is really...

Very thoughtful and gentle! The hotel is also very convenient for travel. There is a car to pick up and drop off at any time. Secondly, the hotel pool has three great pools. One pool with slides is fun. The hotel also sent snorkeling and travel shots. Although snorkeling is a gift, the quality is high and it is worth it. Travel shots are also good. All in all, it was very worthwhile to spend two nights in the hotel. I was also very happy after spending two days in the hotel. ! !

The hotel is very quiet, has a strong sense of vacation, and green coverage. High thief, very beautiful, although it is very big, but there is a small car to pick up and drop it is very convenient, the room is also very comfortable, the layout is very like, the only minor shortcomings, the room type can not be cast on the screen.

On my dad’s birthday on the day of check-in, the hotel upgraded the room type for free and furnished it. I was very moved. Butler Wang Shouzhe’s service was very good. He also helped arrange sailing for the next day after 11 o’clock in the evening. He gave the baby a cute squirrel. The girl liked it very much. The hotel’s swimming pool is very good, there are some entertainment facilities such as slides, next time you come to Sanya will continue to stay.

msg:In 2014, when the child was one year old, it was the first time to stay in Cultural Oriental. The experience was very good. A set of sand dredging toys was given as a gift. Every employee I met would greet them from the heart. They are very enthusiastic and motivated. Among the picky, my husband caught a cold and the employee ran out to help buy medicine. Therefore, after 7 years, we chose Wenhua again, and we were quite disappointed with the service. We started before we checked in. After reading the evaluation, the housekeeper would contact us in advance. But we didn’t wait and booked Haijiao Xuan restaurant. I took the initiative to call to make an appoin**ent. The housekeeper was added after I requested it. After adding, I didn’t take the initiative to contact, and I often couldn’t respond to the questions I asked. After I checked in, I found that the employees were not as active as before. Enthusiasm, of course, I also understand that there is a high probability that the summer vacation will not be too busy. It may be better than most other hotels, but it is not comparable to the previous Mandarin, and the breakfast is not as exquisite as before, although the variety of Chinese food is now increasing. Also, sand dredging toys are no longer given away, they are sold instead. But there are also surprises. The landscape in the hotel is still very beautiful. When you walk to the fragrance of plumeria, the beach and the sea are much better than before, and a lot of online celebrity check-in points have been added, which is very suitable for taking pictures! The quality of the travel shots I sent was also quite high, and later I added money to buy all the negatives. Regarding the restaurant, I personally do not recommend the seafood buffet! The price/performance ratio is too low. Although the lobsters are not limited, they are all frozen and worthless. The steaks are also very ordinary and there are too many people. Anyway, I was disappointed after trying it once. What's even more regrettable is that we had originally booked the Haijiao Xuan for two nights, but in the event of a small typhoon, the outdoor dining was cancelled and changed to indoor. Without the sea view, there would be no soul, so we cancelled it. However, the hotel’s Yiyang restaurant is highly recommended! We ate three meals without stepping on thunder. The coconut rice and coconut jelly were very delicious.

It was too close to the city and some apar**ents found it too noisy that I missed MOSAN for many years. . I really didn't want to go to Haitang Bay to join in the fun this year, so I chose Coral Bay, which was really pleasantly surprised. The hotel has an exclusive bay, very quiet, and can also snorkel, children like it very much. The service is also very good, from the housekeeper to the restaurant service staff, they are very sincere and enthusiastic; I also thank the housekeeper Han Xinyu shona, who helped us arrange various activities through WeChat and met various requirements. I also thank her and her colleague Gao Jing mia, Helped the children to decorate the birthday decorations and had an unforgettable birthday. . I will continue to choose MO in the future

The hotel is very big, where you can call a battery car, or you can walk and explore on your own, maybe you will find it by accident. What I like most is that there are no mosquitoes in the hotel, which is so comfortable. There are many swimming pools in the hotel, some of which are sea-view swimming pools. The breakfast is very rich and delicious, and there are many kinds of welcome fruits. It is definitely the hotel of choice for a seaside holiday. There is also a one-to-one butler service upon check-in, which is very considerate. Next time I go to Sanya, I will come again.

msg:There are scenery everywhere, just like living in a park! The rooms are very clean and well decorated. The drinks in the small refrigerator will be replenished for free once a day. The beach is a hotel, there are not many people, and there are many check-in spots. Especially famous should be the dinner under the sunset. Because of the coral reefs, there are quite a lot of rocks on the beach, a little bit shabby. The sea is very blue, with several layers of color.
Children’s clubs are free or chargeable, and you can get what you need.
All feedbacks can be responded in time, which is very considerate!
It just feels that the breakfast variety is slightly less.
The housekeeper Shona (Han Xinyu) was especially considerate, because it was the birthday of the children on the day of leaving the shop, and the night before, he specially prepared small cakes for the room decoration. The children are too surprised, so I need to take a photo with the young lady when I leave the store! It's a pity that Shona rested that day.
Zhang Jinwei, the filming supervisor of the travel shoot, is very dedicated, braving the big sun not only to guide the posture, but also to remind him that the action is too big or too small...
A very good experience!

msg:The hotel is very big, but there are battery cars to pick up and drop off. Because we also lived in Mandarin Oriental in Xishuangbanna before, we have never been disappointed.
Because we are with our children, we booked a room type with a courtyard in Biyuanxuan.
The hotel breakfast is very rich, because the children want chocolate donuts 🍩, the waiter also specially helped us to talk to the chef, specially made 2 for the children individually, the favorability increased.
The butler I met was a young man named Will. He is very enthusiastic in dealing with people, and he will reply to me as soon as possible to help me solve any questions.
I kindly recommended the attractions near Wenhua to me, thank you very much, guy.
There is no need to praise the hotel environment, because it is just over there and it is satisfactory.
We booked a sunset dinner at the restaurant, Haijiao Xuan.
Because I was going out with my parents, the small table over there can only accommodate 3 places. Of course, I also specially booked two small tables at the front and back for the sake of taking pictures.
As a result, my old Li said that he wanted to put together a table, and the waiter came to help us.
But I wasn't happy... Anyway, the table was separated again at my request.
Special thanks to the two service staff who served us that day-He Fangfang Cathy and Tian Yingying.
They took the trouble to help us set up the table, because it was so heavy that they couldn't see the impatience on their faces, but kept saying it's okay.
Then they will be very enthusiastic to take pictures for us📷
Anyway, although there is a small unsatisfactory episode, the process and ending are perfect.
Next time I go to Sanya, I should still choose here.
Because everything can satisfy you without leaving home.
Not only can you swim and eat at the hotel, you can also snorkel and play water sports to shoot crystal boats... see you next time!

msg:三亞文華東方請先讓我來一個大大的好評！
這次淡季來三亞，想選一個奢華酒店帶麻麻也體驗一下，選的眼睛都要花了訂了文華東方，來了果然沒有讓我失望。
1.環境不必説，公區的果凍海，露天泳池，處處都是景，最後退房了媽媽還想在沙灘邊再看看，正好趕上大晴天，景色絕佳。
2.服務是重中之重，從一下車，你的每一步都有服務人員安排指引，不會讓你覺得有不明白不清楚的地方，不管是負責綠植的叔叔，還是路過的服務生，有問必答，早餐廳偶然遇見的的陳永旭小姐姐給我細心帶路，值得表揚。
！在此特別要感謝我的管家Angel小妹妹，應該是很年輕的小女孩，提前聯繫我到店時間，有何需求，能滿足的都儘量滿足，不能滿足的一些問題也沒有怠慢，比如取外賣食物，幫我聯繫擺渡車去拿，服務真的有做到事事有迴應，而且不卑不亢，我很欣賞文華東方的這種服務態度。Angel妹妹從接待到離店，讓帶着長者的我感覺自己沒有被忘記沒有被忽視，喜歡，下次還來，就沖服務。
早餐也是棒棒噠，品種多，主要是精緻，乾淨，鮮榨果汁炫了4杯，好吃，愛吃。

來三亞在海棠灣住了嘉佩樂和艾迪遜，回到市內又住了文華東方，整體文華東方比較方便，在酒店內還約了一次spa比較放鬆！酒店更有東南亞風格，拍照很出片，臨海吃自助的話更有氛圍感，這次住的房間對面就是鞦韆打卡地，管家Rena安排的很滿意，還佈置了房間，算是有求必應了，關健她人美身材好還很細心，值得推薦！

房間衞生挺好的 洗護沐浴產品是西柚味的很香 一次性用品質感很好 但是房間不大
早餐種類不是很多但是少而精 鮮榨果汁和龍蝦餛飩還有豆腐腦油條都挺好吃 符合北方人口味
公共區域很美好多人拍照 泳池很多 我們帶着孩子住了三晚沒有離開過酒店基本上就是在泳池泡着 一邊游泳一邊看着大海吹着海風還是挺愜意的
晚上沙灘上會有好多小螃蟹可以帶小朋友看看但是沙灘比較渣腳穿沙灘鞋會好一點
着重感謝一下管家Angel 入住期間服務很好 很熱情 響應很及時 還送了小朋友一個松鼠玩偶 並且退房後知道我們要返程去機場一直到了晚上還在關心是否平安抵達目的地 很貼心
總之淡季去人少體驗感還是不錯的

服務也不錯，除了Kennys小夥子的貼心服務，還有非常温柔的前台小姐姐，幫忙拿行李的外國大叔，接駁車的司機小哥們每次在路上見到我們都會問需不需要幫助，還有打掃院子的大姐們熱情的打招呼
酒店園區很大很美，每一步都是景，泳池也好漂亮，出太陽的時候海水也不錯，沙灘有些紮腳，珊瑚很多，礁石縫裡好多螃蟹，很有樂趣，下次去的話一定多待幾天

msg:這次淡季帶娃去三亞踩踩水，還是選擇了文華東方。
這次入住自己帶着浮潛裝備下海浮潛了好多次，感覺非常好！
先説下酒店的優點
人少: 可能是淡季關係，整個海灘人非常少，幾乎都是包場的感覺
水清:這裏的海水真是無敵了，隨隨便便就是果凍海，浮潛的地方很淺，魚多，能見度非常高。
衞生:老牌的五星級酒店了，衞生情況非常好，由於帶着不到2歲的小寶寶，小孩子喜歡到處摸，我習慣先用酒精把孩子喜歡碰的地方都擦一下的， 酒店完全擦不出灰，打掃的非常乾淨！
服務: 管家Mia和前台服務都非常好，升級房型，提前入住，延遲退房都很爽氣！

然後説説缺點
小童樂園:文華東方的小童樂園，真的可以用簡陋來形容了。 沒有滑滑梯，沒有海洋球，沒有一切比較大的遊樂設施。
小童樂園用的樂高，還都是山寨的！其實這東西正版的也沒多少錢，何必呢。

小童泳池: 沒有什麼適合小朋友玩的泳池，沙池開放時間也很短，恆温泳池水太深，不適合小小朋友。

另外沙灘邊上也沒有配備小童挖沙的玩具這些。

總體來説這次入住還是很滿意的，如果小童設施能在完善一下，那就可以説完美了！

從上到下每一個細節都超級滿意，離開酒店還有些不捨，明年再來度假！

早餐還算豐盛，那個雲吞是真的彈牙好吃。
為二不足就是，一是咬人的那種小蟲子（不是蚊子）比較厲害，噴了防蚊水不管用，腳上都是包，二是不能下海游泳，衹能浮潛，浮潛是外包的，借個救生衣都要租金（可能之前在柏悦服務太好了，在這個環節有點兒落差😅）。
日落吧那地兒很棒，喝點兒東西，趁着日落，看書發呆，別有一番滋味。
另外，管家Rita服務挺周到的，還給小孩子準備了馬卡龍，小孩子開心壞了。😀
整體來説，五星體驗吧。

msg:長文慎點❗️深度分享三亞文華東方入住體驗🏝️

是朱珠一家度假的同款酒店
《安寧如夢》團建的酒店
超多明星陳坤、趙露思等等都來過💛

📍位置
獨享大東海的珊瑚灣，入住即享受到真正承包整片海灘🏖️這片海是紅珊瑚保護區，浮潛很美，另外這塊區域還是一處****外面的人一般進不來，私密性很高。

🏠房型

文華東方是分為山、海、天三個區域

⛰️山：豪華客房+套房，酒店的最後一排，樓層高。
優點是住的高，看海景，高層也相較於低層來説房間不會那麼潮濕。缺點是失去了住在文華東方離海近的特點。三亞住的酒店中，文華東方是距離海墜近的一家。

🌊海：閣式客房
在酒店前排，上下層。這個房型非常推薦，優點距離泳池和海都比較近。

☁️天：別墅
在酒店最右側。分為觀海、南海和珊瑚灣別墅。別墅有自己的check-in 區域，並且有每天5件洗衣、下午茶，送機/接機等各種福利。文華東方別墅真的是一切都拉滿了，因為有兩層，看日落絕美。

🏝️風景
根本不需要總結文華東方的打卡機位，這裏真正地做到了一步一景，非常美🌊

🥗美食
被贊爆的海邊餐廳天花板就在這裏-海角軒日落餐廳🍴需要提前預約，價格隨月份變動，離海真的非常非常近

💁♀️服務
文華東方的服務真的沒得説，路過工作人員都會打招呼問好，在酒店是可以做到完全不用步行的，出門就有擺渡車，可以提前預約擺渡車，很快就會來。入住就會給客人佩戴上有文化東方logo的項鍊，入住前一天管家會聯繫你詢問入住要求，我們還提前預約了體驗電車送站的服務，立省50+。📷入住酒店會贈送伯爵旅拍5張➕15s短視頻。但女孩子真的很難忍住不多拍，基本最後都會再付費多買，有一説一這裏的旅拍攝影師確實不錯。

ps：
1.墜後一張附酒店地圖🗺️入住退房時可與前台溝通自留房卡做紀念哦
2.下一篇分享超人定的觀海軒房型沉浸式視頻

msg:第一次去文華東方是充滿期待的，特別是帶着長者家去，更希望這次的行程能夠讓家人舒心順暢。
當四天三晚的旅行結束時，我可以坦誠地講，在管家mm 浣思語Angle的幫助和服務下，這次旅行增添了許多開心和温暖。
首先，在入住酒店之前一天，Angle就主動聯繫並添加了我的微信，活潑熱情而又恰到好處的溝通讓我對即將開始的入住多了一些憧憬。
入住第一天，就收到Angle手寫的一張小卡片。與以往收到的問候卡片不太一樣，大段的問候話語與精巧的小字能看出她的認真和誠懇。果然，在接下來的幾天裏，我們幾乎無時無刻感受到她的貼心、細緻、周到和活力。
因為帶着長者，所以對旅行舒適度要求較高，Angle不厭其煩悉心服務，在房間安排、清潔打掃、溝通交流、幫助身體不適的長者申請延遲退房等等許多方面展示出非常成熟幹練的工作技能，以及熱情周到細緻的服務風格。點點滴滴，不在此贅述。並且她在幫我們解決困難和問題的同時，還主動從我們客人的角度考慮問題，解決後顧之憂。這讓我和我母親很多時候都感覺到她比其他許多更資深的管家都要好。
當我得知她衹是一位實習生時，我更是發自內心感歎，這個小姑娘可以的👍。
總之，我從這位小姑娘身上看到她對這份工作的熱愛和自身的高素質水平，如果文華東方的每位員工都如她一般，那麼文華會美上加好。
旅行是一程一程的體驗，希望我們每個人都能遇到美好，讓內心充滿温暖，也給周邊的人温馨和力量！

msg:三亞度假出行首選，住過很多次了，公區基本沒有對手，房型全部都是清一色聯排起步，相比其他一棟樓幾百套的酒店度假風情不可同日而語，泳池閣房型也部分解決了低價房一些設施問題，比如配置了咖啡機，吹風機
缺點也很明顯，一些固有問題房間面積偏小、設施需要翻新短期沒法改進可以理解，但客房部對客人響應速度遲緩，基本的如衞生紙、飲用水、浴巾準備不充分，補充不及時，泳池房型無救生圈且要求個人自己去公共泳池借用就很不應該了，這些都需要引起管理方足夠重視，都是細小問題但對客人的體驗感會很糟糕
還是希望酒店能加強管理，不要辜負如此美景和景觀

服務：有專門的的管家接洽，有任何事情管家都能幫忙處理，體驗感很好！在這特別感謝管家Ellie，服務特別棒👍🏻

泳池房的設計太讚了，每天公共泳池游完再回房間遊會兒太享受。無論在哪兒，睡個好覺很重要，這個房型的床品非常好，床墊非常舒適。
我們根據自己喜好在酒店單點的餐，味道很不錯。
酒店整體服務水平都不錯，感謝管家mia，幫我們積極解決問題，相信她的真誠友善，也是遊客旅途美好回憶中的一部分。
如果下次還來三亞，文華東方絕對是必選酒店！

msg:難得假期，第一次帶母上大人和阿姨來三亞，提前做了好久的功課， 看評論選酒店到頭暈，最後選擇來了文華東方，結論-物有所值，媽媽和阿姨很開心🥳
環境：
度假感真的很好很好，早上還看到過小松鼠！之前看有些評論説酒店有點舊了 來了之後想説真的還好 獨家海灘🏝️公區環境超級出片￼

服務：
雖然酒店不便宜，不過大家也都是普通打工人，來之前對服務沒有特別的期待，不過這裏碰到的很多工作人員都很好：
禮賓部小哥Danny，每次碰到都會Say Hi，超級親切，微笑滿滿，最後一天退房，中午大太陽，還沒有來得及吃午飯，幫我們樓上樓下搬運行李，超級超級辛苦！希望下次入住還可以遇見～

我的管家Mia，人美心善，入職前就加我微信，每天早上都要關心今天的行程，有什麼需要幫忙的，每次有各種問題詢問，微信都是秒回，帶長輩超級省心！

最後這次帶媽媽阿姨體驗了一直心心念唸的Mo家Spa～海角軒餐廳-～無邊泳池…

三亞温度適宜 母上大人腿舒服很多 五星好評～
最後希望酒店越來越好～大家工作開心🥳

旅拍的體驗也讓我們很喜歡，寶貝之前在別的酒店的鉑爵旅拍拍攝過體驗很好，這次在文化東方的體驗也是十分愉快，期待下次再來時還可以給寶貝和家人留下美好的時光。

msg:三亞的文華東方我住過幾次了，這次帶父母來三亞度假一週，想都沒想就給他們安排了2晚文華，好好體驗一下三亞最美最好玩的酒店。
説實話我挺矛盾的，酒店的好和不好都太極端了，因為是老酒店，房間設施非常一般，住了2晚嘉佩樂再住文華落差很大，但酒店的外環境太好了，泳池漂亮，而且有樹遮陽不曬，海邊漂亮，一步一景，還能浮潛撿貝殼，早餐豐富又好吃，特色龍蝦餛飩、和牛米粉，一天兩碗，我個人覺得比嘉佩樂還好！
入住的2天，剛好週末，3場婚禮，把工作人員累的夠嗆，但就算這樣大家也給我們提供了優質的服務，這方面沒得説。
管家KiKi，是我們這次入住的3家酒店裡我最喜歡的管家，沒有之一！為了她，我會繼續住文華，真的是事事有迴應，體貼又周到，熱情又有分寸，真想安利給所有酒店的管家，讓他們學學一位優秀的管家應該是怎麼樣的，能提供給顧客多麼高的情緒價值！有這樣優秀的員工，怪不得文華的入住率會那麼高。
這麼好的地段和景觀，這麼好的員工，這麼高的入住率，咱們業主能不能花點錢把房間翻新一下，泳池旁邊的廁所重新設計增加更衣室、沙灘設定洗腳池等等，不然每次給人推薦文華的時候，都害怕吃我安利的人對房間失望。
真的是太矛盾了！！！

去年和今年我的管家都是Kennys，一直都是微信聯繫沒見過真人，這次巧合退房的時候看見了還是個小帥哥😜很滿意的管家服務，從來之前溝通我喜歡的房間號幫我留房，到歡迎禮遇和送了心心念唸的小松鼠🐿️整個過程都很愉快😊

msg:缺點：設施非常老舊，服務差，沙灘全是珊瑚礁碎片，拖鞋走上去會不舒服
1.房門不用力推是不能完全關上的，房門會呈虛掩着的狀態，就是完全看不出門沒鎖，但是門就是可以直接推開。

2.夜燈和落地燈是壞的，我在想我入住之前沒人檢查的嗎，前面的住客應該反應過這個問題了吧，這個檔次的酒店燈還是壞，我真的無語，我住的不是招待所吧

3.馬桶是最傳統抽水馬桶，介於酒店建的早，這個我就不多説了，我嘗試去理解，介意的朋友可以提前繞道

4.淋浴房下水有問題，淋浴超過五分鐘，淋浴房外直接水漫金山，我出來差點被滑倒，長者和孩子千萬要注意了，晚上12點洗完澡準備睡了，這事兒直接就氣醒了，跟管家反應，管家直接説大半夜讓人過來修，我直接給氣笑了，直到離店管家也沒給任何説法，也沒有表示任何的事情歉意，連道別和歡迎下次再來也沒有，自問我全程都很禮貌，沒有得罪人家


5.因為前一家住的柏悦高層海景客房，下樓麻煩，所以來MO想住個吃飯方便，出行方便的房間，選的園林景觀房，這個房型很奇葩，內設有兩個天井，天井很臟，沒人打掃，靠倆簾子隔絕天井，天井沒有照明，晚上就很黑，這個房間天井簾子還是壞的，晚上就感覺陰森，很膈應！

6.空調聲音很大，下面貼了視頻了，我愛人睡的淺，晚上被空調吵醒過一次.

7.房間內放了兩雙塑膠拖鞋在衣帽間，感覺就是很久沒洗了，簡直臭的可以！

8.因為出來帶了很多數碼產品，需要充電，卧室有四個充電口，有倆是接觸不良的…充電很難受。

9.平時是攝影愛好者，有帶無人機拍攝，之前可能功課沒做夠，整個酒店包括周圍很大片區域都是禁飛區，航拍愛好者可以繞道了。

優點：酒店打卡點不少，有的地方是比較出片的，酒店內有電瓶車接送，進出算是便利點了。

總結，可以來拍照，入住的話，選擇還有很多！

服務：管家Rita也很專業，有耐心而且特貼心。去之前提前備註了紀念日也給稍微佈置了一下，也送了小蛋糕。房型的位置提前選的3608也幫着留出來了，很貼心。酒店電瓶車服務也特別好隨叫隨到 禮賓小哥都非常的熱情，有禮貌。
還定了水榭的雙人海邊自助，種類並不是很多，如果坐在海邊的座位去取餐還要上兩三層台階，帶長輩的要謹慎考慮座位的選取。
旅拍攝影師還比較會互動，選片的時候到了預約的時間後還多等了半小時左右，而且也就看了半小時到四十分鐘分鐘左右工作人員就説看的時間久了，就開始推薦讓多選照片的套餐了，選片時候體驗感很一般。
環境：環境很好，綠植很多
設施：房間設施設備也都很齊全，除了稍微有一點潮，是可以接受的。
以上僅供大家參考

進入房間後在衞生間居然可以看到打掃衞生遺留下的抹布，瞬間心情極差，後來管家同事送一個椰子過來彌補。
後來要求換房，等酒店的擺渡車等了半個多小時，需要自己一直打電話催，都不知道提供的管家服務是幹嘛的。
在酒店內遇到工作人員都會主動和客人打招呼，這點不錯。
已經提前告知管家退房時間，管家也不會安排擺渡車，也是要自己聯繫。
每次遇到問題，衹會把責任推給同事，而不是先儘快解決問題。
總之有管家等於沒有，還不如不提供這種服務，形同虛設。

管家景冉Kiki幫我升級了房型，還送了一瓶葡萄酒，挺有心的，態度也挺好的，基本發消息都是秒回。酒店私密性挺好，早餐品種非常豐富，平時從不吃早餐，但是來到文華酒店每天都要來體驗。酒店的風景和環境也挺好的，雖然設施老了點，還是抵不住風景的美。給兩點建議1是房間洗澡的拖鞋可以換一下，不匹配酒店的檔次。2每天都會送一瓶依雲水，但是喝完了再要衹有農夫山泉，希望酒店能更換一下，換成怡寶或者娃哈哈等都能理解！下次來三亞還是會考慮文華酒店。

酒店的設施稍微陳舊，但舒適、整潔的房間和公共區域綠化提升了住宿體驗。
特別要提的是：海角軒的晚餐環境非常棒，餐品也比預期美味，值得體驗～酒店贈送隨機的旅拍也讓人很驚喜，每個房間5張，又心甘情願買了很多照片～（自己對海灘草坪做了佈置，照片效果很滿意）
可惜，浮潛由於時間和海浪原因，沒有約上…帶了孩子和長者，整體度假很滿意，值得推薦！
最遺憾是…退房時在酒店房間遺失了一件衞衣，過了幾天想起來 沒有找到）

環島自駕最後一站，定了五天四晚的MO，期待拉滿。酒店給我的感覺是不夠努力的天賦型選手，地段，酒店設計，MO自帶的底藴都沒的説，在春節旺季也絲毫不顯擁擠，拍照更是一步一景，美不勝收。説缺點：1）餐飲之拉垮簡直不敢相信，甜品起酥類沒有一個是脆的。第一天早餐自助的特色和牛海南粉上來粉居然是一坨粉餅。四天早餐水果區都沒有芒果，最後一天要來半個芒果。2）與園林綠化相伴相生的蚊蟲是要做好準備和接受的，但我沒想到如此慘烈，海風閣離海近，第三天開始房間就有檳榔蟲之類的黑蟲飛進來，陽台躺椅更是不能躺。檳榔蟲殺傷力可不是普通的蚊子，第三天起我在酒店都是長褲保命，睡覺都不脱。樓下的嬉水聞濤門口還有大草坪，配的户外泡池更是在草叢中，泡起來估計是與蟲共舞，住了四晚沒看到一個人泡的。

酒店的建築風格獨具特色，完美融合了現代設計與傳統元素，讓人彷彿置身於一個充滿異國風情的世外桃源。客房寬敞且設施齊全，每一個細節都彰顯出酒店對品質的極致追求。

然而，最讓我難以忘懷的，是管家Mia的貼心服務。從入住的那一刻起，她就如同一位知心的朋友，無微不至地照顧着我的每一個需求。無論是安排行程、推薦美食，還是提供旅行建議，她總是能夠準確地理解我的意圖，並給予恰到好處的幫助。Mia的熱情與專業不僅體現在她的工作態度上，更在於她對每一位客人的真誠關懷。

此外，酒店的其他員工也展現出了同樣高水準的專業素養和服務精神。無論是在餐廳、前台還是健身中心，他們總是面帶微笑，熱情周到地為客人提供各種便利。

總的來説，三亞文華東方酒店不僅擁有得天獨厚的自然環境和一流的硬件設施，更有一支訓練有素、服務熱情的員工團隊。特別是管家Mia的貼心服務，更是為我的旅程增添了許多難忘的回憶。在這裏，我強烈推薦三亞文華東方酒店作為度假的首選之地。

正逢春節假期旺季，剛好可以考驗一家酒店的真正實力如何。
三點到店無法入住，告知需要等待，等待時間不確定，辦好入住後移步旁邊的日落吧等待，人太多，點單叫不到服務員，服務員來了告訴主食這些需要等待1個小時，因為需要和樓下餐廳共用廚房。於是我們叫了外賣，外賣到了之後被告知不可以在餐廳吃，需要挪到室內的一個桌子吃。從前到後，服務態度都還是很好，即使我表現出了不悦，也是在盡力安撫。入住的第一印象就很不好。
房間確實已經非常陳舊了，連馬桶都沒有換成自動的，打掃也不算乾淨，門口還堆着很多蛇皮袋子，看得出春節打掃的匆忙。但是即使很忙，也還是還鋪了夜床，感謝。
早餐不錯，小朋友醒得早，去得早人很少，鮮榨果汁很博好感，品種也比較豐富，比起晚餐自助燒烤1388一位還給你工業果汁來説良心太多。
提前加了管家微信，響應及時，也送了馬卡龍小點心。每一位服務人員的態度還是不錯的，電瓶車響應也很快。
總體來説，和海棠灣的艾迪遜，嘉佩樂還是不好比，屬於第二梯隊吧，有種廉頗老矣 尚能飯否的無力感。

msg:感謝管家Rita，文華是一個非常非常好的酒店。住的非常舒服。早上吃飯的時候感覺到住的人應該是挺多的，但是你走在園區裏面就覺得每一個地方都沒有什麼人，不會很吵了，不會拘束，就是有一種獨享的感覺。這個出門就有車，去哪裡都是車接車送，叫車應答很快，然後需要什麼管家都會第一時間給房間送上。伯爵旅拍也拍的非常好看，免費送五張，如果再多加一張的話加80元錢。體驗感受非常的好啊，以至於後面換到了天域之後心裏面有落差。總的來説就是一個非常舒服的地方。

其次，文華東方的餐飲質量真的是我這次來的度假酒店中最出色的，其實我連續幾年去香格里拉入住了，那裡的餐飲真的是一年不如一年了，文華東方的早餐受到了老太太和小朋友的一致稱讚👍。
最後，文華東方的公區景色特別贊，旅拍技術出色，是唯一一家我購買照片的旅拍。娛樂很齊全，早上趕海好多寄居蟹，小螃蟹，下午可以帆船，浮潛，游泳（恆温泳池面對大海）。
以後三亞文華東方是必須再來的。

2.設施：一棟棟建築各有特色，乘坐電瓶車來回大堂和住處別有一番體驗。美中不足的是我們所住的房間燈光不太明亮。
3.服務：管家Lily有問必答，提供了很好的幫助。早餐比較豐盛。

總之，是一家會再次選擇入住的酒店。

管家Kennys在入住前就聯繫我們瞭解需求，到店後幫忙升級了房型，讓我們很快就入住了。住店期間有問必答，溝通愉快。
房間確實有些舊，但是比較乾淨。
中餐廳“倚洋”好吃，推薦。
帶滑梯的泳池好漂亮，非常想在裏面游泳，但是在維護，希望之後可以經常開放。

付費的項目旅拍槳板帆船水療晚餐自助我都去了，服務人員都非常奈斯，免費的泳池的工作人員卻顯得不那麼令人舒暢，衹有一個泳池，深度1.3米，沒有大人一起下水不讓小朋友進，大人在岸上也不行，沒有辦法，雖説是為了安全考慮，但工作人員強硬的和不關己的態度讓人不那麼舒服。
關於管家，這條評價是管家反覆和我在微信上發消息讓我來點評的，這次來三亞我住了三個酒店，每個酒店都以管家的形式在微信上互動，文華東方的管家，怎麼説呢？我回看了一下聊天記錄，當我説想要去浮潛她確實也幫我去約去確認，雖然效率沒有我自己去約高，但也是可以的，第二個她主動做的是幫我去約旅拍，第三個她主動做的，是在我退房後反覆和我要評價。我想説，顧客都已經花了兩千多來住一個晚上，加上其他付費項目四五千，得到優質的住店感受不是應該的嗎？我一個人帶兩個小童，管家都沒有主動提供一下小童拖鞋小童浴袍，可能她都不知道我是這樣的情況，衹是跟流程化地在工作。

美中不足是沒體驗到酒店的浮潛項目，一連三天都水位低不開放，太遺憾了。
酒店公共區域風景很美，所以有很多穿着“漂亮”的美女跟着攝影師在拍照，有點影響體驗，也不知道是不是住店的客人，酒店進門竟然沒有查訂單或者房卡之類的，讓我感覺安全性不高，有些不安。

msg:這個地方就是很難説，雖然不是親子酒店，服務是有一點設施也有一點環境也有一點。但是真的很不舒服。可能就是太網紅了，雖然定位不是親子酒店，但是現在小孩很多，早上吃飯小孩就一直蹦蹦蹦，很影響吃飯心情。不講早餐的品質，實際上就是很普通。可能就是因為人太多了，取餐點也不夠乾淨整潔。就餐的地方室內很熱，室外就是小孩太吵。整體入住體驗很差。並不符合它度假酒店的定位。泳池也不行。酒店晚上要佈置海邊吃飯其實也不適合在海邊散步。然後出行的接駁車總是要接滿一車人並且路都是單行道，所以有時候去一個很近的地方又擁擠又很慢要繞很久，然後每輛車都會開很近又開很快，我每次坐都覺得很不安全。就經常開着開着就壓到邊上石子路然後石子路又離植物什麼很近，很容易刮到。前面也説它就跟有強迫症一樣基本每次都要接滿一車人，所以有時候坐滿坐背對方向的座位更搖晃更不安全。它環境確實還行，也努力夠服務。但實在水平不行。退房的時候也沒有人幫忙把行李放車上，退房處就兩個人一個女的一個男的，女的還呆呆的。有一説一入住體驗比不上五星酒店，五星酒店是大門經常有很多人站着服務退房客人搬行李的。總體而言，要看景色，現在三亞沒有私人沙灘這個説法，它的景色不夠好到為環境買單。服務真的是比不上普通四五星的酒店。至於插頭什麼的設施不夠現代我想很多點評都反映過了。酒店沒有高樓然後樓道也黑漆漆的，我覺得晚上我就不想出去，出去做接駁車的體驗也不好。真的不如那種高樓的酒店下樓就可以很近走到沙灘舒服。它真的晚上太黑了，去想去的地方總有一種被束縛的感覺。我覺得大家有錢沒必要當這個冤大頭，它太一般了。

帶小孩過來玩 管家Lily提前一天聯繫了 來的當天遺落了一份租出車上 Lily在三樓幫我取了送房間，晚上還幫我預約了餐廳，跨年當天給我們發了晚上的活動表 安排得明明白白 很贊，下次還會選擇入住！

msg:環境：入住體驗超級好，風格是東南亞風，一處一景非常出片，海水很清很美，出片率超過蜈支洲島和椰夢長廊。雖然沙灘不太細膩，但是海是真的美。非常適合度假，放鬆。

服務：這次遇見了神仙管家Lily, 給我們升級了房型，並且每天早上問好和隨時響應客人需求，十分貼心！特別滿意。酒店的其他工作人員，也是每天笑臉相迎，方方面面都十分周到。但是旺季擺渡車等待時間較長。

設施：床品還是很舒服的，住了四晚睡的很滿意。雖然房間設施和設計有些老舊，但是還可以接受，不影響入住體驗。

唯一遺憾的一點，預約的海邊燒烤因為下雨改到了室內，想重新預約但是其他日期的位置都不太好。

綜上：下次還會來住文華東方，還會繼續聯繫Lily當管家～～～

服務：較熱情主動，好溝通，獲得了免費升房及延遲退房
設施：陳舊、有損壞，影響使用

總體感受，環境優美、服務熱情、功能區較完善，喜歡酒店的Spa。
不如人意之處有二，一是房間衞生間推拉門有損壞，難推拉，並一度無法打開，晚12點請維修人員來維修開門，才得以順利使用；老式浴缸不能套一次性浴缸袋，基本等於裝飾。
遺憾之處有二，一是鳳凰樹的裝飾燈撤了，酒店整體節慶氛圍不濃，二是下雨沒能吃上海邊的自助燒烤，這兩點是我當時選擇文華的‼️重要原因。
