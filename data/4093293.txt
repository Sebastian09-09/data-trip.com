Sadly the toilet wasnt very clean when we checked in. There was blood stain on the toilet bowl. And there was no aircon in the room. Had to call the staff to come and open the window as the room was warm and stuffy. But the window can only be open slightly.

The hotel has a unique location in the city center and a bustling business district. Unfortunately, this is the only advantage.
Disadvantages: The room is relatively old and the hygiene is not good. There are marks on the walls. The cabinet of the sink is hard to look at. If you look at the picture of the towels, they are black and stiff. . . Fortunately, I brought my own towel
There were many broken facilities. I wanted to use an iron, but two sockets on the floor were broken. The bedside reading light was also broken. I was speechless. Later I found out that the reading light was turned off on the opposite side. . . The control knob on the left turns off the right, which is a magic operation. When I encountered it for the first time, I asked the master to fix it. The master explained that it was designed in this way, and the Sheraton is also the same. . . I have stayed in most hotels under the basic InterContinental, Starwood, Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and other brands such as Sheraton, Hilton, etc. This is the first time I have seen this design.
In addition, the sound insulation of the hotel is not good. When the sun shines on the glass curtain wall, there is always a sound of expanding metal, which affects your rest. You can also hear the movement upstairs at night.
Then the worst thing is the attitude of the man at the front desk. The robot didn't deliver the takeout for 40 minutes. I called to ask, and the front desk said in a very rude tone, and he didn't write down the room number. How do we know which room it is... I couldn't bear it. After staying, I got the takeout and saw that the room number was clearly written on the takeout order. The manager on duty came over to explain, but was reluctant to apologize and did not tell us the outcome. It was very irresponsible. This is also the first time I have seen it. After I reported it to Ctrip, the platform handled it promptly and quickly. However, Ascott did not have a complaint channel, and no one contacted me to give me a satisfactory answer.
Overall, the experience is very poor, management is terrible, lightning protection.

shortcoming:

Because it is not easy to park at the door, they also helped to coordinate and solved the difficulty of taking a taxi on rainy days. Thank you🙏🏻

The staff are so friendly that I want to visit again, and I like the city of Wuxi itself. The washing machine had a dryer function, so I was able to use the swimming pool and gym and dry my clothes quickly, which was very comfortable. However, since the full-length windows are not vertical(?) automatic, it is a bit difficult to lower and raise them to see the view. Haha. This is a residence-type hotel with a very enjoyable staycation feel!

The high-speed rail station is seamlessly connected to the subway station and you can walk to the hotel in five minutes! Located in the city center, buses are easily accessible to several major scenic spots in Wuxi. The main entrance of the hotel faces a park, and you will see green everywhere when you step out! Find peace amidst the noise! I chose the deluxe three-bedroom apar**ent. The layout of the room is reasonable. All three bedrooms have sunlight. The living room is connected to the living room and the light is great. The kitchen and laundry room are fully equipped and the details are in place! Room service is on call which is reassuring! The breakfast is small but combines Chinese and Western styles. There is a freshly ground coffee machine and a variety of juices. The food tastes very good, and my friends all thought it was good! The first choice hotel in Wuxi! highly recommended!

msg:Coming April 30, 2023.

I came to Wuxi during the May Day holiday this year and wanted to live in the most central place in Wuxi, so I chose this place, and I was not disappointed. Unless you are particularly price sensitive, consider living here.

The location of this hotel-style apar**ent is undeniable. Next door is the Gongyuan Garden and Chong’an Temple. It is surrounded by the most upscale shopping malls in Wuxi. It is only one subway stop away from Nanchan Temple-Nanchang Street. No matter where you are It is very convenient to go shopping or go to major attractions in the city. Moreover, the hotel is located on the upper floors of Yunbat Building, so you can have a bird's-eye view of the center of Wuxi. The night view is quite good.

This hotel was only opened two years ago, and it is relatively new overall. Moreover, because it is a hotel-style apar**ent, the area of each room is relatively large, and the hardware is better than that of a star hotel with the same price. This time I lived in an executive one-room apar**ent on the 41st floor of Yunbat Building. The bed is a 2-meter-large bed. It is not too crowded to add a baby cot in the room. I feel very comfortable to live in.

Of course, this is a hotel-style apar**ent after all, and some functions are not as good as star-rated hotels, such as the buffet breakfast, which has fewer varieties, which is somewhat similar to the executive lounge of a star-rated hotel.

The ground floor of Yunbat Building is a shopping mall and an office building, so the hotel’s parking spaces are also shared with shopping mall customers and office white-collar workers. During holidays, the parking spaces will be tight, and the building’s property management will even block the parking lot at the entrance because there are no parking spaces. Exotic vehicles. But don't worry, tell the staff that you are a hotel guest, and you will usually be released.

As the city center and Saturday night, the price is OK. The two check-in experiences cannot help but be compared with each other. What remains unchanged is that the room layout, facilities, lighting, and external scenery are as good as ever. The sanitation may be more detailed. Some furniture has obvious floating dust. It is best to label the cabinets where the tableware is placed according to the 5S standard Easy to find, not to rummage through.
The obvious difference is the breakfast this time. It's really bad. There are few types and low quality. Frankly speaking, it's not as good as Orange Season. Special breakfast. Hope to improve and maintain the previous level.

What is surprising is that Ascott and Yunbat Building are not connected. Most hotels and shopping malls are connected. For example, the Ascott Huaihai Road Service Apar**ent on Huaihai Middle Road in Shanghai is connected to Hong Kong Plaza. , Of course, you need to swipe the hotel room card, but there is no one in Wuxi, and you have to enter through a fixed gate.
The service in the hotel is not bad, but the facilities are relatively average, the elevator is a bit slow, the air conditioner in the room is not strong enough, it can't be warm at all, let alone wearing short sleeves, it's too cold to wear a sweater.
Fortunately, the washing machine is good, and the drying function is also intact. It is just right to wash and dry the clothes that have been accumulated for several days. This is the biggest advantage of living in a service apar**ent.

msg:The reviews are extremely poor. It is the worst hotel in Wuxi.
Checking in at night, the hotel front desk was extremely unprofessional and didn't know all the questions I asked. Including membership issues, room general issues, breakfast issues, how to play with toys in the lobby, etc.
I wanted two room cards, but I was told that there was an electricity card in the room, but nothing happened.
The room has no transparent windows! ! The windows are all taped up and you can't see outside at all. So what's the point of booking a room on the 40+ floor?
I wanted to provide a few more bottles of (mineral) water in the room, but I was questioned first. Two bottles had already been given and no more could be given.
The bathroom door could not be opened in the middle of the night. Later, the maintenance man told me that this kind of incident often happens, so there is a device on the door lock to open it from the outside! Now that you know it, why do you still do this?
Breakfast cannot match the price at all.
After parking and checking out, I parked for 1 hour and was told that there was still a charge.
There’s really a lot to complain about. .
Don't live there. .

msg:Every time I come to Wuxi, I stay at this Ascott, because I find it super convenient and super comfortable.
It is only a ten-minute drive from Wuxi High-speed Railway Station. Downstairs is Chong'an Temple Commercial Street. It is a few minutes' walk to Henglong Plaza, Sanyang Plaza, Parkson Plaza, Great Eastern Depar**ent Store, Suning Plaza, Yaohan, and Nanchan Temple. Qingming Bridge, you only need to take a taxi at the starting price.
This time, I stayed in the executive suite on the 43rd floor, overlooking the entire commercial area. The kitchen and living room are very large, and the decoration is very comfortable. It is a hotel with high cost performance.

Because the floor is high enough, the scenery is really pleasant. But after the first night, my mother said that there was obvious oil stains on the kitchen floor of the room they lived in and had not been cleaned. I am also relieved that it is inevitable that the room is too big. But the other two slots are really beyond the bottom line. Although there are many hotels but few comments, I have to say today.
One is when I saw two dying cockroaches lying on their backs facing the sky on the countertop of the auntie cooking noodles at breakfast, they should have just been poisoned by *****. After being sick, I told the auntie noodle cook, who quickly cleaned up and continued to cook the noodles...
The second is after breakfast. My daughter likes to look at everything with her. She discovered that three of the four boxes of yogurt that the family had just drunk had expired for two days! I was shocked and forgot to take pictures. Later, I told the lobby manager that I wanted to check it out and give me a reply, but then there was no more...
That's it, it can't affect the mood of a rare family outing. But I still hope to pay more attention to health in the future.

The purpose of the choice is also because it is located in the city center, the hotel has high floors, and the city can be viewed from the height of the room. There are also two roof terraces on the 45th floor, but the doors are locked and you cannot get out. If the roof garden is opened, it will be more divided.

In particular, King Will's intelligence and kindness are worthy of praise. The state and hygiene of the rooms assigned are very satisfactory. I got my wish, and I can enjoy the night view of Wushi Night, which is very satisfying. There are big shopping malls and gourmet shops around the hotel, and the location of the hotel is also very good. The whole family had a delicious breakfast. I would like to recommend this hotel to my friends.

Old and tattered, cheap perfume in the elevator can be spit out directly
The orange rag that auntie cleaned fell directly on the bathroom
The room is not soundproof so that all the children next door can hear all the voices
The windows cannot be opened, the air conditioner is old and loud
As a regular user of Ascott
I think this is too embarrassing for Ascott

Other than that, there are no major problems, but it is a bit expensive because it is a central hotel. I think the breakfast is comparable to a 3 star hotel.

msg:This time I want to talk about it. Two rooms were booked and all upgraded to one deluxe room. But the deluxe room also has different sizes. This can't be compared! It is also an objective reason! But I lived in one room, because of a typhoon, the glass windows have been leaking for a long time, that is, when the wind makes a loud noise, the curtains are then lowered. Will be blown up by the wind. Another problem is that the switch of the shower room to switch the awning and shower is broken! I have to stay at this Ascott one or two times a year, and I will not consider other hotels every time I go to Wuxi! Lived many times. I have a good understanding of the hotel room types. But this time there are still more cases! There is also the hotel breakfast, which I said a long time ago! Breakfast is average. It is also possible that serviced apar**ents and star hotels have different requirements for breakfast!

Ascott Yunbat Apar**ent🏨, I heard that many celebrities will choose this hotel when they come to Wuxi
Seeing that the netizens said that they checked in some time ago and met Yuan Quan Xia Yu
In the cloud hotel in the city center, go to nearby attractions and major squares like Hang Lung Ah Parkson. T12 Great Eastern is just across from the elevator. Every room is designed with panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows. Sleeping at high altitude, it seems to be accompanied by clouds.
Every room has a washing machine, oven, induction cooker, pots, cutlery, and coffee machine.
And the location is in the city center and very close to the Nanchang Street Wuxi Railway Station~

The street lights on the street, the neon lights of adverti*****ts, and the lights glowing from the windows of every household complement each other, really It's exciting! When staying at the hotel this time, Xu Xiao at the front desk left a pretty good impression on me and my family. She always smiles at work and takes the trouble to provide all kinds of help to guests. It makes people feel more cordial! Just for this service, I will stay at this hotel next time.
Finally, let me talk about the regrets of staying at the hotel: the room type photos provided by Yasige Hotel on Ctrip and the actual check-in are always quite different, and the hardware facilities are in disrepair for a long time, and need to be maintained and updated in time!

房間：看圖看圖看圖，絕美夜景，而且是180度落地玻璃，多花點錢定貴點的房間，絕對物超所值。主要是樓層都很高，俯瞰無錫市中心真的是一個字，爽！
衞生：房間很乾凈，還有浴缸，特別長，一米九都可以躺下來那種。房間也沒有異味。冰箱是入櫃是的，比普通酒店都要大，可以放好幾層食物，畢竟是酒店式公寓，可以開灶的那種。
服務：服務也很棒，前台兩位小姐姐都特別客氣和專業，回覆問題也很及時。訂房退房等各種問題，也都很耐心地幫忙解決，大讚一下！
總體而言，這次的入住體驗特別好，很值得全方位五星好評！

🍃環境：衞生間就衹有一條大毛巾，還有一條大毛巾被掛在了衞生間的門把手上，分不清到底是地墊還是什麼。
一間一晚六百多的房間，除了在41層可以看到錫城的景色之外，環境衞生與服務都不配這個價格

雅詩閣主打是服務公寓，所以有點是房間大，配備了一些廚房洗衣設施，但這也是唯一優點，因為其他設施真的就沒有對面的五星凱悦來的管理完善了，花灑出水胡亂噴，很多角落臟就不談了，總之如果你不需要廚房設施，對洗衣機需求不高，我建議你多花一點點錢，去對面的凱悦，不僅房間落地玻璃（雅詩閣的這個玻璃正中間豎了一橫條從上到下，可能是為了做燈光），而且管理方面更勝一籌。
