The scenery is very good, the sky gym and swimming pool have excellent views, and the photos are also very good. The room is very comfortable, the bedding is very good, and the pillows and quilts are of good quality. The hotel breakfast is very friendly, from 8:00-12:00, giving you enough relaxation during the holiday. The cocktails in the bar are also good, suitable for a drink in the evening. Highly recommend this hotel

msg:The good part is first of all the hygiene, which is OK. The dead corners are relatively clean. The environment is more suitable for young people. It has a cyberpunk style and a free billiard hall. It is suitable for young tourists. It is definitely not suitable for business people or business trips because it is too avant-garde. The swimming pool cannot be used. The circulating essence is not turned on. It is understandable that the occupancy rate is low. The breakfast milk is not good. It is a single meal. It is recommended to choose oa**eal porridge. It is OK. However, I should complain. The hotel upgraded me to a sea view room, but I can hardly see the Erhai Lake. The curtains are difficult to open. I gave me the room card three times and couldn't open the door. That is, the room manager is very enthusiastic.

The hotel housekeeper can call the park sightseeing bus to take you to where you want to go, saving time and effort. All the hotel staff are dedicated to providing various conveniences to the guests.

The hotel also gave us a package ticket to the Three Pagodas Scenic Area and afternoon tea at the hotel. Thank you very much!

msg:The room is very industrial style.
You can see Erhai Lake!
However, due to the design style, the windows are small windows like those in European castles. It is difficult to take pictures of people and the scenery outside together!

There is no external charging station in the entire Ideal Country! If you need to charge the electric car, please pay attention to lightning protection. The charging parking spaces in the Jinsuo Island parking lot next to it are also full of oil cars.

The hotel service attitude is very good, and the young guys are enthusiastic.
There are afternoon tea and breakfast, fruit cut plates, and the quality is good.

In the room we stayed, the bathroom door faced the door of the room and was transparent. The bathroom and the bathroom were back to back, separated by a wall in the middle. There is no sink at the door of the bathroom, and you need to go around to wash your hands. It's a genius design! ⁽⁽ƪ(•̩̩̩̩＿•̩̩̩̩)ʃ⁾⁾ᵒᵐᵍᵎᵎ

The good seats in Ideal Country are charged, and the price is not cheap! Ideal Garden closes very early, so go early!

The hotel is less than 20 minutes from the airport. The hotel provides free airport pick-up, which is convenient!

The hotel has a strong sense of design. It is very suitable for young people and taking pictures. The outdoor swimming pool, gym and cinema are all very fashionable.

The front desk and waiters are also very enthusiastic. They helped to upgrade the room type.

The hotel's catering is pretty good in the scenic area. It can also be improved according to the wishes of the guests. Breakfast is recommended + toast options. The cost is not expensive. After all, pasta is a bit greasy in the morning.

Those who like design will feel very comfortable here, as every corner is designed. All utensils in the room, including toothbrushes, slippers, bathrobes, water cups, and all surfaces outside the room, including corridors, elevators, roofs, etc., have a sense of coordination.
The location of the hotel is also very good. There are hotels scattered around in the close view, Jinsuo Island in Erhai Lake in the middle shot, snow on Cangshan Mountain in the distant view, and the sunset is beautiful.
Except that the breakfast was not delicious and there were not many dishes for dinner, there was almost nothing wrong with it.
Because this resort area is full of commercial hotels, you can take a ferry to Jinsuo Island opposite and eat fishermen's food.

Ps: The key is that both the little brother and the little sister are good-looking
Breakfast: Very rich, a combination of Chinese and Western, nutritionally balanced.
Coffee: The craftsmanship is good.
Room: Fully equipped, there are two types of pillows, you can choose the one that suits you. It is said that the quilt cost 2000+, and some customers even bought it.
The slippers are thick and a bit hot. But there is a sense of security.
There are frozen drinks, cookies, etc. to prevent the problem of being hungry in the middle of the night without eating.
Shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are fragrant.
The toiletry bag is relatively complete, as well as special liquid for underwear. The only thing missing is a nail polisher.
The hair dryer is easy to use, my lion head can blow hair smoothly, and the effect is similar to that of Dyson.
There is a washing machine + dryer, which solves the biggest problem of washing clothes while traveling.
The robes are very comfortable.
Intelligent control of the whole house, just call Xiaodu.
The scenery outside the window is very good, you can see the white Santonili and the golden sunset of Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake.
I sent it as a travel photo, but I didn’t want to take photos of ethnic styles, as I don’t know much about the local culture. Just take a photo with your motorcycle.

The short trip allowed me to experience the feeling of being a child again. The beds are also very good. I don’t know why the hotel beds are more comfortable than sleeping at home. Everything I can see is carefully customized by the hotel manager. I don’t have time to take the high-speed train. Take photos casually. There are beautiful scenes everywhere. Leave enough time next time and come again. See you next time at HIHAT Pioneer Art Hotel.

msg:A very satisfying business trip🏖
I was not familiar with this place due to my busy work. When I stepped into the hotel, I felt the warm and friendly welcome of the hotel staff. The layout design of the room is also full of unique artistic style. The room is smart. After that, Xiaodu became my exclusive waiter. Due to the fatigue of traveling, I quickly fell asleep in the 1.8-meter big bed. At 11:15 the next morning, I was able to eat my lazy breakfast (breakfast). Time: 08:30~12:30) It seems that this boss has taken into account the worries of young people and office workers nowadays😃😃😃

After the meal, I went to experience all the things that can be done and take pictures in various areas of the hotel. I played with game consoles, table tennis, gym, etc. for a whole afternoon.
It’s a casual shot and it’s not a blockbuster. It’s really good. Give me a chance to take a break from my busy schedule😈😈😈See you next time!

You can smell the perfume as you approach the building. The coffee bar on the first floor, the restaurant bar on the ground floor and the third floor are all unique. There are lounge chairs on the small terrace, which is great for sunbathing. The staff are all young people and their service is warm and considerate. The complimentary private car drop-off service is very good.

msg:Very good, very good, really good! In the time of saying goodbye to 2023, I stepped into the wind, flowers, snow and moon of Dali in December. The wind was strong and the flowers were plentiful. The hotel I came across by chance was the icing on the cake. The hotel's unique set design and enthusiastic and meticulous staff service made me spend my time in the Pioneer. The passing 24-hour special forces vacation instantly relaxes the spinning top of a job. The afternoon sunshine under the terrace, the sunset reflection in the restaurant, and the mellow American cuisine in the Vinyl Cafe all give this New Year’s Eve a more gorgeous a**osphere. The sense of experience, walking into a house, is like a whole world. The accumulated culture and unique charm give people who enter the ideal state a precious walking footprint, which will definitely be seen in the future, Pioneer!

msg:A very interesting hotel, very artistic and full of character. The geographical location is unique. The hotel is built on the mountain and has a unique style, which is in line with the temperament of an "ideal state". Each room seems to have a unique layout and design (I peeked at two rooms being cleaned). The room I stayed in has a separate game console, which is really cool. The overall hardware of the room is excellent, the mattress is relatively comfortable, and it is very smart. The toilet light is sensor-controlled at night, which is very user-friendly. The cleaning is relatively clean, the coffee is delicious, and the service is warm and thoughtful. Except that you need to take a taxi everywhere (this is the same if you live by Erhai Lake) and the road near Ideal State is relatively congested, everything else is good.

You can have breakfast before 12 o'clock, which is especially friendly for those who like to sleep in. There are plenty of drinks in the small refrigerator and the waiters are very friendly. It's a great place to stay for a few days. The hotel also has a gym, billiards table, swimming pool and arcade, making it the hotel with the most extensive facilities in Ideal.

On the day of check-in, there happened to be a music scene in the hotel, and I participated in it. It was very shocking both visually and aurally. I never expected that there are hotels in China and in Dali that are willing to share these good activities with their guests. Highly recommended, will come again next time

現在的評價多數都是為了吐槽酒店，能讓我認真寫個好評的酒店確實很少。
酒店的地理位置很不錯，停車也挺方便，這在寸土寸金的洱海，不容易，也有接駁車到停車場拉行李接人，房間的佈置也有一種耳目一新的感覺。
但這都不是最吸引人的，最吸引人的是酒店的每位工作人員，把服務客人當成了自己的習慣和本能，竭盡全力，有求必應，細心體貼都不足以概括，我想要麼是老闆錢給的足夠多，要麼就是足夠的愛這份工作，説一千道一萬，下次再到大理，還會繼續入住。

再説説房間 ，房間的裝修是那種復古朋克的感覺，所有的細節都做的非常好非常有質感，因為我是處女座看重細節 ，在這裏確實感受到了老闆的用心 ，枱麪的洗漱包 、浴缸的浴鹽 、浴室的洗浴產品 、房間的迷你吧包括房內燈具的開關都是心意滿滿 ，如果下次再來大理 ，一定衹會選擇這一家 ，也很開心在這裏度過了我的大理遊。
