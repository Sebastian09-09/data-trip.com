msg:It’s indeed an urban resort hotel but it’s only on design. Hospitality from the staffs should be further improved. The issue is the reception just offered me to upgrade the rooms with some costs while I’m the first time customer which unable to know if the hotel match with the expectation of worthiness. This small action of upsell makes me a little bit disappointing. At around 5pm, the staff came in to clean up and make the room neat but I just checked in at 4pm. The staff ring the bell 3 times in 5 seconds and tried to enter the room while I was sleeping. I was quite shock and made a constructive feedback to the reception. No follow up from there onwards and no one provides any explanation later.

The hotel has a superb strategic location. It’s walkable to the Jing’an Temple and subway station, adjacent to good commercial area of Jing’an Kerry Center which has many international F&B brands like Shake Shack, Blue Bottle, Piebird. The commercial area also has some modern Chinese bistro like GUI Bistro, Cucurucu which offered great hot cooked food (not sweet dish like local Shanghainese taste). 
The room is spacious, good view of the city, comfortable mattress and have good sound proof.

msg:The service provided by hotel staff is excellent. Also  at an excellent location and travel by mass transit railway is available just next door.  Breakfast is abundant with great variety. Very clean room. There are plenty of shopping malls around and we particularly like the French restaurant La Creperie nearby. The only one drawback is that the lobby entrance and drop off area is a bit small and cars have to queue up to get in all the time.

msg:Second stay after very pleasant one two weeks ago, but slightly disappointed with a few things broken down in the room including the blue tooth speaker resulting in changing to another room which was a little hassle. Although nothing is perfect, but in a very competitive hospitality industry, the consistency of customers’ satisfaction maintains guests’ loyalty. Comparing with other hotels, Puli still stands out as a service oriented hotel. The amenities do look a bit tired and need to be taken care of or upgraded soon.

The location is in the heart of Jingan and next to one of the best malls in the world - The Kerry Center. The sand shark upholstery in the library and the Long Bar are not to be missed. The bartender at the Long Bar is a master and you should definitely try a few of their signature dishes. Excellent service and excellent food!

Dare I say, it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in, certainly servicewise and this is coming from us who travelled a lot and mainly stay in high end hotels. The hotel is old but it has aged really well due to the materials used for the buildings. It has calming /spa-like atmosphere. Unfortunately we didn't get to try the spa this time. Last but not least, the hotel is in a good location, walkable to the main attractions in shanghai i.e. The Bund, Nanjing Road and Yu Garden. In summary, I will highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to shanghai.

Our room was comfortable but the hotel is surrounded by high traffic elevated road, the "white noise" of the cars could be hear at the lower floors, luckily we were at the 23rd floor.
The window of our room looked on the opposite side of Jing'An park and the view was nothing special, only with the dark it improved a bit.
Gym is equipped with new training equipment but not enough for deadlifts (no barbell), not equipped for bench press neither for weight row.
Price of beverages at "long bar" absolutely expensive (108 RMB for 1 Corona...), 150 RMB + for any other cocktail.
Breakfast at buffet is nothing special: the second day I have ordered a full egg omelette and I got a white egg one, tasteless and pretty raw. 
Food selection at buffet for breakfast not satisfactory at all for me, poor selection of jams, yogurt, bread, cakes, no oat/soy milk available.

However, at my second stay, the room I checked into had a musky smell from the AC. It had to run for over night before the air was neutralized. A bit disappointed as the smell affected my sleep. Overall, I found the location unbeatable and the design timeless and still very pleasant

The room service did a very bad job, first they delivered us dry bread at the dinner, the bread was sooo dry that we even could not break off a piece (without any exaggeration),  second greetings was written with status of Mr instead of Ms, third I’ve been for champagne deliver to the room within an hour after that room service delivered me just a bottle itself, with no any ice bucket and glasses. That’s not the service of the fine hotel…

Ahhh, the Chinese style of the Puli Hotel in Shanghai is super beautiful🏮

Walking into a quiet environment, it feels like being in an ancient palace

🌸Puli's service awareness is very good. As soon as you get off the car to the hotel, they will help you with your luggage. Especially Cecilia and Hank's service is great. Recalling this unique experience, the soul is warm and healed

🀄️The room is exquisitely decorated, and the Chinese furniture exudes a faint fragrance of agarwood

🎋The beautiful garden outside the window, the small bridge and the flowing water are like a poem and a painting

🍵Taste Chinese breakfast, clear away heat and relieve summer heat, and satisfy your taste buds

💆♀️Relax spa massage, and your body and mind are perfectly healed

Basic factors:

1. The location is very good, creating a quiet a**osphere in the bustling city. The Jing'an Temple business district is just a few dozen meters away, and the hotel is very quiet.

2. The service is very good. The mini bar is free, and the service staff simply cleaned the room and made the night bed when I left.

3. If you like this kind of Zen-style design, then you will find this hotel particularly beautiful.

4. The swimming pool is not open to the public, so the people are very beautiful. A very beautiful swimming pool.

As for the shortcomings, I don't think there are any shortcomings. The hotel is not large in size, but what's the use of being big? Unique style is the rarest.

Facilities: The buttons in the elevator and the bed in the room are very low, but it is quite comfortable to watch movies in bed. I feel that this height is very friendly to children or people with limited mobility. Some people may not like it, but I think it is quite fun.

There is a mirror in the bathroom of the room, and there is also a mirror opposite the bathtub, which is also quite fun.

The location of the hotel is also very good, and it is convenient to go out and play. The closer Wukang Road, Julu Road, and Changle Road can be reached in more than ten minutes on foot. You can also order a lot of delicious takeaways in the middle of the night, which is really much better than Pudong and the Bund!

I have stayed in many hotels, big and small, from Six Sense to Marriott IHG. The first time I wrote a review for a hotel was because I felt sincerity. Generally speaking, the environment is simple but not simple, low-key luxury. When I made a blind reservation, I was worried that the hotel would not be new enough, but I didn't expect that the overall quality was pretty good. The service was proactive and in place. We were traveling as a couple during our honeymoon period. They thoughtfully upgraded us to a luxury suite and responded to any needs we had. We had our own charger in the room but the Apple data head was broken, so we immediately replaced it with a new one. The most important thing is that I received a handwritten letter of blessing, which is very sincere. The only thing that needs improvement is that the dirt on the mirror surface at the bottom of the sink faucet has not been cleaned. It may be easily overlooked when not cleaning the surface. I hope you will pay attention to it next time. Overall very satisfied, recommended.

The hotel is set in a bamboo forest, and the design includes many Chinese elements. It feels like an urban oasis in a paradise, just like an exquisite work of art.
I especially praise the ladies at the front desk for being professional and enthusiastic, but not overly intrusive. Before checking in, Sienna called me to communicate my check-in requirements and follow up on my arrival time. When checking in, Cecilia gave me a very beautiful and large room, and didn't let me wait too long. During the waiting process, they also helped me book a restaurant. Thank you very much.
Finally, although it has been open for some time, the facilities have no signs of aging, and the maintenance is in place. The hotel's maxbar has a lot of drinks, which can be replenished and are all free, which is not available in many luxury hotels.
I like it very much💕

I was very lucky to choose the same hotel as the Red Bull team, and I was immersed in the joy of the encounter. I forgot to take pictures of the room. This is the first time I chose Puli, and the hotel gives people an overall feeling of elegance. The design of a whole piece of log in the lobby gives people a feeling of comfort and no affectation. The hotel service staff is also kind and friendly, and takes the initiative to help with luggage and guide check-in. Especially in the past few days, many fans have been waiting for the drivers to return at the door, and the staff has no bad attitude and is very tolerant. As for the room, it has a strong sense of design and is very comfortable. The mattress is moderately hard and soft, and the bedding is soft and comfortable. The disadvantage is that the design of the washbasin will make water splash everywhere, and I hope to make some improvements. In addition, there is a situation where the air conditioner blows the bed, which will affect sleep. Apart from this, the overall experience this time is very satisfactory.

msg:The hotels under the Leading Hotels of the World are positioned as oases in the city, and the Puli Hotel is no exception. It is located next to the prosperous Jing'an Temple in Shanghai, and is convenient for shopping nearby.
The long wooden table in the lobby takes into account the functions of the front desk and the lobby bar, which is very distinctive. The room is in a new Chinese style, and the hardware materials continue the high-end of the Leading Hotels of the World, and the blinds and blackout curtains are also unique. Although the hotel has been open for a long time, the room is inevitably worn, but the maintenance level is still online.
In terms of service, the front desk and concierge are enthusiastic and professional. Although there were some minor episodes during the stay, the front desk and concierge were able to solve the problem quickly, and the follow-up visit was also timely.
Looking forward to a more perfect experience next time.

I like every well-trained partner at Puli.
The smoothness and comfort of check-in.
This is irreplaceable in my heart.
The warm welcome you can feel when you get off the car.
When the aunt makes the night bed, she will always tidy up the room.
I ordered a sanitary napkin express delivery, and their concierge depar**ent will also put two brown sugars in it...

The response is timely, polite and thoughtful, but also maintains a distance.
And the experience is the same every time you stay.
This is really hard to experience in other places.

Serve:
Cecilia at the front desk was very attentive and enthusiastic. When checking in, considering that it was my first time to this hotel, she gave me a room on a high floor with a good view, and also thoughtfully helped me with a late check-out! Thank you very much for coming to Ctrip and leaving a positive review!
Location:
It’s so convenient to go to Jing’an Temple! Moreover, it is very convenient to see the night view of Jing'an Temple, which fully meets my needs.
The Kerry Center is downstairs. After dinner in the afternoon, you can also go to Changshu Road and Wukang Road for a city walk. I am very satisfied!
Room:
The scenery is unique, you can see Jing'an Temple from the room
The decoration style is special, and the environment and facilities are all in the new Chinese style. This is something I have never encountered in other hotels. I took a lot of photos and sent them to friends!

The hotel address is great. Jing’an Temple and Hang Lung City are nearby. The only pity is that there is no smart toilet. The French cuisine is very good. The breakfast service It was great to let me take pictures without stopping me. I was told to try not to take pictures of others. This sense of boundaries is great!

It was not very polite in the bar area at night and I didn’t even take pictures. I looked at you with a professional camera and told you that you are not allowed to influence others. I compromised when I found out that I was helping to promote the hotel😮💨As a designer with numerous international awards, I feel that this is a bit of a pity in China. There are two attitudes toward domestic and foreign people.

First of all, the service is really good. From getting off the car at the hotel entrance to helping with luggage, to the lady in charge of check-in, she is very sincere and enthusiastic. She pulls out the seats, brings hot towels, welcome fruits and souvenirs for departure, and greets you with a smile. , respond to all requests. I would like to praise Miss Mia and Zoe by name. The service experience is very good and they deserve a lot of praise! 👍 Tied with Changsha St. Regis at the top of my experience list hahahaha.
The environment and location are also very good. The hotel is in a quaint new Chinese style, and the scene changes as you move around. For an older hotel, the details are a little bit worse, but it doesn't matter. It is better in taste and scenery.
Being in a busy city, you can find tranquility in the chaos, which is in line with the positioning of an urban paradise. The scenery in the guest rooms is also very good, and Jing'an Temple can be seen at a glance.
All in all, it’s worth a visit and the price-performance ratio is super high

Overall, what surprised and angered me the most at this price was the service attitude and quality of the front desk and breakfast reception, which made me have to give the experience a low score.
Let’s talk about the check-in at the front desk first. There were many people on the day of check-in, so it might be busy. When the front desk checked me in, it was as if I was catching a train. I just handed over the room card and that was it. There was no breakfast room location, precautions, or minibar information.
Then there is the breakfast room. You are not allowed to wear hotel slippers in the restaurant. No one informed you in advance. When you arrived, you were stopped. You did not apologize and served yourself. It was a very rigid hotel rule. Please go back and change your slippers. The arrogance of the front desk service in the restaurant was suffocating. There was no expression of apology for causing inconvenience to the guest, just an expression of "I won't let you in".
Although the service after entering the restaurant was okay, the discomfort these two services brought to me was unacceptable. I will not recommend you to a hotel with this quality service next time!

The lobby concierge is always the benchmark for service.

...It’s just that the concierge manager in the lobby treats guests enthusiastically, but his attitude towards employees brings down the a**osphere!

If a good culture is not about letting your peers feel the sincere enthusiasm and service spirit!

Simply scolding employees to increase motivation is not good.

Regardless of whether the manager is neglecting the guests, it is extremely wrong to scold the employees! This severely affects the service core.

We hope that every grassroots employee will be treated with the same respect and love as our guests.

The only shortcoming is that the breakfast is not very good at this level. There are few varieties and the quality is not very good. The fruits are not very sweet, the juice is not freshly squeezed, and even the coffee is made by a fully automatic machine. And the machine probably needs cleaning, the beans are also very poor, and the coffee tastes like bitter carbon.

The Puli is suitable for tourism, the St. Regis is suitable for visas, and the Shangri-La is suitable for business. As far as services are concerned, they are almost the same. The front desk staff at Puli is pretty good, quite enthusiastic and considerate, but the check-in staff at the front desk are the worst among all nearby hotels. The service attitude and standards of robots make me feel like I am very high-ranking. Yes, I really think too highly of myself...

Call the front desk and respond proactively to requests raised.

All hotel staff are polite and gentle
And there are not many hotels in an area like Jing'an that offer free parking. The underground garage is spacious and easy to park.

msg:🏨I knew it when I was in school in 2013. I was attracted by it at that time, but due to the price... After that, I went back and forth to Shanghai countless times every year. I also stayed in countless good hotels including Peninsula/Waldorf Astoria/Andaz etc. due to work reasons, but this one just... Like a "cinnabar mole in my heart", it keeps lingering.
🏨10 years later, at the end of 2023, I took advantage of this time to work and finally decided to pull the plug (but I didn’t expect to fall into it completely in the end)
🏨I booked a basic room without breakfast (the main point is to save money, and reviews generally indicate that breakfast is not good), but because the basic room looks like... I wrote down the reason why I came to stay with the idea of ​​​​trying it out, but I was surprised to be informed of the upgrade when I checked in. Go to the signature [Classic Room].
🏨The hotel was built in 2009. It not only popularized the concept of "urban vacation" in China, but also became a "model" for countless imitations of the same type. But it is said that "it has always been imitated and never surpassed". When you stroll around the hotel and hit the horse stakes at the door, you will see the same "gold brick" as the Hall of Supreme Harmony under your feet. The 33-meter-long tree trunk is used as the hospitality/entertainment space. Old objects, the silk in the sliding door... some seem to have lasted a hundred years, while others have a new generation style. The ancient charm and contemporary design blend seamlessly, forming a unique and uncompromising sense of luxury and comfort.
🏨 The guest room has a Chinese-style entrance, and the interior decoration follows the same style (indeed, when you come in, you will find that this space layout is imitated by many hotels of the same type that you have stayed in before), with exquisite lacquerware and antique porcelain embellished throughout. The polished teak floor is very comfortable to step on with bare feet. The metal parts are a bit old and there are some bumps on the cabinets, but it doesn't matter. I think the guest room has just the right balance between signs of use and careful maintenance.
🏨A room with a view, exquisite welcome fruits, a free mini bar, and most importantly, a comfortable bed (the first time I slept in a hotel with a firm bed that I loved)...all of this is reminiscent of Somerset Maugham's The description of a good hotel: there is a bathroom with a bathtub that you can lie down in, and a deck chair on the balcony that you can lazily lean on. This is civilization.
🏨The staff are all warm, polite and considerate, responsive to requests and at the same time very discerning and efficient. It is very, very difficult to still maintain the original intention after 14 years of operation.
🏨As far as a one-night experience is concerned, I can’t comment at the moment (of course, because I didn’t try the food and didn’t use the fitness and swimming facilities). I’m really satisfied, and I finally understand the reason why many qualified people only choose to live here when they come to Shanghai.

The service is overall very good, warm and polite, and the room service response is timely and measured. The hotel is not very soundproof, but fortunately there are fewer people on the floor we live on, so we can have a good night's sleep. The only dissatisfaction is that although the breakfast tastes good, most hot food needs to be ordered, and the waiting time for food is too long. The kitchen was too slow to deliver food, and we waited for almost thirty minutes. It is recommended that hot food be served more buffet-style in the future, or that simple items be served first to ensure that guests can eat hot food quickly first.

I am really satisfied with the quiet location in the middle of the hustle and bustle.
Surrounded by bustling shopping malls
Puli is a pure place where you can enjoy a comfortable and relaxing moment.
It’s full of Zen and at the same time has a sense of cool and high-end. The lobby is very beautiful at night.
The hotel service is excellent. Everyone is very kind and enthusiastic. Mia Jiang and Hank’s service warmed me up.
What I like the most is the cityscape Puli sees through the blinds after the lanterns first come on, with the neon lights flashing.
In addition, the light in the room is soft, which makes taking photos very beautiful.

In addition, the hotel's address really has to be praised. It is very convenient for shopping, citywalk, and drinking. It is also very close to Shanghai Station and is very convenient.

Everyone was in a hurry. I don’t know whether it was because there were not enough people or because the service quality had dropped a lot. When I entered the room, I felt "Puli" Really old.” The door of the cabinet could not be closed, and the circuit hidden door beside the window was misplaced. When I opened it, I saw there were cigarette butts inside... After checking out, I took my luggage to the door to wait for the car. The security guard was busy following me. The vehicle battle completely ignored us and did not help with our luggage...

Although the attitude of the hotel is very good, the price is sorry for the hygiene problem! The facilities in the room are just average! They also put us next to the elevator. At first, they told me that there was only one double room on each floor. However, when they complained about hygiene issues, the front desk told me that there were 2 rooms! Can you guys be more unified?

msg:Choosing a deluxe suite at The Puli was probably the worst decision I ever made when traveling for business. First of all, when we checked in, the front desk did not take the initiative to share some of the services included in the suite. They were provided one by one upon our request. Secondly, the luxurious suite booked includes suite benefits and additional alcoholic beverages, but the housekeeping depar**ent forgot to put them there. It was only made up after we reported to the front desk many times. Third, the hotel wants to comply with environmental protection requirements and requires guests to call the front desk to deliver toiletries. This is understandable, so we did as required. During this period, we also asked for an ice bucket, and the housekeeping staff sent it when it was delivered. Complain, you have been here several times, and if you have to complain about some basic requirements of guests, it shows that the hotel's management system and service awareness are extremely lacking. In the end, our breakfast was delivered to the room by room service. The quantity was so small that I have never encountered it in my hotel experience. The price of breakfast was seriously inflated, and after I expressed my friend’s daily protein supplement need, If you need more boiled eggs, you will definitely refuse. Unless there is a charge, you will also need to replace the egg roll with two boiled eggs. All experiences are extremely unpleasant. I will never choose Puli again.

The toilet smelled bad, no matter how much I flushed it, it was probably a problem with the drain design. The water from the shower head was very gentle, the water pressure was weak, and the drain water also had a smell. The scent of the shampoo and shower gel is that of camellia, which is very comfortable. The air conditioner blows out very quietly. The hair dryer was terrible 👎 We didn't use it properly for a few days. Let’s complain about breakfast 🍳 It’s not so delicious! The pineapple is actually raw, white and hard without a trace of sweetness. The noodles, whether they are beef noodles or pickled mustard pork noodles, are not as sincere as those in street shops, and the breakfast is not of the quality of old Shanghai! Speaking of service, I felt arrogant. First, the waiter at the front desk who helped us carry our luggage was scolded by another staff member for some unknown reason. In front of us, it was very uncomfortable and obviously disrespectful. 2. When checking out, a female staff member asked me how I felt about my stay in the past few days. I kindly wanted to give you a suggestion, but she turned around and started chatting with other people after half a sentence. She was speechless. Who are you talking to? Are you talking? You take the initiative to ask me, I answer seriously, but you don't listen🙉, what do you want to express? It is indeed arrogance! Therefore, there is something wrong with the quality of Puli!

The facilities are still obviously aging, the sound insulation is not very good, and the noise from the corridor and Yan'an Road elevated road is relatively loud.
The service needs to be improved. Check-in was 930, and the occupancy rate was estimated to be at most 60%. I was told that there were no extra quilts. Bad review.

Talking about the shortcomings, the only shortcoming is that there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom. If you take a long shower, it will be a bit stuffy.

There is a sound of jumping upstairs until two o'clock in the morning one night, and the sound in the corridor is even louder. At 8 o'clock in the morning, the upstairs started to run around again, and I called the front desk. Not only was there no solution, but the entire reply even made a big fuss. In the past, it was just for convenience. I will never stay at The Puli again. It's too bad now.

There is no problem with the room. There are "antiques" everywhere in the hotel and the room, and the wardrobe doors are antique, a bit like Aman Fayun!

It is made in Chinese style without losing the sense of fashion. It is very grand and beautiful. The facilities are also very new. Amanyangyun has a similar style.
The middle house is also beautiful, the location is convenient, and it has a sense of fashion, but it lacks a bit of elegance. So I really love Puli in every aspect!
There’s really no need to mention the location of Puli. It’s next to Jing’an Temple and is where my friends and I spend most of our time. The view from the room is very good. There is a large green space below, and you can also see the golden Jing'an Temple, which can attract wealth.
All in all, I had a great time staying here this weekend, and Puli will be our meeting point from now on! Thank you Kay, Mia, Jasmine~

By the way, every floor has a window with a stunning view of Puxi, which perfectly embodies the Shanghai style. I was attracted by this and chose Puli. As for the shortcomings, there are some. It is true that the cabinets in the room have some traces of time, but this is well concealed in the overall a**osphere and will not be clearly felt by you. It even feels that it smells older.

Hygiene: Nothing special to mention.

Service: It meets the standards that a hotel at this price range should have. Puli's service starts from the moment your car parks at the gate, until you get in the car and leave. Every staff member in the lobby left a deep impression on me. They are enthusiastic, professional, and provide more and better proactive services than you expect. When I checked in, I mentioned that I wanted to drink at the long bar in the evening, and they immediately helped us. We called to make a reservation. When we left, we waited for the car in the lobby for a while. We were also given macarons and sprays.

and more Don't miss the long bar, the a**osphere is great and unique. Don’t miss the breakfast delivery service either. You will be given a menu when you turn down every night. If you choose, it will be delivered to you by hanging it at the door before two in the morning. I personally think it is very worthwhile.

The hotel room facilities and equipment and front desk staff service are very poor. When checking in, the front desk staff did not interact with guests with any greeting. As soon as we entered the guest room, there was a strong odor in the guest bathroom. I notified the hotel to deal with it. The guest room staff came over to see the problem and left after spraying air freshener. No apology and no follow up.
The room is rather thin and worn. The shower room was very slippery. After taking a shower at night, the shower room floor was still wet the next morning and I almost slipped.
The only luxury service in the hotel is that the bellboy in the lobby is very enthusiastic and polite. The bellboy takes the initiative to greet guests and help guests with their luggage. When meeting guest room colleagues in the corridor, they also take the initiative to greet guests. This is the only commendable part of the trip.
Do not recommend staying at this hotel! Don’t choose this hotel next time!

The front desk has an indifferent attitude and does not have the service attitude that a five-star hotel should have. When checking out, I asked if there were any souvenirs, but was told that customers who booked through the Ctrip platform were not eligible to receive them and had to go through the hotel's own platform. Doesn’t it mean that when you book a room through a third-party platform, the money goes to your hotel? The so-called souvenir is just a small envelope. Treating customers so differently makes me wonder how your hotel trains its employees.

Service: The service is good, and the efforts of the service staff can be seen

Mini bar: a bit crude. What I can’t bear is that the capsule coffee machine has no milk balls. Ask the front desk for it. The front desk says there is milk in the minibar... This is the first five-star hotel I have ever stayed in without milk balls...

This time I lived in Regent, Edison and Puli in Shanghai. Puli is the most disappointing for me.

During this trip to Shanghai, I chose the Puli Hotel, which was personally designed by Indonesian designer jaya 🏨
Located in the busy Jing'an business district, it enjoys the reputation of "Urban Taoyuan". It is adjacent to Kerry, Ruiou and Jiuguang, so it is super convenient for shopping and travel🛍️
The low-key and introverted Chinese style does not lose the luxurious texture. The front desk helps to upgrade the room for free. The night view of the city outside the window is very magical 🌃
In the morning, I had a sumptuous brunch at the phenix French restaurant, which has won one Michelin star for seven consecutive years, and waved goodbye to Shanghai👋

Service: Very poor. I have stayed at this hotel often before and my experience was okay. As a result, this time my family went on a trip and came back just in time for New Year's Eve, so I wanted to stay here. At the front desk on the day of check-in, I wanted a room on a high floor, but the front desk told me that there were no rooms available. After a while, a check-in person came next door. I heard that the same room type was given on the 18th floor. I just said that we have 2 rooms. We may stay here for 2 nights and then spend the New Year’s Eve here. Is there a high floor? In the end, he still told me no. While they were talking, another couple came next door. It also wanted a high floor. The front desk didn't even say anything when I was here, so they arranged a room directly. I took a quick glance and saw that it was the 22nd floor. When I saw it I got angry. I said that I am a Black Diamond member. If you bully people like this, then I will definitely give you a bad review. As a result, the front desk said, OK, then I will give you a room at the end of the 16th floor, but you can't live in it. **, what are you doing? Do you think this is another hotel without stars? then what. I will never stay here again, absolutely not.

You have to call customer service several times to get the service you deserve. It’s like begging for food. It doesn’t feel at home like the last time a five-star hotel should have. The level of awareness of the waiters is quite different. Big, I don't think it's worth visiting this hotel next time.

msg:When the epidemic was serious, all the hotel staff did not wear masks. It amazed me. If the last guest you contacted or cleaned the room was infected with the new coronavirus, it would not be innocent because your hotel staff infected the next guest. I have to go home every day to see my family. They are already old and have chosen 5-star hotels just want to reduce risks, but this is the first time I have seen a hotel completely ignore the health and safety of its guests. In other hotels of the same level, employees have a higher awareness of protection, and there are many people going up and down the elevator every day, which has poor privacy and is easy to spread the disease. Virus, the safe in the room was broken and it took us until six o'clock to get someone to replace it. The employees left the room and left cigarette butts. No wonder there are so few business guests in a hotel that cares about the health and safety of its guests.

msg:I have stayed in Puli several times, and the impression of Puxuan in Beijing is very good. There are even more surprises this time.
1. Arrived at the hotel at 11 am. In fact, it was not check-in time yet, so I wanted to ask if I could check in earlier. A lady with short hair at the front desk was very patient and friendly. I saw that it was the honeymoon anniversary. After the remarks, he took the initiative to find a room for me to stay in. Then it was to help me upgrade a small suite, thank you so much.
2. Turn down service at night, everything makes you feel at home.
3. Complimentary small cakes, red wine and handwritten letters! It’s so thoughtful. Our honeymoon has been arranged by Shangri-La, Anantara, Jumeirah and other large resort hotels. As our transit point, Puli is simply too pleasantly surprised and too warm. Puli wins

msg:The sanitation and environmental facilities are impeccable ~ clean and tidy, very quaint, and I feel very at ease living here. The service of the hotel is a bit unsatisfactory. Not active enough, our big bags and small bags did not help us carry things, we arrived in the middle of the night, and did not remind that there was no toothbrush in the room, I was so sleepy that I had to wait for them to deliver the toothbrush after three o'clock. Although I think part of the reason is that I arrived too late, but since it is a hotel, it should provide 24-hour service in theory. Fortunately, everything else is good, the location is good, Kerry and Ruiou are just outside the door, the bathroom is spacious, and the minibar is free. Come early next time and try again~

The hotel has been around for a while, but it is very clean and comfortable. The lighting is dim and warm, which not only satisfies lighting but also has a quiet a**osphere. The only inconvenience is that each light has to be turned on individually, and it is easy to turn on the wrong one.
For breakfast, there are not many varieties and no Shanghai characteristics, but it tastes good and the portion is sufficient.
The service is very warm, not excessive, very satisfied

msg:Environment: The environment of the lobby and restaurant is wonderful, the layout style is calm and generous, with Chinese details running through, the flowers are used properly, and the lilies and water lilies at the entrance are very good. The room environment is relatively simple and exquisite.
Service: Before I came here, I didn't expect that the service turned out to be Puli's biggest shortcoming, and I encountered a very unprofessional situation throughout the process. (1) When checking in, the attitude of the male staff at the front desk was very average, and they lacked basic information. When a step got stuck, I didn't inform the situation. I waited there in vain. Later, the female employee next to me helped explain. (2) When I go swimming in the swimming pool at night, the manager asks the cleaning lady in the female guest area to introduce the facilities. After a brief introduction, the auntie repeatedly urges and informs that the equipment is about to be turned off. (3) I took three bags with me when I checked out, but the two welcome boys at the front desk who were responsible for helping the guests with their luggage didn't say anything. After observing it, it seems that the staff will only help push the customers who are dragging their suitcases. Isn't this superficial.
Facilities: The hotel has been open for a long time, and the facilities are slightly outdated. The speakers and other details are pretty good.

msg:Metropolitan Taoyuan, Jingan Puli. Every time I drive through Jing'an Temple on the Yan'an Road elevated road, I will see the PULI sign. It turns out that there is such a hotel next to the Transocean Plaza. The location is really good. It is very convenient to eat, live, travel and play around Jing'an Temple, and you don't need to drive. The hotel gave me a very good impression. The winding paths lead to secluded places, and the lobby and tea drinking area are together, so it doesn't seem noisy. The basic room booked for the room is enough for two big ones and one small one. As soon as you enter the door, there is a pot of Phalaenopsis, which instantly feels upscale. The layout of the room is also reasonable, and I tried to separate a larger independent space as much as possible. In terms of shortcomings, it is a common problem in many hotels that the temperature of the air conditioner cannot be adjusted in winter. In addition, the blinds cannot be raised, and only the direction of the low beam can be adjusted. I don't know why. The surprise is that the mini bar is free, and there are white rabbit toffee and spicy peanuts for snacks. Haha, watching a drama at night is a pleasure. The overall service awareness is also in place, basically responding to requests. After parking from the ba*****t, I met a staff member who happened to be walking with me and guided me all the way to the lobby, which is a bonus. The swimming pool is very positive, there are hot water pools and sauna rooms, and the facilities are complete, but the water temperature is slightly cold. There is no drying machine in the locker room, and the front desk helped to take it to the concierge to dry it.

I wrote down their name Sarah And Rosch, and Puli's concierge has always been so enthusiastic and professional. The day before I checked in, I also went to the spa in Puli. Kitty at the front desk of the spa was warm and friendly. I like her very much. During the stay, Kitty received her when I went to the fitness center and swimming pool. In fact, this time the hotel specially helped me upgrade to a high-floor suite. First of all, I am very grateful to the front desk for the careful arrangement, but I just like the classic rooms of Puli. Later, I troubled the front desk to help me change back to the classic rooms at night. It’s really embarrassing to follow us up and down, thank you!

The room size and decoration always bring unparalleled cleanliness and comfort. The design abandons the unobstructed city view from wide-sized landscape windows and uses blinds to divide it, and then uses mirrors to freeze and extend the scenery, introducing the dynamic scene into the interior and becoming a dynamic frame in the quiet guest room. What has the same effect is the floor-to-ceiling windows at the end of the guest room floor, which integrate the city view overlooking the foreshore into the extremely quiet wooden public space, which is commendable. Thank you Mia Jiang for your considerate care during your stay. The facilities are well-equipped, good facilities, good environment, good service, clean and refreshing~
Chris, the beverage director of the French restaurant on the second floor, is very professional. Thank you very much for taking care of him during the meal~

3. Facilities and equipment, because it is no longer a new hotel, the socket at the head of the bed cannot be plugged into the charging head of the mobile phone, and finally a tissue box was used to barely keep it from falling off.
4. The sound insulation is really bad, and I was woken up twice at 1:30 and 3:30 in the middle of the night. At 1:30, I don't know where the noise came from (it may be some kind of equipment, because it is accompanied by vibration), and at 3:30 it is the voice of the residents talking in the corridor.
5. The most unacceptable thing is that the hand towels are actually stained. I don't know if they are dirty and haven't been changed, or if they are changed, they are dirty.

msg:Recommended by a friend, I have always wanted to stay in Puli. It is indeed one of my favorite hotels among the top hotels in Shanghai. First of all, there will be dedicated service delivery from the door to the room. I really like this. Secondly, the service attitude of the ladies at the front desk They are all very good. I said I wanted to live on a high floor and they arranged for me directly. Needless to say about the room, the simple and pure feeling of the hotel and the overall decoration of the room is the a**osphere I like very much, as well as the golden bricks in the lobby, I love it very much. I didn’t go to the swimming pool this time, and I must go again next time.

Environment: Just near Jing'an Temple! Going out is the Kerry Center!
Facilities: The details of the products provided are in place, and the wardrobe partitions have a large capacity, which is very suitable for long-term stays! There was a problem with the hair dryer and it was replaced in time! The swimming pool also has many heart-warming detailed services. The security personnel in the swimming pool are both professional and distant from guests! I hate to say an irrelevant little problem, the position of the card reader in the elevator is a bit low! Ah ha ha ha 😁

The most important thing is that the hair dryer is broken, I asked for a new one to be sent. The service staff went directly into the room to deal with it. In addition, when the water was delivered, I swiped the room card myself and came in. I was still in the room! Bad, bad, bad! There is really nothing else to do except for the good location of the hotel.

msg:Pleasant hotel! I have been in and out of Jing'an Temple subway station so many times before, and I feel the quiet a**osphere here, but I didn't notice that this is a hotel. The feeling of being hidden deep in the city center with a unique charm, the style and Zen after entering, is the combination of oriental temperament and modern fashion sense.

The rooms are beautifully designed! It is the kind of beauty that does not have a trace of excess, refreshes the eyes, and makes the heart beat after entering the door!

Furniture, lighting, layout are all very good. Outside the shutters is the traffic flow of Jing'an Temple. After closing the shutters, you can soak in the bathtub and enjoy your own tranquility. When staying in a good hotel, I want to treat myself better. I take a bath and apply a mask every night, and the shower room is also extremely comfortable.

The restaurant on the second floor is Michelin. I think the breakfast is average, semi-buffet + a la carte, because I ordered the more common scrambled eggs and crepes. The order is simple, and the dinner may be good.

msg:Very speechless, knowing that it is summer vacation, I can understand that there are too many people and sometimes the service is not enough, but look at the positioning and pricing of your home, well, I was really annoyed when I stayed this time
1. After checking in, I found that the room was not cleaned, the trash can next to the sink and the trash can in the bathroom were not cleaned
2. [Unacceptable] The toilet seat was not cleaned at all, it was really disgusting, and the wall was not clean, and then someone was called to clean it again, and the speed was really fast
3. I went to have breakfast. I didn’t finish the meal and I didn’t leave yet. I just went to get another piece of fruit and put away the plate for me when I came back. I was really speechless. Then I made a new one, but it was really very Unhappy (especially when I went downstairs to wear a bathrobe on the first day, I also wear it like this in other places except the executive lounge, but I told me not to wear it like this, and asked me to go back upstairs to change)
4. After checking out, lead me to the front desk where people check in. Brother, I will give you a room card and check out directly. You make the check-in and check-out unhappy. Have you ever received training?

It's a pity that there are too few options for the set meal. It is recommended to go to the hotel for a semi-buffet meal. The environment of the hotel is nice and low-key, with a bit of antique flavor. It is very close to Ruiou and Kerry

msg:The advantages and disadvantages of choosing to stay at the Puli Hotel on the second day of the ***** New Year are as follows. Advantages: 1. The hotel is located in the Yueyang International Plaza of Jing'an Temple. Free parking is available in the underground garage, which is suitable for guests with large bags and small bags. 2. The transportation is convenient. Subways No. 2, No. 7, No. 14 converge here, and the surrounding businesses are densely packed, making travel very convenient. 3. Puli Bear will be given to the children when they check in, and a small Guerlain gift will be given when they check out. The minibar in the room is rich in drinks.
Disadvantages: 1. I booked a double bed room and wanted to add a quilt when I checked in so that the baby could sleep in the sleeping bag between the two, but when I checked in after 7 o'clock in the evening, I said there was no more, and the family of three did not sleep well at night. Although the release of the epidemic has increased the number of guests staying in the hotel, as a hotel that opened before the epidemic, I think it is not appropriate for the lack of quilts to occur when the second day of the ***** New Year is not considered the peak of occupancy. I have stayed in the hotel for so many years first encounter. 2. The windows of the room are all equipped with blinds that cannot be raised. It feels quite depressing to watch the originally good Shanghai street view through the blinds. I don't know what the hotel is thinking about.

msg:Disadvantages: The sign of the hotel parking lot is not obvious, and you can't see it unless you look carefully. Similarly, the sign in the lobby is also very small and difficult to read.
There is no welcome fruit, and the takeaway ordered cannot be delivered upstairs in the cold wind, and you need to come down and get it yourself.
Advantages: The fragrance in the lobby smells very good, and the staff will come to ask for check-in when they see it.
The room on the 16th floor is very quiet. My favorite is the bathtub. The bath salt smells very good.
The location is very good, just opposite the Jing'an Kerry Center, very convenient for shopping, free parking for staying at the hotel.

msg:I really don't know where the good reviews come from. I don't understand.
Objectively evaluate:
1. It was almost 11 o'clock when I checked in. I saw many comments saying that I was upgraded by the front desk, so I tentatively asked if it was possible to upgrade. The front desk said no, so I didn't continue to talk about the upgrade. Yes, but after we entered the room, we didn’t like the room very much, so we upgraded it at the front desk at our own expense, and then a manager came to show us the room and told us on the way that our room had been upgraded once, but the front desk clearly refused the upgrade, and we didn’t know. who should listen to
2. The overall environment of the room. You can look at the picture for details. It doesn’t look like a five-star hotel at all. When I first entered the room, I found the floor was dirty and wiped it with a towel. Picture 5. It’s pitch black. The hygienic condition is very unsatisfactory.
3. The welcome fruit is very sticky. I don’t know if it has been washed or not, but it is very sticky and I didn’t eat it.
4. The most unacceptable point is that we called to check out when it was almost 12 o'clock. We asked if we could delay the check-in yesterday. We slept late and there were many things that were not cleaned up. The front desk refused to appreciate a room at 2 o'clock. Check out at 1 o'clock. This is a five-star hotel for drinking. To be honest, I have stayed in a lot of hotels. I haven't stayed in a hotel that checks out at 12 o'clock for a long time. Many comments say that the hotel automatically delays check-out. Check out was also denied because we are new customers? But how can there be countless times without the first time?
If you have money and nowhere to spend it, just stay. The experience is extremely poor, very poor, the service is bad, the environment is bad, and the good reviews really don’t know where they come from……………

msg:Score 5 out of 10
1. The breakfast venue is too small, which leads to many problems. You have to queue up and wait for meals. There is only one stall. Ordering extra food increases the workload of service staff and the guest experience is not good.
There are 229 guest rooms, which can accommodate less than 70 people for dining at the same time. The distance between tables is too close, and the conversation next to them is clear and there is no privacy.
2. Poor hygiene, dust on the dining table in the guest room, dust on the corners of the sliding door, hair on the breakfast sofa area, etc.
3. There are problems with internal management and the service cannot keep up. For example, the welcome fruit needs to be reminded three times before it is delivered. You can feel impatient when answering the phone.
4. The most satisfying thing during my stay was that the guy who served drinks at the bar was very nice. I commend him.

msg:The Puli Hotel is really a treasure
The location is very convenient. It is next to Jing'an Kerry Center. There is everything you can eat, drink, and go shopping. There is also Jing'an Park next to it where you can do nucleic acid.

Environment: The environment of the hotel is very artistic. It feels like a paradise in the city. It is quiet in the middle of the noise and the decoration is also very impressive.
Hygiene: There is nothing to say about this, the five-star standard is impeccable
Service: The service is very good. There is even a small gift when you check out. It is very thoughtful. All in all, this hotel is definitely the first choice to recommend to friends in Shanghai. Don’t stay in traditional hotels anymore. There is no creativity. The Puli is really worth it

msg:Let’s talk about how disappointed you are with Puli
⚠️: The room is too dark, and the blinds cannot be raised. The one with the view is a waste of money. It is obvious that there is a view, but it cannot be seen clearly. The hotel calls this design, but I call it brainwashing😂

Facilities: Old. It’s true that the wooden floor in the bathroom in my room made a rattling noise when I walked on it, and then meowed like a cat in a horror movie (be careful, timid sisters). What was outrageous was that the TV cabinet fell off by itself (as shown in the picture), and there was also a Palm print 🥲

Hygiene: The floor is really dark, so I don’t know if it’s clean😅

Environment: The lobby of the hotel is beautiful, right?

Service: This is quite outrageous. The guy who delivered fruit within 10 minutes of check-in rang the doorbell. I was in the toilet, but he rang twice and came in while I was putting on my pants. I could only close the toilet door silently. If I was taking a shower Or maybe it’s diarrhea 💩 Then it really depends on which one of us is the most embarrassed 🫢

In the end, the front desk learned that everything was done in a good manner. Before leaving, I wanted to send a sample of Valmont as a supplement. I felt that I was not short of samples either.

The service is only available during the day and at midnight. There is no service in the middle of the night. My aunt came and had a stomachache and screamed for sanitary napkins. I called room service and asked for help. When I got a reply, I said that no one at the concierge went down to get it myself, and the sink was too small to hold the girls' cosmetics and skin care products. I was speechless, but the front desk service was very good and the environment was nice. Other than that, I really don't recommend staying here!

1. The spare parts that have been unchanged for ten thousand years have finally been replaced! The new Yuebi Shi white tea tastes very clean and comfortable~
2. The breakfast is finally semi-self-service + ordering, which can not only meet the needs of different groups of people, but also minimize the discomfort caused by the concentrated waiting before;
3. When checking out, I also gave a small gift with great care, customized chopsticks~ full of sincerity.

~Finally, thanks to Peggie, you were the one who received me when I checked in. I called "Sister Qinqin" directly, I hope you are not unhappy 🤣🤣🤣

msg:First of all, the hotel environment and location are good, and the new Chinese-style decoration is also very low-key and a**ospheric. However, the service level really greatly reduced the check-in experience. First of all, no one helped to carry the luggage during check-in, and the service staff chatted at the front desk of check-in. Secondly, the hotel elevator does not distinguish between freight elevators and passenger elevators. When I was advanced in the elevator, three waiters directly pulled a carload of mineral water into the elevator without asking, and squeezed us into the corner. It was like taking a freight elevator. Feel. During the stay, the cleaning aunt has the best service attitude, and she is very enthusiastic and greets you every time you meet.

msg:Anyway, I was in the middle of playing with my mobile phone on the bed when I turned over and suddenly a bug crawled next to me. I felt that it must have been born in the mattress because it should be difficult to climb up from the ground along the bed legs. It is impossible to have such a thing as a bug. Everyone understands it. Other basic facilities such as the seat pillows have unknown stains, the TV cannot cast the screen (the review was written in 2023), the bathroom sink is too small to hold toiletries, and the floor will scream after you walk over it. The attitude of the front desk is only I give it a score of fifty-nine. I think it’s tolerable compared to the crawler incident. The hotel also made compensation, free of charge for one night's upgrade and a set of Guerlain samples, eh, but I suggest Puli pay attention to basic cleaning. After all, I don't know when it will happen like bugs crawling on the bed. It crawled. Did it crawl into the box I opened on the ground to give birth*? I can’t say what physical or physiological impact it had on me at the moment. Maybe some people think it’s not a big deal, but I’m very afraid of reptiles. , so this incident is more of a mental blow and psychological trauma for me. I have no way to ask the hotel to make any effective compensation. I can only tell the matter truthfully as an ordinary consumer to remind others. Consumers, secondly, are also a kind of public supervision of hotel services.

By the way: On the night of the incident, I suddenly couldn’t connect to the hotel wifi, and the speed was very slow... It shouldn’t be a problem, right? If this is not intentional, then the hotel should still pay attention to your network service. This is Shanghai and it is not a place that cannot be extended by optical cables.

The entrance of the hotel is slightly hidden, but it is just a quiet place in the middle of the noise, avoiding crowded places; the lobby and room decoration is very Zen, and coupled with the extremely high temperature these days, entering the lobby from the outside is quiet. .
The room layout is very reasonable, the facilities are complete, and the bed firmness is suitable.
The main thing I want to thank is Amy from the service center and the person in charge of the room on the 25th floor that day (a big brother) for helping us deal with all kinds of complicated problems. In the end, I feel a little embarrassed hahaha. On the day we checked out, we had to leave early, and we also consulted a lot about the use of laundry and vouchers. Amy and the room eldest brother both helped to coordinate and even delivered breakfast to the room at 5:50. I would also like to thank the chef for his special care. I got up early to work overtime; in addition, I received a small cake on my birthday, which was very touching.
When I come to Shanghai in the future, I will choose Puli Di.

When you get off the car, there will be service staff to help you with luggage. It's a set menu that can be delivered to the room or dine in the restaurant.

It's that some older guests prefer Chinese style The Puli Hotel is really a rare luxury hotel for all ages. When I checked out, Kathy and Stephanie helped me with the bills and explained the bills I had doubts. Kay And Sarah also asked about my stay experience and a warm welcome to come back next time

msg:Although I had an unpleasant stay experience before, I was still convinced by the hotel's sincere communication and warm invitation to check in again recently, but I was still disappointed.
1. There are small unidentified silicone objects on the bed. Personally, I speculate that it may be the plug of the electronic cigarette. If it is, it means that the non-smoking + cleaning has not been done properly. If not, it is also a big mistake in cleaning;
2. The electric blinds seem to have their own ideas, and they will move and make sounds from time to time;
3. The shower gel by the bathtub has been opened;
4. When the welcome fruit was delivered, it was not paired with red wine as usual, but was delivered later;
5. There is no service staff who guide the seat at breakfast;
6. The Wi-Fi network speed in the room is extremely slow, and the quality of WeChat calls is extremely poor. Kay who called me on WeChat should also feel this;
7. The Wi-Fi password says that it is my surname or my husband's surname, but my husband's surname cannot be logged in. Personally, I speculate that the front desk recorded wrong pinyin characters.
There are also advantages, that is, the apology is timely (because I have the personal contact information of Kay, the lady at the front desk), the afternoon tea snacks are delicious, and the compensation promised before is delivered.
But if I think about it, I will not go there again. Knowing that the hotel has a chance of not changing the bedding is different from personal experience and really finding that the hotel does not change the bedding. This impact is quite big.

The tonality of the entire hotel is also mainly elegant and restrained, but the service is very enthusiastic. It feels like an old five-star hotel.

When you get on or off the bus, you will open the door and walk up to ask if you have any luggage. They will also help put luggage and express delivery into the room in advance. What made me most speechless in the video was the socket. It popped out several times and I had to be very careful to charge it. People from the engineering depar**ent came over to see it early in the morning, and they were very arrogant and had a very antagonistic attitude. Only things with triangular holes can be inserted into the triangular holes. This statement is really speechless. I have never heard of it in other hotels. I travel 10 days a month for business, and none of the hotels I stay in say this! It makes me sick just thinking about it. Oh, by the way, if you plug a hair dryer into this hole, you will see sparks and electricity. They are blue. I was scared to death.

msg:It is located next to Jing'an Park and is positioned as a city resort hotel. The car passes through the rows of bamboo trees on both sides before reaching the entrance of the hotel, giving people a feeling of starting a vacation. The new Chinese style of the lobby is very pleasing and attractive. The bar counters in a row to the end of the lobby are divided into different functional areas. The hotel reception, bar, afternoon tea, Chinese chairs and sofas are designed in a unified and elegant style.
The room space is good, there is a sofa resting place and a small table, the bathtub with a view is the highlight, the only point is that you can hear the noise outside when you sleep in the evening. I booked a view room facing Jing'an Park to see Jing'an Temple. It should be a selling point, but the soundproofing is not good. At night, I hear the sound of traffic on the road. Intermittent but non-stop is really a problem for me who wants to sleep quietly.
The breakfast buffet in the middle of the night was delicious, and I ordered Chinese and Western staples. It's free to look at the green scenery of the park outside.
Health facilities are the strengths of the hotel. The indoor swimming pool with its own landscape and the jacuzzi in the changing room, dry and wet steam and ice mist shower can really kill an afternoon. My own spa is also famous in Shanghai, you can make an appoin**ent to enjoy it when you have time.
The service is really good, the front desk, housekeeping and even the switchboard are very good, and the attitude is kind.
If there is no noise at night, it should be possible to score a five-star score. Recommended.

Except for the two washbasins that are neither reasonable nor practical, there is almost nothing to choose from. fault. Finally, the location of the hotel is heaven for those who like to shop.

msg:This is a rare hotel in the city center that can be called a "resort hotel". After staying in so many luxury hotels, I came to a conclusion that one of the criteria for judging business hotels and resort hotels is to see whether their minibars are provided to the guests for free. Is this the truth?
In particular, I would like to mention his family's Mi Yi French restaurant, Fenis, who enjoyed the set menu at the evening market. The taste is still okay, but not lost. The breakfast of hotel guests is also used in Fenis. The semi-self-service experience is still very good. Even the self-service part is done with great care. There are various Hong Kong-style steamed points and freshly squeezed juices. The friends who have dinner can be worth the fare.

The service and facilities of Puli have maintained the standard of overall satisfaction. However, I went to the swimming pool last night and today at noon, and I met two Korean families. The Korean man brought a group of dead children to play in the swimming pool and the noise really affected the surrounding guests. It is recommended that the hotel can screen the guests, especially for this kind of family guests with children. After all, Puli is positioned as a resort and spa, which is a quiet recuperation. The route, don’t turn it into a Sanya resort, it’s all occupied by children

msg:This time I came to try the Puli Hotel. From the location of the hotel, the scenery of Jing'an Temple outside the window, the design style, the right service, the comfort, and the perfect breakfast, I was satisfied.

🚗 Transportation: It’s too convenient to travel. Jing’an Temple Metro Station is just around the corner. The shopping area around the taxi is small; I like to stroll to the restaurants and imported food supermarkets along Jiaozhou Road. Joël Robuchon French bakery is also a few minutes away from the hotel and into the shopping mall. Distance (by the way, "butterfly cakes" don't need to be lined up like the Bund store).

🧹Hygienic: Every day when I go out and come back, the room has been reorganized, so diligent; except for the bathroom, you can see obvious traces of long-term use, other areas are good.

🍃Environment: Jing'an Temple is so beautiful at night, I think of the scenes that swept past the opening of the "Shanghai Women's Guide". The hotel’s interior design is full of details, low-key and unassuming, cool in nature, and high in comfort in different areas.

🔔Service: just right enthusiasm, very professional. Miss sister upgraded the room type when checking in, so happy. The room has welcome chocolates and free Mini Bar.

Breakfast: When choosing a hotel, I was also optimistic about the Western breakfast semi-buffet, with fresh and rich ingredients; Benedict made it to order and tasted good. If you like the exquisite Western breakfast, don’t miss it.

I will talk about service. Knowing that I was staying for the first time, @Kathy and @Frankie enthusiastically took the initiative to arrange for me on a high floor, with a first-rate view, and asked the gentle @Rachel to lead me to the room to introduce the perfect details that I could not guess. For me, the bed was too comfortable for me who had a bad sleep, and I slept for 10 hours all at once. Come live next time. I almost forgot to say that the fitness pool is beautiful, the sauna is also beautiful, and the place for breakfast is even more beautiful.

Not disappointed. The hardware and software are online. The design style pales in comparison to the high-rise buildings surrounding Jing'an Temple. There is a feeling of being hidden in the city. The service staff are warm and hospitable. LISA at the front desk helped me upgrade the room for free after seeing me staying for the first time. The overall price of Shanghai hotels is on the high side. The price of less than 2000 grades is one of the best. Recommend.

All food and drink in the room are free, as well as chocolate delivery. When checking in at the front desk, the service attitude is very good, and there are people who accompany the children to play and give them toys and candies.
Since other room guests quarreled us in the early hours of that night, after saying that the attitude at the front desk was very good, we immediately delayed the check-out for us. Let us continue to have a good rest. Although the soundproofing is really not very good, it was influenced by the service attitude.
Finally, the surrounding environment ~ Ruiou Depar**ent Store is downstairs, and Jiuguang Depar**ent Store is just across the street. It is very convenient. It seems that it is not far to walk to the place where you can take the airport bus. The overall feeling is very good, and I won the service. Will choose next time.

As a cultured hotel, you can no longer call him an internet celebrity. You can feel the transition between prosperity and seclusion when you walk into the passage to the hotel from the side of the street.

🧹Sanitation: impeccable sanitation

🍃Environment: The hotel belongs to the Chinese style. The collision of simple materials and fashionable design makes people sigh the prosperity of the magic city in the hustle and bustle, and enjoy the elegance of the hotel. There is a kind of deep courtyard.

I booked the hotel's premium suite in advance, and found that the front desk arranged a big surprise for us after arriving at the hotel! The room was upgraded and honeymoon champagne was arranged. The room has good soundproofing and large space, so it is very comfortable to take a bubble bath in the bathtub next to the window. The bedding is comfortable and the quilt is soft and skin-friendly. The bed in the room is very big, but maybe my husband is too tall, it feels a little bit shorter, and it's pretty good in all other aspects. The breakfast pancakes are really delicious, the semi-buffet variety is rich and highly recommended!

msg:I have stayed in many hotels of the same level in Shanghai, but the Puli is the first time I have tried it. Catching up with the fireworks typhoon, the hotel mansion, but I felt it well.

The staff of Puli are probably online with IQ and EQ. for example:
1. When checking in, the young lady at the front desk carefully asked about the estimated check-out time in order to arrange invoices and other matters. It was returned to the highest floor of the 25th floor.
2. The aunt who cleans every day is very nice. They are also the hardest!
3. The wiring brother of the guest room order, gave the best suggestions for the dishes. That cheese and strawberry dessert is a must-see!
4. After breakfast on the second floor, the younger brother will bow and bid farewell.
When I checked out on the 26th, I gave my little brother a handwritten check-in feeling at the front desk that day. The little brother actually gave a small gift-a pair of chopsticks! Very pleasantly surprised and unexpected!

Of course, in addition to people, also comment on the hotel itself.
1. The rooms and facilities are indeed a bit old and damaged. There is also a lot of dust accumulated in some places. I hope the hotel will take it seriously!
2. The hotel's equipment and mini bar are generous. The chocolates delivered at check-in are delicious.
3. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the quality of the a la carte part is still online.
4. The spa is good. But I think there is still a gap between the level and MO.
5. The location of the hotel is great! But because Puli's buildings are relatively independent, if it is the opposite of Shangri-La, it might be more convenient to go shopping and eat on typhoon days.

It is very convenient for eating and shopping around. The service facilities are good and the price is high. I will consider booking here in the future.

msg:I stayed at Puli for the second time. First of all, there was no welcome fruit when I arrived at the hotel. When I came back, I put an apple, a total of peaches and a black brin. The quality of the fruit was also poor. Secondly, on the day of check-in, it was said that the room might be renewed, and as a result, there was no phone call. Selling the room directly to the next person was equal to being kicked out. (When I checked in, I said that I could renew the room online. The result was that I renewed my room at more than nine o'clock in the morning. All the reservations were made online.) It was like being kicked out of the hotel in disguise. Third, I said the license plate number before leaving the hotel, but I took my luggage and left the garage. I had to pay 240 yuan. Calls to the hotel are also unanswered. As a result, I parked again, went to the front desk upstairs, and re-entered the license plate before coming out. It was delayed for a long time.

There are really no other advantages and it is not recommended to stay. The room is relatively old, the bed is relatively low, the mattress is uncomfortable, and the sound insulation effect is poor. The door was opened by the resident on the same floor in the middle of the night for 2 consecutive nights. Recommend to live next door Shangri-La

msg:Let me explode Puli in a long story~
Location and transportation: Just near Jing'an Temple, come from Hongqiao Airport, and arrive at 7 stations of Metro Line 2, and it is 100 meters away from the subway entrance. The nearby major commercial districts, Ruiou Depar**ent Store, Jiuguang Depar**ent Store and Kerry Center are all 100 meters away. The major Internet celebrity roads are in the radiation range of 1 km. Food and shopping are all available.

Hotel landscape:
Although the hotel is quite old, it feels very new. Walking through the bamboo forest, it is like walking into a paradise, and the quietness is incompatible with the traffic outside. The check-in counter is also a lounge bar, which is an illusion of Kyoto.
service:
There is a turn-down service every day, and fruits are prepared for us every day, and the cleaning aunt is very careful. When I arrived in the morning, I gave priority to the room that was already ready, and asked about the time to leave on the last day, and did a late checkout in advance.
Gym and swimming pool:
The gym equipment is very tall and relatively complete. And the magic mirror that is very popular recently. It is the dumbbell area. It is recommended to put a rubber pad on it. After all, it is easy to cause damage to the wooden floor. The swimming pool is even more popular, and it is also equipped with a sauna room, but unfortunately it didn't swim until the last day.
Cost performance:
The overall value for money is very good, I will stay here next time I come, instead of choosing the Bund area.

But the little sister at the front desk who received us was very cute. Most waiters are not friendly enough and will not take the initiative to say hello. There is still obvious dust in the room, and the toilet is really not strong enough. But overall it is highly recommended, especially the swimming pool.

I have never had an experience. As soon as I walked in, there were a lot of people in the lobby. I have never seen any hotel lobby that can be so noisy. Entering the room I probably came to which three-star hotel. The weird design, the sanitary cleaning is extremely dirty, and there is hair on the shower, I don't know what the operation is. Breakfast service The breakfast was not tasty. The selected time was either early or late. I really don't like the breakfast not being ordered. The first day's breakfast was 15 minutes earlier, which disrupted my plan. . . I thought Beijing Puxuan was already the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I didn’t expect that Puli would never come again.

msg:This hotel is the most speechless of all the hotels I have stayed in. The average price is 2,000 per night. The hotel has no service and is full of flaws. I was convinced when I first checked in on the 12th floor. The TV was not easy to use and the blinds were not easy to use. I just lay down and didn’t know what the next door was doing. I kept knocking for half an hour. I couldn’t bear it anymore. I called and didn’t apologize. I asked if it was convenient for me to pack my luggage and change rooms. After the service was over, I thought it was interesting and nothing happened. I looked at Ctrip’s reviews and it made me laugh. All the complaints are real. The service staff in the hotel are not there to serve. The hotel management who is here to stand guard can be said to be deaf to the opinions of the guests. Even the simplest bath towel is too old and thin and has not been corrected. I will not stay here. The hotel is gone. I hope the management can do something about it.

酒店大堂和早餐廳佈置非常雅緻，舒適，有格調，工作人員也比較友好。

房間很大，但是我個人覺得雙床尺寸略小，因為帶12歲孩子其實還是略擠的。另外窗户是百葉窗加窗簾，百葉窗沒有辦法完全升起這點我非常想吐槽特別希望能升起來白天能看到外面的景色，特別是百葉窗旁邊有可以休息喝茶喝咖啡的桌子……

但是特別想誇22層housekeeping的阿姨，中間遇到過好幾次都是滿面笑容 即使能明顯感覺她特非常忙碌，也能讓你感覺到服務的真誠，給這個酒店增加很多好感。我們退房的時候又遇到她，她拿着吸塵器一堆東西和我們迎面相遇她也會急忙幫我們按好下行的電梯，太温暖了。

環境和服務都很棒、酒店裡也很安靜，令人沉浸的香氛一進酒店就覺得整個人平靜下來了。還有特別美麗的泳池，雖然泳池比較短窄 但是滿足休閑遊～
迷你吧:吃吃喝喝足夠了、咖啡 和補充的小零食都很豐富。
唯一不太滿意的就是床品吧、感覺和快捷酒店的床品沒大差…這個品質是有點奇怪！

msg:下了飛機去酒店的路上，車窗外高樓大廈林立，密密麻麻，在某一個我回神的瞬間忽然一齊向我湧來，極強的視覺沖擊達到頂峯。暈眩、想吐、頭皮發麻，生理的反應裹挾着心理動因，在現代城市的鋼筋混凝土凝成冰冰冷冷的鐵具，靠近的那一霎那，冰冷得突如其來，又後知後覺。然而居住在這裏的人終究是麻木了，像是曾經千百次對高樓密集熟視無睹的我。直到這次從倫敦回來才因着那種極強的反差感，被這城市展現出的人口密集度悚然驚到，如此直觀，又是何等壓抑。
        心底較從前淡然頗多的變化太過分明，叫我難以忽視。以前喜歡黃埔，喜歡快節奏的陸家嘴，金融中心，寸土寸金，連隔着江吹來的風都要嚴絲合縫，精緻無比。喜歡外灘建築歷史融淬出的包容，沉痾上點着的是紙醉金迷。現在反倒偏愛靜安，愛靜安寺的古樸舊意，看它在細碎的陽光下閃耀着，發出沉靜的金色。愛廣場、巷口、街井，男女老少談笑間蒸騰的人間煙火氣。
        車水馬龍、熙攘喧鬧被一一駛過，車子從兩排葱蘢的翠竹間駛進，那挺拔延至酒店門口，平白取代了宏偉的門頭，華麗的裝飾。不同於傳統奢華酒店墨守成規般的浮誇，它極其隱匿、卻又不由分説地叫你感受到那天然的大氣與底藴。
        桃源不虛自有，祕境其然天成。
        層層疊得的木質縷空隔斷，光影折射、垂落，樸實幽然的氣息未入，內心已然平靜了。穿過三道玄關，大堂縱深，曲徑通幽，豁然開朗。老傢俱、線裝書、古董，碩大的空間以某種意線相連，在這樣的相得益彰中顯出沉甸的魄力來，可是卻並不使人生離。吧枱是木質的，燈光在這樣的温潤下並不太敢張揚，收收斂斂地打在牆上，叫人聽見千百年前紫禁城金磚的低吟，如出一轍，從容自得。
        在大堂等朋友的間隙，偶然發現室外有一處花園，那是一種與室內截然的勃勃生氣，一排高聳入天的水杉阻擋住外界一切喧囂，形成了天然的結界。使之在都會鬧市區，憑酒店之軀而有大隱隱於市之感。以此種視角往外看滬上景觀，雲捲雲舒，花開花敗，似乎一切都變得雲淡風輕了起來。
        璞麗自稱“都會桃源”，視覺上的享受當不過神通一二，不得其本。本當在心境。黑、灰、棕主調，大氣沉穩，漢家氣韻，悠然盡顯。內飾搭配青銅、石刻古物，簡單而更顯隱世之姿。在璞麗，你始終可以感受到那種拿捏得恰到好處的氛圍。璞，玉未琢也。正如其名，璞玉一塊，低調卻典雅。
        在璞麗居住的這些天裏，偶有“日出而林霏開”之景，有時卻是日星隱曜，烏雲密佈，陰雨綿綿。在百葉簾遮掩大片的落地窗下，那份禪意與靜謐卻並不隨天氣更迭。偶一抬頭，水光綠意瀲灧相映，光暈點點。執書品茶，養性修身，在此番環境之下，倒並不顯得幾分突兀與刻意。 
        出於對酒店設計理念的好奇翻閲一些資料，發現了些更有意思的：酒店外豎立的是七根獅頭是拴馬樁，按照天罡七星位佈置，其真正用意是與古今落客場景相契合；上海灰磚鋪設各處，讓原本就安逸的下榻空間多了幾分江南靈秀俊雅之美；圍屏鏤空的紋樣是中國先秦的圭山紋，古老文明與現代工藝在一方圍屏相融，並不爭鋒而各得其美；房間內龍鱗紋木雕屏風、銅鑄洗臉枱，一隅一角，一式一件，巧思和天然融洽自得。
        今年開始，我格外熱衷於中式文化。服飾、建築、書籍，探索逐漸消失的東方傳統美學中的含蓄、詩意、恬靜。而在倫敦待着又不可避免地感受到西方文化的氣息，兩種截然的美在我踏入璞麗的某個瞬間，或是每個瞬間得以交融，變化平衡，陰陽相合，文化碰撞，中西合璧。
        在物質化與商業化瀰漫的今天，身體的放鬆已然不易，心靈的棲息更是難尋。偶得此幸，一時欣然，故而洋洋灑灑，衹達一二，也算值得。
          2023.12.12記於上海璞麗

msg:這是第一次住璞麗，之前在phenix吃飯感覺璞麗的服務很好，就想着有機會還是要來體驗住店，雖然一直擔心老舊問題。這次入住全程工作人員都很nice，服務體驗很好，不過真的因為是開業蠻久的原因吧，確實設施有點老舊，特別是窗簾漏光。硬件上的維護對於開業這麼久的酒店應該是蠻好了，但是窗簾真的不漏光！當時因為實在太累了，就沒有要求換房間。所以如果酒店的工作人員看到的話，可以關注下1710房間的窗簾。

辦理入住是十二點之前，本來想要高層，但可能太早來了，拿不到，前台小姐姐（p1，忘記問名字了）幫我升級了房間！太謝謝她了😭
門口接待的小哥哥幫我拿了行李送進了房間，還詳細介紹了房間各個地方的功能和特色
很喜歡房間的景觀
就是酒店的水壺是臟的誒，本來想煲熱水，放棄了
退房的時候Mia小姐姐送了我一份護手霜，好懂女孩子，謝謝她☺️，Charlene小姐姐為我辦理退房，詢問我有無額外消費後立即為我退了按金☺️
是一次美好的體驗，下次來上海還會添加進選擇的酒店！

1 對我來説床墊很硬被子不親膚枕頭尤其難受 太低太軟 問客房要了一個乳膠枕 硬到像石頭 床品質量很差！

2 住18樓 夜晚入睡樓下汽車呼嘯聲很大請自帶耳塞

3 衞生間晚上非常暗 看不清臉

 4淋浴間水壓小  調節温度的開關很迷 小心轉過頭噴一身冷水 恐怖

5 要求雙床合併一下 因為有孩子 服務員説無法操作 晚上自己拼好了 服務一般！

如果公區的户外休息區的衞生能加強一下就更好了，晚上躺在最邊緣的户外躺椅上會有一陣陣異味。
還有個設計問題，馬桶間的沖水按鈕雖然很有設計感，但是對留指甲的女性很不友好。

環境：
坐落在靜安區但非常的有隱蔽性和高級感。附近有百樂門、靜安寺、購物商場，交通十分便利。

不是很網紅的打卡酒店所以反而覺得住起來很安逸。不會有那麼多的網紅來擺拍喝下午茶。晚上大堂的酒吧也很有氛圍感。

設施：
中式設計的房型很獨特也很大氣，但房間燈光有點昏暗，每次都得去淋浴間化粧才看得清。梳粧台也很小放不下很多護膚品、化粧品。
免費停車但第一次去車庫不太方便找。

I am very happy to upgrade the suite, thank you ￼, the happiest thing about the room is that apart from my favorite Chinese and Japanese style, the minibar and biscuits in the room are for free! Great!

breakfast:
In addition to the self-service bar for breakfast, the main hot food is made on demand, so that you can eat the freshest food, especially the hot pasta🍝.

swimming pool:
Great swimming pool, the depth is just right, for people like me who don't know how to swim, it's really close to the people!

……會變得不幸！

第一天早上home delivery點的健康早餐，配了茉莉銀針茶，一點事沒有。後來聽説餐廳裏有位女士喝了咖啡拉肚子了。
	
第二天早上想試一下美式早餐，選的三種口味的果醬一個沒送，送來了我不喜歡且唯一沒選的草莓果醬？？溏心蛋敲開裏面也是實心的，換了兩衹沒有好轉，我佛了。
	
重頭戲來了：第二天配的卡布奇諾，結果就是本應在餐廳吃飯的我因為肚子疼在BFC的廁所裏面拉肚子🚽
	
前段時間還爆出了璞麗酒店老鼠上餐桌的新聞，我還抱着僥倖心理覺得整治之後會好些。事實證明實在是太差勁了

msg:地理位置是非常好。從下車在酒店門口開始，服務員很多。

衞生：比較一般，廁所門有立體的污漬。早上其他房間在打掃，pinglingponglong聲音很大，還有吸塵器的聲音，早早被吵醒。


設施：洗手龍頭的水開大一點的就會濺出來。房間開關都是英語的。讓人摸不着頭腦

堂的美圖，來了之後確實驚歎，在絕對的設計面前，大眾的審美都是一致的，尤其是當午後的陽光穿過公園的高樹，透過竹簾，酒在金磚上，那一刻美到子極致，拾頭還有倒映的水面的波光粼粼，遠遠看時前台員工如在
畫中，一舉一動皆文雅有禮，看見我們在拍照，Jasmine和zoe還會很貼心

因為冰箱上面衹有一瓶水 正常情況都是兩瓶  還有洗漱用品 第一個房間是有的牙刷 然後第二天我換房 換去景點客房這個房間 是沒有牙刷的 需要自己打電話問前台準備的  
浴室那個地墊也是鋪好的 （也不排除是夜床服務）但是之前入住都沒有這種情況 
但是我就是感覺第一個房間是日間房 然後又重新開
然後在床上躺了一會 然後就感覺胳膊發癢 換了床單被套 才好一點。
所述均為事實 還有前台我説了不要首尾房 我要中間的房間 還是給我看個尾房 真的是無語

説幾個亮點: 
停車免費（這個很重要，否則樓下是15元/小時） 小冰箱東西免費，第二天可以增補。
退房時間可以與酒店協商。
大玻璃窗視覺好
早餐可以送進房
房間裏的音響可以試一下，效果很好，電影院線的片子清晰度很高。

美中不足:酒店裝修已經有點舊了。
這不是第一次入住璞麗，下次有機會還會入住。

1、住puli兩次，這次不好。前台登記人很多，我抱着寶寶需要等，沒人過來有任何詢問幫助，還一直聽見酒店自己的內部人員站在旁邊説話，説類似“這麼個辦事效率怎麼行呢”這種抱怨的話。
2、15:00辦入住，前台告知房間沒有打掃好還要等一個小時。我帶着孩子拒絕了，內部管理不行，顧客不背這個鍋。
3、早餐服務，服務生全部冷冰冰，感覺一晚上都沒有睡好。
4、有幾個打掃房間的阿姨還是不錯的，很有水準。
總之，各方面有待提高。

SPA的感覺還是一如既往的舒適，這次選擇了夏季套餐，全都用的法兒曼的產品，理療師的手法很好，做完後，讓本聒噪的我身心靈得到了久違的輕鬆。

房間住得很舒服，有茶具可以喝喝茶，但是似乎沒有提供什麼好喝的茶葉，可以請樓下長吧送。
長吧酒挺好喝，而且氛圍舒服，適合約朋友過來喝一杯！
健身房雖然比較小但是東西還算全，小冰箱裏甚至還有冰毛巾，我的最愛。
下次回上海繼續來住！
唯一的不足就是早餐，性價比有些低，東西並不是很多而且味道一般，希望改進

從到酒店起，我們基本就不需要操心行李的事兒了，辦理入住的時候熱毛巾和給孩子的小禮物悉心送來。房間面積不算小，雙床房床有點兒小，更適合兩個人入住。
值得一提的是等我到成都後發現可能落下一件毛衣在房間，試着聯繫了下酒店的張夢怡小姐姐，她幫我確認確實毛衣落下後幫我快遞迴家了，非常感謝她。

部分工作人員態度極其一般，事後得知居然是當天的值班經理。更是不可思議。一整個缺少必要的酒店從業人員的職業態度。當天圖書館做某品牌活動，門口沒貼告示通知，讓住店客人去其他地方的口氣，相當倨傲。至於什麼品牌給了他們這樣的自信，就暫且不説了。也算一種本地特色。

msg:前台服務很迷 提的幾個簡單要求 一個沒做到 感覺衹會敷衍拖着不處理了事 體驗感很差
其他服務員倒是挺好 很禮貌主動
酒店本身設計確實比較獨特 看得出來有用心 整體空間佈局比較舒適 風格也很前衞 追求酒店內飾的可以
但是窗外的景色比較一般 追求風景的不太適合
地段十分好 靜安核心區域 旁邊有兩三個大型商場
然後酒店本身整體消費偏高 同等服務基本比其他地方貴一倍 而且早餐真的很敷衍 就飛機餐一樣的
總體而言性價比感覺偏低 衹值1200卻賣2000+的感覺 在上海同等價位其實有很多更優不同選擇
另外可能是因為是設計師酒店 導致客人多 前台的服務是真的很不上心 不重視客人體驗也十分十分減分 比起傳統的酒店大牌差距不是一般大 反正下次不會再來了

msg:這次去上海住了一直很想住的璞麗，定的最基本的房型，前台很熱情給升了套房，但是就算是套房面積也有點小。朋友生日也安排了小禮物蛋糕和紅酒。
位置真的沒的説，樓下芮歐嘉裏久光和靜安寺，藍瓶咖啡，shake shack漢堡，大董，Ralph's coffee，你能想到的網紅打卡店都是兩分鐘步行就到。
酒店工作人員態度都很好，沒有過分熱情但是很周到，客房服務送補給也很快。衞生稍微有點粗糙，住的23樓花灑水壓很小，小到有種洗不乾淨的感覺。
每日三件熨燙服務沒有好好用到，迷你吧每天也都是免費的。
總而言之，不盡完美但舒適的一次體驗。
