A Baguette bread with the consitence of rubber (a fee days old) no cheese, co sausage, no ham. NOTHING suitable for westeran breakfast. Asking for cheese ...Meijo amd zero effort to explain or to satisfy the need. Needed a fork and a knife, nobody of the staff cares. I took it finally by my self out of the cabinet in the service corner.
Booking breakfast at Radisson there is a WASTE OF MONEY .... definately not that Raddisson Hotel during next time in Hangzhou

Environment: Located in the Qianjiang Century City Business District, it is surrounded by various high-rise buildings. There is a 711 Family Mart convenience store next to it, as well as KFC and Luckin Coffee. There is a subway station downstairs, and there is also a food street that leads directly to the hotel lobby, which is very convenient for eating.
Facilities: There is a gym and swimming pool on the fifth floor. The fitness environment is quite good. The buffet breakfast in the restaurant on the second floor is also very rich, especially the croissants are very delicious üòã, and the restaurant service staff is also very timely.
Service: It was two o'clock in the morning when I arrived at the hotel. Since it was my first time in Hangzhou, I couldn't find the hotel entrance. I couldn't find the hotel after several laps. I called the hotel front desk. The front desk guy kept giving me directions on the phone, but because it was very dark at night, I still couldn't find it. The front desk guy ran out of the hotel to pick me up and pulled my suitcase for me. Although it was late at night, the hotel's service was really amazing. It is recommended that the hotel add signposts.
Disadvantages: The swimming pool opens a little late, and there is no shaving bag in the room

It is convenient for travel. It is not too far from the big lotus. It is only three stops away by subway. The hotel environment is good and quiet. The buckwheat pillow in the room is comfortable. The room is clean and tidy with complete facilities. The breakfast variety is rich. The most important thing is that the service is good. I checked out early the next day and asked about the stay. I also received a small gift from the front desk when I checked out. I think this is very good~

In fact, after staying in many hotels, I am not very sensitive to the decoration and facilities (of course, I still like the decoration of Radisson very much, it is antique and artistic). The buckwheat pillow in the room is very comfortable. But the service is really the difference. This price is a super five-star service. And it is really thoughtful, meticulous and attentive. I came to Hangzhou to do a project. I held a pile of materials in my hand. I was in a hurry and didn't bind them. As a result, they were scattered in the lobby. The front desk helped me pick them up and sorted them according to the page numbers. I asked where to find such service. I will choose this one every time.

msg:Because I came to Hangzhou for tourism, I did a lot of research on where to stay. Among the Radisson Hotel Hangzhou Xintiandi and Radisson Hotel Bodi Center in Hangzhou, I chose Radisson Hotel. After the experience, it was not disappointing. It was very goodüëç

The hotel has been open for four years and is owned by Radisson. It is located in Qianjiang Century City. Surrounded by high-rise buildingsüèôÔ∏è

Sanitation: Cleaning staff can be seen in and out of the lobby, which shows that this hotel attaches great importance to hygiene. The room is also very clean and tidy. I paid special attention to the seams at the head of the bed, which are also very clean. It is really friendly for people with mysophobia. The bathtub in the room is cleaned very cleanly and spotlessly. It feels that different bathtub covers are completely OK (but it is recommended that friends can still put on bathtub covers when taking a bath to avoid bacterial infection).

Environment: The environment around the hotel is OK, and the surrounding transportation is convenient. The Yingfeng Road subway station on Line 2 is on the negative first floor. You can reach the second floor of the hotel after passing several eating places, which is quite convenient. There is also a parking lot on the underground first floor. Free parking is available when staying at the hotel. There are many kinds of breakfast. Even if you go in at 7 o'clock, they are all laid out. The taste is good. There are few people and it is convenient to take things. It is just right to eat and have fun~

Facilities: The hotel has a gorgeous appearance and an elegant design. The ceiling lights in the lobby on the second floor are very good for taking photos. People who like taking photos strongly recommend that you can take photos at any time. The room facilities are complete and have not aged or looked very old. There is a small suggestion for the toilet. In fact, you can purchase a smart toilet. After all, it is becoming more and more intelligent now, which is even more perfect. Buckwheat pillows and sponge pillows are also placed on the bed for selection. Personally, sponge pillows are softer and not so hard. The suite area is also quite large, and the bathroom is also separated into dry and wet areas, but it will be a little slippery when you take a shower. It is recommended to stick an anti-slip tip or provide anti-slip slippers, which will be better.

Service: The security guards at the hotel entrance will take the initiative to carry the luggage and pull the car door, and inform that the check-in is on the second floor. The front desk staff who checked in provided good service and were polite. They learned that we were traveling in Hangzhou and deliberately chose a room on a high floor. They were very serious and responsible in their work. What touched me the most was: I caught a cold and had a little cough the next day, so I called the front desk and asked for a few bottles of mineral water (I coughed a few times on the phone at the time). The front desk lady asked anxiously if I had a cold and whether it was serious and whether I should go to the hospital. The front desk had two packs of Jiujiu Cold Remedy sent to the room. I was really touched by this lady (her voice was very sweet, light, and very anxious and concerned. I forgot to ask her name, but I am very grateful to her). It is a blessing for the hotel to have such staff and such service. I deeply felt the warmth, like home ü´Ç I wish this hotel will get better and better üëç

The waffles in the breakfast restaurant were delicious, and there were also various noodle stalls, poached eggs, and many varieties of fruits. I was quite satisfied with the room, with large windows and large mirrors. Recently, the big lotus near the hotel held a Jay Chou concert, which was very lively. I took the children to visit the West Lake, Leifeng Pagoda, and Wulin Night Market. I look forward to the next time the whole family visits Hangzhou again.

In general, the hotel transportation is very convenient, the breakfast is also OK, the hot latte is recommended, the room is not bad, but when I checked in at 12 o'clock in the evening, I felt that the front desk was very busy. A waiter was helping other guests with luggage. There was only one person at the front desk. There were 8 or 9 foreign guests checking in in front of me. The phone calls for takeout were constantly coming. I waited for a long time before checking in. I always felt that there were only two people at the front desk busy at night. I wanted to laugh when I thought of one person and three phones ringing. It's too hard, hahahahaha!
I have stayed in other international five-star hotels, and I feel that the front desk service and attitude here are OK. I hope they won't be so busy. I really want to go upstairs to sleepüí§
Overall, it's still good. Avoid peak hours, and the check-in service is a kind of enjoyment.
The night view is still good, come on, workers

This hotel has just opened and was officially designated to host the Asian Games. It is only 1-2 stops away from the Olympic Games and there are many choices for restaurants nearby. My friend decided to check in. My friend arrived a day early and reported that the service in the lobby was very warm and satisfied with the room. I finished a tour of the North Peak Peak the next day before checking in at almost night time. The receptionist was very enthusiastic and had a friendly smile. I asked if I could stay with my friend. The first floor was quickly resolved, and I was given a room with a good view, which was very considerate. The buckwheat pillow in the room was very comfortable. I highly recommend it to friends who go to the Olympic Stadium to watch the concert. The price/performance ratio is also very good.

Suitable for business trips or staycations

The location is relatively quiet and nice

There are also convenience stores and coffee shops nearby

very convenient

The main entrance of the hotel is quite convoluted.

Not built in the square atrium

And it's facing the road

But it‚Äôs not on the same plane as the road.

Driving can be confusing

The hotel is cost-effective

The room is spacious and the buckwheat pillow is very comfortable

Stayed once in a standard room and once in a suite

The overall feeling is very good

There is also a Wenxing Restaurant downstairs.

It is very suitable for receiving friends who come to Hangzhou or a business banquet + one-stop reception

msg:On a business trip to Xiaoshan, I stayed at the Radisson Hotel owned by Radisson. The price/performance ratio is very good. The hotel is very new and the service is very good. Parking is free and the transportation is very convenient. The subway is just downstairs on the first floor.
The hotel has a lot of breakfast options, including egg pancakes. The tableware has been sterilized by high temperature and is still warm in your hands. I like it.
On the hotel gym floor, the swimming pool is quite hot.
The room is spacious, reasonably designed, has a good view, and is well arranged. I will choose it again next time

msg:After looking at many hotels, I finally chose Radisson. I didn't see the "lack of enthusiasm in service" that other guests said. On the contrary, from the moment I checked in, I felt the hotel's strong kindness and professionalism. It was less than two o'clock in the afternoon when we checked in, but the girl at the front desk was very considerate in helping us arrange and coordinate the rooms that had been cleaned, and patiently informed us that we would have to wait for the other room. The other waiters I encountered were all polite and considerate, such as the security guy at the door. I felt that all Radisson staff were upbeat, down-to-earth young people who worked hard. This feeling was really good and refreshing. In addition, takeaway and required items are delivered to the room by machine. Qianjiang Century Park near the hotel is also good. Although we visited the West Lake in the rain that day, it still had a unique flavor and left a deep impression. If it must be said that there are shortcomings, the breakfast can be improved (except for waffles) and a commission can be given. I can't appreciate the paintings in the room, maybe I don't have enough artistic talent.
Others are really good. I recommend them. I will always choose them after trying them.

msg:Once again, I am a fan of Radisson. This location, this quality, and this service make it really the first choice hotel in Hangzhou. The scenery in Hangzhou in winter is not as good as other seasons, but if you stay at Radisson, you can stroll through Qianjiang Century City Park in the morning, go shopping and eat at Impression City at noon, enjoy the lights of the Big Lotus in the evening, and enjoy the artistic a**osphere of Nanshan Road, so it is even more important to choose to stay at Radisson in winter. The floor I stayed on this time felt that the aromatherapy smelled better than before. The decoration of the room was simple and elegant, but not out of style. The design of wet and dry separation in the bathroom is very comfortable and convenient. My favorite is waffles for breakfast.
I hope you will have different surprises next time you stay

There are many office buildings nearby, but there are also a lot of delicious food. It is less than 800 meters away from Haidilao. It is very convenient for late night snacks. There is also free tea when you check in. Rest, there are not many people on the boat at West Lake and the audio introduction is very interesting. "Leifeng Pagoda has nothing to do with Comrade Lei Feng." Hahaha, I really thought it was Comrade Lei Feng's Memorial Tower until the show "The Legend of the White Snake" was played... The hotel's hardware and sanitation are quite good. Okay, all rooms have windows, and they can be opened even if the floor is high. The opening range is smaller. The breakfast quality is above average. The service can also refill the food in a timely manner. It is not easy during the Spring Festival. The waffles are well received. I will stay here again next time. I hope the breakfast variety will be up to date. Recommended to stay! ! ! Like, like, like

The bedding and toiletries are very high-end, and the waiters are also very enthusiastic. Although it is a business hotel, the quality is not inferior to that of a five-star hotel.
Yunyan restaurant is good and recommended.
This is a hotel that I will continue to choose to stay in. I am very satisfied with it, so I will definitely give it a five-star rating.

I slept in in the morning and went out to visit the West Lake in the afternoon. The breeze was blowing and the sun was shining. It was so pleasant to sit on a bench by the lake and relax. In the evening, go to Lakeside Yintai to see handsome guys and beauties.
The location of the hotel is very good, close to the airport and high-speed rail station, and the transportation is very convenient.
The breakfast was delicious, the waffles were freshly made and delicious, with honey and strawberry jam.

Recommended restaurants in Hangzhou include Grandma‚Äôs House by the West Lake, Pushu Restaurant in Qingzhiwu, and Louwailou, all of which serve delicious Hangzhou cuisine. Lingyin Temple has road control during holidays. It is recommended to take a taxi or bus to travel. Parking is inconvenient and quite expensive.
Shopping is also convenient near the hotel, such as Impression City, Sam's Supermarket, and 711 convenience store.
Downstairs is Metro Line 2, which is convenient and convenient.

This hotel is quite good and the room arrangement is very good. The room is very clean, and the bathroom is equipped with anti-slip mats. It is very considerate when bringing elderly people. The dry and wet separation of the room is also good. It is recommended for families traveling with elderly people.
The waffles in the breakfast room are fragrant, sweet and delicious, with a rich variety that the elderly will not be used to. There are also many steamed pastries, health porridge and beauty porridge are very good.
I am very satisfied with the hotel's service attitude. If you have any problems, communicate with the hotel in a timely manner and they can be effectively solved.
Parking is also very convenient, just go to the front desk and report your license plate every time you go out.
Already recommended to friends and family! Will come and stay next time

But it‚Äôs hard to avoid feeling uncomfortable when you see it! Later, because the TV network was not good and there was an electric shock when pressing the switch, we arranged to change rooms. Even after changing, the network was still not good. I thought this New Year holiday would be happy, but choosing this hotel was an unpleasant start! There is no privacy in the hotel shower and washroom. Children must not pull the two 2-meter-high sliding doors because the tall glass is unstable! That office chair will tip over when you lean it back, and there is a 50-60 centimeter step behind it. I can't even think about the children playing... What serious consequences! I touched the bedside chandelier several times in a row. It was designed to be very low. I don‚Äôt know what I thought. Don‚Äôt know what the meaning of pretending is? The most annoying thing is the air conditioner. The temperature in the hotel is uniformly controlled, but the room cannot be adjusted. It was so hot in Hangzhou in those days. The hotel opened the room at 28¬∞C. We turned it on to cool the air at 10¬∞C or the indoor temperature was 28¬∞C. The whole family left the room open at night. door to sleep. I have stayed in many hotels and this one is really bad!

I like a quiet, comfortable place with convenient transportation and close to supermarkets and food delivery!
At night, there are lights and scenery outside the window. It's quiet and beautiful, but don't make any noise.
The facilities and surroundings of Radisson Hotel at Peabody Center meet this standard;

The hotel layout is neat, simple, convenient and spacious;
The service is gentle, considerate and friendly!
The food in the hotel is also good, and the breakfast can also satisfy the tastes of northerners, with both Western and Chinese food to satisfy...
A special mention...the hotel's waffles are great!
There are also all kinds of coffee that I likeüëåone-stop solution!

Recommended by a friend, I was really surprised by the price/performance ratio!
I booked a deluxe twin room.
When I checked in, I asked about breakfast (it costs 88/person when purchased separately, and the price included in the room is quite a bargain). The lady at the front desk asked me very gently whether I would drive by myself, and reminded me that if I go near the West Lake... I suggest taking the subway or taking a taxi to go there. (To avoid having no place to park and traffic jams), take Metro Line 2 to Xihu, it‚Äôs only a few stops awayüòé

Not far from anywhere. Very central location.
The service and management are so heartwarming! Really detailed üëå
After checking in, because I felt great on the first day and liked it overall, I decisively extended my stay for one more night!

The hotel also has parent-child facilities.
Suitable for families who are on a business trip, traveling or walking with their children!

I highly recommend choosing Radisson Hotel.
Next to it is Qianjiang Century Park, as well as restaurants such as Wenxing Restaurant and No. 3 Warehouse. There is also a food street on the -1st floor.

I sincerely recommend itüëåI will continue to choose it next time I come! Good Good Good‚úåÔ∏è

msg:It was my first time to stay at this Radisson Hotel at Bodi Center on a business trip. There is a large lobby on the first floor, and there are people to guide you, but check-in is on the second floor, and you have to use an elevator to go up.

Lily, the front desk staff, has a very good service attitude. Seeing that I had a child, she took the initiative to add a set of children's toiletries to my room, which was very considerate. By the way, I also gave my child a Peppa Pig as a gift, which he loved very much. If you have any questions, you can contact her directly. The service is great. I will stay at this hotel again next time.

The room is very spacious inside, with good light and comfortable temperature. It's also very clean and the size is just right. The breakfast selection is also relatively rich, catering to customers from the north and the south.

After leaving the hotel, a new express package was mistakenly sent to the hotel. The front desk staff contacted me very responsibly and forwarded it. They were very patient and responsible.

The only small suggestion: the TV in the room always has no signal. The front desk tells you how to operate it. It is too troublesome. The key is that it does not support screencasting. I suggest that this can be improved and the hotel will be better.

Hope to stay at this hotel next time.

Her service attitude is really very good and she provides the best quality service to guests. Service, on the day of check-in, we had requirements for the floor and orientation. Even though the occupancy rate was very high on the weekend, we not only did not show impatience when facing the guests' requests, but tried their best to solve them, and even thoughtfully asked us to send WeChat so that they could be promptly Solve some problems for our guests. When you enter the room, the first thing you see is the large floor-to-ceiling windows, which are very clean. I was very satisfied with my stay at Yilian for three days. I left a small cash red envelope when I checked out. Lily at the front desk even called me to transfer it via WeChat. It was really great. There was no thought of taking it for personal use. The quality was very good and the hotel‚Äôs service was very detailed. Thoughtful, I have a new understanding of the city of Hangzhou.

The reason why we chose a hotel in Xiaoshan District was because the rooms were full during the Asian Games and our need for a quiet stay, so we chose the Radisson Hotel Hangzhou Bodi Center here.

Overall, it's pretty good, especially the cleanliness of the room. There's no odor at all and basically no flaws. I'm very satisfied with it. Secondly, the water flow is very large, the shower is very comfortable, and the bathroom is separated from wet and dry.

The hotel facilities are very beautiful, and the hotel lobby is very photogenic. It has a festive a**osphere of New Year's Day.

Special praise should be given to the service here, from Lily at the front desk to the room service staff. At first, because we had to stay for several days, we were worried that drinking water and toiletries would not be delivered in time. After we put forward our suggestions, they were implemented for us. very satisfied

The only regret is that the breakfast is so-so. Although it is fresh, the variety is a bit monotonous.

Before leaving, I also received a small gift, which was very considerate and satisfyingüëç

Next time I come to Hangzhou, I will consider staying at Radisson Hotel Hangzhou Bodi Center again. Thank you again. I am very satisfied.

When you want to go out, just go to the front desk and record the license plate number. The breakfast is also quite diverse, the room facilities are relatively complete, and the staff are also very enthusiastic, especially Lily at the front desk. I like her very much. A very cost-effective hotel, a very satisfying business trip, great.

msg:It is my first time to stay in a Radisson brand hotel. I feel good. The location of the hotel is very good. It is at the quasi-subway entrance of Qianjiang Century City. The first floor of the hotel is connected to the subway. It is very convenient. There are many places to eat around. You can go alone or with you. You can find a suitable restaurant with your friends. It‚Äôs close to Chris**as and the decoration is very a**ospheric. When checking in at the front desk, they found out it was my birthday and arranged a small surprise for me. I would like to mention that it was the front desk manager Queency who received me. The girl was very warm and polite, and I felt very good. The hotel's value for money is good. I will stay again if I have the chance in the future.

msg:It was my first time to stay at this Radisson Hotel at Bodi Center on a business trip. There is not much traffic in the lobby on the first floor. To check in, you have to go to the second floor, which is relatively quiet. There is a gym and swimming pool on the fifth floor, which is very convenient. There is a tea room on the fifteenth floor, which is more suitable for business trips.

The front desk staff is also very responsible in receiving express delivery. They communicate by phone before arrival. The front desk can provide free storage and the service attitude is also very patient.

The room is very spacious inside, with good light and comfortable temperature. The breakfast selection is also relatively rich, catering to customers from the north and the south.

Check out at 12 noon. I was delayed because I was running a marathon. After applying at the front desk, I delayed my check out until 2 o'clock for free. It was really considerate and the service was warm. Thank you Lily very much.

The only small suggestion: the TV in the room does not support the screen mirroring function, which is a fly in the oin**ent. I hope it can be improved in the future.

Hope to stay at this hotel next time.

This way, you don‚Äôt have to walk outside at all in the cold winter. It‚Äôs really awesome and super convenient.

The attitude of the boys and girls at the front desk was very good, especially Lily who checked in. The girl was very nice. She patiently answered all the questions she asked. When checking out, she asked if there was any room for improvement and she also gave me two free gifts. A bottle of mineral water for drinking on the way. The breakfast variety is also very rich and there are many choices. I personally like it very much.

The hygienic condition of the room is also good. The room is large and has bathrobes, hairdryers and irons. It is very complete. I will choose to come again next time.

I was very satisfied. The breakfast at the hotel was very rich and very appetizing. The service staff are also very polite and parking is free. It's a pity that I came here on a business trip and couldn't stay a few more days. I will definitely come here again next time. The service will be better. Thank you vivian again. It is recommended to come here when traveling to Hangzhou for business! Convenient transportation!

msg:The location of the hotel is good and the room is relatively large. The customer service manager Rick was very nice and sent a breakfast (although it was not used due to time constraints in the end). It was within walking distance to the Internet celebrity restaurant Qiaocun 28 Road next to it. It was also super convenient to go to the airport for more than 20 yuan. It's just minutes away. The only drawback is that the cleaning room is opposite my room. The cleaning ladies chat a little loudly in the morning. I hope the hotel can raise this issue a little bit during the training.

She also specially helped me choose a quiet location away from the elevator. She was considerate of the customers. The room is clean and spacious. If you need a cotton swab, send a message directly to Lily and it will be delivered quickly. The service is very warm and the whole stay is humane. The wet and dry separation experience in the bathroom is great, and I finally don‚Äôt have to wash and put on makeup in the wet. A friend came to visit during the trip. I registered at the front desk and was taken directly to the room to swipe my card to take the elevator. When my phone ran out of power, I called and the charger was quickly delivered to the room. I also used a robot for takeout. This hotel really felt like home. The check-out time can be ~2pm, and I was given a gift before leaving. The location of the hotel is also good, very close to Vientiane City, and it is very convenient to go out to eat. It takes about half an hour to take a taxi to Hangzhou East. I will stay here again next time! It‚Äôs a great experience.

Facilities: The facilities are relatively complete. Since I booked a regular room, I spent extra money to upgrade to a suite. The experience is very different. The suite feels larger and more comfortable. There is a bear the moment you enter the door. You won't feel lonely. It's great to live alone.

Hygiene: Hygiene is very good. It is the hygiene that a five-star hotel should have. The bath towels and bedding are also very clean. Especially the pillows are really comfortable. It is very peaceful to sleep.

Environment: Check-in is on the second floor of the environment. The entrance is magnificent and modern and simple. The designer added chicken legs. The environment in the room is also very nice. The big bathtub is really comfortable to take a bath by the window. It is also very photogenic. It is worthy of being a Radisson Hotel.

Service: From check-in to check-out, Rick's service is very good. Even if he has some simple requests outside of working hours, he still responds in time. Give him some chicken drumsticks.
totally: A very good experience and worth recommending

The decoration of the hotel is one of my favorite types. It is simple and elegant, and the room is not too big, with floor-to-ceiling windows You can see the street view outside, and the overall comfort is that the 1.2-meter small bed is neither soft nor hard. It is very friendly to me who doesn't like sleeping on soft beds, and it gives people a feeling of coming home! So I contacted Lily, the service supervisor, to extend my stay for one more night, and she helped me with the process, and also delivered fruit, which really made me feel at home. Both my children and I like this hotel very much! By the way, the hotel's breakfast is also very rich, the breakfast time is from 7:00 to 10:00, friends who are too lazy to eat can give it a try! I forgot to mention that this is the designated reception hotel for the Asian Games! If I have the opportunity to come to Hangzhou, I will still come and stay in this hotel!

The doorman was useless. Not only could he not help open and close car doors or drag luggage, but he also had no answers to all questions about surrounding attractions and transportation.
The front desk is incredibly arranged on the second floor. When entering the lobby on the first floor, there are only conspicuous escalators, which is very unfriendly to new guests dragging their luggage. On the second day after I checked in, I was wandering around and discovered that there was a straight staircase connecting the first and second floors. However, when I checked in, the doorman at the front desk did not inform me about it, and there was no sign indicating it in the hotel.
The front desk, like the doorman, didn't know the answers to all the questions. Oh, there was one more answer. You can search online.
All rooms have peculiar smell, which seriously affects sleep and mood.
Some of the facilities in the room are old, the pillows are soft, and the mattress is too soft, which makes my back hurt while sleeping.

It was a little difficult to find because the entrance was at the back, but the rest didn't seem too bad. The breakfast was decent, the room was large and clean, and the amenities were well prepared.
really! The picture frame with red material flowing down the head of the bed gave me a strange feeling. (The picture frame with black and red paint dripping and clumping from time to time was scary and difficult to look at, so I asked for it to be removed for the second day.)
I rested comfortably for 7 days and 6 nights.

It is at Yingfeng Road Station of Metro Line 2, and there is an elevator directly from the station to the hotel lobby. And the underground parking lot is also free. The waiter Summer who received us was very enthusiastic and thoughtful. We arrived at 10 o'clock on Saturday, helped us check in early, upgraded the room, and gave free breakfast and soup. The room area is large, and the bathroom is separated from wet and dry. There is no problem for a family of 3 to stay. Management and hygiene are also in line with expectations. From the hotel to West Lake, you can take subway line 2 on B1 downstairs to Fengqi Road for 30 minutes. It takes 30 minutes to drive directly to Xixi Wetland. This price is very cost-effective in Hangzhou.

The one downstairs The underground food street really satisfies my stomach. I am very satisfied with the stay experience. I will definitely come again if I have the opportunity. I recommend five stays

The service staff has a good attitude. The room I lived in before was a room with two rooms separated by a door. I was afraid of noise because I was a light sleeper, so I went to the front desk to change it. It happened that their front office manager was there. She seemed to be called Kelly. She was very gentle and had a very good service attitude. She directly upgraded the room for me and gave me a free breakfast. It was really a home away from home.

If you come to Hangzhou International Expo Center to participate in the exhibition, you must stay in this hotel. It is the most cost-effective hotel in the same price.

Distance: The hotel is 1.5 kilometers away from the International Expo Center, and it takes 5 minutes to call a car, which is very convenient. Surrounding shopping malls are also very close

Environment: The decoration of the hotel environment is simple and fresh, the interior of the room is clean and tidy, the bedding is soft and comfortable, and you sleep soundly.

Service: I noted on Ctrip in advance that I want high floors and quiet rooms, and the hotel has already arranged them. When I checked in, the guy at the front desk saw that I was on a business trip, and also helped me apply for a free breakfast. Such meticulous and personalized service is very heartwarming.

Generally speaking, the hotel has a very good experience for guests from decoration to service, and will continue to stay next time!

Can the breakfast time be 10 or 20 minutes earlier? Compared with friends who catch an early flight, it is more friendly. 3. The overall service awareness of the restaurant should be enhanced. What is commendable is that the service at the front desk is very good. I have been bothering the front desk due to personal reasons, and I am really kind. Vivian at the front desk is very patient and sincere. Overall recommend to stay. The recommended location is great!

The hotel service is good, but it is still recommended that the hotel provide n95 masks for the staff of the guests who come into contact with it. After all, there are many people in contact with to avoid indirect infection. It is best to set up the entrance and exit disinfection port, then it will be safe.

Don't you think we are three big men? (3) A few waiters were chatting there, but they didn‚Äôt find that the black tea pot was empty. I only found out when I came to ask for black tea.

msg:The attitude of some staff at the entrance hotel on the first floor is really nasty. I stayed for two days in two rooms, a suite and a queen-size room. The first day was very good and the front desk was warm. The second afternoon completely made me feel good about this hotel. Desperately. I brought the elderly to travel. The elderly did not have Alipay, so I asked the elders to get off the car in the lobby on the first floor, and I went to park the car in the ba*****t. As a result, the old man did not come up for more than 10 minutes after parking the car, and was stopped on the first floor. Let the old man enter (we have been staying for two days) and the old man will not let in when he shows his ID card and the room card at the door, but he has to scan the code with Alipay. After I go down, I must let him scan the code. I said that I had to do it for the old man, and the ink took a long time. Let the old man in. During the period, a man in a white shirt asked me to understand them. I said, why do I understand? I have been walking through the underground entrance and have never encountered this. Your hotel is also listed as 5 stars, right? As a result, this man yelled at me? He also asked me who was responsible for the hotel's closure because of this, and shouted loudly for the hotel manager to come? wnmd gave me a straight laugh, brought the old man out and didn't want to spoil the mood, otherwise I held back and gan him directly

Here are some tips to save you time
No. 1 yellow, the parking lot entrance can be found according to the arrow. No. 2 blue, you can find the hotel entrance according to the arrow. The white star is the center of the square over there. If you really can't find the hotel, you can contact the hotel, how to find it is more convenient.

The hotel is surrounded by office buildings, it is really convenient to eat, and the hotel is very good. Only after registration can you go up the stairs of the guest room. Not everyone can come in and out casually. niceüëç

The receptionists at the front desk of the hotel are very nice. Even if they are wearing masks, they can be seen smiling. Thank you Vivian at the front desk for reminding me to go to the airport as early as possible to avoid missing the plane. It is suggested that the hotel can prepare a little bread and biscuits for passengers who are catching an early flight, which will make customers with low blood sugar feel very considerate.

Will choose this hotel next time. Recommended, there is a warm place.

The hotel is commendable 1. The attitude of the hotel staff is very good (jim is good) 2. The eldest sister who cleans the room is also very enthusiastic and careful 3. The hotel's epidemic prevention policy is very good, you need to scan the site code to enter the hotel, and there are many nearby

What needs to be improved is 1. It is suggested that cookies and special teas can be changed for the small coffee break in the hotel (this is always the case when I come here) 2. The breakfast in the hotel can be more small, and the fried wontons and whole grains feel a bit too much 3 .It is recommended that the hotel arrange a bellman, otherwise the lady at the front desk will be very distressed to carry the luggage, and the luggage of the girls is heavier.

It can be said that this stay was quite pleasant, and I would definitely recommend it. Who would have thought that the ba*****t was confused when it came out, and the car could not be brushed out.

First of all, on the day of check-in, I brought a lot of luggage. The security guard at the door of the car did not say hello, let alone smile. Girls take it, what kind of management is this?
The service at the front desk is so-so. It was recommended by a friend who lived in the past, saying that the service at the front desk is very enthusiastic. This time, it was not as enthusiastic as expected. They bowed their heads and did not say hello
Breakfast is average. For this price, this breakfast can only be called average. During the meal, there were not many customers. The waiter went to chat with himself. Everyone in the management was there, and left after eating half
The cleanliness of the room is good, but the room looks like an ice cellar. It may be because it faces north. The engineering staff of this hotel don't check the air conditioner. They hardly have a good rest all night.
It can't be worse. Doesn't the general manager of this hotel know about this situation? Manage it well, it's too bad

üßπHygienic: It's okay, there are no flaws
üçÉEnvironment: This is the key point. The facilities are too poor. The toilet is not automatic. It is still in a separate small room. After going to the toilet, there is a mirror when you stand up. It feels weird. Then the sink is very small, but the sink is so big, and the paid tt is placed in a plastic box, and it feels a bit low. Then there is no big problem in the bedroom, but the quilt is super thin! Very thin, like the broken quilt of the Youth Hostel.

üîîService: The service is very good, the front desk and the restaurant, including the little girl watching the elevator, are very good.
The summary is an express hotel that seems to be working hard to move closer to mid-to-high-end hotels.

There is a free swimming pool and gym, too lazy to use it. It‚Äôs also enjoyable to just look at the road through the glass at the intersection and be in a daze. When checking out, you will automatically give you a parking ticket.
However, the mineral water is ice dew, and a red envelope with scanning codes is printed. It is recommended to change it. If the refrigerator sends a few bottles of local Hangzhou beverages, the experience will definitely be better.
Overall very satisfied!

msg:This is a great location for traveling with children. There is a traffic jam in the old city of Hangzhou. The hotel is at the subway entrance. Even if the weather is bad, you can go straight down to the subway. If you take a taxi, the traffic is very convenient.
The hotel is very cost-effective, Radisson's grade, the room is big enough, and the breakfast is good. All the way down the subway station, there are small restaurants and fast food convenience stores, even if breakfast is not included.
It is worth mentioning that the hotel‚Äôs fitness facilities are outsourced to a large fitness club, which has a gym, yoga classes, swimming pool, and a badminton court. Swimming and yoga are free, if you have time to use it, it is really a bargain.
The service attitude of the hotel staff is also good, asking for a few wine glasses to be delivered by the brother at the front desk in person. The little sister in the executive lounge is also very good in service, kind and natural, try to be considerate of the guests and praise it together.
In the future, relatives and friends will recommend this hotel if they go to Hangzhou.
Instead, my friend lived in an expensive hotel on the other side of the river, saying that the house was old and small, and it was really worthless compared to here.

msg:Great stay experience! There were some small episodes when I first checked in. The summer at the front desk resolved it very enthusiastically and professionally, and I was upgraded to a suite, which was really cool! The room is very large and comfortable, and there is also an oversized bathroom with a bathtub next to the window! In the future, I only want to live in a suite. It's not a little bit comfortable. I suggest that if you don't need money, you can try the Yiha suite!

msg:Thank you very much to Summer at the front desk for patiently helping me check in and giving me a breakfast! This is the first time I stayed at Liyun in the center of Bodi. The surrounding area is very quiet. There is an incubator specially placed for take-out in the lobby. The design is very human. There are disposable toiletries prepared in the room, which is very friendly to some guests who forgot to bring dental appliances. The bedside table is equipped with electric mosquito coil plugs, so I won‚Äôt worry about mosquito bites when I sleep. It‚Äôs very considerate. I will visit again next time I go to Hangzhou!

msg:The hotel is very close to the airport and is convenient for travel. The front desk is on the second floor. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you feel tall. Because it is an early flight, I arrived at the hotel after 9 o'clock. It happened that the hotel was full the day before and could not check in immediately. I can wait for a rest in the lobby. Fortunately, it‚Äôs not too long to go through the formalities quickly. What I didn‚Äôt expect was that Miss Xu, the beauty at the front desk, gave me a breakfast. Maybe it was apologetic for my waiting, but I was warmed anyway Arrived! The breakfast is very rich and I am very happy to eat. The sanitary facilities in the room are super good, especially the beds are particularly comfortable. The next day I called the front desk and asked to change to a higher floor. Coincidentally, she answered the phone again. I was satisfied with nothing else. On the floor, the beautiful sunshine from the large floor-to-ceiling windows makes me feel at home instantly! I hope you will always provide detailed services. This will be my first choice when you come to Hangzhou! ! !

Downstairs b1 is a food court with direct access to the subway station. There are not many types of breakfast, but each dish is new and different after eating, and the cooking skills are very good. The five-star conditions and service, the price is really conscientious.
Minor disadvantages: the courier does not help deliver to the room, and the pool is a bit small.

This complimented us but there was a cockroach on the doorknob before entering the room. But I'm too tired to care about the room area, but the floor tiles and walls can see dust or damage. Five diamonds for 500 yuan a night should be good but it really needs to be improved....
