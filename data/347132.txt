Service of a 2-3* hotel, hotel staff are unhelpful and rude.
Most of the spa facilities don’t work / they don’t bother fixing 
Hotel breakfast is definitely not up to 5* standard, the omelette had no taste 
Hotel room is better than expected 
The pool is good as the pictures but they really need to fix the water jets or else what’s the point of having the facilities
I wouldn’t come back 
Will add that they did provide compensation in form of bfast in the end, but still lacking.

A good point to mention is they tried to help and solve the situation, however, they still could not resolve the issue in the end, so, I had to move out of the hotel halfway.

The food area had some food on the floor from the previous night (prawn shells) and the food (breakfast)and snacks (in the mini-bar) were not the same as the previous times we went. Our first visit we were offered tea and coffee and had a plate of snacks brought to our table and someone was there checking in on customers. I hope the service can be restored to what it was.

Unfortunately for us, there were too many kids so we could only enjoy the pool properly before 9am. The room was cozy and nice with the proper city view even though we booked the cheapest one, and the thing that impressed us the most - the minibar including alcoholic beverages was free for guests ! 
We’ll definitely be back in November to enjoy the hot tub and the sauna again.

msg:Originally, I couldn't book a river view room because the trip was late, so I chose the Oriental Pearl Tower view room as a second choice. I never expected that the effect would be so great! I was really surprised to upgrade to a view suite with two floor-to-ceiling windows for free. When I checked out, the super beautiful Rita gave me a small gift.

Facilities: All facilities are very new, smart toilet, large bathtub, and minibar. It's really touching to be able to do free laundry.

Sanitation: Very clean, floor-to-ceiling windows feel very bright.

Environment: Large suite on the 39th floor, facing the Oriental Pearl Tower.

Service: It can be said to be in place.

The only drawback is that the breakfast is quite average. If it is not free, you don't have to pay extra.

However, the only good thing about my two-night stay on this trip is Amber in the restaurant. The EQ and IQ are very good, but relatively everyone in the house is wearing a white suit. The female manager was really mediocre, and she spoke with low emotional intelligence... which made many guests speechless in the morning. I really suggested changing positions, and then there was no next stay... I really can't say anything... just Very average~

I had a stomachache that day and didn't dare to go into the constant temperature pool. Soaking in the small pool relieved the stomachache. The Oriental Pearl Tower was also beautiful under the sunset that day. I booked a package, which included breakfast and a first-stay minibar. For us breakfast lovers, breakfast costs extra money. Zundu felt very sorry. Two tickets to the Jinmao sightseeing floor were also given. The tickets didn't need to queue up and went directly to the 88th floor. Good reviews. The hotel staff were all very good. When I left, Miss Betty gave me a car aromatherapy, which was simple and beautiful.

msg:Weaving a "Regent" fantasy in the "Flower" City
Regent did not disappoint us

Facilities: It is a somewhat old hotel, but all facilities are well maintained, leaving no traces of time

Hygiene: After staying for two consecutive nights, the room with the children was indeed a bit "dirty and messy", but when I came back, I found that the aunt had cleaned the room again

Environment: The Oriental Pearl Tower View Regent Club Suite was upgraded. The hotel is adjacent to the landmark buildings Shanghai Tower and Oriental Pearl Tower. The beautiful view of the three-sided floor-to-ceiling windows in the corner room allows us to easily check in the Shanghai three-piece set without leaving home.

Service: In terms of service, this is the most comfortable hotel I have stayed in recently. From check-in to check-out, every waiter in the hotel will do a good job of service. Especially Rita, she also recommended many delicious, fun and beautiful places in Shanghai to us. She is a warm and generous girl.

This time I brought my children to Shanghai specifically to watch the F1 game and cheer for the Chinese driver Xiao Zhou. I didn’t get to enjoy many of the gifts given when booking the room, including the “Internet celebrity swimming pool” check-in spot in the hotel. I can only look forward to seeing you there soon!

The Chinese restaurant on the second floor, every dish is carefully prepared. The Oriental Pearl Room is specially decorated for children. Another most distinctive service of Regent is the heating function of the bathroom... A touch of sunshine in winter☀️
Of course, the 007 swimming pool is always the favorite of children... The 24-hour gym provides convenience for any guest... Anyway, no matter which type you are, there is a part here that suits you... Come on... Come and experience the best memories created by the Regent team for you. Of course, booking on Ctrip is the best choice, and you can provide a reassuring service if you have any problems during your trip...

We could see the modern three-piece suit and the Huangpu River. The hotel was very clean. Snacks in the mini bar were free, and a bottle of red wine was given. There was also a very wide and beautiful swimming pool on the 41st floor. The water temperature was about 28 degrees. The children had a lot of fun swimming in it. You must go to the swimming pool to experience it when you come. When checking out, the hotel front desk also prepared a birthday surprise for the child, a box of chocolates, and the very nice staff Rita also gave a car fragrance. I will go again next time.

Since the room was tight on the day of check-in, the two ladies at the front desk, Bika and Rita, upgraded the room for free to ensure the guest's experience. I would like to praise the two beautiful girls here. The upgraded room has an excellent view. You can see the Oriental Pearl Tower and the three-piece suit. Especially late at night, you can see the ferry on the river while sitting on the sofa. With the free juices and snacks in the room, the whole rhythm slows down, and you can't help but feel a kind of warmth, and the whole person becomes relaxed and relaxed.

The snack bar in the room is provided free of charge, and it even includes a bottle of red wine worth nearly 600 yuan. Why not sit by the window and enjoy the beautiful scenery?
In addition, what attracts me most is their constant temperature swimming pool. The water temperature of the swimming pool is the warmest and most comfortable I have ever swam in. Coupled with the beautiful scenery outside the window, swimming has become a kind of enjoyment!
Finally, thank the Regent team. When we left, Rita Guo also gave us a beautiful little gift🎁.

Finally, I would like to thank every staff member at Regent, no matter what. Whether it is Mr. Bellman or Mr. Pool Lifeguard, they always serve us wholeheartedly with a smile. Although Pudong Regent has been in business for a certain period of time, it is still resistant. Although the hardware is a little old, it is well maintained, the location is good, and the service is excellent. It is worth mentioning that it is truly the most beautiful swimming pool in Shanghai. The beautiful scenery of Lujiazui brought by its large floor-to-ceiling windows is shocking that pictures cannot express. Swimming here is one of the most unforgettable moments in life. If Pudong Regent has the opportunity, I will definitely do so in the future. Feel it again.

msg:Awesome beauty Rita: I came to Regent for my fifth anniversary and contacted the hotel. Ms. Rita soon contacted me and arranged the layout of the room. She always cared about the itinerary and helped before checking in. It was really great. !
Nice room equipment: I like the color scheme of the Regent Hotel very much. It is very suitable for our trip. Coupled with the careful anniversary decoration, it looks particularly romantic. The small bar in the room provides drinks, snacks and red wine. The first round can be consumed for free. Although it is not very expensive, it is very satisfying♡
In addition, the view from the upper floors, especially the night view, is really good, quiet and relaxing.
Other hotel facilities: There is a swimming pool and gym on the 41st floor, 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., and the swimming pool is also a special feature. At night, you can see the Oriental Pearl Tower from the swimming pool, and the 20-meter swimming lane. Others were taking pictures. My husband just swam the entire 800 meters =͟͟͞͞( ꒪⌓꒪*)
Breakfast is in the cafeteria on the first floor. I'm not really picky about what I eat. I think the overall style is pretty good. There are all kinds of bread, all kinds of morning tea snacks, noodles cooked on site, all kinds of porridge and the like.
There was a little regret: when I checked out the next day, it rained. The hotel ran out of umbrellas and couldn't borrow one, so I casually asked if there was an umbrella in the room and we would return it soon. The front desk did not reject us politely, but directly said: "Didn't you check out already?" 』Although this is true, it still lacks some language skills and does not bring a perfect ending to the trip.
But overall, except for this regret, the entire trip from booking to departure was very comfortable ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ and met my expectations for Regent. This trip was in a hurry and I didn’t meet Rita. I hope I have a chance to meet her next time✧ෆ

msg:This time I bought a Ctrip 3488 two-night package with a lounge. I stayed during Valentine's Day and the hotel service was very good. Whether it was the uncle at the door or the front desk staff, their attitude and awareness were perfect. The room is overall very good. The minibar provided can be used as a replacement for Bulgari. There are two small problems with the room: 1. The temperature is too high. It has heated up during the two days of stay and it is too hot at night. 2. The toilet in the bathroom smells bad, and one of the sinks does not drain properly. As for the lounge, the first day was average. Most of them were pre-made dishes (chicken popcorn, spring rolls, sesame balls, etc., no formal hot dishes). The dishes on Valentine's Day were very good, and the Regent's special sauce is highly recommended, it is rose flavored. I wasn't looking forward to breakfast, but I felt very good about breakfast this time. Although there were many people, it was well organized, and there were no empty plates that were left unfilled. There were also many special dishes, which were very delicious!

It is right next to the three-piece suit and only a few minutes walk away. You can see Tomson first-class and three-piece suits from the floor-to-ceiling windows of the hotel, and the swimming pool faces the Oriental Pearl Tower. The child's arm was accidentally burned by the steam from the kettle. I called the front desk and a waiter was sent to the door to treat the wound quickly. Big thumbs up👍! They also left some medicine for me to change the next day. When checking out, the waitress was still asking whether the child's burn was serious. The details are very good! Praise the waitress and the service staff who treated the child's wounds! It would be even more perfect if fruits are welcome in the hotel room🈶️!

msg:During the Spring Festival vacation, I chose this hotel among two alternative hotels.
Let’s talk about the advantages first: the location is great and it’s very convenient to go shopping. The room was big and beautiful. There are not many places that can make my eyes light up when I enter the room. This one is one of them. The service is also very friendly.
Oh, by the way, the bedding is also comfortable.
Next are the deduction points:
The first is that the temperature control of the central air conditioner is too hot, and I can’t stay in the room during the day (it was so hot that I sweated for two days... two points off for anger 😂)
The second is that the opening hours of the lounge are relatively short, from 1 to 9 pm, and there is no variety (the door is locked) in the morning and it is not outstanding. Not very friendly to people like us who are heavily dependent on lounges.
In addition, there were several minor unpleasantnesses due to communication during the stay. Fortunately, the young lady who contacted us was very helpful and it was finally resolved satisfactorily (the praise for the service is given to her, and the points were deducted for someone else)

msg:It's hard to describe in a word, the hardware facilities are okay at first glance, but the software service level is another matter entirely. From the front desk to the executive lounge service, the cold attitude is thoroughly implemented. When foreign guests check in, their passport is not enough. They also require the other party to show their visa page to check their visa (it must be customs work). Although it is understandable, it is the first time that a hotel of this type has been treated so coldly. I sat down in the executive lounge for a while and asked about the types of tea. The waiter asked me, "What do you want?" The only thing that can feel a little warm about the service is the breakfast service in the restaurant on the first floor. But the breakfast quality is very average. There are very few varieties of afternoon tea snacks in the executive lounge and they are tasteless (Picture 3). The automatic curtains in the room were stuck on one side when they were lowered halfway, and were dusty after being lowered manually. The clumps of dust and hair accumulated in the gaps between the bed frame and mattress (pictures 1 and 2) made me not only disappointed with the hotel environment, but also disgusted! How bad is the sanitation work to lead to such a sanitation situation?

The only thing recognized is the location. I won’t step on the trap again next time.

Check-in was slow, but very attentive, and we were upgraded to suites from two other rooms. The night view is really beautiful! You can see the three-piece suit and the Oriental Pearl Tower
In addition to the building blocks and climbing frame for children to play with, Awuda's room also has bathrobes, bathtubs, and small ladders for children, which are very considerate. The hotel can also install a baby fence to make it safer to sleep at night. The breakfast buffet in the morning is on the first floor, and service awareness needs to be improved! There is Regent’s special swimming pool on the 41st floor! The scenery is really great!

Free parking benefit: We have two cars. Only one car is free of parking fee of 120 for one time. The other car still needs to pay the parking fee.

Breakfast: Service awareness and speaking skills need to be improved. Hotel slippers are not allowed to enter the restaurant, some food labels are missing, and the lids are not closed in time. Because there were already seniors sitting inside having breakfast, and one of them had already gone back to the room. No waiter realized that he needed to put away the used tableware and put a new set... This really needs to be improved...

There is no need to switch on and off the room lights, bathroom lights, etc. separately. The business trip was tight and I didn’t have time to dine in the hotel.

When checking out, Yuki will also pay close attention to the customer experience and ask about the stay experience. Except that the water pressure in the shower in the room is a bit too high, everything else is very satisfactory.
Daily wet cleaning service for three pieces of clothing (not cumulative, does not include express laundry): This is very considerate and will be very convenient if you stay for two days

msg:I have stayed in many five-star hotels in Shanghai, and this Regent Hotel is my favorite. Originally, I booked the most basic room type on Ctrip. When I checked in, the lady upgraded me to an executive room for free. I have a clear view of the night view outside, facing the three rooms. A set, ah ah, I suddenly felt full of happiness. Every aspect of the room was relatively good, and the facilities were first-rate. The most attentive thing is that in winter, the bathroom not only has air conditioning, but also a heating vent on the door of the bathtub. It’s so warm that you don’t feel cold even if you’re naked inside in winter. It’s really nice!

The swimming pool is nice, the view from the infinity pool is very good, the field of view is wide, the male waiter at the pool was almost embarrassed, I took two children with me and wanted two bath towels, the waiter gave me one, and then I wanted another one, so I went over there I stood there and pointed to the side. I didn’t understand what it meant, but I was really too lazy to dwell on it. In short, there are quite a lot of areas that can be improved. Let’s see if there is any improvement next time.

msg:It was a great stay experience. My boyfriend and I had the same birthday, and I wanted to spend it with a sense of ceremony. I chose the Regent Pearl Queen Room in a hotel in Lujiazui area. The room type has a very good view. It is on the central axis of Century Avenue. At 6 p.m. Later, the Oriental Pearl Tower lights up, and the scenery outside the window is magnificent. The various service details are also in place, making people feel at home. I communicated with the hotel in advance to celebrate my birthday. The hotel made a warm interior decoration. Thank you to Renee and Xiaojin from the housekeeping depar**ent. Yuki, who handles business at the front desk, is very skilled. Check-in and settlement were very fast and comfortable, leaving a good stay experience and memories. I hope to stay at Regent again if I have the chance. I really like the various series of hotel service products of the IHC Group.

I stayed there for four days and the room door wouldn't open every day. They said the lock needed battery replacement and the door was open. It was not open for a long time. I called the front desk three times and it took more than an hour for the front desk to open the door. The elderly and their children were waiting in the corridor. The service was so bad. The room door could not be opened every day. I contacted the waiter. The hotel told me that three pieces of clothes were washed for free every day, but I found out that an extra 260 yuan was deducted from me when I left the hotel. I contacted the hotel and told me that it was the laundry fee. After negotiation, the hotel said that 14 staff members would return it to me. This is pure deception. The consumer was discovered and the breakfast was average, a very bad experience. I won’t choose again next time.

The price-performance ratio is pretty good, the transportation is convenient, it's relatively close to the subway entrance, and there are plenty of restaurants nearby, so overall it's OK. A small suggestion, you can prepare some bathtub covers. I forgot to take pictures of the bathroom. The bathroom is also very large, with a shower and a bathtub. Good reviews.

There is also the very cool sauna and hammam area even if the sauna was not very hot. The jacuzzi was warm and big with plenty of room which was cool. The relaxing a**osphere of the sauna pool area is very good with a little relaxation music in the background. Around 8 p.m. there were, however, too many children screaming and running everywhere which was a bit annoying. The concierge service is very responsive because the fridge was broken and they found us an alternative in less than 5 minutes. The comfort of the bedding is also very pleasant. Being a big fan of marble, the decoration of the hotel entrance and the bathroom did not leave me indifferent and I really appreciated it.

msg:This time when I checked in at around 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, I didn't feel the service and reception expected of a five-star hotel. The waiter at the door did not say hello or help with luggage. I was playing with my mobile phone and I could hear the outside sound.
The service of the lady at the front desk was normal but relatively cold compared to the daytime. I understand that it was after 2 o'clock in the middle of the night. And I found that using an external booking software like ******* is a little more difficult than using Ctrip. I used ******* to book Pudong Regent, Beijing Regent and Chongqing Raffles InterContinental before. The front desk will proactively ask for the Intercontinental member account. If using Ctrip, the front desk will shirk and say that Ctrip bookings cannot be added. Is it because I just want to sleep this time, so I booked the cheapest room type🥹
Cleanliness: The arranged room is not very clean
One very disappointing point was when I requested a taxi when I checked out at noon the next day, a car of foreigners came out in front of me. The greeter at the door took the initiative to open the door, took the luggage, bent down and bowed with such enthusiasm😅 When my car arrived, there was no one behind it. Come and help with luggage or open the door
All in all, although my stay this time was only 10 hours, I didn’t have a very good impression of Pudong Regent. I’d rather make more money and stay somewhere else 😂

msg:1. Hotel location: Excellent, the rooms on the side of the Oriental Pearl Tower can overlook the entire core area of ​​Lujiazui, the view is very shocking, and it is more convenient to go to various areas of Lujiazui.
2. Room facilities: The mini bar is relatively complete, but as a luxury five-star brand, the interior decoration is relatively ordinary, especially the green bedside lamps, it is really difficult to inspire a sense of warmth and luxury.
3. Recreation and sports facilities: very good. Personally, Regent’s swimming pool has the best view in Shanghai, and the fitness facilities are relatively complete. However, it is recommended that during peak periods, the cleaning and replacement services of the changing rooms need to keep up.
4. Executive Lounge: The service is very good, the environment is luxurious and elegant, the service staff is very enthusiastic and professional, and with the invincible view of the executive lounge, the comprehensive experience is very good, but it is recommended to have a few more wines of different types during the happy hour The service experience will be richer.
5. Other aspects: The overall facilities and services of the hotel are good, but it is a pity that there is no special bar. The underground garage is an outsourced property, so there is an extra charge for parking, but there are plenty of parking spaces.

msg:Watch the short video and recommend Shanghai Pudong Regent Hotel. This time, I took my wife to Suzhou and took a flight to Shanghai to check in for one night. I arrived at the hotel after 4:00 pm. There were many guests at the front desk, and the check-in speed was very fast. The guy at the front desk recommended adding money to upgrade I asked for a room with a better view, but I refused. After learning that I stayed in the hotel for the first time, my brother warmly helped me upgrade the three-piece Oriental Pearl View room. I am very grateful to him, because my wife was very happy when I opened the door of the room. I like it, I hope friends who stay in the future will pay attention! This is the most satisfying part of staying in the hotel this time. Others, the room is a package booked by Ctrip. Maybe no matter how busy I was when I booked, I didn’t read the package content carefully. This package does not include breakfast, so I immediately contacted the hotel with Ctrip. , I want to refund this package, and book another one with breakfast, the hotel replied directly rejected, then I don't need hotel breakfast. My wife had a sudden allergic reaction at night, so I took my wife to the Oriental Hospital. I didn’t return to the hotel until early in the morning. I fell asleep until after ten o’clock the next day. I took my wife out for a meal, and returned to the hotel after twelve o’clock. Packed up and booked a car to go to the airport at 2:00 pm. The hotel called at 1:00 and told us that we had to check out at 1:00. Since the room was full, we needed to check out the room. I asked if I could check out at 2:00. I was a little tired and needed to rest for a while. He came to pick me up, but the hotel phone refused and said that it would be 1:30 at the latest. The two of us quickly packed up, went downstairs at 1:25, sat in the lobby and waited for 20 minutes, and left when the car arrived. Maybe my points in the Intercontinental depar**ent are too low, I have to check out at 12 o'clock, maybe high-level members will get better services! After this battle, Shanghai will no longer stay in Pudong Regent in the future. I also spent real money to stay in, and I can live wherever I want!

I ordered two breakfasts, and I can only say that it is really not worth the price. The variety of Chinese food is poor, the Western food is average, the bread is not fresh, and the toast is still hard. The swimming pool is not very big, and the indoor one is average. I mainly go for location, but if I choose again, I won’t choose Regent again. The hardware configuration and meals are really average. In particular, I want to make complaints: when I sleep, I don’t know if it’s a smoke alarm installed on the ceiling facing the bed or something for fire safety. It always flashes and flashes intermittently in the middle of the night. I can’t stand the impact... to sleep

Location traffic:
Just next to the three-piece suit in Lujiazui. You can reach the World Financial Center and Shanghai Center just across the street. The location is great.

swimming pool:
The net red infinity pool is actually very small. Next to it is a hot spring pool. They are all facing the Oriental Pearl Tower. But the glass is so dirty that you can hardly see the outside.

Room facilities:
The room is still relatively large, but the so-called soft drink bar has a lot of things to drink. Also the bathrobe was torn.


breakfast:
The breakfast place is also relatively small, not many varieties. It's just average.

Serve:
But the most uncomfortable thing is the service, the flight was late and I arrived at the hotel very late. Not even a person to carry luggage. The waiter said that the children's toiletries would be delivered to the room later, but this was never delivered later. The same is true at breakfast. I asked for a glass of freshly squeezed juice twice, and the waiter said it would be delivered. There was no delivery until the meal was finished. Really drunk.

msg:I was very dissatisfied with the experience. The front desk was arrogant, rude, and made things difficult. I said I lost my ID card. Can I use a temporary ID card or an electronic ID card or a photo of my ID card? I can’t live anymore, other places are fine, but the front desk said that it’s okay to live there, the whole time I was embarrassed, I lost my good mood, I left the store at 4 in the morning, and asked me if I could go to tidy up the room now? I said I checked out, yes, I called at 1:30 in the afternoon to ask if I was going to check out, and I said I had already checked out. Although the hotel is cheap, the service needs to keep up. Hotels with 300 yuan know how to smile at customers, don’t you understand?

msg:Choosing a hotel every time you travel is a headache, and this time was no exception. After comparing many hotels in Shanghai, I finally chose Regent. Before moving in, I was still a little nervous.

The waiters at the hotel entrance will take the initiative to greet guests. Entering the lobby is the scent of aromatherapy which I love. The person who checked in was Mr. Bao, the service was very good and very efficient.

Entering the room, it was quite beyond my imagination. The room facilities are much newer than I expected, very big and spacious. A desk is very large, and you can put a lot of things on it, which is quite practical.

The bathroom is also relatively spacious. The room area is really big. The bed is 1.35 meters tall. When I chose Lijing, I also liked the fact that her bed was relatively spacious, because the double beds in most hotels are 1.2 meters tall.

Others: The sockets in the room are relatively old. Breakfast: The variety is relatively small. The hotel's smiling service and proactive greeting etiquette with customers can be further improved.

Rita from the Concierge Relations Depar**ent called me back about 2 hours after I checked out to ask about my stay experience, and listened to me very patiently. In this regard, I feel that the hotel has done a better job. Only by listening to customers' opinions can we provide better services.

Next time I go to Shanghai, I will consider staying here again.

msg:Very average check-in experience. I added a large suite with more than 900 upgrades to the Oriental Pearl Tower view, on the 31st floor. Not to mention the location of the view is quite average. The hotel facilities are also very old at this price. The doors, windows, and edges of the coffee table are all obviously scratched The TV is also a model from more than ten years ago. In the legendary mini bar, there are only two bottles of water, Coke and soda, and there is a drink. The snacks are a Snickers bar and two small packets of potato chips. The things in Shang Xili are also very ordinary.
The thing that annoys me the most is the picture. I wanted to wear the bathrobe here when I came with my partner, but when I got closer, I saw the lipstick marks that I didn’t even wipe off. I want to know what the hygiene of the whole hotel is. It’s very poor. Excellent check-in experience, I hope everyone will not be deceived by the certain sound package and Ctrip package, and I live in a suite, so I must always remember that you get what you pay for, and at this price, there are several hotels next door. Sanitation service The facilities will be much better and newer. Even though it says it was renovated in 18 years, there is no difference in the facilities. Another point is that the design of the shower is very impersonal, the water pressure is not easy to adjust, and even the switch cannot be seen at a glance. They are also Kohler suits from 10 years ago.
Just one sentence, don't come, don't come, don't come, don't come if you don't want to regret it

Environment: It is relatively quiet and convenient to travel, even if it is summer vacation and weekends, it will not be noisy. However, it is relatively close to the surrounding buildings, so you have to draw down the curtains

Service: Great, check in in the evening, the front desk manager even upgraded to a one-bedroom suite, and also recommended the public floor of the hotel with a good view

The bedding is very comfortable, very suitable for business trips and leisure stays, very close to offices, shopping malls, and the Oriental Pearl Tower in Lujiazui

msg:Facilities: The room is square and has a large activity area. The table is large enough to accommodate two suitcases. The electric curtains are slowly unfolded, and the prosperity on both sides of the Huangpu River can be seen at a glance. The fly in the oin**ent is the toilet, there is no automatic flushing and massage function, and the manual button is not easy to use. The bed frame is a steel structure, and the bends are sharp. If I accidentally kicked it, it hurts. Hope it can be improved.

Hygiene: The ground, glass, table, quilt cover, etc. are remarkable, but the roll paper hardware next to the toilet and the bruises on the blackout cloth need to be improved.

Environment: First-tier urban landscape, open and beautiful. Especially lying on the bed, you can have a glimpse of the majestic majesty of China's tallest building, which can be said to be worth the price.

Service: considerate service, attention to detail, very patient and meticulous in picking up and storing luggage. The breakfast is relatively rich, and all tastes are catered for. Although it is not too big, the layout is reasonable and you won't feel cramped. The a**osphere of the restaurant is good. The infinity swimming pool is definitely a place to check in, and the "three-piece suit" is perfectly captured.

Summary: Regent sits on the excellent location of the "three-piece suite", and the service reflects the granularity and due standard, so it is worth choosing. Of course, the service is endless. After the baptism of the epidemic, the renewal of facilities should be put on the agenda.

msg:First, the hotel does not have a dedicated parking lot. The underground parking costs 120 yuan a night. When we arrive at the hotel at about 10 o'clock, there is no receptionist at the door. We have to stop at B3 underground, and there are steps to the elevator. It is very inconvenient to carry luggage.
Second, the hotel's breakfast is very poor in terms of five-star standards. There are few types. When I go to eat at 10 o'clock, many things are gone. Squeezing grapefruit juice, there is also a line for cooking noodles. The customers in front waited for more than ten minutes and were cut into the queue. It was very chaotic. At 10:30, a staff member collected the bread by hand and picked a few and put them back to the original place. I don't understand what this operation is, the management is really bad.
The third point is that the front desk service is very conservative and has no enthusiasm at all. I won’t talk about the specific details. How many bottles of water will be charged for taking pictures in the wedding room on the day of our wedding? The Ritz-Carlton next to it sent a box directly up, and the gap is obvious. The fourth point is that the view of the Pearl room is good, the bathroom facilities are relatively ordinary and old, and the mini bar is free.
In short, fortunately, the scenery of the Pearl View Room is not bad, other aspects are not worthy of the standard of luxury hotels, just for reference.

Some rooms can see the Oriental Pearl Tower, and some rooms can see the Huangpu River. Secondly, the attitude of check-in and service staff is very good Very good, this point needs to be affirmed and praised. We can try our best to meet the requirements put forward. For example, we arrived at 9:00 in the morning. It is impossible to check in logically, but the front desk is also trying to help us We solved this problem. On the second day, we delayed our check-out until 2 o'clock, so that it was just the time to go to the high-speed rail station, and we didn't have to wander outside after checking out. In addition, you can spend a small fee at the front desk to upgrade to a better room type. If we booked the suite we upgraded this time, the price may be higher if we book it on Ctrip, which is still very cost-effective. The first round of minibars includes free use of red wine. Of course, my wife and I don’t drink alcohol, but this generosity is worthy of recognition. In addition, there are three wet-cleaning services, and their online celebrity check-in swimming pool are highlights, especially at night, the swimming pool is facing the Oriental Pearl Tower, which is amazing. Nothing wrong with the room either. The only thing I want to raise is that there is no breakfast, and the suite has been upgraded. There is no breakfast yet, and my daughter-in-law feels that it is really unreasonable.

I accidentally arrived at the store at the wrong time. The waitress at the front desk told me with a cold face that she couldn't find the check-in information and I had to contact Ctrip myself. It is understandable that I made the wrong time myself, but when I checked in it was almost 11 o'clock. The front desk did not provide any help and was very cold and cold. I couldn't believe that this was the service of a five-star hotel. Later, I contacted Ctrip on my own, and about 20 minutes later I found another front desk guy to check in.

During breakfast, the guy below was also very indifferent. He told me that I would have to wait for a long time if I wanted a bowl of noodles. I asked how long it would take and after 10 minutes🥲, he gave a very indifferent answer... I didn’t feel like he wanted to give me this bowl of noodles.

Fortunately, I only stayed for one night. I wanted to complain, but the service of this hotel was overall poor. It should be a management problem, not someone else's fault. If the budget exceeds 1500, it is not recommended to stay in this hotel.

msg:I have never been particularly picky. This is the first time I have taken the initiative to give a negative review to a hotel. In fact, we don't care about old facilities and hygiene issues as long as they are not major problems, but the service experience is really bad. We arrived at around one o'clock. From getting off the bus, picking up our luggage, and entering the lobby to look for the check-in front desk, there were always people in the front lobby, but no one helped or guided me, and no one expressed any welcome. This even costs a few hundred yuan. The chain standards are not met. When we checked in, we were told that we hadn't packed it up yet. We checked in advance that the check-in time was 3 p.m., so we understood. The lady at the front desk told us to put our luggage down and go out for a walk. She would call us when we were done packing. Luggage will be delivered to the room. My partner had a fever that day, but he didn’t want to cause trouble to others, so it felt like it was about time to go out for a meal. At 3:30 after dinner, there was no call. At this time, he was already very uncomfortable due to fever. I explained to myself that I wanted to go shopping and dragged him around. By 7 o'clock in the evening, there was still no call. We decided to go back to the hotel and check out the situation. When we arrived, the lady at the front desk checked us in as if she didn't know what happened before. When we asked why we hadn't called us all afternoon, she said that her colleague had done it before. Isn't there a handover of work during a shift change? When I got to the room, I ordered medicine and were not allowed in. I had to go to the takeaway cabinet outside to get it. After taking medicine, I wanted to change into pajamas and go to bed early, only to find that my suitcase was not in the room! I called the front desk and said it was still at the luggage storage... It was a really bad experience... The view outside the window was beautiful, it was in this location, and the price was comparable, but the service was really lacking at all. Feel it. (The service of the restaurant staff was pretty good the next day)

msg:Giving 5 points does not mean that I am really satisfied with this hotel, but mainly because of its cost performance, free minibar, excellent quality and service attitude of hotel staff.
Let's talk about the problem. This hotel does not have a lobby bar. Secondly, the air conditioner in the western restaurant on the first floor is very cold, and I caught a cold there, and the quality of the products is not high. The room service can only be described as abysmal. In the service introduction, the dinner ends at 10 o'clock, but in fact, I get off work at nine o'clock. Supper ends at twelve o'clock, and supper is gone at eleven o'clock. Also, the dining cart cannot enter the room, so you can only eat at the desk.
Other than that, the hotel is fine.

msg:I lived in the Four Seasons before the epidemic, and it was the first time I lived in Regent. It feels different. The service is very standard, but it feels very blunt. It was more than eleven o'clock, and I was told to check in around half past one. I waited until 4:30 in the afternoon to call to tell me that the room was ready~ I went back at night and found that there was a problem with the room, so I agreed to change one. Before this situation, I should have thought about why I didn't arrange it in advance when there was a vacant room, and I had to wait for the guest to mention it. Do you change it only after you have an opinion? The room has been changed. I went down to get takeaway today, and suddenly found that the room card was not easy to use. The old room card was not updated, and the elevator was not easy to use. After waiting for a long time, someone came to give the room card. I asked for a late check-out, and said that it was only half past twelve, so I could check in later, but I asked for an early check-out, which was the first hotel I stayed in. There are a lot of women's hair on the floor of the shower room in the bathroom. If you want to take pictures, think about it~ This should not be available for a hotel of this size~ It turns out that there is a small TV in front of you when you take a bath in the four seasons. Now There is no more ~ ​​In short, the experience of staying this time is very dissatisfactory
Facilities: reduction
Hygiene: with hair

If it was a regular room type, I really don’t recommend booking it. There was a guy named Xia who checked out the second time. There was a man at the front desk who really made my experience extremely bad. I first said that I wanted to mail something. Maybe the male waiter didn't hear me. After checking out, he left directly. This front desk service really made me want to do it again. When staying at this hotel, the breakfast has few varieties and the dishes are very average. The advantage is that it is relatively clean and comfortable to sleep in. The concierge at the door is a plus.

When I checked in, someone helped me with my luggage from the moment I walked in. The manager handled the check-in at the front desk in person, and his attitude was very good! The service is very good and comprehensive. During the happy hour in the evening, the service attitude of the lady on the 35th floor was super good! Very gentle and attentive. The service provided by the front desk upon check-out was also very good. They also gave me a small aromatherapy. All in all, it was really great and the experience was perfect!

msg:I like the decoration of the hotel, it is Regent's consistent style. This hotel has all the expected services, the staff are professional and decent, but I didn't feel particularly surprised by the extra.
Facilities: The room size is good, but the hair dryer is older, not from Dyson, and the wind power is weak for people with long hair. MINI BAR comes with all freebies on the first day, extra points~
Restaurant: It's quite satisfactory, the breakfast is mid-range, the western food has no merit, but the quality is good and the price is reasonable.
Overall, it's three and a half stars, more suitable for nearby business trips or a trip for two.

Environment: The geographical location is very convenient, there are many options for taxis, subways, and buses, and the legendary three-piece suit is within easy reach. The room is full of floor-to-ceiling glass, allowing you to enjoy the invincible night view.

Service: The minibar is very rich, with red wine and various drinks and snacks, and they are all free.
The night before check-out, the baby suddenly fell ill with diarrhea and fever. She couldn't go anywhere the next day, so she could only stay in the room. The hotel kindly allowed a late check-out until 3 o'clock.
If there is room for improvement, the wireless signal in the room is not too stable.

There are not too many types of breakfast, but it's okay for simple meals. The attitude of the service staff is very good. I asked about the late check-out and helped to deal with it. The phone was answered very quickly, thank you very much!

msg:I booked a double bed room around 1680 and paid more than 300 at the hotel to upgrade to a double bed. Let me tell you my thoughts on this night:
1. When I arrived at the store around 21:30 in the evening, there was no one to help with my luggage and no security guard was seen.
2. The hotel sockets where I spent 2k for a night were basically not up to standard, so charging was like scooping water out of a cup with a leak at the bottom. I couldn’t charge it to 1% in half a day.
3. When drying your hair, you still need to hold the socket with one hand.
4. Generally speaking, five-star or above hotels can communicate with you about the 14:00 check-out service, and you will not arrive at the hotel until around 21:30 that evening to check in. Since the flight time is at 18:30 pm and you have only one morning, you really don’t want to bother trying to communicate, but you are told by the hotel. The occupancy rate was high the next day and I couldn't provide a late check-out. OK, I'll just assume that you really only need this room.
5. Since I flew from Macau to Shanghai, this was the worst sleeping experience I have had in a few days. The pillows and bedding were all uncomfortable.
Other than that, the attitude at the front desk is quite good, but I won’t consider staying here again. If this is the case, I think it’s better to close the hotel as soon as possible. Why bother?

msg:Check-in on the fourth and fifth day of the ***** month
Advantages: The location is unbeatable, the scenery is unparalleled, and it is a 5-minute walk from Dongchang Road, the No. 2 subway.
Disadvantages: There is no soap in the room, how can I wash my hands with it?
The water for bathing after 10 o'clock in the evening is actually not hot. It has been freezing for a day and I can only take a cold bath! The most terrifying thing is that the room temperature can only be adjusted to 26.5, and I was so cold that I shivered in bed on the first day.
The dinner was a set meal, and the dishes were not hot. Desserts were served directly with the main courses, and they melted immediately after eating. Not only did they not taste good, they were not full, so I went straight to McDonald's for another meal. Don't order it! It’s better to take out directly
The breakfast is also very miserable, with few categories and no choice. It is really better to order takeout. This hotel is not suitable for eating but it is called a family hotel. I think it is like a business hotel.
There are not even basic children's items such as children's toilet seats. Ctrip may have misunderstood this label.
The service can only be said to be passable. The swimming pool is very shallow and you are required to wear a swimming cap, but they do not provide swimming caps for sale. The water is also cold at about 28 degrees.
In short, apart from the location advantage, it does not meet any five-star standards. I will not go there a second time.

Let’s talk about the hotel itself first, the five-star international hotel, the service is definitely not good, the overall is very good, the reception of the staff is very good, and it is also very good, the attitude is decent and the service is satisfactory
In terms of hardware configuration, to be honest, it is a bit too old. After all, it is a luxury hotel on the list. There is no washlet in the bathroom, the bed feels a bit collapsed, and the phone in the room cannot reach the front desk.
Set meal, was I naive. It is already configured as a parent-child hotel...it is not suitable for bringing old mothers...
In addition, the breakfast is not very rich in choices, and I am a little disappointed

Disadvantages: 1. The front desk service is not good. Whether it is clothing or conversation, it is not online. It is not worthy of five stars. There is a girl who lowers her head and her hair is all oily. When I checked in, I lowered my head and used my mobile phone openly. I didn't tell her to ignore it. It was the first time I encountered such a situation.
  2 Because there are many families with children, no matter the lobby, restaurant or swimming pool, it is noisy, which is a torture for adult guests who are purely on vacation.
3 Breakfast and dinner are hard to describe. The dishes are not rich, the dining environment is cold, dark and noisy, and the waiters move back and forth like a food stall.

The most unsatisfactory five-star hotel I have ever stayed in. I personally will not stay here again.

msg:If you go to the pool, don’t go there. It’s crowded. Thank you🥹🥹🥹
First of all, I put my eyes on the edge of the pool when I went swimming, and then someone rushed me into the ditch. At first I felt that I should go down, but when I went to the bar, the waiter asked me if he could help me find my glasses. I told him that I might have lost them. When he got into the ditch, he was just sorry, sir. This ditch goes directly into the sewer, so sir, you may not be able to find your things. First of all, I don’t care whether you can find it or not. Can you go down first? In the end, I will dig through the ditch. I didn’t go straight to the one I found when I opened the slate. Here’s a problem. The waiter has just arrived and is not familiar with the facilities. He is also lazy. You don’t even bother to deal with me. When I spend money, do you come here and ask you to tell me that I don’t serve you?

Hygiene On the first day I checked in, I found a long black hair in my bedside table (I dyed my hair). I calmed down and took a photo first. When I was going to take a bath in the evening, I found that there was no bathtub cover. It should be said that I have no trust in their hygiene. The front desk is very hard. I replied that my hygiene was fine but I couldn't ask my aunt to come over and disinfect it in person. I thought it was a bit slap in the face. Then I came back in the afternoon after cleaning the next day and found a stick in the mini that slapped me in the face. It was very funny. Plus this attitude
 Then he said a funny thing about delivering tableware. I needed it. He refused me directly and said he was busy and couldn't deliver it. In the second sentence, he mentioned it and asked me to come down to get it. In the third sentence, he was very impatient and said it would be delivered but when it was time to check out. not coming
Pros: Cleansing products are OK, ironing is OK, doorman is OK, I apologized for two days after checking out (not very efficient)

msg:I have been unable to leave Shanghai for three years due to the epidemic. I have stayed in many five-star hotels in Shanghai. The overall feeling of this hotel is really disappointing.
1. The hotel that we booked a month in advance called the front desk to confirm that we had booked a suite for the tent and bubble bath. However, when we checked in on the same day, we still didn’t prepare anything. After complaining, we were given a bottle of bubble bath as shown in the hotel’s promotional picture. There are no toys, no tents, and they are all gray, which is very disappointing for the children.
2. Ctrip clearly stated that the city view suites are on the 36th to 39th floors. We were told that they were no longer available. Those who booked a month in advance were not reserved for us. We were given a room on the 32nd floor facing the southwest. It was very stuffy on the first day and we were older. Fortunately, it rained the next day and the hotel negotiated and provided breakfast for one person.
3. Ask the hotel to get parking coupons. The hotel told us that the suites can park for free. It turns out that we booked through Ctrip. Or does it require a fee? Discrimination? Discrimination?
4. The breakfast is messy and there is very little variety.
5. The suite we booked included a set dinner. Maybe because it was a set meal, the service was very perfunctory. We couldn’t finish the packed food and asked the hotel for a jar of dipping sauce, but they didn’t give it to us.
6. The only good thing is that the Shanghai uncle at the concierge is very enthusiastic and gives the hotel extra points.

Service: When calling room service, the response is very timely, and the problem is also quickly dealt with, with a good attitude.

Maybe because of the New Year's Eve, I felt very busy that day. The children's afternoon tea was very perfunctory, and no one came to collect things. I waited for a long time for someone to teach, and there was nothing to eat.

The breakfast the next day was even more chaotic. There was very little food, and the grade was not high.

The restaurant is also very chaotic. When I was locating, and when I contacted me for reconfirmation two days ago, I said that we booked three rooms and three sets of meals, but we still gave us two sets when it was in place. Feedback will be given. Some made up one set, and some forgot and added two sets. It was quite confusing anyway.

Over the past few years, most of the people who have stayed during the Chinese New Year have stayed in hotels with special features in Magic City. Although you can go out this year, there is no need to join in the fun on New Year’s Eve. The New Year’s Eve dinner is included, and the price-performance ratio is invincible! But because the room was full all of a sudden, the staff was not enough, the breakfast was very chaotic, and the experience was reduced, but the service attitude was restored by more than half. Attitude is everything!

msg:Staying at Regent during the New Year, the butler service is very considerate, especially my butler Cecilia's service is very attentive, and every service response is timely and efficient. Before check-in, I had already communicated with me on the phone, and asked about those areas that needed special care. On the day of check-in, I also introduced the room facilities and this special service in detail, such as free drinks and snacks in the mini bar, free daily laundry service and so on. I have stayed in many hotels under the InterContinental Group, and I am quite satisfied with the facilities, sanitation, environment, and services.

Then let’s talk about Camelia’s 2 big and 1 small family dinners. This may be the reason for the three-year epidemic. The cafeteria waiters’ training is not very good. I feel that the waiters are in a hurry. The dishes are prepared a long time in advance, so the quality, quality and taste Everything is lacking (we can only accommodate the large number of customers during the New Year). In addition, there are fewer restaurants in the hotel. The Chinese restaurant on the second floor is not only served slowly, but the taste of the dishes is still good.

Free wet cleaning service for 3 pieces per day: This service is very user-friendly, and it is very thoughtful for families with the elderly and children to provide such services.

Buffet breakfast: This is what I really want to complain about during this stay. I feel that this has always been a flaw in the hotels under the InterContinental Group. There are few varieties of Chinese and Western dishes, and the quality and taste of the dishes are not good. This hotel under the Hilton Group does a better job it is good.

He also thoughtfully saw that I didn't bring disposable toothpaste and toothbrush (a classic stalk in Shanghai), and also specially reminded me How did I use the laundry service (even though I didn't use it in the end). The room type of regent is actually quite business-oriented, with large and clear functional areas. The concierge room service is excellent, and the response to borrowing scissors very late is also very fast. The floor-to-ceiling windows are the highlight, the equipment is FM, the design of the bathtub and shower area is very comfortable, and the wet area is always a plus for me.
In the morning, I went around the famous infinity pool, and the scenery is indeed outstanding. To their credit the gym facilities are also quite good and can be seen to be regularly maintained. The temporary situation on the working day is still too hasty, and the staycation can come again later.

msg:The two gentlemen in the big family celebrated their birthdays, booked two city-view suites, and finally came to experience the Regent Hotel. Before check-in, Mark and Tim in the front office of the hotel arranged the room very carefully, and met all the requirements, making people feel at home. Upgraded to the Pearl View Room, the view is particularly beautiful, the room is warmly furnished, fully equipped with daily necessities, and the bedding is very comfortable. I didn't expect the dinner in the set meal to be so rich. There was a chubby waiter who was so thoughtful and thoughtful in serving the dishes. The Internet celebrity swimming pool is even more incomparable. The children were very happy and took many good photos. The breakfast is also very good, several waiters and a waitress serve warmly and thoughtfully, very patiently. I was lucky enough to visit the executive lounge the next morning. Jeny and a manager on duty showed us around and introduced us, and took pictures for us. I saw the wonderful scenery of Shanghai and experienced low-key luxury. I will come again next time I have the opportunity to experience

msg:Friends who want to live here, just read the article‼ ️
"Never before" wonderful stay experience👍
The kind where the police come to your door🚨

REGENT Pudong Regent
Let STAYCATION➡️
Change to "POLICEATION" in seconds 👮

what happened
No physical ID
Due to "not a Shanghai household registration"
There is no way to use the "carry-on" certificate
(The proof of the actual Alipay card package can be used
The police uncle personally witnessed oh hehe🙃)
This self-proclaimed MOD (finally proved not to be)
Really brave Ms. VICKY ****
Emphasize [can only]
Go to the nearby police station to apply for a temporary ID card
Otherwise, go upstairs and put your luggage first.
This is impossible ❌

I don't know if it's the "honey juice superiority" that's causing it🤔
Or out of rejection of "outsiders"🤒
But this **** lady is obviously not from Shanghai🤷
On the premise that the guest "has informed that he is willing to cooperate" to apply for the certificate
It is not allowed to put a luggage first before going out
This trea**ent is indeed not like staying in a hotel for vacation
It's more like registering in a detention center
Really, everyone must come and experience it!

💯The most interesting thing is,
After I expressly express my dissatisfaction with it
When communicating with the MOD manager on duty
The real MOD has been watching the show by the side! !
Hey~ [item] Manager, I'm talking about you!

See guest complaints as a MOD
Just watch a show next door by yourself
Arrange a younger brother to pretend to be a MOD to appease
In fact, without ever informing the customer
Contacting the police to come to the door is to use the police to make red faces
Give our guests, your food and clothing parents, a lesson?
Wow, it's really amazing, it's really a bit too dark

The story behind is that the police uncle came to the door (really hard work)
Inform Alipay card package proof OK
Slapped the REGENT team hard in the face
Hotel manager wipes dirty rice hole
Still want to embarrass and throw the pot away? Lujiazui is strictly controlled? ? ?

COME ON brother dei
Is it so difficult to admit poor professionalism⁉️
It's so simple to check Baidu
Even if you change to a cheap hotel, you won't
Call the police without informing the customer? ?
He also said that Lujiazui is strictly controlled.
Don't put gold on your face
With your level of business
How dare you compare it with Park Hyatt, Ritz and J?

by the way
Regent [the only selling point] swimming pool on the 41st floor
The view is okay, but the hotel is terrible
The indoor temperature is 10+, even the air conditioner is not turned on
Adults are shivering from the cold, let alone children.
Forget it, people say it is for environmental protection
Or everyone feels differently.
The so-called people who pretend to be asleep can never be woken up

all in all
Regent Pudong
View on the first floor
second-rate facilities
and happened to be met by me (be strict)
unrefined service
that's it, wanna feel it
POLICEATION WARNING
Xu Yingguang ~ Carry!

PS. Complaints are still reliable with Ctrip's customer service, give me a thumbs up! It's OK to use Ctrip to book a hotel~

Standing in the room and watching the night view of Lujiazui is even more shocking than the pictures on the Internet and imagination! During the epidemic, the occupancy rate was not high, and the swimming pool was almost empty. Adding money to the hotel front desk to upgrade the suite is much cheaper than ordering from third-party software. The overall service of the hotel is also good, in short, it is highly recommended.

msg:Objectively evaluate this bad stay:
1. The hotel front desk staff and restaurant staff are unprofessional.
The communication skills are extremely poor. When asking the front desk personnel about the parking problem, they bluntly answered that the parking fee needs to be fully borne by themselves. This is the case in our hotel and cannot effectively explain the reason. When I checked in, I was very talkative and had a particularly bad experience. I didn't feel caring, but felt like I was mistaken for staying in this kind of hotel for the first time. Regent is the hotel with the highest brand rating in IHG Shanghai. It is a pity that the front desk staff are unprofessional and have ineffective communication. At the same time, there was no apology for eating worms at dinner in the restaurant. The food was served very slowly and could not follow up in time. Some service staff were very dull. Do you want to say that they are just interns?
2. Room facilities are extremely poor
As the top product of the IHG Group, the TV is from the last century. There is no smart toilet, not even stereos and irons! When asked whether there is a sound at the front desk, the front desk replied yes. I asked if I had looked for it, but the front desk changed its words and said that the audio systems in all rooms were taken back for maintenance, and the explanation was weak. In addition, the bathroom leaks seriously. After taking a shower, the whole bathroom is full of water, ruining the three views!
3. Almost all hotel staff encountered lack the service awareness and ability of top hotels. When you encounter problems, you will only be explained and perfunctory in vain, and will not solve the problems and confusion.

They told me that there is only one waiter at night, and they are too busy. Is it because I underpaid you? Room facilities are old. Hotel guests do not enjoy free parking and pay 120 yuan for parking within 24 hours. There are few types of breakfast in a mess, and the price of more than 2,000 thousand is not worth it. Bad review! Beijing and Chongqing Regent won outright.

Hygiene: rooms, public areas, swimming pools and restaurants are very clean
Environment: Not to mention, the location is unique. The green space in the center of Lujiazui next to the CBD is suitable for walking.
Service: Exceeded expectations. Special thanks to the lobby package manager for being attentive and thoughtful. The two rooms are well arranged. The executive room also helped to upgrade to a better view.
The amount of dinner included in the package is very large, 4 large and 2 small can’t finish it all…

As there is no room for check-in on the day, I asked the counter if I can take the children to the swimming pool first. The service staff was very kind and took us to the pool floor first. Help us arrange a high floor view room.
The swimming pool is an infinity design swimming pool with a large and a small pool. The small pool is warm and suitable for small children to play in the water. Plus there are massage bubbles, adults can also lie in the water to massage and watch the children play in the water. It is very thoughtful design! Let's talk about the flushing room in the locker room without the smell of urine at all... Anyone who has been swimming knows how uncomfortable that smell can be, but the Regent Hotel is really careful to maintain this aspect... I am amazed Endless! I am very satisfied with all aspects of the hotel. The only drawback is that the breakfast is a bit poor and there are not many choices. I hope that more improvements in this area will be better.

The swimming pool is really beautiful, and the photos are very good. The lady at the swimming pool registration office has a very good service attitude and a very gentle tone. She took the initiative to take us to introduce some facilities and offer praise! The disadvantage is that I explained to the hotel in advance that I had a birthday, and asked the hotel to help arrange it. On the night of the check-in, the hotel sent a small cake, which was really small, just like a small cake that was not sold out for afternoon tea. I didn't find it when I went back to the room at night, and after looking around, I saw the small cake. Compared with the cake at Shangri-La the night before, I really feel very careless, there is no welcome fruit and blessing letter, just a very inconspicuous little cake. The doorman at the entrance of the hotel also felt careless. After the car stopped, we all got out of the car and walked over slowly to open the door, without asking if we needed help with our luggage. Another point is that we went to the swimming pool relatively late. We went in at about 9:50. Knowing that the swimming pool was about to close, we went in and quickly took a picture and went back. After filming, it was about ten o'clock, and then I went to the locker room to take a shower and change clothes. After my partner returned to the room, I complained to me that my aunt came to chase people while changing clothes, and it sounded like they were chasing you away. I felt that they were in a hurry to get off work.

There are two pools, the cold pool is 1.4 meters deep, which seems to be less than the standard length of 25 meters, but it is long enough for adults to swim.

The bubble bath package is still good, and there are many self-service snacks in the room. After the red wine, the handmade in the afternoon was a bit tasteless, and the tortellini I made myself tasted good! The small snacks were a little unintentional. The waiter was very good. I saw the child brought a glass of water over. I accidentally saw that the floor mat in the activity area was too dirty, and I was in no mood to stay. But in the end, the chef also gave a cotton candy Make up, the children are very happy. After the handicraft activity, I went to the swimming pool. The scenery is also great, but the smell of the disinfectant is really too heavy. After staying for a long time, my nose can't stand it. The large swimming pool needs to wear a swimming cap, otherwise it will not be allowed to enter the water, and there is no place to buy it. Can only go to the small swimming pool, which is also good. The dinner is Western food, the quantity is large but the taste is of average quality. It's good for kids to have fun. Finally, I complained about the statue in the restaurant area. I don't know what it is. The child said it was Amitabha Buddha. I thought it was Mao Zedong. Finally, it reminded me of the illustrations of the People's Education Edition.

Regardless of the environment, visible landscape, facilities, services and other hardware and software, the hotel is a leader among five-star hotels, and it is worth visiting👍. In particular, the high-quality service of Xiao Chen in the executive corridor bar made us feel at home, and we will choose Regent Hotel for vacation in the future.

I just turned to this hotel and took a fancy to the swimming pool inside. Although it is not a parent-child hotel, I can see that the hotel has made efforts in this aspect. Children's toothbrushes, slippers and bathrobes are provided. There is also a parent-child workshop, although it is relatively simple. Children who like to play with water and swim should love the pool inside. The scenery is also very good overlooking Lujiazui. Every time I swim and go back to the room to take a bath, the children also like the bubble bath. The service is also very good, in order to see the night view I also upgraded the room. The breakfast is so-so, although there are some shortcomings, but after all, it is not easy now. Overall quite satisfied.

The dinner/children's snacks/laundry provided in the package will bring the best price/performance ratio. In addition, souvenirs are also presented to wish the wedding anniversary. Take some time to wait for the room / pay another 120 yuan for parking / toilet flushing sound, the bathtub drain button does not work / the next door arranges the noise of the wedding room to completely disturb the guests who need tranquility, in short, although it is not a new hotel and the location is not as good Mandarin Oriental/Kempinski is directly next to the river, but the maintenance of Nu Skin and the enhancement of software still make up for the small lack of hardware. If there is a suitable package in the future, I will stay again.

It's understandable that the Spring Festival occupants can't keep up. After all, the Spring Festival is the time when the labor gap is the largest. But the cleaning of hotels and catering is a matter of quality, not understanding. Quality control plummeted after the brand change in the four seasons, the tableware in the catering depar**ent was not washed cleanly, and the cleaning of the housekeeping depar**ent was outsourced, resulting in inadequate cleaning of the guest rooms. These are taboos for five-star hotels. Unfortunately, Regent has stepped on it. There is a long way to go for improvement. The hotel's gym is praised for its reasonable and clear layout. The swimming pool environment is also good, and the pool is equipped with ginger tea and lemonade. Can first-class hardware have first-class quality control? Otherwise, any hardware is replaceable. In the service industry, only service concept is the irreplaceable way to retain customers. sex. Can ihg's rapid expansion in China ensure quality? A long way to go.

Special thanks to the staff at the pool and fitness front desk
Very polite, when I saw the child said it was cold, I sent a bath towel and put it on in seconds
The service experience during the stay was very good
Both the front desk and the staff
stay in so many hotels every year
Regent, I will definitely be back
I am very impressed with your excellent service

msg:The worst experience of staying in a hotel in the past few years, none of them, does not meet the standard of a five-star hotel at all, the only thing that meets the price is that the room is large enough. 1. You can only check in at 3 pm, but the front desk requires you to check out at 12 pm. You heard that right, the emphasis is on being on time. I arrived at the hotel at about 12 o'clock and waited in line. I didn't reply until 2:57. In the end, I couldn't help but ask, but there was still no room. It took a few minutes for the manager to change me a room. I didn't understand the operation and said yes The room has been cleaned, to be checked. 2. Open the card, grind and chirp for more than ten minutes, keep proclaiming that the child needs to add 700 yuan to enjoy the executive courtesy, I said first, I only need breakfast, and the remaining two afternoon teas, we will match one big and one small, free cocktails We don't need it, you still earn it. Just keep talking, you told me that my room fee was in the early 1,000 yuan, and you told me that multiple 130cm children would have to add 700 for breakfast. Are you stupid or I am stupid? 3. We only talk about obligations, not responsibilities. There is a welcome fruit in the package, but no one mentioned it when the money was deducted. I took the initiative to call at 5:00 p.m. and waited for an hour for it to be delivered. 4. Pool towels are only available at the male exit. Female guests do not deserve to have. 5. There are few varieties of breakfast, the first floor is not open and all are crowded upstairs, and the executive courtesy can't turn around and eat a lonely meal. Room full of waiters just don't know what they're up to? Orange juice is invisible, so I have to take the initiative and wait for it to be brought to you; I can’t make coffee by myself, wait, and finally, I just went back to the room after eating and didn’t even know there was orange juice. My husband waited for more than 20 minutes for coffee. I didn't drink it either. I said that so many people remember that you are a ghost. The ingredients for the noodles were spicy meat, which was placed out of reach. When I asked if I could add it, my husband suddenly realized. 6. The room is big enough, which is the only thing to be gratified, but the dust is very large, and I don't know how long I haven't used the vacuum cleaner. In short, it is still far away from the five-star hotel, and will not come again.

The hotel simply arranged the suite, and also presented red wine and cakes, and handwritten a greeting card, which was very heartwarming. The lady at the front desk of Lijing Club also let us enter the meeting room to take pictures. The hotel's heated swimming pool is very good, and the children are very happy to play. Before leaving, dasiy at the front desk also gave my parents a small gift and took us to the hotel door to get on the bus. Service attitude is super good. This time, it left a very good memory for our second elders. On the way home, my parents told me that this hotel is good and I will come again next time.

msg:There are too many good hotels in the Great Demon City, so I hesitated before making a decision, because Beijing Regent gave a very bad impression. After two days of staying, I feel that it is quite satisfactory. There is nothing but no bright spots. Of course, the horizontal comparison is good with Beijing Regent. Many, it may be true that northerners have a different understanding of the word service than southerners

🚗 Transportation: Due to the epidemic, the parking lot is at your own expense, capped at 120 a day, the parking lot is convenient and there are sufficient parking spaces.
🧹 Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, no problem. Personally, I think the mineral water in the room is a little less.
🔔Service: Just arrived at the hotel and drove to the lobby, there is no doorman or service staff at the door, or we got off the car and asked where the parking lot entrance is. This is a bad review. My car is quite niche. I booked a car and waited for a long time without saying hello.
Breakfast: The meal on the 35th floor, there are not many things, but the taste is not bad. I must order noodles when I live in a hotel.
In general, I am a little disappointed. I think Regent should be a little bit more demanding of itself. After all, it is positioned there, but it has an ordinary five-star feeling.

msg:Thank you Pudong Regent Hotel, let me have a happy New Year's Day

🚗 Transportation: convenient transportation, convenient parking, not far from the subway
🍃Environment: very close to the center of Shanghai, the environment inside and outside the hotel is good
Breakfast: not many types, but the taste is OK
Bed: very comfortable, fits well to the waist when lying down
Room facilities: The mini bar is completely free, and the drinking water can be delivered free of charge. It is much better than some so-called five-star but even bottled water.
Room view: It is a pity that I did not book a three-piece view room in the magic city.
Swimming pool: I have an Internet celebrity swimming pool, which is very suitable for taking pictures😊

🔔Service:
I saw Ctrip before I came, and some people complained that the service was not good. I was a little worried, but after I came, I felt that the service was completely OK. Everyone was very enthusiastic, especially the lady at the front desk, Cici Zhang, who was very caring 👍 accidentally broke For a red wine glass, I contacted the front desk for compensation. Before I left, a young lady chased it out and asked if there was any injury. She also strongly demanded that the compensation be returned to me. Don’t be too moved😘

In short, this money is very comfortable to spend, much better than a certain Langham and a certain Shenkeng

🍃Environment: The Lujiazui three-piece set is just across the street around, which is very convenient for eating. It seems a little deserted on weekends, but it is also rare to experience the leisure of the financial center
🔔Service: The hotel has one-to-one butler service. Downey, who was in charge of the stay, was polite, responded in seconds, answered any questions, and worked very well. The front desk staff are friendly and efficient.

Since the hotel still has to comply with strict epidemic prevention requirements, although dine-in is allowed, the method of self-feeding has been cancelled for breakfast, and unlimited orders have been delivered to the table, so the choice of food will be relatively less free, but it can be understand.

There were a lot of 1/1 people in the Internet celebrity pool. Compared with last year, the feeling of staying in other hotels in New Year's Eve was worse. In addition to the above, mentioning that I am an IHG member, the first response of the waiter was "Ctrip bookings cannot accumulate points", instead of expressing welcome, I feel that Lijing has not integrated into IHG.

The decoration is in line with the standard of a luxury hotel, but some facilities in the rooms look a bit backward. The bathroom is very large, with more than a dozen square meters, with double basins. The toilet and shower room are separated by glass. Unfortunately, the toilet is not smart. Drinks and snacks at the bar can be enjoyed at will, including red wine at no extra charge, and Lily's capsule coffee machine.
There are a lot of equipment in the gym, the swimming pool glass faces the three-piece suit, and the scenery is amazing.
Both dinner and breakfast are eaten in a western restaurant, which is an Italian restaurant. The main food for dinner is very cost-effective, and the salad and main dishes are also large. The breakfast variety is a bit small, but overall it is quite exquisite. I think Western food tastes better than Chinese food

The calm and introverted temperament is like a beautiful woman. At first, I just thought about the right price (including A dinner for two in a Chinese restaurant and administrative trea**ent) was set, but I did not expect it to completely exceed expectations after check-in.
The best thing about the hotel is that the minibar is free for the first round. All room types are the same. At first I saw the big bottle of red wine and I was very skeptical. I asked the lady at the front desk and told me that the red wine is also free! This is really proud.
I really like the indoor infinity pool on the 41st floor and the jacuzzi next to it. The photos are especially great.
In addition, I want to praise the very warm and thoughtful service of the lady in the lounge. After eating and leaving, they are all delivered to the elevator entrance, which makes my community a little flattered. Regent’s service is the best in the hotel I’ve stayed in in recent years, whether it’s the front desk, the lounge or the restaurant.
In short, I will consider Regent next time.

msg:Overall it was a disappointing experience. Originally wanted to live in Park Hyatt, because I saw that many of the Ctrip reviews have birthday upgrades, decorations and the like, so I chose this place. When I checked in, I told me that it was my birthday, but the front desk told me that I could upgrade the room at my own expense. I promised to give a piece of cake, but I didn't see the cake after checking out. The breakfast is really too general. The room rate is nearly 1,700, and the breakfast is less variety. At any rate, it is more refined. Compared with the surrounding Grand Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, and Ritz-Carlton, the quality of breakfast is really poor . What’s more weird is that the whole breakfast process took about half an hour. I told four different waiters to ask for coffee, but I didn’t come after I finished the coffee. I felt that Regent’s service standard was to promise the customer first and not to do it. Say it again! After eating breakfast, I returned to the room and found that the door to the room can be opened at will without a room card. I tried it several times, but it was unsatisfactory. Fortunately, I didn't lose any valuables, or would your hotel recognize it?

The room is very big, I booked the most basic room type, and the view is quite wide, not at all cramped. But when I first entered the room, I felt that the room smelled a little bit of smoke. How about all of them being smoke-free? But yesterday I was too tired, too lazy to change, just let it go.
I used to live in the peninsula every time I came here. In comparison, the peninsula cannot book the most basic room type, which is far from the garden view.
Regent’s price/performance ratio is quite high, the hardware is good, and the mini bar can be used for free. The breakfast is also pretty good.

The location is also very convenient. When you go out, turn right and walk about five minutes to the subway station. But if traveling, I still prefer the Bund, where it is more convenient to eat, drink and play.

🔔Service: Tucao, we arrived at the hotel very late last night, but the doorman didn't help with the luggage when we got off the bus, so we did it all by ourselves.

msg:My family and I came to Shanghai for the National Day this year. I planned to have a good time in Pudong on the other side of the Bund. I chose this Regent Hotel with a good location and high guest ratings. Sure enough, it was the right choice. The location is really very good, whether it is to watch the bustling night view, walk the long pedestrian bridge sightseeing trail, or visit it is extremely convenient. During this trip, we calmly felt the modernity and fashion sense of the magic city. Whether it is the reception staff at the front desk or the room service and restaurant service staff in the hotel, the attitude is enthusiastic and efficient. Dalsy, who was at the front desk in the lobby, took great care of us and actively asked about our needs. He ordered dinner for us and delivered the luggage to the room. All information and precautions were properly accounted for. I feel very warm in my heart.
         The hotel’s facilities are relatively new, and the rooms are spacious and bright. The windows can be opened a bit to allow natural wind to blow in. Of course, let the hotel room staff come to open it. The hotel's swimming pool is on the top floor, which can swim and has a nice view. The pool water temperature is appropriate, the depth is acceptable, and the water quality is clean. Not only children can play, but adults can also play. The swimming pool is open for a long time, and the environment for changing clothes and washing is good. Clean and spacious.
          The breakfast at the hotel is plentiful and tastes good. The service staff is attentive and decent. They will take the initiative to bring you coffee.
         In short, this stay was very pleasant and pleasant. Let us spend a wonderful National Day holiday in Shanghai.

msg:A very pleasant hotel experience. I gave my lover an early birthday. He has always liked the swimming pool on the top floor of this hotel. This is the first time I came after changing the name. I didn’t expect everything to be a surprise~ I called before I came here. On the holiday, it is also a birthday in advance. Please help with the arrangement. It is very considerate and also prepared a cake~
The package I ordered included executive trea**ent and dinner in the Chinese restaurant for two people. It was amazing to me again. From service to meals, the executive lounge showed its intentions, and sent us to the elevator before leaving, and invited us to go there in the evening. Have a drink~ The dinner dishes in the Chinese restaurant are definitely above the standard. I may ask a colleague to eat it again~
The last little egg, when I checked out, I prepared a birthday gift for my spouse~ It is rare to see him praise me: my wife, you prepared an awesome hhh I want to say that the hotel is the right choice~

There is also an executive lounge courtesy. I have to say that the quality of the executive lounge is much better than that of Jinmao and J Hotel ~ the taste is good!
The only bad thing is that the drinking water in the room Bichun mineral water Figure 4⃣️Too many additives, this is not suitable for babies to add to the milk powder, other overall experience is not bad

msg:The receptionist at the front desk was Becky and introduced very carefully. I learned that it was a birthday with the child. I also upgraded the room. The room has a simple decoration and gave a piece of cake. I am very happy to see the balloon. There are not many people in the swimming pool at around 8 in the evening. The temperature of the couple's constant temperature swimming pool is a bit cold for children. The jacuzzi inside is warmer after all. It is not a professional parent-child hotel. The disadvantage is that there is no anti-slip stool for children. Three-year-old children cannot reach the sink and can only brush their teeth in the bathtub.

msg:🔔Service: Thank you, becky, for the good service because I celebrated my husband’s birthday. I also sent a greeting card and chocolate before I left. I gave a birthday chocolate cake on the day of my birthday. I helped decorate the room.

🍃Environment: The whole hotel has good sanitation, not very luxurious style but comfortable, cost-effective, and experienced a lot of happiness, especially the night view and swimming pool yyds. The beds are also very comfortable. I like the radio in the room and enhance the overall a**osphere. I love it
[Moving night view] If the budget is relatively acceptable, it is recommended that you choose the room of the Oriental Pearl Tower. You can experience the scenery with different feelings during the day or in the early morning and night.

🚗 Transportation: It is very close to Dongchang Road subway and convenient transportation. There are many food choices in nearby shopping malls.
When I returned to the room at night, the night view was amazing
In short, the breakfast, afternoon tea, drink, birthday cake, chocolate, and an extra drink voucher, plus the invincible night view, swimming experience feels great value for this stay! ! ! Couples rush

🧹Sanitation: The rooms are very clean, although the facilities are a bit outdated, they are well maintained.
🍃Environment: The basic room type was booked. Because it was an anniversary day, the room type was upgraded for free. Although it is not facing the Oriental Pearl Tower, the scenery is very good and comfortable. Needless to say, the infinity pool is perfect for taking pictures. There are not many people at night. There are warm and normal temperatures. It is very considerate. You can take a good rest without swimming.
🔔Service: The service is in place, the handwritten card is very considerate, the balloons are also arranged, and red wine is also given. It is also good to be able to wash three pieces of clothes every day. Chocolates are also given before leaving. Thank you Sunny Li, the floor supervisor, and Becky Tu of the guest experience center. Thanks for making my stay so good.

The summer package is also very good, sending two breakfast and dinner, and when I arrived at the hotel, the front desk also helped to upgrade the room. Although you can't see the Oriental Pearl in the city view room, it is better than the height and the view is also good, and the mini bar and red wine in the room are free, which is still very impressive! The breakfast is not as bad as mentioned in many reviews, the style is complete and the materials are exquisite, and the taste is good. The omelet ordered is the best one I have eaten for breakfast in a five-star hotel. It is also a relief when the epidemic cannot leave Shanghai!

Compared with the hardware, the services of the above three are also worth our reason to come again!

From check-in to check-out, the staff I met were very professional and caring. The afternoon tea in the executive lounge was very good, and the staff was very nice. Shangxi's dinner for two is of very high standard and tastes great. There are many choices for the breakfast buffet, and I like the taste of the noodles. The net celebrity infinity pool has a first-rate view, and there are beautiful views both day and night. There is also a jacuzzi next to it, which is super comfortable. Those with children can also have fun. It would be better if parking could be discounted. Will consider staying in the future.

msg:The lobby of the hotel is small, but simple and clean. Because there is no requirement for a view of the room. So I ordered the top-level city view. In fact, don’t worry, if you want to see the "three-piece kitchen", you should book the room type above the Pearl Room, otherwise the area of the city view will be basically the same. The snacks and drinks in the bar in the room are free, which is very human.
I went to the same 007 swimming pool while the meal was off the peak. The swimming pool is not big, the blue lights are very beautiful, and the scenery outside. There are different experiences during the day and night.
The last regret is that the breakfast is just as ordinary as the netizens said, just take care of it. There is a charge for parking.
Overall, among the well-known luxury hotels in Lujiazui, Regent’s price/performance ratio is pretty good.

msg:In the past two years, the epidemic situation has been my favorite for children in local stores. Ctrip hotel packages are always great. This time, the Shanghai Pudong Regent Hotel package is a high-quality package that was stocked more than two months ago.
This package is a basic room type with double breakfast. The first round of mini bar is free. The mini bar not only has soft drinks, but also red wine, peanuts, potato chips and so on.
This time the room also includes the executive lounge courtesy, which will solve the afternoon tea and the glass of wine in the evening.
It also includes a dinner for two people, and the set menu is a small portion of the recommended dishes from other review platforms.
It's not over yet. There are also tickets for the first and the first of the indoor parent-child park Care Bears fantasy experience center. The hotel helped me make an appoin**ent for the next weekend when I checked in (local guests are relatively flexible and don't have to be in a hurry, so I spent two weekends).
Needless to say, the hardware of the hotel, here is a special compliment to the service of the executive lounge. I took my 2-year-old baby over for tea time. I wanted two adults to have a cup of coffee and some snacks. The waiter took the initiative to provide the baby with hot milk and gave the baby straws of appropriate length. In the evening, my mother slept with her baby. I went to have a drink on my own. The waiter recommended me wine that suits my taste. In addition, he patiently helped me take a lot of photos when I was alone, and I was satisfied with the selection. Punch card photos.

msg:There is currently no Four Seasons Hotel in Shanghai. It is said that the predecessor of this Regent is the Four Seasons Hotel. I haven't lived in the previous four seasons, so I can't compare them vertically.
It is worth boasting that the executive lounge of this hotel, because the room you stayed in this time comes with executive privileges, so you can check in on the 35th floor of the executive floor. The whole check-in experience is still very satisfying. The young lady at the front desk of the executive floor was very patient. She also asked about the itinerary of the guests staying in according to the epidemic prevention requirements. She was also asked to show the portable code and itinerary code, instead of just being perfunctory like other hotels. Dining in the lounge also feels at ease. Guests are also required to wear masks when taking meals. Some people may find it troublesome, but such meticulous work is not common in other hotels. There are not many types of meals in the lounge, but the collocation is reasonable. After all, the happy hour at night cannot be used as a dinner. We went to the lounge before the dinner and tasted their specially prepared sugar-free cocktails. At that time, they took the initiative to pack them for us. The initiative of the service is also commendable. Maybe other hotels need guests to propose themselves to receive the same service. .

1. The geographical position is excellent, and it is only a five-minute walk from the subway. Not to mention the view of the room, as shown in the picture. Compared to watching Lujiazui from the other side of the Naojiang River, watching the three-piece suit and the Oriental Pearl Tower in Lujiazui has a different flavor.
2. Check in at the lounge. The real name praised Ms. Sandra on duty that day, being in the high temperature outside, like a spring breeze. Clearly inform the executive lounge of the various trea**ents, thank you very much for her sincere service. Regardless of the position, the first person contacted by any hotel is equivalent to the first impression the hotel gives customers.
3. Come to the hotel for your birthday two days in advance, not the same day. I still arranged the room carefully, and welcome the fruits very much.
4. The executive lounge produces stable products. Higher than expected. The lounge staff is very nice!
5. A few details can be seen in the hotel's service. Except for the staff in the lounge, the next day breakfast was because the shoes were grinding feet, so I asked the guide for two band-aids and quickly informed a male manager in a suit that day, sorry for not remembering The name not only gave band-aids, but also carefully provided alcohol wipes! thank!
6. Needless to say, the swimming pool scenery is complete, and the sauna is a plus. There are many children in the summer afternoon, so you can go at night.
7. A few shortcomings: There is no electric toilet and seat heating, and there is no paper in the room, which is more inconvenient.
Next time I come to Shanghai, I will stay again!

2. The room is upgraded to the Oriental Pearl View Room. The view and minibar are very good. I think the room size corresponding to this price is quite reasonable. Look at the picture of the outside view of the room.

I have stayed in so many hotels and it is common to wear slippers to have breakfast. , it turned out to be a bad experience when I went to have breakfast and was stopped outside. Later, the breakfast manager solved it and it was okay. Then when I checked out, I sat on the sofa and leaned on the pillow. The waiter told me that this was a public place and I couldn't sit like this. I said that I didn't wear shoes when I went up. I just didn't sit up straight and sat on the pillow. I really don't know what's wrong. Let’s talk about the issue of extending my stay. They called me over and over again to ask me to pay. However, when I returned to my room, the room was not cleaned. They said I pressed the do not disturb button. I may not have pressed it carefully, but the hotel called me to ask for money. You should also ask if cleaning is needed. This kind of service is really bad. I have never written such a long negative review. I will never stay here again, and I will tell my friends not to let them stay here. The experience is really bad, one of the worst.

After I took two large boxes from the car by myself, the bellman took one box from my hand. The check-in at the front desk told me that the room with small view was full and could not be upgraded. I didn't care about it at first, but the waiter recommended me because my family of three suggested that I spend money to upgrade their five thousand yuan suite, and give me a discount for one night plus more than one thousand. From this, I immediately checked the official website app and Ctrip. The first small view room can be booked on all portal booking networks, so there is no waiter who said that I can’t upgrade if I don’t have a room. The second so-called suite official website price is only more than three thousand. This feels very disgusting. InterContinental Regent’s falsification of members turned free upgrades into paid upgrades. Extremely disgusted. The hygiene of the guest room is not up to standard, the bathtub has hair strands, and the work bed slippers are thrown on the ground with their packaging. The breakfast and the front desk are not well coordinated. I have to chase me for breakfast all day long (my room includes breakfast). Why is the service of Four Seasons becoming a Regent Hotel so much worse. I also feel a bit ashamed of being an InterContinental Platinum member. In the future, staying as little as possible in Intercontinental hotels seems to be a life advice.

msg:The room service efficiency of this hotel is worrying! On the first night, I got a strange smell when I entered the room. I called the front desk. A man answered the phone and agreed to open the windows for ventilation. I waited for nearly 40 minutes! Nothing! Another call was made 40 minutes later! It was a woman who picked it up. Why didn't I come up yet? What is she asking? I said open the window! Open the window! She said oh, wait a moment. Ten minutes later, the window finally opened. For nearly 50 minutes, I waited in the room without doing anything....At night, I took a shower and the shower nozzle switch knob in the bathroom had sharp corners and accidentally scratched. My hand was bleeding, so I ordered an iodophor disinfectant urgently from the **. The takeaway boy went downstairs and was not allowed to take it upstairs. I called the front desk. I said my hand was injured and I called for the disinfectant, so I needed to send it, because I haven’t finished the shower, my body is wet, my hands are bleeding, and it’s inconvenient to go downstairs. As a result, the waitress at the front desk said, “It’s okay to send it up to you, but you have to sign an agreement to prove that your takeaway is not inside our hotel” ..... I**.... 👋I'm all injured, and I want to sign it! Isn't it the first time to solve problems for the residents urgently? Fortunately, the injury is not big! Can stop the bleeding! Otherwise I would pack my luggage and not live here that night! The group worked late at noon the next day and planned to stay for another night. As a result, something more ridiculous happened at the front desk of this hotel: when I checked in the previous night, the front desk clerk helped me upgrade the room type for free, and my stay was Click on the one-click renewal from Ctrip to stay for a few more nights. The renewal room type displayed by Ctrip is the room type I booked before my stay, and the renewal order after my payment also shows the previous room type! As a result, Ctrip customer service informed me that if I want to renew my stay, either change room or add money. Changing room means downgrading the room type and returning to the room type booked before the previous night’s check-in. If you add money, you can continue to live in this room without changing it. , I really..... I have lived in countless five-star and six-star hotels in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and I have never heard such a statement... If you continue to live, you must pay for the free upgraded room type at the same day price? ! It's ridiculous! It's ridiculous! And changing rooms is even more troublesome! Because I have too much luggage! I have to go out in the afternoon to do errands, there is no time to clean up! Therefore, it is time to reflect on this kind of service concept. In short, I will not choose this one when I travel to Shanghai in the future, and the location is not very advantageous. Some Michelin restaurants cannot be delivered to this location.

就是要提個意見：來送蛋糕的服務生，開門後直沖進來送進房間…理解他是想服務到位，But…多少都有點唐突了..謝謝

本次預訂包含300元餐飲消費券還有贈送首輪迷你吧（包含一瓶紅酒）還是挺不錯的。

msg:首次入住麗晶品牌，酒店整體是摩登奢華風格，和以往住過的酒店都不一樣還別有一番風味，房間內有很大的落地窗可以將東方明珠一覽無餘，喜歡的話可以拍攝半天，因為是想當作婚紗使用，還提前看過房間rita很熱情的帶着我們看了兩遍，酒店得知還幫我們更換了床單表示喜慶，遺憾的就是上海市內不能抽煙有收取一個清潔費用，最後令人難忘的是退房時rita多次提醒帶好行李，但是還是有忘記rita還幫忙送下來，在入住的全過程非常關注你的需求，實在是挑不出毛病，綜合而言是很完美的。

msg:很少寫評價，但這次作為洲際的大使以及白金會員還是要來反饋一下。
首先來説一下缺點：
1. 第一天辦理入住的時候想通過前台幫忙免費升級一下房型被告知不可以，原因是通過第三方平台的訂單不享受洲際會員的權益，同時説當天要升級的房型不一定有。説的合規合具沒問題，酒店想讓客人通過洲際平台訂這點可以理解，但我在説明瞭我是白金卡會員以及洲際大使的身份，同時舉出了我在重慶麗晶的例子之後依然無果，衹能作罷。但重慶麗晶的做法完全不同，雖然也是第三方預訂，但在瞭解到我是洲際會員的情況之後立馬升級了房型。我這裏想説的點不是説一定要酒店升級房型，而是“以客人（尤其是洲際的忠實客户）為中心”的這種服務態度，因為作為洲際旗下的頭牌，主打一個頂級服務，這點態度都不願意做出來，那麼我為什麼還要選麗晶呢？

2. 不知道是不是因為酒店開業年數長的緣故，酒店房間裏的衞生真的有待加強。第一次入住的城景大床房，衞生間的墊圈上有之前施工留下來的乳膠水，叫了清潔阿姨過來擦了好一會才擦掉。不久之後掀開被子又發現床單上有沒洗乾淨的污漬 （或者可能是不易洗掉的污漬） 總之就是在白色的床單上看的很清楚，我覺得這個真的太不應該了，洲際旗下的頭牌哪怕不翻修硬件，這些最基本的床品是不是應該定期更換呢？在向前台反映了這個情況之後，前台經理大方的給升級了單卧套房，但同樣的問題依舊存在，白色的床單上有灰色的污漬以及油點，但客房部的人以“就是這樣的，洗衣房的人都仔細洗了”這種理由來解決客人的需求是不是不太合理呢？清潔阿姨最後給換了新的床品，我在想酒店其他房間是不是也有類似問題衹是沒人出來反映？

3. 單卧城景套房的遮光真的太拉垮了，問前台要了眼罩，連續兩天早上起來戴着眼罩才能睡着。請問這個就是酒店的設計還是可以改進的地方？

説完缺點來説幾個優點：
1. 前台經理會做事，在我們表達房間不乾淨的不滿之後立馬給升級了單卧城景套房並致以歉意，這點還是很有氣度的。

2. 酒店前台服務隨叫隨到，跟客房阿姨在第一天表明不滿之後，後兩天房間打掃的一塵不染很舒心。前台的同事最後一天還幫忙延遲退房到一點。

3. 同樣最後一天，把行李寄存在前台，下午回來取的時候發現手提袋裡多了一盒馥馬爾的洗護旅行禮盒，非常貼心。

4. 門僮小哥哥工作認真，每次上下車都幫忙開門拿行李，值得點贊。

寫了這麼多，真的是希望麗晶越做越好，如果上海麗晶像重慶麗晶一樣把“以客户為中心，以客户為本”的理念貫徹到底而不是把自己擺在一個大牌酒店的位置上俯視客人，並提升一下老舊設施的話，我相信上海頭部酒店裡應該沒有第二家可以和麗晶媲美。

msg:The overall impression of Regent Hotel is quite good to me, worthy of five-star praise. There are two points of praise. The first is that the hotel waiter reminded me to bring an umbrella in a note; the second is that the Regent Club staff can remember what drinks we had the day before, and asked us if we need to try other drinks, which proves that The staff at the club are very caring. But there are two criticisms, and I hope it can be improved. First, when we just arrived at the entrance of the hotel, I don’t know whether it was because we didn’t pay attention or for other reasons. My child and I each dragged a suitcase and walked from the subway station, but no one came to help take it or even came to ask; the second Second, when taking a shower, I found that there was not enough shower gel at the end. It is reasonable that every guest should check whether there are enough cleaning supplies, paper towels, mini bar, etc. after checking out. But it doesn't affect my five-star praise for your hotel, I hope you can do better.

給一些點建議：
1、淋浴和洗漱體驗不好，主要是陳舊與不好用，需要更換。
2、吧枱區，玻璃水杯及紅酒杯的杯口朝上，雖然吧枱有門，但也避免不了水杯落灰問題，可以使用杯蓋或者倒過來陳列。
3、地毯太舊，雖看上去乾淨，但避免不了灰塵很大的問題。
4、其他如空調噪音，開關控制，充電接口以及窗簾窗紗問題都非常的過時。
希望越來越好。

這次最讓人期待和驚喜的就是麗晶酒店
晚上玩累了到41樓跑温泉，看上海的夜景好不愜意。還有熱騰騰的薑湯，服務也特別好。
特別值得誇的是房間裏的洗護是用的馥爾馬，好高級的香味好喜歡。

泳池，位置，服務都沒得説，非常好，特別是電話總枱，禮賓部和前台的服務。給了本次入住最好的體驗。
衹説一下早餐，實在是拉低了整個酒店的層次，和一牆之隔的前台，禮賓的管理相差甚遠。早餐的品種少且質量一般，果汁也不是鮮榨，不值得單獨購買。整個早餐給人的印象就是服務人員看起來很多但根本沒有服務，大家都不知道在忙什麼。本來早餐廳地方就小，被服務人員佔了很多地方，結果早餐連帶位都沒有，太好笑了… 麪檔是需求最大的地方結果衹有一個不會説話的人在做麪… 最重要的還很難吃。
感覺餐廳部經理沒有什麼經驗，如果能改變的話，我依然相信會超過重慶麗晶酒店成為大中華區的標桿

環境：比起上次入住房間的燈具氛圍有提升，比較喜歡。當天給我們升級了俱樂部大床房，房間還是很棒的，唯一就是夕曬酒店又開着暖氣，一進去就無敵熱，大冬天要開窗才稍微好點。


服務：早餐服務一般，讓服務員倒杯咖啡他們説那邊有。和酒店的星級不太匹配，早餐的粉面區味道一般，其他還可以。

優點：1.親子房配套還是比較全的，上廁所洗澡非常方便。2.泳池景觀非常好，泳池配套服務也好。

今年住的最失望的酒店。。。

另外，建議親子工坊再豐富一些，晚餐味道還需提高。
最後，感謝酒店贈送的精緻的巧克力和特別好聞的香薰石，非常喜歡！

msg:很久沒到浦東，趁着工作不忙，猶豫了好幾天在幾家陸家嘴周邊的酒店裡選了這裏，算是對春節在重慶沒捨得住麗晶的補償。抱着對洲際集團的信任，也感受到了熱情的貼身的服務，但是，説不出來到底哪裡不對，從入住到離開，始終覺得膈應，同行朋友也有同樣感覺。

設施：綜合是滿意的。床不會太軟，床單和被子觸感非常舒服。好多老牌五星酒店房間電視都是老式的，特別不能投屏，但是這裏可以。然而無線網非常不穩定，看電視沒問題，刷手機平板讓人抓狂，顯示滿格實際很慢或者根本動不了，不知道是不是颱風傷到網絡設備了。不用無線，用流量，結果越靠近窗邊信號越差，微博圖片至少三秒，視頻要轉很久。

衞生：辦理入住後進房間，發現房間中央零星散佈少量零食殘渣和貌似紅酒瓶木塞碎片。然後換了一間。白天外面逛累了晚上準備泡個澡，放水五分鐘進來一看，飄了好多大顆粒灰塵還是什麼。算了不泡了。另外，保潔清潔做得很乾凈，但是，燒水壺留在辦公桌上竟然沒收回吧枱櫃，漱口杯洗完放回原處卻把用過的牙刷直接放盥洗枱面上（雖然刷子沒朝下），要麼插回杯子裏還能用要麼扔了我用新的，這種操作確實第一次見。

環境：酒店總體環境是沒得説，位置絕佳，房間夠大，景色不錯，健身房很大，泳池挺漂亮。

服務：無論前台餐廳客房服務都很熱情周到，面對問題都能及時處理和跟進，但都在可預期範圍內。這也可能正是問題所在，好的酒店解決問題往往能超出期待，讓人感覺他們真的為你着想，甚至比你想的更早更遠。不清楚這裏到底發生了什麼，想起前面還有位住客點評的“非常熱情的敷衍”，不一定恰當，但是他的意思我現在完全懂了。
反正我是不信網上都把重慶麗晶稱作重慶酒店服務天花板的評價都是假的，更願意相信所有麗晶同等一流，而我碰到的衹是個例。

缺點：酒店大堂空間不大，早餐種類不多。
總體上長者孩子都很滿意。

這次入住，發現稍有調整，走廊有裝修，客房換了一些傢俱，翡翠綠和暗紅珍的很搭，很高級的配色。但説實話，我還挺想念那個躺椅，這次換成一個小沙發了。
問題的話，淋浴間問題始終存在，那些開關真的很難用，生硬，花灑角度無法調節，出熱水很慢。還有，網格窗紗已經陳舊了，應該還是四季的遺留，上面佈滿灰塵。服務方面，人員一直很少，很少看到服務員，感覺服務也是冷冷，跟北京麗晶比起來差距比較大。個人提個建議，浦東麗晶本身氛圍感是高級的，但偏冷偏暗，如果服務也冷了，就會顯得沒有人氣，讓我想起北京瑰麗，兩家氛圍感是同一個路線，但瑰麗體貼入微的服務為那種高級感提升了檔次。

過去過年的，沒有任何心意表達。
總的來説，硬件過的去，酒店的團隊問題不小，不熱情不主動，五星級酒店裡算很一般的。最後沒住滿提前退房換酒店了。

先説優點：
·客房服務很棒。清掃人員素質挺高的，普通話標準，待人非常有禮貌並且床品擺放也會按客人入睡習慣調整。送洗的衣服基本幾個小時就送回來了，收拾得很有條理。
·裝修我個人是很喜歡的，mini bar咖啡好喝。總的來説這幾天在客房裡的入住體驗是很不錯的。

再説説有點失望的部分。
·Amex FHR通道預訂是有免費升級房型的權益的，這也是為什麼我會選擇以比攜程更高的價格來預訂，咱買的就是更好的體驗對吧？很不幸，第一天辦理入住時酒店告訴我不可以升房，不是沒有房間，就是要你加錢，理由是旺季。
·餐廳衹開了樓下那一家，早餐選擇很少，味道屬實有點難吃。我表示對上文“旺季”定義感到迷惑，客房既然這麼搶手，餐廳衹開一間還不好吃，你們確定最近真的生意好嗎？
·離店當天是清早7點，禮賓部好像沒有在值班，門口有個看監控的大叔不知道幹啥的，問他能不能搬行李就愣在那裡，還抱怨我行李重😂

綜上所述，這幾天住得還是非常舒服的，可能是因為疫情原因，服務略打折扣，以及這次沒有升成房有點怨念。

msg:離國金中心，上海中心金茂都很近，走走就到了，位置絕佳，然後就是下午等房卡實在等太久了，這個真的很扣分，二點説可以辦理入住，將近4點才拿到房卡，41樓泳池很好，看風景不錯，但泳池水很冷，泡泡池可，不會遊的走起。然後説一下早餐，非常不好，人家酸奶都是一罐一罐的，單獨包裝這家是盆裏一盆自己搖，很不衞生的感覺，人家烤麪包機都是開着的，他是手動自己➕温度加時間開還得在旁邊等着，人家黃油一個個獨立包裝放在麪包旁邊，他們家是切好片放在和酸奶一起的冰塊上，像三無產品，草莓醬説什麼自己家熬製的加了糖，塗在麪包上像鮮血一樣的顏色，果斷放棄了，這是有多節約成本，你的早飯要260多一位呢，怎麼能匹配上你的地理位置和酒店的檔次，最後服務態度蠻好的。

房間衞生值得一提，都是灰，進門就有灰團。。馬桶便圈有污漬。。。小朋友在地毯上滾了很多灰。。
頂層的游泳池景色還是很好的，水質也蠻乾淨的。
還有停車場要收費的。15一小時。

給酒店35樓西餐廳一點小建議 菜的味道稍微差了點 需要改進 ，上菜速度也有些許慢，不過服務員都服務的非常細心周到。總體來説入住體驗還是不錯噠
