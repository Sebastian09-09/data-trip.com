Since it was a holiday, the Riverside Restaurant was a tad bit crowded. Despite the number of people, we were attended to by the staff and was given two high chairs that we need. They also replenished food and drinks on time.

All in all, it was a pleasant stay in Paradox hotel. Their customer service is superb.

The hotel was very considerate to upgrade to a deluxe suite. The room was super large and the service was super good. The main thing was that the bed was big and it was much more convenient for a family of three. The occupancy rate during the May Day holiday was still very high, so I couldn't check in early. There was an interactive session during breakfast, and the baby was super happy. The buffet dinner was so-so on the first day. There were too many people and it was too messy. On the second day, there were fewer people, so the experience was much better. It was pretty good. The family of three ate very well. The overall feeling was satisfactory.

The high floor has a wide view and a large room. It is very comfortable. There are two bathrooms with a large bathtub. It faces the football field outside and there is a lighthouse next to it. It looks very nice when it is lit at night. The service response is also timely. There are robots to deliver items, but the knocking noise is quite loud, but there will be a phone reminder. There is a free MINI BAR, and fruits and snacks were given on the first day. The hotel's breakfast variety is quite rich, and the Western food is even better. There is a small children's playground, and the baby also played happily. There is a swimming pool and a gym with complete facilities. The only drawback is that its elevator is too slow, especially at mealtime, you have to wait for a long time.

There is a small park opposite the hotel, which is very suitable for walking the kids. It is a 15-minute walk from the business district, and it is very convenient to order takeout.

I arrived at the hotel early, and I originally wanted to check in my luggage first. The front desk service (Liang Yuxin & Qiu Ju) was very good. Seeing that we were with children, they upgraded the room and arranged early check-in. They are very considerate of the guests👍

The room is large, the double bathroom is very convenient, and the bathroom has a bathtub, which is suitable for children to take a bath.

The hotel has a rich variety of breakfasts and tastes good.

This hotel is very cost-effective and convenient for transportation. It is recommended to stay.

msg:The traffic is quite convenient, and it is easy to find by following the navigation, but there is no underground parking lot and the parking space is extremely tight, and this hotel seems to have contacts with travel agencies, so there are many members of the senior group.
When I checked in, the registration desk at the front desk gave me a free upgrade to an executive room, but in fact, I didn't find any outstanding additional benefits of the executive room, and the room was not big. Probably the only device that has more is the DVD.
Although the maintenance of the room is still in good condition, it has been renovated for a long time after all. The bathtub is small and shares the same area with the shower.
The view from the window is good, it is a standard football field, but there will be people practicing here at night, the lights will be very bright, and you must close the curtains to fall asleep.
The children's playground is not small, but the smell is very pungent and unpleasant! It definitely has an impact on your health.
The swimming pool on the fourth floor is estimated to be outsourced, and the service is extremely poor. Seeing as I was a hotel guest, a chunky middle-aged woman at the front desk of the pool claimed that she did not provide small cabinets and towels. He also said that you can use the swimming pool for free if you live in the hotel, and you don't need to think about the rest. The tone is full of "gift"! This is the first time I have received such a "gift"!

When I left, I forgot to take the charging head and cable, and told me after I didn't clean up, and didn't call me, and returned to Shanghai that night. I found out that I didn't bring it back, so I called the shop and said that I didn't find the information. It wasn't until Monday morning that I called the hotel again, and the second call told me that I found it and sent it to SF Express.

The location should be relatively good, but because the subway is under construction, it feels very low and many places are closed. When I checked in, the young lady who checked in was very good. The room I gave was facing the landscape. I didn't expect it to be quite a surprise
The hotel has a children's area. Although it is small, it is enough to play for a while. The swimming pool is also good and there are not many people
There were not many people at breakfast the next day, and the food was ok. It was enough. I came from Shanghai and stayed for one night. The price/performance ratio was extremely high

msg:Summary: Five-star hotel goalkeeper level, no success, good overall
It belongs to the top five-star level ten years ago
The equipment has not been updated for a long time, and now it seems that the facilities are not old. But the function is very tasteless and the equipment performance is outdated.
Excellent lighting, sanitary and clean

🧹Hygienic: Very good, clean and up to standard.
🍃Environment: The daylight is excellent, and the scenery is not far from the civic center.
The point that must be mentioned is that the facilities are not old, but it can be said to be very outdated. There is a feeling of a five-star hotel in the 00s. With the development of the times, many facilities have been gradually eliminated.
① The TV is large, but it cannot be cast. The picture quality is poor and there is no movie on demand.
Even the fast business hotels such as Hanting Hotel do better than Swiss Grand Hotel.
②The P2 air conditioner really has a sense of age... Still that sentence, things are new, but they are all a little outdated.
③The anti-human sink drain design is 1202 years old, and there is a rotary downward pressure... it was indeed the top fitting ten years ago.

You have to stand in the bathtub to shower, otherwise it is a shower feeling that is raining from the sky. Toiletries must be sent by yourself. This environmental protection principle is a bit too much. The quality of the breakfast was average. There was a fried yuba with fried yuba that was all black, I almost didn’t recognize it. The only selling point is that the swimming pool and parent-child park are okay

msg:這酒店住了十幾次了 越來越奇葩了
泳池據説外包了 現在不能帶泳圈（六月去的時候是可以帶的）然後強調泳圈有安全隱患 不給使用 這位女士應該是承包人吧 之前去的時候就多次詢問是旅遊還是住在附近 為了推銷游泳課 現在搞出這些奇葩規定 就是為了一門心思賺錢 儘量屏蔽住店客人的使用 因為大多家庭都是親子出遊
然後投訴值班經理 值班經理更是狼狽為奸 告知泳池去年便外包 他們無權幹預泳池的管理 並表示我可以隨便投訴 呵呵 幸虧衹是值班經理 不過這也讓我大開眼界 即使外包 難道住店客人的權利就可以這樣隨便踐踏？
再看看這個被芯吧 你還敢住嗎

1，房間真的很小，相對的衞生間倒還挺大的；
2，隔音較差，我們入住的房間裏鏡子是一扇鏡門，雖然上了門鎖，但是隔壁間的聲音可以很清晰的從這扇鏡傳過來；
3，小童樂園關門時間較早（09：00-18:00），下午17點半左右過去已經關燈鎖門了，雖然投訴後又幫忙打開了，但是影響體驗，建議根據入住客人訊息或節假日適當延長小童樂園的營業時間；

優點：
1，所有服務人員（前台、餐廳和各樓層保潔阿姨）服務態度都很好，微笑服務；端午入住還送了禮品（粽子禮盒和小朋友玩的拼圖）；第二晚投訴了小童樂園提早關門的問題，前台經理積極響應並上門道歉，最後晚上還把小童樂園打開了讓孩子吃好晚飯還能玩；
2，地理位置不錯，周邊商場多（金鷹等），基本幾個大商場的距離都在3公里內；
3，自助早餐、自助晚餐種類挺豐富，夠吃、且人不多（並不像其他評論裏説沒東西吃，至少我沒遇到），早餐中西式、晚餐還有自助小火鍋和海鮮、日式等；
4，總體來説，這個價位配上這個服務還是非常有性價比的，感覺酒店是在用心做口碑，挺注重客人反饋的。雖然中間因為小童樂園的事有點不愉快，但瑕不掩瑜，還是挺值得推薦的一家酒店。

msg:總體差評，具體如下:
這是本人第一次花將近500價格去住五星級酒店，然而還是被坑了:
1.房間設施陳舊，服務態度等都是三鑽標準，注意是三鑽不是三星，比如馬桶是普通馬桶不是通電加熱，房間面積偏小，枕頭質量很差，太薄不柔軟，被子也很薄，還有連最起碼的空調都不好使，該熱不熱，該冷不冷，浴缸泡澡也老是漏水，窗簾還是手動，
2.價格偏貴，將近500一晚的價格沒有感覺房間面積設施設備比三星的好多錢，甚至還不如有些新開的連鎖酒店；
3.服務也跟不上，給客人帶來很多不便，比如外賣不能送到房間門口，需要客人來回往大廳跑等，
4.還有很多人都説好的那個早餐，將近148一位，簡直是天價早餐，很多人評論都説滿意，品種多，而實際上是品種確實多，然而並不符合國人的口味，比如麪包咬不動，有的咬下去一口油，不如吃饅頭，白粥喝的時候一股腥味，瞬間沒食慾，無奈去要了一碗麪然而麪也煮的不專業，不如外面十幾塊錢一碗奧灶麪正宗，總結就是品種多，華而不實，不合本地人口味。

訂的時候還是要仔細，特別是這麼貴的酒店，4.8分以下的就不要考慮了。

msg:這是一家老牌的五星級酒店，設施部分算部分符合五星級的要求，但這次住宿有點失望，以相同大床型的旅店來說，這家的空間應該是我住過最小的房間，此外，衛浴的設計也是從沒見過的腦洞，看的出來是舊型房間改新型的設計，充滿著不合理；由於飯店前面正在施作昆山S1線，故顯得有點侷促，但這不影響日後它的交通便利性，停車位有限，建議來這住需提早規劃，自助早餐的部分算中規中矩，屬於中上層次，如果喜歡素食或西式早餐，這家是不錯的選擇，中式早餐算還行；但雖然房間空間小，但床及枕頭本身感覺不錯，算是裡面最大的優點，可以讓人好好地休息
