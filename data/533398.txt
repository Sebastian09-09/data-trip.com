The front desk staff was great, especially the front desk staff member, 杜诗琪. 杜诗琪 speaks English very well and was extremely helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel. Also a robot will deliver your takeout food. Very fun.

The room is also soundproofed, I didn't hear any noise from the next room for three nights, and I slept very well. The big bed I booked this time is not as big as the last time, it seems that the same room type, the last time was 2.5 meters, and there was no souvenir when I checked out this time, but overall it is still very good.

The hotel service is very good. We asked for children's slippers and paper towels, and they were replenished immediately. The breakfast variety is not rich, and there are fewer Western-style snacks. Most of them are toast, which is not very delicate. The hygiene problem needs to be improved.

However, the room was relatively old, and there was no hot water on the second night from 21:30 to 23:00. The front desk replied that the hot water system was faulty. I was tired and exhausted after a day of playing, and I couldn't take a shower, which was a pity.

I heard that it was rebuilt from the original railway bureau, with an underground parking lot, which is very advanced. The room is large, the heating is sufficient, and the five-star service can barely keep up, but this hotel really needs to be renovated, giving people a shabby feeling, especially the bathroom, the design is very outdated, the facilities are very old, the front desk also expressed the willingness to renovate, looking forward to the transformation of the Northeast Building, a small gift of a dragon pendant was given when I left the hotel, and the children liked it very much. The hotel is more than ten minutes' drive from Zhongjie by taxi, and the location is OK.

When checking in, the lady at the front desk saw that we had a baby and chose a 2.7-meter extra-large bed for us, so we could rest well even with the baby. He also recommended the surrounding Laobei City to us. During our stay, they thoughtfully asked us if we had any needs and put plenty of mineral water for us. It was very heart-warming when we checked out. They gave us souvenirs, which felt so warm.

The hotel is clean, comfortable, tidy and quiet. The breakfast is very satisfactory. Especially when you are on a business trip, it is easy to get angry, and dietary fiber intake is very important.

This time I went skiing mainly. The round-trip bus stop is a ten-minute walk away. There are many delicious snacks, supermarkets and pharmacies near the city hall, which is very convenient.

A very pleasant stay experience.

msg:There were two rooms, one of which had a strong smell of cigarette smoke. It didn't clear out even after the window was opened all night. The room is large, the bed is wide and comfortable, and the floor is relatively high, so although the room faces the street, it is relatively quiet. The hotel door does not face the street, so you have to go out to take a taxi, which is inconvenient. The name of the light switch does not correspond to the specific light, and the arrangement is messy. I made a reservation a few days ago. When I arrived at the hotel that evening, there was no room. I was asked to wait until the room was vacated after dinner. The complimentary VIP waiting room of Shenyang North Railway Station was not allowed to enter. The hotel said that the hotel check-in voucher was not recognized by the station and asked for a QR code. The hotel front desk said it was in the order details, but there was no so-called QR code at all. When placing an order, The phone number in the details does not exist.

This situation is not uncommon in the process of relocation and reconstruction of new and old cities in various places, and the oldness of hotels has become a common problem. In short, it was so high-end back then, but it can no longer support the five-star standard today. In addition, as a five-star hotel, the service staff, especially the front desk staff, should be required to speak Mandarin.

Because of the delay of the high-speed rail, Ctrip helped to negotiate and modify the order in time. After checking in, a girl with a badge with a poem on it quickly helped to check in. The twin beds are spacious enough. The twin beds are bigger than other hotels, the air conditioner works well, and the room service is prompt. The lobby manager ~ Xiaomei also contacted and communicated in time, and all the services I needed were provided in time.
The variety and taste of the breakfast buffet are very good, and the children enjoyed it very much. There are quite a lot of meetings in the building. I will stay here next time I come back.
There is iced lemonade in the lobby for guests to cool off. It seems that there is still a lot of space for some high-end ice cream and tea drinks. The hot summer is coming. I wish the business will be better and better, and Liaoning's economy will also develop rapidly.

服務:網上預訂的，確認的準確又迅速，我一定
要提一下❤️魏巍❤️金雪情，這兩位經理，	
因為出行有父母一起，所以很在意房間和早餐，魏經理和金經理二位，非常細緻耐心，提供了很多幫助，感謝。
餐飲:營養均衡，熱豆漿牛奶果汁類的不提，我就説三點，①愛喝咖啡的有福了②水煮蝦一點不糊弄人③鹹鴨蛋還流沙。東西很新鮮，家庭出行，尤其是冬天，一頓豐盛的早餐特別幸福。其他:出來旅行，尤其是帶長輩的，我覺得選擇東北大廈特別的有優勢，而且想説兩個衞生方面的細節。一個是出門的時候，看見樓層清潔正在給退房房間做衞生，窗户擦得都很仔細。還有一個就是在給我們屋做清潔的時候，小桌子上落下了一瓶消毒劑	落下這個我反而更放心了，因	
為證明這個酒店的衞生是做在實處的，他們確實是好好消毒了哈哈。
PS.就拍一下豪華大床房這屋，住的太自在了哈
