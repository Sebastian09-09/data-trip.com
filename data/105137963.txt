The river is really a world of difference. Special thanks to Amanda at the front desk, who provided thoughtful service, gentleness and generosity. On the day of check-out, because the competition ended after 12 o'clock, I was allowed to check out at 2 o'clock. I will check in by myself next time I come to Foshan. I forgot that there are so many delicious foods in the shopping center opposite.

It would be better if there are outdoor tables and chairs! So I'm very satisfied. The only thing is that the pillow is made of duck down. I don't like the smell of duck down, so I have to wrap it with a towel. Overall, it's very good. I'll try it next time.

msg:Chaotic management, extremely poor service, differentiated trea**ent, and no spirit of contract.
After checking in, I stood and waited for nearly an hour. Because there was an internal order in front of me, which could not be found in the system, the hotel front desk chatted casually with the distinguished guest, ignoring the queue of customers behind me. There are no emergency measures in management.
I booked a terrace twin room. After checking in, I found that the terrace could not be opened. After asking the floor attendant, I was told that I needed to go to the front desk to sign a liability exemption agreement. This was unheard of for staying in a hotel for decades. At 8 pm, I went to the front desk to sign the agreement and asked the front desk to open it as soon as possible. When I came back from playing at 11 pm, it was still closed. I asked the front desk and asked the guest to contact the engineering depar**ent. After many urgings, someone came at 11:40 pm. Jinran once again asked to sign an agreement that had already been signed, which shows that the hotel management is chaotic and there is no communication and coordination between various depar**ents.
My order included free drinks from the minibar, but the refrigerator was empty. I called multiple times to remind me, but after staying for 2 nights, it was still not delivered, so the matter ended up being nothing. The hotel has no contract spirit.
I returned to the hotel at 10:30 pm the day before check-out. I was considering checking out early the next morning to catch the airport, so I parked in the parking space outside the hotel lobby, but the hotel management kicked me away and said it was not a parking space. But the next morning at 8 After checking out, I found that the so-called parking space was not full of cars. Are hotel guests divided into 369 levels?
In short, the hotel's management service is extremely poor and it doesn't live up to the beautiful scenery of nearby Qiandeng Lake.

1. We waited 40 minutes to check in. The reason was that the person in front of us was a Chinese with a passport who claimed to know the Courtyard GM. He made an internal reservation, but the front desk could not find the order. Then he asked repeatedly for his name, English name, and email address with flattery. , phone calls and other messages, completely ignoring that there were already about ten people queuing behind us. During this period, we kept whispering to each other, laughing and chatting, and did not take the customers in line behind us seriously at all.
2. There was a mistake in the room type. My friend's family booked a balcony room and got a non-balcony room.
3. We received a minibar with our order, but instead of offering it, we called to inquire. The front desk replied that our refrigerator is empty by default and we can give it to you if you want it. This made people very speechless.
4. The security guard insulted the guests and parked in the parking space on the first floor. The security guard watched us park and said nothing. When we parked, all the luggage and people got out of the car and rushed over to yell at us, saying that we could not park, and his attitude was very bad. After we drove away, we came back and saw another car parked at the same location (there is a picture to prove it). When we asked why, the security guard didn't answer and ignored it. I went back to the hotel lobby to complain and was told that the security guard was not from the hotel. Could you please explain why he was wearing the hotel's uniform?
5. There is no manager on duty at night. If there is any problem, there is no responsible person to deal with it, and various depar**ents blame each other.

The terrace faces Qiandeng Lake and the night view is beautiful. Disadvantages: Check in at 1:30 pm during the Spring Festival. Because there are few people cleaning, I waited for two and a half hours after checking in and still didn't arrange the room. I called the front desk and they said to arrange it as soon as possible. Later, I was too tired to drive here by myself, so I had to take the initiative to ask for a room at the front desk. Fortunately, I upgraded to an executive room. It is understandable that there are few staff during the Spring Festival, but the hotel should think about the occupancy rate and workload in advance, and the service needs to be improved. When booking the hotel, it said that the first round of free drinks in the mini bar, and I called the customer service center to say that it would be charged. I said, didn't it say it was free, and then the staff said that it would be arranged to be delivered immediately. I also asked for a quilt and a razor, but I waited for drinks and quilts from the afternoon to the evening, but they didn't come (I urged twice in the middle), and I called again the next day to deliver them. The most speechless thing is that when I booked the room, I saw that the hotel had charging piles, and I called the hotel in advance to confirm that there was fast charging. When I arrived, I found out that there were only 4 Xiaopeng car charging piles, two of which were broken, and the other was occupied by a gasoline car, and one was charging. When I asked the front desk where there were fast charging stations nearby, they didn't know anything. There are many new energy vehicles now, and as a five-star hotel, this issue should be considered.

msg:The third stop of the Spring Festival tour was in Foshan. I chose a relatively new hotel, but my experience was very bad this timeüëé
[Location] It is about a 10-minute walk from the subway, and the road is under construction, so it is very inconvenient to walk... There is a shopping mall nearby, and it takes a few minutes to walk. It is quite convenient, even the road is under construction at the door!

[Environment] The hotel lobby is relatively spacious, but the signs at the door are very unclear. It is definitely difficult to find for first-timers. Moreover, online car-hailing often goes to the Marriott lobby on the second floor, which requires telephone communication, which is very awkward. Conveniently, can the hotel improve the road signs?

[Room] The room is quite large, but the layout is very unreasonable. It is empty inside. The bathroom is quite large and does not have a bathtub, and the area is large enough to accommodate it. The design is really amazing... In addition, the hygiene of the room is not satisfactory, and there is dust visible to the naked eye. , we stayed for three nights, and the room was cleaned early the next morning. However, when we returned to the hotel at 4 pm on the third day, the room was not cleaned. After calling the front desk, we went out to eat. It was already 7 o'clock when we came back. The room was not cleaned. The reply from the front desk was that we will remind you immediately. I have never encountered such a hotel. The room has not been cleaned at 7 o'clock in the evening, and it was urged repeatedly. The explanation from the front desk was that there were too many people staying in us. I have stayed in hotels with more people than you, and I have never encountered anything like this. They are all excuses...

[Service] Check-in at the front desk is very slow, and there are more guests during the Spring Festival. There are only two front desks handling the check-in. You can imagine the efficiency... Moreover, the service cannot keep up at all!

[Catering] We didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel, so I won‚Äôt comment!

Overall, I am very dissatisfied. There is no service at all and the hygiene is unsatisfactory. It is a new five-star hotel and does not match it at all! ! !

msg:Pros: The breakfast is rich and tastes very good.

The location is in the new district, not far from Qiandeng Lake Park; it takes 20 minutes to drive to the Ancestral Temple or Liangyuan.

The room is new, but there are still signs of unfinished work in some areas, such as offset printing and dust in the public areas.

Disadvantages: When the front desk gave me a room, it said it was a "lake view room" and it was on the 18th floor. I went in with high expectations and found that I could only see a little lake view. And, the worst thing is, facing the central air conditioning of the hotel, you can hear the roaring noise when you open the balcony.

msg:This is an amazing hotel, with the Marriott Grandma's sign, and it's in the same building as the Marriott. I thought it wasn't much different, but the result was unbelievable!

Surprise 1) As soon as you enter the lobby, there are two counters. There is a person checking in at each counter. Unexpectedly, you have to wait for 20 minutes. The check-in speed is amazing.

Surprise 2) Room No. 2213. As soon as I entered the room, I entered the bathroom and opened the toilet. There were hairs everywhere. After washing my hands, I took a towel to wipe my hands. I found that there were only hand towels and no big towels for showering. The room was not completely cleaned at all.

Surprise 3) Go to the front desk to report the cleanliness and lack of towels. The person named Amada Li thought it was no big deal. She asked me if I needed to change rooms without saying anything. She seemed to think I was looking for a bargain. I had no intention of changing. I just told her about the problem with the room, but since she said that to me, I said yes. I told her that I didn‚Äôt have any special requirements, but I didn‚Äôt want the room to be on a lower floor than my current room. She said that the upper floor had already If there is no room for me, I will be given a room with a balcony.

Surprise 4) I finally changed to room 2322, which is one floor higher than my previous one. As soon as I entered the room, I was pleasantly surprised again. There was an unknown terrace, but the room was at least ten square meters smaller than my previous one.

Shocked 5) So I immediately went to the lobby to argue with them, why the room was smaller than my previous room. I didn‚Äôt ask for an upgrade, but there was no way they could downgrade me. I said I wanted to complain to their lobby manager, and then they changed it. I was given a room four floors higher than my previous one with the same area. I really wondered why they said they didn‚Äôt have a high-rise room with the same type of room as mine before. They really knew how to pretend to be big, genius!

Surprise 6) As soon as I entered room 2619, I opened the closet and prepared to hang my clothes. I found a used towel on the closet. It was really a surprise. The cleaning standards of this so-called star-star hotel are really top-notch. ceiling!

Also, when I booked the room, I was told that there was a mini bar for all-you-can-drink drinks, but I didn‚Äôt know that when I entered the room and opened the freezer, it was empty. I was only given 3 drinks when I got to the front desk. Why didn‚Äôt they give them to me when they gave me the room card? ? ? ?

In the end, I complained to their lobby manager, and finally found a person like Zoe Yan who spoke like a human. She could at least say sorry, and then gave me a fruit plate, but half of the fruit was rotten. I complained to her again and there was another one in room 2619. Big used towel, She gave me two more breakfasts, but I didn't eat them because I wouldn't get up early for breakfast.

Overall, Foshan Courtyard is really the best in the industry among five-star hotels. The software and hardware are unparalleled. No matter the lobby staff or cleaning staff, they are all substandard. They are similar to 2 or 3-star hotels. They charge At this price, there are many better hotels than theirs in Foshan, and they are even cheaper.

If you want to experience an unimaginable five-star hotel experience, Foshan Courtyard is your inevitable choice.

If you want to experience a super annoying experience, you must find Amada Li to check in!

To be honest, the lobby manager Zoe Yan is okay, at least she understands a little bit about the world.

P.S It turns out that it is not easy to complain. Even when I asked for an employee‚Äôs name, I was given a foreign name after many twists and turns. When asked for their Chinese name, they said that it was not convenient to tell me due to privacy reasons, and they could not even give me their Chinese name. I still think that all the foreigners in other places are foreigners. Don‚Äôt the Chinese all have Chinese names? Why are they all giving me English names? What do they want to pretend to be? ? ? ?

Service: The service is very good. Basically, the response is very fast when calling to provide baby necessities

Location: The location is also very convenient. There is a small park behind the lobby (opposite McDonald's), where the baby can play for half a day. It is about a 5-minute walk from Qiandeng Lake Park, just in time to see the bald cypress. You can also walk to Denghu West Street for dinner in the evening.

The National Day is coming soon. If you are still hesitating about where to go for a short vacation around Guangzhou, of course I would definitely say Foshan, near Qiandeng Lake. The geographical environment is convenient, and there are all kinds of delicious food, fun, and the super large Qiandeng Lake Night Market nearby. In Qiandeng Lake Park, you can enjoy hundreds of different snacks while shopping.
You can also go shopping nearby, such as Nanfeng Ancient Stove, Ancestral Temple, Lingnan Tiandi, Daguan Museum, Foshan Lingnan Financial Museum, etc.

So I think Foshan Courtyard is really cost-effective~

It‚Äôs only a thousand yuan, but it has an excellent appearance and a cost-effective interior. The lady who checked in also upgraded me to a room with comfortable bedding and a clean and refreshing style. The balcony faces the beautiful Qiandeng Lake, which can be seen as soon as I look up. Bustling and lively. It‚Äôs really great to take parents and children on vacation~

If you come to Foshan for travel, I highly recommend this hotel! !

The service attitude of the hotel is very good. The staff were warm and considerate, making me feel their professionalism and enthusiasm. They responded proactively to solve my problems and made me feel at home.
The surrounding environment here is also very good. The transportation is very convenient, and taking a taxi is also very convenient.

The surrounding facilities are also very complete, including hospitals, supermarkets, banks, etc., which is very convenient.
Overall, I am very satisfied with the room facilities, dining experience, service attitude and surrounding environment.

There are several special Cantonese restaurants downstairs, there is a bar street and McDonald's in the south garden, and there is Gloria Coffee in front of the Marriott. Right next to Qiandeng Lake, the scenery is great. There are also large shopping malls and financial museums within a few minutes' walk. Within 30 minutes from Foshan Airport and West High-speed Railway Station. 10 minutes away by subway.

There were many rooms available on the night of check-in. The buffet breakfast in the swimming pool, gym and elevator room can prove that there were very few guests that day. However, there were not many guests. There is no upgrade. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a hotel problem or a problem with your platform. You don‚Äôt need to put this offer out in the future to avoid a psychological gap. There were so many vacancies, so I was assigned a room closest to the road. It was extremely noisy at night, with many large trucks passing by, so I didn't sleep well all night. The room was not fully equipped, and I had to make multiple phone calls to find everything. There were no bathroom mats, no trash cans in the bathroom, and no free drinks included in the package.

The location is great and the attitude of the service staff is okay. It is to be expected that there will be many people during the Spring Festival. When there are more people, the service will be poor, which is very inappropriate.

Compared with the same brand Marriott, the staff are not well trained and do not know how to provide customers with professional services and considerate stay experience. I stayed for 4 days and every day I felt uncomfortable and itchy from the sheets. And the breakfast is really unpalatable. It doesn‚Äôt even provide basic yogurt, just pure milk and large vats of soy milk. If I could, I would not choose or recommend this hotel in Foshan next time. In terms of health services and front desk check-in, there are only 2 counters with 2 people. The other 2 counters are just decorations. No matter how many dozens of customers are queuing in the lobby, they are indifferent at all. It affected the slow and leisurely check-in. Two staff members were serving dozens of customers in the lobby during the Chinese New Year. The management was so aloof that they didn't know how to come down and take a look? It was agreed that the minibar drinks would be given away, and the refrigerator was emptied. It was funny that a piece of paper was posted saying that the refrigerator was emptied for the convenience of customers. The experience of a five-star hotel that costs more than 1,000 yuan a night is very poor. I hope everyone knows the real experience of staying here.

First of all, the staff outside are very unenthusiastic, and the service attitude of the front desk staff is generally average. At ten o'clock in the morning, I was packing my luggage in the room. A male waiter knocked on the door and said that he was packing clothes for laundry. I did not call for this service. I answered clearly and loudly, no need! There's someone in the room! When he heard me shouting that there was someone in the room, he still took the room card and swiped the door and pushed open the door to come in directly! It was very rude and scared me. It also made me feel strange. Why did I just swipe my room card to come in even though I told someone there was someone there? Fortunately, we were two people in the room at that time, otherwise a girl would be really unsafe and scary. I stayed for two nights in total. It was very inconvenient to order takeout in the room on the first night. I could only put it on the table outside the door. According to the takeaway guy, they would not arrange for a robot to deliver it to my door. I had to go down and get it myself in the middle of the night.

As a result, I went to the super-unforgettable mosquito ü¶ü and made a noise all night. In a serious five-star hotel, there were four mosquitoes infested in one night. It is necessary The children and I packed more than a dozen bags... I went to the counter to mention this in the morning, and the reaction was not very satisfactory. I said that I would help upgrade the room and concierge fruit next time. I think what I want is not this humble passive compensation, but a service attitude that a five-star should have. You make me feel that it is not a big deal for you to find mosquitoes infested. If today‚Äôs reflection is not sincere, I would like to say more words You will not get the approval of the guests before you choose to come back to stay. How can you talk about upgrading and providing fruits later? I can't sleep well at night, and I don't want to spend more effort to have a conversation with you on the spot. This is a kind of disappoin**ent. If you use the new opening as an excuse, you will lose the height and attitude that a five-star hotel should have. We should wait until we are ready before opening the door for everyone to come and consume! Instead of spending money to endorse your promotion, it will only get worse and worse...

msg:The most speechless part of the conversation was with the so-called duty managerüíÅüèª‚ôÄÔ∏è
Ps: I rarely write such long negative reviews because I am so angry! ! ! !

Regarding the negotiation issue of not having breakfast, the response given to me is that the hotel closes the stalls so early. The hotel and the catering depar**ent are not the same depar**ent. I can't help you solve it if you are hungry. That is the catering depar**ent's business and I have no right. (Then what‚Äôs the point of being a manager? üôÑÔ∏è)
‚ö†Ô∏èSolutions given to me: 1. Give me breakfast next time, but it can only be given after checking in (I have already expressed my dissatisfaction with their hygiene, front desk, etc.), so I have to stay one night if I am not happy. Make up for my breakfast? 2. He helped me delay my check-out. I said I had redeemed it with 200 points, and he said that I could ask Ctrip to cancel it. He helped me delay my check-out (Ctrip has already checked in and redeemed it. How can I refund it? And I used the difference of more than 100 yuan to increase the price. I asked you for two breakfasts just because I was hungry)
‚ö†Ô∏èFeedback about the poor attitude of the front desk. He said that both Courtyard and Marriott are under unified management and are in the same building, just with different floors. (So ‚Äã‚ÄãMarriott‚Äôs service should not be much better)
ü´§In general, I did lose more than 100 yuan. Not only that, I couldn't sleep well, but also got a rash. The hotel didn't do anything to ease my mood. It was just shirking responsibility and called me. Think about it. At that time, the problem of eating breakfast was just hoping to solve my hunger. I thought it would be good if they could cook me a simple meal at the price of my breakfast. All the staff have no training and no empathy experience. They have stayed in at least a dozen Marriott hotels. I have never encountered such a situation where complaining will make you even more unhappy.

Front desk: The attitude is cold and arrogant. None of them have received professional training. The guests have to be more enthusiastic than her. A lot of things need to be asked and answered. Remember to tell Ctrip when using points to redeem late check-out, otherwise they won‚Äôt ask you if you need it, and will also ask you what extension you want? What time is it? I don‚Äôt know if their hotel can delay the delay until night.

Breakfast: 6.-10., the earliest among the Marriotts in the world. I spent money to buy a room with two breakfasts. I didn‚Äôt sleep well last night (the reason will be explained later) and I didn‚Äôt have enough time to have breakfast. I tried to negotiate with the hotel, but they didn‚Äôt agree.

Bathroom water: There is only one mode for the shower, which is a relatively large-scale one, and the rest are all partial flush modes. The water pressure is low. Whether it is a shower or a faucet, the water does not have that comfortable feeling.

Deposit: You have to collect 1,200 when you arrive. I tried using Alipay more than three times but it didn‚Äôt work. The front desk didn‚Äôt show any embarrassment and just said in a dumb way whether WeChat would work.

The reason why I couldn‚Äôt sleep well: Although it was a new hotel, I didn‚Äôt know why after sleeping, the exposed areas of my pajamas became red and itchy. The decoration smells very strong and can sting your throat. Those who are sensitive must not try it easily! The balcony door cannot be opened and there is no way to ventilate it! It can only be absorbed once by one guest in one room! The air conditioner was hot and cold, so I didn't sleep well all night.

Decoration: Very ordinary, hollow plywood, and the decorative materials used are very poor to the naked eye.
