Also, the staff from the main entrance are very helpful and thoughtful.  The staff noticed that we have booked  a car and  asked us to relax at the lobby, he will pay attention to the vehicle no and let us know once it arrived.

My room on the 94th floor is very spacious, especially the bathroom and shower room, which are very comfortable and luxurious. The floor-to-ceiling windows offer a beautiful view. The bar on the 99th floor is a great place to enjoy the night view with a glass of alcoholic beverage by the window. The swimming pool and jacuzzi on the 69th floor are impressive; it's my first time swimming at such a high level, giving me a sensation of swimming above the clouds. Breakfast is a must-try on the 72nd floor, with a wide selection of delicious dishes and nice morning sunrise. This hotel is worth coming back to for another stay.

Afternoon tea was great and so was the view.
The Tian bar was small and busy but the drinks were pretty good.
The room was pretty nice, very large and well worth the cost. Only downside is that it's a few years behind other modern hotels, but I wouldn't call it dated yet.
American Breakfast was a bit bland, but decent overall. 
Cantonese breakfast was mediocre, however when we told the staff, they brought us some fresh fruit as apology. Like I said before, great service.

msg:Apart from the noisy lobby, leaking room and unclean teapot, have to mention the unforgettable experience in Catch.
At the time of booking, quite happy to know there was not many reservations in the same night, and different seats could be arranged. However, I was informed by the restaurant, it is a must to purchase set menu*2 to have the Guangzhou scenic spot seat, and at least one person set menu should be purchased for the location of the lobby. 

When I asked if the amount of a la carte can be reached up to 2 set menu for scenic spot seat, it was refused by restaurant and the lady insisted a set menu is required, and saying there is not much options for food and would send me menu by wechat for reference, but not received. The whole reservation process was cold and not unfriendly, and I felt that lady is tired of talking, no hospitality at all. 

A good point is the restaurant asked about the purpose of visit. (from my simple point of view, I would expect something at this moment) When I arrived at the restaurant, yes, they prepared a post card on the table, and that is all. No care, no blessing, only a cold card. I would suggest they better not to ask. Close the mouth. When talks about the mouth, I have already made reservation and gave my room number, it might be still difficult for them to know my name. A robot can be the same thing, do you have reservation?

Taste is below expectation and the quality has also dropped. It seems the chef is not the same person I ate before and the taste and quality have been taken away. The oysters was great, it like the one I purchased from public grocery store with 9.9 CNY each. Suppose to have the dish one by one, but the sever served two dishes at the same time (place on the table without asking) what happens is food gets cold. 

The lobster soup is not warm enough and it tastes fishy, the cod has no taste, and the beef is also ordinary. During the whole dinner, you can hear other guests looking for servers from a low volume to a high volume. Cannot imagine, a server can not be found in a long period of time in a five star hotel restaurant, and you can easily tell that server

This time we tried ordering breakfast from room service (tried both Continental and American breakfast) and it was worth the price. Room service breakfast was available until 11:30 am, and easy to order through the iPad in the room.

All in all a great experience, would stay here just for the amazing views from the lobby and rooms. City view rooms aren't bad either, although if this is your first time in Guangzhou, I would recommend the amazing river view. Will definitely stay here again in the future!

msg:My partner and I had a fantastic stay at the Four Seasons Guangzhou over the Easter weekend. Before checking into the hotel for our stay, I met with Carmen, the manager, who is very professional, and Shigar and Wudy from the Guest Experience team to assist me with arranging flowers, balloons, sparkling wine, etc., for our romantic staycation. I could also view several rooms to get the view and layout I wanted for my stay, opting for a ‚ÄòDeluxe King Suite River View,‚Äô which was excellent.  Gary in the Mondo restaurant reserved us the best table for our lunch, breakfast, and lunch again over the two days we stayed at the hotel, and the service from him and his team was impeccable. On my next visit, I would request to speak with Carmen, Shigar, or Wudy to get the best experience and recommend anyone to visit the Four Seasons Guangzhou, which Forbes verifies as one of the finest properties in the world.

msg:The hotel industry in Guangzhou has a special place in my mind. I always find the hotels in Guangzhou the best in China, and it is only in this city we can experience the fullest of many brands. Therefore, I tend to wait and not to conclude that a particular brand is upsetting no matter how unpleasant my experience is in their properties. Instead, I am more inclined to assume that they are merely problems in that particular hotel in that particular city; nothing to do with the brand overall. I believe that I can only have a reasonable conclusion on a specific brand after experiencing its fullest charm, which is nearly always to be found in Guangzhou. Therefore, I was very eager to explore the Four Seasons hotel in Guangzhou. I have long heard of the big name of Four Seasons, with some experienced hoteliers even rating it to be the finest brand on earth. However, I always struggled to understand how it earns such fame, having visited its properties in Macau and Shenzhen. Because of this, I scheduled my visit to Four Seasons Guangzhou to find an answer, and I could indeed find an answer.
	"Unlike other top hotel brands, the rooms in Four Seasons are particularly warm and homey", said one of my favorite hotel KOLs. I initially could not understand how that could be: if a hotel is like my home, doesn't it mean the hotel is so ordinary and, to some extent, coarse? I believe what makes a hotel different from our ordinary home is the sense of refreshment. Therefore, I had always been puzzled why my favorite KOL loves Four Seasons so much, given how "homey" it is. It is only after visiting Four Seasons Guangzhou I realize why. The sense of home in a truly Four-Seasons Four Seasons hotel is different from that in our ordinary home. It does not fancy any particular interior design style (if we do not regard this lack of style as a style) or any obvious design theme. All the details are so ordinary to the extent that they are common in our home. However, when all these commonly found elements come together, they form a unique sense of refreshment, calm, peacefulness, mind-openness, and coziness that are not common. Furthermore, perhaps thanks to the many ordinary elements, the room, despite being filled with all the qualities described above, looks so friendly and warm. This is precisely why Four Seasons is so special: all the details that cannot be more ordinary come together and trigger a chemical reaction that generates a vibe that cannot be more special. It is so familiar, but refreshing; so ordinary, but never boring; so adorable, but never pressurizing. This interior design masterpiece is perhaps only to be found in Four Seasons. Everything is at a perfect balancing point; a little bit more or less would ruin that entire vibe. Four Seasons can skillfully maintain itself just at that point, which is an achievement to be proud of.
	I find the services at Four Seasons Guangzhou very fine as well. I want to thank Yellow and Neil in particular, the two gentlemen who helped me with my check-in. As mentioned in my review about White Swan Hotel in Guangzhou, I find there a dilemma for most front-operation hoteliers in East Asia. If they behave so softly, many people may find them so girly (which is fine for me but not for the people under the strong influence of traditional East Asian gender stereotypes). Meanwhile, if they behave so firmly, many people may easily find them rude. Therefore, it is always challenging to be an exceptional male front-operation hotelier in East Asia. However, both Yellow and Neil manage to find the very right balance. They are gentle but not girly; confident and helpful but not rude. Therefore, please continue to stay in the industry to help us train more amazing male hoteliers like you, Yellow and Neil!

This trip to Guangzhou, I chose the Four Seasons Hotel. The pending issues communicated in advance were all resolved at the front desk and I was very satisfied.
It is not as old as the bad reviews! The hotel front desk is on the 70th floor, and the lobby is a beautiful check-in area! The front desk is enthusiastic, and the hotel staff greets them politely. The room window is a floor-to-ceiling window. Although it is cloudy, the view is still beautiful! The room is well furnished and the supplies are very complete, including teapots, tea leaves, coffee machines, coffee capsules, purified water, and everything else!
You can walk to the food street in a few minutes, and see the small waist at night in the square!
Next time I go to Guangzhou, I will choose to stay at the Four Seasons as always!
It‚Äôs just that there are not many choices for the buffet breakfast, but the service is also very good!

However, we encountered an incident when we checked in. The hotel manager handled the matter with sincerity, efficiency and comfortable service. He communicated the matter with us repeatedly and solved it in time!

‚ùóÔ∏èName and criticize the lady Stacie at the front desk‚ùóÔ∏èThe service attitude is extremely poor, she has a bad face, she is unwilling, and she does not pay attention to the needs of the guests at all. She does not have any polite words and gives people the feeling: Don‚Äôt bother me. What kind of hotel does it feel like to stay in! The tone is extremely impatient! No sense of responsibility or professional ethics at all!

Why am I so angry? Because my husband was unwell when checking in. When the front desk was very leisurely, I waited for her to work for a while. When I felt about the same, I said, "Please check in as soon as possible. We want to return to the room as soon as possible." Stacie, the front desk clerk, lowered her head and raised her eyes, looked at me slowly and impatiently and said, "Didn't you see what I was doing?!"...and so on!

He was completely indifferent to the customer's situation at the time, and acted rudely throughout the whole process, as if he owed her eighteen million!

‚ùåWork flow chaos! Service awareness 0Ô∏è‚É£ points! Communication skills are amazingüî•!

If you don't want to work, you don't have to work, but you shouldn't convey your emotions to the guests. This negative review must be given to Stacie at the front desk!

I hope the hotel will strengthen its management and we will continue to stay in the hotel in the future!

I have always stayed at Star Diamond top luxury and ultra-luxury hotels, and this is the first time I encountered such a front desk! I have never encountered such a bad behavior from a hotel person! Extremely bad!

He learned that it was our first time staying at Four Seasons, so he upgraded us to a tower view room for free. The view was very good, the room was large and clean, and he also gave my daughter a room card with a Yangcheng doll, which you can take away when you leave the hotel. Very thoughtful. The buffet breakfast on the 72nd floor in the morning was also very good. Although the variety was not particularly large, the quality was very good. I was very satisfied with both the service and the room this time, and I will stay here again if I have the chance.

After comparing so many five-star hotels in Guangzhou, the service attitude of the Ji Hotel is obviously better than other hotels, and the environment and various facilities are also very good. Especially Hedy and Eva, their attitude is very good and their responses are very timely. Thank you very much!

But I think it's very good!
Compared to Four Seasons in other cities,
I think Guangzhou's is particularly good.
The room is also very clean, the service is very attentive, and the details are very good.
I like it very much! It has greatly increased my favorability towards Four Seasons.
The only downside is that I found some strange hair in the hand towel, and it's not short! I hope that management can be strengthened and hygiene inspections can be supervised.

msg:In order to see the little waist, I booked a premium tower view room, which is a good area of ‚Äã‚Äã70 square meters. The floor given is 74, the lowest floor of the most expensive tower view. I was told that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe high floors would be smaller. The guest relations eva added WeChat in advance to reserve it. I was still satisfied after checking in. The overall service is satisfactory, especially a staff member in the lobby (I didn‚Äôt see the name tag clearly). While we were waiting for the room, he was chatting and playing with the children. Every time he passed the lobby, he would greet the children. Thank you~ I will stay here next time! But the staff at the afternoon tea on the 70th floor was very unwelcoming to us! Since we had to wait for the room, we planned to sit down and order something to eat. After the children came in, they sat on the sofa for a while, but they didn‚Äôt sit down. The people were still on the sofa, and she directly arranged the pillows. It felt like they were messing up and driving the guests away, which made people very uncomfortable! ! Go to sit on the sofa for a while, and we are arranging it, don‚Äôt mess it up. Go to the seat by the window and stop it immediately. Don‚Äôt touch it! Since it is so unwelcome, why not write that children are not allowed to enter!

Facilities: It‚Äôs so funny that we actually changed 3 rooms this time! Either the showerhead or there is something wrong with the showerhead!

Service: Even if you can't upgrade for free when you check in, more than 900 upgraded rooms have been added. Given the lowest floor, why can those who get free upgrades still live on high floors?

If you bring children out to play, I highly recommend staying at Four Seasons. The Provincial Museum is a four or five-minute walk away, and you can see the Guangzhou Tower from the hotel. It is close to everything.
Needless to say, the service is very humane. Eva is very considerate. A better hotel needs more warm service. Prepare the children's toiletries in advance, and the children's room card is also very cute. Also! The toiletries of Fumar smell good! I will stay here next time~

msg:As a five-star hotel, it is OK. As a top five-star hotel, it needs to work harder. Here are some details that are not user-friendly.
1. There are a few waiters at the door, and the hotel entrance is relatively small, but the service is still enthusiastic. 1F is quite depressing. You have to go to the overhead lobby on 70F to feel comfortable. There are no chairs next to the elevator on 1F, and the entrance chairs are too small. The number of elevators from 1 to 70F was too small when they were built. The elevators are a bit slow, and you have to wait for a few minutes every time.
2. The distinguished tower view room 9308 I stayed in is indeed quiet and smoke-free, but due to the geographical environment, I can't see anything outside the window on cloudy days, rain and fog, and I can only see half of K11. On sunny days, the sofa, coffee table, TV cabinet and bed are facing the east K11, so close that you can say hello to the opposite K11. The desk faces the river in the southeast, and the bathroom on the right has a little privacy and faces the tower in the south. In fact, it should be called a half-tower view room. Fortunately, the aromatherapy smell is comfortable.
3. Bath products, such as shower gel and shampoo, all have the same smell, which is too feminine and too strong. I don't like it very much. I hope to change it, it's really not as good as aromatherapy. 4 toothbrushes are prepared, which is good, but I hope that bath towels, bathrobes and other linens can be prepared in the same way. It doesn't seem appropriate to call the service to deliver them halfway through washing.
4. The dressing room only has a partition on the top, a few small drawers, too few hangers, and no wardrobe, so the clothes can't be put in. There is only one safe, and it's so small.
5. There are only trash cans on the desk and the sink, and they are so small. There are no trash cans on the bar, sofa, coffee table, and toilet. I don't like to call service frequently when it's full. I don't like to litter, it's not elegant. I hope that trash cans can be everywhere like mineral water, otherwise where can I throw it after drinking?
6. There is no dirty clothes basket in the bathroom. Used bath towels and bathrobes are either thrown under the sink and put together with fresh ones (or find a place to put the fresh ones yourself), but there are no empty hooks or racks in the bathroom. Towel racks are only on the sink and door handles.
7. There is not a single socket in the entire bathroom. The nearest one is outside the bathroom door, but the hair dryer cord is too short. You can't stand in front of the mirror wall by the bed or the mirror on the sink when you plug it in. You either close the bathroom door and leave a gap to use the bathroom door as a mirror, which is stupid. The hair dryer rack does not have wheels and is not placed by the door. You have to move it yourself to put the used hair dryer or the glass desk. I'm really afraid that the glass will explode due to heat.
8. There is only one makeup magnifying mirror in the bathroom, so why did you design a double tray? It's still very small, and I can't see my whole face clearly because my face is big.
9. There are no chairs in the bathroom or at the bar. Except for the sofa, desk chair, shoe-changing chair in the dressing room, and bed, there is nothing else to sit on.
10. The desk chair is relatively old, and it is black even after being wiped with paper towels. I don't have time to experience the spa, swimming pool, and gym, so I won't comment. But the paint of the bathtub in the room is cracked, and it doesn't feel very clean when it is filled with water for the first time. There is no disposable bathtub cover and bath salt bath milk. The ceiling of the bathroom seems to be wall paint, and it feels like it has been soaked in water. The coffee machine is not cleaned very well. There is no water filter. The kettle uses mineral water but the mineral water is in a small paper box. It makes my hands sore when I open it. There is no straw. I am worried about glue residue. I can only pour it out to drink. But there are too few cups. There are only glass water cups, beverage mugs, coffee cups and tea cups, and the first two are not big enough.
11. The lights in every place in the room are too yellow and too dim. It is inconvenient to find things. You can not turn it on, but you can't not decorate it. Especially criticize the shower area, dressing partition and desk.
12. It is not electric curtains and electric heated table mirrors. The refrigerator is too small and the cooling is too poor. There are too many charged alcoholic drinks in it, which take up space. I can only move it out and freeze it before checking out. If I don't move it out, there will be no place to put some chocolate. The coffee machine knows to plug in the power supply, but the kettle has to be plugged in manually. The sockets don't have their own switches.
13. There are many kinds of fruits on the coffee table, which are fresh, but the quality is not good enough, just like what you would buy in a four-star hotel. The nougat is the worst I've ever tasted, with no milk or peanut flavor, the packaging is hard to tear, the rice paper is fragile, the candy is crispy but the texture and cross-section when broken are not as crisp as biscuits, it's like breaking plastic.
The tea and capsule coffee are average, no special features, no fragrance, but at least not bad or inferior.
14. There is no chair at the foot of the bed, the space and number of chairs in the dressing room are as mentioned above, the pillow is comfortable but too big, and when booking the room, I asked for extra pillows, but there are still no small pillows of various sizes. If you don't need a big pillow, you can only throw it on the sofa in the middle of the night, but it's not easy to get it back on the bed when you need it.
15. The restaurant service is good, the taste is just like the picture for reference only, the main price is a few hundred or a thousand yuan just to fill up. The menu for ordering and delivering to the room is different, it won't deliver good things to your room, you can only eat in the restaurant, since I'm going out, I might as well order takeout. In addition, the buffet breakfast on the second day was criticized. The system was criticized. We were rushing to catch the high-speed train. The same price was given, but we were asked to pack up and eat on the way. It was not that we could not eat it on the spot and had to take it away. They said that we could only pack up a few specific types of bread, and other things could not be packed. Were they afraid that people would lose money if they took too much or that they would blame you if they got sick?
16. We criticized by name. When we went out and met the US Treasury Secretary visiting China, we stayed here. The motorcade directly occupied the circular lane at the main entrance. Didi could not enter. No road was left for other guests' cars. I don't know how to coordinate. The hotel did not do anything. On rainy days, we could only go to the roadside to get Didi in the rain. The waiter at the door took the initiative to register the room number and lent me an umbrella. Good review. But the umbrella was too small and leaked rain. Bad review. When I came back, I had to delay the check-out and took a shower.

- The hotel's location is very convenient, allowing guests to easily access various attractions or business districts.
- The hotel lobby design leaves a lasting impression.

- The food provided for breakfast is very delicious, allowing guests to enjoy a sumptuous breakfast experience.
- The hotel staff are warm and friendly, providing excellent service and making guests feel respected and cared for.

shortcoming:
- The price dropped by several hundred dollars a day after I made the reservation, which may displease price-conscious guests. But you can ask customer service to refund the difference in trip coins.

- The audio and video input panel in the room booked through this platform was broken, but the same device worked normally in the room I booked two days ago (through a mainland booking platform). This could be due to differences in facility levels between room types, differences in room quality due to different booking platforms, or just my luck. . .

As a result, the buttons and cabinet doors cannot be found for the first time. Not to mention the furniture, it is first-rate and comfortable, but there are too few trash cans in the room. I don‚Äôt know if it is intentional design or if I forgot to put them...

Cleanliness: Spotless, the bedrooms and study are all carpeted, they look and feel clean. The tub will definitely need to be scrubbed again before use.

Service: Top-notch hotels have waiters who appear quickly when needed and speak softly and with low decibels. Breakfast includes Chinese and Western styles. The Western breakfast includes Middle Eastern food, as well as local Guangzhou morning tea snacks. The shrimp dumplings are probably not a pre-made dish, certified by locals because they cannot be so ugly, but you can feel the sincerity.

Personal: I like the perfume of the bath brand very much. I bought it in the gift shop when I checked out, and also bought a vase.

I had a bit of a cold this time, so I didn‚Äôt go to the sky bar or swimming pool. I look forward to next time.

It‚Äôs a long way from the Xinghai Concert Hall. Before I even left, I received a call from the hotel‚Äôs guest housekeeper, Miss Carrie. She is very concerned about the guests' requirements, preferences, and travel schedule. It turns out that this is also the case. She is like your family. She has been helping to communicate and coordinate various details during your stayüíóFrom the moment you arrive, I feel the most professional services in the hotel. The skyscraper of the hotel is full of technology and so cool. The lady at the front desk specially arranged the 95th floor. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. It is clean, comfortable and high-end. There is a special laundry specially prepared for children. The personal care products are really great. The room is very large. Opposite is the Canton Tower. You can overlook the beautiful scenery of the city and the Pearl River. You can relax your eyes and get a moment of tranquility in your body and mind. Whenever you need something, you can get the best solution at any time. Quick response, the air is filled with the smell of aroma, the breakfast on the 72nd floor is also very good, take a stroll around the hotel corridor, every employee passing by smiles, the quality is very good, and Ivan and others Colleagues, this is something I have rarely encountered in recent years. I am super happy. My son has to go to school, so my stay is relatively short. I didn‚Äôt experience the signature spa. I haven‚Äôt had time to try more of Guangzhou‚Äôs delicacies. Haha, I will try it next time I come to Guangzhou. The Four Seasons is definitely my first choice, thank you, the beautiful memories here are worth revisiting!

msg:The Four Seasons Hotel is located in the west tower of Huacheng Plaza, echoing the Chow Tai Fook Center. It has a triangular plan layout, which can maximize the view of Guangzhou. The view rooms on the west side are unobstructed. The lobby is on the 70th floor of the hotel, and the cloister atrium is a famous check-in point.

Did you check it out before you checked in, which directly led to why you were anxious for a minute after you checked in to find the key to open the curtainsüòÇOkay, manual gauze curtains and sunshades may also be regarded as a major feature of the hotelüòùThe room service is always in place. Room cleaning at night is a highlightü•∞The bathroom toiletry set is made of wood to look more natural.

There is a resident singer in the sky bar on the 98th floor. When checking in, the front desk will give a warm reminder that if you need to go to bed early, it may be affected. Friends who fall asleep after 0 o'clock every day can ignore it.

This itinerary is a bit full, so I don‚Äôt have a chance to experience the hotel restaurant. It feels good to have a friend make an appoin**ent to try it. I will go there next time if I have a chanceüòç

The check-in experience is very good. What is better than the facilities is the service of the Four Seasons. The little girl icy when checking in left a deep impression on Clark on the executive floor. The room attendants I met in the corridor also took the initiative to say hello.

Dyson TOTO electric toilets are available. I like the smell of soap. The hotel is very environmentally friendly. The room card is made of wood. The razors and toothbrushes are also made of wood. The water bottles are not made of plastic, which is great.

The only drawback is that the swimming pool is a bit small.

msg:During the Spring Festival holiday, hotel room prices in Guangzhou soar, usually doubling or even 1.5 times, and the Four Seasons is no exception. It costs 3,500+ per night. Thinking of Guangzhou‚Äôs popular tourist destinations during the holiday, it‚Äôs more expensive. I‚Äôll enjoy the service and environment of the Four Seasons Hotel. Entering the lobby on the 70th floor, you can see that the lobby is full of people. Fortunately, the staff in the crowd will take the initiative to greet you when they see you looking around. When I checked in, the front desk asked me to arrange a high-floor room with a river view. However, it would be noisy because there was a bar upstairs. The bar was open until one o'clock in the morning. I thought I would sleep late if I went out to play, so 1 a.m. in the morning was still acceptable. Unexpectedly, the nigh**are started at one o'clock in the morning, the bar ended on time, and the music was changed to the sound of moving tables and chairs and cleaning. The noise continued until 2 o'clock, waking me up from my sleep several times. How infuriating it is to spend a lot of money to stay in a hotel and not even be able to get a full night's sleep. The first negotiation was fruitless, and the second negotiation was quiet, but at this time I was completely sleepless. So I would like to remind everyone that on the 98th floor of Lightning Protection, the bar upstairs does not stop when it closes. I would also like to give a suggestion to the Four Seasons Hotel. Why don‚Äôt you arrange a daytime room on the 98th floor? Don‚Äôt harm the guests anymore. Compared with the so-called scenery, the most important thing when staying in a hotel is to sleep well. Due to my schedule for the next day, the hotel gave me an extended check-out, but I didn't use it. I left Four Seasons exhausted and disappointed. I will never stay at this hotel again.

How can I put it, I think it is very abstract, and I am really not as good as MO in this aspect, but of course, If you have a request, they basically give you whatever you ask for (they just won‚Äôt take the initiative to serve you)

The mattress is comfortable, but if you don't ask, the sheets will be changed every four days (I didn't stay for four days, but it said so on the service card).

Very polite and takes care of customer needs. Like it very much. It may not be the best hotel I've encountered in every aspect, but it has a very high overall score. Maybe I am someone who has too much affection for Canton Tower and Guangzhou Grand Theatre. The beauty of the four seasons lies in the fact that they moisturize things silently. I really disliked it at first, but after staying there, it should be my favorite hotel. Nothing but feelings, waking up to the scenery of Canton Tower and the Pearl River in the early morning fog, and the warmth of my heart when I return from a concert at night. The room design, including the bathroom design, is low-key, luxurious and stunning. We are just not good at publicizing it at Four Seasons, hhh. After so many years, there has been such a strong opponent as Rosewood, but Four Seasons still stands and its price has not been lowered. Experienced both during this trip. Four Seasons is a true design hotel, a true architectural work, and a true global established chain. The service level is extremely high and cannot be easily compared. Finally, I would like to thank the concierge Hedy, the housekeeping depar**ent Blue, and the Lobby Ambassador Xiaolong who is also very cute.

Most of the service staff are very considerate and pay attention to details. For example, when cleaning the room, they will give it to me if they see that I have brought a book. Two bookmarks.
At the same time, there are some details about hygiene that I hope can be improved:
1. Although the first room was non-smoking when I checked in, the previous guest was obviously smoking. The smell of smoke was so strong that I felt nauseated. Fortunately, the front desk quickly helped me change rooms. I hope that the hotel can deal with this situation in time in the future. No matter how light the smoke smell is, it will be obvious and cause trouble to friends who have no smoking habit;
2. Someone left a used band-aid on a chair in the hot lounge of the locker room. Although the locker room staff may be busy and cannot find it in time, there is a high probability that the band-aid that has come into contact with the wound is left on. It was really unhygienic to touch her skin, so I went out without using the rest room.
3. The towels on the chairs next to the swimming pool didn't seem to be changed in time. I wiped them dry after swimming and wanted to lie down and take a rest, but I tried two chairs and they were still wet, so I left directly.
These three points are all small but very affecting the experience. I hope they can be improved.

The highlight is swimming. There is music playing at the bottom of the swimming pool, which can be heard even when you sink (similar to bone conduction?). When the sun shines on the mosaic tiles, you can watch the changes in color while swimming. There is a sauna where you can steam after swimming, and there is also a waiting room for guests (differentiated between men and women), which is great for couples or couples who swim together.

      The hotel's aromatherapy smells very good and is very friendly to people who are sensitive to odors. Unfortunately, it is not sold to the public for the time being. I hope to have the opportunity to take the beautiful scent home next time.

(Piano improvisation too!!‚ù§Ô∏è
While queuing to check in, I saw hotel staff maintaining order to avoid problems.
That skillful service is really good

Because the staff took me to the guest room, they explained the equipment application very carefully.
I called for indoor service in the evening and the cake was delicious. I highly recommend it! !

The design of Four Seasons in Guangzhou tends to be luxurious, which is different from the Four Seasons in other places.
The floors are also very high, and the highest 100th floor is a Western restaurant (with private rooms!)

All in all, I received a lot of kindness there
I had insomnia at night and asked room service. They were very helpful in preparing aromatherapy for meü´®ü´®‚ù§Ô∏è

The welcome fruit turned out to be three oranges. The next day I saw that the welcome fruit for other guests turned out to be a fruit plate. They were treated so differently. Obviously, it is really hard to describe a hotel of this level. The service staff had no sense of service and was trapped in the elevator. After pressing the alarm several times, no one came. Finally, the people traveling with me yelled before someone came to deal with it. No one apologized during the whole process. Except for the view and scenery, I can't find any other advantages and will never stay here again.

Facilities: very satisfied
Health: OK
Environment: OK
Service: To be honest, I really want to give it a perfect score!
Meal: The soup and vegetable soup were both good but not drinkable; the fried salmon was quite good, the staple food was good, and the bread was delicious, but this type of bread was a bit hard, and I don‚Äôt have good teeth. I specially ordered Italian balsamic vinegar and olive oil for breakfast bread dipping. I personally think this combination is better than butter ‡πë‰πõv‰πõ‡πë
I ordered room service for all three meals. The service was very attentive. They learned that I had a bad stomach and even gave me some fruits. Hahahahaha. Keep it up.
A very pleasant experience, see you next time at Four Seasons Hotel!

I would like to commend Jemma from the executive lounge and Eva from the guest relations! ! The service provided by the two of them was really great. They took the initiative to contact us the day before check-in, and made corresponding recommendations and introductions to our itinerary. The most important thing was that they also helped us upgrade our room! We also followed up throughout the entire stay! I feel very much at home. I will stay at Four Seasons next time I come to Guangzhou!
Environment: The environment is also very good. Although I live in a river view suite, I can still see my slim waist! ! It‚Äôs just that I watched the concert too late in the evening, and the lights on my waist were no longer on. It‚Äôs a pity hahaha
Facilities: The facilities are very well maintained. In fact, I was a little worried before moving in, haha, but it doesn't look like it has been open for ten years! ! The facilities are very well maintained.
Hygiene: The indoor hygiene was very clean, and the service staff also laid foot mats on the bedside and bathroom in advance to prevent slipping. Knowing that they were coming back from the concert at night, they also took the initiative to make the bed, which was very convenient. intimate! But the only thing is that the glass outside the window is indeed a little dirty hahahaha. It doesn't affect the night view at all. It is just a little obvious during the day, but overall it doesn't hinder it!
Overall, I am very satisfied with my stay this time. It is more comfortable than other super five-star hotels. Whether it is the attentive service of Jemma, Eva and other staff, or the hotel's facilities, environment, and scenery. Juejuezi hahaha! I recommend everyone to stay and experience it! ! !
I‚Äôve attached a few pictures, but I‚Äôm really not very good at taking pictures. The real scenes are far better than the photos!

This time I was leaving Guangzhou and wanted to change hotels, so I chose the Four Seasons. I stayed there for three nights. The overall feeling was really amazing and the scenery was amazing. Well, I also like the decoration style. I mainly took photos for real productions. I experienced the romance of French food on the 100th floor. A Chris**as tree was placed early in the lobby on the 70th floor. There were many ladies checking in and taking pictures every day. We wanted to go there at 5 o'clock in the morning. When I go to the airport, the staff in the executive lounge will specially prepare breakfast for me. The service is really considerate and thoughtful. I will come again next time.

You can walk in the nearby CBD and you can see your waist in Huacheng Square. If you book a room with a river view, it should be great. You can see your waist in the restaurant bar on the 70th floor and the bar on the 99th floor. If you stay in a hotel, there is no minimum consumption for the window seat of the bar. The river view is great, but there are many people in the subway station. . The room is very large, with a separate cloakroom, wet and dry bathrooms, a bathtub, and the bed is facing the window. Although it is very high and no one will see it, the hotel cleans the windows from time to time, so the hotel warmly reminds you to close the curtains. The overall service is also very warm and friendly, but the price is expensive, hehe.

msg:Of course you have expectations of a Four Seasons Hotel and these were of course fulfilled here. It is of course impressive to have a hotel on the 84th floor with a sensational view over Guangzhou, whose lobby is on the 70th floor. For us, the "proximity" to the trade fair was important, even if in a city with 18 million inhabitants the word proximity is a relative term. The head concierge Kent Li was great and very helpful. With him we understood the advantages of the city much more quickly. 
However, I have never experienced having to wear a swimming cap in a hotel swimming pool. That is probably part of the "different countries, different customs" rule.

Unfortunately we were not able to fully enjoy all the amenities as we were on a business trip and unfortunately there was not enough time for it. We slept wonderfully in any case. You should also be able to have dinner at Kumoi, even if this obviously has to be rewarded accordingly due to its Michelin award. It was delicious. If I ever have to go to Guangzhou again, I would book the hotel again.

I left the hotel early, but my friend hadn't checked out yet. I went to have breakfast and came back to find that the room had been tidied up, and all the bags and clothes in the room had been cleaned. It has been 6 hours since I reported the problem, and no one has contacted me to explain or apologize. I promised to contact me at three in the afternoon, but I still didn't receive a call at five o'clock. The room itself, breakfast, and the bar on the 99th floor were quite average. Although the floor was high, the glass was dirty and affected the view. When I left the hotel, no one came to help me drag my suitcases into a taxi. I will continue to stay under the Marriott brand in the future. I finally understand why Four Seasons cannot open in Shanghai.

When they checked in at the hotel, Emily at the front desk helped upgrade the room to a river view room. You can see your waist from the room window. After checking in, Jeena ( Ye Zi) pressed the elevator for us and sent us to the room. The room was arranged on the 75th floor. In the evening, we received cards and dolls from sister Jeena to the children. The children were very surprised and loved it! Thank you sister Jeena for your love and blessings! The next day, the children returned the card and met the enthusiastic brother Ivan at the front desk to help pass it on. The children had a great time with brother Ivan and even helped us take pictures. Thank you brother Ivan! Children like to play in the water and go to the swimming pool for a while in the morning and evening. The nearby Guangzhou Library and Huacheng Square Grand Theater are both a few minutes' walk away, so I went shopping there. The whole process was so fun that the children didn‚Äôt want to go home. I will choose Four Seasons again next time. The hotel environment is very high-end and classy, ‚Äã‚Äãand the sanitary details are also very good! The night view outside the window at night is beautiful!

When I found the packing box for cigarette ashes, I put an ashtray and matches for us. You can get the service you need immediately wherever you go, and the quick check-out is also very efficient and considerate. It feels like a completely nanny-style service but it is natural, kind and unpretentious. Become a fan immediately. Before booking, I said I wanted a room facing Canton Tower, and it actually met my needs during the Canton Fair. I will definitely stay at the Four Seasons next time I come here (although when I made the reservation, I wanted to experience the legendary W Hotel, so I arranged to stay at the W later).

msg:The epidemic has not come for a few years, but when I reflect again, it still feels like towering into the clouds, but there is a taller one next to it...
The furnishings and equipment in the room are good. I even helped my sister tidy up her friends when I turned down. The room is on 94F. The inner corridor has a glass partition to block the sound coming from the lobby. The swimming pool comes with mouthwash. It's all very good.
The lounge on 99F is a little cramped, but the food and beverages are OK, but it‚Äôs too good to be considered bad.
The lobby boy in the lobby was a little unfamiliar with administrative courtesy. In the end, he had to show them the conversation between me and the customer service colleagues who contacted me in advance before he swiped my card to lift me to the lounge... Well, by the way, there were envelopes and postcards in the room. It‚Äôs gone. I don‚Äôt know if I forgot to put it in.

msg:When I checked in, there was no concierge to help with luggage, no introduction to hotel facilities, and no welcome fruit. And it took a long time for someone to do it. The foreigner who checked in next to me was given fruit and someone took it to the elevator, which made people feel that they were treated differently. The service is extremely inconsistent with the service of a hotel of this level.
The deluxe river view room is very large, you can see your waist, and the view is quite good. But a corner of the edge of the desk was raised, cutting my son's finger. Also, for such a large floor-to-ceiling window, the curtains are not automatic, which is somewhat inconvenient.
The follow-up room service attitude was good, and the concierge Ivan's attentive service during check-out saved a lot of image points for your hotel.

msg:On October 11, 2023, 10.12, and 10.13, I checked into Four Seasons, Rosewood, and Park Hyatt in sequence. Four Seasons went through Ctrip, Rosewood went through the front desk, and Park Hyatt went through members. Upload the voucher in order to prove that you are not a trustworthy person.

The Four Seasons is a deluxe Canton Tower view suite with executive lounge benefits and a room rate of 4641;
Rosewood is an executive tower view suite with executive lounge benefits, and the room rate is 5690.08;
The Park Hyatt is a Park Hyatt suite. The hotel itself does not have an executive lounge. Since you are a member, this night is free. The price for Ctrip on the day is 3265, and the discounted price for diamond members is 2765;

Let‚Äôs do a horizontal evaluation:

1. Bedding comfort: Magnificent is far ahead, Four Seasons is about the same as Park Hyatt;
2. Sound insulation: Magnificent and Four Seasons are about the same, but Park Hyatt lags far behind. The cleaning noise in the corridor is very loud. When I write this long review, the next door is cleaning, and the sound is loud and outrageous. The sound insulation is even worse than that of Hampton by Hilton. , I was very depressed when I was woken up in the morning last September;
3. Sanitary condition: Rosewood is far ahead, and Four Seasons and Park Hyatt are about the same this time. The premise is that the hygiene condition of Park Hyatt was not good last time. This time the customer service specifically told them to clean it well. If there was no instruction, it should not be as good as Four Seasons;
4. Service attitude: Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, and Rosewood in order;
5. Food: I have eaten breakfast at all three restaurants. I had breakfast at the Park Hyatt in September. I haven‚Äôt used the breakfast on the 14th yet. It‚Äôs all OK and there is no obvious difference;
6. Scenery: Magnificent, Four Seasons can see the Canton Tower, and the Park Hyatt is a city view. However, due to the curved surface, the photos taken by the Four Seasons are not as good as the Magnificent. The outside glass of the Magnificent is cleaner than the Four Seasons, and the perspective is facing the Canton Tower. The room of the Four Seasons this time faces the In the southeast, Canton Tower can be seen from the bathroom, but the viewing angle is relatively biased. The Park Hyatt city view is of course not as good as the tower view. The price is here, but the sunset is beautiful. If you like sunset scenery, it is actually very suitable.

To sum up: Personally speaking, if I am not short of money, I will definitely choose Rosewood. After all, it is new and the service attitude is inferior. I will go back if I am not happy with the money. But considering the cost-effectiveness, I will definitely stay at the Park Hyatt. If it is not a suite, the price is actually the same. The Hilton is almost there, and it‚Äôs totally acceptable for over 1K. If you have to take multiple factors into consideration, the Four Seasons is still the first choice. If you take your parents with you, you‚Äôll live in the Rosewood and the Four Seasons, and I‚Äôll live in the Park Hyatt. That‚Äôs pretty much it.

msg:This stay was much better than last time. Maybe I avoided the peak season, and the front desk fulfilled the hotel manager‚Äôs promise to upgrade the room type when I checked in again, and gave me the room type with the desired view. This service attitude is very good~ Then I was alone At dinner time in the evening, I went to the swimming pool and reserved it for a full 1.5 hours. I left only when I couldn't swim anymore. I didn't expect other guests to come in right away. Haha, the swimming pool staff also chatted with me enthusiastically, so the whole process was quite enjoyable. I'm happy~ Even though it was raining, it didn't affect my mood of viewing the scenery in the room. Taking photos was very photogenic~ The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel room is smaller the higher it is. When choosing a room, you should also pay attention to where the sloping column is on the floor-to-ceiling window of the room. It less blocks the line of sight. You can observe the changes in the position of the sloping columns on different floors in my last enlarged picture of Four Seasons from Rosewood. At the same time, my room has a view of the tower and the city, so I once again like the lady at the front desk. Give me a carefully selected room. I won‚Äôt avoid the Four Seasons when I choose a hotel next time~üòå

I have never encountered such a situation in a hotel of this level. I left the room early in the morning and returned to the room at around 5pm. I didn't clean the room. Then I wanted to take a rest. The housekeeper knocked on the door three times and asked if I could clean it. They said it couldn't be done later than 7pm, otherwise I couldn't clean it. I complained to the front desk manager. I said that because it was during the Canton Fair, the cleaning staff was a little busy, and I was speechless.

msg:There are so many people waiting in line for breakfast Chapter 1 First of all, the semi-buffet breakfast on the 99th floor in the executive suite has few types, so going down to the 72nd floor for public breakfast requires an additional 115 yuan for a single person. After Ctrip helped communicate, I agreed to give up all suite services and facilities. We went down to the 72 restaurant for breakfast. The time we arrived was between 8 and 9 o'clock. There were many people in the restaurant and there were no seats. It was difficult to wait until we were seated. When we opened the steamer, it was all empty. The waiter said to wait for about 15 minutes. Then he came back in 15 minutes and it was all empty again. Secondly, The day before I checked in, I communicated with the hotel about the precautions. After checking in, nothing was prepared. The saddest thing was that I heard the elevator operating very noisy all night. When traveling with children, once the luggage is taken out, it is difficult to pack and change rooms. It is a luxury. Time is precious. The name of the front desk is Dells (there is a mole next to the mouth). I hope you will meet a front desk who misses you when traveling with your children. If you read the notes carefully, you will not hurt the families with children who are about to stay in the future. The day before check-out I went downstairs to the front desk in the evening to communicate with Dells and the front desk said it was not my responsibility. I asked our manager to tell you about it. The manager Stacie came out first and took me to the same room type on the 90th floor to prove to me that the same suite also has this kind of elevator noise. and then said I‚Äôll give you earplugs and a cup of hot milk üòÇ You guys are really good at it

I was torn between Four Seasons, Rosewood, and Park Hyatt for a long time. My children preferred Rosewood because the floor of Rosewood is higher than that of Four Seasons. Considering the price and brand, I still choose Four Seasons! For a deluxe city view room (you can actually see the tower), the front desk also tried its best to meet the needs of children on high floors and arranged it on 94F. The service at Four Seasons is as considerate as ever. The room is very spacious, the dressing room and bathroom area are just right, and the view is beautiful. However, the glass curtain wall is a bit dirty and the filming is not very transparent. Traveling with two children, I called the front desk at two o'clock in the morning to add an extra bed. The guy from the housekeeping depar**ent had the extra bed in place within ten minutes. He also thoughtfully provided children's toiletries for the children. Check-out was extended to 13 o'clock the next day. The trip was very short, and Four Seasons also liked it!

He said that the room had not been cleaned yet and asked us to wait for news from the front desk. We waited and waited. Finally we got the call to let us check in. Well, he went to the front desk and asked us to sit down and wait for a while. He told us that they had a guest. After extending our stay, they told us that there was no room available until 4:20 pm. They asked us if they could lower the floor or wait until the guests had checked out. Isn't this pure deception? This hotel should be called Mo Ling Liang Ke. The lobby of the hotel shocked me greatly. The room price is so expensive and the service is not good. There is also a charge for drinks in the hotel refrigerator. Hahaha

msg:Very disappointed, compared to Guangzhou MO, it is not on the same level.
First of all, check-in. I booked a Tower View Suite. It should be possible to check in at the lounge, but when I asked the staff on the 70th floor, the answer I got was that all check-ins must be done on the 70th floor? ? ? (Later, after communicating with the lounge staff, I learned that it is indeed possible. Can you unify the policy?) The check-in speed is also very abstract. I had made it clear to the staff the day before that I would check in at 3-4 p.m. , but when I arrived, I was forced to stand on the 70th floor for 20 minutes and then asked to wait in the lounge? ? ? We arrived at the hotel at 15:20, but didn‚Äôt get the room card until 16:09! (This was after I urged her. The concierge at the lounge was also very rude and told me directly that I was impatient??? In fact, I just asked because it really took a long time...)

Then there is the check-in experience, which is generally very poor! As a hotel that has been open for more than ten years, it is fine that it has not been renovated (generally hotels are renovated once every 10 years), but the toilet smell in the room is very strong! ! After I asked to change rooms, I finally agreed, but the room I changed to also had a toilet smell (which makes me wonder, do all suites have this smell?). In the end, I reluctantly stayed, but it didn‚Äôt work. He quickly fled after one night.

Finally, there is the dining and lounge experience. First, let me talk about a small preference of mine (no watermelon juice, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt), and then there is the charging socket. There is only one charging socket in the lounge of Novo University, and it is still connected to On the pantry? ? ? (It is also covered with dust. It seems that it has not been cleaned at all...)

To sum up, lightning protection! ! ! If you really want to see the tower view, I recommend Park Hyatt or Rosewood. I feel that even the Ritz is better than this... If you don't pursue the tower view, I suggest you stay in MO. No matter the service or facilities, it is not comparable to this one.

At 23:00, there were a lot of people waiting to go to the front desk, but there were only two people waiting at the front desk. After waiting for a full 20 minutes, there were still many people jumping in line. The staff next to me told them to "fill in if there are vacancies." The explanation for others jumping in line was "people." It‚Äôs too much and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it.‚Äù After entering the room, I had to change the pillows and called the front desk. The front desk couldn't tell me what the pillows were like. The quality of the pillows was not up to standard, so I just tolerated it.

Miss Elena Yang has a sweet voice! Be meticulous and patient! I can only say that the guest relations depar**ent works very seriously! The service is excellent!
Looking forward to staying at Four Seasons again next time! The four seasons are great! I like it very much! It‚Äôs not like some hotel-loving friends say, ‚ÄúFour Seasons is just a pile of luxury‚Äù! As a five-star hotel, isn't it about luxury... The luxury of Four Seasons is full of grandeur without losing refinement and elegance! As a hotelier, you deserve to experience the Four Seasons stay in Guangzhou

msg:I have always been interested in the Four Seasons Hotel before, and this time I finally got to experience it. After checking in, I can really feel the luxury of the Four Seasons Hotel. I booked a Canton Tower view room. The room is very big, and you can see the Canton Tower outside through the floor-to-ceiling windows. It's very beautiful, with standard facilities such as smart toilets and Dyson hairdryers. The bathroom is very large, separated from dry and wet areas, and the bed is extremely soft and comfortable. The service is also good. I bought a small quilt for my baby. Since I didn't book breakfast in the hotel, I wanted to go to the restaurant to ask for an egg for my baby, but I was told that an egg was 19 yuan, which was a bit unacceptable. The overall feeling of staying here is good.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank Hedy and Eva, the hotel guest relations ladies. For me, who likes to stay in hotels, the meticulous service in the past two days made me feel like home at Four Seasons. From the time of check-in, as long as I have needs, They can basically reply as soon as possible and try to satisfy them as much as possible: for example, after knowing that I have a hobby of collecting room cards, they specially prepared a whole suite of cards since the hotel opened; when checking out, they also help with taking a taxi and carrying luggage, unlike others. The hotel communicated proactively when checking in and ignored it when checking out (). Another episode was that the toilet in the room was broken on the first night of check-in. The front desk manager also called to inform him immediately and reserved the room for replacement. He apologized many times during the period and his attitude was sincere. (However, it is still recommended that the hotel should check more. I personally come here mainly to experience the hotel, so I don‚Äôt mind it very much. However, if you are a guest on a business trip and come back from a night out and encounter this situation, you will inevitably be a little angry. ..) In short, in terms of service, the standard of Four Seasons is indeed much higher than that of Rosewood next door.

Facilities are not bad, refurbished. Dyson hair dryer, Formar's toiletries, and their own bedding. (I love that pillow so much! It feels like the hotel that suits me best among the hotels I‚Äôve slept in! I decided to buy it from the gift shop!) I stayed in the executive tower view room for two days. It was nice to turn off the lights at night and take a bath while looking at the tower view. (Is it possible to set up several shared rooms with double beds? It‚Äôs weird for one person to stay in a twin room.)

The last is the experience of the executive lounge, the service is very good, um, better than Rosewood. (It's the old-fashioned and beautiful comparison link...). The dishes and desserts are changed every day, and the taste is good, especially the wine is very good.

To sum up, except that the floors are not as high as Rosewood, the elevator is slightly slower and the facilities are a little older, other aspects are slightly better than Rosewood. After experiencing a round of luxury hotels in Guangzhou, I will stay again next time. By the way, I will taste the restaurant of the four seasons!

msg:Relatively objective evaluation. Although I was ignored by the front desk staff, which led to complaints, after all, the attitude of the room attendant was very positive, otherwise the service item would have been scored "0". First of all, the hotel is in a good location and very convenient. The hardware and software of the equipment and facilities are outdated, the paint on the bathroom walls in the room is peeling off, and the door to the room is too heavy, making it difficult for the elderly and children. There is one elevator from the first floor to the 70th floor. It is very inconvenient to transfer to another elevator to reach the room floor. The breakfast had fewer varieties, poor taste, and the service level of the waiters was limited. The old man went to tell the room number and sat down on his own. After a long time, the service staff informed the room that there was no breakfast. The information was confirmed after several verifications, which seriously affected the guest's dining mood. It is understandable that hotel takeout cannot be delivered to the room, but there are many orders. The service staff on the first floor turned a blind eye and did not store or help. Customers went downstairs to register their meals on their own, and no one cared about their heavy items. The waiters passing by were all Didn't take the initiative to help or inquire, just like a chain hotel. The prices of the products sold at the swimming pool are relatively high, so it is recommended to bring your own swimsuit.

msg:A terrible, terrible hotel experience. There was no one to guide me when I checked in. When the concierge picked up my luggage and brought it to the room, I went straight in without knocking. I was still taking a shower at the time. When I was having breakfast, I came in and ordered a cup of coffee. It was almost finished but it wasn't even brought to me. It was only brought to me after my reminder. The hotel's courier storage is troublesome. You must enter the order number before you can store it. Telling your name and mobile phone number you left at check-in is not acceptable. For example, I asked for a storage bag and band-aid from room service for a long time, but they didn't arrive. Later, I called again and it was late. The swimming pool is extremely small, with only two very short swimming lanes, making it uncomfortable to use. Among all the hotels above 2k that I have stayed in, this hotel has the lowest service quality.

The night view of the Canton Tower is beautiful in the evening. The service attitude at the front desk is good. The rooms are upgraded. I am very happy and like it.

Xiaolong, the hotel concierge, is very professional and enthusiastic and helps with taking photos. This must be praised.
Here‚Äôs the highlight. On the day of check-in, I drank 1 can of Coke, 1 bottle of Heineken, and 1 bottle of water, a total of 3 bottles. On the second day of check-out, I informed the front desk that I drank a total of 3 bottles of drinks from the refrigerator. The front desk said that my colleagues would deduct it from the deposit after verification. I refunded the deposit on the second day and found that 322 yuan had been deducted. I checked with the front desk. I found that the drink money was deducted repeatedly! ! ! Then just call back and transfer the calls of four or five people before handling it. Then they told me that I would get a refund within 14 working days. It took 1 second to swipe the card and the refund took 14 days. This was caused by the mistake of your hotel staff. Is your hotel management so lax? ! ! ! Is this how you treat customers? ? ? If you don‚Äôt verify the deposit with the customer clearly, how much more money will you deduct if the customer doesn‚Äôt find out? ? ?
The way you handled it was also very speechless. You kept transferring calls and you didn't even feel that you had made any mistakes in your work!
Let me tell you, this hotel is really not worth it! !

After waiting for two and a half hours, After countless inquiries, I initially chose two rooms with river views, but one had a strong smell. The other with river view had two large pillars that completely dominated the entire window like "underpants". I chose the Four Seasons specifically for business use. River view, the result was very speechless. We waited for almost three hours to enter the two rooms. We waited for more than four hours for the last room. Although we upgraded the room type, we were still a little disappointed. The hotel environment and facilities are very nice in all aspects, but the connection really needs to be improved. At least if you are nervous about checking in, should you call the booking customer in advance to inform them in advance? The customer has been on a flight for so long and has no time to rest and is waiting for a room to check in. I waited for three hours and was speechless.

The most impressive thing about the room was how comfortable the shower was. It's true that I haven't felt such comfort in a long time.
In terms of cost-effectiveness, I don't know if it's high or not, but for people who can afford this price, this hotel is definitely the best choice when coming to Guangzhou.

The breakfast feels relatively simple, it should not be the standard of the four seasons! And the waiter did not remind that there is an a la carte menu! There was no menu on the table either! When the waiter wiped the table, the debris fell on the chair and did not pay attention. See picture 5, training needs to be strengthened!

msg:I originally planned to book a tower view suite, but I made a mistake and booked a city view suite. It's a pity that I couldn't see the small waist in the room. The decoration of the hotel is very nice. The only thing that I think is a little bad is that the floor height is a bit low. It seems unfriendly and depressing to a taller person like me. The hotel team is very good, high-quality service team, after checking out at noon, we had lunch at the restaurant on the 72nd floor. The management staff of the restaurant are very professional, they will recommend dishes and wine pairings and are very enthusiastic, which is worthy of recognition. The overall feeling is very good!

I don't know if all rooms are like this, but This is the kind of service I live in, and the service is average. The waiters are not enthusiastic enough, but the front desk service is very good. Once I went to the elevator and there was a waiter helping others to take express delivery. We all reached the elevator entrance and ignored us. We knew we were going up. Help me press the elevator door. The elevator door is closed. Fortunately, we pressed the elevator button in time, otherwise the elevator would have gone up. My door opened and the elevator door was closed. The waiter also ignored us and the service was average! What impressed me the most was the waiter in this elevator. The welcome fruit he sent was not fresh. After staying for three days, there were only oranges for three days. They were so sour that I couldn‚Äôt eat them.

The environment is beautiful, and it is a shock to overlook Xiaomanyao and the Pearl River from the 88th floor of the guest room. Nancy at the front desk took the initiative to take pictures of our parents. Knowing that my father likes to read newspapers, she asked her colleagues to deliver the Guangzhou Daily to the guest room at 1000 every morning. It was very heartwarming! In addition, the room cleaning and welcome staff are all in place. I really feel that "four seasons are like spring", and I will come againüòÄ

msg:When I come to Guangzhou often, I will definitely stay at Four Seasons every time. As soon as you enter the Four Seasons lobby, you feel like you are back home in Guangzhou. Not to mention the beautiful scenery surrounded by the Pearl River and a small waist, it looks like an endless sky when looking up from the sky. Each room is carefully designed and laid out to achieve warmth and comfort and other hardware facilities. Every employee is like a long-lost family member who rarely shows up. But every detail is specially adjusted according to customer preferences. Take this time as an example. I just placed an order on Ctrip. Manager Wang, who received me at Four Seasons in Guangzhou before, although he has been transferred to Suzhou, still remembers all my preferences, makes arrangements with colleagues in advance, and helps me. Upgrade to your favorite floor and room type. Eva followed up the whole process every time and contacted her on WeChat at any time. Although she couldn't meet in person, she was always with her. It wasn't the peak season, but there were a lot of guests checking in. During the check-in process, because I like to be quiet and fear being disturbed by the room next door, Daive worked hard to help me adjust to a relatively independent room that I had stayed in before. It really felt like returning to my own home. I went out to do errands during the day, and when I returned to my room at night, I saw the swimsuits hanging out by the window on a unique and exquisite portable clothes drying rack, with a neatly written note (sorry that I didn‚Äôt bring the note with me, under the name of the employee) (Updated later). In addition, because the return flight is late, we will take the initiative to arrange a late check-out every time. The staff of Four Seasons Guangzhou are like little angels, allowing guests to enjoy their private time quietly and arriving immediately at every needed moment. So now every time I travel, no matter where I go, as long as there are Four Seasons, I will always be there. is the first choice.

The average price of the bar on the top floor is around 150. This price is relatively low in ordinary bars in the urban area, but the wine is definitely much better than other bars, and it is very distinctive.
Although the room has been around for ten years, the ipad with this customized system has clear page design and smooth animation, which is much better than the Android tablet that claims to be intelligent all the way, but uses messy buttons and free fonts like web pages . You can use this ipad to request in-room dining and services without the need for a big phone company. Similarly, the Samsung TV in the room should also be replaced later and support screen projection instead of just a decoration like many old hotel TVs.

Over drinks! The solution given by the hotel: We choose to believe you and exempt you from paying for drinks. Very bad experience. They waived my drink bill. I never drank at all! Dear check-in friends, it is recommended to take a photo of the drink when checking out to avoid a situation like mine happening.

Suggestion: The food in the hotel is inferior, especially the breakfast, whether it is in the executive lounge or the restaurant on the 72nd floor, there are few varieties and does not highlight the characteristics of Guangzhou cuisine. As a gateway hotel in Guangzhou, in addition to satisfying the tastes of guests from all over the world, it should also highlight the characteristics of local cuisine.

Even if you move in in 2023, you don't feel that the hardware is backward. The bathroom is fully intelligent and the bathtub is huge. The room size is super large, a few blocks away from the Rosewood Hotel next door. Because the plane was late, I arrived at the hotel at 12:30 in the morning. The front desk of the hotel was very caring, with free upgrades to suites, free late check-out, comfortable smiles throughout the process, without showing any fatigue. When checking out, the guide at the front desk simply asked whether to use the paid room supplies. If he didn‚Äôt use them, he gave him the room card directly, and left to check out. The deposit will be credited in 1 minute. Not too smooth at all. To sum up, Four Seasons Hotel Guangzhou maintains a first-class service level, the staff feel of high quality, the room space, and the scenery are invincible. Guangzhou is very beautiful, see you next time in Guangzhou~

I learned that the Canton Fair cannot be used recently, so I made a reservation on Ctrip. It can be seen that some facilities have been renovated and upgraded, and the previous L'Occitane wash and care has been changed to Formar. However, is it for environmental protection? It is not very good to change it to a large bottle. Residents with a cleanliness will probably be very concerned about it. I like the bedding very much. It is very comfortable to sleep and the height of the pillow is also comfortable. The room service is very good, and the night view is also good.

The breakfast is quite high-quality, but it is not worthy of the price of 278 yuan. There is not much to eat. It is recommended that Chinese people do not bring breakfast when booking. Don't say it is an international hotel. After all, you are operating in China.

msg:Guangzhou Four Seasons, an unforgettable experience.

Because the parents are going home, even if the weather is not beautiful and the misty rain is everywhere, I still want them to take a look at the landmark "Xiaomanyao" in Guangzhou before leaving. Therefore, I chose to live in Guangzhou Four Seasons, which is the closest to "Xiaoman Yao". The hotel has an excellent location, next to Huacheng Square, and below is the subway station. For the elderly with handicapped legs, it is the first choice for convenient travel.

In fact, when I chose a hotel, I was always hesitant about Four Seasons. The reviews from the guests were not very good, and I have stayed in this hotel before, and I think the facilities are relatively old. However, after several comparisons and considerations, I chose it.

When I checked in, the front desk always recommended adding money to upgrade the room type, saying that I could get the room faster, but my parents insisted on not letting me add money, and I didn‚Äôt really want to have breakfast in the executive lounge again, so I gave up , it turned out that this decision was wrong. Later, the room was not arranged until four o'clock in the afternoon. Fortunately, the front desk of the hotel upgraded us to a suite for free, so that the elderly parents could enter the room to rest. Of course, I also thank the young lady at the front desk for helping us to note the late check-out at my repeated request.
However, what puzzles me is that they can't add another floor's authority to one card when two rooms are not on the same floor like other hotels, but make several cards for different floors. The card was given to us, but it was not very convenient to hold these cards in the hand, and it was easy to confuse. Later, I found that some cards could not be used, so I had to go back to the front desk to make a new one. Anyway, the whole process was a bit confusing, which made people feel Not professional.

When you come to the room, remind everyone that you can't completely trust the photos on the Internet, including the photos on the hotel's own mall. I booked the Premier Canton Tower View Double Room. As soon as I entered the door, I saw two crossed pillars standing in front of the bed, and the TV set was horizontal in front of the pillars, blocking most of the view in front of the window. Pretty waist" to go to the bathroom. Moreover, the bathtub is quite large, but the shower room is very narrow. If it can be neutralized a little, it will feel more reasonable and practical. What's even more depressing is that it is next to the next room, and the sound of opening and closing the door next to it is very loud, and it is always mistaken for knocking on our door. Because I stayed in this hotel before and booked a suite, I didn't expect that there was such a big gap in view, room layout and environment between the room types!

The room also prepares welcome fruit, which is a bit shabby, an apple, a pear and an orange. I didn‚Äôt think much of it before, but I met the waiter on the elevator to deliver the fruit. Of course, there is nothing wrong with realizing the different trea**ent. Of course, the higher-priced room type has better trea**ent. Therefore, I said to myself silently in my heart that I must book a good room next time.

We had breakfast at "Yizhen" on the 72nd floor. I bought a coupon on Ctrip, which was more favorable. The view of the restaurant is first-class, outside the large and bright floor-to-ceiling windows, the "Xiaomanyao" after the rain is smoky and towering into the sky. The variety of breakfast is quite rich, and the Chinese refreshments are not bad, especially the steamed shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, pork ribs, glutinous rice chicken, etc., as well as pancakes, fruit, and meat sandwiches. Parents who love traditional food are quite satisfied. There are also 3 a la carte rice noodles and wanton noodles, remember to place your order yourself. What is disappointing is that I thought it was an Italian restaurant, and it should be good for bread, cakes and other pastries, and I kept recommending it to my parents. I didn't expect the taste to be very average, not as good as the InterContinental and Park Hyatt I stayed in before. But the smoked salmon was not bad. The service staff were not proactive enough to collect the dishes. They came only after calling out. They felt that all their energy was focused on the guests who just came in, for fear of missing the payment. I guess it may be because the breakfast is open to the public and there are many outside guests Bar. Anyway, the quality of service is not very good. The chef who ordered an "Eggs Benedict" also said that he had to talk to the waiter, which was a bit baffling. And that "Eggs Benedict" is different from the ones I ate before. In my impression, "Eggs Benedict" is a soft-boiled egg that is about to burst. It's already exploded, and it doesn't look good.

However, there is one thing to say, the gym here is very satisfying to me, even better than Rosewood. The facilities inside are complete, including mineral water, fruits, books, etc., and there is also a special toilet, which will not be shared with the swimming pool. This is the biggest highlight. Also, the deposit was returned quickly after we checked out. I am also very satisfied with this.

Finally, I have to say that this is an unforgettable experience. Watching "Little Man Waist" in the rain, meeting four seasons in the rain, that four seasons are different from before.

msg:The main reason for staying here is because I have never lived in Four Seasons in Guangzhou, and because of its design and it is just above the West Tower. I really like the overall design style. I also saw many girls and brothers taking pictures. The hotel lobby is on the 70th floor. Check in Waiting in line for half an hour and waiting for disinfection for half an hour, before and after an hour before entering the room, there are really many people, I really don‚Äôt think this is a five-star hotel when I check in in the lobby, haha~ I don‚Äôt know why so many people stay, but The service attitude of the staff at the front desk is relatively good, but the downside is that the wait is too long and it is not like the front desk of a five-star hotel. I am satisfied with the scenery of the room and other aspects. It is clean and comfortable. After entering the elevator and the room, it is only once Very good check-in performance. Although the toiletries are no longer L‚ÄôOccitane, the hair dryer is still from Dyson. There is a bar on the 99th floor, which is open to the public, so it is still full of people. You need to make a reservation in advance. The night view is super beautiful. You can consider staying again. The surrounding scenery of the four seasons in Guangzhou It is still a relatively good experience in all aspects!

1. When I fell asleep in the middle of the night, the quilt and quilt cover separated. I had to wait for 30 minutes to get a new one.
2. The film on the phone in the room was so speechless that I couldn‚Äôt read the words at all. When I called to ask for the quilt to be changed in the middle of the night, I had to look for the front desk button to wake me up.
3. It‚Äôs obviously an open lobby coffee bar? When I checked out, I wanted to take a picture of Canton Tower, but I was stopped by the waiter. After asking twice, I got the exact same reply, "It's not business hours yet."
The waiter in the hotel lobby gave me the feeling that he didn't take me seriously at all. He was like a trained Taobao customer service person.
I have never given a bad review to a hotel, and Four Seasons is the first. I am very disappointed with everything from facilities to service.

Checked in at 10 o'clock in the evening on the first day, and when I came back the next day, I found that the room was not cleaned, and there was a sign on the door that said it had been cleaned? In Guangzhou, a friend drove a friend's car to a hotel. I wanted to park in the parking space at the entrance and was refused to park. I went around to the underground parking lot. I dragged two luggage and no waiter came to help. I forgot to mention breakfast. There are few types of breakfast, and there are many people. It takes a long time to order porridge, and only a little bit is served. I don't want to complain anymore, I won't come back for four seasons.

This time we booked a dream cloud castle room type, which is known as the ceiling of the parent-child room in Guangzhou. Really worthwhile trip.
One day in advance, Ms. Su from the Guest Relations Depar**ent of Four Seasons Hotel added me on WeChat, what time to arrive, to prepare fruits and desserts for the children, and to explain the driving route and the location of the parking lot very clearly.
Room facilities:
Located on the 93rd floor, there is a big bed and a bunk bed. The whole room is really childlike, with children's toothpaste and toothbrush, a small stool, and a small sofa; the skin care product is Fuxia, the hair dryer is Dyson, and the coffee machine is illy.
Cost performance:
4899 without breakfast is really not very humane. I have to eat breakfast with my children, I don‚Äôt know why... Breakfast can be purchased on the official account, half price for children. I also have comments on breakfast, see another post for details.
swimming pool:
It is the biggest highlight! The water temperature is 28 degrees, and the jacuzzi is very comfortable. The music under the swimming pool is very technological, and you can enjoy the tower view while swimming. There was a lady named Liang in the waiter who was very enthusiastic. She helped me blow-dry and tie my daughter's hair, helped us get waterproof bags, and showed me the dryer. Put the swimsuit in for a turn, dry in 15 seconds, and then put it in the bag for me!
Everything is great and we are back. Thank you Ms. Su for your greetings. I am very happy to stay in Four Seasons.

msg:This hotel blurs the line between "service" and "fooling", and has an unpredictable and very firm pursuit of catering to guests.

The overall design and location are remarkable, but the experience of staying this time really deserves a solid one star.

At 10:19 on the first night, my friend asked the front desk to fill the bathtub with water, but the front desk refused bluntly, because "there is no one in the room, and the bathtub is filled with water to prevent the water from overflowing and flooding the carpet."

I made the same request three hours later, and the front desk was very proficient in asking if any other supplies were needed. I wonder if you put it here to play with the contrast? As everyone knows, apart from this, the next two nights will be different surprises every night!

At 11:20 the next night, I made the same request, which was directly rejected by the front desk. I continued to ask, and the front desk said that I needed to ask the duty manager for instructions. It took six and a half minutes to make a phone call, but the result was that the manager was in a meeting and would call me back later.

The manager's professionalism is very high, and his communication method is extremely effective. The sentence "we don't have training to fill customers' bathtubs in four seasons" directly kills the conversation. Then how did your second receptionist complete this service so skillfully the night before?

The manager went on to say, "After all, we are people-oriented in the four seasons, your needs will be recorded, and you will not encounter similar things in the future." Can't be solved by you? ? ?

The climax came. At 3:17 p.m. on the third day, the result of the concierge's people-oriented service is shown in Figure 3. I laughed out loud in the bathroom. May I ask if this is your four seasons' understanding of "fill the bathtub full, put it in a place where you can soak directly and ask the temperature"? ? ? Is this a large footbath? ? ? Take a bath in other places to soothe your body and mind. Does your blood pressure soar in the four seasons? ? ? This is your "NEED ANYTHING, LET'S CHAT"???

I was so angry that I rushed to the front desk on the 70th floor again. At that time, the manager on duty said that the water was only willing to be put in such a bottom because he was afraid that the water would overflow. I was shocked again in the lobby of your store. You can simply refuse me and let me check out and leave, but you still pretend to fill the bathtub with a quarter of water to amuse me. It's so touching! ! !

Is this your people-oriented approach? ? ? Do you Guangzhou Four Seasons like to play with customers? ? ? The sense of service is comparable to that of the security guard downstairs looking at the gate with his legs crossed. You really have four seasons!

After swimming once, the child's eyes were red and he had a low fever. The room was not cleaned until after 5 pm that day and I checked in. I started to rush for the room before I checked out. It took two hours to deliver a few bottles of water. When the waiter delivered something, he probably didn't hear the knock on the door, so he walked straight into the bathroom, which shocked me. To sum up, it was just the cold feeling of reinforced concrete. After staying for three nights, everyone in the family felt dizzy. Wouldn't stay again. Also not recommended to stay with children.

I found that the chemical smell in the room was still there. It didn't go away after opening the door for half an hour, so I went to the front desk to change rooms. There was no chemical smell in the new room, so I felt fine. It was already past 11pm, and I was getting ready to rest. After turning on the water faucet, the shower room began to emit a peculiar smell, and the smell became stronger and stronger. After getting dressed, I went to the front desk to change rooms. Although the room I changed to was large, it was not the river view I booked. It's twelve o'clock, and I have work to do during the day, so I can't bother with it so late. Fortunately, the front desk and waiters are pretty nice, and they keep apologizing. It's really not their fault. Whose fault is it? I believe I am not the only one to report this problem, and I hope I am the last.

The first floor is basically guaranteed to have reception guidance at any time. The front desk is on the 70th floor, and there is a special person responsible for organizing the check-in queue.
Call the reservation depar**ent in advance to request a room with a view. River view room 7511 is facing the Rosewood Hotel and the Liede Bridge, and facing Xiaomanyao. The view is very good. Unfortunately, the glass is too dirty. It is understandable that the cost of cleaning is very high. After all, it is the expectation of the four seasons higher.
Although the public areas and rooms are rarely old, they are well maintained. Except for the fading of the air-conditioning buttons and scratches on the floor drain of the bathtub, it can be seen that they have been aged for a long time, and they will not be in disrepair at all.

The most satisfying thing about this trip is the bed and latex pillow of the Four Seasons Hotel! The service is also very good, and there are always answers. What else can you ask for from a 12-year-old hotel? Well maintained! It is why the faucet and shower in the bathroom are considered to be replaced! Not very useful!

Asking for help from the room at the hotel was quickly resolved. Especially if the child accidentally pinches his hand, he can send medicine into the room immediately. It's very convenient to eat and go shopping downstairs, the check-in points are all nearby, and the location is good. After all, it is an old luxury hotel with slightly old facilities. When checking out, the handsome guy at the front desk also enthusiastically gave the room card as a souvenir.

msg:The quality of Four Seasons has always been very good. I have lived in both Hong Kong and Sydney. It is the first time I have lived in Four Seasons in Guangzhou. I feel that the experience is not good. The doorman at the door did not take the initiative to open the door. His attitude is average. The lounge chairs in the lobby look like they have not been cleaned for a long time. The white leather is already yellow-black. The armrests of the cloth chairs in the coffee shop on the 70th floor have been worn out, dirty and shiny, and it is extremely uncomfortable to sit on. It should be because you don‚Äôt want customers to stay for a long time. Dare to compliment. The guest rooms do not have a warm feeling. The marble on the sink countertop in the toilet has such a large crack, which has not been repaired. I feel like I am in a small hotel in a fifth-tier city. In short, I am very disappointed, and the price/performance ratio is too bad. There are too few food options for breakfast, and the freshness of the food is average.

The room is facing Xiaomanyao, and there are welcome fruits and macaron snacks in the room. Two adults and two children stay in a double room, free extra bed. Everything else is good, but I got to sleep at about 1 o'clock on New Year's Eve. Just after falling asleep, someone kept ringing the doorbell, saying it was the housekeeping depar**ent. I was too tired and didn't want to get up, and kept knocking on the door. My husband and children were sleeping. It was too heavy, so I gritted my teeth and got up. After waking up, I didn‚Äôt dare to open the door. I saw that no one was there through the peephole of the door, so I went to lie down again. Then I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep until almost three o‚Äôclock. Led to be in a bad mood today.

As a hotel that has been rated by Forbes for several consecutive years, it shows the due service level. The customer relationship is maintained and handled just right, very humane and caring. Special thanks to Manager Su for customer relations, who made a very thoughtful arrangement and left a good memory for the baby's birthday ceremony. If necessary, he will choose to stay in Guangzhou Four Seasons again.

Not only can you enjoy the view of the river and the tower from a high altitude, but also the services of the Four Seasons have always been very good. The best thing is that the arrangement of the restaurant, swimming pool and spa is very reasonable, there is no need to take too many extra roads, and the humanized care can be seen in the details, which is quite admirable.

msg:To be honest, the Four Seasons Hotel Guangzhou is not recommended. Navigating to the parking lot on the map software is in the wrong location. After a few large circles outside, the underground parking lot is in a mess. Even the security guards say it is not good enough, and there are no eye-catching guide signs. and also! More room questions!
‚ë†- The lack of damage to the facilities, the Four Seasons is the first Golden Diamond Hotel I have ever seen, and the shower is leaking! A bathtub with no bath supplies but a bar of soap! Seriously, the shampoo and shower gel are placed in the shower room, and the base will hit your feet as soon as you take it out. You can ask me to spend more money to buy it! There is no hall light switch in the room, only the main gate switch. Seriously, in order to turn off the lights and see the night view, turn off all the lights.
‚ë°The scenery is disappointing, not to mention that the fog is not big recently, and the glass of the exterior windows should also be cleaned. When you look outside, you can rarely see the lights of the office buildings. Otherwise, why would I order a luxury river view! ! !
‚ë¢ Management issues, the swimming pool closes at 10 o'clock in the evening, which makes people who stay here unable to experience the night bath. . I bought all the swimsuits so that they could be delivered, and I was utterly disappointed.
‚ë£The functions are tasteless and the facilities are outdated. The remote control of the remote control TV is very thin and insensitive.
There is also the Ministry of Military Affairs who added WeChat, and they kept urging me to say, "Have you not arrived yet?" Didn't I say that I arrived before or after dinner? Could it be that your hotel still has a check-in time limit? The reply was not timely, "I said I didn't see the message last night." . . .
Just the toilet. . Very smart, other, too general, not worth staying. It doesn't matter if you spend a small thousand, you are in a bad mood.

Whether it is the Pearl River in the mist in the morning or the bustling night, I will never tire of seeing it. My room faces east, and I am fortunate to see a little sunrise in the mist. ~
The design of the hotel is very good, you can shoot a blockbuster at will, the room facilities are very good and perfect, and it is very quiet~
Two days and one night, it is really unsatisfactory for staying in Four Seasons. I haven't had time to experience the SPA of Four Seasons, etc. I feel that it takes more time and more times to experience all of them~
Yizhen's buffet breakfast is a combination of Chinese and Western, with a wide variety of varieties. Enjoying the breakfast with the scenery is a must. I only took a little of everything. Even so, I tried my best, but I only ate two-thirds of it, and I didn't have to eat lunch. Now, directly from breakfast to brunch, Yizhen's service is also first-class, I feel what five-star service is
It is indeed a top luxury ceiling hotel, and it is also a hotel recommended by friends who are studying hotel management. I look forward to coming to the Four Seasons vacation next time~

2. The business of the hotel may be relatively good recently, so good that I did not feel that the hotel is the so-called benchmark of the hotel service industry.
3. There was an empty shower gel bottle in the shower room of the room. We used shampoo to take a bath when we left the store. We were in a hurry to go to Park Hyatt for dinner, so we didn't respond to this problem like the hotel. I hope the hotel will pay more attention to the details. control.
4. If you want to go to the hotel bar at night, if you are not afraid of trouble, it is recommended to go to the magnificent bar, and the personal experience is very good.
5. If the afternoon tea area of the hotel is open to the outside world, it is not recommended if you are not staying in an executive suite, because the normal room for afternoon tea is too noisy to use in the lobby, and many children are.
The above is a little disappoin**ent for my stay this time. It is estimated that I will not stay in Guangzhou Four Seasons. The hotel breakfast is quite good, including the ice cream sales in the lobby. I love it.

The only thing that made me uncomfortable was the pool staff. As soon as you enter, you have to register at the front desk. This part is normal, after all, it is an extraordinary period. After entering the pool, the staff were playing with their mobile phones and ignored us, but when we had all been swimming for a long time, they suddenly brought a registration form and came to me to register again, which is inexplicable. Tired of swimming, I sat by the pool for a while, took the swimming cap in my hand, and came over to ask if I had a swimming cap. Is it because of my bad eyesight? The experience is really bad. Originally, there were not many people in the swimming pool. Whether it was registration or checking the swimming cap, it should be made clear as soon as you came in. It is recommended to strengthen the training of the swimming pool staff. They have been playing with their mobile phones there. If they think about it, they will disturb the guests again. The experience is not good.

    The hotel is located in the International Financial Center. Go up to the 70th floor to check in. Looking up, the hollow design of the triangular cone with a wide bottom and a narrow top is indeed breathtaking. Metal interwoven giant screen, simple and a**ospheric.
   The reception arranged for me this time was Refia, and it was arranged for me before I arrived. The service is impeccable and super five-star.
   I was pleasantly surprised when I entered the tower view room. The whole room is full of brilliance and prosperity. The equipment is also very advanced, but I just feel that there is a need for a remote control for the curtains. When I open my eyes in the morning and press the button, I can see the Pearl River view. At night, the night scene is just like what Miss Refia said. Guangzhou night city is full of views. Bring a bubble bath and drink a glass of wine. It feels like you can spend the whole day in the hotel.

The afternoon tea on the 70th floor must be a place to punch in, but it must be booked in advance. The hotel room is very large, although it has been open for eight years , but the whole room is very clean, that is, there will be a little smell when entering the room, but it is acceptable, the air conditioner is super quiet, as if it is not turned on, this is the only one I have in Intercontinental at the same level, the service is first-class, we It is also very worthwhile to go to the 99th floor to observe. I look forward to taking another vacation with the children.

msg:Guangzhou Four Seasons is really worth having. Before I set off, I asked the hotel's guests in Shanghai what policies they have. The hotel said that after arriving in Guangzhou, the low-risk areas in Shanghai only need two inspections for three days, no restrictions on entry and exit, and no need for isolation. So happy to book four nights. Since the train can only arrive in Guangzhou at 23:45, I contacted the hotel and said that our two children needed an extra bed (the double bed is already a big bed of 1.37 meters). The hotel arranged a very good view and a very large room for For us, the children's toiletry bag is a large toothpaste, and the bathroom in the room is also large. The bathtub is enough for three people to take a bath. The children like to soak three times a day. In addition, there is nothing to say about hardware and service. When I see children, I will give them small gifts. It really deserves to be a five-star. I don‚Äôt even think about the magnificent. 8 bottles of mineral water, wash and care are from Oulong. Today I live in Chimelong, I regret it to death, I would rather take a taxi to play, it can't compare with the Four Seasons

I chose the Four Seasons Hotel, which is &quot;high above the ground.&quot; Not &quot;high above&quot;, not only upgraded the beautiful tower view room for me, but also presented a birthday cake for two consecutive nights (too polite). The service in the room is even more meticulous and thoughtful. We know that we like to make tea, and the mineral water is constantly replenished. Every time we go out and come back, the room is tidy and neat. Over the years, I have stayed in five-star hotels, but I feel that the Four Seasons Hotel is really unusual - four seasons, four seasons as warm as spring!

Because it is located on the IFC70 floor of Zhujiang New Town, it can take the central area of the Pearl River, especially the Canton Tower, at the moment, which is also the most competitive part of Guangzhou Four Seasons.

üöó Traffic: Because it is located in the CBD, the commute time is really congested, and I almost missed the cruise at night

üßπ Hygiene: Checked, high cleanliness


üîîService: This is worth mentioning, because it was my birthday that night, the hotel specially prepared a birthday gift for me, and also upgraded me to a distinguished tower view room. However, I want to make a suggestion. The front desk asked me in advance whether I could stay on the 98th floor (I don't know if I remember correctly), and said that there is a bar upstairs, which is open until 1:30 at night, which will be a bit noisy.
Because at first I thought of a resident singing like the 38th floor of Melco, but at 10:30 p.m., as soon as I got out of bed, the sound of disco piercing through the entire floor was a vibrating feeling! but! The service of Four Seasons is really good. The same room type was already full, so they transferred me to the River View Suite. This kind of service is worth my visit again!
Thank you Four Seasons for giving me and my girlfriend a great birthday experience!

msg:Several five-star hotels in this area of Zhujiang New Town are the price ceilings of Guangzhou hotels, which are the highest in the four seasons. Because I have to go to the US consulate for an interview, there are several five-star hotels within 1,000 meters of the nearest five-star hotels, such as Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Park Hyatt, and Rosewood. After struggling for a while, I chose Four Seasons. Because I could not bring electronic products such as mobile phones to the US consulate, I was afraid of delaying things. I walked out of the four seasons and walked to the nearest US consulate. It took more than 400 meters and a few minutes, which was really convenient. The hotel is indeed decorated in a high-end, in line with the high-end five-star standard. The breakfast was bought on Ctrip. It costs 188 yuan per person, which is a little cheaper than the room with breakfast. The reason for not choosing to bring breakfast is not only to save a little money, but also to keep it. Mobility, you can go to the famous morning tea shop in Guangzhou. We and the young couple from Guangzhou went to Dode for breakfast. The four of us ordered a lot, and the food was only 330 yuan. There are basically all the categories of Chinese food and Western food in the hotel breakfast. They are quite satisfactory, not very rich, but they are enough for my old stomach. All hotel staff (from welcome, luggage, front desk, rooms) are very friendly and responsive. I like the quality of the razors in the hotel. When I left, I asked the front desk to ask for one, but they actually gave two. Bottled water and fruits were mostly sent, and a small warm card was also written. The only downside is that the mattress Simmons is super soft. My wife and I can't stand it because of the old waist. We have to practice carp squatting when we get up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet. A room with a small waist is more than 200 expensive. The hotel can see some seats in the coffee shop in the lobby on the 70th floor and the breakfast restaurant on the 72nd floor, so there is no additional fee.

msg:Wudy from the reservation depar**ent was very enthusiastic about the purpose of our stay.
Knowing that it was a birthday celebration, they prepared cakes for us and arranged flowers for us, which was very attentive. Also very nice. The champagne you gave is okay, you can drink it, but don't worry about the taste.

There are a few points that I am not satisfied with is that the guidelines for the underground parking lot are not clear enough.
Second, the hot water in the room was too hot to take a shower at all.

The hotel's breakfast scenery is also good.
The hotel as a whole is quite satisfactory, not as luxurious as expected. .
Is there a tentative next time.

We carefully prepared cute cartoon door cards and snacks for the children. The rooms are clean and tidy, and the night view is particularly beautiful. Both the city view and the river view are very beautiful.
Next time I come to Guangzhou and stay in a hotel, I will still choose the Four Seasons Hotel. The experience was very nice!

The next day I received a call from Ctrip's customer service customer service Lulu, who checked with me to confirm the needs and asked if there was anything else that needed to be added. The day before departure, I received a call from hotel wudy and added WeChat, reconfirmed my needs, and explained things such as self-driving parking spaces. Guangzhou epidemic affected the occupancy rate, so we got the room card and arranged it before 1 o'clock. You can see the Canton Tower in the room, there is no need to queue for check-in, and we will be sent upstairs to the room after the check-in. Well, all the baby supplies are arranged properly, including cribs, bottle sterilizers, baby bath tubs and even diapers. . After the nap, go to the 69th floor for a swim. The children can soak in the hot spring pool and see the view of the Canton Tower~ Back to the room, I received the birthday cake arranged by wudy people ‚ù§Ô∏è

As a result, at three o'clock, there was still a waiter who brought champagne and fruit. Thank you very much. Was pleasantly surprised. In the evening, there was a young lady who came to turn the bed down and change the consumables. The next day, because my husband slept late, Miss Wudy also applied for a late check-out for me. In the end, because of something, we left early. It was really good. look forward to next time

Food: The safety estimate is quite safe, and food that exceeds three hours is no longer recommended for guests to eat. But the taste, I personally think it is not outstanding, slightly disappointed. The breakfast is ok. The afternoon tea in the executive lounge has nothing else to do except for its beautiful appearance. Don't try it if you pay for it. You will be very disappointed. In the evening, take a break with the cocktails in the Executive Lounge. The taste of cocktails is similar everywhere.

I live on the 96th floor, the whole room has a 180-degree river view room, floor-to-ceiling glass windows, You can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Guangzhou while lying on the bed, you can see Xiaomanyao and the Pearl River, and what is more comfortable is that you can enjoy the beautiful scenery outside from the bubble bath. The most commendable thing is the five-star service of the hotel, from booking to check-in They are all very caring. I would like to thank the pony who answered the phone and Sandra at the front desk. Because I had to arrange the room in advance for my birthday, both of them patiently helped me communicate and coordinate with the room. Sandra at the front desk also took the initiative.

Although the hotel has been open for a long time, it is well maintained and the environment is first-class. Unfortunately, it has rained in the past two days and the scenery is not very good. The food delivery is very good, although the price is high but the taste is good. The second thing to complain about is the breakfast in the executive lounge. I care about what Zhen eats, and the product is really hard to describe (the glutinous rice chicken is very dry and the glutinous rice is undercooked, and the fried ones are not fresh and left for a long time, they are all dry and hard, the porridge is too It's not porridge, it's as thick as BB rice)

It is about a 5-minute walk from the subway station (Great Theater). There are many shopping buildings around. AEON is also nearby, and for me as a Japanese, it was convenient because I could get Japanese things. You can easily reach the Guangzhou Tower by subway. The location is good.
‚óè Cleanliness
Cleaning is very polite. The cleaning lady also felt good and gave the children sweets and fruits as gifts. Even when I went out once after check-in, the room was prepared again, such as bed make-up and garbage collection, which was wonderful. It was this ho that the room was clean on the day of check-in
Tell was the first time. The cleaning lady also remembered the age of the child and gave me slippers, a toothbrush, toothpaste and a cup for the child.
‚óè Equipment
This time, I stayed in a room on the 92nd floor. On the first day, the scenery was wonderful and the night view was especially beautiful. The second day was rainy and cloudy. The windows were covered with clouds and turned white, and I couldn't see the scenery at all. It is unavoidable, but if the weather is bad, you may not be able to see the magnificent view from the room even in the high rise.
I didn't know how to use the shower room right away, so I tried and errored for about 10 minutes. There is a whirlpool-like device that you have never seen before, and at first glance you cannot tell how to use it. I had a hard time not knowing how to put out water, how to stop it, and how to control the temperature. Perhaps if there are 10 people, 9 people will be confused.
I also want a trash can in the bathroom. I want tissue not only in the washroom but also in the room.
‚óè Breakfast
The breakfast room staff should have included the breakfast fee in the Trip.com reservation, but the staff at the breakfast room told me to sign an invoice with the price for two adults. We had to explain to the staff that breakfast was included in the room charge. I stayed for 2 nights, but the same thing happened at breakfast for 2 consecutive days. We were another staff member, but we brought the invoice in the same way and we gave the same explanation. This should be improved.
Breakfast itself was delicious, although there were few types. The location was on the 72nd floor and the view was good.
‚óè Pool
The pool on the 69th floor should go if you stay. The view is wonderful and the pool is beautiful. There is also a warm jacuzzi space. There is also a sauna in the locker room.
‚óè Movie room, children's playground
Located on the 2nd floor of the annex. You need to go down to the 1st floor, move to a separate building, and go to the 2nd floor. The movie room isn't that big. The children's playground is very good. The female staff is also kind and wonderful.
‚óè Front staff
We asked the front desk staff to make a same-day reservation for the restaurant in the hotel. The front desk staff was very happy to make a reservation. However, when the restaurant reservation time was approaching, an SMS was sent to my smartphone in the name of the hotel, and the content was different from what I had reserved. The date of the reservation was the next day, and I received a link asking me to pay because I made a reservation for a "packet" that I didn't remember making a reservation for. I was confused because it was similar to the price of a restaurant. I didn't know what this SMS was when I showed it to the restaurant staff, and the staff told me to ignore the SMS. I don't know what this SMS was after all. It took about 30 minutes to visit the restaurant staff and wait for an answer, but the meal order was delayed and wasted time. I want you to stop making such mistakes.
The restaurant itself was 1 Michelin star and really delicious. The guide of the restaurant was good at Japanese and felt good.
‚óè General
The building is high-rise and the lobby is beautiful. The pool and breakfast venue are elegant. A Michelin-starred restaurant is also located within the hotel. I went to Chinese New Year. The lion dance event was on the first floor, which was unusual and wonderful for us. It is a luxury hotel that I would like to stay again. Thank you for your wonderful extraordinary life. I had the best Chinese New Year.

It also delivered a fruit platter, which can be said to be quite good. The service at the front desk of the hotel is also first-class, very professional and unprofessional. It will delay our check-in time, it is communicated through the phone in advance, try to meet the needs of parents, absolute praise.

For the booked deluxe river view room, Ctrip customer service communicated that the tower view is not visible in this room type, and the actual room you stayed in can be seen, which is very good. Some facilities need to be improved. For example, there are fewer paper towels and trash cans in the room, which is more inconvenient. There is no trash can in the bathroom, which is more embarrassing. The toiletries are still high-quality, and the hair dryer is also Dyson, which is well received. This time, I found a small amount of stains on the supplies on the room. This needs to be taken seriously. All other aspects are good, and the four seasons are as good as ever!

msg:Peerless room, after all the four seasons
After a business trip to Guangzhou, temporarily decided to live in Four Seasons. In addition to the excellent location, the consistent quality of the four seasons is also trustworthy.
Check in at ten o'clock in the evening. The little concierge at the door saw that I got off the car without wearing a mask, so he immediately handed a new one with both hands to remind me that I needed to wear a mask. This is much better than the blunt requirement to wear a mask, and I instantly feel the hospitality of the four seasons.
Don‚Äôt be kind to the front desk. After checking in quickly, the administration building will close for half an hour, reminding me that I can sit up and take a look at the scenery; then I handed over the luggage to the concierge. I like to go to the administration building and have a cup of hot milk before returning to the room. ; This detail makes traveling business travelers feel more cordial.
When I returned to the room, my luggage had been placed on the luggage rack, and I had grasped the time and procedure standards just right.
The quality control of the four seasons has been maintained at the same level as before. No matter the cleanliness of the outer window glass or the response speed of the service, it is impeccable. One of them called to clean the bathtub, and the service staff quickly came to the room and carefully completed the disinfection with various bottles and cans.
The scenery is as shown in the picture. No matter day or night, they are all beautiful.
In short, Guangzhou Four Seasons has drawn a perfect end to this trip, thank you very much.

The suites are driven away at the time, and the executive lounge has no time to use.
The speaker can't be used and no one will repair it, and the voltage of the toilet light is unstable and will flash.
The air conditioner is too noisy, and the smart toilet always turns on by itself, like a **.
I called someone to fix the speakers, and no one came from checking in at 6 pm to checking out at 2 pm the next day. After complaining, the manager said to call me back, but I haven't called yet. The service doesn't match the price. Living in a deluxe city view suite, it takes more than ten minutes to check out, and the deposit refund is slow. Hotel facilities are old. It only takes 20 minutes for Rosewood to refund the deposit. Park Hyatt has a very good attitude at the front desk, which is better than Four Seasons. There is no five-star hotel near Zhujiang New Town that is worse than Four Seasons, including attitude, facilities and experience. The room service phone call and the first sentence you said was always in English. I didn't know whether I stayed in a Chinese hotel or a foreign hotel.

First of all, the service is generally done, but a lot of detailed communication made me feel a little uncomfortable. When I checked in, I was told that I need to pay a deposit of 1,500. It was also very friendly and helped me upgrade my room. I ordered a breakfast at the front desk. The front desk politely said that it would be arranged directly when checking out. Deduction, it felt pretty good at the time.
Then when I was eating the next day, I was interrupted again to confirm the amount of breakfast and the number of diners required me to sign). When I checked out, I went to confirm the amount of the number of diners and asked me to pay for breakfast (my friend couldn‚Äôt get up, so I ate alone) Later, my colleagues reminded me to emphasize the deposit deduction again. (Confirming the breakfast fee with me again and again made me feel like I couldn‚Äôt afford the breakfast fee, laughing) I was in a hurry. Compared with other hotels, I felt that it was a waste of my time to check out the exception room. Some details of hygiene are not in place. The customer service service I need is a set of shampoo and conditioner, and I mainly want shower gel. I took my friend downstairs at night, and the worker was repairing the blanket. The nails were in the aisle. It‚Äôs good to see, otherwise I can‚Äôt confirm whether they will be stuck.

The location is ideal. The hotel can park for free. Supplies and hair dryers are still available
Some management details are still a bit unsatisfactory. For example, spending more than 1,000 yuan to stay in a hotel gave me an experience of a few hundred yuan hotel, which still feels bad. In terms of breakfast, it is saltier than other hotels, there are too many people, and the dishes are not updated in time. Some dishes feel that they have been prepared for a long time and brought up)

Said it is a birthday gift for a friend! Including Xiaolong, Chris, the spa karina, and crystal are very enthusiastic to provide services!

The welcoming front desk upgraded me to a large room with invincible views and excellent hotel service. The breakfast is also very rich. As one of the two tallest hotels in Guangzhou, Rosewood is more private and four seasons more business. The magnificent design is updated and more fashionable, and the four seasons are more value-added! Both are worth experiencing.

msg:Advantages: The scenery meets expectations, it is very clean, the epidemic prevention is well done, and the large bathtub next to the floor-to-ceiling windows is very popular
The hotel itself is also very beautiful, there is a bar on the top floor with a direct view of the Canton Tower

Disadvantages: There are few value-added services, takeaways cannot be delivered, and you have to get them yourself
The design of the room makes me feel that the hotel does everything...
Some bad locations can also come out to open a room, see the last picture...I was told that other rooms were booked and could not be changed. This bedroom is really nothing, and the price makes me feel a little bit lax.
The swimming pool is small and requires an appoin**ent, and there is no swimming cap that will not be given. These are not informed in advance.

Suggest:
When booking a room directly book the specific room number
You must wear a swimming cap if you want to go to the pool

Overall, the hotel's facilities are very good and the service is very considerate. The room attendant found that I like coffee and added coffee in time, as well as welcome fruit. Swimming alone in the high-altitude swimming pool is also a very satisfying experience. Because the hotel specially sent a small cake for my birthday, we booked the small cake in advance, the hotel delivered the small cake to the sky in advance, the guests do not need to be low-cost, we booked in advance to see the view of the small waist . The two-day holiday was very enjoyable, the only thing I had to complain about was the music of Tianba, which was really bad. It can be said that even the music level of ordinary bars or cafes has not reached the level. This is even more incompatible with the distinctive bar of a five-star hotel. I hope the hotel can improve it.

In the end, I chose the old luxury hotel Guangzhou to experience the Four Seasons for one night, because this year is the sixth anniversary of my husband and I. , Just after booking a room, the hotel‚Äôs guest experience director pobby immediately added WeChat to ask about your personal requirements and preferences. The hotel attaches great importance to the physical examination of the guests. I said that this year‚Äôs anniversary is more important. I only hope that I can help prepare a small cake and card during my stay. After I checked in, pobby arranged and designed the room for me. I never expected it. To my surprise, it was really great, and it surpassed expectations. Flowers, cakes, fruit plates, everything is very attentive. When I first checked in, I arranged a swimming pool for me, and I really paid attention to the needs of guests everywhere. When checking in, the staff was also very Nice. Seeing that there were too many people in the lobby on the 70th floor, they were directly arranged to check in at the executive lounge on the 99th floor. Miss Hellen also arranged the type of apar**ent she wanted very nicely during the stay. , Many needs can be met one by one, my husband likes Bluetooth speakers, like Bulgari toiletries, personally arrange staff to deliver to the room, there are many small details, when turning the bed, he is very careful and will help You arrange the messy clothes and put in a few more bottles of mineral water. There are really not many hotels with such care. Next time you are out, you will choose Guangzhou Four Seasons. Thank you for making us have an unforgettable night.

It is very intelligent and advanced. The toiletries are also very advanced. The bathtub is also just right. Looking at the view from the window, the room is very spacious and bright, really great

The bed was very soft and comfortable, the coffee was also given 4, the tea was also good, and the welcome fruit was 3 apples, which was okay~
The gym and swimming pools are very good, with complete equipment, not many people, and the swimming pool water temperature is slightly lower, although it is not big, it is enough for swimming

Many people say that breakfast is average, the price is 188, and what kind of bicycles do I want? How do I think it‚Äôs good. Breakfast is served on the 72nd floor. It is next to the window and you can see the Guangzhou Tower. The scenery is very good. This experience is worth 188. , The meals are quite rich, including Chinese food, Western food, morning tea, and fruits.
Dick eggs, cheese, egg rolls, salmon, Italian ham, barbecued pork buns, glutinous rice chicken, noodles, and so on. They can‚Äôt be eaten at all, but the desserts are not rich, only bread croissants, no cakes, biscuits, etc. Small desserts, I think the others are pretty good~

Service: Needless to say, the service is very, very good. The service staff are very visionary and of high quality. They speak very softly and very nicely. They help me take a taxi, help me take my luggage, and help me check out after 1 hour. Talkative

There are not many snacks nearby, they are all restaurants, and I have to go to Beijing Road and Shangxiajiu to eat, but I don‚Äôt want to go out when I enter the hotel because it‚Äôs so comfortable

I have been entangled with the beauty and the four seasons. Looking at the evaluation, it is said that the service is not good. The four seasons are set for insurance. The result is too satisfactory and the price is very suitable. I hope that the quality of the four seasons will be maintained, and I will live in the future.

During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the hotel also delivered moon cakes and fruits! Very sweet!
In short, we realize that the accommodation conditions, service standards, surrounding environment, and variety of food at Four Seasons Hotel in Guangzhou are the best choices for vacation and business in Guangzhou.
The hotel already has a parent-child room, and our kids have already taken a fancy to it!

msg:This is the first time to write such a long comment. Many feelings
Let me talk about the advantages first, the service is not picky, and all the staff are very professional. It is understandable that I haven't been able to check in until 12 o'clock a day on the Mid-Autumn Festival. Because the executive lounge service is included, some staff take the wife to the executive lounge to rest, and I take the children to swim. After finishing the room card, send it to the executive lounge. After the afternoon tea, I went back to the room and the baby cot was not ready. I think it's understandable that it is too late to prepare in order to quickly clean and hand over the house. So when the phone asked for preparation again, he responded promptly and sent a full set of children's products and small dolls.
Let me talk about regrets. When I arrived at the front desk, I was told that the children‚Äôs play area is only available for winter and summer vacations. For children under six years old, there is no other place to consume energy except for swimming, so they can only go to the surrounding area. It is not clear when the outer glass spiderman was last cleaned. The landscape, especially the swimming pool, has a slight impact (see photos), but the high-level cleaning operations are risky and costly. It is understandable that the entire building must be unified. The bed linen wakes up in the middle of the night and the quilt cover is separated from the quilt (the four corners of the quilt and the quilt cover are not fixed). This is crazy, but the child is already asleep and I don't want to wake up the child. This detail greatly affects the sleep experience. If I was alone, I would get up and sort it out by myself. The quilt is very thick, and the air conditioner needs to be turned on below 20¬∞C to cover it comfortably, but children do not dare to open it too cold, so I slept very hot, and finally covered it with a bathrobe. It would be great if a quilt of suitable thickness is available.
In summary, it is clearly positioned as a high-end business travel hotel. As a parent-child hotel, it is not suitable for children under 6 years old.

Since friends invited to the bar on the 70th floor to enjoy the night view, I wanted to have a living experience.
It coincides with the Chinese Valentine's Day, and booked a room with a bathtub by the window, which is indeed an excellent choice. Enjoy the night view of the city while taking a bath. The tranquil a**osphere is perfect for thinking about things.
A little afraid of heights but can't resist the beautiful night view outside the big French windows.

msg:1. The hotel guest service is considerate and thoughtful, and there is a special person (Miss Lucky) responsible for communicating with me in advance and helping to solve the problem.
2. The hotel has complete facilities, and the staff in each service facility are low-key but warm and thoughtful, helping guests solve problems without disturbing them.
3. The minor problem encountered is that there are some uncivilized and impolite guests in the hotel, but the hotel service staff has not taken the initiative to stop the behavior of the guests, such as the buffet where the guests directly use a fork to eat in front of the food, and The hotel should take the initiative to deal with the situation where the loud mobile phone video affects the surrounding area.

msg:The location of the hotel is very good. The lobby on the 70th floor offers a panoramic view of the Zhujiang New Town. Starting from the parking lot, the service of all the staff is very warm and thoughtful, meticulous and patient. The only regret is that the cleanliness of the carpet in the room needs to be improved and the bed is too soft.

msg:The view is very good and the waiters are very polite. Knowing that bringing children took the initiative to make a cute lamb room card for the children. Although it was just a simple move, it was very heartwarming. Check-in and check-out are fast. The room equipment is French Oulong, which smells good. The big bathtub faces the window, and the night of the Pearl River is in sight. Room service is very responsive. But the area that needs to be improved is: there is no turn-down, and there are fewer breakfast options.

Sitting on the big sofa in the living room, beside the desk, you can enjoy the beautiful view of Guangzhou's core area. The floor is actually higher than the surrounding hotels. Really, low-key luxury.

I saw rose petals, fruits and champagne as well as handwritten exquisite greetings when I walked in. I was very moved. The scenery at night is also very moving. The location is quite good!

msg:Self-driving from Shenzhen to Guangzhou, staying in four seasons for the beauty of Xiaomanyao!
criticism:
1. The parking lot in West Tower doesn't like it very much, it's really too tight!
2. The floor lamp next to the window was not installed properly, and it came across when the curtain was drawn, and it almost hit someone. Finally moved away by the housekeeper
3. When I took a bath at night, I found that the switch was turned too deadly. I called the waiter for a long time without seeing anyone, but I finally turned it on!
4. There is a small TV in the bathroom mirror, but my room will crash when I use it, so I can't use it at all!
praise:
1. The front desk gave the child a special room card for children, which the child loves!
2. Ask the customer service to pick up a pair of children's slippers, and were asked how old the child is, and took a pair of suitable size!
3. The children's bathrobe inside is very comfortable. The child changes the bathrobe and goes to the swimming pool, saying that this bathrobe is the most comfortable nightgown he wears
4. Knowing that I have taken my children in, I specially prepared children's toiletries, very attentive and thoughtful!
5. There is a multi-purpose mobile phone charging cable on the desk. It is free to use. It is not the kind that scans the code and pays. I think this is very intimate!
6. Although the swimming pool is small, the service is really attentive. There are always staff reminding guests to wear shoes to prevent falling!
Suggest:
1. For luxury hotels, it would be better if the curtains can be opened electrically!

msg:I added some money and upgraded the river view room, which is great value for money. The hotel is in the IFC financial center, which is the West Tower, and there is a parking lot for easy parking. Looking out from the room on the 86th floor, you can see the Pearl River and the Canton Tower. The scenery is unobstructed. Because of the children with you, the hotel is very considerate to send an extra set of toiletries

msg:I have stayed in Guangzhou Four Seasons for the third time in four years, but every time the experience is better than the last time, Four Seasons is still the ceiling of Guangzhou's luxury hotels and it is difficult to be surpassed.

Check-in: I came to celebrate my family‚Äôs birthday, so I noted in advance that I want a better room in the tower. The hotel not only sent cakes, but also helped to upgrade the noble tower view directly to a suite facing the tower. I gave a big surprise during CI, thanks to the front desk Viky and the hotel team.

Room: Invincible Tower View + Spacious Space. The rooms of the four seasons can indeed see some traces left by the years. After all, it has been opened for 9 years, but the space from ordinary rooms to suites is spacious, far more comfortable than the high-rise Internet celebrity hotel next to it. Not to mention the invincible tower view of the suite. The living room looks ordinary during the day, but it is very enjoyable to watch the European Cup/movies with the lights off at night. The Samsung TV works well and has good sound insulation.

Breakfast: Although the hotel delivered breakfast, I did not experience it because I asked someone to drink tea, nor did I experience the Michelin Yu Yuexuan, but when I checked in on Saturday, I said that it was fully booked, so I left it for next time.

From software to hardware to tower view, Four Seasons Guangzhou is the most worthy hotel in Guangzhou hotels, looking forward to the next experience.

msg:During the epidemic, there were few people and helped us upgrade the noble tower view room, which is room 09 and 93 floor directly facing the Canton Tower! Because I was here for my birthday, the hotel gave me a little cake and fruit, but the children's supplies written in the remarks did not help me prepare! The restaurant only opened the Chinese restaurant on the 71st floor and the Italian restaurant on the 72nd floor. We chose Yizhen. There were not many people on Saturday night, and there was a reservation in the afternoon, and we were transferred to the window in the back. The room was ready for 3 o'clock, and we postponed our check-out until 2 o'clock the next day.

The Four Seasons Hotel with temperature has provided me with a safe haven for repeatedly changing and canceling flights, and the check-out luxury has been extended to 16pm. The hotel location is always appreciated by Xiaoyan Waiguangzhou Tower, the room is bright and tidy, especially the bedding. The breakfast is more bright and exquisite.

msg:The Four Seasons Hotel is as always. The service is very good. The four seasons of Guangzhou are more unique in its environmental advantages. Its swimming pool is relatively popular, the environment is well adjusted, and the vision is very good, and you can see the Guangzhou Tower. As for the breakfast, it is also great, with a wide view, and there are candy carts for the children, the children are very happy. The gym has the same big vision. The whole is relatively quiet and people are not cluttered, which is quite satisfactory. If you go to Guangzhou again, you will definitely be the first choice to live again.
