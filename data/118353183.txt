msg:The hotel is surrounded by beautiful environment and very quiet at night. The hotel is big, big, big. Only the 2nd and 3rd floors are rooms. The state-owned enterprise has invested heavily in the development. It is still very cost-effective to stay at the current price. It may be because it is newly opened. I feel that the staff in all aspects are not proficient. The breakfast is only 4-star standard and not rich enough. I don’t know if it is because there are few people at the beginning (but the front desk informed that it was fully booked on the day)
Facilities: Hard standard meets 5-star standards (toto bathroom, JBL Bluetooth speakers, Serta mattress (there is no coffee machine in the room and no gym is seen
Hygiene: There is hair in the bathroom of the room,
Environment: The surrounding area is quiet and leisurely.
Service: At present, it feels that it is only 4-star standard, which is different from international 5-star chain hotels (hopefully only for now)

msg:Very satisfied! The newly opened hotel 🏨 has a very arrogant and magnificent appearance. The state-owned enterprise's handwriting is definitely not comparable to ordinary chain hotels. Manager Zhang and Xiao Tan at the front desk are warm and thoughtful. Praise 👍The room is spacious and bright, and the intelligent furniture configuration is great! The view outside the window, especially the night view, is beautiful. The only complaint is that the room has a decoration smell, which is inevitable for new hotels? Xiao Liu in the restaurant is polite, enthusiastic and empathetic, which makes people feel like spring breeze. The breakfast variety is rich, but unfortunately I didn't eat hot dry noodles. 😄When I left the hotel, I had a good chat with Xiao Zeng (?) supervisor, and I was happy 😆If I have the opportunity to come to Yichang again, I will choose to stay again.

msg:The location is good. Although it is in Dianjun District, it is very convenient to drive to CBD and Wujiagang, which takes only ten minutes. The price set during holidays is very nice compared to ordinary hotels in the city center, and the cost performance is very high. The room is large and spacious, and the scenery outside the window is very pleasant. There is a small refrigerator in the room. If you want to drink a little beer, you don’t have to find ice cubes. There is an ice bucket in the room refrigerator. You can quickly arrange ice cubes by calling the front desk. The sound insulation between the rooms is also very good, but the conversations in the corridor can still be heard in the room. Personally, I think the bad thing may be that there is nothing to eat nearby.

msg:The hotel is newly opened, the facilities are very new, and many areas are not open yet. The front desk staff is quite unskilled in their business, and it takes less than half an hour to check in; the room is quite large, especially the washing space is very ample; there is a sofa in the room, the bedding is generally comfortable for sleeping, the immersion is not good, and the room is not smart. The biggest problem is that the hardware level in the room is worrying. I don’t know if the lamps in the room are intermittently lit or extinguished due to contact problems or control problems. At one o'clock in the middle of the night, I couldn’t stand it and asked the duty staff to deal with it. The duty staff responded slowly, and the maintenance staff provided slow service. Finally, I had to change the room. The room I changed was a mahjong room that had just been cleaned. The smell of smoke was super heavy. I could only bear it and barely fall asleep. It was a very bad night experience!

The security is even more weird. On rainy days, you can't park at the hotel gate when waiting for children to come out, and there must be no cars at the door. Do you think black cars are soliciting passengers at your door?

但是九點鐘去吃早餐，明檔就已經收了，是否太早了。自助區的東西也所剩無幾且不再上新了，所以早餐感覺有點匹配不上酒店的檔次。另外前台和客房的服務態度都比較冷淡，可能是培訓還不太到位。

衞生：房間整體比較整潔，衞生間佈局細節有待考量，不夠人性化，房型的隔音效果不佳，基本能聽到外面清晰的話音，中央空調製冷效果欠佳，有明顯的風燥，還是影響到睡眠質量，整體細節與豪華酒店有很大差距。
