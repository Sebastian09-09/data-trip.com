msg:We came back from Singapore to visit relatives and stayed at this Zengcheng Wanda Realm Hotel for the first time. Ms. June and Molly at the reception were very friendly and professional. Meanwhile, for the executive suite we originally booked, but we are very grateful to a lobby manager wearing glasses who helped us upgrade more higher level room and provided a series of services to make it more convenient for us. Thank you so much to all the service staff of this hotel for their patience and excellent service, they bring us the feelings just like we arrived the homeland!We stayed a total of 6 nights in two rooms. We booked separately through Singapore Trip. Unfortunately the breakfasts were ignored for two days, but the front desk manager of the hotel still provided us with a great dim sum breakfast, which was very warm. ! Through the wonderful vacation experience we will decide to book this hotel without any doubt when we come back 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

從新加坡回來探親第一次入住這間增城萬達嘉華，前台阿June和Molly小姐非常友善和專業，還有我們原本預定的行政套房很感謝有一位戴眼鏡的大堂經理幫我們無償升級了房間並且提供一系列讓我們更加便利的服務，感謝這間酒店的所有服務人員的接待與優質服務讓我們有種賓至如歸之感！我們一共入住6晚x兩間房，是通過新加坡Trip分開來預定的，結果有兩日的早餐被忽略掉了，但酒店的前台經理還是依舊為我們提供了美好的的小點心早餐，非常溫馨！通過此次入住我們決定以後每次回來都會直接預定這家酒店👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

Welcome cookies are yummy and cold welcome drink was also nice in the hot weather. ￼

My kids enjoyed the outdoor swimming pool. It was not so big but just enough to play.
If the swimming pool has clothes squeezer and some plastic bags, it will be much nicer. 

The breakfast was also great. Good quality of noodles and bread, drink and other hot and clod food. 

I visited the dinner buffet, it was also very nice. Sea food is so fresh and other food was delicious. 

I will definitely visit here next time again.

When I checked in, Lucy kindly reminded us that Zengcheng had already been warned of a yellow rainstorm. When going out, please bring an umbrella and pay attention to safety. It made me feel very considerate.
Also, when the child came back from playing and took a shower, he found a rough scratch on his back and it was bleeding. Then he called the front desk a few minutes later, and Manager Chen immediately brought the medicine box to help the child treat the wound. The action was very gentle and careful. This speed and handling method made me feel that the hotel valued us very much.
If I have the opportunity to come to Zengcheng next time, I will choose you again😊

The hotel called me the next day to confirm and help reserve the room. When I checked in at the hotel, the front desk guy was very happy when he knew he was a test taker. He enthusiastically reminded us of traffic conditions and other related conditions, and helped provide breakfast coupons. The room was also very clean, quiet and no noise. Thank you for the hotel's service!

The most important thing is that Ada and Ayun at the front desk answer all questions. They are not only attentive and patient, but also very efficient in check-in. The service is really great! There is a business district around the hotel, and there is a row of food stalls to choose from at night. The price/performance ratio is very high in Zengcheng District. I will choose this hotel again in the future!

msg:The experience is quite good. The hotel is located in Zengcheng District, Guangzhou. The location is very convenient. Across the road downstairs are shopping malls, supermarkets, fruit shops and other shops. The nearest subway station is about one kilometer away in a straight line. The starting price is a taxi or a shared electric scooter. Just go there. The room is clean and tidy, with a small refrigerator. It is very comfortable to stay. Kevin at the front desk was also very good at check-in and helped coordinate the rooms for several friends. I've been to Guangzhou several times before. This time I didn't want to live in the downtown area of ​​Guangzhou, so I did some research and finally chose this place. The hotel is equipped with an outdoor swimming pool and a 24-hour gym, but the swimming pool is at room temperature outdoors, so the weather is not so good. If it suits you, I suggest you go to the gym. Breakfast starts at 7:00 and ends at 10:00. The breakfast variety is relatively complete, and the dining environment is very good. Recommended to stay! ! !

msg:After staying for one day, the experience was very poor. The free park ticket required me to drive to the shopping mall outside. The free ticket required me to pick fruits. It took half an hour to drive to the orchard, and the gas cost was more expensive than the fruit. There is a small outdoor swimming pool in the hotel, but there is no attendant to look after it, and there are no towels or hairdryers. When the children finished swimming and took a bath, I couldn't find a towel, so I went to the front desk to ask for a towel. It took me 20 minutes to find one. I was given a towel, but the child was shivering from the cold. During this period, I called the service contact number at the entrance of the swimming pool, but it was said that there was no related service. It's very speechless. For a brand hotel, the swimming pool is an important facility, but there is no service, and even the basic respect for guests cannot be done.

No, when I checked out, Xiao Xue at the front desk asked me how my stay was, so I reported the situation to him and recorded a video of the abnormal noise for him to review. He took it very seriously, apologized and even sent me a song. Qi Biscuits recorded the problems I encountered and said that they would follow up and improve. Very sincere, I am satisfied with this service attitude. Another problem is that the water pressure in the bath in the room is very low. I hope it can be improved next time you stay.

The door is only about 50 centimeters away from the bed. The bathroom has no door close to the bed. I used a plastic bathroom curtain, but it can't block the door opening and the sound. It's not like this in a budget hotel~ The surrounding construction site is estimated to be under construction for at least five years. Good luck in the future. Don't plan to stay here again. The market price of 558 I set is 472~ There is no way to evacuate decisively today~

There is still room for improvement in terms of service. For example, the opening hours of the swimming pool are irregular, which is very awkward. During the National Day, on a hot day in Guangdong, it was not open in the morning and evening. It was opened at 11 noon and closed at 6 o'clock in the evening... I also went back to the hotel at night and told the front desk that two more bottles of water would be delivered, but they were not delivered until 11 o'clock. , it is not appropriate if the guest has already rested.

It was the first time I met the waitress A Juan when I went to the coffee room. Seeing her, I quickly notified the kitchen master to place the order, because glass or tiles cannot be placed next to the swimming pool , she immediately informed me that it is safer to arrange takeaway containers to hold food, and she is also very careful when delivering food with rubber gloves, which saves me trouble when eating chicken rolls, and also arranges Alipay mobile phone instant checkout, no need for me Then go to the lobby to find the number; and my wife and I often receive her hospitality and hospitality during breakfast, which makes us have a very pleasant journey.

I heard that the hot springs here are good, but I just don’t have time to experience them.
Currently, many of the newly opened Doubletree series do not have executive lounges, which is a bit unaccustomed to them.

The lighting design is not bad, but the lack of success is that the water for bathing is not big enough ➕ The bathroom hygiene cannot be carefully checked, there will be small sloppy places
But it's quite ok to live in Hilton at this price. The price is worthy of the quality

In addition, the cleaning service is also very good, and the whole room is very clean and tidy.

Especially the front desk clerk Harry Huang left a deep impression on me. He was very welcoming and made sure I had the best possible stay. He gave me a lot of useful advice and answered all my questions. He was extremely hospitable and went out of his way to provide me with exceptional service, which I am very grateful for.

I have never met such a good waiter. I heard snoring in the middle of the night and changed rooms. We didn't get an upgrade. When I checked out, the kid said the cookies were delicious. I asked the waiter to give him another cookie, but he didn't give it to me. He said he couldn't give more to each room. I immediately stopped talking and walked to the lobby to wait for the bus. After a few minutes, the handsome guy came over with two cookies and said that today's quantity and number of rooms should be enough, so I will give you two more cookies. I am still very grateful to him. The breakfast I am looking forward to is eggs, not meat and pastries. Is it a must-have for the five-star breakfast buffet? I’m super disappointed.

The overall impression is the hotel's service. All the staff are very friendly and professional. They can meet our needs in a timely manner with a good attitude, which makes people feel at ease. There are farms and *** pastures near the hotel. It will be fun for children to play

But the parking lot is really too dark, it would be better if there are more lights and instructions
There is another thing I have to complain about. The hotel’s buffet is really cheap. This time I experienced the buffet dinner and breakfast. The food supply area is very small, and more than 80% are semi-finished products. The quality of seafood is very ordinary. I even saw diners taking it with bare hands. Lobster...the hot dish area is even more...hmm
I feel that the buffet in KTV is better than this...

Because a child is over 1.4 years old, it is understandable to ask for the price difference, but paying 198 for dinner at 1/2 of the original price of 398 is depressing. There is also a price difference of NT$98 for breakfast, so we can only give up breakfast for one person. The food is not worth 398 at all. There are so many people and it’s noisy. It won't matter if you go later. I regret buying this package.

msg:Personally, I feel that as a five-star hotel, it is unacceptable that there is dust under the bed, the water in the washbasin cannot flow for a long time, it is unacceptable, the slippers are of poor quality, and the toilet flushes too loudly. It scares me to wake up even when I fall asleep. The security service at the door to pick up the car is very good, and the waiter's attitude is also very good. I feel like the price/performance ratio is not high.

msg:1. In June, the air conditioning is not turned on in the elevator hall of the public area, which makes you feel uncomfortable;
2. The soundproofing of the room is extremely poor, which is equivalent to no soundproofing. I can hear the noise from the residents who are separated by two rooms. I can also hear the conversations next door. Even if I lean back against the partition wall, I can clearly feel it. It's really It’s outrageous. If you are sensitive to noise, it is recommended to choose carefully.

Hearing that we didn't have a breakfast option, he warmly gave us two self-selected breakfast menus, which were delivered to the room for free the next morning. The breakfast arrangement is simply too rich! My daughter called her a happy breakfast! Because of online classes, the hotel delayed check-out until 3 pm for free. A great staying experience, I will come again if I have the opportunity!

The service was cold and without temperature. The service is not as good as the general express hotel.
In order to save energy and reduce emissions, the hotel does not turn on the air conditioner part of the time (or the occupancy rate is not high), and the room is like a sauna!

As a result, I was woken up by the heat at 4 o’clock in the morning. I called the front desk in the morning and it turned out that they were not here to fix the air-conditioning, but to measure the temperature! The air-conditioning problem has not been resolved. In the end, the hotel offered to provide free lunch. I am sorry that I did not eat it, and I will not take advantage of it. I hope that your hotel will not have such management loopholes! Bad reviews are just for you to improve your management level, that's all! The overall environment of the hotel is good!

The water pressure in the room is very low, and the hot water is not hot enough to take a shower in winter. The heating effect of the air conditioner is poor, and it blows out a cool breeze. There was no one to guide the parking, so I drove around to the door and unloaded a few large suitcases from the car. The waiter saw that there was no response. I can't believe I'm staying at the DoubleTree by Hilton. I won't stay again next time. I will choose the Hilton series carefully.

msg:We lived in room 1019, which was great. It was the first time I was so disappointed with the Hilton brand. There was thick dust on the kettle on the bar counter in the first room. Second, the plugs of the Bluetooth speakers were unplugged, and it took a long time to plug in the power supply. The Bluetooth speakers were also dusty. Third, the shower head for the shower is broken, there is no water in the front, and the water from the pipe can wet the floor outside. Fourth, the most speechless is the customer service at the front desk. Ctrip Anxinzhu also charged me a 500 deposit, which was not charged the second time I went. Not trained? Well, all kinds of complaints to the front desk are rejected. Ask him if there are not many people today, can you upgrade to a room with a better view, she said something even more speechless, our hotel has no environment, and there are buildings around. Fifth, it took me fifteen minutes to wait for the elevator. When we all want to take the stairs, the idea of wanting to take the stairs for the first time in a five-star hotel is not ironic. Sixth, let me scan the parking code when I checked out. The store manager is constantly recording my feedback, and then I didn’t see clearly that I paid the parking fee, and she didn’t refund it. Seventh, when I went to the store when it first opened, there were security guards everywhere, but this time there was no service staff. Eighth, there is obviously a robot at the front desk, but the robot is not allowed to deliver it, but you are asked to go down and get it. Well, I gave so many suggestions, but I didn't cooperate at all. I didn't give any feedback or discount even after recording. Sooner or later the Hilton brand is done here.

環境方面：還可以，外面裝修挺好看的，但是房間設施很普通，在增城區這個地方，快700塊錢的房間這種裝修，屬實坑了。
服務方面：一般。前台小姐姐沒有提前告知我們房間的門直通走廊，按理説，這種情況應該提前告知的。
設施方面：停車場很不錯，但是早餐種類普通，味道也一般，不如東滙城的伊士高酒店，伊士高酒店每次長輩來都會入住，這一次想選一個新酒店嘗試一下，沒想到這麼失望，價格貴了近200塊，住起來卻是這種感覺。反正下次不會再選了，依然會選擇伊士高，確實很失望。增城好不容易來一個相對較高檔的酒店，卻是這樣的，大失所望。

先説缺點。
1.衞生狀況一塌糊塗，地上到處黏糊糊的，黏到我老公都無法忍受蹲在地上擦地的程度，衞生間浴缸、毛巾也都是頭髮。
2.設施差到令人震驚，趕上廣東降温結果空調吹的是冷風，問前台説是施工的時候設定錯誤了，要調成製冷模式就是熱風了，衹能相信調成了製冷模式，結果還是冷風。酒店讓工程人員來看，搞了半天也沒搞好，然後説他回去打電話問問廠家，結果也沒有問到，最後搞到1點多沒有辦法了給拿了一個暖風機。
優點：
1.酒店很新。
2.服務人員服務態度很好，雖然問題沒解決但是一直積極對應。

凌晨5點拿多張被子，居然客服問我是不是馬上需要被子，也聯繫不上房務人員。可能剛開業沒多久，服務人員需要培訓下。
平時住開黃埔的翡翠希爾頓覺得特別好，這次來廣州就換一間希爾頓試試，截然不同。翡翠希爾頓打掃衞生的人員連我的衣服都會疊，看到有小孩自動補充小童用品。
碧桂園希爾頓特色雙人首輪mini吧免費，不過你連住不出聲，就不給你補第二天的了。
