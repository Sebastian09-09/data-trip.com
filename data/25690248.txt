msg:We are a family of 5 and struggled to find suitable accommodation. We found Orientino and decided to give it a try. We were DEFINITELY not disappointed. It is an amazing services apartment with all the needs - washing machine, coffee machine, fridge, dinning room etc...

Given we were upgraded to the 3 bedroom apartment but if the two bedroom apartment is anything to go by, its awesome. Breakfast is good and within walking distance to convenience stores and coffee shops etc.. (not in the attached mall which is only for exclusive brands).

Will definitely come back.

The hotel lobby is also stunning, and a morning stroll through the hotel’s private gardens is a must. It is conveniently located on the same subway line as tiananmen square, and there is a fair selection of restaurants in the shopping plaza across the road. Xiang Dang in the plaza is a phenomenal restaurant. The small hunan-style restaurant just opposite the hotel gate is more basic but also very good! The buffet breakfast is rather expensive for what it is, but at least they have a nice selection of both western and authentic chinese options.

I was woken up by the landline phone in the room at 2 a.m. It turned out that the waiter entered the wrong room number, causing the takeaway robot to deliver to the wrong room and keep calling. After the problem was solved, I couldn't fall asleep. I was sleepless for two or three hours and felt very uncomfortable the next day. I only stayed in the hotel for two nights and there were a series of problems.

If you check in, you must be careful or you will be embarrassed. At least it is not easy to make guests and Ctrip official customer service speechless. If you only look at the environment, you can stay. To be honest, the price-performance ratio is on the higher side in Beijing, but if you want to look at the service, please consider it carefully. After all, when there is a problem, they don't solve it at the first time, but talk to you about your problems first. It can even be said that they put all the problems on you regardless of the consequences. In the end, they told you to be happy after being slapped in the face. It's a whole confusing behavior. Anyway, maybe they think it is an honor for guests to come to their hotel.

Oh oh oh right! It is recommended to park in the B3 South Tower of the parking lot ( ´▽` )ﾉ! The North Tower is an office building! The south tower is closer to the apar**ent! The garage signs are not very clear! Everything else is very good~!

The apar**ent was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. It made me feel like I was back at home. Every corner of the apar**ent was immaculately cleaned, which made me feel very comfortable and at ease.
The service attitude of the apar**ent was very good. The front desk staff was very welcoming and made me feel very welcome. In addition, the apar**ent also provides many convenient services, such as laundry, gym, meeting rooms, etc., which are very convenient.
Overall, my impression of Beijing Kaisa Boyu Executive Apar**ent is very good. The service, facilities and location are all first-class. If you plan to come to Beijing for tourism or business trip, this is definitely a good choice.

However, I was not reminded when I checked in, so I was not given a room with a bathtub. If I am traveling with children, I hope the front desk can provide it in the future. Ask more about your needs. The overall environment is good, the service is attentive, and the kitchen facilities are excellent. It's just that the shower area has a slight sewer smell. Just a little suggestion. I arranged a car to be sent to the airport on the day I came to the store. The car waited at the entrance of the lobby for about ten minutes (normal waiting time), but the car had to go through the garage when leaving, so parking fees were incurred, but I had to pay for it myself. I called at that time. I negotiated with the front desk about whether I could get free parking. The person at the front desk said yes, but he just didn't want to deal with it. He didn't want to compete because he had to rush to the airport. I sincerely hope that the hotel can be more considerate and waive such unnecessary parking fees for guests in situations like this in the future.

This hotel will forever remain my top 1 hotel in Beijing.
In those days, the person in charge of the breakfast room had an extremely good attitude. My child’s grandparents told me, are all northerners such a good attitude? Hahahaha
Because my daily schedule is quite full, sometimes I don’t have time to find a restaurant. There are several good restaurants downstairs in the nearby skp. I can also go shopping while my kids are playing in the children’s paradise. It’s really great.
There was something wrong with the room card when I checked out at the end, which made me run up and down twice, but overall the service was very good.

msg:It was a very good experience. I only booked for 3 nights. I found that other executive apar**ents were not rated as high as Kaisa. We directly added 4 nights and stayed here for the entire 8-day and 7-night journey. Our family of 5 stayed here and booked a two-bedroom apar**ent. Yes, the hotel sees that we have a large number of people, so they directly upgrade us to a 3-bedroom. Although it is a study room, we can dry clothes in the room (the apar**ent is equipped with a washing machine and drying rack, which is much more convenient). The 3-bedroom has a better sense of space. When booking a room, my husband was always worried that only one bathroom would not be enough for 5 people. After the upgrade, there will be two bathrooms. This operation dispelled our worries. The hotel has complete facilities, high-end, a full set of Siemens home appliances, even the kitchen utensils are from Zwilling, the interior design is reasonable, clean and hygienic, and it feels like home.
The hotel is located in the center of Beijing. There is a subway entrance on the opposite side of the road. Apart from the Great Wall, it is very convenient to take the subway to other scenic spots. It is much more convenient than taking Didi (the road is always jammed). There are many choices of food and drink in the SKP shopping mall opposite. There is a supermarket, and you can go to the supermarket to buy vegetables and cook by yourself in your free time. The hotel provides breakfast for two people every day. There are many options for breakfast and the taste is delicious. On the T4-40th floor, you can eat breakfast while watching the busy Beijing city outside the window. It feels really impeccable!
Suggestion: There is a small suggestion. There are 5 of us, and we only include breakfast for two (we take turns to eat), and the other three go out for food every morning. It is inconvenient to move separately. If you want to go early, it will cost 130 yuan/person (It’s a bit expensive), and renting a two-bedroom executive apar**ent generally has at least 4 people, and it is recommended to send at least 4 people for breakfast.

The problem is not too big, but there is a shortcoming of the second room - why there is only one bathroom, and I am with friends It's really inconvenient for two families. In addition, the sanitation is a bit lacking. There is too little toilet paper, only one roll, and there are few trash cans in the room. Everything else is good. The food delivery robot is very cute, and the frozen lemonade at the front desk is delicious. Before leaving, the young lady also poured a pot for the child to take away, thank you

Adjacent to SKP, the intersection downstairs is Metro Line 1, and you can go to Tiananmen, the Forbidden City, and Wangfujing in a few stops. The staff at the front desk were very enthusiastic. Seeing that there were a lot of us, they upgraded the room type to a three-bedroom one-living room for free. The room is large, with a study room, two toilets, and a large refrigerator, oven, and microwave oven in the kitchen, all of which are from Siemens. The kitchen utensils and pots are all from Zwilling. The elderly eat relatively light food and like to cook by themselves. This place meets the requirements and all facilities are very clean. I will go to this place again when I come to Beijing in the future. The most important thing is that the service staff here are very enthusiastic and will deliver everything you need quickly. 👍👍👍

If you want two bathrooms, you have to pay extra. I changed the room after showing them the booking information. He replied that he had read it wrongly. The attitude is not good either. The room was very hot. Didn't get a good night's rest and had a very poor stay experience. There is no service to speak of.

msg:The room facilities are new and clean, and the overall area is very large, across the street from skp, the largest luxury shopping mall in Beijing. It can be said to be a ceiling-level apar**ent in Beijing.

Environment: Although it is close to skp, there is a garden in front of the lobby. Quiet and quiet, there are four rooms on the first floor, so you don't have to worry about being disturbed.

Service: Takeaway can be delivered to the room by a robot, and the concierge will send someone to deliver it when the robot can't fit it. The whole process of customer service experience is greater than that of a five-star hotel.

msg:The room facilities are okay, not very new but well-equipped. But I have never stayed in a hotel with such poor service.

We booked for a total of six nights. The first two nights I felt a faint smell of oil smoke in the room, so I thought it would be too troublesome to move rooms so I endured it. On the third night, the good guy felt like he was living in the kitchen. The smell was so strong that he couldn't sleep. At around 9pm, we called the front desk to ask us to change rooms. We agreed at first that it was too late and the things in the old room could be packed away the next morning. After a while, he suddenly called us and told us to move quickly and that we had to move that night because "the hotel will bear the loss of operating income." Excuse me? Are you afraid that no other guests will be able to enjoy this kitchen-like environment? Or are you crazy about money and think that customers should pay for your mistakes? Or do you think that we like to move a room with a baby and a toddler at night? They moved us to a room on a lower floor and I didn't say anything. The whole attitude was as if we wished we could apologize to the hotel. This kind of weird experience is really rare.

I really wanted to give the service a negative score but unfortunately there is no such option. The other scores were scored objectively while enduring nausea.

The hotel room service is also very good. Knowing that we are staying for four people, we will replenish many bottles of water every day. The concierge and the security at the gate are also very polite.
The fly in the oin**ent is that the shower room is not well sealed, and a lot of water will seep out after taking a shower.

msg:Accompanying the elderly for surgery requires staying in Beijing for a period of time. Considering that staying in a hotel for a long time lacks the feeling of home and it is inconvenient to take care of the elderly, I decided to rent a hotel-style apar**ent.
   It was an accident to choose Kaisa Platinum, and after the accident, it is a joy and surprise.
   The location is very good, just above the Skp South Building at the intersection of Dawang Road. It is very convenient for shopping and eating around. When checking in at the front desk, the staff enthusiastically introduced the various services of the hotel in detail. The room is very spacious, complete with electrical appliances, and there are many types of tableware in the kitchen, which fully meets the requirements of the host. Manager Du at the front desk of the hotel also gave us a lot of care, thank you very much.
  The breakfast room is also a bright spot. Although the variety of dishes is not as wide as that of five-star hotels, it is better in taste, less but more refined. After staying for one night, I decisively extended the order and stayed for 10 days. Next time I come to Beijing for a review, I will definitely come again.

In short, it is highly recommended to those friends who travel with the elderly and children.

The floor is clean and the sink is free of water stains. Check in fruit fresh and tasty. The quilt and bed linen in the room are clean and tidy. Parking is very convenient. It's downstairs in skp-s. When you check in, you can save the fare by telling the front desk your license plate number. It's very considerate. The front desk staff are very nice and responsive. And the cleaning is very timely, and it is as good as before. The hotel's breakfast is delicious, with a wide variety of varieties, and the service in the restaurant is also very good. The location is very good and it is very convenient to go everywhere. The room is very comfortable to live in, and each space is air-conditioned. The bed was really comfortable and it was very refreshing after work. Takeaways can be delivered by robots. Generally speaking, the service, environment, facilities, and meals of the entire Kaisa Apar**ent are comparable to 5-star hotels. The price is reasonable, the service is in place, and the accommodation is comfortable. It is an excellent place for tourism and business trips in Beijing. I will choose Kaisa Apar**ent every time in the future, and I hope the apar**ent will get better and better.

When I arrived, I said it was not available. The person who delivered the things in the room said that the room was not full. I wanted it. The room type I wanted was available, and I specifically informed the front desk that the room type I wanted was available. After staying there for a week, there was no response until I checked out. The floor drain in the shower room was very slow. I contacted the front desk, but it was still blocked. I called the front desk every time. , I am not very impatient after a week. This is the third time I have stayed here. The previous time, I was asked to give a five-star review or else the service would not be served. I said I would complain. I was afraid of being complained, so I was given two power banks and said a lot of good things. I didn’t mention it in the last review. Regarding this matter, I didn’t expect to feel so bad this time. I will comment truthfully for your reference.

I stood next to the rice cooker with my four-year-old child in my arms and told him about the condition of the rice cooker. He wanted to go to the rice cooker to have a look, and I used a rude tone. Anyone who says "get out of my way" to me will feel uncomfortable. Firstly, he is here because there is a problem with the rice cooker. Secondly, it shows no empathy for me to speak in such a tone while holding a child, let alone service. consciousness. After the maintenance worker left, I called the front desk to report it. The front desk heard me halfway and then went to talk to someone else. Suddenly there was no sound on the other end of the phone. It turns out that the entire hotel has the same service level. Not only do you need to improve your service awareness and level, but you also need to learn to respect others (the basic principles of life).

The staff has a good service attitude and basically responds to requests. Our two families were traveling, four adults and two children. The front desk offered to help us upgrade for free. We asked for a late check-out the next day and readily agreed. We were very touched. From check-in to check-out, the front desk is not a group of people, and everyone makes us feel like a spring breeze, which is super good. This is the first time I saw a room that actually exceeded the picture. As mentioned in previous comments, Siemens appliances, Zwilling kitchen utensils, etc., are not perfunctory in hardware and software. Quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, the bedding is very comfortable, and passers-by have turned fans from then on. If you have to pick a bone, the design of the sink and bathtub is not very good, you need to manually buckle it up, which is not particularly friendly. It would be perfect if you can add some aromatherapy.

You need to swipe your card in the elevator, and there is a children's playground on the third floor. The takeaways are all delivered by robots, and if there are too many items, the waiters will send them directly upstairs.

msg:This is my first time writing a hotel review. If I don’t write it, it will be a good review. Let’s talk about the advantages first: it is really convenient to travel with the elderly and children, and you can spend a lot of time in the living room. Let’s talk about service: basically there is no service. Arrived at 2:30 pm, the room had just been cleaned, and the toiletries were said to be delivered later, but there was no result. I called the front desk at around 6 pm and asked: Have you used them? Obviously nothing was given. Second: Regarding food delivery, build a robot. If the food cannot be delivered downstairs in 15 minutes, you must go downstairs and get it yourself. Then came the cleaning. The next day, it was not cleaned at 3 pm, so I called the front desk. After half an hour, they basically just threw out the trash, and didn't change the sheets or anything, just tidied it up. As for the facilities, they are very average. The bathroom shower room drains very slowly. After 3 minutes of taking a shower, water starts to accumulate and water is everywhere. Then I went to the store to pay a deposit of 2,000. As of the time of comment, it has been 22 hours since I checked out and the deposit has not been refunded. not feeling good. Generally speaking, if you are traveling with the elderly and children and can book a hotel suite, it is better to book a hotel suite.

The room service is very attentive and meticulous, order more water, slippers and capsules, and they will be delivered quickly. Sometimes the concierge department is overwhelmed, and the waiter's little sister brings me a box of horses, which makes me panic. Roll call and praise Aunt Zhang for cleaning. , the name has the word Yan.
The facilities are also very good, there are two big TVs, it is very convenient for me to connect to the switch or watch movies on my computer; the capsule coffee machine and refrigerator are also very good.
Small suggestion: There is not even a power supply here in the restaurant😂, it is not convenient for office work. What if I don't have a mop ***** to pull power from the coffee machine?

msg:All aspects are five-star level, and the rooms have Siemens refrigerators, washing machines, ovens, Panasonic rice cookers, Zwilling kitchen utensils and tableware; the space is also super large, starting from 120 square meters; the living room and bedrooms have TVs and JBL stereos , you can watch CNBC/CNN/HBO/NHK and other radio stations; the small garden on the first floor downstairs may be known to few people, and it feels like a private garden with mountains, water, pavilions, and various fruit trees; the parking lot is shared with SKP-S , I stopped the car once and felt like I went to an auto show. Bentley, Lamborghini, and Aston Martin are all neighbors in my parking space. I am very nervous when reversing; all kinds of small items are also big brands, tory burch pillows, Aromatherapy care products, Paris bubbles Water and ******* mineral water; breakfast is on the 40th floor, there are many Cantonese dim sums, which are very suitable for my appetite, chicken feet in soy sauce, barbecued pork, steamed dumplings, etc., and the restaurant has very few people, maybe because of the epidemic, more people packed into the room to eat a little more.
But there are also some questions and suggestions:
1. The room needs to be pulled out to open the door. I am used to pushing the door, which led to the first time I thought there was a problem with the room card and went to the front desk. The enthusiastic waiter accompanied me to the room to find out the problem. I think other guests have similar problems. A note on the door.
2. The trash can in the kitchen area is hidden in the corner of the refrigerator, which is not easy to find. As a result, the kitchen waste is filled with the small trash can in the living room, and the large trash can near the refrigerator is only found before checking out.
3. There is no door chain lock in the room. Although you need to swipe your room card to enter and exit the elevator, you are used to using the door chain lock before going to bed in hotels, and you need to open the door from the outside. There is still a device that can be locked. Peace of mind to sleep.

Two girls booked a big bed room and asked the front desk to give us a quilt. Actually told me that they don't have extra quilts. Every room comes standard with a quilt! ! ! If you only have one quilt, don't open a hotel. What about Ctrip?
And the man who answered the phone at the front desk had the same service tone as the waiter in a luxury store who looked down on customers. Yin and Yang are weird.

advantage:
1. The room is super large, 120 square meters, and the space is second to the Ritz-Carlton opposite the same price.
2. There is a kitchen - this facility is particularly important during the epidemic, and rice cookers, ovens, pots, knives, and tableware are readily available. You only need to bring ingredients, and there is a large refrigerator.
3. The hotel has a private garden with an elegant environment, with water, rockeries and pavilions. The main reason is that there are almost no people (the reason for not being outside). During the epidemic, you can take off your mask and enjoy the outdoors, and it is rare in this kind of location.
4. Free parking, you can enter and exit freely after checking in and reporting the license plate number at the front desk, and there are sufficient parking spaces (shared parking lot with SKP-S)
5. The TV programs are rich, and the major radio stations in the world are basically covered. The first few channels are CNN, NBC, NHK, Singapore CNA, Phoenix Satellite TV, etc. The last is CCTV.
6. The service attitude is good. All the staff meet and greet each other, and see a child who sent a fruit. Booking from Ctrip is not unwelcome as stated in the previous message.
insufficient:
1. There is a lack of swimming pool, but there is a gym. I only visited it. It is located on the 37th-38th floor of Unit 4. It is a little small, but the scenery outside the window is very good.
2. The apar**ent is divided into 4 units. The breakfast is located on the 40th floor of the 4th unit. I live on the 24th floor of the 1st unit. It is a little tossing to eat breakfast.
In general, it is not allowed to go out of Beijing during the epidemic, and a new environment is needed during the holidays. It is highly recommended to stay here.

It is recommended that the room is too tight and must be booked in advance. The amazing point is that the breakfast is absolutely terrible. I will come back to stay here again. The hotel hopes that when you come again, all the TVs in the rooms will be able to cast the screen.

待提高：前台的工作人員其實不少，2-4位吧，但有幾位看着比較Junior，可能是實習的。退房的時候一共站着3個人，但衹有一位能操作系統。後面又換上一位看起來有點資歷的女士，但上來就大聲報客人的全名，還説要核對客人訊息。可是酒店一般就衹説姓氏+稱呼，誰會把客人的全名念出來？當時旁邊還站着其他客人！這應該是基本的酒店禮儀吧。

另外，入住的時候，門卡衹能刷開房間，刷不了電梯。應該也是Junior的前台操作問題。

房間的話，如果樓上沒有噪音的話，還是非常安靜的。應該是樓板問題。另外，我所在的房間Wi-Fi信號和手機信號都不大好，特別在卧室裏。手機信號1格，Wi-Fi基本是斷的。幸好是短住，這些問題也能接受。

1. 公寓樓與商場挨在一起，吃飯、購物比較方便；
2. 早餐品種雖然比不上五星級酒店，但比較精緻，且每天會更換小部分品種，沒有吃膩，父母也非常滿意；
3. 服務好，前台對於客户的疑問耐心、熱情地解答。特別要表揚前台趙琪（Lina），為客户着想：我們一家先在公寓住了兩晚，然後退房去古北水鎮住了一晚，當我們從古北水鎮回到公寓辦理續住手續時，趙琪告訴我們，幫我們留了原先的套房續住四晚，父母非常開心，因為住慣了原先的房間。

美中不足的是160平米的兩房，雖有兩個衞生間，但衹有其中一間可以沖涼，一家四口每晚要排隊沖涼較為不便。

但清潔打掃非常乾淨。清潔阿姨每天的補給都相當精確，看來是每個地方店都用心打掃了。👍
早餐也挺豐富的。出門方便，就在skp旁邊。

關於電視投屏，看到酒店在評論區回覆説電視已實現2、投屏功能，可致電前台實現。But ，致電後，被告知五一期間，用不了投屏，因為技術人員沒上班，好多顧客都是自己帶電視盒子？？
3、衞生間乾濕分離屬實有點表面功夫了。
