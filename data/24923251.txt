Sorry, I might be wrong, but for me was not at all 5 star standard. I chose this as I needed to stay near the airport, but then it’s better to choose a 4 star which is more frequently visited by travellers than this hotel..

The service is really amazing, the staff are friendly and our favourite part of this hotel is how well they treat all the animals they look after.

msg:I don't know if the good reviews of this hotel on Dianping are fake! I must be crazy to spend a thousand yuan to suffer in this place where no one lives! 
1. The noise is very, very serious. The room has no sound insulation. At night, I heard all kinds of airplane sounds, footsteps in the corridor, and the roar of inexplicable animals. I didn't sleep much all night! 
2. I have stayed in the worst four-star and five-star hotels. The cups are dirty, the corridors are dirty, the carpets have not been washed for years, and there are cotton swabs used in the bathroom. It's disgusting! 
3. I went to the Chinese restaurant at 6 o'clock and was told that there was no seat and I needed to queue. It was really ridiculous. Am I here for vacation or to make trouble? Then I was told that the food could be delivered, that's fine. As a result, the delivery of this hotel is different from all the five-star hotel delivery I have had before. They actually used take-away boxes, without even a bowl, and the tableware was not complete. Two vegetarian dishes, one fried rice, three pot stickers, three hundred yuan, this hotel is really ugly! 
4. Why come to this hell? Because the reviews said it was a one-stop place for kids, and I had to wait in line for half an hour to play go-karts, and there were only two cars, and there were not enough staff, haha! 
1000 yuan room fee + 300 yuan for hotel-run takeaway + 300 yuan for go-karts/archery/slides = I couldn't sleep all night because of the noise + all kinds of troubles
I was really ****!

When checking in for one of the two rooms I booked, I asked the staff if the other room was next door, and after getting a positive answer, I asked again. But when I checked in for the other room in the afternoon, there were four or five rooms apart? Is this called next door? Also, when checking in, do you not need to confirm with the guests whether the room includes the number of breakfasts and the number of guests staying? Even if it's shown in the order, do you not need to confirm with the guests again when checking in? They didn't even tell me where to eat. If you need to pay for the meal, don't you need to tell me in advance? Just paying at the restaurant door is considered telling? And the breakfast time wasn't even 9 o'clock in the morning, so there was no way to make up for the food shortage? I don't know if it's because of the large number of people on holidays or something, but the overall feeling is not good.

msg:Due to a temporary change in the itinerary, I had to stay in Shanghai for a few more days before finding this hotel. Unexpectedly, we found such a treasure hotel. They upgraded us to a sea view room when we checked in on the same day. The price/performance ratio was very high. The room was large and comfortable. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the overall service was great. Because my personal schedule was repeatedly postponed, the two staff at the front desk, Chen Qian and Zhou Zhijie, were also very patient in helping me go through the renewal procedures, and their service attitude was very good. I will continue to stay at this hotel when I return in the future.

msg:1. Because it was off-season, I upgraded to the executive floor for free. The view was nice, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it is the most beautiful sea-view hotel in Shanghai. It is difficult to order takeout, but it is not far from Florence Town.
2. There were some minor incidents at night. Every hour, there was a huge noise on time (it should be that the hotel's noise equipment was not turned off or malfunctioned in time, or the swimming pool was drained). After communicating with the hotel manager Mia, the hotel logistics depar**ent followed up in time and corrected the noise. I hope there will be no such low-level mistakes in the future.
Thank you very much to the hotel manager Mia, who has a very good attitude and high work efficiency.

msg:Basically, I never comment unless I come across a hotel with a particularly good experience.
However, the hotel's marketing staff enthusiastically called me to ask how my stay was. I almost forgot about it. This question really made me angry, so I will give you a fair stay. evaluate. ps Thank you to the front desk this morning. The place was so remote that even the Ctrip driver could not find the place. Thanks to the communication at the front desk, my flight registration would have been delayed.
ok The main topic is as follows
First of all, facilities: The lobby is grand, but the facilities in the hotel rooms are very old or even shabby. It's closer to the airport, but it's really inconvenient. The hotel is more like a nursing home, and it's quite far from a small shop (although there is a tram to the park), but when I actually went to the front desk, I couldn't find it. It's like asking for help, with an indifferent and impatient look. Is this the service of a five-star hotel? Not as good as the front desk of a hotel.

Hygiene: Hygiene is extremely poor. The lobby looks passable and looks a bit stylish, but the room is really dark and smells of humidity for a long time. The quilt smells like the bedding looks white, but it covers the whole body with hair. It feels itchy and it feels like it has been left out for a long time without being aired or disinfected. It may even be because it is in transit and no one is using it.

Environment: The surroundings are desolate. Although there are some facilities inside the hotel, such as naughty castles, etc., which are okay, but in my opinion, the introduction is about the hotel facilities such as children's playground inside the hotel. In fact, they are extra charges and attract foreigners. When people arrive, they realize that they are all for consumption, a one-time transaction.

Service: Let’s focus on the service. It is understandable that there is no greeter. After all, the price is here. However, most of the service staff here are really embarrassed throughout the whole process. It is really incredible. If you don’t understand anything, please ask. , giving people the illusion that I owe you, especially the guy who drives the shuttle bus at the front desk, with his indifferent attitude. It is said that the service industry is not about bowing down and being neither humble nor overbearing, but that his head is raised to the sky. I went, as if you asked me to stay and I begged you, the feeling was even worse than that of the window of the government office building.

Hotel customer service Lily proactively contacted me before check-in and arranged the room according to the guest's expectations. The check-in process was very smooth.

During my stay at the hotel, I felt that the hotel's service was very good. Hotel customer service will provide hotel information to travelers from time to time, and provide and arrange quality services.

It was a pleasant experience and I will consider staying at this hotel in the future.

Laundry is not expensive and the service is very good 👍

The environment is beautiful and the space is large for children to play. There is a children's playground and go-karts but they require a fee, but they are not expensive.
All in all, a very good experience. Will come again next time

In the past, the shuttle bus boy helped deliver luggage and was very enthusiastic. The front desk check-in and breakfast staff were very friendly. We had dinner in the restaurant in the evening. My children had Western food and I had Chinese food. They were all in the same restaurant and we ordered them at the same time. It was very convenient. Yes, it tastes good. The twin room has a large bed, which is enough for an adult and a 9-year-old child. Because we were transferring for a flight the next day, we didn’t have any rides in the hotel.

The swimming pool has a good view, but there are too many children playing in the water; there are a few seats in the changing area, which is not convenient to use; the breakfast is delicious, and the lunch buffet is a bit similar to the breakfast. You may consider early breakfast on the first day next time When it comes to having a buffet lunch (the dinner buffet feels too sinful🥹), using a screen to separate the Chinese restaurant from the Western restaurant is a bit too hasty for a hotel.

Overall, the price/performance ratio is good. I will bring my kids here again next time.

Since I had to catch a flight on the 28th, I checked in on the evening of the 27th.
At first I was still saying that this hotel was okay, but then things started to go wrong.

Most people's habit is to wear slippers in the shower, right? There were only two pairs of slippers in the room. My husband, I and our baby stayed there. Then I want to ask for two pairs of slippers to replace the wet slippers. What's wrong? When I ran to the front desk to make my request, I would like to ask the young man at the front desk what was your expression and reaction?

Your reaction to me is to open your eyes, open your mouth, and stretch your neck, showing surprise and disbelief? I'm so shocked by your behavior! Is it weird that I want two extra pairs of slippers? Hasn't this happened to you in your career? Remember you are in a service industry, you shouldn’t react like this to your guests, you know? (This is not meant to look down on the service industry at all.) Do you understand and love your corporate culture? I have stayed in so many hotels and this is the first time I have encountered such a service response like yours! It’s as if I’m doing something hugely wrong by asking for two extra pairs of slippers!

Even stranger things are yet to come! I have a 4-year-old baby. I asked for an extra bath towel for him and two extra boxes of tissue paper for my husband who had a bad cold. This young man came directly to ask me: How many days will you stay?

Why don’t I have a need if I stay for just one night? To put it bluntly, does it matter to you how many days I stay? Are these excessive and outrageous demands of mine?

I hope I won’t encounter such weird waiters in my future hotel career! I was really upset when I encountered someone like this when I was traveling happily!

The swimming pool has a children's pool, which is very shallow; the children's playground is particularly large, and you can soak in it all day long with unlimited access.
This is a family trip. There are three rooms. We booked them separately for the children's paradise package, and we checked in one after another. The young man at the front desk, Shan Junshang, was very flexible and considered it convenient for us to bring our children. They were all arranged on one floor. Upgraded to sea view room as room allowed. Later, I applied for a room change due to noise and other issues in the room, and he actively cooperated, and I was moved to a new room the next day.

What is also worthy of praise is the restaurant team. We had six meals in the restaurant for three days and two nights. The young man at the egg pancake stall in the morning, the young man at the steak stall at the buffet dinner, and the aunt at the breakfast noodle stall were all very enthusiastic. I remember We take every order placed by a customer and give us recommendations. Really feel the service of a five-star hotel!

Battery-powered cars are indispensable when traveling. There is a young man from Changchun who drives a battery-powered car with a very good attitude. We asked him to pick him up three times without any complaints. He also introduced us along the way and visited the racecourse, go-karts, peacocks, etc., making us feel at home!

msg:Tips for closing the trap: Cleaning the room is very perfunctory, not even folding clothes, just throwing them around. The cups are not washed and the garbage is not thrown away, even a fast hotel cannot compare.
The restaurant's service speed and service attitude are astonishing. The average serving time of each dish is 10-20 minutes. However, when we finished eating and asked to return the dishes that were not served, the chef miraculously prepared them within two minutes. There are no patterns on the dishes, and the waiters don't know what each dish is or what it contains, which is also very magical.
I woke up early in the morning and drank tea in the living room with no clothes on. Two male waiters chatted happily and swiped the room card to enter. I was confused: what are you doing here? Them: Let's check if the room is clean. I didn't complain that you were unclean, I didn't invite you, and I got up early on weekends and just opened the door after nine o'clock on weekends. Which hotel can allow this? Fortunately, I'm a man. If it's someone else, don't call the police.
I stayed for two days, and I was allergic to the bed problem for two consecutive days, and I deeply doubted the hygiene problem

I deliberately spent a few hundred yuan more to book a supreme deluxe room. It costs around 1,000 yuan a night, and it is marked as a 6-9 floor sea view room. When I checked in, I told the front desk repeatedly that I wanted a higher floor, but he seemed to understand. I still gave a room on the 6th floor, without a balcony, a room in the most common room, let alone an upgraded room type. Anyway, I was very disappointed this time.

msg:🌱 Cost-effective: It is more cost-effective to buy in the live broadcast room. If you buy it on other platforms, the price for one night is about 700 yuan.
🏠Room facilities: The facilities are relatively simple, and the sanitation is not up to standard, but the room is large and has a balcony where you can see the sea.
📍Location and transportation: In the outskirts of Pudong New District, it is inconvenient without a car, there are relatively few takeaways, and the delivery time starts in about an hour.
🍃Service: On the first night of check-in, there was a very handsome little brother at the front desk who upgraded the room for free, but later changed to a big brother wearing glasses, and his attitude was no good. The service attitude needs to be improved.
📢Sound insulation: the effect is average.
🥪Breakfast: OK, but more suitable for foreigners' eating habits.
🌃Room view: It is close to Pudong Airport and far from Hongqiao Station, about an hour's drive away.
Others: There are children's play facilities on the first floor of the hotel, only the Dream Kingdom can still be played, and the others seem to have not been well developed. Overall, the recommendation index is 3.5 stars.

I called the reservation depar**ent and said that I wanted to change to a big bed with a balcony. I directly helped to modify the room type ~ and then gave me a river view room at the front desk ~
 

Facilities: The room facilities are generally good, but the switch display panel of the air conditioner is on all night, illuminating the room, which affects sleep... Finally, I took a pillow to cover the display panel to sleep well...

Environment: There is a big children's playground, and the baby can spend the whole night at night. We don't have many people staying in the park on Saturdays, and the experience is very good~~We are only 3 years old, and we can only play balance bikes and horseback riding outside~Older children can play rock climbing, go-karts, donuts, etc.~ These have requirements for height~~ Generally speaking, it is enough for children aged 3 to 6 to walk their babies

It’s 10:30 in the evening and I’m still negotiating about changing rooms. At the beginning, I arranged a room with a door in the cloakroom, which was locked. I don’t know when it suddenly opened. Anyway, the people in the room can’t open it, plus the balcony door and the entrance door. There are three doors in the house. It’s a panic. The theory is that it’s changed to the second floor. It takes 5 minutes to walk without taking the elevator. Walked, turned a few turns, far away from the elevator room, communicated with the manager for a long time before reluctantly changing a room, there were cockroaches in the room, and there were mosquitoes at night, and the electric mosquito coil didn't work well, and the child bitten several bags , TV doesn’t have internet, I can only watch normal channels, no one answers the phone at the front desk, only call the service center, the slippers are blue, shedding a lot, basically didn’t sleep all night, my head is buzzing, next time Definitely won't live again!

msg:There is a reason for the low rating of the hotel
It was raining heavily in Shanghai, and the entrance of the hotel was flooded. Several cars that were not afraid of death rushed out, and they all broke down on the way. There was no security guard at the entrance or a reminder that it was not suitable to go out. The check-out did not say that the entrance was flooded, and there was no way out. Go, fortunately, I quickly asked about the situation at the door, stopped checking out in time, and then asked that it was under repair. Solve it by yourself, and there is no discount. Obviously, you are forced to stay in the hotel. There is no way to do it, but to delay check-out! Later, a clever person found out that he could call a tow truck to tow the car out. Five or six tow trucks came back and forth at the door. The hotel does nothing at all! Later, I called a tow truck to go out. When I checked out, the hotel didn’t say a word of apology. When the tow truck drove out, there were broken down cars on the road. The driver said that this hotel has been like this every year, and every year, there is no improvement, and there are no appea*****t measures. Really convinced!
The room is quite big, but half of it is the bathroom, and occasionally I saw a few bugs! There is a queue for breakfast, the number of tables is small, the variety is small, and the taste is bad! You can't see a few waiters on the road! It is often useless to make a phone call if you need something in the room. You have to be urged to deliver it. Generally speaking, it is a hotel with no service!

After landing, I contacted the concierge at the front desk and told me the license plate number. I got in the car and entered the room from 10:00 to 12:10 pm (17 minutes' drive).

When I got on the bus, I told the driver that I was Primus. He said we were going to Primus and asked me to contact the dispatcher. I was told that there would be a car to take us to Primus when we got to Primus, which was understandable, but we had to wait in the car. I don’t think it’s appropriate for the airline to offer free accommodation due to a delayed flight on another flight. You arranged to go to the Prix Hotel in the same park as Prix, but after all, we did not stay for free. We paid for it at our own expense and were accompanied there without any distinction. We waited for the flight at 8 a.m. the next day when the temperature was -4 degrees Celsius. It was a great experience for us. Difference! Won't come again a second time

When the quilt was lifted, there lay a probably sulky dog. Moth, it’s early in the morning, I’m really sleepy, I just fell asleep after I patted it off, the bath water made me cry, it’s so small that I can’t believe this is the best Primus in Sanjiagang Greenland, room 2 All the telephones are broken, and you have to use your mobile phone to find the front desk. The breakfast on the second day is funny and embarrassing. A group of people stand in a long line outside and wait for the notice to let them eat. Probably this hotel was built without thinking and unhappy. . Ctrip needs to add 100 on weekends, the total is 866, and there are two play items. I read a certain review on the day of the trip, 766 does not increase the price, and there are two more play items as a gift, a total of 4 items. Only one room was added, otherwise it would be a real loss

msg:Regarding the small long holiday, Primus has to complain: As a five-star hotel, in the face of a surge in occupancy during the small long holiday, the hotel’s reception management and emergency service capabilities are seriously flawed. I arrived at the hotel around 12:00 during May Day with my two children. I queued up for nearly an hour for check-in, and finally finished check in. The front desk said that the room needs to be cleaned now, and I will call to inform you when the cleaning is finished. Considering the people who are on vacation I accepted the flow very understandingly, and took the children to play in the entertainment projects around the hotel. At 14:30, due to the outdoor sun and no shade resting place, I took the children back to the hotel lobby. At this time, the lobby reception was already closed. There are huge crowds of people, but there are only two check-in windows at the front desk. Because there are too many people waiting for check-in, the other window that only handles inquiries and check-outs has to start to accept check-ins, which leads to when I want to ask the service staff whether my room is Clean up? The waiter said that I should queue up with the guests who have not yet checked in. I said that I have already checked in and have not received a call from the hotel. He said that there is no way. Only the computer at the front desk can check the room situation. I considered queuing There are too many people, so they want to make inquiries through the hotel phone. After making countless calls, no one answered, and waiting in the lobby for an hour, there is still no news of the hotel's check-in. It is very unreasonable to bite the bullet and have a queue of guests who have not checked in. There was another queuing for another 40 minutes. The guests who completed check-in at 2 or 3 o'clock in the back of me took the room card and left. I completed the check-in at 12 o'clock and there was no notification of any kind of check-in information. , I have to queue up again to check the room cleaning situation and actively negotiate with the hotel. I waited for more than four hours from the completion of check-in to getting the room card. I have checked into countless hotels. Primus is the first in this situation! During the period, many guests had to wait in line for a second time and had conflicts with the hotel due to the long waiting time and the need to inquire about the room cleaning situation, which proved that my situation was not an exception. Here, I would like to praise the lobby manager Eric. Due to the flaws in hotel management, he personally suffered a lot of resen**ent and blame from guests, including me. In the face of anger and complaints, he never showed any personal emotions, and kept clasping his hands together. 🙏Sincerely apologize to every guest and patiently explain, and can resolve conflicts calmly and quickly under all kinds of bombardment. I have excellent personal professionalism and excellent emergency handling ability. This is really not easy, and it is worthy of praise! 👍Including dining in the western restaurant at night. Although the dishes are relatively ordinary, the receptionist Xiaotan and every service staff in the restaurant are very enthusiastic. They will take the initiative to help children pour drinks and serve fruits, and remind guests where to pick them up What kind of food, the whole process of patient and polite service is great! Personally, I think Primus Hotel should thank excellent employees like Eric and the waiters in the western restaurant, because their efforts have brought back a lot of favorability points for the hotel. During the peak period, the management of the hotel was chaotic and orderly. Directly unsubscribe➕Complained about bad reviews, and will not come again in this life! Therefore, please be cautious when staying at Primus during the peak period. The hotel’s reception capacity is not very good. The garbage at the elevator entrance has been left for a day and a night and no one has cleaned it. You have to wait until after 9:30 to get a seat. Everyone comes here happily in the mood of vacation. Facing the hotel's saturated management defects really affects the mood, and it also affects the reputation of the hotel itself, doesn't it?

msg:The reserved supreme deluxe twin room is not very big... the main area is completely occupied by the bathroom and toilet. The view from the bathtub 🛀 is indeed good, but the small floor-to-ceiling door was not locked at first, and it is very close to the balcony next door, which poses a safety hazard.

Breakfast: You really have to get up early during the holidays, off-peak. I went there after 9 o'clock on the first day, and encountered a peak queue, and was later arranged to share a table in the private room for Chinese food inside. It was not very convenient to get food. In terms of dishes: there are really very few. . . The bread cake side is basically empty, only sliced bread. The poached egg is a technological product, the kind that is uniform and round, not freshly made.

Dinner: The buffet is quite satisfactory, and the price of 238 is acceptable. We brought two children who are less than 1.4 meters and charged at half price. The choice of dishes is relatively small, but there are free Buddha jumping over the wall and big grilled shrimp (it was delivered before it was cooked).

If you are free, it is recommended to go to the town of Florence, which is about two kilometers away, to eat, or you can take it to the hotel.

Fun: The first reason to choose this hotel is to take a fancy to the recreational facilities. First of all, there are still some projects, and it is just next to the hotel, which is very convenient. The popular karts really need a long queue, but fortunately there are sunshades. Other rock climbing and donuts can basically be played at any time, but donuts will really tire parents (I wonder if the staff can help pull the ring uphill?)
There is also a swimming pool on the 12th floor of the hotel, the temperature is very comfortable and not cold. There are not many people, probably because of the depth of 1.3 meters, many children were discouraged ~ the baby pool is very small.

Small episode: We stayed for two nights, but when we returned to the room the next afternoon, the door card was invalid. After waiting for ten minutes, the staff came up to open the door without any explanation...and asked us to go to the front desk to re-swipe the card . I feel that the service is not in place. Asked if housekeeping provided cotton swabs: no. Shower gel, etc. are not actively added. The cleaning of the guest room is not in place. When I entered, I found the note paper used by the previous guest.

To sum up, the environment is pretty good~ It is still recommended as a hotel for a relaxing vacation. After all, during this May Day holiday, the price did not increase exaggeratedly, which is really good. It is recommended that the hotel improve the service and look forward to meeting next time.

msg:The hardware environment of the hotel is good, and you can also cycle in the suite, but there are only two bath towels in the suite, and the uninterruptible power supply is not well connected, so it cannot be used. The cleaning situation of the hotel is illustrated by two pictures - Picture 1 shows the bottle left next to the bathtub after getting the room on the first night. I reported it to the hotel that night, but after the room was cleaned the next day, the bottle was still in place ... There are obviously used hotel plates, knives and forks in the room, which are still left on the table after the room is cleaned... Picture 2 is the water glass given by the waiter when eating in the hotel restaurant at noon. It is impossible to judge whether it was not cleaned or not at all Not washed. We ordered a set meal at the Chinese restaurant. We wanted to order other dishes, but we were told that we couldn’t order zero and didn’t show us the menu, but the table next to us was always at zero... It’s no good to have a full room during holidays these years Strangely, the true strength of the hotel is reflected to what extent the service and sanitation can be achieved after the room is full! You can say that the guests insist on coming to the hotel on holidays. There are too many people and the experience is definitely not good, but the holiday guests also pay more expensive room rates than usual. If you can’t complete the room between 12:00-15:00 Cleaning, if you can't hand over the room at 15:00, you should clearly write the check-in time, or don't sell the house. No matter how good the hardware is, it will depreciate day by day, and the depreciation rate will be even higher if the software service cannot keep up.

The dinner buffet is 238 per person. It is recommended to make a review at 228. The food is fresh, there is a serious barbecue, each person has a Buddha jumping wall and lobster, and there is a chocolate waterfall for dessert. It is quite a surprise
The service is not bad, the young man Kevin in the concierge depar**ent is very nice, enthusiastic and professional.
Although it is a state-owned enterprise background, thank you for the surprises brought by Greenland Hotel
Children's playground fees need to complain
Since Platinum is positioned as the high-end one of the three groups, it is really disappointing that it cannot be free. If the operating cost is high, you can give a discount for comparison.
Other ride donut kart events are great

It was 3 o’clock at the latest, so I had to wait. Then I asked at 3 o’clock. The front desk might be too busy , the response was cold, and no one else could come to solve it, so I told him that it was still not good, so I stopped talking. It took about half an hour to ask, but it was still not good, and I became even angrier. Later, I asked the front desk at the check-out area, and it helped me solve it. I got a room immediately. I don't know why it is so difficult to check in! The hotel has donuts, go-karts, and ranch horses that can take children to play. Overall, I am a little disappointed and can't feel good service.

There are many children's amu*****t facilities, and they are more fun, of course, the charges are a bit too high. The suite room is very large, with 2 bathrooms, but there are not enough bath towels, but the customer service will be delivered immediately after calling. In the evening, the restaurant provides a buffet (probably due to the company’s team building, or because of Saturdays), and it costs more than 100 yuan for adults, and there is no charge for children under 1.2 meters. For a five-star hotel in Shanghai, it is really cheap. Of course, there are not many dishes, but the taste is not bad. The same goes for breakfast. The only thing to criticize is that calling the room and asking for a good review from the guest is a bit superfluous.

The hotel has a children's playground, a basketball court, a kart track, an archery range, and a balance lane.
Personally recommend karting, speed and passion, big flick drift, but it is a bit expensive!
Primus Hotel Shanghai Sanjiagang Greenland is worth visiting!

msg:The check-in experience is not good, and there are many places where there are thunders! Will not go again in the future! Would not recommend friends to go!
1. The hotel facilities are old and not well maintained. The mirror in the musty room also has a lot of rust spots. We changed four rooms before we checked in smoothly. The first room smelled of body odor, the second room smelled of smoke, and the third room was exaggerated As soon as the door was opened, a large pile of wall skin fell off, and it was not normal until the fourth room. After such a toss, the hotel did not express a sincere apology or any compensation (feeling that they don't care about bad reviews from customers).
2. The swimming pool is open until 10 pm, and there are many people who go there at 9 pm on weekends, and there are no lockers in the locker room! The key point is that the water in the swimming pool is very dirty, and there is a lot of old mud in the water! Cleaning and changing water should be done infrequently! Discourage and persuade!
3. The breakfast experience is average. Although there is no queue at 9:00, there are many people. A waiter asked the room number and left. Self-help.
4. The facilities in the Children's Paradise are a bit old, and the lighting is a bit dim, but it's actually not very big. It's not cost-effective to add an adult ticket of 98.
5. The horse riding project is 198 once. It is not expensive but it can only be ridden by one person. It is impossible for an adult to bring a child, so younger children cannot experience it. (The reason for this is not a bad review is just an information reminder)

msg:I went out for my birthday specially to see the sun. When booking a room, make a note. When you checked in at around 9 pm, it was specially emphasized that it was to watch the sunrise. Please arrange a room with a view of the sunrise at the front desk. The front desk arranged to check in at 816. Standing on the balcony at 6:00 in the morning, I felt something was wrong. I called the front desk to confirm whether this room can be seen, because there is already a sunrise, but I can't see it from the balcony at all, and the right side is blocked. After the front desk was changed to room 1050, after entering, I found that there was no balcony, so I couldn't get out. Changed to 1052 again, after tossing again and again, the sun has been out for a long time, and the sunrise has not been seen. Very disappointed. 1052 room phone can never reach the front desk, every time I can only call room service to ask them to help transfer to the front desk. It's a pity that the takeaway can't be delivered to the door of the room, so I can only get it myself. Just to watch the sunrise, stay alone, I can't comment without experiencing other parent-child activities and facilities.

msg:The room is ok, the service is basically good and warm, except for a few who are either like interns and can't figure it out, or pretend not to see you called her, or go to pick up something for a long time and disappear...

There are not many amu*****t facilities. Although the children's park is very beautiful, the content is not too rich. The tickets included in the package can only be selected for one day during the stay at the hotel. I thought it was too good to expect too much. Peacock close contact is very distinctive, but it is only open for half an hour every day. Fortunately, it was closed before closing, lucky!

The worst should be afternoon tea and breakfast. They can all be ranked first among the worst afternoon teas and breakfasts I have ever eaten. I suspect that a chef can make them so bad! The breakfast is not as delicious as the ones you buy from Hema. The variety of salads in the buffet is not as good as the ones bought by Hema. There is no cheese at all. The Sun Island breakfast is served with authentic Italian burrata salad and French Lyon salad. The green space is too shabby! What's even more ridiculous is that one of the two coffee machines is broken and the other is not far away. Only the Italian or American water flow is unreasonably small, and it takes 20 minutes to row two cups of coffee. The milk that comes with it is still packed in Tetra Pak Bricks. It's not well cut. It's like a mouse gnawed and dug a hole... I didn't take a picture because I didn't even have the milk. I asked the waiter to make it up. shadow 😪

The advantage is probably because the room type is small and the place is not big. Unlike other resort hotels, you need a tuk-tuk ferry to go to various places to play. It can be reached by elevator... It's also an advantage... I won't come back in the future.

msg:Primus Sanjiagang Greenland Hotel is very suitable for leisure and vacation. If you can have fun without saying anything about Shanghai, Primus Sanjiagang Greenland Hotel is definitely a good choice.
feature:
The starry sky swimming pool in this hotel is very interesting, but remember to make an appoin**ent with the front desk in advance, because it is an Internet celebrity swimming pool.
In addition, the Greenland Sanjiagang Cube is next to the hotel. It takes a few minutes to go out. You can experience various projects such as go-karting, rock climbing, donuts, and archery. Love to come and experience the outdoors.
Recommended reason:
Located in the Sanjiagang International Tourism Resort, the entire resort area is very large, you can freely experience outdoor activities and various recreational items in the Sanjiagang International Tourism Resort, and you can stay in the hotel in the Sanjiagang International Tourism Resort. Have fun playing in.
In addition, it is by the seaside, the air is very good, the sea breeze is very comfortable, and it feels like a vacation near the seaside, including the service staff of the hotel wearing seaside vacation clothes, which has a super vacation feeling.

msg:At the end of the National Day, our family came on vacation. I didn't notice that the room I booked was a low-floor room. As soon as I entered the room, I was dumbfounded. There was a huge basketball hall in front of the balcony across the road. The line of sight is completely blocked, this is the worst room in the low-floor room type! So we asked for a room change, and we had to pay upstairs to live upstairs, and we encountered unhappy things...
I feel that the overall hotel's service awareness is not high, including the staff at the front desk, restaurant, outdoor activities, and swimming pool, and their faces are not good, especially when we want to pay, the action of charging is always faster than any details. (I immediately picked up the code scanning machine), this feeling is very bad, the outdoor activity staff is extremely indifferent, seeing a child climbing a rock hanging in a high place and unable to get down, from beginning to end, he seems to be ignoring, without any support. Actions to help... There are also a lot of indifferent attitudes that can be complained about. I will not list them one by one. This is in sharp contrast with the more senior staff of the hotel. There is a senior uncle with a big Shaka doll to play with the children. I have been telling everyone about the spirit and cultural concept that the hotel wants to pass on to the guests, and warmly welcome everyone to come. It is too much. It is obvious that the bottom staff feel that the quality of the hotel has nothing to do with them and needs to be trained.
The rest are ok, but won't consider coming back in the future.

The hotel service is very good, the staff are very friendly, the river view room has a good view, and the room is quite large. The water temperature of the pool is lower than that of the children's pool. The children's pool is the same as the hot spring. Children are very comfortable inside. There are many entertainment items in the hotel. You can choose indoor and outdoor, but you will have to pay extra. Horse riding, 198/3 laps, the coach is very serious Yes, feed the horse 68/times, a small bowl of carrots, go-kart, 85/4 minutes, archery 45/15 minutes, and balance car, rock climbing, donuts are not played in the maintenance, it is a pity, the next day I played at the hotel The Dream Kingdom on the 1st floor, one big and one small 198, children can play in it for a day, liberating their parents, and truly becoming a veritable parent-child hotel. But the only thing I am not satisfied with is the hotel's catering. The so-called western restaurant and Chinese restaurant are actually all in the same place. The breakfast is also there. The buffet on the first day, 298/person on holidays, without any fault, the second day The Chinese food I ordered was mixed with the people at the buffet, and the ingredients were average and the prices were not average. A satay enoki mushroom beef 108, 6 pieces of garlic chicken wings 108, lemon fried chicken chop 99, just the name is more pleasant, The taste is the same. The orange juice of 39/cup is not freshly squeezed (the left side of the picture is the orange juice bought for money, and the right side is the orange juice from the buffet), I really think it's too pitiful, if you don't consider eating, this place is still a hotel with a baby. Yes, at least the children refused to leave when they checked out.

First, full marks for service. I would like to thank Mr. Ludenden, the lobby manager, for his help in the past two days. From check-in to various details, he did his best. Although the western restaurant and Chinese restaurant of the hotel are slow to serve, and they still lack this and that, the service is really nothing to say and it is in place. In comparison, the service awareness of breakfast is weaker.
Let's talk about hardware and parent-child entertainment. The room is a sea view suite, the hygiene is good, the hotel is older, but the maintenance is still good, the room also has a dehumidifier, so there is no musty smell. Thanks to the indoor children's park, which gave the old mother a breath of relief, and the outdoor horse farm, small animal park, donut skating, rock climbing and archery, all of which are very good. There are still a lot of projects, check in when it cools down. The pool is small but very beautiful.
Recommended to my friends and will come again later.

msg:Hardware: The hotel is located in the Sanjiagang International Resort. The overall feeling is very a**ospheric. The parking lot is semi-open, and the seats that are not open on weekends are a little tight. The room is good. The separate cloakroom is separated from dry and wet, and it is relatively large. The window is a failure, we are on the side facing the river, but the side of the window is a bit awkward because of the load-bearing wall, half the window is half the wall.
Recreational facilities: The swimming pool on the top floor has a good view. It is a viewing space. The large swimming pool is 1.3 meters deep. The small one is hot water. We got the room card and made an appoin**ent
There are many outdoor activities: there are package tickets, buy carefully!
Donut (slippery grass): Twenty minutes, the child needs to drag the circle up by himself. My baby is in the state of heat stroke after 20 minutes. Haha~ The key is that I wear slippers and can't help~ If a little girl If you want to, I suggest that if your parents are unwilling, you can wear sneakers to help pull the circle up~
Archery: Five arrows, playable for 15 minutes. However, it's too heavy, I can't even pull it~ I shot two and it's over
Balance car: For babies over 120, it's tiring to play
Rock climbing: I climbed halfway up the mountain in one breath, and was shocked by her courage. I thought about it later, I guess I didn't look back at first, but I looked back halfway up the mountain, and I was so scared that I was about to come down.
In terms of software: the attitude of the service staff is good, basically responding to requests, the minibar is free for the first night ~ the hotel has a barbecue at night, you need to go to the front desk to choose a package~
If you feel that you can’t go out to other provinces and cities, it is a good place to take your children to play in the city during the holidays. The swimming pool has all kinds of entertainment. It may be better for three days and two nights. There is also a small town in Florence nearby, which can meet the needs of the baby and satisfy the parents’ needs. desire to shop

msg:I booked two rooms online with my friends and family and came to Greenland Platinum Pie in Sanjiagang, which focuses on parent-children. Let's name and criticize a male staff member of Fantasy Children's Park first. The child could not reach the basketball by throwing it, so he climbed on the hood and was happily throwing the basketball. At this time, the male staff member rushed over, pointed at us and yelled at us, teaching us not to take care of the children. It frightened both children, who hugged my legs and dared not play basketball again. At the moment, because I am anxious to take the child out for nucleic acid testing, there is no more debate. Later, I saw him in charge of the electric trolleys at the door, and he was also yelling at the children who were driving a little further away. As a parent-child hotel, shouldn't it be the first to recruit employees who love children and are emotionally stable? Children are indeed more imaginative, and their movements are more difficult to control. As parents, we do have the responsibility to take care of our children, but if there is an employee who yells at the guests, I think the hotel industry is struggling under the epidemic. How to do a good job in personnel training and service? Your hotel still has a lot of improvement. space.
In addition, the feeding fee charged by the horse farm is relatively expensive. But the coaches at the horse farm are all very good, taking the children to ride while chatting with the children to relax their nervousness.
In other services, there are people who help with luggage when getting off the bus, and the gentleman at the front desk is also more professional. The staff at the breakfast restaurant are also friendly.

Only the buffet is shocking! 228 seems to be cheap. There are no other beverages except Coke and Orange Sprite. The cheapest beer is 52, which is in small bottles. It's the first time I've encountered such a buffet.
The crayfish feels that it will not be taken out after 7 o'clock!
You have to queue for breakfast, noodles, omelette rice, and egg pancakes! Waited 20 minutes to get coffee. How can such a family-friendly hotel be recommended to others?
Swimming pools affected by the epidemic can only be reserved once a day, one and a half hours each time. The pool is so small that the unlimited flow is really scary.

It's too inhumane, and parents must make up a ticket to sit in a daze, saying it's for the safety of their children, but in fact, parents are sitting inside watching their mobile phones, and not many people follow their children the whole way.

After all, children over the age of 10 are very big, so there is no need to accompany them at all! I bought an escort ticket and paid for it. After sitting for a while, I left with no one to care. It was obviously to earn more money for an escort ticket, and it was for the safety of the children? so funny!

msg:It is said to be the first-line seaside parent-child hotel in the magic capital, the boutique hotel under the Greenland Group, and the three hotels of Primus, The Platinum, and the Platinum are together. It seems that there is no sign of guests staying in the other two.
[Check-in] Some staff warmly helped with luggage and led them to the sofa to wait. After waiting in line, they were led to the check-out counter next to them. The staff first introduced that adding 100 yuan per night can upgrade the sea view room, but declined directly. Then I will help you to upgrade directly, Xiao Meng. Then the machine for reading the ID card failed, and I got to the counter next to it to read it. Fortunately, it didn't take long to get the room.
[Guest room] The room on the 8th floor, the elements of solid wood and metal, the main color of the blue carpet, the a**osphere is beautiful. Design Chinese ink painting on the bedside background wall. The bathroom is very large, the bathtub and the small terrace facing the sea have a pleasant scenery, and next to it is the basketball hall of the big shark, which is very beautiful when you take a photo. Watching the planes fly by and the ships on the sea in the distance, I feel relaxed and happy. The tea bags are from Twinings, the bedside has a JBL stereo, and the toiletries are URBAN SCENTS, which smells good. The disposable slippers are very thick and the details are well done. Stayed for two nights, woke up in the morning and found a small gecko and a cricket in the bathroom. On the day of check-in, I found a small hair tie left by the previous guest next to the bathtub. Fortunately, other places were clean and tidy.
When I saw that the bottled water could be refilled, I called room service and several bottles were delivered in no time. On the morning of check-out, 2 bottles were also sent, and the waiters were generally well-trained.
[Facilities] The starry sky pool looks nice. There are ponies in the zoo. At the entrance of the lobby, I saw Peter Rabbit and White-eyed Rabbit who were kept in their cages relatively quietly, and I saw children feeding carrots.
[Breakfast] There is a lot of variety to choose from, I was impressed with Pretzel lye bread and rye slices, and later found that there is a shelf selling bread in the hotel lobby. The breakfast bread was cut into small pieces to avoid waste, and the coffee was pretty good from DE Espresso's beans.
[Environment] As the sun sets, the sea breeze on the East China Sea is blowing, the tents on the grass are swaying in the sea breeze, the fresh air, the fun of barbecue, and the laughter of children are the most favorable places for this hotel.
[Transportation] Going back and forth from the subway station, plus going to the nearby Florence town (the hotel no longer provides a shuttle bus to Florence town), all are taxis. Later, I found that even the local driver couldn't find the hotel entrance, so I contacted the driver by phone. I had to walk in vain between the first and second floors, and I was forced to increase the number of steps on my mobile phone.
Overall, it is still a very good hotel. It has done a good job in all aspects, adding bright colors and good memories to this summer vacation that cannot take the baby out of Shanghai.

The ubl bluetooth speaker is also good, especially suitable for adjusting the a**osphere. I also saw the sunrise on the sea in the morning, which is worth the price. It should be said that the hotel with the best view in Shanghai is not one of them. I have been thinking about when the large wetland and lake downstairs will be open to the public and develop scenic spots. Next, let’s talk about the deficiencies: 1. The hotel’s swimming pool actually needs to make an appoin**ent to limit the current, and then I can’t make an appoin**ent. Where are the rights of the resident? Why not limit the flow of food? What is the meaning of double standard? Although the final negotiation gave way, it affected the mood. 2. There is really no place to go around, and the large wetlands are also out of reach. The only bird garden suitable for taking pictures was told to close, which was a disappoin**ent. 3. Such a big hotel doesn't even have decent Chinese food to order. In the evening there is only crayfish and self-service barbecue. The so-called dim sum buffet at noon is also very good. So I can only go to the small town of Florence for dinner.

msg:The hotel is right by the sea, although you can't go to the beach, you can see the sea when you can't get out of Shanghai. There are quite a lot of parent-child play items, suitable for children of younger ages to play. The breakfast is rich, and there are even freshly made soft omelettes, but the queue is quite long. It is close to the town of Florence, and I went to the hotel three times for two nights, so I can solve meals and shopping.

msg:Can not go out of Shanghai, only short trips. The hotel is 30➕ kilometers away from home, with convenient transportation. When I first arrived at the hotel, the lobby was filled with guests waiting to check in, and there were two rabbits at the entrance to attract children to tease. Check in on Sunday, tourists are swarming, queue up at the hotel at 2:30, check in at 3:10, the room is still being cleaned 🥹 However, the hotel staff allows you to check out a little later, after all, the occupancy rate on Monday is not so high. Swimming time needs to be booked in advance and can only be booked once. The swimming pool on the top floor of the hotel is not bad. Of course, there are too many people. It is impossible for a family to squeeze on a beach bed. The hygiene is still very good. I went to the Chinese restaurant at 6:30 and was told that I would have to wait for 50 minutes for ordering. At 5 o'clock, you can watch the sunrise over the sea from the balcony. The breakfast buffet on Monday morning was delicious. After a break, I went to drive a go-kart. After all, Kangaroo Paradise is more suitable for young children to play. Rock climbing and horse riding are all under the sun, for fear of being roasted. The fly in the oin**ent: 2 of the 4 rooms have encountered the failure of the room card, and I hope it can be improved. It is recommended for families who are free on weekdays. The price of amusement items is lower on weekdays. The restaurant also has group purchase packages, and there are fewer people, so the experience should be better~~

msg:Room type:
Supreme King Room, belonging to the hotel interior, facing the Burpai Hotel
The room size is large, the bathroom is separated from wet and dry, and it is relatively clean
Free drinks and snacks in the Minibar

Hotel facilities:
The parking lot is on the first floor, half underground, but it's still very sunny in the sun

The main family hotel, the project is general, and many have to be charged additionally
Horseback riding: It was too hot to ride, someone led a few laps
Karting: Indoor, the venue is relatively large, but children under the age of 16 cannot drive by themselves, and can only take the co-pilot, which affects their interest in play. Weekday tickets are cheaper than weekend tickets
Donuts: Outdoors, it is to sit on a mat similar to a swimming ring and slide down the slope. After buying the ticket, you can play for 20 minutes. The mat weighs 8 kilograms. Young children need their parents to help pull them to the top of the slope, which is labor-intensive.
There are other rock climbing, archery etc, not tried

Gym: 12th floor, no one cares, go in by yourself

Swimming pool: Free for Primus, but you need to make an appoin**ent in advance after check-in. There will be a game in about 1 hour, and the venue will be cleared at the point. The deepest water depth is 1.3 meters, many children play

Breakfast: buffet, 63 yuan/person for children, basically some have, that is, the waiter is not too diligent in collecting

The overall is a 4-star hotel, some distance from the sea, and the window looks out of the yellow water. It's better to stay once when you can't leave Shanghai.

You will have to queue for more than 20 minutes for breakfast in the morning. There is no bag for the hotel to provide things, and so on, what should be provided by the five-star hotel is saved. During the epidemic, room ordering has also stopped. The publicized micro-zoo only has horseback riding.

The furniture in the hotel is generally equipped, the patent leather of the writing desk is cracked, and there is no place to put a mobile phone in the toilet seat.

But there are also good places. Because it is the supreme deluxe room, the room size is still very large. Walk-in closet and large restroom.

However, the self-adjus**ent of the mood is still very good, the scenery and the environment are good, and I am still happy.

The restaurant in the hotel has a good taste and a lot of varieties, which can satisfy different tastes.
There are quite a lot of entertainment facilities for children, but we have no children, so we found a few places to take some photos. The environment is very good, and the photos taken are very beautiful.

msg:The hotel has a good environment and is close to the sea, but there is no way to go to the seaside, so I can only see from a distance. There are many projects in person, which is good. The only disadvantage is that the swimming pool is too small and there are too many people swimming. It's small, plus there are swimming lessons, occupying a swimming lane, and it is no different from taking dumplings. The male receptionist at the front desk of the key swimming pool is quite arrogant. He does not wear a mask himself. I'm still ready to do it, it's the first time I've seen such a waiter, awesome! But later the hotel leaders came forward to apologize and gave small gifts, but it is more appropriate that such employees should be fired! Other aspects are ok, the breakfast is quite satisfactory, the sea view room has a good view, the only awesome waiter is the hotel's fault

The layout of the lobby is not only very beautiful, but also brings a relaxed and comfortable feeling. The waiters are very warm and feel at home. The key upgrade suite is very large, with a living room, bedroom, and bathroom in total, and the balcony runs through 3 rooms. Bird Garden is beautiful at night. Due to the heat during the day, I did not experience outdoor sports. The indoor fantasy park has a lot of playable items, suitable for children under the age of 8. It is recommended to place as many tables for four as possible for breakfast, as well as a few more coffee machines.

msg:It is really not recommended for family and children to come to the city. People near Pudong can still go and play. Mediocre and hygienic. The front desk of the queen room has been upgraded to a sea view room. In winter, outdoor activities are too cold, horses don’t have to run on Friday, and the park ends at 6 o’clock on Friday. There is really no entertainment in the hotel on weekdays, so we can only go swimming. Many hotels of the same price in Sanya have free parent-child activities. I have not asked here, but there are some self-funded projects in the park and outdoors, and there are similar ones in the urban area. Catering is more expensive, there are few options, the buffet is average, but fortunately you can order takeaway. The sound insulation effect is ok, not too noisy.

Although it was only half an hour before the end of breakfast, each variety of the hotel was still well prepared, and the fruits were also very fresh. In some hotels, until the end of breakfast, the fruit seems to have been stored for a long time. There are many karting venues for parent-child projects in the hotel. It is very enjoyable to drive 4 laps in 4 minutes. It seems that there are still many entertainment venues under construction, and it is estimated that there will be fires in the future.

The hotel's facilities are okay, but it can only be said that the service and supporting facilities are far from keeping up with the price. The bath water is not hot during the peak hours at night, and it is impossible to deliver things for a long time. In addition to the tickets for the amu*****t park, other items cost money and are much more expensive than in the city. The breakfast is quite satisfactory. Fortunately, the children had a good time in the amu*****t park.

msg:The hardware of the hotel is still very good, but the sense of service is unsatisfactory, and the attitude of the front desk is indifferent. The phone application needs a baby bath towel. The customer service said that it has been sent out. I said can I think of a way? The customer service replied: I have no choice after sending it. When I got to the swimming pool, I wanted to recharge the swimming ring. The customer service said that I had to operate it myself. The air pump was broken. The staff said: I can't do anything if it is broken. I bought it myself. The customer service reps responded the same way. There is no inflatable tool in the swimming pool, and in the end, you can only manually blow it yourself. The swimming pool said that the opening time was 10:00, and it started to catch customers at 9:35. We said that the time was not yet, and the staff rudely said that they had to clean and get off work. The fruit in the room was moldy and water-pen marks. Breakfast was collected at 10 o'clock, and there was no staff reminder. When I looked up, the table was already collected. Anyway, it is one step at a time, and many service details need to be improved.

Upgraded the sea view room, the scenery is very good, I can see a group of seabirds and passing sea boats by the sea in the distance, and I can see the bright moon on the sea at night. Although it is close to Pudong Airport, it is not very noisy to sleep at night. The hotel is full of Spring Festival a**osphere. I have tried children's playground and outdoor activities. It is very interesting to try karting and rock climbing for the first time. There are no panda sheep to feed in winter, and it is not bad to feed the horses. There are so many horses here. The starry sky pool is really beautiful. The water temperature of the pool is 32 degrees, which is very warm. Especially recommend parent-child afternoon tea, 168 yuan, super value and super value! I really want to go to the beach and catch small crabs, but unfortunately I don't know how to get there, come back next summer. A small comment, the lace hole of the bathrobe in the room has been broken and can be repaired or replaced!

The concierge guy was also very handsome and took the initiative to help with luggage. The front desk of the hotel can be said to be responsive, which is great. The guest room Sun Lei is also very warm. Because I need to do nucleic acid when going abroad, jennie at the front desk is very enthusiastic to help me check the institutions that do nucleic acid near the wine. The nucleic acid test was completed quickly on the second day, and after returning to the front desk, I helped type out my nucleic acid report, avoiding the pain of waiting for the test report in the cold wind. The hotel room is comfortable and the facilities are very good. The Chinese food is quite satisfactory, but it has the style of home cooking, the ingredients are better, and the oil and salt are moderate. Dinner for a few days is returned to the hotel to eat. Worth coming again.

msg:I don't like to write bad reviews very much, I'm really a little angry. This time I have to catch a plane, I booked this after seeing other reviews on Ctrip for catching a plane, and I also saw that there is a pick-up and drop-off. I was upgraded to a room when I checked in, and the concierge was also very good and the service was in place. But now I have to order in advance (the next day, the hotel's applet is written like this), there are very few takeaway options around, if you go late, it's basically not good to eat, the hotel didn't tell me, I can also understand. The hotel looks a bit old, but the price is still cheap during the epidemic. The point is, on the first night, I promised to help me with a taxi, and I went upstairs to help me get things. The next day, no one seemed to remember. If I hadn’t woken up early to go to the hotel front desk, the plane would have been late. No one has booked a car for the airport drop-off at all. If you want to take a taxi now, the place is very remote. It is very difficult to take a taxi now. If you can’t get off the plane, you can say no, you don’t have to agree to help take a taxi. Is it easy to change your booking on an international flight during the epidemic? I hope everyone can understand each other.

msg:I stayed on July 2 and wanted to take my children to swim in the infinity pool. When I arrived at the hotel, I was told that swimming needs to be reserved. At present, all the appoin**ents are full and I cannot swim. Ask again at night, and the appoin**ent will be full the next morning. Only sleep for one night and go back the next day.
The swimming pool is a marked fitness facility. If you cannot use it or make an appoin**ent, you should at least inform it in advance. We only came here to satisfy our children's desire to swim. Anyway, this time it's white.
Reflect on your own problems, and did not ask about the policy in advance.
The buffet restaurant for dinner that day was also full, and you had to wait until 7:40 to be seated, and the dishes were very general. Overall poor experience.
It may have just been unblocked recently, and all aspects have not returned to normal rhythm.
Remind everyone to check in carefully: swimming offers and meals are also required.

msg:Nice few points of the hotel 1 The children's playground is quite big. 2Service center Sofia provided some help, 3We arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock and provided us with a room. The need for the bed circumference is also quickly provided.
But the hotel really does not recommend everyone, 1 everything is charged, and it is very expensive. The price of a box of carrots for the little animal is 50, which is incomprehensible. Children's playground 198 one big and one small. Although the venue is fairly large, the price is not worth it. Only valid on the day. I think it is more reasonable to consider adjusting to staying in the hotel during the period of staying. After all, if you don't bring a baby, you won't choose this hotel. 2 The sound insulation is very poor, extremely poor. I don’t know why no one responded in the comments of others at the time of booking. Otherwise I won't book it. Not only the movement in the corridor, the most unbearable thing is the sound of airplanes. During the day and night, even at two or three o'clock in the middle of the night, there are frequent, very, very loud aircraft noises. Really, everyone should consider it carefully when booking. 3 The bath water was very cold at night, and I felt cold. 4 The weight scale ring in the room, the stereo Bluetooth can not be connected. In short, I won't go to this hotel again, and I won't recommend it to friends around me.

If you are a bad sleeper, it is recommended to bring earplugs. There are two other houses on the third floor. The water for bathing at night is cold, and there is a lot of wind leaking in. My friends are afraid to take a bath for fear of catching a cold.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory. In fact, there are a little less varieties, the filling is quite timely, and the taste is decent, but I have never been picky about the taste.
The children had a lot of fun, there is a 499 package, horse riding, go-kart rock climbing, parent-child afternoon tea, which is quite good. The horse is a big horse, and the coach takes it for three rounds. The horse is fed a box of carrots, you cannot bring it by yourself. Go-kart 16 Parents are open for those under 10 years old. Children can only sit next to them. It is recommended that friends who go there wear gloves. There are only helmets and no gloves. It is so cold that my hands are frozen. But the venue is quite big. If it were not for the cold weather and wind, It’s too big, I still recommend everyone to try it.

[Charming sea view] The Premier Room is on the 11th floor of the executive floor, but the executive lounge is not open...it is the same as the ordinary room, and the price-performance ratio is very average! The location of the sea-view double bed is much better than that of the double bed. The double bed room can see the sunrise, and the double bed room is located farther away, so you can't see the sunrise.

Suggestion: The children's playground downstairs opened too late, it only opened at 10 o'clock, which is too difficult for the early baby. Moreover, there is no concession for the residents in a uniform fee, which is not good. The children's playground in the Prime Minister's Mansion in Guangfulin is new and the residents are free.
The water in the swimming pool is too muddy! It was still muddy when I went there the next morning, and I took it.

During the National Day, I can’t walk my baby out of Shanghai, I want to find a hotel with rich activities, find this one, look at the negative reviews, what would I like to write after my own experience?
First of all, regarding the slow check-in, this is true. Our first room was very fast and the second room was only available at about 4 o’clock. However, everyone knows that hotels are like this during the holidays. We were mentally prepared. I ordered an afternoon tea for two directly in the lobby and waited slowly. The children liked it very much. The desserts were shaped and the adults chatted. After getting the room, the hotel upgraded our room. The front desk apologized for various explanations. We said it was okay and understood, but the hotel also gave us a cake and some fruits.
Secondly, there are fees for most activities. I want to say that the hotel actually arranged a lot of free items during the National Day, and there are also timetables that I did not shoot, such as small theater movies, bunny, etc., because obviously the charged items are more fun. Do you have to charge extra for horse riding and go-karting? ? The children's playground is much larger than the last time I went to Sheshan, and it is included in the room rate.
Finally, with regard to meals, I have not eaten at the hotel except for breakfast, because the small town of Florence is nearby. Let’s drive for seven or eight minutes. Every time I eat, I will buy something to digest. For breakfast, there are not many varieties and taste.
The baby and the adults are very happy, and the children say they will come again. The happy holiday is over, take a full day off to go to work.

It is very suitable for parent-child travel. The seafood stalls around the hotel are a bit dark. But because it’s close to the airport, the hotels that are relatively noisy are all double-glazed, but sensitive babies still have to consider it. If the price is usually very cost-effective, the price of November is higher, but because of the price, the experience of staying is okay.

What's important is that you can see the sunrise on the sea in the room, and the passing freighter slowly rises with the sun. The orange-red light band is like a gold border for the earth, and I can't help but admire the charm of nature. There are many activities arranged for children in the hotel, such as rabbit feeding, horse riding, and dreamland. There is also an indoor swimming pool. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the water surface of the pool is like being connected to the sea, and it feels endless. The racecourse in the hotel is really good, and the little brother riding a horse is also nice. It must also be said that the hotel’s buffet is rich in food, and the kids even made a piece of rice noodles for me, which tastes good 👍. Finally, I must praise the hotel’s service again. The staff are enthusiastic and patient, and each one is very good. There was an episode when the power was off. The children pulled their scooter off. After contacting the hotel, the front desk enthusiastically helped to find them. Finally, the young lady at the front desk, Sun Jingyi, also asked SF Express to deliver it home! ! ! Finally found the child's beloved scooter🥰😘

I chose this high-end hotel in the surrounding area, but the service and price are really good! Can't compare! too poor
1. Let’s talk first 🅿️ Parking, we drove here, there is a parking space at the entrance of the hotel, and the security guard asked us why we are here! I thought to myself: Of course come to stay! Otherwise why come. Said you can't park here. Of course, we politely asked how to park.
Let's stop on the first floor, we will stop on the first floor, the sign is not clear! Never before has a hotel had to walk up several flights of stairs from the parking lot to the elevator! Imagine carrying luggage and taking a baby up the stairs to the first floor for a while before entering the elevator
2. Check-in, really, the front desk smiled at the beginning, but it's so unprofessional! Need to ask to answer! Seeing that we were bringing a baby, we did arrange a quiet room for us, but there was a room at the end of the corridor, walking past the elevator, accompanied by a musty smell, plus a long way! What was even more unexpected was that at night when the children were about to go to bed, the sound of mahjong started next to them! Accompanied by the chatting of the local uncles, I am speechless! right next door! So I called the hotel to ask what was going on, and the hotel replied that the next door asked for a mahjong table🤷‍♀️. We can only ask the hotel staff to help remind the next door to be a little lighter, eh! They continued to play mahjong until twelve o'clock in the evening! Speechless! (I don’t understand why the hotel won’t make a note when you check in! It’s said to be a quiet room, and it’s really the innermost one. The guests who came later asked for a mahjong table, wouldn’t they consider the feelings of the guests who checked in first!)
3. There are tickets to Kangaroo Paradise in the package, one big and one small, well, there is no one on weekdays, and the children are still having fun. But we arrived a few minutes earlier, saying that the business is not open yet, and we walked around with our baby. The kid waited patiently and asked me: Did Auntie finish cleaning? I went to ask if I could sit and wait in the place where the shoes were changed. Then the staff turned on the light impatiently, which made people feel very unfriendly, as if going to work a few minutes earlier, very helpless!
Since it is a selling point as a parent-child hotel, why can't it be better? From check-in to check-out, the staff who see breakfast are the most. What do I need to do, I can't find any staff, the whole process is "self-help" by the guests, all kinds of negative sabotage! Speechless! ! !
Tucao is over! The real evaluation of the hotel on weekdays! For your reference when booking a hotel. Five-star praise is not so long

It would be more perfect if you could get close to the sea.
The cage for the welcome bunny in the lobby is too small, and the bunny basically has no room for movement.
The resort is very big, there are many play facilities for children, rock climbing, tyre skating, archery, children have fun.

Of course, I thought it was because of the breakfast that the moon cakes and the hotel failed to communicate. Finally, Ctrip's customer service solved the problem, and returned a 251 yuan breakfast coupon. Still very satisfied. The swimming pool is great. Slip doughnuts. There is also a big children's playground. So I immediately decided the Mid-Autumn Festival and came back to check in.

Except for swimming, the hotel’s amu*****t facilities are charged for children of all ages. It would be better if there is a room + entertainment package, or a gift of entertainment.
The breakfast at the hotel is quite generous and tastes good. The surrounding environment is beautiful, and there are farmers' dishes and seafood restaurants in about 5 minutes' drive. Not far from Disney and Ole.
For those who can't go out of Shanghai and want to take a vacation, this one is more recommended.

msg:Although the hotel was waived under my struggle, I still had to give a bad review. The situation is as follows: I took my daughter to Pudong Airport for a transfer, and wanted to find a hotel with a better environment, and came to this Sebring. After driving for a few laps, I found the main entrance of the hotel. This may be because I was too stupid. I was just following the guide system. There was no way to go, so I had to ask the chef in the back kitchen. Finally found the hotel lobby, ready to stop to unload luggage (daughter went to study abroad, with more luggage), an uncle security guard walked over quickly, full of anger, said that parking here is not allowed, I replied, I left the car with the luggage Move away. Unexpectedly, the uncle security guard was unhappy, and he said, "You leave the luggage to take care of me, but here is not to stop." I was speechless when I heard this, and ignored the uncle security guard. He was unhappy and began to prepare for a hands-on posture. Fortunately, the hotel concierge pushed out the luggage cart and pulled him in time. Otherwise, physical conflicts may occur. To be honest, I am a little surprised and even more angry. Thinking about not affecting my daughter’s mood, that’s all, I asked for the lobby manager to understand the situation, so I can rest assured. (After all, I'm worried about the security's small actions in private) It is a pity that the lobby manager has a big shelf and has not shown up. Don't think about it, hey, who made this a state-owned enterprise green space? We can't afford these officials. The main problems in the hotel experience are as follows: 1. The hygiene is not good, the desk cards on the bedside table are full of floating dust, and the bathroom floor is full of hair. 2. The weight is bad. 3. The water in the swimming pool is so dirty, I don't know how much bleach is in it. 4. The outdoor sports facilities are out of repair, and there are great safety hazards. In addition to the blue sky and white clouds, this hotel has a wide view of the natural landscape, and the rest is useless. Oh, this is not objective, the pressure of the bath water is still good. That's the advantage.

The hotel lobby has a high ceiling and looks more a**ospheric
Somewhat similar to resort hotels in Southeast Asia
When I checked in, the front desk informed me that there was no breakfast. Later I negotiated for a while and found that the reservation officer made a mistake. Okay, I still rewarded me with breakfast.
Basically no entertainment facilities are closed after check-in in the afternoon
Can take a walk downstairs
The front desk saw that there was a crayfish buffet in the hotel, so I passed by in the evening. The guests did not pay for the preferential payment and were told that the so-called crayfish buffet is a crayfish buffet for one person, and other food buffets are half price for children, so there is no feeling of crayfish share I feel a little bit deceived. Crayfish can't talk about high-end ingredients. Now that I talked about the crayfish buffet, what is it for one person? I suggest not to try it easily at the price of two large and one small.
The breakfast on the next morning is quite rich. I want to take my children to try the hotel’s parent-child project after breakfast. It’s a hot day. I walked to various activity points and was told to start at 10 o’clock. Now the sun at 8 9 o’clock in this month is already big and I want to stick to 10 The point was too inhumane, so I went back to my room to rest and went back and forth for a while and the hotel’s shuttle bus said it was at the shuttle bus of the three hotels in the park to the activity point. There was no pick-up at the big sun. The first time I came back and forth. Going back for a long time and it feels bad after eating closed doors and there is no shade all the way. The so-called parent-child hotel has room for improvement in both facilities and services.
The room is fairly spacious. You can go out from the balcony on the bathroom side. The room on this side is a closed window. You must draw the curtain when you take a shower. This is a bit embarrassing, so remember

msg:第一次在攜程上給出低評分的評價，第一次帶着1歲半的寶寶來上海，最後兩晚安排在離機場比較近的親子酒店，結果讓我們大大失望。1、車行正常去酒店大堂的路竟然封閉了，也沒有指示牌引導新的路線，原以為司機不夠聰明，直到第四次打車的司機也找不到，我才真正意識到是酒店的問題；2、酒店的游泳館的水竟然是涼的，根本沒法遊；3、遊樂場特別的冷，寶寶去玩不到10分鐘就凍的鼻尖通紅，趕緊回房間了；4、可能是淡季的原因整個酒店見不到幾個人，冷冷清清，特別淒涼。5、酒店的地毯味道特別大，晚上嗆的呼吸困難。白白的浪費了我們的時間，寶寶就在房間裏待了兩天，沒有為此處的旅行畫上圓滿的句號。6、套餐內包含的孔雀園門票，一直沒見到孔雀。這個季節強烈不建議親子出行入住這裏。7、唯一讓我滿意的一點就是服務還是不錯的，積極想辦法解決問題，實際服務人員什麼都解決不了，酒店沒有客流量，為了節省開支，娃娃機的電源都是關必的。

吐槽完説下早餐，種類不多但是味道不錯，尤其是酸辣粉，兩碗都不夠，推薦
去了一樓的小童樂園，裏面非常大很乾凈，裏面也有廁所和母嬰室，平日198元兩大一小可以玩一整天，推薦

優點是洗浴間 衞生間很乾凈寬敞 設計感不錯 窗外風景也可以。

不推薦。

msg:房間很喜歡，住了兩次
前台一姑娘（忘了名字了）超級好。我説媽媽腳扭傷了。她説儘量安排不要走太久的房間。又把我們的房間升級到了和父母一層樓的，很感激
畢竟推薦12左右的房間，前面沒什麼遮擋，其他的話就要樓層高一點，不然會被前面的shack擋住一些視線。
餐廳服務真的要差評，第二次來和第一次差太多。
比如自助晚餐的燒烤，我們桌子夾子沒了，給了我桌號的紙，但。。。負責燒烤的竟然不拿，説要夾子？？讓我再去找服務員。。。
另外，巧克力瀑布的棉花糖冰塊沒了，問裏面的小哥，他説等一下，就給別人弄冰激凌去了。等了10分鐘，再問他，他説這個不歸他管，讓我找服務員，瞬間氣炸，早説呢？？

設施：酒店所有娛樂設施都是額外收費的，這個能夠理解，但是樓下的小童樂園我詢問是否能夠讓我看一看裏面環境的時候門口的服務員不讓我進去（我並沒有攜帶孩子進去，衹是我一個人）話説我一個大人看一看也就30秒都不要的事情，既然收費是不是服務也需要跟上？孩子玩個太空沙，已經付了錢，五分鐘後又來詢問一次！

環境：明明樓下停車場很大，門口的保安卻讓車隨意停靠在酒店門口，弄的走到哪裡都跟停車場一樣 

相對服務體驗感非常差的酒店了！不會再想入住✋

msg:生日當天入住，謝謝前台幫忙升級了房型給了一間非常吉利的房號，房間和浴室都夠大，海景view很可。

早餐入口要排隊，蛋餅要排隊，麪條要排隊，咖啡要排隊，各種排隊，可能餐廳體量跟接待能力不是很匹配。週六尚且如此，週日難以想象。

中餐廳沒有散客區，跟西餐廳公用，衹能坐在西餐廳的邊邊上，這種中西餐廳共用區域的配置也是第一次體驗了。

最大的遺憾是辦理入住時前台有承諾因為當天生日會送個生日小蛋糕，我們聽了也挺開心的。但是當天等到晚上睡覺也沒送來，我們也不高興打電話去問了。但承諾了做不到還蠻扣分的，還不如不承諾。其他服務也就沒有感受到了，走廊碰到服務員也不會打招呼的那種。

晚上我們想去開卡丁車，出門看到有電瓶車，小朋友很想坐，我就想找司機，四下看都沒人，還喊了幾下，後來發現司機和門僮坐在電瓶車的最後一排座位上看着我們，半個身子都縮下去了，就不希望我們看到他，但我還是問他能不能送一下，他説現在挺忙的，如果我願意等的話可以送，這都是啥服務呀！？忙啥啊？忙着聊天偷懶！
還有泳池的救生員一直在看手機，門僮絕不會幫忙拿行李和開門，小童樂園工作日衹營業到18點，而且五點半開始就收拾玩具、打掃、關燈開始哄人，晚上睡前打死一衹大蟑螂，酒店服務員大多是60歲廣場舞大媽大叔，服務意識一言難盡……唯一的亮點是套餐裡帶的野餐籃不錯，包裝很好，味道也不錯。
第二天中午要離開的時候車子還被另一輛車堵的死死的！地面那麼多車位，偏偏堵住別人的車…而且車位離大門很近，在門僮和保安的視線範圍內，我去問門僮和保安，一問三不知，還跟我説，要不你就等會兒，他停在這裏肯定很快就走，我看他們也沒打算解決問題就自己用了一鍵挪車app和打了110，一直沒人來，保安也不打算有所作為，就繞着車子看來看去，我衹好進去找大堂經理，最後調監控找到了車主，人家已經在小童樂園玩了……等了45分鐘終於車主來了！她説是保安讓她停在這裏的，保安矢口否認，住這酒店真是倒黴！這麼熱的天大中午12點等到12:45才能走！絕對不會再來了！

孩子玩的夢幻城堡還不錯 能玩一小時左右 但之前看到酒店的介紹 游泳池會有專門的小童池 會放熱水 結果去了一摸 小童池內的水比成人池內的常温水還要冷 花20元給孩子租的游泳圈也沒用到 相當於整個項目浪費了

2.辦理入住人不多，但由於工作人員辦理速度緩慢，導致可以排隊很久。
3.住了很多作為五星級酒店，這是少有的從下車到入住工作人員看到你，也不會主動過來幫忙推行李的。
4.泳池需要預約，名其名曰是為了防控疫情限流，然後預約提供的全是飯點時間，根本沒法去。既然是為了防控，那請問需要付費的室內小童樂園怎麼就不限流了？電梯裏一堆不戴口罩的，怎麼工作人員看見了也不提醒了？懷疑所謂泳池限流是為了騰空間給辦了游泳卡的非酒店住客。總之整體沒什麼滿意的。

如果這是一家千元以內的酒店，我能忍，但既然價格開到近2k一晚，是不是相應的服務應該也要跟上去一些？
辦入住時就感受不好，其他的也就沒什麼好印象了，遊樂設施也非常有限，還都結束得很早。4點多入住，次日12點退房，刨去晚飯早飯和遊樂設施排隊時間，最後就玩了2輪卡丁車……

特別在服務方面很差，裏面的服務員像是客户欠他們錢一樣，態度好差，沒有一點歡迎的樣子。
要叉子沒有，要茶沒有，要浴袍沒有。親子酒店連小童沐浴露都沒有。。實在是堪憂。。裏面任何小童遊樂項目全都要錢，還不便宜。

不能説是評價，衹能是算建議：1.門迎應該主動開關門，尤其是是遇到帶着孩子出行的父母，又是下雨的寒冷天氣；2.游泳池的救生員很熱情，但有些父母沒有換鞋子直接站在泳池的邊上走來走去的，或者給孩子拍視頻，多人讓人感到衞生無法保證；3.飛機的噪音確實有點大，這個貌似避免不了，建議可以送入住的人員一次性的耳塞，相信比果盤更實用；4.地下車庫到大廳中間的一段路需要再明確一下指引，負一樓入口和大堂入口一樣重要，因為很多客人是由負一樓停車然後再上去的；5.負一樓到馬場的路面可以處理一下，下雨天因為石板不平整容易把水濺到身上。

前台服務熱情友善 堪稱“有求必應” 特別是kate 還有幾位先生不知道名字 等候入住期間長者們在瑞沁吧喝咖啡 還點名誇讚“侯悦”的服務😁
大堂每天定點有小明星互動  小朋友很喜歡 
袋鼠王國小朋友也玩的很開心  但是不能切換陪玩大人有點吃不消
還有就是微牧場的小羊小豬 稍微“敷衍”了點 大概是想主打馬術的關係
周圍還有飛鳥花園可以兜兜拍拍照
入住幾天吃了一次大閘蟹自助晚餐 198的性價比還是很高的  早餐內容也很豐富 
哦對 客房打掃服務也很熱情 看到小朋友還會打招呼😂就是浴巾還是emmmm。。還好現在都自帶
總體感覺還是不錯的  老小都滿意就好 國慶期間服務質量也在線

msg:上海酒店體驗最差的一家，11點多就到店辦理入住，告知還沒有收拾好房間（這個正常能夠理解），給了證件辦理入住手續後，告知有房就會聯繫，就帶一家老小去吃中飯並遊玩了附近景點。到了3點直接前台拿房卡，沒工作人員主動來拿行李，要自己找，這就算了，國慶人多可以理解。到了樓層，要走過長長的走道，有長者已經覺得房間太裏面，每次進出太累。進了房間，發現被安排在唯一2間過道盡頭，窗户風景就是廠房的屋子，瞬間無語。與酒店交涉，衹問了句辦理入住前台沒提醒你嗎？不好意思，我們現在沒有空房了。。。。
1.我帶着長者孩子11點就辦理入住，你難道沒有考慮入住人的情況，安排了這麼裏面的房間，每次進出要走長長的走道？前台的不專業，需要住客買單？
2.酒店唯一2間正對廠房的房間，沒有第3間，安排給11點辦理入住的客人，請問合理嗎？整個國慶心情被破壞，最後交涉就態度強硬告知前台沒提醒不好意思，我們沒空房了！你們這個房值這個房價嗎？？
最後，還好有攜程的客服專業支持，原來住2晚，因為酒店這種不專業且強硬的態度，我們決定第二天退房，攜程幫忙溝通，當天就退了第二天的房費。這家酒店列入黑名單，不會再住第二次！

很適合親子出遊，酒店最滿意的就是服務，很貼心。設施比較新，有一個很大的小童樂園，雖然要另外收費，但是好在蠻大的，小朋友可以玩一整天，都不捨得出來。還有一些其他的室外項目，住一天來不及玩，應該也不錯。下次還會再來

1.中餐廳晚餐時段根本沒幾個人，結果等了半個多小時才上菜。
2.主打的小童樂園有股難聞潮濕的味道。
3.機場附近，飛機聲音很大，睡眠不好的朋友一定謹慎選擇。

msg:感覺是個親子酒店，小孩很多，大堂裏很吵鬧，泳池也全都是小孩，甚至有父母帶小孩進健身房也完全沒有工作人員管理。房間隔音很差，走廊裏講話聲聽的清清楚楚，靠近機場，早上飛機起落聲音也很乾擾睡眠。忘記開勿打擾燈，早上9點就有人按門鈴要打掃。。。整個酒店基本談不上服務，表情冷淡，回答問題也十分敷衍。反正不會再來

msg:這次和我家夫人要從浦東機場飛，酒店離機場很近，環境不錯，我也是到處出差住酒店，很少會寫點評，今天重點要表揚一下禮賓部一個叫丁瑞的小夥子，我家夫人的手背因為昨天打針留下針眼沒處理好，在去酒店的車上睡覺不小心壓住針眼出了很多血，到酒店下車才發現，給我家夫人嚇壞了，這小夥子見狀後趕緊拿出醫葯箱並詳細告知葯品的使用，幫助我把我家夫人的手上傷口包紮好，對於這種應急事件處理的十分妥當，從這也能看出這酒店的管理還是可以的，希望酒店能給予這小夥子一個大大的表揚。下次來上海還會住你們家。

msg:缺點：酒店客房管理混亂；值班經理服務意識差，存在找理由推卸責任的嫌疑。
入住當天下午2點左右，我、太太和寶寶正在午睡，突然房門就被打開了，我和太太就被驚醒了，由於當時還末徹底醒過來，沒看清楚來人，衹聽到一箇中年女性和一箇中年男性的聲音，女的打開房門後，邊上男的便表述“開錯門了，我們房間是 650。”，隨即女的開門張望後便立即表示“不好意思，開錯門了，對不起。”，便將我們的房門關上，之後便聽到邊上房門打開的聲音。等到人清醒後，我立即撥打了酒店總機電話，告知了其他房間客人可以打開我們房門的情況，酒店工作人員表示核實後會與我們聯繫。之後入住期間我們一直害怕又會有陌生人進來，隨身都帶着貴重物品出門，且晚上睡覺也提心吊膽的，還用椅子頂住房門。但是之後入住的兩天，都沒有任何人來聯繫我們！期間我們也想着算了，就沒有再主動找酒店進行溝通。
退房後，我們在攜程客服反映了該情況，攜程客服立即聯繫到酒店，然後讓人無法理解的回覆來了！！！
首先酒店值班經理打電話給我，表示當時己經與 650 的客人電話確認過了，當天下午2點左右650 的客人在房間睡覺，沒有來開過我們的門。我説你們可以查看下當時的錄像，到底有沒有人進來！該值班經理便表示這個調取錄像要申請，要下午才能回覆我。下午該值班經理回電，表示該開我們房門的女性是客房部經理，邊上的男子是陪同她一起查房的。當我詢問他“該所謂的客房部經理進門前沒有任何敲門動作，且我也聽到她關了我們房門後又打開了650 的房間，且早上你也告知我 650房間的客人也在午睡。”，這個合在一起好像並不合理時，該值班經理便立即表示，我們核實過了，確實是客房部經理來查房，不是客人，説了句對不起便草草結束了通話。
我己無法核實是客人進來還是酒店客房部經理進來，但我覺得酒店還是存在以下問題的：
1、客房部經理在未得到我同意的情況下就可以直接進我房間，這件事就比其他客房開我們房門進來正常了？快捷酒店打掃衞生阿姨都知道進來打掃前要敲門詢問，一個五星級酒店的客房部經理卻不懂這個道理？
2、值班經理表示之後打過客房電話，可能我們出去了，所以沒接到。同時也沒有我們其他聯繫方式，之後就忘了所以就沒有再聯繫我們！那我的入住訊息中難道沒有我的手機號碼嗎？！你這後來忙所以忘了又是五星級酒店的操作？
3、事發當天核實，不是先去調去錄像，而是直接與 650 客人電話核實，難以理解。
以上都體現出該酒店客房管理混亂，值班經理毫無責任心。服務上根本沒有五星級酒店的水準！

🍃環境：酒店內部一進去大堂就很大，肉眼可見的地方都是五星酒店的水平，很好，一家人都很滿意。特別是我們帶小朋友來的，一樓的親子樂園真的太讚了，小朋友進去了就沒有停下來，玩的比迪士尼還要投入。外面的海景也很贊，定了海景房，看到飛機從窗外低空往海平線飛去的畫面會讓大人小孩一起矚目。

🧹衞生：房間蠻大的情況下沒有看到不乾淨的地方，家人很滿意，房間裏的小卡片都很貼心，讓人覺得有求必應，好評。

🔔服務：服務這方面是這次入住後，滿意裏最滿意的地方，所以特地來寫個長評。遇見所有的酒店人員態度都很好，覺得稱得上賓至如歸。下車幫忙搬行李的高個子小哥積極親切，走廊裏經過的服務人員主動問好。
前台的雷文婷小姐姐超級熱情，我們帶了兩個小朋友，當天是生日，和小姐姐説了後特地送了水果和小點心，讓我都有點不好意思，小朋友很喜歡。續房時候我們不清楚的都一一解答，辦的也很快。入住的兩天裏幫我們安排要求的時候以我們的感受為主，不怕麻煩。
樓層的清潔人員魏平阿姨也很好，倆個三歲小朋友搞出的亂子真是一大堆，魏平阿姨不厭其煩的幫我們清掃，解決我們的需求，態度一直很好。特地問了阿姨名字，很感謝。

總之一家人都很滿意，這家酒店已經是我們打算以後帶娃住親子酒店的首選了，內容豐富玩兩天不是問題，房間內部外面海景都五星，服務超棒！

離迪士尼不遠，離浦東機場不遠，離佛洛倫薩小鎮不遠。
酒店房間也是挺大的，算是乾淨整潔有序。
尤其Mini吧飲料免費，還送了歡迎水果👍
自助餐中規中矩，週末人挺多，秩序倒也可以，就是小龍蝦🦞有點小🤭
24小時健身房設施較齊全，自己動一動完全可以
泳池太小了……人又多，這可能是唯一的瑕疵了。
酒店服務人員態度很好，超出預期！
現在“不出滬”，這家帶娃親子值得來試試。

2、排的房間無陽台，詢問前台，告知五樓及以下的房間均無陽台，實際看到有一半房間是有陽台的。雖然最後換了房，但對前台的態度很不滿意。
3、第一天的晚餐自助餐138元/人。幾乎沒什麼菜式。小龍蝦全是死蝦。
4、酒店內的娛樂設施，除了健身房和泳池，全是需要另外收費的，包括小童樂園。
酒店外的環境還不錯，有草坪和鞦韆，有個温水的小童游泳池，適合小寶寶。

2. 房間內裝修擺設非常好，寬敞的walkin衣櫥，浴缸，乾濕分離，但清潔程度和除濕要加強（一進門就在入口處發現前房客留下的口罩外包裝😠）
3. 一層的小童樂園非常不錯，平日等於完全包場，寶寶玩瘋了！管理人員能來回貼心觀察瞭解寶寶們動向並提醒一些違規飲食家長。10：00~20：00運營全日能無限制進出
4. 自助餐飲食， 西式類食物如意麪、甜點都很好，中式類食物保温不行，所有東西都是温冷的，再好吃都很扣分
5.因為暴雨沒能使用外部設施，總體來説還算不錯，但很多地方可以再提昇。

附近海邊圍起來了，去不了，開車從邊上小路能走到海邊。

服務很差，前台辦理入住團隊和散客不做區分，且管理混亂，造成無法按時提供房間，前台的衹會説：你別問我，我又不是領導。這樣的回覆方式非常不專業。最後還是攜程出面幹預予以解決及賠償，但是這個過程中很明顯的推諉，無人管理的問題。去游泳池不給箱子説用完了，就很隨意的你穿進去好了，在游泳池換換衣服好了，態度一副客人很找事不爽的樣子。去玩卡丁車遊樂項目的管理人員也不説清楚怎麼買票，就跟你説去二樓問，也是一副愛玩不玩的樣子。吃早飯的時候，煎蛋的和下面的在那不戴口罩的情況下聊天，還説的臟話，唾沫星子噴上了面前。
總之每一個細節都透出整個酒店的管理都非常不專業，沒有標準沒有積極性，人員都很敷衍。門口禮賓部也是一問三不知狀態。
衞生部分，細節處看得出也是很馬虎，毫無標準。
房間設施還算新，但是外部環境就很差，雜草，爛泥路，環境死角積水，可以看出酒店平時很蕭條。
我覺得這樣的酒店完全無法達到五星級標準，評價應該下4.5分。800-1800的價格非常難以契合，這種也就是300-400的標準。

看來綠地開發房地產還可以，搞酒店獨家真的是外行，總體來説太差了，下次送也不會去。

親子房送樂園票，我這什麼都沒有送。應該是定這房間的不會去，或者不差錢吧。
服務，唉，服務。人少人少還是人少
吃兩頓飯，加玩的門票，套票、樂園、騎馬。兩天一夜花了3750元
寶麗嘉、麗思卡爾頓、外灘W不香嗎？房間小點就小點，發朋友圈還能加定位
