msg:Outstanding Customer Service of Msiss Sherry’s and the hotel staff at Kimpton.

I trust this message I am writing to share my exceptional experience with the customer service of Sheryn at Kimpton  Hotel. My family and I had the plan to go to Walt Disney Shanghai so I checked this hotel I that was Brand New and just opened so I decided make the reservation; During my all time staying in the hotel I was truly impressed by the high quality and fancy decoration Hotel also the location super convenient near by the mall and obviously the level of service provided and dedication on especial to Miss Sheryn that helped me to settle down my Disney Tickets.
 
From the moment I arrived, the staff exhibited unparalleled professionalism, attentiveness, and a genuine commitment to ensuring a positive guest experience. The attention to detail, courtesy, and prompt assistance were evident in every interaction.

Notably super kind and professional as soon as I saw Miss Sheryn I immediately remembered her face, “She was working as a manager in other Hotel in Hongqiao area” that always had super attitude to helped me and my colleagues during the pandemic to get PCR test QRs etc (for sure too many foreigners and Locals must remember Miss Sheryn)… attitude and kindness to help maintain until nowadays specially because with people that we don’t speak Chinese…. 

The exemplary customer service skills and willingness to accommodate requests left a lasting impression.

I believe that exceptional service deserves recognition, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the outstanding hospitality provided by your team. Please extend my appreciation to everyone involved.

I will undoubtedly recommend this Hotel and your services to my friends, family, and colleagues seeking a remarkable hotel experience. Thank you for setting the standard for exceptional customer service.

msg:A luxury fashion brand under InterContinental. The hotel is in a good location. Although it is a bit far from traditional business districts such as the Bund and Nanjing Road, Qiantan is a new business district, surrounded by large shopping malls such as Qiantan Taikoo Li and Xingyao Qiantan. The hotel decoration is both retro and fashionable, and the design of the fireplace in the room is very unique. The TV, bar and table are all hidden and very novel. The biggest advantage of the hotel is the popular open-air infinity pool, which is really beautiful. The breakfast is semi-buffet, with not many varieties, but the taste is very good, and the restaurant environment is also beautiful. The service of each depar**ent is very warm and thoughtful. Very good!

msg:In order to attend a fashion forum, I booked a stylish and scenic room a week ago and brought my family to stay at the Kimpton Hotel. What warmed my heart was that the hotel manager/Stevenie Nini called me 2 days in advance to inquire about my stay and helped me upgrade the room/writer room type for free. The large area of ​​more than 90 square meters touched my heart at that time! This is the first time I have experienced the room upgrade service in the high-end hotels in Shanghai that I have stayed in before! They also specially equipped my baby with children's slippers and toiletries of little yellow duck. The people-oriented service is in place. It's OK! During the stay, I checked in the hotel's hot spots: the lounge on the 5th floor, the lounge/outdoor swimming pool on the 8th floor, and the lobby on the first floor. I won't attach the pictures of the big landscape. My family wandered around the hotel, looked at it all the way, and took pictures all the way. There were details everywhere, and the sublimation of artistic cells everywhere. For me who has been engaged in the design industry for a long time, it is definitely a very unique experience similar to an international art tour and a gallery-like a**osphere! Due to the short time I stayed in the hotel this time, I didn't fully experience it. Looking forward to the next opportunity!

msg:Kimpton Hotel Shanghai Qiantan | A modern carnival that extends the brand core of "luxury without arrogance". It's like arriving at a cool friend's house. The common area has the a**osphere of a high-end living room. 1 all-day dining restaurant and 1 bar. The swimming pool view is great and it says it will be open on April 1st. This is the first time I have seen a hotel where the TV, tables, and mini bar are fully electric and retractable. It is high-tech with a little fun. My only complaint is the design of the wardrobe door, which is a bit redundant. It cannot be pushed or pulled after placing the suitcase, and it always blocks the use of the dressing mirror and hairdryer area.

The overall style of the hotel is a mix of modern, industrial, and wabi-sabi style, and the bathroom The choice of all black, black bathtub, black toilet and black paper towels can be said to be super cool. The three scents for the bath are also chosen just right. Whether it is the automatic lifting TV or the smart screen in the mirror, they are all first-line standards for Shanghai hotels. If you like this contemporary avant-garde minimalist industrial fusion style, you can give it a try. The style is cool and has Shanghai’s unique dramatic night charm plot. It’s a great drama experience!

msg:The swimming pool of Kimpton Qiantan opened on April 29 this year. I came here to check in. It is a brand of Kimpton InterContinental. I have never stayed there before and it is my first time to come here. The style of the hotel is low-key and luxurious. The dark tones are really cool, elegant but not ostentatious, and low-key and gorgeous.

The suite I stayed in is really large. The old money style is full of retro nobility and style. I like the fireplace in the room the most. There is also a very soft wool blanket next to it. If you come in winter, you can curl up in the wool blanket by the fireplace. How comfortable it is haha!

The executive lounge of the hotel is really super beautiful. The three-story high ceiling is really amazing. The industrial beer barrels and the spiral staircase are very popular. It is definitely the next Internet celebrity check-in point!

The French restaurant chole on the 8th floor is of very high quality, with a fully open kitchen and fine dinning configuration. The chef is thoughtful and talkative~ Next to it is a modern retro bar, which feels like a luxurious nightclub, just like the Moulin Rouge!

The best thing is that the infinity pool on the top floor is so beautiful. The whole Huangpu River is in full view, and it faces the West Bank on the opposite bank across the river. The best angle is to shoot from the terrace on the 9th floor to the 8th floor. The view is amazing!

Finally, I must praise the service of the hotel staff, which made me feel how exquisite and comfortable this city of Shanghai is. I especially want to praise Ms. Joy Yu, the front desk of the fitness center and swimming pool on the 9th floor, Ms. Yakzia Li Xiyuan and Ms. Iris Yao Luonan, the front desk of the hotel on the 1st floor, Mr. Cole Wang Kai and Mr. Lucas Liu Meng, the hotel managers, and Ms. Heidi and Mr. Rusael, the two waiters at Le chole Western Restaurant on the 8th floor. It is your warm and polite service that makes me feel the high-end a**osphere and upscale of the InterContinental Hotel brand! ! !

msg:Kimpton Shanghai I will never stay at Kimpton again. I was attracted by the cover photo of the newly opened Kimpton Qiantan Hotel and stayed there for two nights. However, after two days, I felt it was really not good✋. The bad thing is the service. It can be said that the management is bad. Not enough! The hotel is in a group of office buildings, so many people say that they can't find the hotel's entrance. The entrance is really small, but the overall interior design is quite good, blending dark and industrial style, which is suitable for younger people. But apart from the design, it really has no advantages at all, especially the management team is so bad. The shower room in the room overflowed with bath water on the first night. The reason was that the water flow was very slow, either because it was blocked before or because of the design. We reported the defect to the front desk staff over the phone and asked them to deal with it in time. As a result, we arranged for a cleaning lady to come and clean the overflowing water in the room, but did not deal with the floor drain at all. Considering it was too late, we also I didn't want to ask for a room change, so I went to the front desk the next morning to report again and asked them to check the overflow problem in the shower room so as not to affect our normal use. As a result, we received a call from the hotel at 15:20 at 20869999, telling us that it had been taken care of and that it had been taken care of. I sincerely apologized verbally and emphasized that I would give a fruit plate and a bottle of red wine to express my apology. However, after returning to the hotel in the evening, I checked that there was still water in the shower room and I did not see the so-called red wine and fruit. Is this a problem with the service? Or is it disrespectful to the guests? As hotel guests, we do not require you to give us gifts, but we still have to meet the minimum standards that a hotel should have! Do the responses to these questions meet the service standards of 1,900 yuan a night? Considering that there was still water in the shower room at night, I wanted to take a bath. As soon as I filled up the water, I saw a lot of small clumps floating on the water. I don’t know if the bathtub is not clean or the water quality has not been treated properly. It’s really time to check in. So disappointed! Bad review! Shanghai Culture and Tourism needs to be reorganized! What a surprise. When I checked out, the front desk asked me if I wanted to deal with the floor drain problem I reported!

The TV, mini bar, and small table in the room are all electronically controlled. They can be stored away when not in use, which frees up space. When booking, I asked for some soundproofing, and indeed the soundproofing of the room was good. If you are near the door, you can hear people coming and going outside more clearly, so sleeping and relaxing inside will not have any impact. Takeaways need to be picked up and down by yourself. I hope a robot can help with the loading and unloading in the future. In addition, the TV often freezes when projecting the screen, which does affect leisure. I have reported this problem to the front desk. There are also swimming pools and lounges. Let’s experience it next time~

The public area has a sense of design. There is a three-story-high lounge on the fifth floor.
The infinity pool on the top floor also offers a panoramic view of the Huangpu River.
	
The Cool Enjoy Twin Room is nice, but it’s a pity that there is no view outside the window.
Wet and dry separated bathtub toiletries are Atelier Bloem
The bedside wireless smart remote control can raise and lower the desktop TV bar
The welcome fruit is my favorite mango, which is also available in free mini bar
The buffet breakfast is ok. It’s not a problem to fill up. The special feature is noodles with scallion oil.
	
The front desk saw that I was Cantonese and they were very friendly when they spoke Cantonese to me.
But the service is still deducted for not taking the initiative to help pull the boxes.
There is no introduction to hotel facilities or in-room equipment.
	
The hotel has several shuttle buses but I didn’t wait.
It’s quite close to Taikoo Li within 10 minutes’ walk~

This time I went to check in mainly for experience.
Unexpectedly, the whole experience was surprisingly good.
The design of the rooms and public areas is great
The services are also passable
There are also bicycles that can be loaned to guests for riding.
It’s not too convenient to ride to Taikoo Li
Overall, it is a good hotel. I will try it again next time

It is recommended that the welcome fruits given can be changed or have more choices. I was given a few mangoes, but I didn't taste them because I was allergic to mangoes.

Design full of design, luxurious and elegant environment, new clean and intelligent rooms, everything is in line with my picky style as a Virgo. The hotel is just a French restaurant, absolutely Michelin-level, with fresh dishes and excellent craftsmanship. The infinity pool guy is even more shocking.

The front desk staff would remind me that there are many guests staying during the holidays, and suggested breakfast at 9 o'clock the next day to avoid the dining rush. I would recommend going to the bar on the 8th and 9th floors. It’s very nice to take photos and check in. The room service is great. Chargers and other supplies are delivered to the room in a timely manner. The service desk will also provide thoughtful guidance on the use of the in-room TV lift and bar lift. These 2 It was very novel and fun; I went to the gym and swimming pool after breakfast the next day. The gym was clean, there were many fitness equipment, and there was a yoga stretching area. I saw that the outdoor swimming pool was sunny, so I picked up my yoga mats and went to the swimming pool with my friends. I took a yoga check-in photo, it was so awesome and the original photo came out directly. I highly recommend this hotel to my friends when they travel. I give it 5 stars.

We walked around the bar, the a**osphere was full, and there were many people taking photos and checking in📷

First of all, I would like to express my special thanks to my dear Nini~ Not only did she make us feel at home with her warm service, she also upgraded us to a suite and prepared a birthday cake, which made this stay experience even better.

🏨The environment and architectural style of the hotel itself are simply works of art, showing the charm of modern aesthetics everywhere. Every corner is carefully designed to be modern yet warm and comfortable. Every detail demonstrates the u**ost attention to quality and guest experience.

🖼️In addition, the hotel’s location is also very advantageous, very close to Taikoo Li Qiantan shopping mall, making it easy to explore Shanghai’s beautiful scenery and rich culture. Whether you want to experience the bustling city or find a quiet corner to relax, this is the perfect choice.

Celebrating my birthday here made the day even more special and memorable. For travelers looking for a high-quality accommodation experience, I highly recommend the Kimpton Hotel Shanghai Qiantan. Thanks again to Nini and all the hotel staff for their warm service and careful care. Five-star praise✨

Cleanliness: The room is very clean, the temperature is very comfortable, and everything is spotless wherever you go.
Facilities: Because it is a newly opened hotel, the equipment is very new and there are many new gadgets. However, maybe because it is too new, some things are not easy to use, such as the telephone and the shower, which are all operated by buttons. First of all, It will take half a day to study next time.
Service: Needless to say, I would like to thank Kyle from the banquet sales depar**ent for his remote assistance, and the catering manager Will for cooperating with me to complete the proposal ceremony. I also thanked the guys from the housekeeping depar**ent for helping me clean ~ and this is the best wedding banquet I have ever encountered in a hotel. A family to eat~
I am really looking forward to it, and I am also looking forward to experiencing the beauty of Kimpton again during the wedding.

Health: It is a newly opened hotel. Everything is new and the health service is very good.
Facilities: The key points to mention are Kimpton’s facilities, which we, as design studios, would like to pay a lot of money for. First of all, the lobby on the first floor uses a large simulated fireplace. The lobby has a very high ceiling, and the design of the bookshelf on one side of the front desk and an artistic staircase installation are shallow. Put it on the bookshelf wall and take a look at the matching integrated basin and bathtub in the room. These bathroom products are all imported from Switzerland. Laufen is from the Swiss imported brand Laufen, which is Hermès in the bathroom industry. The faucet and shower are Hansgrohe’s high-end series AXOR toilet INAX. There is also a small sink for makeup removal on the side of the alcove of the Dyson washbasin. The design is too avant-garde. The washing and care products are Bloom Aromatherapy Room coffee machine Nespresso kettle Italian SMEG tea products TA small tea cans and four mini bars. It's all free
The basins in public areas such as the swimming pool are Hansgrohe marble slates with under-counter basins. The only drawback is that the gym is a bit small and there is no sauna for bathing in the swimming pool.
The overall style of the hotel is dark and night-style. Even the toilet paper is black.

The room attendants will tidy up and clean every time they come back. The snail girl moisturizes everything quietly. The room will be tidied when I come back. I have never seen this kind of trea**ent in domestic hotels except in the Maldives. The minibar is free including alcoholic beverages, and parking is free. There is a direct drinking water pipe in the refrigerator cabinet, which is very convenient for making tea and so on.

The room has been upgraded with a kettle from the suite Smag, a sink from Laufen and a toilet from Inai. The experience is very good... The dark style is fashionable and modern and is very suitable for Qiantan and Positioned in Shanghai, the room is really not big, but you can choose aromatherapy at the entry level. I like it very much. The executive lounge on the fifth floor is very impressive, and the sunset is so beautiful... At night, the chole bar is full of glamorous nightclubs, which is super beautiful... reflects When I had a little problem, I immediately sent macarons to upgrade the room. The service was very good... The concierge manager should be from Hong Kong... a super nice woman. Breakfast is buffet style until 10:30, very authentic, Benedict and English dishes. I love the meal... The only thing is that there is no full-length mirror. It would be more perfect if there was one... I am satisfied. My friend said it is better than other hotels of the same level... I will go there again.

There are not many dishes in the restaurant, but the taste is good and up to standard. Special thanks to the man at the front desk for the macarons and chocolates. When I checked out, the hotel did not rush me to check out due to hypoglycemia. I was disturbed and allowed me to rest in the room for an hour. Thank you very much to the lady at the front desk and a young brother who was also very enthusiastic. I didn't notice the name. Thank you very much for a good experience and will come back next time.

The hotel's distance from Taikoo Li Qiantan is slightly less advantageous than Qiantan Shangri-La.

I especially like the super textured black round bathtub in their bathroom🛁. It is paired with fragrant bath salts and music. It is very nice. Cozy, the smart mirror🪞 in the washing area can automatically eliminate fog, full marks for this detail💯. I really like the leisure area on the 5th floor and the bar on the 8th floor. The a**osphere is full of photos and check-ins💯, and by the way, the mini bar is the first round. It’s free🆓, everyone can eat it with confidence

Although this is not the first time to stay at Kimpton, the service every time makes people feel very warm. From the check-in request to the welcome fruit 🍉 to check-out, every step is still very good.

Breakfast 🥣When I stayed at Kimpton for the first time, the breakfast was semi-buffet style. The texture and taste of the freshly made breakfast were really good. This Valentine's Day 💌 it was changed to a full buffet during the Chinese New Year. During the Chinese New Year 🧨, the number of people staying was relatively high. The manager also explained afterwards, but I feel that the taste of the full buffet is indeed not as good as that of the semi-buffet. I would like to inform you in advance next time. You can also indicate on the details page that the breakfast is a full buffet.

Overall, it is a very good hotel. I will come again next time.

Even though they have been upgraded to the writer's suite, the room availability rate is still very low. No other issues except being small. People who like it will like it very much, and people who don't like it may complain about it. But vacation is supposed to be a resting place, so it’s not a good idea to be quiet and quiet.

First of all, I want to say that the design style of Kimpton Hotel Pudong is really unique, full of modernity and art. The industrial style decoration of the entire hotel makes people feel very fashionable and gives people a new experience.

During my stay, I was very impressed with the hotel's service and facilities. The hotel staff are very warm and friendly, always smiling and making you feel welcome. In addition, the hotel's facilities are also very complete, including comfortable beds, clean and tidy bathrooms, and sufficient free Wi-Fi, which made me feel very comfortable and convenient during my stay.

Of course, every hotel has its pros and cons. Regarding Kimpton Hotel Pudong, I think its biggest advantage is its unique design style, which can bring a new visual experience to people. At the same time, the hotel's services and facilities are also excellent, making people feel at home.

Overall, I rate the Kimpton Hotel Pudong very highly. I highly recommend staying here to those who like to try and pursue fashionable experiences. Of course, if the hotel can further improve some detailed services, then I believe more consumers will choose here.

I had dinner and breakfast there. The environment was pleasant, not crowded, the a**osphere was very relaxed, and the food was exquisite and delicious, especially the steaks and desserts for dinner, which were all excellent. Breakfast is a semi-buffet with a full range of options, including Chinese and Western style choices. Very good hotel, will visit again next time.

msg:This Kimpton hotel has a strong sense of design. You will feel a strong visual impact as soon as you enter the door. The huge fire and bookcases make you feel like you are in a large palace. It is worthy of being the darling of the emerging model of Qiantan Hotel. Thank you very much to my colleague in the front office, Johan. He was very hospitable and took us to the hotel room. Johan knew the inside of the hotel very well and thoughtfully introduced us to various smart facilities in the room, restaurant business hours, etc. Many Internet celebrities come to Kimpton to check in and take photos. If you are also passionate about life, believe me, Kimpton Qiantan will definitely bring you different surprises.

msg:Objectively evaluate the advantages:
The overall facilities of the hotel are very good
It also fits the tone of the hotel, and the room has a sense of design.
The guest room is very smart, especially the bathroom has a control panel. You can also control the room music when taking a bath. It feels good and has everything you need.

shortcoming:
As a high-end hotel with this positioning, it must be said that the service staff is very poor. The key point is that the girls in brown clothes at the front desk are so sad... I don't check in to see their bad faces.
Starting from the doorman, when we arrived at the hotel, we didn’t even know how to pick up a box. We had two boxes and two bags of stuff that day, and the doorman was watching us move them by ourselves. It was the first time, and it was amazing!
Objectively speaking, the service level of the male echelon in white clothes is very good. At least they are polite and know how to help deliver the boxes when leaving... I really don't think this request is hypocritical...

Next, I understand that new hotels need publicity, but I see Internet celebrity girls taking photos there everywhere. Isn’t it too annoying? Can you please take care of it... Some of them take photos there without even checking in, just like the Pheasant Hotel. …

Especially the bartender on the 5th floor, why are you so sad? Why is this hotel so sad... If you don't want the social hour service, why don't you open it? Otherwise, we will charge a fee. Don't do it. It's like owing money, there's really no need...

The bad reviews are all about the above-mentioned service staff. The standard is really too poor. In addition to the guest rooms, the five-star hotel also includes service and reception... I hope to give a reminder to the guests who are about to stay. If you care about the experience, Think about it...it's really sad...

Also, the room service sister, could you please stop coming to clean up the guest room without saying hello? Just after checking in and leaving for a while, the garbage in the room was collected. She was very diligent, but I was really shocked...

There are also good ones. The concierge guy in black clothes who helped us carry our luggage that day was pretty good. When we got to the room, he even knew how to introduce the guest room to us because there were some features such as TVs that could be stored. In fact, it was just a simple sentence. At least we could watch it. Gain basic respect…

To the girls at the front desk of our hotel, thank you very much for giving us such a great experience. Your good mood has been ruined...

msg:The newly opened Kimpton in Qiantan has an industrial-style design as a distinctive feature. The bedroom does not have too much ceiling design, and with the marble wall cabinets, the sense of space is impressive. The bathroom is also completely partitioned. Compared with many small bathtubs, the double bathtub is definitely the best among Shanghai hotels. Because it is a new hotel, it uses a lot of smart designs, including mirrors with adjustable brightness and a water bar that can be raised and lowered by remote sensing. The pull-out table board is the only design that I think is a little thoughtless. After all, the marble board is still very cold in winter, and the fixed height may not be suitable for everyone. The bedding is very comfortable, and the bathrobe is also very good, so comfortable that I want to buy it home. The hotel has an a la carte menu for breakfast, and the variety provided is relatively rich. The Western food is pretty good, but the Chinese food is really average. The front desk is very welcoming, the concierge is also very friendly, parking is convenient, and it is suitable for frequent visits.

As soon as you enter the lobby, you feel that the entire floor is very high and very grand. There is a blanket place on the sofa in the lobby, which is perfect for girls who love taking pictures. There is a whole fireplace behind it to create a winter a**osphere. Whether it’s the lobby, the hall on the 5th floor or the small bar on the 8th floor, strong December Chris**as decorations are everywhere, especially at the end of the 5th floor. There is a lounge bar with a super large and exquisite Chris**as tree, and a spiral staircase. Simply perfect. There are tall display cabinets with many books inside, which is like a dream home. The interior design of the hotel room is in the dark metal style, simple and elegant, and all the home appliances are also very technological. The mirror in the bathroom has a touch screen dimming mode. When taking a bath, you can also use the color-changing glass to block it with one click. I especially like the large black square bathtub. The caring aunt gave me two packs of rose petals for bathing, and the toiletries are also complete. There is a Dyson hairdryer and a vanity mirror with an LED light in the closet. This is really a plus. Girls who put on makeup must understand how important it is to have a well-lit mirror when staying in a hotel! There is also a small air cushion massage comb, Nespresso capsule coffee in the minibar, and a SMEG kettle. All kinds of thoughtful details make people feel really at home. There is a faux fur blanket placed on the red leather sofa, and the coffee cup is also made of different shapes of black and gray special patterns. It is full of Nordic style, and the light in the whole room is not dazzling, just right! Will stay here next time!

When I checked into Kimpton, I was greeted by the post-modern metal design style, which focuses on one quality. It resembles mountain spring water packaged in oat milk. The bartender uses thick cubes of ice to create the first taste of Chris**as🎄. The waves of the infinity pool are turbulent in the cold weather, but they can't match the warmth of the fireplace lights in the lobby and room. Attentive service in the packed breakfast. The charm of French cuisine in the restaurant on the eighth floor is irresistible. I will plant grass again if I have the chance.

msg:There were a lot of people at night on New Year's Eve. I liked the hotel's style very much. However, before using the bathtub, I found hair from the previous guest and some tape left by someone else. I immediately fell in love with it. The tape under the shower stall was not tight either. , the water sprayed from the top was very uneven, and after 10 minutes of washing, the water flooded the mountain, and even flowed outside the bathroom. The top of the bar will rise but there is no warning. It feels like small things will fall in if you put something on it.
I went to the bar for the New Year's Eve event in the evening. The overall a**osphere was good, but the bartender seemed too busy. The whiskey was mixed with small ice cubes, and the whole bar was in chaos. The scenery is beautiful, the wine is a bit expensive, and the snacks are cheaper than expected.
Generally speaking, the bathroom conditions are not up to the level they should be, and other aspects are online.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first. The room facilities are very good. They have their own characteristics and are very smart. When I first entered the room, I sent a photo to a friend to praise it, so I was looking forward to checking in, but I will definitely not come again in the future. The room decoration The smell is really strong! My throat also became very uncomfortable, so I sprayed some perfume to cover it up at night. After lying on the bed, I found that I haven’t slept on such a soft bed for a long time. The kind that sinks in is very uncomfortable for me. (Some people may like Soft bed), I couldn't fall asleep until one or two in the morning, and I kept having nigh**ares when I finally fell asleep. I slept for two or three hours all night, woke up at about six o'clock, and went downstairs to have breakfast at seven o'clock. The breakfast was average. , there are very few options, I asked for an iced American style, but there was no ice on it, it was as bland as water, (see picture) the experience was very bad, I haven’t slept so badly in a hotel for a long time... I am a Ctrip diamond member , I stay in hotels many times every year, and rarely write reviews. Real experiences are for reference.

msg:This may be the most suitable hotel for IHG to take photos and check in. The lobby, rest space, swimming pool, restaurant and other public areas are all very suitable for taking photos and checking in. It is very photogenic. The room is not too big, the big black bathtub is very pleasant to take a bath in, and the room facilities are also very automated. The service from the front desk to the restaurant is also very professional. In short, the advantages are outstanding.
But it is not suitable if it is a parent-child relationship. In addition, the breakfast is not rich, and it is generally more Western-style, with relatively few Chinese-style items, which is suitable for a group photo. .

When I checked in to get takeout, I accidentally discovered that the hotel opposite is the headquarters of Li Jiaqi Beauty One. The hotel is also quite close to Taikoo Li Qiantan. I can’t say that there is a lot of food, drink and shopping in the nearby area, but it has pretty much what you should have. Anyway, the newly opened ones are worth a try.

smaller. The infinity pool has a great view, but it's a pity that it can only be viewed.

The supporting facilities of the hotel are a bit lacking, but fortunately, Taikoo Li is a 10-minute walk away. I originally planned to eat at Xin Rong Ji, but I didn't expect that the weekend business was so busy that it was fully booked. However, the dining room upstairs was also very satisfying, and you can start after eating. It’s buy buy buy mode.

msg:Kimpton has always been my favorite brand, and I am very happy to finally check in to the second Kimpton store in **************! Taking Suzhou as a precedent last year, Kimpton Beach in Shanghai has obviously made substantial progress. Special thanks to Director of Guest Relations Sheryn Lui for arranging the writer’s residence and the generous welcome gift! In addition to my favorite desserts, the fruit plate was full of fruits, and there were also handwritten cards with heart-warming sentiments, which were brought to my heart~ She also took me to visit the different room types, and explained in detail the space design of the rooms, and the personal experience. Quite grateful for a hotel lover.

The minibar in the suite can be used free of charge, and guests will also be asked to prefer their own fragrance before check-in, fully demonstrating Kimpton's warm hospitality etiquette. I would like to express my special thanks to the guest room floor manager and the waiters for all the preparations for the room, which made me feel like I am home. Dark-style decoration is relatively rare. The large area of ​​black tone is not cold or oppressive. The wood color, gold and various different materials add a sense of warmth, showing the aesthetics of interior design that combines hardness and softness. This delicate layer change is really The strength of the designer is admirable!

At the same time, I had the pleasure to communicate with Will from the catering and Jessie from the bar. Both of them provided great service and interaction. As for social time, like Suzhou, it still lacks service awareness. It can only be said that the culture of interacting with strangers is still not adapted to the Chinese culture, and it still needs time to adapt and more training.

What is ridiculous is that outsiders take photos in the public area of ​​the hotel every day. They will even deliberately stay in the elevator and wait for guests to swipe their room cards and go upstairs. This move really affects the guest experience and brings unsafety. It is hoped that the hotel can introduce appropriate countermeasures in the future. As an internationally renowned boutique hotel brand, Kimpton should focus on providing truly luxurious services and does not need any publicity or advertising by these low-quality influencers with fake faces. In particular, those people's clothing and indecent sitting postures are not in line with Kimpton's brand image. I sincerely hope that the hotel can think deeply, clearly understand the positioning of its own brand, and firmly stand on the Kimpton brand position, instead of lowering the limit and compromising and following the practices of other low-end hotels in the country.

Thank you all for arranging this stay experience, and I look forward to your next stay ~

Although the room is not big, it feels like being at home. The leisure space on the 5th floor is very private. The hotel is relatively close to Taikoo Li Qiantan. Both food and accommodation are very comfortable. Note that my mother thoughtfully gave me cakes and fruits on her birthday. The only shortcoming is the public space on the 5th floor. The air conditioning is not turned on enough and it is a bit cold. During the Happy Hour at 5 o'clock, you can have self-service drinks and desserts, but the attitude of the waiters you encounter is not nice. I hope the hotel can improve! Overall, I am satisfied and will consider staying here next time.

msg:If you want to find a quiet and stylish hotel in Shanghai for the first time, I recommend Kimpton Qiantan Shanghai.
I brought two babies and my mother suddenly decided to fly back from California. It took less than three days to make the decision. All plans/strategies were thrown behind my mind, and I ran back dragging a bunch of baby food rations. It took me two days of overseas phone calls to decide where to stay. I compared the Peninsula Hotel/Male Villa/J/W/Jianye Capella/The Seclusion in the bustling Wukang Road Mansion, etc. Let’s compare them one by one. , after all, I came from a large rural area, my opinions are for reference only, if you don’t like it, please don’t comment🙃
After landing at the airport in Pudong, I wanted to give my baby the nearest way to rest as soon as possible, so I started to look through the Little Red Book, but the more I read, the more I noticed that they were all Disney fan B&Bs/small hotels, and the quality varied. Qi, in the era of Internet celebrities, you can’t be sure which one is real and which one is~
So I decided to give up the nearby accommodation and call the Peninsula Hotel instead. I must mention here that as far as the hotel front desk calls I have called, the first impressions of the Peninsula Hotel and Kimpton are very good and professional. It's considerate and considerate, and it feels more like having a conversation with you rather than pressing options on an expensive telephone machine. We will not push you the information about your hotel, but will patiently give you some travel suggestions. I would like to give you a little red flower🌸 to the lady at the Kimpton front desk who answered my call for the first time. Her kind and considerate service will not be given to you at all. Pressure, and recommending destinations related to your problem very considerately for you. This is the prerequisite for me to choose Kimpton in the end among a bunch of hotels.
Regarding the facilities, after checking a bunch of Xiaohongshu, I originally planned the second option, which was to drive farther from the airport, live directly in the core area, and check out the three-piece suit, so with this idea in mind, I checked into a few big hotels. , but with little effect. This depends on the first point just mentioned. On the contrary, it highlights what true professionalism is. Because of the feedback given by the front desk, I dismissed those old hotels with river views one by one. At the same time, I was persuaded to leave by the skewered rustic style of the rooms in J Hotel~
At this time, the stylish Mahler Villa/Jianye Jiapelli/Busty Wukang Road Mansion came into view again. As for Mahler, the architectural style and the blessing of Internet posts are quite interesting, but after all, I know very well about accommodation in this kind of old house. After trying it out, after talking to the front desk who was also very nice, the microphone was stolen and the slightly noisy environment persuaded me to leave. The reason was that the facilities were old and I was afraid of sound insulation issues. Therefore, although the two noble-style hotels at the back have outstanding styles, they are still renovated old buildings. The small alleys in Jianye always feel a bit eerie. Of course, I have never been there and I don’t have an opinion. I’m just talking about what I see online.
At this time, Kimpton came into my mind again. After a long day of tired communication, I felt like vomiting when I thought of the hotel. Finally, I locked in two hotels that could prepare some birthday gifts for my baby. At this time, Kimpton won again, because the baby It was my third birthday on the day I got off the plane. I was always debating whether it would be best if the hotel could help decorate the room. But after asking a few people, they all said they could send some cakes or small gifts. However, the Kimpton concierge’s service was unsatisfactory from the beginning. Leading the way, I first asked weakly if there was any airport pick-up service. Compared with the price offered by Peninsula before, it was much more affordable, so I continued to ask if I could add a child seat. I sent many text messages to communicate and finally found the one that suits us. Plan, I haven’t booked a room at this time. With such service, who wouldn’t be tempted to go to the hotel to experience it for themselves? After all, everyone prefers a home-away-from-home experience!
Then after more than ten hours of exhaustion, dragging a lot of luggage, in the pick-up tunnel of Pudong Airport built with a human wall several hundred meters long, I actually saw the baby in the middle of the exit. The welcome message I wrote when I picked up the airport was so star-like. Unfortunately, there were so many things that I didn’t even take a photo. I can only rely on bragging to feel like a star~
The hotel's low-key luxury feel is on point. I really like the various sculptures in the lobby, especially the quiet and dim spotlights at the elevator, which instantly takes you into a private space for rest.
Next is all the strategies that you don’t have time to do. You only need to communicate with the concierge service WeChat, or the WeChat of the front desk team ~ the WeChat of the catering team ~ WeChat, yes, you heard it right 😂 It’s all more than one V of WeChat plus phone number With the butler assistant service, you instantly have countless hands to help you query/compare/finally find the right solution! like!
What is particularly worth mentioning is that, perhaps because of the baby's birthday, the hotel manager came to take care of us as soon as we arrived. He was very considerate, and with just one glance, he made suggestions based on experience, worrying that our excessive luggage would affect us. It was so comfortable that we could let the service store some of our luggage first, but because we wanted to send some things away the next day, we refused to save trouble. Looking back now, I really regret it🥹
Okay, enough nonsense!
In short, to sum up in one sentence, when you choose Kimpton Qiantan Hotel Shanghai, you can get a whole team of hotel butler services while staying in the hotel, so it is not 1V1, it is 12345678910~V1!

msg:I didn’t want to complain at first, but I still want to complain about their hair dryer! Everything was fine at first, but when I checked out, I used a hair dryer to dry my hair. Then while drying my hair, I smelled a sticky smell, and suddenly the hair dryer made a loud bang and tripped! No electricity! ! ! ! The hotel phone didn't work because it had no power. We used our mobile phone to inform us of what happened, but no waiter came to explain. Only the repairman came, but his attitude was very good! Thanks so much for getting the electricity here. In such a high-end hotel, the hair dryer can actually trip, and the waiter didn't say anything. Fortunately, there was no power outage, which is a blessing among misfortunes! Everything else is fine. In short, this incident has never happened before! ! ! I don’t want to talk any more! that's all.

msg:I made a reservation on Ctrip to extend my stay the next day. Ctrip had a guarantee payment, so I chose this one and booked the room without paying attention. At noon, I went to the front desk to swipe my room card and they didn’t ask me to pay for the room. I booked again on the third day. Yes, I paid directly. I called the front desk to ask for sanitary napkins and was told that it would cost 15 yuan. I thought that the 1,000 deposit would be deducted directly from it. I didn't expect that after they were delivered, I was asked to pay in cash. I called the front desk to ask the second question. The room charges for the first and third days need to be paid in cash at the front desk. I said that I had already paid for the third day. On the second day, I explained that I would pay directly when I went to swipe the room card. This made people feel very sad. No, it’s almost 6,000 for a 3-day stay. Why don’t I give you the 15 yuan thing? I made a mistake in my work and didn’t remind the guests. I didn’t even have time to wait for people to come downstairs? What is the deposit required for? Will guests steal your hotel facilities? Ctrip cooperates with you to guarantee and suspects that the guest acts like he owes the room fee.

But when you are in it, you don’t need any extra explanation. It is a refined and elegant sense of high-end, and the design inspiration of the lobby It comes from the writer's residence and incorporates French furniture, fireplace, wine cabinet, bookcase and other design elements. In short, it is well worth a stay!

There is actually drinking water. The complimentary drinking water and tea are also quite high-end.

The sofa is actually covered with a fur blanket, which matches the brand’s feather logo.
Although the breakfast is a set meal, it is very exquisite
The surrounding area is Taikoo Li. The starting price of a taxi. We checked in Tsutaya Bookstore and Fanji.
The only drawback is that there is no floor-to-ceiling mirror, there is no view of the office building outside the window, and the infinity pool is not open.

msg:When Kimpton Daan Hotel Taipei opened, I first noticed this brand acquired by IHG. There are currently three Kimpton stores. Qiantan is the third best. In 1981, Bill Kimpton founded the hotel brand of the same name in San Francisco with the aim of breaking the industry monopoly of luxury hotels and humble hotels. He put forward the important ideas of "three requirements" for the development of Kimpton, namely "beautiful, livable, and excellent restaurants." Subsequently, Kimpton gradually developed into the gold standard of boutique hotels, and many Kimpton restaurants have become dining destinations in the city. In 2014, Kimpton@ was acquired by IHG and moved to the group's "luxury and lifestyle" category, beginning its global development. Recently, I stayed at the Kimpton Qiantan Hotel in Shanghai and experienced the Shanghai lifestyle.

msg:The second Kimpton hotel in the country has opened in Qiantan, Shanghai - Kimpton Qiantan Hotel Shanghai, designed by American designer Robbyn Carter, combines the romantic elegance of Paris with the Shanghai-style modernity of Shanghai. The unique qualities of the two cities.
I also feel that there is an old money style from "The Great Gatsby" that I like. The combination of black and gold brings a luxurious feeling of paper-dazzled gold~

The lobby designed by the designer's living room feels very good. The electric fireplace and the blanket on the sofa give it a lazy and cozy feel. When you check in, the front desk will prepare a welcome drink and essential oil scent, which is full of ritual.
The lounge on the 5th floor is inspired by a brewery. Huge floor-to-ceiling windows, wall-to-wall bookshelves, Internet-famous retro spiral staircase... It is full of a**osphere, and watching the sunset during evening social time is also a pleasure.
The open-air infinity swimming pool on the roof faces the Pujiang River and stretches as far as the eye can see. Feel the charm of this city ~ enjoy the invincible river view, taking pictures here is particularly beautiful!
LE Chloé restaurant, where you can enjoy authentic and creative French cuisine. The fountain on the terrace is designed to have the feel of a Parisian garden ~ the breakfast is also very delicious.
The hardware and software are good, and the shopping mall is not far away, just across the road. It's also about 10 minutes away from Taikoo Hui.

There is an iconic fire in the middle of the check-in lobby to keep people warm in the cold winter. The service staff were very enthusiastic. Johan from the front office took the initiative to introduce us to the room facilities and took us to visit the hotel's tourist check-in lounge. The lounge is very spacious and you can see the Huangpu! Jiang, the view and lighting are great. The hotel has many places to check in, which is very exciting. When we checked in, it happened to be dusk in the evening. The setting sun dyed the sky red, and the sky gradually darkened, indicating that the nightlife was about to begin, bringing unparalleled and shocking scenery. The photos taken casually, the original camera comes with built-in retouching, quiet and beautiful. Standing in the infinity pool at sunset and taking photos with your besties, it feels like an urban female CEO admiring the sunset from the pool on the top floor of her villa. Highly recommend everyone to check in and check in

You can choose coffee and other drinks when checking in. The staff will lead you to the room and explain the details carefully.
The hotel has a total of 143 rooms, located on the 5th to 7th floors of the hotel. The hardware here has a "next era" feel. The TV, bar, and marble table tops can all be raised and lowered automatically by remote control. The bathroom is equipped with a direct drinking water faucet and type-c interface 4. The glass candle fireplace is beautiful. The shower switch is Button-type software. The toiletries are from the niche brand Atelier Bloem. I love the smell. The bathrobe feels great + the slippers are of good quality.
Breakfast: Semi-buffet style, the overall product is very exquisite. The staff I met were very professional and greeted politely.
The public area is really amazing! If we use other hotels as a reference, the large public rest area + the giant floor-to-ceiling windows facing the West Bank skyline are really cool.
In summary, the online service and hardware are unparalleled. If you want to stay away from the attractions and crowds, Kimpton Qiantan is probably the most fashionable and cool hotel choice in Shanghai.

The newly opened hotel in Shanghai at the end of August 2023 is located in the Qiantan Sifang City complex. [Kimpton brand] belongs to the "luxury boutique brand" of InterContinental Hotels. It is currently the second hotel opened in Shanghai in China. The architectural design was completed by the American KPF Architectural Firm, and the hotel's interior design was designed by Robbyn Carter, a partner of the American HBA Interior Design Firm, to create a highly "social" urban living room that combines the Shanghai style a**osphere of fashionable Paris and modern Shanghai.
Innovative design art concept. After the stay experience, you can feel that the designer has captured Shanghai's fashion, Shanghai-style culture, tolerance, and strong social circle. She captured these and applied them to the design of various spaces in the hotel. The attitude of the staff is very good. The lady at the front desk will ask what I want to drink when checking in. The coffee tastes very good.
Room: The overall style is dark. The TV, bar and desk in the room can be controlled by remote control. It is very high-tech. The large bathtub in the bathroom is very large, and the bath is very comfortable~ It also uses a Dyson hair dryer, which is high-end!
Breakfast: It is a semi-buffet. Although there are not many things, the taste and presentation are good.
The entire hotel is very suitable for young Internet celebrities to check in and take pictures. The infinity pool on the roof is very good for taking pictures and the lounge can see beautiful sunsets. Well worth staying again!

The surrounding area is completely unfinished
As soon as you check in, you will be greeted warmly.
There is also a dedicated person who will bring you into the room and introduce you to the room.
It's just a little bit decorative
The decoration in the room is not very smelly. It's okay.
But it’s a bit boring after staying there for a long time
Call the front desk and ask the front desk to send me an air purifier.
The result was forgotten…
After dinner outside, return to the room
Discover the considerate turndown service
Also because we saw a birthday boy on our ID card
Prepare birthday cake for us
But I still forgot the air purifier...
We also went to the bar on the eighth floor in the evening.
The bartending is very good and the decoration is also very beautiful.
The breakfast the next day was also very a**ospheric
Made to order
The service is very attentive
Check in as a whole
I feel like maybe it’s not perfect enough just a few weeks after opening.
However, the service staff felt that their training was not sufficient.
Another suggestion is that the uniforms should fit better.
Several of them wore clothes that were obviously too big and loose and looked sloppy.
The external image of the overall service staff needs to be strengthened
The attitude is very good and very considerate.
But I hope the appearance will be neater and neater
Great hotel experience. The decoration and equipment are very comfortable.
I'll go back after it's perfected.

The hotel's own French restaurant is really nice when you wake up in the morning and go through the corridor with a garden setting to have breakfast. It is semi-buffet style and can be ordered a la carte. There is bread, bagels, ham, cheese and fruit salad. The bonus is that there are freshly squeezed fruits in the fruit section.

msg:The Kimpton Hotel is the second one in China and a brand new original KIMPTON. It is designed by American designer ROBBYN CARTER who is good at metal sculptures. The two lounges on the fifth floor are the most outstanding places in the entire hotel. The entire three-story high wall is filled with bookshelves. There are wine-making equipment, wrought iron spiral staircases, and Gufram red lip sofas. The lifting bar in the living room and a complete set of Swiss black Laufen bathroom ware are highlights, with a luxurious but not arrogant fusion of Chinese and Western styles. The semi-buffet breakfast in the French restaurant is great, especially the French waffles. The bar is filled with crystal and oil painting styles, which makes people unconsciously think of being in England.

msg:Overall, I'm quite satisfied, and the experience is better than Kimpton Suzhou. The decoration style of the hotel is not my favorite, but I can still feel the dark, low-key and luxurious style.

Service: The service in the front office, guest room and catering are all good, especially the curly and thin handsome guy at the front desk. The service was courteous and appropriate, which made me feel good. Room service is accurate and timely.

Facilities: The infinity swimming pool on the ninth floor can really make people "wow", but there are a little less other fitness facilities.

Let’s talk about what you’re not satisfied with. In the afternoon, I saw a few Internet celebrities wearing slippers and taking photos in the lobby. Well, I felt that the level of the hotel was suddenly lowered. There are too few buffet varieties for breakfast, and there is no coconut that comes standard with Kimpton fruits. There is too much room for improvement in the Chinese snacks made a la carte, and only the French bread is quite satisfactory. The entire breakfast is inferior to Kimpton Suzhou. After all, the house price is more expensive than in Suzhou.

msg:Kimpton Qiantan is definitely the most cost-effective hotel during this trip to Shanghai. Beautiful from outside to inside. The facilities are new, the service is good, the experience is great, and it is very friendly to children. If you like privacy and luxury, Kimpton Qiantan is really a good choice!

Restaurant: The restaurant is beautiful, the only drawback is that it is a bit small. Consider opening outdoor areas. The hotel's semi-buffet breakfast is also very rich.

Room facilities: Great room! With oversized bathtub and free minibar. When walking in the corridor and meeting the housekeeping staff, they are all greeted cordially, which is really heartwarming.

Service: What touched us the most was that the beautiful Malaysian manager loved children very much. My child kept chatting with others using those plastic English sentences. I will stay here again next time I come to Shanghai! And the concierge staff are also very welcoming.

msg:Kimpton in Qiantan has finally opened. I came to check in as soon as possible. It is a brand of Kimpton Intercontinental. I have never stayed here before and it is my first time to come here. The style of the hotel is low-key and luxurious. The dark tones are really cool, elegant and yet elegant. Flamboyant, low-key gorgeousness~
When checking in, the front desk will ask you what drinks you like, which is very considerate. We will also take guests to their rooms for introductions. The color of the whole room is very high-end and very high-tech.
The three-story ceiling of the hotel's lounge is really amazing, with industrial-style brewing equipment and a very impressive spiral staircase. It is the next internet celebrity check-in spot! The French chole on the 8th floor is of very high quality. Fully open kitchen fine dinning configuration. Next to it is a modern retro bar, which has a luxurious nightclub feel, similar to the Moulin Rouge!
The best thing is that the infinity pool on the top floor is so beautiful. It has a panoramic view of the entire Huangpu River and faces the West Bank on the opposite bank. The best angle is from the terrace on the 9th floor to the 8th floor. The perspective is amazing!

msg:Kimpton Hotel Shanghai Qiantan

The early promotion of InterContinental’s public account was followed by the invitation of designer Robbyn Carter to shoot hotel design explanations, which aroused my strong interest.

I have to say that the public area is beautiful, and the real scene is almost the same as the renderings. The original design concept of the storage wall on the left side of the hotel lobby does not yet provide the fragrance experience. It has been adjusted to provide hotel customized essential oils when checking in, which can be used in the aromatherapy machine in the room. . Currently on the shelves are wine containers, which can be ordered on demand. The background wall of the leisure area on the fifth floor of the hotel is inspired by the brewery. The space is dominated by black tones, translucent curtains, and a retro spiral staircase are all highlights.

The guest rooms are located on the 5th to 7th floors. The integrated floor and carpet design in the corridor has the feel of a hotel apar**ent, which effectively avoids the noise caused by people moving around in the public area.

The shower room space in the room is slightly smaller, the basin is unique, but it is slightly crowded when only one double occupancy can be used at the same time. The bathtub is all black, and the soft decoration elements in the room are consistent. The hotel also prepares rose petals. The intelligent part of the room is full of design.

The hotel has only one all-day dining restaurant, Le Chloe, a fusion restaurant of French and Shanghainese cuisine, which is compatible with breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner. The restaurant kitchen is fully open, but the shortcoming is obvious. The range hood can only be heard in the back half of the restaurant. The service staff did not warn in advance, so the dinner was spent with the chef's louder conversation and the high-intensity operation of the range hood. , extremely noisy. During the trial operation, the menu was very simple. The steak and halibut were quite satisfactory, but the chef's salad was paired with a sweet one. Semi-buffet breakfast, the eggs benedict and ravioli that we tried were amazing. The buffet section includes bread bagels, cheese and ham. What is particularly worth mentioning is the homemade freshly squeezed juices, including regular fruits and vegetables and fitness-friendly ones (including celery) , cucumbers, carrots, etc.).

The hotel gym is small but has everything you need, and is connected to the outdoor infinity pool (not currently open for use).

There are bicycles available for rent at the door of the hotel at any time. The hotel is located in the park. Currently, some of the surrounding land is still under construction, and sporadic decoration noise can be heard.

There are still some shortcomings in the current trial operation that need to be mentioned:

First of all, due to the outstanding design of the bar in the hotel, it is a popular place for brand events. It has been booked by the brand for several weeks in a row on Fridays. This Friday, there are also cases where the venue is reserved by a brand and cannot be admitted. The hotel has contacted the hotel in advance because the bar cannot be admitted. The swimming pool area is open until 10:30 pm on that day, but the swimming pool is still not open for use and can only be provided for check-in on that day. guests take photos.

When I mentioned that I wanted to go to the bar after checking out, just to visit without providing service, the front desk staff kept the phone on silent when asking the leader, complained to other staff about how they always received such calls, and the tone of the complaint was passed directly to the phone. On this side, I don’t know if she knows that I heard her complaints.

The essential oils given during check-in were also a random event. I did not receive them when I checked in. The reply I received was that the essential oils had been distributed temporarily. A new batch had been reserved but had not yet been delivered to the hotel. I was told to get it next time I checked in. Later, the lobby manager Make up for it. (In principle, 2 copies are provided for 2 people staying). The design of the hotel room card is unique and environmentally friendly. When leaving the hotel, I asked to keep the room card as a souvenir, and the lobby manager agreed~

At 10:30 on the night of check-in, I found that hot water could not come out of the bathtub and the water in the washing area was normal. When the maintenance staff arrived, they said they needed to dismantle the washing area for repairs and called the front desk to change rooms. As a newly opened hotel, it is unreasonable to just tinker with it during the trial operation.

The hotel room area has a taste of decoration.

The all-day restaurant afternoon tea is open at 3pm. Considering that it would be too long to wait for three hours in the hotel after checking out at 12pm, I called the front desk to coordinate whether it could be packed away. The guy at the front desk asked me to ask after the afternoon tea opened at 3pm. Considering it was the same restaurant, after I offered to help transfer to the restaurant, he said he would ask the restaurant for me and then get back to me. It feels like the front desk has no training...

The black bathtub in the room is completely eye-catching, and the bathroom even has a direct drinking water system!
The swimming pool is very beautiful. There are very few infinity swimming pools with river views like this in China. Unfortunately, it is not open yet because we have not obtained the permit.
It just feels like the overall brightness of the hotel is a little small.

The cup of fragrant coffee when checking in at the front desk and the warm words of the customer service staff are like the warm autumn sun. What is very distinctive is not only the azure gem-like infinity pool and the red-lip sofa, but also the delicious semi-buffet breakfast and the hidden room facilities. A lot of attention has been paid to the details. It was a wonderful trip, and I look forward to the surprises next time I stay.

1️⃣My first time staying at Kimpton, it was indeed a worthwhile trip. The day before I was about to check into the hotel, I received a confirmation call from Sister Cheng from the reservation depar**ent. Her voice was sweet, gentle, and very polite. She didn't feel any formulaic words and was very warm. When we entered the hotel the next day, the warm reception from the front desk and the concierge, as well as the professional hotel tour given by Ms. Sheryn, made us better understand the hotel brand culture and service facilities.
2️⃣ My favorite is the hotel's infinity pool (YYDS) which is so beautiful at night😍
3️⃣Strongly recommend everyone to experience the terrace bar🍹🍻🍷🍸🥃🥂
4️⃣BTW, the restaurant chefs are all handsome guys and beauties🤭
5️⃣In a city like Shanghai with such a fast pace of life, this hotel is like an alternative existence. It makes people feel no business a**osphere and makes people feel completely relaxed. It's awesome.
6️⃣All the service staff in the hotel are very enthusiastic. Especially after arriving at the restaurant, their catering manager, Manager Gao, learned our room number and directly addressed us by our last names. This was something I did not experience in my previous hotel stays. I have encountered it before, it is super warm and deserves extra points👍👍👍
7️⃣The hotel breakfast is also very good. Although it is a Semi Buffet and there are not as many varieties as other hotels, the dishes are very finely prepared and the taste and presentation are better than other hotels. I especially recommend the French toast, it is a very traditional kind, the heart is soft and glutinous, the taste is sweet, very good 👍👍👍
8️⃣If you have time, you can also try their afternoon tea, which is also very delicate. I especially like his egg salmon and scones, especially the goat cheese sauce and orange sauce with the scones, which are very delicious😋😋😋

As soon as you enter the lobby, you will be amazed, with dark colors, open space, bead curtains, fireplace, bookcases and wine cabinets on the entire wall, and a large sofa. The staff was very kind, helped me with an umbrella, asked me if I needed coffee or tea, gave me a small bottle of essential oil when I checked in, and there was an aromatherapy machine in the room. The front desk escorted me to the room and briefly introduced the function panel, which was very considerate.
The bar, TV, and desk are all retractable, which is very special. The bathroom has a magic mirror with adjustable lighting and sound, as well as direct drinking water. Hairdryer and garment iron worked well. The mineral water in the hotel is very special, and the milk packaging is very considerate and gives six cans. Drinks and snacks in the minibar are free, and welcome fruits are also given. The glasses in the minibar are beautiful. The packaging of black tea and green tea is also exquisite enough. The sofa in the room is so comfortable.
The lobby, bar, leisure hall, elevator hall, and elevator bridge box all have a sense of design and have their own characteristics. The staff's service is very considerate. Definitely worth a second pass. Although it has just opened, it has no flavor.

A few days before arriving at the store, they will call you in advance to ask you about your arrival time, whether you are driving, and many other services. I really put my heart into the design. There is no one in the rest area on the fifth floor at night, and the view from the three-story building is stunning. The room facilities are full of design and technology, giving people a sense of style and excellent privacy. The only drawback is that the surrounding convenience stores close very early and the quilt on the bedding is slightly thicker. Turn on the air conditioner, not cover the cold and cover the heat😄

It is different from the general InterContinental hotels and feels more suitable for leisure vacations. The area is in a good location, right in Qiantan Sifang City. There are Taikoo Li, Jingyao Qiantan and other shopping malls nearby, and the facilities for dining and shopping are quite complete. The room facilities are novel and high-end, and the most impressive thing is the large black bathtub, which is so dazzling. I came here to celebrate my birthday. My husband called the hotel in advance to prepare a birthday cake, which was very thoughtful. The service is also excellent, especially Yakira at the front desk. The considerate service made our entire stay very enjoyable. Breakfast is semi-buffet style. Although the food is not many, it is very exquisite.

msg:I started paying attention to Kimpton when it was about to settle in Shanghai. I stayed at Kimpton in Da'an, Taipei, and I was deeply impressed. After seeing Ctrip’s opening offer, I immediately arranged a staycation.

Kimpton Qiantan is located next to the Binjiang Park in Qiantan, a quiet place amidst the bustle. It is a five-minute walk from Qiantan Jingyao and ten minutes from Taikoo Li. It is surrounded by business buildings, but most of them are still under renovation, so there are very few people passing by.

Immediately after entering Kimpton, I was greeted by a warm greeting that brought back memories. This should be the overall impression throughout this stay. Every hotel employee is very warm and enthusiastic, hoping to give guests the best experience.

The basic room type is about 30 square meters, with a strong sense of design. The most impressive thing is the lifting minibar and TV, as well as the automatic telescopic table, which strives to not feel cramped in the limited space. The mattress is from Jin Koer, and I sleep on it. very comfortable. The bathroom and toilet are on both sides of the entrance, with plenty of space and a full sense of technology. The bathtub is the biggest I have ever seen. Except for the sofa which is not suitable for lying down, other facilities are quite comfortable.

There are two public rest spaces on the fifth floor, which run through the fifth, sixth and seventh floors. There are few people in the opening and it is very quiet. I don’t know if it will be suitable for chatting when there are many people in the future, but it is quite nice. However, it is more difficult to decorate at right angles in some places. Knocked on accidentally. The swimming pool should be a check-in point for future Internet celebrities, but it is not open yet because the altitude permit has not yet been issued. Watching the sunset by the pool will be very relaxing. The gym is small.

This time there are complimentary afternoon tea and breakfast, both at the French restaurant Chloé. The afternoon tea snacks amazed me and I took a lot of photos. The seating on the terrace is also great, but it’s still a bit hot in Shanghai in September, and October should be very suitable for outdoor seating.

I am very grateful to Yakira for her enthusiastic help this time. I didn’t like the view outside the window in the room I was given at first, but later helped to adjust the room to a room with a better view. I felt refreshed when I woke up the next day. I would also like to thank all the staff in the restaurant, gym and front desk for their enthusiastic help. A very satisfying stay.

msg:The overall service is okay, but other aspects are a bit hard to describe. Opposite the hotel is an office building very close to it. Both sides can clearly see each other, and there is no privacy at all. Even the hotel TV screen is full of snowflakes. The area around the hotel is also deserted. Not even a car can be seen on the road. The only 7/11 where you can buy things downstairs closes at 10 o'clock. Prices started at 2,000 when it first opened. The Kimpton brand is not very well-known in China. Overall, it is indeed on the high side. Could it be the same as Kimpton in Suzhou, which also started at more than 2,000 after just two months? It has dropped to 1300
The overall feeling is that staying at 2000 for one night is a bit of a loss.

Although the room is not big and the floor plan is very ordinary, the blessing of technology and fashion make the room very interesting and increase the experience of staying. The overall style continues the retro and fashionable feeling of the public area, retro Persian carpets, industrial-looking bathroom partition glass, canopy beds and other retro elements, combined with electric film glass (I don’t know if it’s called this, anyway, the glass becomes opaque with a swish), automatically opening minibar and writing desk, automatic upgrade The TV set can be stored in the marble shape of the wall when not in use, which can make the room look more simple. All accessory and tray are made of water-patterned stainless steel, including the bedside table, which also has this effect, replacing the traditional Matte aluminum-colored metal and black metal are used for contrast in the artwork, guest room corridors and rooms. An oversized double laufen bathtub is standard in each room. Every design detail makes me feel that it is in harmony with the traditional hotel. different. View from the entrance. The bathroom has direct drinking water. The height of the vanity and bathtob are the same, but slightly shorter. The garment steamer is standard in new hotels. The minibar and TV are opened. The design of the bedside table also has a water-grained stainless steel effect surface. The interior is still based on wood. The wall lamp is installed on a fixed bed frame, with a ceramic shell. The small round touch screen is the remote control for controlling the minibar TV and writing desk. There is a fireplace effect under the TV, but it is replaced by a decorative lamp, which is more effective than a fake fireplace. much better.
There is no lobby bar in the public area of ​​the hotel. The entire hotel is like an executive lounge concept, with free afternoon tea and drinks. The infinity swimming pool is also a highlight, but the safety permit has not yet been issued, so it can only be taken for photos but cannot be used.

The hotel is in Sifang City and is very close to the office building next to it. This is the hotel's flaw!
The swimming pool is not in operation yet and the staff are sitting at the door like security guards. It’s so funny😆

I heard that today is the first official day of business, but as a person who loves to explore new hotels, I couldn’t help but check in the day before!

It has just opened, so there are still a lot of problems with small details, but overall the flaws are not hidden 8️⃣

👉 Although it has not officially opened yet, Ta's house has already won various design awards. It combines various elements from Shanghai/Paris/Zhang Ailing, with a large area of ​​black as the main tone, which is very bold and visually charming.

👉 It is said that his infinity swimming pool has the best view of the Qiantan Riverside. Unfortunately, it does not exist and is not open. It is said that the permit is still being processed.

👉 Like Kimpton Bamboo Hotel Suzhou, the breakfast here is also semi-buffet style, the service experience will be better, and the food will be fresher and more delicious.

👉 The smart remote control central system in the hotel room can easily control the lifting minibar/TV cabinet/desk, which is full of technology💯

The promotional price for a two-night stay purchased on Ctrip seemed quite cost-effective. The appearance of the hotel is so low-key that you can hardly find it! There was still some construction in the hotel garage when I checked in at night. There were not many guests when I checked in at the lobby. The reception skills at the front desk were OK. I was given a box of mountain spring water, but they didn’t introduce too many hotel facilities. The lights in the lobby were still a little dim. , BGM is good. The interior of the hotel, including the corridors, elevators, and guest rooms, is still very well designed. The shower room is too small and I almost suffocated after taking a shower. There is no need to have such a big bathtub. It is better to design the shower room to be larger. Fruits and sweet chocolates were given as gifts. It is necessary to talk about mountain spring water packaged like milk cartons. You can open the seal and drink it directly. I don’t know how to store it if I can’t finish it. The first round of the mini version is free, but should this cup be cleaned? The sofa in the room feels too small for my skinny body to sit on. How can a fat person sit on it? Talking about breakfast, the environment layout is really average, and there are not many varieties. The open kitchen is not bad, but the chef's expression management still needs to be trained again. Breakfast is basically araca with some salad and bread. The highlight is The freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juices are incomparable to the breakfast at W on the Bund, although the room prices are also comparable. The swimming pool is not open, and the price and a**osphere of the bar are okay. The bartender is also very professional. In short, it is barely worthy of the price of a basic house of more than 2,000 yuan when it opened.

It seems that I didn’t see the star rating of the hotel, but judging from the price, the hotel should be positioned in line with top luxury hotels. Although the scale is small, the hotel We have put a lot of effort into the design, and the design is very novel. In a limited space, we cleverly designed several leisure public areas with high ceilings, which make the human body feel comfortable and not depressing. The basic room is not big, but the The imitation fireplace design is the biggest highlight. You can use the controller to control the raising and lowering of the TV, coffee table, and small table. The bedside table is equipped with an aromatherapy machine, a Bluetooth speaker (the sound quality is average), a wireless charger, a smeg kettle, and tea leaves. There is an hourglass⏳, the lighting mode is also very diverse, and the bathroom is also equipped with a smart mirror. Personally, I think this hotel is top-notch among city hotels.

Service: The hotel has just opened. Although there are still some details that need to be improved, the staff are generally very enthusiastic and basically respond to all requests.

Catering: The hotel has a French restaurant, a bar, and a rooftop bar (not open yet). The scale is not too large, and the restaurant has not many types of dishes (not sure if it will be increased in the future). The breakfast and afternoon tea are both good, personally think The little desserts are the best.

This is a hotel that I will recommend to my friends👌

First of all, the hotel: the front door is all season level, the room is not big, the design is indeed stylish, but it is not exquisite.
Then the important thing came. The air conditioner was not responding when I left it there. I contacted the guest room and reported back for the first time to adjust the central control, but it didn't work. After contacting me for the second time, I was given a hot air blower that was turned on next to me and was as loud as a vacuum cleaner. Then I contacted her again and replied, "I have no other option. How about I ask the front desk to come and experience it and see if you can communicate with her?" Very good.
Because I didn't pay attention to the breakfast included in the executive reservation, I went to the front desk and said, "then add it," and then the front desk said that the deposit is 1,000 and it will be deducted after eating. I didn't want to eat after a night of tossing, so I called the front desk and asked, and it was already deducted from the deposit. Deducted and cannot be refunded. Isn't it deducted after consumption?
Then I ate based on the principle of not wasting. The 200 breakfast buffet is gone, except for a few Western baked goods and pastries. Is there 20 dishes in total?
This is a 2000-level five-star hotel. It’s my first time to post a long review and give a bad review to a five-star hotel. Whoever stays here will be fooled. Thank you everyone!

msg:One star for the excellent public areas and rooms of the hotel, one star for the free social hour in the afternoon and the 8th floor lounge, and one star for the good mood of meeting a hijab guy attending a master class.
Rather than saying it is a trial operation, it is better to call it an opening that although the licenses, equipment and decoration are not complete yet, I want to make money, take business orders, do publicity and attract traffic, because no one pays attention to the feelings of customers and operational issues. From checking in on Sunday to checking out on Tuesday, the biggest feeling during this period is that the hotel is in full swing decorating, adjusting equipment, accepting business orders, doing publicity, etc. Guest experience is the least important thing in this so-called trial operation.

Restaurant on the 8th floor.
To be honest, change the kitchen back to the back kitchen, don't open it up, watch the chef fiddle with the dishes with his hands that are busy playing with mobile phones, put his hands wearing silver watches and bracelets into the pot to stir-fry, etc. It's not advanced. . No one in the kitchen wore a headscarf or a hat. Almost no one in the kitchen wears gloves before touching food. Other non-kitchen staff can also run into the kitchen at any time and sit next to the pot to chat with the chef who is cooking. This includes staff wearing blingbling eye makeup.
Breakfast is semi-buffet and has a la carte, which is very high-end hotel. But the homemade noodles take 30 minutes to make, which is not high-end.

Service and guidance.
From reservation to check-in, people will keep telling you that the infinity pool on the 9th floor is very nice and luxurious. Although you can’t go into the water yet, you must go and check it out, and so on to guide you. Then I was successfully guided. I went to the 9th floor before afternoon tea the next day, but was turned away and told that I couldn't visit during the filming, emmm.
Then we went to the 8th floor to prepare for the afternoon tea that we had reserved one day in advance. The scones are delicious, with just the right amount of moisture and flavor. Highly recommended. But the environment is really noisy. There were many staff adjusting equipment or chatting about work, etc., which made me feel that it was superfluous to make an appoin**ent for afternoon tea with me a day in advance.

Then there are many scattered little things, such as the room card is not sensitive and it is difficult to open the door, there are insects in the room, and the green card is set up but the aunt told me that it is only for changing the sheets, and so on.
If some of the discomfort in other high-end hotels in Shanghai is caused by the guests and the tight environment in Shanghai, then the discomfort here does come from the hotel. (The brackets do not include the lounge. The fun of the two nights was provided by the lounge. The lounge has five stars and everyone goes to drink.)
If you are a foreign friend or have been arranged here for a business trip or business trip, you are very lucky. But if the Chinese want to come and lie down, forget it.

msg:It's a newly opened hotel, the rooms are so bad, it's like living in an ancient tomb. The room was full of corners and was hit twice. The minibar cabinet had a lid that couldn't be fully opened, making it difficult to use. The electric curtains in newly opened hotels are bad. The color of the room makes it feel dirty, and the room is not big. It's really not worth the price. There is nothing to eat around the hotel, the hotel restaurant is very basic, and the breakfast is average, not as good as a four-star hotel in the city. This brand actually charges the price of a luxury brand hotel. I feel cheated.

msg:This new hotel just opened last Monday and many things are still being improved.
But the attitude of every service staff is very good💗
1.Room🛋️
The decoration of the room is something that I attach great importance to in every hotel I stay in. It feels like a foreign apar**ent building, fashionable and a little bit like home. Many things in the room are smart and not old-school. The bathrobes are also good-looking and there are direct showers in the toilet. The drinking water is very detailed. The bathtub is really big. The black bathtub is also beautiful. The hotel provided rose petals.
2.Restaurant🍽️
The hotel's own French restaurant is really nice when you wake up in the morning and go through the corridor with a garden setting to have breakfast. It's semi-self-service and can be ordered a la carte. The buffet includes bread, bagels, ham, cheese, fruit salad, and freshly made crepes. Bonus points. There is a freshly squeezed fruit area. The fruits are all fresh. You can choose what you want. You can mix and match your own rations. It gives me the most intuitive feeling. It’s not like eating a buffet in a hotel, like visiting a small market🛒
3.Hotel facilities⚒️
The view of the swimming pool is really beautiful. There is also a gym with a lot of space where you can check in and take photos. The layout is completely like an apar**ent building, giving it a homey feel. Next time you come with your friends, you can wear a small skirt to check in. There is also a bar in the hotel. I briefly walked around and it was very nice. There is an a**osphere and there are bicycles at the door. The location is also very quiet and not noisy. It feels like traveling around Shanghai on vacation but not far from the city. I will stay here next time.

msg:In fact, after seeing an interview with the Kimpton Hotel designer on Xiaohongshu, I suddenly became very interested in this newly opened hotel and felt that I must come and experience it.

The most amazing thing is the infinity pool on the top floor. Although swimming is not allowed for the time being due to the permit, just sitting there is breathtaking. In addition, the leisure area on the fifth floor of the public area is also very beautiful. It has a cool industrial style and a modern feel with retro elements. It is very suitable for sitting and reading a book.

The decoration in the room is also full of design, and many details are touching. For example, after checking in, a dedicated person came over to order aromatherapy, welcome fruits and cards were already prepared on the table, a large black square bathtub, a super-looking bathrobe, the use of high-tech products, the high-end texture of all decorations, and hardware facilities It's refreshing, I like it very much.

In addition, the service is impeccable. I feel it is the best team under Shanghai Intercontinental.

The fake leaves in the corridor of the restaurant are understandable, but the fake leaves used in the outdoor fan-shaped beach sunshades are a bit low. There is still a lot of room for improvement in the afternoon tea presentation. All in all, it is still highly recommended.

In general, the form is greater than the content. The hotel overall feels empty and cold. The rooms are more technological. There are almost no services and entertainment. It is not suitable for parents and children at all. In a city like Shanghai, there is only one outdoor swimming pool. There is a high probability that it will be. It can only be open for 4 months of the year. The rest of the time is useless and useless. I probably won't choose them again next time.

msg:For a room rate of two thousand a night, I can give you something worth only one thousand. First of all, the design is not my thing (of course this is a matter of opinion), the room is not big, and the things are very inconvenient to use. For example, on the first night we arrived, we arrived late, and because it was New Year's Eve, the takeaway shop was unable to take orders. There was no delivery, and there was nothing to eat in the hotel. What is worthy of praise is that the service staff on duty that night were very attentive. When they heard that we hadn't eaten yet, they immediately offered to get two cups of hot milk for the two children, which was very considerate. I wanted to take a bath before going to the room, but found that there were still hairs in the fish tank, which was a bit disgusting. The mattress was very soft, very soft and uncomfortable to sleep on. Went for breakfast the next day. There were very few varieties. The porridge was like Chaoshan casserole porridge. The Xiangqian beef porridge only had two pieces of Yuanqian and a few pieces of beef as big as nails. The waiter’s service awareness was very poor. On the first day of the new year, there was no smile at all. Didn't say a happy new year, asked her questions as if he owed her money, this is not what a five star hotel like this should offer. I probably won’t stay at this hotel again.

msg:We stayed at the Kimpton Hotel in Suzhou two days ago and it was very good and the price was very affordable. Then I found on Ctrip that there was also a new hotel opening in Shanghai, and I immediately made a reservation, thinking that I would take my parents to stay at a Kimpton hotel before the Chinese New Year. The hotel environment is great. I enjoyed the happy hour provided by the hotel on the day I checked in. The hotel services were also very good and basically responded to everything. What impressed my parents the most were the high-tech products in the room and the hotel's breakfast. Although the price is much more expensive than Suzhou, the overall feeling is still very good. We will consider bringing friends to stay together in April or May.

msg:The newly opened luxury hotel in the Qiantan area last year has a novel gray and black room design, a large square black bathtub, and very comfortable bedding and bathrobes. InterContinental members can also enjoy late check-out until 2 p.m.! The open kitchen of the French restaurant on the 8th floor is very beautiful. The dishes are a bit short and I hope they can add more. The service is very good! The outdoor infinity pool on the top floor is beautiful and has a view of the Huangpu River! Come and experience the swimming pool next time when the weather is warmer.

Generally, hotels will provide lounge drink coupons for guests to kill time at this time. There is no such thing here. I mean, I either have to sit in the lobby and wait, or I can do it myself. Go out for a walk. After checking in, the temperature in the room was 27 degrees. The air conditioner only had a heating setting. When the temperature was adjusted to 16 degrees, the air was still hot. Turning it off would make it cooler. Some of the technology in the room is indeed cool, but it doesn't really help improve the stay experience.

msg:The design of the public area of ​​the hotel is indeed eye-catching, but the overall experience does not continue this surprise, and even fails -

1. The mimibar, TV, and table in the room are all hidden and can be raised and used through the remote control device. Although it looks novel at first glance, it is not convenient to use in practice. It takes half a minute to raise the entire TV. Personally, I feel that it is a design that only focuses on beauty and not functionality.

2. There is a list of available items in the room. At first glance, I thought it was very considerate and thoughtful... but the funny thing is, I happened to forget to bring makeup remover that day. When I saw that makeup remover wipes were available on the list, I called the front desk to send some. . The front desk hesitated and asked to look for it. After 30 minutes, they called back and said that they did not prepare makeup remover wipes and could only provide cotton pads. ——I’m not asking you for makeup remover wipes, but if you don’t have anything we don’t have, please don’t write it on the list of available items, okay? ? ?

3. The most disappointing thing is that on the last day, I contacted the front desk and arranged to delay check-out until 2 o'clock. However, when I came back from the gym after 12 noon, the room card could not be swiped, but the front desk did not say anything about the need to re-make the room card. The explanation did not send anyone to bring us a room card, but just asked us to go to the front desk to solve it ourselves.

In general, it is a pseudo-high-end hotel (in the opening stage) that is beautiful on the outside but ruined on the inside. I can see all the elements of Internet celebrities in it - check-in points, sense of design, cool style... except that I can't see the calmness, meticulousness and home-like feeling of an old luxury hotel.

服務：很不錯，特別是門口的接待禮儀人員，讓晚歸的我們感受到了服務的温度

衞生：非常好

房間設計真的很酷，因為行程沒有訂帶早餐的房間，下次一定會試試！

整體設計都非常智能化，設施都很新，佈局比較合理，床品很舒適，睡得很好～
周邊感覺還在開發中，離前灘兩個商場步行可達，還是挺方便的
早餐是半自助的形式，單點的菜品量不大但都非常好吃，可以同時吃到好多款但又不會撐肚子～

msg:魔都，我努力記住你的樣子

我已經打卡了1281家酒店（其中：國外酒店40家；中國酒店1241家），對於常規的旅人而言，旅行的目的地是全新的、震撼的、無以倫比的山水與風土人情；而對於我這種重度“酒店控”而言，在路上的終極目的地就是酒店本身。對於剛剛試着廣泛出行的驢友而言，我這種態度簡直就是誇張偏激、大逆不道的；而當你深入浸淫在放射狀、多彩繽紛的酒店文化中，你才會覺得，上癮與痴迷是自然而然的事情。而這裏麪的絕佳代表，就是去年9月26日剛剛開業的上海金普頓前灘酒店（如果從奢華程度等綜合維度考量，在我心中，整個上海16個區的酒店裡，前灘金普頓大概能排到21名上下，我相信這是一箇中肯的評價）。每一個酒店品牌所裹挾的文化輸出、歷史底藴；它所想傳達的人文價值、服務理念等等，都是讓我欲罷不能的點。洲際集團除了IHG優悦會會員計劃以外，還有倆獨立的會員計劃：洲際大使計劃、金普頓Inner Circle計劃（即便被收購，也未把計劃合併），可見金普頓在集團中至高無上、獨一無二的特殊地位。當你抽着雪茄忙着摜蛋的時候、當你在高爾夫球場揮汗如雨的時候、當你用幾百萬的腕錶計算前程的時候，你有沒有想過，最質樸的奢華是找間酒店，自己温暖自己的內心呢？身體和靈魂，必須至少有一個，一直在路上（改編自智選假日某電視機開機畫面）……      

入住前，長春籍的金經理就幫我安排好了一切，事無鉅細，讓人覺得如沐春風。最近2023年旅遊GDP數據已出爐，東三省中排第一的不是有“爾濱”的龍江，而是吉林省。原因很多，一方面，吉林的好山好水太多了，譬如長白山；另一方面，吉林人的服務意識是超前的、超強的，比如前灘金普頓這位金鑫（Francis）先生——禮貌、紳士、談吐不凡。除此之外，酒店的值班經理、前台工作人員、客房、健身房值班員等等，服務上、細節上、態度上都是可圈可點的——我們深愛上海，不是因為這裏的高樓林立，而正是因為這裏的人，總是體察對方的人、總是給予對方無限温存的人、總是默默以對更彼此呵護的人，是他們讓魔都變得立體、豐滿且永遠充滿瑰偉魅惑。      

作為浦東新區的網紅新地標，前灘金普頓無論在設計上、硬件上、位置上、服務上甚或美學感受上都是出類拔萃的。剋制的雍容與有節奏感的華貴，這兩點完美復刻出了與《了不起的蓋茨比》（台灣省的翻譯叫作《大亨小傳》）類似的混沌中掙扎的張揚感。而以作家命名的套房則在魔都的視覺與意識高度的雜糅中暗示着張愛玲式的顛沛流離或者捉摸不定，那種流離的無法限定感，給增加了酒店的文化底藴和暢想深度。換句話説：奢華除了紙醉金迷以外，還可以很從容地穿上文藝的外衣——二者並不相悖。      

晨間喚醒服務是酒店的特色，大堂那些精緻的西點配上一杯暖心的咖啡，會讓一天的心情都舒展開來。我入住期間，正值聖誕（上海也迎來了五百年一遇的寒潮），大堂不規則幾何鏤空的金色聖誕樹和超大壁爐（客房也有）給人暖意融融的遐想和温情脈脈的關懷，難怪這裏成了全酒店的絕佳打卡地，或許，大夥兒拍攝的並不是一份精緻的裝幀，而是對辭舊迎新的一份囑託、希冀和紀念吧。      

酒店早餐採用了半點餐（半自助）形式，每一道全餐的出品都是中西合璧、擺盤精緻的，老實説，豢養自己暮鼓晨鐘時的好心情，並非易事，但前灘金普頓做到了。洲際系的歡樂時光在這裏被改為了“社交時光”，每一款雞尾酒的調配都是恰到好處，巨幕玻璃的繁華盛景來自中國改革開放的翹楚代表——魔都，建議大家黃昏落日時來小坐一番，那種心靈與靈魂的撞擊與回饋是無以復加、不遑多讓的。酒吧把畫廊的藝術氣質發揮到了極致，主理人來自旁邊的浦東香格里拉酒吧，是業內老油子了，非常健談，也懂得為金普頓的客羣帶來怎樣的意識形態才是安穩的——我們已經不約而同地期待酒吧户外區在春暖花開時賓客盈門、璀璨綻放了。      

健身房的設施齊全，更衣室的吹風機是戴森，但在客房被換為了“原裏”光學吹風機，科技感甚或科幻感十足。無邊泳池是酒店的另一亮點，我敢大膽暢想一下，春節過後，隨着氣温回升，洲際系的標誌性泳池大軍（廣州英迪格、前灘金普頓……）一定會人頭攢動的。      

工業風的冷峻體驗還可以在“請勿打擾”牌、走廊的摩天大樓抽象模型設計等細節中尋覓，周圍是密密匝匝的寫字樓，這種文藝風之外的798類型樣態，反而使酒店的點點滴滴都顯得那麼應景兒與合適，沒有任何矯揉造作之感——這是一座快節奏的城市，這是這座城市精神濃縮的精華——從酒店中體味到的真諦，或許就是這個。      

18號，廣州W暫停營業。可以説，2023年對於復甦中的中國酒店業是腥風血雨的一年，而在歲尾年初，又會有很多不確定因素等着中國旅業與酒店業。還好，在健康程度上而言，IHG是出類拔萃的。 作為最早進入中國市場的國際酒店管理集團之一，洲際酒店集團大中華區的第一家酒店，香港金域假日酒店於1975年開業，08年大中華區洲際系酒店突破100家，22年突破600家，24年突破700家！入華的12個品牌個個都能打（強大的品牌號召力），個個都有強大的中方業主背書（前灘金普頓所在片區的商業開發、酒店、寫字樓、住宅等等均屬於國企背景的陸家嘴集團），相信以後其它7個品牌也會陸續引入大中華區（現在，全球已經有6000多家洲際系酒店，大中華區已經突破700大關，在建酒店逾500家），祝福ing！      

酒店的紙質手提袋，質量排在第一梯隊的是金普頓；第二梯隊的是華邑、英迪格、逸衡、麗晶、皇冠假日、假日、智選；第三梯隊的是洲際。洲際袋子質量是真的需要改進了，一次在飛機上，我的衣服撒了一地；另一次，我的beats耳機丟了，原因都是因為袋子提着提着就無預警地破了——這一點，真該向金普頓學學，精緻、好看、時尚、耐用，同理，咖啡隨行紙杯也是如此，有設計感和質量好的還是金普頓和英迪格，不要小看這一點點細節哦，細節決定一切！    

  酒店為我安排的房型是典型的聯通房，適合闔家出行的家族旅客連着訂相鄰的兩間房。床頭的插線接口中，有專屬的type-c接口，細節再度拉滿，好感瞬間倍增。迷你吧的飲品和小食均以進口為主，透着高級質感；正方形的超大浴缸雖然比不上怡亨的泳池房，但大體量浴缸絕對是以後奢華酒店的新趨勢（尤其是日本人，它們對於浴缸是有執念的，看看《小偷家族》就能體會，再低階的生靈都有泡澡放鬆的權利）。和蘇州古運河英迪格套房一樣，電動馬桶、盥洗室全數字化（加熱、天氣預報、電視等）化粧鏡玻璃等都是標配，愜意無比。在尚不得知我兒子是否真的入住的前提下，為了以防萬一，還是為我兒子準備了豐富的聖誕禮物、歡迎禮品、新年賀禮、生日蛋糕（那幾天恰逢我大兒子13歲生日）、歡迎甜點（馬卡龍和鎮店巧克力）、歡迎水果等等，玲琅滿目、不一而足。在賞心悦目之外，也讓賓客充分感受到酒店的滿滿誠意，必須點贊！      

很多酒店的房卡是具有收藏價值的，比如天目山英迪格；也有一些酒店的房卡是多用途的，除了環保材質以外，還可以作杯墊長期使用，比如前灘金普頓，真是妙手慧心的設計啊！現在全球共有81家金普頓，最多的還是發軔之地美國，比如佛羅里達最南端的基韋斯特就有5家之多。國內的金普頓有三家：台北大安、蘇州竹輝、上海前灘，三家的酒吧、餐廳、設計（魔都有設計感的酒店太多，要非推舉倆榜樣的話，一個是上海中心J酒店，一個就是前灘金普頓）都是業界傳奇般的存在。     

迪士尼附近的酒店，由近及遠依次是（不算亞朵、麗怡、維也納、民宿、麗呈、橘子、水晶、歡閣，獨立單體酒店，衹統計20公里範圍內）：迪士尼樂園、玩具總動員、鄰家梅利亞、浦東川沙智選、萬怡、君瀾度假、浦東温德姆、川沙諾富特、客萊福諾富特、綠地鉑驪、國際旅遊度假區智選、蘇寧諾富特、康橋萬豪、唐鎮智選、浦東東郊逸扉。之所以要説這個，是因為我入住期間，正好趕上“瘋狂動物城”開園（12月20日），這也是上海迪士尼的主題樂園頭一回湊出八大金剛（今年元旦，米老鼠舊版版權到期，更增添了迪士尼的討論熱度）！前灘金普頓所處的三林鎮，雖然行政區劃上歸浦東新區，但地理位置上是無限接近於徐彙區的。如果你住慣了樂園旁的酒店，如果你要兼顧出差和帶娃旅遊，如果你要兼具市區逛逛加迪士尼，那麼前灘金普頓就正好處在了一個地理方位上的最佳平衡點，去哪兒都不近不遠，這樣的性價比才是無限凸顯的，千萬不要隨大流，千萬不要人云亦云，千萬不要千篇一律，旅行不就是總能有新鮮感和刺激感才更有難忘的誘因與談資嗎？您説呢？

想讓自己開心起來
上海2023應該最新的酒店就是kimpton和西岸的那個大獅子了吧！和edition一樣，應該整個風格是年輕人喜歡的！主打黑色系的智能風感覺超級新穎！checkin的時候難得可以早日住，我覺得很不錯！很flexible！大堂的沙發，毯子，火爐就給人一種非常紐約的感覺！
房間很特色，雖然我覺得空調還是有點不太熱的樣子，主打一個黑色，智能家居Q，電視機，酒櫃還有寫字枱都是隱藏式的，打開的一刻還是覺得非常有意思的，吧枱佩的茶小食也是不太一樣的，很不錯！整個房間的洗浴味道也是很不錯的！就是不是那種小的是整個罐子的。
然後燙衣服的，吹風機也是很適合我們年輕人的，黑色的馬桶和浴缸説實在的燈光有點暗有點看不清！哈哈哈
最有特色的是他的書房，太霸氣了，整個對這公園，然後下午還有kimptob特色的下午茶Q 雞尾酒都是現場調的很有意思，大的沙發，真的非常非常摩登！酒吧也是非常老錢風，非常適合閨蜜小聚，有一種紅磨坊Q的感覺，真的和其他酒店有點不一樣！
很不錯，關鍵酒和小食還蠻好吃的！
頂樓有開放式游泳池Q和健身房，真的可能真的感覺到了國外，設計非常一流，就是唯一不足的是早餐總感覺吃完我自己有點油膩味道，也可能剛開業還有些忙亂，希望可以改進！

房間整潔，設備可能有所不同，比如：音響和電水壺。火焰香薰機蠻有氛圍感，入住時不同精油的供客人選取是與其他有別的特色。燈光方面（包括仿真燭具）賦予了黑色系冷色石板的房間柔和的感覺。房卡、走廊、電梯數字等設計也很有意思。

健身房不是很大，但設備全面，泳池還是勝在風景。有電視可以看nba賽季。

餐飲方面，黃昏時候的小食和酒就讓人很開心。早餐品類繁多，口味也令人滿意。

酒店的服務還是很貼心的。每位遇到的服務人員都能及時並親切地處理好問題。

體驗很棒，早餐目前還是半自助，其實有時候種類並不需要很多，該有的都有，也有一些加分的，比如烤三文魚排好久沒在早上吃到了，自製酸奶很好吃，現做的三文治類也好吃，咖啡遜色一點。
服務很棒，住的套房，床品優秀，特別是乳膠枕，平時肩頸不太行，但這裏睡了很舒服。
minibar首輪免費，走的時候搜刮乾淨了✌️

前灘的金普頓終於開業了，第一時間來打卡，金普頓洲際旗下品牌，沒住過也是第一次來，酒店的風格低調奢華，暗黑系的色調真的非常酷，優雅而不張揚，低調的華麗感~
入住手續小姐姐非常温柔，整個入住手續很流暢。還有歡迎飲料，咖啡超級好喝。房間，科技感滿滿。old money的風格充滿了復古的貴氣和格調，最喜歡房間裏的壁爐，旁邊還配上了非常柔順的羊毛毯子，感覺超級温暖！浴缸也超級大，泡在真舒服呀。
酒店五樓的休閑大廳，僅針對住店客人開放。真的超級好看，三層樓的挑高真的絕了，工業風的啤酒桶還有非常出片的旋轉樓梯，妥妥的是下一個網紅打卡點!
8樓的法餐Chloe品質非常高，全開放式廚房， fine dinning的配置，早餐也非常棒，半自助的儀式感滿滿。
旁邊是摩登復古的酒吧，拍照超級贊，雞尾酒也很好喝。
頂樓的無邊泳池實在太好看了，整個黃浦江凈收眼底，和對岸的西岸隔江相望，最佳角度就是從9樓的露台往8樓拍，視角絕了!

msg:This check-in experience was very, very, very bad! Negative points for service. Take photos in the lobby and the electric stove. The hotel staff said that they would not move out of the way with flashlights or lights that were no bigger than a palm. They had such a bad attitude that they directly blocked our mobile phones to stop us. We didn't care and did as we were asked. After that, the man in white continued to stare at us, and finally even turned off the electric stove that we used as a background for taking pictures. After that, we went in and out, and we saw people in the lobby using spotlights to take photos, but the hotel staff did not stop them. Including pictures posted by netizens online, you can see many girls taking photos in the lobby with lights. When my friend came, he said that the hotel staff said, "You can't use lights, you can turn on the flash of your mobile phone." But it was different. The hotel manager euphemistically claims to treat all guests "equally", but we only experienced "differential trea**ent". Bad service, bad reviews, bad reviews, I have written an email to complain to the headquarters! Girls who are not here please be careful!
