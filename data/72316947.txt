msg:Excellent accommodation. Hotel room is spacious. 
It is Clean, cosy and convenient. Everyone serves there is very polite and nice. 
There are a variety of food in breakfast buffet. 
The park in hotel gives us a place for walking and enjoying the nature. It’s beautiful and peaceful. It gives me a nice place to get rid of hustle life.  I like the design of the hotel. It makes everyone feel peaceful and calm.
The location of the hotel is very good. It lies at the centre of MTR station, city walk and entrance of universal studios.  The hotel guests also share the same  VIP experience gates as another one. 
It is highly recommended to stay at this hotel when you visit Beijing.

Gorgeous and spacious rooms, lovely service, comfortable bed & pillows and delicious buffet with lots of options (vegetarian, Chinese & western). We liked that it was a 7-10 mins walk from Universal, so a little away from the crowds and the loud shows at night. My only “complaint” would be that the hotel layout is a little odd, you need to walk through the restaurant to go to the pool on the first floor.

Only constructive feedback is that if we book an executive room for 4 people then executive lounge access should be for all people staying in an executive level room, otherwise couldn’t fault the place at all!

We were pleasantly surprised at check-in by Wheeler, who let us know that we would be receiving a complementary room upgrade for our stay.  Next Damon escorted us to our lovely room and showed us around.  He also offered to connect with us on WeChat so that we could contact him at any time for assistance.  Every staff member we encountered in the hotel was very friendly and accommodating.  

We went to the spa and (in a lovely private suite) enjoyed very thorough foot massages.  My husband went back to the spa later for a full body massage and said it was really relaxing.  The atmosphere was very tranquil and luxurious.

We only ate breakfast in the hotel as we spent most of our time at Universal and CityWalk, but the restaurant where breakfast was served offered a nice variety of local and Western options.  I loved the egg station where your eggs are cooked to order.

Beautiful, elegant hotel, will definitely return if I have an opportunity!  Great place for Beijingers looking for a nice staycation.

Rooms are nice what youd expect for a Nuo but it's a bit sterile doesn't feel like a theme park resort hotel.  Drinks prices very reasonable

When arrived we got an upgrade the room was big but very simple with out much of a view. The front desk person said they would send a cake when we checked in but  that never happened. The check in at 4 seems late. We called room service just 
after checking in and they said it was shift change so we may have to wait for up to an hour. When the food came half of the order was wrong so they took half of the food back and brought the other half later. So we were not able to have dinner at the same time. I have stayed at the Lido NUO hotel, everything there Is always superb. This NUO location doesn’t compare. The staff are friendly and it is great spot if you are going to Universal.  But not up to the standards you would expect for the price.

This was the right choice. After traveling around the world for a day, I stayed at Nuo King for the second night. This was the right choice.
Universal Hotel will help transfer your luggage, so you don’t have to worry about luggage at all.
Entering the park in advance at the Universal Hotel is great, it’s very close to the park.
After a day of traveling around the world, it only takes 8 minutes to walk back to Nuojin at 8pm, which is acceptable. Nuojin is very big, the service is very good, and the stay is very comfortable. We did not have dinner in the park, we ordered and bought it at Nuojin There is a sofa and dining table for eating, which is so comfortable.
Nuo Jin can also swim, and the children are very happy
Thank you Chunrong, Nuojin’s guest room aunt, for being responsive to all requests.
The breakfast at NUO is great. I will definitely try it. The decoration and service of NUO breakfast are great. It is the best breakfast I have ever had.

The room environment is really good, 50 square meters of space with two 1.5-meter beds, suitable for two adults and two children, and a separate sofa area for children to eat snacks. The hotel provides free drinks, mineral water, capsule coffee and tea. The hotel's fast track is actually at the Universal Studios Hotel, which is about five minutes away from the outdoor walk.

Of course, Universal Studios Grand Hotel is also OK, but NUO's rooms are larger and better equipped, and the prices of the two are the same. Universal Hotel is suitable for those who like theme elements.
I called one day in advance to ask for some check-in details, so after we checked in, the room had prepared a baby bed for me, and they could also help us put two beds together in advance. The room is quite large, the partitions are very reasonable, and the hygiene is no problem. There is a minibar in the room, and drinking water will be prepared in sufficient quantities.
The hotel breakfast is average, the cost-effectiveness is not high, and there are not many varieties, but their noodles and rice noodles are particularly delicious, and the breakfast ceiling.
The hotel service is in place, the concierge will take the luggage and send it upstairs in time, and the hotel's doorman service is also very good. As an undergraduate major in hotel management, I think NUO has done a good job in all aspects. When I visit Universal for the second time, I will continue to choose to stay.

Very satisfied, the only shortcoming is that when I arrived on the first day, I was a little confused about how to go to the hotel's exclusive channel to enter the park. There were not many signs. After asking all the way, I finally learned that it was one floor down to enter the Universal Hotel. It is recommended to have more guide signs.

The first Universal Studios is basically finished from 9 to 14 o'clock, so the right to enter the park 1 hour in advance is useless. The subway is very convenient, so the cost-effectiveness is low. The reasons are as follows:
1. Check in at 16 o'clock and check out at 11 o'clock. This is also the case in the off-season. I can't understand it. This experience is just a pure sleeping feeling. If you want to sleep, you might as well find a hotel of the same price that is convenient for eating and playing. Don't be too good.
2. The building is not suitable for the elderly and minors to wander around. The elevators and floors are a bit complicated. You will get lost. The front desk on the first and third floors, this elevator and that elevator, this can be brushed and that can't be brushed.
3. There is no robot for delivering takeout, no smart toilet, and the parent-child hotel does not have a three-piece children's bath set. It takes at least 10 minutes to pick up takeout.
4. The attitude of the front desk answering the phone is poor, and there is no service awareness. A 12-year-old child and an elderly person got lost and found the wrong elevator. They couldn't swipe their card to enter their floor. They called for help. The person who answered the phone told the child to go to the front desk to find her to see if there was a problem with the card. This is your service attitude. I asked you to help find which elevator the child is in, and you asked the child to come find you.
5. There is a foul odor when you enter the shower room.
6. The minibar is Coke, Sprite, and Budweiser.

msg:A wonderful new large hotel in the Universal complex. Silence, park, birds, everything is wonderful, but only if you come to Universal for a couple of days. It is far from the city and there is no infrastructure nearby, except for parks. In the evening it seems boring and deserted. Incredible quality and variety of breakfasts, in the best traditions of Kempinski. In the evening, the lounge has excellent snacks that completely replace dinner. The work of the chef's team deserves endless compliments, although the lounge itself is somewhat lifeless (but the terrace is pleasant). The pool and all the amenities are very well thought out and of high quality. Feel free to choose it instead of the neighboring one, which looks more like a train station;)

If I didn't see someone swiping a card there, I wouldn't have found it at all. And the waiter who took the luggage didn't see it either, so I had to drag 2 suitcases and two bags to the room by myself. The service concept needs to be improved.

msg:I read some reviews on the platform before checking in, and I didn't have high expectations for the hotel itself. I came here to stay for early admission, but I didn't expect the hotel to be so good! The staff at the door ran over to open the door and take the luggage before the car stopped. Seeing that there were a lot of luggage, another staff member came! It can be seen that extra staff were assigned on May Day, and the guests were not neglected at all because of the busy festival. The room is super large and comfortable, not the large all-season hotel that the so-called reviews say. The furniture is very textured, and daily mini-bar drinks and exquisite tea are also provided. As long as there is eye contact, the staff will come forward to ask if there is anything they can help with. It's really hard work, thank you. This May Day, I tasted Michelin, and I checked all the popular projects in Universal Studios (it's very fragrant to enter the park early), and the hotel's breakfast is not bad. Looking forward to coming again next time.

At 5 a.m., my wife called to report the problem. After a while, the toilet was cleared, accompanied by another colleague. He left with peace of mind when he saw me in the room. At first, it didn't work very well, so we made do with it for a while. It was completely cleared while we were playing, and it was very convenient to use when we came back. The staff is so dedicated, and there is no complaint about the service in the early morning. This is my second time staying at NUO Hotel, and I hope there will be a third and fourth time...

msg:The NUO Resort Hotel is located on the south side of the entrance to Universal Studios. It takes 5 minutes to walk from the side door of the hotel to the park VIP entrance channel (located on the first floor of the park hotel) (a relatively quiet social road). The hotel as a whole adopts the so-called New Orientalism. The architectural style, as far as the eye can see, is filled with a large number of vertical lines of bright copper/red copper/light ***** structures, as well as a tough combination of dry-hanging stone and open hard floors. The entire hotel lobby is almost like a luxury sales office... ...But I have to say, she is really beautiful, and she looks like a blockbuster in any photo she takes.
Free upgrade to a garden view room with a higher floor, including independent toilet, shower, bathtub, storage room (but unfortunately no entrance), double basins, independent sofa set + coffee table + simple tea set (black tea is not bad), and dressing room There is a table and tea bar (with coffee machine), free drinks in the refrigerator (the first round is free), the space is quite spacious, and living activities are very comfortable.
The mattress is moderately soft and hard, and the quilt's cotton feels good to the touch. Looking at the carpets, curtains, pillows, towels, etc. in the guest room, all the cotton products seem to be of good quality; but on the other hand, the toothbrushes and toothpaste , tea-scented three-piece bath soap set, soap hand soap, etc. The hotel's daily chemical products are very watery... The bathing facilities are great, with plenty of hot water and high water pressure, and the cleaning is very clean; the air conditioner starts up effectively , is also very quiet; the guest room TV can watch recent Universal movies (the same as the film list of the Paradise Hotel), in ultra-high definition quality, but the number is quite small and some are in English...
During our stay, we spent most of our time in the park, so we didn’t have much understanding or experience of the facilities outside the hotel rooms. The hotel has a children’s playground and swimming pool, as well as a Universal Park souvenir shop. They were all in a hurry. Passing by and taking a glance through the window, everything seemed pretty good.
The hotel's breakfast buffet looks quite rich. Porridge/noodles/wontons + sausages/breads/vegetables are both Chinese and Western. The dishes are very exquisite, and you can also choose noodles for fried eggs... The only drawback is that I think there is only one coffee machine. Ah, you have to queue up to froth milk...
The hotel's most commendable external aspect is its service level. [Passion] is reflected in "helping others" anytime and anywhere, and "Professionalism" is reflected in daily QA ("answering questions"). In addition, the special needs of hotel guests will be met to a certain extent. For example, it happened to be our birthday on the day we checked in, and the room service also specially sent greeting cards (and some balloons...) and quite delicious chocolate cake; after learning that we Next we have to go to the Paradise Hotel next door, and they helped us transfer our luggage directly. We communicated by phone before arriving at the hotel, and we can mention our check-in requirements. A few days after leaving the hotel, the guest relations department will also pay a return visit to ask if there are any deficiencies (the hotel If the boss sees this, please add chicken drumsticks to Miss Guo)
In summary, if you are like us and enter the park in advance every day (you can get two free days if you stay for one night) and return only after the park closes, the Nuo Hotel is not far more convenient than the Paradise Hotel next door. The hotel next door is "next floor + 4 queuing lanes", and the NUO Hotel is "morning exercise + 1 queuing lane". Going back and forth to Universal Avenue after closing is relatively cumbersome. In terms of accommodation conditions and services, NUO Hotel seems to be better (just there are no dolls to interact with...). The accommodation environment is very good, the catering is excellent, the hotel's internal facilities are also very good, and even... There are garden views.

It was clean and comfortable, the space was large, and the a**osphere and service were really good. The waiters are very enthusiastic. The bed is really comfortable, neither too slump nor too hard nor too soft. When I took my parents on a trip, they reported that their backs didn’t hurt and it was very comfortable.
The food is also very good, and executive benefits include dinner. The food is exquisite and tastes good. There are Chinese and Western styles.
Mainly going to Universal Studios. If you enter the park an hour early, you can enjoy a lot. And the scenery along the way is very good, and it happens to be snowing, and the snow scenery is very beautiful!
It's also very close to the subway station. When you need something, call the front desk and the response is very fast! It feels like you can spend a day in the hotel, which is very suitable for vacation. It’s a very comfortable stay!

The quilt is too thick and the family of four didn’t cover themselves with quilts.

Hygiene: Good, no smell, the decoration is relatively new, and the aunt cleans it in a timely manner.
Environment: 5 minutes from the entrance. Although it is not as close as the other hotel, it is quiet and not a few steps away. Friends who are crazy about Lu must remember Lu Ha when they go upstairs for the first time! Because it is easy to turn around in this hotel, there is a movable "wall" between the lobby and the guest room passage. As a short-sighted person without glasses, I can't find my way back upstairs. Haha, fortunately, there are many servicemen in the corridor. , and also took the initiative to lead the way enthusiastically.
Service: The service staff everywhere are very enthusiastic and take the initiative to say hello. Any missing items in the guest room are quickly replenished. They are also proactive and enthusiastic when asking about travel guides.
Catering: The ingredients of the buffet hot pot are delicious, and the children like sweets; but the whole family likes another Cantonese restaurant; the wontons and pancakes for breakfast are delicious, and both hot and cold dishes are available.
Play: The swimming pool is clean and hygienic, there are few people, and the management is very standardized. The water temperature is higher than that of ordinary swimming pools, and it is child-friendly!

The hotel hardware and software are pretty good. The only thing I want to complain about is the "buffet breakfast". It's really good. Generally, there are very few choices. It doesn’t meet the breakfast standards of a five-star hotel. It’s actually not full and empty.

But the best thing is that the scenery is nice, it's quiet enough, and there are buckwheat pillows and cassia pillows. The minibar has beer, soda, and coffee.
The hotel service is good and very welcoming. You can leave a souvenir room card at the end.
The hotel buffet was quite good, but it was a pity that I had to rush to enter the park in the morning and didn't enjoy it fully.
Finally, there is the benefit of early admission. If you arrive 1 hour in advance, you can play all the Harry Potter and Minions parks. There is almost no need to wait. After playing, you can go to Jurassic to complete the items, which is faster than U.S. Express.

Later, the front and back service staff promised to give me a room with a better view as compensation.

The room has floor heating but it's not hot. It's very comfortable to sleep at night!
We stayed at the All Seasons Hotel near the Forbidden City on the second day. In comparison, it was so dry that it was difficult to fall asleep. I woke up several times and had to drink water!
The hotel staff, Ms. Wang, confirmed the itinerary in advance and arranged rooms and toiletries according to the number of guests. The service was very good throughout the process!
It’s really good to enter the park 1 hour early!

In addition to entering the park in advance, you can also avoid a lot of queuing time by taking the hotel entrance at other times, and you can make multiple trips.

The passage to enter the park an hour early in the morning is not far away. Just walk there for 5 minutes! Take another route to City Avenue, where you can see different scenery, and it’s not too far. Next time I go to Universal, I’ll stay at NUO!

msg:First, the hotel does not have a shuttle bus. The signs on the way to the park are not clear enough, so it is easy to go wrong at night.
Second, I will check in on Sunday, January 21, 2024, and check out on Tuesday, January 23, 2024. If I book an executive twin room for two nights separately, it will cost more than 5,000. But seeing that we could buy tickets together, we ordered two one-day park tickets for two large and two small ones, and the final payment was 8,700. The difference of more than 3,000 yuan, what does that mean? Did they charge me tickets for two days for two adults and two children? Ctrip customer service asked around and told me that I was right. The room fee was more than 4,000 on the first day and 3,700 on the second day. So why should I buy tickets from you? Or is there an additional charge for entering the park one hour in advance?
Third, hotel guests are charged for parking, with a cap of 180. How poor is this?
Fourth, there really isn’t much to eat for breakfast, and there may be fewer people actually checking in, especially on the executive floors. At the same time, the two families had breakfast on the executive floor. The wontons were delicious.
Fifth, as a southerner, I felt that the room was too hot and the quilt was too thick. I turned on the air conditioner to 19 degrees, but it never came down. When I finally checked out, it was still 23 degrees.
Sixth, I received a gift from Harry Potter and a snack when I checked in. Thank you to the hotel.

But there are a few questions that need to be raised: 1. The deposit is 1,500. I have checked out for half a day and it has not been credited to the account. There are fewer and fewer hotels that charge deposits, especially five-star hotels. Booking with Ctrip is just for convenience, but in the end, the deposit is still charged. Just accept the deposit. I hope the hotel can improve the timeliness of refunding the customer's deposit. Customers have the right to complain to Ctrip because it is not stated on our booking page that a deposit of 1,500 is required. 2. Such a large hotel is basically There are no medical measures for disinfection. Please prepare some iodine and disinfectant alcohol just in case. If your hand is scratched and you want to order iodine swabs for disinfection, the service desk said that there is no iodine swab and there are no alcohol swabs either. There is only Band-Aid and nothing else... I am speechless. The basic services are not even as good as those of chain hotels. . In summary, the basic service cannot be guaranteed, so I entered the park an hour early and smiled politely. I really feel sorry for the price of more than 2,000.

msg:The main reason for staying at Nuojin Resort Hotel is to get the privilege of entering the park one hour in advance. After experiencing it, it is really worth it! ! Everything needs to be done early. I went to Universal Studios Singapore in July this year and I was surprised to find that I bought an express pass for all the attractions and could play around with Universal Studios for half a day. After all, Singapore’s Universal Studios is so small. However, there are too many people buying U-Speed ​​Pass, and there are always queues! ! I learned my lesson and stayed at Beijing Huanying Hotel this time. I entered the park an hour early and went straight to the 5 most popular projects. Then I could leisurely arrange some simple projects later~~ I didn’t miss any of the floats, performances and photos. Don’t miss it. So worth it. Anyway, it doesn’t matter where you stay in Beijing. You can save money and time by staying with Nuojin than buying U-Speed ​​Express. I recommend it!

Of the two hotels in the resort, I chose Nuojin without any hesitation because of its large area! One room can accommodate four people, and the twin beds are 1.5m each. Compared with Huanying Hotel, staying in Nuo King is much more comfortable. Although it is a bit far away, it only takes 7.8 minutes to walk to City Avenue for dinner, and only 5 minutes to walk to the entrance of Huanying, which is very convenient.

The Nuo King Hotel is quite big. At least when walking to the room, you have to carefully note the route, otherwise you will be confused when you return to the room. Fortunately, after checking in at the hotel, a specialist took us to the room. This service was very necessary and considerate.

Hotel breakfast requires an additional charge for children, 138 yuan/child, which is a little expensive, but in order to enter the park early, hotel breakfast is the best choice.

The concierge also specially sent a birthday cake to our room. They carefully discovered my birthday without prompting me. I was very touched! The whole experience is once again a plus~

Service: The service is very good. The lady at the front desk is very gentle and meticulous, and she is patient with children. The concierge brother is very proactive in helping with luggage.
It is really convenient to enter the park. The distance is not much further than that of Universal Hotel, so it can be ignored. However, the hotel environment and rooms are better than Universal Hotel. I highly recommend Nuojin. The dry and wet separation and room facilities are really considerate. This is my second time to play. I’ll stay at Nuojin next time~

I had to store my luggage at the front desk on the third floor early in the morning and then rush to Universal Studios. Although the hotel studio can go back and forth on the way, it is not actually possible. Meaning, it is more appropriate to arrange a two-day stay in a hotel if you are traveling with an elderly person or a small child.

The executive lounge has happy hour and can handle dinner. The room is decorated for Chris**as, simple and elegant. Unfortunately, I was short of time this time and didn’t experience the swimming pool. I’ll wait until spring. By the way, Nuo King's turndown service is great. Many five-star hotels don't have this service anymore.

The breakfast was good, tasty, rich, and the bread was well toasted.
There are Chris**as decorations in the room, which is very interesting. The service response is very fast.
The evening snacks in the executive lounge are good. It's no problem if you have dinner here, especially in winter, it's very convenient with children.
The price is not much more expensive than the Universal Studios Hotel, and it only takes an extra 5 minutes to walk. It is indeed not as convenient, but the rooms are large and luxurious. All in all I am quite satisfied.
I always stay at NUO every time I come to Universal, and I will stay here again instead of Universal Studios Hotel, haha. My friend has been there and it feels like a fast hotel. So I don’t want to try it

If you have the opportunity to come to Universal Studios again in the future, you will choose Nuojin Hotel. There were really few people there on Wednesday, so there was almost no queue.

msg:Overall, I am very satisfied. I started my vacation in Beijing directly after having dinner with clients on Thursday. As soon as you enter the hotel, there will be a waiter to help you with your luggage and guide you to the front desk.

The front desk skillfully helped me check in and upgraded my room type for free. Informed about free drinks in the minibar and an hour in advance.
Then the waiter guided me to my room. On the way to the room, the service staff introduced me to some of Universal's projects, and finally asked me to search for Beijing Universal's mini program on WeChat. This mini program is very convenient and easy to use. On the way, I noticed that there is an isolation door from the lobby to the guest room area, and you must swipe your card to enter. Therefore, the guest room area is very quiet, with almost no sound of people moving around. The room I stayed in this time was on the second floor, and the front desk was on the third floor, so we went down one floor.

Entering the room, there is a cloakroom and a desk for luggage (the cloakroom is equipped with a safe). It is separated from the bedroom by a wall. When you enter the door and turn left, you will find a separate bathroom with a door, which is quite large. After exiting the bathroom, turn left to reach the bathroom. The bathroom contains a large shower, two mirrors, two sinks and a large bathtub. The curtains of the large bathtub open and you can see the Universal Hotel, which is the main entrance of the studio. It means that Nuojin is not far from the movie theater, and it only takes about five to ten minutes to walk there at night. The bathroom mirror faces the bedroom. Bathroom and bedroom, bathroom and dressing room can be separated by sliding wooden doors.
The body soap, shampoo, conditioner in the shower room, the small soap next to the sink, and the moisturizing lotion next to the bathtub are all Pu'er series of toiletries customized by Nuojin. The toothpaste is imported Colgate, along with a bottle of Listerine mouthwash and a bag of bath salts. Next to the sink is a concave mirror with a ring light for makeup. I didn't notice the brand of the hair dryer, but it was placed on the left side of the sink, together with the anti-slip mat. The bathtub drains water very quickly and the temperature is easily controlled. The shower room is large enough for a family to take a shower at the same time. Perhaps considering family travel, all disposable items are available in children's sizes.

There is a sofa in front of the bed in the bedroom. There is a tea set on the small table in front of the sofa, with four kinds of tea bags. The sofa and bed are facing the TV, which is large and clear. You can watch ten Universal movies for free, as well as regular channels or satellite channels. The office desk is large and equipped with a high-quality backing board. It’s also convenient to reply to a few urgent emails or handle urgent work during your vacation. On the other side of the TV is a minibar equipped with a capsule coffee machine, a hot water kettle and cups. The capsule coffee comes with two flavors, a total of six cups (the last time I stayed in a hotel with capsule coffee was the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong). There are two bottles of mineral water in the minibar refrigerator, one bottle each of Yanjing Beer and Tsingtao Beer, one can of Coca-Cola without sugar and one with sugar, one can of Sprite, and one can of sugar-free soda water. There are also four small bottles of mineral water and a large bottle of mineral water on the minibar, and two bottles of mineral water in the bathroom.

However, I think the biggest advantage of the hotel is to enter the park an hour in advance. With this extra hour, you can finish the two scenic spots first with almost no queues. Projects in other scenic spots can also be participated in when the queue is small. If everything goes well, you can enjoy all the fifteen amu*****t rides around the world in the morning. In the afternoon you can focus on watching shows, small projects or shopping.

Finally, check-out and luggage storage are very convenient, and you don’t even need to queue at the front desk to check out. The waiter will help process it after getting your room card. When storing my luggage, the service staff would ask for my room number and mobile phone number, but when I actually picked up my luggage, I only used the small card the waiter gave me.

The rooms are big, the facilities are new, and there is a bathtub for taking a bath. There is also a glass door to enter the guest room area, which can only be entered by swiping a card, which is quiet and safe. Not to mention the service. Ordering takeout is also convenient, just go to the takeout counter on the first floor and pick it up yourself. We were also upgraded to a room on a high floor. Choosing a room in the North Wing is closer and more convenient to the park. It is highly recommended if you go to Universal and plan to stay in a scenic spot.

The bathroom is big enough and has 2 shower heads and showerheads that can be turned on at the same time. It is very convenient to take children to take a bath. However, the floor is a bit slippery. The most important thing is that it is basic. I believe that the basin table is a bit high for children and cannot be reached by children under 7 years old. It should be equipped with a footrest.

Miss Vicky at the front desk is very professional. When leaving the hotel, the concierge comes over to ask if you want to check out without any pending charges. The room card is handed over before you arrive at the front desk. Just give it to them. When you leave the hotel and go to Universal Studios, there will be people who will take the initiative to guide you. There are not many people in the lounge for breakfast. The environment is very quiet. There are not many varieties, but they are all exquisite. The taste is good and the service is very good.

msg:At that time, I spent a long time choosing between Universal and NUO. Finally, I chose NUO because I liked the room decoration of NUO better. However, I regret it. I sincerely suggest that you choose Universal. The price is obviously the same, but the distance is really great. Quite a difference! Especially on this very cold day, it has been below zero for the past two days, and every day we walked along this section of the road, we were screaming! Although it looks very close on the map, in fact, from the hotel to Universal Avenue, it takes a long circle, almost 1km more, with twists and turns, and it is troublesome to go through security checks every time. If you just go to the amu*****t park, then walk about 500 meters from the back door of the hotel.

Let me talk about the advantages of the hotel first: the room is very large, very modern decoration, I like the style very much, the capsule machine, the refrigerator drinks are free (the front desk should inform the front desk about this, we only found out that it is free after asking the next day), the toiletries are complete, the bed The quality is also good. If you stay in a hotel, if you buy something in the park, you can have it delivered directly to the hotel so you don’t have to carry it yourself, which is great! The hotel is very big, like a maze. Fortunately, there are many service staff. You can ask questions along the way, otherwise you will really get lost. Oh, by the way, the hotel can order takeout. After two days of eating in the paradise, we often ordered takeout, which really felt very comfortable!

Let’s talk about the shortcomings: the TV in the room cannot project the screen, so I can only watch a few movies on it. The front desk service was relatively rigid. They called us the day before arrival to ask for our expected arrival time. I said it would be in the morning. However, when we arrived at the hotel at noon, we were told that the room was still being cleaned and we had to wait until 2 o'clock. So we went to City Avenue and stayed until we came back at 2 o'clock. But we were told that it was not ready yet and we had to wait, or we could get a room on the first floor. In the winter, I wanted the room to have enough sunlight, so I didn't want a room on the first floor, so we were told that we would have to wait 20 minutes. I was tired from meeting all morning and wanted to take a rest early, so I hoped to be able to upgrade to a room. The front desk said that the room types we could upgrade to were all fully booked. 🙂 Room...
There is also an electric car in the hotel that is only used for internal hotel transportation. It was snowing when we checked out, and we were dragging two large boxes. We asked if we could take us to the subway entrance, but we were also rejected. The reply said that it could only be used internally. .

In addition, Nuojin’s service is also great! ! ! We arrived early to refresh our projects, and the front desk also helped us go through the procedures and store our luggage. (But before check-in was in the afternoon, I was contacted and told that we might have children. Elica noticed it and helped us prepare bathrobes and slippers for the children in advance. Then the concierge staff were also very responsible, and they saw luggage and other things. They will come to help as soon as possible and take them to the guest room. There are two sides to the guest room, and you need to swipe your card to enter. The privacy of the guests is quite high.

Champagne was also provided for breakfast. After drinking two glasses, the girl at the table next to her was very excited and said that she was going to go around the world to do projects soon. It's really a pleasant stay experience!

The family room we booked can sleep two people in one bed and is not crowded. It is more than enough for a family with two children. It is slightly further away from Universal Hotel than Universal Hotel, but I read the guide at the time and said that Nuo King House is bigger, so when you walk 20,000 steps a day, you need to stay comfortably at night. The breakfast is also very rich, not crowded and orderly. You can go to Universal 1 hour earlier, or you can have unlimited round trips. I delayed check-out until 12 o'clock, entered the park at 8 o'clock in the morning, and came back at 11 o'clock to have a rest before checking out. The only drawback is that I didn’t have much time to enjoy the hotel, as I spent all of it traveling around the world.

msg:It is very convenient to stay at NUO Hotel at Universal Studios Beijing. The hotel is bright and spacious, and the rooms are large, clean and comfortable. It's just that there are no handrails in the shower room, which is inconvenient and safe. The clothes hooks are installed too high and are not convenient for a small girl. Some of the food in the breakfast is unreasonably placed, such as the salad and miscellaneous noodles area, and the placement of the dishes. It is a long *****, and the food placed at the back cannot be reached by customers even with their feet, so it is inconvenient to take. It is also recommended that the name tag of each food be placed in the front so that customers can see it before picking up their food.

It was more convenient to enter the park there, but there were too many people and it was very noisy. Nuojin was only five minutes away. I had a lot of fun this Halloween

msg:We came to Beijing for fun and went to Universal City. As soon as we got off the bus, the staff helped us with our luggage and took us to check in. The service attitude was very good throughout the process. We arrived after one o'clock and the room had not been arranged yet, so we went to the park to play in the evening. We came back to the park to rest and get the room card. There were also staff who helped take us to the room. The room was very big and it was no problem for four people. We are a family of three. The room facilities were very good. You can contact customer service to change the pillows. The room was nice to me. The only thing missing was hand sanitizer and body moisturizer. The hotel kettle couldn't be used. Maybe I didn't know how to use it. I brought my own. When we checked out the next day, the staff we met along the way greeted us politely! We chose to stay at the Universal Studios hotel the next day to experience the differences between the two hotels. The experience at NUO was quite good, the stay was comfortable, and the staff’s attitude was also very good.

msg:The privilege of entering the park one hour in advance is really worth it. If you go in on time, you can play at least three or four more activities, which is more cost-effective than just buying the Express Pass. Moreover, when you enter the park in advance, the crowds are not that big, so you can enjoy the park. It is really highly recommended to stay in the park hotel during peak season.
The rooms are relatively new and clean overall, and any staff I meet on the road are very helpful.
From the hotel to the cinema, you can take the VIP channel to enter the park. It is about 5 minutes away. It is very convenient to go back and forth.

Facilities: There is a mini bar, two bottles of wine, two cans of Coke and one can of soda water. Mineral water is also provided in sufficient quantities. Four bags of tea are provided for free. There is a tea kettle and coffee capsule machine in the room. The facilities are very new and very easy to use.

Service: The lobby staff will greet guests proactively and patiently. Check-in and check-out are very smooth. They will proactively ask guests what they need to do next and guide them to the correct place. Very good.

I left Universal Studios and returned to the hotel at 10.00pm. I was hungry and ordered food delivery. One pizza and one set meal. They were pretty good. The main reason was that the food delivery was very fast at such a late hour👍🏻
I will still choose to stay at Universal Studios next time!

msg:Since it is a high-end hotel, guests’ review requirements are naturally high. Let’s talk about the advantages. The employees take the initiative to say hello and have a strong sense of service. The rooms are clean and tidy. I can't think of anything else. The shortcomings are that 50 square meters is the building area at most, and the vertical shower for bathing is not very powerful. Although it was quiet, the sound of the door opening in the corridor could still be heard. The hotel doesn't have much of a view, so taking photos is definitely better at Universal Studios across the street. The last step was luggage storage. I took home the tea given by the hotel. Because the bag in Nuojin's bag was relatively large, when I picked up my luggage, the waiter checked it and said that the tea box could not be taken away. This seems to be one piece. If you can't take it away, you can write a note in the guest room. Everyone was getting ready to leave in the evening, so they pulled the tea leaves out of the box. Is this the structure and hospitality of Nuo King? Besides, the deposit had already been returned to my account at noon.

The bathroom is made of Duravit, and the phalaenopsis in the guest room and the sink outside are actually real, very thoughtful details~~ good reviews.
Entering the park an hour early was definitely worth it. In that hour we went straight to Harry Potter, the Forbidden Journey twice, and the Hippogriff three times. After finishing the Butterbeer, the park only opened at 9:30. I walked around the park to Kung Fu Panda. Everyone was outside. The venue was reserved directly. There were no people at the Transformers show. The queue time for Tinder was 5 minutes. I went in for the second time. I basically finished all the projects in the morning...
The original plan was to go back to the hotel and sleep until about three o'clock before entering the park, but I was a little tired so I didn't enter the park again. The family of three went to swim in the hotel swimming pool. The temperature was constant at 28 degrees and the air conditioner was turned on. There is also a lifeguard lady~~ The water is very clean, and there is a sauna next to the shower room, so the baby can take a steam for a while in case he catches cold. The staff was very considerate and helped me dry my swimsuit.
The hotel's facilities and experience are very good. Every waiter is very polite and provides good service. I had lunch at City Avenue on the first day. The Hong Kong style restaurant was terrible. The next day, I had lunch and dinner at the Hejia Restaurant in the hotel~~The Cantonese and Huaiyang dishes are very delicious.
Traveling during off-peak hours, 1.5-day ticket, and two nights in the hotel. The experience is super good. . . No one is crowded, and you can eat, drink and have fun in the hotel when you are tired. The environment is also good~

Speaking of NUO Hotel, when we checked out and stored our luggage, there were no smiling faces during the whole process, and there were no any notifications or prompts. We also needed ID cards to enter the park through the hotel entrance, so we were at the entrance of the Universal Hotel. Because I didn't bring my ID card, I had a big conflict with the staff who also couldn't speak human language.

If you stay at Nuo King, you can enter the park one hour early. In order to enjoy the park more, the hotel has prepared a rich breakfast buffet. You can go and play with a full stomach without any worries😄

The child was very happy and made an appoin**ent to stay at the hotel. Sister Yuanyuan is playing.
Universal Studios Beijing’s early admission bonus: enter one hour early, buy Forbidden Journey twice and Flight of the Hippogriff twice. Don't worry about these two items when the large army enters.
Free flow of minibar drinks: Mineral water can be refilled unlimitedly, but there will be a charge for refilling drinks.
The hotel environment is much better than that of the movie theater. There are many green plants around and the yard is large. But we live on the first floor and have less privacy. We caught up with the rain and thought it was better to be closer.
Entered the park on the first day to play, and wanted to sleep in on the second day, but was woken up by the noise of people outside after 7 o'clock... I don't know what to say about the poor sound insulation? still loud...
The lobby bar is still as good as ever. When the sun sets, there is ancient music playing, which is very suitable for the Chinese courtyard.
The service is still as good as ever, the hotel staff are very good, and Ctrip's customer service is also very good.

Hejia has a good environment, exquisite dishes, and high prices, about 500 per capita. If you don't want to eat in the hotel, you can eat on City Avenue.
3. Entertainment: The hotel has a swimming pool, spa, and gym, all together, very convenient. There is also a play area for children.
4. Guest room: The interior of the room is comfortable, with basic facilities, good sound insulation, and fast room service.
5. Transportation:
       From the small door on the first floor of the hotel, you can directly lead to the city avenue, and you can walk for 3 minutes. There is an exclusive security check channel. When you return, you can go back to the hotel through the security check gate on the same road.
       The gate on the first floor of the hotel can directly lead to the Universal Studios Park. There are staff and road signs to guide you. It takes 5 minutes to walk. You need to bring your ID card (to check the accommodation information) to enter the park through the exclusive channel.
        The hotel parking lot is outsourced and requires a fee of 180 a day. If you take the subway to the hotel, turn right when you get out of the station and follow the sign to walk for 3 minutes.

This experience is good, the child is very happy, and I look forward to coming back another day.

msg:The equipment in the room is broken a lot. Every time I stay in an executive room, the sliding door on the bathroom side is broken! 725.726 are all!
Are the toothbrush boxes broken after that?
Hey, the longer we live, the worse it gets.

When are you guys going to take a break?

Same goes for breakfast! The more I eat, the less variety I get. Maybe it’s because I choose the wrong time each time~
The service has always been very good.
The equipment is not updated and no one maintains it...
If this happens again, I won’t want to live there next time. It’s close to home anyway.

The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Comfortable, the toiletries smell good, the breakfast is quite rich, both Chinese and Western food are available, the dishes are rich and delicious, but I just don’t have enough stomach capacity. It’s only a block away from the entrance to the Universal Hotel, and it’s only a three- to five-minute walk away. It’s recommended to stay here

It’s really awesome to get to the park one hour in advance, and I personally think it’s more cost-effective than buying a Premium Pass. The hardware of NUO Hotel is very good, the decoration is very new, the service staff is very enthusiastic, and free drinks and capsule coffee are provided in the PS room. Overall very satisfied!

The 1.5-meter double bed ensures the quality of sleep. The room is very quiet at night. From the side of the hotel you can go to the city avenue for dining. The next morning, you can enter the park early from the VIP channel of the hotel, which is very suitable for vacation. Every staff member is very kind, greets you proactively, and smiles. The only regret is that it is difficult to pour out the hotel toiletries. If it can be improved It's perfect!

The last two are restaurant orders. They are really a bit too delicate. It is better to eat buffet

We entered the park one and a half hours earlier and went straight to the Harry Potter province. Three excellent speed passes, great.
The family room twin room is really great, the bed is so big that an adult and a child will not be crowded.
There are swipe card doors to enter the floor, very safe
The sanitation is very clean, and the children's slippers are very comfortable. If the children like it, they will take it away. The Pu'er tea-scented bath products are also very good.
The manager in the lobby carefully introduced us the experience of the park, and the concierge guided us to the room. The service is really good.
The time is too short this time, next time you do a second brush, you must stay for a few more days to experience other items in the store.

On the other hand, the reservation and the front desk did not have the authority to upgrade my room type. I booked the executive package of the official applet on the 23rd, and I added it myself on the night of the 22nd, and bought a deluxe room. I want to upgrade to executive so that I can not change the room the next day, but I can't actually call the front desk.

After walking for a few minutes, the corridor is quiet, there are few diners, and there are always vacant parking spaces in the parking lot. This time, we should park further in and walk closer to the hotel entrance. Nothing else to say, as good as ever. The water provided in summer is sufficient, the air-conditioning and hot water are also very sufficient, and the accommodation is very satisfactory. It was just this time that some people were lying sideways and vertically in the rest area near the lobby bar and the front desk. Although they didn't hinder their own affairs, they were not good to watch anyway. There are no Transformers toys in the small store, but there will be more toys in the future. There are many kinds of shops in the movie city hotel, and sometimes I just buy some casually, so I don’t need to go to the movie city hotel or even the city avenue. If you don't bring children, it's basically Nuo Jin's place, maybe come back in July.

In the hottest afternoon, I can go back to the hotel to escape the heat and swim. At 6 o'clock, I was admitted to the hospital to play again.. .Three-day cycle, forget all kinds of troubles.

The service is still very attentive. After all, the room rate in the peak season has already exceeded the price of a 6-star hotel. If the service does not keep up, it will naturally make many picky tourists complain. For example, my two orders cannot be upgraded and changed, so I provided a room change service. I went to the park early in the morning and put all my luggage in the room. Naturally, there was a waiter to perform the room change service. The room change was completed before 10 o'clock, and I was prompted to return. The hotel moved into a new room.

The room is very comfortable to use, and the temperature is adjusted very well. The whole family does not feel any discomfort when falling asleep, and the air conditioner is turned off at night, and the temperature is comfortable and comfortable.

The size of the room is very comfortable, twice the size of the Universal Hotel, and there will never be a feeling of depression; the double washbasin also makes it less crowded for the family. The design of the dry and wet partitions is reasonable, and the walk-in cloakroom is designed reasonably, as if it is your own home.

The only inconvenience is the walking guide. The route to Universal Studios from the South Wing rooms is not clear and inconvenient

msg:Staying at NUO is the right choice for coming to Beijing this time!
Location: If you want to go directly to the hotel at the "Universal Resort" at the terminal station of subway No. 1 or 7, you can go up the steps 50 meters to the right. When you see a security booth, you can go straight down to the hotel. This line is relatively close! You can also enter from Universal Studios Avenue on the left after exiting the subway, but it is far away. Go through the security check first, go up the escalator and cross Universal Avenue to reach the Universal Studios Hotel, go out from the first floor of it, and then walk for 5 minutes to reach NUO.
Environment: The hotel is relatively new, spacious and bright. The front desk is on the 3rd floor, and there is also a studio souvenir shop next to it, which is the same as the souvenirs in the park.
Service: The staff are good-looking, and the service is warm and friendly. Including the front hall, catering, security, doorman, and green plant maintenance staff, they answered my questions patiently.
Room: Book a deluxe twin room. 2×1.5m big bed plus sofa, can accommodate 4 people. Of course, our family of three slept more comfortably. The L-shaped sofa next to it is composed of two straight sofas, which can form a square or sleep people when put together. Oversized bathtub, double sinks, wet and dry separation. Slippers, toothbrush sets, and washing utensils are all high-end. Booked Fangsong mini bar, there are carbonated drinks, beer and iced mineral water in the refrigerator. Mineral water and Universal Logo.
Advantage: I entered the park one hour earlier. I walked out of the hotel at 6:50 and walked to the first floor of the Universal Studios Hotel. Arrive at 7 o'clock. Compared with Universal, NUO has fewer people entering the park in advance at this point, which means that it can pass through the security check faster and arrive at the gate of the park to wait for the ticket check. The security check started at 7:30, and I was lucky to be the first one. After the security check, I was still the first one at the door. I am so happy. I can play at least three major events 1 hour in advance. Of course, I also bought a full range of speed passes, which I played on this day. It's so cozy.

If you are tired from playing, you can take your children back to the hotel for a rest, and then go to the park to continue playing. It is not far from Universal Boulevard. We'll be there in a short walk. You can enter the park one hour in advance, very practical, the hotel room is very large, a family of three lives very comfortably! The capsule coffee machine is very practical, and you can drink delicious coffee every day! Drinks and water in the refrigerator are free, so you don't have to buy drinks yourself!

Drinks and beer from the small refrigerator are also available for free, as well as homemade coffee. Entering the park one hour in advance can complete the check-in of 2 items within 30 minutes at least, saving 500 U-Speed ​​pass, but if you enter the park at 8:30, you must queue up at 8:00, so you can put it in at 8:15 . Check in 3 popular items within 1 hour. The food in Universal Studios is really expensive. It is recommended to bring some in, and bring a cup to drink directly. In addition, Beijing is super hot, and there are many walks in line. It is recommended to wear comfortable shoes and bring a small fan. If possible, is a portable small bench better?

First of all, the price is 800 more expensive than last time, while Taobao is actually 200 cheaper. Besides the experience, I asked the front desk what activities there are for the second stay. The front desk said to upgrade the panda-themed room, but it turned out to be exactly the same as before. There was no upgrade at all. Only the room card was Kung Fu Panda. The most annoying thing was the swimming pool. I called on Saturday night to confirm that the swimming pool was open all year round. I brought all my swimsuits and caps. The waiter said that the swimming pool was not open for changing water and I couldn’t swim.

The sound in the corridor can be heard clearly, and the TV Couldn’t cast a screen and needs to be improved. The staff’s service is enthusiastic. The hotel’s internal guidelines are not clear enough.

On this trip, we brought our twin babies under 3 years old together. We slowed down and bought two-day tickets. You can enter the park one hour earlier for both days of staying in the hotel. The children need to take a nap. We specially helped them when we checked in at the front desk on the first day. We expedited the arrangement, entered the park in the morning to play, and arrived at the room at 2 pm.
The hotel is very big, but there is no chance of getting lost. Many staff will help guide the way. It only takes 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the park. It is very convenient to take a stroller with children.
The room is very spacious, equipped with a capsule coffee machine, tea bags, mini bar, 6 small bottles and a large bucket of mineral water.
There will be a commemorative room card when you check out, and the other one will be handed over to the staff. And it is very convenient to store luggage.
Next time I come to Universal, I will choose NUO again, it is worth the money.

msg:After comprehensive review and information before the trip, I finally chose to stay at NUO. The overall experience exceeded expectations. Thanks to the hotel staff for their attentive and enthusiastic service, leaving me and my daughter with a perfect travel experience.
The first thing that touched me was the beautiful woman Sophia who called me to confirm the itinerary the day before the check-in. She was very warm! I asked about some of my needs on the phone, and the arranged room was very quiet! On the day of check-in, he personally sent us to the room. ♥️
Exit the subway station and go up the bridge on the right hand side to the hotel. The environment of the park is quiet and elegant, designed in Chinese garden style, surrounded by gardens. Probably every room window has a garden view. There are polite greetings and enthusiastic guidance from the welcome brothers, so you don’t have to worry about getting lost, because you may really get lost, hahahaha😂. It takes about five or six minutes to go to the cinema, not as exaggerated as 10 minutes. Our room is in the north wing, and the window can see the movie theater. Room facilities and sanitation are worthy of praise. The only thing not ideal is that the toilet is not smart. The twin room we booked is spacious enough to accommodate four people in principle. The sound insulation of the hotel is really amazing! The level of cleanliness and tidiness is commendable in a five-star hotel, and no dead corners of hygiene have been found. . There are capsule coffee machines and Pu-erh tea sets in the room. Unfortunately, our schedule is full and we don’t have time to experience them. We will try them next time. The minibar and purified water are replenished in time. We booked tickets for 1.5 days, and we had a very good rest in NUO for two nights!
The breakfast is rich enough, go in for dinner at 6:30, there are minion donuts, and the service staff are enthusiastic and attentive. Category is enough for us.

Also worth recording is the dining experience at Xiyue Restaurant on the night of the check-in day (9th). The dishes recommended by the little girl Niki are very suitable for our taste, because she is listening to our thoughts attentively, moved! Before the meal, she recommended to us which items in the cinema not to be missed, the best location to watch the show, etc., which was very helpful for us to enter the park the next day, especially reminding us not to eat too much for breakfast😂. There is another drink recommended by a young lady. My daughter likes it very much. I'm sorry I didn't see her brand name clearly. She also enthusiastically recommended the Hammond restaurant in the park and the dishes we might like according to our preferences. We actually ordered the dishes she recommended at the Hammond restaurant the next day, which fully met expectations. I hope to convey to her Thanks: I wish her 8-year-old daughter a happy and healthy growth!
Please pass on my thanks to Sophia and Niki!
Next time I will choose NUO.

After all, a bottle of water in the park is 10 yuan, a can of Coke is 15... In addition, it is really comfortable to enter the park in advance, comparable to the five excellent speed passes, recommended.

It is very convenient to go to the park. When you leave the parking lot on the 1st floor and walk a few steps to the left (about 5 minutes in total), you will arrive at the entrance of the park. I went to play at 10 o'clock and there was no queue. I looked back and saw the crowds queuing up to enter the park. Fortunately!
Go to the city avenue and walk a little farther, and the girls' pace is about 8-10 minutes.
Check out quickly and take a room card to commemorate.
The service staff of the hotel are very kind and considerate. The CI speed is very high, which may have been developed. The concierge took the initiative to carry the luggage.

The room is designed to be separated from static and dynamic, so that resting and packing luggage do not interfere with each other, which is very good. It is worth mentioning that the shower head of the shower room is facing inward, and the cold water will not splash on the body when it is turned on. I like this small detail of the hotel.
You can enter the park one hour in advance. Compared with the Universal Hotel, you may have to walk a few minutes longer to enter the park, but there are fewer people queuing up. You will choose NUO for your next trip around the world.

msg:I have struggled for a long time whether to live in a hotel in Universal
Because I didn’t stay in a hotel when I went to Disneyland, and I didn’t buy a fast track. The first feeling is that there are too many people, and I will be exhausted when I go to work.
For friends who don't want to buy fast track, staying in a hotel is really one of the good choices.
The room rate is not cheap, but it is clean, tidy, and simple. It is too quiet to sleep, but there is no breakfast included. Breakfast is 210 per person, and the deposit is 1500. You can eat breakfast directly, and report the room number, which will be deducted directly from the deposit.
Be sure to get up early in the morning. Don’t just pick a spot because you can enter the park an hour earlier. There are too many people in the same place. I start scheduling at 7:30, and there is no one at all. Friends must listen to me early! ! !
In terms of transportation, I took a bus from Daxing Airport directly to Tongzhou, which took about an hour. I got off at the Garden Hotel in Tongzhou, then walked for 10 minutes to the subway, and went directly to the entrance of Universal, which is very convenient.

Hygiene: The room is bright and hygienic, with a lot of space, and the shower, bathtub, double basin and separate toilet are very good.
Unlimited drinks from the minibar: there are soft drinks and beer, as well as a coffee machine and tea leaves. There are six bottles of purified water and one large bottle of water. One bottle is 10 yuan in the park, and it feels like a profit in an instant.

Enter Universal Studios 1 hour in advance: The number of early admissions is based on the actual occupants. After posting their own itinerary on the xhs platform, someone wants to buy two early admissions. After searching, I found this scalper deal There are not many, which greatly reduces the experience of us real hotel customers. How many real guests are there in the queue early in the morning to enter the park, and the taboo tour that enters the park one hour in advance still has to wait for 30-40 minutes. The experience is extremely poor. It might as well be empty when the park is closed.

The hotel is still worth staying in, so it is recommended to stay directly until check-out, have a good lunch, and then enter the park to play slowly, and put the brush items after 6 o'clock.

The service level of the hotel is uneven. Personally, I think the service of the doorman at each door is very good. They are really considerate and consider guiding you. A tall and strong boy is super good-looking. I bring my baby alone and help me deliver my luggage. up
 But the attitude of the luggage check-in staff and the luggage collection is very strange and blunt and a little impatient, to be honest. My time at 12:00 noon was completely empty. The check-in waiters are also professional but have no warmth. It is a hotel built for a paradise, but there are no small gifts for children, and there are no pedals in the room, and they have not cared about the needs.
In short, he is not bad, yes, check his breath
The hotel check-in time is written at 4 p.m. and the check-out time is 11 p.m. When I went there, the room was not ready. When I entered the park at 2 o'clock, I could only wander to the avenue. When the hotel was late, I had to go early the next day. The hotel is really only for sleeping. My husband couldn’t get up, so I took my kids to eat. I asked if I could pack what I hadn’t finished, and I was blindsided. I just want to say that I have stayed in many hotels. If I knew that one of them would not come down, I offered to pack a lot. I feel that the layout is a bit small.
Came here for the morning Harry and Minion donuts. but none. . .

But it doesn't matter, the room is very big, the facilities are very complete, and the whole bath is made of Pu'er tea, which should be considered a feature. My favorite is the shower room. The operation method is simple and clear. You don’t need to twist and turn, just operate the buttons and control the temperature left and right, but I forgot to take pictures. There are also bathrobes and slippers for children. The slippers are thick and comfortable. The luggage storage for check-in and check-out is on the third floor. The design and layout of the number plate in the public area are very distinctive, and I like it. It's not too far to go to Universal Studios to line up the next day, and it will be very fast. The overall stay experience is great, recommended!

msg:The location is very close to Universal Studios, and it takes only five minutes to go down from the North Wing guest room to the queue for early admission. The staff is very friendly and professional, and check-in, storage, and check-out are very convenient. You can enjoy 1 hour early admission to the park during your stay, so multi-day tickets are very cost-effective. The room is of a five-star standard. Needless to say, it is clean and tidy, and the decoration design is also very elegant, making people feel relaxed and comfortable as soon as they enter the room. Although I have been playing in the movie theater and have not experienced more hotel services, the overall feeling is very good. After a day of playing, you can still get a good rest. The only minor inconvenience is that the takeaway items have to go down to the first floor to pick them up. It is understandable, but it is really a bit far to go around. So it is best to place an order at the same time, so that you can only run once. I need to be thankful for two points. One is that I was only given a set of tableware when I ordered takeaway. I was very enthusiastic about going to the restaurant on the first floor and gave them disposable tableware. Otherwise, it would be a bit troublesome. The other is that I forgot my coat when I checked out in the morning. The housekeeping depar**ent immediately called me to check after finding out, and put it together with the stored items so that I can pick it up later. Avoided missing items, thank you very much. Overall, it was a very happy experience, and I will stay here again next time.

In addition to the quiet environment and clean space as always, I feel that the quality of hotel services has improved a lot. The response is fast, the attitude is enthusiastic, and many needs are reasonably met! This point is really appreciated 👍
If there is a suggestion, it should be that the water temperature in the shower is a bit low, and can only be adjusted to 40 degrees. Hope to have more options for water temperature adjus**ent.
In addition, for hotel guests, there should be corresponding preferential policies in the parking lot.
At the same time, the sentry boxes leading to the city avenue are no longer equipped with card swipes, so that non-hotel guests can walk through at will, greatly reducing the degree of privacy and sense of security. Hope to pay attention!

msg:Advantages: 1. As the only two hotels in the park, needless to say, the geographical location is very convenient to go to the park, and you can even go to play for a while in the morning and then come back to lie down and rest for a while. 2. The room is 50 square meters and very spacious, the bedding is comfortable, the hair care is super easy to use, and the hair is smooth after washing, and there is also the fragrance of Pu'er tea. The necessities are well provided, and only 6 pairs of slippers are given. The beverages and capsule coffee in the minibar are free to drink. In fact, they are playing outside and don’t have much time to drink in the room. They basically don’t move. They also provide four tea bags of different flavors. I took them because the small boxes are so beautiful. Take it as a souvenir (laughs). 3. The sound insulation of the room is also very good, my neurasthenic husband sleeps like a dead pig. 4. The privilege of entering the park 1 hour in advance is really huge value. Personally, I think it is worth more than Yousutong. The hour in advance basically finished playing Harry Potter and Minion Paradise. When the big troops have not come in completely I also went to Jurassic to scan two popular projects, and there was no queue at all. I was too tired to go back at 10:30 and lay down for a while. The hotel also helped to delay check-out until 11:30, which was super user-friendly. 5. The hotel staff has a strong sense of service. No matter where you meet the staff in the hotel, they will take the initiative to ask you what help you need. They didn’t even open the door during your stay (the staff opened it for you) This is quite rare in the country.
Disadvantages: If you have to pick one disadvantage, it is that parking is not free, 180 yuan for 24 hours, and the excess is calculated as 12 yuan per hour. We paid 220 yuan for the parking fee alone, which is really expensive😭.

2. Xiaohongshushuo upgrades the square type, don’t even think about the free breakfast. If you have this idea, it’s better to book an expensive room type yourself.
3. It is very far away from the Universal Studios subway station in winter. It is very cold to walk there. It is recommended to go directly to Universal Studios. People are already frozen when they walk there.
4. My friend lives in Universal, and asked if he could help us send our luggage to Universal, but that’s not possible. There are various excuses that we don’t have a car. My friend said that he could send us to the park if he had a car, which is really too much
5. There is no way to enter the hotel without a room card. You need to be careful when storing your luggage. All the doors are locked for you. If you are not allowed to enter, you cannot take your luggage at all! !
It's very cold in winter, choose this hotel carefully

Walk for 5 minutes to the entrance of the park. The hotel is very user-friendly. Before the Spring Festival, there were so many people. Entering the park 1 hour earlier and then 20 minutes earlier, Harry Potter can easily swipe the second time.
Disadvantage: Because the child’s birthday is 2 days after check-in, I called before booking to confirm whether there is a birthday gift. The hotel phone replied that there is a birthday gift one week before and after the birthday. I specially refunded the NUO for 2 nights booked by Universal, but the result was before check-in. On 2 days, the hotel called to inform that there was never a birthday gift for non-check-in on the same day... Well, I am too lazy to talk, so I can only give up.
I stayed with my family and booked 2 rooms. Before booking and when I checked in, I had to confirm the anniversary benefits again and again. As a result, when I gave the room card, it was still reversed...very embarrassing
The hardware and overall are impeccable, and I hope the details can be improved.

If you trade Ruyuan in advance, you can go to play the roller coaster first, and jump over the Jurassic. After playing, you can queue for Jurassic Adventure.

Check out at 8:00 in the morning and go to Universal to play. I remembered that the cigarettes I just bought yesterday were on the plate above the bathroom rolls. I thought that other hotels would leave the leftovers behind. Nuo Jin didn’t say anything, so I can play until the afternoon with peace of mind. I went back to the hotel at 3 o'clock to pick up my luggage. I searched twice and said no. In a hotel that costs 2000 a night, I left behind a pack of 78 cigarettes. Do I need it? I kept looking for it on myself. I was sure it was in the bathroom and no one took it away. I just don't know where the cigarettes went. The management of the hotel is very chaotic and poor.

Early admission to the park on the second day has to be done on the same day, so I went downstairs at 7:30 to find the counter to handle it. The counter staff stood there and refused to do it. They said that they would go to work at 8:00 and the door would open at 8:10. He asked me to come back at 8:00. Take your child back to the hotel to go through the process, and then go to the park entrance to queue up! If we can do it, we can say that we are not at work, but we can’t do it. Then we arrived at the Universal Hotel at 7.40 and went to the counter. We immediately processed it without saying anything. The attitude of the NUO counter is not good. It doesn’t care about us. No matter what they say, they just say that they are not at work, they are not at work, they are waiting for eight o'clock! They can do it after seven o’clock, their system can do it, but NUO can’t. I have to wait for her to go to work at eight o’clock. I will definitely not live in NUO again.

It is okay to take children to stay for a day occasionally. The swimming pool is not big but there are not many people.

[Coffee] Breakfast: I didn't have breakfast at the hotel because I chose to enter the park one hour in advance. I checked the restaurant. There were few guests and the environment was very quiet!

😇 Service: It should be reminded that children need documents to check in. If not, they need to go to the nearest police station to issue a certificate [Candy]

🎯🎯tip: The hotel introduction said that Universal Studios has a shuttle bus, but there is actually no shuttle. It is very convenient to walk 200 meters from the north gate of the hotel. Besides, let’s enter the park in advance. You can only play in the Harry Potter project for one hour, and other projects are blocked by the fence~ We ate at the restaurant we chose on City Avenue, mainly because we didn’t want to eat hamburgers and fries three times a day. It’s very convenient to go back after eating~

Later, when I went back and forth, a child's mother told me that the child liked different things and took them to eat, in fact, the taste was the same. Relying on the memory of the self-driving trip in the United States many years ago, I compared the local donuts that LA Universal had for breakfast that day, and felt that the ones here were well improved--slightly less oily and slightly less sweet.
"Chocolate Cookies"
Sweet but not greasy, I chose the smallest piece
"Chocolate Bread Pudding"
good to eat! The flowing chocolate on the surface is very healing. After eating the above, I feel that there is really no need to go to Cool Qiao today!
"Cheese Block"
Three or four kinds of heavier ones and two kinds of ordinary ones are all delicious. They are carefully matched with strawberries, grapes, and nuts, which are pleasing to the eye.
Artichokes, salmon, air-dried ham, couscous, guniao, stuffed mini bell peppers, blueberry yogurt, freshly squeezed watermelon juice in glass bottles, in short, there are good things to eat here. The couscous is so authentic and unforgettable.
A brief mention of Chinese food: there is nothing special and no thunder, and the variety is ok. With hot chicken soup, carts came to each table one by one and asked if they wanted it.

Would love to come again!

Talk about accommodation: there were not too many people that day, so the stay was extended to 14:00. The staff are friendly and enthusiastic to solve problems. Parking is still 180¥ for 24h. It's okay to have psychological expectations. The tea is really good quality! Coffee capsules and mini bar as previously commented. The courtyard is well-greened, and one side is adjacent to the river. Take the exclusive channel to enter the special VIP feeling of Universal Boulevard (without purchasing amu*****t park tickets).

Gym and swimming pool across the window. The equipment is carefully adjusted for different body shapes, and the color warning light at the end of the treadmill reminds you. Personal evaluation is a very advanced feature.

msg:The second time I came to the Global Nuojin Resort Hotel, I stayed in the ordinary double bed last time, and this time I stayed in the executive double bed. The room is exactly the same, just more executive courtesy. Enter the park one hour in advance (there are a lot of people entering the park on 8.1, only Harry Potter is open), separate check-in, free drinks in the minibar, breakfast, and a simple buffet in the happy hour evening, the variety is okay, you can eat enough. A maximum of 4 people can stay, including executive courtesy for 2 people only. Exceeding the number of people requires a single payment, happy hour 288rmb. Breakfast is around 210, I didn't remember it.
When I checked in, I wanted to go to the 7th floor for check-in, but there were not many people in the lobby on the 3rd floor. There was a lady in the lobby who said it could be done and said that it had been cleaned. It was done on the 3rd floor. Said that the room was not cleaned. You have to wait until 3:30 to get your room card. We planned to go to the executive lounge on the 7th floor for drinks. After arriving at the administrative check-in place on the 7th floor, it said that there was a room, which was very contradictory.
The service staff of the executive lounge are very warm and professional, and they are all in good shape. The executive lounge can see the inside of the park.
p4-p8 are happy hour light meal buffets. p11-p15 is the breakfast on the executive floor (for fear of more people and more children on the first floor).

Service: The staff will take the initiative to say hello when they see it. They even put a few more bottles when they were afraid that the water would not be enough to clean up the room the next day.
All-you-can-drink from the minibar: There are eight or nine bottles in the small refrigerator, which can be refilled for free. There is also a coffee machine and tea set in the room
✅The room is very big and the bathroom is separated
Environment: The hotel has a yard with shady trees, so you can go for a walk if you get up early in the morning. There is a direct road to the city boulevard
Breakfast: rich variety, a combination of Chinese and Western, as well as doughnuts of minions and hp, very worthwhile

msg:For those who go to Universal Studios, it is a wise choice to check in at the NUO Hotel one day in advance, and you can enjoy the privilege of entering the park an hour earlier. It is necessary to enter the park in advance. Before a large number of tourists flood into the park, you can take pictures in the Harry Potter Park.
       The environment and service of the hotel are also very commendable. There are a lot of hotel staff, and you can see one at almost every corner. Before you can ask, they have already greeted you kindly and asked if you need their help. There are also toothbrushes, slippers and bathrobes for children to use in the room.
        The traffic is very convenient. We came here by subway. After exiting the subway, turn left and cross a small bridge to the hotel. If you come by car, the hotel also has a large parking lot.
       Regarding breakfast, there is a rich variety, both Chinese and Western, but the price is a bit high, but it is still cheaper than the Universal Hotel next door, and the food and beverage prices in the entire resort area are high.

msg:This time around the world, I still choose to stay in Nuojin. The low-key and elegant temperament of the hotel is too popular. It is difficult to book a room during the summer vacation, so I booked two weeks in advance and got a double bed room without breakfast, 1619 for one night after the discount. Compared with the last garden room, it is tens of yuan cheaper. The room facilities are the same, but the floors can only be selected on the first and second floors. The lobby is on the third floor, and I feel that the safety factor on the first floor is weaker. Check-in at 16:00, if there is a clean room, you can check in early, and check-out at 11:00 can be extended to 12:00. The swimming pool of the hotel is very small, and the service staff is responsive. It is very delicious to enter the park an hour early, and the minibar is very delicious. After staying this many times, I finally have a Harry Potter-themed room card. I am very happy.
Say what you want to improve. 1. Afternoon tea in the lobby bar, the Minions and 9 3/4 cakes are gone. It’s not that the current afternoon tea is not delicious, but I feel that since the hotel is opened in Universal Studios, it is not more common to make some universal-themed desserts. Is it easier to get customers in the shape? 2. The trash can in the bathroom of the room is a foot-opening type. It is embarrassing to throw paper every time after going to the toilet. I hope the hotel management will test it and replace it with an intelligent sensor to open the lid.
But the flaws do not hide the truth, playing Universal and living in Nuojin, the overall is still very good

msg:After repeatedly comparing the Universal Hotel and NUO, I finally chose NUO, and I am still happy for my choice. Why do I need the "Super 8" next door when I can live in a luxury hotel at the same price?
      Before booking, I called and confirmed that on the day of check-in, you can enjoy entering the park 1 hour in advance, but you just have to come to the front desk to go through the relevant procedures. We arrived at the front desk before 7 o'clock that day. There was no one, and the ladies at the front desk were very nice. . Leave your luggage to the luggage store and you can go to the queue.
Service: As I said before, the front desk is very nice, the little brother saw us with two children and sent the luggage to the door of the room. There are waiters in every corner to guide, and the cleaning aunt will greet the guests when they see them.
Environment: The environment is good, the new Chinese-style decoration style is very attractive, and it has the feeling of a garden hotel. There is a large lake outside the hotel, which can be seen from individual rooms. The room space is large and suitable for families. It is much better than the Universal Hotel. The guest room area is separated from the public area by access control, and it is safe to swipe in and out. The only downside is the unreasonable setting of the shower room. There are no racks or poles to hang clothes/bath towels inside or outside the door. The hotel has complete facilities, including a heated swimming pool, spa, restaurant, and gym equipment, but it provides bottled water and clean towels for free.
Hygiene: There is no hygienic condition, no hygienic dead corners, and the bedding is clean and comfortable.
Transportation: The transportation is all in the resort area, and the hotel can be reached by taking the overpass from the subway. It is said on the Internet that Nuojin Jinyuan is farther than the Universal Hotel. But I honestly say that this distance is nothing at all. We probably only walked for less than ten minutes. Go to the first floor of the Universal Hotel and wait in line. There are guides in every corner of NUO to show you the way. door.
Conclusion: I will stay at NUO next time I come to Universal.

It can be said that the minibar is very suitable! It's very convenient to walk from the hotel, and the room service is also very timely. It's really a good stay experience! The only downside is that the parking lot 🅿️ is too inconvenient to walk to the hotel to be exposed to the sun! It is very convenient to have a nucleic acid station in the subway station, and the lake view from the town is also very beautiful, a pleasant three-day experience!
Entering Universal Studios 1 hour in advance: You can enter the park basically at 8:30. You must bring your room card and enter the ID cards of all entrants when you check in!

The room is quiet, the bathroom is separated without disturbing each other, the design is reasonable, especially the double washbasin is very suitable for couples or a family. The minibar in the room is also free, and the mineral water provided is also very sufficient. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, but the service is very friendly.

You can enter the park one hour earlier when you check in at the hotel, which is a very worthwhile value-added service, which can save a lot of queuing time. It takes about five or six minutes to walk from the hotel to the entrance of the park. The price is a little more expensive than the Universal Studios Hotel, but the comfort is much higher. If you like cleanliness and focus on comfort and enjoyment, Nuojin is more suitable for you, it is the best choice to come to the studio

If you don't deliberately ask for the feeling of the theme room, and hope to rest more comfortably, you must choose Nuojin. The overall layout of the room is bright, the items are set humanized, and all the service staff are polite and modest. We arrived around 1:00 pm, if there is room, we can check in early. If you don't want to eat the hotel's breakfast, you can order takeout, which will be delivered to the service counter in the lobby on the first floor, so it is very convenient to pick it up yourself. If you enter the park 1 hour early in the morning, you can go to the Harry Potter area to take pictures or brush the taboo tour in advance, such as the flight of the hippo, etc. There are few people who do not need to use the Express Pass. If you are tired from shopping at noon, go back to the hotel to rest and come back in the afternoon and evening. If there is no light show, the park closes at 7:00. There are not many choices for meals on City Avenue, and the price is not very cheap, but you can buy a wand in advance on City Avenue, because it takes time to queue up to buy a magic wand in the Harry Potter area after entering the park. Next time I go to Universal Studios, I will choose Nuojin, looking forward to it! ! !

msg:I stayed at the Universal Studios Hotel before, and this time I came to Nuojin. When I came, the taxi driver said that Nuojin is 5 stars, and Universal is 4 stars. I think this time should be a good experience.
What happened after arriving at the hotel on the first day really made me advance my knowledge of this hotel.
1. No one will help you with your luggage after getting off the bus🧳
2. The hotel is divided into north and south wings. If you want to go out after checking in, there are no road signs to tell you how to go. When I finally came back from Universal Avenue, I politely asked the security guard at the door how to get back to the room, and the attitude I got made my jaw drop. I really don't understand why a guest doesn't get a polite reply when he asks for directions politely. The security guard said "nei side chant" rudely and impatiently, but he was referring to a wall. "If I knew the way, would I still need to ask you? Why are you so unfriendly, I have never seen a service staff like you," I said seriously. This sentence aroused the other party's desire to be provocative again. He didn't want to check our itinerary code and nucleic acid, but because he heard my words, he pressed to check one by one. No problem, my sister will find it difficult to cooperate with you, after all, this is the duty of a citizen. But sister can't be accustomed to you. Such a person must get a complaint. Although I took a beautiful photo of him, I will protect the privacy of his portrait, but he really smeared Nuo Jin too much.
On the second day, I felt that the other staff in the hotel were very friendly. The buffet was very good. There were 4 clear areas to pick up meals, divided into Chinese breakfast area, Western pastry area, cold food area, and egg sausage area. The dining environment and ingredients are very good. it is good. The other security staff I encountered were also very friendly. So if you want to stay, you can come and try it. I hope everyone will not encounter this experience again.
If you bring children, it is recommended to take a taxi or a special car directly from Daxing Airport and Capital Airport. It is very convenient to arrive in 30-50 minutes, and the Capital Airport is closer here.
Nuojin is still a little far from the Universal Studios park, about 5-7 minutes on foot. You have to cross the road and walk to the first floor of the Universal Studios Hotel to enter the park. There is a policy of entering the park one hour in advance.
Room hardware facilities are better, Chinese architectural style. There are also children's pajamas, and the toiletries are the same as those of the Universal Studios Hotel. The design is relatively rough, like a textured express hotel.

From check in, the service attitude of the staff is very good, including the staff who help with luggage are excellent. After registering at the counter, the staff will follow you to the luggage storage and elevator entrance, so that guests can leave the counter without any questions in peace of mind. The drinks and supplies in the room are well prepared, the decoration and supplies are exquisite, and the choice of tea and coffee flavors is very suitable for my personal preference. As soon as you go downstairs to checkout and get out of the guest room elevator, someone asks and helps with luggage, and the checkout is completed in 1 minute.
The only thing that needs improvement is that there is a short drive from the hotel to Universal Studios, it may be more convenient if there is a shuttle (similar to a golf course battery car). In addition, there is only a box of tissues in the room, which is a little inconvenient. But these little issues don't affect the overall quality of accommodation.

The reply from the staff said: I changed the supplier two weeks ago, and it will be the same after that. This is not a mistake placed by the staff. Hehe, of course I don't think it's the staff's mistake, and the staff can't walk 400 meters with toiletries to another hotel to place them haha!
Just ask the relevant hotel staff if they can take a little care, and can't just think about "recovery" and quickly "cut the leeks"! Regardless of the contents, at least the logo on the packaging matches the hotel where you are staying!
Maybe they think that there will always be people living there anyway, and most people probably only live once, so these problems are not "problems"...
All kinds of pastries for breakfast taste very good, sweet but not greasy, and chocolate is also mellow. But the little guy at the Chinese-style noodle and wonton stall can't keep up with the rhythm...
Hey, if it wasn't for the epidemic, we couldn't go out to Beijing, why would we live here three times a year? ! To witness a "miracle"? !

To be slightly better, I know that the bed in the room is very large, two double beds of 1.5 meters. If they are put together, it is enough for four people to live in. Secondly, the hotel environment is relatively quiet, and there are more food choices. The dishes in Hejia Chinese Restaurant are very good.

Both of them combine traditional culture with modern civilization, and the style is elegant and refined. . As a hotel near Universal Studios, Tongzhou NUO is obviously better in terms of location. It takes more than ten minutes to walk from the hotel to the studio. Although it is a little farther than the Minion Hotel, NUO's room design is more comfortable and elegant. Spacious, but the design of the Minions Hotel theme room is too restless (I dare to ask the designer, is it really so difficult to combine childlikeness and elegance?)
[Breakfast] Tongzhou Nuojin's breakfast is still very good. Various islands present Chinese and Western cuisines with rich varieties. My daughter loves to eat pastries, sweet but not greasy, as shown in the picture above. Maybe because of the epidemic, the NUO Hotel on Jiangtai Road does not have as many customers as this NUO Hotel, the breakfast is simple, and the price/performance ratio is not high. Minions' breakfast is not clear, no evaluation.
[Service] During the period, I made several room service calls, and the problem was solved with satisfaction. By the way, I ordered a meal in the hotel room this time, and the experience of the dishes and service was great (see the picture). The young man also thoughtfully left the dining car for us to eat, but unfortunately I forgot the job number. If the hotel leaders can If you see it, you can check the waiter who delivered meals to Room 315 at around 5:00 pm on July 2nd, especially praise and like.
[Transportation] When you go there, take Subway Line 7 directly. Exit the station is the security check of the park. After passing the security check, turn right and walk back along the river. After ten minutes of walking, you will arrive at the hotel (it is best to ask when you pass the security check). It seems that it is easier to get a taxi at the Nuojin Hotel. It was very tired and rainy when I returned home, so I didn't take the subway, but booked a first car. Jin is convenient to call a car.
[Sanitation] For breakfast utensils, I don't know why the chopsticks are exposed on the outside of the tablecloth (with pictures)? It is easy to come into contact with hands during extraction and use, which is very unsanitary. This has been reported to the waiter, and I hope to pay attention to this. There is also a suggestion for the hotel's epidemic prevention work, because the quality of the spare N95 mask I brought with me has problems, and I want to buy it at the hotel. I asked the front desk and went to the concierge, but I didn't expect it! There are only disposable medical masks, and there is no supermarket pharmacy next to the hotel. Thinking of queuing up for meals in a crowded place the next day, it feels very dangerous. Fortunately, the hotel service desk sent a sewing kit, so I could only sew the degummed mask by myself.
[Cineplex] Today is the second brush studio. The child insists not to buy a speed pass card, and plays a more Buddhist style. He has just finished the high school entrance examination and rushed before the summer vacation. There are really few people, and the average queue for major projects is half an hour. However, the madness of shopping has continued unabated. All kinds of magic candy, magic books, Toothless (Yesha) and the couple of Guangsha... I went to the warehouse and I obviously ran out of food, so I went home to save money,

The greetings and stickers given by a group of beautiful sisters and aunts with smiles in the lobby have already made my son, this little straight man, fall in love with this place. After the room is checked in, whether it is the air conditioner or the shower toilet, you can score full marks. The details of bedding and towels are also very good. The breakfast is really worth a visit (it is recommended to go early). The quality of the dishes is online and rich, close to the level of InterContinental dining in memory, which is very unexpected and satisfying. If it is the first time to play and the economic conditions permit, it is recommended to book a 2-night stay. Arrive before 15:00 on the first day and play for half a day (0.5 days). Don’t buy an express pass, stare at a park area to play + watch 1-2 theaters , After breakfast the next day, enter the park early to play for a whole day (1 day), you can play all the way to the end of the float parade, and there is a passage from the Universal Studios Hotel to return directly to Nuojin (no need to go through the park exit), and then install Go back to the hotel with peace of mind to rest and sleep (the second night of accommodation). In the morning of the third day, you may consider playing in the swimming pool after the meal. This time I didn’t see the swimming pool, but based on the experience of the hotel facilities, I believe it will not make people feel disappoin**ent.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first!
🍃Environment: The hotel room is big enough and clean, and it is quieter than the Universal Studios hotel.
🔔Service: Although there are very few people in the off-season, the breakfast is still very rich; I told the waiter that there is not enough water, and the waiter immediately sent several large bottles; the waiter who saw it would take the initiative to greet.
🚗 Transportation: If you enter the Universal Resort and say that you are going to the hotel, just let it go and drive directly to the parking lot outside the hotel, 180 yuan/24 hours, and 12 yuan/hour if it exceeds.

After talking about the advantages, let’s talk about the disadvantages!
The location of the hotel is not very clear. It is said that it should be regarded as a resort hotel in the Universal Resort, but I don’t know if it is because of the low number of people in the off-season. The entire hotel, especially when we checked in in the afternoon, the entire lobby was deserted and there was no holiday a**osphere. Give it to me, the children and the elderly sat in the lobby bar for a long time and no one gave a bottle of water, so I would like to greet them.
There are many loopholes in the parking lot. If you say that you can let go if you live in a hotel, then tourists who don't live in a hotel can also come in, right? The off-season parking space is not bad, but I still hope that it can be standardized to reflect the particularity of staying in a hotel.
There is also a hotel that can enter the park one hour earlier. I feel that no one on the road has checked whether we are staying at the hotel or not, or we can show whether we are staying at the hotel when we swipe our ID card to enter the park. It feels like there is a loophole.
 
Overall satisfied, I hope the shortcomings can be improved, because they are all service problems, I hope these problems can be improved next time I stay, and I hope Nuojin will get better and better.

Miss Alice, who helped us check in, explained the entertainment facilities of the hotel and Universal Studios in great detail. She also spoke very gently to the children, and even brought the children to pick up stickers. After checking in, he took us back to the room directly and asked if the room needed to be filled. Proper butler service! Next time I come to the park, I will still choose NUO Gold Resort 🏨

msg:I didn't plan to live, but decided on a temporary basis~ After a little tangled, I chose Nuojin in Huanying and Nuojin~
But aside from the location blessing, there is no doubt that Nuojin's hardware is better than Huanying. It will be more like a resort hotel. The rooms are spacious, with bathtubs, sofas, double beds that can be combined into large beds, and breakfast (can't get up). partners can choose not to include breakfast price), I think it’s right to choose which one is right, see what suits you
Check out at 8:20 (note that the lobby is on the 3rd floor not the 1st floor), throw the luggage into the car in the parking lot without leaving the luggage, and then go through the exclusive entrance channel, and arrive at the park entrance after security check at 8:38. People will be released on time at 40. After the security check, there will be a staff member who will swipe your ID card to check whether you are staying last night or that night. There are non-residents in front of me who were persuaded to return~
The parking fee is 180 yuan / 24 hours, after 12 yuan / hour, the parking space is said to be better than the 200 parking space
Dissatisfaction: 1. 📺 The TV cannot be projected, and most of the people who only watch TV shows are probably older, such a big TV is too wasteful 2. There is no obvious sign from the parking lot to the side door of the lobby

Although there are not many varieties of restaurants and water bars in the executive floor lounge, there are all that you should have. The north terrace can directly see the panoramic view of Universal Studios. In comparison, the parking lot is not enough, and it took two circles to find a parking space. From the hotel to Universal Studios, you can enjoy the VIP trea**ent of entering the park one hour in advance, but it takes about 5-8 minutes to walk from the hotel. Although it is not too far, it is still a little inconvenient. If there is a free fee for the elderly and children The shuttle is even more perfect. All in all, a very recommended hotel 👍

msg:The Universal Studios Hotel I stayed at when I went there for the first time was very fairy tale and very immersive. And it is really convenient to enter the park. Going downstairs is the park on one side and the city avenue on the other side. When having breakfast, especially if you are taking children, there is the interaction of the Minions series, which is good for children. This is his advantage.

Disadvantage of Universal Studios Hotel.

1. The bed is very uncomfortable. The middle of the mattress bulges low on both sides, and the sound of the quilt is loud. It is best to bring a thin quilt if you take your child there. My wife slept in this bed for two days with a bad back.

2. There are very few choices of dishes. Whether it's buffet or a la carte, there is almost no Chinese food. If you want a vegetarian meal, just have creamy cauliflower.

3. The price/performance ratio is not high. The room is small, the sound insulation is not good, and the facilities are poor.

NUO Hotel has a western restaurant and a Chinese restaurant. In addition, the Yangzhou fried rice in the Chinese restaurant is very authentic. The rice is grain by grain, and the eggs are well beaten, which is very delicious and vegetarian. There are meat dishes, and vegetarian dishes are also delicious. The swimming pool and gym are free, and the small bar in the hotel will also deliver some drinks and beer, which is very considerate, and capsule coffee, which are not available in the Universal Hotel.

The room is 20 square meters larger than the Universal Studios Hotel. (Both are double beds) The cost is even cheaper than that of the Universal Studios Hotel, about 300~400 per night.

And it must be recommended to order from Ctrip, because it is cheaper than the APP.

The beds are very comfortable, all comfort levels are good, and it's not too far to get to the Universal City Hotel and City Boulevard.

The uncleanness of the kettle is a common problem in all hotels, and this is no exception

msg:The location of the hotel is very easy to find. You can see the road signs and the hotel parking lot by driving around the Sixth Ring Road. I read a bad review before saying that the hotel doesn't allow luggage, parked very far, etc. In fact, you can park your car at the entrance of the hotel lobby first, and have a bellman to help you with the luggage, then go to the parking lot and ask if the walk is very close. I booked an executive twin room. The room is quite large. The sleeping area is separated from the washroom and toilet. It is very convenient and practical. The only regret is that I don't know that there is a happy hour from 6:00 to 8:00 in the evening. For the executive floor, food and drinks are free. The toiletries used are also very good. The minibar in the room has free beer, milk and sparkling water, as well as enough mineral water pipes. There are also special tea and tea sets. The coffee is also good. Breakfast includes 2 adults and 1 snack, which is okay. After breakfast is full, you can enter Universal Studios an hour earlier. It takes about 3 minutes to walk from the hotel to the Universal Studios Hotel to the entrance to Universal Studios. This trea**ent is applicable to the guests of the Universal Studios Hotel and the NUO Hotel. When checking in, all people who need to enter the park must be taken away. Otherwise, the system does not approve and cannot enter in advance. Although you can enter at 9:00 an hour in advance, you can actually go inside at about 8:30. Only the Harry Potter area is open, so everyone can go here. The most fun Harry Potter Forbidden Journey can be played three times and the hippogriff flight is always a queue item. Enter early and you can play at least five more times. Subproject is good. The children were very happy, some played the Decepticon roller coaster 20 times and there were many other events. It is very suitable to live in the hotel and cap the parking fee of 180 yuan a night. There are also swimming pools and gyms, suitable for parent-child play, highly recommended

Compared with other hotels of the same level, there are no special highlights, but there are no obvious shortcomings at all. First of all, I would like to thank the hotel for its meticulous preparation for the child's birthday, which exceeded expectations; to make a long story short, the overall service feels more systematic, professional, and formal, but I always feel that there is a little something from the heart; It is indeed a great benefit; the room layout and facilities are very good, meeting the rigid needs of a family of multiple people. As for the shortcomings or improvements, the first is the children's playground, which is a constraint for active children, and the overall interaction is not very strong; the shallow pool is generally suitable for children, but the temperature inside is too low ; In winter, only the outdoor parking lot is a bit unfriendly. You can charge the parking fee, but it is very inconvenient to take things back and forth for ten minutes each time. In short, I hope the hotel will be better and better, and we will come again.

msg:First of all thank Jenny for helping us arrange the birthday arrangement.
I went to Universal three times, except for the first time I went to svip, I didn't live there, and I stayed in Nuojin twice.
Objectively speaking, NUO's overall hardware and services are satisfactory enough.

🚗 Transportation: It is so convenient to drive to the parking lot, much closer than the valet parking location. In fact, from Nuojin to Universal, just cross the road and arrive at the entrance of Universal's parking lot, and then walk in 50 meters to enter the park.


🍃Environment: The color scheme of Nuojin is very elegant, including the tooling of the staff, which makes people look very comfortable. The swimming pool and restaurant are of a high standard, and it feels like a vacation in Nuojin.

🔔Service: The staff speak softly and softly, making people feel very comfortable. Because the first time was an anniversary, this time was a birthday, so the customer relations depar**ent arranged a small cake, and the handwritten cards were very touching, and the content of the hand-painted was different each time. He put the two beds together in advance for easy check-in, and also helped to reserve a table for dinner.
Went to the lobby bar for afternoon tea, and took the initiative to remind us that we can use group purchase coupons. The appearance and quality of desserts are online. When I saw the child's birthday card, I took the initiative to send cakes and light candles.

All in all, remarkable. If you don't go to Universal, but you can live there, I think the price/performance ratio is very good.

msg:NUO has been committed to becoming a national brand of high-end hotels in China. The owner is striving for excellence in the quality of materials and equipment and construction, and the professionalism of the owner has also infected many people. The first NUO Hotel was awarded the Luban Award, and this second NUO Resort Hotel is also striving for the Luban Award. The advantages and disadvantages of the stay are as follows:1. Advantages:
1. Living in the Universal Park is very quiet, the hotel landscape is very good, and there is a lake outside the window;
2. Chinese paintings are hung in the room, which looks very elegant;
3. The service is more proactive. Before check-in, you will contact the needs by phone. Many people are welcome in the lobby when you check in;
4. The child was given a birthday card on his birthday, and the child felt a little surprise.
5. The refrigeration effect of the small refrigerator is very good, and the cold beer is very good.2. Disadvantages:
1. The elevator in the south wing shows that you can go to the fitness center on the first floor, but after reaching the first floor, it tells you to go to the third floor lobby first, and then change the elevator to the next floor. It is recommended to block the "fitness center" on the elevator to avoid misleading the guests to toss back and forth.
2. The child's foot was cut in the corner under the door of the shower room, and the duty manager also called to express his concern. It is recommended to check and check the door corner, and paste the anti-collision sticker to prevent the guests from touching;
3. On the child's birthday, the small cakes don't look like small cakes! When the waiter delivered it, he politely said "a welcome snack for your stay"! Especially the taste is very, very bad! After the feedback, I also sent a small cake again (thanks to Miss Wang here). Originally, I saw in the comment area that there were small cakes for birthdays. I originally wanted to surprise the children, but I hoped that the big disappoin**ent would also be big. If the hotel wants to do this value-added service, I hope it has a sense of ceremony, and don't make it nondescript. Otherwise, tell the guests in advance to take out a cake and put it in the small refrigerator to surprise the children. suggestion:
1. The size of the room cannot be changed, and the service is unlimited. Service is not just saying "Hello", it is really thinking about the needs of the guests, doing what you can do, and telling the guests in advance if you can't do it, most of the guests can understand; service is not only about giving When the guest opens the door and guides the way, we must sincerely consider the needs of the guest. If the guest can open the door by himself, and the sign is clear, the guest knows how to go. Opening the door and leading the way is not carbon in the snow, but only the icing on the cake. The meaning is limited.
2. Ask a special person to communicate with the guests before, during and after the check-in. There is a beginning and an end. Nothing can be perfect, so that the guests can feel the sincerity of the service, and problems can basically be solved through communication.It's not necessarily correct, I hope the managers of NUO Hotel can see it and have some reference value.
The meaning of Nuojin is a promise of gold. I sincerely hope that Nuojin will surpass foreign hotel brands such as Hilton and Hyatt and lead the world as a national brand!

It is good to chat in the executive lounge.

In addition, you can enter the park 1 hour earlier at 9:00 (point entry),

The day before the check-in, there will be a special customer service call to ask about the check-in situation and prepare children's products in advance. We ordered Bring a double breakfast, and now there are activities for children for free. We live on the third floor of the South Wing, on the same floor as the lobby, and it is not far from Universal Studios, about 5 minutes. If you still want to stay close to the Universal Studios Hotel, you have to enter the same entrance one hour in advance. This hour is very important, and you rely on it for big projects. Otherwise, the queue time is too long! I feel that the breakfasts in all five-star hotels are the same, with donuts and Beijing snacks. The chocolate bread pudding is hot and soft and delicious!

The hotel environment is quiet and quiet, and the staff's service awareness is very strong! It's not far from Universal Studios. It takes seven or eight minutes to walk there, and it takes 1.5 minutes to walk there! Because the occupancy rate during the week was not tight, the hotel even upgraded the room for free! On the first day of entering the park, I basically played all the projects, so I wanted to have a rest at the hotel for breakfast the next day, and applied for a late check-out. Alice at the front desk was very enthusiastic and professional to help us handle the late afternoon. 1:00 Check out application. The hotel breakfast is quite satisfactory, as a five-star hotel, there is still room for improvement! The room enjoys a free minibar, and the capsule coffee machine is the guarantee of a quality hotel, which is why I especially like it! Stay at the hotel and enjoy an hour early entry to the park in the morning. Next time I go to Universal, I will choose Nuojin!

The staff are very enthusiastic and take the initiative to greet me. I went to the park to play after 12 o'clock and the room was ready to be checked in. My parents were tired and just went to rest. The bed is big, I really like it! Anyone with children knows it! The buffet breakfast is rich in variety, and it has everything you need, such as Western-style Chinese noodles, salad, fruit yogurt, and ice cream (of course, who would be big I want to eat ice cream early in the morning....) It is also very convenient from the hotel to City Avenue, just cross the bridge, and will come again in the future!

msg:The hotel is very good, but only in the hotel.
The reason why I say this is because there are no facilities and services outside the hotel. The parking lot has only open-air parking spaces and the spacing is narrow. Be very careful when opening the door for a slightly wider car. There is no one person in the entire parking lot except the gate lifter who charges. The gate of the hotel is still some distance away, and there is no sign to park for the first time. I don't know where to enter the hotel. Fortunately, there will not be too much luggage here.
Only after entering the hotel door can you feel the facilities and services of a real five-star hotel. The front desk needs to take the subway to the third floor, which is not easy to find. The beauty at the front desk is very professional, because we arrived at the hotel at 12:30 because we entered the park at 1:00 noon for 1.5 days. The front desk checked in first and then gave a card to enter the park. After returning in the evening, I went directly to the front desk to change the room card, and a man's clothes warmly sent us to the room.
As for the room, the biggest feeling is that the layout is very reasonable according to the functions of use. The two 1.5-meter large beds are very comfortable to lie down, the multiple USB ports are very user-friendly, and the coffee capsules and small tea table are also very considerate.
Finally, let’s talk about the parking fee. We spent an extra 230 yuan for parking a day. It’s a little tangled. Although this amount of money is nothing in the cost of a trip to Universal Studios, it is the first time to pay so much parking fee in a hotel. . In fact, in terms of marketing psychology, if the parking fee of 180/day is added to the room fee, and then tell the guests that the hotel VIP parking fee is free, I think the psychological feelings of the guests will be completely different.

Environment: The decoration style is simple Chinese style, the room is quiet and spacious. The scenery outside the window is pleasant.
Hygiene: Very satisfied, clean and fresh. We stayed for one more night and cleaned up after going out, great job!
Service: One day before check-in, a staff member called to inquire about the number of occupants, demand, very considerate! After check-in, everything is ready as required! We are three children and two children, and Xiaobao is 8 months old. We provided cribs, slippers, toothbrushes, and cups according to the number of people, which is great! The mineral water, milk, beverages, and beer in the refrigerator are all free, and they will be replenished for the next day's stay. It's really generous! The little brother ALLEN in the room is warm and thoughtful, five-star!
Transportation: Parking is a little expensive, haha! Capped at 180 all day. It is recommended to stay at the hotel 🈶️ free parking privileges!
Play: The hotel children's playground is suitable for children aged 3 to 5. My family is 12, and Xiaobao is 8 months old. I don't like it very much. The swimming pool is not bad. Dabao will check in on the first day! The park enters the park early at 8:00 in the morning. If you are tired in the middle, you can go back to the hotel to rest, and you can enter the park multiple times.
Dining: There is a lot to eat on City Avenue near the park, but we ate Hunan cuisine outside the park on the first day. It was super delicious and cheap. On the second day, we chose to eat on Neon Street, City Avenue. The hotel restaurant personally feels lacking in character and a little expensive.

After tangled for a while, still no choice of paradise
Because last time it was very important for the hotel 🏨 to deliver food to the room
Satisfied, so this time I chose the buffet breakfast without hesitation
As much as you expect, there is as much disappoin**ent
Hotel 🏨 This buffet breakfast is personally not recommended
I hope to see try not to choose and avoid pits
Variety of desserts looks plentiful
flashy, sweet taste
Hot cocoa was delicious last time
Going to have a drink for breakfast this time
Informed that breakfast is not available
Well then I will try coffee☕️
The smell is very light, not as good as the smell from the capsule coffee machine in the room
Besides, it is understandable that the juice 🍹 sweet is not freshly squeezed
The taste can’t keep up, the western food goes to cheese🧀️ not fresh enough
I won't go into details about the others
My daughter and I were utterly disappointed with this buffet breakfast experience!
For Chinese food, I only chose a boiled egg
Hot milk 🥛 I drank a glass and it showed 80 degrees
It's actually warm!
Five-star hotel buffet breakfast is so unbelievable
Freshness and good taste are very important
This is my personal experience and may be a little one-sided
The restaurant service environment is still very good.
Hotel check-out self-service experience is very good
It is recommended to choose the North Wing room for the amusement park

I had been watching the Universal Studios Hotel before, and I occasionally read Nuojin's reviews the day before the trip, so I decided to book Nuojin. It must be said that, in terms of hardware and service, it is a proper five-star. Every hotel staff will take the initiative to say hello and take the initiative to show you the way. The catering experience is Hejia and room delivery, and they are all very good! The only fly in the oin**ent is the hotel parking fee. I understand that the hotel parking lot operation also requires costs, but it is really not friendly to the hotel guests who charge by the day and by the hour.

Next time, I will find a special time to come to the hotel 🏨. Finally, I would like to thank every NUO staff member.

msg:The last time I went to Universal Studios, I stayed in a resort hotel. It was too noisy, the room was small, and the SPA was too crowded. I chose Nuojin this time, it's so comfortable.

1. The twin room is very big, and it is easy to put them together. The three people sleep far away and do not affect each other. The pillow was a little high, and I forgot to take the baby's pillow. My father and I both felt it was too high. The baby's father temporarily took a bath towel and softer clothes and wrapped a pillow for the baby. The layout is very human. The toilet and shower room are separated independently, and the double washbasin and bathtub are also separated, so that the family does not affect each other. The double doors are designed like a maze, and the children have a good time running around in circles.
2. Capsule coffee machines, kettles, tea sets and cups are all beautiful.
3. Swimming pool: A hotel without a swimming pool is really boring. The last time I stayed in a resort hotel, the baby could only watch Minion movies in the children's area, and the parents didn't know what to do. Nuojin is different. The baby goes to the men's locker room by herself, and there are staff to help you change clothes. I can go in after changing slippers. The locker room is dry and comfortable, not steamy, very comfortable. The baby swam once in the afternoon and once after dinner, and the swimming pool is basically filled with children. A bunch of parents are poking their phones on the reclining chairs next to them.
4. In the evening, my baby and my father went swimming. I went to the SPA, 90 minutes of essential oil massage, and the technician was very professional. The spa is by the pool.
5. We didn't order breakfast this time. It was really difficult to get up in the morning, and we had to enter the park early. Last time, we ate an egg, a sausage, and a piece of bread in a hurry. It was not worth it. This time, I brought bread, fruit, yogurt, and drank coffee in the room. We entered the park early at 8:00. We went downstairs at 8:15.
6. There are few people and few people, the service is good, the service personnel are all in place, and you can see when you need to look up. After finishing the spa, I went back to the west wing. My husband took the room card. When I got to the elevator, I realized that I couldn’t swipe the floor. The front desk staff called and asked about my birthday to verify my confidence. I made a temporary card and trotted it. Kind, thank you!
7. In order to watch the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, I didn't go to the restaurant to have dinner. I scanned the QR code to order food and delivered it to my room. It was super convenient and I could order a lot of dishes.
8. It’s really not far from the studio. It’s much closer than I imagined. It takes a while to get there. Compared to the 20,000 steps in the studio all day, the distance of several hundred steps is really negligible.
9. Ah, parking, outdoor parking is something I don't quite understand. The parking fee is the same as the resort hotel, and we need to pay by ourselves. We parked for two days, 255 yuan.
10. Small shop: The wands are well stocked, the baby bought Voldemort's wand, and Harry, Hermione, Snape and Dumbledore have everything.

Next time I will stay in Nuojin.

Very comfortable hotel, the decoration style is very warm, very holiday a**osphere, the bed is big and the hygiene is very clean. The hotel has a shuttle bus to and from the park, which runs every 15 minutes, which is very convenient. You can also walk for about 10 minutes. I especially like the service of Nuojin 👍🏻, the service staff in every link from check-in to leaving feel at home. Every service staff will greet each other when they meet, and the proportions are just right. A hotel that you can choose even if you don't go to the world, recommended!

advantage:
1. New facilities, big rooms and very clean. There is no problem for a family of 4 with two 1.5-meter beds, and the bathroom is also very spacious. The tea delivered was delicious. The whole hotel is tastefully decorated, Chinese style
2. The service attitude is very good. Before check-in, someone called and informed that there were two children. The children's supplies were all available in the room, and there were also small cards handwritten by the staff and lovely desserts as gifts. The service staff encountered along the way are also very friendly and enthusiastic
3. Although the children's center is not big, it is clean and tidy, and the Minions movies played are very attractive to children
4. There are more kinds of baked goods in breakfast than ordinary breakfast buffet, which caters to children's preferences
shortcoming:
1. The swimming pool is too small and the water temperature is low. The child will be cold after a long time.
2. The room is slightly decorated
All in all, it is a great hotel, highly recommended

msg:The room is spacious, with a bathtub, a capsule coffee machine, and a teapot, which suits me very well. All you can drink from the mini bar. The swimming pool is nice, bright and spacious, and the temperature is very suitable. The dressing room is very comfortable. However, there are a few shortcomings and need to be improved. One is that there is a problem with the cup volume setting of the capsule coffee machine. The espresso standard is 40ML. I don’t know if it’s the last guest or it’s not set up from the beginning. In fact, it’s very easy to restore the factory settings after taking a capsule. It was still wrong after changing to another machine. I had to estimate that it was about 40ML and then stopped manually. It is recommended to check the machine every time. The breakfast is very average, except for the rice noodles and juice, everything else is not good.
On the whole, it is very suitable to live in the park. You can enter the park in advance, come back to rest in the middle, or stay in the hotel.

Every employee in the hotel lobby will greet you, very warm and polite. The gentleman who checked in at the front desk was also very patient and took the trouble to answer every question of mine. Liu Yihang, who helped deliver the luggage, was also very warm and thoughtful and had a particularly good sense of service. I also want to thank Sophia and Kayla for the birthday surprises that made me very happy.
🍃Environment: The hotel's environmental facilities are very good, very quiet, safe, clean and comfortable. The double bed room is very spacious and clean. The mattress and pillows are very comfortable to sleep on. The shower facilities are good, and the water temperature and quantity are very suitable.
The hotel is very close to Universal Studios, about 10 minutes away, there are signs along the way, and there is also an hour’s advance admission trea**ent, which is a considerable advantage for the players.
Generally speaking, the whole family thinks that this staying experience is very good, five-star hotel and five-star service, whether it is here for work or play, it is recommended.

🏨I booked a garden view room. The hotel called in advance to inquire about the request. The attitude was super good. When I entered the room, I found that it was given the most frontal position, where I could directly see the lake view and the city avenue~

🛀The double double bed room is very wide and can accommodate four people; the bathroom and toilet are separated from dry and wet areas, especially the water spray in the shower is great. The new hotel has complete facilities

🍪Because it was Chris**as Eve, the hotel also gave away chocolate sleigh and Chris**as cookies, which was so thoughtful~

🎡If you stay at Nuojin, you can enter the park one hour early, which is really a great benefit! Universal Studios Winter opens at 10 o'clock, and hotel guests can enter the park at 9 o'clock. After entering, we went straight to Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and played directly. We were so happy!

🅿️Parking in the hotel is not free, it is 3 yuan/15min, and overnight parking is capped at 180 yuan. It is expensive, but it is really convenient.

The four-eyed brother who gave the luggage was polite and smiled, praise!
NUO employees are all very good and enthusiastic.
The environment is really nice and tidy.
The staff in charge are also very attentive.
The western food is a bit poor and needs to be improved.
I chose room delivery service for breakfast and ordered the croissant, which was delicious!
To go to Universal Studios, you must stay in the hotel in the park. It is important to enter the park in advance.
At less than ten o'clock, the basic game has been punched in, and you can shoot the Harry Potter park with no one. There is nothing wrong with choosing to stay in NUO.

msg:To be honest, I originally wanted to book the Universal Studios Hotel. Later, I heard from my friends that the grade of this hotel is actually higher than that of Universal, but the price is similar, so I changed it here.

🚗 Transportation: Due to the Thursday limit, I took the subway to Universal Studios. In fact, you can already see the hotel when you get off the subway. However, if you want to walk over, you need to go around a little bit and pass through Universal Studios. It's just a short walk from the hotel.

🔔Service: The waiters here are very good, and I have already called the day before I came back to inquire about the needs. Since I brought a child, I also specially helped me upgrade to the executive floor. From check-in to entering the room, my little brother accompanied me throughout the whole process, and I also specially asked the housekeeping depar**ent to help me make a bed. It was really considerate.

🧹Hygienic: The newly opened hotel has a slight smell of new furniture, but it is completely acceptable even if I bring a child. The corridor and the room are very clean. I live on the 6th floor of the executive floor and feel very quiet, with almost no noise.
The hotel also provides a mini bar, tea and coffee, all of which are free. When I came in, I saw a gym and swimming pool on the first floor, but I didn’t experience it because I was staying for a short period of time. If I have a chance to come next time, I must try it...

In addition, let’s talk about the shortcomings I think...
First of all: there are really few road signs. Maybe it was dark outside when I arrived. After the security check, I asked people all the way and found them. There are so few signs that can guide me. In fact, not only outside the hotel, but also inside the hotel. After going downstairs to the first floor, you can see that there are several doors leading to the outdoors, but there is no such thing as where each door goes out or how to choose which direction to go. It's a bit dark when I don't get to the waiter.
Second: There is no ventilation system in his room, only the bathroom can hear the fan spinning vaguely, but the residents cannot control the switch. The room is equipped with central air-conditioning, and there is also no fresh air and ventilation function. As a result, the room will feel a little stuffy after the shower. Although it will be much better after a period of time, it is a five-star hotel. It should be improved...

The service staff's service attitude is particularly good. The only thing that is not satisfied is that although there is a room card during the epidemic, they are in and out. It still has to have a health code, which feels quite inhumane, but it must be the requirement of the entire park, and there is no way.

🧹Hygienic: Very standard five-star hotel. Of course, the sanitation is good, nothing to say. We stayed for another day when the aunt came to clean the hallway and helped us stack up a pile of clothes and put them neatly and wash them. A bunch of cosmetics on the station are also all done for help. Auntie!
🍃Environment: I have always liked the Chinese-style modern decoration. The hotel is beautifully designed, soundproofed and very quiet. Compared with the hustle and bustle of the scenic spot, it feels like being hidden in the city.
🔔Service: When we arrived on the first day, the young lady at the front desk said that the occupancy rate was not very high recently and helped us upgrade the room type. I was super lucky and continued to stay for another day and continued to help us upgrade, including the hotel entrance and the elevator The staff who showed the way to the universal avenue flyover are all super kind and very friendly~ It’s such a cold day. The staff only wore a thin coat similar to a tunic suit. Nuojin, let’s add clothes for everyone. It feels that winter will be very costly. Staff🌝
🍽Room service: Banana cakes are very delicious. Just scan the QR code on the menu and place an order on WeChat. It will be ready in about half an hour. It will be delivered directly to the room. After eating, someone will come to collect the cutlery. The fries are also very crispy. A little bit tired
⚠️There are two different routes to City Avenue and directly into Universal Studios. There are staff/street signs to give directions. Walk for about 10 minutes.
Later, we didn’t know where we lost our room card. The young lady at the front desk who wanted to keep it as a souvenir made up a patterned one for us, which happened to be the only item we didn’t get. Thank you very much for a very happy journey. See you next time!

However, due to the popularity of the National Day holiday, the hotel rooms are basically full, leaving only the expensive presidential suites and suites, so I chose NUO Resort Hotel, in fact, is not far away by walking for ten minutes.
The car can be parked directly at the hotel, and the parking fee is 12 yuan an hour.
The twin room does not include breakfast for 2,700 per night, and breakfast is 198 yuan per person. The minibar in the room is free, and the tea on the table is also free. The swimming pool in the hotel has a constant temperature of 28 degrees. There is a 1.2-meter small pool for parents and children. The swimming pool closes at 10 o'clock. The gym is open 24 hours, and the children's world is open until six in the evening. When we came, it happened to be game time from four to six. X-box and PS4 can be played. There are a few games that the latest kids can enjoy. The hotel has a shuttle bus to Universal Studios in 15 minutes.
The only advantage of staying in this hotel is that you can enter one hour in advance and you can take the VIP channel of the Universal Studios Hotel. The park opened at eight o'clock and we came in at seven o'clock.

This is a failure. The hotel parks at 180 for 24 hours, 12 per hour for more than 24 hours. It’s very expensive. It’s the same as Universal Studios Hotel’s parking fee.

msg:Give a five-star praise. I have gone out to play and lived in Nuojin several times before, and the impression is good. I thought this would be worse than expected in the park, but it was really good after the experience. First of all, it goes without saying that there are only two Universal Studios hotels, and NUO is definitely more cost-effective than the other. It is recommended to check in at around three or four in the afternoon on the first day, and then you can take the bus from the hotel to City Avenue to City Avenue to buy, buy, buy and pat, to avoid carrying a lot of things the next day, and entering the park the next day You won’t go through the city avenue, so it’s best to go one day in advance. If you take the bus, you only need to show your room card. If the room is not cleaned, the front desk can also give a temporary card as a voucher. The bus departs every 15 minutes. The terminal is next to the city avenue ADIDAS. It is also at this location when you return. VIP lounge with valet parking will do). Entering the park early the next morning, I said it was 8 o’clock, but I still had to go early because I had to line up to go through the security check. It took about 5 minutes to walk to the place where I entered the park early. There are signs. Many queues are early. We went in before 8 o'clock. We checked out from the hotel at about 7:30, put the luggage in the car, and went to line up. We lined up for about 20 minutes and entered the park at 8:10. First, I ran to Harry Potter and played directly without queuing. After I got out at 8:40, I took a photo of the meeting in the Harry Potter Park while there were no people. I hurried to Leap Jurassic without queuing up. It's already 9:10, and people who normally enter the park at 9 o'clock will also come in, so basically you need to queue up later, and you can enter the park in advance to play at least two major events. Let’s talk about the interior of the hotel. It’s very new and big. The bathtub is also good. The drinks in the refrigerator are free. 666. The tea gift box is also good. There is also a coffee machine and coffee. The taste is also very good. In short, everything in the room is It's great and meets the five-star standard. The only fly in the oin**ent was that when I checked in, I asked if I had any requirements for the floor. I said that I could move in as soon as possible, and it was given to me on the first floor. . . . The first floor is still a bit cold, and it is better to be more demanding. If I tell the front desk that I am a Ctrip Reviewer, I would not give me the first floor. It is a little flawed, but overall it is very worthwhile. In addition, the parking fee is limited to 180 for a 24-hour period. The north area is close to the bus, and the east area is close to the south building of the hotel.

Bringing the baby to play around the world, there are indeed few hotel guests. When we checked in, we delayed the check-out time, which gave us a more relaxed lunch time the next day.
The double bed room allows the four members of our twin family to have enough and comfortable sleep, the bedding is very comfortable, and they wake up naturally.
Haha, it's the first time to drink in the Minibar, and the capsule coffee is also good.
The service is to praise. Every staff member will greet us and smile from the heart when they see us, and wish us have fun, and the babies can feel friendly.
It is also very convenient to order food to the room, and the temperature of the meal is also very good.
I have stayed in NUO in other places before, and the experience was pretty good. This time, Global NUO has increased my favor.
Hope to go again.

They gave my baby a detailed introduction to the strategy of Universal Studios Resort, how to take the shuttle bus from the hotel to Universal Avenue, and where to go to enter the park early the next morning. It really looks like this little beauty! 2. The hotel is divided into rooms in the south wing and rooms in the north wing. Each point that is easy to go wrong has a dedicated service staff to guide and praise it. 3. The hotel's swimming pool is not deep and is very friendly to children. My baby is 9 years old and doesn't know how to swim very much. He can play freely in the swimming pool without worrying about flooding. The baby is very happy. There is also a clothes dryer to dry swimsuits. 4. Booked a double room with a view. The view outside the window is very good. In the morning, open the curtains to enjoy the autumn scenery. And together they are 3 meters wide, great! 5. Because it was not a weekend, the room was not too tight the next day, so I helped to do a late check-out, came back at noon to sleep for a while, and continued to play with the baby in the afternoon, so that I would not be tired and paralyzed at night. All in all, a very good staying experience, I will choose NUO again next time! Few comments, this time I was really moved by the service!

I went in early this hour, brushed Harry Potter and Jurassic, and then played Transformers. In short, on this day, I have not queued for more than 40 minutes without speed. I have watched all the performances and played all the events. I am very pleased.
Come out at night and go directly to the hotel to pick up your luggage and go home, which is convenient and quick.

I saw that two children were given a room upgrade for free. Thank you very much. Although it takes five minutes to walk from the hotel to the park than the Universal Hotel, although the two hotels are next to each other, it takes five minutes to walk to the front desk. However, you have to queue up in hotels to enter the park. There are a lot of people around the world, but there are still fewer Nuojin people. The main Nuojin room is 20 square meters larger than that of the world, and the hardware is also higher. Under the same expensive price conditions, it would be better to take a few more steps. To choose Nuojin. Toiletries in the room are complete, and bottled water is sufficient for one large and four small. Admission in advance is perfect, only the Harry Potter area is open, enough to play two popular items and buy things.

The front desk of the hotel is on the third floor. The staff’s overall service awareness is higher than that of the Universal Hotel. The public areas are also a little wider, and the decoration shows a sense of tranquility. Indeed, the environment during the whole stay was very quiet.
The room is more spacious and the decoration is new in Chinese style. I have to say that this is what the Chinese style should look like, compared to the netherworld decoration rolling next door! The bathroom has a bathtub, dry and wet separation, and a small cloakroom. There is beer and beverages in the mini bar refrigerator, free-flowing, there is a capsule coffee machine, tea sets and tea, but there is no time to make 😂 The bedside table has a speaker but cannot be played
The location is a bit farther from the Universal Hotel to the city avenue and the park. It takes 5-10 minutes longer to walk, but it’s more comprehensive than the next door. Anyway, if I come again, I will only choose NUO, very sure!

NUO’s room is OK, hygiene is OK, service staff, no, I was wrong, the staff is kind, gentle and not arrogant.. This is a pure business hotel, not suitable for children.

-There is a single charge for parking, the maximum is 180 for one day, 360 for two days, and so on ☹️
-Arrive after 4pm that day, inform that the parking lot is full, and let yourself find free parking. For this class of hotel, shouldn't more parking spaces be reserved? Besides, there seems to be no underground garage
-Priority admission is actually a long queue. There are already N-long queues (Figure 9) until 8 o'clock on the day of Mid-Autumn Festival to enter the park in advance (Figure 9), and they have been in line for almost 30 minutes (passing two checkpoints: security and entrance gates) , Fewer windows, more people 😰). There are a total of 1,200 rooms in the two hotels. Everyone wants to enter the park first, and there will be no shortage of people. If you just want to enter the park in advance, you might as well buy U-Speed Pass or VIP, otherwise you have to get up early + queue up to enter the park. The peak season may not save much time, but the off-season should be better
-The garden view room actually has no view (picture 10)
-Fewer types of breakfast

There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the preparation is exquisite, the bread and cakes are of high standard, and my favorite cheese is also available in several flavors. In the bad place, there are more foreign guests with children living in the hotel, the order is chaotic, the children are not restrained enough, and the children are allowed to hold more food with their hands. Tea was delivered in the room, and I brought my own tea, so it was useless. The teapot is a bit small, and the two restaurants in the hotel are good. I suggest you have a chance to try it! Hotel parking is not free, parking is quite expensive, it is strange that there is no underground parking lot. Now the five-star Nuojin is cheaper than the four-star, and the price is very high.

1. When checking in, because the mobile phone was out of power and wanted to pay a cash deposit, the staff looked reluctant and took 20 minutes to complete the process. Is the business unskilled or deliberately looking for fault?
2. When entering the North Wing guest room, there is an automatic door that needs to be swiped, just in time for a female staff member to come out of it, and the person who walked behind us didn’t let in. Who Why don't you live there and go for a stroll?
3. I want to drink a cup of coffee early in the morning, and the milk provided is out of date. Is this the rhythm that will kill me?
4. The parking lot is really expensive and there are few parking spaces. Many people who go to Universal Studios park their cars in the hotel parking lot. There is no place during the day and it is empty at night. Since it is positioned as a high-end resort hotel, everyone should be welcome. Driving, is it the customer positioning is low-carbon travel subway family? Can’t we distinguish between the parking fees for residents and the outside world?

When I went there, I made a 400 call on Ctrip at more than 11pm. The result was that the resort was unified and not during service hours. Later, I found it smoothly. After I checked in, the hotel was divided into different areas, and I went to the room and walked relatively far. The room is relatively new, no different from the other five-stars. The newly opened think it will be cleaner, but the sanitation is not satisfactory. Look at the dust on the roll table 😓... Hotel parking 12/hour. The administrative service staff will not take the initiative to inform, we only asked the request until the next day, a female manager apologized and delayed the check-out time. In addition, there is no need to set an administrative order to play in the studio, because there is no time to enjoy his service...The quick access channel is the VIP channel, because we already have a VIP, so I don’t feel it...Anyway, it is a very ordinary five-star service, just opened the service unprofessional. It is recommended to have your own phone, so that friends who drive from other places will feel more at ease. After all, the large suburbs have not been developed...

msg:Due to the sudden recurrence of the epidemic, after seeing the report of the Beijing epidemic, I missed the time when I wanted to cancel. The rule is that the cancellation can be cancelled before 16:00 on the 22nd, and the cancellation is less than 16:5, just after the time . So I asked Ctrip to communicate and deal with it. Thinking about the special situation of the epidemic, the hotel should be accommodating. I provided the unit's epidemic prevention requirements, the situation of not approving the departure from Tianjin, etc., but I did not expect that the hotel would not refund anything, even if it was less. I can't bear some liquidated damages for the refund point, even rescheduling. What said that Universal Studios only accepts cancellation applications from tourists in high-risk areas. A bunch of proofs must be provided. The process will be processed at least 20 days, which is really superior. . I would like to ask, if low-risk tourists come to Beijing to play in Beijing, you will not be infected with the NUO Hotel. Can Huan Ying guarantee it? Tourists in medium- and high-risk areas do not need your hotel to provide additional unsubscription services at all, because the policy is that no one is allowed to come, so your hotel must unconditionally retire them and respond to the spirit of epidemic prevention and control. Therefore, I very much question whether the NUO Hotel and Beijing Huanying’s epidemic prevention and control work have grasped the spirit of the central government’s epidemic prevention and control, and whether the interests of the pursuit of profit prevail over the prevention and control of the epidemic. Although you may book the NUO Hotel next time, after all, it is more convenient to play around Disney's, especially because of the epidemic, are extremely difficult to communicate. They are really good sons of American fathers! PS: The tickets for Huan Ying can be refunded according to the time ladder. Your hotel is like a stone in a cottage. Ctrip has communicated a lot for me, thanks to all the customer service staff, sales representatives, supervisors, etc.

Never communicated directly with the hotel from beginning to end, because! There is no way to communicate directly! In the current epidemic, we choose to travel cautiously. In the current epidemic, the hotel chooses to implement everything according to the contract. I pay for my prudence and hope that the hotel will take more responsibility in the future and adjust the refund policy appropriately.

msg:I must tell you about this hotel. I booked to stay for two days on the 22nd and 23rd. At noon on the 22nd, I saw the news that the Beijing epidemic has been upgraded to a medium-risk area. Although it is not Tongzhou District, its city has changed to The risk level is medium to high, how can we go about it? During the period, I communicated with the hotel many times, but the hotel was very cold and did not contact at all. The official phone number of the hotel stated that the hotel phone number is not public, and the hotel was asked to call back for consultation and never received a phone call from the hotel. Through Ctrip, I learned that the reason why the hotel did not cancel the reservation was that I did not receive the relevant notice. Do you not watch the news? The principle of the hotel is that we can only refund if we do not accept you, but you are already at a medium to high risk. I want to say, no matter what kind of foreign-funded enterprise you are, you are now in China, so you should conform to China's national conditions. National epidemic prevention and control policy: You are not allowed to travel to medium- and high-risk areas unless necessary. Why can't you unsubscribe if I don't go? Is it a bit overlord?

msg:The overall environment is good, the rooms are relatively large, and entering the park early is the biggest advantage. However, it was a bit of a looting to charge 180 per day for parking fees. It was the first time I encountered guests in a luxury hotel and charged parking fees, and it was unscrupulously so expensive. Summarize the necessity of staying at this hotel: Whether you have a superior speed pass from outside or inside Beijing, you can find a five-star close to it, and it will win here; if there is no superior speed pass, you can’t stand the line, but there are 2 With a schedule of more than days, the nearby 5 stars plus the early morning line up, the first wave of admission at 8 o'clock; in the end, there is really no way. If you want to enter the park early, first look at the Universal Studios Hotel and then here.

There is no service. The suitcase at the entrance of the hotel is a furnishing, and will not help you deliver your luggage to the room. When checking out, because there was too much luggage and asked to send a cart, the waiter who answered the phone said that it would take a long time to wait. We said it’s okay, you can wait. Then I said something I forgot, but I didn't want to. Also find some grand reasons. I suggest you go to the Universal Studios Hotel next time, closer to the park.

Calling Universal Studios customer service told me: There is no way to reply. With the prices of top hotels in Beijing, the service is indeed not as good as a three-star hotel. None of the services promised before booking, such as the shuttle to and from the park, were not fulfilled. A refreshing drink from the mini bar in the luxury suite was delivered at 12 o'clock in the evening, and the room service phone could not be reached at all. The guest went to the lobby two or three times to solve the problem. The manager on duty is too amateur, and the answer to any question in communication is: no, no way! Hanging a sign of a five-star hotel is too bad.

When there are many people, we have to wait until the year of the monkey.

The entrance to the park in advance is at the Universal Hotel, and the Nuo Jin’s will have to walk for five minutes. If it is not for early entry, you should not stay again.

我就覺得這個酒店訂的對了
直接深入哈利波特做一個麻瓜
一整天該玩的都玩到了 
省了好幾個優速通
這個住是非常值的
一整天玩的太累了 
回酒店路過隔壁酒店大堂 鬧哄哄全是麻瓜
回到這邊酒店相比之下就很安靜
玩了一天太累了
也沒留酒店環境的照片
住的非常舒適 
玩好了泡一個熱水澡 掃清一天的疲憊
最後退房送我一張卡片做留念
開心🥳

服務非常非常滿意。提前電話聯繫確定行程，也幫忙安排了靠近北翼的房間。入住從打車下車開始，一路有工作人員幫忙把行李拿到房間。22點需要幫忙加熱外帶食物，在簽免責的情況下，也幫助取送加熱了，退房遺落的kindle也幫我們妥善送回。還有經理的手寫卡片，總之服務是非常非常滿意。

環境：
入住的時候下雪了，中式的諾金加雪更好看。房間空間很大，也安靜，休息的很好。

提前1小時入園權益（非門票）:非常不錯，雖然相比環球酒店會多5分鐘步行路程，但提前入園的一個小時，真的讓我們拍了很多沒遊客亂入的照片。就很棒～
下次來還會選擇。

環境:我聽説諾金相對沒有那麼多熊孩子入住，更適合大人。事實上還是有很多小朋友的，但是都是很乖的小朋友，沒有吵吵鬧鬧的。酒店很安靜也很乾凈，感覺非常舒適。房間也很大，我們四個成年女孩子住也沒問題。不過預算足夠兩個人住一間房的話就更爽

在這麼舒服的環境下能提前一小時入園簡直絕了，相當於買了幾個優速通。比較可惜的是我們時間比較緊張，酒店很多服務都沒體驗，如果下次再來我會再住這家酒店。

提前入園的權益還可以，其他的確實太過於普通。

而且這個酒店還收按金，國內這麼做的酒店真的不多了，先進的東西不學，就學一些國外的糟粕。

位置酒店離城市大道更近，到環球入口還是有點距離，走專用通道步行也需要一刻鐘左右。
自駕的話停車收費全天180，而且衹有户外停車場，再走到大堂或從一樓穿行都有些距離，天氣太冷或太熱體驗都會比較差，不太推薦。
另外建議酒店除了配置員工，應該加強硬件標識指引或在入住時提供酒店內同行指引圖，畢竟是度假酒店，指示標還是太少了，各樓層的同行指引也不清晰，影響入住體驗。

2.去餐廳用早餐，坐下來服務員不來問要咖啡還是茶，先急着説要拿pose機讓我付款？？？酒店客人沒有按金嗎？那麼怕別人逃單嗎？感覺很差！

缺點：走到樂園好遠～～～建議提供短駁車，減少客人的步行時間，重點是，路上的標識不清楚，我們從樂園出來找都找不到酒店大門在哪裡，而且還不是我們在找，好幾個家庭都在酒店門口轉悠……至少應該安排個工作人員指引一下才是！

衞生：甜甜圈補充的時候，是後廚的人直接用手拿着來補充的，雖然知道在廚房工作手是乾淨的但是不戴手套還是感覺不太好 果汁區域的杯子都是口朝上擺放的這感覺也不太衞生。

酒店雖然離園區比較遠，但是酒店環境好了，房間很寬敞，隔音效果很好，東西配備齊全，還有mini bar 免費喝，礦泉水和飲料暢飲。
早上可以提前入園和中間可以回酒店休息，對我這種中間還要回酒店幹活的人來説，非常需要（🥹打工人的無奈）
剛好那天萬聖節活動，體驗了一把不一樣的環球影城，很特別也很棒。遊戲設施全部玩了一遍，還多玩了幾趟火種源爭奪戰、禁忌之旅，感覺辦了張年卡，來住酒店真的是很值得。
期待過年後再去住啦，期待明年會有更多的活動。

環球影城早享權益（提前1小時入園）:提前入園區很爽，入園時可以看到園區門口排的長隊，園區的服務人員看到會上來殷切問候，在別人羨慕的眼神下體驗不一樣的服務是很爽的。

整體來説，酒店的裝修很新，吊頂也很大氣，服務和接待都很熱情主動，房間佈局也不錯，其他配套的娛樂設施都很齊全，完全可以作為一個destination hotel，就算不去環球也可以來體驗體驗~

酒店整體服務真的很好，從大堂接待到禮賓服務，都是有禮有節。入住前入住後工作人員小陳都有致電問候和回訪，服務也非常貼心。房間比較大，浴室是我喜歡的乾濕分離，洗手枱乾淨明亮。房間燈光温度都很適宜，睡得很舒服。
購買的1.5日票，第一天下午入園玩到關門在大街吃好晚飯回酒店路程也不遠，有一條小路直通酒店。第二天早享從專屬通道入園，步行距離也就五分鐘左右，從安檢到入園也就三十秒。如果下次再來環球影城遊玩，我還會選擇諾金酒店。

唯一是第一天晚上，淋浴間不下水時，叫來了值班經理，應該是高經理，暫時安撫了我的情緒。第二天晚上，對面房間深夜吵鬧時，給出了比較快的響應。其他都是……嗯，其他沒有任何服務可言。
對了，按金是近期所有酒店中退回最慢的，然後早飯是收攤最早的。十點。

壞：空氣質量！進屋10 分鐘孩子和我嗓子就不舒服，給了空氣凈化器更糟，在姐姐床頭，她咳到凌晨3 點，我也沒睡，想着玩不了了明天！關掉挪開後半小時好一些了。當日可是5:00起床去科技館累一天，諾金晚7點多才辦理入住，想美美睡一覺！？沒睡好那滋味太崩潰了！
硬件：現在我正躺在希爾頓歡朋，諾金房間夠大，乾淨，分區合理，但是同樣21年的酒店為什麼歡朋這裏就沒有味道！？這主動延時到下午2:00，諾金11 定退房，去園區早七點就得起床去酒店入口排隊，行李寄存，重點，去取行李回到環球停車場需要40走分鐘路程。諾金浴缸噴頭壞了維修人晚九點修好，早晨渾身沒精神喝咖啡吧 咖啡機壞的，轉頭拎着行李去園區排隊，不能再呆！
總結：提前1小時入園最值，硬件很好，因為空氣質量住宿舒適感很差，服務沒問題👍，不敏感人羣可以考慮。

除了這個辦理入住的女前台令人噁心以外，別的人員都很好很熱情，然後酒店迷你吧全部免費不錯👍。

 入園推薦住在北翼客房，直接客房側電梯下到一樓，出客房玻璃移門就是酒店出口，是提前入園（環球影城 1 樓）最近的地方。
由於大堂在三樓，住在三樓也很不錯，省得倒換電梯，寄存也方便。
酒店的早餐感覺一般，如果 228 不是很值得。小孩補差價 130 元一人。
另外請提前入園也很拼，八點入園 七點二十就排了很多很多人了，祝大家好運，不管如何， 起的早，跑得快， 真的很重要！

服務：前台服務很熱情，原本做好下午4點入住的準備了，畢竟旅遊旺季還是可以理解的，但辦理時看到長者和孩子特意找了一間退房早的房間讓我們提前入住了。但對於房間保潔就不能打滿分了，雖然是我們要求簡單打掃，但房間內每天還添置的備品還是應該主動添加的吧！而不是我們自己要吧！
提前1小時入園環球影城:這個必須是賣點，早一小時能節省很多時間，而且專用通道安檢很方便。

再來説説房間，很寬敞乾淨！裝修風格相比另一家環球大酒店我更喜歡。其它硬件設施啥的我也看不來……總之這是我在北京住的最舒服的一晚！我完全挑不出毛病的那種！

而且【提前1h入園】這個權益真的很棒！那天我們晚上沒怎麼睡着，大概7:30就到通道那邊排隊了。結果一上午！就刷完了所有想玩的項目，大致順序是【哈利波特禁忌之旅 — 小黃人過山車 — 小黃人4d電影 — 侏羅紀世界 — 變形金剛火種源】，這些玩好差不多才11點！然後下午就開始佛系刷點人少的小項目，走之前最後玩了【飛躍侏羅紀】，這算是唯一一個我們真的排了蠻久的項目（大概1h+）排完出來我想説！上午提前入園給人的體驗感真的好好！這不相當於買了5項fp！大家快沖沖沖！去環球玩的話諾金一定要住啊！

然後就是服務問題，也不是我矯情非得讓禮賓推行李，一般來説1500以上的酒店禮賓推行李已經是默認操作了，如果行李不多我也不喜歡別人幫忙，但是……北京遊真的很費腳，到達酒店人超級累，禮賓也沒個接行李的動作，我5歲的女兒一個小人在那推一個小箱子，禮賓也衹在前面引路一點都不搭把手（還衹引了一小段，後面全靠自己找），我真的是佩服的。本來服務打的三顆星，越寫越生氣，這次我狠心了衹打一顆星，希望酒店方面這方面服務培訓更到位些。
其實衹住酒店享受提起前一小時入園就可以了！早餐的話真心不建議，真的真的不建議，酸奶都是蒙牛最基礎的那款酸奶，這個價位的早餐實屬有點寒磣。看着東西很多但都不是正兒八經的早餐，也沒有主題人物互動，這個早餐軟件軟件沒有硬件硬件沒有，主打一個衹賣貴的不賣對的。可以貴但真的得值，現在想想還是覺得怨種。
再説點好的，水送的很多，暑期的北京全靠水續命了。

msg:整體還是很好的，乾淨整潔，服務也很周到，進門會主動幫忙推行李從而更方便去辦理入住。
大堂層就有紀念品店，如果不想在園區裏排隊，可以在酒店選購。
客房分南北翼，不跟着指示標走可能會迷路。行政層房間很大，很舒服，衹是在客房區看不到紙巾，衹有在洗漱台有紙巾，有些許不方便。紀念房卡可以帶走留念。早餐基本能夠滿足需求，種類還是比較多的。如果晚上的happy hour能夠晚一些，或許對於純遊玩的遊客來説更有吸引力，現在是18:00-20:00，環影出來21:00，再回酒店就享受不了了。
入園有專門的路徑，穿去環球影城酒店就可以實現直接入園，十分方便！

人相對少，也就很安靜，玩累了可以好好休息。
唯一不足的是，辦理入住的時間比較晚，去早了可能房間沒打掃完畢。好在行李一寄存就可以去玩耍。
晚上七點後加第二天提前一小時入園，排隊大項基本可以刷一遍。

msg:聽朋友推薦，第一次來這裏住酒店，但是體驗感非常差，衹能説服務遠遠配不上這個價格，別來！建議去園區另一個酒店，別來諾金！！！別來諾金！！！別來諾金！！！第一次聽説酒店方對於客人反饋不斷找理由不主動溝通解決措施的，第一次聽説酒店有11點退房的政策，然後2點退房成福利的？？？
1⃣️事件起因經過：第一天入住，然後趁着晚上去環球大道逛逛，大概快11點從園區方向回酒店（注意，衹有一個門是客人通往園區的門），結果酒店竟然鎖門了？辦理入住沒有任何人告知我們11點這個門會鎖啊？這也就算了，被鎖後按照旅遊app上的酒店電話打過去求助，明確説了被困在日出巷從園區回酒店的門上，酒店工作人員愣是找了20幾分鐘找不到我們，找不到我們也不會打電話問問我們，所以我們加上其他兩個客人等了近半小時，被蚊子叮。最後是求助在門內散步的外國客人，那個客人去找了服務人員，回來的時候人家一個人回來了，説酒店將會找人來。我們等了幾分鐘還沒等到，那個客人指引我們從旁邊的員工通道進入。此時沒有看到任何員工與保安！！！
2⃣️ 事件的反饋：這個事情當即反饋給值班經理，結果人家總結這個事情的原因衹是在於溝通不暢，怪我們説的定位不清，導致找了二十分鐘都沒找到哪個門，並且補償方案為提供20元園區內冰淇淋代金券。 Excuse me? 第一，你們找不到我們是不是應該電話打給我們再問問？？？第二、我們都讓其他客人找你們求助了，你們是不是應該跟着那位客人馬上來這邊，而不是説一會過去？？？
在您看來這個衹是小插曲，但是在我們看來這個反映出酒店存在很大的管理漏洞，客人的安全存在潛在危險。結果人家説，隔着這個門幾十米走員工通道，那邊有保安亭。把客人鎖在外面不對其構成安全問題。
請問如果保安亭裏的人員有用的話，為什麼沒有在收到我們求助電話後，第一時間來附近巡查？？？
3⃣️ 結果：當天晚上沒有任何結果！！！值班經理先提出給每人20元代金券，然後提出延遲退房飯2點（對你沒聽錯，延遲退房到2點成了賠償方案，我真的要笑死，第一次住酒店聽説這個成為了福利啊）。
我們不接受這種處理方案，經理竟然表示沒辦法，自己沒有更多權限給出其他的補償了，然後僵持到了半夜十二點多，因為我們看不到酒店房的態度和誠意，所以衹能提出第二天酒店再提供更有誠意的反饋處理和賠償方案。
4⃣️後續：但是第二天啥溝通反饋都沒有，房間多了1個果盤，甚至連就要道歉和處理反饋的字條都沒有。
因為房間抽紙不夠，打給前台，順嘴提了這個事情後續有什麼處理措施沒有，人家才説先反饋記錄我這個問題，隨後還是昨天的值班經理打電話給我，説解決措施是贈送果盤和延遲退房到2點。我問為什麼沒有主動給我溝通我反饋的問題，他説怕打擾我遊玩體驗！很搞笑啊，怕打擾我遊玩體驗，不能在酒店留言給我嗎？啥都不説就多了一個果盤？？

我們一家三口買的環球一天半的票6/5下午先checkin酒店，想第二天早上提前入園。因為臨時有些變化我弟準備第二天一早來和我們匯合。因為一個房間本就有四個名額可以提早一小時入園。怕第二天早上再加人會影響到入園，我們特地在6/5晚上用酒店的電話打的酒店服務，再三確認，酒店告訴我們就算第二天（6/6）一早checkin也可以享受提前入園。
結果什麼都安排好了，我弟早上七點多到酒店前台。結果酒店前台告訴我們必須在前一晚（6/5）checkin才可以享受第二天（6/6）的提前入園。然後我們昨天打的酒店服務電話並不是轉給前台的，所以他們講的不作數，前台也不能負責，需要我們打到正確的電話。聽到這個話真的是讓我們很驚訝。我們明明用的是房間裏酒店的電話並且再三確認，如果酒店的人員不能提供正確的訊息，理應轉給前台，怎麼能要求客户去判斷哪個是酒店正確的訊息呢。
之後酒店的大堂經理調取了電話錄音，證明是他們的工作失誤，給我們安排了提前入園。但是我們對此還是非常不滿意。從始至終，沒有酒店員工真心地表達出歉意。我們已經給大堂經理反應了前台的不當措辭和推卸責任，大堂經理表示她和員工談過話前台並沒有這麼説過。這樣的意思是我們在瞎講話羅？我們不介意酒店方調取任何錄音，但是酒店敢正面承認自己的問題嗎？
估計是酒店生意太好了，所以也無所謂客户的流失吧。但是我想説一個酒店硬件再好，服務那麼差是沒有前途的。當然我相信這個酒店也是會無視這種批評的！
補充一張提前入園通道上的提示，當日辦理入住即可，沒有其他條件限制，沒有説明提前入園所需相關的條件。

提前1小時入園環球影城:這個絕對的贊，一進門刷了4遍飛躍侏羅紀，太爽了，基本不用排隊，刷完四遍，九點半正常開園了，人就多了。

🥹唯一不足的是酒店16點以後才能入住，而次日11點前就得退房。去年來還是14點後入住，今年再來就是16點。

這一點覺得酒店應該有所改觀，客人付的是24小時的房間費用，為什麼衹能住19個小時？並沒有保障到消費者的權益哈。

2，對比環球大酒店來説入園沒那麼方便，要從停車場走一段路。而且如果連住的話，從環球城市大道回酒店的話強烈建議從環球大酒店安檢那裡走，不然按照指示要穿過地鐵站那邊繞十分大的一圈

1.衞生特別好，床上睡的床墊床單特別乾淨，基本上角落都是沒有積灰的，而且一次性的拖鞋穿着也特別舒服
2.裝修好，空間特別大，房間內空氣很清新 ，隔音好
3.不管是前台還是遇到的服務員都特別有禮貌，很專業 ，當時下午1點多到的，有房就直接讓入住了
缺點
1 由於我是坐地鐵來的 ，所以從地鐵過來還是有點距離的，來的時候從f出口走來，真是特別遠，走了快20分鐘，回去的時候才發現c口才是最近的 大概可以縮減一半的時間，這一點，如果有提前告知就好了
建議
房內有免費飲料，畢竟五星酒店，如果能提供一些免費水果就好了
總體 瑕不掩瑜，整體遊玩體驗還是非常不錯的，淡季定的1600一晚 感覺很劃的來，值得推薦，

但是，停車略貴，沒有地下停車場不方便，第一次遇到沒有地下停車場的，來回拿東西好走很久，房間冷。最大的問題，説是無煙房，結果一進屋就很明顯的苦森森的煙味，第一天晚上甚至沒有睡好。經過一天一夜的使用，房間才恢復了有淡淡洗漱用品的味道，所以明顯是上一個使用房間的人有人抽煙，甚至就是在床上抽的，希望酒店能在無煙這方面加強管理。右側洗手池是不通暢的。大床偏小，比本次出行的其他酒店大床小。
