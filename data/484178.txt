msg:We stayed at this hotel for just one night and checked in quickly with a woman named Clover, she was very helpful and kind and got us to our room quickly. 

 The villa we stayed in was an amazing experience. It has all the things you would need like a hot spa pool, very large bed which was very comfortable. There was also two tvs and plenty of room in the villa. It was very clean and we were served dinner and breakfast and the quality of the food was great. 

While in the hotel, we only managed to go to the archery range but there are plenty of activities to do for most people. 

Overall it was a fantastic experience and it was a perfect way to spend with  romantic night with my partner. 

Highly recommend to anyone!

There are no restaurants nearby so you will need to eat at the hotel, which is pretty good (breakfast is pretty impressive and customizable), but we did find that they run out of most dishes quickly. 

Staff was not particularly helpful, or even that polite. There is a shuttle service and your basic needs will be taken care of, but don‚Äôt expect anything more than that. 

The location itself and hotel structure is fascinating and beautiful. Really great potential for this to have been a lovely stay. 

Overall I wouldn‚Äôt go back to this hotel, even at half the price, and suggest choosing one of the many other resorts in the area. We overpaid for an experience that underdelivered.

msg:We had a lovely stay at Bayan Tree Beibei! The room was comfortable and clean, and I was pleasantly surprised by the welcome gift. The resort gives you a booklet full of activities to complete and rewards you can get for completing them.
The honey milk bath was luxurious and left my skin feeling smooth. Breakfast was the best meal, and I loved the self-serve mimosas.
The main downside is the location. Though a nice getaway, the view is a bit marred by a lot of abandoned buildings and construction equipment, which take away from the sense of being in nature. It is a 20-minute drive to the nearest town center (Beibei) which is the only place you can even get basic snacks outside the hotel. The hotel doesn't offer a convenience store, so your only option is to buy the mini bar snacks or order a meal. The Chinese restaurant food is good, but not always open. 
Overall, it was a good place to relax for a couple days, away from the city, but bring your own snacks.

This time, the main problem was that there was a big bug next to the hot spring pool when I first arrived in the room, which was a bit scary. It was not very clean. Everything else was good. The aunt came to change the water and changed it very quickly.

msg:This time I came to Chongqing to watch a concert. I had stayed in Banyan Tree in Hangzhou and Hong Kong before and had a good impression. So although it was far away, I still booked Banyan Tree Beibei.

Facilities: The hotel room is indeed a bit old. Because it is a hot spring hotel and in the mountains, it will be more or less damp, but it is still clean and tidy overall. The hotel also has a small zoo and an archery range. Overall, the facilities are complete and it is very suitable for vacation. The temperature of the small hot spring pool in the room is also very comfortable, and the terrace is very suitable for sunbathing during the day.

Environment: The ecology is very good! I like the feeling of waking up in the mountains. The environment is absolutely amazing, it's great!

Service: Banyan Tree's service has always been excellent, especially this time because we were very special forces, so we came to check in very late. The housekeeper Xiao Yi waited until we came and arranged everything for us. And he also gave a lot of relevant warm reminders on WeChat, and also prepared mosquito repellent stickers for us. During the entire check-in process, if you tell Xiao Yi about any needs, you can get a response quickly. It can be said that this stay experience left a good impression! I will stay here next time~

It is recommended to live on a high floor and face the sun. It is also recommended that the hotel install a fresh air system. I changed to a new room later, which is slightly better, but it still needs some fragrance, but it will be better once it is ventilated. It is recommended that the hotel remove the carpet under the bed to absorb dust! 
Facilities: Very convenient, there is a shuttle bus to the soup courtyard and villas 
Meals: Banyan Tree's meals are nothing to say, breakfast has local specialties, there are also Western food, rich fruits, suitable for a slow-living weekend 
Service: Banyan Tree's butler service, Xiao Chen received me, from check-in to departure, all questions are answered, calling a car or because of facility operation problems, they can respond in time! Especially because the air is not good, change the room, and because of small problems, they can be solved in time, and a Hanfu is given for taking pictures! I will find him for the next reservation! 
Hot spring: Independence and privacy are relatively good. There should be many people in winter. It is not cold or hot at present, which is just right. It is suitable for family and friends to come. The hot spring is constantly circulating

Before May Day, the housekeeper contacted us in advance to inquire about various needs. The housekeeper Xiao Chen added WeChat in advance and sent the check-in information to introduce the hotel in detail. During the two days in the hotel, there were also multiple projects to check in and experience. It was good to redeem rewards for participating in the maintenance and check-in activities. The children like the cute pet park and archery very much. There are still many projects to play, which is suitable for family travel. Archery coach Zhang Tingyu is very patient to teach children and is very professional. Finally, thank you again for the enthusiastic service of housekeeper Xiao Chen and coach Zhang Tingyu, and I will choose to stay next time.

The check-in problem was solved in time. The customer service Xiaoyi has been serving wholeheartedly during her vacation. Mr. Tao deserves praise, which reflects the consistent service concept of the hotel management from top to bottom. Compared with the Bailian I stayed in a few years ago, this stay was more like a spring breeze. Compared with the Banyan Trees in Koh Samui, Huangshan, Xixi, Bangkok, and Yangshuo, this Banyan Tree Beibei is the most impressive, and I give it a five-star rating!

The price per capita for self-service barbecue is quite high, and the child's sea cucumber porridge is given. The child had a fever in the middle. Thank you very much for the immediate feedback from the housekeeper Xiao Chen and the waiter. I also want to thank the farm manager for taking the child to touch the newborn lamb and picking loquats. It is a very special experience. In terms of hygiene, there may be few people living in the room. There is a huge spider in one room üï∑Ô∏è, which was caught by the waiter. I experienced costume shooting and was satisfied. The children's playground is a bit small, but it is enough for small children.

msg:Facilities: There is no doubt that the facilities of Banyan Tree are star-level and full of details; outdoor pavilions, swimming pools, corridors, reclining chairs and other facilities are well maintained. Our room has a bathtub, hot spring, reclining chair, balcony, and the children and lovers are very satisfied.
Hygiene: The terrace hot spring room we stayed in was very clean, including the warriors, although the room was large. The bedding was spotless, the bathroom was also large, and the aunt cleaned it very well;
Environment: The environment is the feature and signature of Banyan Tree. The most satisfying thing about this trip is the environment in the Jinyun Mountains. It happened to rain during the Qingming Festival, and it was foggy. Don't mention how great the air in the forest will be in the future. Walking along the inside of the hotel is a kind of enjoyment.
Service: The butler is 1 to 1 throughout the whole process, starting from one day in advance of check-in until leaving Chongqing, with meticulous care. Basically, we will respond to every request and provide various useful surrounding information, which will greatly help our itinerary.
Catering: I only experienced breakfast. Although the range is not particularly large, the food is delicious, combining Chinese and Western local food, rich in nutrition and excellent taste;
Finally, I would like to especially praise the support and help of Miss Chen Xiaoyi. The child coughed in the middle of the night and was sent to the hospital for hospitalization the next day. Miss Chen is familiar with the hotel business, communicates effectively and promptly, and is warm and welcoming.
This is a hotel worth visiting. Whether it is the environment, facilities, humanities, or food, it is online. I will definitely come again next time.

The hotel's environment is perfect, suitable for relaxing after staying in the city for a long time. It is very private, including a private bath in each room. However, one of the drawbacks is that the food is mediocre and there are relatively few types of dinner and breakfast. Compared with other five-star hotels, the room facilities are slightly older, but seeing that the hotel is so old, it is normal. Overall it's pretty good considering the price.

msg:Banyan Tree Beibei really exceeded my expectations. In terms of hardware, it is indeed relatively old, but the equipment is fully functional and some of it can be used. Compared with some hotels that have a lot of unusable equipment and put it there just to show off. All I can say is that Banyan Tree is in Oita!

Then the hotel‚Äôs butler service is very good. The butler upgraded the basic room type to a hot spring suite (thank you to the butler Xiao Liu). When I checked in, I had already put the hot spring water in advance, and placed what I needed according to my requirements. thing. The hot pot buffet tastes quite average, and the bottom of the pot still tastes very good. The ingredients are fresh. The only drawback is that the offal is not fresh but fried. I don‚Äôt like eating fried duck intestines (I digress). Whether it is the front desk, the housekeeper, the restaurant waiter or even the restaurant chef shuttle driver, all the staff have a strong sense of proactive service! After staying in various hotels for so many years, I can say that this is one of the best I have encountered. There was an episode when we couldn't find the shuttle bus after dining in the restaurant. We met a chef from the restaurant on the way, and the chef took us to find the shuttle bus. Breakfast was delivered to the room. There was a menu in the room, but we didn't order. The meal the hotel prepared for us tasted average, but the portion was really large. Neither of us finished it.

Banyan Tree has been in the first echelon of hotels in Chongqing for so many years. Not only does it have a unique geographical location, natural scenery and hot spring resources, but more importantly, I feel the centripetal force of the entire team and the true respect and recognition of their work. This This core of corporate culture is valuable in any service industry.

Xiao Liu's enthusiasm for treating customers has been reflected from the beginning of the reservation. That kind of attentiveness is beyond your imagination.

msg:This experience at Banyan Tree can be said to be hard to describe. The ones I have stayed in in Hangzhou before were much better than this one. Known as a world-class luxury hotel, it costs more than 3,000 yuan per night, which is indeed not great value for money. Let‚Äôs talk about the specific situation below.
Remarkable content: üëç What is worthy of praise is Butler Liu, whose service is excellent and meticulous, and can meet all the needs of customers in the first time. Knowing that it was my birthday, they specially decorated the room and gave me a birthday cake.
üëçThe hot spring room is very good, with hot water 24 hours a day. Children and the elderly can take a bath in the hot spring at any time. The feeling of being surrounded by mountains and rivers is really beautiful and comfortable.
üëçThere was a problem with the air conditioner on New Year's Eve. The workers were very enthusiastic and patient to help repair it, ensuring a safe New Year's Eve.
üëéAs a luxury hotel, the quality of the restaurants is simply outrageous. We ate at the Chinese restaurant twice in a row, and once at the hot pot buffet. We were told that we had to have a semi-buffet, and we could eat whatever was served. If there was not enough, we could add more ourselves, so we couldn‚Äôt waste it. The New Year's Eve dinner is even more difficult to describe. There are more than 1,300 people at the table, and there are many dishes. None of them are delicious. Even if you fry two dishes, they are still delicious. The only thing you can barely eat is the dessert glutinous rice balls, and the watermelon is not fresh. For Chinese New Year, come to such an expensive hotel and eat this stuff. The price is acceptable, and the service charge is acceptable. You have to taste delicious, and you have to make customers feel that the money spent is worth it. I had no choice but to order takeaway dumplings and pay for the meal. I was also drunk.
üëéThe fireworks were set off for just five minutes? Eight minutes? Is it better to put them alone, for the Chinese New Year, put them for a few more minutes, or put them in a few more, to make customers happy? Before I could react, it was over. It's better not to let it go. It is said that you should leave it for several days in a row. In fact, you might as well leave it for three days in a row. So as not to look shabby. A room costs at least 3,500 to put a few flowers. Is it so distressing?

A few slightly lacking points: There are only four bottles of water in the room as standard, unlike other Banyan Trees where water is placed in multiple locations. The same goes for tissue paper. There is only one pack, which is very inconvenient to use. Also, the room temperature was too high.

I checked before I went that there was nothing serious. I later found out that the housekeeper asked for good reviews, but the overall service was objectively good. From top to bottom, in addition to being induced to pay for an upgrade when checking in, the waiter/front desk/concierge/lobby manager all provided good service. Here‚Äôs the key point: hotel restaurants at this price range offer customized breakfasts compared to Amman. The Banyan Tree restaurant in Chongqing is the worst Banyan Tree restaurant in the world. How bad is it? It even affects my confidence in the Banyan Tree brand. Most of the breakfasts are cheap pre-made products. I took a few pictures at random. They are all about technology and hard work. I only dared to eat bowls of freshly cooked noodles. I ate two bowls of noodles in two days. It is difficult to eat in a Western restaurant. Eat, the 168 hamburger beef is the kind of popular beef patties that cost 10 or 20 yuan each. The Chinese restaurant is Sichuan cuisine. The stir-fried dishes were not warm and tasted too bad. None of the dishes were delicious. It was still an experience when we were very hungry. It has to be said that it is another skill to make Sichuan food taste so bad in this city of Chongqing. You can just ask any maid to cook it. The 328-person self-service hot pot meat and vegetables are all frozen and all are made with technology. Then the next day I had to take a taxi to eat somewhere more than ten kilometers away because the hotel area was deserted. Another complaint is that all the lights on the road in the hotel are turned off at night, and there are no night lights. What does it feel like to be in the dark wilderness. When we checked in, all rooms were fully booked. There is also a double pool room. Before checking in, I specifically called to ask whether the swimming pool is heated water and the bathing pool is hot spring. When I arrived, I was told that it was normal temperature, which is close to zero. Are you kidding me? I spent an extra 1,500 yuan just to see a pool of "normal temperature water". Fortunately, the housekeeper asked me to spend an extra 4,000 yuan to upgrade to a double pool, but he didn't agree. I have stayed in many hotels at this price in China, and I am not bragging that it is expensive. The hotel is worth a thousand yuan at most, and the breakfast is not as good as a hotel worth a few hundred yuan. I gave it a thousand yuan because it has a hot spring pool. I was deceived by non-serious negative reviews because the housekeeper would ask for good reviews. I leave this for everyone‚Äôs reference. It‚Äôs the worst New Year‚Äôs Eve. Thank you. I won‚Äôt be anonymous so I won‚Äôt be accused of being a swindler.

msg:There is a small hot spring with a courtyard. Children are very happy to soak in it.


Facilities: The room facilities are all available, and the brand of electrical appliances is worthy of my price. However, the minibar charge is a bit stingy at this price.

Hygiene: Clean and tidy. The hot springs are changed after each guest. The water had been changed when we checked in. You can take a dip directly into the room.

Service: Let‚Äôs talk about service in particular. Banyan Tree Hotel‚Äôs service awareness can be felt from the moment you drive to the parking lot. From picking up luggage, checking in to sending to the room, they were very friendly and considerate. Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiaoyi, who took the initiative to contact and add WeChat the day before check-in to inform the hotel's location, facilities, and charges, and proactively reminded me to bring my own belongings or pay. After arriving at the hotel, you will be accompanied to check in and any needs will be met one by one. He always pays attention to the needs of his guests. He doesn't go to bed until almost 12 o'clock in the evening, and proactively reminds him before breakfast in the morning. I am particularly satisfied with the butler service of this hotel. Would go again.

Meals: The buffet and breakfast were average in my opinion. The roasted lamb in the evening had a strong smell of mutton, but the fruits and desserts were okay. I will try the Chinese restaurant next time.

Even if it's as small as the weather, she does her best to remind everyone to hold the whole place and give them likes! Next is the hotel hardware introduction: the bathing area is great, the room has a separate shower room (double), a separate bathtub and a private hot spring pool on the terrace, all equipped with lying mats and aromatherapy. There are also soothing aromatherapy essential oils above the mini bar, which are free to use. The hotel's TV also has a large number of movies that you can watch for free, whether it's new movies or previous movies, it's really quite complete. The hotel's SPA also provides professional Thai massage by local Thai masseurs, which is also worth visiting! The only little regret is that the Bose Bluetooth speaker that comes with the hotel room doesn't work. I believe it's just a problem with my room and it's not a big deal, so I didn't tell the housekeeper. If I told him, he would definitely solve it for us, I believe üëç

‚Äã

The location is very good and parking is very convenient. You don't have to walk too much to get to the parking lot.

‚Äã

Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Liu for the hospitality. He took good care of our family during the 3 days and 2 nights of our stay, and was careful and efficient.

‚Äã

We originally booked an ordinary hot spring villa, but the front desk upgraded us to a double-pool hot spring villa. We were overjoyed. Although you need to take the hotel's shuttle bus every time you go back and forth between your room and the hotel lobby, which is a long way and is not very convenient, the hotel arranges the shuttle bus very efficiently and the waiting time is not long.

‚Äã

The room was very clean and well decorated. Although the weather was relatively cold, the hotel also arranged a heater for us.

‚Äã

In addition, the hot pot restaurant in the hotel is also a major feature, allowing us to experience authentic Chongqing hot pot, and the seafood is very fresh. But the food in the Chinese restaurant is so-so.

‚Äã

There are many kinds of breakfast, basically everything you need.

‚Äã

In addition, the SPA in the hotel is very authentic and the technicians are very skilled. It is a good place to relieve fatigue.

‚Äã

All in all, I had an excellent stay experience this time. If I have the opportunity to visit Chongqing again next time, I will still choose Banyan Tree.

I don't recommend it at all
The hotel is too old and everything is broken
My friend and I booked two rooms
My friend's private bath temperature and other facilities were broken, so we asked them to change rooms
There was no room upgrade, just a fruit and an apology
We let it go
At night, at 3 a.m. in my own room, there was a bang on the roof. It turned out that some water pipe was broken... The master came to repair it in the middle of the night... I didn't sleep well at all... This is a waste of money
The hotel almost has no public bath. The public bath looks like a toilet cubicle...
The zoo is also very bad... There are üêî running in it, as well as sheep and alpacas
The free Hanfu experience is basically equivalent to nothing, and you need to pay
The hotel did not remind me of the food charges in the room
I opened one, and the housekeeper said it was waived for me. In the end, I was still charged when I settled the bill
When I left, there were many people checking out, so they opened a counter and couldn't receive them at all. I waited for a long time
I have never had such a bad check-in experience! I don't recommend it, don't recommend it, don't recommend it!!! It's so expensive. I don't know why it's so expensive.
The housekeeper even had the nerve to ask me to write a good review for him. Maybe there's a reward for good reviews? Haha. . We encountered so many problems and the housekeeper never showed up...

After two days, We met many times during this period, and the warm smiles and loud and enthusiastic nods to say hello seemed to represent the enthusiasm of all the people we met in the hotel! In the end, Yin Kangchi, who checked out and picked up the luggage together, patiently accompanied us to check out and purchase exquisite products with our luggage in hand. Of course, there was also the ever-unfailing butler Leo Liu Juncan backstage. The personal recommendations for surrounding food were still very practical and considerate. I must give it a thumbs up! The English greetings and techniques of the Thai technicians at Yuerong Spa who work overtime are still professional even at midnight! My suggestion is whether the terrace hot spring pool can have scenery control. Turning it off when no one is around will not attract insects. After all, mosquito and moth corpses floating in the water in the morning will give people goosebumps!

msg:I stayed at the Banyan Tree over the weekend. Before check-in, the housekeeper Xiao Yi contacted me in advance. After learning that we were bringing children, he took the initiative to help us upgrade to a terrace room type and introduced in detail the hotel's activities, meals, rooms, and surrounding areas. Dining and tourist attractions. He took the initiative to greet us when we arrived, and personally took us to the cute pet paradise and vegetable garden the next day. The service was very warm and considerate, and the reply to messages was very timely. It can be said that everything was taken care of, making people feel like spring breeze.
        Let‚Äôs talk about the hotel. The hotel rooms are very large and have separate swimming pools, which is very convenient. And opposite is Jinyun Mountain, with beautiful scenery, fresh air, good sound insulation, and very quiet at night. The air-conditioning in the room is very sufficient, even in summer it is a bit cold (later I learned that I can contact the housekeeper to adjust the temperature).
        Special praise should be given to the hotel's cute pet paradise. Except for sika deer and alpacas, all other animals are free-range. I have been to many similar pet parks and the smell is basically very strong, but the one at Banyan Tree is very clean and there is almost no unpleasant smell. The management uncle was very enthusiastic and brought out a lot of carrots for us to feed without any charge. There are many vegetables to pick in the vegetable garden. They are all in season and very fresh.
        The disadvantage is that the hotel's breakfast restaurant is relatively small, there are not many varieties, and the taste is not particularly amazing. The Cantonese roasted pork rice given in the Chinese restaurant was not good, but the pickled radish inside was very delicious. There is also a public pool outside the hotel that is relatively small and may be crowded if it is peak season.
        Finally, it is suggested that the hotel can add some indoor and outdoor facilities for children to play. After observation, although it is the off-season, there are still more people bringing children to play.

The overall scenery of the Banyan Tree is very quiet and beautiful. Sitting quietly on the sofa in the balcony of the room, you can listen to cicadas in summer, admire the moon in autumn, and be surrounded by green mountains. Occasionally, a group of restless big white geese passed by the corner of the building, which really added a bit of fun to the small farmyard.
Room facilities:
Each room has a large bathtub and open-air hot spring, and the daily necessities are thoughtfully divided into men's and women's toiletry bags, which is very thoughtful.
Serve:
The hotel has a butler service. The butler Xiaoyi's service is very warm and patient. He helped me solve the problem of forgetting to bring makeup remover. He also accompanied me all the way and helped me take a lot of beautiful photos! The archery range and small animal park in the hotel are very interesting. The alpacas and sika deer are really cute.

It's the off-season now, and the occupancy rate may be less than 1/3, so it's really hard to touch anyone, and the vacation is very comfortable~

The disadvantage is that the decoration is relatively old, the bathroom faucet is even a little rusty, and the switch is not very flexible. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the rice noodles are delicious. The dumbbells at the gym aren't very ergonomic, but that doesn't matter.

The price of 2000 is still quite high, but it can still be used as a good place to escape the summer heat in the mountains~

I immediately sent WeChat to Xiao Liu to adjust the water temperature, and the arrangements were made quickly.

Facilities: The room equipment should be updated, the hair dryer is a bit worn out. The toiletries are not individually packaged, and they smell good, but the conditioner is really hard to use for long hair, and the body lotion smells good but can't be taken away. Praise the air cushion comb, it is quite special.

The Cute Pet Paradise is also a favorite of children. Although it is not big, it is enough for children to have fun. The staff member "Uncle Zhang" (it seems to be called that by the housekeeper) also warmly prepared carrots for feeding for us. Although the children were a little scared, they still had fun playing. You can also pet the goats.

When I checked out, there was an elderly man at the door When the bellman saw us dragging our luggage, he trotted over to pick up the luggage, which was touching. The housekeeper, Wang Xiaoer, also served well from beginning to end.
The facilities in the room, whether it is the B&O TV or the smart toilet, are very high-end, and the space and hot spring pool are also large enough. Of course, because the valley is relatively hot and humid, there will inevitably be some musty smell when the occupancy rate is low. It is recommended to prepare more incense and essential oils in the room in the future. In addition, in the off-season, some public spaces in the hotel are not open, and the lights are relatively dim, including the swimming pool. Although it is open normally, the overall a**osphere is not bright enough, and the hanging curtains on the upper part also feel oppressive.
The hotel is positioned as a hidden place, but on the one hand, it seems to be too secluded, the vegetation is so lush that it is a bit messy, and it looks like it is in a wild ridge; on the other hand, it is not enough to hide from the world. There are also unfinished buildings of other real estate projects outside the hotel, which destroys the perception and reduces the privacy.

I really want to give a 5-star praise. The hot spring in the hotel room is also super good. I take a bath every day. Yes, relieve the fatigue of the day, and sleep comfortably at night, and the hotel's beds and quilts are also super comfortable. Facing the invincible mountain scenery every day, I feel like I have entered a forest oxygen bar... I will come again next time

msg:Choose to spend this weekend at Banyan Tree. I thought there would be a lot of people, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be quite quiet. The hotel environment is very goodüè°. When I checked in, the chief housekeeper, Xiao Yi, added WeChat, introduced the relevant information of the hotel in detail, and also recommended some hotel activities. On the morning of the second day, under her recommendation, I experienced the "floating" in the recuperation activity. She also led us to experience vegetable picking. We picked pumpkins, corn üåΩ and small tomatoes üçÖ, which was really healthy. The most worth mentioning is that we also saw peacocks opening their tails. Breeder Liu Weiwei said that peacocks will open their tails when they see beautiful women in skirts~ I am so lucky! We also experienced archery. Zhang Tingyu, a staff member of the archery field, also guided us to archery very seriously. It was very good~ It is a pity that we did not experience Baduanjin. We will stay for two more days next time to experience more recuperating activities. Banyan Tree is a very humane place, and the service is very good! Next time I have a chance, I will bring my family and friends to the hot springs, listen to the cicadas and frogs, and calm down in the busy life, let time slow down and enjoy the pleasant time...

The chief housekeeper of the hotel, Xiao Yi, is really enthusiastic. I feel a little embarrassed. I wake up before going to bed. Her information ü§™ is very considerate. As for the hotel, I read the reviews. It is an old hotel. It has been in business for about ten years. Some places in it really feel, one is the bathroom, which is a bit old, and the other is the hot spring. The hot spring on the balcony of the room looks like Like old wine, you need to go in and taste it, and then there will be a smell of urine, so that you dare not go in again after soaking it once. It needs to be strengthened here, because it is your specialty. I think there are curtains on the balcony to prevent mosquitoes. The situation is acceptable, close contact with ecology is definitely to accept its beauty and not beauty, the hotel breakfast is really delicious, and the time is also very üâëÔ∏è, directly until 10:30, the welfare of those who like to sleep late, this time I did not go to see animals And archery, because it is the 318 return trip, I will come again next time I have a chance, this is a good place for vacation. In addition, the takeaway is a bit far away, if you go out to eat by car, you will have more choices.

On the morning of the day of check-in, the front desk of the hotel called to inquire about the check-in information, and pushed the hotel's "one-on-one" service butler. Here, I would like to thank my butler - Kaikai, although he is very busy + I compare the itinerary Slow, we didn't meet each other, but I asked him to help coordinate various service reservations and entertainment arrangements in the hotel through WeChat, which suddenly made my convenience in the hotel a lot.

The hotel's small hot pot, Chinese restaurant, and Western restaurant taste really good, definitely exceeding expectations.

The hotel's Spa is definitely value for money, worthy of being the best in the hotel industry!

Other entertainment items like archery and pet park are also very enjoyable! !

1. The Yue Rong Zhuang where I stayed was the hotel where the butler did not show up on the day of my first check-in. Was told the butler didn't come to work until 2pm. During this period, no one asked about meal arrangements and others.
2. There are almost no bright spots in the breakfast. The service staff have nothing but to ask for the additional children's breakfast to be signed. No one poured the coffee, and no one served the whole time.
3. There is no one to help with luggage when you check in, and there is no one to help you with luggage when you leave. The two security guards at the gate or the service staff saw it and pretended not to see it. It is unimaginable that it is the service of Yuerongzhuang. The price of more than 4,000 feels economical hotel.
4. The facilities are quite old, with a musty smell.
5. Dinner is in the open air of the Chinese restaurant, and there are mosquitoes. There is no active mosquito repellent equipment, and the guest asks for mosquito repellent water.
6. There are parent-child activities and a small animal pet garden. I saw snakes on the way back. It was the first time I saw a snake when I was so old. It was quite scary. Go back to the room quickly, no other mood at this time.
7. I stayed in Chongqing for 3 nights. I stayed at Niccolo for the first two nights. At the same price, there is no harm if there is no comparison. one.

This is the first May Day holiday after the epidemic, and there are still no crowds and no pain of holiday travel. This time is a family trip, and a family of friends. Butler service has been added. Our chief housekeeper, Xiaoyi Meimei, took the initiative to contact us by phone and WeChat before departure, and made considerate arrangements. On the first day of check-in, due to the flight delay of five hours, Xiao Yi was always concerned about the departure and arrival situation, and it was already 8:30 in the evening. Meals end at 9:00. Tired and hungry after a whole day at the airport, Xiao Yi Meimei quickly arranged a barbecue buffet. With Xiaoyi's help and coordination, the restaurant supervisor, Ren Yong, saw that we arrived too late, and was afraid that we would think that spending money on meals was not cost-effective, so he tried to arrange more food for us, and even waived the fee for a primary school student. Let us feel warm when we arrived in twists and turns. The BBQ buffet is really good if we can get there early. During the stay, the WeChat service has never stopped. All kinds of activities, room hot springs and other questions are answered immediately, and the staff will appear immediately. Such a comfortable and leisurely way is the correct way to start a vacation. At the time of parting, Xiaoyi, the housekeeper and beauty, also prepared a souvenir, which was a very strong experience. focus. Every household has its own soup, and the Banyan Tree brand is worth visiting again and again. üòÅ

Before arriving at the hotel, a professional butler of the hotel contacted us about the location we wanted to live in, such as a quieter or more private place. In short, the butlers have considered the places we didn‚Äôt consider. When the butler learned that I have two In the end, kid, I upgraded the room type for us for free. I would like to thank Sunny for this point. When staying in the hotel, if you need anything, you can contact the butler directly on WeChat. It is convenient and efficient! After arriving at the hotel, we were very satisfied with the environment. After all, it was developed by Banyan Tree Group, and the software and hardware are all in place. Then there is the hotel's buffet at night. Although the price is really good, there is a reason why it is expensive. The taste is quite good, and there are many types: seafood, barbecue, and Chinese food. If you still want to eat hot pot, you can also choose hot pot. Children can also go to the Cute Pet Paradise, and adults can also try shooting, which is very good. If you travel in the hotel, you will be picked up by a sightseeing car, and you only need a phone call to contact the front desk.

msg:I was promoted to the soup house for free, which was an unexpected surprise.
Call in advance to ask if you have other needs.
Independent 24-hour open-air hot spring soup pool, because the place where you live is on the pond, there are inevitably some mosquitoes. The temperature is relatively high, and it is required to lower the temperature when soaking at night. In fact, the body still feels slightly hot the next day after soaking. When soaking in the soup, you can hear ducks screaming in your ears, which is quite idyllic.
The room is the theme of recuperation. Aromatherapy, incense, calming music, and yoga equipment are all available. There are also copybooks for calligraphy practice. Capsule coffee is slightly sour than what I usually drink.
The big bed is more than enough for two big people and one small sleep. The children's feet are already about the same size as adults, so they took an extra pair of adult slippers. The children's toothbrush is an Ultraman theme, which is quite interesting.
After ordering a set meal, I watched the animals. The baby goat, which was just born ten days old, was very cute and even bit the corner of our clothes. The alpaca ü¶ô huddled in the room without much interaction. Children like archery very much. The package includes 5 arrows, and if you add more, you need to pay extra, 50 yuan for 10 arrows.
There are quite a lot of choices for breakfast, and the taste is okay, but the noodles are not very tasty. There are more western pastries.
There is nothing to eat around the hotel. If you don't drive, you can only eat in the hotel. If you take a train, it is not far from Beibei City.
Overall it was a satisfying experience.

Although the room is a bit old, the facilities are good, especially the sun terrace and pool feel very good. The overall feeling of the hotel is like a small village, hidden in the mountains and rivers. The only complaint is that the outdoor public bathing pool at night is too dimly lit, and the pool is too deep. If you are not careful, you may sprain yourself. I hope it can be improved.

I arrived after two o'clock in the afternoon, and I checked in directly after the room was packed.
The weather was good this time, and the sun was more comfortable than the rain. All rooms with courtyards have saunas.
Breakfast is still ok, and it is recommended to order takeaway for dinner. The snacks in the mini bar in the room are relatively expensive, such as 38 cans of Coke. If it is convenient, bring your own snacks and drinks. There are 6 bottles of drinking water, tea bags and a few fruits. It is true that the fruits are not as good and rich as before.
I didn't go to Mengpet Paradise this time. It's still good to walk to have breakfast and see other scenery.

msg:There are too many slots, very poor, very backward. Please note that the price of this hotel is very high. If you want to experience the service and hardware that match the price, don't choose it. There is nothing wrong with doing something with this money. I have suffered losses at Banyan Tree twice, but I have no memory. ‚ùóÔ∏èPoor service‚ùóÔ∏èPoor hardware‚ùóÔ∏èPoor sanitation‚ùóÔ∏è
1‚É£Ô∏èThe service management is completely at the level of an unknown hotel in a small place. No matter what question you ask, all the service staff will first shift the responsibility to the customer, it is "you are using the wrong method", if you want to do this or that, such as the light flashing, you will say that you need to turn off the main switch and then turn it on again, I am a customer, Not a waiter. Or just mechanically upgrade the room type for you. Does the upgraded room type ensure that the air conditioner works well? My appeal is to be warm, not to change to a bigger and colder room. At this temperature, if the indoor temperature of the hot spring hotel does not meet the standard, shouldn‚Äôt you make preparations in advance? Obviously, the problem can be solved by the electric heater, but it‚Äôs only when the guests ask for it. coming. Even hotels in Hainan will prepare electric heaters in each room in advance in winter, hotels in Chongqing can't imagine this, it's too bad.
2‚É£Ô∏èThere is something wrong with the induction of the air conditioner. People who go out in winter will use the lowest gear. With such a high price, I don‚Äôt plan to pay for this electricity bill. When checking in, I repeatedly emphasized that the air conditioner is working well. The bald man at the front desk said that the air conditioner is independent, and he didn't answer the question completely. If you have the energy to save electricity, it is better to block the door cracks and let the air leak everywhere. The hotel wants to pretend to be high-end, pretending to be environmentally friendly, and all toiletries are refillable, then give the money to the customer, don't take advantage of yourself and act like a good boy.
3‚É£Ô∏èThe sanitation is very poor, there are black spots in the water cup, and there is dust under the toilet seat when it is lifted up, it is disgusting.
4‚É£Ô∏èThe curtains in the bathroom still have moldy ideas.
5‚É£Ô∏èThe interior decoration of the soup house is confusing. The end stool in the bedroom knocks your legs every time, it is better to remove the plug door.
A small episode, a guest accidentally broke a spoon at breakfast. Although there is nothing wrong with charging money, it is very uncomfortable to deliberately register the room number and ask for compensation. It is very stingy for a high-end hotel, and such a small amount of a few dollars will not be missed.

First of all, the hotel itself is a hot spring-themed hotel. At first, he hesitated between Bolian and Banyan Tree and finally decided to stay in Banyan Tree. Then let‚Äôs talk about this hot spring. The spring water has no peculiar smell and can clear away fatigue after soaking. People travel, especially after getting up in the morning and taking a bath in the hot spring pool, it is very comfortable. In addition, the bedding is also very clean and comfortable, and the mattress is also very suitable for me.
    Other facilities of the hotel, there is a western restaurant and a Chinese restaurant. The taste is very good and very fresh. The tomahawk steak is very good. I ordered both meals. In addition, there is a small zoo in the hotel, which is also very suitable for children (although it is not big)
   This trip is very grateful to the hotel for its warm service (every service staff).

msg:I came to the famous Chongqing North Hot Spring to take a bath during the New Year‚Äôs Day holiday, and finally chose Banyan Tree. The biggest surprise was the hot spring pool, which was very wide for two people, and it was actually at a constant temperature, so there was no need to manually adjust the water volume and temperature! The hotel's breakfast and gym are also very good, and Kai Kai's housekeeper also helped to delay check-out until 2 o'clock. Next time I have a chance to stay again.

msg:The service in this hotel is okay, but overall it's still far from an international five-star rating. Many of the waiters are polite on the surface, but are actually very evasive and unwilling to take the initiative. I have a one-year-old child with me who is worried about falling out of bed. I asked if I can share a bed. I turned around and left immediately. I was left there by myself for a long time doing manual labor. I called the front desk and asked if I needed to make an appoin**ent for archery and animal feeding. The answer was that I didn‚Äôt need to. I asked where and he said it was just in the hotel. The phone hung up... The Chris**as dinner buffet was 698 per person, but the dishes were rarely fresh, the seafood was even less, and the variety of drinks was also very small. Two people spent almost 1,400 and got more than 100 per person. Self-service level, the Festival Hotel does not have any program arrangements. To be honest, I don‚Äôt know whether it is the overall level of Chongqing or the problem of this hotel. The value of all aspects of this accommodation would be about 1,500 in other cities, but I spent twice as much and still got it. Many, so very confused. As for the hot springs, the special feature is that there are private hot springs in the room. This is the entry standard in five-star hot spring hotels. It can be seen from the sanitation and facilities that there are not many people there usually, and many corners are not cleaned enough.

Facilities: During this period of time, Beibei's epidemic situation was more serious. The public soup pool in the hotel was closed, but each room had private soup. The privacy was very good. I booked a terrace king-size room, and started the lying-flat vacation mode with my mother‚ô®Ô∏èIn-hotel facilities The entertainment is very rich, swimming, fitness, yoga, Tai Chi, archery, everything! I even got an alpaca! ! ! I really like the living conditions of various animals in the hotel, coexisting with nature~

Service: The hotel is super big, leaning on Jinyun Mountain. When I came here for the first time, I said what to do if I got lost in the hotel. I only shouted hahahahaha. As a result, each room has its own housekeeper. After adding WeChat to the housekeeper, you can follow up online at any time.

I upgraded it to a villa room, but the single pool room I was assigned at the beginning had a small pool, and the water in the pool was cold when I entered it, so I changed it to a double pool. The room, which has a hot spring pool and a swimming pool, is also relatively large, and it's okay. I felt sincerity. The breakfast is delivered to the room, probably because the restaurant is closed, there are many varieties and the quality is average.

I went there the night before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Because there were not many guests staying in the hotel, I just said that there was no choice for breakfast. I would cook some for you and send it to the room. Moreover, the room booked was different from the actual room, and they were not informed in advance when I contacted them. I didn't know there was a butler until the second time I stayed there. I contacted and added WeChat after Ctrip requested it. The butler was super slow to reply to messages. Because there were so few people, there was not even the most basic reception at the door. It was because I was familiar with the hotel that I could not find the front desk. The next day there were more people, and I was told that we could go to the restaurant for breakfast in the morning. I was really convinced. I went for a run in the morning and found that many places were dilapidated. I really don't know why your hotel's service is so bad.

msg:Find a place to relax on weekends, it is more suitable to go to a hot spring hotel in this weather. The hot spring soup pool room we booked has been upgraded to a villa area, a separate courtyard, which is very quiet. It can be seen that the park has been carefully designed and has the feeling of a Chinese courtyard. Each courtyard has a flower tree, or magnolia, or purple leaf plum, or camellia. I believe that different seasons have different landscapes. There is an independent private soup pool in the small courtyard, and the water temperature is maintained 24 hours a day, which is really intimate and can be soaked at any time.
The room is huge, the bathroom is also huge, and the room is kept at a comfortable temperature at all times. The brands of facilities are also good, and the layout of the rooms is also very thoughtful. Three sofa chairs are distributed in the terrace, living room, bedroom, and can be reclined anywhere.
The terrace is my favorite. It is very pleasant to burn an incense on the terrace, drink tea, read a book, and brush your mobile phone.
Personal supplies are relatively complete, but the quality is uneven. I hope the hotel manager can try these products for themselves. The toothpaste is too inferior, and some cannot be squeezed out. The bathroom has the smell of sewer, and it will float into the room, affecting the experience.
There are capsule coffee machines, bose bluetooth speakers, B&O TVs, TOTO bathrooms in the room, all of which are branded products, but I don't know where the TV set is wrong.
Towels, bath towels and bathrobes are very comfortable, the mattress is too soft, I feel that the waist lacks support, and the waist feels a bit difficult to sleep at night.
The buffet breakfast is compact, rich in western style, not much in Chinese style, there are more varieties of western style cheese, bread is also good, all kinds of sausage, bacon, ham, smoked salmon are all good, Chinese style freshly cooked The miscellaneous sauce noodles taste good.
I ate dinner at a Chinese restaurant and the serving was too slow.
The whole park can be taken for a walk, and the environment is very good, but some garden vegetation is neglected.
The overall service is very good, the attitude is very good, responsive, take the initiative to greet and say hello.

Restaurant: I chose the self-service hot pot. I only went there at 7:00 pm. The service was very good. At 8.30, there were only two of us. The service staff did not urge, and comforted: I usually get off work at 9.30, let me eat slowly, waiter‚ûï The chef didn't get off work until we finished our meal after 9 o'clock, and the attitude has been very good!

The uncle of the cute pet tribe is very enthusiastic and even gave me some carrots. Besides the alpaca, there is also a little goat that looks like ErhaüòÄ, bites your trousers and bites your shoelaces üòÇ!
The overall score is full. I have always liked the landmark hotel in the city, and I will choose Banyan Tree more in the future!

First, I originally booked four rooms. One of our friends couldn't go with a cold the day before check-in. The hotel checked out very happily, although the Ctrip page showed that it could not be refunded or changed. Ctrip's customer service here is also more powerful.
Second, the butler service is very distinctive. On the day of check-in, there will be a butler plus WeChat, pay attention to your arrival time, the front desk assists with check-in, and actively upgrades to three adjacent rooms in the villa area. Then arrange dinner, electric car pick-up, take care of breakfast, take the initiative to help with late check-out, until delivery, give a souvenir, and ask if you have arrived at the station, and reply to WeChat in seconds. In short, I feel that the service exceeds expectations at any time without excessive service. Our housekeeper Zhang Huimin is good. In terms of service, it is much better than Liufan, Hanbi Building and Diaoyutai.
The third is the hotel hardware. The garden landscape is quite layered. The weather is good today, and the film is also very good. The villa area has a separate door and courtyard, with good privacy. The small suite includes private soup on the balcony of the living room, bedroom, wash area, and balcony. The private soup in the room is very comfortable, the bed is very soft, it is very quiet at night, the bathroom can be steamed, and the double wash basin is still relatively high.
In short, it is very suitable for family vacations and leisure gatherings with friends. I will come again next time.

msg:Ctrip bookings are paid at the store, and a deposit must be paid together after arriving at the store. After all, in addition to fruit and mineral water in the room, all other charges will be charged üòè. The hot spring pool in the room is very good. It can be heated at any time by heating. The TV can be rotated 90 degrees, and you can watch TV even when you are in the hot spring. The structure and equipment of the whole room are very good, the only thing is that the sound insulation of the corridor is poor. The little brother of the shuttle bus has a very warm attitude. We ordered food by phone and delivered it to the room. We charged a 10% service charge and 6% tax. We asked the waiter and the front desk tax and the answer was vague and I didn‚Äôt understand it. Anyway, it was delivered to the room. This fee is charged for eating in restaurants. The breakfast buffet is rich in variety, and the service is thoughtful and timely. Still very suitable for family outings.

msg:I chose Banyan Tree Beibei with my colleagues in Chongqing on the last day, mainly to experience the famous Beibei Hot Spring and Banyan Tree Spa in Chongqing. First of all, the hotel has a unique location. It is located near the Jialing River in the famous Beibei Shili Hot Spring City. It is very close to Beibei Hot Spring and Jinyun Mountain. The decoration of the hotel is traditional The Chinese-style courtyards and villas are very distinctive and recognizable. As a top international resort hotel brand, Banyan Tree Chongqing‚Äôs service is also very good. The housekeeper Kylin Yang Qilin calls and WeChat in advance to check the customer‚Äôs arrival time and arrange the room in advance, understand the customer‚Äôs needs and preferences, and give a detailed introduction after check-in Hotel and room facilities and precautions, the surrounding fun and delicious places, can be meticulous! Finally, the private soup in the hotel room is the most characteristic automatic water circulation hot spring pool, which can keep the temperature of the hot spring water all the time, so you can get up early in the morning to soak in the hot spring, and then go to the airport to catch a flight! In conclusion, the location, service and facilities of the hotel meet the standards of top resort hotels! Recommended!

I have specially set the environment and I still have nothing to say. The smiling service of the staff is in place, and the butler Xiao Tan is also online 24 hours a day. The private hot spring is very comfortable, the breakfast is also very good, and the anniversary cake was sent, so I didn't go to the main meal.
However, I personally think that the price of a single night is so expensive, and some small details are suggested to be adjusted: the quality of drinking water, it is better to replace the snacks in the room with free ones~ It‚Äôs a big deal.
The private soup hot spring is really comfortable. My favorite is the simple comb in the wash bag, which is worthy of the quality of Banyan Tree. I took it away with the consent of the little housekeeper. Haha. The alpaca was clean and I touched it, and thanked my husband for giving me extravagance on the anniversary üòÉ

msg:I haven‚Äôt been in Chongqing for a long time. I heard from friends in the media that Chongqing is rich in hot spring resources, so I did some research and finally chose Banyan Tree. Based on years of experience in staying in hotels, it is more reliable to choose one from a large group.
In Nanjing, I often go to Tangshan hot springs in winter. Since I only go to private hot springs, I have tried all kinds of private hot springs. The overall experience at Banyan Tree is quite good. I chose to go there on Chris**as Day, and the details and a**osphere are great.

üöó Transportation: Self-driving, the road is easier to walk and not difficult to find.
üßπHygiene: I only stayed for one night and did not experience any changes. There were no problems on the day.
üçÉEnvironment: It is relatively quiet, with many trees and distant views. Because there are many children, it is noisy in the yard and corridors.
üîîService: In line with the brand level, there is no big problem.
üç§Catering: I had the Chris**as buffet dinner and breakfast. The quality of the dinner was uneven. It is really not a good choice to eat seafood in Chongqing. The quality of the seafood was average, nearly 600 per person, and there was a BBQ. Overall, it was average. The breakfast is a very standard star-rated breakfast, with no merit and no fault, it is passable.

Overall, there is nothing wrong with going here for the purpose of soaking in hot springs.

Location traffic:
Super remote, more than 30 kilometers away from the airport ‚úàÔ∏è, more than 50 kilometers away from the high-speed railway station üöÑ, but the environment is really good, except for a few unfinished buildings next to it that affect the senses, the others are really great.

service:
The attitude is not bad, but the level may be improved a little bit~

Room view:
Surrounded by woods, it really feels like a tree house, very comfortable and private.

swimming pool:
The room comes with a swimming pool, which is not too big; there is also a small hot spring, which can sit four people at a time. It is super comfortable, and there is a breeze in the evening, listening to the sound of the water, soaking in the hot spring ‚ô®Ô∏è, too moist~

health:
The sanitary conditions are OK, and the details are mediocre.

Dinning room:
The environment is OK, and the dishes taste so-so.

breakfast:
It is not rich, and there are not many types; the taste of Chongqing noodles is not bad; the eggs benedict are very average, and they are basically fully cooked.

wifi:
The link is unstable and the speed is not fast.

bed:
It is very large and soft, with good support, and the bedding is very skin-friendly and comfortable.

Room facilities:
TOTO electric toilet, not easy ~ two bathrooms, both with showers, which are quite convenient; the living room is large and comfortable; the desk in the room has a power supply, which is very good; there is no separate cloakroom, only luggage Throw it on the ground; the big bathtub in the bathroom, the classic round bathtub of Banyan Tree, is very comfortable.

Cost performance:
During November, it was more than 7000 a night, it was still a bit expensive, and the minibar was not free, it was a little bit tricky.

First of all, the room was unremarkable, with a small hole in the bed sheets, only two sets of towels and bath towels, flip flops too heavy to rub feet; too few types of breakfast, only small noodles are still unique, hot dishes and baking look complete No appetite; the most speechless thing is that there are many activities in the hotel during the National Day on the leaflet of the room, such as garden parties, guqin lessons, archery, cute pet paradise, etc., which seem to be very rich, in fact, the operation is very perfunctory. At the end of the garden party on the 5th, it was not stated on the leaflet. The apology from the front desk was insincere. The Guqin class was a brief talk by a staff member for half an hour. Archery was a small venue with a few bows and arrows, and each arrow was collected. It costs 5 yuan, and the shops and lobby bars are closed at every turn. There is nothing to play in the entire hotel. . This level can't be more than 2k, three points are given to this environment, it is enough to live for one day

Especially the carpet, it is better to replace it, the old imprint looks very disgusting. The scenery is still good, but not much change. Still prefer Bailian.

msg:In the hotel in Chongqing, I have been admiring the name for a long time and finally went to ****ing, but there are not too many surprises. The car navigated directly to the parking lot. After arriving, there was no reception or guidance by any service staff. I followed the guidance and found the lobby from the side door. The lobby was not very stylish either. A welcome tea was given to us when we checked in. I felt that the younger sister had no experience and put it directly on the side of the not-so-rich reception desk. We were still standing, let People feel very embarrassed. The beauties who checked in at the front desk were still very enthusiastic. When we arrived, it was more than 4 o'clock, but we were told that the room was not taken care of, and we still need to wait üòÇ, a bit speechless, and then said that there is a half-price activity for adding money to a villa suite, so We added 600 liters to a villa courtyard. After checking in, there is a special electric frequency car to pick you up in the villa area, and the driving master is also very enthusiastic. That is, Trump from Chongqing is indeed a little jumpy. When I enter the small courtyard, I still feel very tall. I enter the small courtyard, living room, and bedroom. , Wash room, toilet, steam shower room, special large balcony soaking pool, hot spring water is prepared in advance, the first thing after check-in is to enter the water! That's so cool! The environment is really great, the mountains and rivers are beautiful, the Chinese decoration style is matched with the natural garden style, which makes people feel like living in the natural landscape. Cozy and cozy, but many places also feel that there is a lot of room for improvement. After all, more than 3,000 one night accommodation in Chongqing is considered very high-end. The bath towel beside the pool on the balcony feels a bit dirty. There is a spider web and the body of a small spider in the middle of the bedroom. Some flowers and plants in the courtyard are very withered. After walking around the villa area, the flowers and trees still feel Owed. When I went to bed at night, I found a big spider on the door. It is indeed a natural ecology. How do you say the hotel‚Äôs buffet barbecue dinner, more than 300, the variety is not small, but many barbecue dishes are not very fresh, and the seafood is also It's not very big. Of course, the stock of ingredients cannot be too few, and the daily shipment is not too much, so the freshness cannot be compared with the special cafeteria outside, but the barbecue taste does have a lot of room for improvement. The breakfast is ok, better than the dinner buffet, especially the rice noodles and small noodles. The attitude of the service staff is very good, but there is always a feeling of lack of professionalism, almost energetic, haha, just a very objective comment, I hope to do better!

msg:It takes about an hour to reach the hotel from Chongqing city. Upon reaching the hotel, the concierge enthusiastically helped us pick up our luggage. The hotel environment is very good, it is a paradise, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The check-in at the front desk was very fast. This time I paid a special fee to upgrade and experienced a better room type. I was not disappointed. Thank you Vicky for preparing and arranging in advance. The breakfast is quite rich. The Chongqing noodles are authentic and delicious. The chef also came to inquire about the taste. This is very good. Although I only stayed for one day, I am a little reluctant to go back. For a holiday in Chongqing, Banyan Tree is definitely the first choice! !

Although the weather is hot, you can still soak in hot springs in the morning and evening. The hotel has arranged many activities, such as Baduan Brocade, recycled paper making, archery, cute pet paradise...you can relax while on vacation. It is worth mentioning that their butler service is meticulous. The butler Alinda Xiao Chen has provided us with a lot of help. The noodles or rice noodles for breakfast are also deliciousüòã

Fortunately, in the lobby, Peter introduced me to me in detail, otherwise I really couldn't find the direction. I think the most peculiar thing about this hotel is that it is in the middle of the mountain. There are no mosquitoes on the road in his lobby room!

Of course, mosquitoes and the like are inevitable, but the measures in the room are sufficient to deal with these problems. The room facilities are well maintained. The specifications of the 7-piece bathroom set are worthy of the value of this hotel. The service is also very user-friendly. The details are paid attention to, which raises the overall experience level. The breakfast is quite satisfactory. Although it is not very large, it has a complete range. There is a petting zoo for a walk after the meal. There are not many types but it is very exquisite. It is a recommended leisure place

The facilities are indeed a bit old, the switches are not easy to use, the air conditioner is not easy to control, and it is always turned on by itself. Nausea in the bathroom is quite serious. The hair dryer socket does not work well. Shampoo and shower gel are still shared, not individually packaged. The privacy of the bath is not strong, there is a camera facing it, passers-by can also see it, there are too many bugs, N large bags have been attacked, and there may be bedding. Some bags are not mosquito bites, so you should stay cautiously.

The Thai floating afternoon tea is very suitable for those who don‚Äôt like sweets so much. The grilled shrimps and chicken skewers are very good. , And fresh coconut green, the portion is super generous. Enjoying the mountain breeze while watching the scenery while chatting and drinking afternoon tea in the room is a worthwhile trip.
