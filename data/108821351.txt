msg:When I initially reserved a room at this hotel apartment, I planned to stay just one day before relocating to another serviced apartment. Yet, the exceptional comfort, pristine cleanliness, and comprehensive modern amenities persuaded me to extend my stay to a full two weeks.

Upon arrival, I encountered a hiccup that nearly drove me to seek accommodations elsewhere, but the issue was swiftly and adeptly handled by a courteous gentleman at the front desk, likely the manager. His prompt resolution and eagerness to address my concerns not only resolved the immediate issue but also instilled a deep sense of trust and satisfaction with my stay.

The hotel itself is located in a quiet area, a rarity in this country's largest and busiest city. Despite its peaceful setting, it is conveniently close to Metro Line 11, ensuring easy access to the city’s vibrant heart. The option to open the windows in my room was a breath of fresh air—literally. It allowed me to enjoy the fresh breeze without leaving the comfort of my well-appointed room.

Speaking of the room, it was a perfect blend of luxury and practicality. The cleanliness was up to the high standard, and it felt like the facility was brand new. The room was equipped with a small kitchen area, complete with a stove, rice cooker, refrigerator, and even a washer. Although there was no dryer in the room, a quick trip to the second floor opened up options not only to dry clothes but also to access private dining/meeting rooms and a well-equipped gym.

Every night was a peaceful retreat. The bed was incredibly comfortable, rivaling the peace of my own home. The tranquil environment contributed to undisturbed nights, ensuring restful sleep and rejuvenated mornings.

The housekeeping staff, particularly two young men, were notably diligent and affable, keeping my room clean and well-supplied. The front desk staff were equally helpful, always ready to assist with any request. Assistance was dispatched via a charming, albeit slower, robot—no tipping required.

This hotel apartment not only met but exceeded my expectations, making it a top recommendation for anyone seeking a 'home away from home.' For those considering a longer stay, here's a tip: contact the hotel directly to speak with a salesperson. You might secure an excellent long-term rate, potentially including breakfast.

msg:Accompanying my parents on this trip, it was very unpleasant! Before checking in, I contacted the hotel specifically to request to check in on the same floor, and Ctrip replied that it had been arranged. When I checked in, I found that it was not the case at all. I was arranged on two floors and had to swipe my card to enter and exit, which made it difficult to take care of the elderly. After checking in, I found that there was lumps of pet excrement in the middle of the sofa (pictured), which was very disgusting! It smelled very bad and there were small insects! The landline phone was completely silent. I contacted many times during the whole period, and the engineer came twice but did not handle it properly, and no one asked about it later! Very bad experience! Strongly not recommended!!!

msg:The luxurious one-bedroom hotel-style apar**ent is very good, suitable for us to live with our dogs. The room is 45 square meters, very large and very clean. Since we have our dogs, we don’t have to worry about the housekeeping depar**ent and clean up the surrounding environment by ourselves. It's very nice, quiet, the garden is clean, there is a large lawn for the dogs to play, and we are very conscious about picking up dog poop. There are also many catering services around, including Starbucks, Luckin, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. The most important thing is that this place allows dogs to stay, and I feel love and respect for pets. Although it is a hotel, you can bring pets to live with you, and it is very clean. There is no peculiar smell, which shows that the hotel works hard. The kitchen in the room has everything we need, which is convenient for us to make simple meals. Needs some improvement. The navigation easily takes us to the opposite community. It was difficult to find it the first time. There is also a sensor light in the closet of the room, which is good and bad. Haha, there is something wrong with the high technology. The attitude of the service staff is particularly friendly. We will still choose this pet-friendly hotel when we come to Shanghai again

Service and management are deployed to the best five-star hotels. The two-bedroom suite can accommodate 4 people. It would be perfect if the dining table is equipped with 4 chairs. Looking forward to my next stay.

msg:I stayed for three nights and had a bad cold. I felt better as soon as I left the hotel. As you can imagine, the air and hygiene in the room were worrying. I ordered takeout to be delivered to the hotel. I wanted to ask the front desk to help the robot deliver it. The front desk refused and asked the front desk to help deliver bottled water. The front desk said that long-term tenants do not provide services. I only stayed for three nights. Am I a long-term tenant? I’m speechless about the hotel’s service😒😒😒

The little brother at the front desk is enthusiastic ❤️, careful, and has a high sense of service. The price is not expensive, and it is super cost-effective in Shanghai.

msg:The new hotel apar**ent has decent facilities in theory. This hotel is actually on the same building as Artyzen Residence. However, the address on Ctrip’s Baidu map led me to the Shanghai Bank Building across the road. This was very hard to find and I went back to check in the room. Finally, the wardrobe sensor light failed and was always on. No matter how I turned it off, it was useless. Because it was late, I tried to sleep by myself at first, but then I couldn't bear it and asked the engineering depar**ent to come over to repair it. I went to bed in the morning, but someone didn't knock on the door in the morning. In this case, I directly swiped my card to enter and said that I needed to repair the air conditioner. The front desk system knew that the room was occupied, so why didn't I call to inquire first and then ask the engineering depar**ent to come? In short, the process was very speechless. As a five-diamond hotel, there is a lot of room for improvement. The front desk will be small in the future. The girl called and said that she could check out the room a little later. I understand that her authority is very limited, but this is what kind of compensation... I don't need to stay in the hotel until the afternoon or evening. After a while, the manager on duty called to apologize and offered to Make up for a lunch, I understand their process, but in terms of actual feelings, I don’t want to erase this real feedback because of compensation, so I write these words in the hope that it can really improve
