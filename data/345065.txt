msg:The hotel is ok just needs more attention to the details , breakfast is ok but needs some improvement especially the western side swimming pool is big and when it comes to hygiene there is nothing much to do especially with the trees around , the inconvenience is that swimming is not allowed in that side which is not the hotel problem , but should be considered before booking as it’s an important thing to do if you are in a beach side hotel .

There’s a good enough western breakfast spread but the restaurants are better if you’re into trying something more exotic than western food too. The service was great, they’re really attentive and hands on. They’ve got more amenities than you’ll get to use in a 5 day stay and it’s close enough to Atlantis and the intercontinental so I got to try their parks and restaurants too. 10 minute ride only. Well worth it, I’d come back

There is no any coffee shops or markets around, your only option is overpriced hotel restaurant…
Service is good, thanks Momo for her help.
Hotel is old, but fairly clean.
It’s so weird that waimai doesn’t bring it to your room, it doesn’t even leave it on lobby… by some reason you have to walk under the rain to get your order.
I could not understand the situation with the beach, it’s not allowed to swim on the beach due to safety reason.
Probably will not stay there again

The navigators (concierge +) were able to accommodate our requests and were at the front desk to answer most queries. Food and service at the Thai restaurant (Star Fish Market) were good, but not quite sure why a slogan is pasted, at eye level, on the windows/doors obstructing the view of the beach when seated for dinner. Red Star Cafe All Day Dining restaurant was only open for breakfast. Breakfast was ok, the restaurant was very busy and dishes were Chinese cuisine forward. Star Fish Bar was closed, also the swim-up bar. Spa is closed.The lounge/lobby bar was not inviting and had barely any guests during our stay. Having four soft-toy vending machines and a sausage stall at the entrance does not entice guests to relax and enjoy a drink. For us, it was a comfortable base to explore the rest of Sanya from.

They seemed to be living in the roof, kind of off to the corner.  I wasn't bothered by them and they didn't care about me, just living their lives.  If you are allergic or afraid of bees you might want to check your room before settling in. 
Besides these small things,  everything else was excellent.  Staff were nice,  speak  English. Great scenery and not a lot of people crowding the beach.

It has private beach with no outsider commercial activities unlike the beach at Atlantis which was packed with people and all kinds of external commercial activities. We also went to Wuzhizhou island  which was very nice but the the kids wanted to leave the island to return to hotel beach!  They were happier at their private beach. The room was clean and cozy with nice balcony for us to chill and dry our wet clothings. We didn’t swim at the hotel pool but it was big the entire hotel was covered in different pools. There was also some animals to keep the kids entertained like rabbits, goose, turtles and ducks. Breakfast was great. Many great selections and the hotel gave us free 2 daily breakfasts for the kids. Thank you!  We will definitely come back to the same hotel in the future.

The breakfast was also great. There's a Thai restaurant opposite the pool and their food was delicious. Highly recommend! The only thing I would suggest is that the rooms are renovated, as they are old and some of the furniture is broken. There's also a strong mildew smell in the room, but I guess that's due to the humid weather. Overall I liked this hotel and would stay again.

msg:The receptionist Momo was very helpful and patient when it comes to answering our questions. She even helped us extend out stay and gave us a gift at check-out! thanks momo! The ladies at the cafe were very nice also.🥰 and we loved the Coconut coffee! we also ordered coconuts everyday! Thank you 

the hotel itself is huge! lots of swimming pools and it felt like had the place to ourselves. Didn't feel crowded at all. Room was very good for the price! cleaning staff were also nice but i think a 10 am knock to clean the room is too early. We understand they want to finish early, but we wanted to have a lie in as well, it's a holiday afterall. Our room ended up not being cleaned for 3 days.

another thing i found faulty were the pool side staff. we ordered some drinks and when it arrived. we asked for ice as it was not cold, we were told to get it ourselves in the kitchen! I told them we have no idea where there kitchen is. They also charge service fee so i think it's reasonable to ask for ice especially when we specifically ordered a cold drink and it arrived warm😂.

We also ordered their floating snacks and the tray was broken, so the water went in the tray and flooded the whole tray. We asked for a second tray and it was still the same. i think for 438 rmb burger , sandwich and few fruits, they need to make sure they have the right tray especially if it's advertised as floating snacks. It was also underwhelming. there were only like 4 calamari ( it was also the frozen fake squid ones you get from the shops,not actual squid like pictured) plus the spring rolls were teeny tiny) see fourth photo for comparison

msg:Could not be happier with this choice of hotel for a new year getaway, well-spent with friends.

The front-desk staff are exceptional: Polite, professional and personalised service. I was greeted by Mr. Wang who helped me with my check-in and upgraded my room. When booking on the site, my preferred room type wasn't available, but Mr. Wang was able to arrange it for me with no trouble. He remained on hand via WeChat to help with any follow-up queries. 

The room was large, clean and comfortable. 

The massive pool, which stretches around the facilities is the centerpiece of the hotel, with plenty of lounging options dotted all over. Unfortunately, the Starfish pool bar was closed. Perhaps because of the time of year, and not that many people using the pool.

There are quite a few dining options at the hotel. A nice mix of Western, Asian and local cuisine. Very pricey but good quality food. If you're looking for cheaper options, there are a few local restaurants not too far from the hotel. 
The breakfast buffet is great. Well-stocked with a decent variety of options. 

The beach is clean and quiet. Note: you aren't allowed to swim at this beach. The currents in this part of Haitang Bay are considered dangerous. Still, it is a lot more peaceful and cleaner than other bays in Sanya. If you're looking for a peaceful and serene getaway, then this location is a good choice. Bear in mind that the hotel is situated near the far end of haitang bay, about 30 minutes from Hou Hai and about an hour from the very popular Dadonghai. 

A 5 star experience overall!

msg:I had a very relaxing time at the Renaissance in Haitang Bay. After a busy term at work it was the perfect place to relax and unwind. Due to it being low season, there was a lot of construction work happening at the hotel, the swim up bar was closed and one of the swimming pools but this did not harm my stay. The pools were beautiful and all connected. Beware - in December they are cold but great to cool down after being in the sun ! 

The beach area is gorgeous with hammocks to relax in. I was surprised that you can’t swim in the ocean here.

The breakfast was delicious and catered for all nationalities and tastes. The staff were incredibly welcoming. Each morning I was greeted by Anita who was so lovely and helpful. She brought me coffee and encouraged me to try local foods such as the hainan dessert and the breakfast noodles. Thank you so much Anita for making my stay so comfortable! 

Room service - disappointing 
Day 2 - ordered carbonara and garlic bread. The bread was forgotten despite me checking the order before the end of the call. When the pasta arrived I immediately phoned room service. They delivered the bread 15 minutes later by which point the pasta was cold - they were not willing to send fresh pasta. 
Day 4 - ordered fish and chips. Biggest regret, I was up all night being sick. I’m the room a letter encourages you to eat from within the hotel as the delivery food is risky… I think I’d take my chances next time! 

The next morning, after very little sleep and still feeling sick. I went to the front desk to tell them about what had happened after eating the room service. The lady at the desk apologised but no action was taken. When I asked what would be done about it she handed me a pen and paper to write a letter to the chef. It was a disappointing end to a lovely relaxing stay. 

Although there were some ups and downs. I’d be interested to see what this hotel has to offer in its busy high season. It has such huge potential!!!

Very much liked the stay.
The hotel is not the newest, so a few things need a touch up.
For this price, defiantly a bargain 👌

The beach is beautiful especially on a beautiful blue sky day. The hotel has lots of things to do, as well a cute little coffee shop. It's very quite as it's far from the airport but if you're looking for a quite ambience, this hotel is a good choice. The beach is also private and quite, the pool is also very nice and big.

We are grateful to the hotel administration and staff for upgrading the category of rooms with sea views. We also thank you for the thorough daily cleaning of the room and the courtesy of the staff. Unfortunately, there is no swimming area for those who like to swim in the sea, although a walk along the seashore is guaranteed. We wish you all a pleasant day.

msg:It’s a nice and cozy hotel to stay in, we spent a wonderful time there ! Quiet neighborhood, hotel’s territory is decorated with trees and flowers! Beautiful green place ! 

The room is big and very clean! The furniture is old, also we found mold spots on the walls. The sea view is marvelous! 

The pool is huge and clean. It’s a pity that there is no deep pool for adults , the whole pool is 1,2 m only. The beach is pretty clean, however you can’t swim in the sea , the red flags are raised everywhere, even if the sea is calm. We were surprised by that, because we didn’t find any information about prohibited swimming on Haitang beach while booking our stay. In addition, there were no mattresses on the sun beds, was not very comfortable to lie on. 

The breakfast is okay-ish. Personally, it would be nice to add boiled eggs. 

Anyway, we liked our stay and how peaceful this place is. The nature is amazing ! In our opinion, it’s a perfect hotel for families with children.

The personnel staff were super nice, especially Cypher and Colin. Before arriving to the hotel, I got a call from Cypher who offered us a room upgrade to an ocean view room for free, he was really kind and responsive to our needs. We also got to talk to Colin during our stay and he was friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

There is also a big game room in case of bad weather (bowling, billiards, video games etc…)

msg:The Renaissance is a hotel that makes it money off quantity of guests, rather than a lower number of premium-paying guests. It has direct beach access with chairs on the beach (rare for Haitang hotels), a large decent pool with two small heated pools. The rooms and breakfast are fine. The rest of their food is crazily overpriced, quality is fine but nothing to boast about. 

This is a good hotel if you want a cheap, decent stay, or a decent longer stay. Just beware to couples and solo trackers: because of the price, it is a VERY child and family friendly hotel. 

Recommend walking to the Capella along the beach for a decent dinner. Somewhat far from the hotels on the main Haitang ***** near the food court so just be aware less food options nearby.

Room service is 24hrs but not for alcoholic drinks. The hotel offers free transport to the duty free mall and airport dropoff as well. They had a dinner buffet with all kinds of food. If you are looking into getting away from the city life and enjoy the beach ...try this hotel.

msg:The room was very spacious, a bit dated, but spotlessly clean. There was a large balcony and the bed was comfortable. The TV only has Chinese channels. The beachfront location is really nice but there is no swimming allowed from the beach and there aren't many other options nearby for dining so you could be reliant on the over-priced hotel restaurants; a taxi to Houhai costs about RMB90 which has plenty of bars and nightlife if you want to explore further afield.  The grounds are pleasant and well-tended and the gym was good for this level of hotel. The floodlit tennis courts were also a nice feature, if you're a keen player bring your own racquets and balls as the ones we used had seen better days, but it was fun all the same. The standout feature of the hotel is amazing outdoor pool, this would be the main reason I would stay here again, I think it's better than the hotel photos portray. Breakfast was decent, a wide choice of western and Chinese options.

As so often in China the main weakness was service which, with one or two exceptions, was slow, disinterested, impersonal; English is limited. If international hotel chains like Marriott want to charge international prices then they need to invest a bit more in their staff.

I enjoyed the less busy beach this time here. This area has a lot of higher priced hotels so this is one of the cheaper places in the area but the amenities don’t disappoint. Nice pools to swim in with food and drinks delivered to the pool area.

Smith (Mr Wang) at the reception was most helpful, and always on stand-by. That was more than I expected. They also helped with a slightly later checkout. Christy at the breakfast buffet remembered the way I like my coffe in the mornings, and the other staff members kindly offered their special coconut poridge and other local items.
I give this stay 5 stars because of the staff!

The hotel itself is a bit old, but I didnt mind. Bed is comedy, great sea-view, and large rooms. It was nice and cooled down when I arrived - great!
The breakfast has great selection of both Chinese ans western options!
The pool is massive - could have been a little cleaner, but was okay. There was basically nobody there during the day, so it was nice and quiet.

The Beach is cleaned by the staff, but due to government regulation - no Bathing/ swimming there.
There is unfortunately no restaurants, shops or other nearby the hotel, which would have been nice.

msg:The hotel lobby is very grand, and it is also a long-established hotel in Haitang Bay Resort. Overall, it is good. The only drawback is that the corridor from the room to the lobby is open and has no windows. There are many mosquitoes without shelter, and it is very hot when you go out. The place to pick up takeout is also far away, and I got several bites when picking up takeout. The room is moldy to a certain extent. In addition to these hardware, the overall service is still very good. The butler will contact you the night before check-in, and the butler will promptly inform you of the location of the airport shuttle. The airport bus is also one of the highlights of Renaissance. Many high-end hotels don’t even have this shuttle bus...

The service is great. They upgraded our room twice for free.
The breakfast is very rich with many varieties (I ate fried eggs for several days hhh).
Fruits were given as soon as we checked in. There are many free entertainment activities (but we really didn’t have time).
The only drawback is that the facilities are average and it is too far from the city.
It is suitable for bringing children and those who like to stay at home. It is quite far for young people to go out and take pictures and check in.
By the way, the butler Anson is super nice (we sent messages at 12 o’clock in the evening and he was still online hhh).
In short, the hotel service is good and the facilities are complete. You can play for a few days.

Although it is a little far from the duty-free city, it is quiet and suitable for people who hang out in hotels. I met the housekeeper Ivy last time, and I spent a pleasant week under her careful arrangement this time. The room type was upgraded by two levels, and you can see the beach when you open the window. Twice I turned on the Do Not Disturb light and they specifically asked me if I needed the room cleaned. When checking in, Ctrip also took the initiative to arrange the late check-out and welcome fruit, which saved me a lot of worry. I ate in all three restaurants of the hotel, and the room was delivered twice, including the coffee and cocktails in the lobby bar, which were very good. Thank you Renaissance, thank you Ivy, I will come again next year.

The location is relatively remote, but it is quiet and less crowded. You can get to the hotel by taxi from the airport for about 130. The hotel is a bit old and the facilities are relatively old. But it is cost-effective. It is very OK to stay in a five-star hotel for about 500 yuan. I especially need to praise the lifeguard here. I checked in on Tuesday. There were very few people. The balcony of the poolside room opened the door to the swimming pool. When the children went swimming, the lifeguard stood not far away and watched them. The distance was kept very good and they were very responsible. In addition, the housekeeper Jiazi would add WeChat the day before check-in and start communicating the guests' needs in advance. If you have any questions during your stay, you can also ask her. It is very considerate service.

We stayed for three consecutive days and were lucky to be upgraded to a sea view room by our butler Gary. He also took the trouble to introduce the surrounding food, drink and entertainment information. The room was very clean and refreshing. It was unnecessary to worry about dampness. The room was spacious and had everything it should have. The bedding was especially comfortable, worthy of Renaissance! The king of cost-effectiveness.

There is a cleaning lady who keeps wiping and sweeping while eating, which is very disgusting. Guests should not walk around with dirty rags while dining, which affects the experience

Facilities: 75 points because it is indeed old but very clean

Hygiene: 95 points There are scars on the sofa and other electric mats, which are also old and need to be updated

Environment: 99 Good greening

Service: 99 Timely response

My son was very happy. The room we stayed in didn't smell damp. There was a swimming pool downstairs and you could watch the sunrise in the morning. The whole hotel is quiet and just a few minutes walk from the beach. The breakfast is rich in variety, and you will be helped to guide you to your seat when you enter. There are enough tables and chairs, so there is no need to queue. There were also the front desk guy, the delivery guy, the luggage delivery guy, the customer service girl, the parking guy, the restaurant staff, and the cleaning lady all kept smiling, patient, and attentive.

The environment of the hotel is very good and I took a lot of photos! You can watch the sunrise in the room in the morning and watch the sunset on the hotel beach in the evening, which is great!

I sent 20 photos for reference! Breakfast is also available at the hotel. There is a free hotel bus to duty-free shops and the airport in the morning. Remember to make a reservation in advance!
The hotel doorman service is also good, taking the initiative to help guests carry luggage and store their luggage. You can give priority to taking your children on vacation, and the price-performance ratio is very high!

The blue color of the swimming pool is also very beautiful. Several swimming pools are quite good. The beach of the hotel is also very clean. , there are not many people and it is very quiet. You can enjoy the sea breeze quietly. It is nice to watch the sunset. The breakfast is rich and varied. All the staff are very polite. If you ask the cleaning uncle for directions, he will give you polite and patient directions. The corridors and rooms of the hotel feel a bit older, but that's understandable after being opened for so many years. Hygiene and other aspects are very clean. I would especially like to praise Miao Zi at the front desk. She was super nice and considerate. When I checked in, I was given a sea view room. Later, when I went in, I found that I didn’t like the location there. I told Miao Zi and helped us find another room type. She kept giving her the best advice. We thought of a way, and when the pool room became available, they upgraded us to a pool room. We stayed here for two days. The overall feeling was great. The responsible front desk made my travel experience double.
Facilities: Complete and very convenient

The decoration is very old and outdated, but it is a large and comprehensive hotel. The staff service is very good. There are fireworks all night on New Year's Eve and 11 o'clock the next day. The beach of the hotel is very clean. Although the waves are too big to swim, there are lifeguards. Always squatting and guarding.
The hotel has a dedicated airport shuttle bus, and it takes 1 hour to get to the airport without traffic jams.
There are 3 restaurants including Chinese, Western and Thai food, but the set menus on holidays will increase in price and the taste is okay.
Breakfast was only available until 10:30, so there were too many people queuing up and it was a bit chaotic.
It's very refreshing to upgrade to a room type during the Chinese New Year, and the service with a smile is very warm.
The large swimming pool and large lawn are zero distance from the beach. You can go directly to the sea. It is almost like having your own beach. You can dig sand and catch the sea freely.
Most of the entertainment facilities cost money. If you contact us, you will be given free coupons, otherwise the hotel will not become popular and it will appear that the hotel is outdated.

The oversized garden and outdoor swimming pool lead directly to the beach, and you can feel the romance of the coconut breeze and the sea. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the high-floor sea view rooms have wide views and rich parent-child activities, making them suitable for family outings. The "Fenxiang Ting" restaurant has good dishes, rich and frugal, and the seafood vinegar and coconut jelly are worth trying. The most commendable thing is the warm and thoughtful service of the staff, especially Momo and Cindy at the front desk and Chinese restaurant manager Guo, who have demonstrated Marriott's meticulous hospitality. I look forward to staying here again.

Although the Renaissance Hotel is a little far from the airport, because of the convenient transportation now, this is not a problem because it is relatively cheaper. The Renaissance Hotel covers a large area, has large hotel rooms, and has great greenery. And it's very close to the seaside and beach, which is convenient. There are many more places to eat in the surrounding area compared to 2012, and the duty-free shops are also very close. All of the above are good, and some need to be improved. Because the hotel has been open for a long time, some equipment becomes obsolete. This is also an objective rule. I hope the hotel will also replace some old things according to the actual situation.

msg:I went to visit friends in Tufu Bay and chose this nearby hotel, which was great value for money! The first thing I felt was the attentive service of the butler Xiaolin. He added a WeChat post to introduce the special services, which was extremely warm. The hotel has direct access to the seaside, and you can watch the sunrise and sunset from the balcony of the sea-view room. It’s so beautiful! It's a pity that I didn't take any pictures. Specially recommended meals include Chinese mustard shrimp balls, Western spaghetti with meat sauce, and Thai curry beef brisket, 🍞delicious! The facilities feel a bit old.

Although the room decoration is old, it is hygienic and clean, and there are few people on the beach. The hotel's service is warm and thoughtful, especially the beautiful girl Fiona. Although she is still in the internship stage, she is skilled in business and enthusiastic in service, just like a senior front desk. If the hotel can cultivate such employees, it will surely have a large number of talents and its business will flourish.

It is right on the seaside. There is a private beach. The location is good, but there are a few street lights at night. I don’t know if it is winter. The reason is that the room is very nice and the window opens to the sea. The housekeeper Yuky is very patient! I like it very much. I was upgraded to a suite for free. I was very considerate and provided welcome fruits and water. The room is clean and tidy. It is suitable for a family to play. It is more fun to bring children. There are complete parent-child recreational facilities. The lobby and restaurant are spacious. Check-in is also very fast. The breakfast is rich in variety, complete with Chinese and Western food, and there are free travel photos (additional photos require extra money). This trip was not planned well. Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely choose Renaissance Hotel!

msg:It is a long-established five-star resort hotel owned by Marriott. Before booking, I read reviews that it was quite old, and I was a little worried about how it would affect the experience. But after I checked in, I felt fine.
Hotels on the seaside age quickly due to the influence of sea salt, but Marriott's foundation is still there after all. The hardware infrastructure and software services are in place. The decoration style is almost exactly the same as Marriott's Le Meridien. The bedding and linens are also very comfortable and the service is excellent. The staff is also very nice. Ivy who checked in helped me choose a room closest to the coast, and also gave me fruit and provided butler-style service.
The weather is a bit cold, so I’ll come back and enjoy the swimming pool next time. If it seems old, look at the price. This price is unbeatable.

This may be because it is located in Tufu Bay, which is actually only ten kilometers away from Haitang Bay. However, it It's very close to Capella. The hotel room is large, has its own beach, and the charges for paddle boarding and other activities are reasonable and not expensive. There are many varieties of breakfast, which are in line with psychological expectations. There are many parent-child programs, which are suitable for traveling with children. However, one thing to say is that the decoration of the hotel rooms is indeed a bit old, so many reviews think that the hotel has various flaws. The overall experience is great value for money.

All in all, I had a great time staying in Renaissance for the past few days😀 It felt like a vacation!

msg:This is my second time staying at a Marriott hotel. It is different from the AccorHotel I stayed at in Sanya before. Although the facilities of this Renaissance hotel are slightly older than those of other hotels in Haitang Bay, the sorghum and palace-style architecture in the lobby cannot cover up the a**osphere when it was first built. Majestic. The hotel is close to the beach and the sand is relatively fine. It may be that only part of the swimming pool is opened in the off-season, but it is enough for daily use. Thanks to Renaissance Area for contacting me in advance and upgrading me to a luxurious king bed with an open sea view! The quality of Renaissance as a five-star old luxury hotel can also be seen from the internal facilities of the room. Safes, sea-view bathtubs, and refrigerators are all available. Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, the rooms are a bit damp and musty because they have been facing the sea for a long time. Others Everything is ok and worthy of the price. There are Chinese and Western breakfast options, but there are fewer varieties. I personally feel that the breakfast is not worthy of the five-star standard and does not match the price of 198 per person. Finally, I would like to thank Area at the Renaissance Hotel. When I left the hotel, I specifically asked the front desk to give me a souvenir, a sunscreen umbrella from the Renaissance logo custom shop. Thank you again ~

I thought I would sleep in and booked a hotel nearby. . Unexpectedly, the Ritz-St. Regis in many places did not do this, but Haitang Bay Renaissance did it. The housekeeper Ivy took the initiative to call to confirm the itinerary. Although the reservation was made through Ctrip, I also asked for a try with the attitude of giving it a try. Got my membership number. lvy quickly confirmed the membership level and provided member benefits, which was indeed an unexpected surprise. We arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night and upgraded to a sea view suite. The welcome fruits were already placed in the room. Although I only slept one night and checked out early the next day for a meeting, I was really in a good mood (the front desk had already issued an invoice as I requested when I checked out in the morning). Although it was only a Renaissance hotel, it really made people feel at home. Feeling, good.

Facilities: My favorite is the game world and the large swimming pool, which are great for vacation. There is also a small sofa on the balcony that is great for relaxing! You can stay in the hotel all day, and there are sofas and beach chairs everywhere in the garden. There are many places to rest.
Service: The staff are enthusiastic and thoughtful. The butler Anson added WeChat one day in advance to answer questions and praise the staff in the hotel. Many of the staff have very good attitudes. We went on a group tour at ** and the coconut jelly waiter in the Chinese restaurant also welcomed us warmly😚 There is also the egg roll for breakfast Eat freshly made cookies every day☺️
Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy. I bring my own disposable bath towels and water bottles when I go out, so I don’t pay much attention to other things.
It’s just that the food is so expensive. The ice cream sold in the lobby is particularly delicious and costs 40😣 Coconut 38. If it was 18, I would buy it😤

The hotel's own beach is also good. There are not many people in the off-season and it is very comfortable. However, it is a bit big and it is a bit far from the room to the beach and restaurants.
Finally, the hotel has two free shuttle buses to the airport at 10:00 and 14:00, which is very convenient.

I have stayed in basically all good hotels in Sanya. I can only say that this time I was particularly disappointed in my failure. You can say that the price of Wanli is high, and I don’t have a problem with it. But a small pot of soup that costs nearly 300 only contains a little mushroom and three shrimp. I asked for less shrimp, so I don’t blame it. Those mushrooms that cost 5 yuan are really disgusting... ... The curry chicken that costs more than 100 yuan contains five or six pieces of potatoes and five or six pieces of chicken breast. I like the climate in Sanya very much. But what kind of environment is it now to still have this kind of price and consumption? Hey, it doesn’t matter if you are expensive, please pay the price corresponding to your dish. . Give you some advice. Thank you.

I checked in late, and Cindy upgraded my room. I also received welcome fruit gifts and photography services when I checked into the hotel, which was very considerate. I woke up a little late and didn't have time to have breakfast, but my friend said that his breakfast was also very rich.
The room is high-end and clean, the bath towels are quite new, and the sea view is great👍🏻
I also gave a small surprise when I left. It was really thoughtful.

msg:This time I stayed at the Renaissance Hotel in Sanya. The overall feeling was good. First of all, I would like to thank the housekeeper Momo. He communicated in advance before arrival and helped to upgrade the sea view room. He also helped to handle the extension before check-out. During the stay He also answers all questions, responds promptly, and has a dedicated attitude. Thumbs up👍
As for the hotel, although it is older, the overall facilities are quite complete and there are more parking spaces. You can enter the lobby without walking too far after parking. I personally think the swimming pool is quite good. Compared with other hotels, the opening hours are longer. At 22:00 in the evening, the water quality is also very bad
Although the breakfast in the hotel tastes quite satisfactory, it is worth mentioning the service. During my stay, the breakfast staff I met every day were very enthusiastic and always available. They would not neglect the guests at all. The service was meticulous and considerate, and they actively asked the elderly if they needed hot drinks. , help to get it👍
This hotel room I chose a connecting room. Because I am bringing an elderly person with me, for convenience, the two rooms have a door, which opens into a two-bedroom. The space becomes more spacious. The room is clean and tidy. It is cleaned in a timely manner every day. They will provide a lot of drinking water 👍. The only drawback is that the hardware facilities are old and I personally think they should be updated 😂
In summary, this trip is still perfect, because the high-quality service adds a lot of points to the hotel. I hope to improve the hardware and will choose it next time.
By the way, the hotel also has a children's playground and small animal viewing.

msg:After doing some strategy, I know that this hotel is a bit old, but when I saw this door, I was a little bit broken. Because the doors are all on the verandah, the damaged appearance of the wind blown sea salt is a bit ugly. Then the exterior wall of the building is also blackened and mildewed. The pillows in the room had a musty smell. But the hotel's other activities and facilities are passable, the swimming pool is also okay, the greenery is better, and the seaside can also take good photos. Given the current economic situation, the hotel’s hardware facilities are the second-to-last price in Haitang Bay, and middle-class people like me who have downgraded their consumption have no right to be picky.

The facilities are a bit old, but this is negligible compared to the happiness of the children. The swimming pool provides swimming ring rentals, hand boats, underwater boosters and other recreational facilities, but they need to be paid separately. I've never been to the restaurant except for breakfast. It's all takeout and you need to pick it up from the takeaway counter at the spa at the door. The service attitude of the ladies at the front desk was great. The reserved garden view room was upgraded to a sea view room. The waiters were enthusiastic and proactive. It is a very cost-effective hotel.

Last year, a family of 10 or so came here, because I didn’t feel it when I checked in at night. When I woke up the next morning, the picture that greeted my eyes was amazing. Feeling relaxed and happy, my cousin decided to continue staying that day. Compared with his home in Haitang Bay, the beach is bigger and closer. The swimming pool is the most, and it is also very clean. The attitude of the waiters is also very good. I will go again this year. Please note the request when booking a room , the housekeeper Eliza and Ctrip customer service, both confirmed with me repeatedly and met the requirements, very warm and thoughtful. Although the hotel’s hardware is new in other bays, it doesn’t affect the comfort at all. The bathroom has a spacious dressing table. (This is an advantage compared to the Yalong Bay I went to the back. Although some hotels in Yalong Bay have a large area, they didn’t consider it. The problem with the dressing table), the toilet in the bathroom is a bit crude, the breakfast variety is limited, and everything else is very good! Go to the parking lot, walk to the front desk, there are shaded places and it won't be very sunny! I plan to go to this hotel next time, after all, the most important thing is to be comfortable on vacation!

The location is a bit remote, but the advantage is that there are many swimming pools in the park, rich parent-child programs, and an independent beach. It is very pleasant to dig sand at night under the sunset. The housekeeper, Momo, is very responsible. She added WeChat one day in advance to inform about parent-child activities, travel photography, duty-free shop shuttle bus and other items, and also helped to upgrade the parent-child room, which leads directly to the beach. It is very nice👍
Let me talk about two fly in the oin**ent: first of all, there are no places to eat near the hotel. To order takeaway, you need to go to the takeaway cabinet next to the lobby to pick it up, because our room is a little far from the lobby, so it is very inconvenient; secondly, the gift of travel photography, the photography teacher heard about us As long as the 5 photos were given away, I was very impatient and took 5 photos for the children beside the trash can at the seaside. (See Figure 8) There were only 5 photos, and it took only three minutes before and after. I waited for him for an hour... This kind of service is not worth mentioning. The travel photography teachers presented by other hotels on this trip were very patient and helped to take multiple photos for selection. Even if they didn’t spend money➕photographs, their attitude was very good. In contrast, the experience was really bad.

The view of the suite is really amazing. I live in a poolside room by the swimming pool. I would like to praise my butler Anson for helping to upgrade the room type. I stayed here for two nights very comfortably. You can see the swimming pool and the sea when you go out.

swimming pool:
The swimming pool in the entire poolside room is connected, so you can swim for a long time

Location traffic:
Although it is a bit remote compared to other hotels in Haitang Bay, it is also very convenient here. It is very good to eat takeaway or eat in the hotel. The key is that it is also close to the duty-free shop, and there is also a hotel bus for easy access.

Serve:
The service is very good, and the quality of a five-star hotel is guaranteed. Anson finally gave me a small gift when I left the store, which was very kind.

The front desk of the hotel is also good. Thank you for the happiness that Renaissance has brought us these days. I have already recommended it to several friends. I have to say that it is indeed a relatively cost-effective hotel. And the coffee and rice noodles at the breakfast hotel are the best😀

When we went to the pool on the first day, we didn’t wear hotel bathrobes. The pool staff let us register. When we went to the pool the next day, we wore hotel bathrobes.

msg:The experience is not good, I will not go again, the fee is very expensive, the room booked includes breakfast, children have to pay an additional 68 a day, and there are very few types of breakfast to choose from. The parent-child gift package given by Mingming is also a pitfall. The swimming ring is limited to one hour, and a cone of ice cream is 28. If you give a 10 yuan coupon, you have to spend money to buy it. Everywhere reflects careful planning, but the service and experience are not good.

msg:This is the first time I stayed at the Renaissance Haitang Bay Resort and Spa, and I felt very comfortable overall. Because it was the off-season of Sanya tourism, there were not many guests staying there. However, the service from the receptionist when entering the lobby to the front desk staff was very good, especially the beauty Kate at the front desk. She introduced some of the hotel's services and facilities in detail, which made people feel very caring. The hotel room is white, the bedding is very new, and the toiletries are not bad. The hotel's breakfast combines Chinese and Western styles, and the ingredients are very fresh. There is a low-fat muffin that is very delicious, and freshly ground coffee is also good. Finally, I would like to comment on the hotel's private beach. The scenery is beautiful. It only takes 2 minutes to get to the beach from the lobby. The scenery along the way is suitable for taking pictures. It's amazing. If you come to Haitang Bay again, the first choice is the Renaissance Haitang Bay Resort!

They can all be resolved quickly. I would like to give a thumbs up to Ms. Kate, the housekeeper. The cleaning aunts are also very nice, and they clean up very carefully, making people feel at ease. We originally booked for two days, because Ms. Kate brought us check-in The experience was great, and I stayed for another two days.

Special thanks to manager Kate Chen for making us feel at home. All the staff I met were very professional and very enthusiastic. The hotel room is spacious, and the housekeeping staff keeps the room very neat and clean. But remember to close the doors and windows when you enter the room, otherwise the floor will get wet soon.
The breakfast is rich, but there are many people staying at the hotel on weekends. This time I experienced a Thai restaurant with my friends. Everyone performed their duties and was very enthusiastic. My friend especially liked the curry beef brisket. I was curious about how the bread was made. It tasted like meat😄
The hotel has a lot of leisure and entertainment facilities, but I like to soak in the swimming pool in this weather. The staff in the swimming pool are on guard and dedicated to protect the safety of the guests. I met brother Mark Chen from the recreation depar**ent at the foam party in the swimming pool, and he has been encouraging and motivating the timid The children play, the children like him very much. Of course, children will like the Child Star Club. They can play for a long time by themselves, and I can also play the kind 😄 The staff in the recreation depar**ent are very caring and patient. They will take the children to play games and organize different activities every day. Forget to take pictures Schedule is up.
In the end, I really recommend the poolside room. Children who are not afraid of water must like it very much!

I am curious that the score is so high for the age. Before arriving, the butler, Bubble, started to provide considerate service. He specially arranged breakfast and fruit for us, and reserved the room we wanted in advance. The room is large, the floor height is higher than many resort hotels, and the sanitation is also good. There is only the sound of the waves on the balcony. There are no neighboring hotels or real estate around, so the beach is basically a private beach. We ate Thai food and Western food, and it was indeed a lot cheaper than the duty-free shop. We were amazed to be able to taste so good. In short, who would not love a hotel with a private beach and delicious food. Thanks again Bubble Butler!

Ms. Merlin, the customer service, is really considerate and thoughtful. She took the initiative to add WeChat so that she can be contacted at any time. She reminded the duty-free shop to collect coupons and also extended check-out for us. It was just in time for me to catch an evening flight.
Walking out of the hotel lobby is the large swimming pool and beach. There is no disturbance from outsiders, only hotel guests. Compared with the public beach, there is a lot less noise. Walking along the beach in the evening is a better experience
The disadvantage is that the room is slightly damp due to the seaside. This is a common problem of seaside hotels.
Overall, I am satisfied with my stay. I will continue to choose Renaissance when I come to Sanya in the future.

msg:2 days before the trip, the housekeeper Bubble 🫧 called me and added WeChat. On the day of check-in, I was still renting a car. Bubble WeChat sent me to say that the room was upgraded, and it has been cleaned and ready to move in. I feel very heartwarming~ Staying in the room , the air conditioner has been adjusted, it is clean and tidy, and the bedding is very comfortable~ The beach here in Bialong Bay is much more comfortable and soft~ The swimming pool is also very big, and the baby needs a lot of water to make milk powder. I told the front desk and it was delivered I came here with a big bag full of drinking water. After staying at the Yalong Bay Marriott for 3 days, I decided to let the housekeeper Bubble continue to book here for another 2 nights. I found out that there is still a big children's club. When it is very hot during the day and you don't want to swim You can let the children play in the club. This time I stayed at the Yalong Bay Marriott and Haitang Bay Renaissance hotels. Compared with the Renaissance Hotel, although the small train, manual activities, swimming rings, and sand digging tools are all charged items, but The room rate is very low, so compared to the kind of hotels that cost around 2,000 a night, it is still very cost-effective~ Thanks again to the butler, Bubble, who arranged everything properly during the stay~

msg:This is my first stay at Renaissance, and the overall experience is simply amazing!
Service: First of all, the hotel has a very considerate airport pick-up and drop-off service. Then when we checked in, the lady at the front desk, butler momo, was super nice. The service attitude was super good and very enthusiastic. She asked us if we needed help with luggage, and how to get to the room and restaurant , very professional and considerate! It left us with the first good impression of our stay! ! ! They thoughtfully gave us fruits, super sweet and delicious! Thanks housekeeper momo!
Facilities/hygiene/environment: The hotel is very large, with great scenery, a large swimming pool, and very close to the beach! The room we stayed in was a sea view room, and the room was huge! The facilities in the room are very complete and new. The room has no peculiar smell and is very quiet. You can feel Wanli's intentions in every aspect of the room display! There is an oversized bathtub, and you can watch the sea view while soaking in the bath. It is very pleasant to watch the super beautiful sea view on the balcony in the morning and evening. This trip to Sanya is so happy!
I will still choose Renaissance when I come here in the future! Five-star hotel, the butler service at the front desk is super good, the pick-up and drop-off service is in place, the environment is super good, the facilities are complete, hygienic and clean, the price is super high, highly recommended! Believe me sisters!

The hotel is close to the beach and is eroded by the sea breeze. The facilities are relatively old, but the maintenance is not bad. The sanitation is very good in all aspects, and the room is cleaned very well It is clean, the breakfast is considered good in this price range, the beach quality is good, the hotel area is large, the swimming pool and garden are all good, it is suitable for parent-child activities, and it is also suitable for people with a small budget who want to soak in the hotel. Here, I would like to thank the housekeeper momo again

msg:The service attitude is relatively poor. From the receptionist to the kitchen staff, all have stiff and cold faces. It’s just that they can’t feel the enthusiasm of the consumer service industry. It feels like the customers are taking advantage of the hotel. Many guests who arrived after 12 o'clock had to wait in the hotel lobby until after three o'clock before they could check in one after another. A portion of pineapple rice in the Thai restaurant costs 158 yuan. It costs money to rent swimming rings for the swimming pool. The design of the hotel is also very outdated. We booked 4 rooms for a total of 8 nights. When we inquired about late check-out, we were told that we could only choose one room for late check-out, which made no sense at all. In short, the shelf of a five-star resort hotel is now empty, and the price is now a little lower, which is more or less reflected. Here comes the last time.

We drive from Tufu Bay to get off the expressway, and it takes about 5 minutes to come from the expressway. Driving is still very convenient. Entering the hotel, you will feel that it is very suitable for a holiday to relax yourself here. And the hotel feels like a vacation. The hotel pool is huge. The beach side of the garden is also very suitable for taking pictures, and it is very popular. The hotel has three restaurants of its own, and there are quite a lot of breakfast buffet varieties.

When you open the curtains, you can see the blue sea and the swimming pool & tropical rainforest hotel downstairs stretching to the sea. Lying on the balcony and watching the sea is so comfortable that you don’t want to go back to work.
The beach in front of the hotel has just passed May Day and there are very few people. The deck chairs, the sea, and the breeze make it super comfortable to lie on it all day.
Overall, it has enhanced the experience of this trip to Sanya, recommended!

There is a heated swimming pool for children, and there are different parent-child activities every day of the week. We stayed on Wednesday, and there was a bubble pool activity in the afternoon. More than a dozen children played, which was very good
When we checked in the hotel room, we were upgraded to a swimming pool room on the first floor. Opening the door is the swimming pool. Unfortunately, I couldn't go into the water. The water is still a bit cold at this time. The room facilities are indeed a bit old, and the hot water needs to be left for more than ten minutes before it becomes slightly warm.
We ate at several restaurants in the hotel (Thai food, Chinese food, Western food). My five-year-old daughter and I spent an average of 350 per meal. Only the Chinese restaurant Fenix Court is quite delicious, and the others are average.
The overall is not bad, the service attitude of all the waiters is good, the privacy is very good, there are really few people at this time, very leisurely and no chaotic feeling, this is 10,000 times better than MGM

Arrive from the city early in the morning to the hotel. After checking in, it is just right to go to the cdf for a stroll, because there are fewer people and more goods in the morning. In the afternoon, I received a call from the hotel saying that the room is ready, just go back to the hotel and get the room card. Overall, Renaissance is very cost-effective, with large lawns, children's play areas, and beaches. It was very comfortable to lie on the beach and blow the sea breeze for two consecutive mornings. Self-help until 10:30 in the morning, there is still time to go after a late sleep, and then go out to play or lie on the beach. Compared with others, I think this place is more private. I will choose here next time I come to play.

The service of the hotel is very considerate, and everything you need is almost responsive, and it can be delivered quickly. After the booking, the housekeeper Merlin contacted me one day in advance to communicate with me about the personalized needs and event schedule, shuttle bus schedule, duty-free shop coupons and other practical content. On the last day, I also helped with late check-out, which just happened to seamlessly connect with the shuttle bus to the airport.
The local special dustpan package that I ordered from the hotel package is very rich in content, and a children’s package is also given.
The most value-for-money is a variety of free children's activities, as well as water slides, hand-operated boats, beach swings, sea view, small trains, trampolines, slides, small sand pits, and indoor children's activity rooms... Children will not be bored playing in the hotel all day, Especially suitable for family travel.

The type of breakfast is ok, but the surrounding area of the hotel is relatively desolate, 8 kilometers away from the nearest hotel, so it is better to drive by yourself. It is 50 kilometers away from Boundary Island, which is very suitable for visiting Boundary Island the next day.

msg:The hotel is Marriott, and the services are all online. Before the trip, there is an exclusive butler to contact you to help you upgrade the room type. Special thanks to our butler Ivy for helping to upgrade the selected luxury sea view. This sea view is worth the ticket price😄
The swimming pool, beach, and children's programs in the hotel are all ok, and children staying in the hotel can participate. Although the hotel looks a bit mottled, but the high floors are fine, and any services that need to be provided can be provided in a timely manner. I don't understand why there are so many trolls on the Internet. It is recommended to bring your own electric mosquito liquid, although the hotel also provides it. In short, this hotel meets my requirements for a resort hotel, and I will stay here next time I have a chance. It's just that the location is a bit remote, and we can only travel by car. We stayed for two nights without leaving the hotel, and we were completely lying down with our baby.

The housekeeper beauty called me in advance the day before I checked in, and added WeChat to provide a lot of help. Because I brought the children with me, I also helped to upgrade the parent-child room, which is very good, and there are children's slippers, bath towels, toys, etc.
The hotel has a private beach, which is very, very large! Children don't have to go out after playing in the hotel all day. Watching movies, trampoline, merry-go-round, video games, swimming, afternoon tea, coffee, drinks, everything...
I like this hotel very much. It is very comfortable. I would like to talk about the breakfast in particular. The side dish of noodles, Mrs. Cabbage, is so delicious! !

Facilities: Although the exterior has a sense of age, the interior of the room is very clean.
Hygiene: very satisfied
Environment: It feels like a tropical rainforest, the hotel is too big, there are many trees, next to the sea, the spring is warm and the flowers are blooming...
Service: The service is very good, and every service staff is very kind.

I said to help arrange a better room with two babies, and I am very satisfied with the room she helped arrange. I have already recommended it to my friends, and I will make a reservation with her next time when a friend comes.
        🤹🍢🍨 The package I bought is very cost-effective, including baby meals, afternoon tea, lunch, and various things for babies to play. The hotel's feature is that it is the most worry-free for parents and children to live in. There are several coaches playing various games with them every day , Gentle and caring to the baby, and also helped to take pictures. Coming to the beach is not just about playing on the beach, there are also many fun things to do, such as playing in the indoor playground when the weather is hot.

msg:The Sanya Edition was originally booked, but because I have been there last time, this time it is like experiencing some different hotels. Renaissance, with a score of 4.8, is considered a high score in Haitang Bay. The point is that Marriott Platinum members love Marriott hotels. The price is indeed very good, and the good reviews in the reviews also make my heart move.
It was late at night when I stayed at the hotel, and the service attitude was super super good... I was received by Xiaotong, and I added WeChat. Whenever I had a question, I would ask him on WeChat. He replied in seconds. He helped me solve many problems and gave me some experiences. So I stayed one night and I continued. The service attitude is really what impresses me the most in this hotel. The service staff in the breakfast room are warm-hearted to help you answer questions, and the service staff in the swimming pool even take pictures for you.
The beach check-in point is super beautiful. I think it is no less than the cultural east I visited last time, although the coastline may be shorter. At this price, it is simply the king of value for money. It is very suitable for parent-child travel, many parent-child activities, and parent-child families are also very suitable.
The hygienic environment is pretty good, and it takes 10 minutes to drive to the duty-free shop. 40 minutes to Yalong Bay. 5 minutes to the beach.
Hmm, worth the experience.

Xiaojia at the front desk checked in and confirmed that it was a sea view room. She then said that the room was a little far away and arranged for a little brother to lead the way, and finally arrived at the room The sea view room I was looking forward to, but the view outside the balcony door is the garden (Figure 1), which is very different. After confirming with the front desk, I said that the room type is fully booked today, and I will change it the next day. Fortunately, before noon the next day, I finally changed back to a sea view room, and my mood immediately improved. The seven-day trip to Sanya finally kicked off. Generally speaking, the service is not bad, a small gift is presented, and the Hainan noodles for breakfast are delicious 😋. The hotel's Thai restaurant and Chinese restaurant are also delicious, and it takes ten minutes to drive to the duty-free shop. Direct access to the beach, beautiful swimming pool and garden scenery.

msg:If you want to take a quiet vacation, Renaissance is really great. There is no hotel next to it, and you can enjoy a beach to yourself. The environment is elegant. Although the rooms and buildings are relatively old, the geographical environment and the beach are really great. Special thanks to Kate at the front desk Young lady, you can avoid waiting for us to upgrade the sea view room when you check in. The communication during the check-in period is also very good. If you need anything, you can quickly respond to it. It’s super awesome. Brother Bruce contacted us a day in advance to inquire, and he will answer any inquiries after check-in. The service of the little brother in the game center is also excellent. He actively introduces and debugs the equipment, and explains it to the children. The hotel's set meals are so delicious, and the taste is particularly steamy. It is recommended that guests staying here who like spicy food can try it. The only thing I think is that if the room and walls can be refurbished, and the light bulb is broken and replaced in time, the check-in experience will be better.

msg:A few days before check-in, a woman who claimed to be from Ctrip with a mobile phone number ending in ************ called and asked about check-in. I roughly told her the check-in time and said that I was a Marriott Platinum card holder. She asked for an upgrade if there was a room available.

As a result, I found out when I arrived at the hotel that the room I had arranged in advance was the worst room type in the hotel, a decorated room facing the main road.

I was so angry that I took my luggage back to the hotel front desk and asked that even if I couldn't upgrade, I should arrange it according to the deluxe garden view room type booked on Ctrip.

Fortunately, the beauty at the front desk was more responsible and gave the Marriott Platinum card an upgrade if there was a room available.

The bad review was for the staff with the mobile phone number ending in ************. The hotel said that this person was not from their hotel.

It is recommended that everyone must book a room on the official website or WeChat applet.
Otherwise, the worst is arranged by Ctrip.

If it is not one of the best room types, it is not recommended to stay in the basic room type of Renaissance Hotel. The hygiene of breakfast is worrying, and the whole family had diarrhea after eating.

The hotel has a good garden view. There are many swimming pools, and it is indeed possible to take pictures.

The room service is also very timely. Knowing that we are going to surf in Riyue Bay, we specially put in more water, which is also very warm.
There are many swimming pools in the hotel, and there are few people on the beach. The scenery is beautiful. People like me who don't like to play scenic spots like it. Several friends who have seen my circle of friends have already asked me which hotel it is, and they have recommended it.

The service is thoughtful and warm, and the housekeeper Bruce contacted us in advance to help settle the affairs, and he was active and enthusiastic. The hotel has prepared small bathrobes and cute disposable slippers for the children, which is very attentive. In short, it is very suitable for leisure and relaxation, family trips based on hotels, and staying for a few days feels comfortable and relaxing.

After reading the reviews on the Internet, I didn’t have much hope at first. I didn’t expect Bruce, the hotel butler, to upgrade us as soon as we arrived. Sea view room, the view is invincible! Renaissance's beach is amazing, much better than the other hotel we stayed at last time. Bruce, the housekeeper, is also responsive and caring. My daughter and girlfriends are very satisfied, and the price is high! Five-star praise!

The only regret is that the room allocated to us is rather old. The renovation should be good, but the unrenovated interior has a sense of age. I hope the hotel will be renovated soon.

Service: The service can be said to be great. Sophie at the front desk is really great. She asks about the housing experience every day. She is very considerate
Generally speaking, it is a very suitable hotel for vacation. It is in Haitang Bay, but it is not crowded. The private beach is really not crowded, and the experience is very good. Every day, children will miss seeing the animals in the park. It takes only 3 minutes to drive to the eating places around. It's actually very convenient, and it feels like a quiet place in the midst of the hustle and bustle. I like it very much! It is the hotel I will choose next time!

It is said that Haitang Bay is one of the few beaches where you can tread water (no swimming). The breakfast is also very rich, although not as good as the Ritz-Carlton, haha 😄. The children's area is also very good, although the children are too old to experience it. Before the person arrives, the butler service will come first, and I will come again next time I have a chance.

The experience after check-in was as expected, comfortable and cozy. If the weather can be better, I can really stay here for a long time.
In addition to Marriott's standard multiple swimming pools and fine-sand beaches, the comfort of the room is also very good, spacious and bright, and there are even sofas on the balcony to relax at any time.
In addition, the service is worthy of the Marriott Group, the whole stay process is very smooth, the younger brothers and sisters are warm and welcoming, making people feel like spring breeze.
Thanks to Ms. Eliza at the front desk, who took the initiative to send me the coupons of the Duty Free City. I hope to see you next time!

The family garden view room we booked is two connecting rooms, which is very suitable for the elderly and children. The room is relatively large, and there is a big sofa on the balcony to lie on. It faces the swimming pool and the garden view is also beautiful. This hotel is very suitable for people who want to lie flat. We lay on the beach of the hotel most of the time, my baby just dug the sand on the beach, there are not many people, the beach is quite big, and you can watch the sunrise in the morning. The hotel is about a 15-minute drive from the duty-free shop. It's convenient to go shopping, but it's a bit brain-intensive to eat. Although the hotel is not perfect, like the old cabinets, the water in the bathroom will leak out. But this time there were more surprises overall, the hotel bed and pillows were quite comfortable to sleep on. When we checked out, our butler Lvy liao happened to check out for us. After checking out, he gave us a small gift. Overall, we were very happy here for 3 days.

There are indeed many swimming pools, but the weather in Sanya in December does not have a constant temperature pool. The kids club is ashamed to charge 20 yuan for even such a small trampoline. All children's activities require money, 488 a day, and individual items are also charged. I feel that the hotel is poor and crazy. Second, the room is really big, but the hotel is very old and old. From the corridor to the table and bathroom in the room, it is really not the standard of Renaissance. See the photos for yourself. Third, the location is at the farthest point of Haitang Bay, there is no serious place to eat, and it takes about 50 minutes for takeaway. Will not be coming again, very disappointed

When we arrived at the hotel to check in, the kid was over his height, so he gave us a copy without breakfast.

The hotel has a large area, a wide beach, many swimming pools, and a rich breakfast is what we like. The best thing about this experience is the hotel's service: butler service, front desk, western restaurant, including room and meal reservations are all arranged perfectly. When checking in, there were some situations at the front desk that were quickly resolved and very enthusiastic. The best thing is the romantic dinner on the beach, it is really beautiful! Because of celebrating a special day, I communicated with the western restaurant about the needs, and they were very efficient to help arrange the solution. I heard that many rooms are newly renovated, and the room environment should be better next year. All in all, it was a very happy experience.

The facilities are a little old in hotels in Haitang Bay, but the overall maintenance is good, clean and tidy, and it is a pity that there is no heated swimming pool.

Hygiene: The room, beach, and other areas of the hotel are clean

Environment: The location is in Haitang Bay, the junction of Lingshui and Sanya. It is about 8 kilometers away from the duty-free city. It is very convenient if you drive by yourself. It is suitable for a quiet vacation.

Service: up to the service standard of a five-star hotel

Breakfast: Slightly insufficient, less variety, less refined quality, but enough value for money.

The overall is a cost-effective, quiet and comfortable resort hotel, worth recommending!

Facilities: The equipment is old and the decoration style is not as fast as there are pictures and the truth!
Hygiene: a poor batch, the bath towels have hair, the bathtub is dirty and I dare not use the balcony sofa with stains! Really convinced, a Marriott brand can do it like this, can it really close its doors? Affected by the epidemic, you can't do this, can you?
Environment: There is no hotel, no supermarket, no shopping mall in the surrounding area. Ctrip ordered an upgrade ticket, but the upgraded room still can't see the sea. It's the same as no upgrade, and you can't even get a car when you go out!
Service: Service is what I want to complain about the most. Since the hardware facilities can't keep up, can the software service be better? There is no duty-free shop bus in such a remote place. It is understandable that you cannot enter the hotel lobby during the epidemic. Can you give it away? I've already said that it's not convenient to take it when it's raining outside just after taking a shower. Is this the attitude and standard of star service? If I knew this was the case, it would be better to live in a B&B in the city or Houhai, and come all the way to live in such a bad hotel!
If you come to travel, don't live, it's really bad👎, you will regret it!

Although the hotel is a few years old and some spots can be seen in some places such as the outer wall, the hardware and services are still online.
First of all, thank the housekeeper Snow, who contacted us one day in advance to know the time of our check-in and help us prepare in advance. Some of the requirements made are also actively communicated and coordinated, and are satisfied as much as possible. Thank you very much! After staying for 3 days, it coincided with the landing of Typhoon Siamba. I saw that a hotel in the city was leaking water and power outages. I thought about how bad it would be to live there. Everything is normal here in Wanli. When the rain is heavy, I lie in the room to see the scenery. When the rain is light, I go to the game world to play VR, PS, and bowling. It will not be boring at all.
The hotel's catering level is always online. The set meal you bought comes with a dustpan meal. The taste is very positive. We chose Wenchang roast chicken and Fuji bridge spare ribs, which are particularly appetizing. The chicken was big and juicy, and the meat was so tender that my son couldn't stop one after another. The ribs are also very tasty, and the frying temperature is also quite well controlled, very good bite.
The only thing is that the location is far away. It is already at the junction of Sanya and Lingshui. It is very convenient to drive to live. It is very convenient to go to Linwang Market, 68 Food City, and duty-free shops around.

msg:Seeing the mixed reviews, I still choose to experience the hotel in person. The overall height of the hotel is very Southeast Asian style. The lobby is very high and gives a very open feeling. I thought I could pass the baby, but most of the time I went to the big swimming pool. It was very beautiful and there were not many children. It was very pleasant. I also went to the beach hotel. The seats are indeed not Haitang Bay, but Tufu Bay. I also received Lingshui County. The welcome text is really a turn around and cross the county. There is not much to eat around and takeaways are far away. The hotel restaurant seems to be only open for breakfast, and there is a newly opened Thai restaurant and a cafe. Thai food is very good. Breakfast is good though there are many people There are still people who lead the hotel. The service of the whole hotel is still online, but the room facilities are really old

The hotel's breakfast is very rich, the hotel layout is very suitable for walking after dinner, the beach is also very clean, and there is no stinging feeling when you step on it with bare feet
Unfortunately, all indoor activities have been closed due to the epidemic.

msg:Transportation: The location is far from the hotel group on the duty-free city side. It is relatively quiet, and there is no problem in traveling by car. However, taxis and returning cars are often parked in front of the hotel.

Service: The butler Snow’s service is considerate. Seeing that I brought two not-so-small children, he gave us two extra breakfasts. He recommended several night markets, food streets, and nearby nucleic acid testing points. The thoughtfulness and meticulousness are commendable.

Environment: The hotel has its own beach, there are not many people, there are several swimming pools, suitable for children to play, there is no standard swimming pool. The room is quite satisfactory. After all, it has a certain year, which is acceptable according to the price/performance ratio. The tennis court in the hotel is good, and it can be seen that there is daily maintenance.

Breakfast: Well, it is recommended to avoid busy times. We went there at around 9:30 on the first day, but there was a long queue. The restaurant with too many people didn't feel very good.

The day before the check-in, the housekeeper 👉Ivy Xiao Liao [呲ya] contacted me and asked me when I would arrive at the store. Knowing that I was already in Sanya, I arranged to check in as soon as possible. The check-in was done at 12 noon on the same day, and the day I left. Also arranged for a late check-out, which is very considerate. The hotel's swimming pool is very big and the water is very clear. My son had a good time playing, and the floating meal on the water was also very good. Play in the Game Center during the hottest hours of the day.

The beach and the sea are still beautiful, and it is far away from the hustle and bustle of the hotel on the other side of Atlantis. The sea view room has a beautiful view, the beach is clean, and there are few people. You can run after the crabs without worrying about hitting people. Friends who like quiet can try it. The disadvantage is that there are few living facilities around. If there is no car, it is not convenient to eat and drink in the central area. However, there are farm dishes that are delicious in a 10-minute walk next to it, and the store can also drive to pick up and drop off. It is not far to stroll. It is recommended.

Even if you swim during the day, it will not be exposed to the sun. This is the best. The room is relatively large and the service It's not bad. If you need anything, it can be delivered to the room immediately, but the shower room sometimes leaks water. It may be a design problem. Fortunately, there are bath towels brought from the swimming pool on the ground.

The room smelled a little when you first entered, but within the acceptable range, it is also the smell that the seaside hotel has always had. There was no damp, the bedding was comfortable and the whole room was clean and tidy. The hotel's activities are very rich, and almost cover the needs of all age groups. Our children have a great time. The service of the hotel makes people feel attentive and comfortable. Breakfast is also very rich. The overall value for money is very high. Thanks to the housekeeper, Smith, for helping us upgrade our room. He was considerate and caring throughout the whole process, and also offered to help us pack our luggage.

As a result, Miss Merlin Dong contacted me in advance the day before. As soon as I opened the door, I was pleasantly surprised. The housekeeper specially reserved an open sea view room for us. Thank you so much! All problems encountered after check-in are also solved in time for us! The location of the hotel is a bit biased, but the hardware and software facilities are very good. The breakfast is also delicious haha! Will definitely come again next time!

We lie on the balcony and big sofa every day and watch the sea very comfortable. The swimming pool is very large, and many children have fun there every day , 3 minutes walk from the swimming pool to the beach, the sea view is very magnificent, I wanted to cancel some bad reviews on the Internet before, but fortunately it did not cancel. The breakfast is very rich. It is open until 10:30 in the morning and can be eaten as lunch. There are fried noodles, rice, meat, and various fruits. The floating meal sent is also good and delicious, but if Su looks better, it will be even better, such as adding more flowers, the board looks better, of course, the hotel is not very new, but the price is very high, a new road has been opened, more than It used to be half as fast to go to Atlantis, it used to be 14 kilometers, and now it is 9 kilometers. . , By the way, I recommend a restaurant in Haitang Bay called Buzai Ke's. The suckling pig, boiled shrimp and seafood are delicious and the price is moderate. .

With the same hotel facilities and sea views, other hotels may cost 1,800, while the Renaissance only costs more than 600. At the time, the manager Xiaoxue also upgraded the room type from ordinary sea view to deluxe sea view, and also gave welcome fruit, which is really great. The service of the whole hotel is also very good 👍 I highly recommend everyone to choose Renaissance!

Everyone is very scared, and the hot water for bathing is not good. Warm, Sanya has been very cold these two days. There are many people wearing thin down jackets, but the bath water is only 37 degrees, so after I took a bath, I started to feel cold all over.

msg:During the Spring Festival, the price has increased a lot, the breakfast is very rich, the hotel environment is very good, and you can see the picture yourself. The wall skin of the room feels aging, and the room is relatively large with a first-line sea view. Indeed, only a first-line sea view can be seen in the room. The hotel is in Baifu Bay, the location is relatively remote, the beach is good, but you can't go to the sea.

msg:The hotel is located at the northern end of Haitang Bay. The location is slightly off, but it also has advantages, that is, it is convenient for leisure and vacation, and it is a world of its own. The hotel is a little old, but the overall maintenance is good. Renaissance is a brand under the Marriott Group that I like very much. The service is always online. The check-in was fast, the instructions were clear, the merlin at the front desk was kind and friendly, the housekeeper momo was patient and polite, knowing that my family of 4 was staying, he took the initiative to provide me with children's robes and slippers, as well as fruits and gifts. In addition, as a Marriott member, you also enjoy the trea**ent of free extra breakfast.
Speaking of the overall facilities of the hotel, the swimming pool is large enough, the lawn is wide enough, the children's play facilities are complete, and the private beach is gentle.
There are reclining chairs, shaking beds, bird cages, etc. on the edge of the beach. Lying down quietly and listening to the wind and watching the stars, it is a great pleasure.
Of course, what I appreciate most is the service (it feels better than the Mandarin Oriental I stayed in today), this price is worth the money in Haitang Bay at this time.

msg:A resort hotel with the same style as the Yalong Bay mangrove forest. The hotel is very large, the scenery is beautiful, the swimming pool is very large, facing the sea, the room decoration hardware is old, some rust and damage are normal, the room is also relatively large, there are several restaurants inside the hotel , Slightly expensive, there is a game world and a children's club suitable for children. It takes more than a kilometer to walk outside the hotel to eat seafood. The store can pick up and drop off for free. It is suitable for people who are in the hotel. Garden view room, the room level is determined by the height of the floor. The higher the better, the higher the sea view, the lower the garden view, and the lowest view of the swimming pool. It is 8 kilometers away from the duty-free shop. The sea view is beautiful and the sea water is clean. It is suitable for people who drive by themselves or just want to go to a hotel to swim in the sea. In fact, it is quite biased. The breakfast is rich and there are many tables and chairs, so there will be no queues for meals. The balcony of the hotel room has glass walls and cement walls. It is recommended to have glass walls. It is more transparent. The balcony has an extra-large sofa (not a chair), a chair and a round table. At night, you can drink and eat seafood and enjoy the sea breeze. . People who are especially pursuing intelligence and design should not choose this hotel.
🚗 Transportation: far from duty-free shops
🧹Hygiene: cleaning is slow and manpower is not enough
🍃Environment: Beautiful environment

msg:This is the first time I went to Hainan and drove around the island with my family. Maybe due to the Chinese New Year, the overall service quality and hygienic conditions of Hainan hotels were not good. Objectively speaking, Renaissance is the warmest hotel I have ever stayed in for a ten-day tour around the island. After arriving, the service staff took the initiative to open the door, take luggage and assist in parking. These should be services in Hainan. You have to take the initiative to request or There may not be a requirement, at least during the peak holiday season. Then because I ordered late, I had to wait for 15 minutes before the order arrived at the front desk from Ctrip to the hotel system. During this period, the little brother Bruce at the front desk was very patient and helped me to hold the room on the good floor first, because of the New Year. All rooms are full during the period, and there are long queues for check-in guests. I also read a lot of reviews before booking, saying that the hygiene is not good and the room is wet, but I have not encountered this problem. I went to the Thai restaurant in their garden for dinner. The taste is very authentic and the outdoor environment is good. First, we suggested that we sit indoors to prevent mosquitoes. Knowing that we still want to sit outdoors, I immediately brought mosquito repellent water. Desserts are included to feel the warmth. It was almost ten o'clock after the meal. The path was still a little dark when I wanted to walk around. The hotel staff I met on the road saw us from a distance and immediately turned on the mobile phone flashlight and turned sideways to show us the way. Details determine success or failure, I think the overall feeling is very good, thank you!
The breakfast is also very rich. Seeing me making 2 cups of coffee, the service guy immediately came over with a tray to help me serve it. Sitting outside under the parasol, the fragrance breakfast environment is very comfortable and quiet. I met a foreigner female guest who could not understand the Chinese on some food signs. I translated it for her. I think this is where the hotel needs to improve.
The decoration style of the hotel is very Southeast Asian. I like it very much. The lobby is very a**ospheric and covers a large area. Many swimming pools in the park are connected. There is also a constant temperature swimming pool for children. There are net red swings and road signs, which are very good! Compared with other hotels of the same level nearby, there are relatively few tourists and a good experience!
Due to the itinerary, there was no time for more stops, so we still asked Bruce to do a late check-out for us. The room was very large and the orientation was excellent. I was very satisfied. Looking forward to your next stay!

Overall, it is also a very cost-effective hotel in Sanya, and I will stay again next time if I have the opportunity!

msg:The hotel is really very old. The room smells moldy. The facilities are really old. It's either broken here or there. Anyway, I couldn't sleep for two nights. The most ridiculous thing is that there are so many animals near the swimming pool and the restaurant. They are ugly and disgusting. When I pass by and go back to the room at night, the smell of animal feces really makes me want to vomit! I don't feel like swimming!

The hotel management is very poor, the beach is very dirty, and the beach outside the hotel is not cleaned. There is garbage everywhere!

When I just checked in, someone was sweeping the spider webs on the roof with a broom at the entrance of the lobby! Haha! It's so funny!

The decoration of the hotel is very old, like an ancient palace. There is also very scary music playing in the lobby. Every time I pass by the lobby, I feel very weird! I actually had a nightmare on the second night! It's really scary!

Regarding the check-in procedure, Ctrip has clearly deducted more than 10,000 room fees. When checking in, it will deduct more than 10,000 room fees and more than 2,000 deposits!

Anyway, the reflection of check-in reflects the stinginess of the hotel everywhere! Stay for one day, put two bottles of free water in the bathroom, the refrigerator is empty! Even when staying, they won't put new shower gel, and they won't give new disposable slippers! Our disposable slippers have been hopelessly dirty! At breakfast, the restaurant is reluctant to give guests larger plates, for fear that guests will take too much at one time and waste!

It is not recommended for couples and families with older children to go there. It feels like there are facilities for children of several years old everywhere, and even the beach is specially fenced for children of several years old to play in the sand.

It is recommended that the hotel learn from Hilton's management! Although Hilton is not the best in the industry in my mind.

Including the surrounding food stalls, there is free pick-up and drop-off for meals. There is a celebrity chef’s restaurant that is not expensive for midnight snacks. The per capita carries 100 live fish, which is more convenient than other hotels in the same area.

Just pick and talk about the bad things:
The original water in the room was a bit low, but the sense of room service was excellent. After simple coordination, Smith at the front desk gave three more bottles.
Travel photographers are not professional enough, so this service can actually be omitted.
The overall score is full, and the layout of the toilet also protects privacy, which is more reliable than many similar hotels.

Staying in Renaissance for the second time, the last time Chengdu was really not so good, and I will come here in the future.

Originally planned to stay for only one night, but because this hotel is so comfortable, I stayed for another day!
The price/performance ratio is really high, the hotel is very quiet, and there is a private beach (this is really a super bonus!) After leaving the room, you can go to the beach for a walk and take pictures anytime, anywhere, no tickets, no need to walk a few kilometers, and at the same time The scenery is also beautiful ~ there are large lawns, coconut groves, hammocks, loungers, swimming pools... You can take beautiful photos as much as you like!
In addition, the happiness of the hotel room is also super high! I was lucky enough to meet Karry, the lovely housekeeper, who helped me upgrade to a suite with a swimming pool on the first floor, and gave me a small gift of fruit when I checked in. It was really sweet! The configuration in the room is also super advanced, with a movie-like texture! It completely met all my travel needs.
I thought it would be relatively remote in Haitang Bay, but I didn't expect that there are quite a few takeaways around, and it is also very close to the duty-free shop. If you don't want to eat takeaway, the restaurant in the hotel also has a lot of delicious food. You can eat in the restaurant or have it delivered directly to the room, which is really convenient! The whole is a big love, I will definitely come again next time I go to Sanya~

Although the outside has been renovated, the room facilities It looks old and has a musty smell. The staff cleaning the room is obviously not enough. After the formalities are completed, you can't check in for a long time. This seems to be a common problem in most hotels in Sanya under the epidemic. This point needs to be improved. The service of the Renaissance Hotel is not bad, especially Xiaoxue Snow and the housekeeper Xiao Wang, who are patient and responsive. It is a good choice to drive for a day or two.

msg:Very vacation-like hotel, I chose it for two days, and I came here for vacation. The environment is very quiet, in line with my relaxed psychology, the scenery is superb, the rooms are a bit old, but the whole is very clean, there is no mess Yes, I also read the comments of many people. I personally think that each hotel is unique. If you have a purely critical eye, you will not be in a good mood. I would care about something more. Thank you very much, Smith. , I patiently helped us apply for the duty-free shop discount in advance. I also borrowed a computer to handle the work when I had a temporary job, and helped us upgrade the sea view room. When I opened the window, it was the sea. The environment is great~ I won’t play the video. Yes, the young lady from the Chinese restaurant that I went to helped me prepare ginger syrup. The service is really great, I hope I can do better~ By the way, 5% off tax-free is still very happy, come to Sanya Duty Free City for shopping Don’t miss it~

msg:🍃Environment: The facilities are old, there is mildew on the door of the room, and the wood is lifted. The design is very anti-human. The elevator button is deeply embedded in the gap between two bumps on the wall, and there is a trash can directly below it. I went into the room to take a shower, and found that the sewer was blocked, and the water quickly flooded the bathroom. I called the front desk and asked them to deal with it. As a result, a maintenance master came. It's a waste of time to call the cleaning again.
🔔Service: Poor service, a so-called housekeeper was added to WeChat, but no one was seen during the whole process. No one picked me up when I got off the car at the hotel, no one carried the boxes, and no one sent it when I left. After traveling around in Sanya, this hotel did not upgrade the room, and the Sheraton at Longwan Bay is bigger than others. When I received the welcome fruit, the waiter ignored it. I didn't remember to exchange it for a small card. The breakfast is noisy and there are no seats. When the waiter comes, he will take you to a corner to pick you up. It is also reluctant to ask us to share a table with others and let them clean a table for us. When I left, I checked my luggage, and when I came back to pick it up, the person who kept the luggage was no longer there. It took a long time to call someone to pick up the luggage.
This is the kind of experience. When I checked out, I was too embarrassed to ask me for a good review. This is a good review for you.

The hotel is very large and the room we stayed in is far from the lobby. The front desk staff has good service, and various activities and offers have more detailed and patient instructions. Fruits will be given when you check in, and there will be souvenirs when you check out. Finally, two points are not enough. The room is large, but a bit dated. In addition, the breakfast is a bit monotonous with less variety.

The hotel breakfast is also quite generous, especially the noodles are delicious. The entire Haitang Bay beach is full of waves, which is not suitable for going to the sea. It is nice to walk on the beach and lie under the coconut trees to listen to the sound of the waves.

The hotel’s housekeeper Clark was the hotel’s housekeeper. The service was very attentive. He was very warm. He not only helped to upgrade the room, but also gave the children small gifts. The children were very happy. Later, they helped to make arrangements to extend a room humanely. In the latter case, where the hotel is relatively full, the solution was given to really help guests think about the problem. Locke, the concierge, is also very enthusiastic to help with luggage delivery and lead the way. Thank you! The booked travel shots are also very beautiful. Overall very satisfied!

I visited when the hotel was newly opened in 2011. I was worried that the hotel was old, but it was maintained better than I thought. The service staff...all are more mature, except that the location is slightly off, but because my husband is playing nearby, So it’s okay, but it might be more convenient if you drive by yourself. The hotel arranges a shuttle bus between the airport and the duty-free city. It’s convenient for the hotel to have fresh noodles and noodles for breakfast. The restaurant in the hotel, the newly opened Thai restaurant I like very much, it is worth a try. The ingredients in the Chinese restaurant are also very good.
Parent-child friendly hotel, see many parent-child projects in peak season, please call the hotel for inquiries.

Seeing that there is a parent-child room, it is set, Renaissance is indeed a very cost-effective hotel
When I checked the reviews, I noticed a housekeeper named Bruce
As a result, I met when I checked in and offered to add WeChat
Later in the two days in Renaissance, if there is a need, just send him WeChat.
This is great, call
When I checked in, I brought the kids and gave me a lot of toys and snacks
The customer service is also very good. I saw that I was the clothes and luggage of two children. The next day I cleaned and put two sets of children's products. The details were as small as two pairs of children's slippers. 6666
Come next month👍

msg:Why did I spend an hour thinking about writing this review? Not for anything else, but only for those who want to book in the future as a warning, think twice, and don't repeat my mistakes. Because the itinerary is different, I have changed four hotels in Sanya. This is the only hotel that has to write a review! If it wasn't really bad I wouldn't waste my time writing this review. 1. Wi-Fi: Extremely unstable! Very poor signal! Then why don't I use my own 5G network? No signal here! Yes, your phone has no signal! So you will slide the old machine with turtle speed wifi; 2. Odor: I have to say, the air is so bad that it explodes, the room is old, the bed and door panels are old, musty, peculiar smell, smoke smell, sewage smell... You can't imagine it. You can fully experience the smell here, the ventilation is seriously poor, which directly affects breathing; 3. Air conditioner: the musty smell makes it difficult to breathe, the wind smells, and it smells bad after a few hours of operation, and the heat is turned off and stinks. Blast, open the window, mosquitoes will accompany you all night! 4. Hot water: I haven't used it anyway, I spent the night with cold water; 5. Bathtub: Dusty, yellowed, and yellowish like a toilet, how dare you use it in a hotel? 6. Breakfast: The room does not include breakfast, and the extra fee includes breakfast. After walking half the world, I couldn't find a breakfast shop. During the epidemic, only one restaurant was opened, there were no people on the road, and there were no street signs to drink any instructions. It was all based on intuition. I finally got around to the back door of the restaurant and finally saw the only waiter cleaning the table (this is the third person I saw besides the lobby and the security guard at the entrance), and asked him how to get in the restaurant door. Let's go there, he said he is new and doesn't know where the door of the restaurant is, I laughed; 7. Service: poor! In such a big hotel, half of the people were not met along the way, and there was only one person at the front desk. Asking him everything was "you can see it when you go forward." From entering the gate, you can't find the parking lot. The only security guard sits there and tells you to "go ahead". According to your own feeling, you find the parking lot after going around a few times, and then go around the parking lot to find the elevator. After finding the elevator, I went up and walked a few times to the lobby, then a few times to the guest room, and the next day to the restaurant. Why "go around?", because every elevator in such a big hotel is not connected, you need to take this elevator to the first floor, then walk a long way, transfer to the elevator to the restaurant, come back and transfer to the guest room, and finally walk out of the lobby for a while Dajie, then transfer to the parking lot... The point is, half the waiter can't see you on the way to transfer! It's rare to come across one and tell you to "go ahead...", and there is not a single sign on the road!
Why am I not complaining? I don't want to be bothered, I just want to write this review for everyone to avoid pitfalls. If you think you're willing to waste a lot of money or want to challenge it, or trust the hotel to say that they will improve everything varies from person to person, then you can give it a try, the hardware facilities and business level are here, the same price, or a little more For the money, it must be a good experience to change to another hotel. If you don’t want to have regrets or unhappiness in your journey, please avoid the pit!

Outside the balcony is the swimming pool of China Unicom. The swimming pool is very old and old, and the water is not clean. It feels a bit like a horror movie. Call the front desk and change rooms. The attitude of the front desk was very good and helped me arrange a king-size bed room with a view on the 8th floor. The whole is one corridor after another. It feels like the two of us are staying on the whole floor. No one is angry, and it is very cloudy and not afraid during the day. It was very scary to go back to the room at night, so I asked the younger brother at the front desk to take us back to the room. The younger brother has a good attitude and has sent us back and forth several times. We were going to take the plane at 4 in the morning. It was still dark and the corridor was so long and empty. My sister and I were completely afraid to go out. We called the little brother at the front desk to pick us up and called a car for me. thank you very much.
The whole check-in experience was very bad. It felt like staying in a horrible hotel. The waiter was very good. The plane at 4 o'clock also packed breakfast for us. The overall experience is that the room and hotel are terrible, very old, and the waiter's attitude is very good. At night, I was too scared to turn off the lights or sleep.

1. We drove to the hotel, because we didn’t know the location of the hotel lobby, the security guard at the back door of the lobby remained motionless, which made us think it was not the lobby, so we circled around again. I asked if there was any luggage in the trunk, and after I was informed that it was, help me take it down, I pulled the trunk and walked forward. My husband went to park the car, but the security did not help to close the trunk. The car drove away and stopped me and said hey Your trunk is open.
2. The attitude of the front desk staff is not bad, they sent small gifts and upgraded the room type
3. The hotel swimming pool is very dirty, the water is very muddy, and there are many leaves on the bottom and surface of the water.
4. As soon as I checked into the hotel, I found that there was sand on the bed sheets. I patted it and didn’t take it seriously. As a result, I found that there was sand in the quilt after I went to bed at night. It took a phone call to change it
5. The hotel breakfast is good and rich

msg:A very cost-effective hotel. It has its own sea beach on the front line. The hotel is also very a**ospheric. The hotel lobby is very comfortable from the north to the south. The hotel room is also very large and comfortable. My favorite is the large landscape swimming pool, which is very beautiful. The little brother Bruce, the housekeeper, was also very nice. He took the initiative to help with luggage, presented fruits and specialty snacks, and also helped me upgrade my room. The service is very good. The overall shortcoming is that the hotel is relatively biased, the surrounding facilities are lacking, and the hotel is a bit old. But for this price it is still a good price/performance ratio.

The hotel facilities are also very good. There is also beach volleyball on the beach. There is always a small train for children in the park, which is very suitable for parents and children. There are also some inflatable ducks for water activities in the swimming pool. Children should like it very much.
The room is not cost-effective, and it feels lack of ingredients. I feel that the epidemic has had a big impact on hotels and restaurants. But the beef curry and Tom Yum Goong soup in Thai restaurants are extremely high and have discounts. great!
The front desk of the hotel is also very good. I told the hotel that I forgot to take the gift basket because I was so busy. The hotel gave two snacks. This caring is great.

Also, I received a call from the housekeeper before I arrived at the hotel, and upgraded the room after I arrived. What a surprise!

The gym is not big, but the basics are pretty good. Marriott’s management is great!

Because I am a Marriott member, I upgraded the room type and received a small gift. After arriving at the hotel, Bruce's warm reception felt very caring and convenient. The scenery of the hotel is very magnificent and beautiful, because this time I went to Wanning to learn how to surf, so I only took a few photos when I walked around the hotel. Next time I will choose Renaissance.

The Hainanese chicken rice and dustpan set meals here are very good, and every year they open in Sanya, they must check in and eat! When I came last year, the children’s play area was still being renovated. This year I came to play. It was really a pleasant surprise. The child would cry as soon as he played, and he would never have enough play. The service staff also played with magic balloons to coax you not to cry.

    Summary 1 First of all, thank our handsome butler Bruce from arriving at the front desk cheakin until leaving the hotel. The service is attentive and thoughtful. The smile is sincere and makes people feel at home. Take the initiative to leave the phone or add WeChat to help solve any problems.
              2The hotel’s private beach is beautiful and the garden-view swimming pool is not inferior to other similar hotels in Haitang Bay
              3 Breakfast surprised me. The price of breakfast included was not expected to be high. I thought it was enough to eat, but it actually exceeded expectations. The variety of Chinese and Western styles is rich. The ingredients are high-quality, which is in line with the quality of Renaissance in the group.
              4 After getting off the bus, there was no welcoming staff. The baggage porter was at the peak check-in period in the evening. Hire and experience pure tourists, hoping not to increase prices again 😁)

The hotel also has a free airport bus, which is very convenient. I will choose here next time I come to Sanya!

msg:The hotel I chose was very close to the duty-free shop was helpless, so Ctrip looked for a long time and found that the distance to Renaissance was OK (I finally chose to rent a car). It was about 15 minutes' drive from the street of Haitang North Road. Wanli is relatively quiet. We check in on 10.3
🔔Service: Bruce, the housekeeper, started adding me wx to facilitate communication without getting on the plane. When I arrived at the hotel, I gave the child a small gift and helped me take a few more bottles of water to make milk for the child. He added a crib to the child and gave a little turtle. Because the sprinkler in the room has a little problem, it is a nice guy who takes the trouble to help solve it.
🍃Environment: The benevolent sees the benevolent. I think it is one of the hotels with a good price/performance ratio. The room is big enough for kids running around no problem. We live in a room with a sea view (should be the top floor of the 8th floor). If you can, you must choose the 8th floor with a better view. The beach is very close and only a 2-minute walk away. This hotel seems to have wedding dresses taken every day, and the big lawn and the beach are indeed very popular.
🧹Hygienic: The bed sheets on the first day were a bit sandy...this is really not supposed to be!
It is okay to take children as a whole, especially for children aged 3-8, because many activities are suitable for this age. If it is not for National Day, it should be very cost-effective.

Hotel location: It is very convenient to travel by car. It is only a ten-minute drive away from the duty-free shop and Haitang Bay Water World. If you call for a taxi, there is a taxi waiting to be called at the door of the hotel.
Hotel service: Thank you to the young lady at the front desk, Kate, for upgrading the sea-view room on the top floor for free. The view is amazing. She also warmly presented breakfast coupons, fruit gift packs, and snacks gift packs. The rooms are also decorated with themes. The waiters were also very enthusiastic. After staying for five days, I felt the meticulous care no matter cleaning the room or playing outdoors in the hotel.
Hotel dining: The price-performance ratio of ordering food in Haitang Bay hotels is indeed a bit low. I thought the hotel restaurant would consume a lot of money, but after the experience, I was quite pleasantly surprised. I ordered pizza from the hotel restaurant on the first night of my stay, 12 inches, over 100 It’s not enough for two people, and the breakfast is quite hearty. The little friends who stay in don’t have to worry about eating at all.
Hotel facilities: The hotel room facilities are complete, there is a large private beach on the back, several large and small swimming pools, children's playgrounds, and there are good places to take pictures everywhere.
In short, the experience of these few days at the Renaissance Hotel is superb.

msg:Because I was going to Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop for shopping, I chose the Renaissance Hotel as my shopping destination for the first night. I think the price is very good. We booked a basic room type of 580, but the location of the hotel in Haitang Bay is rather biased. We drive by ourselves. So I think it’s okay that the hotel also has a shuttle bus because it is a few years old, so it is slightly inadequate in terms of hardware. The interior of the room is relatively old. The hotel sales Bruce contacted me in advance and took the initiative to help me upgrade the room type. When we checked out, the hotel staff hoped that we could give a good comment on Ctrip and emphasized that it was a work task. This is also understandable. I promised to return to the new hotel at night and write the result to me every day for two or three consecutive days. Call me to send a message and chase me to review and take a screenshot to give him a screenshot. I really can’t understand the praise. Isn’t it because the guests take the initiative to write from the heart? I hope that the hotel will stop chasing guests in this way. It will be counterproductive.

First, it is very close to the duty-free shop, a ten-minute drive away.
Second, if you only live here for one day, you can book a 5% off duty-free shop in advance, which is very user-friendly.
Third, we came at night, and the front desk gave us an upgraded room for free, and we successfully checked into the poolside room. Fruits have also been upgraded, as well as local snacks.
Fourth, we traveled around the island freely, and it was very comfortable to live here, so we stayed for one more night, and the front desk also helped me to make a renewal discount.
Comprehensive evaluation, very good. But the benevolent see benevolence, the wise see wisdom, don't spray if you don't like it.

The rooms are too unsatisfactory, the facilities are old, the sanitation is worrying, the original decoration is very simple, and the white walls are still covered with stains. And it was extremely humid. I got up in the morning and there was a layer of water on the floor of the room. The clothes I dried were wetter than they were before, and they were rotten for two days.
Besides the good place, the swimming pool is really amazing! It is not an exaggeration to say that it is the hotel with the largest swimming pool in Haitang Bay, and it did not close the pool like most hotels when there were no guests. This is also the benefit of connecting swimming pools. We stayed in six hotels on this trip. Most of the first-tier hotels closed most of the swimming pools under the excuse of the epidemic. We were very disappointed when we came to the swimming pool. But the Renaissance pool is not only open but also maintained by many people.
In terms of service, it is so-so, the attitude of the pool staff is not good, and they appear disrespectful to whistle to the guests. But when we checked out, the front desk heard that our room was a bit damp and immediately sent a small gift, which was not bad.

msg:I have lived in a villa two or three times and this time I came to live in a big suite. The room is good and old, but the scenery and the room are still very good. The downside is that many service staff are not sufficiently service conscious. I live in a total package. Many waiters don't know that breakfast will take the villa guests to take the seat and put us aside to find a place? Afternoon tea in the lobby bar can be hot and give up. The Chinese restaurant waiter needs to be called for a long time to appear. The hotel is old and acceptable, but the service is not keeping up with a little disappointed. . .

The hotel is very big, with many facilities, the swimming pool is super big, and there are children’s amu*****t facilities. Both adults and children can do it. Play in the hotel all day. Special thanks to the housekeeper Bruce, who called one day in advance to arrange the next day's check-in and gave two souvenirs! Next time you come to Sanya, continue to choose Renaissance!

msg:This is the second time staying in Renaissance. Definitely give 120 points of praise. The breakfast is plentiful and the service is particularly attentive. The layout of the room is reasonable, and the sea view room given can see Atlantis, and they can see the fireworks on the balcony. Although the distance from the building to the front desk is relatively long, I later found out that it was actually quite convenient to go straight to the outside to go down to the first floor. The swimming pools are superb. Each swimming pool is equipped with several lifeguards and workstations. It is the most convenient for children to play. Underwater booster, children’s favorite, play every day. Special thanks to the lifeguard Arno. It is the angel my child met during this trip. He patiently guided the use of underwater boosters and helped popularize various coconuts. The children participated in the coconut picking activities every afternoon. Lifeguards The staff of the team are super loving, patient and caring for the children. The children are looking forward to picking coconuts with them every day. They are so happy ~ soaking in the hotel for a whole week without getting bored at all.
I went swimming after breakfast in the morning, took a break in the afternoon, and had a buffet at the hotel in the evening. It was much better than going out to eat. The price-performance ratio was excellent. I brought children to catch crabs in the evening, and I also met a lot of good friends~
I’m tired from work, so I’m suitable to come over and take a break. It is also suitable for bringing children out together. Adults can rest and children can play well.
Next time I go to Sanya, I will continue to live in Renaissance~

Before moving in, he helped to install a children's fence on the large bed in the guest room and added children's toiletries. The hotel also has a children's club, and the package charges are reasonable, which is very suitable for children to play. The best thing is to swim and dig in the sand. The children are still enjoying themselves.

When checking in, Bruce helped to check in. The person was very nice, and he helped answer any questions in time during the stay. The location of the hotel is a bit biased, but the hotel has a shuttle bus to the city and duty-free shops. Others need to take a taxi to the surrounding islands. It's not very convenient to eat around, you can only choose takeaway or hotels. The overall evaluation is ok! This is suitable for people who are away from the noise of the city and enjoy a quiet holiday

We started to book a pool room, and I felt very comfortable when I came in. My husband said that we should take it My parents took it over and enjoyed it for a few days, but unfortunately there was no room with direct access to the pool in the next few days.

From the front desk, it took less than 3 minutes to complete the check-in and gave a small fruit Hainan small gift coconut flakes. The efficiency of the housekeeping staff is really nothing to say.
Guest room: The view is wide, the room is quite spacious, the large bathtub is soaking in the bath and reading a book, the balcony is blowing the sea breeze. Not to mention how comfortable it is
Food: Manager Guo and Master Zhang Stevne who blow up the Chinese restaurant, the hotel has 3 restaurants buffet, Western food, the Chinese restaurant read Dianping and chose a Chinese restaurant, no matter whether it is service or food, I have no more to say, not only give us the details. Introduced the hotel’s facilities, catering, etc., and also actively added my WeChat friend. If you have any questions, you can consult her and help us solve the problems. I feel that the public relations ability is super good, very caring, and the service is comprehensive. Let us do this. This trip felt the warmth of family.
Breakfast: The breakfast at the hotel is rich in variety and fresh ingredients; the waiter will ask what coffee to drink, which is pleasantly surprised. I usually pick it up on the buffet table in other hotels. I encountered a problem with the coffee machine, lily quickly solved it, my feet were a little uncomfortable. I went to see the omelette. The small queue was discouraged and I ate my boiled eggs. There was a chef in less than 5 minutes. I brought 2 double-sided eggs to me. I was so pleasantly surprised that my sister kept asking me to see the name of the master. I was too anxious to see my comment master. Thank you. Really professional.
Coffee bar: Ctrip ordered it and gave me a latte card. The environment is great, and the decoration is very comfortable. Miss Linda and Amanda make nice coffee and they are delicious. I ordered 2 more cups of coffee and gave me a piece. Cheesecake, in a good mood. Listening to the music, the little sisters get together very well.
When I went for a night tour, the younger brother who was looking for the swimming pool took a few bath towels. The younger brother introduced the activities in the pool and taught us how to swim very warmly and politely. Gentlemen teach gentlemen how to teach. Every staff member can see it. Is professionally trained.

msg:There are very few types of breakfast options, and Ctrip bookings are arranged near the door, far away from the city. The hygienic environment is very worrying, flies keep flying on the fruit plate, and it is obvious that the kitchen has the offensive taste of sewage.
The lights in the corridors are very dim, and it can basically be described as "none". And the hotel is relatively large, walking around from the lobby to the room, girls will be a little scared at night. Hotel facilities are relatively outdated.
But it's very close to the beach, the photos are still very nice, and the trip photos sent are not bad.
We checked in and found that one of the bath towels was hung on the bathroom door. It was suspected that it was not cleaned after the tourists left because one of the bath towels was folded and one was hung on the bathroom door.
I booked a double bed room, but it was obviously a double bed room made up of standard rooms. After the two beds were put together, the bedside table could not be reached on both sides, and the mobile phone could not be charged at night.
The room has a slight fragrance as soon as it enters the door, but the fragrance has not been dispersed, and it will be a little uncomfortable for a long time.
The front desk staff are very slow to handle the response and deal with problems slowly.
The only convenience is that there are free buses from duty-free shops and buses from the hotel to the airport.

From the time I entered the hotel, Smith received him very carefully. Caring about the feelings and needs of the store. The hotel is a bit old and the beach is few and clean. Although I can't swim, my son caught a lot of small crabs. He was super happy. He was very satisfied with the swimming pool three times a day, morning, afternoon, and evening without having to go to any scenic spots. The only downside is that it’s a bit remote and it’s inconvenient to buy some food and drinks around to eat. If you have a chance, I will choose here for a holiday next time.

Before coming this time, I searched the entire Haitang Bay Hotel and found a super cost-effective Renaissance. Except for the location a little bit, the starlight swimming pool and the private beach, it fully met our expectations! When I checked in, the guy at the front desk was very friendly and helped to upgrade the c sea-view room. When I got up early in the morning, the sun was spreading on the sea, and the shadow of the coconut trees on the sea was endless. Back to Phuket in a second! The hotel itself is also a scenic line, the lobby can directly see the sea, the symbol of Marriott Seaview Hotel! There are also water slides that the baby is thinking about. There is no one yet, and it is almost reserved. Thinking of the overcrowded Yate, I feel that the price is too high! In the evening, the setting sun is shining on the sea, the hammock is lying down, the swing is framed, and there is a small attic where you can climb up to look out at the sea, as an observation deck! The bedding is very comfortable, the breakfast is very fresh, and the yogurt is freshly made, which is much better than other products! My dad said he would come here for vacation next time, haha!

msg:I believe that the hotel side is already anxiously waiting for my negative comment. To tell the truth, this is really not my intention. As a person in the industry, I am well aware of the hardships and difficulties of hotel employees since the epidemic, but this time it is very simple. A business trip turned out to be a mess. I also hope that this result makes the hotel take seriously in its operational work:
1. Arrived at the hotel at 1:30 in the afternoon. I wanted to take a room to take a rest and go out for a meeting, but it was said that I could check in after 3:00. Now the room is still being cleaned. I think the hotel business will not be so good during the epidemic period. The day before, I stayed at Haikou Marriott at this time of the afternoon. Everything was arranged properly. There was also an exclusive front desk butler who contacted me. It is also a hotel under the Marriott Group. Why is there such a big difference? I also asked casually why there is no such service ambassador. The girl at the front desk said that we had called, but you didn't answer. You must know that Haikou Marriott also called me three times before finding me. There is no harm if there is no comparison... ...then asked for a deposit, but Ctrip's bookings all stated that the deposit is free including welcome fruit, and no deposit was charged after confirmation, which not only reminded me of the smooth and professional check-in at Haikou Marriott.
2. My colleagues and I can only store luggage and choose to go to the restaurant to eat something. The hotel is too big. The hotel concierge pointed us in the direction, but we still got lost. We guess the other half of the hotel may be closed due to the epidemic, because The elevator doesn't work. I have seen many other hotels' measures in this regard. There are fences, signs, and manual guidance. The Renaissance Hotel has nothing, so we walked a lot of wrong roads, and finally found the one to go to the restaurant. The elevator, when we entered the elevator, it was suddenly pitch black. After the elevator was closed, nothing could be seen, which scared my petite female colleague. After the elevator arrived, we saw the cleaning aunt, and we immediately reported to her. , and told that it was very dangerous. Auntie just said something lightly: I know, we were very speechless at the time, and such a big engineering problem even allowed it to continue to operate. My female colleague wrote dissatisfaction in the subsequent Ctrip service survey. , and then the Ctrip staff immediately called and said that they would communicate with the hotel immediately. After a long time, my female colleague received a call from the hotel. According to my colleague, the other party's tone was not sullen. Apologies, my colleagues and I did not feel the urge to write a bad review until this time. After all, every hotel has room for improvement, but it was the next morning that finally stimulated us.
3. The next morning we went to the front desk to pick up the invoice. An assistant lobby manager was also very decent. When I asked for a mask for each of my colleagues and I, the assistant manager's answer shocked me: we don't serve guests. Masks are provided, and I can take you to the place where you purchased them by scanning the code, because our employees also bought the masks themselves. During the epidemic period, I have stayed in many different types of hotels, including luxury, mid-range, and economic chains. It is the first time I have encountered that they do not provide mask service. This time I stayed at a luxury hotel in Haitang Bay! Out of curiosity, I also asked the waiter in the restaurant, they said that the mask is provided by the hotel, I really can't help laughing a little bit!
The bad review this time stems from the most direct comparison. The unforgettable experience of Haikou Marriott intersects with it, and the difference is too great. This is cruel market competition. The Renaissance Hotel may be a little old, but the scale and state of the entire resort product It is still very shocking and worth trying. I hope that the software will continue to improve, and I wish the hotel a better future.

房間很大很乾凈，各項需要的用品都很齊全，床睡起來也很舒適～
室外設施也很漂亮，很多拍照點，出門就是海邊，還免費設定了很多躺椅，真的很不錯呢！
三亞海棠灣萬利度假酒店真的是超值的酒店，會再次光臨的哦，也會推薦給其他朋友的～

酒店不是那種很現代化的簡約風格，建築有着磚瓦、石像元素，綠化面積大而漂亮，風格悠閑適合度假。酒店房間比較大，設施沒有很老舊，池畔房直接出門游泳也很舒服。園區散步也有很多打卡的地方。早餐很豐富，有粉，煎餅，甜品等現做的吃的。床睡着也很舒服，總體特別滿意，謝謝管家gary的安排，旅途很開心。
萬麗海灘算海棠灣比較大的，不過海棠灣沙子不是很細，也有些水草。另外池畔房隔音比較一般，歡迎水果能裝盤子送房間就更好了。

環境：環境還可以，就是繞來繞去的在裏面走來走去特別累，周邊比較荒，沒什麼飯店便利店這些。離免税店開車還得20分鐘車程。
衞生：還可以，酒店綠化好就會蟲子多，還捏死一衹隱翅蟲。
服務：免費升級了海景房，淡季的話挺便宜的。性價比挺高的，早飯種類不多，也不是特別好吃。在三亞這麼卷旅遊的地方，屬於中等吧。

前台美女很靠譜，管家也是有問必答。還有童星俱樂部也不錯，陪伴的老師很認真負責。孩子玩的很開心

msg:不好意思，來評價晚啦。行程的最後一站選擇了萬麗酒店，上次來三亞沒有到海棠灣，這次感受一下。先説酒店的優點：
1.酒店前台也是我們的管家Eliza還有一個前台小哥的服務好很好很熱情🔥。因為這次帶着父母定了兩個房間，還給升級了房型。
2. 海景房的房間很寬敞舒適。陽台有觀景沙發，盥洗室是雙人位還有臨窗浴缸🛁。採光很好化粧方便~
3.酒店早餐有室外用餐區，種類尚可。附近還有小動物可以餵食，親子活動豐富。
4.酒店有私人海灘，直達海邊（可惜不能下海）。還有海邊鞦韆座椅等多種設施休閑使用。
還可以再完善的地方：1.酒店有的房間潮氣味確實重，有的房間可能陽光充足就沒什麼味道。2.酒店門口無指引無禮賓，穿過過道才有人幫忙搬行李，很多人下車後都手足無措。3.酒店泳池很大，但無恆温，12月還是挺冷的。泳池上項目也可以增加些項目，加強住客參與趣味性，像槳板浮毯亞龍灣很多酒店都有且不另計費的。

我們來之前都沒有做規劃，所有行程都是來了再想。還好我們的酒店管家小童有細心介紹不同遊玩的地方，也推薦了附近好吃的宵夜，來當地旅行有許多困難也第一時間幫我們解決了。真的非常貼心👍🏻

環境：已經做好位置偏僻，裝修老舊準備，但是不到700含雙早的價格，各類配套設施齊全，如大泳池，私人海灘，遊樂中心等等，性價比超高了～
 ps 晚上至少有三衹壁虎在房間裏共眠，不害怕，都是益蟲

設施：泳池超大，而且很乾凈。冰激凌車提前一小時下班，沒吃着！

免税店班車：哈哈如果來回都要坐的話，衹有一個半小時多點購物時間，還好我沒什麼要買的～隨便看看

送的遊樂中心：送了半小時，玩的很多，除了保齡球等不能，其他都可。後來又加錢打了一小時乒乓，度假感拉滿了～才50一小時，也不貴～

送的火烈鳥優惠券：折扣後性價比也很高，挺好吃的，除了大堂吧有點熱

送的旅拍：很差評了好吧。我以為是婚紗照模式，拍的好多選幾張，結果去了直接讓你選加錢好好拍，或者隨便拍五張。有點無語，都不知道技術咋樣，所以選擇後者，然後不到一分鐘，隨便拍了五張，曝光得海都看不見了。

總體來説，很棒呀！

酒店的服務很棒，管家Anson服務很贊！早餐種類很多，泳池很大，沙灘很寬，撿了貝殼、沙蟹，還有免費旅拍，離免税店有班車。強烈推薦大家預訂這家酒店，有機會來三亞我還住海棠灣萬麗❤️❤️❤️

酒店設施齊全，雖然有些舊了，相對於價格來説，完全OK！酒店的服務人員態度熱情，看到有小朋友，我們入住和離店都幫忙提行李，問詢也都及時答覆。
餐廳的話，推薦泰餐廳，小童套餐鮮蝦餛飩太好吃了！海鮮類的菜都是新鮮現殺現做的，比較放心。我們晚餐基本上都是在酒店吃的，萬豪金卡還可以打八折噢！
小童遊樂園的工作人員也很有耐心，那邊的玩具比較適合低齡孩子。下雨的話就帶去那邊放電，可以玩好久！

酒店的海景房房間寬敞明亮，裝飾典雅，從窗外望出去可以欣賞到壯觀的海景，簡直是一種享受。喜歡酒店的整體氛圍，中式風格，泳池超大，各種遊樂設施都有，囊括大人小孩，非常放鬆。

我要表揚一下工作人員momo和yuky，非常熱情友好，早上九點多出發去機場，生理期提前了，酒店商店沒到開門時間，買不到衞生用品，求助前台，她們兩個很熱心幫我提供，真的很感激她們的幫助。

另外，管家snow也給我留下了深刻的印象。她是一個非常專業和細心的員工，在我入住期間提供了出色的客房服務。她經常確保房間的整潔和舒適，並且隨時為提供所需的物品和服務。

海棠灣萬麗酒店是一個值得推薦的住宿選擇。期待着再次入住這家酒店，並且會向朋友和家人們推薦他們選擇這家酒店。

1、訂了之後看了好多差評，又不能退很着急，到了之後發現房間蠻好的，乾淨整潔，房門確實有的破😁如果要求不是特別特別高的，我覺得算蠻好的了
2、我要給酒店的沙灘100分，很適合度假，沙灘乾淨細軟，視野很開闊，工作人員很好，小朋友可以借小童樂園的挖沙工具，最關鍵的是因為遠所以沙灘人不多
3、這一家真的泳池覆蓋率很高
4、隔音真的是好多酒店的通病，第二天樓上來了個調皮的孩子和嬰兒，真的沒休息好，但是管家小童給延時了，多休息了一會
  
很適合度假想要安靜的

1、設施，確實老了一些，但該有的都有，乾淨衞生沒有問題，希望酒店能儘快升級改造。最好增加室外恆温泳池。這個相比於喜來登、威斯汀可能有不足吧。
2、位置，因為在市區邊上，外賣和其它可能不太方便，但開車來説 離市區和免税店都很近，不是太大問題，反而人少了海灘清靜。
3、人員，前台接待小姐姐非常盡責，也很温柔，看孩子小 特意申請了延遲退房，離店還送了小寶寶拼圖，非常感謝；樓道清掃很盡責，尤其是東北大叔跟我問好時有一種另類的喜感。
4、餐飲，早餐不錯，麪包種類很多，缺點人稍微多一些，希望多開幾個餐廳來供應早餐。缺點，沒有寶寶餐，可能其它酒店也有這個問題，現在親子出遊非常普遍了，建議酒店單賣寶寶餐，可以去北京、上海取下經，看看一線城市的寶寶餐是如何供應的。
5、環境，依然很美，帶娃實在沒時間拍照。但高樓層夜景真的很美。

msg:整體酒店偏老，綠化有點疏於維護的感覺。不過對得起價格。對品質要求不高的話，性價比還可以。不過我入住第一天被咬了8個包。很可怕。臨時問酒店借個花露水還有點困難😓。衹怪自己準備不充分。

msg:都説萬麗偏僻又舊，可我覺得一切都很好。乾淨衞生！管家小童很專業，服務熱情有耐心，解決問題及時！酒店的私家沙灘很近，沙子也很細，沙灘上的保安大哥兢兢業業，來回巡視，讓帶孩子的老母親很安心！體驗了泳池槳板，教練哥哥很有耐心，孩子很喜歡！小童泳池雖然衹開了一個滑梯，可對於孩子來説，也足夠開心了！

msg:三亞第一晚選擇了入住萬麗，體驗後發現沒有選錯，推薦入住。
  入住前一天管家小童便聯繫我，加我微信，提前確認我的行程，入住當天前台kate熱情禮貌的幫我辦理了入住並給我做了免費升級為池畔房，房間超乎我的想象，三亞本來炎熱，但是一開房間感覺無比的涼快，房間外面有池畔客人專屬的泳池，不用去公共泳池，原本因為看不到海景還有點失望，但是看到泳池十分驚喜， 房間的也很大有很多的貼心的小細節，不一一列舉，酒店門口就是海灘，一望無遺的海景在酒店大堂就可以看到。
  退房時還贈送了我小禮物，十分感激，
  唯一的不足是酒店太大啦，住在A棟想去地下車庫拿東西，來回走到腳耙😊
