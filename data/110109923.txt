msg:Pro
+ It is a new and beautiful place to stay.
+ Very kind, friendly and polite staff.
+ Spacious bathroom. 
+ When leaving early the taxi driver can pick you up in front of the hotel. 

Cons
— The hotel is too expensive.
— Not a smoke free hotel. There was even smoke inside the lobby and the second night it was all over our room too (airconditioning?). 
— The first night we tried the dinner, but it was not good. They have photos of the food, but it doesn’t match with what you get. We ordered salmon sushi and got FROZEN sushi instead which was obviously not eatable.  
— When we asked for a tea on the terrace we were charged 48 Yuan per person which is way too expensive.
— The bedroom is a bit too small and has the same size as the bathroom.

msg:Very satisfied! New hotel, very simple appearance, good hardware inside. When booking, I hesitated with TOP1, then I saw the newly opened one, and the comments also said that it was jointly opened by a state-owned enterprise, which is more a**ospheric than ordinary B&Bs. The small refrigerator gave drinks, not Coke and Sprite, the sour plum soup is delicious, the washing is very good, even the toilet paper is Xinxiangyin, and the water is Evian.
Facilities: There is a bar on the roof, and there is a very interesting fish pond. It is a transparent glass pool on the top of the first floor. The pillows and mattresses are very good for sleeping. There is a tea table, sandalwood is given, and the bathtub has rose petals in addition to bath salts
Hygiene: Very clean! Newly opened, nothing to say
Environment: The location is next to the county government office of the ancient city scenic spot. The street is noisy, but it is very quiet when you enter the hotel, and the room is also quiet
Service: Very enthusiastic from the moment you enter the door, and even upgraded my room type. Seeing that I was taking pictures, he took the initiative to take me to visit the upstairs and the top floor
Dining: The hotel's restaurant is a treasure. We were too lazy to go out during dinner time, so the manager recommended their own restaurant. We went there with the mentality that as long as the food was not bad, we ordered four dishes for more than 300 yuan for two people! We finished it all! This chef made ordinary food really extraordinary! ! There is also exquisite plating, highly recommended to try!

msg:The hotel is in a prime location, diagonally opposite the ancient county government office, in the busiest place in the ancient city, and it is convenient to go anywhere. Especially in the early morning, you can take advantage of the few tourists and look around quietly. It is worth mentioning that the hotel's catering. I originally planned to go to the popular restaurant Hongwuji for dinner, but there were too many people. I had to wait for more than 2 hours after getting the number. Later, I changed to dining in the hotel. I didn't expect the hotel's catering dishes to be exquisite and taste very good. The waiters were very enthusiastic. I would like to give a thumbs up to the service of the restaurant waiter Guo Tiehua. It's a bit regrettable that I booked two rooms. When I booked on April 1, the room price was 778 yuan, and on April 15, the room price rose to 1,600 yuan. But the flaws do not outweigh the merits, so I still give it five points.

msg:The hotel is in a very good location, in the core of the ancient city. It is very convenient to eat and visit the ancient city. The room is a renovation of an ancient house, which is very distinctive.
Facilities: It is the best in the local area
Hygiene: The hygiene is also good, but the room aunt forgot to put the bath towel, which needs to be paid attention to by the management.
Environment: Very comfortable, and the photos are also very good
Service: The customer service WeChat reply is very timely, and all questions are answered.
Although there were some small episodes in the middle, it was still solved happily. Thank you for the small gift from the room manager, which is very thoughtful. In addition, the breakfast needs to be strengthened a little bit. The breakfast for this room rate is a bit substandard. The hotel can also dine, and the knife-cut noodles are very delicious. As a frequent traveler, I still hope that the management will get better and better, and the hotel will get better and better. I will choose here again next time

msg:Planning to go to Pingyao Ancient City and surrounding attractions on the New Year's Eve of the Year of the Dragon, the choice of accommodation during the Spring Festival is extremely important. It must be warm, comfortable, spacious and suitable for watching the Spring Festival Gala. After comparing Pingyao hotels on Ctrip, I chose Xinghua Village. I contacted the hotel. The lady who answered the phone was very patient and explained the layout of the hotel and the location and function of several special rooms. Ctrip happened to have a package, so I booked it happily. On the day of check-in, the hotel sent a very thoughtful message to remind the weather precautions of the journey. When we arrived outside the city, the hotel sent a battery car to pick up the guests into the ancient city. When we arrived at the county government, it was opposite the hotel. The entrance lobby was designed to be bright and elegant. The ancient and charming hotel architectural design created by Shanxi Cultural Tourism and Fenjiu Group is integrated with Pingyao Ancient City. The atrium has added the element of water, which is simple and smart. The red lanterns hanging high under the eaves are the unique characteristics of Shanxi courtyards. There is also a large platform behind the second floor, which can overlook half of the ancient city. In summer, drinking and chatting here to watch the gray bricks and tiles of the ancient city, it should be very pleasant to stop for thousands of years. There is also an electric heater in the room, which is very considerate. After visiting the ancient city, I returned to the room early, made tea and set out snacks, and watched the Spring Festival Gala of the Year of the Dragon! Of course, I noticed that Xiao Ni hid behind Liu Qian when he announced the bottom of the cards. This episode also left a deep impression on the New Year's Eve of the Year of the Dragon in Xinghua Village. Before leaving, the hotel staff also gave tea gifts, and the New Year started beautifully.

Half of the houses in Pingyao Ancient City are vacant, the owners have moved out, it’s snowing, and the roads are a bit slippery. I walked around during the day and again at night. All the meat I couldn't eat was fed to the cats and dogs in the ancient city.

msg:Probably the best hotel in the ancient city
Facilities and environment: new and clean, with complete facilities and antique style.
Location: Excellent, 30m away from the county government office.
Catering: Generally speaking, the breakfast room is a bit cold, maybe because there are few customers. Breakfast is not a buffet, but a meal. Compared with the price of breakfast, it is barely enough.
Entertainment: I participated in the activity of finding gold coins and received lunch/dinner. The only regret was that the steak was a very thin quick-frozen steak, which was a bit inconsistent with the hotel's grade.
Service: Very good, both the front desk and room service greet you warmly.

He took us to visit the inn and introduced us that the inn is a cooperation between the Provincial Cultural Tourism and Fenjiu. My partner said that only state-owned enterprises can be so generous. The observation deck on the second floor is very suitable for taking pictures. There is an open-air tavern on the third floor. The manager told us that because it is newly opened, the staff service is still improving little by little. I think it is very good to have such an attitude👍It has not been ranked on Ctrip when it just opened. It is estimated that it will not take long for it to become one of the best inns.

The front desk service attitude was very good, but the shuttle bus driver was average.
The room is large and empty, so I suggest that the hotel not save space. There is not even a table to put the suitcase. If it is not placed on the desk, it can only be placed on the floor. The layout is also a bit strange. The desk is next to the door and the vase blocks the TV screen.
The breakfast is a bit basic. After all, it is a new hotel. I feel that there is still a gap between the staff management and the old five-star hotels. I saw a manager who is not sure whether he is a waiter or a temporary waiter who can't even use a soymilk machine?
Many facilities are not open, such as the gym and self-service laundry room. After walking around the breakfast room, I feel that the hotel is not fully built.

酒店雖然在喧鬧的大街上，但一點都不覺得吵鬧，去哪都方便，累了還可以回來休息。
前台工作人員接待親切解答各種問題，小侯帥哥每次都熱情有禮，臨走還幫提行李送我們上車。
酒店提供早餐也適合我們南方人的口味。
晚餐我們也在酒店餐廳解決，精緻又不貴，最遺憾是不知道酒店送了一張50元餐券，無用上😂
下次來平遙古城繼續會選擇這間客棧👍🏻

不太滿意的地方就是看到之前評價的沙棘汁和嬰兒水，不知道是因為我們買的是優惠套餐的原因還是其他原因，都是沒有的，衹有一瓶大的怡寶，minibar衹有一瓶冰紅茶 一瓶水溶c一聽蘇打水和一聽紅牛。水果第一天是一個蘋果加五顆小番茄，第二天是兩塊平遙牛肉加幾顆小番茄。
早餐完全達不到五星的水準，隨便吃吃吧…
二層有好多拍照的客人，房間隔音不好所以特別吵，影響休息，是不是應該考慮一下怎麼管理。
所謂三層鳥瞰半個古城，評價也是有水分，其實啥也看不到。
