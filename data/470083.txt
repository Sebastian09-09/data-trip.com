msg:The grounds and room were beautiful, room service was efficient but I want to give a special thanks to Joe Torres who went above and beyond. I normally never ever write reviews but this time i felt I had to. We had a minor issue in the room which Joe resolved super quick and efficiently but he went above and beyond to make sure our stay was a memorable one. Of course an upgrade was nice but it was more the little details like asking what time we were checking out so he could send us off and a thoughtful leaving gift that were special touches. His warmth, sincerity and efficiency is the gold standard - and I can't remember meeting anyone better in the hospitality industry in my 14 years here in China and I have stayed in all the major 5 star hotels in shanghai and beijing.

msg:We spent 4 nights at Raffles Hainan during Christmas holidays with my family and definitely it's the best experience we had in Hainan. We have tried several hotels in Sanya but none of them can be compared to Raffles. The resort is located in a privileged place, probably one of the few paradise left in entire Hainan. White and sandy beach, plus extremely clean. 

Before my arrival, I got in touch with the Spanish speaking manager, Joe Torres who made sure and went above and beyond to make sure my arrival was smooth and without any complications (Due Covid situation). Upon my arrival we were greeted by Joe Torres who arranged everything and promptly introduced our personal Butler, also named Joe. We had a fantastic room with phenomeal view to the sea, extremely clean, welcome decorations on our bed in Spanish (Nice and unique touch) and cute Christmas welcome amenities. The hotel looks in good shape even if it's already 8 years old.

Breakfast was fantastic, probably the best I'ever had in Sanya with a wide selection of chinese and western options. My egg benedict was cooked on point and my daugther was delighted by the extensive pastry option. Also, big thank you to Jane & Eric, managers at the restaurant who took care of my dining during my stay.

The lounge bar at the pool was my way to go when to have some food, for it's unique vibe and accessibility to the pool. I totally recommend their fried noodles and club sandwich. Quesadillas and tuna sandwich were not to my taste.

Overall we had a fantastic christmas vacation with my entire family and thank the entire team at Raffles Hainan for make sure me and family had a smooth holidays. We will definitely come back and I totally recommend this place to those who look for privacy, quiteness and unique high end service.

Our personal room manager Diana was helpful 24/7 in any detail or assistance we needed.
At first, our room had a humidity smell coming from some furniture ( kinda normal due to the climate there ) so she offered us a room upgrade to the Junior suite which was fabulous.
The restaurant and breakfast area were clean and with a nice variety of choices.
All the hotel’s staff were very kind and attentive.
The location was very peaceful and convenient as you can reach Haitang bay and Wanning within 40-50 minutes of driving.
Closing up, its been a fabulous experience and pleasure to stay at Raffles Hainan. We’ll go there for sure on our next holiday.

msg:The raffles Hainan is fabulous. I really love it’s location right next to the beautiful white sand beach. I also appreciate it is a little further out of Sanya making it very quiet and relaxing. The service is exceptional. Upon checking in we were greeted by Joe, who spoke perfect English and invited us to connect on wechat so he could take care of whatever we needed. Whenever my friends and I needed something arranged or delivered, Joe was on top of it. He is exceptional at his job. We also had massages at the Raffles spa. The service and experience were relaxing and beautiful. My room was spacious with a great view of the ocean. The food is great with both western and Chinese options. There are also 2 pools to relax beside, both with beautiful and clear blue water. Also, the pools were not that crowded, allowing you lots of privacy and room. I’d highly recommend The Raffles Hainan. 5 star service, location, and experience.

The hotel connected us with Joe who went above and beyond to make sure our stay was everything we wanted it to be. He even organized a birthday cake for our friend’s bday. The grounds were beautiful and well kept and even though it was a busy weekend, the hotel and beach never felt over crowded. There was a lifeguard at the beach and swimming was allowed which was a pleasant surprise for a beach in Sanya. The Breakfast was extensive and had many great western options. We also enjoyed a wonderful morning at the spa. We will definitely be back to stay at the Raffles!

The best experience in Sanya ever! 
We have  tried more than 15 five stars  hotels in Sanya but no one can be compared with Raffles.
Very clean room and public areas, great service, beautiful swimming pools, white sandy beach and quite environment.
We also got lucky to meet  an Italian speaking manager, Joe, who assisted us during our stay.
Strongly recommend to try Raffles Hotel!

The hotel territory is beautiful and cozy and the pool is amazing (we spent hours by the pool). The staff is trying to satisfy all of your wishes, friendly and polite. The breakfast buffet was delicious, it has lots of options, so we tried something new every day. Would recommend visiting Long bar and enjoy a cocktail on a balcony overlooking the sea. Apparently the hotel stopped providing visitors with toothbrushes since August, but when we asked the toothbrush were delivered to our room. Still it’s good to keep this new policy in mind and bring your own necessities. Would definitely stay at this hotel if we ever travel to lingshui again.

Although the place is large, it is very close to the beach, and it is very convenient to walk. It can be reached in minutes~ The most praiseworthy thing is the service. The handsome Darryl is really a super warm man! He contacted me the day before check-in, added WeChat, and asked about my needs in detail. It rained on the day of arrival, and he personally held an umbrella and waited at the entrance of the hotel. I was moved! Because it was to celebrate my brother's birthday, after communicating in advance, Darryl not only decorated the room, but also made a cake for him, which was full of surprises! The key is that Darryl's taste is really unique. The room is decorated with a special atmosphere, not perfunctory or low, it is too high-end! The cake is also full of ingenuity to make a shape, everything is unexpectedly perfect! I will stay here again next time for Darryl! Picture 3 is a romantic nightfall ceremony, Picture 4 is a delicious breakfast, Picture 5 is the Southeast Asian style of the hotel, and Pictures 6-7 are the sea views seen in the room

The breakfast and beach dinner buffets were a little less, and the Baiwei Chinese restaurant tasted good. The hotel is very large (a bit strenuous haha), the travel photography effect is good, the gym equipment is also quite complete, the suite room is very large, the private swimming pool is very clean, but a little shallow. The housekeeper Xiao Yao upgraded our room. My wife was bitten by mosquitoes and the housekeeper handled it in time, and gave her a gift before leaving.

What is commendable is that after eating the seafood buffet at the beach, my husband, who has a sensitive stomach, did not have diarrhea. When eating at the beach, the service of the staff can be regarded as the ceiling in China. Before the meal time, seeing that we brought our children, they brought delicious ice cream for the children. Another person should be the executive chef. He said that if you bring your children, you can go to get the food first, and you don’t have to wait until the meal time, so as not to starve the children. 👍👍Just after May Day, all hotels are in the off-season. We walked around and stayed in four hotels. The room rates were all 2000+ per night, and the service was all bad. Only this hotel, whether from the front desk, housekeeper, or service staff met on the road, all the staff are online. This trip is about to end, and I must come to give a good review and come again next time.

The hotel is located in the middle of the Clearwater Bay tourist area, and it is also a good place to walk along the coastline to the lighthouse. It is strongly recommended that children who bring their children to play choose a pool room. After playing in the hotel's children's pool, they can continue to play in the room... They can't stop at all!

After staying for two nights, the children still clamored to come again during the summer vacation, haha, they all love it!

Many facilities in the house are a bit old, but it is very clean. The cleaning staff tidy up every day. The water heater in the room is a bit unstable. It is hot and cold when taking a shower. The temperature in the room is suitable, and the dry and wet are separated.
The beautiful housekeeper Diana is very enthusiastic and careful, and responds very quickly. When we just checked in, she explained the hotel facilities, restaurants, paradise beach, etc. in detail, and drove a shuttle bus to take us to visit the garden. My husband's legs were bitten by insects and pus was flowing. She quickly took oin**ent and gave children gifts. The children especially like to sleep in their arms.
You can order children's meals directly in the room. My baby likes wonton noodles very much. The taste is light and delicious.
I will choose this place again when I come to Clearwater Bay. The big brother who manages the beach is very serious and responsible. Non-hotel guests are not allowed to lie on the lounge chairs, so there are always empty lounge chairs.
The only regret I have this time is that the breakfast room is a bit of a letdown. On the first day I went there to eat, the waiter didn't even clean the table and it was all greasy and he had to put the cutlery there. There were no children's bibs and cutlery, only baby chairs. When I think of the facilities, I have to praise the bathroom facilities, which are very complete, with baby footstools, diaper changing tables, and they are very clean. The service staff in the store are great except for the breakfast room.

msg:At the beginning, the room was upgraded. Even though the front desk knew about the upgrade, they still asked me to collect the fireside ice tea coupon that was originally included in the hotel booking. They did not tell me that I could not use this after the room was upgraded. After arriving in the room, I contacted the housekeeper to use this fireside ice tea. The housekeeper first asked me if I had made an appoin**ent. I said no, and then told me that because the room was upgraded, I could not use this. They said that this required a special small table. I couldn't figure it out. It's not a fireside tea, no fire or boiling, just afternoon tea snacks, what table is needed. Anyway, it can't be used. Why didn't the front desk inform me when opening the room and let me collect the coupon?
Also, this time I came to celebrate my husband's birthday, and informed the hotel in advance. The hotel said that they could give a simple decoration and a birthday cake. After arriving in the room, there was not only no decoration, but also no birthday cake. When I asked the housekeeper, the housekeeper said he would arrange it. I said that it would be arranged at the beach dinner the next day, and the cake would be eaten there. The housekeeper also said that it was no problem and he would arrange it. In the end, there was nothing, no decoration, and no cake. This is the service of this hotel. Everyone can decide for themselves.
And there are so many small bugs in the room, it’s no exaggeration, small bugs are flying all over the room.

Due to the change in check-in time, the housekeeper Diana coordinated and arranged for us in advance, and upgraded the suite to 270 square meters, double balconies, and a panoramic view of the endless sea... I instantly felt spacious and comfortable... Welcome fruits and drinks upon check-in... Children's items are also prepared and sufficient for use... Disadvantages: It is too big, the park is large, and it takes a long distance to get to the beach, and the breakfast is not so rich...
Because there are not many people at this time, the main focus is to lie down and win a beautiful mood... Of course, I will definitely ask the housekeeper Diana to arrange it next time I come

First of all, I want to say that the environment of this hotel is very comfortable and the facilities are complete, which left a deep impression on me.
Miss Diana is very considerate. Because it is my birthday, she specially helped me decorate it and prepared a little surprise. It is so detailed and super heartwarming! The facilities of the hotel are also very complete. The rooms are spacious and bright, and the beds are comfortable, which made us spend a pleasant night here. Overall, I am very satisfied with the stay experience of the Raffles Clearwater Bay. I will recommend this hotel to my friends and look forward to staying again next time. If there is a chance, I hope that the hotel can continue to maintain this high-quality service so that every guest can have a pleasant holiday here.

The garden design of Raffles is very Southeast Asian style, and the beach is soft and unmatched by Sanya Beach. The hotel is very large, there are not many guests, and the environment is very quiet. Suitable for those who want to get away from the hustle and bustle.
The butler Coco was very welcoming and even gave me a gift when I left.
All in all, Raffles is a very stylish hotel worth recommending.

Service: First of all, I am very grateful to Miss Diana for upgrading our room to a family suite as the housekeeper. The suite is on a high floor, the room is very large, and the view is beautiful~ Every day I can fall asleep to the sound of the waves🌊 and welcome the sunrise on the bed~😄
The housekeeper meets our various needs in a timely manner every day, and is not tired of it. Thank you again, mua💋~

Facilities: The hotel was built earlier, but the facilities can still be seen to be very Very luxurious, with an electric toilet seat~ A little complaint, although the bedsheets have a high thread count, I saw small holes...😅
In addition, the hotel has 2 swimming pools, which feels a little small and generally playable~

Breakfast: The breakfast restaurant is served at the Disha Village Restaurant. The overall feeling is that the proportion of Chinese food is low. Salads, bread, and drinks occupy a large space, and the options for Chinese stomachs are limited~🤣

Finally, I want to say that the scenery of the Raffles Hotel is very good. The hotel itself covers a large area. I hope to come again next time to make up for the unfinished check-in~😁

Raffles is like a quiet pearl lying on Qingshui Bay. It is different from the bustling resort hotels in Sanya. It is so quiet and refreshing🏨
Thanks to meeting Darryl, the enthusiastic and considerate housekeeper, I experienced the ultimate staycation here. Spacious and bright room, lovely welcome gift, the Liberty Lighthouse comes into view when the window is opened. The hotel has direct access to Clear Water Bay Beach, blowing the sea breeze, listening to the sound of the sea, and ordering a glass of Raffles' classic Singapore Sling at Longbar in the evening. Everything matches my vacation fantasy 🏝️
Whether it is a Southeast Asian-style hotel building or a niche and low-key hotel brand, it is so unique among the many hotels in Hainan. It feels like you are in Bali. When traveling to Lingshui, choosing Raffles will really make you not want to go out. If there is a next time, I will still choose this treasure hotel located on the singing beach, away from the busy city, just for vacation.

The hotel's white sand beach is so soft that children don't have time to play in the swimming pool every day just digging in the sand, picking up shells. The small wontons for breakfast are delicious and the variety is particularly rich. In particular, the hotel staff's service is really excellent. I would like to praise the housekeeper Diana, who is really enthusiastic and has prepared many gifts for the children. The children were so excited that they didn’t want to leave. They asked me to cancel the rest of the trip to Sanya and just wanted to stay at Raffles.
A great trip, I will stay there again next time I go to Lingshui

Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, every corner is clean, and the details are valuable.
Environment: The environment is so good that I thought I was on vacation abroad. It has extremely rich vegetation and a natural oxygen bar; because it is the shooting location of She Vanished, you can take blockbusters no matter where you are in the hotel; the beach is a private beach, which is also what I think of Sanya during this trip. The finest beach in the country, the sea is also very beautiful, and everything is very comfortable.
Service: Superb service, great experience! ! Especially the housekeeper Leo is really considerate and responsible. We will communicate the travel information and weather conditions in advance before checking in, making our travel very simple. Any questions I had during my stay were answered one by one, and the patient advice after leaving the hotel made me feel like they cared like family. It is precisely because of the good service that this trip was so wonderful ~
In short, the price/performance ratio is very high and it is a worthwhile trip. Next time I come to Sanya, I will stay in this hotel directly. It is perfect for bringing children.

The environment and garden design are high-end and a**ospheric, the sea water is clear, and the white sand is soft and soft, which is very comfortable to step on. Because I was sick these days, I didn’t experience the same beach buffet as the movie, which is a little regrettable...
The temperature of the constant temperature swimming pool is suitable, and the children don’t get out of the water for several hours...
The hotel will replenish water for guests and collect garbage in the afternoon, which is very considerate. Basically, the service is responsive.
The only drawback is that my room is not very hot in the rain, which is acceptable.
The Mosha Lighthouse in the evening is also beautiful and worth recommending.

He also sent me the welcome and arrangements on the day of check-in, including the introduction around Clear Water Bay. He was very attentive. The most considerate thing was that he upgraded to a private swimming pool room. We and the kids had a great time, and we will choose Raffles next time.

msg:This resort in Clearwater Bay is amazing! The room was spacious and bright, with great sea views and close to the beach. Listening to the sound of the waves crashing when you fall asleep at night is a natural sleep aid. The sand and water quality of Clear Water Bay are even better. The garden landscape of the entire hotel is also very grand and artistic, making it an excellent place to take photos and check in. The service provided by the butler Coco is also very considerate, and she even gave small gifts to the children. All in all, this hotel is a must-visit place in Sanya, especially suitable for families who want a quiet vacation!

This time the children also took a travel photo in the hotel. The hotel is very popular everywhere, if not for the schedule later. , I really want to stay in the hotel. Although the swimming pool room I stayed in this time is on the first floor, there are basically no mosquitoes or anything like that. I will continue to choose this room type next time I come to stay. The only drawback is that the swimming pool is still a bit cold this season, children I can’t stand it anymore. I hope the hotel can provide a constant temperature, so that the independent swimming pool has real meaning. I also hope that the children’s programs and activities will be richer, so that we can enjoy the hotel with peace of mind as parents and children. And the best thing is Clear Water Bay Beach, the sand is really soft! ! !

To be honest, the overall experience of staying at Raffles Hotel was very good. Especially the housekeeper Xiaoyan Diana, whose warm and thoughtful arrangements and services every day make my wife and children feel very friendly. Whether it was the beach dinner in the evening, the arrangements for the travel shoot, or the fact that we were on vacation on the 19th, they even came over to arrange a sightseeing car to accompany us around the entire hotel. They were all very attentive! Two small suggestions: the hotel needs to increase the variety of breakfast, especially the category of Chinese food, and improve the quality of the meals. In addition, because the hotel has been open for a long time, some hardware in the room may need maintenance.

Flame flowers, crape myrtle, and bougainvillea are clustered among the green coconut palm leaves, full of subtropical style. The butler Coco is not only beautiful, but also very considerate. In addition to caring about every detail, she also upgraded us to a sea view suite. It was an unexpected surprise and made our holiday mood double instantly.

During the honeymoon vacation, we specially upgraded the villa, and also provided a hotel check-in plan, butler tips, a guide to eating, drinking and playing in Lingshui, as well as high-quality and considerate services. We arranged round-trip shuttle buses, Longge afternoon tea, and recommended fun places in the surrounding area.

First of all, the environment of Raffles Hotel is very comfortable, giving people a sense of tranquility and elegance. The rooms are fully equipped so that people can get a full rest here. In addition, the hotel's location is also very convenient, with convenient transportation and many shopping and entertainment facilities nearby, making the living experience here more colorful.

At the same time, I also hope that the hotel can continue to maintain this excellent service quality and provide more guests with a wonderful living experience.

The tropical garden-style enclosed landscape is large and well-maintained. There is a heated swimming pool. Ms. Yao, the hotel housekeeper, is responsive to all requests and is very considerate. From the first piece of fruit upon entering the hotel to helping to take photos when leaving the hotel, she provides just the right attentive service. The hotel's breakfast doesn't have much Chinese food, it's more Western-style, and the closing service isn't timely enough. I ordered food at a Chinese restaurant and the taste was beyond the information. Before leaving, I went to Longtouling and found that the New World is a good place to relax. Will recommend friends to stay here.

msg:Booking a hotel with Ctrip is so secure and worry-free! The first stop of the 2024 winter vacation is Raffles Clearwater Bay. The itinerary is full for three days and two nights. On the first day, we fly to Sanya Airport, rent a car directly from the airport and pick up the car, and drive to the hotel for almost an hour. The hotel housekeeper Diana was waiting at the door early and reminded me to bring my coat before traveling. The temperature here in Sanya has cooled down. At around 9:06, I checked into the Lanhaiju family suite. The two rooms can be separated by a sliding door. There is one extra-large bed and one double bed. It is no problem to bring the elders of the family to live together. It is great!
The beach at Raffles in Clear Water Bay is particularly soft, and the beach where the waves recede and people are reflected in the "mirror of the sky" is very beautiful! The photos are very nice! The beach here is opposite to the sunrise, but after staying for two nights, I didn't even wait for the sunrise. There will be many white sails here at noon, which is very fun!
The style of Raffles Hotel reminds me of the Centara Samui I went to. The Bali Wing where we stayed, the balcony overlooking the famous lighthouse in "The Vanishing Her". Listening to the roar of the waves, the temperature in Sanya has cooled down in the past few days, and the wind has been a bit strong, but staying in the hotel feels particularly safe. The waiters will take the initiative to say hello even if they don't meet, and the mood is the pleasure and relaxation of being on vacation!
The buffet breakfast and dinner in the hotel are also very rich. For dinner, there is a barbecue buffet on the beach and there are singers singing. Listening to the songs, it is very ritualistic while eating!
The sand in the hotel is really fine and soft. I have been to Sanya three times, the first time at Yalong Bay Tianyu, the second time at Atlantis at Haitang Bay, and the third time at Lingshui. I think every area is great. The hotel left wonderful childhood memories with the children!
Raffles's heated swimming pool, when the temperature is cooling down, it is a very happy thing for children to swim in the water! 3 days and 2 days is not enough. There is also a surfing course in the hotel. 1 to 2 is 780 yuan per person for two hours. I looked at the prices around and it is really a very good price. After all, it is in the hotel and it is worth the experience. At a glance, there are also free professional photos, which your children will definitely love!
We recommend 13 hotels as check-in spots for taking photos, and they are all really photogenic!
You can experience the Southeast Asian style without going abroad. It’s really safe and convenient! The hotel also has dedicated rooms with small swimming pools, and the privacy is very good! There are every room type you can think of, from standard rooms to suites. I particularly like the big coconut trees and Van Gogh tiles in the hotel. They look great in photos!

Facilities: Complete facilities
Hygiene: Hygiene twice a day, and turndown service
Environment: Checking in and taking photos at the hotel is very photogenic
Service: The service is great! Diana, the hotel housekeeper, Kate, the lobby manager, and Simon, the diners at Disha Village, saw us taking care of the children and asked if we would like some ginger soup to cool down Sanya, which was very heart-warming.

Recommendations for hotels:
1. The sockets are very loose and some are broken and cannot be used.
2. You can consider preparing a clothes drying rack on the balcony so that swimsuits and towels can be dried in time.
3. Please update the WeChat Mini Program Children’s Club class schedule in time

But the catering was quite disappointing. The fish and shrimp in the Thai meal were obviously not fresh. The catering supervisor probably explained that the fish tasted bad because it was over-steamed. We don’t have much debate during the Spring Festival. In fact, the shrimp meat is not firm and elastic. The Chinese restaurant tasted average, so we ate out for the next few days after staying at the hotel. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the environment, service and a**osphere. However, if I come to Clear Water Bay next time, I will consider Raffles. Overall, it is good.

Hygiene: The cleaning staff cleans up promptly and diligently. The room is kept very clean and tidy. There are no mosquitoes or musty smell in the room.
Environment: The white sand beach is the most satisfactory. It is much better than the beach in Sanya. It is soft and clean. It is highly recommended to come to Qingshui Bay for beach fun.
Service: Manager Wen, the housekeeper, added WeChat to inform the hotel before check-in. He responded promptly to any questions during the stay, making it a very pleasant stay.
The downside is that there are no charging stations in the hotel.

The lights are even more beautiful at night... You can see the lighthouse in "The Disappearance of Him". The entire beach is very beautiful and comfortable, making people forget to return. ….
   The most important thing is that my housekeeper Coco is not only beautiful, but also very patient and enthusiastic in solving all my problems. Thank you again to her!

Bicycles turned into motorcycles. Thank you very much🙏 The hotel is very beautiful, there are few people, it is quiet and quiet, and the flour sand in Clear Water Bay really deserves its reputation. The children are here It’s so fun to roll around on the beach and do somersaults. There is a heated outdoor swimming pool where you can borrow arm rings for free. There are also free beach toys during the day on the beach loungers. The butler Coco is very thoughtful and praises 👍 Overall, the resort style is full of five-star recommendations. The only shortcoming is the outdoor barbecue. The price is relatively expensive and there are few things to eat. Not recommended.

Highlights: You can scroll below to read the third item👇👇👇
	
First, from December 26, 2023 to January 1, 2024, I stayed at Raffles Hotel Hainan Clearwater Bay for 7 days and 6 nights. During this period, I can count on one hand the number of waiters who asked me hello. , the waiters passing by every day are either chatting together or dealing with various business on their mobile phones. Forget it, bear with it...
	
Secondly, I ate at Baiwei Restaurant at noon one day, and ordered a kid's set meal, which was ordered at 11:45. It was not until around 1 o'clock that the kid's set meal was considered "complete" due to my unremitting urging. The salad was replaced with a small fruit plate. I asked if this was a dessert or a salad. The waiter replied: Salad, how about I take it back and pour some salad dressing on it for you? I said what is that dessert? The waiter said: The original mushroom bun is gone and I have replaced it with another one. The meal lasted for more than an hour, and I kept urging me to hurry up. During this period, few waiters actually asked me for help. They basically kept expressions on their faces, or were perfunctory, until they were almost done eating at my urging. , privately replaced the dishes that did not match the menu and served them without apology. Forget it, just bear with it...
	
Third, the most outrageous thing was what happened when I took my children to the swimming pool on the afternoon of December 31st. The hotel has a large heated swimming pool and three small children's swimming pools. Only the middle one is heated, and the heating of the other two is broken, which is normal temperature water. When I was pulling my child to get ready to go into the water, a staff member wearing housekeeper uniform said to me, "I'm sorry, can you take your child to another swimming pool?" and then asked why? She said: "Our chairman's daughter is taking swimming lessons." I was surprised, thinking I heard it right? ! I said: "I am a guest staying here. I didn't say anything like this before checking in and there were no signs on site. You violated my rights by doing this." She actually said: "We are just kids teaching a lesson. ." I said to her: "Isn't my child a child? You have been specializing since childhood. Your thoughts are really terrible. Besides, I am still a guest here who spends money and stays in the hotel." I was shocked that she could ask the guests to go Besides, she insisted on letting us change the pool even though she knew that only one of the three small swimming pools was heated. It could have accommodated 6 or 7 children, but only the chairman’s daughter and the coach were in it (pictured) 2). It is said that the little girl has taken 80 classes. She must have "study" like this before! Can this be tolerated? I can't bear it anymore!
	
If it’s because of the first two, I really don’t want to be mentally drained. I have traveled domestically and internationally for so many years and visited more than 50 countries. Unexpectedly, I was refreshed by Raffles Hotel, a luxury brand of Accor Group, in Sanya Clear Water Bay. !

Special thanks to the housekeeper Diana Yan. After learning that I was traveling with my parents and three other people, she made special arrangements for an upgrade and gave me a preferential breakfast trea**ent. The details that are friendly to the elderly feel very loving. After arriving at the store, Xiaoyan's professional, meticulous and well-proportioned reception made people feel like spring breeze. I gave the housekeeper a thumbs up.
The airport pick-up service and Platinum Travel Photography included in the package are both good.
At 7:30 pm in the hotel, there will be a night ceremony with GM's personal music, a bonfire on the beach night that is linked to the dream of the movie "The Lost Girl", and a unique Chris**as tree on the beach, which fills the a**osphere. It has to be said that homogeneous competition is becoming increasingly fierce. It is indeed difficult for high-end luxury hotels to widen the gap simply by relying on hardware. Concepts and feelings are often more attractive. The overall experience is great and worth a second try.

The sea view room on the Bali wing has a great view and is highly recommended.

The breakfast is very rich and tastes good. It is in line with the hotel's level. The conditions and facilities of the gym are very good. It is worth recommending. The hotel's waiters are very friendly and the housekeepers are also very responsible.
The hotel facilities are a bit old but well maintained and there is no smell
The sand in Clear Water Bay is as fine as dirt, comparable to Australia’s Gold Coast

Compared with hotels of the same level, the room size is larger
Although it's right on the beach, the room doesn't smell very damp at all.
The one who deserves the most praise is the housekeeper, Yinan Ena.
Warm, generous and cute, and the service is the best😘
Come again next time

The hotel's unique Southeast Asian style has a resort a**osphere. The hotel's exterior design is very Indonesian style, full of a**osphere ~ lush green plants, especially Clear Water Bay The beach has very fine sand. I personally think it is the best beach in Hainan. The sea is very blue and the scenery is great. The sunrise from the sea view room is absolutely unbeatable! When we checked out, the housekeeper Coco gave us a super cute little gift as a souvenir. It was a very pleasant travel experience. (ps: The boss plays the piano and welcomes the employees to sing together, which really reminds me of workplace life in every minute🥲🥲🥲)

Hygiene: Cleaning up twice a day, replenishing supplies and giving turn-down chocolates. By the way, the supplies are Ferragamo.
Environment: The sand in Clear Water Bay is really soft and suitable for bare feet. There are also various seafood stalls near the hotel. However, I ate at the hotel’s Chinese restaurant for the past two days. I suggest that the taste of the Chinese restaurant can be improved.
Service: I have to praise the little angel Ena, the housekeeper, who specially gave me a small cake after knowing it was my birthday. She also helped with the birthday decoration. I quickly made a reservation for the beach buffet dinner, and the SPA also helped me make perfect arrangements! Who can not love this? By the way, the SPA experience is also very good, Ayla’s techniques are great! The piano music played during the nightfall ceremony is also on the top of my playlist. The overall stay experience is particularly good in the off-season when there are fewer people. I will try a villa with a swimming pool next time I have the opportunity!
Tips: The Accor Reserve Card is quite useful. Buy one get one free on the buffet breakfast and get a 30% discount in the restaurant.

There are few people and beautiful scenery here, and it is quiet and quiet - the Liberty Lighthouse, the pink sunset, the singing beach, and the sea breeze. Passing through the coconut grove, white waves crash on the beach, satisfying all your imagination of the sea...
The hotel's service is also very attentive and meticulous. In particular, the hotel butler Enawang is very enthusiastic. He upgraded our room and personally helped us arrange check-in and delivery to the room. He also arranged airport drop-off and small gifts when leaving the hotel. It was a very pleasant stay experience. .

msg:I'll step on the money trap, don't let everyone get ripped off!
It was my first time to go to Lingshui. The room rate was less than 2,000 yuan. Based on Ctrip’s score of 4.8, it was basically considered a “blind booking”. I thought I wouldn’t step into a trap. But I accidentally saw the sharing from a “conscience” review blogger online and thought it was an exaggeration. It turned out that I was still too young. I have seen good reviews, but I have never seen such exaggerated reviews. Such a price score makes me "in awe"!
1. I checked in on the same day and looked at three rooms in a row. I wore a mask and the first two rooms were directly smelled by a pungent musty smell. The third room was moved to a suite on the ninth floor. It was slightly better, but I could still feel the musty smell. I wanted to check out and leave the hotel, but the "housekeeper" asked me in various ways. I said that I could even downgrade the room. I just asked that there be no musty smell. It turned out that there were no rooms left, and the rest was probably about the same. I asked to check out again, and the housekeeper said that if I checked out or didn't give a full five-point rating, the hotel would deduct money. There will be a commission for naming and commenting. At that time, I was still soft-hearted and accepted her "Tao binding". Instantly, I understood how Ctrip’s positive reviews and 4.8 points came from.
2. I started sneezing when I woke up the next morning, which hurt my eyes. But it was noticeably better once I left the room. After returning to the room, I found that there were many mold spots on the air-conditioning outlet and the furniture was cracked and moldy. As a result, I gave feedback to their guest relations manager. She took the initiative to tell me to contact Ctrip to give me a discounted room rate and come to see the room problem. I waited for an hour and she said she couldn't come. I heard wrong...
3. In the evening, the manager took the initiative and said to me, "There will be no discount, and we will invite you to dinner instead." I saw the daddy that I had pulled out, and sat back down again. Maybe the hotel saw that I looked like a dead pig and was not afraid of boiling water, so there was no need to "fight for it", so I was left alone. I asked him to send me the menu and found that it was a 3.9-point set meal. I declined politely. "After all, I'm not picky. This doesn't look delicious. Let's not make it difficult for each other. This time I admitted failure and didn't cook it carefully." I was careless about my homework."
4. I checked out as soon as possible after breakfast the next day. Overall, I felt that the hotel was too utilitarian and everything was for the purpose of getting good reviews. Once I found that there was no hope of getting a perfect review, I didn’t even bother to take care of it. I went to the front desk to get something and just memorized it. Pretending not to see the body. Not to mention other details! The breakfast glasses are all watermarked. There is a lot of water in the public area of ​​the hotel. The outer edge of the building is very dilapidated. In addition, the garden has grown wildly and the lights are turned off at night. The overall feeling is like the architectural style of Southeast Asia in the 1990s. It is worthy of being a horror suspense. The location of a thriller movie! Raffles is also the only hotel besides the Sanya Airport VIP Building that I have seen that uses a speaker to play a toad in the lobby pool...
5. I wanted to buy a hotel mango cake to eat at night, but despite all the instructions, the wrong one was given to me (there were three cakes in total, just one with fruit, but if you think carefully about my conversation with him, he couldn’t give it to me) Wrong!) The mini bar is definitely mini, with small portions of Pepsi and 7-Up. The room only has a carton smell of "high-end-looking" "**" water, and it's also known as "Hainan Plastic Restriction" environmental protection! So why not provide glass bottles of water? So don’t be stingy in the name of environmental protection!
6. When checking out, the waiter I met along the way saw me pushing my luggage and just said hello. When I got to the door, I saw the leader there. He passed me and turned back to help me get my luggage... It was so fake!
7. What’s even more funny is that when I arrived at Mandarin Oriental, the Mandarin front office manager said that a guest relations manager from Raffles contacted her and asked her to take good care of me. I would like to ask your hotel, what did you do during the three days and two nights you stayed there?
Ps: Don’t tell your guests that if you plant your food at the beach, it’s close to the sea. Only if there is a typhoon will mold get there. There’s nothing you can do about it! You can deceive yourself with this set of words. Since you can contact Wenhua, why doesn't his room smell musty? Don't let your saliva get stuck in sparrows all day long. The main thing is a zero-cost scam. It's okay to make a movie, but don't get too involved in it.

The beach buffet is very unique. Although there is not much to eat, it is very comfortable and romantic to sit on the beach and enjoy the sea breeze, eat barbecue and drink some wine. I informed my birthday when booking, and the hotel thoughtfully decorated the room and prepared a cream cake. The cake was delicious. The housekeeper Xiao Hu is very warm and considerate, and responds to all requests. The whole hotel has a very good a**osphere. A great stay. Already recommended friends from outside the island and

Surprisingly, she actually received the contact number of the driver late at night. I liked this kind of work attitude at that time, because it is a good habit to give feedback on everything. I paid special attention to the name Ena and saw that the profile picture looked like a little girl.
What was unexpected was the continued attention to us from the moment we checked in. She went out of her way to focus on our experience in every aspect of the hotel. In the past few years, due to the epidemic and work, I have not gone out much, but compared with the big-name hotels I have stayed in, I felt quite good during the past few days at Raffles~ The service is still service, and the courtesy of all the staff convinced her and us Very impressed with the constant communication and courteous service from all staff.
I left the store today, and I recalled that I was able to build a sense of trust with Ena in just a few days, based on her ability to solve problems. As the saying goes, execution is the key to getting everything done. This also shows the hotel's management and strength of its employees. I am so confident that I would like to stay here again when I come to Sanya next year~

The day before check-in, Diana, the housekeeper, contacted me to inquire about my check-in needs. On the day of check-in, we arrived after 1:00 pm. When we got out of the car, there was a doorman who helped us with our luggage. There was also a hotel staff member. I guessed it was a supervisor with a good temperament. Guided us all the way to the lobby, Diana was already waiting for us. Check-in was very fast. On the way to the room, Diana gave a detailed introduction to the hotel, which gave us a certain understanding of the hotel when we checked in for the first time. From check-in to check-out, Diana gave very meticulous and thoughtful services, with a sense of proportion It's well grasped, not overly enthusiastic, but just feels very comfortable and at ease. I am very grateful to her here, and the five-star praise must also be given to her.
The hotel environment can be described as one step at a time, with a strong artistic a**osphere, and it looks like a postcard when you take a photo; the room layout is reasonable and a**ospheric, and it pays attention to environmental protection; the night ceremony provides cocktails and snacks, and you can completely relax physically and mentally in the melodious piano music; Qingshuiwan beach water The clear sand is young, and I deliberately got up early to watch the sunrise. The orange sky, the free lighthouse, the beach and the waves form a perfect natural picture.
The buffet breakfast is rich, and the welcome fruit is not perfunctory at first glance. We ordered the 688 set meal for dinner in the Chinese restaurant. The taste is quite satisfactory.
Raffles is the hotel I will continue to stay in when I go to Sanya in the future, not one of them.

msg:The hotel is the filming hotel of "The Missing Her", which was very popular in the early stage (mainly for punching in). The movie's shadow can be found in the same lobby, corridors, seaside, and beach bonfire dinners in the play. The lighthouse can be seen from the beach of the hotel. It takes seven or eight minutes to drive to get close to the lighthouse, and it is a bit far to walk.
Facilities: I booked a family room. There is a 2-meter large bed that can sleep 2 adults, and a 1.7-meter children's sofa bed is only suitable for children. When adults sleep on it, their feet will be exposed. The sofa bed is a cartoon quilt cover, and there are small tents and small toys on the carpet. The arrangement is very cute, and the children like it very much. There is a small refrigerator in the room, and free drinks are delivered every day. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry with a bathtub, and the dressing table and sink are separated, which is more convenient. There is a portable folding hanger that can be placed on the balcony to dry clothes, and the balcony is very spacious.
Hygiene: The room is clean and tidy, carefully dusted, there is no sand on the ground (the problem of beach hotels), even the floor of the balcony is clean.
Environment: The hotel has a Southeast Asian style, the garden landscape is beautiful, the garden is very shady, there are two large and small swimming pools, the business hours are different, the latest is until 10 pm. There are no slides in the children's pool, and free swimming laps can be borrowed. The pool comes with towels, ice water and sunscreen. The beach is next to the garden, and the beach is the beach when you walk out of the garden. The famous bonfire fight in the movie was shot on the beach. The sand is fine, the shoal extends far, and the waves are not big, suitable for adults and children to play. The water quality is clean and clear, almost transparent when the sun is good, and it is extremely filmy.
Service: The service staff are very enthusiastic and patient, and help solve the problems asked during the check-in period in time. You need to wait for a table after 9 o'clock for breakfast. The food is average and the variety is not too rich. It is open until 11 o'clock, and you can sit until 11:30 and leave. Chinese food is settled by the way. Seats at the beach buffet are limited, so it’s best to make a reservation at the front desk or the butler in advance during the day, 628 is half price for a child, mainly seafood barbecue, although there are not many varieties, but there is unlimited supply of lobster, oyster, durian, steak, foie gras, etc. The production speed is also very fast, which is good. The beach dining a**osphere is beautiful and romantic. Children can play sand and catch crabs on the side, which is worth experiencing.
I would like to praise the girl Diana in the front hall. During the stay, she has been assisting us with our needs, responded in a timely manner, and actively asked us about our feelings. The child slept late in the room, and the adults went to the restaurant for dinner. When the child woke up, she helped us take the child to the room It's really troublesome for her to come for a long time! Thank you for this nice girl!

Service: Five 🌟rave reviews for the housekeeper Yao Xiaolin. She is really professional and her service is kind and considerate. She smiles sweetly every time I see her. Contact us in advance to understand your needs before checking in. On the day of check-in, ask about the check-in time in advance and greet you at the hotel front desk. You can use the check-in process throughout the process. During the period, WeChat messages will be replied at any time. If you have time, you will ask in advance what arrangements are made and drive a battery car to pick you up in person. The little sister is loved and recognized by the whole family.

Environment: The hotel is in Southeast Asian style. Although the hotel is old, it is well maintained and does not feel like an old hotel. The hotel lawn has also just been changed. I have basically stayed in a good hotel in Sanya. The lawn of Raffles is ranked in the top three. It may be because it has just been changed.

Meal: Recommended Chinese restaurant

Opinion: The hotel's battery car transportation plan is unreasonable. Villa guests have to rely on battery cars to stay in the hotel, and they have to wait for a long time every time. It is recommended to improve this point.

This time we stayed in the Lanhaiju Family Suite, a double suite design that can accommodate three people. The room is very large. I really like the interior decoration style and the attention to detail! The beach at Clear Water Bay has very good sand quality, fine and smooth, gentle water, not many people, very comfortable and private. The food in the hotel is also great. I have experienced all the restaurants in the hotel during my stay in the past few days. Chinese food, seafood food, Southeast Asian food, the dishes and products are very high! The hotel is also the filming location for the movie "She Disappeared". My daughter is a fan of Zhu Yilong, so she made a special trip to the nearby Free Lighthouse to check in these days. Finally, I would like to mention that the service of Ms. Coco, the exclusive housekeeper in the room, is really considerate and considerate.

I went to the beach to check out the movie Vanishing Her during the Mid-Autumn Festival. It was so beautiful! I am very grateful to my housekeeper, Yao Xiaolin, who served us patiently and with a smile throughout the whole process. She upgraded our room for us. Thank you very much!

msg:Three days and two nights at Raffles Sanya. First things first: 1. The room can watch the sunrise; 2. The butler Darryl is nice, quick to respond, enthusiastic and thoughtful; 3. The mattress is very good; 4. The open-air BBQ a**osphere at the beach is full! Let’s talk about the shortcomings: 1. I like quiet, but it’s too noisy. I can hear the thumping music before 10 o’clock in the evening, which makes me tired of sleeping with my baby; 2. The matches upstairs keep falling on our terrace. 3. If you don’t take the initiative to give children dental kits, you have to give them; 4. If you don’t take the initiative to give children bathrobes and beach slippers, you have to give them bathrobes; 5. The bathtub shower in the room is broken; 6. The emergency plan is very poor, which is the worst. Lai: My baby had a fever at night, and the hotel asked us to go to the military headquarters in Haitang Bay, Sanya, which is far away. They call a taxi for 200, which is twice as expensive as calling a taxi yourself, okay! Then we struggled for an hour, and the hospital said that the child would not be treated in the emergency depar**ent! The doctor said he couldn't see me and didn't have medicine for the child, so he asked us to wait until 8 a.m. for the outpatient clinic. Those raising children must learn a lesson. Work all night and come back in the morning. I don't even have the energy to eat breakfast. We happened to have been to Raffles in Seychelles, Africa, and had a very good impression. In terms of hardware, the room's viewing deck and swimming pool are quite different. I hope to improve in terms of software and management!

The Balinese style and Li cultural elements run through every part of the hotel. The service is enthusiastic and the housekeeper Diana is even more professional and thoughtful.

There are many types of buffet breakfast, and the taste of the hotel's restaurants and in-room meals is good. However, the menus for in-room meals are a little bit small, especially Chinese food. The dishes in the restaurant cannot be delivered, and only those on the room menu can be delivered. There aren't many takeaways around, so I felt tired of eating after staying there for a few days.
In addition, I would like to praise the housekeeper Diana for her excellent service and prompt answers to questions. She also helped us get a delayed check-out until three o'clock. Like it👍🏻

msg:I usually give hotels very few stars.
But I have to praise this one from the bottom of my heart.
Will also recommend to more friends.
Even if she hadn't disappeared, this hotel would definitely be worthy of this praise.
[Naughty] Let’s talk about service first. I came to Sanya for eleven days this time and stayed at Yalong Bay Tianyu, Clearwater Bay Westin, and Clearwater Bay Raffles.
Raffles deserves to be number one.
The Westin is down to your toes.
A few details:
Every waiter will greet you kindly, and even the cleaning lady will chat with you openly and recommend the hotel;
In particular, the daily greetings and services from housekeeper Mia Xiaohu were meticulous, responsive, thoughtful, timely and considerate, which made our trip very happy and good mood!
In addition, it rained when I was taking my baby to play on the beach. Unexpectedly, a service guy from far away came to deliver bath towels and spread them on the lounge chairs. It was really touching;
There is also the chef named Zhou Fan at the beach buffet dinner. He is really warm-hearted. He takes the trouble to introduce and remind us, and chats with us like a friend. He is so kind.
Every employee in this hotel has their own bonus points, which constantly improves my impression of the hotel and creates a qualitative change.
Moreover, when these employees mention the general manager, they will feel proud from the bottom of their hearts, which shows that this general manager really has extremely high management level and personality charm.
I was also fortunate enough to enjoy the general manager's performance at Stanford Hall, and I still remember it vividly.
This trip to Raffles was definitely the right one.
And the beach at Raffles is really good. The sand is very fine and the water is clear. You can catch the sea with a headlamp at night. There are too many sand crabs. Not far away is the Agile sales depar**ent, which is a good place to catch the sea.
When you go out, you can go to Dongrong Food City, Qingshuiwan Food Street, Xincun Night Market, and charter a boat to catch the sea in Xincun Town, especially the Xu Fuji Oysters and Liu Erlang Grilled Big Bones at Xincun Night Market, and charter a boat to catch seafood, which is absolutely beautiful.
You can also go snorkeling on Boundary Island, but the experience is average, and the snorkeling quality in China is still much worse.
In short, the corporate culture of Raffles is commendable and it is definitely a worthwhile trip! Will also recommend to more friends.
Oh, by the way, there is also late check-out and airport transfer by business car, which really makes people have to come back.

When I saw the child getting into the waves, I always pay attention and blow the whistle to remind me. It's great~ I will come again to this sea!
It's also very convenient to order takeaway, and the Southeast Asian restaurant by the pool is also good... except that the food is a bit slow to serve, and the children play with the wall 🉐️Hand the wall to get out...
          The young fitness expert is also very satisfied with the gym, and there is even a bench press rack that is not common in hotel gyms. Friendly reminder, you must wear sports shoes when you enter the gym. It is stipulated that barefoot strength training is not allowed, so I had to wear children's beach shoes on a whim.
 
      Yaomei's housekeeper is enthusiastic about her service, and she is responsive to every request in WeChat contact. Knowing that the child was unwilling to leave, he specially helped me to check out late, and gave each of the two children a doll. The children were very happy. Thank you beauty!

Before coming to Lingshui, I stayed at Sun Bay and thought it was an excellent beach. I never expected that Clear Water Bay would be even more amazing. The waves here are bigger than those at Clear Water Bay, and the sand is more delicate. I like it very much, taking photos, and the singing beach is well-deserved!
Enjoy the buffet dinner on the beach in the evening, looking at the lighthouse, listening to the singing, tasting foie gras, and smelling the faint smell of barbecue, which makes people want to repeat this moment again and again.
The service at Raffles is also very good. When we checked in, the housekeeper Diana was very enthusiastic and helped us carry our luggage and arrange the room. She carefully explained all aspects of the hotel to us and sent detailed pictures and texts. She also sent some travel tips every morning, which was very intimate.
The only drawback is the breakfast. Speaking of one noodle, the last hotel could definitely have half a portion, but not here, which would lead to a bit of waste. The presentation is okay, but the taste of the noodles is not very good. Although there are many varieties, they are not very refined. Some dishes do not make people want to try. I hope the hotel can improve the breakfast.
However, the flaws are not outweighed. Next time I come to Lingshui, I will definitely choose Raffles. If it were not for the restricted schedule, I really want to stay here for a few more nights!

The rooms are large, the facilities are relatively new, and the public and private pools are nice and clean. The sand of Qingshuiwan Beach is very fine, and the sea lighthouse is very beautiful from a distance.
The breakfast in the restaurant is not bad, and the barbecue buffet in the evening is worth it.
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Xiao Hu, who was very professional and considerate in introducing the hotel and activities before the trip and at the end of the trip, and solved the problem. Praise 👍

I never thought that before I came here, it would become an Internet celebrity hotel because of a movie, so the flow of people increased, but this did not affect the experience of staying here. Slowly here Vacation, beautiful beach and sea view, the water is clear and the sand is fine enough to express the beauty of the beach here in the sunshine. The butler service is also excellent. Diana is always on call and the general service is very considerate. At least we all go to Haitang to ask for it. I’m on vacation. I tried to come to Clear Water Bay this year. Sure enough, if you want a beach where you can go into the sea, Bilong Bay is more beautiful and comfortable, with fewer people and quieter. Of course, the disadvantage is that the hotel is too big. We live on the top floor of Bali Wing. I got lost twice, and when I was embarrassed, I couldn’t find someone to ask for directions... Only when I eat buffet breakfast, Chinese restaurant and beach can I feel the popularity. The most surprising thing is that the breakfast is open until 11 o’clock. It’s really good for those who sleep late. Too friendly, lunch is saved directly Brunch, in short, the beauty of Clear Water Bay can only be experienced when you are there.

msg:Come to Raffles for the movie. The hotel housekeeper, Yao Xiaolin, is very considerate and considerate. She added WeChat the day before and helped arrange the room in advance. During the two days of check-in, she answered every question. She even knew the surrounding snack and fruit markets very well, which saved me the trouble of looking for it myself. After checking in, I got acquainted with the road, and it was very convenient to go to the restaurant and the beach without any detours. There are also free cocktails and beautiful piano music at the Changle Bar at 7:30 every night. I have to say that the beach in Clear Water Bay is awesome, and you can see the desert lighthouse not far away, but it's a pity that the weather is not good these days. Going to the end on the right is a good place for wedding photography. I regret that I stayed for one day less, I didn't have enough fun, and the children were immersed in the beach and couldn't extricate themselves. Next time I have a chance, I will choose Raffles again. The butler Xiaoyao is awesome! It's the first time to write an evaluation, and post a picture for your reference!

msg:Stayed at Raffles for two nights and had a great experience! I originally planned to stay for three nights, but due to a temporary change in my itinerary, I canceled one night. The overall feeling of the hotel is very comfortable. It is a Southeast Asian-style resort hotel. The hotel is large and has beautiful gardens. The beach has clear water and fine sand. The hotel's waiters are very warm and courteous! Especially the little beauty housekeeper Wang Yinan Ena must be given a five-star praise! Ena is enthusiastic, careful and considerate, and introduced us to many delicious and fun places near the hotel. Yesterday was our 20th wedding anniversary. Ena also decorated us with roses and gave us a small cake as a little surprise. It was really thoughtful and a huge thumbs up. Bring your parents and children next time! 😁

The welcome music reception on the first night of stay has a sense of ceremony and a sense of immersion. The general manager personally played the theme song "Cage" of the movie "The Lost She" on the piano. It seems that talent is very helpful for being a good general manager😝The hotel's decoration materials are exquisite , The artistic a**osphere is everywhere. Butler Mia's service is very considerate, asking for warmth and meeting the needs of guests as much as possible. The beach buffet dinner is very worth experiencing.

The staff are kind and polite, and the service is very attentive. Thanks to Judy who helped us check in. Seeing that our whole family provided us with a room upgrade service with a good view, we can directly see the same lighthouse as "The Vanishing Her". Also tell us in detail about the various services and activities offered by the hotel. Although the hotel is a bit old, the details are great. There is actually a hidden underwater embankment outside the beach to ensure the safety of tourists at the beach. The swimming pool is very large and the children had a great time. The room service is very diligent, answering all questions and meeting all needs. It was a very pleasant trip!

The snorkeling summer camp left unforgettable memories for the children. It is very worthwhile. The hotel butler Mia Xiaohu is very meticulous and patient and responsible. Because of her excellent service, I gave the hotel service a full score. My son praised the butler and said that her service is very good! Compared with the top luxury hotels of the same price in Sanya, the other waiters in the hotel are slightly inferior. But it is much better than the MGM where I live behind. Thanks to the butler for your hard work and giving us a perfect holiday.

There is nothing to say about the environment, but what makes us feel reluctant to leave the most is the meticulous service here, because our account manager, Ms. Wang Yinan Ena, made our family have the best time in the whole journey in Hainan. There is no one. Every second of the time here is free, happy and relaxing. Ms. Ena is gentle and careful, friendly and sincere, and the sun is beautiful. And no matter what time or anything, she answers all questions and sends us various play cards. Raiders, I hope that every traveler who comes to raffles will be as lucky as us. When I meet Ms. Ena, I think they will be like us. I look forward to the next meeting as soon as possible. We will come again on November! 🎊🎊⭐️⭐️By the way, you must try the beach barbecue.

msg:Lingshui has become more and more popular in recent years, especially "The Lost You" has brought new traffic. Considering that 🐡 can't travel intensively for the time being, I chose to bring my baby here for vacation again. Lingshui Hotel has more choices than Wanning, and there are more surrounding attractions. It is indeed more suitable for parent-child travel, but 🐡Purely subjective opinion, Raffles is not so parent-child😬 It is more inclined to couples, friends, business reception~

⭐️The first thing to praise is that each room is equipped with a butler, who will contact you from the day before your check-in. It can be said to be a 24-hour considerate service. This is really something that few hotels can do. Here you need to cue to me That sweet little Diana not only has guaranteed time, but also has extremely high service quality and quality. She will remind you of the unexpected and solve your various problems. Thanks to her these days, I live comfortably And convenient!

⭐️The overall environment of the hotel is great, with strong privacy, quiet and pleasant, the a**osphere is transparent, every corner is very good, and there are not many mosquitoes, there are sea, coconut groves and sunshine, surrounded by nature and not insects It's a great feeling to be bothered

⭐️The services of other hotel staff are also very good, and the overall quality is very high
⭐️The beach area of ​​the hotel is really not tired of playing, the sand is fine and white, better than Wanning, the sea is clear and clean, the sun in August is of course quite strong, but it is refreshing after 5 pm, at this time Both the sea and the sand are super comfortable and won’t cool down too quickly
	
Of course, there is still hope for better places:
⭐️As a top luxury brand, the cafeteria is really small and there are few food items. It is very crowded every day for eating. There are not many Chinese restaurants, but the portions are. . . The beach barbecue is very busy, you have to make a reservation in advance, the seafood restaurant tastes good, it is worth a try
⭐️The indoor children's playground is also small, with a wave pool of no more than 10 square meters➕two small rail cars and a small painting table. I don't quite understand why there is an empty tent?
⭐️The swimming pool is very popular, but because there is no children's pool, this 1.2m deep special-shaped swimming pool is filled with swimming laps, which are free to use

In general, the only top luxury hotel in Lingshui is still remarkable. If you have never stayed in it, you must go there once!

It is different from the fashion of Edison, and also different from Park Hyatt. The artistic a**osphere of the hotel has an indescribable luxury heritage, and the Qingshui Bay it sits on is really beautiful. The attitude of the service staff is very good, especially Diana, who is professional, enthusiastic, and always considerate of the guests. I will come again if I have the opportunity!

The high floor is facing the lighthouse. The scenery is very shocking. You can go to the room directly after checking in, which saves the waiting process, which is very good. It happened to be a birthday, and they also presented small cakes, greeting cards, and hotel mascot toys for the three children.
The hotel is very quiet, with a lot of greenery, and the environment is very good. I didn't know until I checked in that it was the filming location of her recently popular movie that disappeared. The beach is very delicate, the wind and waves are not too big, the BBQ in the package purchased is very good, there is a bonfire at night, and there is a wedding on the beach lawn.
The overall service awareness of the hotel is very strong, and the details are in place. There are sunscreen and ice water by the pool, and the room will be tidied up at night. Except for the slower Wi-Fi speed, there are basically no dead ends.
A hotel that I will stay in next time, very recommended.

He will introduce the facilities and take us to the room. We stayed for 4 nights and responded quickly to our needs and inquiries. He is a gentle and smiling guy. The night entrance ceremony also has a sense of participation and ceremony. The general manager will come to play the piano, which is a niche and high-end a**osphere. The Singapore Sling in the Changle Bar is actually better than the Clearwater Bay Sling. The sound insulation and sanitation of the hotel are very good, and the age of the facilities can be seen, but it does not feel shabby at all. The sandy beach is long and thin, and you can see the lighthouse and Agile's wedding photography base, compare the films, and the surf shop where the young lady is the coach. When checking out, coco also rushed to give the child a doll of a monkey of the Li nationality, which is a very good souvenir. Takeaway, express delivery, and car calling are all very convenient. This summer, I will be Amway Coco and Amway Raffles.

msg:The whole is very beautiful, the beach is very clean, there is no garbage, and the water is very clear. Coco, the WeChat housekeeper, is very responsible and friendly. The bags and cups sent by the hotel are so beautiful. The beach buffet lobster is really fresh and all you can eat. The restaurant's Hainanese chicken rice and durian cheese pizza are delicious. Beach washing equipment is also plentiful.
However, the room service staff can add more manpower. When we ask the customer service for help to get things, the waiting time is a bit long. In addition, there are many people in the hotel on weekends, and the slow check-out time of the guests affected our check-in time. After waiting for 2 hours, I didn't know what to do for a while, and I was a little impatient. It is recommended to add more cleaning aunts to speed up the speed. You can also set up a drying rack. There are some rooms in the hotel that are out of the way and can’t see the sea. Fortunately, the butler helped us change to a room with a better view, so some rooms in the hotel should be repositioned as sea view rooms to improve our housing experience.

The first feeling when I came to the next hotel was that I wanted to go back to Raffles for a few days. The effect of the Bojue travel photography arranged is also very good. I must recommend it.

Catering: The breakfast in the hotel is very rich and tastes great. A chef at the noodle stall also took the initiative to introduce, so that I can choose food according to my taste; the beach buffet barbecue is also very good and worth experiencing.

The most worth mentioning is that the hotel has an entrance ceremony, and the general manager plays the piano himself, which is full of a**osphere. The hotel also respects the concept of environmental protection very much. This is a hotel worth staying in again, highly recommended.

The most amazing service is my housekeeper, Ms. Diana, from the arrival at the hotel to the arrangement and resolution of every detail. The problem also made me super satisfied. I saw that I brought the children and thoughtfully prepared the children's supplies. I also sent a cute doll monkey. When I saw our water glass was broken, I also sent two mugs with the logo. Every service staff in the hotel is polite and enthusiastic. It is very warm and rare in other hotels. The white sand in Clear Water Bay is very fine and soft.

msg:Almost lived in Yalong Bay hotels. This is my first time visiting Raffles Clearwater Bay. Self-driving is actually not much farther than Yalong Bay. Overall very satisfied. The biggest advantage is its own beach: the sand is as fine as a blanket. What's rare is that the weather is so good that you can go to the sea, and what's even more rare is that there is no one in summer! I didn't see anyone all afternoon. This is the luxury of a domestic summer vacation. It is very quiet to sleep on the beach chair for an afternoon with the sea breeze blowing. Secondly, you can see the beautiful sunrise and stars in the sea and sky when you can go out of the hotel to the beach. Then there is the hotel service is very good. Give us an upgrade from the family room to Tianhaiju, we must give it a thumbs up. It is also convenient to eat around the hotel. There are kfc and big m, so children will be at ease. Li Ji Seafood and Coconut Chicken not far away are also good. If we talk about the disadvantages, it is that there are fewer swimming pools in the hotel, which is the lower level of Arima in Yalong Bay. Hotel restaurants including beach grills are too expensive. The room is quite satisfactory. The garden lobby, etc. are all online.

After arriving at the hotel, the front desk has arranged the room in advance, and Yao Xiaolin, the deputy manager of the housekeeping depar**ent, led us to the room. He also introduced the hotel's facilities and services in detail along the way. It is commendable that the manager Yao will inquire about check-in every day After the demand, this kind of carefulness is worthy of praise 👍🏻. After we got to the room, we found out that the hotel arranged us in the room that is closest to the sea and has the most square private pool. From the pool across the lawn to the beach, great! The disadvantage is that it takes seven or eight minutes to walk from the lobby to the room😅. The beach at the hotel is very clean. Shadows of coconut trees, clear water and young sand! The interior garden landscape design of the hotel is also very original, one step at a time, it is a good place to take pictures. In addition, the seafood buffet dinner on the beach at night is also very good. Listening to the singer singing "Cage" tactfully, watching the shining lighthouse and the gentle sea breeze blowing, the a**osphere of her disappearing is full. A little dissatisfied is that the hotel's breakfast place is a bit small. It is now the peak tourist season and there are more people. As a result, breakfast ends at 11 o'clock, and there is still a queue after 10:30 o'clock😂. The flaws are not hidden, generally speaking, I am very satisfied with my stay at Raffles this time, and I will come again next time and bring my children to learn surfing!

The housekeeper sister also gave a little monkey as a gift, and the children were overjoyed. Although the hotel is a bit old, the facilities are well maintained and the staff training is also in place. Although there are a lot of guests during the breakfast period, they will arrange to be seated. Compared with other hotels, it is much more orderly to find a place for breakfast. When we checked out, the butler sister helped us with our luggage and sent us to the car. The perfect vacation is over! Come to Raffles next time.

After telling our housekeeper Diana, she immediately helped me find a way and applied to change to a higher floor. In the end, I didn’t expect that we were upgraded to a family suite with a sea view and helped us dry our clothes.

The room we were given was very remote and we had to change it upon request. The Chinese restaurant menu price did not match the actual unit price. Please explain. Shi hurriedly posted new prices on the menu, but was corrected after strong request. The restaurant plates were greasy and had not been cleaned. After coming in, the butler service was completely lacking. The children surrounded me and refused to come even after repeated requests. They only came when they complained again on the last day; The apology is not sincere to the guests. In short, it is definitely not recommended. It is unworthy of the promotion of the "Her Disappearance" movie. I would also like to criticize Ctrip’s customer service. After the Black Brick VIP complained, there has been no feedback at all until today. I really want to complain about Ctrip’s tracking and complaint service.

Because I had to go home early for something, I missed one day of my stay. Discussions with the hotel were fruitless. The hotel directly deducted the full price of my room from the original price. Although it was not short of the money, I felt very uncomfortable. This was the first time I was so impressed. When I came to stay at Raffles City, I felt very unhappy! I will never stay here again, let alone recommend it to my friends!
The hotel is relatively old. Although the cleanliness is still good, the overall feeling is a bit gloomy. The breakfast is also very average and there are not many varieties of dishes. I would not recommend it to friends who are on vacation, unless there is really no hotel to choose from. When staying in a hotel in Clearwater Bay, the Westin is much better than the Raffles City.

The balcony of the family suite is spacious and you can see the invincible sea view. The hair dryer is Dyson's new style, and the toiletries are sf. I am satisfied with the details of the room.
The housekeeper, Darryl, is very nice, and the arrangements are thoughtful and thoughtful. I booked a seaside beach barbecue, which was difficult to book. The cheese lobster was fresh. The child ate two or three, and the grilled durian tasted very good. The family set meal at Xinchang Restaurant is unbeatable and cost-effective. We couldn’t finish it. The restaurant manager kindly helped us replace the steak with Qingbuliang, which was very flexible. The swimming pool is the favorite place for children, and the staff are friendly and responsible. They pay great attention to children's safety. The red bean ice in the swimming pool is a must. The breakfast standard is online, and it is very humane and can go until 11 o'clock. The room service meals are also delicious. We are satisfied with the salad, shrimp porridge, chicken wings, and desserts. The seasoning of the pasta is ok, but the noodles are not the round thin noodles that I like.
The children's paradise is not big, but the children don't care, and she is happy to have children playing together.
SPA is a place that I will go to every time I come. The manager has a vivid memory. He still remembers that the child got sunburned last year. This year, he continued to give us aloe vera after-sun care. The skin care products are also my favorite Farman. The child did it again this year Three bars of essential oil soap.
If you have to give suggestions for improvement, there are three points. The overall sanitation of the room is ok, but some furniture has a little floating dust, which can be improved; the swimming pool floor is very easy to burn bare feet after being exposed to the sun in summer. We have encountered it last year and this year. It is recommended to set reminders; clean up The cold taste is not as good as that on Lingshui Street, but it can be improved.
Very satisfied with the hotel, will come again next summer~

It is very suitable for family travel or the travel mode of taking the elderly directly to the hotel. It is a pity that this I only stayed for one night during the busy schedule, and I will come again next time. Finally, I would like to thank my housekeeper, Diana, for her excellent service.

We also went to the beach and experienced the BBQ buffet on the beach, as well as the beach food delivery at the restaurant by the pool, and the public swimming pool, all of which are very good! The breakfast is also very rich and delicious! Our housekeeper Ms. Diana Yan Jinyu is very warm and considerate. She helped us arrange the big yellow duck in the swimming pool, the double-sided bed surround to prevent children from falling, and the little yellow duck for children to take a bath. She is very thoughtful, and the daily WeChat reply is also very timely. ~ I had so much fun!

msg:During the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, I wanted to find a hotel where I could bring my baby easily. After booking, Xiaohongshu received a lot of good and bad reviews. Although I was a little worried, I made a reservation, so I came to try it. Unexpectedly, two days before I checked in, I was rejected. The hotel contacted and arranged for the housekeeper Leon Lin Chuansen, who was very attentive and responsive, and prepared children's products for children. The children liked it very much (I kept threatening to bring my younger brother next time). Maybe I arrived after 11 o'clock at night, so there was nothing to say on the Internet. Waiting in line, the room was cleaned very clean, the free drinks were abundant, and the capsule coffee tasted good. During the whole vacation, there was no consumption other than dinner and travel photography. Cleaning was also done very quickly. Breakfast was until 11:00 and I was very satisfied. , The seaside buffet is very beautiful (Accor's 30% off is also very fragrant), I don't think so about the old hotel decorations that are complained about online, this kind of Southeast Asian style with a bit of a sense of the age is unique, in short, it is the vacation feeling I want, Get up in the morning and go to the beach, come back from the heat and eat brunch 2 in 1, get up after a rest, eat some fruit snacks and go swimming, go to the beach when it’s cool, have a buffet for adults and children dig sand, catch crabs at night and release them, return to the hotel and drink until you’re a little drunk at any time Sleep, anyway, if you have any questions, just ask the housekeeper, call the front desk, don't worry about anything, just relax and vacation is ok, I will definitely come here again. (On behalf of lazy people, the hotel is too big. Although the promenade is beautiful, walking is very tiring haha, I suggest the hotel get an electric balance car or something for transportation)

msg:Although the room type was a bit oolong on the day of check-in, it took a long time to coordinate. But the next few days are quite satisfactory overall:
The overall area of ​​the hotel is very large, even during the holidays it is relatively quiet, the greenery is very good. The beach is very soft, but the lounge chairs feel a little far away from the sea. The bedding in the room is very comfortable, you can sleep well, the toiletries are ferragamo, and the daily mini The drinks and mini wine in the refrigerator are very good. I tried Raffles's signature spa, which is very professional and comfortable, and it is worth experiencing. The BBQ a**osphere by the sea is not bad, the steak is very good, and the seafood selection is a bit single. The breakfast is useless. The food serving speed and service of the restaurant by the KK pool need to be improved (when there are very few people, the attention/response of several waiters to customers needs to be improved)
Overall, it is still a good resort hotel. I would like to give special praise to my housekeeper, Leon. The very young boy always has a shy smile on his face, immature but sincere. During my stay, the response rate was 100% timely, and they were also very careful (I casually said that the little yellow duck in the swimming pool is not easy to control the direction, and I wanted to borrow a paddle board, and I made thoughtful arrangements for it)

The moment the car drove into the hotel, it seemed to return to Ubud all at once. From the decoration to the smell of incense, it was full of details. In a second, I met Bali in Hainan Island. The swimming pool and beach are also very beautiful. Clear Water Bay is indeed a beach that can sing, and I saw a very beautiful sunset here. The evening ceremony is also very special. In the candlelight, everyone sips cocktails and sings old songs together. It has a sense of a**osphere. I recommend everyone to experience it.
I would also like to thank our butler Lyndi for her considerate service. She arranged for us a room type where you can see the sunrise and also helped us with late check-out. If you have any problems during your stay, you will contact us as soon as possible to solve them.
Next time I come to Hainan, I will definitely choose Raffles Clear Water Bay.

msg:Raffles is the first stop of our family of 5 on our trip to Hainan. Lyndi, the hotel housekeeper, confirmed the itinerary with me two days in advance. During the stay, she was always online and gave timely help and replies, which was very considerate. On the first day of check-in, I gave the baby a little monkey doll from the hotel, and upgraded us to a sea view room.
The hotel is large but very clean, the gardens are well maintained, and the staff are exterminating insects every day.
This time I tried the beach barbecue, Xiaoqinglong oysters are free to eat, the taste is good, there are people singing on the beach, with the sunset and the sound of the waves, the a**osphere is full, but the wind is too strong that day, blowing sand on the face haha.
I also tried a Southeast Asian restaurant, the beef hor fun is delicious 😋
What's more special is that the hotel arranges a night ceremony every night. In the Steinway Hall, someone plays the piano and sings, and gives free cocktails. The a**osphere is very comfortable.
There are two swimming pools. One is more interesting. There are fountains and turtles spraying water. There are free swimming laps for children. You can also rent large swimming laps and boats. Children have a good time. The other swimming pool is relatively square and suitable for adult swimming.
In short, this trip is very satisfying. Compared with Sanya, there are fewer people here, the environment is good, and the service is good. recommend.

I come to Hainan almost every year. This time I chose the east route, because Lingshui is the first choice for parents and children, and Raffles is the best hotel in Clear Water Bay, which naturally became our first choice. Raffles is located in Qingshui Bay, Lingshui. The beach and sea water are very good. It is suitable for children to get close to nature. Our children like to play in the water and catch crabs on the beach of the hotel. Since the hotel has been open for a long time, the facilities may not be better than the new ones. The hotel, but it can show the initial intentions and current maintenance; the room service, Raffles’ service is really good, and try its best to meet the needs of the guests; because we only had breakfast, I think they are also good, the variety is not good It must be the most, and the taste is not bad; it may be because of the initial positioning, I think there are almost no parent-children, and there is nothing to do in the children's playground. Finally, I would like to thank 👍Wen Lei here. It is entirely his intention to have such a good experience staying in Raffles. He helped us solve some problems during check-in and proposed several solutions for us to choose from There is only one way to choose, and it will be dealt with very quickly; secondly, it will help us consider and arrange it from our perspective, basically without us worrying too much; finally, because our child has an allergic constitution and sudden allergies, he will always Care about the child's condition, and will ask about the child's condition after leaving the store. Thanks again for everything he did for us during our stay! Next time I come to Lingshui, I will definitely stay here again, not only because of Raffles Hotel, but also because of the Raffles staff who have been serving the guests, and because there is such a good hotel butler 👍Wen Lei! ! !

The buffet breakfast is rich and reasonable. The buffet dinner Xiaoqinglong and durian are open to eat, very nice. Travel photography is the best in the few stores I have stayed in.
During the stay, the housekeeper, Mia Xiaohu, has been helping me coordinate various matters. If I have any requirements or don't understand, I can find Mia Xiaohu, so I don't have to worry about anything.
All in all, it was a very pleasant stay, and I will come again next time.

I have stayed in high-end hotels in Haitang Bay, Yalong Bay and other bays before, but the experience was not as good as this one. The main reason is that all the service staff in the hotel I encountered were very warm and friendly, especially Lyndi, the deputy housekeeper manager, provided very thoughtful services throughout the process. Take care, help us upgrade the room type and late check-out, and take the initiative to consider various issues for us, very considerate. The hotel is in Balinese style, the photos are very good, the supporting facilities are also good, and the travel photos sent by the hotel are also very good-looking. It is also worth mentioning that the beach is very clean and delicate, and there are few people. The water on the beach is very shallow and the waves are not big, which is very suitable for staying by the sea. We experienced surfing and beach volleyball. The surf shop cooperates with the hotel, so there are not many people. We are the only ones at a time, and the coach is also very professional! I have already recommended it to friends around me, and I want to come again next time I go to Hainan~

Unfortunately, I encountered a head waiter with extremely poor service in the seaside restaurant, which is the biggest deduction for this hotel. I am too lazy to talk about the details, because the other waiters are too enthusiastic to make up for this shortcoming~
Seaside restaurants need to be reserved in advance. The seafood is very fresh and tastes good. It is highly recommended.
The view from the room is not bad, you can see the distant sea and a coconut grove.
The garden view of the entire hotel is very beautiful, one step at a time, and you can't stop taking pictures.
The breakfast is a little ordinary, the honeymoon arrangement is not particularly distracting, and the drinks in the minibar are not particularly delicious.
The swimming pool is awesome, it's shaped like a lot, there are many small pavilions, beautiful swimming rings, and the rest pavilion next to it is also well-arranged, caring~

Generally speaking, the feeling of staying this time is quite good, but I personally feel that the breakfast is still a bit flawed. Some food is overcooked, left for a long time, and the taste is not good. In addition, when the balcony door and the room door are both open, the wind is extremely strong, and the whole person will be taken away by the door and almost be brought down. If the elderly or children encounter it, it will be too dangerous.

I stayed at the Westin Clear Water Bay for the first two nights. On the third night, I decided to change to Raffles to experience it. After coming to Clear Water Bay to make preparations, when I arrived at Raffles Hotel, I clearly felt the enthusiasm of the service staff. The doormen at the front desk greeted the service warmly. The hotel's architectural style is Southeast Asian architectural style, and the service staff's clothing also has the characteristics of tourism and vacation. It feels like a vacation abroad, because my husband is very concerned about the view of the room, so I specially chose the Nanhai room type, that is, the room type that basically faces the sea. In order to avoid the coconut trees blocking it, I also asked the little girl at the front desk and the guest server Leon to ask for a higher price Floor requirements are met. Although the hotel has been built for many years, it should be maintained and repaired at ordinary times. The bathroom seat is already a smart toilet, and the wooden furniture and wooden decorations in the corridor will show traces of repainting and maintenance. The minibar in the room is free, but the variety is less than that of Westin😊The breakfast is very rich, which is better than Westin. The sea area opposite the hotel beach is very clean and better than Westin😀 (and the sea area opposite Westin is full of fishing boats, so it is a bit Lower the feeling 😜) Westin has a simple and elegant design style, while Raffles has a warm Southeast Asian resort style; the service of Raffles is better than that of Westin. Generally speaking, Raffles is better than Westin regardless of the price. But the price of Raffles is higher than that of Westin, so I don’t know if this comparison is appropriate. It’s just a random comparison 😁 Here, I would like to commend Leon for taking the initiative to add WeChat. During the stay, he took the initiative to ask about requirements and experience. All questions were answered satisfactorily, thank you. In the future, I will choose Raffles again🤗

msg:Seriously write a review of this hotel. Only the concierge guys make you feel that the service is particularly good. Others really need to improve, especially the front desk staff who give guests all kinds of excuses. Fortunately, the guests don't care after paying this price. People on vacation will not really argue with them. In short, a hotel whose price and service do not match may also have other factors that cause the service staff to be a little confused. I hope they can be trained and managed.

I would like to thank Ms. Judy of the hotel for helping us upgrade the room type for free and patiently answering various questions Question, the kind-hearted young lady is great! At the same time, I would like to thank Director Zhao in the lobby for helping to choose a room with a better view~ The hotel environment is first-class, the private beach is even more pleasant, and the breakfast is very rich!

The rooms are well ventilated, the water in the swimming pool is very cold, and the heated swimming pool is not very warm. I think it is more suitable for business people, and it is not so friendly to children, especially the restaurant. Be sure to complain, the dishes are okay, but the restaurant waiters feel that they are too lacking in training, and the hotel waiters are not very enthusiastic, but the butler Leon's service is very good

After all, it is a hotel owned by Accor. It is only a few steps from the hotel to the beach of Clear Water Bay. There are not many people on the beach. . There are also some activities in the hotel during the Spring Festival, which is very good! The breakfast variety is quite rich, but there are relatively few changes... After staying for 5 days, the feeling is basically the same... The service in the first three days of the Spring Festival was good, but the service staff felt less in the next few days. The cleaning of the room is average, so-so...

msg:I have never been to Clear Water Bay. I chose Raffles after comparing it on Ctrip. In the early stage, I saw many students stepping on thunder, and I was a little bit uneasy before moving in. We booked the most basic room type, and Ctrip Golden Diamond users can enjoy upgrades and late check-out. The surprise came. Before checking in, I was told that I was upgraded to a Lijing Seaview Suite for free, and I also got an extra bed for free. You said it was unexpected, but was it a surprise? That’s not counting. On the first night, after eating in the room, the guest room was given a bottle of champagne. After asking, I found out that a friend of the Grand Hyatt Xi’an asked the hotel’s food and beverage manager to give it to me.
Tell me about the hotel. The facilities are indeed old, but the service is still online. There is a butler when you check in, and Mia hu has relatively timely feedback on all requests. Coconuts and fruits are delivered, the room has turndown service, the waiter keeps replenishing water and drinks, capsule coffee machine, red wine glass, bottle opener, and ice bucket. The hygiene is OK, the toilet has a smart cover, and we put a toilet seat on it, which is more hygienic.
I think the breakfast is very rich, especially for bread lovers. The breakfast you eat for two days can be completely different. The Chinese food is also good, and the price is not expensive. Bonus points for this.
The swimming pool 🈶 constant temperature and 35-degree small bubble pool are very friendly to children.
The large lawn and beach are very suitable for me who loves to play Frisbee. The beach is really noisy, but the sanitation is only better in the hotel section. The service is online, and many tourists occupy hotel seats, but as long as there are hotel guests, it can basically help you find a seat quickly.
The hotel includes travel photography. It was originally planned to add no more than 1,000 films, but it ended up costing 3,000. However, the filming effect of Bojue Brigade is still worth it.
The only thing that annoyed me was that I booked the afternoon tea time and table for the next day. When I went down, I was told that the handover was not handled properly, which caused us to wait for 40 minutes. The shape of the afternoon tea is bigger than the content, so it is not recommended.
The hotel lanterns are brilliant.
If you can get up early, it is recommended to watch the sunrise.
Before checking in, I turned to Danjia Story. There is a small coffee shop with a good view. You can see Haitang Bay across the sea.
I didn't go to the sea, I didn't go to the scenic spots, I didn't go to the crowds, I just passed the time in the hotel. I will not comment on other services that have not been tried.

The fly in the oin**ent is that there are many guests during the holidays and a lot of temporary workers. The reception of several hotel restaurants is a bit unprofessional. In addition There are not enough washing facilities before entering the hotel after walking on the beach, and the glass doors of the daily necessities store on the 3rd floor are used to being opened by the waiters. This is a long corridor, and many children may chase after them. It is easy to install the glass door on the glass door if you are not careful. Yes, in this regard, I hope the hotel can pay attention to safety

From arriving at the hotel doorman to open the door and guiding you to Datang, to the housekeeper leading you to the room after check-in (Judy's five-star praise), and the welcome fruit and thoughtful cards after entering the room, we always think about the guests. Coupled with the whimsical ideas of the general manager of the hotel, Jerry Mong, the corridors with the first lights, the rabbit market on the lawn, and the beach barbecue by the sea, make you feel that the time of vacation is romantic and fulfilling. Also, the hotel's own Balinese style, you must do a travel photo. In fact, the hotel is full of scenery, transparent glass boats, flamingo swimming rings, long stairs, and fashion blockbusters can be shot at any time. You don’t have to worry about monotonous meals even if you don’t leave the hotel. Breakfast is until 11 o’clock, and it can be used as brunch, whether it’s Western or Hainanese. The chef of the Chinese restaurant is from the Whampoa Military Academy of Cantonese cuisine in Lei Garden. You will definitely not be disappointed. In a whisper, there is also a group buying coupon for Dianping. The beach barbecue for dinner, unlimited lobster and foie gras, as well as steak and grilled durian, and the final Haagen-Dazs ice cream and desserts are sometimes hard to part with. In short, anyway, just go! ! !

The swimming pool has a constant temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, and it is very convenient for surfing 🏄 ATVs, helicopters, and ports to go to sea. Judy, the room manager in the hotel lobby, was the most considerate, because I checked in at 8 o'clock that night, and the room was too far from the restaurant and the hotel lobby. Because my husband had just undergone a minor operation, she considered that it was not convenient for him to move, so she gave us the next day The location of the room has been adjusted, and the sea view suite has been upgraded. Coloring our holidays adds a sense of belonging. Special thanks to Judy

msg:Because I like quietness, my friend recommended Raffles in Lingshui. The location of the hotel is very good, very convenient to the beach. I told the hotel in advance that I needed to check in early, and the hotel arranged it very thoughtfully. Mia, the housing manager, added my WeChat when I checked in, and was very considerate to help us arrange restaurant reservations and other issues.
The seaside barbecue is very worth trying. I don’t think you can have such a good buffet in Shanghai at the same price. The hotel breakfast can be eaten until 11 o’clock, basically saving all Chinese food.
I hope I can respond to a few questions about the hotel. First of all, we have traveled abroad for a long time, and we are used to hanging the account on the room account. This is why I took the initiative to ask for an extra deposit as soon as I entered the hotel. Just pay directly. However, the hotel's self-service barbecue or morning buffet said that if I deducted the room bill, it would be more expensive. I don’t understand this logic…..Because I’m already a guest of the hotel, I’m also deducting my own money. According to the logic, we should get more discounts instead of asking me to go to Dianping to buy coupons or something. The.... This logic is very unfriendly to overseas guests.
The buffet dinner in the hotel is very delicious, but the Italian restaurant on the swimming pool is really not recommended, and the price/performance ratio is very low. It is extremely expensive, and the sea is not delicious. On the contrary, the fried chicken and sandwiches in the long bar are delicious. Hotel catering should maintain a uniform level!
In addition, Lingshui is actually very cold in winter, and it is impossible to go to the sea, but this five-star hotel does not have a hot pool or a heated swimming pool. What a waste of such a beautiful pool...a pity. I hope the hotel can take care of the guests who come in winter.... The travel photos provided by the hotel are very good, there are five free photos, and more choices are free.

Another special mention is in the lobby bar I ordered a cup of hot chocolate, but a glass of milk was served. I asked the assistant to change it and told me to confirm that it was correct. The white hot chocolate simply subverted my perception. Staff education should be strengthened!

msg:I personally think that Raffles belongs to the first echelon of Hainan resort hotels, and it is very suitable for those who pursue quality and cleanliness with few people. The resort style in Southeast Asia is very good. The place where the hotel enters is a replica of the Sky Gate in Bali. The lanterns on the corridor remind people of the lanterns in the ancient town of Hoi An, Da Nang, Vietnam. It is full of Southeast Asian holiday elements. I personally like it very much. . Compared with Haitang Bay and Tufu Bay, the waves on the beach are softer, and the sand is fine. It is very suitable for children to play, and children are very happy to ride the waves. The sea view of the room is not facing the sea but it is not bad, with a wide view. The facility is slightly old but does not affect the use. It is recommended that you do not need to spray perfume in the room. Personally, I think it is a bit too fragrant. The service is very good, and there are monkey conch as a gift of fruit, coconut and souvenirs. Both adults and children are very happy. In fact, it doesn't matter how much these small gifts are worth, what matters is that the experience is good. The housekeeper Judy responded in a timely manner and the service was very nice. The breakfast is also delicious, especially the soup noodles and pastries. It’s just that the Chinese restaurant tastes good, but there are few dishes suitable for children. If we can develop more children’s dishes, we will stay for a few more days next time. There are also some garden maintenance activities in public areas and commercial activities on the beach.

The hardware facilities of the hotel are also very good, the layout of the rooms is very reasonable, and the swimming pool is designed very large.
The service is even more perfect, there are ice water and towels on the beach, and there are various swimming rings and toys in the swimming pool area for free use. Especially the housekeeper Lu Jiarui, who helped to apply for a room upgrade, sent hotel dolls, and helped arrange snacks in the evening, which was so caring.

shortcoming:
1) The hardware maintenance is very poor. The facilities and design can have a sense of age, but they must not be dilapidated. A large number of indoor and outdoor veneers are damaged, which can be widely seen in elevators, wooden cabinets in rooms, corridors, outdoor tables and chairs in restaurants, etc.;
2) During peak occupancy on Sunday afternoon, plants are sprayed with insecticides. Even after the first complaint in the parking lot, the lawn will be sprayed again within half an hour.

msg:unexpected surprise
The first time I stayed at Raffles Clearwater Bay, it was strongly recommended by a friend, so I came to try it out. I didn't expect it to be really good.
- The room is huge: I booked a suite with an area of 130, two bathrooms, a kitchen and dining room, a wide and large balcony, and two or three large sofas. It is said that it is for two people. Why do I feel that six are all? spacious haha
- High food and beverage standards: Whether it is breakfast or the lobby bar, they are delicious. The most amazing thing is the barbecue buffet by the sea. 588 can eat crayfish Polong durian for one person, which is super awesome
- Perfect beach: The beach 🏖️ is wide and gentle, the sand is fine and clean, better than Yalong Bay, there is surfing on the beach🏄‍♀️ shop, one-to-one 500 per lesson (buy more and discount) is definitely cost-effective
-Intimate butler service: Butler Li Zhou is online throughout the whole process. If there are any questions, he will reply in seconds, and the arrangements are properly arranged. Because we came to the anniversary, we also received surprise gifts and roses🌹arrangement
No wonder my friends choose Raffles every time they come to Sanya, it really makes sense, and I look forward to my next stay
(If there is a larger indoor children's playground ➕ outdoor swimming pool slide water park, it will be perfect, it should not be difficult, if there is such a facility, I will not go anywhere in the future, all expectations for a seaside hotel have been ignored. Satisfy,)

msg:I have been eyeing the Raffles Hotel for a long time, but unfortunately I have not been able to make the trip. For this family vacation trip in Hainan, I specially rented a car and booked the swimming pool room that the children love in advance; the housekeeper Li Zhou called us the day before check-in. The date of check-in, the requirements for the room, etc.; after arriving at the hotel on the 22nd, the lobby design of the hotel has been loved! The housekeeper Li Zhou is already waiting for us to check in, and the room is ready! From the lobby to the room, the housekeeper Li Zhou has been very attentive to explain the hotel's facilities, activities and the most important food recommendations! The big yellow duck in the pool room amazes the children! During our stay, we had all kinds of questions, and the housekeeper helped us arrange and answer them as soon as possible! Very satisfied!
Beach: Qingshui Bay Beach, where the hotel is located, is known as a singing beach, and it really lives up to its reputation. The white sand beach and the sand are super fine. It can be said responsibly that Bialong Bay is better.
Parent-child swimming pool: This one must be praised. The design of the swimming pool is very good. The water area is large and the design is exquisite.
Dining room:
       Baiweixuan Chinese restaurant tastes amazing. Hainan famous dishes Jiaji duck and Wenchang chicken taste better than many old street restaurants in Sanya and Lingshui!
       The beach seafood buffet in Disha Village must be experienced. While enjoying the food, listening to the singing from the sea of Clear Water Bay is an unparalleled experience!
All in all, I am very satisfied with this trip. I thank the housekeeper Li Zhou and the staff of each depar**ent of the hotel for their hospitality. I have just left, and now I am looking forward to coming back to Raffles Hotel next time! Great journey!

Tropical garden, very Southeast Asian style, as if you are in Bali, 170+ suites, super wide and super long balconies can really hold parties every night, bathroom space is large enough ~ two showers can take a bath at the same time ~ very convenient, suitable for parents and children! Let's talk about the housekeeper Judy, the sweet and sweet service is in place. He delivered fruit for two consecutive days. On the same day, he explained all the services and projects of the hotel in detail. Before leaving, he made the swimming pool and solved it in minutes.

It is completely in the tropical rain forest. The beach is large, flat, and the sea water is clean. The room faces the sea and is very comfortable. Butler Li Zhou has good service.

The waiter in the restaurant is especially bad, the service can't keep up at all, the management of the supervisor in blue uniform is very poor, and the attitude is blunt and strong, Need to strengthen training! All in all, a hotel worth staying again!

I thought I was back in St. Regis, Bali. I could also catch crabs on the beach, and the children had a great time. The breakfast is also very good and there are not too many people. There is always a seat without queuing. For lunch, I ordered a bowl of ramen in the Japanese restaurant. It is not far from Haitang Bay, and it is very convenient to drive there. Every year in Sanya, I change hotels again and again, but I am sure I will come to Raffles next time. The kids play room saw cockroaches and needs improvement.

There are parent-child activities, we participated in catching sand crabs, followed the teacher to catch a lot, and the children had a good time. Victoria Lu took us to check in. She is a very enthusiastic sister and recommended a lot of useful strategies. The children like this sister very much. She is very kind.

The hotel's greenery is very good, the garden design can be seen very carefully, the beach is of good quality, soft and delicate. The room design is also very spacious and beautiful. Personally, I like the long bar very much, but it would be better if there are more choices of alcohol. Li Zhou from the front office is our housekeeper. He is very warm and thoughtful. He will make arrangements for our temporary inquiries and requests. 😀
The hotel operation is still not very mature, and I feel that the areas that can be improved are: the quality of breakfast, the quality of wine preparation, and the diversification of restaurant choices.
Overall a very happy stay experience! Value for money!

The only disadvantage is that the hotel's private beach does not provide any life-saving equipment for the tenants. I have stayed in many foreign island hotels. Standard The five-star beach hotel is guarded by special lifeguards, and provides life jackets or buoys to the guests who go swimming in the sea. This really needs to be strengthened. There are also many foreign tourists in the hotel. This is not an international standard, which is a pity.

The hotel is very large, the beach is white, and the breakfast is rich and delicious. There are not many people. Today, I arrived at Sun Bay, which I always thought of, but I miss Qingshui Bay very much. Sanya is too noisy and not enough for the quietness and leisure of vacation. The housekeeper Judy is enthusiastic and responsible, and the requests are quickly responded. The plush rabbit I held since I was a child forgot at the hotel. I called and asked, and immediately helped to send it out. I am very grateful to the hotel and Judy. I will recommend Raffles Clear Water Bay to my friends.

It was an important factor in my decision to come back! But there are also some small problems that I want to talk about. First, it is very inconvenient for the underground parking lot not to connect to the guest room. There is a musty smell. Generally, the hotel will have aromatherapy to maintain a certain fragrance or freshness. The third hotel has relatively old facilities and decorations. In addition, the exclusive style of wood is more humid and old. If it can be renovated, the room will be more colorful next year. It would be better, after all, the color of the room is a little depressed; the fourth is that the hotel entertainment facilities can be a little more, I feel that there is nothing except that the hotel is bigger and the beach is cleaner, or maybe I didn't find it? The last is breakfast. I think the standard is 200+ per person, but in fact, the variety is still less. In short, the beach is very clean and beautiful. I can lie on the beach for a day, but the price for the room is more than 3,000, and the price/performance ratio is a bit worse.

msg:Crazy call for Raffles Clearwater Bay👍
Advantages: countless, I will come together
1. Facilities: absolute top five-star hotel standards. The lobby is magnificent, surrounded by greenery, and it has a sense of sight in Bali, but I think it is much more beautiful than Bali. The family suite is invincible in size, with a large living room, kitchen and balcony. The most important thing is that the details are too much. The toilet and toilet are automatically heated. Every time you sit on it, it is warm and comfortable. The room is equipped with a beach bag and beach slippers, the necessary equipment for playing by the sea 😄 All switches are fully automatic and easy to operate.
2. Service: The service of the absolute top five-star hotel, the service is too unforgettable. Check-in is quick and easy, with one-on-one butler service. A welcome fruit plate is provided in the room and all drinks in the minibar are free. The waiter cleans carefully, responds to requests, and delivers things quickly to the room
3. Breakfast: The restaurant is quiet and elegant, with rich and varied things. The most important thing is that the service is so good, the chef will take the initiative to send some freshly baked food. Especially to praise Jeff, I went to have breakfast the next day, and he still remembered where I sat the day before, and remembered me eating one-sided omelettes and drinking hot milk, which was so touching. He also took the initiative to bring me fresh cut mangoes and freshly baked cookies. My God, the service is invincible. I instantly felt that I was enjoying the top VIP service, haha. Go to the hotel's private beach and outdoor swimming pool, and the service staff will provide towels and mineral water as soon as possible. The hotel provides free pick-up or drop-off service, but I am not going to the airport, I am going to the Westin Mannings, and the hotel also sent us there for free. Service in place, not rigid, let me feel the a**osphere of a top five-star hotel
4. Location: The hotel has a private beach, blue sky, white clouds, fine sand, and crystal clear sea water. It's so beautiful, so beautiful, take pictures as much as you like, my friends. The hotel's shuttle bus can also pick you up to the beach, which is very convenient. It's not far from Boundary Island, so you can drop by to play.
shortcoming:
Although there are many advantages, I still want to make a little suggestion.
1. The Wi-fi signal is not very good. If you are in the bathroom of the room or on the beach, the hotel's wireless network will be easily disconnected.
2. The toiletries are really average, especially the shampoo, which is too dry to use. If you stay in a hotel, the fairies still bring their own shampoo and conditioner.
3. The hotel will give you a travel photo, but don't take photos with the mentality of really taking pictures for free, because it's really not free. But it is also normal, there is no free lunch, I understand. However, the hotel can cancel the free travel photography, which means that it provides the service of paid travel photography, and the guests can decide whether to shoot or not.
Overall, this is an unforgettable hotel, I will come to Clear Water Bay again, and only stay at Raffles when I come to Clear Water Bay

They also prepared children's slippers, bathrobes and children's toothbrushes for the baby, as well as welcome fruits and desserts.

The overall service of the hotel is not very enthusiastic, but I am especially grateful to Frank, the manager of the swimming pool, who is very enthusiastic even in the rain.
Chinese restaurant tastes good, recommended. The western restaurant didn't open, so I didn't experience it.

Special thanks to Diana, the butler at the front desk, for his thoughtful and meticulous arrangements for our meals and accommodation during our stay, which made us feel like a spring breeze and a feeling of returning home. After 2 days and another day, I was a little reluctant to leave. The hotel full of exotic Bali has a beautiful environment, lush tropical plants, and lush everywhere, as if entering a tropical rain forest. Pool and beach package services are in place. The room facilities are complete, the suite is 215 square meters, spacious, comfortable, invincible sea view, drinks, snacks and fruits are readily available. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, and the Italian restaurant has excellent scenery and taste. I am very satisfied. The only shortcoming is that the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are a bit small, and I hope it can be improved. This is a hotel we like very much, and I will stay again next time I come to Hainan.

First of all, the sea view of this hotel is absolutely beautiful, the room is big enough, the balcony is also big, the garden design and architecture are Southeast Asian style, there is an underground parking lot, and it is convenient to eat nearby. Yan Jinyu and Diana received us in the front hall. They contacted me before we checked into the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, they kept sending us back to our room, and introduced the hotel's supporting facilities in detail. After checking in, he also carefully sent a message every morning. The message told me the meal time of the breakfast restaurant and the weather conditions. After I left the restaurant, I sent a message to me, which made me feel warm. I personally think that the highest level in the service industry is to listen to the voice of consumers, Raffles Front Office: Yan Jinyu, Diana did it, next time you come to Sanya, Raffles will be your first choice.

1⃣️ After we arrived and got off the bus, the bellman put the luggage on the trolley without giving us a luggage tag, no matter what. The first time I came to this hotel, I had no idea where to go and no one took us there.
2⃣️ After entering the lobby, the lobby is pitifully small, and during the epidemic, the staff did not wear masks, and only one of the four counters was occupied.
3⃣️ My member has welcome fruit. After I entered the room, I saw that there was no fruit. I called and asked the hotel staff. The hotel staff didn't even look at the check-in information, and directly said to me: "Your room is not available"!
4⃣️ I was told by this attitude that there was no welcome fruit in my room, I went directly to the front desk, the staff member in picture 5 rolled her eyes directly, but she didn't know what her surname was.
5⃣️ ⚠️ The most important point ⚠️ : I left my ID card at the front desk and told the staff at the front desk that a friend would come to pick it up later, but I didn't know that my friend would send me fruit. The staff at the front desk gave the ID card and did not even check the information, and directly gave the room card to my friends to let them enter my room. Can someone else come into my room if they call out my name?
6⃣️ When we left, the bellboy stood at the door and watched us load things into the car. He had nothing to do, so he didn’t know how to help, so he watched.

There is a damp smell in the room, and the safety is 0. If you want to stay, think about it.

The four-person suite was not equipped with enough towels. The room has a good view and faces the sea and can see the sunrise. The bubble activity of the children in the swimming pool is actually dangerous. The child choked on the trachea and vomited. It is recommended that the hotel consider the Internet celebrity activity planning and consider safety issues, especially for children. It is more convenient to have a dining street, but the constant temperature swimming pool is too small, the water is too cold, and the SPA technique is in place. I feel that the 1.5-meter switch power supply added after the second bed in the living room is not very convenient.

The service is very attentive. During the period when I was sick, I didn’t forget to ask me what else I needed here. The people are also refreshing and beautiful, and their voices are delicate and gentle. Thank you. This time my son was not feeling well, so he checked out one day early and went to the city to see a doctor. The front desk readily agreed. I think I should come again next time, because I haven't played enough. Some free projects are very good: such as making wormwood bags, making soap, children's archery... I also gained knowledge while playing.
In addition, there are some other opinions that are expected to be improved: 1. The rice is hard to eat! The breakfast was so bad that I lost my appetite. For dinner, my son wanted to eat foie gras, so he spent nearly 400 yuan to eat the worst roasted foie gras in his life. After a few bites, my son didn’t want to eat it. I didn’t get rid of the fishy smell. The outside was burnt, and the inside was blunt. After the meal, my son didn't say a word, and left very disappointed. 2. Children's entertainment charging items lack wisdom and creativity, that is, some ready-made goods bought from doll machines and Taobao are sold at high prices. In short, I have high expectations for the hotel, expect the hotel to improve and develop, and make its own ideas.

Although it has been open for nearly ten years, Raffles has successfully withstood the test of time. Although there are signs of aging in some parts of the guest rooms, the overall maintenance is still very good.
It means that the restaurant is the super star of Lingshui, but Baiwei is a little less interesting.
It's a bit cold in this season. It takes a long time to warm up for swimming. It would be better if there is a heated swimming pool.
The housekeeper, Curry, has been sincerely helping, and I am very grateful!
will come again

There are many demands for traveling with Xiaobao, and they can basically be satisfied in seconds, and the experience is excellent.

msg:This is my first trip around the island for my wife and I. Since Kaiyuan in Qizi Bay, I have been staying in a five-star hotel. Sanya has stayed at Mandarin Oriental, St. Regis Hotel, Kaaba Intercontinental, etc. Clearwater Bay Raffles is this round of the island. Traveling is currently the best service. From the moment you enter the hotel, someone enthusiastically welcomes guests and guides them, helping the co-pilot to open the door, rushing to help with luggage, and even the manager supervises the service on the front line. Li Zhou from the front office He is our housekeeper throughout the whole journey. He is very considerate and considerate to help us get acquainted with the hotel and upgrade the room types. It makes us really feel at home. The hotel’s beach is maintained by a dedicated person. The sand is very fine and can be launched into the water. If you are tired, you can lie on the beach. Drinks, the next morning’s breakfast, there is also a dedicated person to guide in the corridor, the details are very good, they are all lacking in other five-star hotels I have stayed in, afternoon tea, we did not finish the afternoon tea, the music and evening The Commander of Clearwater Bay is also good and worth recommending. My friends said that I had stayed at Raffles twice before and thought this hotel is very good 👍 Come on 💪

msg:I usually rarely comment on hotels. This time, my wife is really satisfying. I plan to bring a family to stay in this hotel's sea view suite in the off-season. Hahahaha, this hotel was recommended by my younger brother and sister. Mine, I originally wanted to take the baby to Hengren, but I couldn't book a room, so I went here. I have stayed in different hotels several times in Sanya, but this hotel is really luxurious, I'm glad I stayed in this hotel, This hotel is very big, the beach is also super beautiful, the sand is very soft and comfortable, dolls do not need to bring a beach toy bucket, it is provided for free, in short, the service is very good, the security of the hotel is still very high, my parents come to play We can't come in directly, we need to bring the room card to pick up. We stayed for two nights and didn't go all over the hotel. It's really big. The vegetation of the tropical rain forest is very rich, which makes it very comfortable to watch, except for breakfast. It's very delicious. Our housekeeper Xiaoyan is really, really good. She's beautiful and well-behaved. No matter how you adjust it when you check in, it's very good. Because our child has a cough, I just said that we need a room. Tide, the smell is not too big. The family room we booked is on the third floor, but the smell is a bit big. Xiaoyan helped us adjust it in time. I didn't ask to upgrade the room. I just wanted to change a room. Yan helped me arrange a suite, I was very surprised, I am not the kind of person who likes to look for trouble, she said she was very embarrassed and did not arrange for us, she heard me that we got up from 6 am to get there It was already after 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with the sick child, she was very considerate to us, she tried to help us apply for a sea view suite on the 11th floor, and when she left, she gave the child a gift of stuffed doll monkey and a cup, which was really caring , next time we all come, I must appoint you to find you😁😁

Finally, the clothes were retrieved and mailed to me after they landed in the hotel.
Besides, what needs to be improved is that the hotel does not have a large heated swimming pool, and the meals are also quite satisfactory, and I hope to strengthen it.

The butler service is in place, praise. I like the decoration of the hotel public area and aisle very much. They are well maintained, with a strong sense of vacation and tasteful decoration. The room is huge, and the big bathroom is so lovely, but it does have traces of years and is a bit old. There are really fewer people in Haitang Bay, the swimming pool and the beach are also very comfortable, and the beach feels better than Long Bay. If I hadn’t already booked the itinerary for Shangri-La in Haitang Bay, I would like to continue my stay. The gap between Shangri-La is obvious, and my husband and I have been reminiscing about the goodness of Raffles. Very recommended for couples travel ❤️❤️❤️

It is a certain distance from the airport, but it has a good sense of escape. The hotel is not new, and there are many hardware details. It needs to be improved, but the service is really good. Thanks to Li Zhou of the front office for his attentive service. Even if there is a problem, it will be solved in time.
A good hotel will give quick feedback on the effective suggestions of the guests. There was a Chanel surfboard in the lobby that was not well fixed the day before. If a child pushes it, it is easy to be injured. Check in with the person at that time. The employee said something, and the next day saw that the surfboard had been taken away!
Stayed for three days, already looking forward to the next vacation

msg:Escape the hustle and bustle of Haitang Bay and come to Raffles, which is full of Southeast Asian style. It seems that only the gardens here are worthy of the magnificent South China Sea. Service details reflect the level of the hotel, and guests will linger. The service and quality of check-in, beach, swimming pool and breakfast far exceed many five-star hotels in Sanya. Our housekeeper Judy is also responsive, patient but not lacking in a polite sense of space, making our stay experience more intimate and warm. I thought that the parent-child facilities might be inferior to the parent-child hotels in Sanya, but when I came, I found the opposite. The swimming pool is big enough, the sea view is beautiful enough, and you can go to the sea! Can go to sea! Even babies in shallow water can experience it! Qingshui Bay can be regarded as the place with the best water quality in Hainan (I have been to Hainan n times, and I have been to the beaches around the island). The surfing experience, the underwater boosters, etc. made our two boys linger and say that they will come here next summer vacation. The only shortcoming is that there are fewer choices of western food in the entire hotel, and there are also fewer choices for room delivery, which may have something to do with the epidemic. All in all, a worthwhile trip, highly recommended!

I chose a sea view room, the room is very large, the balcony can see the sea, and it is very fragrant to fall asleep listening to the sound of the waves every day.
I am satisfied with: First, the location is good, the beach in front is very soft, the sea water is clear and beautiful, and it is very convenient to walk 2 kilometers to the food street; second, there is capsule coffee in the room, the taste is very positive, and the coffee is rich in aroma , much better than the average hotel water-based coffee, don't miss it if you like coffee. The third is the housekeeper's service at any time, cleaning, turndown service, and fruit in the evening are all very good.
There are several areas for improvement: first, the breakfast variety is a little thin; second, the children's playground is the size of the smallest one I have ever seen. Generally speaking, there are not many supporting facilities for children.
The overall evaluation is ok, a more comfortable experience.

We live in a sea-view room on the 8th floor. Watching the sunrise is on the big terrace. The room is huge and well-equipped, especially the shower on the ceiling is comfortable. I really enjoyed staying here. Going out from the elevator on the right hand side down to the first floor is a swimming pool of various shapes. The swimming pool is less than 50 meters away from the sea. There are deck chairs for hotel guests to lie down and watch the sea. The hotel staff also handed over mineral water. From the beach, there are faucets to flush the sand, showers, and a row of bath towels for guests. The hotel environment is so beautiful, the grass, swimming pool, beach, sea, I feel I haven't had enough time in the morning. After contacting the housekeeper Qu Yang, we delayed the check-out time, thank you very much. The hotel concierge also used a battery to drive us to different areas of the hotel, which gave us a first-hand experience of the hotel's high-quality services.

msg:The hotel environment is elegant and has a Balinese flavor. Has its own beach. This time, my husband and I enjoyed the hotel's Friday night buffet beach barbecue, with seafood, meat skewers, desserts, fruits, drinks, and enjoyed the dinner. A small suggestion may be able to separate the smoking area and the non-smoking area.
The hotel is also very considerate and arranged a housekeeper for us. We are very grateful to our caring butler. He is Li Zhou from the front office. He arranged all the activities for us. I felt the care of the housekeeper and Raffles, which is awesome.
One more thing, this time there is a surprise. I tasted the bread pudding I ate in New Zealand for breakfast. This familiar taste makes me very happy.

The coastline is very long and you can have a panoramic view of sunrise and sunset. I woke up this morning and took aerial photos of the sunrise, beautiful! Let me mention a few points. The water in the shower room wouldn't go away. Even after repairing it once, it still didn't work. It was barely usable. The light at the entrance to the room kept flashing, which didn't affect my sleep, so I didn't bother to mention it. Grace at the front desk is relatively professional, and Curry, the housekeeper, is also very considerate and responsive to all requests. It's just that the service awareness and level of the Long bar and restaurant waiters need to be improved, at least to match the quality of this hotel.

It is suitable for people who have been to Sanya a few times and don't want to go to the scenic spots but stay in the hotel. Because the hotel is really a proper holiday style, Bali is full of style. Especially Li Zhou, the front office of our housekeeper, contacted us to ask about the room requirements before we moved in, and helped us upgrade the room with great sea view😃.
After three days in the hotel, the overall experience is very good. I like the clean resort a**osphere of the hotel and the enthusiasm of the service staff. Will stay again next time.

msg:After three months, I returned to Raffles and stayed for one night. I contacted Li Zhou, the previous housekeeper, and booked a room with an invincible sea view.
Hearing from Li Zhou that the hotel also hosted the GQ annual festival some time ago, it really surprised me. I didn't expect Raffles to be out of the circle so soon.
Compared with the hotel service as always and attentive three months ago, the housekeeper Li Zhou is still humorous, the room also specially prepared an epidemic prevention kit, and the shower gel was also changed, which is my favorite taste. The flowers in the hotel lobby are also very different from before, which is in line with the hotel's positioning.
I hope this Raffles, in addition to being out of the circle, can stand out from the group of luxury hotels. After all, I often come back to be received by a familiar housekeeper. It is as cordial as going home. Who doesn't want their home to be better.

Although it was a temporary visit to Qingshui Bay Raffles, it refreshed my understanding of the hotel. For the first time, I felt that the hotel service could be so good. It was night when it was very heavy rain. When we went to the front desk, we didn’t book the room in advance and wanted to check the room type first. Ms. Yan Jinyu Diana in the front hall immediately arranged for someone to take us to the room, and she was very patient. Introduce the hotel rooms and some of the hotel’s facilities and equipment. On the way back to the room, she has been chatting with us enthusiastically. When she knew that I was a heavy SPA lover, she helped me make an appoin**ent for the SPA as soon as possible. Intimate, after sending us back to the room, she considered that it was not easy to get the takeaway on a rainy night, and she alone helped us deliver the takeaway luggage. Although we only stayed for one night, her service was in other hotels. What can't be experienced, she is a good housekeeper who will consider us, and she is also a very cute and enthusiastic little fairy. If I come next time, I will definitely ask Diana to be my housekeeper.

msg:Stay in this hotel during the National Day holiday. A hotel building with a subtropical style in Southeast Asia has a V-shaped layout and embraces the best beach in Qingshui Bay. Here coconut trees are surrounded by green grass and the hotel’s own beach is within easy reach. In the sunset, you can play in the self-service barbecue swimming pool beside the beach. Play on the balcony. Listen to the rain and beat the bananas... The long corridor and the spacious music bar make people forget to return. Next time you stay, you must choose the sea view room and the beautiful and quiet girl Liu Xingyu is the service housekeeper.

msg:I came to Qingshuiwan for the first time because I met a lovely girl, Lynn, in Xi'an. She came to Raffles Hotel to work in the restaurant. Because of this fate, I started this trip. Before leaving, Lynn was very careful to help me with a strategy and introduce the room. Also deliberately picked me up at the door with the butler Curry Liu Weichen. It seems that the relatives I have seen thousands of miles away are particularly beautiful. The hotel is quite Bali's Nanyang style architecture, and feels very quiet and comfortable during the long holiday. The pool room is super nice, and you can also swim in the pool at night as a family. Specially booked BBQ on the beach. The ingredients are very rich and the taste is delicious. Watching the sunset and listening to the waves hitting the shore, there is a special flavor. Thank you for Lynn’s itinerary design and arrangement in advance, and thank Curry for taking care of me during the three-day stay. I will send messages every day to ask if there is anything I need help, and I will reply to guests’ messages in a timely and thoughtful manner. Finally, my dear Lynn is happy to work and live a happy life here...

msg:I have been at the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay before. This time I tried the Raffles in Clear Water Bay. I was very satisfied with the experience. There are few people and beautiful scenery. The 170-square-meter suite is fully equipped and equipped with yoga mats for yoga on the large terrace. The clear water, barefoot on the delicate and soft white sand, a standard swimming pool and a children’s special-shaped play pool, satisfying both adults and children for swimming, especially the service is very considerate, the staff will send dried heat by the pool Bath towels, seaside staff will promptly lay clean beach mats on beach chairs for guests lying on the beach. The breakfast buffet is rich and of good quality. Pancakes and fruits are a must-eat. The most commendable service is the service. Smiles everywhere. The service, especially the 360-degree service provided by the butler Liu Xingyu from day one to the fifth day is even more thoughtful and thoughtful. The whole family is satisfied. Anyway will choose Raffles next time!

Service 5 stars: the hotel staff are very kind, the housekeeper Xiao Li will send WeChat greetings every day to inform the weather conditions, and we will take the initiative to ask for related services without us asking!
Facilities 5 stars: the hotel's private beach, clean, soft, and of high quality!
Catering 3 stars: The most regrettable thing is that the quality of the hotel meals is really unsatisfactory, which is far from the Edison later. The prices of the meals in the two hotels are similar, but the quality is too different. Raffles should change to an executive chef, otherwise it is not recommended to dine in the hotel.
I am generally satisfied. I will consider staying in Raffles in the future, but I will eat out.

The swimming pool is very distinctive, and outside the hotel is the singing beach with white waves and fine sand. The hotel called one day in advance to inquire about our needs. It was a big surprise for us to learn that it was our wedding anniversary. Not only did we decorate the room on the day of check-in, but also upgraded us, especially Li Zhou in the front office. Very attentively introduced us to the hotel's facilities, restaurant location, etc. Added WeChat to communicate smoothly and respond to requests. Every morning, there are warm reminders. Before leaving, we were sent to the car 👍👍. Thank you very much for the warm reception of every staff member of the hotel, which made us feel at home. I will come again.

msg:First of all, as a six-star hotel, the hotel environment has nothing to say. It is definitely one of the best hotels in Sanya. The overall Southeast Asian island resort a**osphere is very harmonious and complete. The landscape is very beautiful, and it has a vacation vibe. It is not simply a six-star Internet celebrity hotel. The living experience is very good. In fact, it is very suitable for honeymoon or chill with children. Living in such an environment for a week will not get tired. By the way, I want to emphasize that the hotel’s gym is the most complete in all hotels. It is definitely not a so-so and simple configuration. The equipment is very complete and can support the whole body muscle training. What's more commendable is the attitude of the hotel staff are very good. It feels like these hotels that are more parent-child, resort style rather than pure Internet celebrity hotel services are much better. Special thanks to the front office Li who has been helping us. Manager Zhou Li, the super nice service is very good ~ responsive ~ and we have upgraded the room type for free. Generally speaking, it is a very satisfying experience. I am very happy that I chose Raffles this time. I have been to a great hotel that I want to take my family to again~

msg:🚗Transportation: In Clearwater Bay, which is far away from the city and the airport, it is recommended that passengers who choose this hotel must rent a car to travel, otherwise it is not too convenient! But being more remote is also good, that is, to reach the beach through the hotel’s landscaped and swimming pool area. The beach is very quiet and clean. It has not been compared to other beaches in Sanya, but I think this rare peace is very good.

In addition to remoteness, this Raffles experience is really almost full score:
🍃Environment: I purchased the hotel for two nights + SPA package, and upgraded us to a sea-view room. The invincible sea view through the big balcony when the door is opened is amazing (not sure what will happen if the room is not upgraded) The decoration style is also mine Like, the use of colors and details in a southerly style, the promenade and lobby bar feel like the official residences of the colonial officials in Maugham’s book for holding cocktail parties.
🔔Service: The service is very good. The butler (Nava Liu Xingyu) who was equipped during check-in paid attention to our needs and check-in experience throughout the whole process.

⚠️Finally, I will say a few more objective reminders: 1. It is really not recommended to choose without a car. The nearest downtown restaurants are within a half-hour drive; 2. If you choose a hotel to dine, you must have sufficient budget, and the hotel has Chinese/Italian food , The price is high, the coconut green is 4-5 times the price outside, but the taste is good.

msg:I went to Park Hyatt last year. The price this year was a bit tough. I changed to Raffles, which was unexpectedly good. The room was booked the day before departure. Because there is no big bed, I noted that the hotel was happy to help upgrade to a big bed family suite, and the balcony was big enough to play table tennis. Although it is the Mid-Autumn Festival, the most crowded time is during the breakfast period. At other times, no matter the pool or the beach, it is very quiet. The service details are in place. There are staff at the pool and beach who hand over towels and ice water at any time. The beach and water quality are not as good as Sun Bay. Although there are some years, it is obvious that the hotel hardware has spent a lot of money, and the texture is well maintained. The overall style is not the popular feeling of filming Internet celebrities, but more like a holiday in Bali. In particular, the little brother Liu Weichen in the lobby was very enthusiastic about introducing the facilities from the beginning of the check-in. The flight was over 7 o'clock on the last day, so he directly helped to delay the check-out until 4 o'clock. The only downside is that the meals are a bit of a poor standard. Breakfast and Chinese restaurants are average, but there are food stalls within walking distance and it is convenient to order takeout. It is the best choice for a holiday in Sanya in the future.

After playing in the city, everything has been arranged for the room at night, which is too economical. Heart. We are also very considerate during our stay. Seeing that the three of us take the initiative to help upgrade to a suite, what we want, data cable, delivery of drinks, help to open wine, as long as a WeChat is arranged properly no matter what time it is, we will send a message every morning Informed of the weather conditions, would take the initiative to greet, and indeed felt all the services they should have.

msg:An unexpected surprise
This trip deliberately looked for a quiet hotel, so I chose Raffles, low-key but luxurious.
What surprised me was that the butler girl contacted me in advance, asked me the time of arrival, and arranged a room for me in advance. I didn't expect it to be so thoughtful, hahahaha.
The consequences of arriving at the store were as stated on the phone, but Liu Xingyu, the housekeeper, was waiting for me at the front desk. I have to say that the butlers trained in low-key luxury hotels are also very personal. I especially like this style. Every time wechat is warm and interesting, it is witty and humorous.
The happiest thing is that this trip met the hotel hosting a party, my goodness, I quickly asked Liu Xingyu, it turned out that the hotel was hosting the White Moon Night. Liu Xingyu graciously invited me to participate. I suffered from the lack of white pants and skirts and took a lot of beautiful photos.
Next time I come back, I will continue surfing. The surf shop opened by the luxury hotel has a different response. The boss is handsome, hahahaha.
Next time I come back to ask Liu Xingyu in advance when there is a party, fish in troubled waters, hahahaha.

To be honest, I live in a lot of hotels in Sanya. Raffles gave me the feeling that the most professional sense of vacation is straightforward. If you really want to have a relaxing holiday, come to Raffles, go to Clear Water Bay in the morning and evening to wash the beach, and in the evening to eat seafood at Dan's house, the day is so pleasant!

In addition to the super comfortable rooms, the gardens are uniquely artistic In addition, it is worth mentioning that the breakfast room and the Chinese restaurant are also very good, especially the Chinese restaurant. Almost all the dishes are delicious even after three visits. There is no thunder at all. Finally, I would like to give special thanks to my housekeeper’s front office and Super Nice Liu Weichen.

Good beyond expectations! Let’s talk about the room first. The room is reserved for a family parent-child room. The minimum area of the room here is 80 square meters or more, and all have super large balconies. The view is great and the privacy is very good. Secondly, I have to talk about the service. I have to name and thank the Li Zhou Xiaoli butler in the front office for his thoughtful and thoughtful service. I will answer all questions and requests. I will ask at the right time every day what time to clean the room without disturbing our rest. Will work tirelessly to help us get takeaways. The third is the hotel’s catering. In fact, the hotel’s restaurants are quite good, with a rich variety of breakfasts, and there are many restaurants to choose from for lunch. Finally, let’s talk about the scenery of the hotel. The children’s pool park in the hotel is really a paradise for children. There is also a sea view of the desktop background picture and the endless clean and uncompressed silver beach. You can relieve all the pressure and troubles, and it is a very worthwhile hotel! Next time I will choose to stay here for a few more days!

The overall environment is good, too big to get lost 😂 Front office housekeeper Li Zhou is even more attentive. The bed we booked for a twin room felt a bit small. Xiao Li immediately helped us adjust the room and upgraded it directly to 150 The flat big suite is simply beautiful! You can watch the beautiful sunrise from the large balcony of the room 👍🏻 And everyone must rarely watch the moon rising on the sea. This time I witnessed the big moon rising in the sea with my own eyes. It was really amazing to me! So beautiful! And the sky is full of stars! On our afternoon flight, Xiao Li also took the initiative to help us with late check-out service 👍🏻 Next time I go, I will choose Raffles. By the way, one thing that is not as good as Capella is in terms of food and beverages, especially if there are no better fruits, such as mango 🥭 No good fruits such as lotus mist rambutan ☹️ Desserts are also slightly inferior 😟 Others are good 👍🏻 ( 9 pictures can't show the beauty of Raffles at all)

First of all, I just entered the hotel with a strong Southeast Asian resort style. If you are tired of living in the Internet celebrity hotel in Haitang Bay, you can try this one. This time I stayed for three days and haven't finished shopping. I heard that the hotel has 160,000 square meters. The beach of Qingshui Bay is also much better than that of Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay. The rooms are also 88 square meters, which is almost the size of the suite. The downside is that the quality of individual service personnel in restaurants and spas needs to be strengthened. Don't affect the overall level of the hotel because of a few links. I would like to give special praise to Li Zhou in the front office. Once I checked in, I helped take the luggage and lead the way. After I added WeChat, I helped arrange every link every day, and finally helped coordinate and solve my problem. Praise!

It can be seen that its design and construction are very careful. In the hotel, there is a large area of famous "singing beach" in Qingshui Bay. I have been to Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay before. The sand in Qingshui Bay is indeed much better than the former two, it is fine, clean and soft, and there are few people and quiet. You can play and appreciate it slowly. The bedding and accessories in the room are very good, and the required items are supplemented in sufficient and timely manner. Every service staff I met took the initiative to say hello, gentle and enthusiastic; especially our housekeeper, Curry, helped us upgrade the room type, and gave the children a cute little tree monkey mascot (especially cute) to help with various reservations during the stay. , Consultation and late check-out. Although the young man is young, he is professional, enthusiastic, positive, and reliable. Very good!
In addition, I also want to give Raffles some suggestions. I hope that the prices for catering and parent-child activities will be more reasonable in the future (for example, in-room Wi-Fi and TV watching movies are also charged, so there is no need) parent-child activities can be charged according to the activities. It's okay, but any activity now has a flat price of 128/person (the official website discount is also 98/person), which is too inhumane.
I sincerely hope that Raffles can do better and better and become a real paradise.

This is also very good, mainly because the area is large enough and very magnificent. 3. The service is in place. For example, after swimming on the beach, the little brother who is responsible for safety on the coast will put a bottle of ice mineral water on the beach chair, which makes people feel very good. 4. The design style does not say, I really like buildings like Mayan castles. 5.

If you have to say regrets, it is that the children report that the beach is too "clean" and cannot find any shells and hermit crabs to pick up. Unlike the beach in Sanya, which can be played, it may be more suitable for couples. In addition, the exclusive butler Liu Weichen is very good.

I rarely write reviews, this hotel really meets my taste, so write more.

msg:Stayed for 2 nights, I really like the Southeast Asian style of the hotel, but the most important thing is that the details here are well done, butler-style service, my butler Curry will take you to stay, and I will introduce you to the details of the hotel in the process , Very meticulous, because I had a temporary video conference on the last day, I contacted him at 11 o'clock in the evening to help delay the check-out. He was very enthusiastic to help arrange and solve my urgent needs. The hotel staff are very polite, and they will greet each other initiatively. The Chinese restaurant tastes good, although the price is a bit on the high side. The swimming pool is great and winding is very interesting. The beach is very quiet, there are few people, and the sand is very fine. You can go here for an afternoon if you have nothing to do. I also participated in the hotel's handmade soap making activities, which can be taken back as souvenirs. The breakfast may be more varied and better. The overall experience is great, you can choose here if you don't like noisy. I only stayed for two days this time, I feel that I didn’t live enough, I have to come again next time

The balcony is oversized and there is a sofa. It’s so enjoyable to blow outside! I ordered breakfast, and the buffet style is quite diverse. However, it is more expensive to eat in the restaurant by yourself. The hotel has a high green coverage rate and is relatively quiet, suitable for those who like quietness. The hotel pool is also highly recommended!

Very good choice, the beach is also very beautiful! Thank you curry again! Heartwarming

The very quiet environment is very suitable for a quiet rest and vacation. The sea and beaches are also excellent. The gym is full of Technogym, and the point is that there are few people. Spa is distributed in 12 single-family villas, and my sister who is responsible for serving twice is also professional and meticulous. The very caring butler service throughout the whole process, thank the butler Curry Liu Weichen for being responsive 24 hours a day, and finally sent me two glasses of the Hainan version of Singapore Sling, moved!

msg:This time I stayed at the Raffles Hotel in Clearwater Bay. I was actually a little worried about whether the hotel facilities would be old, but the location and the large green coverage made me very excited to choose. The day before I arrived, I received a call from the hotel butler, Curry, and asked me if he needed any special preparations. I learned that we have upgraded the parent-child room type with children. To tell the truth, the preparation of the telecommunications in advance will really let the customers. Feeling of going home and being respected. After arriving at the store, Curry led us to the room and carefully introduced the hotel’s regional layout features, and prepared welcome fruits. In the following days, he also managed to answer questions in time and provide a full range of services. This is a very, very bonus point. I personally think that butler service will be one of the key considerations when I choose a hotel for vacation in Hainan.
Talk about the hotel environment: the greening is really great, the gardening party and friends who love nature deserve to have; the room part, first of all, the space is really large, the cloakroom, makeup, washing, shower and toilet bathtub are all separated by area , The privacy is very good, individual equipment can be seen a little bit new, but it does not affect the use at all, but adds a simple and elegant temperament, the bedding is great, it is suitable for sleeping until natural wakeup, and it is also cute and practical for children The daily necessities, thank you very much; the breakfast is a self-service, rich variety, suitable for all ages, both north and south, and it is also very fresh, and the meal time is from 7 to 11, so you don’t have to worry about getting up and eating. Dinner, the taste is also very good; the pool has a shallow water area suitable for children to play, there will be staff to bring water and blankets, lifeguards are also on standby, you can see the sea in the pool, the experience is great, and the temperature is constant, don’t worry Cold; Needless to say, the beach is definitely a big selling point. It is clean and delicate. To what extent, you can hardly see any shells. Don’t worry about the chrome feet. You can see the sunrise. There are airport buses and duty-free shops. Convenience.
All in all, it was a great trip. Before leaving, Curry also prepared gifts for the children. It seems that it won't come next time! Full score recommendation!

There is also a dedicated butler responsible for all the affairs during the stay. Thanks to our butler Curry, the room just went in. After the rain, I asked for a room change. The housekeeper immediately contacted and took us to see the new room. The hotel’s parent-child activities and afternoon tea reservations, including outing trips, were all handled by the housekeeper, and the service was very good. 👍🏻👍🏻 Parent-child activities are more regular, and the swimming pool is not particularly big, but the children are rushing into the sea, digging for sand, and the bubble pool is also enough. Generally speaking, it is a hotel that is more suitable for a daze. 👍🏻

After I explained to the front desk on the phone, the old man and the child also checked in smoothly. The water in the special-shaped swimming pool is not very clean, and the use of the hotel swimming ring seems to be charged. In addition, the use of the 200 yuan meal coupon included in the package was not smooth. I was very hungry after swimming. I took my child to the Chinese restaurant and wanted to use the meal coupon. First, it said that the meal coupon could not be used after 9 o'clock. Obviously, the reservation page did not explain that it was restricted. Usage time... After repeated communication, we reluctantly agreed. We booked 2 rooms so we had 400 meal coupons. The restaurant said that they could not be used in combination, but when we checked in, the front desk said yes, so we had to split them into two orders and order separately...

msg:Fabulous setting and nice room, terribly poor service.
First of all, my housekeeper Liu Weichen has a very good service, meticulous and decent, and responds very quickly. The other service staff have absolutely no service awareness and never trained? ?
1. I decided to live in Mingmingshan without deposit on Ctrip. The front desk still asked for a deposit. After I refused, the front desk said: So you don't want to pay the deposit, right? ! ? Obviously don't need to pay, now it's like I refuse to pay.
2. Speechless, the waiter broke into the door without permission to deliver fruit! ? ? Can't believe this is what a 5 star hotel does. I was sleeping in the afternoon and heard a knock on the door, I asked if something happened? result! ! Did the waiter swipe the card directly in? ? I quickly let the door go.
3. Breakfast arrived at 10:30. There is no fruit. Let's have some noodles. The noodle-cooking guy couldn’t communicate. I asked how to order, but I didn’t say anything. The aunt next to me is also complaining about the same situation.
As for the service staff on the road and other encounters, they all had a cold face. The hotel itself is very good, the garden is beautiful, the rooms are beautiful, and you can see the sea without the sea view, second * a pool room in the east. I don't know if I have written so much. It's a pity that the service staff is not worthy of such a good view.

msg:The hotel gives five stars without a doubt. Let me talk about accommodation first. This time I chose the Lan Hai Xuan Family Twin Room and stayed for three days. The three big and one small stay is very comfortable. The rooms are large in size, with great sea views and large balconies, very well laid out, very suitable for bringing a family with you. The furnishings of the room are very good, and they are added promptly.

If you eat, breakfast will be 7-11 o'clock, there are a lot of things to eat, and the taste is above average. I chose a Chinese restaurant for two consecutive days for dinner. It tastes good. There is no dish under the radar, and the price is acceptable, about 200 per person. The menu of the Southeast Asian restaurant changed a few days ago. There is no Southeast Asian cuisine, which is a pity, but the snacks taste good.

For service, the butler curry is very good. Five-star praise. Respond promptly. He gave us the takeaway to the room. It's great. The service staff to clean the room is also in place. By the way, I made decorations for my parents' 40th anniversary, thank you very much.

For entertainment, there are two swimming pools, so the experience is very good because there are not many people. There are also underwater propellers and other things to rent, which adds to the fun. The price is also acceptable. The hotel’s gym and ping-pong room are also very good, the environment is good, the key is no one. The experience is very good. The staff will take the initiative to greet you when you see them on the road.

Let’s talk about the slight deficiencies. That is, the hotel is indeed a bit old, and the hardware is really old. If it is renovated, it will definitely be the first for me to come to Sanya.

The balcony of the large room can be used for race and running. I live on the second floor. It should be very convenient to have a swimming pool on the first floor. The whole hotel has a Southeast Asian style, greenery and ecology. In addition to the children's pool, there are two large swimming pools, one for circular entertainment and the other for square exercises, which can well separate the two types of people who play in the water. There are equipments by the pool and the beach, which can be rented for free/for a fee. The sand on the beach is relatively loose but not very delicate by the hotel. The sand facing the sea outside is very fine and tight, like the hard feeling of stepping on the concrete floor, the so-called beach that can sing. The waves are big and suitable for surfing. Although the waves are not as big as Wanning, the beach is more beautiful and less beautiful. Along the beach to the west is Qingshuiwan Beach. There are many photography settings for taking online celebrity photos (you will have to charge for entering with long guns and short guns, and there is no charge for taking pictures with your mobile phone)

The service is remarkable: on the day of check-in, the family brought a lot of cash bags in Shangri-La, the welcoming Takamatsu, and a colleague named Dong actively helped us contact taxis and hotels, and found the bags smoothly. came back. The housekeeper Li Zhou is attentive and responds immediately to any questions.
Regarding food: There are not many types of barbecue on the beach. The leftover ingredients are fresh and taste good. It would be better if there is a resident singing. The Chinese restaurant is good. The Southeast Asian restaurant only went to the restaurant. There were 7 of us and we couldn't order the food. In the end, we went to the Chinese restaurant. Breakfast and afternoon tea were not outstanding.
Regarding SPA: The technician’s technique is very good, the work is very comfortable, and the environment is very comfortable. There are bathing pools and steam rooms, but the reception process is not smooth. After finishing the work, we don’t have much rest, so we are invited to leave. Yes I thought I would be in the lounge, but I was at the front desk. This is too weird. There is no small snack to eat. This is too important for people who have just finished the SPA. Anxious to leave, so are the room facilities furnished?
Regarding children’s amu*****t: The children’s playroom is really small and has a lot of activities. It is relatively suitable for younger children. The hotel is very large. I hope this area can be expanded.
About the room: It's really big and comfortable. The materials used are also very good. The large bathroom is independent of the room. This is particularly good. It is soundproof and moisture-proof, and the balcony is also large. You must first have a sea view room. The swimming pool in the pool room is too small, suitable for younger children, but it is very close to the breakfast room and the swimming pool

First of all, the environment is very, very good. I walked into the hotel after I got off the car. At that moment, I felt like I was in Bali. The feeling of a hotel really resembles that of Bali in Thailand! The room is also very large. Our two big and two small stays are very comfortable, especially the oversized balcony. The children really like it. Looking out, the lush greenery and the sea view can be seen. Then the most impressive thing is the service. No matter which hotel staff you encounter when walking in the hotel, they always say hello with a smile, especially the housekeeper Liu Weichen. From the beginning of my stay, I will answer all questions and respond to requests. Anyway, I just ask Xiao Liu for anything. By the way, he will help me solve it in time. The service provided by this hotel makes people feel particularly comfortable, feels just right, and is very intimate in details. For example, each room will have a practical and high-value beach bag. For guests to go to the swimming pool and beach, the staff will take the initiative to send bath towels, room temperature water and ice water, children’s swimming ring and sand dredging tools can be borrowed for free when they go swimming in the pool. I feel that there will be no need for a lot of things next time. I brought it 😝 Finally, the Chinese restaurant’s products are also very good, although the price is not cheap but not outrageous, the taste is very good 👍

Then, on the last day, he learned that our flight was cancelled and re-registered very late, so he helped to apply for a 4 o'clock check-out. During the stay, I also cared very much about us and responded to requests. The hotel’s sandy beach is very fine and the water is clear, and the children have a great time. The two swimming pools can also fully meet the needs of adults and children. Although there was a short queue for breakfast, the time was completely acceptable. Overall, I was very satisfied. The price/performance ratio was very high and it was worth staying!

msg:I have been planting Caolingshui Raffles for a long time, because the orders for the two years before the epidemic have been booked and then refunded, this time I finally made it. I came from the hustle and bustle of Yalong Bay to live for two days. It is quiet and leisurely here, and I feel free to myself; The beauty at the front desk recommended a room on the third floor with the lobby and close to the lobby bar. It is very convenient to go to the restaurant and children’s paradise swimming pool to go to the beach. For two children, the regret of not seeing the sea view is almost negligible. I am worried that the hotel’s vegetation is lush, the floor is not high, and there will be more mosquitoes. In fact, there is no mosquito disturbance in the room. Of course, you should bring the mosquito repellent in the room when you go out at night; the cleaning aunt is serious and responsible, and clean the room the next day and rearrange it. It took an hour, from the time we went out for breakfast and lunch to clean until we returned to the room after eating, it was not over yet; the room at Lan Haiju was very big, with oversized wooden decorations, basically no plastic products, and high humidity at the seaside. The place is a bit old and is still acceptable; this beach at the entrance of the hotel is a real treasure, with clear water and young sand. It feels like flour when you step on it. There is less garbage and the air is cleaner. There is no fishy smell. In the evening, the children caught more than 20 crabs. They were very happy. They almost played all over the beaches of China. The only one here, Yalong Bay is also very good, but there are too many people. Regarding dining, this time I only experience it. I have buffet breakfast and Baiwei Chinese restaurant. The breakfast is more exquisite, freshly squeezed juice is also delicious, and the environment is also good, but the variety is slightly less, it would be better if you can add more sushi, cut coconut and so on, Baiwei Chinese restaurant The taste is not bad, but I hope that the menu can be accompanied by more pictures. We ordered [face face] while watching online reviews. It is also very convenient to order takeaways to the concierge reception; the hotel’s swimming pool is very clean The water is always circulating. When the sun is severe, there is also a shaded place under the bridge where children can play with hairy hair. Ordinary swimming rings are borrowed for free. The lifeguards in the swimming pool deliver water and towels in time, and the care is more in place; especially worth mentioning It is Mr. Li Zhou from the front office. From check-in to check-out, he is almost responsive. He is very prompt, sending water, quilts, band-aids, flashlights for catching crabs, arranging aunts to clean and pull luggage, etc., and will take the initiative to care about the needs of the guests. Tell me what you need on WeChat and arrange it right away. It is very caring. This time I rushed for two nights. I will continue to experience it when I have time.

Our little butler brother is Curry, who looks a lot like Korean star Lee Min Ho, hahahaha! To tell the truth, the service is super caring, we want some ice cubes, send us a box! ! Let CURRY help us pick up the takeaway, pick up the kids, and deliver the mosquito repellent, basically at the speed of light! The dining in the restaurant and the reservation of the baby’s activities were all done for us. On the day of leaving, we asked us if we need to postpone the check-out time. . . I like Raffles, not only because of the quality of the hotel, but also because of the feeling of home, guests are respected, valued, and responsive! Unlike in other brand five-star hotels a few days ago, I went out in the morning and returned in the afternoon and the room was not cleaned. I sent a bath towel and waited for a long time! There is no harm if there is no comparison. In the future, I will think of Raffles and our housekeeper CURRY. I hope to see him again next year. Finally, I will mention their breakfast. The best breakfast in Hainan is here! Whether it is a child or an adult, it can be satisfied! That pancake fruit and cake pudding are so delicious that I want to cry. . .

msg:Pertinent evaluation, all the ratings of this hotel can be divided into two levels, polarization!
Facilities: The room facilities are very old. The shower sprinkled with cold and hot water. The smart toilet cover in the room was broken. 3 points, but the garden and building appearance was very a**ospheric and the design was well planned and very good. There should be people and few scenery. Very beautiful 5 points
Service: Room Butler Liu Weicheng's service is super good, responsive to all our questions. The restaurant service is also very good. The little brother with glasses is also very nice. The swimming pool service is also very good. Blanket water is available at any time. 5 points. Say okay to check in and check out. It’s not so slow. We waited in the lobby for half an hour but didn’t get it done.
Hygiene: except for the customer service when I went in on the first day, I felt that it was OK. After the cleaning was required, there was an obvious peculiar smell after cleaning! 2 minutes
Environment: Nothing to say 5 points

Another children’s entertainment room is charged for all individual items. A child’s sand paintings are 2 pieces of 98, and a ceramic painting of 98… Now many hotels are humanized. Children have special care services. Storytelling, handwork, and painting are all free experiences. This is not good 1 point!

msg:I heard a friend introduce the Raffles Hotel a long time ago. It is currently the hotel with the highest level of service that I have stayed in. There is no one. During my stay, the butler Curry Liu Weichen, the caring service throughout the whole process, I did not experience it in other five-star hotels. After that, I really need to be at home. The hotel is very large, and the guests are scattered and more open, so taking pictures is much smoother than other hotels. It is easy to find unmanned scenery. Many of them are families of three and bring children on vacation. The beach at Bialong Bay Hilton and Marriott’s are much more detailed. It is said to have been transported by air from islands like the Maldives. In general, the hotel is very private and the service is superb. In the future, Hainan will choose Raffles.

msg:The hotel recommended by my colleague happened to see that the family room on Ctrip could be upgraded to a suite, and the four major stays included four breakfasts. The price is very reasonable, and the cousin's family hit it off and started this Hainan tour. Although the location of the hotel is relatively remote, the feeling of being able to contract a piece of the sea is very nice. I contacted to ask about the check-in time the day before check-in. Prepare in advance and feel good. Check in early after arrival, Liu Weichen in the front hall will send us to the guest room, add WeChat, answer questions throughout the process, and make reservations for parent-child activities. I also experienced a Chinese restaurant, grouped a set meal, and added dishes after using the 200 yuan coupon. The price-performance ratio was good, and the taste was also recognized by my younger brother.

msg:I was a little worried after reading the reviews before I went. I was afraid that the bad room and service would affect my mood, but it turns out that all worries are unnecessary. When I was still living in Ritz, I received a call from the housekeeper Liu Weichen, asking me about my arrival time the next day and other requirements, and told me that the room was ready for the next day. The first impression was that the hotel should not look like something. The evaluation is so bad. After arriving at the store, everything went smoothly. The big balcony of the room faces the sea. Every morning, you can see a super beautiful sunrise. In the evening, you can see the moonlight on the sea. The sand on the beach is also very delicate. . Although some facilities are indeed not well maintained, it can be seen that the hotel is doing its best to remedy it. After three days of staying, the enthusiastic staff smiles everywhere in the hotel, and there are many staff in the breakfast room watching our meal. The experience is that when it is inconvenient to hold the soup bowl, there is a waiter next to it to help. It feels great. By the way, I also gave an afternoon tea set and dinner. I thought it might be just a look for free, but I didn’t expect that the cakes for afternoon tea were really made with heart, sweet but not greasy and beautiful in shape. Dinner is free The Southeast Asian set meal tastes ok, but the presentation is also with heart. I rarely write reviews, let alone write so many words. I hope my evaluation can give you some reference. I also hope that the Raffles brand will become better and better. Will choose next time I come to Sanya

During the stay, the butler Curry provided attentive service to help us solve various problems, like Doraemon’s treasure chest, making this day’s hotel trip smooth, comfortable and happy. The overall design of the hotel is full of sense, the service is high, the environment is excellent, and the pool room bus is very comfortable ~ next time you come to Sanya, I will choose Raffles Hotel! Thanks again to Curry butler, for your hard work!

msg:Choosing Raffles Hotel to stay in is the most correct decision I made after searching for Sanya brand hotels. I saw the evaluation that Yalong Bay Hotel is relatively old and Haitang Bay Hotel is not cost-effective. Finally, I saw that Raffles was very clean and in line with our standards. The beach is of good quality, the hotel is well maintained, and the greenery is great like living in a tropical botanical garden. The most surprising thing is that our housekeeper, front office, Li Zhou called before we checked in and asked if there is anything we need to prepare in advance in our room , I learned that we are two big and two small, and took the initiative to help us upgrade the family room. The room layout allows the children to open the door to enter the big surprise. I am very grateful to the enthusiastic Li Zhou. When checking out, my baby also took the initiative to ask me to come to Sanya next time. First choice for staying at Raffles Hotel ~ room type, service, greenery, staff’s due diligence and other aspects are very good, objectively speaking, the quality of breakfast needs to be improved, it looks exquisite, tastes average, I hope I can eat more next time. Delicious breakfast

msg:I have been to Hainan many times, and each time I am happy to experience a different hotel style. Raffles was the first hotel that made me stop trying and plan to return to travel. The warm reception and introduction by Xiao Lizhou from the front office, as well as the butler service, won my heart even more. In the face of my various trivial problems, he took the trouble to provide help and support, like a personal butler. The first time I stayed, I didn't pay much attention to the hardware of the hotel. Xiao Li's warmth completely touched me. The journey has such a sincere friend who is always thinking for himself, which adds a lot of beauty to the journey. And the lifeguards at the beach are also very friendly, helping with various problems and bringing us beautiful shells.

Thank you to the service staff of the Guest Relations Depar**ent for helping me arrange the room I noted. The room service is changed to new bedding every day, and the child’s favorite coconut milk is added. Turn down service in the evening.

msg:Staying at Raffles Hotel was recommended by a friend who works in a travel magazine. She has stayed in all major hotels in Sanya. Raffles Hotel is her must-stay hotel every time she comes to Sanya, with few people, beautiful environment and large rooms. Good service, summed up the advantages of Raffles simply and rudely! Because we don't like to run around, we chose Raffles for the four nights in Sanya. The moment we walked into the hotel, we left a good impression on Raffles. The private environment, the eyes full of tropical plants, and the sincerity His smile, meticulous service, and after washing away the exhaustion of the journey, Li Zhou from the front office provides a full range of butler services throughout the entire process. He has intimate greeting text messages every day, and everything is considered before the guests. The hotel's room is indeed big, and the most favorite is the oversized balcony. We stayed in a room with a full sea view. Every morning when we opened our eyes, we could see the sea, and at night there were stars in the sky. It felt really good! The special-shaped swimming pool is also responsible for its appearance. The whole swimming pool is very large and clean. It is surrounded by tropical plants. It is really enjoyable to play in such a swimming pool! A short and beautiful vacation was spent in the swimming pool every morning and walking on the beach in the evening. When I left, I still felt that I was not enough. Next time we will choose Raffles Hotel.

msg:The beach is very private and quiet. It is especially suitable for me who likes to read in a daze. It is also super close to walk past the room.
The hotel is surrounded by vegetation, you can't smell the fragrance of green grass and wood even on the road, the environment is amazing👍
The service is not to be chosen, especially the housekeeper Li Zhou in the front office. After check-in, he added WeChat and sent us to the room. Every time I have any questions during the stay, I reply quickly. Including consulting surfing and other activities, and also very active to help contact. In short, very caring!
The rooms are up to standard, spacious and separated from wet and dry. The disadvantage is that the light in the mirror is not suitable for makeup, and I was worried about painting my face too white; the hair dryer is not good, the hair blowing is slow, and the drying will be rough.
The afternoon tea provided by the hotel tasted average, and I gave up every bite; I felt that the overall breakfast was a bit greasy, the taste was ordinary, and the corn was super unpalatable; because of the afternoon tea and breakfast, I almost gave up the complimentary Southeast Asian dinner. I was too lazy to try it on the last day, it tasted great! Fortunately, did not give up! From the first soup to the last dessert, I like everything! However, the people at the table next to the table feel that the taste is too strong. Maybe they don't like curry. My husband and I like Thai food very much, so I think it's great!
In short, the whole is still very satisfied! My husband thinks that next time I go to Hainan, I will still consider living in Raffles.

Service: Thank you very much for the service of Mr. Li Zhou, the housekeeper. The service attitude and execution ability are superb. He has supported the entire Raffles service as a luxury hotel by himself. Thanks for his professional service attitude. great!
Transportation: It is located in Qingshui Bay, Lingshui, belonging to Yingzhou Town. There are shuttle buses between Phoenix Airport and the duty-free shop. You can make an appoin**ent one day in advance.
Food: The breakfast level of the hotel needs to be improved. It is especially recommended to get up in the morning and go to the Xincun Town Market to buy seafood and then go to the Xinshi Gourmet Seafood Processing Store to process it.

I played in the hotel without going anywhere for five days. During the day, I took my baby to play in the beach swimming pool and went back to the room to play games. Dining was also a solution to the hotel. At noon, the beach chairs by the pool had a QR code to order food. Of course, Meituan can also take out. There are not many take-out restaurants. It is also very convenient to order fruit drinks from the supermarket. Butler Li Zhou's service is very good, the service is very attentive, and the WeChat reply is very fast. On the last day we took our two children and it was an evening flight, Li Zhou helped to coordinate arrangements for check-out at four o'clock. My wife was attentive. I regret not having arranged for a few more days. The son said that he was too happy to go home. If the evaluation needs to be improved, the electric track of the curtain in the room is not so good, and one of the bathtub tiles in our room is cracked. In contrast, the children's playground is not so rich in activities for children, and the others are basically not big. Something wrong. In short, I think it is very suitable for families like us who don't like to go out and love to stay in hotels.

Li Zhou from the front office carefully prepared the adjacent room for us in advance, and upgraded it to a family suite of nearly 200 square meters. The family was particularly satisfied. The butler service for guest relations in the lobby is also extremely considerate and convenient. Especially recommended is the hotel’s spa, and there are special offers for the Dragon Boat Festival. This is a hotel that will definitely come back, looking forward to it.

The housekeeper Xiao Li has a very good attitude. My mother can't find the way to pick us up and show us the way time and time again. There is a sense of warmth at home. The sand on the beach is also very delicate. Although it was summer, it didn't feel so hot after raining in those two days. At the beach, the photographer simply took a dozen photos and spent a little money but was very happy. When I returned to my room, I encountered the burning clouds and it was so beautiful! The Chinese restaurant is a bit expensive but the taste is good. I ordered the bloody white chicken and so on. It was very good, and the food was full. I will go to Sanya next time. Thank you Raffles for giving me and my mother the wonderful memory of our first trip to Sanya.

最後總結，不管您是家庭出行，還是商務出行，選擇海南清水灣RAFFLES絕對是您最佳的選擇之一。
讓我們再次感謝酒店熱情周到專業細緻的服務。Darryl謝謝您的安排。

那周圍商場還算近，但是配套和乾淨度很差，比較吵雜。
如果去周邊玩我沒體驗，但是純度假躺在酒店基本酒店就可以滿足一切。
因為攜程預訂整體接待和管家服務都很到位，Mia小姐姐一直在關心。
再次感慨，未來來海南，基本選個好酒店就行了。
未來可以再來遛娃～

msg:萊福士作為雅高的頂奢酒店品牌我不可謂不期待但是這次體驗是失望的，酒店的初衷選址在陵水我想走的就是一個私密性的避世高奢酒店定位可是事與願違恰恰我覺得這是它最大的短板，私密性太差！現在成了網紅酒店，總有各種各樣的會議和團建在這裏，晚上在草坪搞活動唱歌跳舞弄到十一點，屋裡清清楚楚能聽到外面唱歌的聲音你説我們該怎麼休息？而且因為海灘互通每天早晨都有好多大爺大媽從海灘進來照相遛彎各種打卡，我請問私密感和高級感怎麼來？我們住宿客人的體驗感從哪來？我想這是違反酒店初衷的……還有就是小童娛樂中心每天的活動都是一成不變的，老師也不夠耐心缺少親和力而且我在這裏發現個問題就是員工有好多普通話非常不好，交流不順暢。最後説優點吧餐廳服務比較好很勤快讓我晚餐體驗感非常好，走的時候送給孩子一個小禮物。最後總結應該把重心放到客人身上，廣告打得響不如實際做得好

msg:每次來海南都是帶小朋友，需要準備的東西多，攻略説實話，隨便看看，但是我每次憑直覺的訂的酒店都非常棒——這次更是。萊佛士整體設計感不多説了，非常低調有態度，東南亞風的酒店很多，但是萊佛士多次被電影取景是有道理的。
此時不知道算不算淡季，加上酒店大，就顯得很清靜，我個人非常喜歡。

設施完備，親子活動很豐富，小朋友的娛樂屋略小，但五臟俱全，小朋友玩得不想走。

服務：無論是客房服務還是接送機都非常細心，幫我們打掃房間的小董和小蘇非常細緻耐心，房間收拾得很好，也注意到我們有小朋友，幫我們配備更多的水和小朋友的用品。
客房點餐很方便，我們大人每天吃兩餐，中午給小朋友單點的小童餐，粥啊，麪啊都很清淡，小朋友也愛吃。
總之，我們住了3晚，有點後悔訂少了，陵水之行到萊佛士是非常明智的選擇。

早餐的品種有點少，西餐佔比太多了，沒啥可吃的。

設施：泳池孩子們很喜歡，也挺乾淨，工作人員也很認真負責貼心，趕緊換了門口站那個禮賓*****不然真白瞎了你們這泳池帶來的好感了，另外房間燈光太暗了，抓蚊子都看不清，垃圾桶也有點少。

服務：管家還行遇到的問題都基本解決了，就是從一開始第一天我下訂單客服就開始出問題，先是查不到我的訂單，後來又查不到我套餐裏的接機服務，查到了要加錢補差價，真的搞人心態

總體酒店的恆温泳池和大泳池是真的不錯，雖然大泳池不算恆温但温度也是夠用的，希望下次再選擇這個酒店能有所改進不會後悔吧。

      平時很少給所住酒店評價，此次確實遺憾沒能多住幾天，期待下次

msg:第一次入住清水灣萊佛士酒店，要給酒店的軟硬件都點100個贊。從管家姚曉霖接到我們開始，
親切周到的服務就一直伴隨我們整個入住期間。從推薦我們周邊可以吃喝玩樂的地方，到關心
晚上房間是否安靜，無微不至。這在人滿為患的春節假期之間尤為難得。硬件就更不用説了，
整個酒店佔地面積極大，東南亞的風情，才200多間房，每個房間很大，所以非常安靜，即使住
滿了客人，在草地和花園裡也感受不到嘈雜。雖然萊佛士攜程上顯示裝修時間比較早，但是她們
去年才翻新過。而且我住的露營房是新裝修的房型，硬件更是沒有問題的。最後一定要誇一下
清水灣這個“會唱歌的沙灘”，果然水清沙幼，非常適合小朋友玩水玩沙。晚上的沙灘燒烤有時間
的話也一定要嘗試，味道非常不錯。

我們選擇了泳池套房，但Darryl卻給我們帶來了意想不到的驚喜——他為我們準備了大黃鴨水上氣墊！這種特別的安排讓我們感到格外驚喜和愉悦，讓整個度假體驗更加豐富多彩。

在我們抵達之前，Darryl就通過電話與我們取得聯繫，詳細詢問我們的需求，並提供了周到的建議。當我們抵達酒店時，他親自迎接了我們，並詳細介紹了酒店的各項設施和服務，讓我們感到賓至如歸。

在整個度假期間，無論是解決我們的住宿問題，還是提供周邊旅遊建議，Darryl都能夠迅速響應並給予幫助。他那熱情洋溢的笑容和周到細緻的服務讓我們感受到了家的温暖，讓這次度假體驗變得更加難忘和愉悦。

感謝Darryl為我們帶來的愉快體驗，讓我們在清水灣萊福士酒店度過了一段美好難忘的時光。

訂這個酒店前，小紅書和攜程刷遍，看了很多關於萊佛士的差評，説是服務一般、房間收拾不乾淨之類的。但我還是在雙十一時候就訂了他們四晚。過年放假來度假，從大年初五晚上就開始不加價，不到3000元住兩晚，還給升級了海景房，試問過年期間三亞陵水哪家五星級酒店可以做到？而且服務跟得上，我們的管家是Diana，人美心善，細緻周到。定時詢問何時打掃房間衞生，很乾凈。所以我感覺萊佛士管理層應該是看了網上評價，在不斷改進，而且改進的非常不錯。mini吧免費，歡迎椰子蜜瓜免費，公區所有設施免費，早餐直接幹到11點，以上這些，沒幾個海南酒店能比的。本人發表這個評價後，還會繼續住兩天，還未入住的、想入住的，歡迎詢問。

第一天我和寶貝起的晚，九點多餐廳確實排隊，
以後八點多去大概1/3都沒坐滿。
酒店設備確實沒那麼新，
但酒店不就是這樣麼，
經常裝修沒有味兒麼[汗顏R]
總之，全家四個人都很滿意。
預訂時候看到一些差評，還有點猶豫，
現在覺得真的很好呀。
酒店有點大，服務人員並不會每個點位都有，
但遇到的所有人都超級熱情，
一定會送你到明確能找到的位置。

正好週末小朋友慶生，強烈要求回萊佛士過。依舊是一次很棒的入住體驗。

首先表揚一下管家部，姚曉霖經理：
主動提前聯繫，升級房型、迎來送往，時時溝通。在得知小朋友生日後，更是貼心的各種禮物和妥當安排。
着實，讓人有賓至如歸的感覺。

另外酒店合作的這個鉑爵旅拍，拍攝水平超出預想。本來衹是選套餐，額外記錄一下美好瞬間。結果出片率太高了，越買越多…

説了這麼多不足的地方，也要好好誇獎一下萊佛士的管家，kiki小姐在我們入住的時候盡心盡力的安排我們儘快入住，不嫌麻煩的幫我們找快遞送到房間，還很體貼的送我們去寶寶樂園，最後洗衣服來不及還幫我們加急等等，很感動有這樣的好管家，讓我還是會想來再住。有這樣的管家，即使客人不什麼不愉快也會煙消雲散了吧。祝萊佛士和kiki小姐都越來越好～

這次計劃的看海+生日趴
毅然決然來住萊佛士
你永遠是我記憶裏的樣子
所以再見的落差不是沒有的

1.在路上遇到的員工是不會打招呼的
（感覺都是實習生 沙灘自助餐的年輕員工也懵懵的）
2.房間是又潮又有黴味兒的
（ps：這個季節不要住泳池房！不是恆温很冷的！而且水臟臟的！有蚊子！可以給蚊香但沒有花露水）
3.禮賓是不負責叫車的
（雖然用軟件打車很方便 我甚至以為除了港澳的酒店其他的應該都沒有這項服務 但後面住的JW萬豪人家可以幫忙叫車哦）
4.“低調的奢華”
（房間價格是挺奢華的 之前訂成2000多到店的時候已經3600了 價格與體驗感毫不匹配 歡迎水果就兩個椰子 巧克力開夜床送的但難吃 生日送的巧克力蛋糕好吃 不過吃完自助回來根本吃不下笑死 小冰箱裏的飲料是免費的衹有這點令人滿意了）

還有管家服務是令人滿意的
衹住了一天
但Mia幫我預訂餐廳收取外賣很仔細
態度很好
讓我不至於對萊佛士太失望
聽説是換業主了
怪不得low了不少
自己努力吧

msg:首先肯定酒店還是非常不錯的，特別是之後換到亞龍灣的酒店後，對比一下子出來了，亞龍灣的衹能叫五星酒店，萊佛士能看出以前的風采。
首日入住的時候，有點晚了，大概19點左右，正好大堂就一個人，其他人吃飯去了。我是用套餐入住，之前也聯繫過酒店，入住的時候酒店給升級了海景房，非常不錯，但對於套餐裏含的接送機等其他權益都未提及，雖然我一個也不需要，但道理不是這麼説的，後來管家也沒説起，感覺還是要問一問動一動。
衞生：酒店到處都非常乾淨，值得稱讚。
設施：不可避免的老了，雖然看得出保養的很好，但確實老了，尤其是餐廳的桌子椅子。
餐飲：早餐中規中矩吧，不出彩，跟亞龍灣的五星比較起來還是勝出的。入住過程中體驗了酒店的泰國餐廳，味道還行吧，居然沒收服務費，甚至還提醒可以註冊會員打折，這點非常不錯。亞龍灣的萬豪，居然還收15%的服務費，真讓人。。。。
位置：鳳凰機場出來，自駕1小時，路是比較好開的。
沙灘：會唱歌的沙灘名不虛傳，對比亞龍灣的好的不要不要，如果衹為帶孩子來挖沙，建議就清水灣吧，其他別去了，清水灣相當於lv，其他相當於coach。
服務：除了開頭寫的入住感受外，管家基本在線，也有問必答，整個酒店的工作人員服務上確實還是亞龍灣的希爾頓好，感覺很多小細節還可以再提升，但點讚的是沙灘上管理酒店躺椅的小哥，非常認真負責，確保酒店客人能使用躺椅。
親子：因為孩子比較小，所以有沙灘就夠了！足夠了，但活動相對比較少。
總結：除了沙灘，硬件軟件都還有提升的空間。

msg:本次在萊佛士的入住體驗很好。從一開始，管家Ena的提前聯繫和細緻入微的服務就為旅程增添了不少色彩。Ena的周到照顧值得特別表揚，從始至終都體現了酒店對客人體驗的高度重視。
房間方面，升級入住了一間寬敞的海景套房。房間的面積足夠大，設施配備齊全且現代。套房擁有一個非常大的陽台，從這裏可以享受到令人難忘的海景。晚上在陽台上吹海風、觀賞夜景，感受到了無與倫比的舒適與寧靜。
酒店的沙灘質量同樣出色，儘管海浪有些偏大，但整體體驗依然令人滿意。餐食方面，酒店提供了多樣化的選擇，食物質量上乘。值得一提的是，酒店還設有專門的親子項目，這對於帶小孩的家庭來説是一個巨大的加分項。家裡孩子對此讚不絕口，為家庭旅行增添了更多歡樂。
唯一的遺憾是這次沒有機會體驗沙灘BBQ。但這也成為了我們下次再次選擇萊佛士酒店的一個期待。這次的住宿體驗讓全家人都非常滿意，下次有空會再來。

服務：管家Ena Wang 很用心，陪同辦理入住，也有提前提醒天氣。全程管家服務很好，帶五個月小寶入住，很照顧寶寶。

環境：酒店環境很好，海灘也很乾凈，套餐裏有旅拍，拍照很好看。

設施：嬰兒入住有提供床圍欄和嬰兒床，嬰兒床如果新一點就更完美啦。其他設施整體還不錯，中規中矩。

這次遇見的管家小姐姐真的很nice。因為我們是帶着孩子和孩子阿姨出遊，所以是3個大人一個崽。管家小姐姐給升級了房間，房間專門有區域，可以給孩子做輔食（因為做輔食一展開就是特別大一個攤兒），而且超大的陽台，孩子也能跑來跑去，這對有小寶寶的家庭真的友好，住的很舒服也很方便，入住後還送了崽一個娃娃，崽也很喜歡。
我們一共入住了4個晚上，有什麼酒店相關問題或者其他生活周邊的問題，管家也會給我們細心的解答，確實要認真感謝和誇獎一下我們的管家曉霖同學，真的很負責，很熱情。
總體來説是一個以後還會來的酒店，之前是兩口子來，現在是帶着一家子來，在酒店關注的點不一樣，但酒店都能滿足，其實是收穫不同的快樂，但是感覺都很好。

msg:親子出行
先説優點：環境清幽安靜，服務熱情，遇見的工作人員都會微笑示意。衞生很好，因為帶小孩子所以我很注意這方面。童趣樂園很小很小，但也有親子活動，娃編了椰子葉的小魚很開心，工作姐姐還送了他椰子葉編的寶劍。飲食方面這次酒店的餐廳都有嘗試，中餐廳味道很不錯，堂食和客房送餐都有嘗試，比較順口味，心暢吧的鹵肉飯小孩子也比較愛吃。有管家服務，我們的管家姚曉霖非常盡心，幾次問題都響應的很及時也很用心。
説到此就要説下酒店的缺點了，設施老舊，此行一共住四晚，免費升級了套房，入住當天工程部在維修門鎖，當時沒覺得有什麼問題，然後就是晚上回房發現客衞的水箱一直上水，工程部的又來看説是水箱上次用水用的多了所以需要時間長，嗯我想説我們就沒有用這個馬桶好吧，但當時比較晚了，娃也要睡了，趕緊修完結束。前兩晚都還不錯，第三晚開始門鈴在晚7點多響，我以為是我叫的餐到了，開門卻不見人，樓道也沒人，於是我請客房看下監控是怎麼回事，答覆這個時間段沒人按門鈴…這個心情誰能懂，真的很不安，於是工程部又來人了，查看完説是門鈴壞了，換了個新門鈴，好，當天就這樣過了。新的門鈴在第4天上午的時候又發生了沒人按鈴自己響的情況，幸好是白天，這時酒店提出要給我換房，但我還一晚就退房了也不想折騰了，最後是酒店做出了賠償一晚房券作為補償，相對補償，其實我更需要酒店有個解釋，為什麼會發生這種情況，酒店的態度也是很誠懇了，説是這間房確實沒有發生過這類情況且最近這間房都是有入住的並不是空置房，在我們退房後也會徹底檢查並且完好後再出售這間房給客户，我覺得解決的態度還是誠懇的，且在退房後兩天收到管家的微信説工程部檢查出來就是線路老化短路的問題。不管怎麼樣，我也算知道理由算安心了，不然真的會覺得自己的“運氣”那麼好的嗎。哦對還有就是在我頭退房的那兩天卧室這邊的馬桶抽水也出問題了，我感覺真的是這個設施有些老舊了，室內的燈光也很暗，沒有主燈可以理解，但整個套房的燈光都是暗暗的，和威鉑斯、富力海洋世界凱悦這類的親子酒店比起來，真的就很昏暗的感覺，可能更適合情侶出行吧。

msg:在清水灣萊佛士酒店入住了三天兩晚，印象最深的是酒店的房間風景和管家服務了，説到管家服務我就不得不提到我的管家Diana從入住接待到退房，可以説是所有事情都親力親為，入住期間的所有大小事宜都是她負責處理，看到我們有帶小朋友還特別準備了小朋友的帳篷🏕️佈置可謂是非常的心細温柔，小朋友的所有所需用品都幫我們安排的非常到位，到店的第一天因為小朋友想吃下午茶也是Diana幫我們去做的協調，最後在長樂吧度過了一個非常美好的下午茶時光，在此也感謝一下長樂吧的Ricco經理，如果沒有二位的安排這個事情應該是沒有如此的順利，今天退房還是非常的不捨，已經跟Diana説好了，下次回來一定提前聯繫她，到時候多住幾天！來海南一定要到萊佛士酒店體驗！

服務：這次海南一共住了三個酒店，可以説萊佛士的服務是最好的，管家Diana小姐姐服務特別周到，從第一天抵達就在門口接待我們，引領去房間，介紹酒店，一切出行找管家總能安排上，靠譜！
萊佛士無論是夫妻情侶二人世界出遊還是親子家庭出遊，基本都能滿足，下次來海南就選來陵水，來就住萊佛士！

攜程在協調問題上真是非常照顧會員的感受，特別給力，以後還會繼續在攜程訂酒店。
酒店服務員Coco熱情實在，幫忙解決了好多棘手的小問題，幫忙取葯，準備冰塊，有求必應，真的是管家服務，而不是衹有管家一個稱呼。
經理kate處理問題也果斷實在，很有擔當，幫了我不少忙，節約了我很多時間。一個男經理，給送了果盤和椰子，感謝！
兩位司機師傅（山東楊師傅和鄭州師傅）都很專業，特別棒！
酒店的沙灘燒烤海景很美，食材特別新鮮，尤其小龍蝦肉質很鮮嫩，伴唱男歌手簡直天籟之音，好想知道他的**號。
以後如果再來陵水，我還會選萊佛士。

裝修的風格
環境：
酒店有自己的沙灘、泳池、花園，整體來講像極了峇里島，特別是花園內的感覺。
設施：
酒店的設施建議升級一下，無論是電視、網絡還是其他硬件，跟其他酒店相比都略顯遜色。衞浴產品也沒有之前獨立裝的好用了，建議酒店降本增效的同時還是要多考慮客户體驗。

分享下入住體驗，酒店佔地很大，設計滿滿的熱帶雨林感，還有兩個泳池（如圖），真的隨手一拍都是大片，完全比消失的她電影中更好看，酒店分為別墅區和普通房型，空餘時間都可以去散散步，還有spa可以做，很重要的一點是，酒店私密性很強，不是那種親子酒店，亂糟糟的哪哪兒都是人，還吵的不行，聽管家説每個月都會有明星過來入住。其實來度假就是休閑來了，放空自己離開忙碌的工作，主打清閑，三亞我覺得入住選在這種大一點的酒店，所有的需求都滿足了，沙灘🏖️美景放鬆，不需要度個假還要奔波勞累去每一個地方，其實海都差不多，這邊的沙灘是酒店自己的沙灘，之所以叫清水灣是因為這邊的水特別清澈，晚上還遇到有人在這邊辦婚禮，真是後悔沒有早知道這個酒店。總體來説很舒服的體驗。

酒店環境非常非常美麗，畢竟是作為電影取景地的酒店哈哈 沙灘是比較私密的一片領域，對比了海棠灣的沙子和海來看，還是清水灣的比較適合放鬆躺平。酒店提供各項收費活動，比如沖浪什麼的。還會為小朋友提供挖沙子的小工具，特別可愛哈哈。合作的旅拍是鉑爵旅拍 拍攝效果也非常好！美中不足的就是餐太貴啦…

住店的三天，私人管家小胡無微不至的問候，從玩轉酒店的攻略到酒店外的活動安排，從房間各種設施的介紹到離店前的各種關心，衹要有問題向她諮詢，她都隨時隨地的認真回覆，加上酒店原本的硬件，讓入住萊佛士的體驗昇華！
住了海南很多酒店，從三亞到萬寧，從文昌到瓊海，萊佛士可以算排進前三的好酒店！不管是不是因為電影去打卡，都值得入住！

msg:陵水太好玩了！！我們改簽了機票，又續住一晚酒店，真的太喜歡了。第1次來陵水，對比了很多同類酒店，最終選擇清水灣的萊福士，一共入住三天，説説感受。

老牌五星酒店，管家服務，入住的頭一天，酒店工作人員打電話。加了管家Rita的微，辦理入住非常快，在酒店有任何問題都可以跟管家溝通，感覺她都是秒回。萊福士是環保性酒店，一次性洗漱用品給的數量不多。直接微管家所需產品，客房部很快送到。礦泉水也是無限量的。

酒店接駁車對長者太友好了，我們跟禮賓部的帥哥説，能否帶長者轉一圈，他們非常樂意，還把酒店每一處景點都給介紹到，老小每天都去錦鯉池餵魚。

清水灣是白沙灘，早上可以到沙灘看日出，自由燈塔非常美，我們住峇里島翼，可以步行前往，很近。遇到沙灘吧枱小樑，他服務很周到，浴巾和礦泉水可以隨便領取。

早餐種類較多，屬於海南五星酒店基礎水平，我吃的簡單，我媽和孩子覺得很好。一大早就吃冰激淋的小朋友可美了。

如果説些缺點，可能就是剛進屋的時候有一點潮味，這可能跟酒店的使用年限和離海邊較近有關。這點我們也跟管家反映了，她説如果有需要可以安排除濕機，長者和孩子覺得都還好，就沒有麻煩他們。總之這是一家不錯的酒店，全家人都很喜歡。下次來陵水還會考慮在他家住幾晚。

設施：酒店開業很久了，保持還算不錯，我們住的家庭房，裏面的小童沙發床不大，睡成人有點小，1.4的孩子差不多，1.6+就要睡對角了，也能睡，就是略小。房間的佈置很可愛，小老虎帳篷，長頸鹿，枱燈也是卡通設計，小孩子應該很喜歡。吹風機是戴森的，這點很滿意。送了兩個椰青，首輪飲料免費，不過飲料種類不多，沒有之前香格里拉送的多。酒店有室外恆温泳池，不過不算大。
服務：入住前有打電話確認需求，管家kiki也有一直跟進服務，下午酒店還有電話調研，特別表揚泳池邊租水槍的帥哥，看到我兒子忘記戴泳鏡，主動免費借給我們，很暖心。看得出來，萊佛士對於如何提升服務還是很用心的。但是入住時看到有客人對入住效率很不滿意，酒店的服務還是有進步空間。
環境和活動：酒店的環境有幾個地方確實很美，比如天空之門，酒店整體的活動不算豐富有特色，可以參考萬寧的艾美酒店，活動很多，且獨具特色，採摘椰子槳板沖浪，客人沒有不滿意的。海灘確實很軟，但是可能時間久了，清潔度方面再提高點就好了。
餐飲：早餐不錯，品種挺多，家人都很滿意。我們選擇坐在室外，後面的新春佈置很應景。
總體來説，是陵水酒店裡最好的，如果想在陵水住，這裏應該是最好的選擇了。萊佛士的服務也在水準，在硬件和活動的特色方面，再提升下就更好了，期待酒店更大的進步。

服務：特別感謝接待人員Ena的熱情服務，從入住前一天就開始在網上交流，入住之後對我們有求必應，態度很好，感到十分滿意👍

總體來説，這裏適合過來慢悠悠度假。

msg:酒店維護的很好，沒有聞到黴味，蚊蟲也不多，整體的環境很不錯，管家式服務，入住前一天就接到酒店的電話，加了管家Darryl小王的微信，Darryl態度好，訊息回覆及時，還給小朋友送了早餐，非常感謝，酒店出門就是沙灘，沙子是非常細膩的白沙，晚上六點鐘沙灘邊有自助晚餐，有歌手唱歌，有篝火，氛圍感很棒，菜品也很好，味道不錯，很浪漫

msg:住了兩晚都沒走出酒店，海灘自助、沖浪、游泳，非常適合擺爛的酒店～
對於大家吐槽的早餐排隊，其實酒店已經提示：7:00-9:00去用餐是不必排隊的，9:00-10:00客流量大，需要排隊。但也沒等多久，很快就進去了。
另外，此處特別感謝管家Darryl～訊息秒回，幫忙換房間，非常負責！

msg:服務很好，有管家全程服務，有需求響應很快，水喝完了立馬讓人送了六瓶過來，還給小孩子鋪了沙發床，很大很舒服。去了酒店中餐廳，菜品很適合我們的口味，價格相對於東榕美食城貴一點，不過畢竟在酒店，不用跑出去。順便説一下，酒店真的很大，從房間走到大堂要很久。全海景房景觀對於一個度假類型的酒店來説很棒。

msg:東南亞風味酒店，打開陽台就療望大海，心情非常愉悦，讓人心情更好的是遇到了管家Lyndi，一到酒店就在等我們，辦理入住手續空隙時間把我們安排到休息廳吃點心和水果，看到我們有長者還幫我們另加了床，非常的貼心，不管多晚，有求必應，非常的負責任，這次海南待了6天是我遇到過最有責任和人情味的管家，下次來陵水還住這家酒店，還要找Lyndi安排！

msg:管家王一囡Ena非常熱情，有問題都非常盡心盡力給我們解決，很滿意。酒店的沙灘非常細軟，海邊也有個沖浪店，下次來一定要去玩一下。早餐在高峯時期會稍微等待一下，但整個過程井然有序。客房部，有需要時，也會非常快的拿來所需要的東西。酒店很大也很出片。父母很喜歡，表示下次還會再來。

msg:這次出遊主要帶孩子玩，定了泳池房，還未到達酒店之前管家Diana就已經主動聯繫，告知我們房間已經整理好了就等我們到店辦理入住，同時詢問我們孩子的年齡提前準備好小童洗浴用品。酒店管家服務非常好，幾乎隨時在線替賓客解決問題，每天都會告知當天的天氣狀況，有如家人般的關心。最後一晚開夜床時還給孩子送來了小驚喜禮物，太貼心了❤。感謝Diana和工作人員給我們帶來了非常完美的假期體驗。
還有沙灘🏖️自助，氛圍感太棒了！

msg:前年來過一次清水灣也是住的萊福士，感覺挺不錯，所以這次又選擇了這裏。原本覺得它挺好就是有點舊，但是這次來住，感覺比以前新了很多，不知道是不是有翻新，而且房間裏和陽台上的布藝沙發、地毯什麼的都很乾凈，看來是花了不少心思做清理，一點不像是開業了那麼多年的酒店。酒店的各種配備設施很到位很貼心，還專門有管家服務，不得不讚一下我們的管家darryl，無論我們有什麼需求都立刻有迴應並極力幫我們達成，讓我們這次的度假感覺非常舒心。另外還要贊一下那條掛滿了各式燈籠的長廊，太美了！
