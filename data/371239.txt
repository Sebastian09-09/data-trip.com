msg:Facilities: The hotel is located on the edge of Shennan Avenue in Futian District. It has been open for quite some time since 2009. The king size rooms have been newly renovated, while the other rooms are relatively old. It is not recommended for those who like the new hotel to choose. The facilities and equipment are not perfect. This time, they were woken up due to sound insulation issues, and the hotel has already received treatment results.
Hygiene: Apart from the heavy equipment, the hygiene is done quite well, and the cleaning is also done in a timely manner.
Environment: The lobby is decorated in a luxurious style, and the restaurant and room environment are both decent.
Service: We attach great importance to the guest's check-in experience. Stella at the front desk calls in advance to inquire about the arrival time and room requirements, arranges rooms according to her preferences, and promptly handles and provides feedback on any issues after check-in. Whether it's front desk reception or room service, every employee is enthusiastic and friendly, always treating people with a smile and warm words. This makes us feel at home and leaves a deep impression. The hotel still needs improvement, and the service is full marks!

There are quite a lot of Chinese restaurants near the cocopark hotel recommended by helen, and the taste is quite good. The room is clean. I will come again when I have the chance.

They called us in advance to arrange the room, and the coordination of various departments of the hotel was very good. The design of the hotel is very stylish! There are many kinds of breakfast, and the taste is quite good. I don't regret choosing JW Marriott Jinmao. I can not only taste delicious food, but also enjoy the scenery outside. The service is thoughtful in all aspects. If you need a friend to stay in a hotel in the future, I will definitely recommend it.

The night buffet at hotel's restaurant it is a must try (japanese, chinesa and western food, with drink included). The hotel has the best staff I faced in China. Mr. Roman at front desk, was fast, solved all our doubts and was super helpfull. Mr Forest also. Help us with luggage, taxi and courier. We will comeback for sure!!!

msg:[Hotel Address]: Exit J1, Chegongmiao Subway Station, Futian District, Shenzhen~
[Decoration Style]: A very European style luxurious decoration that leaves people lingering.
[Room Type/Layout]: The room types are very comprehensive, ranging from standard rooms to presidential suites!
[Transportation Strategy]: Located in Chegong Temple, Futian District, Shenzhen, with convenient transportation, it is situated in the Futian CBD~
[check-in method]: Please check in anytime with valid documents~
[Play Project]: His restaurant is very recommended and must be experienced
[Restaurant Features]: The restaurant is divided into Western and Chinese cuisine. Personally, I suggest that their Chinese cuisine must be experienced once. From taste to service, to price, it is truly indescribable and wonderful. If you don't come and try Chinese cuisine once, it means you have missed one project~
[Surrounding attractions]: Located in the Futian Chegongmiao CBD, there are many office buildings nearby. As soon as you come, you can feel the fast-paced and bustling atmosphere of Greater Shenzhen. Stella has helped us a lot and given me more time to experience!

After 1 hour of troubleshooting, the IT service of the hotel was still unable to resolve the issue. The reception could only tell us that they will liason with the vendor before coming back to us. After three calls, the issues were stiĺl unresolved. This is quite disappointing as we were unable to reply to messages sent to us. The next day, the reception did not come back to us, we went to the reception as we were still not connected to Internet through the hotel's WiFi. We were able to receive messages through the shopping centre's free WiFi that we visited. We did not expect this as JW Marriott is such a established hotel. What came as another disappointment is the food that were served at level 27 floor. We did not expect this standard of food from JW Marriott.

The room I was given looked nothing like the pictures in the advertisement so I requested and was given another room.  Please know that if you book an Executive Room you may be looking directly into what looks like an abandoned building or an aging building with very few tenants. While waiting for my friend to arrive, I tried to turn on the TV but the remote didn’t work.  When I called down to the front desk the phone wasn’t answered so I had to go back to the front desk again.  They said they would send someone up which they did.  She was lovely but she didn’t know how to solve the problem knew so she called a second person in.  A gentleman came to the room and couldn’t fix it and was just standing in my room.  As it was almost 9 pm, I asked him to leave and asked if it could be fixed in the morning.  He agreed. No one ever showed up.  Lastly, we did have the buffet lunch and the service was excellent. All in all, a mixed experience.

When we knew that Shenzhen would be lock down the next day, he patiently sought transportation solutions for us. Moreover, he helped us take the luggages to the room and fully introduced the facilities and services of the room. Many thanks to Gavin, especially when he takes care of my mother. This is the true hospitality, everything is great.

Epidemic prevention measures of the hotel are well done, free covid-19 testing services are provided. Breakfast is pretty great, affected by the epidemic, can only enjoy it in the room. Everything is very comfortable.

msg:It was my first time staying at JW Marriott Shenzhen. I chose an executive king room. The executive room type is also the one that best reflects the highest standard of hotel service. From the overall environment to the facilities and services of the executive room type, as well as the experience in the executive lounge, everything was perfect. Even if there were some minor problems during the stay, the service staff was very proactive and quickly solved the problem. It was like being at home! Thank you to the hotel staff for their attentive and considerate service throughout the whole process. I will choose Jinmao Marriott again next time!

In the morning, there was no room for us to check in, and the young man immediately notified the cleaning staff to tidy up a room and arranged to wait in the executive bar. Several other five-star hotels including Park Hyatt (2600 per night), Shangri-La (1300 per night), Mandarin (3000 per night), and Westin (900 per night) just mechanically replied that they had to wait until three o'clock in the afternoon. I plan to stay in this hotel when I go to Shenzhen in the future, and I will also hold meetings here. The Chinese restaurant here tastes good. I highly recommend this hotel!

The air conditioner in the room I stayed in was broken and did not cool, which made me so hot that I could not rest well. I had already reported this problem to the staff when they cleaned the room in the morning, but no one came to deal with it until two o'clock in the afternoon. This efficiency was really speechless. After two o'clock, I went to the front desk again, but the front desk staff not only did not show the slightest apology, but also chewed something in their mouths, which almost fell out. This was really unprofessional and unprofessional! However, it is worth mentioning that the service attitude of the guy who took me to see the new room and helped me with my luggage was very good, and I must give him five stars, but this cannot cover up the huge problems in the overall service of the hotel. I hope the hotel can pay attention to these problems and improve them as soon as possible, so as not to let other guests have such unpleasant experiences again.

When I walked in, I felt the Marriott's extraordinary reception lobby and courteous service. Thanks to the housekeeper Stella for her careful arrangement, we upgraded the room to an open-plan twin suite and arranged a sumptuous breakfast for us. Cafe Chinois, the buffet restaurant on the second floor, has good food and a relatively concentrated variety. It is served from 6:30 to 10 o'clock. I had a wonderful time chatting with my mother while eating breakfast slowly. The accommodation experience in the room was good, it was hygienic and clean, there was plenty of sunlight, the mattress and pillows were moderately soft and comfortable, and I couldn't bear to check out. I am very satisfied with this accommodation and dining experience. It puts aside the worries of busy and trivial daily charging. I will visit again if I have the opportunity~￼￼￼

Helen from the guest relations called us in advance to confirm the arrival time, and helped us upgrade the room. She also told us in advance that it would rain heavily in Shenzhen in the next few days, so we should be prepared. Thank you so much. His service is really great, and he is very good at chatting. Hhh, if you go, you can ask him to arrange the room hhh, which prevented us from becoming a drowned chicken. After arriving at the store, the hotel as a whole feels very retro, which is understandable. After all, it is also an old hotel. The room feels pretty good at first, very comfortable, not very big, but not small. It's a pity that I couldn't check in on the fourth floor. It looks pretty good. Turn left and you'll reach the subway station in 5.6 minutes. There are really a lot of food nearby, which makes it difficult for me, a big foodie, to choose.

The buffet breakfast is rich, and there are waiters who will show you seats, so you don't have to worry about finding a seat while getting delicious food. Although there is a delivery robot at the front desk, the takeout you order can only be placed in the takeout cabinet at the entrance of the hotel and you can go downstairs and pick it up yourself.

msg:I came to this hotel during the Qingming Festival. Stella and the services of various depar**ents were very good. It was a pleasant stay. I remembered the poem: Swallows come at the New Festival, and pear blossoms fall after Qingming. There are three or four green mosses on the pond, and one or two orioles sing under the leaves. The day is long and the catkins are light.
The neighbor girl smiled cleverly and met me on the mulberry path. I wondered why I had a good dream last night, but it turned out that I won the grass fight today. Smiles come from both faces💪 The service is very good

msg:A family of three booked a deluxe twin room for three days and two nights on Trip from April 3 to April 5. The experience during the stay is worth sharing.
After passing the Futian Port, take the subway to Chegongmiao Station (first take Line 4 to the Convention and Exhibition Station, and then transfer to Line 1. The signs are clear for those of us who are not familiar with Shenzhen). Go out of the station and walk 800 meters to the J1 exit. When we arrived at the hotel, there were already high-rated restaurants in the places we passed, which was quite convenient.
The look and feel of checking in at the front desk is consistent with that of a 5-star hotel. When the front desk saw a customer waiting at the back, he immediately assigned staff to other counters to handle the matter. After registering, the hotel took the initiative to arrange an upgraded room as it was the first time for us to visit, and then Stella, who was responsible for the accommodation butler service this time, took the initiative to receive us. After arriving at the guest room on the 15th floor with Stella, she first let us visit the room. After ensuring that we were satisfied, she invited me to add her WeChat ID. (Please remember to add it. The butler service will be very considerate in the future)
After settling in, we received a welcome message from Stella, who took the initiative to arrange late check-out and free buffet breakfast for us (save a fortune, the buffet breakfast was over a hundred per person, and we made over a thousand in two days), and explained any problems. Also available to help. (I thought it was a polite comment, but in the next two days I really answered all my questions.)
This time, we mainly avoided the crowds passing through the border during the Qingming Festival, so we arrived a day early, hoping to stay at the hotel to rest and hang out nearby. In addition, we tried the popular "**
”, this butler service really enhanced the enjoyment.
On the first day, I ordered popular restaurants and cake shops without having to go out to queue. When "**" arrived, she told Stella and the front desk arranged for a robot to deliver it to the room (one of the orders was shortbread, Stella wanted to avoid breaking it) , and even delivered it to the room personally). I didn’t have much in mind for dinner, so I casually asked Stella for any recommendations. After she asked what we probably wanted to eat, she sent us some suggested restaurants. (Helpful for people who are "yes but")
The convenience on the first day strengthened our interest in booking "**". We booked one meal at four different restaurants, and Stella and the front desk colleagues also delivered it to our room one by one. 🤭
On the last day, I asked Stella if she had any cafe recommendations, and she even offered us Datai coffee coupons to try, but she gave up in the end because she wanted to go out to "check out the cards."
In summary, if you are thinking of staying with friends for food and entertainment, you can really give this hotel butler service a try. ￼👍

The hotel does have traces of age, but the facilities are well maintained and the hygiene is OK. The upgraded third space room has a good view. It would be better if there were chairs, so that you can drink tea and enjoy the view at the same time, otherwise you can only stand. The executive lounge on the 27th floor is good and quiet, suitable for daydreaming and talking. I will choose it again next time I come to Shenzhen.

I happened to be here with my family and told them some of my needs. They helped me solve it easily. The key point is that I also took a personal training class at the gym. I didn’t expect that you can also buy only one private training class. I commend the team at the gym. They are one of the few gyms I go to that have such good service and the staff are so enthusiastic. I still go. It was nice to have a drink in the lobby bar. The location of the hotel is also very good. There is a subway station next to the Chegong Temple. Although we came by taxi, the location is great. The hotel's facilities and equipment are indeed old. I heard their employees said they have been renovated. It should be a partial renovation. If you like new hotels, don't consider this place. If you focus on service, you can consider it. The hygiene of the room is also acceptable. There are a few minor issues and it is acceptable. It is clean and the lady is also very enthusiastic.

Jinmao Marriott was renovated in 2020, so the in-room facilities are very new, clean and hygienic. At this price, it is really cost-effective. About 100 meters next to the exit downstairs is the Chegongmiao subway station, and it's also very close to Futian Port by taxi.

Marriott's breakfast is also very rich, but maybe because of the weekend, there are so many diners that the restaurant service staff is a bit busy, so some things can't be kept up with. But the noodle soup made on site is very delicious.

Service: Lynn was perfect. She introduced the hotel to me when I checked in and followed up on my stay experience. Her attitude was friendly and professional, which was great!

The design of the shower and washbasin is also poor, and the bathtub is not wrapped in disposable plastic. Check-in at the front desk is also extremely slow.
There was a lot of noise next door at 1:30 in the middle of the night. I could hear the voices clearly. I didn’t know whether it was because I was unlucky to stay in this hotel or because the quality of the neighbor next door was poor. I called the front desk to ask if they could change my room. After changing my room for a long time, there was no reply.
I have stayed in so many star-rated hotels. This is the first time I feel the star-rated prices and fast quality. It has only been 4 years since the renovation in 2020. There are unknown odors and aging facilities.

It was already 11 o'clock when we arrived at night, and it took more than 20 minutes to go through the formalities at the front desk. I hope that the room can be arranged closer to my colleagues. The girl who checked in said that the room can be arranged closer, so we can only arrange it on the 5th floor. I I asked him if it would be noisy, and she promised that it wouldn't be noisy. But when I went up to look at it, I found that the rooms were not close at all. They were on both sides of the corridor, and my room felt weird as soon as I entered it. Eerie and terrifying.

Called the front desk to change rooms. Said let's wait. Waited until after 12 o'clock. I was moved to another two adjacent rooms on the 5th floor. Since there are two adjacent rooms, why didn't you arrange them for us before?
When changing rooms, I asked again if it was noisy. The waiter said it was not noisy. The waiter walked in front of us the whole time and did not help us get anything. Then I changed to this room. The roar of the machine all night made it impossible to sleep. The facilities in the room are old and not as good as a business express hotel. The towels are torn. I stayed in a standard room and the quilt on the other bed was on it. Shockingly, there is an unidentified body hair.

I don't believe that the hotel staff didn't know that this room was very noisy and that it was impossible to sleep. The key is that I asked this question many times. This is essentially the same as cheating money.

On the second day, I called to explain the reason and asked to change rooms. I changed to the same room upstairs and there was no noise. They also said they would give me executive benefits and hoped that I would not write a bad review. In fact, the price of the room we booked was only 50 yuan different from the executive room. Yuan. I didn’t book an executive room at that time because I didn’t think it was necessary.

I often travel for work and this is the worst hotel of its kind I have ever stayed in!

Even if it’s bad, no matter what he gives me, I will let more people see it to avoid stepping into the trap.

In fact, the second day was my birthday, and the hotel called me and asked me to give me a birthday cake, but I didn’t ask for it because I didn’t expect it when they looked like this! If you do, it will probably be another annoying experience!

A very, very, very annoying hotel!
The worst place I have ever lived in in the past 30 years, bar none!

The door dinged so loudly in the middle of the night! Didn't sleep well at all! I had to disconnect the data cable for more than half an hour and no one bothered to bother me! ! I'm really speechless for a hotel with more than 1,000 yuan. The management may not be at work. The employees are generally very casual...

msg:I’m really angry~embarrassed, insulted, angry~

Check-in on New Year's Day~

￼What happened is like this, the housekeeper on the executive floor can freely decide to tap the card, enter the room, and touch the guest's body at any time! I was sleeping at the time and had no clothes on. If you enter a room and see a guest sleeping, you should exit the room immediately instead of patting the guest awake. Of course, he will knock on the door? I didn't even hear the doorbell knocking (you can also explain why you don't have the anti-theft chain on) because my husband went to the fitness room to do some exercise. ￼If I had installed the anti-theft chain at that time, my husband would not be able to enter the room.

Solution from the hotel manager: It seems that I have no money, so they refunded one night's room fee to the left and refunded one night's room fee to the right. Is it a lot to refund one night's room fee? Do you know the total price for an executive room in your hotel for 4 and 3 days? If I pay you for a room, can you touch it for me? It’s really annoying...

I'm really scared. Maybe you think refunding money is the solution, but to me it's the biggest insult!

Because Qiu Wei never thought that a stranger would touch my body. What if it happened to you? can you accept it!

The hotel manager may feel that there is really no problem with same-sex body touching. The manager on duty said to watch the video, Auntie Ya enters the room for 1 minute. I also told him that a lot of things can be done in one minute, and TV commercials only last for tens of seconds!

Their Cantonese-speaking male employees shielded each other's colleagues and would not tell the truth to the manager on duty. After that, I hung up the phone and immediately went to the lobby to explain the incident in detail. Only then did the manager on duty know what happened! I also knew that my Mandarin was not very good, so I asked the male employee to translate, but he didn’t get to the point. I was really confused and helpless after what happened!

Yesterday I wanted to check out immediately, but there were no vacancies in another hotel I booked!
I spent the last night without a good sleep in a very scared mood.

The hotel wants me to stay again and upgrade the room (of course I have to pay). I don't have the courage to pay or not. Please don't make any arrangements if you check in again...

My family and I paid the money this time and received the greatest lesson and New Year gift. It was an unforgettable and profound experience!

It is also the biggest lesson and humiliation for me🥹!

Executive Lounge: The staff did not smile, and so did the teacher, who seemed to owe him money. There is very little food, and if there is none, it will be replenished immediately! Insufficient hygiene⋯⋯

How can you see that as a 5-star hotel, it is Class A!
Customers pay to be happy, why should they embarrass me?

If you show warmth to your guests, they will definitely feel it!

After staying here for a few days, my family and I really learned a lesson. After working hard for a year, the hotel gave me the greatest pressure. Paying money and not getting the service you want~

Do you really understand special emphasis?

The content of what I said may be too uncultured, I hope the hotel will also understand my current mood...

The hotel service is as good as Marriott's as always. Fiona from the guest service team contacted me before traveling and prepared fruit. On the day of check-in, we arrived early and the room had not been cleaned yet. Another supervisor in the front office (forgot to ask his name) thoughtfully took us to the executive floor restaurant on the 27th floor to rest and prepared fruit drinks for us, which he also enthusiastically gave us later. Come to the room card and thank her very much. The hotel breakfast is also pretty good. In short, the hotel is still worth recommending and I will choose to stay here next time.

msg:I originally booked a twin room, but after I arrived I spent money to upgrade to a suite. The first time I entered room 2501, there was a strong smell. I moved to room 2201. The room had air conditioning as if it had no air conditioning. I would sweat when I sat down. After calling the front desk to communicate, , he said that the air-conditioning was not working and I could change rooms, but they were about the same, so I forgot about it. In the meantime, I ordered flowers, left my room number and name, and sent them to the concierge. The concierge told me that there was no such guest, so the flowers would just be dropped. At the concierge, when I take a shower at night, the bathroom is separated from dry and wet areas, but water leaks from the shower room to the bathroom. The water and the reflection on the floor cannot be seen and almost slip. Moreover, the refrigerator in the mini bar is broken and cannot be used. Finally, I didn’t expect the makeup sponge to be used to clean wounds, which will shed hair. After this experience, I am very disappointed with Marriott. I can only say that the service at the front desk is very good, and everything else is a hardware problem.

The food there is good in variety and quality. The 200 spa coupons that were sent were originally only applicable to the whole body trea**ent, and they were all more than 1,000, so it was useless. The sauna and warm water pool are a bit lacking in maintenance. There is something floating in the warm water pool. I don’t know how to operate the sauna and I can’t find anyone to ask. It seems that many people are getting married or on vacation these days, so staff are hard to find and super busy. In the end, the sauna room was finally activated, but the inside seemed a little dirty, there was a little rustling on the seat, and guests from the wedding banquet next to it broke in to find the toilet. Fortunately, they were wearing swimsuits, but it was also a bit embarrassing. There is a cold water shower next to it, but it can't be turned on at all, and so are the lights. Booked two rooms, the bathroom is connected to the toilet, the glue edge of the bathroom is not very tight, if the shower is too big, the water will flow into the toilet next to it. The room is clean, but still feel the traces of the years. There is a JBL speaker but it can't connect at all. It may be more convenient to ask someone to help when there are not so many people.

First of all, the room layout is very unreasonable! The TV is for display, right? It doesn't look good sitting on the sofa either. It doesn't look good on the bed either.
Secondly, except for paper towels in the bathroom, there are no toilet paper on the bedside or desk in the room! Does that mean you have to run to the toilet every time?
Is the restaurant where the last breakfast was held a party for a group of foreigners? It was noisy early in the morning, and I reported it to the restaurant manager many times, but to no avail!
The room view is also very bad! To be precise, there is no scenery at all, and there is nothing to eat or do around!
Does this hotel deserve a 4.8 rating? ? ?
Whoever lives in it suffers!
As soon as we checked into the hotel, the front desk asked us to check out and give it a five-star rating. I just hehehehehe

Later, I asked to change to a high-rise room. As soon as I entered, it smelled like cigarette smoke, and the room type was actually worse than the low-rise room I stayed in at the beginning. But the main thing is that the service attitude really needs to be improved.

The steak in the buffet is delicious. Although there are not many types of food, it is very good at this price👍🏻

What can be praised most is that the water flow is particularly strong and the hot water is very hot, so you can take a hot bath comfortably.
The bedding is quite comfortable, relatively smooth and skin-friendly. But the degree of light transmission of the curtains basically makes it impossible to sleep late.
In terms of public transportation, Chegongmiao Subway Station is a giant station, but the J1 exit happens to be the farthest... but it is in the middle, and it is relatively close to everywhere by taxi.

The swimming pool and gym are outsourced to external companies. The service standards are completely different from other five-star hotels. This is the best I have ever stayed in in China. JW Marriott has the worst service outside, very disappointed!

The check-in at the front desk is also fast, and I gave the children 🧒 small gifts 🎁 when they checked in before New Year's Eve.
There is a Ferris wheel in the Snoopy-themed room 🎡afternoon tea☕️, the children 🧒like it very much💕very happy🥳.
Some of Snoopy's things in the room can be taken away, and the children 🧒 like it very much💕.
The only downside is that the breakfast 🥣 is relatively lacking, but other aspects are good.

You can see Shennan Avenue, Ping An Financial Center and the golf course. It can be said that it is the best view room in the hotel. Yes, it is also worth mentioning the excellent service of the staff. Cecilia Lenn Klee of the guest service team is worthy of praise. She was greeted from the time of check-in to check-out, and she was really considerate.

The facilities and equipment are quite novel. It’s better to sit in a small space in the afternoon while drinking tea and reading a book. Cozy, the point is to upgrade for free, really comfortable.

I wanted to turn on the air conditioner, but it turned out that the air conditioner was also broken. The facilities were relatively old. I asked the front desk to change the room because it was really too smelly, so I changed it. After entering a room, the food was full of stinky food. I thought I was too embarrassed to change it. I turned on the air conditioner for nearly two hours before the smell subsided. I asked the receptionist to bring a knife to the room the next morning. I called twice from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and it wasn't delivered until after 11 a.m. Impressed. The overall experience is not very good

The overall feeling is that we have greatly improved our enjoyment at Jinmao JW Marriott this time!

Hygiene: Visible hygiene, all are cleaned spotlessly

Environment: Like all JW Marriotts, the environment is spacious and the layout is suitable for family & business, not exaggerated, just right

The details are not perfect: he will not take the initiative to send the luggage; the front desk will not pick up the luggage, and he will walk to the concierge by himself. Before leaving, he will say to you "Please give me a five-star review!"
It's not the quality that JW Marriott should have. I booked for four nights and checked out two days early. I won't come back.

There is an open-air bar on the fourth floor. The music is still loud and clear until after one or two in the morning, which affects the rest. The overall facilities of the room are relatively old, not like it has just been renovated. There are many kinds of breakfast, and the taste is also good. The overall price/performance ratio is ok. If you want to have a good rest, please ask the front desk for a high floor or a room that does not face the bar on the floor.

There are several yellow pillars in the lobby, which is the core of the hotel. I heard that it was a feature of the hotel before. Now after the renovation, I personally think the renovation is very successful. The location of the hotel is very convenient, in the city center of Shenzhen, very convenient, very close to the subway entrance. The service attitude of the staff is very good. The front desk manager Han Hong is especially good. Although the construction noise opposite the hotel is a small flaw in this stay, Han Hong's professional and enthusiastic attitude makes me feel that it is worth giving a 5-point praise

msg:During the epidemic, there were only a few hotels in Shenzhen that received 48-hour nucleic acid guests from Futian. I finally found this JW Marriott. It was the first time I stayed, and I was disappointed!

I thought it would be better if it was renovated, but I didn't expect it to be worse than a homestay. Mainly due to equipment failure, mosquitoes and spiders in multiple rooms, unreasonable layout, etc.:

1. I was lined up in a corner room. It is said that the room was upgraded for me. I thought it would be 50 square meters, but it turned out to be so narrow that there was not even a sofa. Even if it is narrow, the TV cabinet can lean against the wall for 30cm without leaning against the wall, and the bathtub can lean against the wall for 20cm without leaning against the wall. It's obviously very narrow, so why waste space?

2. There is no trash can in the wash basin. This is the standard configuration of all hotels. There is no such thing, which is outrageous!

3. There is a problem with the air-conditioning system in the room. When I returned to Nantian, the air-conditioning could not be adjusted down, and it was very stuffy. Adjusting 18 degrees always shows 27 degrees. During the period, the engineering depar**ent came to adjust it once and said that it was adjusted in the background, but it did not improve much. It was very hot when the quilt was covered.

4. There are mosquitoes! The buzzing sound has been flying in my ears, flying all night, no need to sleep. The next day I changed rooms and found mosquitoes in the bathroom;

5. Changed a room the next day, when I came in, there were spiders on the bed (see picture)

6. The hand shower is faulty, water is sprayed on the side (see picture), and the ceiling shower will drip water. When taking a bath, the hand shower is hot water, but the ceiling keeps dripping cold water;

7. The light control fails, many lights are turned on, but they cannot be turned off when they are pressed again, and they must be turned off by pressing the main switch;

8. Avaya's phone has too many functions, right? It feels like it is for office use. I have never seen any hotel use it in China. It is estimated that older guests will not use it. There is also this old-fashioned TV, I don't know how to not replace it;

9. Check in at 6 o'clock in the evening, and give me welcome fruit at 9 o'clock in the evening;

10. The breakfast offerings are unbearable.

msg:The online class at home was crazy, so I simply stopped the class for two days. I went to the Rose Coast in Yantian District during the day, and I normally buy tickets for nucleic acid 24 hours. There is no one else, and the whole sea is ours. Yantian District can't accept all Futian people, even in the safe area, so when we return to Futian at night, only our hotel in Futian does not dislike Futian people. Regarding nucleic acid, the hotel can do free nucleic acid in the parking lot from 10-10:30 in the morning, which is very convenient.
During this period of time, it is very strange. I especially yearn for the outdoors. Even if I get in the car, I feel at ease. When choosing a room, I need a bathtub by the window to see the outside world. Therefore, JW Marriott on Shennan Avenue is very suitable, and there are many apar**ent types that can meet the requirements.
Cathy at the front desk is beautiful and kind. Seeing that I was bringing my baby, he helped us upgrade the room type. I was worried that I was not satisfied with the landscape of the upgraded room type, so he specially arranged for a colleague to show me another set. However, the room type that Cathy helped us choose was good. It is located in the center of Futian. The area is quite large and comfortable. Thank you. Although the lounge is not open, you get a drink coupon on the second floor, which can be used from 12:00 noon to 9:00 pm. It’s a pity that only the bar has mung bean soup. I heard from friends that Wan Wan’s mung bean soup is delicious, and I will never forget it in my life.
There is a fly in the oin**ent, but the hotel's consideration is also right. Because of food safety, the hotel guests need to go down and get takeaways by themselves. It was so edible that I ran three times in one night. Takeaways come very quickly, after all, there is Chegong Temple next to it, and there are a lot of delicious food.
When I was leaving, I met Cathy again. She really likes children. She told her to call in advance next time and help her arrange it ^_^

msg:This is the first time I stayed at the JW Marriott Hotel Shenzhen. The location of the hotel is very convenient, located in the Chegong Temple area of Futian District. The overall environment of the hotel is quite good, the rooms are well-equipped, and the breakfast in the western restaurant on the second floor of the hotel is excellent. Epidemic prevention and hygiene are well done. The service of the hotel staff is very good, warm and thoughtful. The room layout is good, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows reveal the dim night view of Futian CBD. Before I came, I accidentally received a call from Serena, the hotel guest service. After learning that I was going to propose at the hotel, I asked my needs over and over again, saying that I could find them anywhere I needed help. I was fortunate to have their help. I am more confident in my proposal. Thank you to the Guest Loyalty Team for their perfection, and a big thank you to Serena and Mel who worked overtime after work to help me pop the balloon and make it more perfect. I would also like to thank Lori, the duty manager, for his superb photography skills, for recording one of the most important moments in my life. The most important marriage proposal ceremony in my life was completed at the JW Marriott Hotel Shenzhen. The meticulous arrangement and considerate service of the hotel staff left us fond memories, and my girlfriend was very satisfied. A real luxury hotel is not only about its beautiful appearance, but also its sincere service is the soul of the hotel. Praise for JW Marriott Hotel Shenzhen Jinmao, Marriott is blessed to have a professional service team like you. I believe that you will get better and better and prosper day by day, so that more customers will feel your ultimate service.

The location of the hotel is very good. The executive room has a comfortable view of Shennan Avenue.
In a hotel of the same price, the toiletries are thick and the hot water is supplied quickly.
Although during the epidemic period, the breakfast arrangement was very appropriate. Special personnel brought them into the seat to order the set meal, and took the initiative to ask whether the refills were added at appropriate time intervals.

In short, the standards are well maintained and the business philosophy is in place.

msg:This is the worst, oldest, dirtiest and shabbiest Marriott I have ever stayed in. The staff are extremely unprofessional. They even charged me breakfast when I wanted to check out. The room smelled of cigarette smoke and the corridor was shabby and dark. It was gloomy, the room was also dirty, the glass was covered with dirt, and the air conditioner was broken and not cool. The workers came to repair it and just adjusted the air outlet for me, but it didn't solve the problem. The efficiency of the front desk is extremely low. There is always a queue at any time. The room service is also very slow starting from 15 minutes. The employees are not neatly dressed and have no training. They don't speak like a hotel at all. Although there are many kinds of breakfast, each one is unpalatable. It is very expensive to book a hotel in advance, but it is cheaper to book on the day. This hotel is not worth the price. It costs 300 a night.

msg:This is a perfect little trip for parent-child experience. I spent an unforgettable happy time with my family. We are residents of Shenzhen. Due to the epidemic, we try to minimize outings, so choosing a hotel suitable for vacation in the local area is a very good thing. Jinmao Marriott is located in the central area of Shenzhen, in the green and environmentally friendly Futian District. Although the hotel has been established for a long time, it was renovated and optimized in 2020 last year, giving us a deep experience of our stay, both in terms of hardware facilities and quality of service. All are trustworthy and praised. We spent a pleasant weekend here. In our spare time, we can also feel the strong business a**osphere. This is an unforgettable and valuable travel experience.
Special thanks to Ms. Cici Lv Lingjuan, because when I checked in at the front desk, this beautiful girl greeted us and made us feel warm and friendly. It did not feel strange and uncomfortable because of the first check-in. Instead, it made us stay here. Get a sense of security and belonging in the shortest time. Thank you to every service person in the hotel. They are like angels of love. They provide us with meticulous care and care. For example, the sisters who carefully decorate the rooms, Ms. Bella in the Chinese restaurant provide us with food introduction and recommendation, and the Western restaurant. Mr. Haron provided us with warm service and help, and Ms. Wendy from the administrative corridor sent lovely hand letters and books to the children. All in all, I would like to thank the Marriott team for their service and management. See you next time and we will definitely come back again.

msg:First of all, I would like to thank the enthusiastic beauty Mango at the front desk. If it weren't for her help, breakfast would have been deducted by several extremely incompetent and irresponsible breakfast waiters on duty. I often have to wait for more than a month and may not even get it back! The room originally included breakfast, but when I checked out, I found that another meal fee was deducted! The front desk asked the restaurant, and the answer was that I swiped the room card and signed a bill, so two bills were deducted, but I didn't sign at all, so who signed it? No need to think about it, it was the extremely incompetent waiters on duty for breakfast on August 6! They threw the bill without even checking the system, and signed on behalf of the guests. They are so bold that it's not too much to catch them! In addition, the breakfast dishes are extremely bad, and it is basically impossible to find food with meat. They also charge money randomly, which really ruins Marriott's brand image! Please also ask the HR of this hotel not to recruit some ** service personnel who can't use the system, throw bills randomly, overcharge guests, and pretend to sign for guests!

I helped arrange the rooms in advance. I was worried that I would not be able to catch the plane too early to have breakfast. I made a special call and WeChat to remind me and suggested that I book a breakfast box. I have stayed in many hotels. I rarely encounter such a good service. I am very satisfied.

msg:First of all, I would like to praise Ms. Mango at the front desk. Her attitude is very good. The process was quick and she helped me upgrade the room type. One point was deducted for the service because I was asked to show the green code at the door when I went back to the hotel at night. I thought it was very good. But at this time, I didn’t ask me to show the room card. I thought it was the hotel that would remember the guests. But I was called by the staff at the door to do visitor registration. This was the first time I encountered this in a star hotel. The gym equipment is relatively complete, the layout is reasonable, there are also Pilates beds that can be used, and it is open 24 hours. The hotel room has good views and soundproofing.

Although the hotel does not look very grand, it is amazed when you enter the lobby. The design has a strong sense of design and the space is well used. The design of a few large lamp posts feels very calm and comfortable. The wheat at the front desk, hospitable and friendly, upgrade the room to send breakfast. The room is clean and tidy, with a little aroma. The gym is available 24 hours a day, and the equipment is complete and spacious enough. There are charging plugs everywhere in the room, which is very convenient. If you want to stay in a luxury hotel with good value for money, this Jinmao Shenzhen JW Marriott is indeed a very good choice.

(A little can't remember sorry) also introduced me to upgrade the package, just as I needed a quiet environment to work, so I chose to upgrade the executive room, the service of the executive lounge is also very welcoming, Max recommended me a good location by the window, detailed introduction to the executive lounge, Let me also see the city view of Shenzhen after work. The happy time in the lounge is quite pleasant to me. The Korean bibimbap made by Miss Sister is very delicious 👍🏻 Thank you Suki and Calina. The cocktail made by the two sisters made me very relaxed after work. Yuki who helped me check out cares about my stay experience. I think it is still very good overall. I will consider staying again on my next business trip.

msg:The hotel is too old and the facilities are outdated. It may have been five stars in the past but now it is only four stars at most. The so-called king bed suite is nonsense and does not match the name. This is too outrageous. Sitting on two chairs feels like a hotel. Only I dare to call a room a suite🥶, but the service attitude of Marriott Hotel staff is really good👍. Ctrip’s service attitude is also trustworthy in solving problems. I hope Ctrip will implement it in place before cooperating with the hotel. No matter how good the service attitude is, it can only be done by not conflicting It was just intensified again, but after all it caused us actual losses and harm!

When I asked him any questions, he was very impatient. After checking in, the data line for telephone consultation was also the same. He hung up the phone before I finished speaking, as if I owed him millions! I wonder if such a person can also be a star service staff? Haven't been trained?

msg:The location is good and the service is also very good, which can solve the needs of the guests in a timely manner. Unfortunately, the facilities are a bit old and there is no electric toilet. The executive double bed room I stayed in was very strange. As soon as I entered the door, it was the bed. It felt awkward, the privacy was not enough, and the sound insulation would be poor. There is a large pillar behind the bathtub in the bathroom, and then there is a small aisle to walk to the floor-to-ceiling window behind the pillar. I can't understand what is the use of such a design.

環境：完完全全對得起這個價格，內飾真的太讚了，當我推門進去那一刻，我真的感覺一天的疲憊都沒了！有一種家的感覺。由於我到店比較晚，所以我備註直接開夜床，進門就睡覺。開門的那一刻我感覺真的好温馨。

設施：酒店是很新的，好像開業還不到五年。居然還不要取電卡，刷卡進門之後燈就是自動打開的，省去了插卡的麻煩。畢竟誰想一開門看到的是黑漆漆的房間呢？

衞生：沒話講，非常之乾淨。

退房當天，深圳特大暴雨，Doris小姐考慮到我的不方便，特地為我申請到下午四點退房，真是非常感謝，讓我在温暖的酒店裡躲了一會雨。
Stella小姐在為我辦理退房的時候，主動為我遞上一杯冰拿鐵，並歡迎我下次再來（説下次我再來他們家，為我免費升個房），哈哈哈也是期待住了。

期待下次相遇！

房間很舒適，這區晚上很寧靜，只是房間燈掣太光，有點不太習慣，房月間全黑睡覺會更舒適啊。

酒店送了早餐給我們，很驚喜呢。
早餐豐富，中西餐款式真的很多，也很好吃。即做的食物也有很多選擇。

整體酒店服務也很好，感覺也很安全。
有機會會再來啊～

但是扣分點有二：1.入住期間叫了盒馬，因為超過3公里，沒有準確的收貨時間範圍，當時不方便下樓，想讓禮賓部幫忙代收一下，並會在十分鐘之內到樓下取。外賣員説酒店不能代收，衹能讓外賣員等一下。2.有酒店工作人員説要五星好評，我説我會實事求是的評價。那位工作人員説不是五星好評就是差評。不理解了，原來這酒店那麼高的評價原來是刷出來的？
仁者見仁，我相信入住的每位旅客都有自己客觀的評價。

辦理入住和退房都很方便，房間乾淨整潔，床和枕頭都非常舒服。
早餐的品種很豐富，尤其是麪包，品類在五星級酒店中也屬於比較多的。看到正餐有廣式茶點放題，看上去很誘人，可惜是早上航班沒有試到。

電話AI管家系統：很方便，能解決基本的問題，像是安排空氣淨化器、回答餐廳服務時間等等。
行政酒廊：於房間安排好之前免費安排上到27樓使用，有提供簡單水果、餅乾、堅果、咖啡和茶。環境還OK。
早餐：選擇非常豐盛，中西式都有，口味正常不錯吃。
賓客關係專員Stella的服務很到位，值得讚賞！有什麼問題找他都很及時地回應並且幫忙解決，非常為入住體驗加分！👍🏼

酒店大厅的落地窗真是太爱了，俯瞰深南大道的高楼大厦
房间景观：
景色宜人,酒店的风格设计也比较时尚．
酒店有下午茶也有晚餐，spa，足不出户，可以全面享受
每，拍照也是很出片•

但美中不足的是我在晚上叫room service 的時候，送餐的小哥態度很不耐煩，還有酒店wifi沒自帶vpn，希望改進

性價比：感覺還是有點小貴，不過公司給報銷也就沒什麼感覺了，房間是一方面，主要還有其他配套，這個價格還可以。賓客關係主管kaka won入住特別問我了的需求，給我介紹早餐。
早餐在二樓，早餐種類很多，夠吃啦。
健身房：沒時間去，一樓大廳的大堂吧特別贊，很文藝，又不缺失現代化的感覺，差旅人士不忙可以好好休息下，忙的話其實也沒時間去啦。

第三，身着工作制服的員工，並不是人人見到客人都回應出應有的問候。可能是後勤人員。那也代表這JW！

最滿意的是四樓的泳池，雖然小一些，估計也就二十米，水深衹有0.9-1.2?大概吧，但水質很好，沒什麼漂白粉味道，超過了我住過的90%的五星級酒店游泳池。估計是兩個原因，一是水池淺水量小，所以能按規定換水，不至於衹上葯消毒能不換水不換水的其它酒店。二是早上太陽爆嗮，有利於殺毒，人也不多，不需要狠用消毒葯。

房間設施：
挺新的 雖然是翻新後但是完全沒有不好用的設施
床：
無昇味 整個房間都沒有昇味 乾淨整潔清爽
房間景觀：
因為我們有個小寶寶 前台就給了間安靜的房間，憂鬱晚上寶寶睡著了賓客關係主管kaka won 還一直陪伴
到客梯門口幫忙按電梯內並且告訴客房會多送幾瓶水方便我給寶寶奶粉，點贊kaka 。位置交通：很方便 周國很有煙火氣咖啡廳 小吃店 餐館特別多。服務：為什麼我説這次體驗非常好呢 因為全程kaka 有求必應，比如第二天早上我們出去吃早餐帶寶寶一起逛逛到門口，剛好遇到kaka 還提醒會下兩給我們酒店的傘，但是後來雨太大寶寶和我們都淋兩了，要晚退房1小時並且不要按門鈴放門口。這些都第一時間打贏並且執行了。打掃的阿姨每次走廊遇見都很真心的打招呼。整個酒店酒館裏很到位！規範！住了這麼多年萬豪 這家管理和執行真的很好！非常滿意。

分享我在深圳最愛的酒店，一家名字准五星酒店
位置在深南大道，隔壁就是車公廟，大部分必吃榜也在酒店周邊，出門就是地鐵站。
房間設施蠻好的，不能說很新，但是也不會太老舊，該有的都有。
性价比：
性價比的話我個人覺得很高了，也是五星嘛，而且設施也比同星級的好。
服务：
賓客關係主管kaka won总会主动咨询我的需求，急我所急，离店后忘记拿洗面奶了还帮我快递了我的la mer 洗面奶，绝对好评！！！
