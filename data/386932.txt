msg:The worst experience of my life .. extremely noisy, you cannot sleep later than 7:00 am because there will be noises of their workers and Chinese people talking loudly in the corridor, no one is available to communicate in English. The staff on the front desk, gives wrong information. The deposit that you pay at the time of check in, make a lot of deductions by miscommunication. 

My experience: I booked the package that included two breakfast. I asked their duty manager ( the only lady that front desk officer asked me to communicate since they assume, she can talk in English) . I asked her if I can have the breakfast in my room and will that be covered by the package I bought? And with full confidence, she said : yes , it’s ok . At the time of check out, they deducted a lot of money from my deposit and when I asked , they said the payment of breakfast had been deducted that was provided to your room. Although, I clearly mentioned that your duty manager told me that it will be included in my package, they totally denied by saying that do you have any proof ? Well, I am a regular traveler and that’s my concern that why don’t they record the calls ? I suggest all the foreigners to never ever stay in that hotel .

msg:I love this hotel, but most importantly the staff. They were warm, welcoming, kind and so so helpful! Always going above and beyond with utmost professionalism and kindness. 
Example: we found a sick stray dog and the staff huddle together and helped us find a vet close by and ensured we had a way to get there and even offered to translate after we had left. They gave me a number to contact if we needed any help. This type of service I have never experienced before and this is only but one example. Excellent experience.

Also - Breakfast amazing, amenities clean and classy. Pool area gorgeous and spacious and all necessities available. Room clean, fancy, amazing view, just wow!

I will definitely stay here again and again!

However, the hotel's soundproofing needs to be improved, and occasional noise from outside can be heard, especially at night. In addition, the parking space is limited, and parking spaces may need to be reserved in advance.

Overall, this is a recommended hotel, especially for travelers who want to travel conveniently in the city center. I hope that there will be improvements in soundproofing and parking issues in the future.

Although the hotel is a bit old, the decoration style is still quite old, and it is still full of retro and old money. People who like it still like it. The bathtub in the room this time is very cute, and the toilet is really a bit old. If conditions permit, it is better to upgrade it step by step.

Hygiene: The overall cleanliness is very good, even the lights are bright~ It is recommended to put some alcohol cotton pads on the toilet for more peace of mind.

I contacted Coral Jennifer from the guest relations team in advance to discuss the birthday decoration and arrangements. They also prepared for me as soon as possible! They confirmed the arrival time with me and upgraded the room. The decoration of the room is super beautiful, the roses are beautiful, and the cake is delicious. Thank you Coral and Jennifer for your hard work. I was very surprised and touched by this arrangement! Cassia in the lounge provided meticulous service!

msg:Two adults and one child checked in, but there were no children's slippers. They said they could only give one pair. The room was dirty, the carpet was not clean, and there was a bad smell as soon as you entered the door. The staff was indifferent and the quality of the front desk staff was also very low. The staff of Sheraton hotels in other cities would greet guests enthusiastically when they met, but this felt very special. We came back to sleep at night and called the front desk, only to find that the phone was not dirty at all, and you could pick out dirty things. The overall environment was very old, and the carpet had not been cleaned seriously for a long time, and there was a bad smell. I asked for a pair of slippers for an hour, and I called the front desk and they said there was only one aunt on duty at night. For a hotel that costs more than one thousand yuan a night, with such service attitude and service methods, as well as an old and smelly environment, where is the value?

The hotel is a distance from the subway. Although it is all downhill, if you carry a large box, it is recommended to take a taxi. The walking navigation will make you walk a long and steep staircase.

msg:I originally booked 3 nights, but found out that I couldn’t stay on the first night, so I immediately canceled the remaining 2 nights.

Stay at 2 hotels in Chongqing
One is the Sheraton, chosen because of its outstanding appearance and the fact that it is a five-star hotel under the Marriott Group.

The hotel is located on the Nan'an River, and the interior European theme looks pretty good.
However, the hotel is in an old state and has many problems:
1. The air conditioning cannot be turned on in the room. The hotel thought the weather was not too hot so they turned off the central air conditioning. However, the room was made hot and humid, which was very uncomfortable!
Later, a fan was provided. It was unimaginable to blow a fan in a five-star hotel!

2. The refrigerator does not freeze at all, but emits heat. It is useless for the staff to adjust it. It must be broken.

3. The water in the shower is very poor, and your feet are still soaked in water after taking a shower.

4. The curtains in the shower area are quite transparent, and you can look directly at the lights of the building opposite, which makes you feel insecure.

5. There is a smell in the toilet. Even going to the toilet feels sinful.

All in all, very disappointing

When we checked in, they upgraded us to an executive super deluxe king-sized bed room for free. The room was large and well-equipped, and the bedding was very comfortable. Parents and The children were very satisfied and strongly requested to stay one more night, so they extended their stay in the original room haha😃
We live on the 45th floor, which is almost at the top of the tower. We can also see a little river view from the side and the golden Twin Towers. The decoration style of the room is also golden. The main theme is luxury. Young people may not like it, but the elderly say they like it very much, haha.
The hotel is on the South Bank. It’s nice to walk along the riverside at night and see the night view.

The family felt it was worth it and left us with many beautiful memories. The room facilities are well maintained and remain new for a long time. You can imagine how much inves**ent was made in the construction and decoration of the hotel. The location of the hotel is very good, right on the riverside. During the Spring Festival, there is also a lively riverside market where you can make tea by the fire or eat various snacks. It’s so relaxing to bask in the sun and drink tea. The only thing the hotel didn't do well was the buffet. It had few varieties and wasn't tasty, but the service staff were very enthusiastic. So work hard to produce something that is worthy of this good hotel and the Sheraton brand.

Unsatisfactory points:
1. The restaurant on the second floor is very cold! I can't stand it without a coat!
2. The breakfast is basically the same. I stayed for 4 days. The noodles were topped with tomatoes, eggs, pickled vegetables, and mixed sauces every day. In addition, the temperature was very low, so the food got cold very quickly!
3. The service at the front desk is also hard to describe!
4. The room facilities are relatively old, and the faucets are still the old British style with separate faucets for hot and cold water. It is more laborious, and the water makes the countertops very wet!
5. The hotel network is very poor!
In short, it's enough to stay once! The impression of Sheraton is really greatly reduced!

The two high-rise buildings rise from the ground and shine with golden light, making them look particularly luxurious.

🤵🏻♂️The concierge of the hotel enthusiastically led him to the front desk. Entering the hotel lobby, you can see that the overall ceiling is very high and very grand. Check-in is at the front desk of the hotel and the lounge is not open for check-in. This is a real feeling. Slightly worse.

When the staff led them to the room, they could see that the decoration was very magnificent. After entering the room, the European-style decoration with Chinese embellishments came into view again, which was very elegant.

🏠The room is a corner room. It is a large open space with sufficient area. The view is very good. You can see a great river view. The lighting is also very good. The maintenance of the room is average. The hygiene is passable. The bedding is not that great except for the mattress. Comfortable, there is a grille at the entrance, and the minibar is also set up at the entrance. Through the grille, what you see in front of you is a full floor-to-ceiling window with a river view and a European-style large bed, and there is also a full floor-to-ceiling window on the other side of the room. I can already I can imagine the feeling of lying in bed and looking at the river view. There is a fireplace on the right hand side of the room, which is very warm. On the other side of the bed is an area with classical European sofas, desks, and dressing tables. The room is brightly lit and also You can adjust it according to your needs.

Then push the door and enter the bathroom. The double doors are very ceremonial. The bathroom also has a bathtub placed next to a floor-to-ceiling window. The lighting is also great. The lighting in the bathroom is suitable and not dim. The whole bathroom looks very elegant and not old.

☀️The lighting in the lounge on the 36th floor is also great. The sun shines in and is very warm. There are relatively few types of afternoon tea, and the happy hour is not bad. The lighting in the evening is elegant but a little lively. The a**osphere is well set out, making the transition from business to life. It's also nice to drink some wine after dinner.

🏊The hotel's swimming pool is beautifully decorated. The dome design and curved pillars are very layered. Coupled with three large chandeliers, it is very beautiful during the day and night. There is also a terrace outside the swimming pool where you can enjoy the river view at night.

🪴What’s more interesting is that the hotel has a platform to build its own vegetable garden. The characteristics of JW Marriott can also be seen in this Sheraton.

The beautiful woman who cleans the room every day also helps fold the clothes very neatly. The location is also very good, on the edge of the Yangtze River, and there is a night market on the riverside downstairs. The dining time for breakfast is very user-friendly. 6.30 to 10.30 is the best hotel I have encountered during my travels where I can sleep in and still have breakfast. Because it is off-season, hotel prices are also very cheap. Next time I go to Chongqing, I will choose Sheraton.

Average experience.

The hotel itself is good, with a unique shape, and the surrounding area is prosperous. There are many places to eat and play, and the river view is also very beautiful. However, the main door is under repair and can only be accessed from the side door... which kind of ruins the quality of the hotel...

The room is quite comfortable. The Chinese restaurant on the 7th floor has good reviews. Both the service and the taste of the dishes are very good.
Will stay again.

It's just a pity that there are no activities in the hotel during New Year's Eve.

In terms of location, it is right on the edge of the Yangtze River. The river view is first-rate, and there is a very lively night market at the door. It is very convenient to take a taxi or get transportation wherever you go.
In terms of environment, the European style decoration is indeed very "local tycoon style". The photo and check-in areas on the first floor and the eighth floor are both good.
In terms of service, the concierge and front desk were very enthusiastic. They also gave us breakfast, which was a very warm service. I would like to express my special thanks to customer service Xia Tian for his hospitality and calling us back to learn about our stay. I will stay here next time I come to Chongqing.

I don’t know how the guest room is managed. Picture 4
Sixth: The sink is dark, the wall lamp on one side is broken and has not been repaired, and the ceiling light is just a dim spotlight.
Summary: If the boss doesn’t want to run a five-star hotel well, he should just look for other businesses. If a high-end brand is transformed into this, it’s useless even if it has a luxurious appearance. None of the Sheratons in the country are like this. Simply unfavorable. Worst experience in the whole process.
I like the landscape, culture, creativity and food of the mountain city...

There are two small noodle shops behind the hotel, Qin Yun *** Tan Tan Noodles and Yang Ji Noodles, both of which taste very good. Cha Yan Yuese and Hema Xiansheng are both very close. Although previous reviews said that the service was not good and the facilities were old, after personal experience, it was just the opposite. The reception staff at the lobby and the door were very friendly and helped deliver the luggage to the door of the room and the car. The room was large in size. , the bed is bigger than that of ordinary hotels, and what makes me particularly comfortable is the bath water, which has a very strong flow.

The room is older than you can imagine, and the interior decoration makes you feel like you have traveled back in time 20 years ago. The backrest of the leather bed is dirty with black marks that cannot be wiped off. The shower facilities in the bathroom cannot be switched. The most annoying thing is that the soundproofing of the class is so bad that the room next door cannot be used at 4 o'clock in the middle of the night. I wore earplugs and was woken up while watching TV. It felt like someone was talking in your ear. At this level, it is better to book it for the whole season and it will be clean and refreshing. The service staff didn't provide much service. I called in the middle of the night to say that I was woken up. There was no apology the next day, and the front desk was very cold. In short, it is absolutely a trap! I can't help but complain, I didn't sleep well all night, it's too bad.

msg:This is the worst hotel my parents have ever visited in Sichuan for more than 20 days. When I booked the room, I had Ctrip's privilege to upgrade the room type. My parents explained this to the front desk when they checked in, and the front desk said they had been upgraded. My parents and I video chatted and found that the room type had not been upgraded, so I called Ctrip customer service for consultation, and Ctrip helped contact them. The hotel's reply to Ctrip was that the front desk didn't know we had this right. In fact, this was a lie, because my parents mentioned it to the front desk when they checked in. The hotel contacted my parents and told them that they could upgrade, but it was already very late. My parents went to see the room and found that the room size and facilities were not much different, so they did not change rooms. Such a small thing shows how perfunctory and dishonest the hotel is to its guests.
The next day my parents went to have breakfast, but the restaurant service staff said they couldn't find their parents' names. My parents reminded me that it was Ctrip's free breakfast entitlement. The service staff called the front desk and said they couldn't verify it. If communication is normal then it is not a big problem. The problem was that the restaurant service staff had a very bad attitude during the entire communication process. They kept yelling at my parents and were shockingly rude and rude. After I found out, I contacted Ctrip customer service, who immediately contacted the hotel and verified that the order included breakfast in less than 2 minutes. So is Ctrip customer service the only one responsible for communicating with the hotel? The rights and interests that are obviously included normally cannot be found out by the guests themselves, so can Ctrip solve it in just 2 minutes?
My parents, who are nearly 70 years old, have been visiting Sichuan and Chongqing for more than 20 days. I helped most of them book star-rated hotels. I hope the service staff can have a better attitude and be more patient with the elderly. It is true that most hotels deserve their reputation, such as Emeishan Hongzhu Mountain, Dazu Rock Carving Temple, and Wyndham Chongqing all have very good services. This Sheraton is the one I most regret booking. The poor quality of the service staff is one of the reasons. I also recommend that Ctrip not give you free benefits if you can't afford them. Although Ctrip's customer service is very good, the second communication adds too much time and cost, and it adds to the trip in vain. Not going well.
If I were to check in on my own, I would definitely argue with the front desk and complain about the attitude of the restaurant service staff. My parents are too old to have the energy to do extra things, but it will also greatly affect my mood during the next few days of travel.
Objectively speaking, the only advantage a hotel has is its location. But after all, there are so many choices in Chongqing, so it’s not a must. When you go out to play, you want to feel happy, not spend money and feel miserable.

The facilities and equipment are also relatively old.
The only good thing is that the floor-to-ceiling windows are really big and you can see a beautiful night view.

The hotel is built along the river, so if you go for a walk, the scenery is pretty good. There are also some shopping malls nearby, which is convenient for shopping and eating.

msg:#ChongqingSheraton Hotel, I stayed at this hotel because of the Sheraton brand. The location is very good, which allows me to work efficiently and feel the charm of Chongqing. When talking about this hotel, I use the warmest words to describe it.
From check-in to departure, every moment was full of surprises and comfort. The warm service and professionalism of the staff made me feel that this hotel has the mature and stable Sheraton level.
I especially like Summer Chen in the executive lounge and Manager Lan at the front desk. They not only arranged a comfortable room, but also arranged my breakfast very thoughtfully. The concierge staff are also very welcoming, patient and warm. I like the rooms in this hotel. They are large, exquisitely decorated, and the bedding and hot water are particularly good. In addition, the hotel has complete facilities, you can swim, and the various services are considerate and thoughtful, which made my trip even more enjoyable. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any traveler looking for a perfect stay.

I upgraded to a river view room with a little extra rice, which was great value for money. The room was larger and had a full view of the river and bright lights. The service response is timely and the proactive service awareness is strong. The bed is big enough and a little soft, and the overall hardware foundation is pretty good. Overall recommended!

The view of the river opposite is unbeatable, here are a few random photos.

No one answered the phone…. When I finally checked out, I specifically mentioned Again. Unfortunately, the answer I got was: We are sometimes busy...囧rzo


Hygiene: normal.


Environment: The moment I entered the lobby, I was shocked by the three big pillars in the lobby. I was so shocked that I didn’t know what to do...Everywhere was so magnificent. I thought I was in a certain **** or Vienna hotel in Macau...


Facilities: Very old and probably not renovated. Picture 3 is a representative... Toilet 🚽The toilet tank is called tick-tock-tock...tick-tock-tock...


transportation:
Opposite the Yangtze River in the core area of ​​Jiefangbei. If you are a tourist coming to Chongqing, it is not recommended to book this hotel. Because it will take you a lot of time to take a taxi back and forth across the river🚗.

Walking from the hotel to Hongya Cave at night, it really feels like Chongqing. There is an old street with one step at a time, and there is helplessness up and down. Watching the subway whistling, feeling the river wind blowing, sighing at the majesty of the bridge across the river, admiring the Cruise on the river and watch the lights of thousands of houses on both sides of the river!

msg:In such a nice city, the hotel service is really disappointing. In a tourist city, is the service so bad? If you want breakfast, you have to go to the front desk to sign. Can't a five-star hotel go to the room and ask guests to sign? Why should I choose Sheraton? The main reason is that the five-star service is good. You have to go down and get the takeout yourself. What age is it? There are so many employees who work hard! There are various exemption agreements to sign, and it can be said that there is no service at all! ! ! The worst Sheraton I have ever stayed at, and the breakfast was meager! It really makes me angry. The employees here feel like the guests owe them something. How could the Chongqing Culture and Tourism Bureau do this? It seems that we can’t promote it on **! Now that the Internet is so developed, you still dare to be so arrogant. I said that there was a lot of noise in the room at night, and the front desk told me that I didn’t know that I had never stayed there! Simply! ! !

We wanted to live in a room with a view of the river, so we checked in earlier. We asked the guy at the front desk and we got the room we wanted. I went to the takeaway cabinet to get takeout, but I didn't bring my mobile phone. The uncle waiter at the door offered to scan it for me, thank you very much. The price of ice cream in the freezer at the door has not increased too much, and the food delivery service is also pretty good, delicious and inexpensive, and cost-effective.
Of course, as far as the room facilities are concerned, they are indeed quite old. The wallpaper and carpets are probably due for replacement. If you insist on the five-star standard, some hardware details will definitely not pass the test. But I still want to give Sheraton five stars, because every communication with the staff is very pleasant, and the flaws are not hidden! !

The rooms are European-style, with pleasant scenery and convenient transportation. The Hongya Cave where we stayed on the first day was very crowded and we couldn't get in. I couldn't get out, so I changed here decisively. I am very satisfied. It’s just that the restaurant doesn’t allow you to wear sandals and slippers. I don’t understand it.

The front desk directly said that there were no towels. I had to go out and buy them myself. I understand that the facilities are old and the minimum service is still required.
I never give negative reviews. Reviews have no other meaning. When I come to Chongqing, I want everyone to enjoy the basic services that they should enjoy. I don’t want everyone who comes to the hotel to encounter a similar situation in the future.

2. The facilities are outdated and feel very tofu. The curtains in the bathroom are uneven, the power button is crooked, and the mirror is stained with rust, etc.
3. I was told that only suites in the entire hotel have river views. The view I can see from this room is shown in the picture. When booking, you must take your needs and actual situation into consideration
4. I don’t know the source and brand of the bath products/the bedding is not sure if it matches the star rating (those who know better are welcome to literacy)
The lobby is really grand and the floor height is very high. Looking around, there is no trash can, and there is no trash can in the elevator room on the floor (22)
5. There was water vapor in the drinking water provided in the room when it was unopened. I don’t know what’s going on or whether it’s normal or not.

msg:Sheraton is not like this in other cities. [Question] [Question] There is no soundproofing in Chongqing at night. I will never come back to a rubbish hotel again. I had to change my room at 11 o'clock in the evening, but the female receptionist sent me away when she said there was no room available. If you don’t have a room, you won’t have a room. You can’t even say sorry or feel embarrassed. I have to adapt to the lack of soundproofing by myself. From the tone of the front desk, I am a veteran who deals with soundproofing every day. I was moved to an executive suite at night when I couldn't stand it anymore. The executive suite couldn't heal my inner shadow. Some river view suites are actually divided into two rooms for use. Is this the washbasin of a five-star hotel? There is no ceiling lamp for washing in this five-star hotel. I don’t know who the wise guy came up with it [strong][strong][strong][strong]

msg:I won't stay in the hotel for the second time, the experience is so bad! Apart from the magnificent buildings and superior location, there are no advantages in other places! All the staff at the front desk faced each other coldly, without any sense of intimacy. It is understandable that the room is old. After all, in an old hotel, the quality of tea and toiletries in the room is definitely the quality of a two or three hundred hotel. Anyway, I booked an executive suite with more than 1,000 yuan. For breakfast, because my mother likes to eat fried dumplings, she took some more for us to eat, but we didn’t eat them. She thought it was not good to waste, so she asked the tall and thin lady in the restaurant if she could pack them, but she was rejected Yes, I can understand, it's a buffet. As a result, she said, "Why can't I eat so much?" The little brother who cooks noodles, I want to eat dumplings, but I don't want to eat the prepared seasonings, so I ask him to add lard, salt and chicken essence, and I am impatient Throwing the bowl on the stage...Professional attitude determines professional height, so he is only suitable for cooking noodles! Going out to play, thinking that I won’t be able to come back before two o’clock to check out, thinking that my parents can rest when they come back, so I stayed for another night, a total of two nights. The same Sheraton, why can the Sheraton in Xi'an have a good service attitude in all depar**ents? Including the cleaning lady who cleans up the room! I just read the reviews, and most of them have the same experience as me. If you read the reviews before booking a hotel, you probably won’t stay at the Sheraton with such a poor experience. Finally, thank you for the breakfast for two presented by the front desk!

From the doorman to the front desk, they are all cold and there is no service at all. The layout of the room is weird, and an ominous magnetic field keeps you awake all night. There is a problem with drainage in the bathroom, the shower in the bathtub is broken, and the air conditioner is also broken. It is hot at 17 degrees! Will never stay at Sheraton again! ps: We couldn't stay for two nights, so we contacted Ctrip's customer service in the middle of the night. The customer service handled the problem very quickly, and it was resolved at 10 o'clock the next day! Praise Ctrip for maintaining high-quality customers.

    Cleanliness: The hotel is really old, the rooms are disgusting, can you imagine a big disgusting stain on the stool? Others dare not look closely. The only service is the aunt who disinfected the bathtub for me, because the hotel does not provide disposable bathtub bags.
     Environment: The surrounding area is not lively, there is a night market at night, noisy, smoky snacks, the environment is very bad. Except for his so-called suite, no other room can see the river view.
     Service: In such a big hotel, there is only one waiter per place on average. On the night of check-in, the room arranged was dilapidated and the air conditioner was noisy. Communicate with the front desk. The front desk is not trying to solve the problems of guests. It is completely irresponsible to say "our hotel is old, you can pay more for a better room, if you are not satisfied, we can help you check out". First of all, at night, you asked me to rebook the hotel. Will you pay for the round-trip fare? Do you pay the difference? Instead of solving the problem of passengers, can you just send me away if you can check out? Extremely irresponsible. Secondly, the hotel is open for business, not for rushing customers. Again, it is very uncomfortable to say that you will add money at every turn. If I live in your hotel, I should accept your dilapidated room?
     Facilities: Old, the air conditioner is noisy at night, and the toiletries are all bottled. Not in vials.

msg:The receptionist's attitude was very poor, and there was no service expected from a 5-star hotel. We took a Yangtze River cruise to Chongqing on the morning of the 10th. Because I arrived early, I called the front desk the day before and said that I could check in as long as there was a room available. As a result, when we arrived at the front desk of the hotel to check in on the morning of the 10th, a male waiter wearing glasses said with disgust, "No check-in in the morning." Then we explained that we had called yesterday and there were available rooms that we could check in. , and then said coldly, "The room was full yesterday." This indifferent attitude suddenly extinguished our enthusiasm for coming to Chongqing. My friends and I feel that we will not choose Sheraton when visiting Chongqing in the future.
By the way, hotels need to strengthen training on front desk business capabilities. At the end of check-in, they were not told where the passenger elevator was? When I checked whether breakfast was included, they didn't proactively remind me, which floor is breakfast on and what time is the meal? These service details need to be improved.

Before coming here, I saw some comments saying that the hotel facilities are a bit old, but it’s actually not bad. During the Spring Festival, more than 1,000 people stayed in a five-star hotel, which is considered cost-effective! In short, staying at the Sheraton was a pleasant surprise, and I will consider it in the future!

msg:If you want to experience a five-star hotel, don't book this one. Except for the scenery of the river view suite, there is no place that is five-star. The worst Sheraton I have ever stayed in: 1. The hotel facilities are old ;2. The service is too bad, there is no executive front desk on the executive floor; 3. The executive lounge is very perfunctory, and there are only a few cheap desserts in the afternoon; 4. I wanted to take a bath, but the hot water was not hot; 5. No fruit was delivered when I checked in. I called the front desk in the afternoon and it was delivered at 10:30 in the evening. Don't book this Sheraton in Chongqing for the same level and price. As far as the hotel looks bluffing, in fact, the service level is not even up to the express hotel.

msg:As soon as I checked in, I heard the guests and the front desk being hypocritical. Although it may be the customer's problem (they are older), the attitude of the front desk is not very good and they are impatient. After the customer left, the colleague next to her told her that you should not send things. . I also work in hotels, and have worked for many international brands. Although it is inevitable to complain about customers, it is better not to say so in front of other customers...
I asked the front desk if there is a 24-hour parking so that I don't need to register every time. It is not understandable, but the answer from the front desk is very uncomfortable. He said: The parking lot is not owned by the hotel, and we will pay the fee on your behalf. ? ? ? Isn't it normal for hotels to park for free? Besides, many hotel parking lots do not belong to the hotel. What does it mean to pay for me? . . Do I have to thank you?
When I first arrived in Chongqing, I felt that Chongqing people are so rigid...
I didn't see cheese products for breakfast. I don't know if Chongqing doesn't eat cheese or what. It stands to reason that it is normal for a hotel at this price to have cheese.
The male chef who cooks eggs for breakfast is very nice and very polite

Because the Spring Festival is approaching, I don’t want to live in an apar**ent. The hotel has the feeling of Chinese New Year first, and it’s something my two parents-in-law like to enjoy the hotel breakfast slowly. The hotel is on the south bank of the Yangtze River, relatively clean. It is within walking distance to Longmenhao Old Street and the Yangtze River Cableway, and it is not far to go to Nanshan Hotpot by taxi. Hotel parking is convenient and free. The overall service is OK, nothing bad or special, the bathroom ventilation is not enough, generally speaking, so-so. There is a trail along the river, so it is convenient to go out for exercise in the morning.

msg:It is not what you want to have the title of Sheraton for nothing. There is no problem with outdated facilities, the key is not to lose the character of a star hotel. After being downgraded and arranged for the first time staying in a hotel, I still insisted that the guests did not suffer any disadvantages and had received various special care. After confronting on the phone, I proposed to arrange the best room type of 02 suites, but I am sorry that it is no longer needed. I can’t accompany you to change overnight room to play. If you book an executive river view suite, please avoid room type 01. The bedroom is dark, the room has two walls, and the bathroom is really horrible. I dare say it is not as good as the bathroom layout of the basic room type. The room is small and even the sofa is one size less. . Ctrip's four-hour early check-in is the slogan. The executive lounge is empty, and it is changed to the happy hour on the second floor, which is to decorate the meals in the cafeteria without any plate for you to designate. The number of service staff can be extremely small, and no one can answer the front desk call for a minute. A set of sofas in the room is not of the same type. You can soak your feet while taking a shower in the shower room, and the wall lamps are also broken... In short, after spending more than 1,000, you thought you had snatched a cost-effective suite, but it turned out that the guests thought too much.

The service is good, but there may be too many people during the Chinese New Year, so it was not cleaned until after 5 o'clock on the day of check-in. The most valuable thing about the hotel may be its location, on the edge of the Yangtze River and close to Yuzhong District. However, the size of the room has shrunk a bit. The superior executive room we booked does not feel like 42 square meters. It's okay to live in usually, but the price increase is too sharp during the Chinese New Year.

Although this old-fashioned five-star hotel in French palace style is a little old, the details of the hotel show the style of the hotel, and the classical music of the palace style makes people feel happy. Special thanks to the front desk supervisor Zheng, who is very nice, understands the needs of customers, and gives positive responses and services. All in all, highly recommended!

msg:The experience of staying this time is really good. I never choose Sheraton Chongqing Hotel every time I come to Chongqing. Basically, I have stayed in other hotels, but I was very surprised by the choice this time. For a long time, the two shining big golden buildings are always a bit unacceptable. Under the dazzling appearance, they have also experienced a lot of disturbances. In fact, they still quite like their European-style decoration, which is very old in Europe. , Especially the murals and fireplaces in the room, not only play a heating function but also a decorative effect, but it is estimated that many people do not know how to use it. Many people like to live in new hotels, but the old hotels still have her charm. In fact, this is only a kind of a**osphere in China. Many hotels abroad are very old, and each building has a very cultural heritage and service concept. . In fact, in the final analysis, every guest stays in a hotel, and there is basically nothing to do except sleep. To put it bluntly, it is just service. Their service is really good. Although they are new employees, they are very kind. Xiao Zheng’s smile. Speaking of smiles, there are really no employees in many hotels now. Maybe they are all wearing masks now, maybe they are under pressure now. Basically, the staff can't take care of the guests and chat with the guests, but they are different! The eldest sister in the guest room is also very fond. Seeing that I like drinking water, she gave me a few more bottles, chatted with me, and introduced some snacks around me. It's a very comfortable choice here, with reasonable prices and excellent service. thank you all!

msg:To explain, I stayed in an ordinary double-bed room, but these photos are upgraded river-view rooms.
The Sheraton Chongqing Hotel exceeded my expectations. Originally, the online reviews said that the breakfast is relatively old and there are not many choices, so I don’t want to choose it. But considering I want to take a walk on Nanbin Road, and the current price of Ctrip is very cost-effective, it is better than Marriott's own. The membership price on the APP is still low, so it is set.
When I checked in, I told Nancy Xiaosu at the front desk that I hadn't been to Chongqing for a long time. The scenery on both sides of the river view was two different concepts before. I really wanted to see the river view. Nancy said that I would try my best to satisfy my wish. I found a river view room (I don’t know if it’s an elite or an executive river view), but the sanitation hasn’t been done and we need to wait. I had no problem at all. I didn't even have lunch. I wanted to go to the nearby old man Yi to try three dishes. Xiao Su arranged for the concierge to save my luggage. Thank you very much Xiao Su for his kindness and service spirit.
The view of the room is really good, just because of the reflection of the indoor light, it is not easy to take pictures outside and there is no indoor space😄

🚗 Transportation: Convenient taxi, walking smoothly on Nanbin Road, a map of Pingchuan, not many in Chongqing

🧹Hygienic: Very clean, with good details. The toothbrush is neither soft nor sturdy, it fits the teeth well, the best hotel toothbrush I have ever used, so I didn't even use the toothbrush I brought.


🍃Environment: The lobby is very large and very large. Nowadays, a newer hotel in the center of a provincial capital city in China can hardly have such conditions. The hardware of the room does not look new, but it is kept in good condition, and it is also easy to use. I can see the experience and consideration. Especially the charging socket fixed at the head of the bed,

🔔Service: The front desk service is very good, even the colleagues on duty at night are also very quick. The room cleaning is also well-trained. I just put my toothpaste, razor, and body lotion on the bathroom sink in the bathroom. It’s neat and tidy. It’s very comfortable to come back in the evening. This is standard, well-trained and experienced. New hotels often can’t do this. Although it’s not expensive, you can feel their thoughts—the self that the guests are used to. The items are their best items and must be respected.
In general, if it is a business trip, the work is not far away, or if you are traveling but do not need to transfer to Jiefangbei or Jiangbei all day, it is really a very comfortable choice, the price is reasonable, the service is excellent and considerate, and it is stable.
thank you all!

msg:First of all, thanks to Xiao Ran at the front desk for upgrading us to the 180-degree river view elite room for free. It gave me a big surprise. This time I came here for a half-work and half-tour. I miss Sheraton for seeing the river view of Chongqing. After explaining to Xiao Ran, Helped me upgrade the Riverview Elite Room. I used to come to Chongqing frequently for work reasons. I have been to many hotels in Chongqing. The Sheraton has come to many, and I have stayed in various room types. Objectively speaking, the Sheraton Riverview Room is the most enjoyable and beautiful. Now the people-friendly route taken by Sheraton is very cost-effective, and the facilities, sanitation and services still retain the configuration of a luxury hotel. The big room of this river view elite room is really super big, and the viewing effect is also very good. The room has a variety of configurations. The same price can have such a large room in Chongqing. I don’t have such a luxury hotel with such a good viewing effect. Found it again. There are still many memories of Sheraton. From when I was young, I overlooked the Sheraton, which hadn't opened yet, to the first time I visited in 2017, and I liked Sheraton. There are many stories in Sheraton, and I also have a special affection for Sheraton. I also ask a little question here. I hope to adopt it. The jbl sound effect in the room is particularly good. It takes away the Bluetooth connection function. The operation is actually very simple, but you may not know how to use it for the first time. If you can do it carefully The explanation is actually pretty good. I still hope to optimize the socket problem. The switch of the automatic curtain may be a little aging, you can replace it in time. In short, Sheraton is now very cost-effective, the rooms are large, well-equipped, and the scenery is very good. It is the best choice for those who like river views and cost-effectiveness. Thanks again to Xiao Ran and Xiao Fu, I hope Sheraton is getting better and better, see you next time.

The room attendant saw the note I left and said that the quilt was too thin, so he immediately added one to me and apologized to me when he saw me. The waiter on the viewing platform on the 8th floor was very polite. I came back late that day and the viewing platform had already turned off the lights. I heard that I couldn’t see the river view when I checked out the next day. I immediately opened the platform to let me go up and let us take my time. Look, don't worry. The front desk clerk, because the electronic invoice is always unacceptable, the waiter took the trouble to help me check it, and finally printed a copy for me to use. The hotel is located in the Nan'an District, with convenient transportation and plenty of surrounding food. It is only half an hour away from the airport. You can choose Sheraton for tourism and business.

The bedding is very comfortable, the shower head is very watery, and the water temperature is stable. These are all satisfactory, but the details are really not like five-star. The front desk service attitude is very average, there is no smile during the whole process, there is no more language, let alone a warm reminder to the guests. The environment from the parking lot to the hotel lobby is very poor, smelly. The body lotion and TV remote control in the room are all gray. Although the sink is TOTO, it is quite old and the water flow is very slow! The whole experience of staying in is very ordinary, I feel that I have stayed in a fake Sheraton! I don’t know if the same is true for Sheraton hotel services in other cities!

After staying in, I am very satisfied with the hotel’s room design, hotel buffet, swimming pool and other aspects. The observation deck on the 8th floor can see both sides of the Jialing River. The beautiful night view of Chongqing is a very recommended hotel.

msg:This time we stayed at the Sheraton Hotel was particularly touched. It is worthy of the service of a five-star hotel. We checked out at 9 o'clock in the morning. We were going to stroll around Jiefangbei, but we started to start after we finished breakfast. After the pouring rain, it is impossible to go shopping. But I regretted that I shouldn't have returned the room in such a hurry. I went back to the hotel lobby to hide from the rain after ten o’clock, so I decided to try it out to discuss with the reception desk if we could open the room we used to live in, and let us go up and rest for a while, because our train is also in the afternoon. Back to Chengdu after 5 o'clock. Unexpectedly, after I told the reception staff, she picked up the phone and called where I didn't know. Then she gave us the 2915 room card. Wow, I was so happy. I kept saying thank you to her at the time, but unfortunately I didn't remember the name of the staff member. But this also shows that the five-star service of the Sheraton Hotel is really warm and human. When we had nowhere to go when we were the most difficult time, it gave us such a caring service 👍I have shared it with friends around me when we go home Yes, let them go to Chongqing to choose Sheraton Hotel in the future. I will also stay for a few days in the future and enjoy it. If I can upgrade my river view room next time, I will be even happier😃

msg:Thank you, Sheraton, for giving you the first bad review since Ctrip.
The first time I stayed at the Sheraton in Chongqing, I really didn’t know that it had so many stories. It turned out to be “notorious” because it was close to the Shi Guangnan Grand Theater. It was set for the convenience of travel. Now I will talk about my speechlessness:
1. There is no guidance, no smile, no service in the whole process of entering the lobby, only the words "Please show your health code" and "Check-in is not done at this counter." After giving me the room card, I started walking around, and I couldn't understand the card. Exactly my question, but is it difficult for you to guide a passenger elevator? I also don't ask for one-to-one service by a dedicated person. Is it difficult for you to verbally guide you to go straight and turn left?
2. The room has a retro style, and it is really interesting to live in a more modern and simple way. Everything is manual, and there is no smart home, so it does not constitute a deduction. But your ventilation is really bad, you know? ? Really bad! very bad! very bad! The window can only be opened by one gap, and then there is a funny writing on the window glass: "It is not recommended to open the window, there are mosquitoes in summer." Indeed! Mosquitoes can only fly into your windowpane! Reflected to the front desk, the front desk said: You can turn off the hot air. ? I don't know how to turn off the hot air? I need you to tell me to turn off the hot air? The front desk continued to say: There is really no way to do this here.
Thank you, really, I lived in Chongqing at 13 degrees, and lived at 31 degrees without air conditioning. It was too hot to sleep even in the morning.
3. The funniest thing happened. I traveled alone for so many years, and I lived in everything, but I didn't hear the sound of exercising in the middle of the night. Thank you, Sheraton, the first experience I heard of others exercising was given to me.
4. When getting off the elevator, a guest and a manager come in, and there is a reception and etiquette throughout. Oh, I think you guys actually have a service? Maybe it's people like us who don't deserve it? Then I think you locked that room and only opened the suite ^^

msg:The hotel facilities are old, but I think this is acceptable. But the strange thing is that the service of the hotel is really bad. The deputy manager of the lobby has a very bad attitude. Because the bracelet was forgotten in the room, the hotel only found half of it. . It's okay to have a particularly bad attitude. If you want to see his badge, he has to beat people. I really don't know how a hotel like this can claim to be a five-star hotel. The New Year's Eve is really busy.

We asked the front desk staff to check in in advance, asked for a higher floor of the room, arranged a room for 2009, very satisfied. Although we can't see the river view, the city view outside the room is also good. The front desk MM also sent a breakfast buffet for the child, which was really sweet. The return trip was one day ahead of the flight, not only delayed check-out at 2 pm, but also refunded a night's accommodation fee. It was too good [strong]

msg:At the beginning, we hesitated for a long time and read bad reviews, such as the old facilities, the musty smell, and the smelly carpet. But then we thought about it and thought that the Shangri-La brand was trustworthy, so we chose this hotel. The room is not big (because we made the room messy, we won't take pictures.) But it's very tidy, and someone will come to deliver fruit at noon.
I force the back garden! ! ! (Emphasis)
The back garden is great for walking after dinner, it's really similar to a small park. There are animals, there are recliners, there are rocking chairs...
And the young lady at the front desk is super nice! (Forgot to ask her name)
But her service was very attentive, she kept sending us to the room, and gave us an extra breakfast for the children, and then added our WeChat to recommend some good places to travel and eat.
We specifically requested a quiet room, although sometimes cars/motorcycles pass by, but the overall quietness at night is still very good.
But it is recommended to come to a master to fix the safe~
The quality of the air conditioner is super good.
Overall it's still very good, I don't know if it is a coincidence or something, it feels totally different from a bad review! ! (It's not a support, the picture has not even the filter added!)
I won't say anything for the rest, it is quite recommended to stay!

Can’t we arrange to clean the room in advance? If I arrive at the store at 15 o'clock, I would have to wait for an hour... Asking this question, this woman said that the customer is not of good quality. Does Sheraton teach the waiters like this? ! Then I threw my ID card to me and asked if I could not live, and I reined in it. This shop bullied its customers, and it was embodied in a waiter so naked. The key point is that your family is not too big, so you have a temper. Big? She tore up the list, shook her grin, turned around and left. Later, the waiter wearing glasses next to her checked in, and the room was also available. Isn't this making things difficult? You can go to the video to see the face of this woman at the time, and then ask her if her recent life is not harmonious, if she is qualified for this position, and if she knows what she does. Bad reviews, bad reviews must be bad, how do you deal with this matter? The hotel offends guests because of this kind of garbage man, who will go to your house!

msg:先説一下整個流程，我是一直關注着房價，大概9月中旬的時候價格一直在1000左右，後來快到9月底的時候價格在830不含早（我定的三天，價格是均價）。我在前台辦理入住，本想升級江景房後來問需要補多少差價，前台告知我需要1200，我定的是三天，覺得還可以一天多400，我説行。接着前台那淺淺的微笑我記憶猶新啊，一天1200哦，我就放棄了。辦理好入住衹給我了一張房卡，到房間以後黴味兒非常大，也有國慶連續下雨的原因。後來給我換了一間，這次給到我的是兩張房卡。最後一天我上午離店交完房卡，下午竟然問我還續住嗎。接着就是常規套路，一個完全陌生的人名，不好意思打擾你能給個五星好評嗎？下次你來了我給你多點巴拉巴拉的。服務意識和沿海城市比差的不是一星半點。
康樂部還可以，游泳池乾淨，帶一個江景的露台。
店內精品旅拍一次（贈送三張精修電子版）這個他們也沒提，我也不需要，無所謂。

服務人員全程沒有笑臉，也不積極主動。雖然不是親子酒店，但對帶孩子的家庭個別方面不夠友好，比如洗手枱高，問前台沒有洗手凳，不提供床圍和嬰兒床。

床品舒適度ok，睡着舒服。雖然槽點較多，但畢竟是五星級酒店，比起快捷酒店肯定是好的選擇。

msg:在重慶住過不少酒店，基本行政房或套房，比如兩江希爾頓，江北希爾頓逸林，金源大酒店等。這次三晚，一晚喜來登4110房，兩晚帝晶3815房，從設施、位置、視野來説，喜來登還是不錯的。下車時門僮、入住時前台也是很好的，這兩項比帝晶好不少。酒店的最大問題在餐飲和客房：行政酒廊和早餐的服務人員明顯沒有做過正規培訓，客房服務也是非常欠缺的。內容太多，沒法詳述。相對來説帝晶的餐飲服務要好不少，但行政酒廊也差。從服務來講我推薦兩江希爾頓，從視野來講推薦喜來登，從位置來講推薦帝晶，從性價比來講推薦金源。

作為一個大品牌酒店，不能以店大欺客的思維來經營酒店。有損形象。

msg:回京的路上就等不及來評論了，從沒給過差評，但這次真的非常差。由於重慶暴雨，決定不趕路休整一天再走，厭惡堵車，所以選擇了南岸，結果從辦理入住時由於下雨沒房多問幾句就各種不耐煩，説等40分鐘才有房，還要了電話，結果冒雨出去吃飯兩個多小時也沒人聯繫過，意料之中，根本不會有人聯繫。我住宿的第一訴求就是安靜，所以一般衹有一個要求就是離電梯越遠越好，結果和我説房間雖然是電梯出來第一間房，但不挨着電梯，我想可能酒店對自己的隔音有信心，也不想再繼續等房就接受了。
一進門房間老舊壓抑就不談了，晚上樓下什麼啤酒節也忍了，畢竟我想也不會超過24點。正在終於有睏意準備睡覺時，電梯到達樓層的“叮咚”聲一下讓我睏意全無，然後整晚樓上樓下所有的電梯到達音，連綿不斷，一直持續到凌晨2點多才基本結束，由於孩子已睡，趕緊等到早點8點就匆匆退房趕路了。
我出行一趟一般都得換十幾家五星酒店，雅高，IHG等是衹要賓客提出要求就會竭盡全力滿足，萬豪集團是你敢提出要求，我就要説服你接受我給你安排的，但絕不滿足你的要求，以後衹能敬而遠之了。

大廳就是個大，角落上幾把長椅，離總枱老遠，太不人性化。
房間設施陳舊，就一把椅子還是塌陷突出邊框，根本無法坐，早該仍了；房間的燈和開關都有壞的。
佔據了極好的位置，外觀也很突出顯眼，趕快重新裝修吧。
