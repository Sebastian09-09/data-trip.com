msg:Facilities: The room area is well divided, the bathroom is separated into three areas of dry and wet, oxygen is diffused 24 hours a day (like), equipped with Dyson, wardrobe, balcony for drying small clothes, and enjoying the blue sky from time to time.
Hygiene: clean and tidy
Service: First of all, communicate with the housekeeper through the platform before booking, confirm the floor height and other issues, the reply is very satisfactory, and decisively book. After arriving at the store, I upgraded the suite room because I stayed for five nights.
On the first day of check-in, the housekeeper took me to the room and carefully introduced the facilities and bathroom supplies. The recommended yak butter soap is really easy to use. I haven't used up one piece of hand washing for so many days.
Here, I felt the enthusiasm of all the staff for the first time. In Lhasa, I am not traveling, I stay in the hotel for a long time, so I have more experience. I pass by the lobby many times a day, and the front desk staff on duty greet me with a sincere smile.
I don’t have the habit of eating breakfast. The room phone will definitely ring after ten o’clock in the morning, asking if I want to go downstairs for breakfast. Do you need coffee? Rice noodles or yogurt? So, I asked for coffee, and when it was delivered, there was also a bowl of yogurt. I enjoy such service every day. On the day of checking out, I went to the restaurant for breakfast and found that there were at least six or seven employees serving meals and asking other guests about their accommodation experience. Oh, I forgot to introduce that the rice noodles for breakfast were great and the soup base was delicious.
The bar on the first floor has a bit of atmosphere. If you are too lazy to go out at night, listen to music and drink some wine, it is very nice. I went there once, but unfortunately my partner couldn't drink, so I could only order a cocktail to the room alone. The room service was as smooth as always, and the mojito tasted good.
I praised so many details based on having been to the plateau more than 30 times, based on having been to Lhasa eight times, and based on having experienced every five-star hotel in Lhasa. More importantly, I relatively understand the scarcity or high prices of materials on the plateau, and I like the history and culture of *******s. For architecture and connotation, they cannot be compared with the international hotel version.
The in-store work team of Arokhamba is the best among the homestay hotels I have stayed in, with quality, enthusiasm, and thoughtful professional services. Thank you for giving me a surprise in Lhasa!

msg:The most comfortable night in Lhasa. I like the room layout, a big bucket of drinking water is great, the bed is very comfortable, the breakfast is rich, the rice noodles are really delicious, it looks light, but it is actually very flavorful

Facilities and environment: The whole hotel is a "villa" with ******* characteristics. The room is very warm, oxygen is supplied all day, and you can be in a daze sitting in front of the window. You can go to the roof to drink coffee

Hygiene: Standard 5⭐️, very satisfied

Service: Tea and snacks are served as soon as you enter the door. There is a butler service, which is particularly reassuring. They will remember which room you are in, and take the initiative to ask if there is anything they can serve. They can wake you up, deliver breakfast to the room, etc. Brother Zhaxi is very handsome and considerate

Suggestions for improvement
1. The door of the room does not seem to be able to close automatically, and you need to check whether it is closed tightly
2. The iron plate for soap in the washroom is very unique, but the soap will stick if it is placed horizontally

msg:It is a homestay designed with great care. Every detail shows the designer's concept and care. It not only incorporates ******* elements, but also does not make you feel that it is too difficult to accept ethnic characteristics... It has a good balance and combination of modern high-end texture and ethnic elements... It is highly recommended for those who study architectural design or young artists to experience it! A homestay that will not disappoint you in terms of hardware and software! Let's talk about the service. The service is very meticulous. Breakfast will actively recommend local specialties to guests... In short, it is a very good choice for this trip to Tibet... Now I regret staying in other standard five-star hotels for three consecutive days (which are also good, but the design here makes people feel more attentive and warm) and finally met Aruo Khampa...

Breakfast also has a ******* dining experience, with tsampa, sweet tea, and butter tea. A cup of ******* sweet tea every morning starts the day with a good mood!

Because of altitude sickness, I had a fever late at night and was driven to the hospital by the housekeeper in the early morning, and then brought back.

St. Regis is a chain hotel, and the service is definitely not as detailed as Arokhamba. So you can choose according to your needs. It depends on yourself.
The two hotels are not far away, so you can experience them both.

msg:A super five-star experience! I will definitely come again next time!
I hurriedly came to Lhasa for one night and fell in love with Arro Khampa at first sight, mainly because it had just opened and I liked the hotel style. After arriving, I found that I really made the right choice.
First of all, for a cleanliness freak, there are three special places here: 1) All washing and care products are disposable and can be taken away without opening; 2) Towels and bedding have the smell of ultraviolet disinfection, which is very reassuring; 3) The drinking water is 2L unopened mountain spring water. In addition, I like the fragrance of the hotel!
The hotel manager confirmed the arrival time with us at noon that day. Because we were delayed on the road until after 11 o'clock in the evening, the manager was waiting and came out to greet us as soon as we arrived and helped with the luggage. Here I would like to thank Qu Zha for his particularly enthusiastic service. That night, he also gave us coupons to consume at the whiskey bar. I really love it.
This is definitely the most comfortable and relaxing memory of the entire 318 journey. I will definitely come again next time I go to Lhasa!

There is 24-hour diffuse oxygen and oxygen tube nasal inhalation in the room, which is very friendly to tourists with altitude sickness. I slept with oxygen in the room, and my blood oxygen was basically normal the next day. The housekeeper was also very enthusiastic. Knowing that I had altitude sickness, he prepared oxygen bottles and glucose for me to take with me when I went out. There was also a blood oxygen meter at the front desk to test blood oxygen. I can stay here in Lhasa in the future and have fun with peace of mind. In short, the perfect facilities and thoughtful service are very satisfying and reassuring.

I slept very well every night. The floor heating, oxygen supply, large mineral water, and good night soup are very considerate, and I am not afraid of catching a cold when taking a bath.
I rested and read in the lobby bar, and everyone looked at me and poured tea. The breakfast was also delicious. It is no exaggeration to say that it was a small song.
When I encountered a room cleaning, three or four people cleaned it very carefully. I don’t mop the floor every day at home, and I was embarrassed by their seriousness.
When I left, Brother Naiza (I remember correctly after washing the meal) accompanied me to wait for the car at the door and helped me put my luggage in the car before saying goodbye.
The location is not far, but it is very quiet. There are delicious jelly, coffee shops, etc. nearby.
I am reluctant to leave! I plan to come again next time.

Aruo Kangba's design, hygiene, environment, quietness and service are all perfect!!
We checked into Aruo Kangba on New Year's Eve. As soon as we drove into the courtyard, staff began to help with parking, reversing and taking luggage. When we checked in, we were given black tea and disinfected hot towels to wipe our hands~
We were told that there would be New Year's Eve activities + fairy wands in the evening. We sat down and waited at 6:30 in the evening. There were some buffets and local staff sang and toasted barley wine. It was the first time so many people celebrated the New Year together. It was super lively! We had the local specialty radish yak beef dumpling soup that is only available once a year (forgive me for not remembering the name). There was also a lottery!!! My husband drew ******* incense, which was super lucky
The breakfast the next day was also delicious. We said happy New Year to each other on the morning of the first day of the New Year. The staff also helped to serve yak yogurt.
(I have to say that several staff members are super handsome hahahaha)
I will definitely choose this place next time I go to Tibet!

The design of the hotel is based on ******* elements + modern European style (I think so, haha). As soon as I entered the door, the butler at the front desk thoughtfully gave me towels and local sweet tea. The fatigue after getting off the plane disappeared, and my little brother helped bring the luggage into the room and put it in. Put on the oxygenator thoughtfully.
Compared to various star-rated hotels, I personally prefer to choose local design hotels. I feel that it is a thorough understanding of the concept from the manager to the employees. Aruo really conveyed this.
Special praise to the little brother who received me at that time. After leaving the hotel, he was very considerate and gave me a box of tsampa cakes for me to eat in the car (because I loved eating tsampa cakes at the front desk during my stay)
Will recommend to friends

I stayed at another famous five-star hotel (X Jiji) for two nights before. Although it was good, it felt commercialized and did not take good care of the guests from the perspective of Aroko Kamba!
Aruo Kamba adopts a simple style, but without losing the high quality. The overall feeling is very relaxing and comfortable! The people working in the hotel are very friendly. They offer ******* milk sweet tea and snacks upon check-in. It is a sincere welcome. I haven’t felt such cordial hospitality in a long time! Qingtian, the introduction makes me understand Aro Kamba better!
The room is tidy, has a good sense of space, and has everything you need! I have to mention their own bath sets, which are so fragrant and easy to use that I don’t want to buy a lot of them for home use! (Not yet on sale)
The side dishes in the restaurant are also delicious, the atmosphere of Whiskey Bar is very good, and the Mocktail is also great (even if I don’t drink)!
Every day when I wanted to go out, they never forgot to give us a bottle of water. Their cordial greetings and farewells were better than other hotels and B&Bs I have stayed in!
Norlha next to it is also not to be missed! The boss was very considerate. Originally the store was going to be closed, but knowing that I was leaving tomorrow, he also let me shop slowly. Fortunately, I got the shawl I wanted.
All in all, I will only stay here again. If my friends want to go to Lhasa, they will only recommend Arokham!

After the reservation was successful, I was eagerly waiting to land in Lhasa and check in~
It was not too early when we arrived, around 22:00 in the evening
1. First, as soon as we got off the online car-hailing service, two staff members were very enthusiastic and came to help us with our luggage. My partner and I were quite embarrassed hahaha
2. Secondly, after entering the hotel, you are first given hot towels + hot tea, and check-in is also very fast. From this point on, the experience begins~
3. After the application was completed, two staff members led the elevator upstairs and helped deliver the luggage to the room. After briefly talking about some precautions, they quickly wished good night and left hahhh
Diffuse oxygen supply in the room, no choice in comfort
The bedding is very comfortable and the bathrobe is very skin-friendly.
The bed is very comfortable, the pillows are also equipped with high and low pillows, and the coffee cups/water cups in the room are separated~
After a comfortable night's sleep, I woke up refreshed the next day.
Went downstairs for breakfast at around 9 o'clock. There was a wide range of breakfast options! That croissant is so delicious! Others are also very good! The yogurt bowl is particularly to my liking! The staff also told me that you can go to the rooftop on the 4th floor to take photos ~ the view on the 4th floor is particularly good!
Overall, I have always been satisfied from check-in to check-out.
Not only because of the good environment and strong sense of design, but also because every staff member is very enthusiastic and attentive, and every smile is touching, making people feel happy unconsciously~
Friends who are traveling to Lhasa, this is a good place to buy! Great value

msg:The "Aro Kamba Lhasa Manor", which only opened in May 2023, is my favorite treasure hotel in this trip. It has a better experience than St. Regis. I highly recommend staying here when you go to Lhasa!
1. The hotel is hidden away from the world. The enclosed residence is designed with black wood and rough cement walls. The scenery changes with each step. With light, shadow and geometric composition, the entire hotel is like an art gallery. Every angle of the room is also a painting.
2. The hardware is also very picky. The bed has a strong sense of wrapping and support, as if someone is hugging you. The yak products of the blanket and pillow are said to be the product supply line of Hermès. The woody fragrance of the toiletries is particularly pleasant and has a soothing effect. Diffused oxygen supply➕Silent humidifier. Add a glass of good night milk, it's no wonder it's hard to sleep in such a room arrangement. In the past few nights, I had trouble sleeping due to a slight high fever, so it was really a good night's sleep here.
3. The coffee restaurant bar on the first floor looks like a cafe in the afternoon. The dinner that combines ******* food elements is of high quality but at an affordable price. Afternoon tea tastings are held from time to time on the rooftop, where you can enjoy the sun and watch the Jiqu River flow by. I have to mention that there is a whiskey bar on the first floor, which is open until two in the morning. Each room comes with a free cocktail. It is a surprise to be able to drink various brands of whiskey in Lhasa.
4. "Aruo Kham" in ******* means "Come, friend". The ******* waiters were sincere and considerate. When I checked in, I guided me from the garage to the front desk to register, and brought Hada, hot towels and scented tea. They met my various requirements for posing for photos. The personal butler was as responsive as the camel bell design on the door number of the room.
5. The hotel manager is a descendant of the caravan. He has the caravan spirit of Kham men who love adventure and never give up, and has the ambition to make the hotel a landmark in Lhasa. I think it can definitely be achieved!

msg:Accommodation: Checked into the hotel at 11pm. The oxygen supply facility in the room I stayed in was not working (it was broken). I couldn’t sleep due to high reflexes, so I reported it to the hotel. At first, the hotel explained that the oxygen supply of the equipment was just like this. When the oxygen concentration is enough, it will automatically stop. For a period of time, at 2 o'clock in the morning, we were unable to sleep because the oxygen supply equipment was not supplying oxygen. The guy at the front desk was very enthusiastic to help us solve this problem: changing rooms to solve this problem. The oxygen supply equipment in the new room can be used normally, but the room type is still relatively small.
Eat: There are not many types of breakfast in the hotel, the taste is average, the milk is brewed, and there are some problems with flatulence
Service: All employees are very enthusiastic and the best thing is the service
Summary: A hotel priced at 900 yuan is not cost-effective for people who check in late after traveling out of town. You can feel the hotel's care and small details, but it does not take the guests' sleeping and eating issues into consideration. There are many very fancy devices. For people who are in urgent need of rest, it is better to ask **all Genie to help me open a certain device.

msg:I have never given a negative review and rarely reviewed it, but this place is really speechless. There is no service. The room lights are very dim. The price is 1500 and there is no ironing. Many of the lights in the room are broken and it is easy to turn on the electricity when people are talking. I went to the breakfast bar very early and the service was basically cold. Not to mention that if things are left in the hotel, they will usually be cleaned up as soon as possible. I didn’t wait until I saw the things missing, but it took several days. I called and found out that my clothes were stuffed there, so I asked for express delivery. This was a mistake. I received the express delivery and paid on collect. Is it really better to contact everyone and spend so much money and stay in a five-star hotel? You really can’t go wrong.

The yogurt and rice noodles are delicious. However, the lighting in the room is a bit dark and the shading of the curtains needs to be strengthened. The sunlight in Lhasa is very strong. , I didn’t wake up, the room was already bright, hahaha, the view on the top floor is beautiful, it’s very comfortable to sit with a cup of coffee or a cocktail in the evening. It costs about 16 yuan to take a taxi to Barkhor Street, and it takes about 20 minutes to walk back after you’re full.

msg:第一次入藏，酒店必須得選舒適些，拉薩的酒店選擇原先在阿若康巴和瑞吉之間有點猶豫，但考慮到瑞吉設施比較陳舊，加之自己對設計師酒店情有獨鍾，於是選擇了新開業的阿若康巴，果然不負所望。臨行前，估計是淡季的原因，酒店主動將房型升級成尊享大床房，房間面積非常富餘，內飾風格偏簡約法式風，同時也融入了許多藏族元素，有種將安隅和松贊相結合的感覺。入住時管家已經幫忙打開了製氧機和空調，茶几上也擺放了新鮮水果和晚安飲，非常貼心。前台的帥哥美女淳樸熱情，退房時送了我們不少新鮮的時令水果，還為我們備了一份沙拉和幾瓶礦泉水，供我們自駕途中食用。最後祝願阿若康巴生意興隆，下回來拉薩依舊會選擇它👍

丹增，我覺得長得很“丁真”，給我們製作糌粑，還有酥油茶，甜茶，還有一種用青稞喝奶做的飲料。體驗感拉滿。

晚上的鍋莊更是氣氛到位，滿滿的藏地氣息。熱情點的老闆和員工用純正的藏地歌謠和青稞酒款待每一位客人。

msg:阿若康巴，是我捨不得離開拉薩的原因之一，或者説可以佔大部分比例。來拉薩之前，最先吸引我的是它整體的風格，簡約，大方，具有現代化，甚至有一絲神祕，所以我果斷的選擇了阿若康巴，作為我這次在拉薩的歸宿。到酒店時已經是當天的傍晚，店裡的每一個人都很熱情，笑臉盈盈，讓我切實的感受到了來自西藏人民的温暖，那一刻，我已經開始有點捨不得這裏了。入住是巴旦幫我辦理的，並且貼心的幫我把行李拿到房間。很感謝丹巴，記得我來之前想要一個稍微大一點的房型的小要求，並在有空餘房間的情況下，幫我整理東西，替我安置，也在後來的幾天，向我問候，詢問關於酒店的感受與建議。我很喜歡每天出門時與大家問好，回來時大家又會説一句“回來啦”，像在家一樣，家裡的每一個人都是樸實的，真誠的。我更加的不捨，不捨得阿若康巴，不捨得這裏的每一個人。酒店的餐飲做的很好，對玉珍印象很深刻，她是一個不怎麼説話，但是是很樸實善良的女孩。氂牛肉炒飯特別推薦，本來沒有報很大期望，但是卻出乎意料的好吃，以及土雞湯和氂牛肉火鍋。房間的環境很好，設備很齊全，有供氧機和加濕器，整體乾淨整潔。管家益西也會很及時的對我的要求作出整改和迴應。每天下午都會有銀耳湯或者小湯圓送到房間，四樓有很大的陽台，可以喝茶，看風景，每天出門前，都會去陽台看一眼，這也是讓我更加喜歡這裏的原因之一。臨走的時候，丹巴把我送到了門口，還贈送了我一盒藏香。我會想你們的，一定會再見的，希望你們越做越好，不忘初心，繼續進步，被更多人看到和喜歡，扎西德勒。

瑞吉，松贊，州際等比較有名的酒店都住過~
	
瑞吉，松贊雖然品質都不錯，但是因為開業年份比較早，設施已經相對陳舊了~
	
阿若康巴是去年開業的，業主第一家酒店在香格里拉，作為馬幫的後代，以冒險家精神來詮釋酒店理念。耗時三年、耗資超過四千萬、總面積2800平，即使面對疫情、環境、設計創新上的諸多不確定性，依然選擇如同祖輩一般勇往直前邁出第一步、勇敢面對未知的結局。
	
酒店以深沉的情感，用設計語言表達對
茶馬古道沿線多元文化的致敬。
	
為復原打造現代版的-阿嘎士，找遍藏區各種石頭
骨料，最終以水磨石糅合士 黃色色粉形成阿嘎質感的地面。受到昌都鹽井天主教堂的啟發，廊道中的彩色玻璃小窗折射出五彩璀讀的光芒。挑檐上鋪貼的巖石板，是一塊塊從山南尋找的，纖波濃點，錯落其間。
	
酒店軟裝上時常可見精緻的皮藝元茶，牽絆起對於遊收生活的想象。
	
還選用了諾樂的產品作為床品及一些軟裝，沐浴的備品也是藏地本地品牌，酒店裡還有有咖啡廳，威士忌吧。除了非常好的軟硬設施以外，工作人員服務的熱情細緻程度，也都是頂級的，在酒店裡感受到了拉薩的暖冬!

房間配有24小時供氧以及加濕器。
丹巴經理的服務以及熱情讓我印象深刻！讓我實質的感覺到賓至如歸的感覺！
酒店樓頂有免費的下午茶 風景很好 一樓有威士忌吧 住客也有免費的雞尾酒可以享用  威士忌吧的裝修讓我感覺這裏不像是在西藏！
總之，這是一間品質非常非常好的酒店，來拉薩絕對值得來入住！

入住的有點早，房間沒有打掃出來，管家帶着我在酒店了轉了轉，去了頂樓的露台，風景不錯，邊曬太陽邊喝喝咖啡還是不錯的。一樓還有小酒吧，這次沒有時間體驗一下，留着下一次吧☺️
房型升級了，很開心～
第一天早上沒醒來，管家幫忙把早餐送到了房間，第二天要趕飛機也是送到了房間，早餐很豐盛，好吃～
酒店門口的咖啡店也不錯哦，咖啡館再往前走有一家茶館，很有當地的特色，買一杯咖啡，喝一點甜茶，曬曬太陽，完美～

小缺點：早餐選擇較少，不太豐富，勝在服務還不錯。房間mini bar衹有雪碧可樂，在這個價位上有點不應該了。
總之，推薦給大家。

可能是淡季，或許是民宿的原因，早餐的選擇不是很多，但也很豐富了。

酒店附近有一家需要排隊和本地人擠在一間沒窗的小屋子裡吃的小吃店。
也有讓人一秒回杭州的麪包咖啡店，店名還叫西子。
然後酒店是柯布西耶藏式哈哈哈帶的飯店可以吃泰國菜。
酒店樓下有唯一的一家諾樂專賣店。
還有稍微多走幾步有個清蒸寺周邊是個菜場有新疆人賣又好吃又便宜的水果。
很喜歡這家酒店，讓人感受到了想象不到的多元拉薩。

衞生：入住的時間比較早房間還沒有打掃出來，打掃好後負責人會再檢查一遍，確認沒有問題再讓我入住。很細心嚴謹，公共場所的地毯需要加強吸塵。￼穿拖鞋去大廳取外賣的時候回來發現有一團頭髮應該不是房間裏的，想了想，可能會是大廳的地毯上。

服務：服務很熱情，會很細緻周到的詢問你的用餐需要和是否前一天休息的好不好房間會不會有什麼問題帶來不愉快的入住體驗？感覺最淳樸，￼最細心的藏族小夥都加入了阿若康巴。￼真的沒有想到藏族的小夥子説話這麼輕聲細語慢條斯理。走的時候，會幫忙把行李送到門口，當時我東西落了回房間找 行李就在路邊。沒想到走掉的服務生一直站在我的行李邊。還很抱歉的跟我講忘記給我拿水了所以他剛才放下行李就走開了。正常會一直陪客人等到車來。

早餐:比較簡單，但也能理解。因為可入住人數在那多了也真的用不掉。咖啡確實有待提高。但可以再精剪一下 ，數量不多但質量提升的空間還是有的

我來説説美中不足：

1. 餐飲：廚師泰國菜做的非常好，不輸一線城市泰餐廳。但是，客人來拉薩，多多少少想要體驗一下本地餐食，氂牛肉、藏豬、松茸、酥油茶、這些特色都是沒有的，希望可以增添項目。

2. 供氧系統感覺不太行。房間裏面的供養設備很小，且需半夜起來換水，水多會噴出來，水少則需要不停的加水，這很苦惱。

3. 衞生方面， 由於剛剛開業就遇到了旺季，所以保潔人手不太夠，不退房的客人需要等到下午五點多才能打掃衞生，房間內的一些細節也沒有做的很好。

我仍然給了滿分，因為相信這些細微的不足，都會在運營中慢慢改進！期待下次見面！

服務：最值得肯定的是酒店的服務。從經理到服務生都很熱情。每天晚上準時送上薑茶和熱牛奶。👍

説一個缺點。我們的房間在一樓，距離餐廳和前台都很近，很方便。但是，隔音稍微差了一點。入住的第二晚半夜12點過還有人在外面大聲喧嘩。第二天早上也是很早就聽見拖凳子的聲音。

不管怎樣，這都是此行最棒的酒店了。

msg:首先先要説明，這家酒店的服務確實非常好，如果單説服務，我覺得打到五分是沒有任何問題的，但很可惜，酒店雖然很漂亮，服務很好，但確實有一些很硬的問題，不吐不快。
我是在小紅書上看到阿若康巴的，因為母親已經年過六十歲，第一次進藏，我希望給她最好的體驗，也因此，哪怕暑期的房價非常昂貴，我仍然因為酒店漂亮安靜的氛圍來到了這裏，本以為會度過非常舒適寧靜的兩個夜晚，但就在入住酒店的當晚，酒店房間的窗簾故障，無法遮光，這導致睡眠很差的母親和我有了一些疑慮，然而在最開始，我們因為十分滿意房間陳設沒有要求換房，而是要求修理，卻沒想到一系列的問題由此開始。
在這裏感謝管家和前台，確實盡力了，但可惜，硬件的問題壞了就是壞了，無法修好的情況下，管家提出要換房，而因為我和母親睡眠的問題，我希望能換一間同等的標準間，管家提出，讓我們搬去一樓。
換房時已經晚上十一點了，我和母親舟車勞頓，衹想趕緊休息，於是並未多想，然而，一樓的房間雖然與原房間設施類似，但朝向很陰，房間很潮，同時，還因為拉薩連日的陰雨味道很大，母親罹患哮喘，對此非常敏感，轉了一圈後更是發現衞生間裏有極大煙味（我訂房時為了母親的身體特意選擇的禁煙酒店），失望之餘母親因為第二天還有羊湖的行程，不願意再折騰，萬般無奈下打開門窗通風，結果，陰冷的房間以及夜晚的寒風讓母親受涼，第二天便開始嗓子疼，更是在後一日發燒到了接近38度，為此不得不取消了觀看文成公主的行程。
事情至此，我可以説我和母親都是純粹的受害者，我不知為何剛開業不久的酒店會有如此大的硬件問題，更不知為何酒店的工作人員不曾注意到房間的硬件問題，難道要每個客人進入房間後都一一檢查不成？
對於阿若康巴的設計，我必須要給與肯定，但是，不可否認的是，漂亮的設計背後卻有很多花哨但卻不實用的“巧思”，諸如酒店的燈光非常昏暗，一旦朝向不好，房間便一片昏黑，甚至無法找東西；浴室裏沒有任何熱風，房間面積一大，空調無法達到浴室，客人因為擔心着涼甚至不敢洗澡；製氧機和加濕器的續航能力很弱，開到半夜關閉，直接導致次日一早客人的不適加重……漂亮不是不實用的遮羞布，漂亮的酒店的確會吸引目光，但是在拉薩這個高原上的城市，如果無法讓客人好好休息，住得舒適，酒店註定是走不遠的。
最後，我還是要強調，酒店的服務是很好的，但是，如果服務不能發生在問題之前，那麼，再好的服務也彌補不了客人的失望。
我和母親來了西藏十四天，從林芝到拉薩，住了七八個酒店，但我可以説，阿若康巴，是其中最讓我失望的一家。
酒店本身是為了讓人好好睡覺的，光漂亮還不夠，希望你們能搞明白這一點。

3、半夜高反，好辛苦才叫來服務員，而且沒有提供吸氧管，還要提醒才懂拿氧氣瓶來。瑞吉直接有醫務室，配套真完善
4、暖氣不足冷的要死，叫了兩個管家來才行，這個在備房的時候不應該發生的問題
5、晚餐，早餐還行，但一羣服務員看着我一個吃飯，好尷尬

msg:在拉薩連住五天的酒店，真的是設計戳中我❤

🚞出發前翻遍了拉薩市區的酒店和民宿
不是價格高的離譜，就是環境很差
傳統的酒店不是我個人喜歡的風格
刷🍠發現的這家阿若康巴·拉薩莊園
簡約的設計完全被拿捏的剛好
大床房雖然不大，但是極致舒適！
供氧+空調+舒適的床品+品質的浴巾+加濕器
💁🏻♂️管家式服務，真的非常👍🏻
原本訂的三天，又續住兩日！
	
⭐一層有酒吧（外地來有高反就別喝了）
⭐有自己的餐廳（房費中帶每日早餐）
⭐頂樓有露台下午茶
⭐天井是一個🌈彩虹拼磚，拍照超美

msg:如果有顧客和我一樣，因為高反而很容易有的煩躁，歸咎肉眼可見的最近因，對酒店給出這個原因的否定的話，或許可以把評價週期拉得再長一些。我因為住了頭暈不想見人，搬去松贊，依然……躺了一週才爬起來，乖乖下高原了。

對我個人而言也是打破認知的——

事實上，作為酒店試運營期間套房接待的首批自訂散客之一、對拉薩完全陌生、處於高反不適狀態下的東南沿海遊客，我的入住應該給處在試運營期的酒店帶來了挑戰，然而從經理到前台、餐廳的整個團隊提供了他們真實的誠意。

特別感謝接待入住以及最後送行的管家益西（希望沒記錯這位員工的名字），全程保持了妥帖、不失熱情的迴應。

這些是讓我在幾個月後的今天，想起來，依然感到温暖的。

原來，綜合了地理位置、建築、器皿等等物理要件，以及，讓這些靜默的東西活起來的人，所構成的整體，方為完整體驗。在高反導致“休息好”“吃好”這兩項我曾以為是良好住宿體驗必備項被打破，個人離開時也依然處於不適狀態的情況下，“人”這一項要素的作用，會在時光拉開後，展露奇妙的光芒。

這可能也是莊園的含義：它是一些人的家，一些人為之工作、養活家人，一些人在客旅途中能通過交易，得到家人般的包容與支持。為顧客環節能感受到的温暖提供熱源的，或許是對家人的愛，而推己及人。開疆拓土的戰鬥力源於希望家人能有安寧，而漫漫長途完成的茶、馬、布、器的交易，也把生產地和消費地的人連在了一起，各自得到所需，能活下去。這條路，在地理上，在歷史上，而這股精神脈絡，其實從沒有消失過。我在這家酒店的短暫停留裏，這裏的人，他們的心，讓我觸碰到了這種力量。
