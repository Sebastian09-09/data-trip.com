msg:There are many beautiful hotels in Shenhzen, but don't let the exterior or interior photos fool you. I have stayed in many of them, but this Courtyard by Marriott Shenzhen Northwest Hotel is one of the best. So why am I writing this review? Well, because starting with the most incredibly friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable staff working here, from the front door man to the reception area and the cleaning crew, everyone was incredible, and they made my stay in Shenhzen so wonderful. This hotel is top-notch and kept super clean. Room pricing is well below the market compared to any five-star hotel.

msg:I recently stayed at the Marriott hotel and I must say that it was an excellent experience. The hotel is located in a convenient location, close to many popular attractions and amenities. The lobby area is spacious and well-lit, with comfortable seating and a modern decor that creates a welcoming atmosphere.

The room itself was spacious and beautifully decorated, with comfortable beds and soft linens that provided a great night's sleep. The amenities provided in the room were also top-notch, including a flat-screen TV, Wi-Fi, a minibar, and a coffee maker. The bathroom was clean and well-maintained, with plenty of towels and toiletries provided.

The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating, always willing to help with any requests or questions. They were knowledgeable about the local area and provided great recommendations for restaurants and activities.

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's restaurant, which served delicious and well-presented meals. The breakfast buffet was particularly impressive, with a wide range of options to suit all tastes and dietary requirements.

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with my stay at the Marriott hotel. The hotel provided a great combination of comfort, convenience, and luxury, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-notch hotel experience.

I am very satisfied with her enthusiastic and positive attitude in solving problems. Coco and the front desk service are also great. It can be called JW Marriott.
First: The room is clean and the bedding is clean, and the facilities and equipment are well maintained; second: The room facing the road arranged for me has a good view, the room is not noisy, and the Mucha camp is downstairs. I can rest and relax with my colleagues at night; third: The transportation near the hotel is very convenient, close to the airport, and it is very convenient to shop and eat next to it. The hotel has brunch at a very affordable price, which is worth the money. Thank you very much for Coco's help at the end

The hardware has been well maintained for five years, and I heard that the bedding has been replaced recently. The lounge was actually open in the morning. Although it was self-service in the morning, it was enough to get a cup of coffee. I was even more satisfied with the service of Lacey at the front desk. She spoke very friendly and introduced a lot of information about the hotel. I have stayed in many Courtyard hotels, but this is the first time I have had such an experience. I will stay here again next time I come to Shenzhen

In addition, the quality of the executive suite I booked was not as expected. The air-conditioning system made serious noise. After changing rooms, the quality of the original room dropped significantly. Brown rusty water came out of the water pipe in the bathtub. There were three of us traveling together and we wanted to add an extra bed but this service was not available. In short, all services are not in place. I expect to be compensated.

I like the design of a small casual reception area in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows. The bathroom is cleverly designed to be semi-open, making the room very transparent. Executive rooms also have walk-in closets.
Hygiene: Hygiene is very good, no dust is seen. There is slippery scale on the floor of the shower room, and the elderly and children may easily fall if they are not careful. Wish it could be cleaned with a brush.
Environment: The hotel is located next to the shopping mall, which is quite convenient. It’s not easy to take a taxi during the Chinese New Year.
Service: The service staff are quite enthusiastic, especially the room attendants. Before I went out on the first day, I hung a do not disturb sign on the door. When I came back, I saw a special card reminding me that I could ask them to clean the room later. Very thoughtful.

I would like to make a suggestion to the service staff. Courtyard is a brand owned by Marriott. Please improve the corresponding standardized service skills.

msg:There are several aspects of the hotel that need attention
1. The water after bathing in the bathroom will seep into the bathroom
,￼Due to the lighting problem, I almost went to the toilet at night
slipped on the ground

2. It is acceptable for the hotel to restrict the takeaway staff from delivering food to the room for safety reasons, but the food delivery robot used by the hotel cannot handle the load during peak hours
The number of takeaways is shown in the attached picture 2. As a result, the takeaway drinks have been delivered to the hotel but have not been delivered to the room for a long time. If the deliveryman said that the robot can’t afford so many orders, I don’t know that my takeaway is blowing￼ , the hotel also did not arrange manpower to contact the room guests to pick it up in the lobby, resulting in the takeaway being left cold

3. During the buffet dinner, there were a lot of guests bringing children into the venue. Those children were constantly making noise, but no staff stepped forward to mediate, so that the food was messed up￼.

4. The hotel cooperates with Tongtai Group, but they have not reached a consensus with the Tongtai shopping mall downstairs. At night, the open-air part of the shopping mall bar emits very loud electronic sounds until 12 o'clock in the evening, which greatly affects the rest

5. The elevator often cancels the floor that has been pressed for no reason, resulting in constant ups and downs

6. On the 3A floor, there are often a lot of non-interns and other people making noise, which greatly affects the experience of the hotel

7. The sound insulation of the hotel is average, and the sound of flushing the toilet upstairs can be heard at night

msg:The lady at the front desk who checked in was very professional and enthusiastic. The only really bad thing was that I called the front desk in the guest room at 7:30 pm. Since I didn’t make a reservation in advance, I asked if there would be dinner. I got a reply saying that if I didn’t make a reservation, I might not be able to have dinner. I continued to ask what time there would be availability, and the front desk replied : Please come down and ask the restaurant depar**ent for details. So I went to the restaurant and there were plenty of empty seats. I would like to ask if the housekeeping depar**ent and the food and beverage depar**ent of your hotel are run independently?

msg:After comparing many hotels, I chose Courtyard by Marriott. The transportation of the hotel is very convenient, close to Fuyong Station of Metro Line 11. Take the subway from Bao'an Airport and get off at Fuyong after two stops, then walk out from Exit A and walk for 10 minutes to reach the hotel. It is very convenient for passengers with little dry luggage. If you take a taxi from the airport, it will take half an hour. Next to the hotel is the Tongtai shopping mall, which is very convenient for eating and shopping. The hotel room is very large, at least the hardware here is obviously better than other Courtyard hotels in China. The only drawback is that it is close to the airport and you can hear the noise of planes passing by from 6:00 am to 11:00 pm. Breakfast is on the third floor of the hotel, western style buffet. There are many kinds of options, and there are dishes such as oa**eal and smoked salmon that are not common in similar hotels. Finally, I would like to thank Jay and Matthew for their professional services during their stay.

The room is still great, simple design, and practical in all aspects. The breakfast is very rich, meat, eggs, milk and vegetables, Chinese and Western-style buns, whole grains, tea, coffee, all kinds of Drinks, everything. The fly in the oin**ent is that there are no windows in the breakfast room and the gym. It feels a little depressing. The hygiene of the gym is neglected. There is a bottle of mineral water that the previous guest should open and drink and put it back in place, no. After careful inspection, I couldn't tell, but I took it by mistake. Fortunately, I didn't drink it. It was a little disgusting. I am a bit clean. I hope the hotel will pay attention to it later.

Moreover, there are shopping malls around the hotel, which are convenient for eating, drinking and playing, with rich supporting facilities.

The management is really speechless. I told us to arrange a double room first. I booked a suite. Then let us go to the double room to rest. We changed our suite, and then the toilet was not temperature-controlled, but it was very cold. Is this a package for a suite? The hair dryer is really the funniest, and we have to keep pressing it. Let’s not say the brand. I The four-star hotel doesn’t use such a hair dryer, and the toothbrush is hard. This hotel is really not good at all. I knew I had chosen the Hilton next to it. I took this hotel. We stayed for 2 nights and there was only one fruit. This is really speechless. The room contains administrative trea**ent. No one told you when you checked in at the front desk.

The glass door of the bathroom did not fall heavily on the floor of the bathroom, but my hand was injured, and it hurt so much. I called the front desk, the line was busy, and then I called again, and the line was busy, and then I called...Dial the outside line The switchboard, no one answered... After a good rest, my hands don't hurt so much, I think that's it for this matter... The next day I flew to the place I arrived, But the hand was still aching, so I went to the hospital for an examination. It was really injured, and I asked to rest for 21 days.
During the nearly one-month break, it seriously affected my work and daily life.
It’s been a few months, and the hotel has not offered a sincere apology, nor paid my medical bills, nor paid my lost wages.
