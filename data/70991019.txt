We were so pleased with this hotel facility. Will definitely pick Langbo again whenever here for the great service and location to the Taikoo Li and other place of interests. Breakfast spread is really great with a 38 floor view of the city. Perfect stay.

msg:The hardware is good but more can be done from service standpoint as well as offerings. Room was hot and while they promptly provided a fan, the noise from the fan greatly lowered the comfort of the room. Welcome fruits did not look fresh and indeed looked like the farthest thing from a 'Welcome'. Minibar drinks included nothing but sugary can drinks that are obviously cheap and mediocre for such an establishment. I found a hair in the notebook left on the side table next to the bed. The hair was still there after staying 5 nights. Breakfast was a complete mess and disaster - coffee machine was down and there was a shortage of milk for a while. Restaurant staff were unapologetic about the situation which is completely baffling. Kudos have to be given to the restaurant manager who apologised profusely and tried to make amends but alas, in the overall scheme of things, it would take so much more to save this sinking ship of a hotel.

msg:Facilities: Very satisfied. I have never stayed in a Hyatt series hotel before. I am very satisfied with this experience. I originally planned to stay for one day to go to the Ritz, but ended up extending it for another day. The amenity used in the room is Fummar, which tastes great. Among many hotels in this price range, this one is the most satisfactory!

Hygiene: There is a slight problem. Pay more attention to the sink and bathtub, but the hotel is equipped with disposable bathtub covers.

Environment: The fragrance in the lobby is also very good, the comfort of the bedding is also very good, and the overall atmosphere of the hotel is quite good.

Service: Langpo, The Hyatt Collection is the best hotel I have stayed in in Chengdu. I am very satisfied with everything from the concierge to the front desk to the cleaning. In particular, the service attitude of the young man and young lady at the front desk is very good, and there are no negative reviews like those online. On the first day when I arrived, I waited for a while and the room was not available, so I immediately arranged for a room upgrade. When I asked about the room type the next day and planned to extend my stay, the operator also told me that I could extend my stay at the original price. Thank you very much!
Hyatt Regency Langpo is the most satisfying place during this trip to Chengdu, and it is highly recommended to stay here.

There is a feeling of blood awakening
It's like watching "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms" again
A guqin played the empty city plan
A gentle breeze blew a straw boat to borrow arrows
A negotiation ushered in a one-man club
Come to Chengdu
no
"Every station has its troops and horses at a hundred paces, but the general is asked to use his sword alone."
But a melodious Guqin song
But the people who heard it were heartbroken
Respect to the dedicated "Wuhou"
A high-speed rail ticket of 263 yuan from Xi'an to Chengdu
This respect
It is wisdom, courage, broadmindedness, monarch and minister...
so
Zhuge Liang carries too many concrete qualities
So much so that I gain qualitative insights every time I read "Three Kingdoms"
At that time, the portraits of ministers and ministers
But Wuhou is the reference that remains standing
Just like every time I stay at other hotels
Chengdu Langpo will be used as a reference for service
Influential figures under the mirror of history
The moment I stepped into the hotel lobby, it was pouring in
I have to thank Crystal for the excellent service every time
Thank you for giving me the carefully prepared bookmarks
Every time, we will arrange a few more bottles of water for the room.
And a quilt that I never have to hem.
The room was very comfortable…
This hotel is worth staying at

First of all, the location is very good, surrounded by the bustling Chunxi Road, close to the IFC, and it is very convenient for eating, playing and traveling. The hotel rooms are located above the 38th floor, and the lobby and restaurant bar are located on the 38th floor.
Second, the rooms are cost-effective. The floor is high, the view is very good, the room is also large, and the facilities are complete. The children's bathing supplies are the Little Prince's, and I love it. On the first day of check-in, there are welcome fruits, and the drinks in the small refrigerator and the snacks in the cabinet next to it are also free.
Third, the breakfast is rich, the yogurt is Jane Eyre and Kashi, there are Dandan noodles, egg cakes, and ice powder is free.
Fourth, this time the child lost his schoolbag, and the front desk staff has been very patient to help us find it for more than an hour, check the surveillance, and help us open the room again to find it, so there is no impatience for delaying the check-out.
Finally, it is the service. Because we brought many children and a lot of luggage this time, we have been provided with considerate service during the check-in process.

msg:Facilities: The hotel room is large, with a large dining table for takeout, which is very convenient. The first round of the minibar is free, and there are free snacks. It is worth mentioning that my father felt unwell during the journey, and he took the initiative to prepare an electronic blood pressure monitor for us after reporting to the guest service supervisor Congcong. Thank you very much!

Hygiene: The room is clean and the aunt cleans it carefully every day, makes the bed, and folds pajamas.

Environment: It is surrounded by Taikoo Li and Chunxi Road, which is very convenient for eating hot pot and buying specialties.

Service: The exclusive butler Congcong added WeChat several days in advance. Not only did he ask about our stay experience at any time, but he also recommended a lot of local food. He is really attentive! I wish you all the best in your work!

msg:The hotel is very lively in the city center. The hotel is on a small road very close to Taikoo Li Commercial Street. It is also very convenient to get there. It is a quiet place in the bustle. This time I missed the peak period and returned to the Langpo Hotel. I was very happy to meet Kevin at the front desk again. He had already arranged a room for me early. Knowing that I was afraid of the heat, he turned on the air conditioner in the room in advance. They helped me put 2 bottles of mineral water in the small refrigerator to freeze. These small details are enough to make me want to come back and stay again. Everyone at the front desk and Kevin are also very energetic, and the pins on their chests are also very unique. Why not come back to experience it again with such a high-quality service team? The room facilities are very new, and the high floor facing Taikoo Li The room is also very beautiful at night. I sit on the sofa close to the window and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Chengdu. They also helped me store my luggage and check out quickly when I checked out. If I have a chance to come back next time, I will definitely choose Hyatt Hotel!

msg:The experience of staying at the Chengdu Langpo Hotel, a Hyatt Collection hotel was great! Every step from check-in to check-out was very smooth, which left me with a great impression of this hotel.

What deserves special praise is the front desk service. Kevin, the front desk manager, left a deep impression on me. His warm and considerate service attitude and professionalism demonstrate the high quality of this hotel. When checking in, Kevin patiently explained to me the use of various facilities and proactively provided many practical suggestions to help me plan my trip better. When checking out, he also took the initiative to handle the express check-out procedure for me, making the entire check-out process very smooth.

He always considers issues from the guest's perspective and does his best to provide guests with considerate and thoughtful service. This professional and friendly service attitude makes me highly appreciate the management team of this hotel.

Overall, this stay was a perfect experience. I was deeply impressed by the hotel's high-quality facilities, complete supporting facilities, and professional and thoughtful service. As a well-known high-end hotel in Chengdu, Hyatt Regency Langpo is undoubtedly the best choice for business and leisure travel. I will recommend this hotel to my friends without hesitation.

Also, after entering the room, the luggage was not delivered for 3/40 minutes, which was quite depressing. Other aspects were good, and the location was also very convenient, near Taikoo Li.

The indoor temperature is 25 or 26 degrees, and the outdoor temperature is only 18 degrees at almost noon. It's too hot to sleep. It's also booked for two days. It's useless to find a hotel. They just said that the air conditioner outlet temperature is fine. I really suggest that the hotel pay attention to the air conditioner problem. In a five-star hotel, the air conditioner is set to the lowest temperature and the maximum wind for at least ten hours in a row, and the temperature can't be lowered. The room is not big. Isn't it a problem? ! There are no other problems. The service attitude of the hotel doorman and room cleaning is also very good.

msg:This hotel seems to be a hotel in cooperation with Kaiyue
Overall, I think this hotel is well-made on the outside, but the details are very poor.

First of all, let’s talk about the location. The location is pretty good, close to Chunxi Road in Taikoo Li, about 700 meters walk. The hotel has a high floor, but the view from a distance is average, which is a bit of a waste of floors. What you can see outside the window is residential areas and a few high-rise buildings.
Secondly, facilities, when we checked in, we chose to upgrade to a large suite at our own expense based on our optimism about the hotel. A small suite of 60 square meters can be upgraded to a large suite of about 120 square meters. In terms of layout, the large suite has a large entrance hall, which is actually a waste. All the facilities in the room are very advanced and new. It can be seen that the hotel is moving in the avant-garde direction.
But we encountered several problems: 1. The welcome fruits provided by the hotel were of very low quality and were not worthy of the price of a 120 suite.
                    2. This is also the most serious problem. The air conditioner in the hotel room cannot turn on the temperature and it is very cold. We originally checked in late on the first night. Then I found that it was very cold to sleep at night. When we entered the room at 9.30 pm, the indoor temperature was 17 degrees. When we went to bed around 12 o'clock, the indoor temperature was 19 degrees (and because it was too cold, we closed the bedroom door, but the temperature in the hall was still the same. is 18 degrees).
                    3. I couldn’t bear it anymore and called the hotel around 12:30. I hope the maintenance man will take a look and bring another quilt (in fact, I also feel that it cannot be repaired so late). After two more urging calls, the technician finally came. The first technician came to measure the air outlet temperature and said it was normal. He said that the room might be too big and the air conditioner could not be turned on. Sure enough, there was nothing that could be done. In fact, when the master told me this reason at the time, I couldn't accept it, because the room size should be taken into consideration when designing the HVAC. There is no such thing as a room that is too big to be installed. But this was expected. Later, the master gave us a heater, and then another person gave us a quilt. This is also my first experience that in a five-star hotel, the best room type requires heating and two thick quilts. Later in the morning, the temperature in the master bedroom barely rose to 22 degrees. The reason why I mention this separately is because later I found out that these two masters rolled their eyes at us before they came in to repair and deliver things, and then they rolled their eyes at us again before going out. To be honest, it's really not too cold, and I wouldn't be tempted to call someone over. It’s not easy for everyone, being a service worker. Even the most basic things can't be done.
                    4. By the way, when the master came to see the air conditioner, we told him that the toilet door should be pulled from the outside. But now I have to push it inward, which affects going to the toilet a bit. We asked the master to take a look. The master looked at it for 2 seconds and told us that it didn't affect anything. It was fine, and left. It was true that it had little impact, but we fixed it ourselves the next day. In fact, it's very simple, it's just a matter of moving the *****. The master was unwilling to move. Moreover, after it was repaired, the same problem occurred again, which also showed that the door was poorly designed.
                    5. When I woke up the next morning and had breakfast, I found that the waiter inside was exactly the same as the previous chef. It feels like you owe him money. He is very dull, cold and a bit fierce.
Finally, to sum up, the hotel's front desk security staff are very enthusiastic to the outside world, but the internal details of the waiters and maintenance staff are a mess. The hotel should really pay attention to the details, otherwise it will lose points.

msg:I brought my children to Chengdu this New Year's Day and booked two hotels. I must praise the Hyatt Select service👍🏻The front desk was very enthusiastic and gave us a bear doll in the package. Since we have two children, they gave us two.
The hotel overall looks new. The front desk is on the 38th floor, and you need to take another elevator to get to the guest rooms. The arranged room is on the 50th floor, which is very quiet. The twin room is quite spacious, but the 1.35 bed is a bit crowded with one large bed and one small bed. The bathroom is all Kohler, with a bathtub and a display cabinet next to the shower that can be used to store clothes, which is very convenient. The toiletries and care products are all from Fumar, which are pretty good. The toilet and bathroom are separate rooms. There is a separate small cloakroom where suitcases can be placed. The whole room design is relatively reasonable.
The hotel's room service is also very fast. I asked for a few extra bottles of water and a box came directly. Fruit was delivered in the evening. Drinks in the minibar are free🆓.
Breakfast is on the 38th floor, and there are more people in the morning. The food tastes good and there are many choices. The package includes breakfast for two people, and we have two children at no additional charge.
The location of the hotel is also good, it is more than ten minutes away from Taikoo Li ifs.
We checked in on the night of 12.31, and happened to participate in the countdown event on the 63rd floor apron on the top floor of the hotel. The a**osphere was good and very memorable.
I must recommend the Hyatt Collection, it’s really good👌🏻I will still choose this hotel when I come to Chengdu in the future.

The lady at the front desk gave me a drink coupon and upgraded me to a suite for free. The environment is very good and you can see Taikoo Li. , it only took a few minutes to walk there. Because I didn’t want to move around with my luggage, I went to the front desk to discuss whether I could extend my stay in the original room. The front desk said no, so I thought about it. I could stay in a few more hotels. Later, I found another young lady at the front desk and she said I could extend my stay in the same room. I extended my stay for two more days and then gave me a mini bar and breakfast. The next day, the other lady also gave me a mini bar. Panda and Snacks, Sun Wenjia and Fang Xin are two kind-hearted young ladies.

Xiaoyu at the front desk (a very gentle girl wearing glasses) arranged a room on the 52nd floor. I was very satisfied ~ It’s just a few hundred meters walk from Taikoo Li. I’m tired of going out every day, so I came back The room instantly felt very relaxing. On the last day, the temperature in Chengdu cooled down, so I stayed in the hotel and took a dip in the swimming pool in the afternoon. The children were very happy. The room is not particularly big but well laid out, comfortable and quiet. The hotel lobby is on the 38th floor. After checking in, you need to take another elevator to your room.
Minibar first round of all-you-can-drink: The minibar has coffee, tea, and snacks.
Next time I come to Chengdu, my first choice is Hyatt!

During the Spring Festival, I took my baby to stay at the Langpo Hotel in Chengdu. I deeply felt that this was an unforgettable and surprising accommodation experience.

First of all, the hotel's geographical location is extremely advantageous. It is located in the bustling center of Chengdu and has complete supporting facilities nearby. It is extremely convenient for traveling and tasting authentic food. The hotel itself is quiet in the bustle, providing guests with a comfortable and tranquil environment.

The design concept of Langpo Hotel is unique and artistic, perfectly integrating modern simplicity and Western Sichuan culture, with every detail demonstrating ingenuity. The guest rooms are spacious and bright, elegantly and exquisitely decorated, and fully equipped with all facilities, especially the soft and comfortable bed, allowing people to enjoy a high-quality sleep after a tiring day of travel.

In terms of service, Langpo Hotel has achieved the ultimate. The reception staff at the front desk are warm and friendly, and the check-in procedure is efficient and fast; the room attendants are attentive and thoughtful, and the daily room cleaning is meticulous. In addition, the hotel also provides a variety of breakfast options to meet the needs of different tastes, especially those authentic Sichuan snacks, which made me a full meal.

Overall, Chengdu Langpo Hotel left a deep impression on me with its excellent location, excellent facilities, considerate service and strong cultural a**osphere. It was an excellent stay experience.

The facilities are relatively new, the rooms are spacious, and the stay experience is good. The bed is very comfortable and the hygiene is relatively clean. This time I stayed on the 48th floor and the view was pretty good. The breakfast and lobby are on the 38th floor. The breakfast variety is pretty good. There are many people and it is noisy during the Spring Festival, so there is nothing we can do about it. The service is also very good, they will help with luggage and greet you proactively 👍. It's a 10-minute walk from Taikoo Li. There is Chongqing Jianghu Cuisine Yang Jilong's House nearby (it's pretty good after eating it in Chongqing), as well as several hot pot restaurants. Overall, it's a good hotel, and the 1,300 yuan a night feels worth it!

It is a five-minute walk from Taikoo Li and a five-minute walk from Dongmen Bridge subway station.

It is good that the guest room does not require a power card. In addition, the screen projection is really good (compared to many other five-star hotels not owned by China Lodging Club). Jinjiang River can be seen outside the window. The room was also very spacious.

There is a list of free items on the bedside table. The variety is very diverse and user-friendly for a hotel in the same price range. Especially the female menstrual products provided are great! There are also free chargers.

Breakfast includes Sichuan specialty egg-baked cakes, crispy pork and some special cold dishes. There will be a long queue for breakfast at 9 o'clock on weekends. It is recommended to go early to reduce the crowds.

Combining the newness, service facilities, and price, it is highly cost-effective and recommended to stay near Taikoo Li.

The room was extremely hot and stuffy, so the final solution was to provide a noisy fan, and then, with our signature, send someone to open the window, which could only open a small crack. As a result, I couldn't sleep well for two nights. I was tossing and turning in the heat.

There is a bed surround! Little Prince toiletries are available! The toothbrush is still 🐼 shaped! Children's slippers are available! The drinking water in the room is from VOSS. Knowing that you are staying with children, I brought it directly to you and you can drink as much as you like!

The minibar is free (beer, drinks and herbal tea are all available), and the snack bar is also free! Specialty beef and peanut cakes are all available!

The room was much cleaner than I expected! The layout is very good, 44 square meters is not too small, and a dressing table and cloakroom are also planned. Although the toilet room is mini, it also has a sink, which is great! The blackout curtains are very effective in blocking light! The air conditioner has warm air. I can’t imagine Chengdu without warm air at night in this season! The scenery outside the window is particularly good!

The breakfast really exceeded expectations. I read reviews before saying that the breakfast was a mess and there was nothing to eat. However, it turned out to be much better than the breakfast in some large and well-known five-star hotels in northern cities! There are local specialties! Sichuan style noodle stalls are available! The cheese counter is particularly, very good! The juice can be freshly squeezed, and there are dedicated waiters who are constantly cutting the fruits and squeezing the juice! The waiters in the restaurant are all young but have great service awareness! The view outside the breakfast room window is also great, facing Taikoo Li!

The room was cleaned very well! It has been a long time since I stayed in a hotel and found that after cleaning the room, I folded the clothes very carefully and every cosmetic and skin care product was laid out in the same place! It's a pity that I didn't ask the names of the cleaning staff these days. They deserve real-name praise!

Finally, I must praise the candy at the front desk in real name! They coordinated the floor facing the room (because they knew we were bringing children and there was a bar on the top floor of the hotel, so they specially reserved a quiet room for us) so that we could respond. The child wanted to eat bananas, so we tried our best to get them and finally gave them as gifts. A panda for a child! She is really great!

I started recommending this Hyatt to my friends during my stay! I must stay here again when I come to Chengdu in the future!

The impression from the pre-arrival consultation was pretty good. The location is OK, but the surrounding environment of the hotel is average. It is in a small back alley and the sound insulation is average. You can hear the sound of the TV next door.
The attitude of all service depar**ents is very positive, but the service process is a bit troublesome, and six or seven WeChat accounts have been added. . . The little note was very warm, thanking Yang Nan for the guest room.

The hotel facilities are a bit old, and we don't have anything we need. I borrowed an umbrella because it rained on the day I checked in. I returned it when I came back, but I asked repeatedly when checking out instead of confirming it myself. The buffet breakfast is said to be more than 200 people, but the breakfast chefs and staff are not very friendly. They tried to take away my plate many times during the meal. Their confusing behavior made me feel uncomfortable.
Why spend money on an unpleasant experience when there are better options? I hope the hotel will strengthen its management. The above is for your reference only.

msg:I have always had a soft spot for Hyatt Hotels. After choosing Hyatt Regency Hangzhou on Ctrip in April, I chose Hyatt Regency Select Hotel in Chengdu this time. It’s great. I stayed here for my husband’s birthday and 25th silver wedding. Unforgettable memories, thanks.

Location transportation:
It's only a five-minute walk to Taikoo Li and Chunxi Road. Lan Kwai Fong Bar is also very close. It's only 600 meters away from Dongmen Bridge MRT Station. It's so convenient.

Room view:
Entering the lobby, it is very modern. When you check in on the 38th floor, you can feel the luxury and trendiness of the new hotel. Every layout is grand and designed, and you have a panoramic view of the entire market. There are hotel rooms on the 38th to 60th floors, which change at night. The prosperity is gone and the neon lights are flashing.

Room facilities and services:
We are in an executive suite. Although it is not particularly large, the living room, bedroom, bathroom and bathtub are all functionally partitioned. The hotel specially set up light *****s for us. The first day was happy birthday, and the second day was I love you. I was so full of sense of ceremony that I called us when I got back to the hotel to see if we would send a cake. The service was super considerate.

Dining room:
Breakfast is in the buffet restaurant on the 38th floor. The variety is very rich. The decoration of the entire restaurant is also very luxurious. It is of the same quality as the breakfast. The cakes and fruits are very good. They provide fresh passion fruit, kiwi fruit and grapefruit, which I love. , grapes, cantaloupe and pears. It also provides Chengdu side dishes and snacks such as Chengdu’s unique red oil noodles. It was my first time to eat freshly made egg cakes, with salty and sweet fillings. The taste was different, but it was a try.
Afternoon tea and happy hour are average, not as rich and high-quality as Hyatt Hangzhou. It may be because our executive package includes different contents. It is enjoyed on the 37th floor with four or five kinds of fruits. Afternoon tea provides tea, coffee and drinks. The happy hour provides red and white wine, which can make you full, but not good.

Swimming pool and gym:
When we checked out on the third day, we went for a walk in the swimming pool on the 6th floor. Although we didn't have time to experience it, we still went to have a look and experience. There were not many people.
Our customized high-altitude exquisite meal gave us a surprise. In addition to our stay, buffet breakfast, and this meal, we were so satisfied. Hyatt, we will meet again in the next city, and we will have a great experience every time.

Reservations cannot be made today. Two or three days in advance. Half an hour later, my husband called to make an appointment, and she said she had a room! Room service is also available!

I can clearly feel that the hotel has improved the service quality in just over three months! On the day my mother and I arrived at the hotel, we each carried two suitcases, and the taxi left us at the intersection. Before we arrived at the hotel gate, the concierge staff ran down and asked us if we wanted to stay at the hotel and took the initiative to take all the luggage. Each person carried 4 bags, and we had to give a thumbs up! Then during the check-in process, the front desk staff was also very professional and patient. Breakfast includes a variety of freshly squeezed juices, green juices, fresh fruits, and vegetable salads that I like. Of course, there are also various high-quality Chinese breakfasts, which are great! On the first night, I was noisy by the next door until I fell asleep in the middle of the night. The hotel took care of the problem and took the initiative to help me change my room to the executive floor. I also like this! The room was also very clean, I like tidiness and cleanliness.
I took my daughter back to Chengdu during the summer vacation and stayed at this hotel. The surrounding area is very convenient for eating, drinking, entertainment and transportation! I used to stay at Niccolo Niccolo at IFS, but I will stay in Langpo in the future. I hope the hotel will continue to work hard and continuously optimize its customer service!

The complimentary minibar and boat tickets are even more abundant and worthwhile than expected.

The geographical location is also a reflection of elegance, always looking at the downtown area one step away.

Happy hour buffet for two: The variety is so rich that you can eat at the pace of a day in the hotel.
Welcome fruit: two large Qiuyue pears paired with three small refreshments are exquisite and rich.
Voss, who likes to drink soda and pop, also changed all the drinks for us. Generally speaking, one-on-one service is not available, which is different from the positioning of a hotel, but the basic requirements will be met. I like egg-baked cakes and red oil cakes for breakfast~

There is a convenience store and a famous coffee shop downstairs of the hotel (suitable for coffee lovers). It takes half an hour to take a taxi to Shuangliu Airport;
The hotel's breakfast is very rich. There are fresh fruits every day. In addition to the regular ones, there are also pomegranate, passion fruit, and guava. The noodles in the flavor window are also very delicious. I recommend you to try it;
The room is large and the night view is beautiful. The first round of minibar is free. Four bottles of Sephora are provided every day. There are also welcome fruits. The most recommended thing is that the spare one is Fu Wen Erma, which is a big plus!
I will choose here again when I come to Chengdu in the future.

After handling all the items, she asked me again whether I was comfortable and happy during my trip to Chengdu. She also hoped that I would continue to stay at the hotel next time I come to Chengdu. Her work is serious and responsible, which is great.

msg:This trip was booked in a hurry. I booked a hotel the night before departure. The main considerations were the location, the new hotel, the high floor, and the quality of the Hyatt.
When I arrived, I was not disappointed. I stayed in the White Jade room on the 47th floor. The room had large floor-to-ceiling windows and a good night view. You could see Taikoo Li and Jinjiang. The room was not too small. In the next few days, I stayed in the Zundi Suite. The room was relatively large, but unfortunately the floor was relatively low, on the 41st floor (the hotel said it was possible to change, but I was too lazy to move because I had too much luggage). The location in the corner was not as good as the previous room type, and the bathroom this time was not as good as before. There is a floor-to-ceiling window, but there are also high-rise apar**ents opposite, so I don't dare to run naked.
There are a few points worth mentioning:
First, although it is not known as a parent-child hotel, it is still friendly to children overall, including the design of the table corners in the room with original corners, special toiletries and bathrobes for children, and a rich breakfast, so there is plenty for children to eat. There is also a children's area in the swimming pool. The children were very happy to enter the water for the first time and swam three times during their stay. It is recommended that children wear wading shoes, because the steps up and down are paved with small mosaics, so they are afraid of scratching their feet. In the swimming pool, children are also required to wear swimming caps and can use lifebuoys. There are not many people in the swimming pool.
Second, there is an overall sense of proactive service. Whether it is the greeting guy, the front desk, or the cleaning lady, they will take the initiative to provide some services or ask questions. For example, they will watch us holding the child and fall asleep, and take the initiative to help us pick up the backpack from the car and deliver it to the customer. Go to the room and wait. If you need anything, you can call the front desk, they will always respond.
Third, the Zundi Suite has afternoon tea in the afternoon, including some fruits, pastries and drinks, and happy houre in the evening. In addition to fruits, etc., there are also some simple meals and wine, which can make you full. It is easy to have irregular meals when traveling, so I still use it Worthy. Of course, in Chengdu, everyone still wants to eat various snacks, so even though the hotel's catering is good, we did not eat in the hotel except for breakfast.

Overall, I am quite satisfied with my stay at the hotel.

I met the children’s birthday girls (L Siqi, Xiao Tian) who were very enthusiastic and helpful. They helped us upgrade the room type and cake. The children were very happy. The auntie in the guest room is also very enthusiastic about staying for three nights and will choose this hotel when she comes back

msg:Although this is the fifth time I have come to Chengdu, this trip is with a family of 9 people, so I am still comparing and choosing hotels in downtown Chengdu. Before booking, I called the hotel to inquire about some travel arrangements and other issues. Chen Gang, the deputy concierge of the concierge depar**ent, answered my questions very enthusiastically and patiently and gave good suggestions. I would like to thank him very much. After comprehensive consideration, I booked this hotel. The housekeeper Xiaoyi in the guest service center contacted me and patiently provided us with very warm and thoughtful service throughout the whole process. I would like to thank her very much! Finally, let's talk about this hotel.
1. Good location. The hotel is near Taikoo Li, and you can walk to Taikoo Li Chunxi Road for a few minutes. Although it is not on the side of the main road, the hotel is also close to the subway entrance. It is more convenient to travel by subway or take a taxi, and there are also plenty of food in the surrounding area.
2. Good price/performance ratio. This time, we booked 5 rooms, with twin beds and double beds. After booking, I told the housekeeper Xiaoyi about our situation and hoped to arrange a nearby room. It was very convenient for Xiaoyi to arrange all of us together. Special thanks to Xiaoyi! The room is on a high floor with a nice view. The room is clean, spacious and comfortable, with good bathroom facilities. The hotel has a rich breakfast, and the dishes will change for four consecutive days, and the taste is also very good. I booked for two nights at the beginning, and I lived comfortably, so I renewed for two nights later.
3. Good service. From the concierge at the entrance on the first floor, the handsome guys in the concierge are very warm to greet and help. The housekeeper Xiaoyi served the whole process and gave a lot of help and advice, thank you very much!

Hygiene: The room is quite large, but the hygiene is not good. There are hairs from the previous guest on the sofa and in the bathroom. The child keeps coughing at night when he sleeps. It may be that the sheets are not clean and he is allergic. I stayed for four days and three nights and didn't change my bed sheets. Can't you see that the sheets are dirty?

Environment: The hotel needs to go to the 38th floor and change to the elevator before going to the room. Stayed for three nights, the house price was around 1600. This hotel is not worth the price.

msg:Unexpectedly good Dragon Boat Festival trip with family. Because it is close to Chunxi Road and Taikoo Li, I considered Grand Hyatt and Luangpo Hyatt Reserve, and finally chose Luangpo. Although it is Hyatt Reserve, it is our domestic Mingyu The company management must support domestic production, but it is really disappointing. I stayed for two nights. The first night was more than 10:00 p.m. The doorman on the first floor was playing with his mobile phone for a long time before responding. The waiter was wandering and chatting, and no one guided the coffee or tea. The next night, mineral water and bath towels needed to be delivered, and it took three calls to deliver them, half an hour before and after. On the third morning when I checked out, the business level at the front desk was poor. I have been reminded that I need to consolidate the bills after staying for two nights, but I couldn’t print out the bill after repeated operations, which wasted time. Because I was in a hurry, I asked the front desk to deduct the money. I still can’t see what the bill looks like. What's interesting is that the hotel of this level doesn't open breakfast until 7:00 in the morning. It's probably the same as Home Inn now. It's a bit of a drop in price. One more thing to mention is that there are many glass mirrors in the room, which are easy to bump into the bathroom, and the bathroom is also very small.

It can be seen that the hotel is very attentive to serving its guests. Later, I asked for extra pillows and bath towels, and they were delivered very nicely, which made me feel embarrassed to bother others. Ms. Xiaoyu is very considerate and has attentive customer service. Thumbs up!
I added an extra breakfast for my child. At that time, the restaurant said that there was a problem with the machine and could not issue an invoice. They asked me to contact the staff to help me issue it when I checked out. But when I checked out, the staff called the restaurant service staff to verify that I did not add an extra breakfast message. It feels that the communication between the two parties needs to be further improved. Anyway, some small details do not affect the overall service. Still worth recommending. The entire team is still very dedicated to serving guests.

Taikoo Li Jiuyan Bridge is within a ten-minute walk. There are many authentic delicacies in the surrounding area, especially on the opposite side of the hotel.

The design of the hotel is elegant, and the room types are regular and reasonable. Even the basic room types are spacious and comfortable, with a standard washlet toilet, and generous and high-end toiletries. It is especially worth mentioning the thoughtful and warm service. This time it is a family trip. Ms. Taylor at the front desk thoughtfully upgraded the Langyu room, which overlooks the Jinjiang River in Taikoo Li and can also enjoy the magnificent skyline view. The child likes it very much; the first time to arrange There is an extra bed and children's products, and there is no need for additional explanations if you are thoughtful. Xiao Zeng at the concierge office even prepared an electronic version of shopping and eating guides around the area, and also enthusiastically helped to provide reservation service for popular restaurants, and really experienced the feeling of being at home. In the past two years, I have stayed in many hotels in Chengdu. Considering all aspects of hardware and software, Hyatt Regency Luangpo is the best choice. No matter how picky the taste is, it may not be able to find the flaws and shortcomings. I hope to continue to develop and maintain.

Location: The hotel is on East Street, less than 10 minutes' walk from Taikoo Li, less than 15 minutes' walk from IFS, and 5 minutes' walk from Jinjiang Night Tour East Wharf. It is very convenient and not as noisy as living in Chunxi Road.

It is worth mentioning that in such a high-rise hotel, the rooms actually have windows that can be pushed out. Although the windows are not large, they can be ventilated. The only point is that I am more sensitive to light when I sleep, but the curtains in the room cannot completely block the light, there will be some light transmission between the top and the roof, so it is best to bring an eye mask if you mind.

Hygiene: The overall is good, but the bed sheet was a little stained on the first night, because I was tired and didn't want to bother, so I asked the room service staff to put a new bed sheet on it. One of the bath towels was scratched to the ground on the first day, but the rest were fine.

Service: When getting off the bus on the 1st floor, someone offered to help open the door to get luggage, press the elevator and chat with us. After checking in, the staff at the front desk offered to help introduce some nearby attractions and geographical location. The service is warm, but with a sense of boundaries. Sister Zhang Junying who cleaned the room was very considerate. We mentioned adding more water when cleaning the room for the first time. After that, she helped us fill up a lot of water every day and prepared a steam eye mask for us. It was really timely. I have prepared a small gift for the hot pot base, so thoughtful ~ I had some unpleasantness in the restaurant during the stay, but the manager on duty quickly helped to solve it, with a sincere and professional attitude.

All in all, it was a relatively satisfactory stay experience~ Although it was fully booked on May 1st, it didn't look crowded and chaotic.

msg:The hotel environment is very good. I stayed in three hotels in Chengdu Tourism. Compared with Chunxi Mercure Fuyun Mirage (too bad), this one has the best experience. The environment is a**ospheric, the decoration is tasteful, and the view outside the window is super good! Walking to Taikoo Li for 5 minutes is also acceptable...It would be better if the laundry is done faster. If you don't rush the laundry on May 1st, you can get it in the evening of the next day. The downside is that you should never go to the Chinese restaurant on the fifth floor downstairs. After eating once, I can accept the low consumption in the private room. He said that there are more people and a few side dishes cost 5,000. He can also accept the menu. I didn’t show it to me, but there are too many ingredients and I can’t finish it. The water to drink costs 88 a bottle. I am very enthusiastic. After the opening, the children stopped eating and the adults chatted. A lot of undrinked water wasted, and they almost left. I opened a bottle for you at the end. I was about to laugh. If we can afford it, it doesn't mean we have to waste food...I hope it can be improved

Lilian, the hotel customer service, asked almost every day whether she was satisfied with her stay and whether she had any questions. The check-in experience is very good, and the service is satisfactory.

The location of the hardware is excellent. But there is a little regret in the room, the sound insulation is not very good, the toilet in the bathroom is too noisy, and the child is a little scared.

But overall it is worth staying again.

It is within walking distance from Taikoo Li Chunxi Road, and it is only a few minutes away from the subway station. The hotel is on a high floor and you can see a lot of night views. The space in the hotel room is relatively large and smart. The dinner included in the set meal is also very surprising, the portion is very large, two people are very satisfied, and the waiter Wang Hai's service is also very good. It is still highly recommended as a travel option, and I hope there will be a package to choose next time.

Hygiene: The aunt cleans up very clean every day, but the mirror at the door of the bathroom is full of handprints when I first entered (forgot to take a picture, and then wiped it clean), but I think the standard is still higher for this level, above the shower room and the TV There are still many handprints and the carpet is not very clean;

Environment: The environment of the hotel is quite good, but the concierge depar**ent on the first floor is indeed a bit "lazy". Our arrival and departure services are very good, but we saw a little girl in school uniform getting off the bus while waiting for the bus , the concierge guy walked slowly towards her, and she even looked back at the guy, and finally took the big suitcase out of the car trunk by herself. . .

Service: The service at the front desk is very good, but we used a two-night voucher to stay for another two nights. The front desk didn't call the next morning to explain that we need to update the room card, so we couldn't go back in the afternoon. . . The updated mini bar mentioned at check-in has not been realized.
I didn't see the "T61 Marinara Champagne sparkling wine and fruit plate" for the two-day stay

The overall location is very good. The location is quiet in the midst of the bustle. It is 7 or 8 minutes away from Taikoo Li. The hotel as a whole exceeds expectations. The breakfast and a complimentary lunch are quite good 👍 I will stay again next time, but the front desk is very friendly to guests You still need to know more about the accommodation situation, and the concierge depar**ent needs to strengthen training.

There is no Jinjiang night tour that is given as a bonus when booking a room. If it doesn’t exist, it will be gone. If you don’t take the initiative to tell the guests, otherwise you will be removed from the store. Right, I mentioned that it was a problem with Ctrip and asked me to contact Ctrip. I also said that they would give me a fruit plate. I didn’t care about that fruit plate, but they are so awesome, so I had to ask Ctrip to solve the problem. I originally renewed my contract with them. I will cancel directly in the next 3 days. The front desk service really needs to be improved. Don’t just rely on the good location of your hotel...

Finally, I chose Hyatt Reserve based on the location, hotel opening time, room size, price and other conditions, but because of the bad reviews on the Internet I still have lingering fears, but I am very happy. From the phone confirmation before check-in to the departure of the hotel, all the experiences are satisfactory. Generally speaking, it is comfortable, caring, convenient, and great value. Specifically, the room layout has a large sense of space, and the two sheets are 1.35 There is no crowded feeling after the single bed is added to the bed; guest rooms, restaurants and other services are available in a timely manner without interruption; the hotel is located in a prosperous area, with convenient transportation, there is a street of hot pot restaurants, Sichuan restaurants, cafes, etc. nearby; extra beds and breakfast are available Super value, there are free snacks and drinks in the refrigerator in the room. I hope that my personal feelings can provide others with an effective comparison reference for hotel selection. Attached below is a WeChat chat clip with the hotel staff before leaving

If you are afraid of noise, don't live upstairs. The nightclub is at 4 o'clock at night and we listen to the vibration of the music until 2 or 3 o'clock.

An authentic hot pot restaurant is within two steps on average. It is very convenient. The room is on the 50th floor with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the entire Taikoo Li.
While maintaining a consistently high standard of service and room environment, I would like to thank [Hiroko the Concierge] for making our entire trip to Chengdu an excellent experience. We took care of everything from reception to check-out. We both had identities when we checked in. The certificate was lost, Haozi personally took us to the nearest police station to apply for a temporary certificate, and he personally took care of the whole process except for reporting the identity information, and we just followed behind! Save worry and effort!
Before coming to Chengdu, I searched a lot of food guides. I was afraid of stepping on the Internet celebrity marketing shop. Haozi specially gave an internally organized play guide, including activities, hot pot, Sichuan cuisine, Chuan Chuanxiang and other shops, all of which are certified by locals. The list of gourmet specialties that we typed out manually, we randomly selected a few that are delicious and will not be overwhelmed at all. Some restaurants need to queue up for hundreds of tables because they are too popular, and Haozi communicates with the restaurant by himself, so we don’t need to go to the store to pick them up If you wait in line for a few more hours, you can just walk out the door at that point!
I came to Chengdu purely for eating and drinking. These services are really considerate and in place. I am very grateful. Hyatt will definitely thrive with such staff~!
Of course, there are also a lot of local delicacies in Chengdu. I like this city more and more.

You can’t add toiletries to the room, you can only add one set at most. I have stayed in countless hotels, and this is the first time I heard the rule that you can’t add toiletries. The hot water in the shower area is cold and hot for a while, the carpet in the bathroom is super dirty, and the carpet in the room is dirt. The breakfast in the restaurant is like a vegetable market, there is no dining table, and there are no waiters to arrange and clean the table. There is no waiter to clean the room. It is not recommended to stay in this hotel.

The breakfast variety is not bad, which is considered a five-star standard.
When we went there, the Chinese New Year was approaching, and the swimming pool did not open until after 1 pm recently. The child wanted to go swimming after breakfast in the morning. After changing into his swimsuit, he went downstairs and found that the swimming pool was closed and went back to his room. It didn't take long for the front desk to call and say that I was very sorry to see that the children had changed into swimsuits and failed to swim. They helped us check out late and we must let the children experience the swimming pool. Although swimming is not a must, we are all very moved by this thoughtful act, which can be seen from the hotel's attention to details and the feelings of guests. The next time you go to Chengdu, you must choose Lump Hyatt!

Suggested improvement is service. There was no one to guide the breakfast, and I couldn't find a place after searching for a long time. Maybe there are too many people. There was no dining in sign on the table either. After I finally went to get the fruit, the table was cleared when I came back.

The gym runs from 1:00 pm to 9:00 pm. It feels like it can be extended a bit. Come and play casually at night and come back at eight or nine o'clock. I want to go in the morning, but it doesn't open in the morning.

It is recommended that Ctrip cancel the welcome fruit logo. I think it's OK to say no, but it's a bit perfunctory to say there are two oranges.

I have been to Grand Hyatt in the past two days. Although it is relatively old, the service is nothing to say. Hahaha. The last three are pictures of Grand Hyatt.

Environment: It's about five minutes' walk from the subway station and bus station. It's very convenient to travel. Even if you walk to Taikoo Li IFS on Chunxi Road, it takes about 15 minutes. I especially like the high-altitude view of the hotel. You can see Taikoo Li at night. really comfortable~

Service: From the moment we arrived at the entrance of the hotel, we felt the service of Hyatt Collection. The staff in the lobby and the front desk were very friendly, and the staff in the breakfast depar**ent were also very dedicated. They gave us a very good check-in experience. Something happened during the break There was a small episode, but Leo resolved it for us right away. When we checked out, Ann also told us how to improve the experience during check-in. 👍🏻

Facilities: The breakfast is very good, with a lot of variety (you can’t forget the delicious egg cake~) Most of the rooms are equipped with automatic equipment, and the toiletries are Fumar. There is a tea set in the room. You can watch the high-altitude scenery and drink tea. You can cast a screen but I don’t know why the internet speed is a little slow and I often get stuck. I have a small suggestion. It would be better if the time can be seen in the room~and I only found out later that there is a special item of "Dalongyi Hot Pot Voucher 60 Yuan" Hahaha, I didn't experience it when I checked in at the hotel 🤔 I hope to have a chance to experience it next time

msg:To be honest, this is the first time I have stayed in such a high-end hotel. I was happy in myself, but one thing turned out to be very uncomfortable. In terms of all aspects of hotel facilities and services, there is no problem at all, but the hotel deposit is very confusing. First of all, I prepaid the room fee of 1,388 yuan on the platform, and then charged a deposit of 2,500 yuan when I arrived at the hotel. The front desk told me that what I paid on the platform was only a prepayment fee, and the platform would refund it after I checked out . I didn't understand, since the platform charged this fee, why should the hotel charge it separately? Isn't it unnecessary? Then why can't you directly collect or give a credit deposit on the platform? I don't think it's a big deal, but when I left the store at 9 o'clock the next morning, the deposit has not been refunded. I called the front desk, and the front desk said that it will not be refunded until 21:00-23:00 in the evening after the guest checks out? What is the logic? Then push it to the bank! I have stayed in so many hotels, and after the guests leave the hotel, they will return in about 4 hours at the latest. This one will be closed for 14-14 hours! Dare to ask why the bank review takes so long! ? This makes people feel very uncomfortable!

msg:This time, when I booked a parent-child tour in Chengdu, I considered many hotels near Taikoo Li. There are Atour, Zhenyue Longbao, etc., but the hardware facilities, environment and scenery are definitely the best in the Hyatt row (the price is about one or two thousand). choice)

First of all, I like the swimming pool of Hyatt. It is a must for parent-child travel. Chengdu is hot in summer, and it is not suitable for going out in the afternoon. It is good to take children to soak in the swimming pool for a day. Many hotels around have not opened swimming pools or have poor swimming pool facilities due to the epidemic...

Secondly, if you are interested in Hyatt nucleic acid free, the nucleic acid of medical staff is free from 1:00 to 3:00 in the lobby on the first floor every afternoon, so as to save yourself from going to the hospital, which is particularly important for tourism in the current social environment...

Hyatt ate three breakfasts, and the child exceeded the standard, so I paid the full amount, because I didn't sign the bill one day in the middle. Also very comfortable.

The size of the room, the bathtub, the shower room, the washbasin, etc., as well as the electric induction toilet are all available. The experience of staying is 9.5 points out of 10, and 0.5 points is slightly more than a few other hotels. Haha ~ I recommend Taikoo Li to stay here home [naughty] [naughty]

Secondly, the sound insulation of the room is also very poor, even the sound of flushing from the next door can be heard. Also, as a five-star hotel, there is no air conditioning in the elevator. In the 40-degree weather, a dozen people in the elevator looked at each other and sweated profusely. All in all, a Samsung experience at a super five-star price! I can't give you one more point!

The room decoration is also a modern and simple style that young people like. The rooms are all on the upper floors with first-class views, and the area is not small, but the cleaning needs to be more meticulous. There are a few long hairs on the carpet. In addition, what I want to complain about is that the hotel service is not worthy of five stars. Before I checked in, the waiter who was seated refused to say that she was going to deal with other things and needed to wait next to me... There is nothing to wait for a waiter next to me to receive it. Intuitively, I felt that I was in a hurry and took the documents and started to check in. In the end, I didn't introduce the basic facilities, wifi, where the restaurant is, and didn't ask if I needed to transport luggage, and I didn't lead the guests to the elevator entrance...
The breakfast tastes good, both Chinese and Western, but the waiter will not take the initiative to introduce the distribution of breakfast food, nor will they ask the guests if they want coffee or tea…
After staying for two nights, only the staff of the fitness center praised the service... I have no desire to experience the spa and dining. I just want to say that the service needs to be worthy of your hardware and this brand~

The reply was to either turn off the air conditioner and only keep the fresh air system, or open the windows so that the temperature is completely uncontrollable.
Everything else is good, but the indoor temperature cannot be adjusted, which is really uncomfortable.

The advantages of the hotel: the design is a**ospheric, simple and modern; the facilities are new; the hygiene is clean; the softness of the bed is moderate; the breakfast is exquisite; the service is good (especially the boy Kevin).
Disadvantages of the hotel: the smart toilet is average, and the remote control is not very sensitive; the breakfast variety is not rich enough; although the location is near Chunxi Road, it is still a little far from Taikoo Li; shower gel and other supplies also need to be upgraded.

The front desk ann upgraded me to Yinghui considering that I was in a hurry to check in. The suite, when I entered the room, I was really shocked that the division of the room was very avant-garde, giving me a very a**ospheric feeling. The right side of the room is the living room, and the white mirror wall is facing the skyscape. The clear division of black and white design concept is indeed very modern. Playing a piece of music that I like when I arrive can make me very quiet while watching the scenery. The Harman Kardon mobile speakers equipped in the hotel play a key role when taking a bath. The toiletries are the brand of Guerlain in the hotel industry. It is very rare, and the turndown service is also very careful to leave a steam eye mask. There are too many advantages in the room. Let’s talk about the rights and interests of the equipment. During the stay, guests can use afternoon tea for two, Happy hour, and three pieces of laundry. These are my own experiences. Arrived, the feeling is that the hotel spares no expense to create an a**osphere for the guests. Wenjia solved everything on WeChat during my stay. My questions about the hotel were very efficient and I quickly got to know the hotel. The location is in the prime area of the city center, Taikoo Li is 500M away from the hotel. This stay is very good, and I will definitely come again in the future.

msg:Check-in time should be after 3:00.
Because we went early, we checked in in advance, but told us that the room should be ready at two o'clock at the earliest. We expressed respect, so we went out to eat, and the front desk told us that we would call us.
It was not until 4:15 in the afternoon when we returned to the hotel. The front desk changed and told us that the room was not ready until 4:10. I think this is at least a violation of the spirit of the contract. Then call the lobby manager , apologized with a good attitude, and then said to send us an upgraded version of the welcome fruit, as well as the executive corridor.
Here are the highlights:
Administrative corridor, picture 2 and picture 3 are the Pu'er we ordered. It is exactly the same thing, the amount of tea is more than three times different, one cup is too bitter to swallow, one cup is like someone else drank it. Called the front office service, the front office service attitude is very good, sorry, and then told us that it was just too confusing. The. excuse me? A super five-star hotel, there is such a problem? Are you kidding me?
Well, let's not talk about anything else, and go back to the room at night. Picture 1 and picture 4 are the upgraded version of the fruit delivered. Our room originally brought a welcome fruit, so your hotel sent a black banana and an apple A pear and a dried kiwi fruit and two small plates are the upgraded version of the fruit?
Others, what should I say, the supporting facilities are not perfect, the service awareness, especially the front office customer service of our check-in procedures, needs to improve the service awareness.

There are a few small problems:
1) The weather in Chengdu is hot these days, and the room is very hot at about 27/28 degrees. The front desk said that the building has not turned on the cold air, but only "fresh air". You'd better confirm it in advance (then gave me a cooler);
2) In addition, there seems to be no small sound in the room, it is recommended to add it;
3) There is no writing desk, which may not be very friendly to business travelers who work in the room

Overall I am satisfied, except for the sultry heat~

msg:It was a very good experience, a full-time person asked us about our housing requirements before joining. I wanted a smoking room on a higher floor, and they all helped us meet it. Because we arrived early, we exchanged two drink coupons in advance. As long as there is a problem during the stay, call the concierge Alice can help us quickly! The final check-out was delayed until 2pm. After checking out, there will be hot pot bases delivered to the souvenir Mahjong version~
Really good experience! I will stay here again next time~

The bed in the room is facing the window, and the design is very innovative.

msg:Thinking of New Year's Eve, I chose this relatively new hotel. When I checked in, I heard the front desk call, saying that the guests in the residence were making trouble, but he didn't make a note of a room with a bathtub and a window. My heart shuddered, it was so bad, I didn't have any notes. Sure enough, I was disappointed when I entered the room, and came to the view of the high-altitude hotel. The outside was facing two residential buildings. So on the evening of New Year's Eve, I had to see the night view of the residential building. On New Year's Day, when the sun is in Chengdu, I can only drink coffee and look at the residential building. Think about the area of this real estate is also very expensive. Later friends, don't be lazy, move your fingers to note the good scenery and the bathtub by the window.
The design of the room is quite satisfactory, partial to business, not very high-end. Then there is a welcome fruit plate for points exchange, a huge apple. . .
The whole building is very hot in winter. I don't know if it is an advantage or a disadvantage. The windows of the room cannot be opened, which is really stuffy.
Let me talk about the advantages. The room is relatively spacious, the bed is very wide, the breakfast is delicious, and the dinner is eaten at Yuchu, which tastes good, but there is also a small tip. The set meal for two is cheaper than a single order. The pool photos are pretty good, but they are not that big. The spa is outsourced and the experience is not bad. The smart control of the toilet is beautiful with a touch screen. The attitude of the waiters from the front desk to the restaurant is very good.

msg:I was on a business trip to Chengdu, and after a long time to choose online, I decided to stay in the Hyatt Select. Due to the early arrival time, I was worried that the room might not be available at the beginning. As a result, the check-in procedure was completed smoothly. The front desk staff asked about the room requirements and patiently explained the administrative courtesy. Check into the room after drinking tea in the lobby bar.

This time I was given a room on the 59th floor. Since the 60th floor is temporarily unopened, it is considered the highest floor. The view from the room is very good, and Taikoo Li and the surrounding business districts have unobstructed views, and the sunrise can be seen. Many details also show the intention.

In the afternoon, I enjoyed afternoon tea in the lobby bar. There were four types of refreshments, each with its own characteristics.

The environment of the breakfast room is also very satisfactory, especially the color scheme of the tables and chairs is my favorite style. The dishes are standard with some local Sichuan characteristics.

A very satisfying experience overall.

msg:When I came to Langpo before, I bought the afternoon tea set on 6.18. This 11.11 event was not bad. I decisively started with a room for 2 nights. It was 1,777 yuan for 2 nights with breakfast and a steak dinner for two. It was indeed attractive enough, okay. Don't talk nonsense, focus on analyzing the hotel🤪
🚗 Transportation: The transportation is fairly convenient. It’s just one street away from Taikoo Li, and the straight line distance is 2-300 meters. The subway can take Line 2 to Dongmen Bridge, which is very convenient. Lazy people can take a taxi directly, and there is also underground parking for driving. Field 🅿️
🍃Environment: This building is very tall, with 61 floors, 58-61 are exclusive floors (that is, suites). The front desk, cloud kitchen and lobby bar are all on the 38th floor. The lobby is still very domineering, with at least 9 floors. M, there is a sofa sitting in front of each reception desk to check in.
🏨Room facilities: The required high floor is arranged on the 50th floor (in fact, it can be higher 😁). After entering the room, there is a porch. There is a wardrobe on the right and a toilet on the left. The shower and toilet are separated. It is a reasonable design! The room is not small, and the bathroom is relatively large. I called in advance and made a killer arrangement. The bathtub is by the window, so you can directly look at the Funan River;
With double vanity design, the shower room is also relatively large and there is plenty of space;
The bedding is comfortable, the pillows are soft and hard, and the bathrobes look like Jiayueli's, very comfortable, I bought 2 sets in the decisive applet;
The scent of the equipment is very advanced, I heard that it is a niche brand, and it is very pleasant to use;
Needless to say, electric curtains and smart toilets are standard equipment in luxury hotels;
The kettle is also fashionable, and there is also a coffee machine, but there is no red wine glass or foreign wine glass. This is a bit lacking, and the waiter has to call the front desk to get it;
The mini bar is very simple, Coke, Sprite, Wong Lo Kat, Tsingtao Beer, VOSS soda, no other snacks;
Slippers are good;
💥What BUT wants to complain about is breakfast. It is not like a breakfast that a luxury hotel should have. It is very simple, not many varieties, and not of good quality. Not bad
🧹Sanitation: The overall sanitation and cleaning are very clean, but the sticky notes are out of pens and have not been put away. I don’t know if I forgot. I can’t do anything I want to write, and I’m too lazy to send it away.
🔔Service: It took about 10 minutes to check in. I checked the pre-sale and did not inform the check-out time and turn-down time. The mini bar in the room is free and I did not inform it. I still need to improve my professionalism.
Come live next time to see if it will improve 🤪

Finally, the + cup of freshly squeezed juice did not come from the beginning to the end of the meal. (About 40 minutes) the waiter went to remind the order and was told loudly, "You can't win! If it's too late, just let her wait." I ordered them all at once in the next day, lest it's too late and won't win. The result is that except for the first bowl of noodles, everything else will be cool 🤣. The tea set was used in the room on the first day, but the tea set is still in the room the next day. Does it require the customer to wash it himself? . In addition, don't turn on the air conditioner all night, it will be bigger for people who are sensitive to sound. Oh. I don't know the other rooms in room 5009. After all, how could something go wrong with the five-star selection. . .

The bedroom is full of white jade-like texture, which is derived from the fact that almost all the walls are wrapped in piano-painted protective walls, and the diffused beams hidden at the intersection of the protective walls and the right spotlights provide the light source, making the entire space soft. The closet and coffee table tailor-made for the guest rooms are made of brass, with marble cladding and solid wood cladding, and even the decorations continue the same style. The grey fabric sofa with footstool also exudes a homely feeling. The hotel service staff Zeng Yi's gentle voice and thoughtful handling speed are impressive.

msg:Before entering the car, the doorman was very enthusiastic to help with luggage. The lobby of the hotel is on the 38th floor and the scenery is great. Echo Chen came out of the elevator to receive us. We went to see the room first and then decided whether to check in or not. It was late, around 10 o'clock, Echo, very enthusiastically showed us around the room, and recommended which one has the better view. Originally, we planned to choose between Langpo and Sanhuang Xiyue next door. We were really impressed by Langpo’s service later. I especially praise Echo here. I am very careful. We also recommend surrounding attractions and food during our stay. Contact him if you have any questions, and help us deal with it. Compared with the five-star hotel in Jiuzhaigou, the service is much better. Echo has a text message to care about us until we check out. It can be said that we are caring for us in every possible way. Thank him very much here. Three days and two nights of care. As for the room, we stayed on the 52nd floor. The room is very new, stylish in design, and has a good view of the scenery. There are many functional areas in the room and the bedding is very comfortable. See the pictures for details. The problem is that the sound of toilet flushing is a bit loud, and the sound insulation effect of hand washing needs to be improved. Therefore, it is recommended that people with light sleep must close the bathroom door and shower door before going to bed.

Hearing that we were here to travel in Chengdu, they gave me souvenirs, two red pandas and a disinfection kit! After entering the room to rest, the waiter brought fresh fruit for the stay, not just a perfunctory one! The service attitude of the whole hotel is both professional and heart-warming. If there is a problem, I will come to you to solve it in time, which is pretty good.

msg:There was a problem with the bathroom facilities in the evening. I contacted Savan Yang, the front desk manager of the evening shift. She was very careful and proactive in dealing with the room problem. She quickly arranged and upgraded my room. She also sent fruit to another room for a companion. It's really in place. I experienced the two room types at once and they are very good, the design style is very good, I personally like Langyu, it will be more design sense than the suite room.
The breakfast options are plentiful and the quality is normal but not amazing. The only downside is that the waiters in the restaurant are not motivated, the location is not active, and the speed of cleaning the table is very slow.

The lobby is spacious and bright, but the aroma is a bit full, I prefer a fresher and more elegant, but it is also acceptable. The receptionists were very enthusiastic, especially Joy Hong, who carefully introduced the details and precautions of the stay, reminded the breakfast time and location, and felt very cordial. The decoration of the room as a whole is relatively new, especially the view is super good, you can see the night view while lying in bed, it is a big bonus with a couple, overall a very good experience, will come again next time

msg:I have stayed in many luxury hotels in Chengdu. On the morning of check-in, I was still wondering which one to choose near Taikoo Li. Later, under the warm and careful introduction of the duty manager Yang Shuhan, I finally chose Langpo, the Unbound Collection by Hyatt and did not disappoint us. Not only the rooms are clean and tidy, there is no peculiar smell, the bedding is comfortable and extremely quiet, the various facilities are new and intelligent, and the epidemic prevention and control measures are in place. It is the most comfortable stay in a luxury hotel, and the breakfast varieties are also exquisite and delicious. Special thanks to Manager Yang Shuhan, the restaurant and the waiter on the 48th floor, the service attitude is standard, the enthusiasm is in place, and they are willing to provide all kinds of help. I originally planned to have a physical examination for one day, but after I checked in, I received a text message from Manager Yang Shuhan: "Thank you for choosing our hotel. You can contact me if you need it in the future. The mobile phone number is also my WeChat account. We can also contact you on WeChat to provide you with more information. Good service, I wish you a pleasant stay.” For a while, it made people feel more warm and full, so the family decided to stay for another day without hesitation. With such high-quality manager Yang and service staff, guests will feel at home. The hotel will certainly attract more guests to come here to check in. We will also check in again and introduce it to friends to experience the services of a luxury high-end hotel. Five-star praise is a must after personal experience!

msg:This is a hotel with significant advantages and disadvantages. Let me talk about the advantages first, the location is not far from Taikoo City, the high-altitude lobby and the room view are very good, the first feeling of the hotel is fashionable design. Besides the shortcomings, there are simply too many 🧐 First, the poor facilities, which is reflected in the soundproofing of the room, which is extremely poor. The person next door or in the aisle talks as if it is deafening in your ears. The second embodiment of the poor facilities is the smart toilet in the room. Very good, but the sound of flushing and running is also deafening. 🧐The second worst is the poor service. I was a girl with two suitcases. When I got out of the car, there was no waiter who opened the door to help with the luggage, and no one sent it to the high-altitude lobby bar for check-in. btw, the swimming pool is small and there is no view. This hotel is the same price as the Chongqing Regent I stayed the day before, but the service and the decoration of the hotel's facilities are very different. This hotel can't wait to give you a bad review before I check out.

The young lady at the front desk was very enthusiastic and took the initiative to help us upgrade the room.
The room area is quite large, it is a suite with a good view.
The overall decoration is also relatively modern. It is quite in line with the aesthetics of young people.
Various supporting facilities are also complete.
But there are also some minor flaws. Personally, I think the mattress is a bit hard.
Forgot to take the breakfast, but I think the breakfast is still a little bit less selective and tastes a bit average. Hope it can be improved.

msg:For a former hotelier, I am very concerned about the quality of the hotel. I checked it a long time before I came. The opening time, drill level, area, location, decoration design style, and bed size must meet my inner needs. I am used to booking rooms with Ctrip and staying before the epidemic. 95% of the hotel will be upgraded, it is estimated that it is a good customer, haha. This time I booked for one night and did not enjoy the upgrade. It is estimated that the availability is not tight. There was a mini bar and three mangoes (two very sweet) on the first night. Asked and satisfied with the beauties at the front desk for a room with night view, great. The all-smart toilet (the lid is automatic) gave me the idea of going home and replacing the old smart toilet. The curtains and screens are also smart, which is not a feature, but the quality of the curtains and screens is higher than the original smart hotel. Because I thought it was good, it was delayed for another day, but there was no mini and fruit trea**ent. If I come next time, I will choose the hotel. A small suggestion, since the daily room rate is the same, you can consider the mini bar for free. In fact, you can't drink it, but you will feel more comfortable.

msg:This time I came to Chengdu for five days and four nights, and I stayed at this hotel. The first choice was because it was new enough. It has just opened, and it is estimated that the facilities and environmental sanitation will be better. The second is that it is close to Taikoo Li.

Hotel periphery: Let me talk about the impression when I first arrived at the hotel, because the hotel is located in an alley, there are some snack shops or vendors on the roadside, the environmental sanitation will be poor, and the road is very narrow, people and vehicles competing for roads in and out, here are Some small penalties

Check-in: The lobby is located on the 38th floor, the scenery is very good, and the style is also good, the front desk colleagues check in very quickly, this is a plus

Room environment: First of all, our room is on the 50th floor, the view facing is pretty good, and the space is quite large, there is a cloakroom (this is definitely a girl’s favorite), the toilet is very good, there are separate wash basins on both sides, you can use it in the morning No need to dispute, this is a bonus

Room decoration: Although the hotel opened recently, but the decoration is a bit unexquisite in terms of workmanship. It seems a little different from the Hyatt brand. A small part of the wooden floor of our room has been turned over, and because of the many shelves The mirror surface is black. If there is dust and sunlight, it is very obvious. The white part of the carpet is also a little dirty. This has some deductions.

Noise problem: Because we are the tail room, we are not likely to be affected by other guests. Only at night, there will be constant air-conditioning noise on the air-conditioning vent (I can still sleep at the volume when I sleep, so Did not mention to the hotel), but for some guests who are more sensitive to sleep quality, this is definitely not allowed to sleep, it is recommended to let the engineering staff see

Service problem: First of all, there are welcome fruits on the first night of the check-in, which gives extra points, but as soon as I walked in and put down my luggage, an aunt from the housekeeping depar**ent swiped in and rushed in. I met her. I guess I thought there was no one in the room yet. I didn’t take off my clothes. This point is deducted. Then it’s the takeaway problem. Because the hotel has a food delivery robot, I always call the hand-cranked drink takeaway. I told the front desk to let the robot deliver it (the drink is sealed) and then call it every time. The phone said I was afraid of spilling, food safety issues (I understand if the food is not delivered), and robots are not allowed to deliver. Every time I have to explain that the drink is sealed and save 100 words before they deliver it, and every time The front desk will be transferred to the concierge again. Basically, every time you call, you have to explain it to the guests. I think it’s better to make it clear to the guests at the beginning of the check-in. Otherwise, if the robot is here and food and drinks cannot be delivered, put it. This is equivalent to useless, because the hotel itself has to take the elevator twice to get the takeaway. This is relatively troublesome, otherwise we are willing to take it ourselves. I hope the hotel will have an improvement plan that optimizes the guests. The second is because Newly opened, and in the alley, the sign is not obvious. Many takeaways don’t know the place. In the past five days, I had to change clothes and go to the takeaway cabinet of the International Center next door. The reason was the takeaway. I can’t find the address and put it directly in the take-out cabinet. It’s a terrible experience. I hope the hotel can make a brighter sign at the intersection.

Hotel staff: This is remarkable. It is not bad to say that it is not bad. It is not good to say that it is good. Maybe the staff are not too enthusiastic. Knowing that they are foreign tourists, they will not take the initiative to talk or introduce some Scenic spots (not specific to the ingredients, because other brands have such services, it really makes the guests feel at ease, plus points), it may be a new opening, the training has not fully met the standard, if this service is equipped with Hyatt, it seems a little unsatisfactory. If it is a three- or four-star hotel, it is very good, hope to strengthen it

On the whole, it is basically qualified, but if you pay this price, I honestly hope it is a better experience. I hope I will have a different feeling next time.

Advantages [Candy]:

1) Newly opened in 2021, the overall feeling is very new.
2) The toiletries are well received, I don't know what brand, see the picture, the smell is very good.
3) It comes with Sichuan-flavored snacks, especially the limited green pepper potato chips, which is a pleasant surprise! The first round of mini bar drinks, there are Tsingtao Beer, Sprite. It is worth mentioning that the free water is VOSS, and I drink four bottles every day.
4) The bathtub is quite large, you can soak for two people, and the one-time loofah rubbing is very intimate.
5) The bedroom lights have two modes, bright and dark, which are very easy to use
6) The inside of the bathrobe is cotton and the outside is silk. The texture is good
7) It is very convenient to have a whole family next to the hotel. There are restaurants and cafes opposite, and it is also good to have a late night car.
8) The location of the hotel is good. It is the entrance of Taikoo Li after a small road and a big road (but it is not so close to the hotel in Taikoo Li, after all, people don't need to walk inside).
9) There is a T61 bar on the 61st floor of the hotel, which is said to be an internet celebrity bar. I went and took a look. It has three areas, one of which is for Pengdi. It happened to be under maintenance when I went, so it was meaningless. One is very ordinary, the other is KTV, I did not go.
10) Although the customer service has to wait fifteen minutes to send something up every time, Aunt Du Zhongqun is very nice, enthusiastic and cheerful, and like it!
11) The welcome fruit is cherries, which are cute in a steamer.


Disadvantages [Candy]:

1) The hotel is not easy to find. It is on a small road (although it is a small road in the city center), but it is difficult for foreigners to find it. The hotel is located in the building of the western financial center, which is equivalent to actually an office building. Hotel, so the lobby is not very grand (but Hyatt seems to be very low-key), it's not that I have to be grand, the key is that I can't find the main entrance at the beginning, the next building is the office building, it is easy to go wrong.

2) It may be that the automatic positioning is not accurate because it is just opened. Unless manually, it is not possible to set Langpo Hyatt, ordering food and Didi, it will be other locations, and then the driver will go wrong (personal experience), the most Fortunately, it is more accurate to call downstairs.

3) The storage glass cabinet itself has a bug in its design. The top layer is just decoration and has no practical use. Since it is done, it must be strengthened to remove dust. No one uses it. It looks like a layer of ash during the day, which is very unpleasant.

4) The common problem of sky lounge is really inconvenient to change two elevators, especially when taking takeaway.

5) The overall white of the big bed room is a bit pale, but it's okay to turn on the lights at night, and it doesn't look good during the day.

6) I heard from my auntie that the carpet on the sofa is made of wool. It may be troublesome to clean up, so the traces of use are a bit harsh, not particularly beautiful (not a problem if you don't look carefully).

A 50-square-meter room costs 982 yuan per night. It has an excellent location. The minibar and snacks are all free, and it is very cost-effective.

早餐品種很多，盅盅麪蠻有特色，還有蛋烘糕。來不及吃還能打包，特別人性化。
還有管家小甜，真的是有求必應，非常貼心。因為帶了兩個小朋友，還有準備了零食，小童沐浴用品，大人沐浴產品還是法國嬌蘭的。
總體來説性價比很高，下次來成都還會選擇這家！

其次這次可能有點差強人意的地方：
酒店餐食選擇有點少，水果很新鮮！希望下次有特色的成都小食更好啦～
房間隔音有點不好，旁邊房間晚上使用洗手間的聲音能聽的很清楚。房間窗簾開關聲有點大，但這個問題不大，忍一下就好。
衞生每天打掃感覺有點良莠不齊，第一天我和我朋友的化粧品用完放在枱子上原封未動，也沒有幫我們放一邊或怎麼樣，都是原本什麼樣回來還是什麼樣。第二天打掃的阿姨又把我們的化粧品整整齊齊擺放在毛巾上。不過每天都幫我們把睡衣疊好很貼心。但是第二天打掃我們房間沒有護理包，導致卸粧不好卸，希望下次能細心檢查住客使用了哪些東西，然後補上。
房間空調有點熱，温度不能控制，半夜總被熱醒，所以我們基本上晚上一回酒店就把空調關掉，但還是有點熱，可能是中央空調。
總的來説這次入住體驗還是挺不錯的，夜景也很美，下次來成都也是會再次選擇入住的。

前台小魚 主打一個給我們升級了落地窗，省下了好幾百！
房間管家 小聰服務很貼心，還幫我們延長了住房時間到下午 14:30 左右
總之，這次成都之旅很滿意。
推薦這個酒店～距離 太古裏 春熙路 IFS 溜達衹需要 10 分鐘內，周邊有名的吃吃也很多！

酒店設施較新，房間很大。

酒店服務非常好，還能免費升房。

到此本應該五星好評，為什麼衹給兩星？

1、早晨不到10點服務員咣咣砸門問要不要洗衣服… 直接給我砸醒了…這是什麼操作？
出來旅遊客人不睡懶覺？
洗衣服我自己不會叫服務？
我當天就退房了，你洗完給我發快遞？
每間房砸一遍，隔壁的隔壁砸門都聽得見…

2、給酒店SPA打電話問價格，説幾百到幾千都有要上門給我介紹，嚇得我直接掛電話…

msg:來成都玩，做了攻略之後定了這家酒店，入住後覺得還是不妄我做的攻略，大部分都挺滿意的，衹有一點點不是很滿意。不過人無完人嘛。
1.環境與位置：位置離太古裏很近，感覺步行幾分鐘就到了。酒店辦入住的地方在38樓，房間樓層都比較高，視野特別好，早上還看到美麗的日出，入住進房間需要用房卡刷電梯裏面然後再按樓層，這點工作人員沒有告知，還研究了一下才成功。住的基礎房，但是感覺房型也比較滿意，衞生間和洗漱的地方分開的，窗户是落地窗，窗簾、馬桶都是電動的，很不錯，贈送了小吃、水果、minibar ，備品不錯，馥爾馬的。有點我覺得有點不太滿意的是，我備註了我睡眠淺，需要安靜一點的房間。但是我入住的房間還是能聽到外面的聲音，半夜十二點後，半夢半醒的被吵醒，開關門的聲音、手機外放的聲音，如果在硬件上不能實現隔音升級，那我建議你們多關心一下客人，準備一點耳塞。想着太晚了，而且衹住一晚所以也就算了。
2.服務：有點我不是很明白的，不知道一樓的工作人員是你們酒店的麼，我們進入一樓後，有兩個服務人員看到我們來了，而且我們在一樓猶豫在哪裡辦入住的時候，沒有一個人來和我們打招呼詢問是否需要幫助，而且後面我們打算先去坐電梯到38樓的時候，看到我們都走過去了，有個工作人員也要上去，也不等我們一起進電梯，自己進電梯關了就走了。但是我們辦退房寄存行李又是寄存在他們那裡的，如果是屬於酒店管理的，我覺得服務意識有待加強。
3.早餐：種類還是豐富得，成都特色的就是有蛋烘糕。感覺樣式還是做的比較足，餐廳的服務人員很好，會引導我們到餐桌，問我們要不要喝的，收餐盤也很及時，鮮榨果汁有橙汁、西瓜汁，表揚早餐工作人員！

缺點：無頂噴，衞生一般，毛巾櫃子上竟然一層灰，洗漱用品第二天也不會補全，化粧鏡沒幾分鐘就沒電了。

送餐服務簡直垃圾，備註加辣送到是清湯還特鹹！送餐小哥也拽的很，進門 放下 走人，笑死道個謝理都不理

msg:還是11月那會入住的了，來補一個5星好評～凱悦臻選永遠不會讓人失望！

酒店的位置非常好，步行三分鐘就能到太古裏，十分鐘到春熙路。高空大堂很驚艷，裝修風格頗有幾分柏悦的影子（除了更摩登時尚一點，近乎以假亂真）。雖説用的是攜程的團購券，酒店還是主動幫忙升級到了瑯玉客房，而且安排的還是高樓層，視野非常好，晚上可以遠眺九眼橋蘭桂坊的燈紅酒綠。酒店雖然開業有幾年了，硬件設施維護得也不錯。

以及特別要誇讚的一點：酒店的早餐真的非常豐盛！入住了兩天都沒有把早餐的品類都掃一遍，可以説在選擇上是遠超大部分凱悦甚至是君悦/柏悦了。

總結：成都標桿性的高空五星酒店，超高性價比，絕對值得再訪。

小提示，酒店樓下小街的麪館、小吃店都不錯，價廉物美。拐角的小咖啡店也很好。
服務：前台小謝服務非常周到。
環境：酒店很新，房間也很大，裝修不錯的。周圍雖然很市井，但很多好吃的，晚上依然有小吃攤。
設施：很不錯，浴品也很好。

衞生：衞生打掃得很乾凈，布草清潔柔軟。
服務：入住退房都很便捷，按金秒退。門僮會幫忙指路，拿行李。
缺點：最左邊的電梯晃得很厲害，有點嚇人。從地下車庫到房間要換三部電梯，有點麻煩。

衞生：衞生間的衞生能再加強一些，配備消毒濕巾紙就更好了。

msg:首先，我肯定酒店的位置，視野，裝修都是非常好的。值得入住。但是在員工服務上有很大的漏洞，尤其是客房清潔，入住第三天因為洗澡把玉放在床上，洗完澡出門吃飯，玉也就放在床上沒有帶。回來後玉也不見了，酒店員工説是幫忙找了床單被套但是沒有，玉加上鍊子也是不小了，竟然在打掃床鋪的時候也沒有看到嗎？由於是我自己亂放且玉價值不高就算了，也沒有和酒店過多交涉。之後酒店打電話幾次都在誤導我讓我覺得我的玉在外面丟了。玉要麼戴在脖子上要麼放在房間裏，正常人也知道玉戴在脖子上很難丟。套房沙發的靠背很容易掉下來，充電寶放在上面掉了下去，但是因為電話我也忘了拿就退房離開了。離開後給酒店打電話酒店也沒有找到。這兩樣物品價值不高，但是讓人覺得很不舒服，尤其是我記得兩樣東西在房間的具體位置，酒店一件都沒有找到屬實讓人失望。

msg:第一次來成都，圍繞春熙路各家酒店糾結了好久，還是選中瑯珀，畢竟是新酒店，樓層高，符合孩子對出遊酒店的要求（媽媽們都懂的）。入住後果然沒有失望，孩子很興奮，沒有住過這麼高的樓層，可以看到不遠處九眼橋的夜景。地段也很好，到太古裏ifs都是步行可達。
也是第一次入住前收到酒店來電，對接我的是小甜，很貼心，詢問入住有什麼特別的需求，知道有孩子，在入住前就把小童洗具送到了房間，每天也會問入住體驗，提出的要求（比如添一床被子等）馬上響應，非常可以！
而且酒店的自助早餐，12歲以下小童是免費的，這點很可以，很多酒店都是130以下孩子才免費，如果再買一份，就有點不值了。
所以來成都的話，還是很推薦這家酒店的！

msg:這次的入住體驗還算滿意！酒店服務態度很好，員工們始終保持着親切的微笑，不僅如此，他們的形象也非常出色，特別是賓客服務中心小懿管家，讓人印象深刻。但個別業務還需熟練，欠缺一些主動性，略顯靦腆，專業培訓不足。酒店的位置非常方便，周圍交通便利，出行毫無壓力，落地窗視野開闊，一覽無遺，房間內設施非常齊全，乾淨整潔，生活用品一應俱全。推薦給有需要的朋友們！

1.感覺酒店人手緊缺，辦理入住後送行李上來的是一名女員工，估計是沒有力氣把行李箱放到衣櫃那裡，按了門鈴問我行李擺在門附近可以嗎...
我是個柔弱的男人，把行李搬上衣帽間架子挺吃力。。。
2.清潔不到位。入住後發現床單還有陌生人的毛髮，其二鏡子還留有上一旅客/保潔的指紋
3.馬桶極度抽風，不智能卻**，使用後隔一段時間就不斷循環沖水，聲音極大！！！ 半夜上廁所為了睡個好覺還得自己把馬桶的插頭拔了。
4.網絡極差！ 連了以後有時候兩格或者直接擺爛崩潰了。。。
5.第二三四點我其實住的第一天留紙條給你們了，卻沒有任何反饋。在這裏評論估計你們能看到，印象更深刻點

還有廁所裏的體重秤！一開始以為是壞了不準，後來一查，單位竟然是lb？磅？不是公斤或者斤！真的讓人摸不着頭腦！哪個中國人稱體重會用磅做單位。麻煩貴酒店既然開在國內，能不能符合一下國情呢？
然後就是早餐真的難吃！品種也不太多！第一天吃完後，第二天直接沒去吃早飯！早知道不訂帶早餐的了！

msg:之前住過很喜歡，這次定了兩晚，第一晚到酒店説滿房了於是分配了煙味很重的吸煙層房間，作為一個煙味嚴重過敏者完全受不了。當晚的前台不太好溝通，開始説沒無煙房了，經過攜程協調才讓我自己付費三百多升級了無煙的小童主題房。第二天的值班經理很nice，直接免費升級了臨河的無煙房型，才挽回一些了本次的入住體驗，這家酒店總的來説還是不錯。

msg:成都是座值得再來的城市，凱悦亦是一家值得再來的酒店，當初選擇這家酒店是因為地段好，它地處太古裏附近，去哪裡都很方便，酒店剛訂好，Thalia就加了我的微信，在入住酒店的幾天裏，Thalia更是每天主動來詢問我需要什麼幫助，貼心地幫我安排了紙板箱讓我把紀念品和特產打包帶回家，更是在我回到家還想加購特產時，幫我安排好快遞寄給我，連小朋友都在便簽紙上留了言，説下次還要來，必須五星好評。

msg:交通便利，出來走路可到太古裏，春熙路小吃街，房間新，服務不錯，早餐也不錯。很不幸遇到大樓突然停電，幸運的時在準備進電梯那刻停電，沒有困電梯，但是抱着剛睡着的娃，我們一家人幾口有老有小，酒店服務人員卻沒有提供任何幫助，剛辦理入住手續，除了手機啥東西身上都沒有，停電時間也沒有明確，應急服務處理能力跟大牌酒店還是差距有點大

msg:25-27號入住，沒有雙床房了。到酒店後要求加床,結果被告知整個酒店衹有10張加床，過年期間小朋友太多，沒有了，難以想象這是豪華酒店，然後我就説那幫我留一床被子吧，答覆是被子也不一定有，要去確認下，對酒店第一印象非常不好！

衞生：不過關，門口牆板上有不明油污，感覺是小朋友用油手在上面抹的，衞生間地面有水漬。
服務：還行，中規中矩！但是過年期間早餐人太多，導致要自己找位置，而且不能及時把餐具擺好，全靠自己找位置擺餐具，238的早餐感覺非常一般，完全不如博舍168的早餐。
優點：地理位置好，酒店比較新。

工作人員訓練有素，非常專業。
早餐食物很精緻可口，要是能體現成都特色的美食更豐富一些就好了。
唯一遺憾就是每天早出晚歸，沒能好好賴床。
