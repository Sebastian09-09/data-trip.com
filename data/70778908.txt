msg:I was very happy to choose Anji Petrus Yaoliang Resort Hotel. This is the best hotel in Anji, I personally think. The price is high, but it is indeed good. Both the service and the hotel atmosphere are very comfortable and cozy. Sitting in the hotel lobby is also a kind of enjoyment. The housekeeper is meticulous and the online and offline services are very timely. The large supplies in the guest rooms are very user-friendly. From the quality of paper towels and mineral water alone, it can be seen that the hotel has a very high service awareness, which deserves great praise. I hope that domestic brands will do better and better, and look forward to Petrus' new hotel next year.

msg:The most satisfying thing about the trip to Anji was the stay at the Petrus Yaoliang Hotel. Unlike big-name hotels, this place is more private, low-key and luxurious. Surrounded by tea mountains and rice fields, accompanied by streams and birdsong, it is a good place to escape from the hustle and bustle and enjoy a relaxing stay. The overall Japanese style of the hotel, whether it is the architectural design or the details of the facilities, all reflect exquisiteness and high quality. The hotel's service is even more memorable, from the welcome fruit, to the red bean and lotus seed soup in the evening, the rich water bar drinks, the amazing breakfast, and the heartwarming souvenirs when leaving the hotel. The big-eyed brother who drove the battery car also took the initiative to take us to see the hotel's rice fields and tea gardens and take pictures for us. It's so heartwarming. I hope that when autumn comes and everything is golden, I will bring my family to visit again.

msg:The ceiling resort hotel in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. The decoration is quite Aman-style, the hardware facilities are of 666 specifications and aesthetics. In terms of software, the entrance security uncle, the front desk brother and sister, and the aunt who manages the activity area on the G floor in the afternoon are all excellent. The fireworks on holidays are worth seeing, and the fish soup in the restaurant is very thick~
Disadvantages: 1. It is very difficult to press the TV. It is better to get a Xiaomi box. The water pressure for bathing is not enough, and the temperature of the shower and sprinkler nozzle is inconsistent
2. There are still a few activities. Don't waste so much land. It is recommended to add lure fish ponds, and you can bring them to the restaurant to cook~
3. Such a large dressing room is equipped. It is actually missing an important spa that can also increase revenue
4. It needs to be equipped with an adult tricycle

Looking forward to the new brand of Petrus to raise the new standard for domestic vacations!
I will go there again when the new hotel is built

The baby fell asleep on the way.
After checking in quickly, I put the baby to sleep in the crib prepared in advance as soon as I entered the room.
Baby water and baby toiletries were also prepared in the cabinet.
The restaurant also made baby food in the evening.
The noodles were not finely processed. I took the food scissors to cut them for a long time.
There were few people in the hotel. It was relatively close.
The children's park was reserved. It might be because there were few people.
There were not many types of breakfast.
But the freshly cooked food was quite delicious.
The overall experience was not bad.
The service was quite considerate and polite.
If the baby is older, we can go out for a bicycle together. The experience will be better.

msg:A light luxury resort hotel hidden in the countryside of Anji. It takes about two and a half hours to drive from Suzhou. After getting off the highway, you can go up along the country road. Near the end of the road, there is an independent large courtyard, which feels a bit isolated from the world. Everywhere in the hotel is a painting. Distant mountains, bamboo sea, pine forest, tea garden, all are scenery. The designer cleverly integrates natural landscape into the architecture, combining Chinese elements and Japanese design. While enjoying modern fashion, you can also feel the pure pastoral scenery. Whether you are meditating in the distant mountain and pastoral frame in the lobby, or watching the reflection in the South Water Courtyard, you can find inner peace.
The service staff are very polite, smiling and very gentle. The hotel has complete supporting facilities, including a Chinese restaurant, a gym, a cinema, a bar (you can play billiards), a KTV, an indoor swimming pool, a book bar (chess/flying chess/chess/go, etc.), and some books. You can put Kongming lanterns at night. Although the sparrow is small, it has everything. The toiletries are Parma, Dyson hair dryer, free minibar, with various drinks, soda, juice, coffee, etc., as well as potato chips, nuts and instant noodles, great~
The hotel's food is also very cost-effective and delicious. It can be said to be a good place to escape from the world, very beautiful and quiet.

Not only must they have aesthetics, low-key luxury, but also touching details. Not only must they have natural scenery, but it is best that it is natural and not too artificial. These can all be met here~~A very pleasant stay. I hope the hotel will get better and better. By the way, for its positioning price, I think it is worth it

The hotel is very quiet, but the children will not feel bored. There are picture books and toys in the book bar. You can fly kites when it is windy. The butler brother at the front desk is also very enthusiastic. He answered all questions and gave us careful guidance. He told us that in addition to playing in the children's fun house, we can also go to the pond to catch fish. In particular, he reminded me, a careless person, and told me through the room phone that I lost my phone. I like this guy. It would be better if the breakfast was richer. There can be some lights in the courtyard at night. It is dark outside and the children will feel insecure. In short, the hotel meets expectations and is completely suitable for the vacation a**osphere of me, an i person. Recommended~

The hotel is built on the mountain, and we stayed in a mountain view room. Looking out from the wide glass windows, we could see the rolling mountains. Sitting on the bedside couch and looking out, you can relax. In the evening, the hotel also had a cocktail party in front of the big lawn, and you can bring your children to taste snacks. It was a coincidence that we watched fireworks for two consecutive nights during the holiday, which made up for the regret that we couldn't set off fireworks in the city. This was the second time I watched fireworks after watching them in Victoria Harbour many years ago. Anyway, I will come again.

The room is spacious, the room type is comfortable, and the toiletries are all Aqua de Parma. All service staff are online, friendly, natural, meticulous and considerate. Before checking in, I noted that I needed a baby toilet seat, and the hotel bought a new one specifically, and also prepared special baby water to meet the needs of guests as much as possible.
The book bar is facing the lawn and distant mountains, with great scenery. It provides water, snacks, books, chess, kites, football, frisbees and other leisure and entertainment equipment throughout the day, so you can stay comfortably for a whole day.
This time I checked in around May Day, and the hotel prepared a cocktail party, open-air movies, fireworks üéÜ, and Kongming lanterns in the evening. The fireworks that I didn't see in Sanya during the New Year's Eve were satisfied in the mountains on May Day.
I especially want to praise a male service staff in the restaurant, who is professional, meticulous, and super loving to babies, which is a big plus.
In short, this trip to Petrus is the best hotel experience in the past two years. The hotel has less than 20 rooms, low passenger density, and high comfort. It can be seen that the overall operation is very smooth, the staff training is in place, and everyone can add points to the overall service. From entering the door to leaving the hotel, people can feel very comfortable throughout the whole process, not bored, and being well taken care of. I think this is the memory left by a good hotel.

Goodnight sweet soup, fruits, and snacks have new varieties every day, and the quality is also very good. I plan to come back in autumn to experience the autumn scenery~

It is a resort hotel with one step and one view. All the hotel staff are very warm and considerate, and there are also welcome fruits and good night sweet soup.
You can have afternoon tea or play some games at the book bar, or you can quietly practice calligraphy. The hotel also has bicycles that you can borrow for free for riding.
The food in the restaurant is very delicious. When I left, I packed a cheese hawthorn roll separately. The hotel also gave a local specialty - Anji white tea as a souvenir. I was really touchedü•≤
Looking forward to the bamboo shoot digging and tea picking activities in April...will come back again! !

msg:(¬¥‚ñΩÔΩÄ) I want to come back in the spring to dig bamboo shoots, pick tea and watch the rape blossoms, and in the summer to go up the stream to catch small fish and pick vegetables.
In fact, autumn and winter are also quite beautifulüòå
Take a slow walk to the tea mountain and see the camellias in full bloom. There are also golden rice fields in the garden. Driving up the mountain, you can overlook the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãbamboo. There is also a huge century-old ginkgo in the village. When the wind blows, the leaves rustle like gold foil. Falling to the ground‚Ä¶

(Mainly because there are very few people in the off-season, it really feels like a private tourüòÜ

The service is also very good, the best experience I have ever stayed in in a hotel of the same price range! It's a pity that I only stayed one night this time because of time constraints. I will definitely stay a few more nights next time I come back.

msg:I wasn't sure whether to choose Petrus or Banyan Tree for my birthday, but when I arrived, I was glad I chose Petrus. As soon as you enter the door, you can experience the one-to-one attentive service. Since it is a birthday, my husband and I celebrated our birthdays two days in a row and specially decorated the room twice for us, with handmade greeting cards, flowers, balloons, small crowns, and small details. Full. Thank you very much Miss Zhao! The cake chef even specially prepared two different styles for us to preserve the surprise! In addition, the hotel's courtyard landscaping is more Japanese-style, and the mountain views outside the floor-to-ceiling windows are unobstructed, which is no worse than Kyoto. Just eat, drink and have fun here for three days and two nights, and you won't be bored at all. It is worth mentioning that the dishes and pastries here are very delicious. I thought the dishes in the hotel were average, but the price is completely proportional to the taste and quality! There‚Äôs really no need to go out and forage. The boss here should be a very tasteful person, and some of the supplies and aesthetics he chose are low-key and luxurious, which is really good! If you like slow life and tasteful life, you will definitely not be disappointed if you choose this place! It‚Äôs convenient to come to Shanghai and I will definitely come again!

The butler service is very serious. He will call and send WeChat messages before checking in, and he is the kind of person who will not be disturbed by disgust. He just asks for good service. When he learned that we were here to celebrate an anniversary, he enthusiastically agreed to give us a surprise. Makes me very happy! The housekeeper was responsive to all requests during the entire stay, and messages were returned within seconds. There is only one restaurant in the entire hotel. You can contact the butler in advance. Some dishes require reservations and the taste is very good. There are bicycles provided at the front desk of the hotel during the day. You can ride along the hotel~ This hotel must have different styles throughout the year, like a fairyland~ We stayed in late autumn, it was very quiet and comfortable, just like an autumn fairy tale~

msg:The child could not reach the basin in the bathroom and stood on the makeup chair in the bathroom. The makeup chair was slippery and the child fell. It was around 9:45 in the morning. Since I had to take care of the child, I contacted the hotel housekeeper to inform the child that he had fallen. Can you help me deliver breakfast to the room? I saw reviews saying that if there are not many guests, breakfast will be delivered to the room, but the housekeeper directly told me that it will be delivered to the room for 158 people, plus a 15% service fee. I don‚Äôt expect it. I don't care. I just feel that the so-called attentive service is not reflected in me. Of course, the housekeeper later said that if it didn't work, let the front desk help deliver it. So why did he tell me how much it cost in the first place? I didn't know what kind of bugs I encountered on the night of check-in, and I developed a severe rash on my body. I asked the housekeeper if the hotel had any anti-inflammatory *****. The housekeeper did not ask if there was anything he could do for the guests, but directly told the hotel that they did not provide *****. Hmm, okay, it's a bit different from the online reviews. In short, it's not quite what I expected. Except for the excellent service of an aunt in the book bar and gym downstairs, I didn't have a good experience. There is nothing to walk nearby, just a few rice fields at the door.

msg:I saw this hotel when I was going to Anji. I read the reviews and said that it was in the deep mountains and there was nothing to fear. However, it turned out that it only took ten minutes to drive to the town, and the location was not that remote. The housekeeper left a Tesla charging station in advance (1.9/kWh slow charging), which gave me, a person who is anxious about electricity, a sense of security. The courtyard room I stayed in was quiet and quiet, and I couldn't hear other people's voices. There were few people around when walking around the hotel, which was very suitable for escaping from the world. Both dinner and breakfast were delicious. Every time you take a photo, it will look like a blockbuster. According to the introduction, there are only 18 rooms and five villas. It is my favorite hotel and I will come again!
Personal suggestion: Hotel rooms are mainly decorated with wooden decorations, which are easy to be knocked into. It is recommended to wrap the sofa and bed legs. I bumped my head while watching TV on the sofa and it hurt. There are no cushions on the patio chairs. Is that just that, or are they not placed?

In this impetuous and utilitarian society, isn‚Äôt this true for ecological leisure tourism? This is especially true for hotels that cater to niche holiday destinations! ! ! Personally, I prefer the "retreat-type light luxury resort hotel" located in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which is completely escaping from the world! Between here and Yue RZ, I finally chose here, and it proved that I was not disappointed at all! Few people, clean, secluded, peaceful, big oxygen bar, negative ions. . . It's really there, and it's also the evaluation of the hotel's "hardware" by all the guests who have been here! However, in the current economic environment of "consumption downgrade", the reason why customers are willing to spend real money for consumption, from my personal experience, should be the humanistic characteristics and service concept of this hotel, that is, The so-called "software": Before coming here, there was a dedicated "housekeeper" who added WeChat and sent specific hotel guides and itinerary arrangements. She was also very considerate and provided appropriate arrangements for many personalized needs, which made me feel "unprecedented". Come, my heart is warmed!" Although I have never met before, I still followed up the whole process after arriving at the store. Thank you againüôè; Director Zhao, who you met by chance in the hotel lobby, will chat with you without reservation like an old friend, which makes you feel warm; All the staff in the hotel are considerate, warm and polite like they treat family members! In addition, the three meals a day and afternoon tea provided by the restaurant are all delicious! Especially the local chicken soup and fresh bamboo shoots! All these and more details make the family feel "extremely comfortable". . . I am also engaged in the service industry, and I prefer to stay in hotels with unique characteristics and good reputations. I generally do not comment. This experience was quite good, and it is worth checking in again in the futureüëç!

They bought a birthday cake from outside and delivered it to the room, and apologized to me.

Abel's butler service is very good. After making a reservation, he will contact you in advance to arrange the car number. The check-in process is also very detailed. Breakfast is a set meal. Although it is not a traditional breakfast variety, the quality is okay.

msg:The cooler weather finally put a self-driving tour in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai on the agenda. It avoided the National Day peak and the hotel prices were more affordable. After two weeks of hotel planning, I chose @Anji Baicui Yaoliang Resort Hotel after repeated comparisons. Due to the stay experience It‚Äôs so good that I can‚Äôt help but make a tap water [laughing and crying R] [laughing and crying R] [laughing and crying R] because it really meets my current needs.
üöóTransportation: We drove from Suzhou for exactly two hours, but because we brought an elderly person and a baby under three years old, we still took a rest in the service area. We set off from Suzhou at ten o'clock, and it was just over eleven o'clock in an hour. When we arrived at the Nanxun service area, we packed up wontons and returned to the car to finish eating. Then we drove for another 50 minutes to the hotel. The last 20 minutes were on the village road, but the road conditions were good, so don‚Äôt worry.
üè†Residential experience: The main reason why I decided to choose Baicui Yaoliang is that the hotel has only 18 rooms and 5 villas in total. Even if the room is full in the spacious hotel, the guests can still spread out. This is very suitable for our family's epidemic prevention nails. It‚Äôs the household‚Äôs request! ! ! The baby will have to wait until next year to attend small classes. Before entering school, he still hopes to reduce the number of illnesses as much as possible, so he gave up many popular family hotels and chose this escape hotel. When checking in, the staff took the initiative to help upgrade the duplex after confirming that the villa was vacant. Villa [Party R] [Party R] [Party R] Seeing that we brought our parents, grandparents, and children, we said that the villa is more convenient for our family to live, which is so considerate, okay? [Shy R] [Shy R] [Shy R] The bedrooms are all equipped with Nongfu Spring water for infants and young children, and the room hygiene is also very good.
üë∂üèªEntertainment: I think it is not a problem to stay in the hotel for three days and two nights. The scenery of the hotel makes people feel relaxed and comfortable. On the first day I checked in, I took the children to ride a bicycle. The hotel has adult and training wheels. Children's bicycles, I made an appoin**ent for travel photography the next morning, because the scenery in the hotel was really stunning! Half a day of taking pictures has almost passed. After taking a lunch break, I can make an appoin**ent for afternoon tea in the package. It is very comfortable to sit in the yard and drink afternoon tea and spend time. I looked at the brochure and the hotel also has a video room and a ktv. , study room, tea room, gym, I didn‚Äôt experience any of these this time with my children.
üçΩFood and Beverage: Relatively speaking, Anji doesn‚Äôt have that much delicious food, so I had very low expectations for food during this trip. I even brought a large bag of various snacks to worry about starving everyone, but the hotel‚Äôs own restaurant served great food! It completely exceeded my expectations. The dishes that need to be stewed usually need to be ordered half a day in advance. The food is not pre-made, which is a surprise, and they can also deliver meals to the room! ! ! For a family like ours who hardly eats in the house because of the epidemic prevention, I am moved to tears [crying R] Regarding breakfast, when there are many people, they have a buffet. On Monday morning, there are only three rooms with guests, so it is a set meal.
Overall, after staying here, I feel that this is a very warm hotel. It may be because there are few guests but a lot of staff, so all requests made will be met as much as possible. Children are also treated very favorably. In terms of price, there is one on Ctrip now. Compared with the summer vacation price, I think the two-night package is very suitable and worth a try [Ëâ≤Ëâ≤R]

The hotel is located on a mountain in the suburbs of Anji County. There are security guards at the entrance to verify the names of guests. Non-residents are not allowed to enter the hotel park. We arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock at night, and the little girl at the front desk came out to help us unload our luggage and deliver it to the room. As soon as we entered the room, we saw big and plump welcome fruits. We were told that the drinks and snacks in the minibar were free. When I walked around the hotel the next day, I found that as soon as we showed up, the staff would immediately stand up and look at us and proactively ask if we needed any help. They were very enthusiastic. They gave us Anji white tea when we left and watched our car leave. It felt very good. good.
In addition, there is the fragrance of osmanthus everywhere in their hotel environment. It is no exaggeration to say that people are really intoxicated by the fragrance of flowers.
Finally, I will show you their heated swimming pool. It is large and clean. Because there are few guests, I can enjoy it alone most of the time. The swimming pool is the best value for money.

The surrounding environment is refreshing and refreshing, and I can let go of the impetuousness of the city and feel at ease. Short here. The hotel has water features, rice fields and natural streams. It is very healing and it is very enjoyable to take a stroll around in the car. The front desk staff are very enthusiastic, and the details are very good, which makes people feel warm. Wait for the autumn harvest to come again.

I like the space of the book bar. The slippers provided in the room are of good quality, the paper towels are very thick and feel good to use. The essential oils in the toiletries are fragrant, which I like. The overall management is not the mature management of a luxury hotel, but every service staff is sincere and responds to everything. Thank you.

First of all, the hotel is so beautiful, everything is natural, harmonious, and green. Although the hotel is a bit difficult to find, I felt it was worth coming here the next day. It's very quiet and suitable for bringing the family. The hotel room is very spacious, bright and well-organized. It can be seen that a lot of thought has been put into it. The bed is very comfortable. There is also a large terrace. The most valuable thing is that the service is really full marks. Every staff member will smile and say hello when I meet them. The front desk butler has been serving me since I started adding WeChat. If I need anything, I will respond in minutes. I can‚Äôt praise you enough. I always respond to your requests. Later, I met a lady from the lobby manager who took us around the hotel to introduce us. I felt that the hotel really took too much effort and my family was very satisfied. I decided to continue our stay and loved it!

msg:Stayed on a Thursday night and the hotel staff were helpful with luggage and very kind.
The room is very big. We have a baby and chose a small courtyard. If the curtains of the mountain view room are opened, people outside will see it. The privacy is a bit bad. The garden view room is a small enclosed courtyard, but there are steps in the room to bring the baby. Be careful. There are many things in the minibar, all of which are free to use. Slippers and toothbrushes are carefully customized, and the shampoo and shower gel are all from Ferragamo.
There was no food around, so we had two meals at the hotel restaurant Liyuan. We had lunch and dinner on the day we arrived, and with a baby over one year old, the restaurant provided us with steamed eggs and porridge for free. (Maoxuewang is very spicy, and some of the dishes are too small. For this price, I think it shouldn‚Äôt be stressful if you give me more portions.)
Because it was a working day, the swimming pool and the children's toy room were both reserved. The baby did not dare to go in the pool. There was a staff member who was really nice and helped us get the baby used to playing in the pool (unfortunately, I did not see the name clearly, thank you very much) ).
There is a stream in the hotel where you can catch fish, but the stream is very icy. I stayed there for a day and did not leave the hotel. There was a typhoon the next day, so I left the hotel at noon and went to Hangzhou. There is also a souvenir, which is quite thoughtful. When we arrived in Hangzhou, the hotel told us that we had left the diaper pad behind and sent it home via SF Express. The service was very good!
The summary is to stay away from the hustle and bustle. I got off the highway and drove ten kilometers into the mountains. After leaving the hotel, I also drove ten kilometers on the winding mountain road in the mountains. It was pretty good and suitable for a leisure vacation.

msg:The environment is excellent, it feels like retreating to the mountains and rivers, the temperature is also very good, and the room facilities are very satisfactory. It is very worth coming. Let‚Äôs evaluate it objectively.

A place with a poor experience... As a hotel like this, I think it should not be there. I went on vacation with my friends. We booked a double room with mountain view for two nights. The same room type and the same price were treated differently. It was the first time I had a very bad experience. It was also the first time I wrote a negative review on Ctrip. I booked the same room at that time. When I checked into the hotel, I was also wondering why there was no butler to connect with me. Later, I chatted with a friend and found out that after he made the reservation, the butler added him on WeChat, but I didn‚Äôt. It didn‚Äôt matter, it didn‚Äôt matter. It was very late and I was very tired and didn‚Äôt want to go out for dinner. , I was alone with an elderly person and a child. I was thinking that there were instant noodles in the snack bar. There were not enough instant noodles. I called for two buckets. Then the front desk said that six buckets had been delivered. It was not unlimited, and the tone was not too loud. Okay, I'm really drunk. We only have two buckets in the room. Otherwise, you can charge for it. Can't you see? Rooms booked by different accounts don't have upfront service. Just ask for instant noodles. Instant noodles will be given to you. Forget it, but this attitude is not just towards me. My friend ordered drinks and snacks several times but nothing happened. What‚Äôs even weirder is that there was no dedicated housekeeper until I arrived. If you say If you think we are together, please ask your friend if there is a humidifier in the room but we don‚Äôt have one. Then if you think we are not together, then it is inconsistent. What‚Äôs even more weird is that we have the habit of morning exercise. It‚Äôs dark when we go to the gym in the morning. There is no one at the front desk and there is only one cleaning person. The sanitation aunt asked me how to turn on the lights in the gym, but she said she didn't go to work. She said she would go and ask, but when she came back she told me to look for it myself, but I had no choice but to run around the yard. Later, when I went to work at the front desk, I told the front desk that I needed the gym the next day. The lights were turned on the next morning, but I fiddled with all the equipment myself for a long time before turning it on. It‚Äôs more fun to leave the hotel and check out, and surround your friends‚Äô cars as if I were a passerby. Is my car just for carrying luggage? The souvenirs were delivered to my friend's car. My friend told me that they were only delivered to our room. I just wanted to say that it is really good for you to provide services with colored glasses like this. I spent 5,000 to 6,000 yuan to enjoy a less than five-star service. Fortunately, the natural environment is good, which makes up for some discomfort, but I still wrote it in the hope of attracting attention.

The summer outdoor barbecue dinner as the sun set was particularly unforgettable. The scenery was beautiful, the food was beautiful, and the staff also prepared mosquito repellent water in advance for everyone to use.
During your stay, you can basically relax in the room. There are fresh seasonal fruits every day. I don‚Äôt know the brand of bedding but it is very comfortable and easy to sleep. The house has its own small courtyard. You can feel the birdsong and green shade outside in the early morning.
We had a night at KTV with friends. We all had a great time, and the service staff stayed with us until midnight. Before leaving, he told us to remember to bring our belongings with us.
The cigar bar is so beautiful! Worth taking photos and checking in!
It was a perfect trip. I felt the dedication of the hotel management team. I will take my family to check in again next time.

Although autumn is the best scenery and feeling, I still feel as good as ever every time I come here. The service is still the most satisfactory I have ever stayed in. Just like the service system of St. Regis and Ritz, it should be due to the very small number of rooms in the hotel that the team can serve every guest. Angelia, the receptionist this time, was also very considerate. I still love the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. If there is a Michelin rating in Zhejiang, this restaurant is definitely worth mentioning. The food is better than the restaurants I usually eat in Shanghai, because it is deep in the mountains and the ingredients are guaranteed. This time we were going with two people, so we didn‚Äôt bother the restaurant to customize the dishes, we just chose according to the menu. Last time I stayed in a courtyard room because I couldn't book a room with a scenic view. Instead, I fell in love with the courtyard design. It was simple and comfortable to make tea and drink. Looking forward to Bai Cui in autumn~~

msg:It feels like a small Kyoto. After the lights are turned on at night, the experience is better than that in the daytime, and the pictures are very good. The courtyard room on the first floor has a good sense of space. It is indeed more ventilated than the mountain view room on the second floor, but it is not very suitable for parents and children because of the steps. Young children must be careful. There is also a sound from the air conditioner, which affects the rest a bit. It is best to solve it. The bedding is comfortable, and the drinks and snacks in the minibar are all imported, which is very generous. I personally don't like the fragrance of the toiletries Ferragamo, it's too strong, so I didn't ask the hotel for another brand because of the trouble. It is recommended to prepare some refreshing toiletries. The activity space on the first floor is very well done, especially the book bar, where there are various pieces for entertainment. The children's playground can be further strengthened. The water quality of the swimming pool is very clean, and the changing room is also very convenient, but the black walls on the three sides of the swimming pool and the ceiling are a little depressing. If the ceiling is decorated and the lights are brighter, the experience may be better. The restaurant is very good, delicious and inexpensive, and children like it too. Originally, I was worried that there were few varieties of breakfast, but in fact, it was quite rich, and I was very full. Western breakfast could add some more categories. The service is generally more professional. It is recommended to introduce some hotel facilities and nearby viewing points when guests check in. The Bamboo Viewing Pavilion on the opposite mountain is not to be missed, and it is excellent to see the bamboo sea in the mountains. There is a souvenir when you leave the store, although it is just some souvenirs, it feels warm. All in all, a good experience, I hope to make persistent efforts.

They are all high-end fruits of the season, including drinks and snacks, which are free of charge after being eaten. The garden of the hotel is very artistic, with small bridges and flowing water, and the fragrance of flowers is pleasant, which makes people linger.

msg:For Erbao‚Äôs birthday, I‚Äôm going to choose a hotel to spend a holiday to celebrate. I found it by accident. I felt very evasive. When I came, I chose Shanlu Village Road. The road is picturesque and the mountains and rivers are all in doubt. The willows and the flowers are bright and another village, and finally came here. The resort is surrounded by mountains. There are quiet green rice fields and gurgling streams in the resort. It feels a bit Ubud. There are few rooms in the hotel and the service is very good. Whether it is the room aunt or the doorman, it gives people a cordial feeling. , Responsive, the former arranged a perfect birthday room for us, and the latter guided us to the nearby observation deck. The scenery above can‚Äôt be described in words, so I suggest you feel it. The girl at the front desk is very nice, I added WeChat early, communication is barrier-free, especially like the waiter at the book bar, when the children quietly served two cups of refreshing lemonade when they were practicing calligraphy, it was just right after they finished copying Being able to quench thirst, this kind of initiative and sense of distance service has gradually disappeared in many standard five-stars. The waiter in the restaurant also understands us very well. I was very satisfied with dining in the hotel these past two days. The birthday noodles and cakes presented are very good. Attentive. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is very exquisite, Chinese style is better than Western style, the two types of noodles, the village sausage is very tasty, the beef is very strong, Huzhou big wonton is our favorite, the quality of freshly squeezed juice is very high, reaching the standard of luxury hotels, Benny Dick still needs to improve. At lunch and dinner, the restaurant's dishes are pretty good. The family set meal is very Anji, very Huzhou, it is worth a try. The swimming pool is also a beautiful spot in his house. In the past two years, only Bulgari in the magic capital, Xitang Liangyang, and Sanya Capella have a water quality comparable to here. The three swimming in three days are all private. There are props and it is very entertaining. Well, the aunt at the pool is also good, and she patiently accompanies Xiaobao, so the sense of service is the biggest beauty here. Speaking of our room, it‚Äôs not bad. The second floor reminds me of Alila Angie before. Outside the huge window is a painting. The most impressive thing is his welcome champagne and fruits, not to mention the dazzling array. , The mini is full of sincerity. The children like it very much. It's very pleasant to sleep listening to the frogs and to hear the bird's voice in these two days.

msg:Angela's price, Sheraton's room, Farmhouse's dining: Booked a villa for 7,001 nights. The bathroom space is very small. There is no basic on-demand service on TV. The entire hotel has a restaurant with a Farmhouse menu, which can only eat in the same place every meal. Any recent attractions or restaurants are within an hour's drive. This is the price for staying in Hangzhou Fayun Anzhen, but it has to be several levels above this place in any way.

Very hidden, among the tea hills and bamboo forests, the service is first-rate, better than many domestic five-stars, and it has the advantage of the feeling of service of an island hotel. The room is very clean, the bathroom is very smart, every detail is well done, there is only one restaurant, but they are all grown by the hotel, a bit of a high-end farmhouse feel, organic food, we eat very comfortable, hahaha Thank you very much to the service staff at the front desk and the restaurant, let us spend a pleasant holiday.

msg:I really didn't expect that there would be such a high-class hotel at the end of the village. The scenery is invincible, giving people a particularly peaceful and open feeling. The hotel facilities are also very good, book bars, bars, cinemas, fitness, swimming, etc., everything. The most impressive thing is the restaurant, the ingredients are fresh, each dish has no fancy embellishments, but it is real and tastes good. Especially commendable is the restaurant manager Wang. His service is not stylized politeness, but meticulous warmth. I am very grateful for the service of this Shanghai manager. If you want to say that there is something lacking, it may be that in terms of room cleaning, the cups that guests drink are not washed, and many utensils are not put back in place. When staying in Aman in Tokyo, the guest room cleaning is the kind that puts guests‚Äô headphone cables neatly away. I hope Baicui will get better and better, and we will come back again when we pick tea.

The bathroom hardware in the guest room is very high-end, as well as Ferragamo's toiletries. All drinks in the room are free and there are many types, which are different from ordinary self-service. In the breakfast room, the set meal breakfast is very delicate, there is no noisy environment, the dining experience is very good, and finally white tea is presented as a souvenir when checking out, which is really amazing! Finally, this is an Anji daughter-in-law who took her husband and baby back to Anji to stay at the hotel. Can you understand?

A few of us don't like to be noisy, and would not come to the mountains if it were to be lively. The advantage of the lack of rooms is that the food is good, the small pot rice is quite exquisite, there is no room service in the evening, and the breakfast here is not wasteful. It is good to have enough when you should eat. I like this quiet and comfortable a**osphere.

  Many parts of the hotel reveal the design ideas of perfect integration with the surrounding environment and easy scenery; the decoration and facilities in the rooms also make people feel elegant and comfortable.
  The service staff of the hotel are warm and courteous. We can feel their efforts to improve the quality of service. We are also grateful for all kinds of help and recommendations during our 3-night stay.
  Special thanks to Lily of the restaurant. With her warm service, we enjoyed 3 days of food in the restaurant. We were very satisfied with every meal, and even unlocked the hidden menuüòÉ
  I hope you can keep all the good things as always!
