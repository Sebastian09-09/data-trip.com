msg:We stayed at Citadines Suzhou Jinji Lake for two nights. There is a shopping mall right below the hotel, with lots of restaurants to choose from. The room comes with a washer/dryer which is very handy. However the nearest metro station (Dong Huang Road) is around 800m, which is quite a distance to walk. The room size is very big which has a living area and a separate bedroom. The breakfast menu is limited but the dishes are delicious. We chose a room not facing the overhead highway, avoiding the noise from the high traffic.

msg:We stayed in this hotel for only one night, so it's difficult to give a full review on all available amenities. The overall impression is positive. The breakfast on the 31st floor set up a good mood for the day, the food was just fine. Nothing special, but quite enough for а substantial meal. English speaking staff. the biggest disappointment is the construction works just next to the hotel. If you plan to sleep in the morning, then the hotel is not the best option for that. Sunday morning, they started at 7am =/   

P. S.: CTRIP guaranteed two rewards for this booking: free breakfast and room upgrade. However, the room was the same as we paid for. No problems with free breakfast

Told the front desk (they could check CCTV to see he just sorta watched me). To make amends they sent up some fruit. The room was a good size and clean. The morning buffet is alright but better to get something outside of the hotel as the variety wasn’t too good. Overall a good stay and I would recommend. One downside for sure was the gym / pool. It’s hard to find and the service was terrible. People on their phones until I asked for their attention (just to check details) and they just kept going “Shenme?” Made no effort to help so bailed. It looked pretty filthy as well.

msg:This is  one of those apartment hotels, which means it gives you both a hotel experience & a bit of a home feel. The hotel is beautiful & clean, the bed is comfortable and it has a  kitchen, a washing machine, it is specious & has a lot of natural light coming in through the wide window I had in my chosen room. 

I booked two nights for a staycation and the price was about ¥1300 including breakfast. Breakfast was a mixture of both western & Chinese style. I really cannot complain about the food range. 

The hotel is easy to find as the taxi drops you close by and there are shops downstairs(restaurants, coffee shops & a supermarket) 
On my 2nd night I decided to cook, which was great. 

One of the nights I had a delivery and the gentleman down stairs sent it with a robot. 

The service overall is great. The staff can speak a decent amount of English which made it easy for me as a non Chinese speaker. Because of how central the hotel is I even went to get my nails done, which was at a walking distance. However because of the highway next to the hotel , you can hear the cars so it can be noisy sometimes. 

The hotel has a gym ,an indoor pool ,lounge area ( amongst other things) 

I would recommend this hotel for solo travels, couples and friends. 
I’m giving it 4/5 overall because they will need to have an outdoor pool to get a 5.

It is just a short walk to Fengmen Road. There are no tourists. It is the daily life of Suzhou people. A few steps away is the Twin Towers Market. The cross street is very lively, but it is not the same as before. Suzhou is different now

Facilities: Breakfast is provided, there is a children's room playground, a small outdoor sky garden with a children's playground, and there is usually a gym and swimming pool, but they are located underground (it was not open when we went there, maybe it was closed during the Spring Festival)

msg:The location of this hotel is very good. It is very close to Pingjiang Road and Guanqian Street in the old city. It is about 2 kilometers away. If you want to walk there, it will take about 20 minutes along the road. It is also very convenient to take the bus. I took bus 900 to get there directly. round trip. After all, parking in the old town is not very convenient and is congested. We drove directly to the hotel parking lot and then radiated to the surrounding scenic spots.

You can choose a very high floor in the apar**ent building. We stayed on the 29th floor this time. From the east side room, you can directly see the landmark buildings of Suzhou's Jinji Lake and the sunrise view. The room has a spacious bedroom, living room, and bathroom. Just like a "home" settled in Suzhou

The hotel's breakfast room is on the 31st floor. It's not particularly big. If you avoid the rush hour after nine o'clock, the experience is still good. Under the morning sun, I sat by the window and looked at the cityscape outside the high-rise building, eating breakfast and drinking coffee.

During the morning rush hour, there may not be enough tables when there are many people, and meals may not be served in time. Fortunately, there are many famous Suzhou snacks and noodle restaurants around. If you think about it this way, you don't have to eat too much for breakfast.

Parking in the hotel is also very convenient. The ground parking lot downstairs is preferred. If it is full, you can park in the underground parking lot.

Downstairs is Vanke Plaza, which is very convenient for shopping and eating.

msg:This is the first time I blindly selected a hotel on Ctrip. I chose this hotel because of the large space in the room in the picture. Facts have proved that when the baby grows up and the family is raised, it is really necessary to choose such a serviced apar**ent. The experience of staying here Very comfortable.

The place that gives me the deepest feeling:
One is the hotel's service. From the careful confirmation before check-in to the notes filled in the order, I believe the hotel staff has carefully checked it, so they will patiently call, negotiate the room and finally confirm it.

The second is the hotel environment. In the same location, price and other conditions, the price/performance ratio is still relatively high. Especially during the Chinese New Year, it is rare to be able to live in a room that is comfortable for both the elderly and the young.

Next time I go to Suzhou, I will continue to choose 👍

The reception service is good, but the security guard on the first floor is still a service staff. The service awareness is obviously poor because I have an elderly person, so I push the wheelchair and pull the suitcase. The waiter was trapped at the door step. He stood motionless and looked at me. At that time, I wanted to curse because it was New Year's Eve. I thought about it, but I held it back. If any leaders read the comments and want to know more, they can check your surveillance. A waiter like this is standing at the door and doing it. Just for decoration?

The children have indoor and outdoor play areas, and there are robots that deliver food, so everything is good. If I have to mention the shortcomings, it is that there is no USB interface, the TV cannot cast the screen, and the definition is low. The flaws are not concealed, praise!

The room has been upgraded, with three bedrooms, two living rooms and two bathrooms, which is very suitable for people of the opposite sex in the company to travel together. The living room is huge and the dining table has six stools, which is perfect for our meetings. The kitchen has everything you need, including a refrigerator, dishwasher, cutlery and dishes, so you can prepare a simple meal independently. Returning to the bedroom, the mattresses in all three bedrooms are very comfortable and the height of the bed is also good. After a tiring day at work, I almost fell asleep when I came back to the room. The heating in the room is also very comfortable. The wind is blowing outside and the room is warm. Looking at the lights of thousands of houses and the constant flow of traffic, the scenery is really beautiful.
Suzhou is really beautiful, and so is the hotel. I will stay there again next time I come to Suzhou.

You need to park in the underground garage of the shopping mall. There are very few hotel instructions in the garage. It took me a long time to find it. The hotel's exclusive elevator is even more difficult to find. You can It is said that there is no guidance and it is all up to self-exploration. I had high expectations for the room after looking at the pictures on the Internet, but I was a little disappointed when I swiped my card to enter. The decoration of the facilities feels very old, and it can be said to be worn out. The leather of the sofa in the living room is all cracked and damaged. It felt dirty and greasy. The sound of the air conditioner is also very loud. We were all noisy by the air conditioner at night and didn't sleep well. If I come next time, I'm sure I won't be able to decide on this one. The only good possibility is the view, which are all large floor-to-ceiling windows, and the scenery seen is good.

The breakfast is not bad. Judging from the five-star standard, the options are not particularly rich, but it is enough to eat. The current Soviet-style fine noodles and shepherd's purse small wontons are delicious.
The swimming pool is a shortcoming. An apar**ent hotel of this level should not have such a swimming pool. The water in the pool is okay, but the bathing area is really not clean. The swimming pool is outsourced and filled with children learning to swim. The density is too high and it is impossible to swim well. These days we just soak in the swimming pool and kick our legs to consume some of the calories accumulated from eating Suzhou delicacies for days. .
Because I am very satisfied with the room conditions and room service, I still give it full marks. But the swimming pool is really a bug. It is recommended that the brand consider reclaiming the management right and full use right of the swimming pool.

The walk from the underground garage to the elevator is very dilapidated, and there is a clear smell of urine at the entrance to the employee passage. .
The rooms are large, which is rare, but the toilet in one bedroom is broken. . The front desk on the first night was not very proactive in dealing with the problem and said it was a concession. .
When I extended my stay, the guy at the front desk was kind and offered breakfast.
Kitchen utensils and cutlery are all available.
On the last day, I met the store manager. His service and attitude were very good, and he even showed us the night view.
Breakfast is on the top floor. There are not many types of breakfast. The beauty is the view. The noodle cooker is a bit puzzling. If you are polite to her, she will not be very nice and impatient. Later, if you don’t use polite words to her, her attitude will change. Better. .
Many Japanese people probably cooperate with Japanese companies.

It is a bit old but the room is relatively large, the service is attentive, the parking is convenient, the surrounding commercial facilities are mature, and it is not far from the scenic spots, but some details need to be paid attention to, and the towels are all thread-lined. , obviously lowered the grade, hope to pay more attention to it in the future

msg:In fact, the overall facilities of the hotel are okay, but the operation of the front desk staff is really unsatisfactory. On the day of check-in, I said that I had two orders. Could you help me with the room card for two days? I was told that it was not possible due to system problems. Then the next morning I went to the front desk to make a room card, and a guy with a pot head at the front desk couldn't find my reservation after searching for a long time, and asked me to show him the order on my mobile phone. I confirmed two orders with the front desk two days before check-in and on the day of check-in. Then make sure it's okay. I turned on the phone and showed it to him. Then I asked what time was the breakfast. He said he wanted to check for me if there was breakfast. I asked again what time was the breakfast, but he still insisted on it. First make sure I have breakfast, and then continue to check. I ask a third time, can you tell me the breakfast time? He noticed that I was a little impatient, and then told me the time in an even more impatient tone. What does it have to do with whether I have breakfast or not and you telling me the time? And I made sure that there would be breakfast on both days. After finishing the application, he gave us the room card and we went to have breakfast. When I gave the breakfast coupon, I realized that he had not given us the breakfast for the next day after making the card. I went down to look for him again. I was afraid that it would take too long to explain clearly to him. After we were done, we went back to the room and continued to sleep. Before nine o'clock, the guest room staff came and rang the doorbell and said they wanted to clean. I asked them to come back later. At almost 11 o'clock that night, the front desk called me again to confirm whether I had booked an extra room and whether I was staying or anything. When checking out, the front desk said it was okay to leave. Halfway through our car, he told me that the room fee for the next day would need to be paid by the front desk. I asked if it could be deducted from the security deposit. It was finally resolved and I felt like I was staying. It’s not easy to own a hotel, this kind of management is so scary😱

You can reach Changtai Expressway and turn a corner. Parking is also very convenient. There are enough parking spaces, both on the ground and underground. The service is also very good. When I checked out, I asked the tourist information around the front desk. The young man also reminded me that the license plate outside the city is restricted. The only downside is that the facilities are old. The coffee machine is not a capsule machine, and you have to prepare powder and filter paper yourself.

The room manager didn't even know the layout of the room, so he had to say that there was only one room with twin beds. I was speechless. I couldn't count. Count? ? ? The room manager was drunk because he didn't know the layout of the room. Well, it was okay, but some problems were really intolerable.
1⃣️The sanitary conditions are indescribable. There was dust under the bathrobe and only the surface was cleaned.
2⃣️I don’t understand why the blackout curtains in the bedroom should be shorter. Since the light must be blocked and a section of the window has to leak out, what does it mean? At 5 o’clock in the morning, the room looks like daytime. How can I sleep?
3⃣️Breakfast is very simple, very little, and not delicious.
4⃣️The front desk service is really speechless. There is no mineral water in the room. Please contact me to send a few bottles. I have already emphasized that there are 6 people there. The front desk asked if 4 bottles are enough... I am really speechless.
5⃣️The kitchen countertops are all sticky, probably caused by long-term rentals.

I didn’t want to do it. , that meatball head had a straight face, as if he owed her money. Do you come to the hotel to see people's faces? ? ? ? The service was good when checking out. When I checked in, I thought the quality of the whole store was poor, but it seems that it is just a person. Sincerely give the hotel an opinion: the hotel room is really big and spacious, but the service needs to be improved! I spent money, just for a membership card with a straight face, do I owe you? 😡

msg:During the epidemic, this is the worst Ascott I have ever stayed in. 1. I made a reservation almost a week in advance, and the hotel had enough time to inform me in advance that the staff was sunny and there was basically no service, so that I could modify the itinerary. When I arrived at the hotel, it was said that there was no room cleaning There is no dine-in service and no night service; 2. The security management is extremely chaotic. When I checked in, the security guard asked me to register before I could enter. I explained that I was a guest, and the front desk of the hotel had to register once, but the security guard insisted that I had to register first, and even asked the hotel The front desk was unwilling; the restaurant was not open during the epidemic. After ordering takeaway, I asked the front desk to tell the security guard to let the robot deliver it for me. After waiting for almost an hour, I had to go down to get it in slippers. The security guard I said that there is no room number so I won’t send it away. I said that I told the front desk, won’t you ask more questions? The answer is that we don't care. 3. The food brought for breakfast on two days is cold, and the coffee is also cold; 4. The water provided by the hotel is different from other Ascotts. Ice dew, more than four bottles of water will be charged a day, I say you guys If there is no service, I will be charged as much as the room rate, so why not count; the coffee is also Nescafe instant. I would like to believe that the epidemic is the main reason for this situation, but under the same epidemic, the overall service of Ascott Wuxi, which I just visited, is much better, and there are not so many unreasonable service problems due to the epidemic.

msg:Living nearby, relatives at home, temporarily booked. I haven't noticed this place for so many years. I heard that it has been open for eight or nine years. I was shocked. The room facilities and equipment are slightly old, but the maintenance is ok. The home appliances and furniture are very complete. It is too wasteful to live alone. Downstairs parking is very convenient, but it is inconvenient to enter the underground garage. No one answered the doorbell, and only after calling the front desk did someone come down to open the door. During the epidemic, there are many things to check, one code on the left and one nucleic acid on the right, but the girl at the front desk has been patiently explaining and arranged room upgrades. The gym and swimming pool did not go, but there were a lot of people passing by from the ba*****t. If I didn't eat breakfast, I won't make a comment. Check out is also very convenient, the room card is placed in the room, just make a phone call, and deduct it directly from the deposit. The overall is OK, the service pulls up the hardware. Will come next time.

I booked two rooms for two nights a month in advance, and required non-smoking and high floors. The hotel replied "as much as possible" to be satisfied. I arrived at the hotel reception in the afternoon. There was no guest at that time. The front desk said the room was still being cleaned. It was full today. I arranged for you on the 12th floor (total 30 floors, and half of the 12th floor is not here). I said I would just have one month in advance. I booked a note and asked for a higher floor... Before I finished speaking, the front desk directly interrupted me and said that our hotel responded as much as possible, but there is no guarantee. Confidently, without any explanation or apology.
And as soon as the elevator exited the 12th floor, an unpleasant smell mixed with the smell of smoke in the corridor. None of the requirements of "high floors" or "smoke-free" were met.

Next, let’s talk about the room. The picture above is old. It is old and has a problem with the layout. The bed is directly facing the door and it is very uncomfortable to sleep. The big bed is made up of two beds. The water delivered is ice dew, which is provided by the Express Hotel.

Besides the gym swimming pool, absolutely, in the ba*****t, there is a very unpleasant and disgusting musty smell.
What kind of experience is fitness in mold? I will take you to evaluate it today.

If you want to swim and keep fit, don’t choose this one
If you want five-star facilities, don't choose this one

msg:1.酒店的設備都很陳舊，衞生情況不能細看。
2.酒店早餐在節假日高峯期根本來不及補貨，而且根本沒啥可吃的，還不如經濟型連鎖酒店。
3.預訂的時候留言要樓層高一些，店家答應了，結果到了安排最低層，而且充滿煙味，帶着孩子衹能要求換房，店家滿足了，但沒有同房型，換了單人套房，也不提退差價。
下次不會再來，要帶娃的家庭慎重。

設施：酒店設施齊全。
衞生：作為有一點年數的酒店的通病，有些角落會有點積灰
環境：下面就是萬科的購物中心，非常方便，就是樓下是高架，較低層數可能會有些些吵。
服務：十分完美，有任何需求都會快速回應，感謝前台讓我們延遲至下午兩點退房

缺點: 
房間裏插座極少，床頭沒法充電，前台把枱燈拔了才能充
電話是小靈通，不能離開底座太久會沒電
電視機音響都是大牌，但是像素非常低並且沒法看電視衹能看碟片但有沒有碟片
床頭對着一個衣帽間，沒有門，關了燈以後黑黝黝的空間緊挨着枕頭，心裏害怕睡不着衹能挪床
一個房間衹給一個房卡，再要一張沒有
挨着高架，車流聲比較明顯
浴室龍頭很舊出水量小

優點
廚房用品很齊全，空間大，落地窗，床品尚可，價格不貴，較乾淨，好停車，二樓花園風景怡人

msg:第二次入住Ascott，這次入住時間比較久，幾個不滿意的細節。 

1）提供的一次性拖鞋居然是那種帶絨的冬天用的拖鞋，在40度高温的情況下，即便屋子裡開着空調，穿着一雙帶絨麪的拖鞋，也是一種中暑的感受，腳上火辣辣。打電話到前台，説沒法換，最後衹能在樓下自己買了一雙塑料拖鞋。一種匪夷所思的執拗。

2）打掃服務的阿姨在早上會不斷敲門，而且敲2次沒人回答以後就直接開門進來，直到看到我了才一陣亂呼。後來幾天這個情況得以改善，但清潔員也會多次敲門，並且告知自己5:30要下班。這在另外的酒店是不可想象的。住客的時間要跟着清潔員來。

3）疫情期間，叫外賣的住客比較多，而樓下又衹有一個送餐機器人，每次餐到樓下要等30分鐘左右才送上來。為何不能增加1-2個機器人？而要冒着犧牲客户體驗的風險，維持不變？ 

4）退房的當天，已經提前説了要推遲到2:00退房，結果1：30左右還是接到電話，冷冰冰的説我們這裏超過2點系統就自動扣一天房費。這也是在我住過的同檔次酒店裡沒有見到過的。

5）早餐的質量和數量令人堪憂，還不如不辦此項目了

6）我住的那個套房，裏面有一個洗碗機，本來想用一下，問有沒有洗碗粉，樓下説沒有，這是某一個住店的客人自己裝的。我無言以對。那為什麼不拆了呢？那我退房了以後也不要還原了嘛，下一個客人直接來住。

一點建議：服務式公寓裏會放很多鍋碗瓢盆，但仔細一看污漬油漬隨處可見。完全可以放在庫房裡，在房間提供清單，要什麼再送上來，放在那裡沾灰，極為不智。

바로 옆 상가에는 맥도날드와 슈퍼 마켓 그리고 식당들이 있어 불편함이 없습니다.
위치가 살짝 애매한 것 같지만 택시를 이용하면 대부분 15분 이내로 이동이 가능합니다 (랜드마크 및 한국성)
방이 무척 크고 주방과 세탁기가 있어 출장시 아주 좋은 컨디션을 유지하는데 도움이 됩니다.
가격 대비 만족도와 좋은 시설을 이용하고 싶다면 애스콧 미드타운 쑤저우를 추천합니다

酒店緊鄰高架，晚上噪音很大!！影響休息！
房間設施很老很舊很破！並且隔音做的也很不好，很多窗户都漏風！
空調無法正常使用，要麼開着聲音很大，無法調節風量大小，最後衹能關了空調睡覺！
因為相信雅詩閣這個品牌，才來住的！
這樣的裝修設施，竟然不翻新，真的很讓人失望！！！
完全不值得這個價格來住這！！！

預訂的時候上面寫的面積很大，但是，，，它毫無設計和佈局，就感覺地方都浪費了……起碼同類型的，都會分個那種客廳和卧室的感覺。這個就整個連在一起
電視那邊什麼藍牙音響，房間裏沒有遙控器，要問前台要…那不如不裝
窗户很大，風景很差。無錫雅詩閣景色就很好看，這家，這窗户沒意義啊……
早飯也很一般。沒啥吃的。

酒店存在的問題：
1.與預期相去甚遠，五星級價格，服務為零，也沒有大堂
2.房間有濃重煙味
3.浴室毛巾泛黃，不衞生
4.門鈴壞了，摁不響
5.早餐很一般
6.酒店位置在高架旁，影響休息
7.座椅年久塌陷
以上所説，真實可信！
