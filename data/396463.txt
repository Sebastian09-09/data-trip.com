msg:The location is very nice but our room faced another building which was not the best view possible. Anyway, despite the big amount of visitors, the manager helped us to change room and provided us a better service. The swimming pool was super cold, which clearly was not suitable for me and my kids. Breakfast on the average for this level of hotel. After all I believe the price was too high compared with other hotels in the same area. I want to prize the manager and for his support, but generally I would not recommend this hotel.

It's a bit old, but everything was fine for me so far, so nothing to complain.
There is also a restaurant and a club lounge, but I haven't visited them, neither the pool or the gym.

msg:First off, I want to say that the housekeeping department was wonderful. They were not only great cleaners but they were also very thoughtful about checking when we would be out of the room during the day if they happened to show up when we were there. A few other things that were great about the hotel: the spectacular location (it's near so many great restaurants in a very walkable area), the big empty swimming pool with a view of the city, the generosity with face masks, and all staff seemed well trained in hospitality... 

So it breaks my heart that our arrival at the hotel so completely marred our stay. 

When my kids and I walked into the hotel one of the staff--I'm afraid I didn't catch her name in my shock, but I believe she was the manager on duty--grabbed a handful of gloves and handed them to us as we were still struggling to pull out all the green codes required of us (we were told to show two codes initially and then later would go through many more codes in a quest to see which would be accepted). She started the conversation by asking if we were leaving and when we said we were checking in, she asked to see the tracing app and immediately declared all the places we had been to as dangerous (the app was green and there were no asterisks at that point, I would later gain an asterisk thanks to being in Wuhan). They were not. We had travelled carefully, tracking the news of outbreaks and did our best to avoid all dangerous locations and crowds. We explained this to her and walked her through every place on our trip that we had been, but she refused to accept any of this. She kept insisting everywhere we had been was dangerous. It didn't matter to her how many green codes we had. We were foreigners that had come to Wuhan from a city in Jiangsu, taking a route that travelled near provinces where there were COVID-19 cases, and that meant we were dangerous.

I want to be sympathetic. People in Wuhan had a much worse 2020 than anyone else in China. I can only imagine how terrifying it must be to have another significant outbreak a year later (we further had the bad luck of arriving in Wuhan on the same day as new cases). The hotel staff gave us a free fruit plate and they gave my daughter a stuffed animal, which she adored. 

But I was also travelling alone with two kids who were so traumatized by the experience (they were worried that we would be taken to a hospital or quarantine center and separated for who-knows-how-long) that they initially refused to eat dinner and still talk about the experience a week later (it didn't help that they noticed a Chinese guest arrive and check in without a face mask while we were still being interrogated with gloves and masks on and waited for a doctor to come and clear us).

When the kids finally did decide they would eat, so long as we didn't leave the hotel, we discovered there was no longer ocean fish or seafood on the menu because of the virus which was interesting because we would find plenty of places outside the hotel that still offered salmon. Later when we tried to go to the Thai restaurant in the ball, we were told it was not open to us because of COVID-19 restrictions even though two lovely ladies who looked shocked to see us in the elevator were welcomed in. I assume there was some small private engagement or meeting that wasn't open to the public as there was no information anywhere that said the hotel restaurant was closed to the public.

So I am divided on my feelings on this hotel. I want to believe it is a well run hotel and we were just unlucky to arrive on the wrong day. I can't really see myself staying here again if I return to Wuhan. My kids and I didn't really feel welcome here.

msg:It was a very comfortable trip. I felt the five-star quality of the hotel when I checked in. Manager Liu in the lobby gave me a warm reception. He knew that my sister and I were visiting Wuhan for the first time, so he specially chose Howard Johnson River View Room and upgraded our room. He also recommended nearby check-in spots for experiencing the culture of breakfast the next day, and sent us evening fruit. All problems encountered during check-in were solved promptly and enthusiastically. The hotel has an absolutely favorable geographical location and a first-line river view. You can lie down and enjoy the light show. If you are not a very picky tourist (because it is an old five-star hotel, the decoration and facilities are indeed a bit old, but it is also for this reason that the hotel can be said to have the top geographical location in Hankou), it is definitely the first choice hotel for traveling in Wuhan. Howard Johnson will still be my first choice next time I come to Wuhan! :)

Although the room is not big, it is still comfortable. The hair dryer is a bit lame and the power is too small. The hygiene conditions can be improved. The toiletries are from L'Occitane, which is OK.
The service is also good. It's just that when I checked out at the end, I was checking out with a male staff member, and I asked about how long it would take for the deposit to be refunded. A girl wearing glasses and a low ponytail next to me answered impatiently, frowning, and anxiously. Girl, what are you worried about? Bring your bad mood to work.
In general, it is a very cost-effective hotel. I highly recommend staying in this hotel when you come to Wuhan.

My mood changed with the lights, which was also a different kind of enjoyment. It was mainly quiet, which was completely different from watching the noisy scene on the cruise ship. Looking down from a high place, I wonder what wonderful poems the ancient poets would have written if they could have such a view.

msg:We booked an executive room and two business rooms for this trip. The price/performance ratio of the rooms starting from 1,200 during holidays is a bit poor. The main problem is that the room facilities are aging. After the door is closed, there is always a sound when the door is opened and closed next door, and it vibrates. I always feel that someone is pushing the door in. The reason for the deposit of more than 1,200 for the business room is that the drinks in the mini bar are charged, so the deposit is required, which is a bit petty. The service is warm, the hygiene is good, and the location is good, which is the advantage of the hotel. The breakfast should be rich. If it is off-season, the price/performance ratio here is still quite high.

Opposite the hotel is the river beach, and it is one stop away from Lihuangpi Road. There are still many petty bourgeoisie and young restaurants and bars around. 
In terms of transportation, although there is a bus stop at the door (you can take it to Gude Temple, Wuhan Tiandi, Lihuangpi Road, Wuhan Customs, Jianghan Road Pedestrian Street, Qingchuan Pavilion, Guishan, Yangtze River Bridge and other attractions), it is still far from Metro Line 6 or 8. It takes at least 15-20 minutes to walk. It is recommended to take a taxi to various attractions in Wuchang! 
During the holiday, Yanjiang Avenue is still quite congested!

In terms of location, the most important thing to consider is that it is close to the starting point. If you are just traveling, this hotel is far from the subway station. I have not been to the nearest Sanyang Road subway station during the whole journey, but there are several bus stations around, and it is still better to go to some places in Hankou. more convenient
The appearance of this hotel is still very grand. It has a big golden ball as a revolving restaurant. It is golden during the day and colorful at night. This is very popular with the elderly. Although the internal facilities are relatively old, speaking from the experience of staying in many five-star hotels, this place is very good. It's very clean and sanitary. The facilities are a bit old and acceptable.
Moreover, when checking in, the front desk staff specifically explained that the hotel is a bit old. The bathroom is a bathtub type and not a dry and wet separate shower room. The elderly are reminded to be careful. This is very sense. The service is in place, including the room cleaning lady who comes to ask if the hygiene situation is satisfactory after check-in. I am very satisfied with the fact that the staff at the coffee bar at the gate have provided good service.
You must take the sightseeing elevator once to see the night view of the Yangtze River. It is a worthwhile trip.
The only hope is to improve and get a few standard rooms as river view rooms. Otherwise, if friends are traveling or parents and children are traveling, they will only have city views. It is a pity.

msg:The price is less than 1,000 yuan, including breakfast for two and a lounge, and the overall cost performance is good. Let me talk about a few areas that I think need improvement. When the receptionist saw my car coming, he turned around and walked away. I'm not saying that I need someone to help me open the door, but isn't this his job? The breakfast variety is not very rich, just average. The signal coverage on the high floors seems to be a bit problematic, and the 5g signal is really bad.

Seeing that I was taking care of my children and it was the Lantern Festival, the lady at the front desk even upgraded my room for me. The view from the business river view room was really unbeatable. Opposite is the Hankou River Beach, and across the street is Wuhan's "Ice and Snow World", where children can ski and have snowball fights. Had a great time. There are many local specialty restaurants in Wuhan on the street next to the hotel, and you can experience the taste of Wuhan people.

   The hotel service is very good. On the first day, there was a hotel service staff at the door to pick up the luggage. When I came back from playing in the middle of the night, I saw the service staff were still at the door. They were so dedicated. I really want to give them a thumbs up👍🏻. I especially want to praise the aunt who cleans the room on the 24th floor. Every night when I come back, I see neatly folded clothes and a clean and tidy room. My cosmetics are placed on the bathroom sink, and the water from washing my face always gets there. Yes, there is always water at the bottom of the cosmetics. At first, I used two small towels to cushion them. When I came back the next day, I saw a large towel spread by the aunt on the left side of the sink. All the cosmetics were on top of the towels, big and small. I have stayed in small hotels a lot, and this is the first time I have seen such a careful aunt! Thumbs up for Auntie’s dedication and meticulousness! The staff at the front desk were also great. We originally took the high-speed train at 4:30 in the afternoon, but the check-out time was 12 o'clock. There would be no room for a long time in the middle. After coordinating with the hotel, they changed our check-out time to 3 o'clock. Fang is very reasonable, thank you very much.
   The overall facilities of the room are very complete, as can be seen in the video. I am really satisfied with the hotel during my trip to Wuhan. I recommend everyone to stay here! ! ! (Not a shill!) I will come back to Wuhan! !

The service is also super considerate. The service at Howard Johnson in Wuhan is more cordial and considerate than the service at international hotels in other cities.
Special thanks to Ms. Wu Shuang from the front office for her reception and service. The girl is very meticulous and attentive. Her sincere smile cannot be faked.

From the room, you can see the Dujiang Tower and the Flood Monument with Chairman Mao's inscription in front of you. The lights on the Wuhan River are beautiful. The hotel is very convenient to everywhere. My son and I were tired of walking around Jianghanguan and had to wait in line for a taxi during peak hours. We took the bus directly to the hotel downstairs for only 1 yuan and only took a few minutes. After dinner, it only takes a few minutes to walk from the hotel to the river bank opposite. It is so pleasant to be surrounded by the river and the wind. The breakfast at the hotel was quite satisfactory. The hot dry noodles tasted good, but the lady who made the hot dry noodles was a bit stiff. The layout of the room is spacious, reasonable and comfortable, and the view is excellent. Sitting by the window and looking far into the distance is what you want. The front desk service is warm and meticulous, which doubles your favorability. I really like the unique architectural appearance of the hotel. A pearl is particularly dazzling at night. You can also take the hotel sightseeing elevator from the 1st floor to the 40th floor, where you can gradually see the entire city, which is very interesting. If you come to Wuhan for the first time, you will definitely not be disappointed if you can stay at Howard Johnson Pearl Hotel.

msg:In addition to the good location and easy access to the river beach, there are other things that are hard to describe. 1. The front desk service is very poor. When checking in at 9 o'clock on Saturday night, a man and a woman at the front desk had a straight face and showed no expression during the whole process. The waitress was as reluctant as a puppet. Just don't go to work. After all, it's an international chain hotel, not even as good as the front desk of the All Seasons Hanting, let alone Atour. 2. The room facilities are poor. The room is like a guest house. The decoration style is in the 1980s. The TV is so small that it is difficult to watch. 3. Takeout is not delivered. You have to pick it up at the table outside the gate every time. Now hotel chains have robots that deliver food. This hotel is too inhumane. 4. Breakfast is not worth 100 yuan. I booked a breakfast for 100 yuan in a hotel that originally cost 500 yuan. I regret it. It’s not too early to go out to eat special snacks when you come to Wuhan. Anyway, it’s all awkward and I won’t come back again. Howard Johnson is really not as good as Atour, and the service is really mediocre.

msg:We stayed in a river view room, and we were given a free upgrade. The room was very large, and it was very friendly for me to travel with my mother. The view is also very good.
There were a few problems. The two-meter large bed. When we went to bed on the first night, we found that there was only one quilt, so we asked the front desk to deliver it. I called around 23:45 and waited for about 30 minutes. I myself I feel like the wait is a bit long. Maybe it was also because it was night, so the person on duty had to be woken up. I'm sorry in my heart, but as a very sleepy person, I think it would be better if it could be done faster.
The Vienna coffee coupons were given on the last day. There wasn’t much to drink. We went down at 9 o’clock on time and wanted to check out after finishing the coffee. We were told that coffee would take 20 minutes to prepare and tea would also take a while to prepare. Since we planned to leave at 10 o'clock, we only asked for soda water. So if coffee can’t be served at 9 o’clock, why does it say it starts at 9 o’clock?
When I left, I saw other guests smoking nearby. It was obviously a no-smoking area. I also asked the guy at the cafe, "Aren't you going to stop it?" He looked embarrassed and told me very hesitantly, "I will, I will." The smoking customer must have been sitting there for more than half an hour. As for smoking, I didn't pay close attention to how long I smoked.

msg:It's great to come here. The hotel faces west and is located on the Yanjiang Avenue in Hankou. Across the road from the hotel entrance is the river beach. There are ferries that can take you to the two rivers at night. Not far from the hotel to the west is Jianghan Pass, where there are museums, supermarkets, and the famous Bagong's house.
The interior of the hotel is very clean, and there is gurgling water in the lobby. The room layout is reasonable, with large floor-to-ceiling windows, where you can comfortably cuddle up on the sofa and watch the sunset, the traffic and the rolling river. And the round ball design on the top of the hotel is a highlight. No matter how far I wander at night, I can find the flashing ball just by looking at it.
The hotel has complete facilities, including bars, coffee shops, and tea rooms. There is a revolving restaurant on the 41st floor on the top, where you can have a leisurely dinner and watch the changing scenery of the river and the passing clouds outside the window.
The little girls and handsome guys at the front desk provide good service and look good when they smile.
The receptionist at the door was also meticulous in his work on a hot day and answered all questions. The sisters who do the cleaning on the floor are very conscientious and responsible. When we return to the hotel after playing every day, the room is neat and clean.

Across the road from the hotel is a park, where you can see the light show along the river. Downstairs is the former **, where many internet celebrities check in. The hotel service is good. I left for the provincial expo in the morning and couldn't make it back in time to check out. The guy at the front desk took the initiative to extend my stay for an hour so that I could have a rest when I came back. It was very good. The hotel infrastructure is indeed a bit outdated, but fortunately it is well maintained and has a typical image of an old five-star hotel. To add some praise, the equipment in the room pays more attention to details, is more thoughtful and user-friendly, and it can be seen that care has been taken. Occasionally, small details can really touch people's hearts. Next time I have the opportunity to go to Wuhan, I will probably choose to stay here.
The revolving restaurant on the 41st floor is a Thai buffet style and can be reached directly by taking the sightseeing elevator.

      Traveling around is also very convenient. Since it is in the central location, the cost of taking a taxi every day is not high, and the surrounding restaurants are relatively good. There is a Michelin Black Pearl restaurant two to three hundred meters away from the hotel, which is very good.
      If I have a suggestion, it would be great if the breakfast could be richer🤭

They took a taxi to the pedestrian street Jianghan Road Yellow Crane Tower joint store on the fourth floor. They waited in line for two hours to get the food. The word is cool 😊; the second place "Liang Liang Steamed Shrimp" Howard Johnson Hotel turned right 600 meters, and queued for half an hour; the third place "Bali Lobster" was 150 meters behind the hotel, and the taste was not bad. We went to the Wansongyuan head office of the Wuhan local dish "Xia's Casserole" again, and it took two hours to get our turn 😍 The taste is amazing. The panorama of the "Yellow Crane Tower" can be photographed on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. In early August, Wuhan was so hot 🔥We are very courageous. Are you guys ready to eat shrimp?

The location of the hotel is very good. The Yuehan Wharf is opposite the hotel. At night, you can take a cruise to enjoy the light show on both sides of the Yangtze River. You can also walk along the river beach greenway, and you can also board the Zhiyin to experience the performance of the Republic of China. It takes a few minutes to walk from the hotel You can go to Lihuangpi Road, and you can see many old buildings from the ** period along the way, which has a special flavor; when you are tired from shopping, you can go to the Bali lobster on Dongting Street for a meal, so pleasant~
You can go to Shanhaiguan Road too early in the morning. Fresh fish paste soup noodles, lotus root soup, and three fresh bean curd taste better than Dacheng Road and Liangdao Street. Enjoy the river view at the hotel, eat Wuhan special snacks, and drink tea to look pleasant~
The hotel facilities and services are also very good. If you book a river view room, you can see the river view when you open the curtains. The view is excellent! Because I stayed for two nights in a row, the customer service will take the initiative to ask if I need to clean the room. After leaving, the account manager will call back. The account manager Winnie is very kind. It made me feel the enthusiasm of the people of Wuhan again. I couldn't help but like it~

In addition, there are Bali and Liangliang crayfish within a few steps of the hotel, which is very convenient! Before leaving, I found out that there is a beautiful Bali Lobster behind the hotel

When we arrived at the hotel, the manager Winnie who received us was very enthusiastic. He not only helped carry the luggage, but also greeted us warmly when he saw our children. He offered water and fruit, which made the children very happy. He told us that this young lady is really nice. ah. The room is also very beautiful, with a direct and unobstructed river view.

The facilities are not bad, although not very new, but fortunately, the sanitation is good. Parking is also convenient, there is an underground parking lot. It's not far from some scenic spots, and you can walk to Lihuangpo Road, the ferry terminal, etc. All in all, I'm very satisfied

msg:On the edge of the river beach, the location is excellent. Next door is the Wuhan Municipal Government, and there are many places to eat nearby. The Hankou River Beach is just across the road. I heard that there is a revolving Thai restaurant on the top floor, but I didn't try it because of time. I have a good impression of the front desk and the cleaning lady. The only dissatisfaction is that the arranged river view room only sees a small part of the river obliquely, which is a bit inconsistent with the name. Looking at the evacuation plane, there is a row of rooms facing the river in front of the hotel. I don't know which room type to book to stay.

msg:Is this normal in hotels in Wuhan or is it a problem with your hotel? Is it because I have little knowledge of consumers? Let me talk about a few issues for you to comment on.
1. I arrived at 1:30 pm on Friday, and said that the room had not been cleaned up, so I was asked to go out for a walk. We went out for a walk in the windy weather and came back at 3.30 pm, and still said no, it was not cleaned. At the back there was a person who looked like a manager and said that I have a client who is not coming here, so you go live first. I would like to ask, has your hotel experienced full rooms or what? So hard to clean?
2. I went to check out at noon the next day and was told that I had to check out at 12 o'clock. I was deeply puzzled. I said that I didn't check in until 3.30 the day before. What's the situation in your hotel? While asking the guests to leave early, while letting the guests hang out? Then there was another beep saying that we could wait until two o'clock. I don't understand, have you ever opened a hotel?
3. There are two places to take a bath, a shower and a bathtub. This is an advantage, but the shower water is very small, and the bathtub water is okay but there is no shower bracket. Only the water in the faucet was very large, and the tooth cup was filled with water and sprayed all over the body.
4. It’s okay for a hotel in such a good location not to pay attention to details. It’s fine if the curtains can’t be controlled electronically, but the top floor is leaking light. I really don’t understand.
5. There is no main light, and there are 5 spotlights in the entire room of 44 square meters. The two on the head of the bed cum in the eyes.
6. There is only one switch for all the switches. There is no main switch or double switch. If you want to go to bed, you have to go to the door to turn off the lights.
7. The sound insulation is not good, you can hear what you say at the door.
8. Nothing but Jiangjing.
9. The picture is the problem that this room is prepared to solve. I don't understand.

There is no light show on the bridge and the Yangtze River Bridge at night!

I personally think that the light show seen standing by the river at night is the most beautiful

The facilities are a bit old, breakfast is 100 yuan per person, it's ok

msg:It's the first time I brought my family to Wuhan, and I chose this hotel after reading Ctrip's evaluation. I arrived at the hotel at 6:30 in the afternoon. During the check-in process, I asked if I could upgrade to a room with a river view for free. The other party said that I did not book a river view room and could not upgrade for free. I said that I saw that many of your Ctrip reviews can upgrade the room for free, but he said that there is no room. I said I would spend money to upgrade, and he said that's okay, haha. Then I spent money to upgrade to a river view room, saying that the existing house was on a low floor. I asked if there were any high floors, and the answer was that it needs to be cleaned and I have to wait. I don't know how long the wait was. In the end, I left my luggage at the front desk and took my family out for dinner. During the period, I called and said that the room could be cleaned at 8:30, and I said yes.
When you enter the room, you can see the river view, one third is the city view, the middle is the building, and the right third is the river view. Even the service attitude of the front desk really makes me speechless, the room facilities are outdated, and I don't know how the five-star rating is. Fortunately, the room service staff and the cleaning lady are very enthusiastic.
I have stayed in so many hotels, after all, they are five-star hotels. If the hardware is not up to par, I will work on the software. If you have a low EQ, don't let the reception of guests at the front desk cause trouble for others. I originally wanted to stay for a few more days, but after seeing this, I changed hotels decisively. When I checked out, I asked the person who received me was some kind of junior supervisor. He was dressed in sloppy clothes and had a blunt expression. He was not as comfortable as the little brother who checked me out. It was unbelievable.

It’s just that after turning around twice to come in, put down the luggage, or let the turn out and park on the side of the back alley, if I knew it, I wouldn’t have to turn around twice downstairs in the hotel! After checking out in the morning, I found that the hotel was full of cars, that is to say, we only adhere to the principle for early arrivals, and it is convenient for later guests. So the overall feeling is very bad.

msg:The upgraded river view room given by the hotel receptionist is very good
During the epidemic, the hotel's catering and executive lounges were not open to the public
The location is superior, opposite to the Yangtze River, but it's dark at night, the scenery is still very good during the day, next to Wuhan Municipal Government, the safety index is high
The hotel is an old-fashioned hotel. The software and hardware facilities are a little behind. There is no uninterruptible power supply. The light switches are old-fashioned. The central air conditioner in the room is too noisy. It cannot be turned on at night, and the room temperature is very low if it is not turned on.
The doorman at the door is just a decoration to welcome guests. When you get off the car and see a pile of luggage, you don’t help to pull a luggage cart, just look at it and stroll back and forth. It doesn’t make much sense.
Although it is a five-star hotel, the overall feeling is average, after all, the price is right there

The light show on both sides of the Yangtze River in Wuhan is relatively good in the country, and the night view is very beautiful. Across the road is the Memorial Hall of Chairman Mao's Crossing the Yangtze River, which is also the Shili River Beach along the Riverside Avenue. The motorboat of the escort chairman was displayed in the open air.
Hotel breakfast is more authentic. There are Chinese and Western restaurants that a five-star hotel should have. Especially the noodles, braised beef, and spare ribs are solid and casual, and the taste is very good.
    Because the child is over 1.4 meters tall, according to the regulations, I have to buy half-price breakfast. The guy at the front desk generously gave three breakfasts. I would like to thank you here.
Facilities: Although it is old, it does not affect the sense of grade of use.
Hygiene: very clean.
Environment: first-line river view, convenient transportation. There is a food street behind the hotel, which is very convenient to eat.
Service: warm and attentive.

Except for a short female employee who was very friendly, the other two male employees I met were cold and arrogant. . But what shocked me the most was that at 21:55 on Sunday, February 13th, after I received a takeaway call from my room, I took the No. 4 elevator to the 1st floor to pick up the takeaway. When the elevator arrived on the 1st floor, the door opened, and I saw outside the door. Standing there was a hotel employee (in a dark gray suit, with a hotel badge, not the kind of clothes that the front desk and restaurant waiters wore. It was a slightly fat male employee), and he went straight in before I got out of the elevator. After getting on the elevator and pressing his own floor, he didn't say hello to the guests, and he didn't say sorry, he had to use the elevator urgently. Absolutely! I was really shocked at the time. Although I also felt that your hotel was not a 5-star hotel, you were not required to have the service level of a Japanese or European hotel, but when I saw the guest in a hotel uniform, I didn’t take the initiative to say hello or say hello. Also the guests grab the elevator, I really admire. Express hotels do not have such staff.
I am a local, and I brought the elderly to my home for vacation this time. Originally, I was reluctant to comment on the badness of local hotels. After the epidemic, the tourism industry is not easy. I also hope that the local tourism industry can be revitalized. However, the performance of this employee It makes me feel completely unacceptable. If it is a foreign guest who comes to Wuhan for tourism, and encounters such a thing, it will be more embarrassing for Wuhan!

One thing to say, there are still some advantages. The location of the hotel is very good, the river view room is large, the night view is beautiful, and the furniture feels good.

After seeing the room, I was very satisfied and booked it. After checking in at the hotel, I went out to play directly. I checked my mobile phone halfway through and found that Ctrip had booked a room on the 41st floor of the Thai Golden Flower Royal Revolving Restaurant. After returning to the hotel in the afternoon, I went to the hotel and communicated with the front desk, so I placed the order again on Ctrip and delivered it. The package coupons wait for the evening to come back and make an appoin**ent with the restaurant. They said that they must be 24 hours in advance. Tonight, the package coupons will not be used. I told the waiter that we will be leaving tomorrow after checking out. She said that she will report to the manager.

msg:The hotel is located on the north bank of the Yangtze River, across the river from the green space center, the tallest building in Wuhan.

The room is not big, but the bathroom is spacious and comfortable.
The facilities in the house are relatively new. According to the introduction, it was redecorated in 2018.

Although it is a river view room, strictly speaking, it is a side river view. The landscapes on the east side and west side have their own characteristics, and the high floors on the west side will allow you to enjoy a more beautiful river view.

However, if you want to enjoy the colorful night view of the Yangtze River, the best location is the sightseeing elevator that goes directly to the 41st floor.

I have seen a lot of long beaches in Binjiang, Binhe, Binhu and Binhai, but the Binjiang Long Beach in Wuhan downstairs still left a deep impression with its grand layout and broad vision.

The river view room booked includes a single breakfast. The hotel has not only upgraded, but also provided children's breakfast.

The breakfast is rich in variety, fully in line with the standard of a five-star hotel.

Overall, the hotel is good value for money.

In the alley behind the hotel, there is an old hot pot restaurant, Yuan Lao Si. The business is booming. We arrived at the shop at 6:30, and the table was only lined up at 7:00. The taste is not much different from other hot pot restaurants, but the portion is sufficient and the price is moderate.

The location of the hotel has nothing to say, just across the road is Jiangtan Park, there is a small electric playground inside, there is a lot of food around, ordering takeaway is also very convenient.
There are slides, swings, children's products and water toys in the parent-child room. The child likes it very much.
The hotel itself is old and a bit dilapidated, but it is better than the location. The breakfast is okay, but not too exquisite.
On the day of check-in, a girl named Chen at the front desk was very kind, and the aunt who cleaned the room was also very nice. The other staff who met in the hotel were a little cold, and some spoke bluntly. I hope to strengthen the service.

The front desk, guest room, and engineering depar**ent of the hotel are very satisfied with the services and scenery. Nothing else, the river view room can see the night view, and the morning view makes up for the lack of outdated room facilities. Compared with Chengdu Howard Johnson, Wuhan Mingzhu Howard Johnson suggests that it should be upgraded. Small changes also have a different overall effect, such as replacing the TV and TV cabinet, removing the mirror facing the bed, and a mirror facing the bed... this design It feels too bad for the guests, the others are okay, neither too good nor too bad, comments on the real sense of staying experience, and serious criticism! ! ! The price of the same room type booked through sales is more than 200 higher than that of Ctrip. This is really killing pigs. It will not last for a long time. The trust is only one time. You are practical and sincere. It is a price that simply makes you speechless. In this situation, I have to complain about the operation. I don’t know how many companies have been scammed behind it... The fact is the truth. I only tell the truth. The management defect and hardware facilities are only for the hotel to make decisions about the future. Go, the ones outside of cognition don't belong to you!

He is very patient every time he helps me get the room card. And our guest service manager Cindy was enthusiastic throughout the whole journey. Because we were traveling with my old lady, I heard that the bathtub in the bathroom was inconvenient, so I immediately adjusted us to a good room with a shower, and because the old lady was picky about watching the river view, she helped us patiently. Adjusting the room, the service is really good and caring, this trip is really good and perfect.

We resolved the room request in time and upgraded the room type. Knowing our birthday, the hotel also prepared a birthday cake very intimately. It was really pleasantly surprised and so considerate. During the stay, the housekeeping sister Wang Fuzhen also had a very good attitude. She responded promptly to every request. She was super friendly and very clean. During the stay, we wanted to change a quilt cover, and she would not save trouble. She gave us all the sheets. The quilt was renewed. The upgraded river view room has a very nice view, wide view, complete surrounding facilities, walking distance to eat, live and play, and it is very convenient to go to the river beach to view the scenery. This time I stayed in a perfect mood. Will choose here next time I come to Wuhan.

Whether it is the check-in brother at the front desk (👍manually like)... the room attendant and When I got to the room, the room supervisor who was still checking the room should be the floor supervisor or something. When I got to the room, she was checking the room. She was very polite to ask me for the room card when I went into the room (security awareness and Polite and acknowledgment), after the inspection confirmed that I am a new guest...help me insert the power card, and then kindly ask me if I can continue to complete a few inspection items...the language is very standard (this is that I am a hotel I was very impressed by the management staff, and I hope the general manager of the hotel can encourage this kind of performance), and the work process ends after careful inspection! (I really hope that I can have such an excellent floor manager)...For the scenery and facilities, just look at the pictures! 😒 The overall operation and management of the breakfast room really needs to be greatly strengthened...😳 The waiters and management staff are basically not in the state...Most chefs and waiters do not feel the presence of "guests" at all (I hope the hotel general manager can rectify and improve Let’s take a look at the "dining experience and customer experience" of the entire breakfast restaurant. The service deduction is because the breakfast operation management of the catering depar**ent is not good...)... 👍👍 Generally speaking... "very good"...!!!

So this time I came to Han with a friend to recommend staying at the Howard Johnson Hotel, and the experience was extremely bad. First of all, the doorman turned a blind eye to us carrying the luggage from the car and turned to leave. Secondly, the front desk attitude was extremely cold, and the hot and dry noodles provided by Wuhan Tourism Bureau. It was said that one copy per room, not one copy per guest. I will make up one copy immediately after complaining. 😓I hope that the management will strengthen the staff's sense of service and improve the staff's personal quality, so that it can be worthy of the Great Wall five-star brand!

🧹Hygienic: The swimming pool could have added points, but the toilet is directly connected to the swimming pool, which greatly reduces the experience.

msg:Such a poor hotel was rated as the third most popular hotel. I was very disappointed with the Ctrip rankings. Apart from a slightly better location, there is no reason to recommend it. The rooms are small and dirty, and the facilities are outdated. Why are you so embarrassed? A 5-star sign is hung in the lobby. It’s the worst star hotel I’ve ever stayed in, and it’s about the same as Express

Ctrip.com marked the renovation in 2018 on the Internet. This is a bit tricky. The wallpaper in the room is just reposted. It's just a small repair. The decoration of the room is old. The breakfast buffet is not good. It is similar to the breakfast of some budget hotels. There are too few varieties. Sorry for the 5-star title!

msg:The view of the river view room is great, and the scenic area along the river is across the road across the road. The elderly and children in the family love the location of this hotel. It is very pleasant to stroll around the old streets and look at the old houses after eating nearby. Breakfast is 100 yuan per person. When you book the room, you see that the option does not include 578 one night in the morning, and 800 one night in the double breakfast. Is this testing the guest's mathematical calculation and looking for cost-effective ability? The hotel’s breakfast is pretty good, but it’s good for your health to eat a variety of patterns and colors for breakfast, including fruits and vegetables. The local frying is too early and too heavy with oil and carbon water. Although it costs less (ten yuan per capita can support it), try it lightly Already enough, such a diet has endless troubles.

For young people who pursue fashion, it feels that the facilities and equipment here are not suitable for parent-child travel. , But as a business trip, absolutely possible.

Before booking, you need to leave a message on the platform on the high-floor adjacent room, because the hotel is satisfied when I bring my parents to Wuhan for the first time. Very good, the service is in place, the stay is very comfortable and very satisfied. Especially at night, the river view is absolutely amazing.
It is not far from the pier and Hanjiang Road, so travel is very convenient.

I upgraded my room business river view room to an exclusive river view room, which is a superb river view! I also prepared a birthday cake in the evening. I was so surprised and moved! It really added a commemorative memory to my trip🥰
The location of the hotel is unique, and you can sit on the cruise ship across the road at night. What's more commendable is that the river view room can have a panoramic view of the lights on both sides of the strait! Beautiful
I will recommend to Mingzhu Howard Johnson with my friends who want to visit Wuhan. It is very unforgettable.
The hotel is great, the service is better, thanks

msg:先講講優點，在沿江大道，觀景方便，前台服務有問必答，洗漱用品提供洗衣粉，很貼心，上網操作簡單不用提供房號，四樓中餐廳味道不錯，菜點多了，最後取消，服務員也和顏悦色。房間隔音差，隔壁的洗澡水聲聽的清清楚楚，半夜樓上傳來咚咚咚的不知什麼聲音，馬桶水箱漏水，早晨起來龍頭裡衹有熱水沒有冷水燙手，41樓旋轉廳上菜非常慢，但是端上來的炒飯卻是冷的，看夜景衹能在稜形格里看，且有的玻璃膜也沒有撕，看不清楚，更不用説拍照了，還不如去對面的江邊觀景

酒店門口設有外賣存放桌，拿外賣很方便。
酒店外觀標誌性的大圓球，帶孩子無論去周邊哪裡玩都會是非常明顯的路標，外地人逛江邊毫無壓力，觀光梯孩子也超級喜歡！
早餐包含了很多武漢特色小吃，湯麪湯粉做的很好吃，其他也是應有盡有，價格能接受的話真的建議試一試！

出來玩，僅僅是在房間裏呆著，都讓人很輕易的從日常忙碌的工作中脱離出來。

升級到了行政江景，房間又大又乾淨，景色也很贊，可以直接看到長江和大橋，晚上還能看到一部分燈光秀。
並且房間內的設施也不錯，洗浴是歐舒丹，淋浴和浴缸是分開的，還有電動馬桶，電動窗簾，每日四瓶農夫山泉。
行政房真不錯，感謝升級。希望下次入住還能被升級哈哈哈。

酒店位置就不用説了，去各個景點都不遠，附近好吃的也多，不想出門的話外賣可以叫到各種熱門過早/熱門餐廳/熱門奶茶，足不出户吃遍武漢美食（誇張句）
並且過馬路就是漢口江灘，吃飽了出去散個步非常方便！離碼頭也很近！

推薦入住

msg:1、地段非常優秀，距離網紅打卡地黃陂路步行幾分鐘就到了，周圍的民國時期的建築也比較有特色，屬於鬧中取靜有氛圍的街區（個人不喜歡户部巷那種嘈雜的地方）；
2、能看到江景（夜景氛圍也不錯），這也是為啥挑選了這個酒點；
3、定得早，但是發現當天行政房的價格比之前早定的價格還便宜（😓），略微有點遺憾；本身酒店也有年份了，設施相對新修的酒店確實有些差距，但是這個價格還是匹配；
4、贈送的維也納餐廳軟飲券：建議可以改變下定位，略微低於預期；咖啡是普通黑咖啡，軟飲果汁也是普通的，環境也比較簡陋蕭條，其實哪怕是到二樓咖啡廳贈飲，咖啡不變環境更好，對客人也是更好的體驗，主要一樓這個維也納咖啡廳佈置和環境有點掉檔次（很多外面咖啡廳都比這個更有特色）；
其他都挺好，服務態度也不錯的！

msg:前台服務員服務水平太差，問多二句不高興的。一次性付款二晚房費的，沒有通知我續住後要到前台刷卡。待我上到23樓打不開房門，下去前台問了才告訴我，出差本身就是累，還要跑上跑下的。前台不應該這樣的服務，應該是付款時就要告訴住客明天回來時到前台刷下續住卡才是。

講真，一路旅行過來，成都的四星五星，住店體驗簡直不要太好。武漢這家最貴，結果服務最不行，以後來漢口不會住這家。

第一：不知名牙膏牙刷，輕輕一刷那就能牙出血，劣質程度可想而知.700塊錢不配擁有一個軟毛牙刷和一點點好牙膏.
第二：飲用水“冰露”，朋友們，我住個500的酒店裡麪配置的冰箱裏還有好幾種叫得上名字的純凈水和飲料以及可樂，喝不完給你帶走的那種.茶包咖啡包就更不用説了，簡直劣質到家.我花700都不配喝個怡寶，你管這叫五星級酒店？
第三：我們訂的是江景房，啥叫江景？我住的是側邊江景.武漢長江大橋都看不到我來這幹啥？哪個酒店敢這麼囂張的統稱為江景？該不該退我差價。
第四：夜裡沒開空調照樣凍的直哆嗦，為啥？陰冷啊，被子薄的一批.薄到我感覺就是個被罩.
第五：屋裡一股子灰塵味兒，沙發摸起來油唧唧的，就沒清理過吧.床單黑點點入住第二十分鐘看到後拍下來了，消毒沒？84用了沒？一夜裡都是渾身癢，早起看都抓出血了，氣炸，想罵臟話.一個人癢就算了，兩個人都渾身發癢，起疙瘩.我花錢來給你測試衞生條件呢？陪你成長？
第六：因為一夜都沒睡好，十點才起，點了外賣好傢伙沒人管的那種，就給你放門口的一個誰都能碰到的枱子上，自己下去拿去吧.越想越氣，吃完飯收拾收拾趕緊下去退房去了，花了錢才願意待到第二天，要不是房費貴頭一天就想換了.去你的五星級吧.

奔波在路上，住過很多酒店，但一直以為，無論擁有何等全面的設施、服務，又或是品牌和裝潢，都比不上一窗美景，幾縷歷史的思緒，更能安撫旅人的心。哪怕是雨落、陰鬱的天氣，哪怕是激蕩、匆忙的商旅行程中。

提前一個月就向酒店確認預訂江景大床房作為婚房，酒店提前已知曉此房間會被用於婚房，因為佈置婚房，入住期間在房間用雙面膠貼了喜字，放了。紙綵帶禮花（事前酒店無人提醒不能放，退房後説放了要罰款），入住期間無任何人告知潛在風險，在接親流程結束後，酒店在明知此房間被用於接親房間的情況下，不提前告知任何注意事項，直接在我結婚當天退房後以破壞牆體為由（還是其清潔阿姨撕下導致的）索賠600元，不接受協商，扣留本人按金，並且態度極其惡劣，不接受溝通，導致結婚當天破壞心情，體驗極差，酒店管理水平低下，同時懷疑其故意不提前告知在事後訛取賠償金。請大家謹慎避免踩雷。

msg:1.前台服務流水化作業，不熱情。定了2間房，入住時快4點，其中一間房間告知要1小時後才能入住，和前台工作人員確認打掃好了是否電話通知入住，前台工作人員反饋，不需要電話通知，按照1小時後直接入住就可以了，面無表情。
2.廁所淋浴需要站在浴缸裏。
3.辦理入住後出去吃飯，晚上8點後回來發現床是濕潤的，客房服務人員和客房主管來重新換了床上用品，客房主管解釋因為外面氣温高，房間氣温低，導致的，還説他們家也是這樣。作為一個來自火爐的重慶人，表示重來沒有遇到過。
4.到酒店後服務員見到我們帶了兩大箱行李，主動詢問幫忙。
5.訂房前打前台電話諮詢周邊特色小吃、停車、餐飲等問題，前台不知曉。

msg:首先，我要感謝前台小哥哥給我們免費升級了房型，非常感謝。但是，住了兩天下來，最後心裏的感激不僅一點點被磨滅了，還不斷的積累各種失望和失望。
對於五星酒店而言，整體設施配備及其他服務配套和攜程列的排名不匹配。
1.飲用水是冰露。（第一次見）
2.贈送的mini吧和軟飲，這兩個贈送真的讓我原地裂開…一兩塊成本真的還是別送了，大家的失望之情應該都溢於言表。之前住的南京七百多的酒店，贈送的mini吧有薯片、堅果、飲料、啤酒、膠囊咖啡……或者你不要説有這些贈送，我也不會有期待，贈不贈送大家無所謂的。但你讓人在網上訂房的時候給人感覺送了多了不得的東西，欺詐消費，結果…一千多的房費，真的，我都不知道説啥。
2.洗澡衹有浴缸，而且浴缸裏的防滑墊下面和浴缸邊緣不是白色。孩子不會調換水龍頭，就泡的澡，洗完一直撓後背。然後我才知道孩子在這種浴缸裏泡了澡。
3.早餐品種多，但品質不高，太多食物不 好 吃。口味是目前同級別或四星裏吃過較差的。沒有一道硬菜。水果、甜點供應的質量均低於同等100元價位早餐的其他酒店。
4.打掃衞生的阿姨打掃的很細，特別認真。
5.感謝這家酒店，影響了我們三個外地人對武漢的整體印象，一家三口的默契就是武漢不會再來了。

平板是不值錢，但是孩子專用的學習工具，希望能加強管理員工操行吧，後面想入住客人看到，記得仔細收拾行李不要再有這種不愉快發生

服務：很多細節可以提升，比如晚上22:30到酒店門口沒有保安，可能白天也沒有。但下雨車輛堵塞，沒有人協調，確實差點意思。再比如上午九點半我沒有退房，打掃阿姨自己敲門後就自己開門了，我在衞生間洗澡，還好沒開始洗，出來一看阿姨自己進門也是蠻醉的。
設施：設施上空調太老了，剛入住有點小味道。後面能好些～
我定的豪華江景房也和圖片並不一致！
總體老説，性價比總體是高的，但理理想值還有待提升！

從廣州來武漢找同學玩，用了武漢旅遊券訂酒店，價格特別划算！check in時前台還給升級了房型到行政套房✌️

房間很大，而且可以同時欣賞到城景和江景，白天和夜晚的美景盡收眼底。（圖片中圓頂的就是酒店外景照啦）酒店的地理位置也很無敵，離江岸和小吃街都很方便，離漢口高鐵站打車也不遠。

酒店經理小冉也很負責，服務非常棒👍👍

總之非常感謝酒店給了我這次武漢之行這麼好的體驗，之後身邊朋友來我也會給他們安利這家
