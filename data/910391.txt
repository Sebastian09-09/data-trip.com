msg:My parents spend half of the year in Hainan, but rarely go to other places in Hainan except around home, especially the "inland" places.
I checked the guide for them, saw Baoting Hot Spring, and thought about letting them go out and have fun.
But I accidentally discovered the nearby Shenyu Island. I had a good impression of it. Moreover, this hotel felt very unique. I decided to book my trip immediately after going out once.
(Probably to let them experience the hotel hhhh)
It turned out that my vision was indeed right. My parents had checked out for two days, and they were still talking about the hotel's services, facilities (the facilities are very new, but they have their own characteristics and feel), and the scenery of the island. They said they would wait for me when I return. Hainan must go again
Name and commend üëç Miss Fu Kangying for her considerate and enthusiastic service üíï, which makes parents feel good
This time I just hope that I can go and have a look by myself.

When I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I thought of giving the housekeeper some health care. Miss Kang sent me a WeChat message, and Kangkang came to the hotel from her residence without saying a word, and contacted the staff of the hotel infirmary, who sent me the right medicine. Although this trip was not entirely enjoyable due to physical reasons, I felt extremely grateful for the warm and thoughtful service provided by the staff of the Jade Hotel. Here, I would like to thank the housekeeper Kangkang and the staff of the Jade Hotel for allowing our vacation guests to stay in the hotel.

When I arrived, I found that the hotel is surrounded by mountains and water, and the air is fresh and sweet. It is a very suitable place for vacation. Although the scenic spot of Shenyu Island is not suitable for a special trip on its own, when viewed as a hotel package, it is very comfortable and even a little luxurious.
Overall, the experience of checking in and the room was pleasant. I would like to give the housekeeper Xiao Lei good reviews. He contacted us in advance and provided timely feedback when ordering food and delivery. This greatly improved the stay experience.
The restaurant mainly tried the Chinese restaurant, once for stir-fries and once for hot pot, and the service tasted pretty good. The chicken in the Coconut Chicken Hot Pot was served too slowly, but it was a good thing.
You can have a great experience in Hainan without looking at the sea. You can come to Shenyu Island.

msg:The facilities are too poor! I don‚Äôt understand why the charging socket in a standard room hotel that costs 1,480 yuan a day is a defective one. I went to bed at 11 o‚Äôclock in the evening to charge it, and I tried so hard to find all the room jacks but couldn‚Äôt connect to it! I went to customer service. The male waiter in his forties, who looked like a nearby farmer, did solve the problem with his strength, but I was worried about breaking the charging plug! (The video is the waiter's operation the next morning) After all the troubles, we turned off the lights and went to sleep, but the night lights outside the building couldn't be blocked. We pressed the curtains in every possible way to block them, but the result was that the spotlights were still shining brightly. The light beam came in, and the housekeeper Xiaoyi was helpless and asked the waiter to come over and see how to solve it. The problem is that this problem cannot be solved. I was angry and said that if it was not solved for me, I would report the situation to Ctrip and the management depar**ent. Fortunately, they changed my room for me in the middle of the night, and two male waiters led me and said that there was no problem. Waitress, we are two female customers! The hardware limitations of this hotel make the hard-working service staff overwhelmed! The building decoration used a lot of wooden boards to give it a natural appearance, but the smell of paint was very obvious, and the pursuit of naturalness went completely wrong! Jade and tea are also sold in the guest room. Why is there a sales cabinet in the guest room? Originally, the small cabinet was not very big, so it was very cramped to store some things on hand. Speaking of the external environment, it is similar to the mountains in the suburbs of Beijing, except that the tropical vegetation is more lush. In Beijing, the Black Dragon Pond, Qinglong Gorge, Longqing Gorge and the like are no worse than here in the summer. If it were not for the name of health preservation in the tropical rainforest, it would definitely not be possible. I came here, but I ended up exhausted from my health vacation! Go back to the hotel in downtown Sanya and have a good rest. The price is the same and the comfort is amazing! I don‚Äôt know why this hotel has such good reviews online. Is it for the reception service? I agree, the reception staff are really dedicated, thank you to all the staff who worked hard for us! The food in the Chinese restaurant is okay and the service is good. If you are passing by for a meal and a stroll, it is okay. Forget about accommodation. The flower shelves are not comfortable and there is no hot spring, just hot water. My friend ate here and said it was good. Wouldn't it be better if I wanted to stay there?

The price is quite expensive. The location of the hotel is too remote. There are no restaurants to choose from around. The environment of Shenyu Island Scenic Area is very poor.

The taste is as good as mine. My husband likes it very much. There are many kinds of breakfast. We have to get up to have breakfast before going to bed every day. Finally, the housekeeper Liu Jinming who welcomed us in was very attentive and asked about the check-in situation every day. We will go there next time.

It feels good and suitable for taking pictures. The food in the Chinese restaurant is delicious and the price is reasonable.
Let‚Äôs talk about the shortcomings. Because it was the off-season when I came here, there was no service staff anywhere in the hotel except the front desk. The swimming pool was very dirty and the surface was full of insect corpses. It took a lot of effort to get someone to fish it out for half an hour, but it couldn‚Äôt be cleaned. There was nothing we could do. During the tour, I didn‚Äôt experience any of the academy items included in the package. There was not a single staff member on site. I was given a set of snacks from the bar in the evening. I went there and was told that the front desk didn‚Äôt communicate well with the Western chef and didn‚Äôt cook it. The guy at the bar didn‚Äôt do it. I found a few small snacks and fruits to make up for it. At the beginning of the breakfast, I was told that I would choose it and deliver it to the room. After choosing it for a long time, I was notified later that it could not be delivered. I negotiated back and forth several times. The attitude of the male front desk at night was still good. not too good
Generally speaking, both the scenery, the hardware and the chef team are good, but the service is really not matched. It can be said that it is rarely bad. Almost nothing in the hotel package has been fulfilled. I hope the management can be strengthened. Looking forward to the next one There will be some improvement if we come back next time

Most of the local employees are relatively simple, and they are all OK.

msg:The hardware facilities of the hotel are complete. Thank you, the lady at the front desk, for upgrading us to the topaz mountain view room for free. I am very satisfied! The scenery of Shenyu Island is very beautiful. It is different from the tropical rainforest or the seaside. We started from the Longevity Road, ferryed to the Shenyu Pagoda, and continued on foot to complete the Consummation Road. After a few steps, there are some artworks to visit. There are stairs and cable bridges, so the whole journey is not tiring at all. After walking, board a boat and circle the island, cool and comfortable! Suitable for bringing children!

Special praise to the housekeeper Xi De, who has provided considerate service since we checked into the hotel. He is attentive and enthusiastic in his work. He helped with the salute, arranged check-in, and found him for the first time when he forgot to bring the charger. It is the best service among the hotels in Hainan that I have stayed in so far. There are also charming scenery, happy swimming, handicrafts, making zongzi, boat trips on the lake, copying heart scriptures, Lijia song and dance performances at night, bamboo pole dance, the manager Huang of the restaurant is also very good, and cooks the zongzi we made. Yes, the children had so much fun that they didn't want to leave. Come again next time!

msg:I have heard about Shenyu's hotel for a long time. This time, I decided to stop by and stay overnight to see this dream shop. Maybe I had too high expectations, but the reality is still a bit lacking. The hotel passes through a section of village road with scattered village houses on both sides. Entering the hotel, you will encounter roadside slope protection construction. The hotel does not have an open lobby, but the service staff are very enthusiastic. The first time I entered the room, I was very impressed. I like the elegant decoration style, the bedding is also very comfortable, and the room is equipped with a yoga mat. There is no soap and hand sanitizer in the bathroom, which is somewhat regrettable. I wanted to go out to buy some snacks after 9:00 in the evening, but I was told that the hotel‚Äôs canteen closed at 9:00, and some French fries and pizzas in the western restaurant were unappetizing. I felt this was very inhumane, because the hotel has no supporting facilities within 10 kilometers, even if it is equipped with a vending machine. Let's talk about the bathroom, the mirror is full of light, and there is really no way to put on makeup. The switch in the shower is also very strange, with a smooth rotating handle. When you are naked and your hands are full of shampoo, it is a huge problem to turn on the shower again. On the night of staying at the hotel, it was raining, so I couldn't see the view of the reservoir. Finally, let‚Äôs talk about breakfast, which is not worthy of the room price of 1500+.

I am very grateful to my housekeeper, Mr. Zou Botao, who has been very enthusiastic and thoughtful since I checked into the hotel. He personally received me and sent me to the room, put my luggage, and introduced how to use the room facilities. He also told me how to play better. , During the stay in the hotel, he provided me with a lot of help and made me feel at home. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Butler Zou for his warm and professional service. The overall design of the hotel is very strong, which belongs to the new Chinese style, and there are dry landscape applications in the advanced rooms and courtyards. I like the design of the boat-shaped house on the roof of the hotel, the tonality is very unique. Walking into the hotel room, there are complete facilities inside. The most impressive thing is that there is a tatami balcony, and there are relatively complete tea art supplies at the door. Because I am a tea lover, even if it is raining outside and I don‚Äôt go out, I will not be bored in the guest room. Drinking tea and watching the misty rain outside the house, it feels like being in a paradise, just enjoying it. The bathroom of the guest room is also intimately equipped with an electric toilet seat, making it more convenient to go to the toilet. The bedding in the room is also very comfortable to use, and the quality of sleep is high. The hotel is located in the scenic area, and the content of negative oxygen ions is very high. I walked all the plank roads and felt that the rainforest was well protected. Half of the plank roads and half cruise ships had a very good experience. After half a day, I felt like people were swimming in the painting. After a while It rains for a while and the sky clears up, giving people a very different feeling. During my stay at the hotel, I also experienced activities such as flower arrangement art, incense, scripture copying, jade carving, weaving, etc. It was really a great experience! I like Shenyu Island very much, and I will definitely come again if I have the opportunity. Goodbye to the beautiful Shenyu Island!

         The hotel is nestled among the green mountains and green waters, with a unique design, with the theme of "jade" and a strong cultural a**osphere. It is one of the most design and beautiful hotels I have ever seen.
       Every morning, wake up to the singing of birds; at night, fall asleep to the sound of frogs. During the day, you can go up the mountain along the plank road to enjoy the scenery. In the rainforest, the birds chirping and the air is fresh, overlooking the lake and mountains, you feel relaxed and happy; when you are tired, sit in a red boat, rowing on the lake, the breeze comes slowly, the microwave gently ripples, and the dust of the world is washed away. . My mother was especially happy, because she didn't feel tired from traveling, and she went to the mountains and rivers while worshiping Buddha (there are several small temples hidden in the mountains and forests).
         A trip to express love for the mountains and rivers and relax the body and mind is worth a visit.

Service: Nothing to say, from check-in to check-out. The whole process is very caring and smiling, making you feel that your money is worth it!

Overall, it's pretty good. The temperature has cooled down in the past few days. When the temperature rises, I want to bring my family to live here. It's really pleasant.

The downside is that the downstairs of the room is a rockery and there is a man-made waterfall during the day, and it is too noisy to open the window. Take a boat cruise on the lake, and then go for a walk on the trail, one step at a time, it is worth visiting. Overall good, come again next time!

The housekeeper Xiaoqing thoughtfully arranged, and the manager Li of the main station was enthusiastic about service and guidance, which made our 2 days and 1 night activities orderly. There is a rainforest plank road in the north and the south, connected by boats in the lake, and the lake in the forest has a unique view; unique buildings, characteristic jade art, colorful leaves and flowers, sweet mountain springs and fresh air. Living in the academy, looking out the window, an ink painting is so beautiful! The breakfast is rich and varied. A great place to come again.

The key is that it is very dirty, and there is a musty smell that lingers. , The management and service of the entire hotel are superficial and flashy. Because the room is moldy, I want to change to the second floor, but it doesn't work. It is said that the second floor is full, but there are obviously vacant rooms, which is really hard to understand. I have a little sense of customer experience. Don't pay attention to it, the answer to the question is: We have received a lot of team guests here today, and we are too busy! Speechlessüòì, is good business a reason for service level downgrade?

As soon as I drove the car to the parking lot of Shenyu Island, I was warmly greeted by the front desk manager. After checking in, there was a one-to-one personal butler, Xiao Zou, who served 24 hours on WeChat. He responded quickly and took us to the academy room in a battery car. I was attracted by the room design that is completely close to nature and simple.

There are wine bottle coconut trees in the front yard, plantains in the backyard, and the scenery of Shenyu Island. Every day when the curtains are opened, there are all kinds of birds jumping on the windowsill. The natural environment in the scenic area is also very well protected. The north-south plank road is walked twice a day, which should have absorbed a lot of negative oxygen ions. There is also a wooden barrel footbath in the room.

The breakfast is also delicious and looks very healthy. The two-day dinner was pre-ordered by Xiao Zou. We tasted the restaurant‚Äôs famous grilled Dongshan lamb chops, stewed beef, Wuzhishan‚Äôs special deer tongue, banana leaves on the island, and fish in the reservoir. We drove from Sanya , From the hot and humid weather of 26 degrees to the forest full of negative oxygen ions at 20 degrees that day, it was so refreshing.

There was a small episode in the middle, and Xiao Zou immediately arranged to give the children two little rabbit dolls. My husband happened to celebrate his birthday during the stay, and he also gave a super delicious cake. The perfect holiday is here.

It is recommended to choose a high-end and chic style for the red lantern, otherwise it will make the whole decoration look rustic. , in contrast, the interior space is much better without extra festive decorations.

The house price is around 1700. There are many five-star options at the seaside. I really don‚Äôt understand what to do here. What do you think is a small island, but it is actually a reconstruction of a reservoir in the village, just like a large farmhouse! Don't book the lakeside room, because Ctrip won't tell you that this room type is their old room with a damp and musty smell. It's on the other side of the main building and you need to take a car to the main building!

msg:Never write written reviews, but this hotel and the housekeeper really made me feel compelled to do so

The design of the hotel is unique, the creativity of the Li nationality Longgui, the design of Amman, and the feeling of Southeast Asia in Sanya. It is very interesting to play in the rainforest after playing the beach. The hotel facilities are very new, with brand-name decoration, dry and wet separation of bathroom, automatic toilet flushing, Japanese-style tatami split-level, KONE elevator, coffee table, incense, tea set, and tea. The bedding is very new and comfortable, and the whole house has automatic curtains, which have a good shading effect. The infinity rainforest view swimming pool is a little small, and it is enough when there are few people.

The hotel is in the mountains, so you can only eat in the hotel restaurant. Before moving in, I was worried about the quality and price of the meal, but I thought too much. The breakfast dishes are rich, and there are all the things that should be there. For Chinese dinner, you can eat two restaurants. The western restaurant has good roast chicken, and the Chinese restaurant's noodles and stir-fries are also delicious, and the price is reasonable and market price.

The main attraction of the hotel is the Shenyu Island Scenic Area. Walking around the rainforest, stupa and Buddha, all kinds of tropical plants can't be seen. Hotel guests can take the ferry at any time, and they can call the hotel shuttle bus from the pier to the hotel lobby at any time, which is very convenient. When you see the shuttle bus beckoning, you can get on it, and the service staff are very enthusiastic.

Special thanks to the housekeeper: Zou Botao! First of all, he is tall and handsome, polite, warm and attentive to every detail. For my child's birthday, the butler contacted the western restaurant to make a cake, and helped me design it with heart. The cake blank is freshly made, very fresh, with just the right sweetness. There are candles and tableware, and he also helped me pack and make ribbons. This heart is precious. ! And gave our children gifts, very special gifts, the children like it very much. He is really attentive and thoughtful like a housekeeper. He answers every question and asks every question. After get off work, he still thinks about us and asks us all kinds of matters. Thank you! move! Such a person deserves to be well praised, worthy of respect and reuse!

1. First make a reservation through Ctrip, the transaction price is 1500+ (cannot be cancelled), and when you arrive at the store, you see the listed discount price of 1288? what the hell?
2. The room type chosen is a lake view villa room, don't be deceived by the name. It turned out that the hotel is divided into two parts. The lake view villa is about a 10-minute walk from the main building. After arriving, opening the room is like coming to a farmhouse (premium version). The front is blocked by a tree flower. I advise you to book a room in the main building when booking, and please mark Ctrip as a different building.
3. Look at Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 8. In this sanitation situation, the hardware facilities are also equipped with 1500? Whoever gives you courage is worth up to 600 yuan.
4. The good part is that the buggy brother is still diligent, surrounded by green waters and green mountains, but the scenery is artificial and too fake. Good breakfast.
But at this price, coupled with this hygienic situation, how did you rate it as 5 diamonds? In addition, looking at the previous evaluation, the housekeeper XX and the waiter XX have no such trea**ent at all. I seriously doubt that the previous evaluation was brushed out. Well, this trip to Hainan has extremely high expectations and is indeed the worst hotel. out. We advise you to book carefully

Nature.
Let's talk about the overall feeling of the hotel; the wooden house by the lake is very quiet, you don't have to think about anything when you stay in it, and you don't have to go anywhere. When I went there, it was raining lightly, listening to the sound of raindrops hitting the banana leaves, sitting on the balcony, reading a book and drinking tea, I felt at ease.
The following is the service of the hotel: the overall service is very good, especially the front office staff. When checking in, the front desk receptionist handled the formalities quickly, introduced comprehensively, and liked the arranged room very much, thank you! Since getting off the bus, he has been helping us with our luggage. The concierge who drove us to our room was very professional, and introduced us to the scenic spot and the time of each business point along the way. Fruits were provided in the room, and small cookies were provided when the bed was turned down, which was delicious. When we checked out, the concierge who picked us up quickly drove a shuttle to pick us up when we got the call. The security guards up and down the slope of the hotel gate are very kind. Overall, the experience was just right, I don't like overservice myself, so I felt comfortable coming here.
A final suggestion: the local specialties of the Chinese restaurant are good, but when I went there, I didn‚Äôt know if it was because I arrived earlier and just opened, and the tables were not cleaned. In addition, when eating breakfast, I also encountered the situation that the table was closed before the meal was finished. Hope the management can spend more time on the training of staff standard operating procedures.

msg:After arriving at the hotel after 12 noon, I was told that I couldn't check in! When I contacted the hotel before going, I was informed of the arrival time, but the hotel did not inform me and I waited until after 1 o'clock to check in. The firewood fish ordered at noon arrived. It had been an hour since the ingredients were put out. It was not fresh at all, and it was covered with soot. The waiter said it was blown in from the chimney of the next table. When I was about to eat at the Chinese restaurant at noon the next day, someone told me that the Chinese restaurant would not be available for the wedding. When I arrived at the hotel, I asked about the situation and dining time of the Chinese restaurant. No one told me at all. In the end, I had to drive more than 20 kilometers to Wuzhishan to eat. of rice. I think Shenyudao Hotel‚Äôs main focus is service and experience. If it doesn‚Äôt even have basic services, is it still worth the price? Very disappointed. I will tell my relatives and friends to stay away from this hotel in the future.
