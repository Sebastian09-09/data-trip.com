Getting taxis can be a nightmare but the staff can help use taxi apps to help you. Would stay again as room is a good size and bed was big and comfy. Just hoped they got rid of the smoking area in the front of the restaurant because you have to walk past it every time you go in and out!

The room is very clean and compact, the TV can be projected, and you can also pay to watch movies.

msg:I came to the Sixth Hospital for follow-up consultation and chose to stay nearby. The experience was very bad!

The first room we arranged was on the fifth floor and had a pungent smell. After communication, we moved it to the fourth floor. The musty smell still hit our face when we entered the door, and the wallpaper was obviously moldy. Unfortunately, my husband had a high fever at the time and needed a break, so he could only open the window for ventilation. I reluctantly checked in, but from nine o'clock to eight o'clock in the morning, the noise of moving goods and construction downstairs did not stop, but the musty smell in the house was too strong, and I couldn't sleep with the windows closed, so I didn't get a good rest all night.

After communicating with the front desk, the front desk said that they did not hear any noise on the first floor and asked to come to the room to listen, but I refused. It was almost one o'clock in the morning and my husband had a high fever and really didn't want to be disturbed.

Although you can't expect too much from a fast hotel, rooms with obvious problems like this should not be open to guests. I advise everyone to avoid lightning.

There are tea/coffee stains on the bottom of all the cups in the room. 2. The washing tray is very dirty, with traces of some unknown liquid solidified.

The staff speaks softly and will say hello when they come back from a trip. This is considered close to five diamonds for the time being.
I didn't pay close attention to the cleanliness of the room. When I went to bed at night, the quilt shook, and the dust was like a colorful galaxy. I immediately sneezed a few times🤧. Have you not considered the problem of dust mites? Four diamond hotels will not have this problem.
The drinks in the minibar really don’t match the Five Diamonds, Coke, Sprite and Orange.
As for breakfast, the variety is average and the ingredients are okay, but the price of 158 is a bit unmatched.
The most important thing is that this room is too stuffy and hot, the air conditioning is 21.5, it is cold without a quilt, and I sweat a lot. The bed is too soft, and the pillow is so soft that it is invisible. How can I comment on this? I didn't sleep well anyway.
All in all, I just had the same feeling when I stayed there. It didn't match. It got five diamonds, but four diamonds were barely adequate. But the front desk staff matched.

msg:1. The biggest drawback of the room is the sound insulation and privacy of the bathroom and bedroom! There is only a curtain to block it. The curtain is electric, but when the light is turned on, it is completely transparent. And there is no door to block it. If one person is washing inside, the sound outside will be very loud. It’s really hard to put into words.
2. The light ***** in the bathroom fell off when I was staying. Because it was midnight, I didn’t want to bother the front desk. It should be a sensor, and it stayed on all night.
3. Around seven or eight o'clock in the morning, there was a loud noise in the corridor for 10 minutes, either from the cleaning staff or from the residents.
4. The overall breakfast environment is good and Zen, but the variety and quality are average.
5. The location is average. There is a very quiet small shopping mall next door, and there is a supermarket on the basement floor.
6. The service attitude of the service staff is very good.
7. The bathroom in the room is very large. The toilet is at the entrance and is separated from the bathing area.

In short, I think it’s okay to just stay at an express hotel and don’t have such high expectations. But for a stay that costs almost thousands, wouldn’t it be nice if I added a few hundred more to stay in a 5-star hotel?

msg:The entire hotel is mainly designed in Chinese style, with bright red as the embellishment. I don't like the red color of the aisle carpet. The room has its own small scene, which is quite elegant, and the hall looks like a tea room.
The service staff are quite enthusiastic and kind. The doorman proactively helped with luggage and had a very good attitude.
The room is clean and tidy, and some of the little details are quite interesting. For example, the shampoo and soap are all made of essential oils, which are more moisturizing and have a better fragrance. There is also a foot bath equipped with traditional Chinese medicine foot bath bags.
There are shopping malls around so you don't have to worry about eating and drinking, which is very convenient.
A room costing more than 900 yuan, not including breakfast, is not very cost-effective.

msg:I chose this hotel when I was working nearby. The overall Chinese style is slightly better than expected. The main thing is some of the details that impressed me. For example, the elevator can be accessed directly by swiping a card without having to press a button. There is a footbath and a medicine bag in the room (the bathtub takes up too much space and is not available). Use, the footbath is so good! Take a dip before going to bed), the hair dryer is Dyson (10,000 positive reviews), there is an electric towel rack, and the minibar is free for the first round (there are quite a lot of drinks, although I don’t drink it, but there are probably many people who like it) Happy), the service staff at the front desk and foyer are very polite, neither overly enthusiastic nor indifferent.
There are not many varieties of breakfast in the hotel, but I think it has everything it should have. It is more Shanghai-style, such as noodles with toppings, rice cakes and so on.
The location of the hotel is relatively central. You can reach Hang Lung within a short walk. The weather in Shanghai is suitable for walking.

Service: The front desk was proactive and polite, and even took the initiative to help upgrade.

Facilities: The quality of the equipment is in line with the pricing, and the layout of the bathroom is a bit cramped. The room also has Chinese-style landscaping, which is very Zen-like. The room is well soundproofed and you can barely hear outside sounds.

Minibar has a wide variety of drinks, including the national brand Arctic Ocean, which is in line with the positioning of new Chinese style and has a little surprise. (Although I don’t drink sugary fizzy drinks.)

The bonsai in the elevator hall is also good, but the only pity is that it is fake. Of course, if it were real, the maintenance cost would be slightly higher.

However, the check-in experience turned out to be very poor, and the hygienic condition of the room was average. Maybe the room was not kept clean due to the high occupancy rate during the Spring Festival! The worst thing is that the very disturbing sound started after 12 o'clock in the evening.

When I opened the curtains the next morning, the window was completely broken, and the glass might splash out at any time. I was terrified when I thought about it.
Later the manager changed the room for us and the new room was much better. But before the front desk arranged such a room, I was a little angry when I thought about it.

I have never stayed in such a noisy hotel at this price range. The colleague who checked in at the front desk also asked the customer to add the customer's WeChat account, and asked the customer to copy and paste the hotel review on Ctrip according to the text she sent. I was shocked, brother, how much does it cost for the customer? I'll let you arrange it. The experience was very bad!

msg:Because my child's college entrance examination is in Xuhui Middle School, I looked for a hotel nearby, looked at several hotels, and finally chose this one. I came here at noon on the 6th. I noted that the college entrance examination should be quieter. After I arrived, I was upgraded to room 921. Not bad. The hotel also sent a small gift😀
Compared with the real five-star hotel, it is a little bit lacking. There is no bathtub, and there is no writing desk in the room. There is only a small round table. Other facilities are good, and the decoration is very Chinese and elegant. The service is really good, and if there is a need, someone will solve it as soon as you call. And the hotel staff are very enthusiastic, and they will say hello when they see it. There are both Chinese and Western styles for breakfast, including Hong Kong-style refreshments, sushi, pastry, noodles, and various side dishes. You wait for someone in the hotel lobby, and they will also pour you a glass of water.
Next to it is Nanyang 1931 Plaza, which is very convenient for eating. There is also a Hema member store, and there are many places to eat around. It takes more than 10 minutes to walk to Xuhui Middle School, and shared bicycles are even faster.
All in all, the accommodation experience was good and worth recommending.

The other thing is of course that the hotel is very caring. It adopted a stray cat.

The hotel staff took good care of it and saw many guests walking by. Pass by and check it out, it is indeed a lucky cat, full marks, I will choose this place again when I come to Shanghai in the future.

msg:I booked this hotel the day after I came back from Disney in order to catch the high-speed train. I booked it casually after seeing good reviews. First of all, no staff contacted us to confirm the check-in time before and on the day of check-in. Until we arrived at the hotel to check in at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night, there was no staff to receive us. We had to drag our large and small bags to check in. During the process, I asked the staff about the room upgrade rights that Ctrip members had redeemed when making reservations. I was told that the rooms were all sold out that day, and I could only upgrade when I come next time. During the subsequent processing, the system automatically said that I could upgrade, and I was assigned a room. In the tail room next to the linen room, there is a linen cart at the door of the room. When you open the window, you will find an equipment platform. Because I was too tired that day and didn’t want to bother with it, I didn’t say anything. Around 7 a.m. the next morning, there was suddenly a violent sound of the bed being dragged upstairs, which lasted for 20 minutes. My friend and I were woken up early in the morning. We booked a late check-out until 2 o'clock, and went out to get a takeaway at 11:30. The room card could not be entered into the room. We ran to the front desk and was told that the check-out time was approaching and we had to set the time again. The advantage is that the hotel is relatively close to several surrounding business districts, and there are robots that can deliver takeaways upstairs. However, I feel that the hotel staffing is insufficient. The check-in area in the lobby has always been busy and there are no other staff to divert. The check-in experience is very bad, and the service attitude of the staff on the night of check-in is also poor.

I have to boast that the usage rate of the foot bath is much higher than that of the bathtub, but there are a few things that I am not satisfied with: 1. The light at the entrance is too dazzling, especially when we open the room. When the wardrobe looked up. 2. In the past few days, I will be woken up by the sound of dripping water in the middle of the night every day, which seriously affects my sleep. 3. It is recommended to replace the welcome fruit with foods that do not cause allergies. As far as I know, quite a few people are allergic to mangoes. 4. The bathroom door easily hits the hot towel rack behind.

msg:When I walked into the hotel, the environment was very good, but when I checked in, I was told that I had to pay for the parking fee myself, which cost 96 yuan a night. I had a lot of questions in my head at that time. I didn't see this item when I made the reservation. The waiter said it was available on Ctrip. I opened it and asked him to look for it, but he couldn't find it after searching for a long time. It means that even if there is one, it is in an inconspicuous place. The parking fee is understandable, but if I can inform it in a conspicuous place when I make a reservation, then I can choose not to make a reservation. In addition, After making the reservation, a cell phone number called me and asked me if I was sure about check-in. I felt very strange. I had already made a reservation, and I still had to call to confirm. They talked a lot of nonsense and did not prompt me on the phone. You need to pay for parking by yourself, the experience is terrible. Later, the front desk staff felt that I wanted to complain, so they called me and said that the parking fee could be waived. When I checked out in the morning, I reported the license plate to the waiter and entered it on my mobile phone. Instructions can be dispensed with. Then there was an episode. When I checked in, I was asked if I wanted breakfast. I said no, breakfast was 96. Then I was told that the parking fee was 96 per night. If I wanted to waive it, I could get half off by booking breakfast. Is this a marketing ploy? It's so insincere. Sincerity is the most important thing when opening a hotel and doing business. No matter how good the hardware is, there are so many tricks, but the experience is too bad.

The decoration of the hotel is not eye-catching from the outside, and the decoration style of the room is also very ordinary. However, the hotel's facilities are very complete. Everything you can think of is available. The hair dryer is from Dyson, there is a towel rack for drying towels, and the toilet is smart. I stayed for four nights and did not ask for room cleaning. There are plenty of toilet paper and facial tissues. Yes, no need to add. The most important thing is that the WiFi signal is excellent. It’s so good that I can’t believe it. I haven’t even encountered it in a five-star hotel. For a person who loves to play games, it is simply amazing.

But the hygiene of the room is really average, including the cleanliness of the toilet, towels, tabletops, etc. I read in the comments that many people said that the footbath pool is very good. To be honest, this pool is the one that makes me feel the most uncomfortable. , it makes me feel like I spent more than 1,000 yuan to stay in an hourly room in a pedicure shop! There are no disposable bags that can be put on. I want to ask, who is responsible for athlete's foot in such a public pool? ! Therefore, as a person who has stayed in hotels for a long time, the design of this footbath pool in the room is cheap and out of place. The breakfast is quite rich and tastes very good. The noodles are delicious and paired with Shanghai spicy pork. In terms of location, it is not awkward to take a taxi to get to Grand Gateway Hang Lung.

Everyone in the service staff is gentle and considerate. It rained on the day we went to Disney, and ginger soup was prepared for us in the room immediately, which was really heartwarming.

Environment: It really has Chinese style beauty, but it is not old-fashioned, and has the aesthetics of getting up and down

Hygiene: very clean very clean very clean

Facilities: The shower room in the room is very large, and the shower head is also very large and comfortable. I can only wash my hair every day to use that super large shower head! The hair dryer is from Dyson, and the bathroom accessories are up and down, with a woody fragrance.

The first round of Minibar is free every day: drink a lot, all of which are delicious, but there is a bottle of "Laoshan Baicao Water" mixed in it, which is a taste assassin, please pay attention!

msg:Store Name: Shanghai Xujiahui Xiyue Hotel
Address: No. 118, Puhuitang Road, Xujiahui

It can be called the worst hotel among the hotels I have stayed in. The location is very remote in an alley, and the surrounding facilities are not convenient.
hotel service:
The front desk reception has a normal attitude, and there is no enthusiasm in the comments. It is a mechanized process service; as a luxury hotel service staff who takes the high-end route, they don’t even say hello to the guests? There is also sanitation, crumpled sheets, black carpet, hair in the drawers, and poor sanitation supervision. This is really not what a star hotel should have.
Hotel breakfast:
There are quite a lot of breakfast items in the hotel, but they are not very tasty and they have not replenished the dishes for a long time. The fruits are not fresh, and some of the staple foods have disappeared after eating. The taste of the drink is very strange. Already.

It’s a hotel with more than 1,000 nights. The room is ridiculously small. The sound insulation is so bad that you can even hear the neighbors talking when you open the door. Some facilities in the room are also broken, and there are no facilities such as a gym or a swimming pool. I don’t know where the courage to set such a high price is. It's really not worth it at all. I planned to stay for two nights, but I checked out after staying for one night. The check-in experience was extremely poor.

Accidentally broke a teapot, said to be high-quality things, to pay 563 yuan, the naked eye can see that it is very ordinary, the most things are less than 100. The whole feeling is to be cheated, and it is impossible to live again next time. Generally speaking, the hotel’s self-indulgence feels great, but I really think it’s too bad. The hotel’s configuration services and prices don’t match at all!

Although the location is not a prime location, the overall check-in experience is very good. Every staff member will greet you when you see me. When I see me on the phone and it is inconvenient to press the elevator, they will also help. The service attitude is very good.
It was my birthday on the day of check in and the manager presented a birthday cake as well as coffee and afternoon tea
The room is tidy. After the room is cleaned every day, enough water will be added. New slippers are not like some hotels. The tea bar is also free.
The hotel also has its own kitten, which is kept at the entrance of the hotel. It is quite cute and can be licked when passing by.

The replies from the hotel on both occasions were very warm-hearted, expressing their full service to the college entrance examination students. When I checked in, there was a special edition red can of Coke for the college entrance examination, and a card for blessing, which was another surprise. It is worth mentioning that the hotel has a robot to deliver food, which can deliver the food ordered by the guest to the room from the door of the hotel without contact.

I especially like the design of the bathroom. The space is very large, and there is a roller shutter between the sink and the bed. The roller shutter is opened to increase light transmission, and it can be closed when privacy is needed, which is very clever. On the day of check-in, it happened to be Women's Day. Angela at the front desk helped with early check-in and room upgrade. She was considerate and had just the right enthusiasm. I will stay at this hotel next time I come to Shanghai :)

msg:I need to do a very important interview, and my family background is too messy. I looked at many hotels online and finally chose this Xiyue Hotel because I saw that the online rating is particularly high, the hotel environment is also very good, the environment is clean, the room layout is very good, and the simple Chinese style is very suitable. The background of the tea drinking space is particularly good, so I chose it for the interview. The service is very thoughtful, which makes people feel very comfortable. The problem is handled quickly, the service attitude is good, and it is better than some old hotels. It is really not easy to do so much service and details in this price range. Their humanized service is in place. I added Wang Tingjun’s housekeeper WeChat and he will reply to any questions as soon as possible. The attitude is very good. The other waiters are satisfactory from the basic etiquette, reception attitude, and service awareness. This is what I value more. I have dissed many hotels because of service attitude issues before. The hotel decoration is not exaggerated, gorgeous but temperament, and the degree is very well mastered, which makes people want to stay in the public space. The hotel is very convenient and the location is very close to the subway. Although I took a taxi, there was a small episode when I came. The driver was unwilling to send me to the lobby door. It was really insistent and strange. There are several business districts nearby, which is very convenient. There are many delicious foods. The hotel is also equipped with many free services. There is free laundry in the room and free afternoon tea in the lobby. The taste is not bad. I would like to emphasize that the first round of drinks in the small refrigerator in the room is also free of charge, which is very surprising. When checking in, a butler will deliver tea and hand towels to customers, and will also provide beautiful Chinese-style welcome fruits. They are not wrapped in plastic like some hotels. They are celadon high-legged. The fruits are carefully selected and matched with the style. The layout of the room makes people relax, very stable and transparent. I guess the elders will like it too. It can be said that it is one of the best domestic service hotels I have experienced. The others are Tianjin Ritz-Carlton, Beijing Four Seasons, and Suzhou W. I think each hotel has a different temperament. This one makes people feel very warm. There is no feeling that our hotel is very **. It just cares about you and serves you. This is really heart-warming. It is rare to provide this feeling. Polite and considerate, the sense of distance is well grasped, not far but right there, it feels like picking up a treasure! This feeling can basically only be experienced occasionally if you stay at 2,000 a night. Everyone knows how badly Beijing Aman has been criticized. Because the experience is very good, I will try the dishes next time to see how it is. This time I had a big meal at the Italian restaurant opened by a friend next door. The wine is good and cheap, and I can open a bottle without thinking. It is said that the main feature is as warm as home and 24-hour service, so I asked for a nail clipper in the middle of the night, and it was delivered immediately. I didn't have to wait for a long time, and I was very satisfied. Their skin care products are from Shangxia. It is the high-end furniture brand in Shanghai. The smell is a woody and neutral fragrance, which is atmospheric and not picky. It also matches the Chinese temperament. Shangxia is also a local brand. I feel that the hotel really has requirements for itself. So I decisively took away the toiletries. I asked and found that parking is very convenient, and it is no problem to drive here. The sense of design spreads in all details, and as a former designer, I feel extremely comfortable. And all the appliances are very new, the hair dryer is Dyson, the towels are very thick and fluffy, the smart toilet, the softness of the pillow, and the care can be seen everywhere. The tea set is a set of three very beautiful, also made of celadon, with a glaze that is not bright and pure and soft, which is better among celadon. However, the room is equipped with tea bags. It would be better if there were tea leaves, but there are no six-star hotels, so should I ask for it? Luke, the butler Wang mentioned earlier, helped me a lot during my stay. He kept in touch before I checked in. From checking in to leaving the hotel, Mr. Wang fully demonstrated the qualities that a practitioner in the hotel industry should have. The service details can be said to be comprehensive. It is recommended that the hotel give Mr. Wang a chicken leg to retain such a good employee. Xiyue Hotel surprised me during my stay. It really feels very proud that a domestic brand can do this. Small details such as greetings give you warm and enthusiastic warmth, without being particularly deliberate, and the training has been worked hard. It seems that warm home is not just a slogan to bluff people, but a bit of hotel humanities. Thanks to all the staff I came into contact with, I was very satisfied with my stay in the hotel! Next time the elderly at home come to visit, I must arrange for them to stay, because I feel they will like it very much. Especially the mattress is in line with their aesthetics of the bed. I didn't take many photos, these are just some of my favorites, not my usual quality. It's really worth staying here.

After comparing and selecting the same price nearby, I decided to choose Xiyue. Here are a few points to share: 1. The service is not to say, the front desk is gentle and polite, and the polite are all a little embarrassed. Children's slippers and toothbrushes are provided Car toys, no request at check-in, all were raised by the front desk, and I booked not a suite, but an ordinary room, the child accidentally stepped into the landscape pool outside the lobby door, the staff immediately apologized and provided towels, truly a guest First; 2. Environment: The room is wooden floor except for the toilet, but there is carpet in the middle of the bed. It is very clean, not outdated, and the equipment is very new. Compared with the aging hotel, there is a living mall and box next door. Horses, Tims coffee, Starbucks, WAgas, etc.; 3. B2 parking is very convenient, 12 yuan per hour, 8 hours capped overnight 96 per day; 4. Check-in and check-out front desk will help with luggage, send them to the room to help take out slippers, said Drink potato chips in the refrigerator are free for the first round of drinks every day, family travel is very good, all aspects are very meticulous

Disadvantages: 1
This room type is the last seat in the last room in the corridor. I don't like the last room very much. I asked the front desk and said that there is no way to change it unless you increase the price to upgrade the superior double room.
2. The air conditioner in the room is above the bed. Because of the limited space in the room, I blow on the top of my head almost all night. It feels uncomfortable to sleep.
3. There is no refrigerator in the room, it is not convenient to put food, and there is no coffee machine but there is a one-time espresso liquid. It should be there after looking at other people’s pictures. Maybe my room type is not worthy of having a machine at this price, haha
advantage
1. Auntie is very careful because I brought the disposable sheets myself. Auntie didn't forget to tidy the quilt cover and sheets for me while tidying up.
2. The hotel environment is very good, the whole has a kind of essential oil aroma, which is very relaxing, and it is quiet to sleep at night, and the sound insulation effect is good.
3. It's very convenient to eat and shop around. There is a big shopping mall next door. You have everything you need, and it's also convenient to take out.

msg:It feels a bit bad, not as good as Atour next door. When we buy a package that includes breakfast for our customers, we should normally put the breakfast coupon directly into the room card and give it to the customer. The front office will also ask the customer if they want breakfast. Breakfast has been purchased, and it is the customer's right to eat or not. You should directly give the customer a breakfast coupon. I have also worked in a high-end hotel myself, and I know the rules. Moreover, the breakfast coupon is more than 200 yuan more than the one without breakfast, and I didn’t offer to give it to me even after purchasing it. I have never seen such poor hotel service. The customers were so frightened that they didn't dare to ask for breakfast coupons. They thought they had to pay and didn't dare to eat. The performance is really bad

msg:The air conditioner was blowing all the way. I wanted to change rooms, but was rejected. I complained and asked for coordination, but it was too late. I didn't want to go through the trouble, so I didn't change rooms. I didn't sleep well all night.
Because I caught a cold the night before and suffered muscle spasms in my shoulders and back on the way to the airport, I was diverted to the hospital and missed my flight.
The electric curtains were broken, the guest control and shower switches were confusing, and the room felt extremely small.
It shouldn’t be the performance of Huazhu’s high-end brand.

msg:The impression of the previous stay is still very good, and the room is clean and the screen projection function can also be used normally. This time I went to the room at the innermost point. At any rate, it was also a silver card member with a very small area and thought I was staying in an express hotel. I live here mainly to cast screens. I went to the store later and wanted to watch a movie and fell asleep. The TV network has not been connected. Then I sent a master to repair it. It was almost 9 o’clock at the time... Finally, the master didn’t fix it even if it was too late. Well... the hotel didn't say that it would change rooms or the like, this price will definitely not come after this experience...

But it may be a new hotel, with wooden floors or something. When I just entered the room on the first day, the hot flashes in summer will have a bit of a smell. If I do more ventilation, it will be better, and it will be fine in the next few days. Will consider staying again after three months.

msg:Even one star is more than enough. Here are a few points for you:
1. It used to be a quarantine hotel,
2. The waiter is very slow in delivering things and has a very bad attitude. If you want to be a five-star hotel, please keep up with your service attitude and not come here to see you making a bad face!
3. Parking in the hotel was free before, but now I deliberately don’t give you parking. If you want to park for free, first help me open a 298 membership. It’s too routine for me to go there. I only get three parking coupons when I top up the membership. You can only enter and exit once a day. It’s full of bugs.
4. The room is very small and the room type is very strange. I want to upgrade and pay more as a member hahaha

服務：前台和打掃衞生的阿姨態度都很好，也很耐心
作為徐家匯區域目前最新的同類星級標準酒店，免24H停車費這點真的太貼心了，大部分來都是商務為主，開車在所難免。

msg:原本訂的是經典大床房，到店之後，工作人員告知説，經典大床房兩人住會偏小，而且剛好在每一層頭尾，建議我們花多99塊，升級成豪華大床房，體驗會更好。

豪華大床房有30多平，兩個人住還是比較舒適的。房間裏面空間利用很不錯，廁所推拉門的另一側的穿衣鏡，實用又放大了空間。

床邊放了小圓桌，休息喝茶聊天挺舒服，還有比較中式美學的牆上陳設，是設計上的加分點。minibar第一輪也是免費贈送的，體驗感較好。

美中不足就是地理位置，距離地鐵站有一段距離，步行需要十來分鐘。當然也不算太遠，看需求了。整體入住體驗還是舒適的。

入住還可以，本身定的房型被告知是每層樓的首尾，加上金鑽特權以及多加了219升了房型外加早餐，早餐種類還算豐富吧。
入住有送水果（蘋果+橘子），退房有送晚安茶
不過還是希望有點距離感，退房時候讓評價就不説什麼了，現在很多酒店都是這樣，但完全沒想到經理還會發短訊來説這個事情，以後真的不敢住了

環境：比起以往司空見慣的歐式風格裝修，這家酒店的古樸中式風格的確是讓人眼前一亮的。酒店坐落於徐彙區，鬧中取靜，距離地鐵站步行約有10分鐘的距離

設施：房間內有化粧鏡，非常好用～就是隔音一般般，偶爾會聽到隔壁開門聲

房間跟圖片看起來有點不付，應該是舊房，清潔也做得不徹底￼，剛進房間時地上居然還有上一個住客掉地上的水果。
地點不是很方便，離最近的地鐵站也要走至少10分鐘，夜晚走小路￼沒有街燈感覺有點危險，女生還是打車出行比較好。
還有一點比較個人的意見就是酒店沒有全身鏡，穿搭完只能照半身真的不是很友好，希望酒店能夠加設。
不過酒店使用機械人送外賣這點還是很不錯的~

早餐也比較不錯，很新鮮的食材
衞生也很不錯，主要是電子馬桶舒適性不太好，總體還是給好評

msg:首先從入住開始，前台問我是否需要加錢升級房間，還説我訂的房間非常小，我訂的房間小不小我心裏不清楚嗎？你們酒店的房間不能做大點嗎？然後我説不需要了，她又問我一遍，希望我升級房間，如果是免費升級，我也就升了，收費的，你還問我第二遍，就挺無語的，賣菜呢？
其次，酒店床頭的插座很鬆，充電器插進去就掉下來了。
再次，洗澡洗到一半，發現沒有沐浴露，給我放了兩瓶洗髮露和一瓶護髮素，真的很無語。好在送上來及時。還有淋浴的水，忽冷忽熱的，作為高端酒店這不應該出現吧。
還有就是，走廊沒有垃圾桶，好歹在電梯口放個垃圾桶吧。房間裏的垃圾桶那麼小，我想丟個大點的垃圾，都沒地方丟。
