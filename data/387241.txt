This is my second stay at the hotel and it was really nice, The breakfast is amazing and the buffet dinner was nice. We stayed at a twin room I wonder why they have such bad lighting though at night the room looks so dark. We had the same problem last time and we changed rooms and the other room had great lighting.

Staff not exactly attentive, they looked rather gloomy or exhausted. The swimming pool facilities are partly falling apart which is a shame, just not maintained or looked after well enough over the years. Loved the massive rooms though. Great location and easy access to the metro and railway station.

msg:I booked online through Ctrip because I had a meeting in Hongqiao, but a couple of covid cases popped up the day before and so it was not going to be possible to attend due to the risk of my health code changing to orange or red. As soon as I heard I attempted to cancel, but it was just inside the 24 hour non-cancellation period. Given that it was Covid-related I expected flexibility, so I got onto Ctrip, who contacted the hotel, but the hotel refused to refund or change. Not impressed at all. They could easily have pushed it out for a month or two and then allowed me to use it next time.

Good: the hotel is beautiful inside; very tasteful interior design and decoration. It has a very nice swimming pool with clear water lacking that strong smell of chlorine that indoor pools  often have. The sauna and hot water bath were really nice and relaxing. The breakfast buffet was really great with lots of choices that would appeal to both Chinese and (most) foreign guests. The room  was spacious, had a very clean bathroom and a comfortable bed. The huge floor to ceiling window lets in a lot of light. Nearby is a Carrefour supermarket, with lots of eateries and cafes, including Wagas and Starbucks. Shuicheng Road metro station (Line 10) is a 8-min walk away, giving easy access to Hongqiao Railway station and other parts of Shanghai.

Bad: the hotel is not located in a very interesting area; transportation is needed to get to more interesting parts of the city. Plus the view from our hotel room was nothing to get excited about.

They allowed me to check in at 8:30am, and a late check out at 2:00pm the next day without any fees. Everything was great! A budget price, but still has the same amenities as a super high end hotel. The room was huge and spacious. Pillows were very fluffy. Lots of western choices in their breakfast buffet. Staff all speaks fluent English. Literally a five minute walk to the Shuicheng Lu Subway station. This hotel is nestled in Gubei District, a very nice, quieter part of the city. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

As a result, I was woken up by the sound of sudden brakes at 2:30. After searching around, I found that the window couldn't be closed. I called the lobby and the lobby arranged for staff to "close the window". It turned out that it couldn't be closed either. I directly called the engineering depar**ent to repair it on the spot. Can you bear this? After 40 minutes, the engineering depar**ent found that the lock cylinder was broken and couldn't be repaired, so they changed the room. There was no staff to arrange for the takeaway to be delivered to the room, so it was placed in a simple cabinet outside the lobby.

msg:50% of the customers are foreigners. It is very close to my destination. It is a proper five-star hotel with no problems and I can stay there without any worries.
Advantages:
1. The lady at the front desk helped me upgrade to the executive floor. The seasonal lychees are quite good (especially this year when the lychees are in short supply);
2. The room is clean. As a person with very easy allergies, I woke up without any allergies in this hotel;
3. Bathing: I am always afraid that the hotel shower will be unscrewed or the bath will be added with ingredients. I basically never use a large bottle of toiletries: but the hotel's ceiling shower and locked Jurlique make people feel very safe, and there is no need to worry about bathing;
4. The room is written as 40 square meters, but it feels more than that. It is more comfortable than many so-called 40-square-meter five-star hotels in Shanghai;
5. The lobby bar is comfortable, and it is comfortable to wait for the car or sit for a while

There are only two disadvantages:
1. It cannot project the screen;
2. Takeout can only be picked up at the door on the first floor, so it is almost impossible to order supper after taking a shower. I hope to buy a few delivery robots

msg:I have to say, I wanted to relax and stay here, and I checked into the hotel with trepidation. From check-in to daily cleaning, and then to the supporting facilities, it was really a healing journey. Every day, the cleaning lady would clean the room promptly, quickly and efficiently according to the instructions in the room when I went swimming, and folded my pajamas neatly. The swimming pool, jacuzzi and shower were all quite clean, and there was almost nothing wrong with them. Parking was also free, as long as you added the license plate to the room number. The view from the room was also great, and it was simply healing to look at the view outside the window while working. Finally, if I had to nitpick, it would probably be that the socket on the washbasin might not be voltage friendly, the hair dryer couldn't be used for anything, and takeout could only be taken by myself, not delivered to the door, and there was no robot to deliver.

After checking, I found that I didn't call the front desk. The person at the front desk said that someone would come to fix it. After waiting for 15 minutes, it came. A man was repairing it for five minutes. Shouldn't there be a spare room for me to change? He even found someone to fix it in the middle of the night, and even asked me to write a good review for him when I checked in! I didn’t write anything and he asked me if I had written it, so I just wrote a few sentences casually. He said he wanted to read it, so I showed it to him, then he took my phone away and started typing there. Follow up.

When I checked in the day after tomorrow, as soon as John Yao saw me checking in, he immediately reported that my reservation had already arranged a room. It was the room on the ninth floor the day before yesterday. The room was also reserved when I checked in in the morning, so I didn’t have to wait until 14 p.m. Rooms are only available at :00. With two enthusiastic and meticulous services, I felt even stronger at home. There is nothing wrong with the choice made over the past 10 years.

msg:A friend is flying from Shanghai and is just getting married. It is convenient to book a hotel near home. The price of a three-day luxury suite is more than 5,700. I will make a very objective evaluation.
First of all, the facilities are good, including the Dyson in the room and the Jullique toiletries, but but!

When I went to the toilet and opened the toilet lid, my long hair got stuck in the toilet and couldn't be flushed! It makes me sick.
This is not the most annoying thing. Then on the third night when I went back, I could swipe the room card for the elevator, but I couldn't open the door! The front desk made two new room cards and called a little brother to come and take us up. Then the waiter looked like he was awake and said oh without any expression!
My friend's husband was waiting outside the door with two suitcases, and the waiter opened the door and left! My friend was stunned! Is it because the tip was not paid enough? Or do you have no sense of service at all?

The most annoying thing is that when we arrived at the hotel that day, no waiter came to help pick up the suitcases. On the last day we took a taxi back to the hotel, and it was only after I shouted that he came to help. The key is that the suitcases were taken out immediately after they were taken out of the trunk! No one helped push you to the lobby. They just stood at the door and watched you push it in! ! ! ! !

I just want to ask you about training? Does your manager take care of the things that the hotel should have? This is the International Community Gubei. When the leaders go to your hotel and back, big banners are hanging, the car doors are open, and there are neat rows of people standing in rows. Why is the service so good at that time?
This is a hotel with no basic service etiquette. I really won’t stay there again! It's better to live in a nearby Hilton. I just wanted to be close to home and it turned out to be a surprise! I'm so angry. I really don't recommend this restaurant. The service is so bad. There is no doorman at the door!

The service attitude of the cleaning lady on the 7th and 8th of October was very good.

Do you have anyone who cleans the room early in the morning? Especially for parent-child rooms, shouldn't you be cautious before knocking on the door early in the morning? The hotel management has grossly neglected their duties. Or do you want to do something evil? If it had been a male waiter, I might have been so frightened that I would have called the police.

Although the hotel apologized and compensated afterwards. To be fair, the hotel environment is good, but this incident caused a huge psychological shadow to us, and we will never choose this hotel again in the future.

msg:The lobby is very grand, the restaurant serves both Chinese and Western food, and the hotel also has an exquisite back garden with a few geese, which the children love very much. The interior of the room is rather disappointing, the decoration is old, some places are starting to peel off, and the carpet is really dirty and hasn't been cleaned for a long time. The service attitude of the front desk is also very average. When I feel unwell and ask if the hotel at the front desk can provide any help, I don’t even think about it and say I’m sorry. It’s hard to imagine that this is the level of response of a five-star hotel.

msg:When I checked in, the front desk gave me a room upgrade, which was great.
The hotel facilities are still available, the room is spacious and bright, the bathtub is large, and the stay is very comfortable.
The breakfast variety is not bad, and the taste is also good.
The ecology of the hotel garden is very good, there are not only big geese, but also small squirrels.
The swimming pool is very large, and there is also a children's pool with toys in it, which is great. There are also saunas and soaking pools in the changing room.
The attitude of the service staff is very good, and the cleaning lady even gave me more water.
Two fly in the oin**ent points:
1. There are not many types of buffet dinner. The steak and lamb chops are seasoned. The kind of Korean barbecue is not too sweet, which is very unpalatable. The baked ones are also a bit old, in short, they are not worth the price, so I don't recommend them.
2. From check-in to check-out, no one asked me if I was driving. When I left the store, I drove to the door and was told to register, and then turned back to the lobby door. The doorman refused to stop and said to stop below. The problem is It's raining heavily, brother, how long will it take me to go in and register a license plate? And this is my fault? The means of dealing with things is still not soft enough.

msg:I need to stay in a hotel every month because of business trips, and Shanghai is often set at a five-star standard. This time, because of the distance, we booked the Millennium Hotel, but in the end, we will not book another hotel that has been blacklisted. 1- The overall facilities of the hotel are old and not cost-effective. It begins to reflect from the ground where the car enters the gate. The floor height of the corridor is very low. Even worse in the room, the mattress and pillows were uncomfortable. The water bar in the room is too simple. The bathroom wall tiles are about to fall off! The faucet is very inconvenient to separate the hot and cold water, and the wash basin is too small. The hair dryer is old and the socket in the bathroom is broken. We were given a room on the 4th floor landing and the window was broken and couldn't be repaired. I'm afraid I was worried that I would have to change the room on the third day, and finally said it was fixed. Everything in the refrigerator in the room is charged, and the price is outrageous. 2- Service is very average. I said I don't want a room at the end, but it turned out to be arranged in the last two rooms of the corridor. The moment I took the suitcase into the hotel and parked the car, there was a concierge standing at the door who was totally pissed off. The check-in at the front desk is also a cold face. Calling the front desk at night was busy for 20 minutes, and I waited another 20 minutes for a care package to be delivered. When I called again to deliver it, the waiter said a word without a temper and was almost throwing it into the room! 11 o'clock in the evening, this is disturbing your sleep, isn't it? 3- They all say that the breakfast is okay, but it can be advertised as a five-star hotel with a price of 1100 yuan. Isn't this a normal level? A lot of good reviews are for parents and children. I think it should be more demanding to travel with children, 4.8 points are doubtful!

There is no welcome at the door to help with luggage (large and small bags)
The curtains can't be closed, the light leakage is serious, you can see the picture, wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning, can you believe it
There was a loud noise outside the door in the middle of the night, I don't know what it was for
In fact, you don’t need to send the afternoon tea, because it’s better to use the budget to improve the service quality if the quality is poor (sincerely recommend)
There is nothing in the remarks (nor informed)

Advantages: The breakfast is really good, there are many types, and the taste is also very good. This is worthy of praise!

The lobby is spacious and bright, there are singers singing hard in the lobby bar at night, and the elevators run very fast. It looks like an overnight hotel for some foreign airline. When I checked in, I was nervous about the same room type. Mr. Jin at the front desk also helped me upgrade my room type and his service attitude was very good. The facilities in the room are also very clean, and the carpets are cleaned frequently. The only small regret is that my room type does not have a kettle, so I can't make tea if I want.

After I entered the upgraded room, I found that there were many executive benefits. I called the front desk and lobby manager to tell them that I could not enjoy the other benefits! And the upgraded room originally had free breakfast, which made me feel that the hotel took advantage of this matter. No one ever explained it to me. So even if you upgrade your room, you can't enjoy all the benefits of the upgraded room! And when I was taking a shower, the water suddenly stopped twice in just two minutes? ? ? ? So this problem is not serious? Oh, I am very disappointed. So you are treating consumers as **? !

msg:My husband’s work unit is relatively strict, and he is not allowed to go out of town in the short term. However, he is eager to travel, so he decides to take a two-day tour in the city. However, the recent weather in Shanghai is comparable to that of Turpan. After visiting this hotel in the city, I thought I could visit the nearby Takashimaya and Nanfeng Castle.
According to the reviews, the hotel facilities are relatively old. The room type I chose did not feel that way, but the hardware facilities did have some problems. For example, after the shower was turned off, water would drip from time to time, and it would be noisy to sleep at night; in addition, the reading lights on one side It can't be turned off. Even if the master control is turned off, it is still on, and it is drunk... The breakfast is not a self-service form due to the mask, but the quality of the dishes is still guaranteed, and the hotel staff are more friendly. The occupancy rate of the hotel is not high, but it is quiet. The weather is too hot and I wandered around the river and fled back. There were also a few geese and ducks by the river. Overall, the experience is acceptable, and I hope that the hardware in the room can be done better.

I ordered the Shake Shack hamburger and sent it to the hotel quickly, because the phone meeting was in progress, so I called The switchboard/bellman/manager on duty begged but refused to deliver. They had a bad attitude and said they were too busy to deliver. After more than 20 minutes on the phone, they refused to ask the hotel general manager/depar**ent manager. They had to go down and pick it up by themselves. The only way is to go to the lobby by yourself and see a bunch of employees. They are not busy at all. The burgers are cold outside. Ask the manager on duty if you are busy? The manager on duty kept expressing with a blank expression that delivery was not within their scope of responsibility. There were a lot of reasons for food safety reasons. It seemed that it was best not to stay in their hotel or bother them. He stopped a senior executive on the way to complain and asked the general manager to call back. 15 A few minutes later, I saw a female general manager who claimed to be a Hong Kong-American came up to apologize. A small hamburger can see the decay and decline of this so-called international hotel, and she left early decisively. But there are more employees than guests in the hotel, but if there is any crisis, they should be punished by the market or lose their jobs. They really don't deserve sympathy, because they really don't deserve to be in the industry of caring for people.

msg:The Millennium Seagull is a hotel that I will always support in the future, and its service attitude fully reaches the ceiling of a five-star hotel.

🚗 Transportation: Convenient, 5 minutes walk to Jincheng Road

🧹Hygiene: Clean, the room sheets and carpets are clean and odorless.

🍃Environment: The front is facing the elevated, enjoying the city scenery, the back is facing the garden and residential area, quiet and elegant, the favorite is the large floor-to-ceiling windows of his house. The gym is fully equipped, the swimming pool has a good view, and the sauna and hot springs in the locker room are all available, but it was closed after only one day of enjoyment due to the epidemic.

🔔Service: Super five-star, first of all, I booked a deluxe room. After staying for a few nights, because there were mosquitoes in the room, three were killed the next night, so I told the manager that I couldn't sleep well. The manager immediately arranged for me to change the room for free and upgraded the room type, and when I found a problem in the new room, he quickly solved it and sincerely apologized.
What moved me the most was that on the evening of the 28th, everyone tested their antigens, and there were abnormal guests. On the evening of the 29th, a lockdown was implemented. The foreign manager of the hotel led people to send notices one by one, informing them of the situation and reassuring everyone not to panic. Then there was an overnight meeting to discuss the plan, and a decision was made early the next morning. All guests were free of charge during the lockdown period, and the hotel would provide free three meals and daily necessities. Breakfast the next morning was accompanied by a handwritten postcard from the hotel: We dreamed that we were strangers, and woke up to find each other in love. To be honest, I was touched at that moment. This is the most humane hotel I have ever stayed in. It can be said that it is a template for thinking and solving problems from the perspective of customers. It is in stark contrast to those hotels that only think about making money under the epidemic and also launch isolation packages.

If everything goes well, there are still six days to lift the quarantine. I hope that the hotel business will get better and better after the epidemic. If you have the opportunity in the future, come and experience the feeling of home~

Breakfast: Maybe because of the Chinese New Year and the epidemic in the past two years, the business of the hotel is not good, and the breakfast is not as rich as before, but the restaurant is facing the small park in the back and basking in the sun, the warm sun in winter, it feels very good.
There is a small pool next to the swimming pool where children play, and a few children grabbed it all afternoon, very happy.

The most surprising thing is that in a place like Shanghai where every inch of land is so precious, the hotel also has its own garden. In addition, when we checked in, because we wanted the floor to be higher, the front desk helped to upgrade the room type for free. I will definitely stay again next time I go to Shanghai.

The most important thing is that because I chose the parent-child room with two single beds, I think differently, the hotel I didn't go to shirk the responsibility. After communicating with the beauty at the front desk, I also changed the room in time in the future, and I felt very satisfied. Because the check-out time on the second day was 14:00 at noon, but I could not feel that the hotel communicated with the front desk of the hotel due to special reasons. The staff at the front desk here had a very good attitude and gave a timely reply with empathy. Help me put away my luggage, and there is no extra room charge. I think it is very humane.

It is recommended to either modify the room type label and improve it. During the holidays, the occupancy rate is not high, the address is easy to find, next to the workers' sanatorium, there is a yard downstairs with many green plants. There are actually a lot of food and drinks around, the hardware facilities are OK, the swimming pool is not bad, the stationery in the room is more intimate for the children, and the bedding is also OK. For breakfast, the number of occupants may be less than half, and it's okay to eat casually, but I feel that the price of more than 800 yuan should be considered by other regular five-stars. Can't say I recommend it, I can only say it's good.

msg:The hardware of the hotel is good and the room is relatively large, but the breakfast priced at 228 yuan per person is really terrible! I really recommend that guests who stay in the hotel book a room type that does not include breakfast. Next to the hotel is Carrefour. Whether it is ordering takeaway or walking to breakfast, there are many options! It doesn’t matter if there are few varieties of breakfast. The breakfast served until 10:30. It is estimated that the staff are all staring at the stopwatch. Just after half o’clock, countless people rushed out from all directions pushing carts and rumbled to receive the meal, and they bore the brunt. All kinds of food clips were taken away to prevent guests from taking meals again, and then the chefs and waiters were dispatched to take all the remaining ingredients to the cart and push them away with lightning speed! The restaurant was cleared within five minutes! Regardless of whether the customer is still dining on site, the cleaning staff will come on stage to clean up! Very bad experience! Before staying at Ruijin Intercontinental and Shangri-La, there will be a friendly reminder from the staff near the end of breakfast: the breakfast time is over soon, if you have any favorite food, you can get more! In contrast, it really feels like heaven and earth!

We arrived at the hotel at about 21:50 in the evening. The staff told us that there is a menu for us to find in the room, but we couldn't find it, maybe it was because it was too late and didn't want us to order it; 3. When we went to breakfast in the morning, we were told that we could not enter the restaurant wearing slippers. The hotel has such a rule, and you still need to dress up for breakfast? In the end, we were forced to go upstairs to change our shoes; 4. The room fee was 1068, and the deposit of 1500 was paid, but the final refund was 386. I don’t know what was deducted. Maybe there was a minibar during the stay, but the first round The minibar soft drinks are free, and I don't want to worry about these dozens of dollars. I won't come back next time.

The next day, because the child needs to take an online exam in the afternoon, he still discussed with Mr. Liu at the front desk whether to delay the check-out. Mr. Liu agreed very humanely and made a late check-out sign, which is worthy of the service of a five-star hotel! awesome! It just so happened that the child's birthday was the next day. After I asked the front desk, the birthday cake was delivered in time. Although it was not big, it was exquisite enough to reflect the hotel's intentions.

Later, I asked someone who knew to come. I went to breakfast on the 13th floor the next day. I can only say that this breakfast is really inferior to the full-season breakfast...
2. The most annoying thing is that I returned to the hotel very late after dinner with the client at night, washed up and prepared to go to bed, opened the quilt and saw the bed sheet that made me sick (see the picture for myself), but it was a bit late. There is no need to toss the waiter on the early flight, but the hygienic environment is really unbelievable...

I went to the buffet at 6pm and found that there were no lights in the entire corridor. It's still black... Then I called the front desk and was told that the circuit on that floor had tripped in an emergency? After asking, I learned that our family lives on the whole floor, OMG...I am so light...I live in our family and don’t turn on the lights for us...I was "urgent" from 15:00 to 21:00... ………The hotel said that it would change floors for us. Considering that it’s late with the baby, I don’t have to worry about it. After 21 o’clock the corridor is finally lit up…. Regardless of the details, this is the basic failure of a five-star hotel. Okay... It looks like we have been in Yanbian. We booked a standard room. Okay, isn't the standard room equipped with corridor lights?
Of course, the layout of the parent-child room is still okay. It is more attentive. The restaurant and fitness center provide good services.
In addition, when checking out, there is no reminder that free parking needs to enter the number at the front desk.
In conclusion, I have seen the veteran five-star business hotel in Shanghai. I hope it is not representative of all, so I should not come again...

msg:At ninety o'clock every day, an aunt knocked on the door on time and asked if there were clothes for washing. She woke up the guests on the first floor and I was speechless. What is the difference between this and a county hotel.
In addition, there are generally problems with the front desk staff of this hotel. Once when renewing a room, the room door still could not be opened after renewing the room card. The waitress who looked like a front desk supervisor subconsciously said that this was the guest's problem. The guest did not renew the room card. Later, I found out that the problem was with the front desk and the card. This kind of service attitude is worrying. In addition, there are many idle old men wandering around the hotel lobby. They will press the elevator for you when you are in a good mood. When you are in a bad mood, they will stand there and watch and monitor the guests. Same. This is the worst so-called five-star hotel I have ever stayed in in Shanghai. If it is not impossible, everyone should choose carefully.

This is very suitable for Shanghai in this season. The breakfast is quite rich and varied. I like the yogurt and many kinds of bread the most. The waiters in the restaurant are also very enthusiastic! Overall I am very satisfied with this hotel next time I go to Shanghai!

There is no sense of service to welcome guests at the door; they will not open the door to say hello. This time I was quite speechless. I found that the bed sheets were dirty before going to bed. Although I don't know what it was, I felt disgusting to miss the traces left by my aunt. The hotel told me that the next room upgrade is the next time the room is upgraded. This kind of welfare is not worth it.

First of all, the room was big and spacious, and the swimming pool was unexpected, because with the children, I thought it was not a parent-child hotel with only one big swimming pool. Unexpectedly, there was a big baby pool, and the children were reluctant to come out. Afternoon tea is also delicious. After eating, I went to the hotel’s backyard and strolled around. The photos I took made didn’t let my friends see that I was in Shanghai. In short, I had a great time in the past two days. If I have a chance next time Will come again!

None of the information in the reservation was correct. The attitude was surprisingly bad. The breakfast waiter Mondy Extremely bad attitude. For convenience, I ordered a set meal that included breakfast and dinner. There were very few types of dishes and there was almost nothing to eat. It felt like a buffet in a high-speed service area.

There were shouts from women and children, and the sound of doors slamming super loudly. I am an ordinary person. People who were heavy sleepers were woken up three or four times. Finally, they couldn't bear it and called the front desk. The front desk told them to ask the floor aunt to come over and see if anyone was moving around. There was still a loud slamming of the door closing behind them, and I was woken up by the channel in the middle of the night. I’m really, really devastated. I don’t know who to blame. I’m very helpless. The nearby Hilton is much better in every aspect.

值得肯定的是，這家的房間設施還是不錯的，前台也給我升了一級房型，早餐除了一般的菜品以外，還有鵝肝醬，很值得稱道。
不滿的問題是對賓客的服務需求響應不足，那一天我入住以後就發燒了，詢問酒店有無葯箱備葯或者體温計，酒店均答覆稱沒有，我自己通過外賣方式購買後，酒店一開始還説所有外賣不能入內，這不是逼着發燒的我自己去拿嘛，雖然最後就經過溝通，酒店派禮賓部工作人員送了上來，但我仍然覺得如果酒店對於生病的賓客不能做到體諒的話，是和酒店的星級定位很不相稱的

雖然酒店的設施有點陳舊，但是屬於五星級酒店該有的東西都有了，況且不到千元的價格，還包括早餐，下午茶的，屬於性價比很高的了。

對了，住店還有免費停車。總之，在虹橋古北地區，是個非常實惠的選擇。

但是
我進了屋脱了衣服去洗澡，走到衞生間門口對着門的地方，保潔大姐呼啦推門進來了跟我面面相覷。然後大姐第一反應不是趕緊出去，是跟光腚的我一勁兒道歉，我是真有點無奈。
鑒於這次我是中午提前入住的，就不難為大姐了，也不在打分上難為酒店了，但是實在是😑😑😑。

希望酒店認真培訓員工。

兩個小問題：
1. 收費的薯條和蝦片放在桌上很明顯的地方，佔地方而且沒必要。
2.酒店室內温度調得太低了，要多穿點，娃回去打噴嚏打了好幾天。

攜全家從上海飛美國，在上海逗留三天，之前的酒店突然通知要被封控，攜妻帶子慌慌張張的換到千禧海鷗。雖然衹一天，又是臨時換到這裏，但給我們全家留下了很好的印象！尤其是在臨出國前，疫情政策搖擺不定，心情複雜至極。
但在這裏，無論入住還是退房抑或是孩子的一些特殊需求，酒店都給予了很多的關照和幫助，十分温暖的經歷！尤其是前台的小李和小姚兩位女孩子，印象十分深刻！感謝千禧感謝上海感謝朋友！

帶著小朋友入住真的不錯的。
