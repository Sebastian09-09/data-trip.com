msg:The hotel environment is good and relatively quiet. Because it is newly opened, the facilities are relatively new, and breakfast is fixed for each person. There are no children's toiletries yet. Overall, it is not bad, more suitable for older or young people to come and relax!

msg:A newly opened hotel with brand new room facilities. The front desk was very nice and helped to upgrade the room. The decoration style is very warm, just like the feeling of your own bedroom. The breakfast is very rich and tastes very good. The atrium garden is very beautiful, and the plum blossoms are in full bloom in winter. The location is also good, not far from the attractions in Jiaxing, very suitable for self-driving stay.

msg:The service is average; it's quite satisfactory; the environment is nice; the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant; the Chinese garden style! It's pretty good, but it's a bit far from various scenic spots; the breakfast noodles are delicious!

msg:The hotel's facilities and environment are very good and new! Although the breakfast is simple, it tastes good. Mr. Wang, the sales director, is also very hospitable and provides meticulous service throughout the whole process! I will come again next time.

msg:Objectively speaking, the hotel is newly built and the overall decoration is very good. Except for the toilet smelling like sewage and the TV series not being able to be played, there are no other problems. There are a few things I need to complain about. It was my first time staying in a hotel. When I finished drinking the water, I asked for mineral water and was told that I needed to pay. It was my first time to encounter a hotel that was open without a phone call. If I had any questions, I called the front desk on my mobile phone. It was my first time to encounter a takeaway that was delivered directly to my door.

msg:Great, the hotel is beautiful! The service attitude is super super good! ! The noodles for breakfast are delicious! The decoration is also very good! Everything is very complete, and the daily necessities are very high-end! It's not far from my home, I will come often in the future! ! ! I have to praise the front desk service attitude is really great! I checked out half an hour late and they didn't rush me! The layout is super big! Love it~ It's a pity that I didn't take pictures, I will make up for it next time!

msg:酒店蘇式園林風格精緻典雅，環境嫻靜、鳥語花香、小橋流水、水霧繚繞入仙境太讚了！客房簡潔舒適。餐飲早餐品種選擇不多但也完全夠了，麪條口感不錯，唯一缺憾晚餐散客衹有套餐無點餐。總體很滿意該有的硬件都有，性價比高。提一點建議酒店對員工需強化職業素養、能力、培訓！我所遇到的前台、客房、餐廳、環境清掃的工作人員都是面無表情也不主動招呼客人，前台個別人員業務不夠熟悉。本人出於善意，有這麼好的硬件設施應與服務同步。下午茶不錯👍
