msg:1. Five-star hotels only give 2 bottles of water, but Jinmailang still does. Some Hanting hotels even offer a farmer’s drink. It’s very hot in summer and it’s not enough. If I say it’s too hot, I’ll give 2 more bottles. I said five-star water is too low. Oranges are available all season. 3 stars are also farmers. When I said there was Yibao, I said my room was Jinmailang. After talking for a long time, I gave three bottles of Yibao 330ml. Is the cost 5 yuan?
2. Mainly because I wasn’t hungry. I had lunch at 3:30 in the afternoon and was too lazy to take out. When I saw there was a meal available, when ordering, it was told that we would charge a 15% handling fee for five-star meals. That was fine, but at the beginning, I had to round up the 1.5 yuan into 2. Yuan, it made me laugh. I said this, you can wipe out the change for me. Do you have legal support to overcharge me? Later I saw the hot pot noodles on my table for 8 yuan. It was super small but it was ok even if I wasn’t hungry. It turned out that the payment was based on 10 yuan for hot pot noodles. I called and was told that the price list in the house was old and had not been updated. How funny are you so good at supporting five-star level? It doesn’t cost much, but isn’t this considered fraud?
3. However, the breakfast is still okay. If it is good, then it is not good. I hope the hotel will strengthen its management and at least have unified prices for food orders. There are also five-stars that must have five-star standards.

The hotel has a swimming pool. The children had a lot of fun. Check-out can be delayed until 2 o'clock. It's very good. The facilities in the house are old. The shower water temperature is unstable. The shower is not easy to adjust. I don't like the smell of the carpet. The breakfast is OK. The hotel's own takeaways ordered at noon and dinner taste OK. The service charge is acceptable, but the experience is not good without informing in advance. Overall good review

Personal recommendation-the executive small bar is good, and the drinks that are not available in other hotels in the county are all available, exquisite!
The staff was very enthusiastic and gave me a ticket to the Folklore Garden (the next time I have a chance, this time I’m too in a hurry to give it to my friend), and the bath and swimming pool are all free tickets, which is a bit a**ospheric.
