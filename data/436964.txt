msg:The hotel is nicely positioned at the seaside of TaiHu in Huzhou. We went there to enjoy the hot spring pools during the recent cold wave in Shanghai. In winter time you won‚Äôt find many restaurants nearby the hotel but the hotel restaurant is nice as well. The breakfast is okay but focusses on Chinese guests. 

Unfortunately some of the hot spring pools were closed during our stay but the remaining pools were nice and during the whole time the hotel wasn‚Äôt crowded, so we found enough pools for ourselves. It‚Äôs a good place for nice 1-2 nights stay.

She got us settled, offered advice/tips and made sure we were taken care of.  Having the springs in the hotel was a perk.  A nice way to relax after a long day.  The rooms were comfortable and dinner at the hotel was pretty good.  About a 40 min taxi ride from Nanxun Ancient Town.  Would definitely recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing no frills weekend away.

Kids playground was small but enough for young children to enjoy. Location was quite remote and would need a car to get to nearest tourist location. No English speaking staff unfortunately which made some tasks like inquiring about restaurant etc challenging. Overall a decent hotel which for hot spring lovers is perfect.

msg:Friends who want to stay in the summer must read this very objective review of mine. If you find any lies or exaggerations, I will be struck by lightning!
It was a very bad stay experience. As soon as I entered the door, I found a lot of big mosquitoes in the entrance cabinet. I called the landline and asked the front desk for a mosquito coil. The toilet in the bathroom was a very old style. I had to flush the toilet at least twice to flush it clean! The mattress was the kind of mattress with obvious springs. The whole bed was shaking when someone got in and out of bed!
Here comes the point. The hotel air conditioner broke down at 1 a.m. The indoor temperature in summer reached 27.5‚ÑÉ. I called the landline to the front desk and the general affairs, but no one answered! I wanted to open the balcony door for ventilation, but the screen door was still broken and mosquitoes kept flying in. I couldn't sleep all night until 5:30 when I called the front desk. They arranged for the staff to come up and take a look at the air conditioner and sent us a fan with no cooling effect. The fan was also very loud. The hotel knew about this at 5:30 and no one came to solve the problem until we left the hotel at 8 o'clock. What's even funnier is that after leaving the hotel, I told me that the air conditioner was good and there was no problem at all!
The hotel communicated with me once on the same day and asked me not to give a bad review but to refund the room fee. Sorry, according to Article 55 of the Consumer Law, I have reason to ask for a refund of three times the amount of money for suspected false advertising. I have called Huzhou's 12345 and Ctrip's after-sales service phone number to report the situation. I want to see your attitude in Huzhou! 
If you don't want to be upset when traveling, please avoid this fake luxury hotel with seriously defective guest room facilities! 
Also, the lake view balcony is so deep that only one person can stand. It's a pure photo scam!

It's very comfortable to walk along the lake, full of oxygen ions. The only thing I complain about is the service. It can be said to be extremely formulaic. A lot of WeChat messages are copied and pasted, and then they look very polite and friendly, just to leave a good review. When I left, I asked the lobby manager for directions. He was extremely perfunctory and impatient, and he kept mumbling... He was completely different from the enthusiastic template on WeChat. If this is considered service, it's better to forget it. I originally wanted to have a good rest when I arrived at the hotel, not to have my phone ringing non-stop. I can only say that I may have had high expectations, but in the end I felt that the price-performance ratio was really too low...

msg:I took advantage of the short holiday to go out for spring and booked a small house with a nice environment. Parking is also very convenient, just park at the entrance of the villa area. The villa area is very close to the Taihu Lake. You can enter and exit by swiping the door card at the iron gate in Figure 2, and get close to Taihu Lake! There is an exclusive private hot spring in the yard. It is very comfortable and cozy to go back and soak when you are tired of playing. The housekeeper Xiao Chen is very warm and thoughtful in service, and the room he arranged is also relatively comfortable. He provided a lot of tips on attractions and food before checking in, and took the initiative to help us extend the check-out time. I will come again next time if I have the chance! üëèüå∑

msg:The housekeeper service was quite considerate, and we were upgraded to a lake view room. But the hotel's management philosophy felt a bit backward. At 8 o'clock in the morning, the waiter knocked on the door to clean the room... I was woken up before I even got up. There was a problem with the drainage in the room, and the repairman asked us if we had toothpicks to clear the drainage... We were speechless. Lying on the bed, bugs would fall from the ceiling and scare us... There were 2 breakfasts, but the children had to pay for each one. For a five-star hotel, these are really speechless. Hot springs are charged separately. The hotel's free entertainment facilities were all closed, including the gym, swimming pool, activity room... They were all closed. There were children's billiard machines and a football machine in the corridor next to the lobby, but the lights in the corridor were turned off. We had to play in the dark... The next day, the hotel had a power outage at around 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and my family was locked in the elevator, and the dark space was closed for 15 minutes... The hotel did not apologize or anything.

I can't believe this is a chain star hotel...

When I arrived at the hotel, the on-duty leader saw that I brought my child and took the initiative to upgrade my room and gave me fruit. The sales manager sent me a detailed introduction to local tourism and dining for reference, which saved me a lot of trouble in making a guide. Breakfast was also given.

msg:Let me talk about the conclusion first. The hotel has five-star experience and service at a four-star price. This hot spring hotel has complete facilities and convenient transportation. It is close to Taihu Lake and Nanxun Scenic Area. The wine spring is on the second floor of the hotel, making it a very convenient and comfortable place to stay. We set off from Pudong, Shanghai, and it took less than three hours to arrive at this hotel. We booked a highly rated hotel near Taihu Lake from Ctrip. It did not disappoint. We got a hot spring ticket when we entered. The experience was very good. Well, from the experience of our family of four, this hotel has several highlights. 1. Butler-style dedicated service, paying attention to details, contacting us in advance to arrange the location and room layout, and reserving hot spring tickets in the room at the front desk. Children's toothbrushes and small slippers are added to the washbasin and disinfectant alcohol is prepared. 2. The location is very good. It is near Taihu Lake and several ancient towns. You can soak in hot springs outside and inside. If you are not satisfied, you can also take a bath in the bath the next day. You can arrange to visit Taichi after visiting the ancient town and come to the hotel to take a bath in the evening. 3. It‚Äôs easy to order food in the evening. I ate a lot at Meituan Ele.me in the evening. The hotel has a robot to deliver food. It‚Äôs nice and smart. It‚Äôs a favorite among children. Let‚Äôs talk about an Internet joke, Suzhou Meiyoujiyang, Huzhou Meiyou Lake. When you come to Huzhou, you will find not only small bridges and flowing water, but also the night view of Taihu Lake. It is also a good choice to take a bath in Jiangnan instead of going to the Northeast. Finally, I would like to thank the WeChat service called Love Purple, thank you. z

The standard room with lake view faces the Taihu Lake embankment. The toilet seat can be seen on the balcony. The air is not very good after staying for a few days. One kilometer walk to Fisherman's Wharf with many restaurants.
The guest room is large in size and the layout of the cloakroom is very convenient. When using a bathtub, you can ask the housekeeper to provide a bathtub cover. Bedding is acceptable. Fruit snacks are delivered every day. The heating system was a bit noisy at night, but it got better once the temperature came up.
The breakfast during the New Year's Day holiday is very popular and has a wide variety of items, including Western pastries and Chinese stir-fries, as well as the local specialty Qianzhang Bao and the popular northern mutton steamed buns. There is no one to take a seat, so you have to find a seat by yourself during peak hours; empty plates are collected and meals are replenished very quickly.
Of course, the purpose of coming to Taihu Narada is to soak in the hot springs. There are at least 18 hot springs, including white tea, coffee, rose and other special pools. There are many people, but because there are enough hot springs, it is not crowded.
There is a children's playground on the ground floor, but there are no children, so there is no experience. However, it should be good to hear the laughter and laughter. The swimming pool is not open in winter and the weather is getting hot again.

msg:On the way back from Jiuhua Mountain to burn incense, we will pass by Huzhou and just stop there to spend the weekend.
I chose Taihu Junlan Hot Spring Resort Hotel, which ranked second among local hot spring hotels. But because the reservation was relatively last-minute, the hot spring bath house was already full, so I booked a deluxe lake view room.
The location is very good, adjacent to Taihu Lake, and you can walk to the edge of Taihu Lake. Especially in the morning, there are few people and it is comfortable.
The hot spring in the hotel is open from 13:00 to 22:00. There are more than ten open-air hot spring pools. The water temperature is around 40 degrees, which is very comfortable.
Breakfast is on the third floor, with both Chinese and Western options. Of course, the Chinese food will be better. Great variety and lots of choices.
The chess and card room, karaoke, gym, and children's playground are fully equipped and are very suitable for a family vacation.
When checking in, we added the butler Xiao Chen on WeChat. As soon as we arrived in the room, we received various warm reminders, introductions to surrounding attractions, and travel tips, all of which helped resolve our various requests. Attentive and patient service‚Ä¶

msg:What a great vacation experience! I have stayed at Liangzhu Junlan before and it was very cost-effective! Quite impressive! So this time I saw Taihu Narada, and it received very high ratings, and hundreds of rooms could be booked during the holidays, so I made the reservation without hesitation! It did not disappoint! When I arrived at the store, I met the enthusiastic manager Chen Xiaomei, who arranged a room for me according to my preferences. He also took the initiative to add my WeChat account and act as my butler, allowing me to experience the VIP-level trea**ent of being at home! After checking in, they took the initiative to send me the most comprehensive guide to eating, drinking and having fun, which is most suitable for people like me who are too lazy to make a guide in advance! After experiencing so many hotel butler services, I can say that Manager Chen is the first person who made me feel most attentive and warm! She feels that she cares deeply about her guests. She puts many things in front of her guests. She is considerate and responsive to every request. It is very touching! Although the hotel's facilities are not new, this kind of humanistic care made my experience really great!
The hotel can also be called a resort hotel. It is close to Taihu Lake. There is an outdoor swimming pool with children's slides in summer, and a hot spring with outdoor pool in winter. If you have nothing to do, take a walk by Taihu Lake. It is very relaxing! The basic room types are on the 1st and 2nd floors. This time I stayed in a room with a balcony. Although it faces north, it has a large space and a stylish bathroom layout. Although the twin beds are only 1.2 meters long, they can be put together, but the mattress is too soft! There is hand sanitizer, and there is actually a drinking water faucet! There is a large window next to the bathtub, which makes you feel like taking a bath! Disposable bath covers provided! The high area is the lake view room, so the lake view room also faces north. This is also the first time I am willing to live in a north-facing room. The rooms facing south are very ordinary, but the basic room type also has a bathtub. The hotel is also more a**ospheric, and they are willing to provide more drinking water! The breakfast is sumptuous, and the taste is a matter of taste. In short, it is very cost-effective!
The hot spring is a major feature of the hotel. There is a large indoor pool, a steam room, and I saw a family changing room, but I didn't go there. I don't know if it is possible for mothers to take care of their sons! You can go directly to the hot spring area without going through the changing room! The outdoor area is not very big, but there are about a dozen large and small bathing pools. The hot spring water is over 40 degrees Celsius even when the weather is below 10 degrees Celsius. It is very comfortable to soak in, and you don‚Äôt feel cold at all! The only drawback is that only one large towel is provided, and it was not replaced during the hot spring bath. I had to ask the front desk for a few more large towels before entering the locker room!
The hotel is also located in a relatively remote location. It is difficult to travel without a car. There are no places to eat around. Generally, it takes 5 minutes to drive to Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf or 10 minutes to Taihu Ancient Town. You can order takeout. There are more choices in Wuyue Plaza 6 kilometers away! Just give it one hour!
In short, I feel that the Narada brand is very trustworthy and the best value for money resort hotel!

msg:After staying for 3 nights, my first impression of Narada is: good service, many facilities for children, good value for money!

„ÄêLocation„Äë
The hotel is next to Taihu Lake, about half an hour's drive from Taihu High-speed Railway Station, and not far from Moon Wharf. In cool weather, you can walk along Taihu Lake Scenic Avenue to see the iconic Sheraton on Taihu Lake, and take a sightseeing cruise by the way Or a speedboat.

„ÄêRoom facilities„Äë
The lake view room I booked is located on the 5th floor, the view is great, the room size is quite ample, it is a pity that the balcony is a bit small.

The service is considerate and considerate. Fruits are delivered every day, and the cleaning is relatively clean and timely. Although the hotel introduction states that it pays attention to environmental protection and does not actively provide toiletries, but it will still provide extra if necessary. What needs to be mentioned in particular is that the hotel has a lot of children's products available, such as small slippers, footstools and small toilets, etc. It is very convenient to bring children to stay.

„ÄêHotel facilities„Äë
There are indoor swimming pools, outdoor children's water parks, indoor and outdoor hot springs, indoor children's playgrounds, etc. The main purpose of coming this time is to bring the baby to play in the water. The children had a great time, and those who like to play in the water should not miss it.

Outdoor hot springs are more suitable for soaking in cool weather. The water temperature is relatively high, and it is still too hot in summer.

There are three places for indoor amu*****t facilities, one is in the lobby on the first floor, which is similar to Tumbling; one is next to the cafeteria on the third floor, which is suitable for young children; and the other is next to the hotel lobby on the second floor, with mini billiards and table football.

Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the hotel‚Äôs dining. The variety of breakfast buffet is relatively rich, but you have to go early, because there are more guests visiting during the summer vacation, and some popular meals may not be replenished in time if you go late. In addition, there are not many restaurants nearby, and most of them are concentrated near the Moon Wharf. The main dishes are farm dishes. You can choose any one, and the taste is not bad. If you are not happy to go out, you can also try the hotel's own cafeteria. There are many dishes and the price/performance ratio is not bad.

All in all, the experience of staying this time is good, and the service is very good!

After reading the hotel‚Äôs reviews, I told my family to come and stay on the way back. I happened to see the hotel There was a group buying package for the event, so I immediately placed two orders.
I received a greeting call the day before check-in, confirming about when I will check in and reminding us to bring our swimsuits to enjoy the hotel's hot spring facilities. The check-in procedure was simple and fast. We even upgraded the room and added the butler WeChat. The butler service is very considerate. When we left the store, they even drove us to the parking lot with a battery car. Thank you!
The hotel is high-end and a**ospheric, with complete facilities, spacious rooms, comfortable layout, rich and varied breakfast, and good taste. Overall, it is very suitable for a family vacation!
Not far from the hotel is the Taihu Lake Scenic Area. There are many restaurants. After eating, you can go to Moon Bay to see the night view. The Rainbow Bridge and Sheraton's "toilet seat" are very beautifulüòÄ

The reception butler, Xiao Chen, is very warm and caring. He introduced the surrounding environment and the time points, which is very convenient.
The hotel is very large, involving the meeting area, children's play area, hot spring area, gym, etc. The meeting area occupies a large area and is currently vacant, which is a pity.
In normal times, the price of the hotel is very moderate, and many people can stay in the villa area.
This time I chose a lake view room with one double bed and one 1.2 single bed, which is very suitable for a family of three. The design of the room arrangement is very reasonable, and the room also has direct drinking water. This kind of specification is rare in five-star luxury hotels, so I like it.

Two-person hot spring experience: It is a pity that there are only 4 types of health-care pools, and it is relatively early to enter, and some of them have just started changing water, cleaning, and cleaning. In this environment, it is recommended that the slate hot springs have iced cucumber slices on the face.

Breakfast: Breakfast is very rich.

I originally booked a room on the 1st and 2nd floors, so I probably couldn‚Äôt see Taihu Lake. When I checked in, I was told that there was a butler service in this room. The butler had already helped me change the room to the top floor of the 5th floor in advance. I can see both the Sheraton and the Taihu Lake, the scenery is really great. Seeing that we brought watermelon, we also specially sent a refrigerator, added the housekeeper‚Äôs WeChat account, and introduced in detail the various facilities of the hotel and the strategies for eating, drinking and having fun in the surrounding area. The experience is very good. Another surprise is that I was going to be disappointed with the hot spring, but there is a slate hot spring that no one pays attention to at all. You must go in and experience it to feel comfortable physically and mentally. After soaking in the hot springs, I wanted to go to Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf for a meal. The embarrassing thing was that when I was still choosing which one to go to, the time quietly passed 8 pm, and all these shops were closed. To eat, I can only go back to the hotel to eat iced watermelon.

When I checked in, I said that the room was full, but I didn't feel crowded for breakfast, hot springs, and swimming. The hotel staff, Xiao Chen, was very thoughtful and considerate. I asked a lot of questions, including sightseeing nearby, dining, and cruises on Taihu Lake, and I helped answer them one by one. The hotel is right next to Taihu Lake, and it only takes ten minutes to stroll along Taihu Lake to Fisherman's Wharf for dinner. Huzhou is really a relaxing city, green and livable, and I will come again in the future.

msg:First of all, give a thumbs up to Butler Lu, the service is very warm and caring, and the reply is fast and efficient! Booked Ningxiang Villa for one night. 4 key cards. Only two rooms need to plug in the room card for power supply.
There are three big bed rooms + a living room on the first floor. Two of the rooms are side by side with terraces and access to a private bath downstairs, but one room has no bathroom. Bathrobes and towels are provided in each room.
Ba*****t floor dining room + billiards + mahjong + a twin room + bathroom + outdoor private soup place. There is no bathroom in the twin room on the ba*****t floor.
The room facilities are really old, the shower floor drain is a bit clogged, and the shower head is not working very well, but the water is quite hot and relatively large.
If there is not enough mineral water, you can ask the waiter to deliver it. The fruit is welcome to be delivered at 4-5 o'clock.
Children's bathrobes, slippers and toothbrush and toothpaste can be requested.
It is very convenient to drive directly to the villa area. There are also shuttle buses that can call between the villa area and the lobby. The actual floor of the lobby is 2F (be careful when taking the elevator).
There is a Starbucks (partner) in the lobby, with few varieties, 29 lattes and 38 orange juices.
The breakfast is on the third floor. There are many varieties and the taste is good, but there is only one coffee machine and it's slow! Always in line.
There is a children's playground on the first floor, ocean ball + slide, which is relatively small.
It's a pity that the swimming pool is not open yet and I haven't experienced it.
There is a back door in the villa area leading to the embankment around the lake, and you can walk to Fisherman's Wharf for 15-20 minutes. The embankment around the lake is suitable for running and walking, and some people are flying kites.
Suggestion to the hotel: Is it possible to provide a bicycle rental service, because there are basically no shared bicycles, and there is no car along the way.
(The weather on the embankment around the lake is suitable for riding, which is very good)

After searching on Ctrip for a long time, I finally chose Narada Hot Spring Resort Hotel. It turns out that I have a good vision. Although there are many people on weekends, Butler Chen is still very considerate and considerate for us. Contact the hotel in advance the night before to inform you in detail about the places to eat, drink and have fun around the hotel. Because the departure time of the high-speed rail is a little late, we also specially arranged a late check-out for us, thank you very muchüòä
The location of the hotel is very good. When you open the balcony of the lake view room, you can see the water and sky of Taihu Lake. If there is no water vapor, you can still see the landmark toilet seat of Taihu Lake. Going out from the back door and walking for about ten minutes, you can go to Fisherman's Wharf to eat, take a walk and enjoy the scenery, which is very pleasant.
It is also very comfortable to come back to the hot spring after walking tired. That is, it would be better if a herbal medicine bag can be added to Lily Spring and Aiye Spring.
The breakfast is rich and complete. The room is clean and hygienic, even the umbrellas are prepared, very attentive.
Going out the back door of the hotel, there is also a tea room by the Taihu Lake where you can drink afternoon tea. While drinking tea, you can look at the scenery in a daze and listen to old songs. It is really good. It is suitable for petty bourgeoisie.

Service: Very good. As soon as we arrived at the entrance of the hotel, the porter enthusiastically directed the direction of the garage and took the initiative to take the luggage into the lobby

Environment: The environment of the hotel is also good, the lobby is spacious. There is tea at the front desk, and the price of Starbucks is also normal, I like it.
The room is large enough for an extra bed, the balcony is the lake view, there are 2 facing pools, and the bathtub is also very deep, it will be very comfortable if you want to take a bath. The breakfast is rich in varieties, combining Chinese and Western, and the aunt is diligent in closing.
The disadvantages are: not all the pools for hot springs are open, and so are the swimming pools. Moreover, the water in the hot springs is not clean, and there is a layer of dead skin floating on it. To be cleaned up.

msg:The small composition begins:
After my son finished the exam, the Yangkang duo went straight to Huzhou, and lived in a small hot spring house (with private soup)
Location: very very good. The hotel is on the edge of Taihu Lake. There is a small back door in the villa area. You can go directly to the viewing platform of Taihu Lake by swiping the room card. Turn left and walk for about 15 minutes to Moon Bay. It is quieter and more comfortable than living directly in Moon Bay, but it is also very convenient.
Hotel catering: check-in on Thursday and check-out on Saturday, did not meet the buffet dinner, cannot comment. Speaking of breakfast, it‚Äôs quite satisfactory. It can only be said to be of a medium level. There is no pancake, no waffle, and omelet is a bit hard to describe, but the small wontons and noodles are really good. In addition, the red noodle soup at the Chinese restaurant at noon is really good, and the quantity is super large. It's not just a bowl, it's like a tank. I really want to blow it up! The only disadvantage is that the time is relatively short, and there is no way to order food around 1:30, only noodles and wontons.
Service: The butler Xiaolu is considerate in service, responds quickly, and introduces in detail, five stars. The sister who drives the shuttle bus is also very good, every time she drives the shuttle bus out of the go-kart, hahaha... The sisters in the guest rooms in the villa area are also good at cleaning and serving private soup.
Room: The villa area is quite quiet, but the buildings are too close to each other, the bed is facing the window, without the curtains, the room can be seen clearly, and the privacy is very poor; if the curtains are drawn, it is too dark, it is a dilemma anyway. The glass roof of the yard has not been cleaned for a long time, and it is covered with leaves, which makes the whole yard very, very dark. I hope the hotel can clean it regularly. The bedding is also very average, and you can feel the springs when you sleep on it. The most satisfying thing about the room is the soup pool in the yard and the big bathtub in the room. I have really enjoyed soaking in the past two days. The soup pool is very good.
Others: The canteen in the hotel is too dark, a bowl of hot and sour noodles costs about 20 yuan, it is recommended to go to the canteen opposite to buy snacks
The children's area is suitable for young children, and it is relatively simple, just slides and ocean balls
I didn't go to the swimming pool and public soup because I was afraid of being caught by too many people, so I can't comment
I hope everyone has to help

Because I stayed in Huzhou on the 23rd and left on the 27th and returned to Huzhou, the itinerary code turned yellow. With the help of the hotel housekeeper Xiaolu, after communicating with the street and epidemic prevention personnel, we checked in. After dinner with our family by the Taihu Lake, we returned to the hotel and took a dip in the hot spring to relieve the fatigue of climbing the mountain. It was comfortable! It's a pity that I returned to the hotel after dinner at 21 o'clock and the hot springs ended at 22 o'clock. I will continue to choose Narada next time I bring friends to Huzhou, and finally praise the excellent butler Xiaolu again.

The three-bedroom villa is suitable for a family, with a private hot spring pool, a mahjong table, a restaurant kitchen, and a clean bathroom. The main building of the hotel has a swimming pool and a hot spring (there is also a children's water park in the hot spring) and the children had a great time. Parking is directly on the roadside of the villa area, which is very convenient. There is an iron gate next to the villa area. After swiping the room card, you can go out to the landscape avenue by the Taihu Lake.
In terms of service, Xiaolu, the housekeeper, added our WeChat one day in advance. Whether it was the introduction of the hotel‚Äôs facilities and policies or the dining of surrounding attractions, he responded in a timely manner. During the stay at the hotel, every time I called a courtesy car to pick up and drop off the main building, it was also very timely, so there was no need to wait. The other service staff are also very responsible. We checked in late on the first night. We thought we had missed the time to release the hot spring water, but an uncle took the initiative to help us release the water when it was almost ten o'clock. I like it üëçüèª
Staying for two nights, I planned to go to Taihu Ancient Town and Moon Bay, but in the end I didn't go anywhere, just stayed in the hotel to play, and will come again next time.

I booked a parent-child room. The two children are very comfortable to sleep. The children's supplies are well-equipped and the room layout is very good. My daughter likes the small tent the most.
The hotel's facilities are quite complete. Even if it rains outside, there are indoor and outdoor hot springs, gyms, children's playgrounds, and parent-child handicrafts for holiday stays.
The location of the hotel is good, the transportation is convenient, the price is high, and there is one-to-one butler service. Judy is very friendly, very kind, and provides help. The breakfast is until ten o'clock, and you can sleep late.

On the first day of check-in, the sewer was blocked, the hair dryer socket was broken, the bedside and the wardrobe were quite ash, and the mineral water in the room was drunk by others. After these problems were discovered, the front desk was called and no one answered until the next morning. I just got through and sent someone to repair it, but I didn't answer the questions about why the water in the room was drunk. I think it's quite unsafe.

In addition, the hotel breakfast is not like a five-star hotel, there is nothing to eat, the fruit is not fresh, except the aunt who cooks the noodles is pretty good, there is nothing else to remember.

The only advantage may be that the price is cheap in the hotel next to Taihu Lake, and the attitude of the front desk and cleaning aunt is good. It is suitable for a large family to come, couples and friends do not come. I would rather stay in a boutique hotel or a Sheraton.

1. The whole wall of the guest room is covered with moldy wallpaper. The living is very disgusting. The 700 room charge was given to a moldy room. The receptionist said that many of their rooms are moldy! ! !
2. The breakfast was very poor. The fried rice cake with crab was overnight, and it was taken out in the morning when the seafood buffet could not be finished the day before. Don't ask me how I eat it, I have eaten nian gao for many years.
3. Many Chinese dishes for breakfast are cold, but fried noodles and fried rice are all cold dishes?
4. The waiter is very active in receiving the dishes if it is not refilled in time, and the dishes are not refilled in time.
5. I came out and took a can of yogurt (the upright kind), and prepared to wait for it to digest and drink. The restaurant was crowded like a vegetable market, and the waiter at the door forced me to drink it on the spot. I have been to so many five-star It is said that Narada Lake Taihu is the first one to take a can of yogurt! ! ! Niubi! It's really awesome! !
6. There is a scenic spot ticket in the other package I bought. I gave it wrong. What museum did I give it directly? ? ? ?

So I booked Taihu Narada. I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel was just equipped Tesla charging pile, and it is slow charging, hotel residents can charge for free, which is so reassuring for me!
The hotel‚Äôs service is really good. Since the parking lot is a bit away from the lobby, I drove a battery car to take me to the lobby to check in. He also helped me carry my luggage into the room very intimately, and also gave me welcome fruits and milk for free.

1. The attitude of the hotel staff is very good, from the welcoming guests at the door to the service staff inside, especially Xiao Chen very enthusiastically telling me the surrounding situation.
2. For dining, there is a 198 set meal at noon. The Meituan shows that it is not available on holidays, but you can still buy it in the store if you ask it. For 2-3 people, I think it's ok. There are 108 buffets in the hotel at night, but I just have a meal. No, the noodles and wontons for breakfast are good
3. As a resort hotel, there are hot springs and hot spring tickets, but the family of three are not interested, and other entertainment facilities are still lacking. There is a mini pool table in the lobby. I did not expect this table to make my daughter playful.
4. In terms of traffic, there are no leisure and entertainment places that can be reached on foot. I originally thought that you could walk to the edge of Taihu Lake, but in general you still have to drive. This is not very convenient. Overall, it's okay.
My daughter said she wanted to live here when she came here in November

There are quite a lot of places to play nearby, such as wetlands and zoos.

Secondly, the facilities are slightly outdated. The small hot spring house I live in feels that the room facilities seem to be more than 5-6 years old.

Finally, the service, butler Manager Chen is very attentive, extra points! From private soup arrangements to nearby eating and drinking, everything is well prepared.
Finally, I would like to offer two suggestions to Narada. One is to improve the level of restaurant chefs, and the other is to improve the quality of room toiletries. The current toiletries do not meet the brand positioning of the resort.
