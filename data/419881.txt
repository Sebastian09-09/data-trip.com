msg:Great location near the central Xiamen island, within walking distance from Yundang lake. Taxi from the airport takes less than 30 minutes (50 yuan). Metro Line 1 to Xiamen North Railway Station is also close. 

The lobby is on the 7th floor, which can be a little confusing because you need to go there on your own first. The staff doesn't speak English very well, but enough to manage. They were very polite and courteous.
The rooms were very clean and quite spacious, over 40 sqm. A toilet brush was missing (in my room). The city view is nice since all rooms are  above the lobby (floor 7). 

Breakfast was good, mainly Chinese, with some other options, though the eggs were very salty so I couldn't enjoy them.

Although it was a small matter, it saved us the trouble of calling the front desk. Also, when we put the clothes into the washing machine, it was already late. The front desk staff asked us to go to sleep and come back the next morning to pick them up. She would keep an eye on it for us. This kind of service is better than some five-star hotels. The management of Hongdu is quite good.

msg:The room area is relatively large. The hotel we booked for our self-driving trip was listed as five-star on the platform, but the actual conditions and environment are still quite different from the five-star hotel. First, drive into the hotel (there is a clear parking space requirement when booking the hotel), and the ground floor The parking spaces were all full. I entered the basement on the first floor. I communicated with the security guard that guests staying in the hotel were not allowed to park on the first floor. They were allowed to move to the second floor. I took two elevators from the second floor to find the first floor and asked the security guard where the lobby was. On the seventh floor, there was no sign outside the elevator: a short video was played loudly in the breakfast room without any supervision by the service staff while someone was dining; the TV signal was not good, and even the staff could not solve it. The location of the hotel is still very good and it is relatively close to various attractions. The hotel cannot provide dinner.

It is very convenient to enter and exit next to the road. It is very important for me to travel by car. There is free beer, Coke, Sprite, etc. in the small refrigerator in the room every day. The cleaning lady is also very kind. The front desk will proactively ask when cleaning is more convenient. I originally planned to stay for one day to check out the situation, but I personally experienced the hotel's high-quality proactive service, neat and clean environment, and spacious and bright rooms, so I stayed for three days in a row. I was very satisfied. It is a high-quality hotel that is highly recommended!

The location is good, the transportation is convenient, the surrounding dining facilities are no problem, and there are above-ground and underground parking lots. The front desk, which was originally located on the first floor, was moved upstairs for check-in. After all, the hotel industry in Xiamen is highly competitive, probably to increase revenue and reduce expenditure.

msg:The hotel I booked a month in advance refused to give me a room upgrade... When I arrived at the hotel at 12 o'clock in the evening, the front desk took off his shoes and was talking on the sofa. After looking for a long time, I didn't know where the person was. Maybe he was the owner of the hotel. ? He was not wearing work clothes and his attitude was rather cold. Hygiene is okay, no merit or demerit. The most important thing is that I slept right after 9 o'clock in the morning. Suddenly, there was a constant noise of renovation upstairs. Is it strange that the decoration does not check whether there are any residents downstairs? I called to inform them of the situation, but after 15 minutes there was no result, and I urged them again to stop. Then I changed to another place farther away and continued to thump, but there was still a sound, so I am too lazy to talk about it...to get up and check out. The hotel has no representation or compensation for this. I can only say that this is the hotel with the worst experience I have ever stayed in Xiamen. This bad review is well deserved. If you want to live, you can refer to it more. If you are willing to spend nearly 600 to buy a hotel without any service, then you are very wrong~

One last thing, the hotel has urgent matters, and the only way to contact the tenants is to call the room. Passengers who choose this hotel can pay more attention, only in the room can they receive hotel news, and the mobile phone number is only used for check-in.
