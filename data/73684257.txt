There were bugs all over my child and the bed opposite. I didn't sleep well all night. Later, my child was also woken up by itchiness. The main reason was that I spent more than 100 yuan to upgrade the room! The experience was too bad!

It is suitable for a three-day and two-night trip with a baby for two days and one night. The hotel is magnificently decorated, and the five flamingos in the lobby are also very attractive. Features: The room we originally booked suddenly felt noisy after 22:00 in the evening. We encountered unqualified tenants playing cards next door. We quickly went to complain to the front desk. The account manager actively resolved the problem and had a very good attitude. He adjusted us to a room on the top floor to ensure There was no one staying in the hotel, and the breakfast was rich in variety. The only regret was that there was only freshly brewed American coffee and no coffee machine. I hope to add a coffee machine. There are Animal Science Kingdom and Desert Adventure Kingdom suitable for children in the hotel park. The experience is very good. In short, it is worth recommending. I will visit again in the future.

There are some small shops about ten minutes' drive away. There is a free children's playground in the hotel. It is relatively small and has many children. There are two interactive activities every day. It is suitable for children over four or five years old. Those who are too young cannot express themselves. Child care is okay, but the baby must be accompanied. The surrounding Animal Science Kingdom is suitable for older children. For younger children, go to the zoo. There are many kinds of animals. You can feed them for half a day with some steamed buns and vegetable leaves. There are actually pandas and brown bears. There is also a non-powered play area where babies can play for a while.
Overall it's OK, suitable for walking the kids, and you can stay there for two days on the weekend, but it's just not convenient for dining.

4 The sound insulation of the hotel is very poor. From 11:30 to 12 o'clock in the middle of the night, when the bed upstairs was moved, the children next door cried and the adults made a fuss. It was very noisy!
5 The breakfast was quite poor. There were people queuing up everywhere and there was no coffee machine!
6 The desert kingdom outside the hotel is quite fun, and the children had a great time playing there!
In short, I suggest that people in Tianjin don’t stay in hotels and just go home for fun!

msg:I can’t complain, because it’s all tears. First of all, I stayed in a family suite on the fourth day of the ***** New Year. The room fee was 1,200. I lived on the second floor. The room was extremely hot. Finally, I was told that I couldn’t stay with the door open. The air conditioner in the room had no cold air. It's 30 degrees inside. Secondly, the window can only be opened a small crack, and it is above the flamingos. These women are so noisy that they scream loudly for a while, so I can't sleep all night. It was overcrowded. As a parent-child hotel, there were no bedside stalls. The response capacity was seriously insufficient. I asked for a paper bag. Secondly, at breakfast, there were so many people that there were no seats. It took half an hour to find a table for dinner, and we had to close it at 10 o'clock on time. The food was miserable, the millet porridge was mixed with water, the bread was ordinary bread cut into 4 pieces, there were no children's cutlery, the cups were disposable, and the breakfast environment was dirty and messy. The naughty castle is 20 square meters, 100 children, and everyone is stepping on everyone. There were so many people fighting in line at the entrance to the dinner buffet that there was no time to check tickets. As soon as everyone opened and rushed in, there were people and children everywhere. They are all described as terrifying. Besides, the room was dirty. I didn't have time to clean it, so I went to the bed. There were hair and dust everywhere, the toothbrush cup was full of toothpaste, and the toilet paper was half used. Checked in at 5 o'clock, just one night, and decided to check out the next day. There was nothing for the children to eat for breakfast, and they were all queuing up. The service quality is too poor, the hygiene is also worrying, the room is not breathable, the check-in at the front desk is very casual, it can be completed in one minute, and the activities are not introduced, and I ask questions proactively. I was really impressed by such an expensive room price. I wanted to check out that night, refund my money and leave quickly. If you don't have the ability, don't be a family hotel. If you can't accommodate so many people, you have to control it. It's a one-time deal. I don’t know who gets the good reviews from anyone.

Even if I happened to book a group tour here for an unknown company, I still don’t understand why I came here for a meeting without children. Noisy.
The children's play facilities in the hotel are quite interesting.
Animal Science Kingdom: There are many animals, and I finally found my beloved Capibala. I bought vegetables at the door and fed them, and the macaws ate peanuts. You can feed the parrots by dragging them with the lid of the provided lunch box. It is interesting to watch the parrots eat peanuts. There are many other small raccoons, monkeys, kangaroos, alpacas, rabbits, and many other cute animals. It just closes relatively early, so we have to go out at 17:30.
The outdoor desert adventure kingdom is also very good. If it wasn't winter, I would have been able to play for a long time.
I feel like I will come back to this hotel because of the warm weather and light show. I hope the quality will get better and better.

I booked a room with bunk beds because of my two children. The children were very happy, but the quilt was a bit hot. They always woke up from the heat at night and didn't sleep well. I ordered a meal from the hotel in the evening. Although it was not cheap, I have to mention that the amount of pasta was really large, enough for two children and one adult, and it tasted good. There are not many types of breakfast in the hotel, but it is enough for children. You can see flamingos while eating in the restaurant.
The overall stay experience is quite satisfactory, but I have to mention that the hygiene of the room needs to be improved. The carpet is very dirty and the floor has not been cleaned very clean. There are snacks and garbage left by previous guests in the corners of the curtains, and there are two pillows. There was blood on it. I talked to the front desk when I checked out, and the lady at the front desk said she would report it to the hotel and gave me two small pendants.
Because it is winter, there is not much to do around. The Animal Kingdom is behind the hotel, so you have to go around. The place is not big and it takes about ten minutes to complete the tour.

Even if you find a seat, there are no chairs and other people have moved it to put clothes and bags. There are obviously not enough service and management staff. There is always a shortage of plates, cutlery and cups, and you have to use a bowl to make a drink. As for flamingos, it depends on luck. You can only see them occasionally.

❤The deluxe double room ordered by Ctrip is 32 square meters and costs over 500, including two breakfasts, and I used Ctrip points to redeem the welcome fruit, which is a great value. The two rooms we booked are next to each other. They are both viewing rooms. We can directly see the Animal Science Kingdom and the Desert Kingdom. The view is quite good. The only regret is that there is no bathtub, so I can’t take a bath for Meimei.
❤The morning meal time is from 7 to 10 o'clock. We are still at the flamingo restaurant. You can watch the flamingos while dining. There are not too many varieties of breakfast, there are only two kinds of bread, which can be paired with chocolate milk. The ramen and wontons tasted good. I unexpectedly found the ice cream🍨 that I thought would only be served at dinner, but I was shown off a big bowl of it.

Service: I met a Guizhou girl in the lobby. The person who painted the face was from Guizhou. I was very happy. She said she was a performer. She was a very cute girl.

There is no coffee machine, the coffee is placed in an electric kettle and guests need to heat it themselves. It tastes terrible, no coffee taste at all. I feel that there is a lot of room for optimization in the hotel's software and management. For example, when it comes to coffee, a coffee machine can completely solve the problem. I hope there will be some changes and I will come back to experience it again in the future.

Tickets for 2 Big and 1 Little Kingdom Feast of Lights Festival: It’s good to go and play after dinner. It’s just outside the hotel and has a walk around. There are no power facilities. Children like it and have a lot of fun. The performance started from 8:15 to 8:30. It was very happy and the a**osphere was good. There are not many people during the main National Day holiday, so it is not crowded when playing, which is better.

Self-driving is very convenient, parking spaces are sufficient, and charging at charging stations is relatively expensive. The breakfast variety is okay, the taste is average, and it can fill you up.

The room is quite big enough for the children to play. The bed is very soft and comfortable. The children especially like to lie on it.
Maybe we live on the sixth floor, so the bath water will be cold for a while, which won't affect the bathing very much.
You can see flamingos in the lobby and there is a small naughty castle in the lobby. A two-year-old baby is enough to play with. Special praise is given to the two teachers of the custody service. Our package includes craft coupons, but we are too young to do the crafts for the two teachers. He said you can play there for a while and there are so many toys. We played there for an hour and didn’t want to leave.
The restaurant is not a buffet on weekdays. The set menu is delicious and the price is right.
Animal Science Kingdom is a bit tricky, but Desert Adventure Kingdom is still suitable for older children.
All in all, the hotel experience is very good. The staff in the lobby, Starbucks and restaurants are very welcoming.
If I have another chance, I will stay there for two days on a weekend to experience other activities.

In terms of facilities, the baby is given a toothbrush and a paper cup is recommended. Since it is a family hotel, it should be equipped with a baby toilet. There is no rubber ***** under the shower room in the bathroom, and water leaks outside while washing.

Service: After one o'clock in the afternoon, the baby just fell asleep, so we called to tell him that the hot water would be turned off from 2 to 4 o'clock; after 4 o'clock, the waiter knocked on the door again and gave us welcome fruits. When we were still confused about the situation, the waiter directly pushed us away. After entering the door, I put the fruit at the entrance. Although there was no privacy prying into, it felt very bad. Overall, I was not very satisfied with the hotel.

Supporting facilities: Desert Kingdom is particularly suitable for children to have fun. It also has fun interactions, clown performances, light shows, water curtain animation short films, and the night scenery inside is also beautiful.

Club hosting: 38 for one hour, all kinds of toys, and we also caught up with the organized mini-games and gave small gifts to the baby. It was the first time that the baby won a toy through his own efforts, which was very memorable.

There is also a small naughty castle and a mini cinema. All the staff in the hotel have a strong sense of service and have a very good attitude.

I ate the breakfast buffet, super burger lunch, and seafood buffet dinner. Overall, I felt the quality was good, but the variety was too limited. Especially the dinner, the quality was okay, but not worth it...

Disadvantages: The staff at the entrance of the hotel restaurant "know people" and provide different services.
We don't know how to sort the waiters into three, six or nine. Before the meal starts, when we line up at the door of the restaurant, we can feel that different people have different services. For example: some people need to queue up to check meal coupon codes, redeem menus, and dine in.
Some people directly took photos with the mobile phones of the "foreman" at the entrance of the hotel restaurant, and then the staff verified the coupon code themselves. Guests could get the menu directly from the "foreperson" and enter to dine.
If we want to provide convenience to the elderly, the young, and people with limited mobility, we can understand it, but it’s not obvious.

I went to the zoo and the Animal Kingdom talked about fireflies. The children are a little too young to understand, but they are still very excited to see fireflies. The room It is clean and tidy, with a separate washbasin for children, which is very in line with the positioning of a parent-child hotel! It's very good to bring children

msg:The parent-child double bed room booked from Ctrip is a room with a double bed + bunk beds. After completing the formalities, I found that there was only one double bed in the room. I have two children. This is definitely not enough. When changing rooms, the front desk staff The service attitude is very good. They said that they received the order and arranged to give them a double bed room, so I made a mistake and admitted that it was their mistake in the handover. Then we can only wait, and the wait is almost an hour! Speechless 😓 When I checked in, I asked the front desk how much breakfast was charged for children. My child was 1 meter long, and the other child was more than 1 meter 2. The taller child was charged. The front desk told me that my room included two big ones and one small one. For breakfast, one child is a child from 1.2 meters to 1.4 meters! One-meter children don’t need money, but I took the children to have breakfast in the morning. After telling the room number, I was told that there were only two adults, and my older child would be charged! I took my children to measure their height, and I explained to them what was going on. The restaurant staff was rude and even asked me to talk and record it. What kind of hotel is this? It has such an attitude towards guests! The answer given to me later was that no one handed them over! The good mood is affected early in the morning! After breakfast, I packed up and went to check out. At that time, I paid a deposit of 300 when I checked in, but when I checked out, I said that it would take half an hour to refund the account. I just wanted to ask, how can I check this house carefully? It takes half an hour time! If I leave and you don't refund the money or refund less money, it's not all you have the final say on! I have stayed in so many hotels, either the room inspection is exempted, or the deposit is not required! Or refund the deposit directly. This is the first time I saw this hotel. Seeing me like this, the front desk refunded the deposit directly! I seldom write reviews, but this time I was really annoyed. Because I have children, I usually look for parent-child hotels with a good environment. The environment of this hotel is really good, and most of the service staff are very good, but the location is relatively remote, so I drove there The surrounding area is under construction. There are people playing with the children in the hotel. The movies are played on a loop throughout the day, and the naughty castle where the children play. The overall feeling is good, except for these three strange things that make me unhappy. Such a big hotel, handover If you make two mistakes, the business really needs to be improved!

The impressive thing is that the flamingos accompany you to eat, and you can see the beautiful scenery in the lobby. In addition, there are performances in the hotel during the meal. They are very attentive, and children can go up for parent-child interaction. However, the hotel is established Will it be rainy soon? There are not many people, overall it is clean, parent-child, there are relatively few people, and the places to play around the Kingdom of Science are relatively close, very good👌

My children found it noisy, and the speakers were really loud, so they had to shout to talk. But the waiter was very nice, he kept apologizing to us, and even gave us gifts. 2 small toys for kids. The taste is pretty good for a hotel buffet, no merit or demerit. Animal Science Kingdom and Desert Kingdom are very fun, much better than the zoo in Photosynthetic Valley, and a good place to bring children. In addition, the naughty castle in the hotel is not big, and the children lost interest after playing for a while. Overall, the children had a lot of fun, and the children were happy and the adults were happy too ~ it is worth a visit

The buffet breakfast was rich and exceeded expectations.
Children like the free naughty castle, and the feet are not dirty after playing barefoot for two hours, which proves that the hygiene is not bad.
The custody service is free for in-house guests for these two days. Children under the age of three are allowed to be accompanied by a parent. My child is almost three and a half years old, so I went in by myself and had a great time with the elder sister who is in custody.

For example, when she asked when the King's Feast light show would end at night, she said she didn't know (the reason was that it was not a hotel event, but many children would go there, and it was so close. It’s better to find out.) For another example, when I checked in, I asked when the children’s activities organized by the lobby would be held, but I didn’t know. These should be things the front desk should know. Also, there is no air conditioning in the room at this time. Although it is a bit cool at night, it is actually quite hot in the room during the day, especially in the sunny room. If there is no air conditioning, this should be explained or marked in advance.

The hygiene is poor. The wall next to the bed is covered in dirt.
The one on the top of the bath towel is also made of dirt and cannot be used.
Fortunately, I arrived early and there are rooms available for early check-in.
The desert kingdom is okay, but it's in the Animal Science Kingdom. It's particularly inappropriate. You have to buy a ticket if you want to go in the next day.

The table of the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room can sit or lie down, and the baby crawls there to bask in the sun. There are performances at the buffet in the evening, and the buffet is also good. The crayfish is free, and the salmon is relatively fresh, and the price of 258 is not bad. In the morning and evening, there are interactive performances with my baby in the hotel lobby. My baby likes the small movie theater. Originally, the movie theater is closed until 10 pm. My baby wants to watch this movie until 11 o'clock. In the end, we are the only ones left, and there is no staff. Drive us away, the service is really good. A young lady who looks like the manager of the lobby met us by chance in the elevator. Hearing about the baby's birthday, she specially gave us a flamingo doll, which is very considerate. It is also very close to Science Kingdom and Unpowered Paradise. It's just that the surrounding environment is not very good. I feel that the Guanghe Valley area is being renovated, and there are cars parked randomly near the hotel.

msg:My baby is 5 and a half years old. I brought my baby to Tianjin this time. Flamingo is the main destination. I originally booked for two nights. Later, because of a problem with the car, I had to run several times for 4 seconds, so I changed the itinerary to one night. Fortunately, I changed the itinerary. , a bit disappointed with the hotel

Hygiene: very clean
Environment: From the appearance to the interior decoration, the furnishings are not bad. General environment around the hotel
Service: Except for the on-duty manager who is more polite, other staff are not so good. In addition, the food and drink are poor. I ate a set meal on the first day. There are two kinds of 58 and 88. I chose the 58 honey sauce chicken rice set. The set meal is the main dish, dessert, fruit, and... mustard... and... salted duck eggs... When I placed the order, I said that there was black chicken soup, but I forgot about it, and I remembered it the next day... The breakfast is so-so, and the variety of dishes is not too small, but it is not rich. We checked in on a weekday. Fortunately, there was a training meeting at the same time, otherwise the breakfast might not be good. In addition, what to eat for dinner every day, whether it is a buffet or a set meal, is not certain, it depends on luck.
Facilities: Let me talk about the worst thing first. The shower is hot and cold. Adjust it to a suitable temperature. Assuming it is 40°C, the water temperature will fluctuate according to the curve of 40-0-60-40-0-60... 60 is my nonsense Yes, it is very hot, you must avoid that. The reply from the front desk was interesting. First, it said that there were too many people staying in (is it reasonable?), and then I asked someone to take a look, and the reply said that it would be okay tomorrow? I said no, so I arranged for the master to come and see. The master came and said that there were too many people, and the temperature was not suitable. Let me adjust it myself. This is the case in every room... Anyway, I didn’t wash the children in the end... Let alone a parent-child hotel that costs 700+ on weekdays, stay in a 300+ hotel on a weekend Are there any bugs in chain hotels where hot water cannot be supplied when they are full? Isn't this a basic need for staying in a hotel?
    There are also some other minor problems, which are not hurtful, but to be honest, they are not parent-child. For example, there is no footstool, children cannot reach the faucet, there is no small toilet seat, the voice-activated light in the bathroom cannot be turned off, and the glass between the bathroom and the bed is not light-proof.
    In addition, I don’t know how other parents are. I book a parent-child hotel mainly for entertainment. If you stay for one night, you can go crazy for a day before calling it a parent-child hotel, right? How can I not live if I only stay for one night (not to mention that I can't even take a bath)? The naughty castle in this hotel is very small, suitable for 5 children, 10 crowded spots is the upper limit, and it is opened in different time periods. The next day I wanted to play but failed, so I went to the shopping malls in the city. There is no swimming pool. The Children's Club is also opened in different time slots. If you check in late on the first day, the time is not suitable for the second day, but you can't play. Movie theaters are available all day long, but you can’t protect your eyesight for too long.
    The Guanghe Valley around the hotel is very poor. There is nothing to play, just rush here and forget it~
    It’s a parent-child hotel, I don’t have anything to do, it’s not fun next to it, and it’s far away from the city... In 21 years, I went to a certain university in Dongli Lake next to me, and I stayed at the hotel. I didn’t go anywhere, not for three days and two nights. What do you think, the naughty castle is big enough, there are hot springs and paddling pools, this is called a parent-child hotel. It's not an adverti*****t, I don't even know what's going on there now, it's not yellow. I just feel that this hotel is really not very parent-child.

Sister Moyi not only helped me upgrade the hotel room, but also gave the baby a cute flamingo doll, which gave us a perfect start. In the evening, the children's activities arranged by the hotel are also very lively, and the teachers in the hotel are very friendly. Next time I have a chance, I will stay here again, and I will recommend it to my friends.

msg:The hotel is very new, and you can see all kinds of flamingo influences everywhere, big screens, cartoon dolls, real flamingos, etc.
Qin Shimingyue, who was booked, went to the store and changed to the room of the small submarine column. There is a long seat (with a soft bag) by the window, but there is a seam between the window and the baby, so be careful. There are three big dolls in the room, there is also a small tent, there is Xiaomi's little love classmate beside the bed who can sing and so on
The only downside is that I didn't see baby slippers, and there are many hotels in common: the toilet light is sensory, we are very helpless about this because we are afraid that the baby will wake up
There are also many activities in the hotel, including children's custody services; there is also a small naughty castle (ocean balls are a bit rare), and there are game facilities such as VR at their own expense; there is also Piggy Page in the small cinema at night; on weekends at 8:30 There are resident singers, and at nine o'clock, there are staff who lead children to dance and throw handkerchiefs together
No noodles and hot milk for breakfast, the restaurant is next to flamingos
It is said on the Internet that bears are good, but I didn’t feel it last time, but I think flamingos are good, and there are more activities for children

After checking in, the manager on duty led us to the room, and the waiter used a luggage cart to help carry the luggage. The flamingos are well kept and are a feature. The children had a great time in the naughty castle, and this small circular theater is really great, because I have never taken my children to the theater, and I am afraid that he will affect others. I just tried it this time, and the effect is not bad. There is no running around, and it can be quiet watch for a while. The buffet in the hotel surprised me. I thought it would be expensive and the quality was average, but unexpectedly the quality was very good, with fresh ingredients and a lot of variety. My husband and I enjoyed eating sashimi 😁 My son also Eat a lot of favorite things, there are magic and juggling shows during the meal time. I don't feel like going out to play, and I won't be bored just staying in the hotel. When checking out, my son was unhappy and said he didn't want to leave, so he had to agree to come back next time.

Other vr and game consoles have to be charged separately, and they can’t play for babies of a few years old.

Very friendly to children and all activities are on the first floor. There is a mini movie hall, which plays animated movies in a loop (the movies may be more attractive to older children.) There is also a small naughty castle (hope it can be made bigger later). There is also a small activity room, there should be staff who can see children aged 3-6.

Tickets for Double Photosynthetic Valley Park Zoo: no tickets now
Animal Science Kingdom 2 large and 1 small: The hotel is next to the Animal Kingdom, which is very interesting although it is not big and there are not many animal species. There is a puppy show. If you buy tickets to the Animal Kingdom, you can play the unpowered outdoor facilities next to it. It is a large area, and children can play for half a day.
Happy Afternoon Tea for Two: The complimentary afternoon tea is mediocre, and a very small cake is not tasty, too sweet. drink coffee is ok

Let me talk about the areas that I hope to improve: there are several claw machines in the hotel lobby, and the dolls inside have nothing to do with the small animals in the hotel theme. I hope that the plush toys in the hotel can be replaced with the ones displayed in the hotel. I believe there will be More children to catch.

The children play for half a day, and then go to the hotel to check in. You can go in before two o'clock! We booked a parent-child double room, so there is no bathtub, and the toilet space is ok. It is quite large. We came in the middle of the week. The hotel’s entertainment items and buffet are not available. They are all set meals. There is a free naughty castle, which is not big, and VR game consoles There is a fee, the flamingo is alive, I didn't watch it in the cinema, the overall is good

msg:The normal price of a parent-child double room is that there is a wall outside the window. This kind of room is allocated to tenants. After several negotiations, there is no compensation. They only say that they will mark the room type next time. (After check-in, the front desk asked us to go to the side to participate in the activities, followed by dinner, and we didn't find it at night when we went back)

The free Guanghegu ticket marked in the Ctrip package is originally free, and the flamingos in the lobby and movie viewing are originally free. Ctrip's package includes the above items, which is misleading.

In addition, the hot water was extremely cold. After waiting for a long time, it was almost as cold as body temperature, and I froze to death.

The only bright spot is that the brothers and sisters in the event are very kind. The young lady in the picture has been playing with the children for a long time. She is very kind and parents don't worry.

No restaurants, no supermarkets, no kiosks! Really nothing! Then there is only one restaurant in the hotel, and it doesn't open until six in the evening! And you can only eat buffet, no zero points! 158 people, not to mention the taste, just try to eat it! What's particularly funny is that at around 7:30, two staff members in black uniforms, a man and a woman, sat directly at the next table next to us and started eating. They ordered duck soup! Furthermore, there are self-service machines, but only drinks! Not even an instant noodle! And there is nothing in the room! ! !
In addition, we checked in at 16:00 on Thursday, the front desk clerk was always frowning, and there was no question like hello, and the concierge next to him helped answer any questions!
The lobby is very big, there is only one broken ocean ball in the play area, and the rest are a few VR sets, Xiaobao can't play at all, the only thing I can boast is the fee club, 38 an hour, there are staff hosting it!
Besides, in the house, the location and cleanliness of the Fei Xia parent-child room are really speechless!
A few hundred dollars is only for buying an experience, if you spend a few hundred dollars, you will really be discouraged!
Either put four flamingos or a themed hotel, if you want to learn, learn more!

The hotel and Ctrip fully cooperated and provided a lot of heart-warming help. Let’s talk about the check-in experience. It’s super awesome👍We are three adults I brought a child with me. It is very spacious and well-equipped. The only regret is that I can't stay for one more night. I didn't have time to watch the surrounding scenic spots. I look forward to the next stay experience.

msg:Because of the current epidemic, I don’t dare to travel across provinces and cities. It happened to be in the golden period of pregnancy, so I did a lot of travel strategies, and finally decided to go to Jinghai Guanghe Valley Tourist Resort. After looking at the nearby hotels, I found this hot The bird-themed parent-child hotel is very good. Anyway, after giving birth to a baby, we will take him everywhere to play. We tried to explore a store in advance, and we did not expect it to be better than expected.
The attitude of the hotel staff is very good. The most impressive thing is the young lady with pink and black hair like flamingos. Every time I see you, I greet you very warmly, and the singing is very good. There is also a handsome welcome brother at the door and the front desk. There is a lady who speaks very softly.
In order not to catch too many people on weekends, we checked in on Thursday and checked out on Saturday. We stayed for two nights in total. We ate two buffet breakfasts, and both lunches were brought in room 499. We also gave welcome fruits on the first day. I gave milk the next day, so I don't have to worry about eating and drinking. I usually go out to play in the afternoon, go back to the hotel after dinner, ask for a cup of coffee and juice in the lobby, and play billiards for one hour for free.
The hotel is very close to the Guanghe Valley Zoo. I have called and consulted before. As long as there is a large nucleic acid screening in the city, you can directly make an appoin**ent to enter the park. Now there is no need for tickets. It happens that there are not many people on weekdays. We strolled in the past, but unfortunately it was too hot these two days. We all drove ourselves to play with water. When we were tired, we went back to the hotel to rest. Sometimes we would watch two episodes of Peppa Pig in the first floor theater interesting.
Generally speaking, I like this hotel very much. There seems to be a parent-child room on the second floor. I hope that we can bring our baby back to experience together in two years.😁

First of all, the package launched by the hotel and Ctrip is very good value.
Secondly, the hospitality of the hotel staff, especially the beautiful lady Moyi in the front hall, is outstanding. Seeing that we are traveling with a baby and this is the first time we come to play, he warmly introduces the baby in and around the hotel for us. The place is very professional and reliable, thank her again.
Again, the hotel rooms are very comfortable, the hotel atrium has a large flamingo area, and it is 360 degrees, whether in the lobby or the restaurant, you can watch flamingos at any time. The hotel also has a naughty castle, a mini theater (with good sound effects), a leisure area in the lobby, billiards, cold drinks, etc. The cafeteria of the hotel is very large, and it will not be crowded with many people.
Finally, there is Photosynthesis Valley around the hotel, which is very close and suitable for family vacations.

I have stayed in so many hotels, and this is the first time that I can check in after 2 o'clock, but I can't check in until 4:30! What kind of reception capacity is this! During the process, the front desk staff didn't show any expressions, and they were all in an evasive state when dealing with the guests' doubts. They didn't dare to look at the guests, and they couldn't even say the most basic polite words. What kind of professional quality is this! After staying for a day, the overall feeling is that it has everything on the surface, as if it has everything, but in fact everything is so awkward, and there is nothing in the inner feeling! There is still a big gap from parent-child hotels!

There were hairs in the bed sheets and quilts of the children's bunk beds. I seriously doubt that the sheets were changed! The sheets on the top bunk are very wrinkled! The carpet on the big bed was also super dirty! Not to mention cleaning every corner! There are bugs and there is hair!

msg:The decoration of the hotel is quite upscale. The facilities are perfect and clean, the room is clean and tidy. Overall satisfied. Although the hotel mainly focuses on parents and children, there is not much for children to play. The naughty castle is very small, there is a small movie hall, and then there is a place to take care of children. There are some games in it. We have seen 7 flamingos, but they can be seen from a distance when they are closed. The surrounding facilities are not perfect, and there is very little to play. There is an animal kingdom that charges 78 a person. Then the Photosynthetic Valley Zoo can basically play for a morning or an afternoon. Opening hours 9:00-17:00. We think the breakfast at the hotel is very good. There is no other thing that says that it is not easy to queue up. Maybe we went on a working day. The lunch is an ordinary buffet. The lunch is a bit simple, but it can still be full. Don't think about it after eating well. I had to check out and leave. The only thing I feel dissatisfied with is that we booked two rooms, one of which was temporarily added, so it was booked on the same day. Then we arrived at the hotel after 3 o'clock, but we stayed in another room after 5 o'clock. The front desk said 15 minutes at first, but after several reminders, they said they would wait for a while. Although it has been helping to coordinate, but the efficiency is real. . . There is also the feeling that the front desk is indeed a bit unprofessional, and it feels unnecessary to explain that there is no room to say a lot of irrelevant things that I don't understand. And I said that the reservation was a little late, and the front desk said that the reservation was too late, so other hotels will not allow reservations on the same day? I have never encountered Zuojiao for two hours~ Anyway, the temporary coordination ability is too poor. But at least it doesn't matter if you get a floor. There are also constructions in the surrounding area. I don't know if it is necessary to enrich the facilities. It is recommended to check in early, then take the children to play in the hotel, and then go to the Guanghe Valley Zoo the next day to check out directly after playing. One night is enough.

It’s a nonsense, the hotel is very remote, there is nothing to do in winter, I drove to Wanda, more than 20 kilometers away, to play, I was still hesitating whether to choose bears or flamingos, I thought I had been to bears several times, so I tried Try the flamingos that have never been here before, but they stepped on the pit. The parent-child hotel did not prepare baby slippers, but they were delivered quickly after calling. There is no refrigerator, and the temperature of the hot water is not high. It was the first time I took a shower in the hotel and I was shivering from the cold. The bed was not bad and very comfortable. The breakfast style is average. Although it is not expensive, it is still inferior to other restaurants with the same price. The waiters in the restaurant are very enthusiastic and help to solve problems in a timely manner. There is a Guanghe Valley next to it, and there are parks and zoos. It should be good in spring, summer and autumn, and it is too cold in winter. Cold, the hotel should not worry about it anymore, but I have never been to Guanghegu, and I may come again. In addition, I will not trust Ctrip too much.

When I get up at night and go to the bathroom, the light in the bathroom cannot be turned off. I have tried every switch and card, and the various customer service calls inside the hotel cannot be reached. As a person who has trouble falling asleep, I woke up at 3 o'clock and never fell asleep again. It was too painful. It was speechless that the light recovered by itself in the morning...

There are only eight birds than I imagined. The playground next to the children is actually a small rest area. My husband said that the children’s theater is just watching TV. Such a big hotel should be equipped with a swimming pool. The overall hygiene is still very satisfactory and clean. It is also a good choice to come and stay when you are tired of playing.

Older children should not be interested. There is a room where you can play with toys. If the weather is bad and you can't go to the zoo, there's almost nothing to do. The service staff is very good, and it's just the facilities... The baby cot was delivered, I don't know who dares to sleep , If it hadn't been found too late, I really didn't want to do this. In short, my baby played a little as an experience, and it also gave us experience to accumulate experience, and we would persuade friends if we won't come again.

msg:[Five flamingos dare to call the theme hotel, the wall is cracked🚫NO not recommended]
【🦩5 flamingos】❌I thought the flamingos were resting when I arrived in the evening. I carefully observed them in the morning, and it turned out that there were really only 5 flamingos. You may not be able to find them unless you look carefully.
[🈂️500 per capita consumption] ❌ 600 for accommodation and 600 for food, I dare not consume anything else. If you don’t consume it, you will feel sorry for the child. It just feels so disgusting to set a fee.
[Room 370]❌It is a building that has nothing to do with the main building. You have to live there. Sorry, there is no ba*****t. You need to go there by yourself, and there is no such thing as lobby entertainment equipment. The room is particularly small and smells bigger. If you want to spend less money, then sorry there is no package. As a parent, what can you do, you can only pay to live in this hall and you will see 5 flamingos in a room that is twice as expensive.
[There is nothing around] ❌ It is impossible for you to dream of taking out food within a 5-kilometer radius of the surrounding area, so it is impossible for the buffet to sell for 298.
[Too much odor] ❌I have booked three rooms in total, and the smell of each room gave me a headache. If the surrounding area is not 14 kilometers away to find a better hotel, I will definitely check out that night. After all, I bring children to play, and adults don't care. Poor my daughter coughed for a whole day.
[Meal 298 yuan/person] ❌Only ¥298 for self-service, I can't describe how tattered the food is. The lobster is prepared by the chef and placed in a greasy box. You have to put it in the oven for you. Heat it up. The lamb chops are all fried, you have to heat it up for you. Juices are watered. I can only cook some vegetables and noodles for my daughter, and eat the rest. I am really afraid of diarrhea.
【Amu*****t Facilities】❌You need to pay for painting, and you need to pay for kneading clay figures. Basically, you need to pay for anything you think you can. For free, only the small slide in the lobby, and the movie theater that plays Peppa's animation in turn!
[Indiscriminate Charges] ❌ All the things in the room are charged, and there is still a conscience to provide free toothbrushes and two bottles of water, not to mention the ones in the lobby.
[Sincerely speaking] ❌ I came here basically for the sake of children, but I really regret it. The fee can be a little more expensive, but this quality is really unacceptable.
【🚗Transportation】❌There is basically nothing within a 10-kilometer radius for children to eat and play.
[💰Consumption per capita is 500]❌Accommodation is 600 and meal is 600. I don’t dare to spend anything else. If you don’t spend it, you will feel sorry for your child. It just feels so disgusting to set a fee.

The yard is very big and the lake is very beautiful. I feel that there is still open space in it for expansion.

It may be that there are many people during the holiday, and it takes 40 minutes to check in...
The room in Building B is newly renovated, and the smell is too great.

Said it is a parent-child hotel, it doesn't even have a children's playground and swimming pool!
There is a children's slide in the lobby that can be called "Bird Paradise" and I am eye-opening.
The most funny thing is that when you booked the room, you said that you would pay to watch the flamingo. As a result, it was in the lobby where passers-by and passers-by could see it.
I really don’t know what you can do for 2 days! Older children don't do anything after spinning around for half an hour!
And the smell of the new decoration is very big, the room is full of the smell of the cabinet, and I can't sleep well all night, choking to death!
The breakfast was also flashy, and there was nothing to watch in a circle.
Nothing or five-star pricing is really far-fetched.
At most it is next to the Sunshine Valley, but when it rains, you will be completely blinded and can't do anything. Be cautious when it rains!

msg:Because the child’s school trip requires 14 days of nucleic acid isolation during November, I chose nearby hotels and booked Tianmu Hot Spring Hotel and Wanghong Flamingo Hotel from Ctrip. On the first day of staying at Tianmu Hot Spring Hotel, the facilities are still outdated. In contrast, the Flamingo Hotel is really a pleasant surprise. The hotel is very new, very suitable for a family hotel with children. The dinner buffet is also very rich, there are many parent-child interactive programs in the lobby, as well as hotel hosting services. It is really a good parent-child hotel around Tianjin. However, during the period of November, when we checked in at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, many people lined up for a long time. He brought two children with him. The younger brother had a nap in the afternoon and was making noise all the time. Fortunately, Manager Mei Xiaochen has been helping to find a relatively quiet place for the children to sleep in the lobby, and has been arranging to speed up the check-in procedures and smooth the queue of guests. At that time, I was in a bad mood, and the manager had always had a very good attitude to communicate and explain with me, and instantly lost his temper. I am really grateful to the manager Mei Xiaochen and other service staff of the hotel. If you can meet such a good service manager, we will stay here next time.

Hygiene is to deal with it hastily, and the bedding was changed when I looked at it. New ones will be replaced. Trust me, you won’t be able to replace them if you don’t look at them. The hotel focuses on parents and children, and the children’s playground is a slide that is not as big as in their own community. I can only say that the Internet celebrity hotel is really a lie and will not be fooled in the future. The following is the sight I saw when I entered the room at 4:30 in the afternoon🙂

We took the elderly and children to check into the hotel on October 1. I guess I chose the Unicom Suite, so I checked in smoothly. , reading the reviews, many people said that they had to wait for a long time. It is understandable that the rooms are full during the National Day period. Please be considerate. It is not easy. The lobby is particularly bright and the live flamingos are very fresh. 👍🏻 Popcorn, marshmallows, ice cream, and basketball dolls with faces. Waiting for the plane, there are beautiful young ladies and handsome young brothers organizing various parent-child activities. There are also small volunteer charity sales activities in the afternoon, aerobic exercise in the evening, etc. There are so many things. Walking in from the lobby is the Western restaurant, we will eat in the evening The buffet dinner is so sumptuous, the quality is online👍🏻The ingredients are very fresh👍🏻The foie gras, lobster, Buddha jumping over the wall and lamb chops are limited edition, as well as salmon, abalone steak, various desserts, ice cream, etc., which are loved by adults and children, and there are also performances for children. Everyone can participate in it, very attentive👍🏻Magic guessing, etc., the overall a**osphere is very good, the children all have a great time, under the leadership of Mr. Liu, the catering depar**ent must give 200% praise👍🏻As for the room, we I chose a lake view room, and the bedding is very comfortable. This room type is very good, suitable for a family, and it is very quiet at night and sleeps well. The room does not smell of new decoration👍🏻Finally, special thanks to Mr. Liu, the beautiful lobby manager (I don’t know your surname) Sorry) Laura's thoughtful, meticulous and professional service made our family feel at home. We are going to check in again at Chris**as. I wish your hotel will get better and better. Come on

msg:Good place for parents and children on weekends!
Attractions: There is nothing around except the zoo and hot springs. The food is concentrated in the hot springs. It takes nearly an hour to drive to the city.
The all-day parent-child paradise and the flamingo sightseeing (and forgot one) mentioned in the accommodation are actually free, not special. There is a tent camp outside the hotel, there will be animated movies in the evening, and a whale inflatable treasure is also set up, 20 yuan for fun, but the play is so-so.
Play: Parent-child hotel is to stay in hotel! It's not boring at all. Catch dolls, parent-child games, a small movie theater, and yoga fitness + square dance in the lobby at 7 pm, children love it, all for free. The paid face painting children especially like it. The wet towels are wiped off as soon as the weather is fine and the horse riding is good.
Stay: Building B is written about Le Pet Hotel. It should be operated independently in the future. I can see if there is an open breakfast area on the first floor. The taste of new decoration is inevitable, and it is not totally unacceptable. It's just that the hygiene is a bit poor, especially the lamps shouldn't be wiped... The amount of body soap in the bathroom is very small, and the most important thing is that there are no children's toothbrushes, towels, and bathrobes. I didn't give it the day before yesterday. Could it be because we didn't book a parent-child room?
Eat: Breakfast is all buffet, but there are more than eleven people, many of them are gone late, and when there are people eating together, the replenishment is not particularly timely. The restaurant in Nuo Da has a small coffee machine, and even the beans are 500g per bag. So that I didn't drink coffee for two days...
Overall it's good, worthy of such a cheap price. The details need to be improved, but I will still recommend friends.

msg:The Mid-Autumn Holiday Hotel for walking the baby is generally good, but as far as the main parent-child hotel is concerned, the children’s club is too small and there is no naughty castle. There is only a small slide and a small trampoline in one corner of the lobby. . There are a lot of activities. There are regular interactive performances, magic shows, face painting, and you can make tie-dye T-shirts yourself. There are hand-painted rabbits in the children’s club, and there are DIY mosaic coasters. The place is too small. We buy it. The room is made.
But the hotel’s epidemic prevention measures were not perfect. First, we entered the hotel from the parking lot on the first floor, and no one inquired about the health code and itinerary code. Due to the rain, most of the guests play in the lobby on the first floor of the hotel. No one reminds them to gather to wear masks. They are all consciously, so most of them don’t wear them. They are only required when entering the children’s club. Wear a mask.
Let’s talk about check-in. We booked a connecting room, which should be available for check-in at two o’clock. As one less guest has a late check-out, we repeatedly urged us to get the room card at the last 4 o’clock. If we open the door and enter the house, there will still be a taste of decoration. Not very serious, the facilities are okay, there is a capsule coffee machine, I like it very much, but one of the fixing nails of the shower rack broke down during the bathing at night, and I was shocked. Room service is very good, responsive, especially a good aunt!
Finally, let’s talk about the buffet. In the morning, there are not many varieties and the taste is okay. For lunch, the supply of crayfish and grilled scallops is not enough. I really don't understand it.

As for netizens, the room is damp and it is a bit damp, but it is not very exaggerated. It is recommended to bring your own sheets and quilts, which will be more comfortable, and it will not feel damp at all. Because the hotel’s quilt is too thick, the children can’t cover it at all.

There was a beauty salon doing celebrations that day and the kids’ cinema was used. When they came to their lounge, especially when they were eating, everyone was queuing in. As a result, the people in the restaurant told them that they could not sit in the middle, and they should be reserved for the people participating in the beauty salon activities. What is the meaning of queuing?
Because it is a new hotel, there is still a heavy decoration smell in the corridors and rooms, especially the room has a very smelly smell, so forget it if you are taking children
🔔Service: The welcome fruit given in the room reservation was not given until we left. It is difficult to find an extra bottle of water for cleaning, and all the snacks in the room are charged! There is no place to buy things around, anyway, it is very inconvenient~ very boring~ very worthless~ ****ing....

There is a lawn outside, where you can play football, and children in the hall can play. The attitude of the service staff is very good. If you go to Guanghe Valley nearby, buy your own vegetables and meat in advance. Can be fed to animals, tigers, children are particularly keen on this.

For those who are relatively large, the place to eat must be affluent! Besides, the Disney cartoon movies in the cinema are still good to be shown in loops. The flamingo is good and big enough and the color is light. There is a downside. There is no naughty bag and swimming pool. If you can make up for these two, you may live for an extra day.

msg:Due to the epidemic, they couldn't go out of the market, so I chose the nearby Flamingo Hotel. The two babies were playing very happily. The hotel is newly opened, the facilities are very new, there is no smell, you can rest assured. There are 8 flamingos in the middle of the hall. You can observe everything about the flamingos up close and feel very fresh. There are flamingo elements everywhere in the hotel, and children love it. The buffet is also very good, and the ingredients and seafood are fresh. The hotel has escort hosting services, the staff accompany you to make games, drawing and making handicrafts, and there is a children’s cinema, which simply liberates the parents! The next day I went to the nearby Guanghe Valley Zoo. There were quite a few animal species. It was a joy for the children to feed carrots.
Last but not least, the hotel’s service is really good. The children were already asleep when they came back from the zoo the next day. They were too tired and too hot. I communicated with the young lady at the front desk, Nami, and she told the babies to sleep at ease. I was in a hurry to check out, and we applied for a late check-out. The communication was very gentle and patient throughout the whole process. Thank you very much, Ms. Nami. Highly recommend friends around to bring their babies here for the weekend.

I have stayed in the hotel and watched the animals. It is also an uncommon flamingo in the north. The hotel’s service is very considerate. There is a special welcome ceremony in the lobby, with dolls, magicians, dancing, ice cream, popcorn, and cotton candy. After checking in, I spent more than an hour in the lobby and went to the room. The room was quite satisfactory, but it was beautiful, with pillows and glass. , Reminders, etc. are full of flamingo elements. The hotel’s happy restaurant has a very rich buffet, such as teppanyaki, barbecue, roast meat, roast leg of lamb, fresh beer, hot pot, and of course the favorite desserts of the wife and daughter. During the meal, there were performances, acrobatics, magic, singers, musical instruments, dances, etc. The children had fun playing behind the actors’ bottoms. The hotel also has a small space called Magic Box. The children can do handicrafts, tie-dye, make-up and play games with the staff. My wife and I sit on chairs to play the king, and get rid of the trouble of accompanying the beasts. The hotel has a free movie theater. (Mainly in cartoons), I actually fell in love with Peppa Pig while watching the mythical beasts. My daughter fell asleep and I was addicted to watching and was criticized by my wife. All in all, this experience is great, and I will come often in the future.

The children’s facilities have a small theater, some small game machines, and a hand workshop, which is generally relatively small for children to play. Well, older children would be better if they can swim, so even if there is no entertainment around, they can play in the hotel for two days without going out. The reason why I didn’t give a smiley face to the service is because of the amu*****t park of the cooperating valley, because There are few people and many projects have not been opened. We understand this, but the quality of the elder sister who checks the health code at the door really needs to be improved, because it is different from the verification method in Beijing. The one who ran there to travel, gave her a blow before entering the door. Everyone showed her the health code, but she felt that there was one she hadn’t seen, and aggressively pointed at our friend who had passed by and shouted, “Why don’t you? Show me the health code", I was speechless at the time. Without showing it to her, I almost put my mobile phone on her face, just as if we were "violating the law and discipline" and she came to "just enforce the law." In the end, our friend came back and gave her a look. We said that her attitude was too bad and we couldn’t accept it. However, not only did she not relax her attitude, she still maintained the attitude of “I am the biggest in my turf”, which disappointed our experience this time. There is no way, we only have to complain to the customer service center, and we need to be clear about reasoning with reasonable people, right? In short, the feeling of this trip is because this elder sister really doesn't want to remember

However, the hotel service needs to be improved. No one answered the room service call, and the room was not cleaned during the day.

msg:Very poor, especially the service, facilities, and hygiene! First, the check-in said it was two o’clock, and I didn’t check in at half past two. The lobby was filled with people waiting to check in. They gathered together in a mess, no one managed and no one asked. Many staff were very arrogant and answered. Basically I don't know, I don't know! Second, I reluctantly entered the room. I can only say that I should clean it up. Many places were not cleaned in place. I saw the staff cleaning the room while chatting. I didn't think about the number of people waiting to stay in anxious! Third, the Aofei room for more than 1,400 days has an extra Aofei blanket and two dirty dolls. There is nothing to say about the parent-child suite for more than 800 days. We booked three rooms and one suite. An Aofei room, a standard room, with two children, 127 cm for girls, 123 cm for boys, breakfast in the morning tells us that we need to pay, two children are half price, a group of four in front of us is brought by parents The two twins are 140 cm tall. After talking to the staff, they charged half the price for one child. They live in the parent-child suite directly above us. I don't understand it. Is this bargainable? Or is it to look at our family honestly? Our three rooms are more than twice as expensive as the other’s room rate. Two children will be charged two and a half price, and one room with two children will be charged one-and-a-half prices? bully? See people order dishes? Anyway, the money was waived after we raised an objection, but the staff was very unhappy and arrogant, and we were very unhappy too! Seek to explain! ! Fourth, there is nothing for breakfast, which is very inconsistent with the price. The price/performance ratio is super low. There is only a coffee machine in such a big restaurant. People in line can't get a cup of coffee for half an hour, and there is only one person in the noodle stall. , I won’t say much about other things, I suggest that everyone can ** takeaway, everything is very convenient, don’t order a room with breakfast, otherwise don’t do anything in the morning, just line up! Then talk about other things, the so-called naughty castle is so small that you doubt your own eyes! Can only meet under three years old! The health situation is worrying. After all, during the epidemic, let’s make up for it. There is also a children’s club where you can draw and play with some toys, even if it’s okay! The theaters are basically adults. The ventilation is very bad, the smell of feet, sweat, and it feels like this during the epidemic. The fully enclosed environment, not ventilated, is worrying, the boss is courageous. The dessert bar has a Starbucks sign. Actually, I didn't find anything related to Starbucks. I don't know if there are other things. When booking, say that staying in this hotel to go to Guanghe Valley has a free battery car pick-up service, exclusive service! In fact, there are electric cars, anyone can do it, see who can squeeze, see who can grab, see who can jam! No one manages and no one asks, don't sell hotel rooms under exclusive service signs! This is even more disgusting! Cigarette butts are everywhere in the elevator on the first floor! If you want to go, please fill in the details yourself. Is it not good to go to other hotels with the money? It feels like the deepest pitfall in ten years! It's not happy to come out, it's just for madness! The Xiongda Xiong Er Hotel is much better than this. The price of a room for more than 1,400 nights is a room with a floor area of 32. Is there no room in Tianjin? There must be remember! The reception desk and reception desk of the hotel, no one will answer these calls for a lifetime! In case you pass it once, you must thank God for your mercy

msg:I don’t understand why internet celebrities post **** just to earn traffic! The doorman said that many Internet celebrities came in to take videos and photos and then left. They would not check in. If you don’t have children, are you blindly recommending a family hotel? It’s a lively operation! I was dumbfounded when I went there! There are eight flamingos in total. Waiting in line for dinner! Line up an hour in advance after eating! You still have to queue up for breakfast! The hotel is really not big! The place to play is on the first floor! And there is nothing to play with at all! Just a small movie theater! It can accommodate about 20 children in one restaurant. The restaurant has an interactive parent-child show. It is just a very ordinary little magic trick. Take the children to do some interactive games. The charge for children's face painting is 38 per child, and the manicure is 59 per child! Occasionally someone will come to interact with the children! But on the day I went, I don’t know if there were too many people or what! That woman was not friendly at all. The children lined up and played games. After the line was lined up, some children did not have numbers. She started the game without saying anything. Wouldn't she tell the children behind her to wait in line to get their numbers again? The adults and children stood there like **! Let’s talk about the guest rooms! When I got in, there were hairs on both pillows! There are eyelashes on the table! The house smells like milk! Call customer service and ask for help with hot milk! The customer service promised to be happy, but no one came all night!

At 1:30 in the afternoon, we lined up at the hotel for an hour and a half at three o’clock and we told us that there was no room to wait. When did we know... So we went to the Guanghe Valley next to us and played around at 6 o’clock. The room was available but the sanitation was not cleaned... I just want to know that check out at 12 o’clock for 6 hours... No matter how full the hotel is, it can’t be so slow to clean up...
Besides eating...Breakfast is not as good as the whole season...Buffet dinner is even worse...298 people...Even lamb chops have to be exchanged...The lobster meat is green...The hairy crabs are empty...It's really lonely to eat...
Let’s talk about parent-child... the hotel focuses on parent-child... at least there must be a decent naughty castle... Except for a few flamingos in the lobby... I really don’t see other parent-child elements...
Overall, it's really not worth the price... won't come again...

It is recommended not to pay cash. If you say check-out is slow, use WeChat It was said that it was returned in 10-15 minutes, and it has been 12 hours, and it has not been returned yet (I also responded to it halfway). Two rooms were booked, one including welcome fruit, which was delivered at about 12 o'clock in the middle of the night. For dinner on the first floor, the restaurant is very large, and there is a long line to check a yard. The marshmallows, ice cream, and stalls in the lobby are 20 meters away, and there is only one waiter. The surrounding environment is very poor, the road has not been repaired, does not have a parent-child hotel, can play high requirements without going out.

msg:It was already dark on a rainy day when I arrived at the hotel. Take two children. Park the car in the underground parking lot. After arriving at the service desk, I learned that they still have Building B, and they didn't check in for us and let us get there. Originally they had a hotel car, but they cruelly asked me to take the suitcase and take the child to another building. I asked if I can park, but I don't know the direction. Checking in took a long time. Busy looking for food after opening the room. There is no restaurant in Building B, so I have to go back to the original building. Hugging two children and went in the rain. The restaurant cannot be a la carte but can only be self-service, 198 children are free. There are so many choices to eat, but how can you eat so many? ! The restaurant has performances for children to play. After eating, I had to go back to Building B under the rain. Because the hotel is too new, the inside taste is too strong. The child is not sleeping well. It was still raining the next day, and I had to eat. Damn! What a shame. It's a storm this time! There are so many people for breakfast, you have to line up to get food. The restaurant is in a hurry. After eating, we went to the only place where we could play in the hall. There were too many people. The place to play is small. There is really no way but to find other places to play. The room key cannot open the door when I come back at night. Holding the sleeping child to the front desk playing cards. The room development did not clean the room for us, and did not even give us water. The room phone couldn't get through, and I had to go to the front desk to get a few bottles of water. I had to open the window to sleep this night. It's kind of cold. To check out the next day, the power to our room was severely cut off at 12 o'clock! The front desk also said there might be something wrong. We just checked out. Although the hotel has just opened, the service is too inadequate. This time it can only give very low scores. Hope it can be improved.

msg:The main thing is to win in a new one, and there are too many slots. The overall management concept and staff service awareness of the hotel needs to be improved.
-The room card will be demagnetized from time to time every day, and other hotels also happen from time to time, but there is no public phone in the elevator on this floor, so run up and down.
-The seafood buffet at the hotel’s own expense was posted on Dianping for a guest room upgrade promotion, and then the restaurant and hotel front desk staff were confused, and asked back and forth.
-The breakfast restaurant staff worked with emotions. They were very impatient when customers asked which noodles to choose. A bowl of noodles cooked in advance was placed on the countertop. Obviously, the noodles exposed on the surface of the soup had dried to the point of discoloration.
-There is a child trampoline in the hotel lobby. One of the guardrail screws is missing, and the guardrail will open with a slight push. Although kindly reminded the front desk staff of the hotel, the staff lowered their heads to the computer screen and did not look up, as if it was not her responsibility. Even if she is not in charge of her, even if she has a job on hand, speaking and looking at each other is the basic of the service industry.
-There is free ice cream in the lobby of the hotel for children. After a bite, I found that the biscuits in the cone were damp and had a strange texture and taste, so they were thrown away. Points will be deducted for all sub-questions.
-I wanted to ask the front desk for a bottle of water when I checked out, but was told that the front desk would not put water.
Such slots are not listed one by one. As mentioned at the beginning, the overall service and management concept and level have not yet been reached. After one correction, the hotel’s popularity has disappeared. In fact, it is not a problem in principle, but every time. In a similar situation, you will feel that no matter how much money you have, it is not worth the price.

It is mainly a parent-child hotel. As a result, there is almost no baby to play. There is only a zoo nearby. , I want to watch animals come all the way to you? The hotel is not as good as the 300 hotel in Binhai New Area the day before. Focus! Epidemic prevention awareness is particularly poor. There is no staff who enters and exits the hotel to check the itinerary code and health code. If this is to report your hotel's dereliction of epidemic prevention, you should report it. If you don't believe it, try it. The bed is very small. Disappointed!

Disadvantages: The decoration of the newly opened hotel room is a bit big; the quilt in the room is too thick in summer; there are less than ten flamingos in the lobby, which is a bit small.
The breakfast is so-so; the buffet dinner has performances, and the big brother who makes spicy crayfish is very good; the photosynthetic valley near the hotel can not feed small animals, but the amu*****t facilities are not open, and the playability is not high...

There is a noodle soup, several cold dishes, fried eggs, bacon and chicken sausage. The quality of bacon is very poor. The hotel breakfast at the same price is the worst. I don’t know why I didn’t have normal autonomy during dinner. Maybe I caught up with the tour group. The buffet at night was really poor. There were only four kinds of hot dishes. There was also a white chicken, and then fried rice noodles, one kind of bread, egg tarts and several kinds. West point, then four or five cold dishes, of course, the price is 70, not expensive but I'm sorry for this price, there is a beef offal in the hot dish, basically only the lungs, especially fishy, don't eat it. The biggest problem with this hotel is the poor service. We came back at 8 o'clock in the evening and there was no parking place on the ground. So we went to the underground parking lot to find a location. I was in a hurry. I asked someone to come and find us to arrange a place. I didn’t see anyone for a minute or two or 20 minutes away. I had to find a place on the ground and stopped. I was told that I couldn’t stop. It would take more than ten minutes to go to a place away from the hotel. The problem is that the first weather is too hot, the second parking lot has no street lights all the way back, and the wilderness around the hotel is very unsafe. Finally, the lobby manager was called in to solve it. Don't set his kind of one-to-one parent-child room, anyway, we set it at the end of the corridor, maybe next to it is the equipment room, there is always the sound of machines at night. Not coincidentally, the air conditioner in the room we ordered was broken, and the cooling was ok, but the sound was super loud, just like driving a tractor in the house, and the air outlet design was unreasonable, and there was a small bed for the child to sleep in. Because of the air conditioner, we have been tossing until two o’clock, but we had no choice but to call the front desk. After looking at the front desk, they said to go back to discuss how to solve it. The result was nothing but no reply. We couldn’t turn on the air conditioner during the dog days, and the couple could only fan the children. I only slept for a while when the breakfast was cooler, and I had to drive the next day. In addition, the back of the hotel is still under construction, and there is some noise during the day, which has little effect. Generally, they go out to play during the day, and they don't do it at night. Besides, the room still smells a bit, maybe it's too new.

msg:Take the baby to participate in the game, the baby stays with the team, and the family cheering group also chose this hotel together. . The parent-child-themed hotel has many arrangements that children like, such as real flamingos, children's theaters, but only one piece of Peppa Pig. There are some programs and games in the buffet dinner. Anyway the kids will love it. However, the location is relatively remote, there are not many shops around, even the supermarket is a few kilometers away. The hotel service is still very good. The fat manager in the lobby helped coordinate the exchange of rooms. Manager Xue from the restaurant was very enthusiastic to help the elderly find mobile phones. Manager Wu from the coffee bar in the lobby also helped solve the difficulty of not being able to buy aunt towels. Although there are some deficiencies, the thoughtful service still makes up for the shortcomings of many facilities. I hope the hotel can pay enough attention to the problem of water pipe odor.

This is a hotel that has only been open for two months. There is also a hotel buffet, 128 people for lunch, and there are so few things to eat! There is really no hearty breakfast, hey. Write a review for the first time. Hope the hotel can introspect.

msg:Advantages: The hotel is hosted by Manhattan Group, the details are well done, the hotel from check-in to check-out, the front desk, restaurant, room service staff are very good, this praise, there are many activities in the hotel lobby, and there are many games, very suitable for parents and children, restaurant There are performances for dinner and dinner, which is very good. The room is relatively new and the price is very high. The details are well done. Toiletries, slippers, and bags are very characteristic. The bags are very beautiful. The envelope at the front desk is very good.
Disadvantages: There are no supporting facilities around, and the parks with increased tickets are generally not recommended. The cost-effectiveness of food and beverages is too poor. Lunch is 98, dinner is 198, which is not very cost-effective. There should be more children’s interaction in the play area. More games should be added. It is strongly recommended to add more children’s education experience activities outside the area, and add a few foreign language teachers (all kindergarten teachers can) Catering must strengthen training and cost control. 98 and 198 are definitely not the case This kind of quality. The cafe in the lobby should be put to good use.
On the whole, it is worth recommending. The price/performance ratio is generally OK. Children can play a little more and strengthen interaction.

樓層販賣機超級便利，貨品全，價格也不貴！
去光合谷可以搭乘免費的擺渡車，送到動物園門口，回來可提前給前台打電話叫擺渡車！
早餐邊看火烈鳥邊吃，孩子很喜歡，就是沒幾衹火烈鳥。餐品還行，基本的都有，麪包種類少，煎餅果子排大隊，餐廳很大，假期也還好，能找到座位，服務人員不多，但也算有求必應。
後門直通動物科學王國和沙漠探險王國，住一晚玩兒兩天還是很OK的，推薦親子游前來。

2. 買的套票，包括動物科學王國，所謂沙漠樂園，vr體驗等， 動物科學王國那個相比天河城的zuli可差多了，沒多少小動物… 沙漠樂園那個一般吧，小孩子還行對於，不過沒啥特色。 另外什麼火烈鳥觀賞的兩份票就有點奇葩，大堂玻璃窗裏面哪裡還需要票…。總的來説娛樂項目少且相當一般。
3. 早餐那水準跟三星以下快捷酒店有一拼
總的來説，一般般吧。很難再有興趣再來。比這好的地方太多了。

msg:設施：新酒店，設施比新，但是房間沒有酒店介紹單，想了解都有哪些娛樂休閑設施無從下手。後來親身探索後發現，衹有一層大堂有幾台娃娃機，單獨收費的VR，隔着玻璃看看鳥，一個小童影院就沒有了，很是無趣。
衞生：地毯有些臟，房間和衞生間角落臟的更明顯。
環境：我們是帶孩子來的，主要就是讓他開心，酒店內部設施貧瘠如上所述，室外倒是能打65分吧。分低原因是要單獨收費，而且價格並不低（相對911一晚的放假而言）。
服務：這個沒什麼體會，不過免費送了一份果盤。
就餐：下午4點多去的，不存在午飯問題，晚飯衹有200多的自助，我們沒有去吃，不是很餓，但是看評價應該還不錯。周邊外賣比較貧瘠。
早餐:中規中矩

總體感受：65分吧，不會再來了！

比較好的是前台，服務還比較好，彌補了一些不足。大堂一百元代金券，挺好，大堂吧能用來買水。

msg:服務：首先酒店正式員工的服務是挺好的，但是臨時工（一看就是隔壁學校的大學生）真的有點讓人無語，麻煩酒店給淘氣堡那邊的大學生培訓下吧。玩個VR幾點開始他自己都整不明白。
餐飲：348元的自助餐純粹是坑五一出遊的人的，拿龍蝦去忽悠人，其實龍蝦都是那種凍了很久的存貨，難以下嚥。別的就真的沒啥了，也就100元自助的標準，還不如開車去附近肯德基周邊吃點。
房間：空調不管用，一直28度，熱的難受，唯一的好處就是不用蓋被子了
優點：旁邊有光合谷，可以玩玩

msg:可能是沒接觸過高峯旅遊的客流量，服務明顯跟不上，房間無法按時入住，還因此學了個新詞——“臟房入住”（沒用的知識又增加了）。因入住長時間拖延，導致能玩的項目玩不了全場館就關門了，票都是當日票，第二天無法使用，雖説場館看門的讓去前台補條後勉強讓進了，但體驗不好，好不容易迎來的假日心情受到極大打擊，傳幾個當時錄的視頻，客觀記錄，估計這酒店平時肯定不這樣，突如其來的客流高峯讓他也措手不及，我表示理解，但這問題終究是酒店的問題，希望下一波遊客不要再經歷我的體驗
