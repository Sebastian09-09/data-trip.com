msg:As first-time visitors to Wanning, we weren’t really sure which area would be the best for staying. However, we were pleasantly surprised by this location along the Shenzhou Peninsula. The surrounding area is quite nice, with a rocky shoreline not far away and a great beach area behind the hotel. 

Check-In went smoothly and the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Shoutout to Paul Tang 唐亚超 for the excellent service. The room was comfortable and spacious, with a great balcony view of the garden and ocean.

The buffet breakfast was great as well, with a variety of different cuisine options available. We especially enjoyed that they offered fresh fruit juice instead of the beverage type. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay and would love to stay again the next time we are in Wanning!

msg:Location is great, directly at the beach. The hotel tries to satisfy any possible need for extra money. You can book surfing courses - otherwise swimming in the sea is forbidden for unknown reasons - rent quads or fly with a small tourist helicopter. Needless to mention the noise level you have to expect at the beach. Relaxing is not easy, as there’s also loud music from the beach bar all day plus a merry-go-round for children. Dinners are accompanied by even louder live band. Dinner is overpriced and quality low. Same in the neighbor hotel “Four Points by Sheraton”, which additionally has extremely poor service. We also had a construction site under our window and experienced low flexibility of the hotel management. One very positive thing to mention is the breakfast and the service personnel in the main restaurant. Bring everything you need, because there’s nothing nearby to buy daily needs. Also, the next external restaurant is really far.

msg:This hotel is great for those who enjoy lazy days with delicious food, maybi to increase some weight. But it's no brainer for those who are looking for active holiday with swimming or surfing, for those who want to stay healthy. Why? Swimming and surfing not allowed!!! We had to sign a declaration that you will not be swimming in the sea already by check in!! The signs with "no swimming" are everywhere, even on the door of our room! Instead of sea, they offered us very large swimming pool. The pool is really great. But the problem is there are poeple on paddle board running around without paying attention to the swimmers - you can see on the picture. So it was quite normal to get hit by a paddle to the head. It was really dangerous, I really do not understand this. Then we wanted to go surfing - also failed. There is a surfing club whit boards and staff. But they rejected to rent a board to me. They only allow to rent a board with coach - for 5x higher price of course. So you are not allowed to surf alone. In the end, we took Didi everyday and traveled to Shimei beach where surfing was allowed.  So I can't give more than one start for the service, even when I consider other service on good level. 
The hotel itself is good, rooms are not large but comfortable. THe breakfast is really delicious and dinner as well. The beach is beautiful, I'm sorry to be allowed just to watch it.

We were not aware of it until to arrive at the reception where they asked us to sign a waiver forbidding us and agreeing to not go. The service at the

Although the hardware facilities are old, they are almost negligible against the backdrop of advantages in all aspects. From the details, we can see that the staff are cleaning carefully every day, spotless from inside to outside.
The service is even more considerate. Before we arrived at the store, there was already a butler to contact us. The butler Xiao Liu learned about our preferences and arrival time in advance, and carefully helped us arrange it. In the end, he also helped us upgrade the sea view room. The room view was simply a surprise!
When night came, it was so pleasant to listen to music and eat dinner on the beach with my mother. The sea breeze blew away all the troubles. After dinner, we strolled on the beach and sat in each beach bar. The style was different and unique.
This time I really hate that the vacation is too short, otherwise I really want to stay a few more days! I will definitely come again next time!
If you want to go to play, don't look at the bad reviews, close your eyes and go to Sheraton! It is absolutely the most cost-effective and full of surprises!
Finally, I would like to thank the housekeeper Xiao Liu again, for his enthusiasm and thoughtfulness. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you🙏

1. The staff in the guest rooms and restaurant are very nice:
(a) When the child came back from swimming, he happened to meet the aunt cleaning the room. The aunt took the initiative to hand over a towel and reminded the child to be careful of catching a cold;
(b) During breakfast, the child accidentally choked and vomited when drinking water. The closing guy was very considerate to hand over napkins, and the cleaning aunt also cleaned up in time. The whole process was very friendly;
2. The hotel landscape, beach bar, pool activities, and sea-hunting activities are all great, full of holiday feeling.

Disadvantages:
(a) The room is slightly old, and the tile skirting at the entrance of the room has fallen off;
(b) Check-in was at 6 pm, and there was only one front desk staff, so the waiting time for check-in was a little long;
(c) During the stay, I received an inquiry call from other guests. After communicating with the other party, I found that it was a hotel staff who mistakenly gave my phone number as a hotel staff number to other guests;
(d) The deposit refund was delayed. Please help the official to handle it as soon as possible:
Although I called the hotel customer service and got a reply that it would be handled immediately, I have left the hotel for 2 days, but I still have not received the refund of the 2,000 yuan check-in deposit.

msg:I read some bad reviews before coming here, and I was very nervous.
But I really like the sand and sunset of Shenzhou Peninsula.
When I was hesitating, the family suite was sold out.
So I booked a sea view suite temporarily.
I didn’t expect the experience to be so great!
Thanks to Xiao Wu, the housekeeper, for giving us a suite with a direct view of the sea.
The room was clean and tidy and super big.
Although there was only one big bed,
but it was no problem for our 16-year-old handsome boy to sleep on the sofa in the living room.
I asked for a lot of small things in the middle, and the housekeeper responded promptly.
I slept until after 10 o’clock on the weekend morning,
had a leisurely breakfast, went to the swimming pool and had fun. I returned with reluctance.
I will come again if I have the chance!

Children's surfing, jungle rock climbing, competitive sports games, paddle board competitions, and beach bonfire parties are all very interesting.

There are many entertainment activities on the beach, and surfing and water trailers are very exciting and must be experienced.

Account manager Luna accompanied the whole process, providing food, entertainment, shopping and other guides, and the service responded promptly. The hotel's breakfast and Thai food are both large and delicious. You can come here to surf and stay next time.

Several check-in locations in the hotel are particularly photogenic.

msg:After staying in all four blocks of Wanning, I found the Sheraton Treasure Hotel in Shenzhou Peninsula. If you want an immersive paradise-like vacation experience like in the Maldives, you must choose the Sheraton in Shenzhou Peninsula. 

[All the elements of beach immersion vacation are gathered at once] 
◆ The blue sea (the most extended part of the four blocks of Wanning, the sea water is really blue) 
◆ The rolling waves (the waves of Shenzhou Peninsula are the largest in Wanning, the view is wide and shocking, and many people surf here) 
◆ The soft sandy beach (better than the sand quality of Sun Moon Bay There are so many, it's on par with Qingshui Bay) 
◆ Internet celebrity Corona Sunset Bar (this is a must-visit bar, it's so photogenic) 
◆ 50-meter standard pool + super large entertainment pool (this pool is the largest in the hotels I've stayed in Hainan, it's ridiculously luxurious with an area of ​​5,500 square meters, and those who like to play in the water must not miss it) 
◆ Various elements that embellish the beach holiday a**osphere (barbecue singers, sunset bus trains, carousels) 
All of the above can be gathered in one hotel at once, can you believe it? 

[Scenery] 
◆ The scenery of Shenzhou Peninsula should be the most extensive and shocking in Wanning, with a 700-meter golden coastline + The 50,000 square meter golden beach has the best of the time and location, with blue sea, big waves and soft sand. 
◆Another important point is that the distance between the hotel and the beach and the waves is just right, not too close or too far, it is very convenient to walk there, and the view is very wide at a relatively close distance. You can lie on the balcony of the hotel and enjoy the sea. 

【Hotel Hardware】 
◆Hainan Island's top swimming pool, standard pool + entertainment pool larger than the standard pool (a total of 5,500 square meters of swimming pool, I was stunned, absolutely) 
◆Other entertainment There are also all kinds of entertainment facilities. The hotel is too big to experience them one by one. I will come again next time if I have the chance. 

[Room facilities] 
◆ The basic room type is 53 square meters, spacious and comfortable, Marriott five-star standard, no details are given 

[Food and Drinks] 
◆ There are very rich Chinese and Western breakfast options. You can have breakfast in the outdoor area and overlook the beach and the sea 
◆ There are many choices for dinner, including hot pot and Cantonese cuisine 
◆ For drinks, Corona Sunset Bar + the wide view of the lobby on the second floor of the hotel, both places are very good for drinking a drink and embracing the sea 

[Sheraton-Butler Service Ceiling] 
◆ Special thanks to Xiao Liu, who was so considerate. The room was arranged in advance to avoid us waiting. Every detail from check-in to check-out was introduced very clearly and patiently. Because the hotel is very large and has many facilities, the butler service greatly improved the stay experience of my family and me this time. 
◆ The key is that when the hotel is almost full on weekends, it is still very thoughtful and arranges the most suitable room according to my family's preferences. Although Xiao Liu is very busy, he still takes care of every detail, so I wrote so much about the experience of staying at Sheraton this time. 

[Summary] 
◆ Many people said in the comments before that Sheraton can bring an immersive holiday experience like the Maldives. After staying this time, it is indeed true. 
◆ It is a must-stay hotel in Wanning (there are no high-star hotels in Riyue Bay and Xinglong, and the sea view of Shimei Bay is slightly worse than that of Shenzhou Peninsula, because Shenzhou Peninsula extends further outward). Sheraton's entertainment facilities are also fully leading, suitable for families, parents, couples, and friends. Have fun. 
I will definitely come again next time if I have the chance

When she was told no, she put the QR code on the table directly into the drawer and said it had nothing to do with her. After checking in, no one told me where the restaurant was, where the parent-child activities were, what time breakfast was, and the main point was that there was no service at all. 
The waters and beaches outside the hotel are really very good. It is the best beach in Hainan.
The dinner buffet was also unsatisfactory. It was said to be a barbecue buffet, but they only gave two alcohol lamps. The meat was never cooked on the beach.
If you want to consider it a parent-child hotel, the minimum service should keep up!

Super considerate, thoughtful, and service. 
You are not alone on the road of travel~
Recommend the nearby food and the surrounding tour routes. You must check in at the Corona Sunset Bar on the beach. It is so beautiful when the sun sets. The hotel is not far from the Internet celebrity lighthouse. I will come here again next time. I also want to give feedback on a problem. Since the bonfire party was already there, I don’t know what happened. I made an appoin**ent for the activity of catching the sea, but they said there was no place. I feel that this is all a scam.

msg:I have been planning a trip to the island for a long time. The main purpose is to take my children to play. I booked the hotel 20 days in advance. The only drawback is that the order cannot be canceled or changed.
Sheraton is my first choice when visiting cities around my home. Firstly, I like the service, and secondly, I like to book a suite that is more spacious. . .
The ocean suite I booked this time is 106 square meters. The room is very spacious. Although it is old, it is still clean. After arranging the check-in, I added the butler Luna's WeChat account. If I have any questions, I can communicate at any time and he is available at any time. This is very convenient.
The disadvantage is that the buffet restaurant is mainly barbecue, and there is nothing for children to eat. The bibimbap is spicy, the tom yum soup is spicy, and there are no stir-fries or noodles, so I can only go back to the room and order noodles for the children. .
The breakfast is quite satisfactory. I highly recommend the noodles and some toppings. They are so delicious. My children love them and I also love them. It is very similar to the hot pot noodles made at home when I was a child. . . .
Because I was worried about the inconvenience of having too much luggage with my children, I sent my luggage to the hotel in advance and ordered some couriers. There is a concierge at the entrance of the front hall specifically for luggage express delivery. This is particularly good. For those who don’t want to carry too much luggage on the road, you can take this option. Mailing is very convenient. . .
I would also like to praise that if you want to eat at the Thai restaurant in the Four Points by Sheraton next door, a shuttle bus will take you there and take you back. This is also a good experience. I went to the Four Points by Sheraton twice to eat Thai food because there are children there who can eat. meals. . .
The hotel has a swimming pool, but the temperature is not high enough to go in. There is a bar and a beach in front of the hotel, so it is very convenient to go to the beach. .
The biggest regret is that the child fell ill as soon as he arrived. As a parent, he was not in the mood to have fun. He could only play on the beach of the hotel two or three times. My husband and I took out a lot of medicine. We originally booked a hotel for four nights, but we had no choice but to stay in the hotel for four nights. I applied to Ctrip to check out the hotel one day in advance. After Ctrip learned about the situation, I quickly agreed to communicate with the hotel. The hotel first asked if I had gone to the hospital, and then asked if there was a return ticket (how could I change my ticket before successfully applying?) , and then they said that 20% of the room fee would be deducted for early cancellation. Ctrip called me many times. I was getting a little irritable while the children were having breakfast. Finally, Ctrip said that the hotel manager would go to the room. After confirming the situation, my God, it is really frustrating. I immediately said, come on, come and check on the child's condition, and there is a table of medicines. . . My husband has already begun to persuade me to forget about quitting early and hold on for one more day. . .
In the end, I canceled the flight early and changed my ticket. It was already ten o'clock in the evening when I arrived in Beijing. I took my child to the hospital the next day because he had a bacterial infection. . .
It wasn't a smooth trip, but it was a very lucky trip. It didn't rain during the rainy season, but the child's illness affected the plan. .
The housekeeper Luna's service is very good. I will come back to her next time. .
Although I am not very satisfied with the hotel overall, it does not affect the five-star rating. After all, mutual understanding can go a long way!

You can walk directly on the beach wearing the hole shoes prepared by the hotel. It is very beautiful. There are lounge chairs in the courtyard of the family room, which can face the sea directly. It is worth mentioning that Kyra, the front desk customer service, is very warm and thoughtful. She answered all questions and enthusiastically helped with luggage and elevators. She was very patient and friendly. She also reminded us of the meal time very carefully and helped to borrow a knife and fork so that we could eat purchased mangoes in the room. The breakfast is rich, and you can eat breakfast on the platform while watching the sea view. The 50m swimming pool is very rare, with good water quality and a good swim. The only drawback is that there are a few plugs in the room, which is inconvenient to charge.

msg:I am used to only choosing five-star hotels when traveling, so I didn’t consider Riyue Bay for accommodation because there are only B&Bs there. There are 4 five-star hotels in Wanning, Shimei Bay Westin, Shimei Bay Le Meridien, and Shenzhou Peninsula. Sheraton, Grand Hyatt Shenzhou Peninsula. We plan to travel for 6 days, so we plan to stay in Shenzhou for two days and Shimei Bay for three days. I originally wanted to book the Grand Hyatt, but the itinerary was very urgent and was planned two days in advance, so there were no rooms at all, so China had to stay at the Sheraton. I read online that this Sheraton was very old and had poor facilities, so I really didn't have any hopes at first. But until the housekeeper Luna contacted me, my pleasant stay experience began🤗🤗

Service: Let’s talk about service first. Luna is a very considerate and warm housekeeper. After adding my WeChat account, I tried to ask if there was any chance to upgrade my room (because I had no hope for Sheraton, so I didn’t decide). I just booked a king-size bed room for a sea view room. As a result, Luna upgraded me to a sea view room! After checking in, Luna took me into the room and introduced the various facilities and environment of the hotel along the way. It was really warm! Come out! When traveling and staying in a good hotel, you have the appetite to enjoy these services! Thank you
Facilities: Enter the sea view room. The room is very large. There is a sofa in the living room, an office area, and a balcony outside, facing the sea. I felt pretty good when I entered the room. It was not as old as everyone said online. Although this Sheraton has been open for ten years, I think they have maintained the room facilities very well. The various facilities do not feel old or broken. Yes, Sheraton has a pretty standard style. So I think it’s great, it’s not old!
Environment: I think the environment of the hotel is another unexpected surprise for me. Downstairs is the Internet celebrity Corona, just look down from my room. Going downstairs is the beach, and then you can lie down in Corona and drink some wine. It’s really chilling! ! ! Walking along the beach, there is Casa Corona in front, and there is another restaurant and bar. Anyway, the Sheraton downstairs is really cool! Lie down wherever you want. It's the off-season at this time, so there aren't many people there, so it's very comfortable! Someone sets off fireworks on the beach at night, how romantic it is!

In summary, the beaches of Shenzhou Peninsula are better than those of Riyue Bay and Shimei Bay. The sand is very fine and very comfortable to step on. The butler service at the Sheraton Hotel is excellent! Although the hotel is old, the facilities are well maintained. There are several restaurants and bars on the beach downstairs. If I were to come to Wanning for the second time, I would still stay at the Sheraton🥰

msg:Overall, I am very satisfied. I don't give it 5 points because I want the hotel to not relax and slack off in the future, and have more room for improvement to provide better service to customers!
One day before check-in, the hotel called me in advance and asked the housekeeper Xiao Liu to add me on WeChat so that he could contact me in advance. I booked a double bed room for three nights, and later Xiao Liu helped me upgrade to a sea view room on the 5th floor. I was very satisfied! When I checked in, Xiao Liu was not there, and the front desk arranged another brother to send it. However, the brother only told me the location of the elevator and left... So some people said that the luggage was sent to the room and introduced the hotel's facilities, but I didn't enjoy it! So I didn't find an indoor playground until the last moment of leaving the hotel.
Let's talk about the room. The room is very large and spacious. There will be a little smell when you just enter the door, but just open the balcony door for ventilation. The air purifier is also running all the time, so there is no big problem. The sound insulation effect is very good. Once the balcony door is closed, it is very quiet to sleep. The room aunt on the floor is also great. She greeted me when she passed by and asked me if I needed to clean the room. It feels very kind and professional!
The hotel has a bubble party by the pool every day, and the children like it very much. You can go every day without making an appointment. Swimming rings are not available for rental in this season, so if you need them, you can bring them yourself, or order one for takeout, which will be placed in the takeout cabinet, which is very convenient. Breakfast seems to be from 7 to 10:30. We always go downstairs after 10 o'clock, grab the food before the stall closes at 10:30, and then sit there and eat slowly. But there will be mosquitoes, so pay attention to mosquito prevention! Breakfast has various porridge, noodles, bread, various milk, fruits, salads, stir-fried vegetables, etc. It is not very good, but it is still acceptable. I think the fruits can be replaced with local specialties, don't often say apples and pears. It seems that there are only one day with mango in 3 days, and the rest are watermelons, cantaloupes, and pineapples are also canned.
The beach is at the entrance of the hotel. I think the sand is quite fine and it is very comfortable to walk barefoot. The swimming pool is also very large, with a children's area and an adult area, separated into two areas, very large and very convenient. The hotel has a buffet in the evening. The seafood is not very good, and it is not good to eat casually. It just so happens that the children are still young and don't have to pay, so it feels cost-effective. There are singers singing and the atmosphere is pretty good. If you need it, you can make an appointment one day in advance. I saw that it was 258 that day, and then I didn't know about this event, so Xiao Liu asked me to ** the 318 of the group. The original price is 368, and 368 is not cost-effective. It is recommended to make an appointment one day in advance for those who want to eat, 258 is still okay. You can go in and see the dishes first, and then decide whether to eat.
It may be due to the off-season recently. I don't know whether the exterior wall of the hotel is being cleaned or renovated. There will be workers passing by during the day, so it doesn't feel particularly good.
In short, I am generally satisfied. I should still choose this place when I come to Wanning next time. It is also very convenient to take a taxi, and the service of the welcoming brother is also very good! I will praise Xiao Liu again, because I didn't make a strategy in advance, so whether it is about the hotel or about playing, I have consulted him, Xiao Liu always replied to me as soon as possible, and will give very pertinent suggestions. I may have more questions, and he also patiently answered me. I think it is very real and reassures me! It's a pity that I didn't see him, hahaha!

I didn't notice that the beach here is open to the public before booking, and the hotel activities are also open to the public. Many people are from the surrounding homestays who simply come to participate in activities and punch in. There are so many people and it's messy! A bunch of star chasers also ran to the hotel. When I saw the elderly with children who were not staying in the hotel, after participating in the bubble party, they washed their children's shoes in the swimming pool, and they felt very explosive instantly. I didn't want to go into the water again. There was no one to watch and remind me. I felt that this hotel was staying in, uh 😓, next time I must pay attention to choosing a hotel with a private beach. This management and service is a pity for the surrounding environment, and it's not worth the price. It is recommended to strengthen management, after all, it was not the peak season when I went there. Summary: Internet celebrity punch-in place, a detour for quality pursuit. Not a good holiday choice.

The hotel confirmed the itinerary in advance before checking in, and the housekeeper added WeChat , I would like to express my special thanks to the housekeeper Luna. The whole service was prompt and thoughtful. Check-in and check-out of the hotel were very fast. There is a swimming pool and beach just outside the lobby.

msg:Last year’s trip to Hainan left a deep impression on Wanning. This time, Guizhou ended up flying directly to Hainan. Sheraton's rooms are really popular, but it's a pity that we only booked them for two nights.
Before I checked in, I exchanged WeChat messages with the housekeeper Xiao Wu. Xiao Wu thoughtfully sent me tips on surrounding areas and reminded me of the temperature every day and asked about my needs.
Check-in is very convenient. The scenery is right after you open the door. You can see the waves rising and falling, and you can watch the sunset at the check-in point. It's very nice! It's super convenient to go downstairs to the beach. The hotel facilities are also well maintained, the water pressure is sufficient, and taking a bath is very relaxing. There is also a small refrigerator in the room, which can freeze drinks and fruits.
"Double breakfast" is my motivation to get up early every day. There are many kinds of noodles and freshly baked croissants, and they are also delicious.
In short, the experience was OK, I will come again next time!

At first, I was hesitant because of the bad reviews of the hotel, and I was worried that my stay would be uncomfortable. Finally, in order to experience more different hotels, I chose to experience the hotel’s grand design style in person. The room is beautiful, the space is good, the bedding is clean and comfortable, the hotel has two outdoor swimming pools, and one is especially suitable for young children. Babies are very happy to play in the swimming pool. The breakfast in the hotel is rich and the food quality is also good.

Bathrobes, toothbrushes, washing supplies for the baby, and beach shoes for our family of three were all prepared. Okay, it's really warm. The service was very good for three days. The concierge at the gate was also very polite. The most important thing is the considerate and reliable service of the handsome butler Xiao Wu. Knowing that the baby cannot eat heavy food, he specially gave the local baby free of charge. As a fan, I learned that my husband was injured and prepared a band-aid. It can be said that he is always available when he is asked. Besides, the hotel itself is located in the internet-famous Corona restaurant, which is very convenient. The travel photos provided by the hotel are also great. It is really the first choice for family travel.

msg:For this trip to Wanning, Hainan, I chose Sheraton for one night and Le Meridien for the next three nights.
Sheraton's hardware and the activities it can arrange for children are indeed not as good as Amy's as stated online. But the care of humanistic services can also bridge the gap in this regard. The day before check-in, Sheraton’s butler Xiao Wu added WeChat. I have only experienced clubmed's butler service before, and I feel that communicating through WeChat is really convenient and efficient. This time Xiao Wu's performance was even better.
First of all, Sheraton’s charging parking spaces do not have only two special power stations for fast charging underground as online reviews suggest. In addition, there are four or five electric piles scattered underground. Worried about not enough piles? It doesn't matter, Butler Wu can help, and I have to give you a big thumbs up for this! In addition, the front desk informed me that there are public charging piles within 400 to 500 meters of the China Construction Bank. But I only stayed for one night and didn’t have the chance to experience it on the ground.
Secondly, when checking in, the front desk took the initiative to upgrade to a sea view room, which has a better view and can see part of the sea; Xiao Wu also gave us a Hainan special souvenir when we checked in, and the coconut cookies were delicious.
The breakfast buffet environment is very good, and there is also an outdoor dining environment in addition to indoors.
There are some shortcomings in terms of hardware: for example, the toilet drains too slowly after being exposed to rain, and the TV is old and the picture is very unclear.

msg:What a great hotel experience at Wanning Station in Hainan. First of all, I have to talk about the service of the butler Xiao Wu. His family-like service attitude is very good. He responds to all requests and responds very quickly. The experience courses reserved for the children are not bad at all and are arranged immediately. , SMS confirmation, phone reminder, all of them are numerous. I feel that the service staff are more caring than me. It is indeed a five-star hotel! Before leaving, I was given a small souvenir with the name of the hotel printed on it. It really felt like a VIP... If the subsequent itinerary had not been arranged, I really wanted to stay a few more days... Then let's talk about the hotel's hardware facilities. Although it is an old hotel, But the hardware is definitely worthy of the hotel brand. The room is very large and you can hardly feel the humidity. There is a dehumidifier in the room. The bed is very comfortable to sleep on. You can almost see the entire coastline and lighthouse of the Shenzhou Peninsula from the balcony, which makes people feel very comfortable. , there is a swimming pool downstairs, but it is not noisy. Even at night there is light, it is not completely dark... It is absolutely pleasant to sit on the balcony and watch the sunset! The whole hotel feels very comfortable and grand. The lobby faces the infinity pool and you can see the sea all the way. It's like being connected. It's full of resort style... The children's experience class is also endless. The instructor is very patient and professional. The people are nice and very professional. , the explanation is very clear, and she will guide the children's teaching individually. We stayed for four days, and the cleaning lady took the initiative to clean the room for us every day when she saw us. Although the room was a little messy because of the children, there were no complaints at all. It was okay to stay in a hotel. There is no parking fee, and as long as there is a place to park, it will be arranged in front of the hotel. In order to facilitate guests' travel, we will try not to let them park in the underground parking lot. When we finally left the hotel, our children wanted to play in the water in the hotel, so they could not check out on time. The housekeeper Xiao Wu specially arranged a late check-out for me. Knowing that we had a lot of luggage with our children, he also arranged for the concierge staff to come to the room to help us carry our luggage to the car, which saved a lot of trouble. Otherwise we have to manually transport it twice... This service is really nothing to say. Although I am a relatively demanding customer, it can be said that I can hardly find any faults. I will definitely stay in Shenzhou next time I have the opportunity to come to Wanning. The Peninsula Sheraton Resort is a must-stay for its service! ! !

It was only after I had a stomachache and a fever in the hotel that I was finally given a room with a sea view. You get what you pay for. I paid the price of a sea view room but was given a garden view room. I think this is cheating.
The service attitude is very good. Don't know which food is bad. After eating, I went to the hospital. I didn't shirk responsibility immediately after I got sick. Manager Yan from the concierge depar**ent really worked hard before and after seeing a doctor, checking up and dispensing medicines. I couldn’t even eat the sunset buffet for New Year’s Eve dinner that I originally planned. Manager Yan communicated very promptly. A light New Year's Eve dinner was arranged for us. Still very grateful! Although I suffered some minor sins, fortunately I took medicine in time and recovered quickly. I spent the next few days immersed in the beautiful scenery of the hotel.
The scenery of the hotel really needs to be praised. There are many check-in attractions on the beach. Even the Internet celebrity Corona Tavern is located in the hotel. My parents would get up early every day and go for a walk on the beach. Look at the sunrise. It’s also great for watching the sunset. Really beautiful. I think I will choose here again next time I come to Wanning. I am also very grateful to my butler Xiao Wu for the souvenir. They are all Hainan specialties. Very cool. A special experience doesn't make it an enjoyable trip. I also fell in love with Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula because of this hotel.

msg:The most satisfying thing about this trip to Wanning was staying at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Hotel. The hotel has an elegant environment, rich vegetation, incomparable sea views and soft white sandy beaches. The most touching thing is the warm and thoughtful service of the hotel. I must praise the guest butler Xiao Wu who is responsible for the docking. Before arriving at the hotel, he took the initiative to contact me to inform me of the specific location of the hotel and some of its activities. After checking in, he enthusiastically introduced the food and attractions around the hotel and promptly answered various questions. He answered all questions and responded in a timely manner. I was very happy to stay at the Sheraton Hotel, and I was lucky enough to meet Xiao Wu, the guest butler.

Guest relations Xiao Lin added WeChat in advance. If you need anything or make an appoin**ent, just use WeChat, which is very convenient. After staying for four nights, I reserved a whole day to stay in the hotel. I had breakfast in the hotel in the morning, went to the outdoor Bigfoot Kingdom, and then went to the children's swimming pool for surfing lessons. In the afternoon, I took a nap and dug in the sand at the beach. The whole day was very fulfilling. I also went swimming in the swimming pool a few days later. The scenery was great and there were not many people in the swimming pool. It was a great experience.
The Peninsula Hotel was very nervous during the Spring Festival. One day I ordered hotel room meals in advance on my way back from an outing, and I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. The pasta is huge! The two adults and two children didn’t finish the meal~ The hamburgers and fries were also very good~
All in all it was a good stay.

There are many parent-child activities for adults. On a sunny day the next day, we had a private area to learn to surf. In the T-shaped swimming pool opposite the lobby, my baby and I stood up successfully in the first session. The coach was very patient and taught very well. Originally, there were two separate sessions for adults and children. Since I was the only adult, I directly let the children learn with me. For those who like sports, the experience was very good and I saved hundreds of dollars.

msg:Sheraton Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula Hotel is a hotel full of experiences! If you are traveling with children, this must be a good choice for you! It has a beautiful private beach and comfortable rooms, where children can play as much as they want. It also provides Bigfoot Children's Paradise, parent-child outdoor projects (children's pool surfing, parent-child bubble party, children's tree climbing challenge, etc.) As well as leisure and entertainment activities such as the infinity pool, it is enough to keep the children entertained all day~
    At the restaurant of the Sheraton Hotel, I was deeply impressed by the enthusiastic smiles and warm-hearted service attitude of the service staff. Not only did I taste authentic and delicious local dishes here, but I also felt the meticulous restaurant service.
     I am very grateful to Manager Yan from the concierge depar**ent and Manager Lin from the restaurant depar**ent. They are both very professional and attentive. We are acquainted by fate, and we are grateful for meeting each other. In the quiet time, we drank sweet and fresh coconut juice and enjoyed the pleasant warm sunshine and the gentle breeze. Thank you very much for every warm moment you bring to our family!
      Every detail of Sheraton Sheraton Hotel Shenzhou Peninsula reflects your excellent service. This stay made me have an unforgettable vacation. Once again, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Sheraton Sheraton Hotel Shenzhou Peninsula and all the staff. I look forward to it. "Meet" again

msg:I have always liked staying in hotels under the Marriott Group, and this time I chose the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort in Wanning.
Environment: The room faces the sea. Facing the sea, spring flowers are blooming. The hotel has a high greening rate and a strong Chris**as a**osphere.
Hygiene: very clean
Facilities: Maybe the hotel is a bit old and there was a slight malfunction in the toilet. However, after reporting for repair, the engineer came quickly to repair it.
Service: I must give special thanks to Mr. Xiaoba, who is very patient, thoughtful and considerate. For example, my mother is 84 years old and has a toothache. I was also bitten by a mosquito and became allergic and swollen badly. For this reason, I placed an order for medicine at ** and contacted the customer service number. They were told that the hotel had regulations and could not help pick it up and deliver it to the hotel room. I thought it was really strange. There was also a small accident at the Lingshui Westin Hotel where I stayed last week. , I also bought medicine, and the service staff of the Westin Hotel delivered the medicine to my hotel room. Why, there is such a big difference between both being owned by the Marriott Group. When I was angry, the minibus called me and said that she would It's great to help me deliver to the room. The hotel is lucky to have people like Minibus. In fact, the service industry focuses on service, and every detail is revealed. Thank you Minibus for your service. I believe you are the best.

The hotel facilities may be a bit old in comparison, but the service staff have a very good attitude and will take the initiative to say hello. The housekeeper Lan Lan also took the initiative to send me a travel guide to the peninsula, which was very good. The breakfast options were quite complete, including Chinese and Western food. I will go there again if I have the opportunity in the future.

It's so quiet that you can be in a daze for a long time and enjoy it, especially the Internet celebrity Corona Bar. Sitting and listening to music under the sunset is even more enjoyable.

There is a commercial center and many restaurants within a 5-minute drive of the surrounding area. I spent a super chill two days in Wanning. Xiao Wu's considerate service, various warm tips, and answers to all questions added a new color to the hotel. I love Wanning so much!

Today's Wanning is relatively pristine, not over-developed, and there aren't too many people. Stayed at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Hotel. The hotel's service exceeded expectations and the room was upgraded. From the picture below, you can see two six-foot beds facing the beach. All the staff are very enthusiastic, and the housekeeper Xiao Wu is always considerate and reminds me to help solve various needs, check out quickly, etc. The service is in place and I am very satisfied.
Although the hotel's facilities are basic, as a resort hotel, location and service are very important. The thoughtful service completely enhances the stay experience and the price/performance ratio is very high.
Compared with the Grand Hyatt, it is too troublesome to take a shuttle bus back and forth.

msg:Shenzhou Peninsula is in an excellent location. The hotel environment is quiet amidst the hustle and bustle, and the scenery is stunning. ~ Xiao Lin, the hotel customer relations depar**ent, contacted the hotel in advance to inquire about the itinerary, prioritize the room arrangement, and enthusiastically answered all inquiries about the hotel and surrounding areas. It can be said that it is very worry-free. Experience it~ The room has been upgraded to a supreme sea view. Every day you can see the blue sky, white clouds, coconut trees, shadows of the swimming pool, beach, sunrise and sunset, and waves of the waves. People can really relax~ The super large T-shaped swimming pool is easy to swim in, clean, and the water depth is very reasonable. ~The Sheraton and the Four Points next door are interconnected, and the scenery can be shared, which is very convenient~The famous sunset bar is on the beach of the hotel, and it is great to take photos with the lights on at night~If you come to stay, be sure to sit for a while, and the wine is always there. The sound of the waves is still there~ The hotel has a very good view near the beach. There are swings, deck chairs, wave boards, buses, trains, carousels, bars, and campsites. You can definitely take pictures at the hotel until the camera runs out of battery~ If you have friends coming over When visiting Wanning, I would definitely recommend staying at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula~

The view is very good~ Whether it’s the hotel’s service, hygiene or check-in experience, it’s all very good. We brought our children here, which is very suitable for a family trip. We checked in to the Internet celebrity Corona Sunset, and the evening sunset was very pleasant. The hotel has its own It's great to take photos on the beach and look forward to staying there again next time.

Basically, she also helps me coordinate the room. It can be seen that the hotel rooms are a bit old but the maintenance is quite good. The exterior wall looks very old, but this is caused by the climate. , the breakfast content is as expected, the Hainanese noodles are more delicious than the takeout I ordered in Haikou, there are special dishes, and the dinner buffet has music and singing performances, the a**osphere is good, but there are too few types of seafood. At this price, you can eat it in the north. But Hainan, surrounded by sea, should have more and fresher seafood varieties.

The housekeeper Xiao Liu immediately changed our room and upgraded us to a family room with sea view. He also gave us a late check-out on the last day. The service was excellent. Every morning when I open the window, I can see the sea view, which is so comfortable.
The hotel facilities are very complete, including swimming pools, restaurants, and entertainment.
After leaving the room, I immediately went to the beach, swings, and carousels to take pictures and it was very photogenic. The famous Corona Sunset Bar is right in front of the hotel. You can enjoy a drink while enjoying the sea breeze on the beach. This is Wanning Bar.
The hotel breakfast is very good, rich in variety and tastes good.
By the way, the hotel room is large and the facilities are very clean. Crocs are also thoughtfully prepared for guests to wear while playing.
Will stay here again if I have the chance~

msg:🏝When I booked the Shenzhou Peninsula Hotel, I took a fancy to the T-shaped swimming pool and beach view of the Sheraton Resort Hotel. The Corona restaurant is on the beach, not far from the Internet celebrity lighthouse.

🏝The hotel housekeeper, Xiao Liu, will call one day in advance and add WeChat to remind me to check in. On the same day, I was given a lagoon pool garden side sea view room, thank you very much.

🏝The butler, Xiao Liu, introduced the hotel situation, restaurant location, and event gathering location on the day of check-in. He also gave timely responses when inquiring about hotel event projects, and the work efficiency was high.

🏝The aunt in the room depar**ent of the hotel is also very warm in service. The next day, she helped us replace clean towels and bath towels, replenish drinking water, and drink freely from the mini bar.

🏝Other staff can also greet politely, interact with the children friendly, and give candy back.

🏝The hotel is decorated in a standard Chinese style, the room is quite large, there is a terrace outside to dry clothes, the dehumidifier is always running, and the bathroom is separated from wet and dry with a bathtub. The sink and the door switch are designed with some details. The sink is easy to retain water, and the entrance and exit of the door are reversed. The resort shares a beach with the Four Points next door. There are two swimming pools, a lawn, a playground for children with big feet, a carousel, a small train, an online celebrity swing, a Corona bar, a sunset restaurant, and a Shaka surfing branch. Let you enjoy the fun of semi-custodial children's vacation without leaving the hotel.

🏝We spent two days and two nights playing in the seaside and swimming pool of the hotel, catching crabs, surfing, rock climbing, and making bubbles. It was really fun. It is recommended to stay at Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula. It would be even better if there is a shuttle to Haikou Meilan Airport!

Secondly, the adults also had a lot of fun. In addition to the Corona Sunset Bar, there are also many newly opened Internet celebrity coffee shops on the beach, which are so exciting. Going to Shenzhou Peninsula is really romantic and quiet compared to Riyue Bay. Personally, I feel that the commercial facilities are more mature than those at Le Meridien Westin, and there are many food stalls at night.
Recommend the snorkeling at sea item 298. It is super fun and lasts a long time. It takes a long time to drive to the island. Much more worthwhile than a ride on a motorboat.
Finally, I would like to thank Xiaobai for giving the baby Sheraton toys, sand digging tools, and welcome fruits.

There were also several families who went together. When housing was in short supply during the National Day holiday, we arranged to live together in advance. The service is also very good.
There are activities every day, such as bubble party, watermelon battle, etc. The most recommended is the surfing project. Children who have never been exposed to surfing should start by learning the movements.
Behind the hotel is the sea. The sand is very fine and comfortable to step on with bare feet. You can also make reservations for sailing or motorboating.
At night, people can drink, set off fireworks, catch the waves and dig in the sand on the beach. There are so many activities that you won’t be bored at all.
Because the hotel opened a little early, some facilities don't look so new, but it doesn't affect the use.

The second day after checking in was my husband's birthday, and the hotel gave me a cake, which was a great surprise. This birthday was particularly unforgettable. When checking out, the children had so much fun that they didn't want to leave. I will stay here again if I have the chance.

msg:The Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula is suitable for lying down🌟I just left Wanning now, and the first thing I wanted to do was give a real review of the hotel to give more people a real reference.
1. Real feelings: 1. Hotel: I stayed in a sea-view double room at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Hotel. It was said online that the appearance was not very new, but after checking in, I felt that the environment was quite good. The room was spacious and not too old. There were two kinds of breakfast. , there are staple foods, snacks, fruits, etc., as well as a free swimming pool, and there are so many entertainment activities on the beach carousel behind the hotel!
2. Service: It’s really good, especially Kyra (Xiao Kai) who served us this time. She was very attentive and helped us immediately with all our requests. We never checked in and asked about check-in time, hotel details, meal times, etc. There is very clear communication, and Miss Xiaokai can be contacted at any time even in the middle of the night. Although I have left Wanning, I still express my gratitude and recognition to Xiaokai’s service.
3. Weather: It didn’t rain during the day for two consecutive days. There might be a little rain in the morning and it will disappear soon, so you don’t have to worry about the weather.
4. Location: Behind the hotel is the beach, which gives you a sense of vacation. Corona Sunset Bar is a 2-minute walk away and is close to the lighthouse.

msg:Overall evaluation: Generally speaking, it is a hotel that is more suitable for family travel. There are many parent-child facilities in the hotel and the activities included are also family-friendly.
Location: The hotel is located on the Shenzhou Peninsula and is relatively close to the beach, so travel basically depends on Didi. There is a dining area 1km outside that can basically meet the needs. Breakfast is basically provided by the hotel.
Room: I booked a sea view room. There are two big trees and amu*****t facilities on the balcony blocking most of the view. This is not particularly satisfactory.
Facilities: Before coming here, I heard that the hotel is old and the settings are old. The overall feeling is not old, but the wifi is really not good. It is outrageous that there is no Wi-Fi in the bathtub in the room. There is also no Wi-Fi in most places in the lobby. The air conditioning is also bad. I was sweating after sitting in the lobby at night. I couldn't sit and chat properly (because there were children sleeping in the room, so the adults could only go out to hang out, and then...)
Service: Generally friendly. Mainly because I started cleaning too early. I went to have breakfast at around nine in the morning and was already doing cleaning when I came back. Anyway, this is the first time I have seen someone start cleaning so early.
Breakfast: 1/3 indoors and 2/3 outdoors. It is quite full in the off-season. I don’t know what will happen in the peak season. There are quite a lot of meals on offer, and Hou'an noodles are the most delicious. The problem is that the fruit is not sweet.
Two complimentary drinks at the sunset bar: First of all, the front desk staff did not explain that it is only available from 10 to 8 pm. Then there are only two non-alcoholic drinks to choose from, and you cannot choose twice. It feels like the store is reluctantly offering this kind of discount.

Normally, the hotel can check in at 3 pm, but when we arrived at noon, our children fell asleep in their arms. We reported to the minibus if there was a room available and we could check in early because the room we booked had not been cleaned yet. The minibus was very helpful in giving us an upgrade. We checked in early for the room type 😍 We also gave the children a sand bucket and snacks, and showed us to the room. It was so lovely ❤️The overall facilities of the hotel are very complete, and they are very friendly to babies of all ages ~ The room is on the first floor In the swimming pool and beach, the reef beach next to the beach is a great experience for children to catch crabs, and there is also a bubble party! It’s simply a paradise for children! The sunset on the beach in the evening was so beautiful, but I didn’t have time to take a photo. The surprise of this Wanning itinerary is the Sheraton 🤣Real-name recognition of the minibus, super gentle and awesome

msg:I was a bit unhappy with the reservation due to the price fluctuations and the swimming pool being repaired, but fortunately it was resolved smoothly.

First of all, my expectations for this hotel were not that high at first. But after checking in, it was beyond expectations. The housekeeper kept asking you if you needed anything. Also, all the staff in this hotel have a very good attitude and greet you with a smile.

The environment of the hotel is quite good. There are probably the most recreational facilities and coffee bars on the beach among the hotels in this area. The food at Corona Dusk Restaurant is really good.

The only small drawback is that the hotel is a bit old, almost ten years old. The room does have a bit of a musty smell, but the hygiene is really good. If you need anything, the staff will respond promptly.

The location is very convenient. There is a small commercial street one kilometer next to it.

If you come to this area for vacation, this hotel is really cost-effective and worth recommending.

msg:Generally speaking, the Sheraton is very cost-effective. In comparison, the facilities of the Westin Shimei Bay are older, the smell is more obvious, and there are basically no services. However, the scenery and maintenance of Shimei Bay are indeed better than those of Shenzhou Peninsula. The lobby of Westin is more grand. I guess all the money was used to decorate the lobby. Apart from the luxury, it is also 400 yuan more expensive than the Sheraton. I personally think that the Westin is not worth the price. I recommend staying at the Sheraton and spending an afternoon there. It only costs 20 yuan to take a taxi to Shimei Bay. You can enjoy all kinds of scenery without any restrictions.
Facilities: The facilities are OK, and the room is also equipped with a dehumidifier. However, the lockers and showers in the hotel swimming pool locker room are temporarily unavailable.
Environment: The sea view king bed room and the deluxe sea view king bed room are both very good. The area and layout are the same. Only the angle of looking at the sea is different.
Service: The housekeeper will add friends to inform you of the matters one day before check-in. After check-in, you can contact the housekeeper for any matters. I also asked kyra to upgrade to a deluxe sea view room. kyra always responded to my requests, especially in the middle of the night when I remembered to make an appoin**ent for surfing in the hotel pool a day in advance. I also successfully made an appoin**ent with Kyra.

msg:It was a worthwhile trip to check into the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort with the elderly and children. We took a taxi to the hotel, and there were waiters to help push our luggage when we arrived. Check-in was quick and convenient when traveling during off-peak hours. The service is provided by the butler Xiao Kai. From check-in to leaving the hotel, the service is warm, timely and thoughtful. He helped me change the room facing the sea. It was great. Both the elderly and children liked it. He reminded me of breakfast time, helped arrange activities for the children, and also gave me Provide help and meet all my needs. For service, I need Xiaokai. Stay in the family room, which is clean and tidy and will provide many things that children need. The first time I stayed at the Chinese restaurant, I had steamed seafood. The waiters helped steam the seafood. The meat was fresh and tender, and the taste was light and suitable for the elderly and children. The porridge and noodles in the Chinese restaurant were also suitable for northerners. Breakfast included Chinese and Western food, bread, sausages, and sweets. Donuts, steamed buns, noodles, and Hainan specialties are all available. The hotel's outdoor swimming pool is also very clean and the water temperature is suitable. A great resort hotel. I will choose Sheraton again.

msg:This is a family hotel! But I didn’t bring my Xiaoqi~
It has its own inner beach, and the decoration is very Thai style, with dark wood color ~ I didn’t know until I moved in that the missing girl had taken it here. Before I moved in, I just thought it was close to the Internet celebrity lighthouse, and it was really close~
The hotel has a swimming pool and parent-child entertainment experience, but my Xiaoqi didn’t come. I will definitely take her to play in the sand next year❤️
The hotel contacted the hotel in advance before check-in, and also added the WeChat account of Camy, the butler's minibus. They informed me of the itinerary in advance and allowed me to check in without any hindrance. I could check in as soon as I arrived. The lady next to me had to wait until three o'clock after cleaning before I could check in. Sincerely Like it~
The butler minibus is very enthusiastic and responsible. It doesn’t matter when I ask any questions, he will patiently help me answer them. My husband’s cell phone broke during the process and asked the front desk for paper clips. He also quickly helped us solve our needs. The rooms are very clean and the service staff are basically very friendly. Greet you warmly~The breakfast is very rich, combining Chinese and Western~
Great experience after staying for three days❤️

msg:Highly recommend this hotel. The facilities are very complete. After staying in the hotel for 3 days, there are still many items that I have not experienced. I feel like I haven’t visited any attractions, but I feel like I’ve experienced a lot, including ATVs, bubble parties, children’s playgrounds, mini trains, sunset bars, celebrity swings, and camping barbecues. The breakfast is very rich and delicious, and the rice boy at home eats a lot every day. Several restaurants in the hotel are very delicious, and you can eat all you want for 200 per person. Except for eating in the commercial street one night, the rest were settled in the hotel. Unfortunately, there are many set meals that I have not tasted. The parent-child details are very good and really touching. The butler's minibus has prepared auxiliary toilets and sand digging tools in advance. The furniture is also covered with anti-collision *****s, and guardrails are installed on both sides of the bed, which are more carefully made than those at home. The hotel's service awareness is also very good. The butler's minibus is basically responsive to all requests. Before leaving, the hotel also gave us many bottles of water for us to drink on the way. This accommodation experience is really great. I really hope to stay a few more days next time. The Green Image photos sent by the hotel also exceeded expectations, and the results were very good. It was a worthwhile trip. The hotel's spa environment is also super beautiful. If I must make some comments, I hope the hair dryer can be replaced by a Dyson one. The current hair dryer is not very good and makes my hair very frizzy.

msg:Together with the Four Points next to it, it forms a resort area, and the two hotels are connected. In terms of style, Four Points is simple European and Sheraton is Southeast Asian, and the room area of ​​Sheraton is larger than Four Points.

💂: The guest service union will call to inquire about the arrival time and check-in preferences the night before check-in, and will arrange the room in advance. There will be suggestions to add the official WeChat to communicate at any time in case of any situation.
There are no problems with room service. If you need it, call and it will be delivered in a short time.
❗: Sheraton is divided into two main rooms in the east and west wings. The east side of the east wing faces the quiet west side facing the swimming pool, and the east side of the west wing faces the swimming pool and the west side faces the Four Points swimming pool. Simply put, if you like quiet, choose the east side of the east wing. You can communicate in advance according to your preferences.

🍴: I went to two restaurants, Feast and Sunset. Feast is a Western restaurant. There is nothing to say about the service and taste. Sunset is to complain. The price of two large and one small hotels is 920 yuan at the store and 820 yuan in the hotel mall. The richness of the food is average. It can only be said that the normal buffet has basically everything, but there are no special dishes. The most incomprehensible thing is that the buffet of the star-rated hotel will be out of supply during business hours. The salmon will be intermittently out of supply. The coconut milk is gone around 20:30, and there is no fried rice. It is the kind of out of supply that will not be replenished. In summary, 410 yuan out of 820 yuan is the value of the food itself, and the rest is the service fee and dining environment. It is difficult to match the positioning of Sheraton in Wanning.

👶: There are many parent-child projects. Children can stay in the hotel completely. They can swim (the swimming pool of Four Points is more suitable for children), play ball and read books in the activity center, and there is a special game room. The hotel has free parent-child activities, such as rock climbing and pool surfing. The feeling of peak season is perfunctory. Each person has one chance to climb the rock, and each person has two experiences of pool surfing. It is lonely just when the excitement starts. The children said that they don’t want to participate in this activity next time. The most fun thing is the bubble pool party. ❗ Pool surfing starts at 9:20 every day. Gather at the fitness center 10 minutes in advance. You need to register and make an appointment the day before. ❗❗Rock climbing starts at 15:20 every day. Please gather at the health center 10 minutes in advance. You need to register and make an appointment the day before. ❗❗❗: The pool bubble party starts at 18:00 every day. It is located at the Four Points swimming pool. You can go there by yourself without making an appointment.

🛒: The hotel is 20 minutes away from Wangfujing Duty Free by car. The business hours are closed at 21:00 regardless of weekdays or weekends.

👾: It takes 10 minutes by taxi from Shenzhou Town. Surf shops, eMule rentals, meals, and small supermarkets are all very convenient.

☀: The Internet celebrity sunset bar is really artistic at sunset, but it is annoying that there are always people there making shapes and taking pictures. I didn't go for a drink.

❗: The most unpleasant thing about Sister Li is that the clarity of TV programs can be so blurry. It would be better to put on a TV set from the 1990s. The check-in coincided with the Women's World Cup and the Swimming Championships, and the viewing effect was really terrible.

The main advantages are - coupons are more reasonable, such as rock climbing, surfing, and non-alcoholic cocktails, it is more suitable for a family with a young boy like us than travel photography; a housekeeper was also arranged, but the housekeeper showed up anyway and took care of it Di Yiyi introduced and explained a lot of things, including why the hotel has to turn on the air conditioner all the time, how to dry the clothes, and such practical details as water can be ordered at any time. I feel that this hotel is really crowded with people, and everyone has accumulated that kind of store experience. ;The swimming pool is big, and the structure is easy to find. This kind of structure belongs to throwing a 10-year-old child in a place and asking him to find it by himself; the paddle board 68 yuan an hour is too suitable for my child, so that I The hotel was booked for the private beach, but we didn't go to the beach...; the location of the beach buffet is perfect. It belongs to the children who are exhausted after swimming. I saw big ribs and smelled barbecue. My plan to go out for seafood for dinner was wasted, anyway. The whole hotel reveals an amazing understanding of the ways of our parent-child family. It not only feels that it is really good to liberate the parents, but also has a vague sense of horror that the mediocrity of the parents has been seen through (^_^;). And there are a lot of guests in the north of the hotel! We northerners are really boring. The service is good, anyway, it's very positive, say hello, throw a lifebuoy, watch a child or something, it's a kind of family personality with no airs. The big E people in the big E hotel; they still have experience in dealing with musty smell.
Ok, now for the disadvantages——
The hanging picture is too ugly, and so is the dirty clothes frame. If you change it a little bit, you can see that the weight and quality of your table have retained the old-school hotel style. The furniture in those days was still very durable. This hanging picture can be much better if you change it a little; The TV is too small to be able to cast the screen, which is really not parent-child; in fact, the free non-alcoholic cocktails are really bad, so strange; last, the most important point is! The desk lamp by my bedside...in the middle of the night...it turned on by itself...it woke me up vividly...but I climbed down and turned it off for a long time, but it couldn't be turned off. This is nothing at all, but the most terrible thing is that I will come to Wanning in May, right here at Emmy! One night at 3pm all the lights including the TV were on. They are all in Wanning! Because it was the second time, I was really scared. It’s just that Amy was on that time, and you felt that there was a problem with the OK circuit. This time, only one side of the bedside table lamp on my side was on, and I felt a little nervous. The subtext became that Wanning was trying to tell me something... and then it It’s the full moon again... And then I was really scared... I got up a little late in the morning, and then I found that there was still a queue for breakfast... I finally got to drink coffee, and then the waiter kept rushing to collect the plates, so I went to get them After ordering some fruit, the waiter took away a cup of coffee that I didn't drink at all... What a waste...
Ask the housekeeper for an explanation from the engineering depar**ent, because there is really no scientific explanation of why on the Internet. At four o'clock in the afternoon, I told me that it was too hot to be in contact with. Hey, I don't know what to say when I write this. The experience is a bit too unique, I still don't want to reminisce... I hope that the lights of Wanning will not be turned on in the middle of the night!

The guy at the front desk (the one on the far left counter) checked in very quickly, and he also asked for our opinions on the floor we were staying in. When the child wanted to drink water, he immediately asked the waiter to get a paper cup. The housekeeper, Xiao Liu, immediately added WeChat after we checked in. While leading the way, he briefly introduced several restaurants and children's activities in the hotel. I sent a WeChat message to ask for children's toiletries. When we came back after dinner, the supplies were neatly placed in the room, and the work efficiency was faster than Westin! The fly in the oin**ent is that there is too much rubbish on the beach of the hotel, and the travel photography process as a gift is also perfunctory. Only two or three photos can be selected from more than 20 photos, which is not as good as Westin's travel photography. I hope the hotel can improve in these aspects to improve.

Wherever you walk, the waiter will take the initiative to say hello, but the check-in efficiency is really low. I waited for a long time and waited for it. Next, there is a handsome young man surnamed Yang at the front desk, with a bright smile and high efficiency. My door card was degaussed to register, and he thoughtfully asked if I wanted to check other cards. Thanks to the housekeeper, Xiao Wu, for his service these days. After checking in, he added WeChat and told us all kinds of precautions. Seeing that we have a baby, he also gave us a sand digging tool. Nice~ For those who came all the way to dig For us, it's so friendly. If you need any inquiries, you will reply and deal with them in a timely manner. It's comfortable~ The breakfast area is not big, there are not many types, and it's no problem to eat. I like the freshly cooked Hou'an noodles. Others We settled our meals at various restaurants on Binhai Boulevard. On the way here by car, the driver said that meals are basically available nearby. The Sheraton is the easternmost point in the peninsula bay, and the lighthouse is at the westernmost end. There are many Beach motorcycles will ask if they want to go to the lighthouse. Binhai Avenue has also built a coconut grove path leading directly to the lighthouse, with a total length of 2000m. There are many places where electric cars can be rented. If a family of three, it is very convenient to rent a two-wheel or three-wheel electric transportation. , um... It's far away. Back to the hotel, in order to take care of the elderly and children, I chose a family suite that can accommodate 4 people. Although it has two bathrooms, only one can take a shower. This room type is basically above the hotel lobby. At that time Thinking, even if there are other rooms on both sides extending to the coast, the view will be limited, but at least it is front-facing. When I checked in, I asked specifically if I could see the sea, and the answer was yes, but I was thinking too much. Give me a score The one is 401 in the West Wing, which is the room at the west end of the lobby. Looking over the two balconies, there are coconut trees everywhere... Visually measure the height of the trees, and you should be able to see the sea on the 6th floor. Let's take a look at the future babies. Ha, the tree next door is a little shorter than ours, so it’s probably not much better. As for the side of the east wing, I don’t know much about it. It’s better not to write about the sea view. I’m not happy about it! I didn’t move in until after 5 o’clock. When I checked in, I was still waiting for the room after 4 o’clock. The baby was clamoring to go to the beach. Forget it, let’s go to the beach to see the sea view. The sea is so clear , The sea view is really good, there are not many people, just let go and throw away your troubles ~ By the way, I am very happy that there is a clothes hanger in the house. I have to wash clothes several times a day. This clothes hanger solves a big problem, especially this one The type of room, the sun doesn’t shine too much, only when the sun shines in the west, it will shine for a while

It is not too beautiful to watch the sunset and the sea breeze! Will continue to choose next time!

msg:Healed by the scenery of the Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula Sheraton!

Before coming here, I was planted by Yi Mengling, Corona Sunset, but after I came, I found that it really exceeded expectations!

First of all, the service attitude of the entire hotel is very good. Marriott's service attitude training is quite in place. From the front desk to the cleaning lady, they all make people feel at home~ I would like to praise my housekeeper Kyra here. I heard that I brought my parents here After passing 520, I also specially helped to upgrade the room with a good view, and gave super delicious mango mousse as a gift! 😖Parents are so touched! Let me specifically thank the housekeeper!

In terms of the environment, I still have a point. The sand on the beach is very fine, and the coastline of Sheraton is also very wide. It takes about an hour to walk from the beginning to the end. The sea is not blue, but it is also quite clean.

There are basic facilities in the hotel, especially parent-child programs! What children rock climbing, bubble bath and so on, especially suitable for bringing a baby!
In addition, there are also some activities and places suitable for young people, such as Corona Sunset Bar, Dining Bar, Seaside Surf Shop, Buffet Dinner, etc. There will be activities suitable for young people from morning to night, so you don’t have to worry about bringing your parents I don't have anything to play with.

I was particularly impressed by the Hou'an powder at the hotel's buffet breakfast! ! ! Strong push! It's so delicious, go eat it! (no photo taken)

The housekeeper, Xiao Wu, contacted me the day before to ask about my situation, and was very enthusiastic. The room was almost full that day, and we waited for a while to check in. It is understandable that there are too many people. The environment of the hotel is very good, it was raining heavily that day, so it was not hot outside. It was very comfortable to go out for a walk when the rain stopped in the evening.
The hotel's beach is so good, fine and free of impurities, and the sea water is clear. The swimming pool is also very bad.
The decoration of the room is a little bit old, mainly because there are too few sockets and the lights are a bit dim, but other things are very good.
In addition, the housekeeper, Xiao Wu, is very enthusiastic, works well, and has a very pleasant stay.

msg:Taking the baby and seventy-year-old mother to Wanning for vacation before the peak of summer vacation, the Sheraton is the first choice in Shenzhou Peninsula. I thought three days would be enough, but I didn't expect it to be far from enough.
Facilities: Although the hotel is old, the quality of the hardware is sufficient, the style is large enough, and the room is large enough. Especially for the climate in Hainan, the dehumidifier equipped in the room is really useful.
Environment: The hotel's outdoor swimming pool is very large, and those with babies can go to the children's pool at the Four Points by Sheraton next door. There are many kinds of children's amu*****t facilities, and if time is limited, there is no time to play them all. The children's products in the room are very thoughtful, from footstools, toiletries, beach shoes and children's bathrobes.
Hygiene: Western restaurants, Chinese restaurants, rooms and public areas are very clean and tidy.
Service: This is the most worth mentioning. Unexpectedly, the hotel housekeeper, Xiao Liu, had already contacted us on WeChat in advance and asked about the approximate arrival time so that we could prepare in advance. At first I thought it was just a process, but I didn’t expect Xiao Liu to be very attentive. After check-in, he sent us to the room and explained the hotel facilities, meal times, etc. along the way. He really did everything in detail, and even made me have any questions. Contact him anytime. On the second day of my stay, there was an accident. On the way back to the lighthouse, I lost my phone on the beach. After I sent Xiao Liu a message about the lost phone, I immediately rushed over to help me find it together. Thank God, Sheraton is definitely my blessed place. I lost my mobile phone for 4 hours on the beach and finally got it back. I will omit 500 words for this process. I want to thank Xiao Liu again!
I have written a lot, and finally I will summarize:
Although the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula is a resort hotel, it is comparable to clubmed in all aspects, but the price is much more friendly than clubmed. It is very suitable for parents and children. The hotel has a lot of activities arranged. As long as there is enough time, children will definitely enjoy it. The legendary trip Wanning lay flat, I don't think you can lie down if you bring your children. In addition, the hotel's beach is very beautiful, beautiful...

I live in a family suite room, the decoration is quite satisfactory, but the view from the balcony is great It’s also very convenient, but I think the lawn self-service is mainly for the a**osphere. Don’t place too much hope on the food. The beach here is great, quieter and wider than Sanya’s, but there are no supporting facilities in Sanya, and there are no things for mature children to play. There are plenty of hotels in Sanya. My children are more than three years old and they are very happy to play.

Different from other hotels, there are butlers. The housekeeper arranged is Xiao Liu. It's very powerful. First of all, I explained the hotel as a whole, and explained that I can call them for anything. Sure enough, whether it is changing rooms, helping to pick up takeaways or other services are very considerate. Maybe other services are average, but the butler is very good. Especially when comparing Le Méridien on the second day, the same staff took the room to check in, the contrast was obvious. Xiao Liu praised!
The rest of the hotels are shown in the picture below. beautiful!
Cozy and cozy.

Special thanks to the housekeeper Xiao Liu, who is very considerate and provides excellent service. Checking in coincided with a music festival on the beach of the hotel, and Xiao Liu gave us tickets for the music festival. In the middle of the night, I accidentally scratched the skin on my foot. After contacting Xiao Liu, he sent us a band-aid very quickly.
I am very satisfied with this stay, highly praised, and will come here often in the future.

msg:After May 1st, I took a trip to Hainan while the crowds were less. I stayed at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort Hotel for one night during my two days in Wanning. Generally speaking, although the facilities are old, the services are online and there are many supporting activities. In terms of cost performance, it is worth living.

Check-in experience
The day before the check-in, the housekeeper of the guest service called in advance to communicate the check-in time and added contact information. There was a queue when checking in, but the doorman service was always online, and professionalism could be seen from CI to CO. Contact the housekeeper in advance to upgrade the room to a parent-child twin room. The double bed of 2 meters and 1.5 is very comfortable to live in. We also prepared welcome fruit in the room in advance, but we didn't take the initiative to turn down the bed. The spare parts are Sheraton's own brand, and they are in large bottles.

Butler service
Sheraton's butler service is worthy of praise. The butler, Xiao Liu, has been in touch with him since he checked in, helping to upgrade the room, deliver medicine, and take the initiative to inform the breakfast and meal times... Generally speaking, it is worthy of praise, but the slight flaw is that it lacks a little initiative. However, it is negligible compared to the price.

FOOD
Breakfast is served on 1F, and there is an outdoor area, but the overall restaurant is small and the food is not rich enough. There are Hainan specialties such as Qingbuliang, noodles, etc., but the taste is so-so.
Checked in Corona and the CASA of the Four Points Hotel next door, both are on the beach of the hotel, you can walk along the same road, both are recommended. Take photos and post pictures, dishes are online, very chill

at last
It’s already too much to experience such a service at a price of less than 1K, but because it’s 🐬booking + off-season check-in, it may not be very informative, and you can judge by yourself after checking in~~

There are a lot of activities, whether it is parent-child or adult activities, they are well arranged, and the gold content is very high. My daughter especially likes jungle tree climbing and surfing
There are several swimming pools in the hotel. The large swimming pool in the middle is big enough for paddle boarding, and the depth of the other small swimming pool is also very suitable for children.
The service of the butler is also very good. When we checked in, there was a dispute about the big bed and twin beds. The butler was very patient to help us arrange it, and he was always eager to help us provide various services in the next few days after we checked in.
The slight disadvantage of the hotel is that there is no air-conditioning in the lobby. When we checked in, there was a rush hour, and we were almost soaked after waiting for half an hour. In addition, the breakfast room area is also very small, so we need to wait for a seat

Let’s talk about the hardware first. The overall design is a classic five-star hotel resort style: a**ospheric, comfortable, and all kinds of facilities are fully functional. The beach scenery is good and the view is good. You can see the lighthouse on the peninsula from a distance. It is not too noisy and not too quiet. It is very suitable for the needs of parent-child families.
The key point is to talk about the software. I arranged a special butler service as soon as I checked in at the hotel, which is very considerate. The person who arranged for me was Xiao Liu, the guest relations manager. It was this butler who made me deeply feel the output of the humanistic value of the Sheraton brand during this trip. I would like to express my sincere thanks to him again! Our trip was a parent-child trip. On the third day after staying in the hotel, the child fell down while playing in Shimei Bay and broke a large piece of his knee. At that time, he had no experience and did not deal with it in time. Later, he found that the wound had festered and festered. Professional debridement is urgently needed. It was raining heavily in Wanning that night. Feeling helpless and uneasy, I contacted Xiao Liu to ask if we could arrange for us to go to an urgent medical institution for trea**ent. After receiving the inquiry, Xiao Liu was anxious about the urgent needs of customers. He was about to leave work and drove the car himself. Sent us to the hospital to deal with the child in time, which made people feel warm and moved! Really feel the value of the brand to customers! Completely turned me into a fan of the brand. I think that no matter where I go for vacation in the future, Sheraton will be my first choice. If I come to Mannings again, it will be the only choice for our family!
Thank you Xiao Liu, and thank you Sheraton Hotel for the wonderful memories we left for this parent-child vacation. See you next time! 🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏

Eat a buffet by the sea and watch the sunset while eating. The butler thoughtfully recommended the hotel's dining and entertainment, as well as surrounding attractions. And he answered our questions anytime and anywhere during the stay, which made us feel the service of Sheraton. The hotel environment is very good, with a private beach. The housekeeper will also contact you in advance about whether it is better to issue an invoice in advance for tomorrow's refund, parking and other issues. There is a small problem that there are too few sockets in the room. There is only one at the head of the bed and none on the other side, making it inconvenient to charge.

I hope you don't pay too much attention to the comments, the service of this brand is definitely very good. Each service staff serves with a smile and tries to meet customer requirements. For example, the concierge brother's battery car picks up and drops off at the gate. There are many people visiting now, so it is normal to have a queue for breakfast. The butler Xiao Wu helped coordinate the time for travel photography. The hotel also has Many children play, beach bubble party activities, surfing and so on. Xiao Wu answers all questions and is always online. Come back next time when you are free.

But the beach in front of the hotel is long and delicate, the sand is very fine and comfortable, better than that in Shimei Bay, and there are many dining spots near the hotel~ The sunset bar is very beautiful, and it is very comfortable to sit at sunset until the evening.

There are also a lot of parent-child activities, but there are more people, and there is a lot of queuing time for each item.

Meals: A decent breakfast, but the view is good. The set lunch at the hotel is full, but it is also a decent Chinese meal.
Others: In addition, if you want to take pictures, it is really a good place. If the price is good, it is very suitable to stock up on coupons.

Service: If you drop off the day before check-in, you can contact to reserve a room and arrange butler service, which is very considerate.

The hotel environment is good, and the overall service is also good. The important thing is that it is very close to the scenic spots and convenient for travel. The hotel's private beach is even better. Needless to say, you can reach the beach in minutes. My favorite is the hotel's parent-child activities. I play all day from morning to night, and let the children experience a lot of things they haven't played before. It's super fun. I will still choose this place next time~

You can watch the sea, listen to the sound of waves and watch the sunset while sitting on the balcony. There is a sunset bar downstairs and The net-famous seaside swing has bubbles every day🫧, and there is a Casa Corona restaurant next to it, which is also delicious😋. There is a T-shaped swimming pool in the hotel where you can swim and play paddle boards. This time I took my 7-month-old baby with me. I think there is also a suitable swimming ring that can be rented, which is very cheap at 20 yuan an hour. The hotel’s recreation center has swimsuits 🩱 at a very reasonable price (158 yuan a piece). There is also a carousel downstairs. You can hear singing and playing in the hotel from the balcony. The Internet celebrity lighthouse is at the end of the hotel beach 🏖️, you can see it from the hotel balcony. The most important thing is to have a hotel butler. Our hotel butler, Xiaokai, has a great service. It can be said that whenever we contact her, she will solve the problem for us as soon as possible. Thank you very much for giving us this great experience! If you come to Wanning next time, you must stay at the Sheraton Resort

msg:Summary: Really good!
I have been to Wanning many times, but I have always lived in Shimei Bay. This is the first time in the Shenzhou Peninsula. The main reason is that I brought my parents to play, and I still want to live in a place with convenient surrounding facilities. Although it has been here for a long time, the maintenance of the facilities is still in place. Although I also feel that there are not enough sockets in the room and the Wi-Fi is not very good, it is still ok for the parents who do not have high demand for these services. What I want to mention is that due to the flight delay, it was already midnight when I arrived at the hotel, and I was very tired. The front desk didn't say anything when I checked in, but I silently upgraded the room type, and I was very pleasantly surprised after entering the room. The breakfast is quite satisfactory, and I feel that there are not so many people. After all, there is no need to queue up. I stayed for four days, and the room service was also very timely. Requests for pillows and purified water were delivered quickly. Very cost-effective, parents are very satisfied!

The hotel's buffet breakfast is quite satisfactory, and the Hou'an powder is very delicious. You must try it~ The set lunch is enough for two people, and the taste is good, so the level of their Chinese restaurant should be okay~ If you bring your baby, There are quite a lot of projects in the hotel, such as magma board climbing, etc. There are also a lot of children who come to participate, and it is not boring to stay at the hotel without going out~ Watching the sunset of the Shenzhou Peninsula in the hotel is absolutely perfect~ Come to Wanning for a walk , less people and beautiful scenery, it's good

There are many places for children to play, there are playgrounds indoors and outdoors, and there is a carousel on the beach

In-room dining is also delicious and affordable! Generally, other hotels may order a meal for 80-90+, but he is more than 40! Strongly recommend the beef noodles with Baoluo powder, it is too fragrant

The beach is really good. The sand is very soft and not sticky. Bialong Bay is much better. When surfing, I feel that the sea water is very clear and there are no such sundries and impurities. It is very suitable for sea sports! There are also many entertainment items at sea!

The balcony of the room is also quite large. It is very comfortable and cool to sit and enjoy the sea breeze

The service staff communicated well with smiles and patience! (PS: I checked in very late on the day of check-in. I didn’t expect to be warmly received by Xiao Yan in the lobby. The service was super in place. After a few days, I saw him often shuttling in the hotel and was always very enthusiastic! Praise !)

In general, many five-star hotels in Bialong Bay are more friendly and affordable, but the experience and service are even better! Like it!

The best thing about this hotel is that the water pressure in the room is very good, the bathing is very enjoyable, and the sewer is also very good👍.

Although the hotel carefully disinfected the doorknobs, room switches, buttons, etc., I still cleaned the room myself Disinfect and tidy up inside and out to be practical. After playing outside for a few hours, the smell of smoke still seems to be very strong.

The famous T-shaped swimming pool and the infinity swimming pool of the Four Points next to it are beautiful for taking pictures and swimming. Maybe this is the reason why we stay at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula for a few days every time we go to Hainan. recommend!

msg:I have stayed in many hotels in Hainan, but this time I stayed at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort, which not only brought me surprises, but also gave me an excellent staying experience. First of all, the housekeeper, Xiao Wu, from the moment we checked into the hotel, not only dragged our luggage to the room, but also kept reminding us about the precautions and asking for help during the stay, and promptly responded and solved any problems. , meticulous care and service until we left the hotel. In addition, the hotel's facilities and landscape are also very good, and the film production rate is extremely high. I took a lot of beautiful photos during my stay.

Facilities: Old, with small black bugs, I had a small rash on my body that night, and a lot of small red spots on my legs the next day. I went to the hospital after returning and was told that it was caused by insect bites, which was extremely itchy
Service: I wanted to stay for another night with my elderly parents the next day, but I couldn't make an appointment for the group purchase on **. There were obviously rooms available, and it didn't work to ask the housekeeper to apply, but fortunately I was given a delayed check-out.

msg:Environment: Located on the Shenzhou Peninsula, the surrounding area is relatively convenient. Close to the hotel, you can feel the strong American resort style.

Facilities: The lobby is amazing! As far as the eye can see is the sea. The color scheme of the garden is bright and lively, setting off the good mood of the holiday.

Service: Very professional, even check-in during peak hours was done efficiently.

Talk about extra points 🌟
1/ The overall environment is very good, suitable for family vacations, and there are many places to take pictures and check in
2/ The room area is large, and the design movement is reasonable.
3/ Watching the sunset on the beach is amazing! Strong push
4/ The beach is very delicate, much more delicate than Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay
5/ The T-shaped swimming pool is heated! In the low season, it is cold during the day and at night, but the water in the swimming pool is warm at night. Very friendly.

Let's talk about the flaws that don't hide the beauty🔻
1/ The signal in this area is a mystery, and the wifi and 5G signals have to be switched at any time, even the signal strength in different locations in the bathroom is not the same (this is not a problem of the hotel)
2/ The choice of breakfast can be slightly more, and there are a little more high-sugar and high-calorie foods. Everyone must follow the advice and avoid dining during peak hours to avoid queuing.
3/ There are not many parking spaces in the underground garage. If the weather is good, you can park on the road.

BTW, thanks to the little butler Grace for the follow-up service throughout the whole process, it's hard work

The sand at Sheraton Wanning is really invincible, fine and soft, and the waves are much smaller than Haitang Bay in Sanya. It is very comfortable to step on. Thanks to the butler, Ms. Grace, who added WeChat one day in advance to understand our situation, and upgraded me when I checked in. I got a sea view room ~ helped us solve many problems in a timely manner ~ big praise! The facilities of the Sheraton Hotel are also quite good, which is what an old hotel should look like. There are singers in the restaurant (Western food, Chinese food) every night, which is very good! The four-person set meal in the Chinese restaurant is also delicious! The Hoan Noodles at the breakfast buffet are simply delicious! Must eat every day!
In short, it is right to choose Sheraton when you come to Mannings!

You can see the sunset from the room on the first evening. Go down to the beach. The beach is very wide. There is also a place for afternoon tea and barbecue by the sea. There are bars singing, and the holiday a**osphere is full. Parent-child activities are also very popular, children surfing and rock climbing, the swimming pool is in a good location, overlooking the sea. It's just that there are too many cars in the hotel park, which is a little crowded, and there are situations where you can't miss the car and can only reverse the car and come back.

Trojan horses and small trains are all holy places for production. There was still a sea of foam on the day we arrived. The children were crazy about playing.

Advantages. Disadvantages and suggestions
Advantage 1 The beach of the hotel is good, and the environment is not bad
        2 The service staff is very enthusiastic. When I came here, there was no double bed room on Ctrip. I booked a twin room. The staff directly upgraded the sea view double bed room
        3 Bedding is very silky!
Disadvantage 1 The variety of breakfast is too single, too many people are like fighting a war, and the experience is extremely poor. It is recommended to increase the variety of breakfast and make it richer
        2 The sound insulation of the hotel is a bit poor. There is a single door next to the TV. It is recommended to renovate the double doors and add sound insulation. It is best to leave a hollow space in the middle so that the sound insulation effect will be better. Mainly sleep late at night and wake up in the morning by the crying and talking of the children in the next room! There is a recording. no upload
        3 facilities are a bit outdated

msg:I went to Wanning for two days during the Spring Festival. I chose this hotel because there are 4 people in the room. The price/performance ratio is relatively high compared to the nearby Grand Hyatt and Four Points hotels. I drove from Sanya for about 2 hours in the morning. I first went to Xinglong Tropical Botanical Garden to play, and then drove 40 minutes to the Shenzhou Peninsula. I felt good after checking in. The biggest advantage is that the family room on the first floor has two 2-meter-large beds, which can sleep 4 adults. There is a small courtyard facing the sea, and the beach is close at hand. The temperature in the morning is 20 degrees, and you can relax physically and mentally on the sun lounger in the sun. The hotel is not far from the real estate developed by Zhonghai and the commercial town. It is very convenient for eating and shopping. The hotel has surfing training classes, there are three-wheeled motorcycles on the beach, and motorboats on the sea. Hotel check-in, service, etc. are good. The disadvantages are that the design of the parking lot is insufficient. During the Spring Festival, there are overcrowded cars. The road leading to the hotel is full of cars.

There is also the caring service of the hotel housekeeper Xiao Wuchao, who also gave the children small gifts.

The scenery is released in minutes. The most user-friendly thing is Marriott's long-term service. The pre-call before booking check-in can still guarantee the service level is online during the festival. Although there are some small episodes in the middle, the hotel manager Yan handles it in a timely and appropriate way. It can be said that it is perfect It explains the proper management of hotels under the Marriott Group. Generally speaking, it is really suitable for couples and families.

When I checked in, I asked more about whether I could upgrade. The front desk of the hotel saw that the occupancy rate was okay and arranged it. It was a sea view room on the highest floor, which was really pleasantly surprised.
Including the minibar in the room, which itself is charged, I asked the housekeeper cat, and the minibar was delivered to us directly.
Although the entire hotel is relatively old, it is also clean. It is just facing the sea, near the beach. There are beach motorcycles on the beach. You can drive directly to the lighthouse in the distance. I really like it and it is also a good experience.
There is also the Corona bar on the beach, which is really delicious, but the price is a little expensive, but the vacation itself is a comfortable one, very comfortable

The breakfast is relatively ordinary, lackluster, not as good as expected.
The package includes travel photography, surfing, paddle board activities, etc., all of which are particularly interesting.
Overall a good experience.

They were still in Haikou. The hotel's exclusive butler, Xiao Wu, called and added WeChat. The hotel's environment and service are great! Xiao Wu also took the initiative to upgrade our room and gave a small gift before leaving! Very warm! When I come to Wanning in the future, I will definitely choose Sheraton Resort Hotel!

As soon as I pushed it away, a big musty smell hit me. I feel relieved The house is gone. The facilities in the room are very old. It can’t be seen that it is a five-star hotel. The housekeeper is basically just a decoration. The needs mentioned before check-in have not been implemented at all. After check-in, I can’t send messages. I can only call I just picked it up, but my friend didn't answer the phone calls. Compared with the Westin, it's too bad, and there's very little breakfast buffet. It can only be said that the beach is bigger than the Westin, the others are very average, and I will not stay at the Sheraton in the future, the facilities are too old

Simply renew for another night. The next day I saw the most beautiful sunset 🌄 with rainbow 🌈 moon and sunset 🌇 in a sky at the same time. There is an Internet celebrity bar on the beach. You can have a drink at any time, and it is very beautiful to take pictures on the beach. I was very surprised at the sunset restaurant on the second night. The barbecue and beer cold drinks were very rich and tasted good. The scenery was really unforgettable! A very surprising experience. Don't order the coconut chicken hot pot set at the restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. Compared with other local restaurants, it is not affordable and the quantity is too small. The gym is shared with the hotel next door, which may be the only fly in the oin**ent.

msg:The same Marriott hotel, although the grade positioning is slightly different, but the actual maintenance of the overall facilities is really not a little bit worse than St. Regis. The opening time of the two hotels is the same, and the rooms and public areas of the Sheraton Hotel are shockingly dirty~ You guys really have the courage to charge this price during the peak season, and everyone treats tourists like a big quarrel~ There is no room for breakfast, it's all up to you try to find. Outdoor swimming is not very clean. The beach is so dirty that you can't get your feet off it. There are all kinds of garbage and cigarette butts everywhere, and it feels completely unmaintained. I don't know what kind of material is used for the bed quilt cover in the room, which makes people uncomfortable and unable to sleep. Even ordinary all-season beds would not use such a strange quilt cover. I don't usually have the habit of deliberately criticizing hotels, and I can't help but comment when I'm so close. The attached picture shows the changing room next to the hotel's T-shaped swimming pool. I really thought it was a public toilet at one time, but it was so dirty that I couldn't walk my feet, and it was completely unmaintained. You can't feel the disgusting state inside the locker room unless you see it with your own eyes. I don't bury the hard work of the hotel staff, but the overall state of maintenance and management of the hotel is really disappointing.

The hotel has not yet checked in, but Xiao Wu, the enthusiastic housekeeper, was already on call, and gave a lot of help throughout the process. I would like to give it a thumbs up!
The most beautiful sea view in the lobby and the seaside bar are the locations for Internet celebrities.
Children's play facilities in the swimming pool have to be charged separately, which is inhumane!
The waves in this area are small and suitable for beginner surfers.

I had a very pleasant birthday trip here ❤️❤️ I came to Wanning from Sanya to play with my friends. Originally, my friend booked a suite, but I booked another room myself. The overall environment is great and comfortable. The manager, Jacky, was very considerate and helped me check in. He also knew that I would arrange a small cake for me on my birthday. He was also very caring. Knowing that my previous experience in Sanya was not very good, he arranged a room with a good view for me. The housekeeper Xiao Wu is very professional and very professional. Caring is like a good friend, always asking me what I need, and helping me to check in smoothly. Then I moved in and went out to play. They helped me arrange my luggage into the room. It's almost midnight hahaha, I even asked Xiao Wu to go there to do nucleic acid. The service is really super caring~~ Tell me where to go for breakfast in the morning and then help me to check out late and help me arrange it properly. It was a really great experience, exceeding all my expectations for Mannings.
The decoration of the room belongs to the more Chinese style and it is very spacious. You can see the sea and the scenery is super good. And then the breakfast is also very good, everything is there. Overall, the service is amazing to me and the invincible sea view here. It is really suitable for vacationing. It will feel like forgetting everything ~ I will stay here for a longer time next time. Happy~ I like this hotel. Overall Marriott did not disappoint, very good

Even if they are not guests of the hotel, they did not make the place dirty... This is the problem of hotel management Alright... Next, I want to talk about Park Hyatt...

Especially the housekeeper Xiao Wu was very serious and responsible. He also gave us two boxes of coconut cake specialties, which was very considerate. I think the staff are very enthusiastic when going in and out. The only one is the service staff at the afternoon tea, who lost his temper with her colleague in front of the guests, knocked on the table vigorously and lost his temper loudly, which is very disgusting. Now, a five-star hotel, it's so easy to vent your emotions, I have a bad impression, but I was very satisfied after staying for three days throughout the trip.

I don't know what went wrong. Thanks to Ctrip's assistance, changing the room type at the original price is considered a solution. Second, the decoration of the room is very old, and the service can't keep up. It is said that there is a housekeeper, and it took three hours to reply after sending WeChat. On the first day of check-in, the bottles of conditioner were all empty. Third, the restaurant buffet is a big pit, don't step on it! I saw the sunset buffet on the beach the first day, and the dishes were pretty good. The next night, I went to eat it. It was completely different from what Joe saw one day. The crayfish was gone, and the barbecue skewers looked like they were left over from yesterday, and they were hard to bite. I didn’t move, and the other dishes were nothing. The difference from the previous day was too big. The three of us spent more than 900 yuan, and I regretted it to death! Third, I checked out at 12 noon and checked into another hotel at 7 pm only to find that my ID card had not been cleared, which made it impossible to check in to the next hotel. It took a long time to call to solve the problem. I feel that the hotel is very chaotic as a whole. Anyway, I will definitely not stay again next time.

After coming to the hotel, the housekeeper Xiao Wu added us on WeChat. The one-to-one service is convenient and efficient. He will take the initiative to understand the check-in experience every day, which is very caring and warm. The hotel rooms are amazing and the view to the sea from the terrace is amazing! The hotel also sent coconut cakes, so considerate! Special thanks to all the Sheraton staff who served us, it was really great. I will definitely come back again if I have the opportunity in the future, and I recommend this treasure hotel to everyone.

In terms of hardware, breakfast is considered poor in a five-star hotel, with few varieties, the restaurant is small, very hot, sweaty, and the seats are crowded, and there are people who take meals behind the seats. No freshly squeezed watermelon juice. The hotel does not have an executive lounge, only a minibar with rich products. The bbq's lobster can add an ice drunk plum flavor. The suite is large in size and has a better view. The balcony is protruding. If the budget is limited, you can choose the sea view. The view is the same, and there is no lounge anyway. The decoration of the hotel is a bit old, the location of the plug does not match the modern usage habits, and the TV is too small and needs to be upgraded.

msg:Come to Wanning's favorite hotel to meet all the needs of bringing a baby + vacation + work. I booked two rooms, one for the sea view and one for the garden view. The scenery is different but I am happy. The first thought when I came to the hotel was that I regretted coming here directly. The breakfast is good and the scenery is good. The most praiseworthy thing is the hotel's butler service. The housekeeper Xiao Wu has raised the hotel's service to a higher level. Before checking in, I have already contacted in advance to provide 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 services. When I asked about 1 and 2 casually, I got a detailed reply. The buffet dinner introduced by the housekeeper Xiao Wu, the mobile phone can reserve a seat at any time, and I can arrange the dinner for the whole family with my fingertips. I really thank him. The most thankful thing is that after finding out that the computer mouse is wrong, and asking the front desk to be coldly said "this service is not provided", I feel super frustrated. On Monday, I can't work! Suddenly I thought of Butler Xiao Wu, and sought his help with a try attitude. I didn't expect that he would conjure up the mouse that I used in the hotel like Doraemon, and it was still a new one. I was really moved. Thinking that it will be used in the next few days, I want to buy it, but because it is the hotel's internal property, he can only help borrow it, but Xiao Wu nicely said that he can pass by the nearby Dong'ao Town the next day to help buy one and bring it back. I have to say that it is beyond the normal service scope of the hotel. I am embarrassed but have to say yes, thank you very much. Of course, he helped me apply to the leader and gave me the mouse, which not only solved the urgent problem but also saved my work for the next few days👍 I would like to say that the hardware facilities of the hotel are important, but the soft power relies on the closest customers The front-line staff, earning it with heart and enthusiasm. Therefore, the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula Resort is highly recommended. (Breakfast at 8:30 in the morning, swimming at 10:00, surfing in the afternoon, beach seafood buffet at 6:30 in the evening, sitting on a spacious and quiet beach chair after the meal, blowing the sea breeze, listening to the waves, watching the stars… …Good night)

After reading the Raiders Sheraton Hotel, the reviews were very good, so I made a temporary reservation. After arriving at the hotel, the staff checked the health code and checked in, and upgraded the room type for free. Damon also carefully introduced various activities during the stay and understood our travel and play needs. I really feel his enthusiasm and care. , gave us a good experience, and the children had a great time. The hotel's beach and Corona shop are very good, the swimming pool is also very large, and there are many meals around. Next time, we will continue to choose here.

msg:After staying in so many hotels, I chose the Sheraton Hotel in Wanning this time. Because it is an old hotel, I didn't have much hope, but I have to say. I'm really sorry for the name Sheraton. First of all, check in at the door. The efficiency of the front desk is extremely low, and it takes more than 20 minutes for one person to check in. During the epidemic, the form must be filled out. I didn't say to let the customers behind fill in first. This will also speed up the work efficiency, and it is still under everyone's suggestion. After sending information sheets to the following customers one after another, the efficiency was improved. Secondly, there is no butler or doorman to carry luggage for guests, and the most basic five-star etiquette is not available, and no one asks how your guests hang around in the hotel. Then there is the room, the facilities and equipment are too old. The key mirror is still facing the bed. There is a humidifier underneath. Waking up in the middle of the night to the humidifier light hitting the mirror. Almost didn't scare people to death, talking about restaurants. Room for this price. Breakfast was a bit of a disappoin**ent indeed. Sheraton is the worst hotel and homestay I stayed in this time. I don’t recommend friends to come here!

To catch up with Wanning, the wind is blowing in the house these days, and it is as noisy as sitting in the middle of a tsunami. The second is the hotel’s buffet dinner. I ate at the seaside against the strong wind. I don’t know if it’s the wind or the ingredients are not fresh. After eating, I vomited and diarrhea the next day, which completely affected the next trip. I am so disappointed in this hotel and will never stay again.

You can enjoy the blue sea of Wannings without leaving home. . This is very close to the Corona Surf Club, suitable for young people. The seaside barbecue in the evening is also good and worth a try.

The style of the hotel is Southeast Asian tropical style, which I personally prefer.

msg:Bad review! Poor service! Poor matching! Emergency response is extremely slow! First, I made a mistake and walked to the Four Points by Sheraton next door. The guards of honor, security guards and front desk service who had never entered the door were very good and considerate. Later, we were told that we had booked a vacation at the Sheraton next door. The security guard was indifferent, and the front desk only left one The new girl ~ also no one to guide. I went to the bar to play and returned to the hotel. The door lock was broken again. After half an hour, a waiter came, and then stood there for ten minutes and said: "You guys wait here for a while." Then left again? ? ? The little sisters in the same company were already furious and ready to go to the front desk to ask for an explanation, and then met the engineer Fu on the way, but the room card was taken away by the waiter just now, and ten minutes later slowly came over with the room card, the engineer Fu We opened the door and said that the maintenance would take an hour or two. Let us rest first. At this time, we took the initiative to call the front desk and asked if we should change the room, and then we remembered to change it for us. The whole incident lasted close to 50 minutes, and the processing was extremely slow. During the period, we did not say that we were arranged to rest in an air-conditioned room, there was no apology, and there was no after-sales service. The next day the customer service manager sent me a text message to apologize, and thought that at least he had a good attitude, but after I went back, I never got back to me! Is this your attitude? ? There is no hotel with the worst travel experience in Hainan!

msg:It was a really great and very moving trip. . Because I have lived in the peninsula for a short time, I like the environment of Sheraton and the beach of Sheraton very much, so I recommended a few friends to stay at Sheraton this time. The special surprise this time is that the housekeeper Sky has been giving warm reminders to check-in before check-in, and after check-in, he also gives meticulous and gentle greetings and timely problem solving every day. We stayed at the Sheraton for two days and felt as comfortable and warm as at home, without any anxiety and restraint, because Sky was like our relatives. . Here, our group not only tasted the delicious and authentic Hou'an noodles, but also enjoyed the beautiful scenery, beautiful songs and delicacies of the sunset restaurant, and experienced various interesting parent-child activities. .
Something happened yesterday that moved me. My drone was hanging on a tree branch when I was filming. When I was at a loss, the security squad leader and the security guard rushed over and not only helped me find the drone. At the same location, I even climbed the stairs and climbed the tree to help me take down the plane. All our little friends couldn't help but give thumbs up. Thank you, thank Sheraton for giving us a wonderful journey. Next time we come to the peninsula, we will definitely choose Sheraton. . 👍

Fortunately, the hotel handles it well. In order to exempt the supplementary fee, otherwise it will really affect the travel mood.

Then the hotel also provides a self-test. I think this makes me feel at ease during these special times. Opposite the lobby is the beautiful coastline. We booked a room with golf. The lady at the front desk asked us what room we liked and upgraded to a sea view room. And Miss Sky added my WeChat. Any questions will be answered immediately. Very caring. give a like. The overall audit of the room is not up to date. But there are still others. Clothes racks, dehumidifiers, and sanitized Peas shoes. Open the door of the room window is the sea. Although there are some lights outside the house that look rusted. After all, there is no way for the sea breeze to erode the sea. But the facilities in the room are clean. The sofa is upholstered but has no stains. Went to Amy the next day. To be honest, Sheraton's front desk service is much better than Amy's in all aspects. The staff are also very friendly.

msg:I would like to commend the housekeeper Xiao Wu here. When I checked in, I helped upgrade the room type, introduced the hotel facilities, and paid attention to customer demands at the first time. I went to Shimei Bay Amy to live in, and I should have continued my stay in Shenzhou Peninsula at that time. I found Xiao Wu at the first time and helped me arrange a room.

The concierge is also polite in doing things.

Take this to complain about Le Méridien Shimei Bay Hotel, everyone still stays at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula. Sheraton Shenzhou mainly has better service and a good a**osphere.
Let's talk about Amy's problem in Shimei Bay:
First, check in at 15:30 I waited for half an hour and checked in at 16:00.
Second, the fruit residue of a guest on the desk was not wiped clean after check-in.
Third, the glue of a guest's disposable toilet seat in front of the toilet seat was not wiped clean, I wiped it myself.
Fourth, I will deduct more than 0.6 yuan for dinner at night. I said that if I deduct more, I will deduct more. I must chase it out to cancel the order. I hurried back to the meeting.
Fifth, the staff knocked on the door at 2:30 in the morning without saying anything, which made people very scared

msg:It's not the first time I've written a review, but this is the most serious I've ever written. Arrived at the store around 4:30 in the afternoon, because the hotel staff contacted me in advance before arriving at the store, understood my needs in advance and made arrangements [666] I was about to arrive at the store and the butler personally greeted me at the door. The little brother at the concierge at the door was also very helpful. Professionally, the luggage of my sisters and I was properly arranged. The housekeeper helped us check the itinerary code, health code and do the antigen at the door. The weather was hot but the hotel staff were extremely patient. This is also one of the hotels that I have checked strictly for prevention and control since the epidemic, but it is also the one that I am most comfortable staying in. [Applause] To be honest, as a resort hotel, everyone is definitely not willing to wear a mask anytime and anywhere, only to cooperate with the strict inspection and control of the hotel It also protects guests and all staff on another level, which is really super safe. Entering the lobby, the lobby bar that catches your eye is facing the sea, which makes people feel that my vacation has started happily. The little sister at the front desk was also very professional and enthusiastic in handling the procedures, and took the trouble to answer my various curiosity while going through the procedures. It just means that the service is not too good. After the formalities were completed, the butler took us back to the room, while introducing the various supporting facilities of the hotel and the surrounding Internet celebrity check-in places. After checking in, I went to the legendary Corona-themed Qing bar non-stop. It’s really not too comfortable. Drinking a little wine with my sisters, blowing the sea breeze and enjoying the sunset 🌅 Just thinking about it makes me feel the picture, let alone being there. . I asked the housekeeper to help make an appoin**ent for the evening seaside barbecue buffet🌊 The dishes are very rich in choices and the prices are very affordable. Because we went late, we missed the most crowded time. To be honest, the sea breeze at night is not too comfortable. Three or two friends are eating what they like to eat, listening to the band singing in the evening breeze, the holiday is not too beautiful, there is a feeling of stopping, and the whole person is happy physically and mentally. Because of the itinerary, we only stayed for one night and the butler thoughtfully arranged a late check-out. The check-out procedure was very fast. The butler personally took us on the bus and brought us some hotel gifts. . Next time, I must come and stay for two more days. I highly recommend [strong][strong] Thank you Elaine for being very professional, enthusiastic, and in place

msg:This hotel has subverted my fantasy of Sheraton, and my love for the Sheraton brand yesterday has been completely subverted by this hotel! Originally booked for three nights in a row, but there is no hotel nearby. The time of arrival is already 11:00 in the morning, so we can temporarily stay for one night! After doing it, you will know that this hotel has a lot of "services" that surprise you. You have to do a one-time nucleic acid test at the entrance of the hotel. I have touched the gloves of other people's nucleic acid test for us to test the nucleic acid. I am speechless here, omitting 10,000 words! I know that I will help you check in at the front desk of the hotel. There is a wave of guests in front who may be group guests, but what surprised me even more is that, There is only one front desk in the entire hotel, and the check-in time is about 15 minutes. One front desk only received a wave of group customers! We were left alone until we complained to the manager before someone took care of us... Finally checked in, a brand under Starwood The toothpaste used in Hilton's hotels is Meganet, and the toothpaste used by chain hotels is not very good. May I ask if the purchasing and purchasing manager of the hotel thinks that we don't understand or is there some misunderstanding in the middle? I am very speechless about this hotel, and the sanitation is not very good. There are many water spots and dust on the table... The last point is also very helpless. I forgot to bring a charging cable for my mobile phone today. I asked the hotel if they could provide it. The hotel directly asked us to go down and pick it up Charging treasure...me? ? By the way, it is worth mentioning that before I checked in, a customer service member of the hotel called me. I was in a meeting at that time, but the customer service made three consecutive calls and did not ask if you can communicate conveniently now? All the above services can only be summarized as the incompetence of the manager or this hotel is not a Sheraton at all, because all the Sheratons I have in China are not like this. This is not even worthy of a five-star hotel. I hope the management can do it Read this review carefully, and hope that all friends who want to come to check in or come on vacation will carefully choose the hotel, and never come again. If you really choose to come, I will drink at these two bars and restaurants. It is recommended that you stay at Le Meridien or Westin. This hotel has old facilities and poor service, which does not match the price at all. Don't let this hotel disillusion you with Wanning.

msg:This is the review that I want to write most when I have stayed in so many hotels. I am very grateful to the Sheraton Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula for bringing us happiness. The most important thing here is to thank the front desk supervisor Ms. Xiao Sui and the hotel housekeeper Mr. Wu Yuhai for giving us meticulous care. take care of.

At first, I read the recommendation of a small book and chose Westin, but I have to say that Westin is not very convenient for parents with children to play, because the children's swimming pool and the adult swimming pool are in the east and west of the hotel respectively. , the middle span is very long, and it is boring along the way. I feel very tired when I walk to the swimming pool, and the children's swimming pool is only 40cm, very shallow and the water quality is very general. The adult swimming pool is an ordinary atoll swimming pool, especially the Westin's insect repellent is not good, a family of three only swam for ten minutes before being bitten by mosquitoes a lot. Westin is more suitable for couples who have low swimming needs.

Afraid of stepping on thunder, we first drove to Sheraton to visit. The door guards at the door were very strict in prevention and control, so that guests could check in with confidence. When they entered the door, they were amazed and immediately ran to the front desk to book a room.

Lobby: The extra-large T-shaped swimming pool and the water method in the lobby are full of vacation a**osphere. I also like the decoration style of the hotel, which is Southeast Asian style.

Garden view: The garden planning is very good, it will not be crowded and can also play the role of shading. Every few steps is a small pavilion where you can rest.

Swimming pool: There are many swimming pools. The T-shaped swimming pool is very large. You can play a lot of water play facilities in it. The water depth is 1.45 meters. Next to China Unicom, there are several small bubble pools of 0.9 meters where parents and children can rest and play. There are three connected atoll swimming pools between the hotel and Four Points. The slope can be from shallow to deep, and children can play with confidence. There is also a swimming pool with Casa Corona, where you can drink a bottle of Corona beer while swimming. In short, it is very comfortable and fun. I feel that I am playing all the time in Sheraton, and there is no sense of boredom.

Breakfast: You can choose between outdoor and indoor. I was very comfortable eating indoors and outdoor once in the two days I stayed.
Kids Zone: For the little ones, kids pasta, kids mashed potatoes, mini burgers, mini sandwiches, freshly made marshmallows and popcorn.
You can choose Hou'an powder for breakfast, it tastes very good
The key point is that the hotel's breakfast actually has ice cream, which is amazing.

entertainment:
There are many check-in places in the hotel, Internet celebrity swings, Internet celebrity surfboards, infinity pools, seaside carousels, small trains, beach motorcycles, banana boats
Corona bar, drink a bottle of Corona with my wife in the evening, it is too comfortable for children to play with sand on the beach.
Casa corona restaurant and bar, very authentic Mexican food, recommend Corona strawberry bartender.

Service: I would like to thank Xiao Sui, the front desk supervisor of the hotel, for upgrading the sea view room for us. The air is very good and the scenery is beautiful. You can directly see the blue sea, swimming pool and beautiful garden landscape, while sitting on the balcony and blowing the sea breeze. One day I couldn't find my wife's hairpin, Xiao Sui and my colleagues searched for it for a day and finally delivered it to our room. Thank you so much. There is also hotel steward Mr. Wu Yuhai who always pays attention to our itinerary and the baby's stay experience. Xiao Sui and Xiao Wu also presented us with very beautiful gifts, which made my family of three have such an unforgettable happy time at Sheraton Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula. I feel that I have become good friends with Xiao Sui and Xiao Wu, and I will keep in touch in the future. To be honest, isn't it just to make children happy? Choosing Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula will definitely make you experience the joy of vacation. Next time, I will bring my parents to stay for half a month.

Originally, I wanted to live higher and see the sea, but I didn't expect to arrange it on the first floor. I said to check the room first and then make sure, but I was overjoyed! It is great to be able to see the sea, the lawn, the trees, and the birds chasing each other on the trees in the early morning!
Another surprise was the aerial photography. The photographer originally said that it would not be possible to take pictures. It was approaching evening and there were indeed many people on the beach. The aerial photography effect was probably not very good. Perfect!

Although there are more people during the Chinese New Year, you need to queue up for breakfast. In fact, it is completely understandable and does not affect the dining a**osphere. The hotel has many activities suitable for children to play, such as a swimming pool where children can swim, you can choose to pay at your own expense, it has its own beach, and there is a Corolla bar on the beach where you can listen to music, drink coffee and drink. more relaxed. Like catching shrimps, crabs and playing in the sand, children will like it very much. All in all, it was a very relaxing and enjoyable stay in the hotel these days.

The reason for the choice is that the location is good, and the second is that I especially like the feeling of the sunset bar in Corona by the sea.
After checking in, the experience is very good. The butler Sky provides attentive service, and also upgrades the sea view room for us for free, and the view is very good.
During my stay at the hotel, I also used the swimming pool and gym, which is very suitable for vacation. If you don't want to go out, the facilities in the hotel can meet your needs.
I was reluctant to leave when I left, and I will stay in Wanning next time I come. 💗

The only disadvantage of the hotel is that many of the equipment and facilities are relatively old, and it is perfect aside from this.

msg:At the beginning of the trip, I searched for a lot of platform reviews, and I was almost misled by some bad reviews, saying that the hotel was very old, but in the end I chose Sheraton on the Shenzhou Peninsula, the biggest highlight of this Spring Festival trip.
During the spring, the room was tense everywhere, and I finally booked two sea view rooms for 2 nights. Thank you to our sky ~ the housekeeper, who has been in contact with us to arrange the itinerary since we checked in, and also condolences on our meals and accommodation after we checked in. Because we are a Marriott member, he also helped to arrange Upgraded and arranged a place very close to the sea, like our housekeeper Sky again👍
🧹Sanitation: Very clean, cleaning is also timely
🚗 Transportation: The surrounding area is also very convenient. There is a shuttle from the hotel station to the airport. There is food in many residential areas just after leaving the hotel.
🍃Environment: Not to mention the environment, greenery, swimming pool, private beach, hotel scale are very good, there is a sunset bar on the beach, I go to sit every day, the hotel room is also very large, with an independent balcony, the actual feeling is better than the online standard Much bigger, very quiet, good soundproofing room, good sleep
🔔Service: There are not too many service staff in the hotel, but the service attitude is not bad. Some people come to deliver fruits and candies after check-in. The breakfast is ok, but it won't be too amazing. There are too many people queuing in the morning of the Spring Festival haha
Summary ❤️: The hotel is generally very good. I don't want some bad reviews on the Internet to say that it is dirty and old. I stayed and felt it. To be honest, I feel a little picky. The hotel has a certain age, and some discounts are damaged. It is normal to say some furniture traces. Let’s just say that other people’s hygiene is poor and their furniture is old. I guess some people’s homes are not as clean as the hotel, and the furniture is not as new as the hotel. The hotel is well maintained after long-term stay by the sea.
During the Spring Festival, although the price of 2,3000 is relatively high, it is not bad in comparison with the same period. After all, ordinary B&B hotels are also close to thousands, and they should be much cheaper in normal times. The five-star price/performance ratio is already very good.
The most comfortable hotel I stayed in this trip. I will definitely stay here again when I come to Wanning 👍

msg:The old brand Sheraton was also a leader in the hotel industry at the beginning. It is estimated that the Sheraton in any city is a bit outdated due to the current epidemic, but the location of the brand that still maintains is still not inferior to the current super-hot hotels. First of all, the environment , I don't have to say that the sea view is beautiful enough. The beach of the hotel also meets many places where Internet celebrities check in. This is also the selling point of this hotel. The truth service is very uncomfortable from the moment you walk in the door. Multiple security guards conduct various interrogations and inspections. To be honest, this is all necessary during the epidemic. It is understandable that you are also staying in hotels at the beginning of the epidemic. Once, it seemed that we spent money to live in the store, not the so-called prisoners. We took photos and kept a background of many times in various code inspections and brushed our faces. The security guard asked us how we got here. After I told the flight number of the plane and the details such as when it landed, let us find out the reservation information and they took pictures. Since the information after the reservation was deleted, adding that we have been on the island for seven days, the explanation After the situation, I still insisted on the flight information. I argued a few words with a staff member during the period. We cooperated with various inspections and asked you to take pictures. Although this is our privacy, there is no way to stipulate that no one can stop it, but the flight information I I have already told you, or you can take a pen and paper and I will register the information. Isn't the registration also the hotel's responsibility? If you want to save trouble, just take photos with your mobile phone and take pictures of the various information we have shown. All kinds of information have taken the initiative to ask you to register. ? I think what he said is rhetorical, when did I not tell it? You ask us to take the initiative to show it. If you ask me to take out the Ctrip information and you can take photos to prove it, is it wrong for me to say that this is our privacy? I said that I can give you registration information, flight number and other information. You don’t agree. Could it be that the hotel will not consider the interests of tourists? It’s not as fast as paper and pen registration, everyone. Carrying luggage and basking in the doorway, the hotel industry relies on service, and it is so arrogant that people can't enter without showing it. Just thinking about the beauty of the peak season and the misery of the off-season, it does not rely on toughness, taking epidemic prevention and control The pretense of taking a tough attitude towards the guests is really uncomfortable. At that time, it was not because I was afraid that the children would be disappointed. Your hotel's reputation is discredited. Let's talk about the food, the buffet for dinner in the hotel. There are more than 300 adults and 184 children. Seriously, I have never seen such a buffet dinner. After walking around, I didn't even know What to eat, the variety is poor, and that night, I ate a pack of chocolate beans in the hotel room, and I was not full at all. I am really sorry for the price. There is nothing to say about the breakfast. For one room, the children will be charged for breakfast. How much do they eat? We decided to leave because we really didn't know what to eat! If you can eat out, don't eat in the hotel. Besides, this night, our family of three fell asleep at 3:00 in the morning. We were woken up by the sound of the upstairs at 1:00 in the middle of the night, and then there was another loud noise, which made us sit up for a long time. I didn't dare to sleep, my heart was about to vomit, and then there were intermittent noises. I communicated with the front desk twice, sent a waiter to inquire, and also came to the room to listen, telling a group of people that they had just returned from the banquet, and it was two o'clock in the morning. Should other people be more conscious when they are sleeping? My husband shouted at the door to stop arguing, and the man upstairs scolded cao. This quality, my son was also woken up and couldn’t sleep. The waiter said that he could tune in for us. The room was rejected by us. We couldn’t afford it, and we couldn’t stand it with a child in the middle of the night. Later, we spent the night with patience, got up early and checked out, and said to a girl at the front desk by the window, can we check out here? She didn't respond to me, I was waiting on the side, she was checking in for a lady, she didn't say a word to wait a moment, I waited silently, and later they didn't ask me, I asked her if she could Check out? She just looked up and took the room card for me, hey! This service is the reason why you have not made progress, right? But the good business must say that my butler will contact me when I am on the road, until the hotel greets me at the door, accompany us to check in and take us back to the room, introduce various activities of the hotel, catering, butler Fairy Xiaomeng, a sweet girl, also asked us in advance when we were leaving and wanted to see us off, but we were in a hurry and couldn't see it. He kept calling me on WeChat to apologize and regret not being with us. After meeting and saying goodbye, I asked me for an address and mailed special products to us. Special products are heartfelt, and more importantly, we felt her sincerity. If the hotel can have more staff like Fairy Xiaomeng, I believe in the Sheraton brand. Will last forever!

Crazy praise for housekeeper Long Ye! ! The little girl smiles very cutely, and the service is excellent. When the Spring Festival is so busy, she has to answer any questions, and the information is answered in seconds. Many resort hotels in Hainan now have butler services, but some are really formal, and you can't feel the service. Many of them are for praise. This girl has shown us that a housekeeper who can help solve problems is a good housekeeper, excellent!
Mannings is a great place, will keep coming!

It can be said that when I booked this hotel, I looked at the opening time in 2014 and thought it was a well-established old-fashioned hotel. But my service started after I just booked the hotel! The housekeeper Lesley took the initiative to add me on WeChat, told me all about the hotel and Mannings, and helped me arrange the room in advance. When we arrived, he came to receive us as soon as possible, and the first impression was that this hotel is very well-intentioned. ~~ Then because we brought two children and a baby, and there are many needs in the middle, Lesley and the hotel have helped us arrange well, often staying in hotels, but this very attentive and immediate attitude is really worthy of praise, let They insist on being excellent. In addition, the layout of the hotel's swimming pool and beach should also be said. Sheraton has arranged the usual beach in Hainan to have the desire to take pictures, and it is very filmy! The layout of the swimming pool can also allow us with children to lie down and enjoy a wonderful day in this hotel. We are lucky to meet a butler who serves attentively like Lesley. I hope to meet you next time.

The hygiene of the guest rooms is also very commendable, and I, a very hygienic person, can't fault it. The hotel's various activities facilities are good, and the breakfast is very rich. It's really an unforgettable trip, I will come back next time and continue to choose his home!

After getting up the next night, a small bump was bitten out of my calf by an insect. When I checked out, I asked it, that is, I gave the medicine a spray.

msg:I have to say that Wanning is really better than Sanya, the water is bluer and clearer, and the hotel's price/performance ratio is higher than Sanya!
We came in November. There were not many people and upgraded the sea view room. The location of the hotel is a little bit off. You have to take a taxi to go out. I don’t understand why taxis here are so expensive. It might be more cost-effective to charter a taxi farther away.
There are not many restaurants in the surrounding area, so you can order take-out. We ordered take-out in the evening and we sat at the buffet on the balcony to listen to hahaha~
The paddle boards and travel shots included in the package are absolutely unique. The paddle boards are very fun. The photographer's photography skills are the best among the ones I have visited. The Corona Sunset Bar must be visited, and the photos are super! ! !

Very close to the beach, there is a sunset bar by the beach, where you can have a little wine in the evening.
There is also a surf shop in the hotel, and you can book an instructor to learn surfing.
Will stay in Wanning again next time.
At the same time, I would like to thank the butler sky for his warm service, thoughtful and attentive, and the most important thing is to be timely and answer all questions. Like manually!

The staff is very enthusiastic. The young lady from the customer service depar**ent, Sky, contacted me two days before check-in and asked about my preferences. She was very considerate.
After check-in, I upgraded the room type and explained the hotel’s various facilities throughout the process.
Although the hotel was renovated for 14 years, all facilities are well maintained and equipped with bluetooth speakers. The courtesy and enthusiasm of the staff is a bonus. The hotel environment is simply perfect, private beach, especially clean. The swimming pool is also very comfortable. I told Miss Sky that I have a cleanliness addiction, and then I went out on the first day when I checked in and came back to see the welcome fruit. At the same time, the staff also changed the hand towels. The details were perfect and the room was spotless.
It was also very pleasant when I left. The concierge staff were eager to help with the luggage, and the service was really perfect.
The hotel’s special Corona Bar is also a must. There are many people during the day, and it’s a special filming in the evening. It’s a very pleasant memory. Next time I come, I will choose Sheraton.
The shuttle bus and the 5% off at the duty-free shop are all very good, but I can’t experience the ticket in Haikou and can only be the next time~
Thank you very much for Miss Sky's enthusiasm throughout the whole process. I have to say that it is the best and best service in the resort hotel I have stayed in in the past year. The ceiling must be five stars!

msg:The experience was very good last year. I was afraid that this hotel would be forgotten because of the inconvenient transportation, so I wrote a lot of reviews. Sure enough, business is very good this year. Even though it is the off-season, the service staff feel that they are not able to receive it. So at the beginning, there was a little unpleasantness in my heart. However, the hotel will return in time. When I check in, I will ask about my experience and inform the hotel about some small things. When making a mistake, the hotel apologized with a small gift. After that, the experience was very good, the pool was still very cool, and we did it because of the second brush of the pool. There is a sunset bar next to the beach, Wanning’s No. 1 internet celebrity clearing bar, and it’s very pleasant to play frisbee on the hotel beach at sunset. The content of the seaside hotel is an experience that cannot be copied by some Shanshui hotels. I look forward to the next meeting.
The hotel also presents a lot of content, such as travel shots and paddle boards, all for free. The breakfast variety is still a bit small, and I hope that the variety of dishes can be increased. However, the western restaurant and the Chinese restaurant are quite good. If you don't want to go out, you can eat in the hotel.

msg:The overall check-in experience is still okay. Although I didn't figure out "Four Points by Sheraton" and "Sheraton Vacations" at the beginning, although they are both a hotel, it is reasonable to say that the location, environment and service should still be different.
Although I finally asked Ctrip to coordinate and help adjust it, I still don’t like the trea**ent of the hotel reservation depar**ent. The room type of "Four Points" corresponds to the attitude of the designated room type of "Sheraton Vacations", because the same room type must have different prices. In the end, the room types specified by the hotel were sold out, and I insisted on choosing other room types according to the budget.



🚗 Transportation: It is best to come by car, but the roads in the Shenzhou Peninsula are curved and tourists will often come out suddenly, so pay attention to safety.
There are few parking spaces on the ground, so please contact the front desk in advance to confirm parking
Question, don’t be in a good mood for the first time. The hotel door fell halfway before entering.

🍃Environment: After all, the old-fashioned hotel is still comfortable, and the others are okay. The beach behind the hotel is obviously softer than the one next to it, and the waves are more peaceful.

🔔Service: The butler will phone you in advance to confirm the check-in time, and add WeChat to help you. The basic meeting and greeting etiquette during the stay is available, and the room service is also relatively timely.

msg:Sheraton is the second destination of this Wanning trip. I chose Sheraton because of the sunset bar and surfing beach, and the other because of the most beautiful road from Shimei Bay to Shenzhou Peninsula. As a result, I couldn’t appreciate it because of the rain. I left it for next time. Bar.
🚗 Transportation: The best way to go to the Shenzhou Peninsula is to drive by yourself. There is actually no construction on the island except for hotels. It takes half an hour to drive from Westin to Sheraton. There are many detours and large trucks. You must pay attention to safety the first time you drive. , It was very late when we went, so we should be very cautious when there is no light and it is raining. By the way, there is a guard box before the car enters the Sheraton, and the security guards inside are very handsome 🤪🤪🤪
🧹Hygienic: Not bad, although I still wiped it with a sterile tissue 🤭
🍃Environment: Sheraton’s lobby has always been able to produce a large area, the exclusive beach is particularly beautiful, the waves are very beautiful, the beach is very fine, the waves we stayed for two days were very good, and my daughter completed a very satisfactory surfing course here, which may not be managed by Sheraton The layout of the beach is a bit messy, the barbecue site is a bit of a play, I wanted to watch the sunset at the sunset bar, but unfortunately it has been raining in Manning these days, and only a little sunset is seen. The children’s playground and outdoor swimming pool next to the beach are very big. It's hilarious to watch people playing in the morning.
The room is very big, it’s a shame not to choose the full sea view, but the golf course looks good, the balcony is a little small and the next door is very close and it’s not private enough, that is, the two chairs on the balcony can be used without fabric cushions. It doesn’t feel good when it’s wet, although it looks pretty and useless 🙈
Bedding: I must like it here. The four pillows are very satisfying. The quilt and mattresses are very clean and comfortable. Especially the mattresses are just hard and soft. They were my best two days of sleep this time. The air conditioner is very quiet and the temperature is a bit low. It is equipped with a dehumidifier. We turned it off at night. The standard bathroom has a lot of water. The shower faucet is very comfortable. The toiletries provided are basic but they smell good.
🔔Service: The service here is very friendly, but the concierge’s response was a bit slow when he arrived the first night to pick up the luggage
The breakfast is also good, although the variety is not very rich, it is complete, and the taste is good.
In short, during the epidemic, I want to find a quiet island for surfing, watching the sea, parenting and relaxing... Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula is a good choice😁
Finally, I would like to thank the hotel’s guest relations manager Sky and our housekeeper lexie. We contacted us before we arrived, until we checked in safely, and we arranged in time if we needed it. It was especially safe to go out 😘

msg:This Hainan Eastern Route Tour is the most expensive, but the worst five-star! Generally, I don’t bother to comment on the difference, but I have been to Hainan three times and stayed in a dozen five-star hotels in various regions. The Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula is really a five-star price, the standard of the guest house, and the service is even more impressive!
I just arrived and I was told to unload my luggage at the entrance of the lobby and park my car in the ba*****t, but why are there many cars parked on the side of the road in the hotel lobby and along the road, so there is no place to unload my luggage. After checking in, I was told that there was no time to send us our luggage. . . Because of the reception of the meeting, the lobby is really chaotic with insufficient staff!
When I arrived in the room, the size of the room was very cramped. As soon as I entered the room, my husband asked me that the liver-colored decoration is really Sheraton 😂 Because the facilities are too old, the fabric on the pedal pad is also very mottled, and the marble on the bathtub wall is very loose , It will fall as soon as you move, and I am really worried about personal safety. What happened after that proved me again and again 👿
Going to the Chinese restaurant was really a bumpy road. Because of the typhoon, I was forced to evacuate from Boundary Island. I didn’t pay attention to dinner at noon. After checking in at five o’clock in the afternoon, I hurried to eat. Damn, our family has four big and one small quilt. I made three elevators in different positions before I found the Chinese restaurant. I felt that their staff were completely unfamiliar with the hotel. Because we only had two or three tables in the breakfast restaurant, but it was really slow to serve, and one fried rice was urged three times! I almost passed out of hunger. Fortunately, the child was obediently not irritable that day, or I would definitely not be able to maintain my sense. The husband of a dish made a suggestion to the manager, and the manager said that he would change one for us, and then the changed dish did not come up until we finished the checkout. The water poured in the restaurant was steaming boiling water. I asked if there was room temperature water and said no. Only the ice cubes were for me to add. Finally, I asked for an extra cup and changed the water to the child before drinking it. The only satisfaction is that the taste of the dishes is not bad.
Then I will talk about the most important parent-child facilities and activities. We chose this hotel after reviewing the fact that Sheraton is very rich in parent-child activities. Because there is no way to go out on typhoon days, the parent-child of the hotel itself is very important. However, I was so disappointed! ! ! When I entered the room, I received a letter from the hotel telling us not to go out because of the typhoon and stopping the hotel’s outdoor facilities and parent-child activities. I think this is what they are prepared to face the typhoon and provide more comfortable service to the guests. However, the typhoon has become an excuse for their delay in providing services. At 8 o'clock that evening, I asked the recreation center more about the typhoon. What kind of parent-child activities would be arranged the next day, I replied that I was still working on a plan, and there was no activity list. Before breakfast the next morning, I called and asked again, and I was still making a plan for the vague reply. After breakfast, it was more than ten o'clock, and I took the children directly to the recreation center. The activity table finally came out, but there was no reception. I said that when I signed up for stone painting, I was left to dry for more than ten minutes, and then I sent a stone and a box of watercolor pens for the children to paint by themselves. . . Only then did I know why no one signed up for the event, I was naive. . . I would like to ask, as a first-line hotel in Hainan, is it the first time for you to encounter a typhoon and a children’s activity plan?
There is a small slide for children and a small playground, which is really dangerous! As shown in the picture, the slide is a long and majestic iron wire. There are also some fragmentary iron wires scattered in the field. Some of the iron wires are pointed upwards like nails, and there are rusty and discarded angle irons. This one was really angry. I immediately called the hotel to respond and agreed to come and have a look right away, but we waited for forty minutes until we left and no one came. The flowers of our motherland, the parents’ dear children are so disgusted. Is it safe to treat?
When entering the indoor children’s playground, there was a strong musty smell, with only a few small tables and yellowed picture books. There are a few claw machines in it. We were inexplicably swallowed coins and responded to the staff the first day we played. The machine was still on the next day, and we saw other guests continue to be swallowed coins. It is really in sharp contrast with the Hilton in Xinglong. Although the two hotels are marked on the game consoles, the game consoles are provided by a third party and have nothing to do with the hotel. However, Hilton’s handling method is that for whatever reason, the guests responded and took the initiative to return the swallowed coins to us and compensated for some extra coins. Then the lobby manager personally went to see the problem with the game console and whispered softly after confirmation. Gentlely apologized to the child and said that I was sorry that she couldn't let her play the item she liked, so she gave the child some coins to see if there were other favorites to play, and immediately shut down the coin swallowing machine .
We only stayed for one night, and our family could not stand it anymore. We braved the red warning of typhoon and the biggest typhoon in Hainan in the past five years. We resolutely changed the hotel!
Going to a five-star hotel requires facilities, activities, services, and comfort. I didn't feel it at the Sheraton Shenzhou Peninsula. There is no welcome gift, no welcome fruit, no leaving gift, no small details to touch you, they have a large number of conference groups, and the hotel is full of individual guests. Checking out because I expressed strong dissatisfaction, the hotel sent me a small gift, but the bad review is still irretrievable. Although Yana who returned to visit tried his best to recover, but so many problems exposed the problem of hotel management, not one or two people, one sentence or two can be solved by sorry.

msg:1. Checking in under heavy rain, the welcoming brother was very polite, and took the initiative to help us store our luggage first and guide us to park.
2. The young lady who checked in at the front desk should be called Sara. I didn’t see the name clearly. She was very gentle. She took the initiative to help us upgrade the sea view room. Although I chose the garden view room for my personal reasons, it’s a kind of active service. The feeling is really great. And to the various unclear questions raised by the elderly, we answered very gently and patiently.
3. In case of a typhoon during the check-in, the hotel especially asks guests to pay attention to safety in each room and inform the hotel's facilities and services.
4. The hotel staff took the initiative to contact us to ask if we need to check out late, and reminded us to pay attention to safety on typhoon days. We have added the staff's WeChat account and have been patiently answering our questions. The day we left was very windy and found We checked out early, specifically contacted us to care about us, worried about the safety of our driving back to Sanya, which made people particularly warm.
5. Although the cleaning brother doesn't know what he is called, he is gentle and very careful.
6. The hotel breakfast is quite generous, and the restaurant staff will take the initiative to introduce panic buying promotions when you have other dining needs, but unfortunately the buffet dinner is cancelled on typhoon days.
7. The hotel rooms are still big enough, all have balconies, and the bathrooms are relatively spacious. The facilities are not as old as those mentioned on the Internet. Everyone may feel differently. The swimming pool is the beach when the hotel comes downstairs. There are many internet celebrities check in. Carousel/Small Train/Swing/Surfboard/Corolla Bar. The hotel is also very close to the lighthouse
8. Transportation. We drive by ourselves, which is fairly convenient, but other transportation methods are not clear.
9. Friends from Sichuan, there is an old Pepe hot pot located 4 kilometers away from the hotel. It’s very close. If you are greedy, let’s get rid of the gluttons. It’s totally nice. Believe me, haha, I ate for two consecutive days.

msg:How should I say, because I came from Shimei Bay Hotel, there is a slight gap. The main thing is that it is plugged into the hardware, the facade of the room is very old, and the indoor facilities such as the bathtub plug and the hair dryer socket are damaged.

The hotel’s swimming pool is nice, there are paddle boards and some other things to play, of course, all of which have to be paid. In addition, the hotel’s beach arrangements are too messy and dirty

The merry-go-round and small train that attracted me, first of all, they charge a fee and are operated by a third party. . . Third-party operations are everywhere on the beach, a mess. There is a WeChat group to answer questions before check-in
, But the sister at the Recreation Center asked what she didn’t know. The little train and the merry-go-round also said that the front desk can make an appoin**ent, and there is no motorboat on Chau Tsai Island. . .

Anyway, generally speaking, the expectations are too high, which leads to a little disappoin**ent.

I can understand why this one is still cheaper

It is more suitable for young people who like to have fun and non-stop activities, various parties and drinking, or children who are older than five years old. There are many activities to participate in, which is also a good choice

For us like Jingjing, the child is still small, which is really not suitable (the beach is still moving around ten o'clock in the evening). . .

msg:A hotel with good environment, scenery and facilities, and a quiet beach with few people. If it weren't for the front desk and concierge service, it would be a perfect 5-star praise. The breakfast was abundant and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant were excellent. On the recommendation of the foreman, I ate the creamy Hele crab and the fatty but not greasy flaming goat. The restaurant was also very cost-effective. There are many beaches and hydrophilic projects, suitable for vacation. But as a high-end hotel, the service still has to be criticized. Except for a younger sister named Feiyan at the front desk, the other waiters were indifferent and indifferent. I waited ten minutes for check-in. The front desk arranged a shuttle bus one day in advance, but there was no response. Ask the next day before making arrangements. The shuttle bus started on time and was halfway there. He also said that the concierge had made a mistake and had to turn back to take other passengers. He almost missed the high-speed train. This level of service gives a big discount to the travel mood. In view of the fact that everything else is very good, only one service star is deducted. I hope the hotel can pay attention to it and improve it.

msg:When traveling on a staggered peak, I chose Sheraton. At first, I was worried about whether the decoration was a bit old, but later I found that this worry did not exist~ the overall feeling was pretty good, but it is more suitable for family travel, so that you can make full use of the various parent-child play facilities in the hotel.
🚗 Transportation: It is 30-40 minutes away from Wanning Station, and less than one hour from Boao Airport without traffic jam. Going out is more suitable for self-driving, because the various attractions are scattered. But it’s very convenient to take a taxi. Is it dark at night? You need to be mentally prepared.
🧹Hygienic: The cleaning is quite clean
🍃Environment: It’s by the sea, it’s very happy to watch the sea from the balcony
🔔Service: Overall, it’s okay. Once you book a room, you will be contacted by Sky, add WeChat, and send a map of the hotel. You can book an airport or high-speed rail station one day in advance. A set of Hermes as a gift is the icing on the cake
This time I also experienced the follow-up service. I chose Happy Dolphin Photography, which is actually on the first floor of the Recreation Center. Selector Qiqi has friendly communication and enthusiastic service. Photographer Haitang takes pictures in a fun and serious manner. It’s not bad to spend money to take photos and buy a good memory~ By the way, there is also a short aerial shot.
[Charming sea view] It’s very convenient to see the sea, but the weather has changed a bit recently, and it rains quickly, but it doesn’t have a flavor. It is highly recommended to go to the hotel to have a dinner by the sea, accompanied by the sea breeze, listening to music, eating food, full of happiness! The sunset bar is also thief, you can watch handsome guys and beautiful women drinking coffee and drinking
[Parent-child facilities] Parent-child facilities can be found everywhere, so suitable for bringing a baby.

The hotel’s breakfast is also delicious, I recommend Hou'an noodles, basically eat a bowl every day.
The facilities are not too new, but because they are decorated in a Chinese style, they are more antique in style, and they don’t feel old, and they are well maintained. Unlike many old hotels that are European-style, they look very dirty after a long time.
Finally, I will talk about the service. After the order is placed, the concierge will add me to WeChat, and all kinds of questions will be directly contacted by WeChat. The service attitude of the staff in the store is also super good.
All in all, it is a very qualified resort hotel and should come again in the future.

I would like to thank Xiao Guan, the room is arranged very carefully, the children are very happy, and they keep telling us "These are all mine"
I can't tell a sentence or two, in short, the hotel is great, it feels like a vacation, and I am already arranging the next trip

Breakfast is very rich and varied, and the breakfast time is very long. It’s more suitable for my kind of family with children. Mom, don’t get up early 😅 The bed is big enough, the family of three is comfortable to sleep, and the front desk service is also good, they are all in place, especially the handsome guy at the front desk delayed our check-out until 2 o’clock in the afternoon.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first, the environment is really good, the private beach and swimming pool are very good, the scenery is beautiful, and the swimming pool is big enough. But compared with the B&B where I will stay later, these two do not have great advantages. The breakfast is very varied, the taste is also very good, and the cheese is delicious. I sent five travel photos, photos are OK, short video 🙅🏻‍♂️
Then the unsatisfactory places are:
1. The hotel's air conditioner is not enough cooling
2. There is a peculiar smell in the closet
3. The floor drain in the bathroom was not leaking well. I went to the beach and washed the sand and blocked it. The overflowing water flooded the back of my feet, and it took more than ten minutes to slowly drain the water.
4. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel may have too few locations, and it takes more than half an hour to queue for dinner at night
5. Due to the long queue time, I went back to the room and ordered takeaway. Ask the waiter to help pick up the takeaway that was rejected. Go to the lobby downstairs to pick up the takeaway.
6. The hotel only provides two bottles of mineral water without any fruit snacks
Unfortunately, I was addicted to taking outdoor photos, and I forgot to take pictures of the room.

The third 30 minutes is already 17 :40 Ask and answer again. I still have the same sentence. I was on fire all of a sudden. What kind of room hasn't been cleaned in an hour and a half? Are you kidding me! You should inform customers on the official website to let customers check in after 18:00! Doesn't such a big group even have people who clean the rooms? Finally, an administrator came out to help us coordinate a room.

msg:The first time I went to Wanning for a vacation, I chose Sheraton because after all, the brand is not too bad there. When it was funny, stayed for one night and then decided to go out the next day, only to find that the door was broken. No access card is needed at all, the door opens as soon as you push it. We are really big-hearted and speechless.
It looks like a lot of breakfast, but it's just like that. Dinner beach buffet barbecue, 288 people. Wow, I have never thought the hotel buffet is so unpalatable, because it was delicious at the second Sheraton! And I didn’t even ask for a glass of water. Xiaobao wanted to drink water. After more than an hour, he didn’t ask for it. Finally, I went to the front desk to get us ice-cold mineral water, which was quite speechless😒
The most unacceptable thing is the service here. None of the waiters at the front desk are smiling. The training is quite inadequate. Brand hotels are very fancy service. You can't neglect it because you are in Wanning and not in Sanya. Anyway, next time I come, I guess I will have to reconsider another hotel, the price is not low, but the service is not suitable for it.

msg:✓Advantages: The hotel is very close to the sea, and the sea is behind the swimming pool. This is pretty good. The sea view room can hear the sound of the waves and clearly see the sea. The spa has a good environment and good practices. I went to enjoy a preferential price in June, which is cheaper than other five-star hotels. The surfing experience for children is quite fun, the children's center is also quite large, and the music performances in the lobby on the first floor are great every night.
❌Defects: The water in the T-shaped swimming pool is 1.2 meters deep for children under 6 years old, the lobby and guest room toilet boards are yellow, the coffee cups in the guest room are not cleaned, and the trash can in the guest room is not very convenient.
Others: There are many undercurrents at the seaside and you can't swim, which is a pity. Some distance to eat nearby, self-driving is more convenient, all are seafood.
The nearby Shimei Bay Jiajing Island has snorkeling projects which are quite fun.
Will come again if there is a chance!

msg:Environment: The hotel is located on the Shenzhou Peninsula, a distance from the highway intersection, it is recommended to go there by car. It is relatively clean, with fine sand but more water plants. Fortunately, the hotel cleans the water plants on the beach every day, so it’s not bad. Due to the large waves, it is not possible to swim in the sea. The hotel has an outsourced surf shop for surfing.
Facilities: The hotel is suitable for parents and children. There are many activities and play facilities for children, as well as an indoor children's playground. There is no charge for in-house guests. The hotel’s swimming pool is relatively clean and large, and there are several swimming pools next to Four Points, which can be shared, which definitely meets various needs.
Meals: Breakfast is quite satisfactory for a five-star hotel, with Hou'an fans, which are all pretty good. I haven't eaten lunch and dinner at the hotel. I drove out to eat. There are local specialty restaurants such as seafood near Nanyan Bay. The distance is not too far. It takes only 7 or 8 minutes to drive.
Overall evaluation: it is worth a visit, the scenery is very good, recommend a full sea view room.

msg:A family of three from Suzhou traveled to Wanning for 6 days from June 3rd to June 8th
Stayed at the Sheraton Resort Hotel in Shenzhou Peninsula for three nights from June 3rd to June 6th Stayed at the Westin Resort Hotel in Shimei Bay from June 6th to June 8th
During the research before coming here, my wife and I agreed to stay at the Westin, but my wife insisted on staying at the Sheraton because there were many activities for children in the hotel, and I didn’t want to stay because I was too old. (The fact also shows that many facilities are old and the facilities have become decorations.)
The reality really disappointed me. Before checking in, no housekeeper took the initiative to contact in advance to ask about the situation of the passengers (elderly and children) and whether they had any special needs.
On the day of check-in, the car stopped at the lobby door and no one opened the car door, no one came up to greet, and no one helped with the luggage. The staff at the door stood aside and chatted the whole time.
The check-in process took too long, was inefficient, and the instructions were unclear. No one helped to deliver the luggage, and no one helped to lead the way to the room. The first time I came, the experience was very poor. Of course, there was no smiling service, and most of the service staff kept their heads down and avoided.
When I arrived at the room, I felt that the facilities were average. I opened the balcony door to ventilate. In an instant, the floor, tables and chairs were all covered with a layer of water. I called the waiter and said that the temperature difference was large. Hainan was like this. I had never seen it in Sanya before, and it was not the same in the Westin I stayed in later. The quilt felt damp, and I frowned deeply.
After negotiation, it took half a day to get the dehumidifier.

After packing up, I went out and saw that everything was dilapidated, including the exterior wall of the lobby, and even the skirting at the door of my room had fallen off. I wanted to go to the beach, but when I walked to the swimming pool, the fence was full of dust. What comforted me was that the sand on the beach was still white,
fine, and soft, and the sea view was still beautiful. There were still many photo-taking scenes on the beach, and of course the swimming pool was not bad. The children are young and like to play with sand. Those who care about sand can consider it.

I didn't want to go out at night, so I had a seafood buffet at the beach of the hotel. It was beyond my imagination. A 5-star hotel at the beach, the seafood was not fresh, and it was already discolored and very not fresh. The most annoying thing was that the waiter didn't let you take more, saying that you can come back after you finish eating. Then when you finish eating and go to take it, he has been doing his own thing, completely ignoring your request. Drinks are free, but there are very few categories. There is only beer and it is charged. The cheapest 330ml bottle is 38 yuan, and the second bottle is half price. It is the worst buffet. Although Westin is not very good, at least it is indoors, the dishes are fresh, and there are many categories. Free drinks include beer and red wine.

There is an indoor playground for children in the hotel. It is not big, but there are not many people. I talked to Chen Na from the recreation department. She also reflected that many customers have complaints. The service of the young girl is good.

There is almost no pick-up service, which is not a problem that a five-star hotel should have. If you don't pick up, at least you can send it.
Finally, when I checked out, the efficiency was still surprisingly low. After waiting for a long time, I was told to just give her the card to check out. Then I went to the Westin and waited for nearly 2 hours. The Westin girl urged me 3 times before checking me out. They didn’t check me out at Sheraton. My identity information was still there, so I couldn’t check in to the next hotel. *** Speechless.

After I got home, they had a customer service manager contact me and asked about my experience and feedback. I answered truthfully. The manager had a very good attitude and said that they were working on improving those shortcomings. I believe and hope that there will be changes next time. But will I take the risk? Guess?

Friends, if you want to go to Wanning Shenzhou Peninsula and Shimei Bay to see the sea, you should book the Westin if you have higher requirements for staying in the hotel. Although the Westin also has many shortcomings, it is generally a five-star standard. Although it is not a national rating, it has generally met the standards. Unfortunately, the five-star Sheraton rated by the state is not qualified. At present, the overall maximum is four stars, but it still depends on the hardware such as the beach.

The doll is too small and only needs to eat white noodles. The waiter also cooked very intimately.
Hotel room facilities can be seen a bit of a sense of age. But the overall service can still keep up. Share the public area with Four Points. My baby is too young, more suitable for playing Fu Peng in the swimming pool. If you only play in the public area, you can also consider living next to Four Points. ～～～～～The afternoon tea in the hotel, uh～～～I don’t think it is necessary. Went late. Did not find a good location. Desserts are also very strange. It is not recommended to order it if it is not sent. Had a grilled fish restaurant in the evening. The taste is okay. ～～～～～～～～

管家Luna提前加微信，服務很好，提前安排的海景房很不錯，泳池非常棒。
就是早餐廳吃飯的地方小，連個座位都找不到，外面吃巨熱。希望下次來能有改善。

msg:不得不説此次的半島之旅真的是太棒了!來之前為了避免踩雷在網上搜了許多攻略以及評價，在半島的三家星級酒店之間做了許久的對比，最終選擇了喜來登。與旁邊的福朋共享所有的公共設施。性價比沒的説。
走入酒店園區，映入眼簾的熱帶風光讓人心曠神怡。午間躺在户外的礁瑚泳池，面對着藍藍的海面，吹着海風，一切的疲憊都煙消雲散，這感覺簡直不要太好。傍晚之時和朋友去打卡了科羅娜網紅酒吧，沙灘與落日分分鐘出大片。房間的話年代感比較濃重，畢竟也是十幾年老店了，不過該有的配套設施還是有的，看着也挺温馨的。
假期總是那麼短暫，但半島旅途的記憶確是抹不掉的。下次如果還有機會來的話喜來登一定會是我的首選。我們的管家小吳服務很好，幫忙申請了延遲退房等。

管家Luna很熱心，還幫我找到了遺落在浴衣裏的游泳鏡。
以及酒店介紹的沖浪教練也很專業，很耐心，畢竟這次來萬寧就是為了沖浪，三天練了5h，好快樂。
在萬寧的這幾天是這麼多次來海南最最最難忘最好玩的一次，希望一次比一次好。
我們雙子座過生日，總是要玩點新鮮的，明年繼續沖浪啦！

1️⃣因為説給升房等了一個小時，但升級的房間差強人意。進門就有🕷️，且背向酒店海灘面向草坪（據説是高爾夫草坪）。房間在整個酒店的盡頭，出電梯走很遠很遠很遠……
2️⃣ 或許是地理位置的原因，房間內濕氣很重，給的除濕機每隔一段時間轟轟作響，還以為啟動了掃地機。
3️⃣ 作為五星級酒店，洗漱用品一言難盡，雖然萬豪也衹是佰草集，但最起碼有個品牌。
4️⃣ 早餐安排混亂，進入餐廳後各種搶座位。
5️⃣ 感覺酒店工作人員特別少，經常迷路找不到人，門口的保安也是愛答不理，問3句回1句，總體感覺工作人員不太熱情。


再説説優點：
1️⃣ 自助晚餐氛圍很好，雖然菜品一般，但甜品真的非常OK
2️⃣ 沙灘真的很美，沙子也比三亞的細軟
3️⃣ 管家小劉迴應較快速，態度也比較誠懇，雖然承諾第二天給調整房間，最後也不了了之
4️⃣ 科羅納日落吧值得打卡，至少雞尾酒真的好喝
5️⃣如果想去燈塔，地理位置比較優越

服務：我們到達大約是下午3點，正好也是一般入住時間，辦理手續非常快。

環境：：喜來登大堂正對大海，這個感官真的很好！整體環境偏東南亞風格

房間：原來訂的是雙床房，辦理時經理説進房間有驚喜，以為是小禮品類，進去確實驚喜，升級到家庭套房！！ 還是海景房！！！ 

房間2張2米大床，2個衞生間。 唯一有點不太理想的是 先生和兒子都是過敏體質，對床品清潔度要求很高，我帶著兒子住裏面 兒子沒過敏，先生住外面大床，半夜起小紅點 身上發癢，兩位大爺出門必帶過敏葯！ 吃了葯消退一點了，雖然出現了點小插曲，但整體服務 環境真的很好。 

真的非常感謝嚴先生對我們的照顧，退房時反應了床品情況，也收到嚴先生的反饋。 會繼續來的酒店

msg:酒店安排了一個工作人員Kyrie 小劉在入住的前一天聯繫我，確認到達酒店的時間並提前安排好房間。在酒店裡有什麼事情可以聯繫他來安排，不用自己給前台打電話。
酒店的建築風格是熱帶風格，深棕色為主，房間的傢俱也是同色系的。作為一個10年的酒店，房間設施的維護還是可以的。酒店的一個大亮點就是大堂吧，屋頂很高，穿堂風，景色好，一點都不熱，點杯飲料坐一會兒很舒服放鬆。非常喜歡。
喜來登和旁邊的福朋是泳池公用的，小童的活動都在福朋的礁湖泳池，活動時間是每天固定的，時間安排的也比較合理，每天都可以參加，孩子的參與度還是挺高的。
酒店的早餐中規中矩，每天都有後安粉，還挺好吃的。福朋的泰餐廳的菜的味道還可以，服務員也很熱情。
室內小童活動中心的衞生堪憂，孩子在上面玩的時候被不知道是什麼的東西扎破了腳底板，看傷口應該被劃掉了一塊皮肉。酒店工作人員在知道孩子情況後問了一句嚴重嗎？然後就沒後話了。後來送來了我要的碘酒棉棍和創可貼。
酒店服務人見到客人不主動問好，看一眼就過去了，當沒看見一樣。網紅科羅納酒吧沒進去，人太多，就遠遠的望了一眼。不太理解有什麼特別的地方就網紅了。在酒店用餐性價比不高。
整體感覺，5星的酒店，3星的服務，酒店名氣在，但是人員服務沒跟上。甚至給人很淡漠的感覺。總體來説還是對的起非旺季的這個價格的。要是旺季2000多一晚，就不值了。
退房的時候會被工作人員要求給全5星好評。如果是為了幫助工作人員完成績效業績，給個全5星問題不大。但是這個全5星給的有多情願就不一定了。酒店安排人員這麼做的意義有多大？以上衹是本次住宿的體會，僅供大家參考。

住在西翼二樓，走下去穿過泳池區就到沙灘了。神州半島這邊沙灘人沒有很多，在海邊逛逛拍拍照躺着很舒服，但是沙灘上有垃圾，雖然已經有人在撿了。
日落吧門口的遮陽傘是不開的，説是因為以前倒下砸到過人。這種因噎廢食的處理方式有點……
早餐週末到11點，適合懶散度假慢悠悠起床吃個brunch，有個海南特色的後安粉挺好吃的。
送的旅拍是五張底片加一個無人機視頻，再多想要就30一張了。攝影師經驗挺豐富的很會指導動作效率很高再加上景色很美幾乎沒有廢片，就是大中午拍的大部分都過曝了。
房間的話冷氣很強，鏡子很多很方便。但是燈比較暗不太喜歡，雙床中間衹有一個插座可以充電有點不方便，然後有看見兩次小飛蟲。
總得來説位置非常好挺適合度假的。

旅酒店在入住前一天會有管家加微信（如果前一天沒有管家加微信，可以打電話給前台説讓管家微信），可以跟管家提前預約項目，就可以第二天帶娃玩啦。重點表揚下管家小吳，服務很好，有什麼需求都可以跟他講，會給我們準備好，整個行程總體很滿意，很開心的一次旅遊。

喜來登並不像網上説的那麼老，衹是這家酒店建立年份較早，他的裝修風格設計是以前的樣子，但環境設定，都非常的紮實。
酒店外面就是沙灘，樓下就是游泳池，簡直不要太愜意了！晚上可以在酒店樓下的沙灘酒吧，喝酒、吃東西，喝醉了5分鐘步行回房間，方便！舒服！這個酒店離各個景點也不遠，正好在中心位置，比如燕子洞，大花角，燈塔，日月灣，等等。
我很享受這個酒店的氛圍和便捷，早上起來，喝了咖啡去樓下游泳，大概遊3、40分鐘，去吃自助早餐。回房間洗個澡，就準備出門去景點玩。晚上回酒店，去樓下沙灘酒吧喝一杯，躺着。
如果還有機會，下次我依然選擇這家酒店。最後再次感謝嚴經理和吳老師貼心、賓至如歸的服務。

雖然酒店有點年頭，但沒有想象中的舊，管理的還挺好，小朋友的活動項目也很豐富～
結論：下次再來神州灣還住喜來登～

衞生：乾淨。

環境：整體還不錯，酒店內部就是日落吧，可惜行程比較緊沒去成。
服務：滿意😀在這裏着重表揚一下小吳管家，熱情，周到，貼心。五星酒店能有的服務一樣沒落，並且很會為客户考慮。很不錯的小夥子👍👍推薦的吃的味道不錯，玩的很好玩。
整體，十分推薦，這次出遊，在萬寧入住三家五星酒店中，喜來登雖然不算最豪華的，卻是入住體驗感最棒的一家，推薦。

msg:酒店坐落於神州半島之畔，環境不錯。酒店的無邊泳池更有自己的特色。酒店早餐品種豐富，現場製作的品種也很多。
酒店房間面積不小，且有陽台。房間小卡片提示，房間物品都已消毒，包括門把手、電視遙控器，體現出酒店精細化的管理。但是房間面積大，電視太小，比例嚴重失調，感覺很醜，這不像知名品牌酒店的手法。況且中老年人看起電視來很費勁，我認為酒店這麼精細化管理，應該考慮到這個問題。問題的關鍵是，我入住的房間電視不但不清楚，中間還有一道如同劃痕的線條，電視是“病態”的，設備處於不完好狀態還再工作！
陽台有茶几，有座椅，喝個茶，聊個天，確實感覺很好。問題是想坐一會，又覺得椅子很贓，為什麼配置了，又不把它搞乾淨些呢？
再説説體驗後酒店的床墊問題，軟且塌陷，如同原來使用很久後的“席夢思”，真的應該換了！
房間電源插座太少，太少了，兩人同時手機充電都很難！希望改進。

酒店的位置極佳，坐落在海邊，讓我每天都能欣賞到壯麗的海景。清晨，一邊品味美食，一邊欣賞海邊的日出，這種體驗真是令人難以忘懷。
酒店的房間寬敞且舒適，裝飾豪華而不失温馨。床鋪柔軟舒適，讓我每晚都能得到充分的休息。浴室設施也非常豪華，讓我感到非常放鬆。
除了舒適的住宿環境，酒店的員工也非常友好和專業。特別是服務專員小林，一對一的服務專業且耐心。他們總是微笑着迎接我，併為我提供周到的服務。無論我有什麼需求，他們都會盡力滿足，讓我感到非常受歡迎。
總的來説，我對喜來登度假酒店的入住體驗感到非常滿意。這裏不僅提供了舒適的住宿環境，還有優質的服務和美麗的海景。我強烈推薦這個酒店給所有想要享受海邊度假的人。

酒店設施整體有些舊，但不影響觀感，很乾凈，功能都比較正常，偶爾有點小問題，也是迅速解決。
工作人員朝氣蓬勃的，很熱情，管家Luna加了微信聯繫，入住的每一天都會親切問候，隨時為我們解答問題和服務。

酒店門口的沙灘和泳池，簡直太棒了，非常乾淨整潔，應該是萬寧附近最好的吧。春節期間萬寧真的很臟，垃圾亂丟，觸目驚心，回到酒店馬上會非常不一樣，沙灘白色細沙近海清澈透亮，因為酒店泳池很大，顯得人也不太多，氣氛很好。但還是要加強管理，最好憑房卡出入。
早餐的海鮮湯粉一絕，太好吃了！然後現烤的小羊角包也是一絕，軟脆香甜。

總之，寶藏酒店。

唯一體驗不是很舒服的是餐廳的服務，有點奇怪，請服務員幫忙多打一份蘸醬，口頭答應了但過了好久沒來，我以為她忘了，一直在熱情的招呼其他桌以及大聲聊天（人不多，加我總共3桌）。再抓到她問的時候，給我答覆是“我們是自助的，我剛才是幫你打過來”……那是不是可以接待我進門的時候就告訴我自助，再問是否需要幫忙、有沒有忌口，而不是先入為主替我調製呢？一上來問我有沒有忌口，然後給了一個蘸碟，很難不以為是湯鍋店那種按份售賣的調好的配套蘸碟。而且我提出需求的時候你應了。點餐也有點奇怪，購買的套餐有不喜歡的菜，打電話預約時問能不能換，接電話的讓我來了再説，他需要跟廚房溝通，到餐廳接待的説“你要提前説，而且我們是套餐不能換”，what？我沒提前提出需求嗎？！打包舀到一半問我“你要多少，這些夠嗎”，我以為餐廳都是把客人購買的食物全部打包。反正這位給我一種穿廉價體恤衫進奢侈品店被銷售隨便接待的感覺。

msg:來萬寧糾結於住神州半島、石梅灣、日月灣之間，最終選擇神州半島喜來登度假酒店，果然讓我們沒失望。住了一晚體驗感超讚於是把後面的行程取消，又續住了一晚。側海景的風景也很棒，酒店小童娛樂活動也不錯，可惜這次沒帶小朋友，下次有機會一定再來。躺在酒店沙灘的日落吧，下午咖啡曬太陽，晚上看着日落星空喝冰啤，十分愜意。比起擁擠的三亞，這裏人不多不少非常棒。感謝管家小吳的熱情貼心服務，從預訂開始就全方位的服務，給這次入住體驗增添了更多的色彩。如果不是小夥伴想去免税店，真想剩下的旅程就在喜來登繼續躺～～～

msg:老牌酒店，各方面都覺得非常舒服，管家小林服務熱情，非常nice。積極主動幫忙協調換房和預訂小朋友趕海，每天詢問入住情況和需求。這是一個可以連續住久一點的酒店，萬寧各海灣逛了一圈，神州半島的海灘最適合孩子玩水，浪花層層疊疊，光踩水就流連忘返了。就是沙灘椅太少了，建議酒店在海邊多增加給酒店客人使用的沙灘椅。小插曲:酒店早餐羊角麪包太好吃了，今早一個沒吃完帶回房間裝在保鮮袋裡，玩海回來發現連袋掉在地上，好奇怪，直到看見地板有泡鳥屎，才發現，小鳥把袋子啄了一個洞，偷吃麪包呢…

回到酒店來説，早餐不錯，就是一大早排隊真的太長了啊。另外在户外看着專屬的私域海灘就很享受。酒店就在景區裏，所以講真，如果衹是想放鬆，在酒店發發呆，到沙灘散散步，晚上看看沖浪板上的勇士們，完美~

一進酒店大堂，我就被其富麗堂皇的裝飾所吸引。酒店的整體設計風格高雅且充滿現代感，每一個細節都展現出酒店的品質與品味。無論是大堂的佈局、燈光的色調，還是傢俱的搭配，都讓人感覺舒適與愉悦。
選擇喜來登度假酒店的一大原因是其一流的餐飲服務。在這裏，我品嚐到了來自世界各地的美食。而且，酒店六家餐廳都提供了絕佳的用餐環境，無論是室內還是户外，都能欣賞到美麗的風景。

環境很好，房間的設施是經典的喜來登風格，我之前看到很多網上人説是比較老舊，但是我覺得挺不錯的。
實名感謝我們的管家小吳！第一次來就是小吳來接待，感受非常好，第二次果斷還是選擇了小吳！也謝謝酒店和小吳幫我們升級了房型，升級了以後的視野真的很不錯！另外，我在這個期間又因為生理期想喝紅糖水，問小吳，小吳也很快地想辦法幫我解決了，非常貼心！
另外，因為到的第一天下雨了，所以我們是在酒店的中餐廳吃的，食物的味道還不錯，但就是有一丟丟慢，我猜可能是因為下雨，導致那天餐廳人特別多，希望以後可以視情況而定多安排點人昂。
總體來説，每次入住神州半島喜來登酒店都是一個很好的體驗！另外從房間走到海邊也就兩三分鐘，非常近，這一點是讓我每次都感歎真的很方便的部分！
下次來萬寧還是會來住的，還是要再找小吳的哈哈哈！

這裏的員工很敬業，每個人都對工作很認真，可以感受到他們的精神上時刻準備着的緊張感，同時接觸下來又會發現他們認真和真誠。管家嘉嘉很貼心，比我更瞭解小朋友的喜好，知道小盆友喜歡泡澡主動詢問我是否需要一次性的浴缸套，這個細節真的超出我的預期。每天看到她都是忙忙碌碌的，但是我説房間需要幾瓶水這種小事，訊息剛發過去，立刻回覆安排，事情有求必應。小姑娘加油！看好你呦～！

位置好，有酒店私人海灘。
親子項目極多，非常充實的一站式帶娃。很省心。
房間在一樓，走出去就是沙灘 非常方便。
吃的就略欠缺一些。
早餐廳（西餐廳）吃的一般
中餐廳還不錯，服務也很好。
户外的日落餐廳288一位，吃的如圖6 不建議吃，小酒精燈涮不熟就得壞肚子。即便主打環境 餐食也是異常的差。
隔壁corona的精釀ipa不錯。

吐槽下攜程，價格貴也來越不厚道，別的平台有比這便宜的 大家可以多看看

酒店的周邊也沒啥配套，停車場大的無法無天的，和福朋喜來登合用一個院子一個車場。保安根本不清楚地下車場有多少車位空餘，讓我一進來就進去停車。找了兩圈上來，我問他去哪裡停車，他還問我地下沒了麼？讓我出去酒店停路邊。總體來説服務很差。
因為旺季也接待了太多團隊遊客了。服務跟不上也正常。
