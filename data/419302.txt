msg:The room was huge and a comfortable stay. However the block of the room was not connected to the hotel lobby. It was a short walk. Unfortunately I was traveling with my elderly parents with my mom who doesn’t walk very well. It was difficult. The restaurants were right at the opposite end of from our block. I did ask if the hotel can send buggy for my mom but they said it is only for block 9. The shuttle to the zoo is a short walk but again a distance for my mom. It brings you to the South Gate but you need to change another shuttle to the north gate if you want to take the train in the zoo. The circus is about 8-10mins walk for us but for my mom it was a good 20mins slow walk. Thankfully the security guard help my mom cross the road opening the railing on the side of the road so she doesn’t have to climb the stairs up and down the overhead bridge. But overall, I concluded that this is not exactly an elderly friendly hotel. I will probably reconsider staying here with elderly. I’m very sure that children will love the hotel though.

The hotel is in a great location where we can enter the wildlife park and the bird park easily. The girls enjoyed watching the tigers and red flamingoes at the hotel.

msg:Arrived very late after having cancelled a booking in a nearby apartment, we were lucky to have the room upgraded to a twin suite. Large, beautiful, very convenient for a family. Maybe the living room could have been decorated with more themed items. The whole concept of the Hotel is very well organized around the Safari Park. Tigers in the garden and even in the central atrium of the breakfast restaurant. Huge hotel, very crowded even in the weekdays. That makes the breakfast moment a bit confusing. Offer is rich, quality is ok, but not at the level of a 5-star Hotel.

msg:Very nice and spacious hotel. Service is amazing and we have booked a huge room. Great place to be with your family. There are zoo animals within the hotel premises (tigers, birds, flamingos, etc.) and the hotel is surrounded by nature. It gives you a feeling that you are in the jungle. Breakfast was very good and there were many both Chinese and "western" options. It had its own transportation to the Chimelong parks and the Circus was located right beside it. Tickets purchase could be done in the hotel and there is a Kids club for the children to play. The location is great for the Chimelong visitors, but it is a little bit far from the main city attractions. There are some restaurant options within the hotel but for more variety, a 15-25 minutes taxi ride would have to be taken.

msg:Because the international flight was delayed for three days, we left our luggage at the airport and headed to Chimelong~

When I first chose the hotel, I was very confused about Chimelong Hotel and Panda Hotel. Later, my children still liked the style and a**osphere of Chimelong Hotel.
We were not disappointed when we arrived at the hotel!
The check-in was very smooth. Several ladies at the front desk worked together to help us check in one after another. Many matters were explained very clearly, which was great👍
Unexpectedly, they also helped us upgrade the room, which was a surprise!
(One room has two cards, which is really user-friendly and convenient)

The room is very spacious and the big balcony is very cool! Standing on the balcony, you can hear the birds singing in the woods, so comfortable!
Every corner of the room is very clean, and the toiletries are really cute and easy to use!
The weather is very hot, and it is really great that the room has unlimited drinking water👏

"Wild Animal Island" is very popular with children~
You can get close to animal friends in the hotel's grove!
Very interesting experience!

Because we didn't bring swimsuits, we didn't plan to go to the water park, but there was an extra bathtub in the room, which the children loved and were very happy!
Because we came here with only a backpack and didn't bring anything, we went out to play all day and returned to the hotel. We ordered a lot of "room gifts" (a bit embarrassed 😅), but the room lady still delivered them to the room enthusiastically and patiently helped me solve the Wi-Fi problem, which was great☺️

After returning to the hotel and taking a bath in the evening, the child was hungry again, so he scanned the code to order milk and French fries, which were delivered to the room in half an hour👌
🥛The pure milk is very fresh and tastes good
🍟The French fries are so delicious, the skin is very crispy and crispy, and the inside is very soft (a bit like the taste of mashed potatoes), with clear layers. It should be fried with fresh potatoes. It's so delicious that I can't stop eating it. The super large plate was swept away by the baby~😋

The buffet breakfast at the "White Tiger Restaurant" that we are looking forward to is also very good!
The left and right sides of the restaurant are the Chinese and Western food areas, and the two floor-to-ceiling glass areas are the white tiger viewing area and the flamingo and scarlet ibis. It is indeed more delicious to dine with animal friends🤭

Check-out is very convenient. Just put the room card into the small box for room card recycling and you can leave~

Turn right and you can reach the shuttle bus station;
Exit the back door and cross the overpass to the "Big Circus" and "Happy World"!

The white tiger buffet breakfast restaurant is very popular with children because they can "learn from each other and eat" face to face with the white tiger. The restaurant has Kaka puppet tiger interactions and clown performances. In this weather, the most important thing is that the hotel has an adequate supply of mineral water! No worries! The staff everywhere in the hotel can answer your questions in time! It's really good

The hotel has complete facilities, and the self-service check-in process is very fast. The room number will be sent directly by SMS. The hotel has complete facilities, cute toiletries, and Chimelong mascots, which children like very much. The location is very superior, and the big circus can be reached on foot. If you bring children for convenient travel, it is the first choice. The service in the hotel is also very timely and in place. You only need to throw the room card into the corresponding bucket to check out conveniently. The lobby of the hotel is very popular with children, and the atmosphere is very good and lively. Manager Dong has a good attitude and is very friendly. He answered me very carefully and told us the route to play in the park. The work efficiency is high and I am very satisfied! Hotel catering: The buffet is delicious, with many varieties and great taste. The breakfast restaurant has white tigers and flamingos to see! There is also a food town that can be ordered a la carte. The taste is very Guangdong-style. The town does not charge service fees. The price-performance ratio is good and it is also very convenient to eat. After the meal, it only takes one overpass to go to the circus. I like it and will bring my children again!

msg:Oh my god... I checked in at the hotel at 12 o'clock, then stored my luggage and went to the water park. I came back to the room after 4 o'clock. I upgraded to a wild big bed room for free. I would like to thank the lady at the front desk of the hotel.
But the room is really hard to describe. We lived on the 3rd floor of Building 6. It was very humid and had a musty smell. The air conditioner was always on and the humidity was still very high. There was no dehumidifier in the room. How can I describe the musty smell? It has affected my breathing and sleep. I went back to the room at 9 o'clock in the evening to take a shower and sleep. I almost didn't fall asleep all night and felt like I couldn't breathe. Fortunately, I only booked one night, just for the ticket to play in the park for 2 days. Because I brought children with me, I only went to the water park and the safari park for the children's interests. It is still very suitable for bringing children to play.

msg:The shuttle bus to the park is very convenient and can drive directly to the hotel. The surrounding ecological environment is very good. There is mosquito repellent in the room, which is very thoughtful. You don't have to worry about the children being bitten by mosquitoes. It only takes 10 minutes to watch the big circus from the second lobby of the hotel at night. I played for two days and three nights, and the children were very happy. I have to say that the little animals in Chimelong are so happy. The national treasures have ice beds worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. The living environment of the little animals in each area is very good. There are also nannies to answer the children's questions, which is particularly good. The ceiling of domestic zoos. I didn't have time to play in Happy World and Bird Park. I will arrange it next time. The overall experience is very good.

msg:This is the third time for our family to visit Chimelong Hotel. We have seen the circus, the zoo, the Bird Park, and the Happy World. We are very grateful to Yang Lu of Chimelong Hotel for contacting us in advance and giving us suggestions on what to do. Liu Yunlin checked us in, Jian Yi checked us out, and the staff of the Snow Tiger Park were very busy, especially Huang Mingbing, Hong Tao, and Xianhui who were very patient and treated us very well! The service of Chimelong Hotel is down-to-earth, warm, attentive and thoughtful, with many choices of meals. The dinner at the White Tiger Buffet Restaurant is great, and you can watch white tigers and flamingos while eating. The Cantonese-style morning tea in the Chinese restaurant tastes quite good. Our family had a great time and lived comfortably! It's a good choice to choose Chimelong!

We stayed at Chimelong Hotel for three days and two nights, and the hotel thoughtfully upgraded us to the White Tiger Room. We could see the white tiger from the balcony, and we could visit the four parks unlimited times, which was very convenient. The water park and Happy Valley were right outside the back door of the hotel. My sister was very happy because it had her favorite Eggsy theme, and the electronic music festival was really exciting. The hotel staff were also very enthusiastic. In a word, it was a super happy trip. The hotel room was very big and really comfortable. I loved it.

There is also a shuttle bus to the safari park, the arrangement is very smooth 💛 The room design is also great and joyful, with a terrace overlooking the inner garden swimming pool. The accommodation package includes 4 admission tickets for two people, which is impossible to finish in two days🤣 Three days and two nights will make it easier to arrange your time👍🏻 It also comes with a white tiger buffet breakfast. The food quality is good, and you can see the white tiger through the glass!

msg:Facilities: Although it is a hotel under Chimelong that was built a long time ago, the hardware and software facilities are very complete. The shower water is very big and hot, the mattress is comfortable, and there are shoe-changing stools, cartoon hangers, small slippers, etc. specially equipped for children in the room. Most of the hotels are families with children. These details show that they are attentive. Hygiene: clean and reassuring. Environment: The hotel is very large. You can see tigers in the lobby. You can also see white tigers, macaws and flamingos at different seats in the restaurant. Clowns often appear to interact with guests, full of childlike fun. Service: Before going, I saw online that the service was indifferent, but everyone I met in three days was very enthusiastic and answered all questions. The hotel was large and often got lost. Everyone would enthusiastically help you find the way and answer questions, which made us feel the hospitality and enthusiasm of Guangzhou people. 3 days and 2 nights for two people to play 3 parks unlimitedly: very convenient. The hotel needs to go out of the No. 2 lobby and cross a skybridge to get to Happy World and Circus City, but it is not far to walk, just a few minutes. You need a shuttle bus to the zoo. There will be a small confirmation slip printed when checking in. You must bring it with you to prove that you are a hotel guest. There are discounts for buying speed passes.

You can get close to white tigers and flamingos while eating. I booked the Chimelong Circus, which is also very close to the hotel, a 10-minute walk. Although the water park is very close, I didn't experience it due to weather reasons. I chose to walk around the Chimelong Zoo. There is a bus at the door of the hotel that can reach the south gate of the Chimelong Zoo, which is also very convenient.

msg:The trip to Chimelong that my child had been looking forward to finally came true. We chose to stay at Chimelong Hotel mainly because it was more convenient. We booked a hunting twin room for three days and two nights. Thank you for upgrading it when we checked in. We checked in at 10 a.m., which saved us the trouble of storing our luggage. Although there were reports of heavy rain and rainstorms in the past few days, it was actually just a few showers of light rain, sometimes very heavy, but it stopped after a while. It was a blessing from God. There was no scorching sun or queuing, which was quite pleasant. We basically played everything. There was also a big circus, which I strongly recommend. If you have the chance, book the VIP interactive area

msg:I bought a two-day, one-night package and went there early in the morning. The check-in environment is OK. There are fewer people on weekends, so it's still a bit rushed. The waiter, Aunt Zhou Lianrong, is still good. She also provides fruits. It's a bit cold after swimming in the water park, so she gave me a few more sets of robes and slippers.
But the 2,000 yuan package is a bit of a pit. Everyone should see clearly that although it is a parent-child trip, the package does not include children's tickets (the two children spent nearly 500 yuan on the zoo alone, nearly 200 yuan on the bird park alone, and 196 yuan on breakfast), which is not cost-effective. The hotel is decorated in an old style. The hotel customer service staff is very strong. After all, I took my children there, and several projects did not include children, but I spent so much more. It is said that you can bring children, no more than 3 years old, and you have to pay separately if you are over 3 years old.
It is very different from the Yaduo I stayed at the day before. The service attitude is very good, and they actively send children breakfast coupons. The service is in place.

The balcony garden view is green and the sound insulation effect is very good.
The park is very, very large, and there is a free direct bus to the scenic spot. The hotel staff will also teach everyone how to play time-saving and fun. The weather was bad these two days, it rained heavily, and there was no time to play all the parks. I look forward to going again next time

msg:Overall, the experience of this stay was very good. I bought a 3-day, 2-night, 3-park package.
1. First of all, the hotel's environment and facilities are very good. Clean and considerate (children's pillows, toothbrushes, etc.), the buffet restaurant has white tigers, flamingos 🦩 (alive!) and other animals that can be watched up close while dining.
2. The essence of Chimelong is still animals. There are so many animals from the five continents here that I can't count them all. Animal World and the Big Circus are must-see projects (especially the Big Circus! Big Circus! Big Circus!), and secondly, Bird Park is mainly bird-based, with a little keeper project, which allows children to feed and feel the animals up close. In addition, Happy World is still worth a visit compared to large amusement parks in China. The mecha parade is very realistic and very fun!
3. It's not just a play, but also a study tour. It has great educational significance for children to understand nature and the world, and some adults do too. I haven't seen many animals.
4. Points that can be improved: There are many mosquitoes at night, and they bit me a lot of big bags, and the bags are still big! ; Take-out food could not be delivered; the intervals between shuttle buses between parks were large (this may also have led to temporary adjus**ents in scheduling as there were not many people entering the park after May 1st); the birthday discount policy was not clearly stated on the app mini program, and the right of interpretation was given to the site. Many of the discounts we thought we got were not what we thought when we arrived at the site.

The hotel swimming pool in summer is very comfortable for adults and children to play happily. The hotel's breakfast is also very rich. The 3-day and 2-night park plus hotel package is much more affordable than buying it alone. The price-performance ratio is super good. It is a three-day pleasant park tour! The hotel guest service staff Shelley Liu is very considerate and provides thoughtful service to help solve the problem of staying in the hotel. The hotel provides a clean and hygienic children's playground for children. The hotel is in a good location and is very close to the water park. It is OK to walk into the park. The children are super happy. The room bathroom has children's toilet washers, children's bathrobes, slippers, instant hot water, unobstructed sewers, and clean room walls! You can go to various parks by taking the hotel's free bus. Parking at the hotel is also free. The hotel also has a souvenir shop. Hotel guests have discounts. Overall, it is great and recommended to stay.

There is also a children's playground on the underground first floor, which can be visited on rainy days.
Convenient travel, there are shuttle buses to the three major parks, which run every 10 minutes, and you can come back to rest at noon with your children.
There is a lot of breakfast, but compared with other five-star hotels, it should be considered average. Qilin Chinese Restaurant is not bad, but it is more expensive, and there is a 15% service fee. It is more cost-effective to buy discounts from group buying platforms. You can see various animals in the restaurant.
The service is good. There are few people these days, and the service quality is guaranteed.

Tickets for Children's Fun Park: Children's Fun Park is not big, but there are many service staff. Parents are most concerned about safety. They can remind children not to take pictures randomly, not to fight, and put away toys in time to prevent children from stepping on them and falling.

There is an animal island inside the hotel, with many kinds of rare birds, and there is a passage that leads directly to the water park! It is more than one kilometer away from the animal world and it is very convenient to travel! This trip was completed by accidentally staying in this hotel.

msg:3 days and 2 nights unlimited access to 4 parks (Animal World + Happy World + Bird Park + Water Park) for two people + free 200 yuan dining coupon: The hotel is in a prime location and is one of the earliest hotels in the park. The special feature is the white tiger breakfast. It was a bit damp when I first lived on the shady side... After communicating with the service center, I was moved to the sunny side and it was very dry and cool. People in the north can't stand the dampness. The overall feeling is very good, the room is large and the children's products are very complete, and there are small stools. A very satisfying experience.

At night, you can see the electronic music performance and fireworks of the water park from the window. I also like the White Tiger Restaurant in the morning. You can eat while watching the big tiger. The durian pastry is especially delicious. There is unlimited entry and exit to the three parks. I didn't have time to go to the water world. I felt that I didn't have enough fun. I also want to add that the shuttle bus is convenient. It's great that we can check in directly before going out to play when we arrive in the morning. It's also progress that we can go to express delivery. The food in the Rainbow Restaurant is also good.

msg:I booked three days and two nights on Ctrip. It was a good deal with breakfast and unlimited entry and exit tickets to the three parks. The hotel is very large, with several buildings. Although it is not the peak season, there are still quite a lot of people staying. I arrived at the hotel before two o'clock that day. Check-in was very fast, and I could check in as soon as a room was available. The concierge helped deliver the luggage to the room. . Although I stayed in Building 5, I had to go through a garden to get there from the lobby, and it was a little further away from the White Tiger Restaurant. But opposite Building 5 was the shuttle bus station to the Wildlife Park and Bird Paradise. This was very convenient and the room was big. , there is a balcony that can be opened, but the overall feeling is still a bit old. I sat on the seat next to the white tiger for breakfast and enjoyed it while eating. The hotel staff were warm and thoughtful, there were performances in the lobby, and there were shops in the hotel for shopping. It was a bit like a small Venetian design. It's just that it's inconvenient to get takeout. You need to take a shuttle bus to the entrance of the resort. Some people say that I waited in line for half an hour for the shuttle bus. I was lucky. I waited for one minute at a time and ten minutes at a time. The person who took the takeout Quite a few. If the supporting services can keep up, such as more shuttle buses, the experience will be better. In three days, we visited the Safari Park, Happy World, Bird Paradise, and the Circus. I bought VIP seats with no obstructions. I was very satisfied with this trip. My children loved it. Guangzhou Chimelong is worth a visit.

Service: The hunting room I booked was upgraded to a wild fun room for free. The room was large, and the two kids could chase each other without any obstacles. It was also clean in all aspects.

Because it was my birthday, I was given a birthday cake. There were free photos at Happy World, and there was another small cake. You could choose three out of 6 to avoid queuing. Remember that there are many birthday benefits, so be sure to ask.

In addition, the breakfast buffet at the White Tiger Restaurant is really rich and tastes good. It’s worth it!

Thanks to Chimelong for the happiness. Adults and children had a lot of fun.

Compared with the Panda Hotel where I stayed last time, the rooms in Chimelong Hotel are bigger and more comfortably decorated, making it suitable for a family vacation. Outside the balcony are lush trees and unidentified animals chirping softly, as if you were in a rain forest with extremely high negative ion content. You must experience the White Tiger Buffet Restaurant. There is also a white tiger feeding activity at around 8 o'clock in the morning. It is a rare experience to enjoy the food while having breakfast. In addition, you can take photos with the white tiger dolls in the restaurant, and you don't have to queue in the off-season.

Disposable slippers, shower gels, and shampoos are all for children. It can be seen that they are very attentive to customers. This time, I took my children to travel in a staggered manner. The experience was very good. The hotel gave me unlimited tickets for two days and four parks. Although the water park was not open for maintenance, I didn't have time to play even if it was open. I went to the zoo and the big circus on the first day, and went to Bird Park and Happy World on the second day. There were many projects in Happy World that I didn't have time to play. Next time, I still recommend three days and two nights. The price is not much more expensive, and it is very cost-effective to play one more day. You can order takeout for food. Although you can't go directly to the hotel, the hotel is equipped with a battery car for round-trip transportation, which is still very humane. I have to give them a thumbs up! The attitude of the entire hotel and scenic area service staff is very good, and they are all very qualified. This time, Chimelong was not in vain. The children received a lot and met many animals. A good experience! Next time I have a chance to go to Zhuhai Chimelong and see the Ocean World.

The baby is a little acclimated and vomits without eating early in the morning. I was so disappointed during the trip ~ Fortunately, the hotel front desk upgraded us to a (birthday month and member) room, and then we could check in immediately and the baby could go directly to the hotel to rest. 👍🏻The room is large and very clean...it has a balcony and a bathtub🛁Disposable bath mats and toilet mats can be provided. You can call the service desk to have it delivered. Babies can also help install the fence to prevent falls. The service is very historical and will be delivered within 15 minutes. The White Tiger buffet breakfast the next morning was also great👍🏻To get takeout, you have to walk to the Panda Hotel to get it. There is also a bus at the door but you need to wait. Therefore, it is more convenient to book a hotel with children that includes breakfast. There are buses to various scenic spots and subway stations, leaving every 15 minutes. You can also directly drop the starting price which is also very convenient. Next time I come, I hope to upgrade to a room decorated with small animals. ✌🏻

The hotel design style fits the characteristics of the zoo. From check-in to check-out, all kinds of software and hardware services are great. Shelley Liu, the guest service, is warm and thoughtful, provides accommodation assistance, and arranges the room intimately. The children like the White Tiger Restaurant very much. They can watch the animals while eating. There are puppets to interact with during the period. There are also performances in the lobby when checking in. The entertainment a**osphere is very good. The room is cost-effective. The configuration of the large balcony expands the activity space and feeling. The room with a bathtub is cost-effective. The cartoon-themed toiletries and the clothes hanger towels with cute animal patterns, the exclusive small stool make the children love it, and it is clean and tidy. The highlight of the hotel is the animal island, birds, animals and tigers, which integrates science popularization and viewing. The parent-child tour is very good. The children also have a lot of fun in the hotel children's playground. If you have time, you must come to stay again. Choose a three-day and two-night package to experience the happy parent-child time again.

The package of 3 scenic spots + the hotel children's playground was not wasted at all. We went to Bird Park and Happy World on the first day. The children could play until the park closed at 21:00. On the second day, we stayed in the Wildlife Park for a day. There were many places to play and animals to see, and no one felt tired. The children liked the simulated dinosaurs the most and visited them twice! In addition, both the hotel and the scenic spot have wifi, so there is no need to worry about traffic, which is great! 👍

The time was a bit rushed, so I only watched the bird park, the wildlife park and the big circus performance. The children love the big circus very much. The children in the wildlife park broke their legs because they walked too fast. The queues for the small train and the aerial cable car are long on weekends. I will stay for two days next time...

msg:Excluding the two two-day tickets included in the package, the family room is 1000+ per room, which is actually a good price. Although Chimelong Hotel cannot be compared with other hotels as a theme park hotel, the basic elements of a hotel cannot be missing. The biggest problem here is that it is both huge and old... and it also has overloaded services.

I booked a new room type for three days, the family room for exploring fun. I had great expectations, but they disappeared the moment I walked in. The moment the elevator door opened, I saw the oldness everywhere. That's fine. The moment the room door opened, a musty smell of decoration was indistinguishable, filling my nasal cavity. The front desk said that the parent-child room could not be adjusted, so they asked the customer service to spray air freshener. The customer service came in and said that it was the odor produced by a bowl of soba noodles we put on the table. In the end, the odor was replaced by air freshener, but at my request, an air purifier was brought. But the cleaning aunt cut off all the electricity after cleaning the next day. The air conditioner and air purifier were all turned off, and it was done again after returning to the room.

The room was very humid, mainly because the air conditioner could not have a dehumidification function. The bathroom was also very simple, and there was no bathtub in the parent-child room. The children's stools were so dirty...

The service is not good either. From the beginning of check-in, there was no introduction. You need to pay for the tickets on the first floor. It ended at 8 o'clock. The lady who exchanged the tickets was very nice. We didn't go on the first day and changed it to the third day. It was very flexible and humane. It is said that the room cleaning service is only available on the first day. If you stay for more than two days, you have to ask for it to be cleaned. You need to take a shuttle bus to order takeout, and you have to queue for the shuttle bus. It takes a while to find takeout, and you have to wait for another one on the way back! I simply can't understand that such a large-scale giant hotel can't have an independent takeout place within walking distance?

The biggest value here is the tickets to the three parks. My little fat man and I have been visiting for three days, and we haven't visited the zoo and Bird Park. But after taking the shuttle bus from the hotel to the zoo and Bird Park on the first day, we took a taxi by ourselves. The main reason is that the queue is too long. If there are a few people, they will queue everywhere, and all the energy is used to queue. If you are not too busy, you can take a taxi directly to the north gate and take the small train as soon as you enter. I still think this is the best way to play. If you enter the park from the south gate, you have to walk a little to get to the essence of the park, which is too tiring to walk your kids.

The main reason for staying here is to save the trouble of finding a guide. According to the driver of the special car, it is difficult for the Panda Hotel to get good reviews. Let's lower our expectations. Chimelong lost a lot in the past few years. The past two years have been a ** time...

msg:We flew to Guangzhou with our kids in thunderstorm weather. Since we had to go to Chimelong Safari Park, staying at Chimelong Hotel was the only choice. As my kid was prone to motion sickness, we gave up the opportunity to call a taxi or the free shuttle bus. We walked from the subway station to the hotel, and then from the hotel to the zoo, back and forth N times. Although our legs were sore, the air and environment were still good. The hotel environment was very pristine and the jungle style was very nice. When the receptionist on the day of check-in heard that I mentioned that my child's skin was affected by weather and environmental factors, she not only upgraded it to a parent-child room for me, but also specially arranged it upstairs in the hotel's medical office so that the child could get help in time if he had any problems. I liked the warm-hearted operation. After entering the room, I found that the facilities were indeed old, but as long as the kid was happy, these details were not worth mentioning. Of course, I also found some minor flaws in the room. After reporting to the front desk, the logistics manager of the building came to deal with it immediately. And arranged maintenance, the efficiency is quite fast. The day before leaving the hotel, I consulted the hotel information desk with a try-and-see attitude. After hearing about my baby's situation, they were also willing to help us open an exclusive route. Today, they specially arranged a cheerful guy to send us off. My baby and I are very satisfied. I like it again manually. I take this opportunity to comment and expose the three caring and good employees I met in the past two days (see picture 8. If you see this comment, you can find them if you are lucky enough to stay at Chimelong Hotel. I personally tested it). This time, there are good and bad ones. For example, I met a lot of employees who smiled but didn't smile in the hotel, and there were employees who complained about the hotel management problems in front of the guests, and they felt reluctant because of a few blunt words after doing satisfactory things for the guests, etc., seeing that the baby was very happy this time, I won't care about these. Overall, I still give a 5-star praise! I hope I can feel more happiness when I bring my baby next time!

Although we were given ordinary tickets, we went early and sat in the second row of E2. The performance was exciting and shocking! The 3-year-old Erbao was fascinated by it all the time, and the 7-year-old Dabao was not surprised at all. He didn't close his mouth and kept asking his mother which show he thought was the most exciting. The next morning, we drove directly into the zoo for a self-driving close-up viewing of various animals. Later, we also checked in for white tiger diving, golden snake exploration, and Jurassic Park. However, we encountered heavy rain at noon and had to leave the park early. Unfortunately, there were still many places we didn't go. We lived in Building 5 of Chimelong Hotel, with three adults and two children. When the waiter Aunt Zhou Lianrong added a bed to our room, she added slippers and other utensils, cleaned up the garbage, and specially gave the two treasures small gifts. I was very happy!

When the baby came home, she said that she would stay at the Chimelong Hotel next time because there are animals in the hotel! ! ! We were upgraded to a wild room, where the children could soak in the bathtub, play in the water, and see tigers and birds in the room. The children were very happy. The hotel is like a small zoo with many programs. In the lobby and restaurant, Kakachichi and Poppy Clown will interact with children, as well as social dancing and African drums. The hotel is big, there are many green plants, and there are many areas. My child said it was like an adventure and she visited the whole place. Thanks to the brother who helped us arrange the room and the sister who responded enthusiastically. They didn’t leave their names, but the arrangement was really good. Anyone would come here many times for such service! ! ! Also, you don’t necessarily only look at the price on the official website. When I compared it, I found that Ctrip’s price was more cost-effective than the official website. Both the elderly and children were very happy during this trip, so I felt relieved. Come to Chimelong Hotel next time🏨

First of all, let me say that the service at Chimelong Hotel is really outstanding. From check-in to check-out, the hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly, making you feel right at home.

Service: The staff here are very enthusiastic. When you enter the door, clowns and dolls will greet you, which immediately arouses your interest in playing. Then check-in, concierge, storage, and check-out were all very good and orderly.
Room: When we arrived at the hotel, we upgraded the room type for free and stayed in a parent-child room. It was a big holiday and even had a small balcony. The most important thing is that there is a tent bed, which the children really love. Offer to sleep on your own crib! You know, for a child who has to sleep with his parents every day, this is really exciting for the mother! And slept soundly all night.
Package: I only went to the zoo this time. There is a free bus connecting directly to the hotel, which is very convenient. The package we bought also came with two tickets to the hotel's amusement park. This amusement park is simply a paradise for children. Before our baby left, we had to go to the amusement park for 40 minutes against all odds. This is definitely the best place to bring your baby. Hotel
Catering: I had breakfast and dinner here. On the one hand, it is convenient, and on the other hand, the taste is really good.

Finally, when saying goodbye to the hotel, the children were reluctant to leave and were reluctant in every possible way. I had to tell him that we would come again during the Chinese New Year! Of course, there is also a small regret that the room I stayed in this time did not have a fish tank for bathing. I hope I can book one next time.

Bird Paradise is relatively far away. Not in the park. The unlimited tickets provided by staying in the hotel are a great value. My child is 8 years old and is too tired from playing all the time. We played a round in the morning and went back to the hotel to rest at noon. We entered the park again at 4:30 in the afternoon and felt very good. One point I want to complain about is that the soundproofing is so-so. You can clearly hear the shouts of the Happy Park roller coaster and the sound of the circus performance in the room.

However, there is a problem, that is, the scenic spots are far apart, especially the Bird Paradise, which feels like entering a village. There is another episode here. After returning from Bird Paradise, I told the guide to go back to the hotel, but I was guided to the wrong bus. I was dragged to a subway station with my two children. It was not convenient to get off and take a taxi, which was quite depressing. In addition, eating in the hotel is too expensive, and it is inconvenient to get food from outside. You have to take a shuttle bus and go to a place near the Panda Hotel to get food from outside. Finally, there are too many people during the holidays, and the experience in several parks is not very good. There are so many people that it only counts the number of people. Compared with Zhuhai Chimelong, it still lacks highlights, such as whale sharks, and the fireworks show is very shocking. I haven’t seen the circus, but I have seen the one in Zhuhai. It is in a smaller venue. I think the audio-visual effect should be better if you watch it up close. In addition, nearby hotels such as The interactive activities in the Penguin Hotel, the setting up of takeaway points, the setting up of a large number of guides in the hotel and scenic spots every day, especially the guidance work after large-scale events, are all busy and orderly. A few meters away there is an usher holding a sign, and it is still like this at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening, very dedicated.

It is next to the zoo. There is a park bus to pick up and drop off. It is also convenient to take a taxi. The hotel environment is good. Due to special circumstances, extra bed service is required and will be provided quickly! The room is large enough. The hotel staff are also very good.

It is very comfortable to sleep two adults and one child. It matches the upper and lower children's beds. It’s really enough for a three-child family. The room cleanliness is also good. There are shuttle buses to the three parks, and the restaurants in the hotel are sufficient and the taste is good. However, it is still recommended to rent a car, because the taxi fare from Baiyun to Chimelong is more than 200, and it is more convenient to drive to several parks by yourself, especially the wildlife park where you can drive into the park and see animals up close! Then Chimelong went out to Nansha, Yuyin Shanfang and the Erling Museum of the Southern Han Dynasty, which are all worth visiting.
Let's talk about some minor flaws. The hotel's service attitude is quite good, but the air conditioner is not good and cannot lower the temperature, so the clothes are not easy to dry, and it is very hot to sleep at night. . . It is recommended to provide thin quilts. . .

msg:I have brought my children to Chimelong for many years in a row, and the management of both the hotel and the park is textbook level. As the Spring Festival is approaching, there are many people, but it does not affect the customer experience at all. Whether it is the check-in or check-out service at the front desk, or the breakfast buffet in the morning at the White Tiger Flamingo Restaurant, no matter how many guests there are, no matter how long the queue is, the whole process is orderly, and every service staff has a smile on their face. Regardless of children or adults, you can feel the enthusiasm of every handsome and beautiful waiter in Chimelong. This time I was very surprised to find that in addition to the snow tiger in the hotel lobby atrium, there is also a large garden behind the snow tiger, the "Animal Island". When taking a walk after dinner, it is quiet and comfortable. Every bird island is clean, and there is no bird on it. Fallen feathers and bird poop. It's a pity that we checked out today and then went to Zhuhai Chimelong, otherwise the Komodo dragon would be displayed in the hotel in the afternoon.

msg:I went to Zhuhai Chimelong last summer and stayed at the Hengqin Bay Hotel. The children had a lot of fun playing there, so I want to come to Guangzhou Chimelong during this winter vacation. Unfortunately, I'm still a bit disappointed. There will be a lot of people during the winter and summer vacations, so I can't help it (be mentally prepared). It feels very chaotic when you enter the lobby. The check-in speed is not very fast, and the queue to store and collect luggage takes a long time. This time I stayed in family room 8701 for two days. The room was not ready until about four o'clock. When entering the room, the decoration smell was very strong. Basically, the air conditioner was turned on and the balcony door was blowing for the past two days. The TV in the room still had no signal and could not be watched. If I come to Guangzhou again during the winter and summer vacations, I probably won’t consider living in Chimelong.

When I checked in, I was told that there were only two breakfasts. There was no breakfast for children, and they would have to pay if they were more than one meter tall (this is understandable). But they asked me to go to the first floor to measure my height. Why do they ask guests to spend time to measure themselves when checking in? Tall, he should be over one meter tall when having breakfast the next day, so you have to pay on the spot. As a result, I was told that in this case, there would be an additional service fee. The breakfast fee for a child was 89 yuan, and there was also a service fee. This was seriously inconsistent with industry regulations and there were cases of arbitrary charges. In other hotels, children under 1.2m usually have free breakfast. Super bad stay experience. Extremely not recommended

There are also white tigers and flamingos in the hotel that can be seen up close. The hotel regularly has some interactive performances, and the a**osphere is there, making it worth staying.

Suggestion: The food in the hotel is mediocre, and the room in Building 9 is far away. If you don’t come often, you might get dizzy. Takeaway cannot be delivered to the room, so you have to make a special appoin**ent to wait for the shuttle bus, which is quite troublesome.

There is a welcome drink, free soda and beer in the refrigerator, and the most surprising thing is that there is free fruit every day. . . The room includes a white tiger buffet breakfast, and you can watch the white tiger eating breakfast. Zhongyou provides a children's playground (on the b1 floor of the hotel) every day, which is more exciting for children. The hotel is close to Happy World and Circus, and you need to take the shuttle to the zoo.

msg:When the little potato from the south went to the northeast, I came to Guangzhou from Shenyang.

I booked an executive twin room at Chimelong Hotel on Ctrip. After arriving at the hotel, the enthusiastic front desk lady upgraded me to a suite. The reservation also includes unlimited tickets for three people to play in 3 parks for 3 days and 2 nights, a 200 yuan dining voucher, and an afternoon meal. With tea and many other perks, I personally think it’s worth flying here from out of town to book a hotel package.

Among the Chimelong Hotel, Panda Hotel and Xiangjiang Hotel in the resort, Chimelong Hotel is the first choice. Chimelong Hotel is the closest to Happy World and has the most complete supporting facilities. Personally, I feel that Xiangjiang is the least worth considering among the three if you have children. If so, consider Panda Hotel.

The overall decoration of the hotel room is in Southeast Asian style. The suite is spacious and bright. It feels great to open the window and see tropical plants. The indoor and outdoor hygiene is very good, and the service staff is warm and polite.

The hotel's breakfast is rich in Chinese and Western varieties and tastes very good, but the lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant's own expense are not cost-effective and on the expensive side. The Chinese restaurant

In addition, when visiting Chimelong, most people travel with children, so the hotel will be a little noisy, which is understandable.

If Chimelong Resort is one of the must-visit attractions when traveling to Guangzhou, Chimelong Hotel is the first choice hotel for vacation in Chimelong.

The hotel's hardware facilities are well maintained and constantly updated. Every time there is a different experience, the service is always good. The overall environment of the hotel is good, the lobby is decorated grandly, the rooms are simple and clean, and the overall stay experience is good. The location of the hotel is also convenient, making it easy to get to the park. The management of the hotel and the park is also very orderly. The circus performance is particularly exciting and worth the price. The service is warm and thoughtful. Staff Liu Shiqing praised the thoughtful service and the convenience of staying in the hotel. There are children's items in the room, which is considerate. The Children's Fun Park is suitable for children to play, and the restaurant has a variety of products, which is good.
A very satisfying travel experience.
I don’t mind coming to Chimelong once a year, have fun, have fun!

There are many interactive designs for children, which is especially suitable for bringing children. Even middle-aged girls like us are very excited by the a**osphere. The parent-child room we booked has bunk beds, not to mention bunk beds. The big bed is so big that it can sleep four adults!
Environment: There are many and large Chimelong parks, and hotels are very convenient in the past. Whether you are traveling with children or friends, I sincerely recommend staying in a hotel, so that you can have fun without any hassle.
Service: Staff Liu Shiqing praised the warm service and the convenience of staying in the hotel. There are children's supplies in the room, especially the bathroom, and small toys are given as gifts, which is very considerate for adults like us. There are many places to rest in the lobby, and there is a children's playground on the first floor, where you can see tigers. The tigers are well taken care of, and they are not the skinny and lifeless ones.
Unlimited access to 3 parks for three people for 2 days and 1 night: This is great. Our original intention was just to find a place to set off fireworks for the New Year. This package included a New Year’s Eve party in the Greater Bay Area, a pleasant surprise! Unlimited entry and exit for two days, no need to play like a special forces soldier.
Buffet dinner for three people: The buffet dinner is not bad. It starts at 17:30, so you can be the first to rush in at about 17:00. But I rushed in and found that many of them were booked, so everyone should make a reservation. Many people go to the tiger side. I recommend the flamingo, which is particularly beautiful during the day and night.

The room is not new, it is in the style of an old-school resort, but the layout of the room is very spacious, clean and well maintained, and the entire area has a low guest capacity and is quiet.
The two breakfasts and one night buffet included in the package are all at the well-known White Tiger Restaurant, where you will have meals with the white tiger flamingos every day, and at dinner there will be Kaka tiger dolls sitting around the table to interact with every child.
There is an animal island behind the hotel lobby, which is a small zoo in itself, with tigers, swans, pelicans, parrots, etc. Tigers will walk by while sitting and drinking coffee.
If it's not rich enough, the Panda Hotel next door is only a 5-minute walk away, and you can also experience the children's facilities inside.
I was worried that it would be uncomfortable if it wasn't in the children's room, but my children loved it so much. I was really satisfied.

There are many pandas in the zoo, and they are all very cute. In addition, there was a black bear who was very show-y. When he saw the audience, he kept dancing and swimming, making everyone laugh.
The only thing I want to criticize is that some hotel employees seem to be sleepwalking, answering questions and not being attentive enough. I remember when I checked in, I gave everyone's home return permit to the front desk clerk, and when he was checking his identity, he actually took it with me. My mother’s return permit asked me if I was the same person. I didn’t look like a 70-year-old person. Then he took my daughter’s return permit and asked me if I was the same person. I felt like he had no intention of working at all🙄. ￼

1. Check-in experience: not good. There seemed to be a lot of waiters in the lobby, but it turned out that there was only one person checking in... Although I didn't arrive during the peak check-in time, I rushed to check in to enter the zoo. I would rather have two waiters watching me, but there is only one. People can check in but have to wait in line. The welcome drink given was very sloppy, it would be better to just give Coke and Sprite.
2. Facilities: The room facilities are relatively old, and there are many unknown stains on the carpet. Although the toiletry products are beautifully packaged, their quality is average. The quality of slippers is not good. The light switches are not even labeled, so I can only try them one by one. The room's pillows, quilts and air conditioning were well received.
3. Breakfast: It’s crowded, but the breakfast quality is pretty good.
4. Paradise: It’s a great experience to play in off-peak hours. You don’t have to queue for anything. I’ve never seen giant pandas so close before, and there’s no crowding around. It’s really a great experience! The staff in several parks are also very friendly and enthusiastic.
5. Service: I have stayed in various five-star tourist resort hotels all over China, and this is the first time I have encountered one that cannot deliver takeaways! Simply outrageous! You have to pay extra for takeout before you can sneak in from the warehouse, or you have to go to the outermost booth to get it yourself, which is very inconvenient! Before I left, I wrote a comment card and left it in a prominent place in the room. That afternoon, the hotel customer service called me on my mobile phone and asked me how my stay was. Any comments? Can I give you a free gift for a five-star review? Thank you very much...if no one notices or reads the comment card I wrote carefully, I will not give it five stars without conscience!

I was very angry at the time because I was tired after playing for a day, but I couldn't find my room. I was really a little depressed at the time. I called When I called the concierge, it was Liang Shuang who answered the phone. She said patiently, don't worry, I'll be waiting for you on the first floor. I still had some bad emotions after seeing her, but the lady was patient and meticulous in her service. After the phone call, her attitude of actively solving the problem relieved my dissatisfaction immediately. Her seriousness and meticulousness in her work made me feel that she is professional. I would also like to thank the concierge girl Huang Xiujun for her good service attitude, attentive provision of travel guides, and answers to all my questions. She made me feel warm at Chimelong Hotel and had a pleasant holiday!

msg:The activities we came to play this time were all in Chimelong, so we booked the Chimelong Hotel. First, we booked a parent-child room for one night. The special feature is that there is a giraffe getting on and off the bed. Secondly, it is very convenient to play in the scenic area. In summary, here are a few things. point:
Facilities: The hotel facilities are old. My husband was washing clothes in front of the bathroom sink. Suddenly a board next to the mirror fell down. It was really scary. Later, a staff member who delivered water happened to be there and installed the board again. But this It is really a safety issue and a safety hazard. The balcony is also relatively old.
Hygiene: As soon as you enter and open the door, you will be greeted by an unpleasant smell. I can't tell what it smells like it hasn't been occupied for a long time. There is also a smell in the toilet. Anyway, the smell of the whole room is not good. There are stains on the table of the kettle.
Service: I asked the waiter to send some toiletries back and forth, which was quite timely and didn’t take too long.
Summary: Advantages, close to the scenic spot, bunk bed toiletries, children like it, big room
Disadvantages: the facilities are old and there are safety issues, and the sanitary environment is not very good.

msg:The decoration materials in the room are very poor and old, and the overall feeling is gray and old. The carpet was of a poor color and felt very hard, the short bed was covered in artificial leather, the bamboo and rattan sofa, and the cushions and pillows were all very rough. In order to save costs, they used the worst materials. The hygienic condition is very poor, the drinking cups are stained, and the rags and sponges are thrown carelessly on the sink. The waiter explained that they had hired a lot of temporary workers... basically the most common thing the waiter said was that they were sorry, they couldn't provide anything, and even if they asked for a plastic bag, they wouldn't give it to them. Not to mention the catering. For breakfast, you have to measure your height, and the card is very strict. If you are more than one meter tall, you will be charged half price, which is 99 yuan. How many bites can a three or four-year-old child eat? The next day, the child couldn't get up in the morning. He asked the waiter to pack two small buns, but he didn't give him. He said that the rule was that he couldn't pack... He passed out, but he didn't give him two small buns. He charged 1,500 for one night. A breakfast costs 198, and two large and two small set meals cost nearly RMB 1,000. When ordering takeout, they are not allowed to be delivered to the lobby and they have to walk outside for more than ten minutes to pick it up. This is a disguised form of forcing customers to spend high prices in the hotel. To sum it up: bad, bad, very bad, black, black, black, very black.

msg:I was torn between Chimelong Hotel and Panda Hotel, and finally chose Chimelong. The last day was empty for half a day, so I visited both hotels and found that I preferred the Chimelong Hotel, which has a tropical resort a**osphere. The garden architectural style is very similar to the Intercontinental Hotel where I live in Xishuangbanna. The Panda Hotel looks cartoony and may be more attractive to children.
Traveling during off-peak hours was really wise. You could check in at the hotel at noon, and the hunting room was upgraded. I especially liked the desk in the room. Sitting cross-legged felt like you were in a yurt, and it was also convenient for Ge You to lie down. Looking out from the balcony, you can see the large slide of the water park.
The hotel lobby is very close to the water park. Unfortunately, the weather changed on the day we went and it was freezing cold at night. The Happy World and the Circus are across the hotel and across a pedestrian bridge, and can be reached within 10 minutes on foot. Only the zoo is a little far away and you need to take a shuttle bus to get there. Although there is a free shuttle bus, it is difficult to estimate the time. It is very frustrating to wait for 15 minutes in vain, so it is faster to walk to places on foot.
Because there were so many activities planned every day, we only had breakfast at the hotel, but the food was still very rich, and there were always clowns and kaka tigers to interact with. You can see 2 white tigers and flamingos in the breakfast room. You can see the snow tiger in the lobby bar, and you will receive a welcome drink when you check in. It is very comfortable to sit on the sofa in the lobby bar while drinking a drink and watch the snow tiger lick its fur.
It is a pity that the water park and outdoor swimming pool will be closed starting from October 7th, and the indoor swimming pool is charged, 200/person. For a five-star hotel, a place without free swimming is substandard.

Facilities: The hotel facilities are a bit old-fashioned compared to today, but the service level is five-star. At ten o'clock in the evening, I asked to install bed rails. Room service Wen Rongying came to install them immediately and reminded me if there were two children.
The guest room found that we had two children and provided seven or eight bottles of water at once, which was really considerate.

msg:When I came to Chimelong for the first time, I was confused about which hotel to choose. I read a lot of guides and finally chose Chimelong Hotel. Facts have proved that I made the right choice. The hotel smells delicious from the lobby to the outdoors, and there are so many green plants, it feels very much like a Sanya hotel. Liu Shiqing, a highly praised staff member, assisted in arranging the room and directly upgraded my baby to a parent-child room. The baby ran back and forth between the two beds with satisfaction. The balcony view is also great, and he can directly see the world of joy. The hotel is very close to the circus. You can walk directly from the hotel. There is also a direct bus to the Animal World. There are also a bunch of flamingos in the hotel. I stayed at Bird Paradise for two days and was delayed in my check-out time. They also helped me handle a late check-out, which was really considerate. It was very boring while waiting for the bus to Zhuhai, and my son played in the children's playground for a while.

It took about half an hour to walk to the zoo. The hotel has a shuttle bus, but you have to queue during the peak season. The hotel is very large and has shopping malls and restaurants. Children especially like it. The price is the same as in the park, and the taste can only be said to be average. The biggest problem is that it is inconvenient to order takeout. You can leave it in the administrative building and take it there by the hotel shuttle bus. But in fact, some delivery boys don't know and are unwilling to turn to the administration building. You can't get into the resort, so you have to walk a kilometer or two to get it, but the delivery boy doesn't want to wait, so he will pay you 40 yuan for a taxi to bring it in for you. So for the first time, I ate takeout for more than 200 yuan, and paid an extra 40 yuan for the fare. Next time I stay in a hotel in a scenic spot, I really can’t order takeout.

msg:3 people can play unlimitedly in three parks (Animal World, Happy World, and Bird Paradise multiple times on the 2nd), two big and two small trips, 400 quickly made up for the same package for my sister.
The hotel room does not include breakfast. We bought it ourselves. The restaurant can see white tigers and flamingos. The children like it very much. The breakfast category is relatively rich, which is better than Zhuhai's self-service. The room was upgraded for free. The service is very enthusiastic, and the luggage is delivered to the room!
Go to the happy world, the big circus walks to the hotel and crosses the overpass, just a few minutes walk! If you like thrilling projects, I recommend Happy World. The park is not big, but each area is very compact, and there are many big projects, suitable for older children to challenge. Chimelong’s hotel guests have a 20% discount for fast lane purchases. The price/performance ratio of 240 per child is quite high. We arrived at around 5 o’clock after visiting the zoo. We bought the fast lane and played until 8 o’clock. It’s already very enjoyable. The big one Except for the vertical roller coaster, I don’t want to play any other projects🤗. The park closes at 10 o’clock. In fact, if you have enough time, you can come later after dinner. There are no queues for many projects. It’s still cool at night, and it’s very enjoyable to play, but The ten-ring roller coaster and motorcycle roller coaster end at 8:00, and the last show of the two performances is at 8:30, so please arrange your time reasonably!
We bought a fast track at the zoo, and you can use the cable car, the small train and watch the 5D show. The price is not expensive and the price is 160 per person after the discount for hotel guests!
I didn't feel tired all the way down on the first day, but the experience was not good, so this arrangement is not recommended! The trees are very tall, the cable car is basically nothing interesting to see below, the small train walks around and the explanations are hardly heard, and the children are not very interested in watching flowers. I even feel that it is not as fun as Yinji's zoo. After talking with my friends, I found out that they chartered a car to go in. They will stop in each area to see animals up close. The driver will also give you on-site explanations. The attention of children will be much higher, and the rest of the small part of walking will not be very tiring! This kind can be found anywhere you take the bus or at the gate of the zoo, and it costs about 600 yuan per car. The four of us are actually the same. It is more cost-effective to charter a car if there are more people!
There is one thing to emphasize, don’t order takeaway here, it can’t be delivered, I ordered three times but didn’t receive it, the park doesn’t allow takeaways to come in, I just ordered room service, lunch is settled in the park, and the hotel here goes to the park The free bus is not as convenient as the Zhuhai Airship. If you don’t want to wait, just call the car online and the starting price will be more than ten yuan.

Check-in is also very fast, and ticket collection is also very convenient. Li Weicheng helped introduce the information of the park. There is an exclusive passage for guests from the hotel to the water park. It takes only five minutes to walk there. It is very convenient. This trip is very happy, and I will stay at the Chimelong Hotel next time

2. The air conditioner is not cool and the room is humid;
3. The refrigerator is not connected to the power supply and there is no cold drink, which is incomprehensible for a five-star hotel;
4. It is not recommended to eat the dinner buffet at Baihu Restaurant. The quality of the food is very poor. The crayfish are all soft and blistered, and you cannot peel off any meat. Compared with the buffet at this price and the same price in Beijing, this place is not at the same starting point;
5. It is not recommended to stay at Chimelong Zoo for the first time;
6. When buying tickets, you don’t need to buy multiple round-trip tickets, because you will be tired* after walking only once;
7. You can only check in after 15:00 in the afternoon, and you must check out before 12:00 noon, which is very frustrating;
The overall evaluation is very average, and it is not recommended to stay here. You can stay in five-star hotels nearby and call for a special car to pick you up. The experience will be much better than here.

msg:I never like to comment, but this time it really makes people speechless to the extreme. I hope that all netizens will not step on the pit. This time I came to Guangzhou Changlong for the worst experience. Here are some specific points:
        First: I booked the hotel ticket package in July. The price was the most expensive. Let’s not talk about the price. The waiter who opened the room was very slow. There was only one person in front of me and I waited in line for half an hour. Unable to live attitude, poor service!
        Second: The infrastructure of the room is extremely poor, it is too old, too old, too bad, you have to use all your strength to open the cabinet, all kinds of furniture are very old, the aisle is very low, it is very depressing, and there is also a lot of mold Smell, like a hotel room standard within 200 yuan
       Third: There are so many mosquitoes, they bit my children eight or nine times, and the adults also have six or seven, and they are very poisonous. After staying for one night, they didn’t go away until they returned home. The children felt very annoyed. This is The most speechless, because the room is too rubbish, it is the place where bacteria, mosquitoes and cockroaches breed, the skin is seriously injured, I will not argue with the hotel, I can only consider myself unlucky, and I will never stay in the future!
       Fourth: The package ticket is not suitable at all. There is only one zoo, with two parks. One is very far away. It takes 35 minutes to drive to Bird Paradise, and the other is Happy World. The popularity is not good. I went there in the most expensive and peak season, which proves that the facilities are really poor, not as good as Happy Valley
      Finally, to sum up, this is the hotel I spent 3,980 yuan for one night and the package tickets for the three parks. It is really bad. I suggest that friends from other places buy a ticket for Animal World when they go to Chimelong. You can’t stay in a hotel in a scenic area. The five-star and six-star hotels outside have good service, clean, high-end, and the rooms are very comfortable to live in. I also remind you that there is a charge for breakfast for children over 1 meter in this hotel (check-in It was 98 that day, and it was 112 the next morning). My child only drank one yogurt, which cost 112 yuan. For a four-year-old girl, in other five-star hotels, the minimum height of 1.2 meters will only charge half price for breakfast.

msg:The entire hotel is very large, and the guest rooms are divided into many areas and buildings. We booked a hunting room, which is in the fifth area and is about 7 to 80 meters away from the hotel lobby. The room is very big, and because we live on the sixth floor, we can see a dense forest from the window. It really feels like living in a jungle. There is a swimming pool in the hotel, but it is not open 24 hours a day, probably because it is next to the water park. When you go out of the hotel, turn right and there is a free shuttle bus to the zoo about 100 meters away, which runs every 10 minutes. It's also a 10-minute walk from the hotel to the Circus, which is quite convenient. There is one more check-in procedure than other hotels, that is, you must first confirm the reservation registration information at the front desk, and then the staff will explain and handle it at the self-service machine, and receive the room card (I don’t know if we arrived at the hotel early to check in at 11:00 a.m. Reason) There were so many people checking in, and I had to wait in line for 40 minutes to check in. After I got my room card, I couldn't check in because the room hadn't been cleaned yet. But since we planned to go to the zoo on the day we checked in, it didn't matter. Your phone number and license plate information will be registered when you check in, and you will receive a text message notification when the room is ready. After the license plate is entered, you can enter and exit the resort at will during your stay. Personally, I think the most interesting thing is the breakfast buffet in the White Tiger Restaurant. You must take your children to experience it, and the children will be happy. It opens at 7 o'clock in the morning, and I'm lucky enough to be able to sit in a seat surrounded by glass. It's quite refreshing to watch tigers while dining at a close distance. Personally, I think it’s still worth the experience, because we only visited the zoo and the circus, so we only stayed for one night. If we want to visit both the water park and the happy world, we need to stay for two nights😜Personal feelings, for your reference.

msg:This hotel is not cheap, but the experience of staying and eating is very bad. This is the first time I complain about the hotel, everyone should be careful, anyway, I will not come again. Hotel: 1. You can check in at 3:00, but when you arrive at the room at 3:00, you are told that the sanitation has not been done and you have to wait. 2. After checking in, the quilt was wet and heavy, just like the kind of quilt that was not dried in the sun. 3. The facilities are outdated, and the toilet door needs a man to open it. Since there is a problem, it needs to be repaired before it can be used by others. 4. The paper towels used in the bathroom are worse than the hotel where I stayed at 700 yuan a night. Let’s talk about the breakfast at Baihu Restaurant: I spent four to five hundred yuan for the buffet breakfast, and I regretted it to death. It’s better to go out and eat hot rice rolls than to eat here. 1. The food supply is slow, and I ran five times with a fried egg. Take it up to about ten or twenty. The flow of people is so large, can't you go more at a time! 2. There are very few hot dishes, either ham sausage or ham sliced ​​corn. It's ridiculous to look at. The fried rice looked unappetizing. There is also a Doudou that looks like it has been poured out of a can, which is disgusting to look at. 3. I ordered a porridge that I don't know what kind of meat it is, it has no taste at all, it's unpalatable! Chow mein was cold! 4. The funniest thing is the fruit, the whole uncut apple (who would eat a whole apple from the breakfast buffet) ➕ small mangoes (who would eat it if you had to find a place to wash your hands after eating) ➕ too green to dare to start plums. Such a combination clearly does not want people to eat it! Super sorry!

It is very comfortable and tidy. The big bed is super big. Although I went to the zoo for a day, I came back to rest. It's very good, the only thing is that the TV is really a bit small compared to this room type, it can be upgraded. It is very convenient to get in and out of the hotel in building 7, but it feels a little far away for friends who live in building 8, and the directions and navigation are not particularly clear. I hope this aspect can be improved. The hotel has a shuttle bus to the zoo which is very convenient.

So we stored our luggage at the concierge and took a taxi to a nearby restaurant for lunch. It was almost 2 o'clock when we received a call. They said they would change our room because the room we had reserved was extended. I don’t understand why they didn’t notify us until 2 o’clock.
Then there is the service. There is basically no service. Because it is my first time here, I thought that the receptionist would introduce some of the hotel's services when checking in. However, there was nothing. Even how to get to the room, I had to ask myself all the way. of. Including the shuttle bus time to the zoo and what kind of park activities are available, I asked about it, but there was no promotional brochure.
There were a lot of people at breakfast and it was very messy. I had to figure it out on my own until I found out there was a buffet inside, which was similar to the one outside.
Only when I finally left the store did I realize there was a tiger.
It’s worth mentioning that the parent-child aspect is quite good.

msg:During the three years of the epidemic, I have never been out of Shanghai. . This year's May Day, I decided to take the children to Guangzhou to play. . After looking at the hotel in advance, I chose this package that does not include breakfast and includes "three tickets, one ticket for 2 days of unlimited play in multiple parks".
It is indeed a Chimelong Parent-child Hotel. Although it has been built for a long time, the internal facilities are still very good, from the room environment to the attitude of the staff are very good!
When you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you will check in first, order breakfast for the next day (because it is a holiday, you need to order breakfast for the next day one day in advance), exchange tickets, and store luggage (because you have arrived very early, there is no spare room)
The children are only interested in the zoo. Although the zoo is a crowd, they didn’t come out until three or four o’clock. When they returned to the hotel, the children heard that there was a children’s playground. After taking a bath, they hurried to play. tired. . High energy!
In fact, there is also a water park in the hotel. . But our father is tired. . 😂😂 I didn’t take the children to play. . Otherwise, it's actually pretty good. .
I went to have breakfast very early the next day, because I wanted to go to the zoo after breakfast. . As a result, I did not expect to see the white tiger feeding the zoo! Just stayed in the hotel for a while, and then entered the zoo. .
The hotel's breakfast is also very rich, and it is very authentic and delicious! The point is, although the place is big, it is also very friendly and has three dining areas, so it is very convenient for you to sit and eat anywhere!

The overall feeling of this place in Chimelong is that it is suitable for three days and two nights to stay here. . Enough for kids to play with!

The hotel facilities are not bad for a tourist resort hotel. The highlight of the room is the first, the viewing balcony, the children's playground and the outdoor swimming pool, the second highlight of the gym, the animal island, and the third highlight. The most impressive staff member is Liu Shiqing, who responds quickly to the service, is responsible and thoughtful in solving problems, and is highly praised.

msg:Bringing children to check in Chimelong during the May Day holiday. We drove here from the urban area. The hotel has free parking. When entering the Chimelong Hotel, there is an illusion of walking into Venice, Macau, and the photos are beautiful. Thanks to the staff Liu Shiqing for helping to arrange the room. I am very satisfied with the hotel experience.
The Chimelong Hotel is the nearest to the Circus Park, and it can be reached within 10 minutes by walking a bridge. There is a free swimming pool for residents, a buffet breakfast, and you can watch the white tiger sleep at the dining table. It is really great 😁
About the breakfast buffet: ​It is said that the breakfast option of 158 is indeed a deluxe version. Japanese, Western, French, and Chinese ingredients, of course, the favorite is porridge with various side dishes, hahaha 😄😄😄
About the big circus: I stepped on the spot when I went there, it was too hasty, the ordinary ticket was not given until the last gate 9, and I couldn't get a good seat, so I sat on the side. When I bought it, I thought the ticket price was very high, and I felt it was worth it when I first started acting. The scene is grand and beautiful, the clothes are gorgeous and novel, the action is superb and creative, and the performance is constantly surpassing the difficulty. The sense of participation is full, and the actors have a strong sense of inves**ent. It was full of fun, and the a**osphere in the venue climaxed again and again. It is recommended not to save the line if you have the conditions, and you must buy a first-class seat. The interaction and gift giving at the C seat will provide a more superior experience.
About Chimelong Zoo: I saw the panda in my heart 🐼, the super-close-up 👏👏👏 experience is so good, all the settings fully feel the harmonious coexistence of humans and animals, so close, but also so far away, no There is no net on the glass, everything must be visible to the naked eye, but it is absolutely safe to touch it, because there are 2-3 meters of obstacles that cannot be crossed! This distance from the first row of photos is very effective, and the overall plan is quite advanced!
The hotel's free bus goes to the south gate of the zoo. If you are going back to the hotel from the north gate, you must also take a bus from the north gate to the south gate, and then transfer back to the hotel's car. If you are staying, it is best to leave the gate of the zoo.

Considering that Chimelong Hotel is located in the center of the park, it is convenient for children to travel, so I booked it.
As soon as we entered the hotel, the two little tiger dolls greeted us warmly, and the sense of substitution was very good.
The decoration of the hotel is more friendly, and the children like it very much. There are children's slippers, chairs, toiletries, and hangers inside, which is very convenient. After a while, the children started to play with flowers in the hotel.
The Baihu buffet in the hotel has a lot of dishes, the seafood is very fresh, there are also many things for children, and the service is also very good.
In spare time, you can also go to the children's playground to play a little.
If adults are tired from playing, they can go to the sole of the clubhouse, which is very relaxing.
The water world in the hotel is very close, you can walk there, it is very convenient for children.
There is a photography exhibition downstairs in the hotel. It seems that you can book a travel photo, which is also a good choice.

For this trip, there are three big ones and one small one. The big bed is extremely wide, and the upper and lower bunks are also unique. Probably on weekdays, there are not many people, and you can check in at 9:00 am. The White Tiger restaurant is not bad, you don’t sit by the window, you have to go early or late, there are seats at the table. The dishes are average and the price is a little expensive. Multi-day combined tickets, I feel useless, because for three days and two nights, there is only time to go to one park. If you are short of time, you don’t have to go to the amu*****t park, it’s no different from amu*****t parks across the country. The safari park and bird park are good. Coupon cannot be unbound, bad review! Because the old man was not feeling well the next day, so he didn't go to the zoo, and said that he would give the ticket to the child, but he couldn't answer. An extra ticket for nothing.

In addition to the usual children’s toiletries, the room also provides small chairs, bed rails and children’s toilets for children 👍🏻 Really It's so convenient. But maybe because the hotel has been open for a long time, the quilt has a strong smell and is very humid when you sleep on it, and you will feel cold when you sleep at night.

The time for 2 days and 1 night was just right. Wen Xiangdi's exclusive service at the concierge is also very good. We can always consult her if we don't understand anything. After checking out, I forgot something in the room, and she helped us find it in time. The whole trip was very pleasant.

This trip is also very grateful to the customer relationship Ms. Liu Shiqing, who not only helped to properly handle our reservation form, but also provided convenience for visiting the garden, and praised it.

Parent-child facilities include a children's playground, and the outdoor swimming pool will feel more like a vacation when it is open in summer. The overall environment is very comfortable.

msg:Although it is the oldest hotel in the park, it is well maintained, but there are many dead spots in the room, and there is thick dust in the groove above the head of the bed! As a result, dust rose up when the children were playing in the room, and they had a fever in the middle of the night... As a parent, it was really heartbreaking 💔 Since I had to catch a plane early in the morning, I had to bite the bullet and go, and Ctrip also encountered a small episode when booking a room , The price of 1798 for one night stayed for two consecutive nights, and the front desk was told that the second night was a clean room! ! And there is no place to complain and no compensation. The word game in the reservation notice is strange to the guests who didn't understand it. They were taken advantage of and had to admit it. They didn't have any tickets and breakfast 🈚🈚🈚Is it really not a bad idea to sell it at this price? Fortunately, the service staff in the hotel are very nice, very enthusiastic, and have a good attitude towards the children. The children are having fun, which is also a comfort.

The hotel is indeed old and the facilities and equipment need to be updated, but the overall environment is good. I chose to stay because the previous experience was very good, so I didn’t choose the Panda Hotel this time. I think Chimelong is still worth staying in. It’s close to the park. The package includes the zoo, Happy World and Bird Paradise. The food at the Caidie Valley restaurant downstairs tastes good, but it may be due to the lack of waiters that every time you add tea, you need to be urged. Other services are not bad.

Facilities: Maybe the hotel has a certain age and is generally quite old. For example, the phone number for the room to contact the front desk is so quiet that it cannot be heard. But if I live in Building 9, I have to contact a battery car every time I go out. Very painful.

Environment: Ordinary, the scenery outside the balcony is only trees. Can't see anything.

Service: The service is quite good. I paid attention to details such as helping to open the door.

Welcome drink: It’s a bit perfunctory, I took the coupon and got it from the lobby bar. The lobby bar has a row of 4 drinks packaged in the normal temperature area, with disposable cups that you can take away by yourself.

Thanks to the staff member Xu Yuxian for providing suggestions for my family to play in the park, and recommending activities in Happy World.

msg:This is my first time bringing my baby to Chimelong. Let me talk about my personal experience and the advantages first:
1) The buffet breakfast is very rich. You can watch flamingos and white tigers at the White Tiger Restaurant, which is quite interesting.
2) The transportation is convenient. You can go to the Circus via the overpass. It is also very close to the water park. There are regular shuttle buses to the zoo.
3) The hotel itself has complete facilities and many service details that are very thoughtful.
Let’s talk about the dissatisfaction:
1) The hotel facilities are outdated. The lobby is very nice, just like a resort hotel, but the rooms are not satisfactory, they are large in size, the decoration is from at least 10 years ago, and the sofas and chairs are not comfortable at all. There is a big gap with the five-star positioning.
2) The hotel is too big. From the lobby to Building 1, you have to go through one staircase. For parents taking their children on vacation, it is too inconvenient to carry luggage.
3) The cost of dining in the hotel is high and the food is not good. (excluding buffet restaurant)
My experience is that if you stay in Chimelong for 2-3 days, it would be more comfortable to choose a newer Panda Hotel. If you just visit the zoo, it is better to stay in a hotel outside the park or even in the city.

In fact, there are still many vacant seats one minute before the opening. See picture 1; I have been paying attention to the VIP area halfway, and there are vacancies throughout the whole process, but the waiter told us that there is no room for extra money. What's the situation? Bullying hotel guests? Knowing that they all come from afar, once there is no second time, so spend the same money to fill in the worst position?

The family room is also relatively spacious. The two rooms can be separated by a sliding door. One single bed, very comfortable for a family of four. The hotel walks through the water park to the south gate of the wildlife park for 5 minutes. If the water park is open in summer, you may need to take a shuttle bus to go around. During the Spring Festival, it is the peak time. There are quite a lot of people for breakfast at the White Tiger Restaurant, but fortunately, the place is relatively large, and there are not many queues. As long as you don’t seek to lean against the glass, you can find a place. The variety of breakfast is okay, but I have no appetite after eating for two days. The other two restaurants are Kirin and the Butterfly Valley. I tried a dinner and a lunch respectively. The dishes are mainly Cantonese. I feel that the Butterfly Valley is more cost-effective.

You bought it at the hotel, you go to the hotel to deal with it! Does that mean your resorts are still managed separately? Finally, after asking the leader to deal with it, I got admission.

msg:The rooms are old. At best, they are the standard of a business hotel. They sold for a thousand or more than a few hundred. It is unacceptable if it is not a holiday. The key point is that Ctrip is still a scam. Booking a package on the Chimelong app also includes tickets for several parks. Ctrip does not include breakfast. Excluding tickets, it is more expensive than others. I also found a problem this time. Booking a room on Ctrip is more expensive than checking in directly at the hotel. The price of extending your stay directly at the hotel front desk the next day is much cheaper 😂😂 I am speechless.

msg:This hotel can only be said to occupy the geographical area, but it has no other merits.
1. The room corridor was filled with the smell of cigarette smoke.
2. The room is old, the walls are shabby and full of smell
3. Very poor service attitude, basically impatient
4. Very low value for money, the price is the same as the most expensive 5 stars in the city center
5. The room is not in the main building. You have to walk to the next building. There is no one to help you with your luggage. It will be unlucky on rainy days.
6. There is no need to swipe the card on the floor, which means it is easy to sneak in.

In fact, there is really no need to live in the park when visiting. It only costs a little money to take a taxi. I really don’t recommend it!

The room was spacious, with good light transmission, with a balcony and a clothesline on the balcony. OK Anyone with children understands that when children have a place to play, adults can relax. The hotel's children's playground is very good, which can pass the children's time. However, the fun park closes at 8 pm, which is a bit early. The child likes the small mouthwash cup in the room, and the toothbrush box is also very beautiful. The main reason is that the hotel is close to the zoo, and there is also a free bus. The environment of the hotel itself is not bad, which is suitable for a leisurely vacation. Thank you Liu Shiqing, the customer service, for providing garden information consultation.

It turns out that this is completely in time, because the hotel is within a distance of the three parks. After entering the room, I dreamed of returning to the guest house, enjoying the five-star paid guest house.

msg:The Raiders say that the Chimelong Hotel has an advantage in its geographical location, so I choose to stay at the Chimelong Hotel with a package of products (but one ticket for multiple parks does not include water park tickets, you need to buy the water park alone, oh, of course, the circus tickets also have to be bought separately) . In fact, the hotel's software and hardware are very good, after all, it is the most well-equipped hotel in the resort. Easy parking, quick check in, big and comfortable room. There are also many choices for dining, and it is up to people to be frugal. The cafeteria has a good environment, and you can also watch white tigers and flamingos (specific areas) while dining. Kylin Chinese food is good, and Cantonese cuisine is good. The Caidie Valley restaurant has many varieties and varied dishes. The service details are touching, and a large-scale resort hotel also surprises the details other than accommodation. When customers have unexpected discoveries wherever they can touch and see, Liu Shiqing, the customer service, contacted in advance to arrange and confirm the room, and the details of the room arrangement were properly handled. The waiters, including the White Tiger Buffet, are also quick-witted, change dishes, and are very discerning. These are the details of the hotel's software services, great!

msg:In the summer vacation, I chose to take my children to Guangzhou Chimelong for a trip. After comparing many aspects, I chose the old Chimelong Hotel.
【Position highlighted:】
Because it is the earliest built Chimelong Scenic Hotel, the hotel is located in the absolute core area, and it is very convenient to reach the Safari Park, the Circus, the Water World, and the Bird Park.
【transportation:】
It is very convenient for the shuttle bus to reach the various parks by turning right after going out of the hotel
Hotel facilities: The hotel is equipped with a reception lobby (very stylish, with an elephant sculpture outside), concierge, guest rooms, outdoor swimming pool (free, and the only hotel with an outdoor swimming pool in Chimelong area), indoor swimming pool (separately charged without going in to see the environment ), gym, SPA hall, beauty salon, mahjong room, cafeteria (the patio separated by the glass of the restaurant is tropical rainforest style, there are white tigers, flamingos, and red crested ibises walking around leisurely), banquet hall , conference hall, exhibition hall, children's playground, various gift shops, you can buy a wide variety of souvenirs (Jing Ran also has a Chimelong-themed handbook),
【Room facilities:】
This time we booked a basic room with a double bed. The room area is about 50 square meters. The room is equipped with a shower, a bathtub, a mini fresh-keeping refrigerator, and an outside balcony. room), the room is equipped with 4 bottles of mineral water, but there is no mini bar,
There are little tiger patterns on the towels and bath towels, which are especially attractive to children. The urban animal patterns on the disposable toiletries boxes (the details worth mentioning are that all the boxes can be put together to make a complete picture), and all the balcony doors are on the ground. And made floor-to-ceiling screen windows, and outside the balcony there are green plants made by the building as a whole (there are also roses and roses on the balcony of some rooms, which are very romantic)
【Reception】
In order to arrive at the zoo earlier to avoid crowds, we chose to check in at the hotel at 8:00 in the morning (normal use after 14:00 in the afternoon). The front desk was very considerate and helped to do the check-in in advance, but when we arrived at the room, we found that the room was not facing well. The landscape outside is not wide enough, so I applied for a room that faces the swimming pool, and the front desk also helped to make timely arrangements. Since the room has not been cleaned and disinfected, the front desk first gave the room card and reminded the room to be ok, and then the room number will be notified by text message (the process is very smooth and silky)
【Room Service】
I didn't bring the room card back to the room on the way. The room service staff did not open the door directly because I reported the room number, but checked my identity information in time with the form and opened the door, which also made me feel full of security (by the way, I asked for 2 more bottles. cute kids body wash)
【health】
The hotel is relatively clean from the public area to the room. Although it has a longer time than the newly opened hotel, it has not relaxed the quality of hygiene because of the long time. The base and back of the LCD TV are basically free of dust, cabinets, drawers, and the ground corners on the back of the toilet. , The drying racks on the balcony are very clean (just comment on the room I stayed in), a little flaw is that there is a strand of hair outside the bathroom door, and the fruit tray in the drawer under the TV has traces of fructose that has not been cleaned by the previous guest. It's all good
【Outdoor swimming pool】
The guests are free to use, the area is very large, everyone is clean and well maintained, there are some tall trees on the side and the pavilion in the middle for shade and shade, and it will not feel the sun during the day in mid-July
【breakfast】
The breakfast is purchased separately from other websites. The environment is good. You can also watch tigers and flamingos, but the variety is average (similar to the breakfast in a normal star-rated hotel). What you need to suggest is about the end time of breakfast, as a weekend Isn't it a little early to close at 10:00?
【check out】
Since there is no deposit, we chose "quick check out" (just put in the room card, the box is on the side of the lobby aisle on the 1st floor, just ask if you can't find it)
【Return visit】
The return visit mechanism of the hotel is also good. I checked out at 12 o'clock and received a return visit call at 16 o'clock, which solved my problem of billing.
【Overall feeling】
Before booking, I saw some bad reviews of the hotel, and I was still a little worried. After 2 days of staying, the experience may not be complete, but in general, the hotel is worth choosing from a variety of aspects. The service staff are full of tranquility The smile of , for vacationers, can't be more pleasant, it's a wonderful experience~

It was so late that the room attendant Zhou Lianrong came over quickly and responded immediately after checking. If the repairs affected the rest, he decided to check the nearest vacant room. Suddenly upgraded to a parent-child room. When the children saw the giraffe bed going up and down, they would not object and would be happy to move overnight. Quietly and happily for fear of disturbing others. Thanks to Zhou Lianrong, even though she encountered a small unhappiness, she resolved it intimately. The children gained value for money again, which increased their satisfaction this time. Had a great time. During these few days, Zhou Lianrong and other housekeeping aunts delivered water and fruit to take care of the children.

It was because of this outdoor swimming pool that I booked this old hotel instead of the newer Panda Hotel. Negotiation with the hotel in person failed, entrusting Ctrip to negotiate failed. Anyway, I booked a family suite with a unit price of 1898 yuan for two days, without any extra services. The swimming pool is not open and the hotel has no apology or actual compensatory action.
What's even more outrageous is that there is a closed sign at the entrance of the swimming pool, but on the afternoon of June 25, a group of student team tourists were playing in the swimming pool! ! !
Praise Ctrip and take the initiative to give customers 200 yuan in cash compensation, which is much better than Chimelong Hotel

The exterior of the hotel has a resort style, which is quite suitable for a family or three or five friends to gather on weekends. The food and beverages are quite satisfactory, and the taste is also in line with the taste. The hotel service is very good, which is a highlight. The impressive service staff is Ms. Liu Shiqing, who is very enthusiastic and efficient in recommending play strategies, praised, and recommended to stay!

msg:The hotel is located in the Chimelong Scenic Area, and the accommodation can park for free. It is quite cost-effective to book a package ticket for the scenic area. I went to the Happy World and the Safari Park. Because of the lack of time, I didn’t go to the Bird Park. In fact, I feel that the water park is more fun in summer. , but because I accidentally scratched my hand on the day of departure, I couldn't go into the water, so I had to give up the water park.
Hotel advantages: high specifications, a**osphere, good surrounding environment, convenient to play, there is food and shopping in the hotel, convenient check-out is very convenient;
Disadvantages of the hotel: The hotel is too big, and the rooms are far away. You have to turn around like a maze. If you have a bad sense of direction, it is easy to get lost. The price is a bit high. More than 100 yuan is faster than 200 yuan. In fact, we drove a few minutes to the surrounding morning tea shop "Dian Dude" the next day and had a good meal. The three talents were more than 200 yuan, and the floor and area where we stayed that night should not be too much. Many people live, half of the lights are on in the hallway, it's dark, and it's long..., you know 😂

There is a bus to the park. I didn't take the park bus because I drove by myself, but it felt quite convenient. The hotel has a tropical feel and is suitable for a relaxing vacation. The hotel service is also warm. From the lobby to the ticketing center, the staff are very friendly, especially Ms. Liu Shiqing, who answered the questions in detail on the spot.

msg:There are a lot of children's towels and toiletries, which are very popular with children. The room is spacious, and the decoration has been clean and tidy for many years. Compared with other five-stars, the style remains unchanged. This kind of decoration does not include more than 800 yuan, and it is bundled with scenic ticket sales for customers to accept (not that the tickets for residents are much more expensive), and there is not even a glass or mug for drinking tea and water, only small teacups . The two drinks provided by the reservation are even more funny. Sprite adds a slice or two of lemon... The lid of the cup leaks when drinking, and I use a plastic bag to hold the two drinks. After a while, the drinks leak out. A plastic bag, this is a shame for the drinks and packaging, so it's better not to send it. In addition, the breakfast purchased is not cheap, and you have to buy it on the public comment to get a discount and free service charge. The things are so-so. The breakfast at the White Tiger Cafeteria is average. The 400 yuan buffet dinner is worth up to 200 yuan (200 if there are flamingos and white tiger blessings). There are very few good things. Two plates, no longer available, arctic shellfish looks funny, no sushi, only rice rolls, seafood cold cooked shrimp is tasteless, a lot of seafood meat is tasteless (umami, aroma, not cooking method level). Yogurt is the cheapest. Chimelong uses scenic spots to raise house prices and provides high-quality catering services without considering customer experience.

🚗 Transportation: It is quite convenient to drive by car

🧹Hygiene: The hotel is hygienic, but it smells of mold

🍃Environment: The environment of the entire hotel is OK, there are tigers in the lobby bar, and white tigers and flamingos in the restaurant

🔔Service:
This time is the worst experience. Such a good park and facilities, if the service can't keep up... It's really uncomfortable.
1. There are three places for check-in registration: housing registration is at the front desk, and admission registration is at another place in the lobby. Why can’t we complete the authorization at the front desk together? The hotel itinerary is clearly scheduled to include breakfast, but do you still need to register for the catering registration? Pick up a meal ticket separately? Really funny. The Xiangjiang Hotel is entered with the room number, and the Penguin Hotel is a voucher for check-in. Only the Chimelong Hotel is very special. Isn't the purpose of the service to save time and worry for the guests?
2. The bedside table in the guest room is not properly fixed to prevent falling down. If a child opens the drawer naughty and stands on it, he will be pressed under the cabinet. My naughty bag is pressed under it. Fortunately, I was right next to me and pulled it in time. . The room attendant can try it. The bedside table is made of marble, and the cabinet is still very heavy. If it is pressed down, the child must be injured. As an in-person hotel, these safety measures are required.
3. There are many private cars at the connection site. Does this park care? Many guests are annoyed if they don't take the shuttle bus.
The experience of the Chimelong Hotel is really average, the worst one in the Chimelong system…
Opinions after personal experience, don't spray if you don't like it

After 15 minutes, we came out of the subway exit to the Chimelong bus station. It is very convenient to take the bus directly to the Chimelong Hotel. It's just that during the epidemic, the check-in procedures were complicated. It is understandable that the lady at the front desk is very gentle. I took my children to the safari park and the bird park. I was very happy. Because there were too few people, there was no need to line up. I felt that we were super VIPs! It seems that the epidemic also has advantages and disadvantages, otherwise it is difficult to imagine the scene of a huge crowd. After returning home, our return visit from the hotel staff Xu Yuxian and our team was also very nice. When the children are older, they will go to Happy World again. The big circus was missed this time, and I didn't see it...

❤️The packaging of the toiletries is beautiful; there are also parent-child pajamas and slippers.

If you are hungry after 10 pm, you can only order the food delivery service on the QR code.
You can not let takeaways come in, but do you have to have complete supporting facilities? The price tag is so expensive that it is unacceptable.
The white tiger buffet breakfast in the morning is also very ordinary, all refined noodles and carbohydrates. Meat is too little. Think about it. You earn a little bit.

Speaking of hotel dining, the environment of the cafeteria is really good. You can see white tigers, flamingos and red ibises in the restaurant. It is the most distinctive restaurant in China and one of the selling points of the hotel. The restaurant has a wide variety of products, and a punch-in buffet is recommended for staying at the hotel. However, during the summer vacation, there are many people staying, and there are relatively more people dining. If you don’t want to crowd people, you can consider the morning tea of Qilin Chinese Food, which is exquisite and attentive.

msg:The hotel is very big, and when you get off the car, someone helps you with luggage and guides you to check in. The room facilities are a bit old, but the big bed is very large and there is a balcony. Children like to get in and out of bed, and they can play for a long time when they climb up and down. Compared to the panda's cramped room, this area is comfortable.
The bathroom equipment in the room is very full, but the parent-child room does not have a bathtub🛁, and the children do not have to take a bath. It's a bit strange that there is no place for wet towels in the bathroom. The sound insulation of the room is average, and it is still very quiet at night, but the sound of children running and adults talking in the corridor around 8:00 in the morning can be heard clearly, which is very unfriendly to people who wake up late.
The hotel has a children's playground for younger children. The older ones can play video games such as shooting machines next to them. The price is very close to the people. There is also bowling 🎳 next to the Children's Fun Park, which adults and children love to play.
The welcome drink 🥤 at the lobby restaurant and bar is not bad. The restaurant and bar in the lobby of the Panda Hotel closed early at 9 o'clock in the same evening. Fortunately, the Chimelong Hotel is open until 11 o'clock. After drinking the drinks, I also bought ice cream🍦 to eat, the children were very happy.
There are quite a lot of service staff in the hotel, who are very professional in answering questions, much more professional than those in the Happy World Park.
Next time I come to Chimelong, I will choose Chimelong Hotel. I like the big room and big bed. The professional service staff makes people feel comfortable. The fly in the oin**ent is that they can't sleep in late. I hope that a relatively quiet room can be arranged next time.

msg:First of all, I bought a package on Ctrip. It is very cost-effective. For three days and two nights of accommodation, I will get three full days of unlimited tickets for Animal World and Happy World. The total is only over 2,000 points! Later, I saw that there will be no such package as me soon, so I can say that I am very lucky haha!
Speaking of the hotel, it can really be described as very large. The hotel itself is divided into several guest room areas. Ours are the most common. It takes at least seven or eight minutes to walk from the main entrance of the hotel lobby to the room. It is really big. There are many small shops on the first floor. They sell everything around Chimelong, clothing stores, and food. The hotel room is not small. It may be the reason of the old hotel. There is also a large balcony ~ the toiletries are all animal cartoon packaging ~ the most awesome is that the hotel has two atriums, raising white tigers and flamingos!
I didn't order breakfast. I eat breakfast directly at the hotel's Chinese restaurant every day. I feel very comfortable and satisfied, and it is not as expensive as a buffet. I really recommend ordering food in a Chinese restaurant.
In general, it is recommended to bring children to Chimelong to play. It is best to be more patient to find a package. Sometimes accommodation + unlimited tickets for adults and children's animal world and happy world are really cost-effective~

This time I booked a two-day-one-night package, upgraded the room, and experienced VIP service. Most of the animals in the safari park are outdoors, and you can see them up close. Even the birds in the bird paradise are not locked in cages, and the experience feels like this. Back to the hotel in the evening, there is also an indoor playground, and the children have fun flying up 😄 But the buffet dinner is not satisfactory, and this is the only deduction item, but Miss Wen Xiangdi at the VIP reception desk can make up for it, with two children , There are many inconveniences. In the two days, the little sister was on call to pick up the battery car to pick us up to various places in the park. There was a lot of time for us to wait for the shuttle bus, so that we took the children to play in the three parks this time and can go back to the hotel for a nap , Add 🍗 to the gentle and thoughtful little sister 🍗 Oh! This is a happy journey!

The lobby bar of the hotel is very good. You can see the white tiger outside the window when you sit there. In the afternoon in the hotel lobby, Kaka Kiki and the clown brother interacted with the children, which the children especially liked. The only downside is that the hunting room did not see the legendary tiger in the room, which is a little disappointing.

The taxi fare to various theme parks is the starting price. You can walk to the big circus and arrive within five minutes! If you leave the side entrance of Happy World, you can also walk back to the hotel. I have only used the meal in the Kylin Chinese restaurant in the hotel.

Location: The hotel is located in the Chimelong Resort. You can choose Chimelong Hotel or Panda Hotel for your package. The Panda Hotel is closer to the entrance and exit. Because we didn't bring any children, we booked Chimelong Hotel
Experience: Arrived at the hotel that morning, because there were not many people during the epidemic, we checked in quickly. The floor is under renovation, and the staff took the initiative to upgrade the room type for us. There are several restaurants on the first floor downstairs, which can satisfy people with different tastes of Cantonese cuisine and mixed cuisine, which is very convenient.
After lunch and preparing for the afternoon itinerary, the hotel staff called Miss Wen Xiangdi to ask if we would arrange a vehicle to take us to the scenic spot, and recommended the route arrangement like us. In the afternoon, I went to the Wild Animal World. In the evening, I went to the water park. You can take the exclusive passage from the hotel.
Mr. Xie Fei, who received us the next day, went to Happy World. There was a little rain in the middle, but it didn't affect our mood when playing.
The hotel’s facilities are complete, there is also a chess and card room, swimming pool is very comfortable, and a walk downstairs at night is also very relaxing. The two reception staff were also very enthusiastic and patient, which made our trip to Changlong a better experience.

msg:    Taking advantage of the end of the summer vacation, it happened that Chimelong Water Park ladies 99 yuan per person, children under 1.5m free of charge, and can not go out of Guangzhou, so come here as a tour.
    Arrived at noon to check in. I booked 2 nights on Xie Cheng. I didn’t expect that Xie Cheng would help me to book night by night separately. Fortunately, the front desk of Chimelong has handled it well and can be continued. I just booked the room for 2 nights. Room card, so I have 4 room cards. I don’t understand why Xie Cheng got it like this. Maybe it should be possible or the commission would be higher if it is ordered separately.
    I booked a wild room with a double bed. The room is quite big and there is no odor after entering the door, but the big bed is made up of 2 single beds. Although there is a gap in the middle, it does not affect the children sleeping in the middle. , But it would be better if you use a big bed to make up.
    Because the Chimelong Hotel was the first to be built, the facilities are relatively backward. For example, there is a plug on only one side of the bed, which is not enough for the current electronic crowd, and the charging must go to the desk to charge.
    The TV is 32-inch, or set-top box, not the current network TV, so the mobile phone can not be cast to the TV, you can only watch the scheduled channel inside, or that sentence, for the current digital people, it is not enough. . Moreover, there is no channel description in the TV station room, so it can only be pressed one by one, which lacks humanity. There is also no description of the hotel’s facilities in the room. Of course, it is still possible to use Chimelong’s own APP, but I didn’t expect it to adapt to digitalization instead, ha ha.
    Because children want to play in the water, so they specially booked a wild room with bathtub. The bathtub is quite big and the water is fierce. The hot water can come out in about 5 seconds, which is quite good. They are arranged separately, and they are quite complete. As for whether it is easy to use or not, it is a matter of opinion. It corresponds to the popular saying: I can use it, but you can't help but provide it, hehe.
    The balcony is large, with mosquito nets, and a clothes rack, but it’s not too big, and nothing else. For myself, I think the balcony is wasteful because we live in Building 6, and the balcony outside is just a corridor. There is no scenery, so there is no other star hotel with leisure tables and chairs on the balcony. I personally suggest that it is better to install a clothes drying rack, ha ha.
    There are 4 bottles of water on the table a day, which should be enough, but for a big drinker, I don’t think there is a small tea set with 1 pot and 2 cups, equipped with 2 packs of 2 in 1 coffee. 3 tea bags, the tea bags are still Dilmah's, ha ha.
    The disadvantage is the central air-conditioning. Although it is summer, the room is still quite cold. Even if I adjust it to 30 degrees or even switch to HOT, the temperature does not change much. For children's shoes with children, please pay attention. I am in the daytime. Just open the balcony door and close the mosquito net to increase the temperature. As for the night, you can only turn off the air conditioner when you go to bed and turn it on when you see the situation in the middle of the night. I don’t know if it’s the problem with my room or it’s the same. Anyway, pay attention to yourself with children, hehe.
    The room is the same as Zhuhai Chimelong, with 2 small boxes of keychains as gifts. The children still like it, hehe.
    In general, as a parent-child family travel, after all, the Chimelong Hotel has been open for a long time, and the facilities and equipment may not keep up with the present. But as a star hotel, I personally hope to improve it. After all, you get what you pay for Well.

In summer, children less than 1.5 meters in length can enter the kindergarten for free. Tickets for two days are really cost-effective. Yu Shuo's standard service at the front desk is very good, and the double hunting room was upgraded for free. The room is very close to the water world, and the two big and two naps are super comfortable. In addition, the services of Kong Xianghui and Huang Liujie in the VIP Center are really superb. They not only helped to apply for late check-out, but also pick up and drop off in the park on call for two days, so that I could catch up with the big circus show in the evening and on hot days. It saves a lot of roads and saves a lot of time.

msg:住宿：感謝給升級了房間，彷彿住在動物園裡，睡眠不好的晚上把窗户關好應該沒問題，酒店的房間很大，佈局很合理，和商家圖片相同，很喜歡，不過蚊蟲很多，一定帶好驅蚊用品。
氣候：這個月份的廣州經常陰天下雨，比較潮，北方人可能不太習慣，建議帶好雨具，陰天也要做防曬措施，特別是去水上樂園時，否則容易曬傷。
餐飲：去了白虎自助餐廳，懷石料理，麒麟中餐廳，價格小貴，除了自助餐，其他餐廳需要加收百分之十五的服務費，性價比不高，不過飯菜味道都不錯，小童用品比較齊全。
遊玩：去了動物園，水上樂園和歡樂世界，一個地方玩一天，帶着孩子一天玩不完，景區有嬰兒車出租，100一天，有防雨布，路上也有推銷嬰兒車的，租了一個，價格比景區還稍便宜，陪了涼蓆電扇防雨布，感覺比景區的划算啊。
總之孩子很開心，酒店服務還有互動比較到位，有機會再來。

房間有冰箱，但是沒有其他飲料，住了二個酒店都是這樣。房間空間大，孩子在屋裡有活動地方，窗户後面就是水世界，馬戲表演，歡樂世界，這幾個地方不遠都很近，步行幾分鐘就到
最主要的是白虎餐廳

設施：準備了很可愛的洗漱用品，床單上也有小老虎，還有一張小板凳，小朋友很喜歡自己搬來搬去坐。洗手的時候可以踩一下，很方便。


環境：整個酒店很大，環境也很好。還有小童樂園可以帶小朋友釋放精力，晚上人比較多，早上人少一點。樂園旁邊有保齡球，大人小孩都玩的很開心。

服務：給小朋友洗澡弄的衞生間水溢出來了，服務員也很快來清理。

餐飲：酒店的自助早餐和晚餐都非常豐富。本來對晚餐自助沒報多大希望，意外地發現種類品質都很不錯！雖然人很多，但是範圍也很大，補貨很及時，就是飲料品質少了點。

還沒入住，已經在大堂玩上了，很熱鬧，一檔檔的演出，互動。
因為都花在玩樂園上了，酒店內的設施，還沒來得及打卡。健身房，泳池，都看到了。
酒店可點外賣，不過要乘短駁電瓶車2分鐘車程，出去拿。

酒店整體被綠植圍繞，充滿了大自然的氣息。在酒店的大堂就能看到野生動物！而且內部就有一個動物島，能夠看到雪虎、火焰龜等動物，太棒了。
親子房間賊大，除了一張大雙人床外，還有一張上下鋪，孩子十分喜歡。對二胎家庭很友好。
最重要的一點是地理位置很優越，步行前往歡樂世界和觀看大馬戲無壓力，去野生動物園有直達班車，真是太方便了。

msg:很好～帶長者和娃來長隆定的酒店，小朋友很喜歡，房間空間很大，設施完備。酒店離大馬戲也很近，去長隆也有接駁車，幾分鐘一班，超級方便～酒店看馬戲還有專屬位置，很好～唯一鬱悶的就是辦理入住時間太慢了，我們早上到的，排了半個多小時才能辦理，寄存行李又排隊20分鐘，然後晚上回來入住又等了半小時……

msg:很不錯的一次親子旅行。

帶孩子打卡廣州長隆，定了裏面的長隆酒店。之所以選擇它，是因為離位置不錯，而且還是上下鋪房型。
我們定的房型是親子房，房間不小，裏面是超大的大床和一個貼了卡通長頸鹿的高低床，小朋友非常喜歡。衞生間幹事分離，一次性用具也印有卡通元素，還比較用心~
園區綠化做的還不錯，綠植很多，空氣清新~服務的話，也很不錯，配送及時。

酒店的互動還是不錯的，小朋友們都很喜歡。

白虎餐廳小朋友還能看到白虎和火烈鳥紅罐。

因為行程比較趕，沒怎麼在酒店呆著，就這些吧~感覺服務上還是不錯的，下次還去~



説點什麼吧~

但是房間設施真的需要改善，經職員安排入住了房間。 一關上房門已經聞到一股霉味。 我們馬上把冷氣調校到最大，希望能吹走異味，但係冷氣都是壞的。 另外，地氈及梳化也有污漬感覺髒髒兮兮。

經過與職員一番溝通後，最後能轉換房間，新的房間比舊的乾淨及冷氣運作正常，期間職員態度也是十分友善。

msg:入住體驗極差，上午十點辦理入住，下午三點半孩子等的不行了房間還沒有好。
入住後，房間電話根本打不到前台，衹能聯繫到禮賓部。樓上隔音極差，趕上一個沒有素質的家庭，孩子跑到半夜12點30，找人解決問題根本找不到人。最後跑前台一頓鬧，才通知了樓上，睡覺時間半夜1點。
第二天問題仍未解決，最後靠我跑樓上一頓喊。酒店設施電話都是擺設，也沒人主動處理問題。
早餐非常一般，還好意思一個孩子收98，能吃你幾口飯。
反正就是無比差的體驗。這輩子也不會再來。奉勸其他有想法的，住外面吧，打車也挺方便。

msg:住過的同級別酒店裡最差，沒有之一！
服務：第一天到店晚上八點多，一位長者、一個孩子和一位女士，三個人行李好幾件，司機幫忙放在大堂門口，服務人員站在周圍看着，沒有一個人主動過來幫忙，叫來一個人把箱子推到大廳裏就離開了。
衞生：入住的第一個房間應該是之前有人入住過，然後根本沒有整理，服務中心和禮賓部電話全部佔線，碰到樓層服務員才幫忙聯繫到前台，升級到套房，地面有垃圾，衞生間有頭髮，但是時間很晚了小朋友要睡覺，就入住了。
第二天晚上回房間，用過的浴巾毛巾都收走了，沒有換新的，聯繫服務中心給送過來了，理由是打掃衞生的時候毛巾還沒有洗完，好的方面是毛巾確實洗了，但是一個酒店的毛巾少到需要當天才洗完，而且忘記替換。
設施：第二天晚上聞到房間有煙味，但是沒找到原因，第三天一早起床推開衞生間門，超級大的煙味，樓層服務員帶了空氣清新劑過來，發現煙味太大叫了樓層經理，答約確實有煙味，很抱歉但沒有辦法，最後值班經理衹能提供個抱枕給小朋友做補償。
入住三天兩晚，每天都有各種各樣的問題，以後不會再來。

msg:帶小朋友來廣州旅遊，入住長隆酒店
我們第一次自駕過來，提前打電話問前台停車場怎麼停方便以及加裝床圍欄，客服態度挺好的，也比較有耐心。
入住當天，車子可以開到大堂位置，隨後會有禮賓部德工作人員搬行李，即使行李架不夠他們也會幫忙；雖然説工作日入住，但攜家旅遊的還是很多
可以自助機辦理入住，很方便；按照時間差不多3點左右會發消息房間打掃完畢，可以在小童樂園先玩一下。
服務：禮賓部以及自助機辦理入住的人員態度很好，看我抱孩子也會幫我抱一下

設施：酒店內設施齊全，房間備有小童牙刷以及洗髮水沐浴露也可以使用客房服務送一些小童用品（很符合親子酒店標準）

衞生：房間內打掃的很乾凈
酒店附近很多可以吃的地方，超棒，選擇性很多；其次酒店離動物園以及馬戲歡樂世界都很近；飛鳥樂園可以到大堂後面坐巴士，但自駕也很快，停車場封頂也就24塊

msg:酒店環境非常不錯，酒店內就有動物樂園，裏面有三衹老虎還有各種鳥類。運氣好的話早餐廳還能坐在白虎邊上用餐。早餐品類很豐富口味也還算可以。去的時候算是淡季，早餐廳不用排隊，還會有各類玩偶及小丑出來跟小朋友拍照。酒店交通還算方便，有班車可以到地鐵站，地鐵站周邊有商圈吃的也很豐富。

設施：房間還是比較大的，有陽台通風比較好，

衞生：保潔很乾凈，還給加上床圍，

環境：整個酒店園區都是童趣元素，很適合度假。寶寶最喜歡白虎餐廳，跟老虎一起吃飯，真的很有趣～

長隆歡樂世界：切記，帶一米一下的孩子謹慎選擇，這個遊樂園對1米以下的孩子非常不友好，雖然免票，但是很多可以玩的遊樂設施都不會讓你玩的，裡邊還有一個寶寶樂園，4個區域衹有1個可以玩，即使是平面小型蹦床，也不讓你進，孩子會很崩潰，因為在外邊遊樂園這些都是讓可以玩的
動物園：非常好，建議安排2天慢慢逛
飛鳥樂園：地點偏僻，坐車要20分鐘，裡邊可以餵動物的區域倒是比較多，建議時間富裕的可以去

msg:酒店是真的大，房間也很大，有沙發和桌子，還有獨立化粧台，一家人完全不擔心互搶位置。
酒店裡有動物島、雪虎餐廳和白虎餐廳，都能看動物，一邊吃早餐一邊看白虎吃早餐，算是實現心願了，但是窗邊的位子比較難搶，能看見火烈鳥和白虎。自助早餐種類很多，味道非常好。
關於外賣，酒店的電瓶車可以送你去拿外賣，電瓶車小哥態度很好的。
酒店距離大馬戲很近，走個幾分鐘就到了。

孩子的童年衹有一次，大朋友也跟着一起尋找快樂和童真，🏨首推長隆酒店，位置離歡樂世界和大馬戲就是一條馬路的距離，對於帶孩子的人來説太友好～

2選他的第二個理由，在長隆旗下酒店，他的性價比最高，我説的不是價格，是性價比！
3選他的第三個理由，住在長隆，去長隆的動物園啥的，都是停車免費的，挺香的😄

酒店環境不錯，就是入住時間稍晚。人多，可以理解。住這最好是別再大廳等入住，存好行李就出去玩，晚上回來舒舒服服洗個澡住一晚，享用個早餐再出去玩。
以後有機會再來住。

但是酒店中餐廳的味道真的很贊，尤其那個包子。第二天去吃的時候説那個做包子的廚師休假了就很遺憾。衹吃到了一次。
房間的洗漱用品特別贊，親子酒店對小童用品確實備的特別足，小童馬桶墊也都備有。

酒店位置
長隆酒店位於長隆度假區內，距離野生動物園南門1.6公里。酒店有擺渡車，十分鐘一趟可以去動物園。酒店大堂、房間很寬敞，花園植被都茂密。大堂吧後面就能看到白虎，在酒店能看到老虎還是比較吸引小朋友。大馬戲就在酒店附近，步行幾分鐘。
房型
我們三大一小選了家庭套房。套間內是一張大床，外面是雙床，房間寬敞明亮。我們住的2號樓，像是十幾年前的裝修風格，從大堂走到房間還是有些繞，如果選擇7號樓的狩獵房、野趣房，房型新，距離近，陽台能看到老虎和各類鳥類。家庭套房雖然有點老舊但整體還是很乾凈，佈置也很温馨，洗護用品、毛巾都是動物元素，很適合寶寶。服務也很好，服務員打掃衞生時主動給安裝了床圍，還很温馨地寫了卡片留言。
餐食
白虎餐廳是酒店的自助餐廳，早餐種類多，就餐時還有老虎人偶來和寶寶互動。一側玻璃外是白虎，另一側是火烈鳥，如果趕上兩側的位置，還可以一邊看動物，一邊用餐，飼養員也會在早餐時間給老虎喂肉可以觀看。晚餐也可以在餐廳大堂附近的彩蝶谷點餐。
寶寶娛樂
酒店大堂時不時會有小丑叔叔給寶寶變魔術、吹氣球、送禮物，高峯時期還會有動物人偶表演、合影。酒店地下一層是童趣世界，有一大片區域作為寶寶室內遊樂場免費使用。户外花園是一個小山，山下有老虎，爬上去幾分鐘有天鵝、鶴、鸚鵡。
説點什麼…

msg:被酒店的擺渡車載迷路了，上車前跟司機反覆確認去飛鳥樂園，結果司機不知道開哪裡去了，多繞了20多分鐘吧，還是在前排遊客的強烈建議下才開導航載對了路，原本計劃好的表演遊玩行程全亂了（因為飛鳥樂園的表演有時間表）。因為下午的動車，所以就在樂園裡逛了一圈看看動物就不得不離開去車站了。車輛在圖片中，不知道是不是樂園的，在酒店的等車點上車的。如果是酒店臨時安排的也應該配備個熟悉路線的工作人員才是啊。

早餐十分豐富，早餐時還有小丑做氣球和卡通互動，挺有心的，離歡樂世界和馬戲步行十分鐘以內，馬戲是亮點值得一看，歡樂世界也不錯的，尤其跳樓機有大中小三種，激流勇進很有特色。但有幾點有待加強：1. 周圍十分破舊，像來到了三四線城市，但這個無法改進。2. 無論餐廳還是小賣部，東西十分昂貴，一碗泡麪20元，兩幅撲克牌77元，餐廳吃飯一個普通套餐168元，還要加15%服務費，如果這家酒店在深山老林裏，那麼這麼貴我可以理解，他明明在市區的，卻那麼貴，非常不合理，訂外賣拿外賣的地方很不方便，要坐接駁車，不知道是故意這麼設定，給遊客點外賣造成不便，這樣可以逼遊客在酒店內吃飯或消費，物價上非常不舒服。

1  酒店前台給升了房，房間很新，孩子很喜歡，下午入住後直接去了樂園。晚上回來才感覺到房間有新裝修的味道，不是很大，但能聞到。查詢了一下，被升的房型的確是上半年新裝修的。如果酒店提前告知，我寧可不升房住原來的房型。
2 幫朋友訂的房間裏有個嗡嗡飛的蟲子，開始以為是蚊子，好不容易打下來發現是個蜂類昆蟲，朋友的娃被咬了好幾個大包（三四個硬幣那麼大），酒店給的解決方案是送個玩偶，我覺得這個方案不太能讓人接受。

msg:這次定了5天下，整體來説還行，可能是因為寒假，爆房，酒店的工作人員沒有辦法也沒有能力很好的承接那麼大的流量。跟一般的品牌五星比肯定是不行的，每天房間的清潔打掃不怎麼樣，還在每一個工作人員都還是很熱情。
可以看出酒店節約成本，住房用紙都是兩層紙，馬桶我們住的房間兩個都不能回彈，還有一個插座是壞掉的。酒店餐食是最糟糕的，外賣也不能進，超市也貴，帶小朋友不方便每一頓飯都出去吃，所以也沒辦法就衹有在酒店吃，但實在味道，品質嚴重不符合價位。
希望中國可以做出自己的品牌，我們可以接受貴，但是貴要貴的物有所值。

msg:設施完備  酒店族羣大 光酒店tour就很有料了
小朋友最喜歡和動物相處  剛到酒店就和老虎喝了下午茶  第二天一早又和火烈鳥白虎共進早餐
服務人員都和藹可親  路過也都招呼
房間很大  大寶寶不喜歡很幼稚的卡通  覺得房間裏面的塌可愛的正好  躺着也舒服
不錯的旅途

msg:房間衞生很乾凈 對比了這邊的幾家酒店更喜歡長隆酒店
長隆酒店的房間很大  還能在陽台看到樓下的老虎等
白虎餐廳也是一大亮點  就是去晚了坐不到靠窗的位置
酒店還有小童樂園 外出遊玩還有免費穿梭巴士
從酒店出發去大馬戲和歡樂世界也很方便 步行五分鐘左右就能到了
小朋友住過説很喜歡 下次還要來
