msg:Stayed at this amazing resort at the end of April for a short getaway. The moment you enter the entrance, it gives you a serene feeling. The wide entrance walks you to the reception, as a relaxing scene awaits you. The hotel itself is more on modern architecture with minimalist designs. 

Reception staff was very accommodating and friendly, he even upgraded our room for us to experience more the beauty of Alila, the assigned staff escorted us to our room and give us some heads up about what we can do and where to dine.

Since we came around late that afternoon, we had our dinner at the Chinese restaurant. The servers were all superb. We tried some of their specialties which staff recommended and we were very satisfied. 

Afterward, we strolled around for some night views and fresh air. We then saw at the bar area, the singers are from Philippines (place where we came from), it gives us an urge to drop by to support and say hi. It turned out so well, they were very happy to see someone from where they came from (We were the first, according to them). We enjoyed the cocktails and ambiance so much.

Our room was on the ground floor with an independent entrance and 2 private gardens. All is perfect, despite the minimalisitc designs. 

The breakfast buffet was served in a room facing the lake. As you're having your mouthwatering breakfast, you can enjoy the view.

Overall, our stay in this zen like resort brings tranquil zones, dropping the notch of a hustle and bustle city where we used to be.

msg:It's no exaggeration to say that I will definitely recommend ALILA Hotel WuZhen to my friends if they have plans to travel to Jiaxing.

From the moment I arrived the hotel, I felt the warm welcome from the front desk staff. I was really enjoying the warm welcome drinks, fresh pear juice provided by the check-in lobby. In particular, thanks to Sherry, the receptionist, who contacted me in advance before my arrival and kindly reminded me that thick clothes need to be prepared for the local cooling.

The concierge took the initiative to help me bring my luggage to the room and personally guided me to the room, they gave a detailed introduction of the hotel facilities and dining outlets. I was greatly moved and surprised by the exquisite welcome amenity prepared on the table in the room. There are delicate and delicious macarons, fresh fruit plates prepared with care, a bottle of fine red wine, afternoon patisserie with Zhejiang characteristics, and even a welcome letter handwritten by General Manager Nick. I can feel that Alila's staff really treat guests with true heart.

I still want to thank a boy who worked in the hotel bar. I'm sorry that I forgot his name. He patiently took beautiful photos of me on the afternoon of my arrival, recording my wonderful moment in the Alila Hotel.

I really enjoy the relaxing time in the bar of this hotel. There is a standing performance of Filipino band in the bar at night. The service provided by the band was very good. They cared about each guest on the scene and asked each guest what song they wanted to listen to in a friendly and warm manner. I was really immersed in relaxing and drinking there.

The breakfast in the hotel is well-done. The food quality and taste are very good. The breakfast choices are very rich. The only disadvantage is that the skin of shrimp dumplings is too thick. Alex, the Director of Food and Beverage, actively inquired about our stay experience and personally served us with care. The service was very good. He knew that we felt too hot when sitting outdoors and quickly helped us transfer to the indoor table near the window.

When I was checking out, the front desk staff treated us warmly as always, and gave me a sleeping pillow spray and a wash and care package as a parting gift, which greatly moved me again. Compared to the next hotels I stayed in on this trip, the hotel that impressed me the most was definitely the Alila Hotel, with its superb service.

Breakfast is delicious. Restaurant food is very good and the bar is nice, especially the Filipino singers, who were super good and nice. 

Cons: there is no kids playground (except some coins game machine). There is no park or green areas around (I asked the staff). Nothing that one can do except visit the water town (15 minutes drive by car). Pool looked nice, but we didn’t swim in it. Gym is ok. 

In general, we have a beautiful experience in the hotel. My kids didn’t get bored because we went with other friends with kids. Otherwise, it would have been boring for them.

msg:On a special day, I suddenly thought of Alila and booked it immediately. When I walked through the simple corridor from the parking garage to the hotel, I suddenly saw the lobby environment that had been presented in many online photos. Although I had seen a lot of them online, I still stood there quietly and enjoyed the visual experience for a few minutes. Check-in was very fast. I am very grateful to the front desk staff. Knowing that we came on our wedding anniversary, they also sent small cakes and red wine. The room is very spacious and bright. The small courtyard is very relaxing to sit and drink in the evening while watching the long-lost Big Dipper. The breakfast on the second day was also very rich. Several ordering items were well designed to avoid queuing for food, and the dining experience was good. This time, an additional hotel travel photo was given, which was very good. As expected, because the scene was too suitable for taking pictures, many photos were selected, but it was worth it.

The food and environment were good, especially the Taihu whitefish, which was very fresh and sweet. Staying in the hotel will give you free travel photography. I recommend taking one to leave yourself a good memory. The photographer Li Li has a very good attitude and carefully taught us how to pose. He also created an a**osphere, allowing us to relax and enjoy the fun of taking pictures. The hotel's boat tour is also recommended. Sitting on the boat in the breeze and watching the egrets flying in the sky, the boa**an chatted with us very cordially. The hotel's shortcomings are that it is not well maintained and the details are not in place. The quilt in the room is too thick.

msg:As a resort hotel, the design is outstanding, but as Alila, I may have too high expectations and was a little disappointed.
The room is very large, and the basic room type I stayed in also has a front and back yard, but there is a smell of water vapor.
The catering level is a bit poor, the main meal is okay, but the breakfast is really not the normal level of Alila or this level of hotel, which may also be affected by the holiday (?)
In addition, the maintenance of the periphery is a little poor, for example, the water quality of the small river and the Egret Garden where I will go for travel photography is obviously not very good. .

But the water pressure in the shower was really low. I hope it can be improved! The breakfast has a wide variety. The baguette + butter is really great! When I was eating, I wanted to sit near the window. The staff said that there was no one by the window right now, so I could sit by the window. It's thoughtful but I don't know how to express it! The food at Sishui Restaurant is also good. The dishes are served surprisingly fast!

The room is big, which is its feature. It has independent front and back yards. In Mr. Shi's words, the quality of a hotel is the place where he can smoke freely. Hahahaha
The reason why I like it is that the swimming pool is reserved by our family of three during the day and night. The safety lifeguard sister is beautiful, and there is also a handsome boy who is attentive and service-oriented...
In addition, the hotel arranged a free travel photo shoot... The photographer Mr. Li Li's technology and the effect of the photos are particularly good.
So I give it 4.8 points, and the other points are waiting for the next time I stay. I hope that the parent-child service will be improved.
Also, Ctrip cannot earn points for booking Hyatt members, but as a 20-year old Ctrip member, I prefer to book from Ctrip. Ctrip usually does not reflect its service, but once there is a problem, Ctrip is very responsible.

The food in the hotel's Chinese restaurant is pretty good, I recommend the crispy beef and lily and cherry blossom shrimps, but the portions are a bit small.
Finally, the hotel is not very old, but it is still poorly maintained in all aspects: the walls are peeling, the blackout curtains are derailed, the swimming pool floor tiles are in tatters, the bathing water in the swimming pool is very cold, the water pressure is also very low, and the body lotion It’s all gone and there’s no replacement. I hope the hotel still needs to spend more time on repairs, otherwise it will be difficult for such a good hotel to sell such an expensive room rate after using up its capital in a few years.

msg:I have stayed at Alila Wuzhen Hotel before and had a very good experience. Everything from service to facilities and equipment is very professional. This time I met the butler Kenny. He is not only handsome and sunny, but also considerate and considerate. The garden villa room I stayed in this time was very spacious. The hotel's breakfast was rich in variety and the lady who served in the restaurant was positive and sunny. The temperature of the swimming pool is very warm, and there is a wetland park behind it. You can see egrets walking around, and it is picturesque if you take any photo. I made a reservation at Xi Shui Restaurant tonight. The decoration style of the restaurant is bamboo forest style, and the dishes are also very particular. A very good travel experience. Will recommend to friends and will come again in the future.
Alila’s exclusive gift: Alila also prepared free afternoon tea for us. There are many desserts and teas, which is really good.
In addition, the room also comes with a minibar for the first time, with many fresh fruits and new products that are very healthy. We also provide free body moisturizing spray and sleeping spray, which really consider the real needs of the guests.

msg:When I stayed at Alila for the first time, I walked from the underground parking lot to the corridor at the front desk and saw Alila’s diverse styles around the world but the unified soul standard: the organic combination of people and natural scenery. This place is different from the "wild luxury" of Amanfayun which is too original. It combines people and scenery twice. At least I like this style very much.
When you come to the lobby at night, the first thing you see is the Chinese-style red lanterns hanging high. Zhejiang as a whole likes this element very much. For example, the Xinrongji Head Office in Linhai also features large lanterns. This red reflection goes particularly well with the Spring Festival.
The room is a four-sided glass structure with two courtyards. The size of the room and the design of the facilities are impeccable. The first ray of sunshine in the morning makes people feel like they live in a wealthy family in a purdah. The water element of the entire hotel is The theme, the reflected scenery and the blank architectural style make the entire hotel diversified. If you like it, you can take a long time and get a great result.
The Chinese restaurant is like water. It changed my past stereotype of five-star restaurants. It is very delicious. I ordered a bamboo shoot with a knife and a bamboo shoot. I was amazed. The bamboo shoots were crisper and tender than anything I have ever eaten.
Sanbai Bar is also very casual and relaxing, and the singing guys and girls are particularly awesome.

Finally, the most touching and unforgettable thing is my little brother Kenny Li. When we left, I forgot a Chanel facial cleanser in the store. Kenny was very helpful and couriered it back to me. This is a limited edition I bought in Rome. , thank you so much.

Generally speaking, Alila Hotel is positioned as a leisure resort for white-collar elites, with very comfortable and considerate services. For example, Kenny is a caring partner from the front desk, paying great attention to your needs throughout the entire stay. So before choosing to stay and evaluate, I sincerely want to say what is the basis for your evaluation? It should be the difference between your appeal and actual experience, including good and bad. For me, it was a perfect experience.

The design of the room is simple and bright. Points to complain about: The partitions in the wash area of ​​the house are translucent and sliding doors. There is basically no sound insulation, and there is no sense of privacy. It has a greater impact on resting at night, which is not a good experience.

msg:The check-in experience was poor. It was the first time I stayed at this brand. It has been a long time since I stayed at a hotel with such poor service at this price. The overall service was not coherent and even a bit outrageous:
1. I booked a pool villa. There was no introduction to the hotel or activities at check-in. I had to ask by myself. Someone accompanied me to the room, but there was no show room. They said welcome fruit would be delivered later;
2. I called to book the dinner set in the package (a foreshadowing);
3. I set off for Wuzhen. When I came back, it was almost six o'clock, but the room still had no welcome fruit. So I called to ask why the fruit was not delivered at six o'clock when they said it would be delivered immediately when I checked in, and asked us to wait; I also asked what time the turn down was. The person on the phone said it was done. I said my room was not done, so after a while, an employee with a reluctant face knocked on the door and delivered the fruit and handed it to me directly. I was a little confused. Did they intend to let me carry it in? I motioned for Tian to enter the room, and the employee left without any greetings or hellos. It was rare to see such a thing. After that, the cleaning lady came to the room without even taking any tools. It was the most rudimentary turn down I had ever seen. I saw two people in the room, the bed was open, and the ice bucket was not filled with ice cubes. Basically, all the procedures were not there. I just asked for a few more bottles of mineral water and that was it.
4. We went to the restaurant to eat first. There was no usher in the restaurant. I spent a long time looking for someone to take me to the table. Then I was told that I had a reservation. I sat down and started a long wait. I had no choice but to get up and find the waiter. He told me that the reservation was for a set meal, and then he helped me place the order. He also told me that the food here was really bad, not just bad. After eating, at about 9:30, the employee was very anxious to let us check out.
5. After dinner, we went to the bar for a drink. The employee recommended a red and white wine set meal. I said I wanted a bottle of white wine. The employee went to the machine to place the order, and then came back and said, sorry, this set meal does not have white wine. I was full of question marks❓ Then the employee replied that the wine list was printed wrong and has not been changed.
6. The next day, breakfast was a mess. The dining table was empty and no one was in charge. No one cleared the table. The food we ordered was served slowly and finally not served after we finished eating.
7. When we checked out, no one even asked how our stay was. We called a car and waited for a while at the front desk. When we took our bags out, there was no farewell and no one paid attention to us. In addition, any staff you met in the hotel during your stay would not greet you, as if they didn't see you.
Finally, I don't know if it's a problem with the Alila brand. It's obvious that all the staff were not well trained and had no sense. Maybe there is a reason why this brand has always been popular in the mainland. I don't recommend this hotel at all.

The curtains were pulled too low and were wrinkled. I couldn't notice the details. I didn't expect that the garbage everywhere after checking out was really unbelievable.

msg:When I came to see the Wuzhen Theater Festival, I happened to stay at Alila. The hotel was designed by Elephant Goa, so the overall style is very similar to the water mirror in Tianmu, and then there are light-colored independent buildings. There are no issues like the poor attitude of the front desk mentioned in the reviews I saw two years ago. The front desk Thera I met this time is professional and considerate, and will add WeChat to facilitate contact needs. Upgraded to a 78-square-meter garden villa. I really like the shadows of the trees in the courtyard and the sunlight in the room. The lobby is a large area of ​​water just like the West Lake State Guesthouse, with restaurants, bars, etc. all around. It's not a room card, but a key with a wooden tag, which is quite special. The breakfast room has a great view. There are many places to have breakfast indoors and outdoors. Benedict egg & omelet (only protein omelet is optional) are available in unlimited quantities. Freshly squeezed watermelon juice is also available this season. The dinner restaurant had no faults, the shredded eel in oil was made with good ingredients, but there was a red meat that was not photographed, which was not very tasty. The indoor swimming pool is kept at 28°C, and the outdoor swimming pool looks very clean and sparkles under the sunset. The hotel’s bar is called Sanbai Bar, named after Wuzhen’s Sanbaijiu. It is a long and wide space. From 9 to 11 o’clock in the evening, there are foreigner singers who sing well. All indoor mini bar drinks are free, the welcome fruits are apples and cakes, the coffee machine is Nespresso, and the tea bags are TWG. These are all basics. The TV is Samsung, and the brand of toiletries is Italian Labottega, which is customized by the hotel. I have never heard of it. Finally, there is a one-hour singing bowl concert, where you can lie down and rest quietly. All in all quite satisfied.

The hotel uses a lot of white walls and blue tiles in design, which can be said to well reflect the Jiangnan water town. Outstanding elements include SPA, bar, Chinese restaurant, and swimming pool. Boating on the lake to see the egrets is a major feature of the hotel, which is full of experience. This time I stayed in the Waterhouse King Room with a unique courtyard design. , the leisure space in the front and backyard is full of vacation feeling, and the butler Charlotte Hu’s service is meticulous and enthusiastic.

The hotel has a full-time housekeeper. Darren, the guy in charge of us, was very nice. He not only sent us to the room, but also introduced us to the various facilities and equipment in the room. He also thoughtfully told us that the drinks in the refrigerator were free, and we would also return them the next day. They will considerately take care of the accommodation situation. They also thoughtfully packed afternoon tea when leaving the hotel. I give it a big thumbs up.
We had dinner at the hotel's Chinese restaurant, which was relatively average and carefree, but there was a service charge, which was quite surprising!
In the evening, there is a young lady staying at the "Sanbai" bar, which feels very good. In November in the southern water town, the temperature at night is also very suitable, which makes people feel infinitely relaxed.
The next day we also took a cruise in the wetland. The "uncle" who rowed the boat was super nice. We originally made an appoin**ent at 12:40, but then we temporarily moved it up to 11:30. The uncle was on his way to eat, and he came all the way back without any complaints. Yes, they also told us a lot of wetland stories and some local customs during the itinerary. It will definitely be interesting to bring children next time!
Generally speaking, the hardware environment is very good and the software services are also good.

I have been delaying it for a few years because of the masks. I finally took advantage of the 10th anniversary of the Wuzhen Theater Festival to check in this year. The overall style of the hotel is very suitable for a holiday, especially Thera at the front desk was very kind. We arrived a little early and helped us upgrade to a villa room, which is very similar to a villa in Southeast Asia. The only thing I was worried about was that there might be mosquitoes in the villa, but luckily I didn't see much of them. I was also very satisfied with the breakfast the next day. It ended at 11 o'clock, which was suitable for my wife and I to sleep in while we returned from a run and had dinner at 10:30. Overall very satisfied and will definitely come again in the future.

What's remarkable is that there was a female colleague at the swimming pool on the morning of October 14th. My dad got his shoes wet, and she took the initiative to come over and help. Thank you very much. This hotel must give full marks in terms of service! The teachers at Singing Bowl are also very nice. Although there are only two of them, they teach attentively.

I used to go to the Park Hyatt🌰 as my first choice when traveling. I thought it would be fine as it is also a Hyatt hotel, but I ended up with a terrible travel experience.
The small problem is that the room has a strong musty smell, but considering the humidity in Jiangnan and the first floor, it is understandable
The dramatic point is that the baffle above the TV background wall fell down at around 1 in the morning, making a huge sound. The person who was sleeping at the time was suddenly awakened by the shock, and was dumbfounded when he saw the photo. If this happened, It was during the day, someone happened to walk by, and the consequences were unimaginable.
After the incident, the response of the guest relations depar**ent was also disappointing. They only gave a verbal apology and sent two toiletries. Because I was in a hurry and had no time to argue. Compared with the one at Park Hyatt Sanya a week ago, the price was the same, but the experience gap was huge.

One thing is that the level of waiters is uneven. I wrote a small note to the delivery boy to help me clear the table and clean the table. However, the note was taken away and the table was not wiped. I thought the hotel staff at this price were all well-trained, so I was a bit disappointed.

msg:The architecture and landscape design are really amazing, and it is a perfect place to escape from the world. But the actual living experience, especially the design, materials, and supplies in the room, is really difficult to describe. Except for the sides of the bed and the sink, there are no sockets available anywhere else. The mini bar refrigerator has poor cooling effect. The welcome fruit is two apples. The indoor humidity is so high that the dehumidifier fills up a tank of water in less than half a day. Breakfast has few varieties and average taste. The floor of the shower room probably didn't drain well, and there was still a lot of water on the floor after one night. The bedding has a mediocre feel, and it doesn't seem like a good brand for hygiene. "Jinqiao Paper..." is printed on the inside of the roll. The hair dryer feels cheap, loud, and doesn't have enough wind power. I didn't sleep well for three nights. The form of the hotel is far greater than the content. Just come and take a look, your stay is not as comfortable as the whole season. There are commercial shootings in the hotel every day. At first glance, they are photos of product albums for online stores. The hotel does not regulate this, which greatly affects the guest experience.

msg:Alila: Surprisingly Different Unique, a state of surprise

"Alila" comes from Sanskrit, meaning "surprise" and is born for surprises.
Ever since I got to know Alila, I have been very fond of the style of her home. From the first infinity pool in Ubud, Bali, to the cliff birdcage in Uluwatu, it has become a unique holy place for vacationers.
Alila Wuzhen, as the only remaining Alila store in China, has become the reason to come to Wuzhen again this time. The elements of the Jiangnan water town, black tiles and flat eaves, water light reflection, water system, courtyards, lanes, geometry, light and shadow, lines, are minimalist and beautiful, gentle and tough.
The Shuishikou Restaurant for breakfast is named after the old floating market in Xizha, Wuzhen. It is built near the water, an ecological wetland, and has beautiful scenery as far as the eye can see. Breakfast is an a la carte semi-buffet, with not many varieties but exquisite products.
The indoor heated swimming pool and the outdoor swimming pool also enjoy the wetland landscape, which is beautiful in one word!
The overall experience of this stay was full of satisfaction. I would like to thank the hotel Leslie for her considerate and considerate service. Not only did she help us upgrade the room type, she also helped us delay check-out. The whole process was perfect and happy.

The housekeeper Leslie contacted me the day before and upgraded our room type for free. The hotel front desk also gave us an extra breakfast when we checked in.

The housekeeper also arranged late check-out and free afternoon tea, which made the whole Wuzhen experience full. Needless to say about the environment, compared to the 5-star hotels outside, this Villa-style hotel really feels like a vacation. Anyone who comes to Wuzhen should come and stay once!

1. The entrance and exit of the hotel are relatively hidden, and they were accidentally opened. I just drove past and turned around;
2. The car parked at the door and did not see the waiter waiting for the first time, the hotel at this price should not be;
3. To put down the luggage, you have to go back to the entrance and go to the ba*****t. There is a problem with the design of this moving line.
4. In the room I lived in, there was always the sound of equipment starting and stopping at night. I was woken up at 3 o'clock, and I thought it was the sound of the neighbors opening the electric curtains. Later, I found that it kept repeating, probably not, but it was almost dawn, so I had to bear it;
5. The hotel can be repaired and updated, and some construction quality defects are not so delicate.

msg:I checked in on July 31st. I took my children and elders to Wuzhen for the night. I chose Alila Hotel for the first night. When I checked in, the staff at the front desk saw me coming in and didn’t ask me if I checked in. I took the initiative Said that I want to check in. During the check-in process, the staff did not introduce to me any recommendations for things to do around the area. Later, the staff added me on WeChat, thinking about housekeeper management and the like, but I have no experience What kind of service did you get? At the beginning, I chose a room to take us there. As soon as I entered the door, there was a super musty smell. There were two or three purifiers in the room. Later, I quickly changed a room for us, but the air conditioner could not be adjusted at night. , I called an engineer to look at it, and said that I needed remote control, but it didn’t seem to work. It was very cold, and there was a sliding door in the room that was broken. When I slept at night, I saw bugs on it. It was very inconvenient to take a shower and go to the toilet. This may be caused by plants, this can be tolerated, but the place that cannot be tolerated is that the bath water is very small! ! ! Really small, uncomfortable bathing experience. The praise of this trip is that the scenery of the hotel is really good, the experience of the outdoor swimming pool is also great, and the buffet or restaurant in the hotel tastes good. When I checked out, the staff asked me how my experience was. I said it was not very good, it was a little bad. They also said they would call me, but they didn’t receive it. I personally feel that the experience of 2,700 yuan a night is not worth it~ The overall service of the hotel needs to be improved, and it does not provide high-quality services to the guests. But the hotel's cleaning and boa**en are always smiling and welcoming, which is worthy of praise.

The hardware is nothing to say, designed by a well-known designer, relying on the wetland park. Opening the door of the room, a strong musty smell hits the face, and the quilt is wet and very uncomfortable. The service is even more difficult to explain. The design of the hotel is like a maze. When I asked the passing service staff where the restaurant is, the service staff didn’t know what to do and said that they came to help by themselves. Bad brand reputation. It is recommended that Internet celebrities come to take pictures and open it, and check-in is free.

I absolutely agree with the beauty of the hotel when it first opened, but as time goes by, the mottled walls and floors and the aging of equipment can be seen with the naked eye. It can only be said that it is beautiful but it is a thing of the past.
If you don't go, you can't feel its beauty in person, but if you go, it's a pity that you don't feel its most beautiful time.
The service is very good. After check-in, the guy at the front desk will lead the way to the room. He has a detailed introduction to the hotel facilities and room facilities. Children's toiletries and slippers will be arranged proactively. If the staff is free during the check-in period, if there is a need for takeaway They will also help get the room, and take the initiative to help throw away the garbage bags on the car when they leave. I feel that every link is very considerate, and I hope to continue to maintain it.
The minibar is relatively generous, at least the Baisui Mountain is unlimited, and it is much more conscientious than other established hotels that charge various fees.
The breakfast threshold is also the most conscientious hotel I have ever stayed in. My two children generally have height restrictions. Here, it is free for those under the age of 12. Although the dishes are not particularly large, there are not many types of food. It is enough to eat And it tastes good.
A heartfelt suggestion, the wooden floor is really not suitable under the bathtub. Hope Alila's beauty can bloom again.

There are many Internet celebrities who come to check in and take pictures, but I am here to "drink" afternoon tea! Furthermore, too many Internet celebrities really affect the experience, not only noisy but also forced to smoke second-hand smoke for a long time, I suggest you set aside a non-smoking area to come out.

He was a gentleman and guided us. When we checked in at the lobby, I realized that he was Wu Fei, the front desk staff. When we checked in, the handsome Wu Fei personally helped us with our luggage, took us to the room, and patiently introduced the room supplies to the room. He was friendly and professional! This stay experience is very good, next time I go to Wuzhen, I will stay at Alila again!

Except for the old white design and decoration and some small details that need to be improved, the overall experience is not bad! Just live and cherish it, after all, there is only such a family in China...
Wuzhen is a bit cold in March, but luckily the room has floor heating, the hotel is well designed, you can get movies everywhere, and the breakfast is good, especially the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows...
You must go to the "Sishui" restaurant for dinner! All delicious! Especially the deep-fried river prawns in Taihu Lake! too delicious!
After dinner, go to "Sanbai" for a drink, there are Filipino singers singing!
It takes only ten minutes to get to Wuzhen by car from the hotel!
The score of this experience is completely brought back by the service of the hotel Leslie! Handled very well! Thanks again!

The breakfast restaurant can also see the view of the wetland on the side. There are not many types of breakfast but the taste is good. The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is delicious. The set meal for two is very cost-effective and enough for a family of three. The price of a la carte is a bit expensive, but the quality of the dishes is good and acceptable. The bedding in the room is a bit hot for sleeping, and the sliding door in the bathroom is a bit leaky. It would be better if it can be improved.

Environment: The Jiangnan water town is designed with water features everywhere. You can also see the Egret Wetland Park when you have breakfast. It was winter when I came, and I feel that the scenery will be more beautiful in autumn.

Service: The service is very good, and there is an exclusive butler service. This time, the butler Xiao Cao has a good service attitude and is very timely. Give me a thumbs up.

Alila exclusive courtesy: It is the hotel's body mist, which tastes good.

Breakfast: There are not many types, but the taste is good, the ingredients are fresh, and you can order freshly cooked meals

Although I saw a lot of people giving negative reviews to Sishui Restaurant, the actual dining experience is very good and the taste is good. The price of this place is at this level, so don’t compare it with farm food. Remember to arrive early to get a seat next to the bed.

The density of the entire resort is not high, the sound insulation is very good, the room design is reasonable, and there are front and rear yards. Overall, it is a good experience. Today, I also experienced the Sanbai afternoon tea, which is a perfect end to the two-day weekend!

I really like the design of the cloakroom next to the bathroom. It is very convenient to change clothes and take things. Disadvantages: The courtyard landscape lights tripped as soon as they were turned on, and the waiters who came to check were not tall enough to touch the switch, and guests needed to open the switch by themselves. The main switch in the room cannot control the bathroom. After turning off the master control before going to bed, you have to get up to turn off the light in the bathroom. These details cannot stand scrutiny.

Environment: The design of the hotel is top-notch, with a minimalist Jiangnan water town style, and it is very good for casual shots. Designers can make good use of light and shadow to create a silhouette-like beauty on the building. Sitting on the sofa in front of the window and reading a book on a sunny afternoon is very pleasant.

Service: The basket for room delivery was broken, and the waiter only delivered it to the gate of the courtyard wall, and asked us to bring the food in with the broken basket. The breakfast is a semi-buffet, the food is quite satisfactory, and the Western-style dim sum tastes average; there is porridge, but there are no side dishes to accompany the porridge; before I finished eating, a waiter came and took away my tableware in a panic. There are two sinks in the bathroom, but only one piece of hand soap is provided, which is inconvenient to use. I feel that the training of waiters needs to be strengthened. After all, it is a boutique hotel with a nightly accommodation fee of 2k, and it needs to be more refined in all aspects to be worth the money.

The hotel's Chinese restaurant is also delicious, and there are many choices for breakfast. The Egret Park next to the hotel is suitable for bird watching, there are many water birds, and the ecology is very good. Next time I come to Wuzhen, I will choose Alila again. I like it very much.

I personally told the location of the lobby, checked in and went to the room, and washed my hands as soon as I came to the room during a special period) All the bad experience began) The switch on the washbasin is hard to get off. Looking at the mirror at the top of the counter, there are stains and dust under the mirror box. Turning around to look at the bathroom, the storefront is also dirty. Well, think about it, it is not troublesome to change rooms in this special period, and it is ready to burn. Order hot water, the kettle has a lot of white spots, and the large mineral water bottle is covered with dead leaves. Let's see for yourself the hardware and software... I came here in good spirits and returned in disappoin**ent!

msg:Let’s be honest: it was a pretty shocking experience.
First of all, I stayed at Alila during the rainy season, and the humidity was very heavy. The quilt was a thick winter duvet and down pillow, and it was wet. I got up in the middle of the night with my best friend to change pajamas for the second time. It was soaked, and my head was buried in it. Inside the down pillow, it feels like I have just washed my hair, and the central air conditioner is blowing cold air above my head. The results can be imagined. Horrible, won't go there again. The next day, I turned off the air conditioner, ordered an electric fan (which was broken) and two dehumidifiers, and poured water by myself (the hotel staff couldn't do it).
Secondly, hotel employees wear many hats, so you have to be patient and wait for service.
In the end, despite all the dissatisfaction, the hotel's fixing methods still somewhat calmed down our anger. Thank you! There will be no date later!
PS: This is a fragment that should not be kept in memory, so I didn’t leave a single photo.,,,

Although very few people checked in due to the epidemic, everyone from the luggage boy to the front desk staff did their best. Thanks to Sherry at the front desk, and even more thanks to the girl at the front desk who was on duty in the afternoon of the check-in day (forgot to ask for her name). She took the trouble to explain the clouds and water to us. The difference between them, try our best to meet the needs of customers.
The waiters and the lead singer in the evening bar are also very professional. They sang a love story for us. The bartender also made delicious cocktails to light up the empty night.
The design of the room is full of sense of space, simple and perspective without losing shape, with green plants embellishing the coldness of reinforced concrete

msg:I have always heard about this hotel, but it is only now because of the epidemic. Although it is not the best season, but there are not many tourists but it feels more comfortable.
The design of the hotel achieves a blend of architecture and environment, which makes people feel very relaxed during the day and night. There are floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides of the room, and there is a small private yard outside the window. When I wake up in the morning and open the curtains, the sun wakes me up from the window. I feel free and relaxed at this moment. The big mirror on the sink in the room is definitely a particularly flattering design.
It is worth mentioning that his breakfast and the bartending in the bar are very good beyond my expectation. In the morning, enjoy a buffet breakfast slowly in the sun-drenched lobby, and in the evening, order a drink at the resident bar to chat with friends, which can cleanse your impetuous heart due to the fast pace of the city. I will go again if I have a chance.

A good hotel Relying on the environment and excellent employees alone is not enough for a soul without management. Although it is not easy during the epidemic, there is a chance in adversity.

The disadvantage is that the first floor is a bit damp, and you can smell musty when you enter the room, so the room is equipped with an incense burner. When the weather is cold, the floor heating can be turned on. Maybe it can be improved. Another disadvantage is that there are not many sockets, except on both sides of the bed. , there is at the vanity mirror, but there are no sockets in other places, not in the courtyard, and not at the sofa in the room. If you can equip a few more sockets, it will make the stay more convenient.

msg:A particularly satisfying trip. First of all, I would like to thank the warm service of Bonnie's sister at the front desk.
Since I am usually very picky about travel requirements, I compared many hotels. My friend recommended Alila in Wuzhen, and decided to choose Alila in Wuzhen. Before checking in, I consulted the hotel's check-in requirements and traffic and parking issues in detail, and got a detailed answer. Entering the hotel, I was shocked by the design of the hotel. Walking in every part of the hotel felt like a perfect holy place for taking pictures, and there were scenes everywhere. The hotel's infinity pool is very beautiful. It's wet outside. Unfortunately, the weather turned cold and didn't go into the water, but it didn't affect me taking out my mobile phone to take pictures. This is thanks to Bonnie's introduction, otherwise I won't find out. I will have a chance next time. When you stay again, you must try to swim a few laps in the water. The bar's resident singing is also very good, listening to the singing and drinking special cocktails, intoxicated by Alila Wuzhen.

The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety, the afternoon tea and salty products are relatively in line with my taste, and the dinner is quite satisfactory. The hotel is very good to take pictures, but after all, it is a little old. The room is old and the facilities are perfect, but the humidity is a little heavy. It is necessary to arrange a dehumidifier, otherwise it will be easy to have peculiar smell. The facilities gave full marks, the gym and swimming pool are open 24 hours.

There are many kinds of breakfast and it is quite good. In the evening, we went to the water restaurant to eat. We ordered a two-person set menu and then added drinks. Except for the expensive drinks, the cost-effectiveness of the dishes is good. The two-person set menu is more than enough for three people.
The bar at night is really a**ospheric. I ordered a cup of Baileys, and the price is quite cheap. I took a look at the gym and indoor and outdoor swimming pools, which are pretty good.

This one in Wuzhen has always been on my wish list, so even if I knew it was not a parent-child hotel, I chose it with my family, and the result was really It is indescribable. First of all, the hygiene situation was unexpectedly poor. There were obvious urine stains on the toilet seat and it was not cleaned (it was busy when I arrived, so I didn't take pictures). I immediately called the front desk, and the front desk asked the cleaner to come over and wipe it. After wiping, it said that it has been disinfected. I always feel that this star hotel should be a serious mistake, but it turns out that the hotel does not pay attention to it. At the same time, there is a layer of ash on the toiletries, and there are marks on the underside of the mouthwash cup. The overall feeling is that the hotel does not pay attention to hygiene. Second, when we arrived at the hotel, the car went around the door twice to find the entrance, the garage came up with a pile of luggage, and the front desk searched twice. I understand that Alila's style is simple, so the signs are all designed, but in a 40-degree day, there are no signs, and no one can ask. The experience is very bad. Third, the hotel has no place for children's activities except the swimming pool. I knew before going there, but I didn't expect a row of game consoles (outdoor) beside the front desk. Because the hotel really has no place for children to play, so I took the children to play for a while at 8 o'clock in the evening. It was dark, hot and full of mosquitoes. . . . There are many other shortcomings, such as only one tissue box in the room of more than 100 square meters; the hand card in the swimming pool locker room is a key ring, and I don’t know how to keep it, etc. . . . I feel that there is nothing attractive about the hotel except to take pictures and punch cards for a day. Not recommended.

msg:Thank you Qiandao Lake for your unreserved kindness
If it's such a hot day, we might not be able to dig sand outdoors.
Qiandao Lake proposes not to accept tourists from Shanghai
I temporarily decided to go to Alila Wuzhen instead.
The whole hotel is stunningly beautiful, and the swimming pool is enough to swim in.
I remember the last time I went to Alila was Chris**as
Mulled wine and homemade biscuits are available at the front desk
This time the ice drink at the front desk tasted too bad😂
But the service in the hotel is unparalleled
Although I ordered a lot of things from room service, they were not delivered in the end.
But the best thing is that the service staff always greet you with a smile.
It doesn't matter if it makes you angry
Praise the skinny and seemingly small lifeguard at the swimming pool
I play with my children all the time. I love my work very much and have enthusiasm.
The room includes two Chinese meals, the quality is very good👍
The air conditioner in the bar was too cold at night and the singers had few Chinese songs.
The hotel industry is not optimistic during the epidemic
I hope Alila Wuzhen will always maintain her original aspirations and work hard💪
Forgot to mention, the breakfast is also very delicious, I don’t want to go home😂

The building is indeed very photogenic and has a great sense of design, but the maintenance of the room is poor, and the details of the crotch are pulled; 2. The number of service personnel is insufficient, and the quality of service and personnel feels better. It's like a homestay standard, not a luxury international brand; 3. As a resort hotel, except for swimming pools, gyms, and spas, there are no other entertainment facilities. What else can you do after punching in and taking photos...

When I see children staying with them, they don't bring children's toiletries. I call for a cotton pad for an hour. The only thing I brought was a cotton swab. The cleaning staff didn't add paper towels, there weren't enough towels and bath towels, and the restaurant staff didn't smile. As a five-star, the soft power was not up to the mark. The bar was very satisfying. I went there for two consecutive nights. The resident singer sings very well, which makes people feel relaxed

msg:The waiters are not professional and the service is not proactive. When it rained when we checked in, there was no battery car in the entire park. We went to eat breakfast with water. When we wanted to check out, we asked the waiter to help with the luggage. He came with a leaking convertible cart. We were quite shocked how this car was installed in rainy days.
With the luggage, the waiter stood dumbfounded and said nothing. Finally, he gave up the convertible and pushed the luggage to the lobby with an umbrella. The stroller was two-thirds wet. It's really raining days that expose the flaws in their service. What's even more speechless is that, after checking out, we have two big boys, two small ones, one suitcase and one stroller full of things, but no waiter stepped forward to help us. 2,500 yuan, can we only get this kind of service? The waiters were too indifferent and not enthusiastic at all. I won't go there again. Friends, you can go here to take pictures of concave shapes, but if you want to get better service, it's probably gone. I also have to complain about the mosquito repellent, which is bad. There are many mosquitoes in the room on the first floor. The whole family woke up at 11 o'clock in the middle of the night and called the front desk to change it. Not checking before going to bed is also based on trust in them. There is no equipment similar to a children's playground in the park, only a swimming pool. Breakfast has very little variety. The room is on the first floor and the wooden floor can't block the rain and bathtub water. The wooden floor is moldy and rotten, so it can only be regarded as a net red hotel.

The front desk service is quite decent, so I waited for a while. The little brother was very helpful and brought his luggage to the room.
The overall variety of breakfast is relatively rich, and there are quite a few semi-buffet-style people, but the service is in place
If there are not many people, it is very suitable to stay and empty, there are many net celebrities taking pictures

The last "existing" Alila Wuzhen is now the only one that has lived up to my expectations! The architectural environment is so beautiful! Compared with the "Liangrang" that I just checked in a few days ago, I personally prefer the "big" architectural a**osphere here, but the former is better in terms of artistic details. Alila Wuzhen, which uses light and shadow art to shape the "new water town" in the south of the Yangtze River, takes the villages in the south of the Yangtze River as the prototype, and plays with the interesting mix and match design of geometry, lines, and light and shadow. Every frame taken here is a kind of beauty. This is the uniqueness of Alila Wuzhen!

🏠The room layout is different from that of "Good Soil". The rooms of Alila are all like small single-family houses (large space). This time I chose to stay in the "Water House King Room", a "one bedroom and one living room" of about 10*** meters.

msg:Known as the best resort hotel in Wuzhen, Alila

I think it’s because there are really no large hotels to choose from

No staff at the door voluntarily came to valet parking, and there were few parking spaces, so they could only park on the side of the road.

The interior style is a typical silhouette of the south of the river. Corridors and pools build the overall structure of the hotel. Considering the relationship between the overall scale and the separation from the public area and the accommodation area, there is still a distance from the room to the restaurant or gym. It's not very friendly for summer.

Because the room facilities are wood veneer, the outdoor door is very old, even though it has only been opened for more than two years? The floor texture is also not very good, stumbling. The mini bar only provides soft drinks and Tsingtao beer. The toilet in the bathroom is a bit small. The trees and grass in the small yard are beautiful. The bathtub is huge.

The overall experience of breakfast is average, the noodles are tasteless and overcooked, and they need to be prepared, and there is no joy of self-seasoning. There are not many other types of buffets. They are similar to the three-star hotel in terms of selection, and the quality will be better, incomparable to old-brand hotels.

Well, there are really too few gym equipment, two treadmills, an elliptical machine, a bicycle machine, a multi-function rack, and a set of dumbbells. It’s much better to have a barbell. And there is no dedicated coach watching.

In general, the style of the hotel is novel, but the facilities are lackluster.

msg:The hotel is quieter than expected. There is no legendary internet celebrity to take pictures and check in. The night view is particularly beautiful. We were lucky. Both dinner and breakfast were seated by the window, and the view was beautiful. The outdoor swimming pool is facing the Bailu Wetland Park. The water temperature is very comfortable, and the water will not be cold in rainy days. The children have a great time.

msg:It is a good vacation choice when you can’t travel far. The hotel is full of beautiful scenery, and it feels like a big shot at hand. The wetland landscape directly opposite the restaurant and the swimming pool is also beautiful. The service in the Chinese restaurant and bar at the front desk is superb.

The only minor flaw is not enough to communicate with the local current political planning. I often see modern buildings or tower trucks on construction sites.

msg:In the summer vacation, I took the children out to play and chose the Alila Villa with its own swimming pool.
Parking guidelines: The first time I came, I drove to the destination and went directly to the hotel's underground parking lot. The garage walked to the hotel lobby. It was a bit of a road. I walked by the sign. There was no staff to lead or assist in moving luggage.
Hotel environment: When you come to the lobby, Alila's style scenery comes into view, simple, low-key and comfortable.
Room environment: After check-in, enter the room, which happens to be the anniversary. The hotel has provided proper decoration, thank you very much. Due to the good ecology, crickets jumping happily will be seen in the room, and a small centipede is crawling in the bathroom. There are also spider webs on the bathroom storage compar**ents. The kettle was stained and asked to replace it. It was a little cleaner but also... the waiter said it was due to the water quality.
Hotel food: The hotel's Chinese restaurant tastes good. We said that we played twice in three days and ate three meals. We had all the basic and delicious foods in place. We strongly recommended braised abalone with braised pork.

msg:The hotel is not big and the mirror is beautiful, but the room layout feels general. It is rare to see that the shower room is pulled with a curtain. The floor tiles are slippery when wet. No wonder there are handrails beside the basin and toilet, especially beside the basin. The handrails in the room take up space and are ugly, as if in the hospital, the space around the basin is also very small, and the washing supplies can only be placed on a board next to it, which is very cramped. The air conditioner in the room is around the ceiling, and the wind is blowing right on the bed. It is on, cold, and hot. I don’t know how the designer thinks about it. The hotel’s breakfast is good, and the Chinese restaurant is also good. PS: Ctrip's reservation system is incredible. I booked for two nights. The average price of the two nights was more than 4000. However, the average price of the two-day selection was more than 2,000, and the two-day continuous selection was not based on the average price. Everyone booked the room. Attention.

The pool villa booked by a friend, waited from 3:45 to 5 o'clock to clean the room. This service is amazing! The check-in time is clearly written at 3 o'clock! The equipment and facilities are quite old, especially the floor in the room, sofa and bathroom floor are old, dirty and yellow. The price for more than three thousand a night is very low. Finally, I vomit that Ctrip's price fluctuates too much. It is recommended that you call h and book a room directly with the hotel.

Linna, especially want to praise her, her attitude is kind, and she has a strong sense of responsibility. Before moving in, she did not forget to reconfirm the rounds.

If you bring children, you must see the road clearly at night and don't let the children run around... The details still need to be strengthened, for example, the chairs in the courtyard are covered with moss and cannot be used; and For example, the waterproof ***** at the door of the bathroom is inclined outward, and water on the glass door flows directly into the room...

The fruit is fresh and tastes like a child. Talk about the shortcomings! When I checked in, I told the bellman to change a latex pillow, but it never came. I came back from the scenic spot at 9:30 in the evening, the restaurant was already off work, and I couldn't order a meal. The room is not equipped with soap, so it is inconvenient to wash some small clothes. There are too few trash bins in the room, only one in the washroom and one in the toilet, not in the room. The bathtub is very large and deep, and there are no handrails inside and around it, which is not safe enough. The buffet breakfast has many varieties, but the taste is average, not as good as the dishes in the Chinese restaurant.

msg:三星給到阿麗拉的硬件和設計
作為中國唯一的阿麗拉品牌酒店，我對其期待很高
但可能期望過高，失望也大
為了參加烏鎮戲劇節，早早訂好了20號的酒店，即使在景區外，也毅然決然的選擇了阿麗拉，希望這趟旅程的體驗無論精神上還是身體上都是極致的
1，酒店提前打電話確認來的時間，並問是否需要特殊備品，這點中規中矩
2，到達後停到地下停車場，再到check in大堂，有點距離的，但並沒有人問行李的事兒
3，check in是快速的，也態度温和，被經理領到住處（很遠的一間房間），簡單的介紹了房間，加了微信，我提出是否有一次性泡澡袋，原意是提供我自己鋪，但小姐姐説可以晚點阿姨來給鋪好，還能鋪的專業點，這點好加分，所以即使沒介紹Wi-Fi ，拖鞋等用品在哪兒，也無所謂了（歡迎水果是倆大蘋果，和四塊硬點心）
4，去戲劇節，回到酒店後，期待泡澡洗去疲憊，但進門發現，浴缸是原樣的，找了十分鐘才把所有簾子關閉，然後聯繫前台找阿姨來鋪浴缸袋～並微信告知經理情況～
5，阿姨來了後，很突兀的站在門口問：是要幹什麼，我愣了下表示要麻煩鋪一次性浴缸袋，她又問：是沒有，不會鋪嗎？我腦中空白了下……回答您更專業，我也確實沒有……好了，鋪了10分鐘，鋪個寂寞，袋子不夠大，阿姨也不會鋪……我説阿姨我自己來吧，辛苦您了，她尷尬的説：到底還是你自己鋪的，我走了哈……我衹有無語
6，第二天經理回覆：不好意思忘記和你確認方便的時間了，就沒鋪……我沒整明白這句話……然後我説預約的酒店活動我可能不去了，有點累，她説：沒事的，我會再給您微信，您沒回復我就取消……然後就沒然後了，這個微信是不可能有的
7，我的價格包含一頓晚餐，我換成了午餐，預約好後落座，服務員給了菜單，並問喝什麼，點了荔枝茶～很快上了～這時候另一個服務員拿着套餐單子給我看，原來包含的餐是固定的菜單，也合理的，點好後，過程中所有東西要催兩邊，整個餐廳4桌客人，四個到五個服務員，愣是沒服務過來，大家都窩在出餐口不知道在幹嘛
8，高潮來了，我吃好飯，走出餐廳被攔住，説我消費89元，我又大腦空白了……我説是飲品要錢？她禮貌的説是的……我臉騰的紅了，我説：89不貴，但你在點餐前是不是要告訴我，是要收費的？你明知道我是預約客户……我不是很理解
終於走出了阿麗拉的大門，我下決心必須寫點評，要不然我一股火憋出結節
7月份去杭州入住人均1500+民宿酒店，雖然規模不大，但服務極好，管家加微信後説到做到，所以來到阿麗拉，我是充滿期待的
當然作為此規格酒店，2000+非旺季價格不算特別高，你説讓客人單純享受你們的設計，硬件環境，我也接受的
那就不要假模假式的加微信，做服務承諾，最後做不到不説，就根本沒放心上，還有各種蠢，感覺客人被反覆play
我會覺得你認為中國客人的錢太好掙了，但現在酒店內卷，真的不是非住你真裏的，我有這錢寧願支持高端品牌民宿

1.房間：首先，第一次給的房間進去之後3隻在飛的大馬蜂，地上還有一衹死的。跟我們説房間是才收拾出來的，如果才收拾，為什麼打掃阿姨沒看到？服務人員來了之後，發現屋外聚集了更多蜂，實在離譜。其次，第二次換的房間晚上斷斷續續的噪音，不知道是什麼儀器傳來的。泡澡的浴缸水龍頭漏水，接了一半洗澡水才發現地上漏了一大片。浴缸和沙發等細節還都臟臟的有污漬。
2.服務：入住之後加了前台微信，第二天早上有幾個問題想問（退房時間、周邊路線），一直到我們退房才回消息，並且還來要五星好評附加他的姓名。這個合理嗎？酒店管理層是怎麼要求服務和好評率的，用這個方式考核嗎？
3.早餐：酒店小早餐種類不多可以理解，但是味道實在很一般，麪一大份拿來已經粘在一起了，片川味道也就是鹹味。麥片已經不酥了，生菜有苦味。

酒店優點是建築確實有特色，拍照好看，看過一次就可以。午餐中餐廳味道不錯。但整體對比其它同等級五星別墅度假酒店，很有差距，不值得再來。

msg:前前後後入住過4個晚上。酒店整體設計不錯，但是做工細節慘不忍睹。
1.房間內的大門開容易關很費勁，需要超大力關門會產生很大的噪音。
2.空調出風潮濕並有黴味。
3.部分地板掉漆，赤腳走路的話會粘在腳底
4.洗手池的木底板變形裸露
5.浴室沒有掛毛巾的地方
6.花園最好能加裝紗窗
7.最好加強一下廁所的隔音
8.梳粧鏡容易砸到後面的玻璃
9.沒有音箱
10.室外景觀的水池略臟
11. minibar的門不合理，可以説摺疊式的減小面積

1. 房間真的一大股黴味（如果是個別情況算自己倒黴），雖然服務員有提供空氣凈化器，但是也解決不了。估計是因為比較潮濕導致的，床品都感覺是潮濕的。
2. 早餐，很多菜品（比如麪，蛋卷，煎餅）都是需要單點的，然後上菜時間確實有點長（點了雪菜肉絲麪，至少等了15分鐘），人多的時候服務員忙着收拾桌子，也顧不過來。

手機能投屏説明一直在更新。
風景和設計無懈可擊。
小蚊蟲有一些，但是可以接受。
酒店範圍裏一直有人進入拍攝，不知道是住客還是餐飲食客。
酒吧旁邊的桌球室完全無人管理，感覺很混亂。

msg:五一跟女朋友去阿麗拉烏鎮度假 我們是提前在攜程購買的兩晚的水舍大床房套餐（套餐裏包含了一箇中餐館的晚餐/下午茶二選一）對於酒店設施後期維護以及服務的熱情都很滿意 創意工坊的剪紙和小熊塗畫也非常有趣 很chill 但是中餐館的晚餐與套餐中的菜單相差甚遠 （減配相當相當嚴重）詢問中餐廳工作人員後得到了“季節變化 食材不同的答覆” 然後就是spa館 不允許使用折扣券 （説是我們是提前買的套餐 這樣對spa館不公平？） （即使是提前購買的套餐 五一的價格也與平常週一到週五和普通週末價格是不一樣的 所以不知為何會有對spa館不公平這一説法）三白餐廳的288烤肉自助晚餐很棒 水市口早飯餐廳很棒 健身房 游泳館 很棒 總體來説 玩的很開心 單純吐槽中餐館和spa館

房間一走進去就有黴味，院子也打掃得不怎麼乾淨，浴缸、牆、地毯這些看着都不太清爽，導致整體入住體驗並不算好

Spa無功無過，價格略高

水上餐廳價格雖然不高，但是東西不好吃，上菜也很慢

整體服務也一般

如果是以度假為目的，我不會再去第二次了，不夠舒服，不夠放鬆

環境：真心覺得一般了，有點失望。

設施：水池清理的不及時，顯得很臟。泳池水温涼，就沒用。房間裏還停水，有點意外。

衞生：一般般了。

優點：有免費做手工的項目，感覺還不錯。如果考慮住的話，強烈建議先來看一下，是否滿意，滿意的話再訂，避免踩坑。住一天就可以了，沒必要住很久。

1、服務人員態度還可以，算是熱情
2、酒店外觀設計，也正是這點估計吸引了一些網紅，如果不是為了拍照，不用來這家
3、早餐OK
不好的方面
1、房間黴味非常非常大，可以薰**
2、住了酒店這麼多次，櫃子裏竟然有蜘蛛網（見圖的左上角、右上角）就這一點就夠了，這衞生怎麼敢來第二次？
3、酒店很大，外賣送來，前台各種理由不送到房間，服務意識和這價格形成鮮明反差

msg:一家衹能住一次的酒店，能打的衹有外部環境
入住期間不好的體驗有：
1.房間設施老舊，門鎖不上，晚上風大會被吹開。衞生堪憂，外面院子裏的沙發椅子上全是落葉無人打掃（連住兩晚都是這樣）
2.服務意識差到跟快捷酒店一個檔次。房間內電話撥打前台無人接聽，需要在攜程上找電話用手機聯繫。
3.外賣禁入，送到房間需要在門口簽署免責協議（此條能夠理解）
4.中餐廳需要預約，前台在入住時並沒有告知。第一天碰壁，第二天找前台轉接電話無人接聽，連續去電三次表明需要預約就餐才有餐廳經理聯繫。餐廳不優先安排住店客人就餐，下午一點就被告知沒位置，説明是因為餐廳不接電話的原因才給安排。晚餐的一道小青龍等待35分鐘才上桌，但是好在經理處理問題態度不錯，給了免單。
5.西餐廳位置難找，味道一言難盡…主廚對待客人的點單大聲在廚房喊真**
是一家讓人難以再次預訂的酒店

由於是白灰設計，設施長年運行後的老舊感就凸顯出來；房間的黴味也非常影響體驗。

msg:首先想説的是這是一家讓我很失望的酒店，無論是硬件設施還是服務。訂房的時候選擇的是水舍大床房，面積10***米，但真實房內面積衹有一半這樣，因為所謂的院子面積根本就是無效面積，房間內設施讓我感覺就是住了個全季，沒有做到與其價格一致的設施，敷衍的洗護用品，吹風機……房間內衞生狀況也不太好，甚至潤膚乳罐子上還有上一個客人擠殘留在瓶身上的乳液。另外所謂的Alila專屬禮遇，寫的是兩人spa單品，我相信不止我一個人以為是兩個人的spa一次，結果經過我在房間打電話才得知，是所謂的spa單品噴霧？！説是退房時候前台領取？？！結果第二天退房，服務員衹字不提，我也完全不感興趣了，遍也不想再提了。總之這是家名大於實的酒店，希望這樣的噱頭可以少一點，專心做服務做硬件設施，而不是做一家很需虛的“網紅酒店”…

硬件設計都不錯，但就跟以前住過的阿麗拉一樣，軟件總是缺口氣。服務人員大多數都算熱情，但是衞生做的實在太差了，健身中心的淋浴房裡衞浴容器的噴嘴全是鐵銹，不知道是多久沒清理了。五金也都是水漬斑斑。房間裏角落灰塵，玻璃污漬到處都是。建議加強衞生保潔方面的培訓和管理。

msg:一家網紅酒店，設計有點標新立異。酒店地下車庫指示不明顯，門口沒有接待生，很容易錯過入口。另外，酒店管理比較差，入住酒店的當日下午睡午覺，被樓上裝修吵醒。打電話問前台，前台説工程部沒有通知他們……。酒店大堂經理處理還是比較妥當，馬上給更換並升級了房間。
酒店風景不錯，可以拍拍照。酒店餐飲一般般，純粹就是一個網紅打卡適合拍照的酒店，不回再去了……

msg:🚗 交通：很方便，道路也很好。
🧹衞生：衞生間瓷磚本來以為是沒打擾乾淨，仔細扣了下發現應該是瓷磚“病變”。這個真的是扣分項，美中不足。
🍃環境：很安靜，每個房間都是獨立的，不受其他人影響。
🔔服務：遇到的工作人員都很有禮貌，微笑服務。
床：對於這個價格，我覺得兩床的房間用1.3的床實在小氣了。完全放得下兩個大床，多舒適呢，體驗感好很多，我們一家三口，最後衹能我睡沙發了。睡一起翻不了身。
餐飲：早餐還不錯，值得一提的是小餛飩很好吃，可惜每碗衹有6個，第二天我戴了口罩***的説能不能一碗10個，我實在不好意思跑兩趟。哈哈
泳池：疫情防控做的很好，需要重新在這裏登記行程碼綠碼和體温。就是不是恆温泳池，裏面的冷死，外面的曬太陽。回家我就感冒了。

msg:阿麗拉，我之前關注很久，也很憧憬這個酒店的風格。然後趁着七夕情人節跟老公兩個人去瀟灑下。酒店的風格還是很簡約大氣的，服務也很周到。但是不知道是不是最近的雨天導致酒店蚊蟲很多，我老公在三白酒吧坐了一個多小時就被咬了十幾個包，腫的很厲害。然後房間還是蠻潮濕的。可能是我本身是過敏體質，對酒店房間乾淨度要求比較高，如果滿分10分的話，我給房間的乾淨度打7.5分。浴缸給人乾淨也不太乾淨。總之有點小失望。

msg:帶着長者和孩子江浙滬10日遊，期間從上海到杭州再到烏鎮阿麗拉到蘇州再回到上海，本次行程體驗最差的就是烏鎮阿麗拉。中午入住，公共區域沒有遮陽的大樹或者棚頂，所以非常曬。大家到房間稍作休息，吃了午飯，要去烏鎮玩。酒店裡麪到處有水景，但是維護的不好，樹葉以及各種臟臟的東西漂浮在上面。我就很怕孩子一不小心掉進臟水裡麪。住在這裏，如果你自己沒有自駕應該挺麻煩，距離烏鎮還挺遠，酒店沒有車接送你哦。好在我們有租車自駕。晚上遊玩回來9點了，發現房門打不開，不知道為何，他們的門鎖仍然沿用普通鑰匙，門鎖故障打不開，先是找前台過來，等了很久才來，前台來了説自己弄不了，原地發微信叫工程部的人來。工程部的人大約二十分鐘，慢悠悠拿着一個備用鑰匙，來弄了兩下，説，打不開，就走了。此時我們已經在門外等了半小時了。又熱又累，前台説，我們也沒辦法。我説，叫你們值班經理來處理。我們又在門外等了二十分鐘。我徹底被激怒了。這是個什麼酒店啊，要不是看在他號稱是凱悦的高端，我絕對不會選擇住這裏。前台走到我們房間不過五分鐘路程，怎麼叫個人來處理問題這麼難！孩子爸去前台理論，值班經理才出現，總算打開了門進去了。想着快點洗澡休息了。結果發現，浴室下水不暢（下午已經請他們修理了一次），而洗漱台漏水漏的一塌糊塗。到處都有黴菌黑黑的很噁心。洗浴用品用的品質也很差，是那種散裝的，不是品牌的。毛巾浴巾全部都已經破破爛爛，非常舊。此時已經無力再去爭執，衹想湊合一宿明天退房離開。孩子餓了，我叫了餐廳送餐，餐送到之後，要立刻拿走送餐盒，送餐人員不進來，讓我自己端吃的，主要是這種院子式的房間，要進兩道門的，還得端菜，手忙腳亂。晚上睡覺，發現，插座很少，需要自己在手機充電器和電蚊香之間做選擇。第二天我們吃了早點就收拾準備退房，孩子的姥姥去酒店的商店看看，想買點東西，問服務員，你這是什麼材質的，回答：盛唐牡丹。問這個是圍巾還是方巾，回答：盛唐牡丹。問這個多錢，回答還是盛唐牡丹。令人哭笑不得，衹好離開，在出門的時候，玻璃上沒有任何標識，長者家撞到了頭，而服務人員衹是笑了笑，完全不過問。孩子想去游泳池玩水，可是早上吃早餐的時候，我們有看到，酒店對游泳池水的處理衹是用清潔機吸掉臟東西，服務人員説，沒到換水的時候呢。以往我們住過的五星酒店，人家每天最起碼也要循環換掉半池子水的好嗎。因為對室外水池子的心理陰影，我就沒有去游泳。中午大家説，在這吃頓便飯在離開，打電話叫行李車，等了有30分鐘未見到人影，以為是酒店忙不過來，我們一家老小衹好自己提着大包小包到大門口，發現，三個行李車都空空的閑在那邊，很多工作人員走來走去，也不知道在幹嘛，禮賓台的人説沒人叫行李車呀，我不知道，跟我説沒用的，你們找前台。種種原因使得我們非常不滿。當天投訴到值班經理，衹是來聽我們説完，道了聲對不起，就離開了。酒店沒有任何有誠意的表示，這樣的設施這樣的服務，對不起凱悦的品牌，對不起幾千塊一晚的房價。餐廳用餐三次服務尚可。希望大家謹慎…

拍照非常好看～然後這裏要提個建議，如果房間裏有全身鏡就好了，很多人拍照換衣服，沒有全身鏡就很麻煩～還有就是畢竟一樓非常潮濕，進門會有一點黴味，可能是地毯之類的發出來的，江南水鄉沒有辦法～儘量不要用地毯吧～

客房服務員幫我們拿孩子的洗漱用品態度很好，一直有笑臉給了好評。

第二天早上起來吃早飯，餐廳的服務員（男女）均態度冷漠，毫無笑臉，讓我覺得他對他的工作並不滿意，也沒有絲毫的熱情與企業自豪感，雖然他都提供給了我需要的東西，但是給我的感覺特別不好。

最最最讓我無法忍受的是，房間異味很重，應該就是網上很多網友説的黴味吧。還有酒店衞生好臟！！！地毯臟，床品感覺很濕並不乾爽，玻璃推拉門的縫裡好臟！！！看着巨難受。床底下都是蜘蛛網。沒有多拍一些照片，算我失誤，真的希望其他朋友可以避雷。我下次如果還有機會去烏鎮我是不會住這裏了。

説了這麼多缺點，我説一下優點吧。

一、酒店外觀分分鐘出片。

二、進來的地方，就是去地下車庫那裡的幾個工作人員（類似保安幫我們登記體温啊那些）態度很好，見到我們都會禮貌問好。

阿麗達，很美的名字，據說原意是“驚喜”，不過，我更喜歡理解為“一位美麗的少女”：依水而居，清而秀，與黛色烏鎮是姊妹花
用了一個想念很久的早餐，陽光垂落，湖景搖曳，美食溫馨
唯一的遺憾：電視投屏分享不太好用。但喜歡小哥小妹們的笑容：明天會更好
是的，相信的，明天會更好。最好的品牌並不是沒有缺憾，而是面對缺憾時真誠的笑容：我們會會改進

msg:攜程首頁給我強推的酒店讓我失望至極。
出發前一天上海台風很嚴重，我8:30打電話去前台問是否可以改期，因為我存在不能出行的可能性，前台一問三不知，全程一句：“預訂不下班了。”我當時就想可能我訂錯酒店了，這個服務實在配不上這個價格，但之後我打到攜程去，客服態度十分好，讓我覺得很安心，於是就選擇了繼續相信。沒想到，“阿麗拉烏鎮”真的沒讓我失望啊！
第一間房間裏有濃烈的下水道氣味，我媽媽聞了頭暈，於是換了第二間，第二間房的下水道直接塞住，洗了一個5分鐘的澡，水就漫出來了…
説早餐很好吃，餐廳裏就我們一桌，還有蒼蠅飛在我的食物上。
説夜景很美，我一個專業做夜景的，晚上走了一圈，嚇壞我了，在一個充滿水系的環境裏，水岸邊竟然連個安全警示燈都沒有，隨便一腳就能摔下去的程度可以説是，“看夜景嗎？會摔死的那種！”
最後説一下服務，服務給三顆星完全是因為那個來我房間給我送除濕器的阿姨人真的很好，我覺得她很辛苦才給的。但是前台就很棒棒了，我退房的時候告訴她，我換的這間房下水道堵住了，我考慮到衹是洗個澡就走，就不去麻煩了，但我沒想到你們酒店會有那麼多硬件問題，她聽完很公式化地説：好的，我會派人去查看的，歡迎您再次入住…凱悦現在就是這麼解決問題的嗎？我也懶得多説，但我不會再去了，所有的阿麗拉我都不會再去了！

黴味——一進房間有股很大的黴味，一連看了三間房都是這樣的情況。衞生間和浴缸還有屋頂都有發黴跡象，和異味。
服務——酒店前台不允許延遲退房，必須12點之前退房。我們定了兩間房，因為有寶寶所以想要相近一點的房間照顧寶寶方便，checkin的時候給了兩間離得很遠的房，走路要好幾分鐘還要過一條橋！再三詢問後前台堅定的説沒有空房了全部訂滿。我們去房間看過後實在不能接受於是再次與前台強硬交涉，給了我們相鄰的兩個房間。我的疑問：既然明明有同房型的相鄰房間，我們也未要求升級，為什麼一開始不能照顧寶寶需求直接給我們想要的房間？有沒有把客人的需求放在第一位？就因為是週末不缺生意嗎？
總結：不會推薦任何人選擇這家酒店，不會再來第二次
