The breakfast was too shabby and not worth the price of 88 yuan per person. It was quite different from the Courtyard breakfast in Xi'an. There were not many categories and not high-quality products. The tofu was sour.
The air conditioner in the room was not very effective and I had a sore throat in the morning.
The hotel grade is online, but the service at the front desk during check-out is very offline. There are four or five people standing at the front desk, and they don't say a word during check-out, which is indifferent. But the girl at the front desk was okay when checking in.

msg:When traveling to Qinhuangdao, I chose the Courtyard by Marriott. Let me share my personal experience. As a five-star hotel in Qinhuangdao, no one was responsible for picking up luggage and driving the door. The front desk had an indifferent attitude throughout the entire process and the service was not enthusiastic.
During the stay, the hotel did not proactively provide guests with services that a hotel should have such as turndown service. The person responsible for answering the hotel service phone also had a bad attitude. When the guest mentioned the need for turndown service, he mentioned the hotel's turndown service. A service that can only be enjoyed by Marriott Platinum Cards (after staying in so many Marriott hotels, this is the first time I learned that this hotel’s turndown service is only provided for Platinum Cards. I had never heard of it before. In addition to administrative trea**ent, the hotel Treated differently than others) and the tone of answering the phone is unfriendly, which makes the guests uncomfortable.
The room showed on the Ctrip order that it was equipped with a purifier. The purifier that was delivered for the first time was very dirty. I didn’t know whether it was purifying or contaminating...
The water pressure in the room fluctuated, and the toilet in the room was covered by an electric curtain, but it was not covered seamlessly. It would be a bit awkward if two people on a business trip lived together.
The public lawn of the hotel. I saw that the hotel was advertising a large lawn auditorium that day, so I wanted to go there and take a look. After sitting on the lawn for a while, a fat security guard came and said that entry was not allowed here, not even for hotel guests. Wedding venue, okay, I can understand if someone is setting up the venue or wedding scene that day, but why is there nothing on the lawn that day? As the only comfortable outdoor venue in the hotel, can't guests even sit down? ? Since they are not allowed to enter the hotel, why should the lawn be used as a publicity? And can there be a sign at the door not allowing entry? ! Unable to understand!
In addition, the hotel has opened a cute pet park, but after looking at it, I found that two rabbits were lame... There was no water or food in the bowl. I hope the hotel will pay attention to the health of the small animals when opening the park...
The day after communicating with Ctrip, the hotel's guest relations manager called and learned what had happened. He replaced the purifier and provided corresponding room service and turndown. The next day, there was also a dedicated driver downstairs at the front desk. Door and luggage (I don’t know if I will not be there on the day of check-in)
Overall, the experience was not very good, but fortunately there was someone to deal with it. I would like to give a thumbs up to the hotel guest relations manager and the guy wearing glasses and a suit at the front desk! I hope the hotel’s staff management can be strengthened...

msg:The hotel is located in a remote area, not suitable for going out at night, and it is deserted.
There are no supermarkets or places to eat near the hotel. You have to go ten kilometers away to order takeout. The food in the hotel is very expensive. For example, a bucket of instant noodles costs 12 yuan, which is three times more expensive than the market.
There are many waiters standing at the door, which is formalistic and embarrassing.
The sound insulation of the hotel is average. The fruit plate was delivered after two calls.
The mirror on the left side of the room is not designed properly when you enter the room. It is easy to be scared at night when you are not paying attention.
There is also a door in Room 17 on each floor, which feels very strange. It is separated from the next door by a door. If a girl lives there, there will be hidden dangers in safety.
Overall, as a five-star hotel under Marriott, I think it needs to be improved.

There were large trucks whizzing by at night, and the noise was still very loud. I don’t know whether it’s because the hotel is too far away from the city or for other reasons, but a big smelly chick actually appeared in the room.

msg:Service experience: I extended my stay twice, but the last time I extended my stay was very bad. First of all, when we checked in on the first day, we called the front desk half an hour in advance to ask if there was a room because we needed to check in first and put our luggage. If you don’t have any luggage, it’s okay to leave it at the front desk, but the reply on the phone was that you could come and check in, so we took a taxi directly. When we arrived, we were told that we didn’t have any luggage and that it was locked. In the last 10 minutes, we probably had to change rooms before we could check in. On the night of check-in, I was woken up once every three hours. There was noise in the room, and the traffic on the road was very loud, as well as the sound of bang-dong-dong. As a result, I woke up at 6 o'clock in the morning and couldn't fall asleep. I reported to the manager at noon and they changed the room to a quieter one that day. It was late, but it turned out to be facing the garden, and was woken up by the wedding at eight or nine o'clock.

Feelings about staying longer: Despite the fact that the manager changed the room, we still trusted the hotel and chose to check in again. Then we were told that there was no room available. I understand that there are many people on Saturdays and Sundays, so we stayed in another hotel for one night and returned in advance. I asked the front desk manager to help us change the buckwheat pillow and put two extra pairs of slippers. The manager took note of the room we stayed in before and agreed to it. However, when we came back in the morning, nothing was left. The hotel staff said that they were negligent in handing over the work, and finally said that the waiter was too busy. forgotten. So what is the effect of our calling in advance?

As a result, I continued to stay for the last time. When I came back that night and lay down after taking a shower, I saw that the sheets were dirty, and there was a small red dirty thing that looked like blood stains. I couldn't lie down and asked the waiter to change the sheets.
Overall feeling: The hotel is worrying from check-in to service process and environmental sanitation. If you stay in a hotel, you need to observe more before choosing. You should also check the surrounding environment and hotel facilities. Remind everyone to pay attention! ! ! !

Facilities: The facilities I care about, such as safes and ironing boards, are available in the room. One disadvantage is that there are three elevators, one of which is not linked, I don't know why. In addition, there is an elevator whose floor keys are in the reverse order of the 8th and 9th floors (as shown in the picture), which is not appropriate for a serious hotel like Courtyard. These details reflect the hotel's lack of excellence. Even this can make do, so can cleaning the room also make do?

Service: The receptionist is very friendly. But the cleaning service staff forgot to add tea bags and instant coffee to me, so professional training needs to be strengthened

The child sat on the swivel chair in the room and knocked against the TV wall, and his ears immediately swelled up. He called the front desk to ask if there was any medicine for the child to wipe. The response was no. From the beginning to the end, he did not care about how the child fell. He said If you need medicine, you can order **, I order ** to deliver the medicine, the location is relatively remote, and there is no delivery. **I don't know if it can be sent to the front desk? The second time I called, I got angry. The child fell and hurt himself in the hotel. Is it appropriate for such impetuous customers? I don't know if someone changed to answer the phone. The safflower oil and ice cubes were delivered in about ten minutes. If I just get by without getting angry, that's how I deal with it. Inadequate emergency services. Dinner is at the restaurant. The good thing is that the service is very friendly, and the dishes are not big. Children must eat potato shreds. The fried potato shreds are not put in a drop of salt. I originally planned to change it, but the child said that he didn’t want to wait. eat. There was no big table for breakfast. When I was getting coffee, I told the leader at the door to accept a big table for us. She said that she couldn’t leave. I said that you couldn’t leave because you were chatting (it seems that a manager was chatting with you next to me). In short, The car window was left open all night and no security personnel contacted me. In the morning, I found that the car window was left open all night. The experience was very bad. All aspects need to be improved. In the picture, the child's ears are still purple four days after check-out. Of course, as a parent, I am not optimistic about the child's negligence. I care about the service attitude of the hotel.

It’s less than 1,000 yuan, including two breakfasts and one lunch and dinner set meal. This set meal has three meat dishes, one vegetarian dish, and one staple food fried rice. It’s almost 400 yuan to eat outside. The price of accommodation in a business and economic hotel The five-star standard, apart from the fact that the location is in the further development and construction of the development zone, is very friendly and worth the money for self-driving travelers. Although there was a small episode in the breakfast the next day, the flaws are not hidden. I have stayed at Universal Studios in Beijing all the way. Chengnuojin, Tongzhou Beitou Luxin, Zhangjiakou Xingyuan Metropark, Xueruyi Metropark, Chengde Blue Horizon Hotel, Qinhuangdao ClubMed, Qinhuangdao Marriott, this Xinhe Jiye Courtyard is the most honest one, although the location is not dominant, But it does not affect the quality of the hotel. With the development and construction of the city, there may be unknown changes in the future. It is recommended to experience accommodation by self-driving. It is more convenient to come by high-speed rail and plane. The pictures of the dishes are only remembered after eating and prepared for evaluation.

When checking in, the service staff were very enthusiastic and patient, helping to press the elevator and push the luggage. Electric curtains are very convenient, but I don't know if it's a problem with the windows, it's a bit noisy, especially when sleeping, the sound of the sports car outside can be heard very clearly. But overall, the price/performance ratio is okay.

msg:I stayed in the hotel this time because I was sending my children to school, and I chose this hotel because it was relatively close to the school. During breakfast time on the 2nd, the child took off his braces and wrapped them in a napkin. After the meal, he returned to the room and lost them on the dining table. Remembering that some time has passed, I went back to the restaurant to look for it. At that time, the supervisor, manager, and waiters of the restaurant were all searching very hard. They ran to the processing room, rummaged through all the sundries, and found braces for us. We would like to thank the restaurant staff for their hard work and excellent service. Because of you, I fell in love with this city and your hotel. We will meet again.

The service is very good. They take the initiative to help press the elevator and help with the luggage before leaving. The only thing that needs to be improved is that the children's breakfast is recommended to follow the latest national regulations and age, not Sheng Cong. It is not in line with the development of the times.

In particular, little brother Liu Kunpeng helped us carry our luggage into the room in the middle of the night, and explained the surrounding facilities of the hotel all the way. He was very professional!

msg:Asking friends to travel, just want to find a comfortable hotel away from the sea and don't care too much. I have always liked Marriott, so I booked this one this time. The hotel is very new and the hardware facilities are very satisfactory. There was a handsome guy with the surname Gao welcoming and decent in the lobby during checkin. Several people felt very good. But it was too bad the next day. The room was cleaned and the cups were not cleaned. The three dirty cups were still in place, and the spoons were not cleaned. They asked the housekeeper to change a few new ones. The housekeeper replied "We do not change new ones." , And there is no service for brushing the cups. "It's maddening. I have never encountered such a weird hotel. Could it be that guests are allowed to brush their own cups every day? At any rate, it is also considered as a Marriott hotel, and this service is too bad for the brand. After tossing about the three cups for more than 20 minutes, I was speechless.
As shown in the picture, your service staff actually explained that "I am afraid that the guests want to continue drinking after the dumping, so I dare not pour." It convinced you. Encountering this kind of thing too affects the holiday mood.

再説房間隔音，我去的時候不是會展時期，入住率極低，所以上下左右房間的隔音我不清楚。但是外部隔音極差，酒店離主幹道大概有80--100米，車輛經過的呼嘯聲都能一清二楚，特意去更換了朝北的房間，這樣窗户對着的是次幹道，離道路大概有150米的距離，這樣晚上睡覺車輛經過的聲音都能聽清楚。
再説房間温度管理，當地温度是零下3度，房間温度是25度，
空調完全不能製冷。整晚都在和温度做鬥爭，凌晨3點才迷迷糊糊睡着。
問同事休息的狀況，都是太熱，太吵，都沒休息好。這是我最差的一次五星級體驗了。以後再也不去這家店

最後一晚的一個人的晚餐在2樓的日式鐵板燒進行的，非常不錯。服務周全，食材新鮮高檔，廚師的手藝很好！值得點贊！餐飲部的郭經理的服務留下深刻印象，值得稱讚！

酒店從環境到服務到飲食都非常贊，但有個問題就是距離有點遠，因為在開發區周邊設施建設不完全匹配，沒有車的確實不是很方便。
如果不是完全為了到海邊度假純休閑的話酒店真是不錯的選擇，隔音效果好，遮光效果也好，被子床墊枕頭都很舒服，非常乾淨。早餐選擇比較多，菜品豐富且新鮮。
非常不錯的住宿體驗！

msg:已經是第二次入住了，因為第一次印象不錯，所以這次去秦皇島再次入住！房間很乾凈，浴巾和床單也都非常潔白無異味，房間不小，雙床房裡床是1.35米的雙床，和孩子睡一個床不覺得擠，老公因為需要開車，單獨睡保證睡眠質量！户外的花園草坪孩子很喜歡，可惜沒有拍照，劉威的服務也很周到，這次入住體驗很好！感謝！

1、化學氣味太重。剛裝修吧屋子和走廊的化學氣味嗆得難受，至少應該除除味吧，沒紗窗開窗通風就進蚊子，走廊密不透氣，感覺自己是化學悶罐的醃漬物。
2、噪音極大。位置偏僻荒涼就算了圖個安靜，但半包圍緊挨酒店的不知是國道省道還是啥，前半夜山上炮響，後半夜貨運大卡車沒斷過，平均幾十秒一輛，感覺自己睡在火車站。吵得崩潰一整晚沒睡着。
3、預訂的房型提供空氣凈化器，進屋沒有。因為太嗆打客服要，回答説不能保證安排上，我説您盡力安排，客服不耐煩反覆重申不能保證有，雖然最後提供了，但真不是國際酒店應該有的態度。
