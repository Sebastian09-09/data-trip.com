However, I did feel that for the price, there might have been better options in the area that were more worth it. Worth comparing a bit more if you are looking right now.

msg:This was my second time staying at the Ritz and it was another amazing and relaxing trip! We booked the garden villa and it was everything we expected. Our butler Jarvis was very attentive and accommodating and made our trip the best it could be! He really was one of the best parts of the trip. He booked our reservations for dinner in a timely manner and always made sure we were taken care of! He also brought our deliveries from the lobby to our villa. Breakfast was good with many options. The facilities were all completed from my last stay and were very nice. The meals offered at the various restaurants are very delicious and worth the money. Overall, my stay was amazing! I will definitely we be staying here every time I travel to Sanya. 

A few updates/ suggestions  I would recommend . The villa pool is covered  by trees so it doesn‚Äôt get much sunlight in the winter. So I would recommend trimming the trees that surround the pool. The deck for our villa also needed some updates because it had many loose boards. The last thing is, with the epidemic situation, I wish they would have enforced  everyone to wear masks at the buffet. Besides that the stay was nothing short of fantastic! Will stay here again for sure. 

Again, thank you Jarvis for your hard work during this rough time and while being short staffed. Looking forward to our next trip.

When we asked to talk woth the manager we were told ahw would call us back. She didn't. I did three follow up calls and still the manager did not call until I called for the fourth time. 
Also I asked the front desk to make a reservation at Sofia restaurant for me. They did not do it until I asked a second time.

It seems the staff don't talk with each other and often forget things. Very different from my experience last year at the Ritz which was perfect

msg:This by far is one of the nicest resorts in all of Yalong as well as Sanya. The Ritz not only offers wonderful stays, but also customer service that can hardly be matched by others. Thank you to Demi for our late night check in, and helping us adjust our booking on bed preferences. 

Room: very clean, ample water, fruit and useful toiletries. 

Amenities: 
buffet breakfast is really hard to beat, we woke up really early each day to make the 7am open and it was perfectly quiet and peaceful. The mix between western and Chinese food really soothes my soul. To finish a big breakfast off, the pastries and snacks are absolutely delicious. The hotel restaurants are a bit pricey if you missed the buffet, but and absolute must try if you can!  It was quite easy to Waimai goods over, so it‚Äôs always a good alternative. 

The beach was under construction but The Ritz has its own sandy beach type area for lounging, volleyball or soccer. You don‚Äôt really miss out on anything and it‚Äôs still lovely. 

The pools are wonderful, I especially loved how many lifeguards and staff were available at given point, feeling safe and cared for. 

Although it rained a bit, we were still able to enjoy much of what was on offer, however we did seem to miss out on the lobby bar- which looked nice, too.

The food at the hotel was delicious! And there was lots of variety! Really good on the tastebuds! I‚Äôd recommend the hotel BBQ! The best buffet we‚Äôve ever eaten at! 

The hotel itself was incredible! The grounds were immaculately kept, both inside and outside! Our room was perfect! The bed was super comfy and the room was spacious with fantastic views of the sea and surrounding areas. 

The benefit of the Ritz Carlton was its private beach! When going to the beach, it was never crowded and we had lots of space! There are also several pools in the hotel to relax and swim. 

If you‚Äôre planning a trip to Sanya, I‚Äôd highly recommend this hotel! You will not be disappointed and you won‚Äôt want to leave! 

Special mention to Budi and Winnie. Two members of staff at the hotel.

msg:The hotel is nice, maybe a bit old-fashioned and dark but better maintained than others at the same bay. 
Unfortunately the Italian restaurant Sofia was closed. We had had dinner there before so it was one of our reasons to choose the Ritz-Carlton and we were disappointed. 
Other than that we liked the pools and the beach restaurant Sand with live music. 
They don‚Äôt have any lounges directly at the beach as there is not much space (other than at the Marriott at the same bay), but at least there is a swimming area which was great! And they have a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù beach upstairs. You just can‚Äôt directly look at the sea which we would have liked. 
The service at breakfast could be better (eg asking for a second coffee) but the selection is decent.

I‚Äôd definitely recommend going to Sofia Italian restaurant and Sand restaurant for delicious food. My girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed the Spa experience provided by the Ritz-Carlton.

msg:As soon as I entered the hotel, the concierge at the door was smiling and each of them was given a Ritz chain, which was a very good welcome ceremony. However, this feeling did not last when I checked in. The check-in staff had no smiles on their faces. Because I arrived at the Ritz around 13:30, the room was not cleaned yet, and I had to wait for about 1 and a half hours. So here comes the problem of facilities: there is no air-conditioning in the entire Ritz, public areas and corridors outside the room (not that there is no air-conditioning, but that it is not turned on). The receptionist took me to the spa to wait for check-in, and the air-conditioning had to be turned on immediately. It took more than an hour for the whole space to become cool. It felt very hot and irritable during this hour. It is recommended that the hotel should at least provide a cool area for guests to wait if they need guests to wait patiently for check-in! Hygiene: After checking into the room, the good impression returned. First of all, the sea view of the room is great. The most important thing is that there is no dead corner in the hygiene. It is really clean. I touched every pillar in the hotel lobby with my hands. There was no dust. The glass I saw was wiped very bright. One of my three stars is for the hotel's outdoor landscape design, and two stars are for the cleaning management and cleaning staff. During the three days and two nights I stayed, the cleaning staff was busy, but they were able to smile and greet the guests warmly when they met. They are much better than the hotel reception staff! Service: I won't mention the name of the housekeeper here. Obviously, the training was not in place. He actually asked me at 1:00 pm on the second day of my stay what time I would check out on the third day. Do you want me to leave quickly or arrange for the next wave of guests? I checked out normally at around 12:00 on the third day. The housekeeper asked me at around 11:10 if I needed to clean the room and replenish disposable items? ? ? After I checked out, the car I called arrived. The receptionists at the door were chatting there, and the doorman just stood in the corner and looked at me. They had no sense of service at all, such as welcoming guests and helping them put their luggage in the trunk. It was not until we all got in the car and I was about to close the door that a receptionist hurried over to see us off. I don't care about these points about the housekeeper and the receptionist. I am targeting the people in charge of training and management at Ritz-Carlton. You are Ritz-Carlton, not an ordinary hotel. You have the brand value of a luxury hotel. How are you responsible for training? Catering: I ate both breakfast buffet and dinner buffet in the hotel. I thought that breakfasts in big hotels are similar, but the breakfast at Ritz was perfunctory (the hot and sour soup noodles were really delicious, but there was nothing else to eat), the cut fruits were randomly cut, there was no uniform shape, and the cut watermelon pieces were half the size of my palm. Again, you are Ritz-Carlton, not an ordinary hotel, even the breakfast chef should be careful, and your customer flow is not very large. As for dinner, it was very good. From the ingredients to the degree of care, it was obviously different from breakfast. The fruits were also sliced ‚Äã‚Äãaccording to the shape. It seems that they are not incapable of doing so, but they are not attentive to breakfast. Luxurious atmosphere: The overall red tone of the hotel has a Southeast Asian palace style. The materials used outside the room are all solid wood, which is solid, thick and majestic. The eaves are staggered and unique, but the decoration materials in the room are not so luxurious. The board veneer is not pure solid wood decoration, and the floor tiles in the room are also cheap tiles, which are not upscale (it should be said that the toiletries are very easy to use). In summary!

msg:The long-planned honeymoon trip to Sanya finally came true this June. I heard that the water quality of Yalong Bay is good, so I chose the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay. I didn't stay for long, two days. I had only heard of it before coming to the Ritz-Carlton, but the feeling after checking in was still very good.
I arrived at the hotel at around 2 pm and received a coconut shell welcome necklace. When I checked in at the beginning, I asked for a room on a high floor with a sea view and no obstruction. The front desk said that it was fully booked and there was no suitable room. After the communication failed, I was ready to give up. I didn't expect that the housekeeper Licia had been coordinating and took us to see several rooms. Finally, she finally coordinated a room with a slightly remote location but a wide sea view. During the two days of staying, she always reminded and cared about us attentively, and helped us coordinate many things, so I am particularly grateful to her.
‚òÜ We lived in the Litian Pavilion on the 5th floor, and the view was really great.
‚òÜ With a try-and-see attitude, I asked the housekeeper if there was a little lion. The housekeeper said that it was a gift from the previous quarter and it was no longer available. Finally, he sent us a little lion puzzle and hand-painted.
‚òÜ When you return to the room at night, you will receive a thoughtful room card, reminding you of the sunrise and sunset time and weather, as well as two exquisite conch shells.
‚òÜMany people on the Internet say that the facilities are old, but I think it is much better than I expected. It can be seen that the decoration style and furniture are old, but the maintenance and hygiene are OK.
‚òÜThe hotel staff are also very friendly and will take the initiative to say hello. There are many service guys at the swimming pool and beach, who will take the initiative to deliver water and bath towels. The beach scenery of Ritz is very good and the water quality is good.
‚òÜThe day before check-out, the housekeeper sent souvenirs and fruit plates to the room. The exquisite little black bag contains two lion head key chains and two USB small fans.
So overall, Ritz still meets my expectations, even slightly exceeds
Okay, I should choose Ritz again when I come to Sanya next time

msg:This trip ended with Ritz-Carlton. The hotel housekeeper Judi contacted me one day in advance and arranged a full sea view room on the top floor. Because the Sheraton check-in experience was really bad, I wanted to check in at Ritz in advance. After arriving at Ritz, I felt relieved. As soon as I entered the hotel, the receptionist put on a welcome necklace for us. After leading us to the front desk to complete the check-in procedures, we were sent to the room and introduced the hotel facilities and activities along the way. After entering the room, the sea view in front of us was refreshing, and the internal facilities of the room were relatively new. The day of check-in was Children's Day on June 1st. The hotel prepared a lot of activities for children, and the baby was also very happy to participate. On the last day of departure, Sanya gave the blue sea and blue sky very powerfully, made the most beautiful dress for Ritz, and gave us a good mood. Before leaving, the housekeeper Judi gave the baby a souvenir. The baby said that he wanted to come to Ritz next timeüòÑ

I felt like I could drink three glasses of iced American coffee and a bunch of juices a day. The service was very good and basically met all my requests. The chocolate in the evening was delicious and paired with white grape sparkling wine!

The breakfast is worth it. Children can choose noodles or bread. The juice is freshly squeezed and very healthy. And you can eat until 11:00. If you sleep in, you can even save lunch. If you encounter any problems, you can contact the housekeeper Xiaolin to help you solve them. In short, you get what you pay for. And the off-season travel is very cost-effective. You can order all kinds of takeout without leaving the hotel. You can see that the staff changes the water and cleans the water in the swimming pool every dayüßπ It is also very reassuring to bring children. The child received a cake and a handwritten greeting card from the staff on his birthday. It was very sincere. I brought them all backüòä

msg:I took my mother on a trip for her 60th birthday. It was really great to stay at the Ritz-Carlton on her birthday! From the moment I checked in, I was comfortable throughout the whole process. There was a shell welcome necklace at the door. Iris Li, as the housekeeper, immediately contacted our restaurant reservation and delivered it to the room. She introduced the room facilities and various activities in detail. On the birthday, whether it was the spa, Runyuan Restaurant or the guest room, they all prepared small surprises, which touched my old mother.
In addition to birthdays, there are many activities here. Unlike other hotels where the public areas are deserted or even unpopular at night, there are many activities here. There are different activities for adults and children every day! ! ! The whole hotel is full of popularity and vitality! Paddleboards are really fun! There are also environmental protection games on the beach, which are estimated to pick up bottles. The a**osphere of the lawn BBQ is really great. The two live singers are of very high standards and sing jazz very well! The other songs are also first-class taste. I can actually sing four or five songs in a row in my favorite song list! ! ! 
The beach bar on the beach actually has a one-cent daze coupon. The special drinks and corn chips are so delicious. The various consumption coupons for the 16th anniversary are very cost-effective! Various levels of sunscreen are available at the beach and the pool, and there is even tanning oil hahaha~ Every day here is suitable for pure daze without going out, blowing the wind, listening to the waves, and feeling all the beauty~

He really responded to requests, was enthusiastic and practical, and made customers feel at ease when they were away from home, and felt like going home. The Ritz-Carlton service is always five stars, the breakfast is good, and the dinner is delicious. It is worth experiencing Sanya if the budget is OK.

Hygiene: There are no dead corners in hygiene, and it is indeed cleaned very thoroughly.
Environment: The room is large enough, and it does have a panoramic sea view. The double washbasin is very good, and the bathtub is also very large.

Service: The focus is on service. We came to the lobby from the basement, and a special lady took us to the executive lounge to check in. Alice provided high-standard service throughout the whole process, and the communication and response were also very timely. I tried all five meals. The service staff in the executive lounge were very professional, actively serving dishes and changing plates. They responded to special needs. It's a pity that I'm embarrassed to see the name tags of the sisters. I don't know your names and can't praise them one by one. After checking out, I also had Chinese food in the lounge, and the sister gave me souvenirs before leaving. The service can prove that it is worthy of being Li Zi. I would like to mention the Platinum follow-up shooting again. The photographer sister is really professional, and the film is very good. It is impossible not to add it. I can't bear to give up the film. In short, Chestnut is still a little far from my expectations. After all, at more than 3,000 yuan a night, my expectations are a bit high. The swimming pool, beach, meals in the executive lounge, proactive turndown service, drying of swimsuits and other services are all impressive. I still give Chestnut full marks. The big ones are not delivered, and I bought a big one in the boutique and sent it home by express delivery.

msg:This time I came to Sanya for vacation, with the elderly and a 2-and-a-half-year-old baby. I had been to the scenic spots several times before, so I chose to stay in a hotel directly this time. I did a lot of hotel guides in the early stage, and finally chose Ritz-Carlton. After five days of experience, I really made the right choice! The elderly and the baby were very satisfied and said they would come here next time! 
I would like to thank the housekeeper Xiao Xu here for his warm service and timely response. Because he was with the elderly and children, Xiao Xu also helped to call a car to send him to the airport, which must be praised! 
The housekeeper Xiao Xu added WeChat to confirm the flight number and special needs one day in advance. Because I needed more water with the baby, I didn‚Äôt expect to take a whole box and put it in the room. Every staff member I met at Ritz was very nice. I took the initiative to say hello, took the luggage, and met the staff who cleaned the room. I casually said that it was inconvenient to have no paper towels in the bedroom. When I returned to the room again, I immediately had several more boxes of paper towels. 
Welcome fruit is also available every day, which can‚Äôt be eaten at all. The breakfast in the seaside restaurant is also delicious. It is semi-self-service mode, and you can also order it a la carte. Lobster pancakes and small hamburgers are delicious. I also ate the legendary hot and sour beef noodles, which is really delicious! A bowl is a must every day
The baby also likes the swimming pool in the room very much. He goes there every day. The baby looks forward to swimming the most when he wakes up. The small slide in the children's pool is also very suitable for babies. The disadvantage is that the slide is outside the swimming pool, and the road is a bit rough
There is a small fenced sand area next to the beach, which is also very suitable for babies. There are shade trees and the sea breeze is quite cool
This time I brought my baby with me. I was afraid of affecting others and being affected, so I chose Liyuanju Villa. It turned out that the choice was right. The privacy is very good, the room is large, and the facilities are not as old as imagined. There are some marks on the floor by the swimming pool, but the interior is still very good, transparent and bright, and you can ask the butler to open a golf course wherever you go. The car pick-up and drop-off service is available, and you don‚Äôt have to go to the lobby to pick up takeout. The butler will deliver it directly to the room. It‚Äôs so convenient. By the way, I wanted to get the 5 free photos of the Platinum Travel Photography, but the photos of my baby were so beautiful that I couldn‚Äôt help but spend a huge amount of money. But it‚Äôs worth it. If there is a disadvantage, the beach in Yalong Bay is not as good as it was a few years ago. There is a very steep place from the hotel to the beach, which is a bit inconvenient for the elderly and children. The indoor children‚Äôs playground is a bit too simple, and the baby is not very interested. I hope the hotel can consider renovating it. However, this little disadvantage does not affect my love for Ritz. This trip ‚úàÔ∏è is simply perfect. Thank you Ritz and the butler Xiao Xu

In addition, because the guests in the next room checked in late and it was noisy, we had contact with the duty manager. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know her name. She really stood from the perspective of our guests and tried her best to help us solve the problem. Knowing that we didn‚Äôt sleep well, she waited for us at the check-out time the next day, prepared souvenirs for us, and arranged a car to take us to the next hotel. To be honest, the reason why Ritz has a group of loyal customers is the hotel‚Äôs hospitality concept and such attentive employees.

Do you really have a conscience with the yyds online? How dare a hotel like this raise the price to more than 4,000 a night ...It is said to be the best in Yalong Bay, I really can‚Äôt compliment it... It‚Äôs full of vulgarity as soon as you come in. A drink is 68, which is not as good as iced black tea for a few yuan. Don‚Äôt eat it in the hotel, it tastes terrible... The service is okay, the rest is really not worth it...

msg:A very perfect hotel trip. It was my first time in Yalong Bay. I chose Ritz-Carlton after a long search. It was perfect in every aspect. There were also a lot of activities for children. The service was also very good during the May Day holiday. Especially the housekeeper Li Li, a cute and lively girl, warm and thoughtful. She helped us think of many things we didn't expect. The arrangement was great! Even the picky family members praised it~ I will go again next time!

You can swim during the day and there is always a shaded place. Also, the breakfast here is great, which may be just what I like. The housekeeper Iris is very considerate and responsive. Thank you.

I didn't leave the hotel for two days. I ate at Run Chinese Restaurant, Italian Restaurant and buffet dinner. The food was great!
It's a place you want to come again after visiting once!
Very suitable for bringing children!

msg:I stay in hotels on business trips all year round and rarely write reviews. This time I must give a negative review. I arrived at the store around 6 pm on April 30, which was not the peak check-in period. After being guided to the front desk, there were two staff members responsible for checking in. One of the group of guests were foreigners. The check-in process was complicated. After waiting for about seven or eight minutes, I asked How long will it take? The staff told me without expression that it was slow to upload the identity information of foreign customers (no response to the waiting time). After that, the number of customers in the queue gradually increased. Some people complained why there were only two reception staff, so one job was added to queue me up. The people behind me quickly stepped forward to jump in line (the staff ignored them), and then another staff member was added. Finally it was my turn to check in. During check-in, I informed that there were two children who needed two sets of children's toiletries, slippers, pajamas, etc. The staff said that arrangements had been made, and then the housekeeper sent me to the room. He had almost no facial expression except pushing my luggage. After entering the room, I asked if I needed to add a child's bed. Enclosed (twin room), and asked me to confirm whether it was blocked on one side or both sides. I confirmed that it needed to be blocked on both sides. As a result, the children's supplies were not delivered to the room after two hours, and they were delivered after a phone call to urge them. But there is only one side of the fence... As the children and their mother's flight was delayed (we departed from different cities), it was already 11 o'clock when we arrived at the store. After the children packed up and played and went to bed, I found that it was indeed easier for the two children to fall off the bed, so I called for service The center added a barrier and told me that it would be delivered in about 10 minutes later, but there was no response for 20 minutes. I called again to confirm when it would be delivered and was told that it should be soon. After another 10 minutes, I really had no patience and called again to inquire and was informed. Delivered immediately, delivered in a minute. What's even more weird is that a loud broadcast suddenly appeared in the middle of the night: There is a fire in this building, please pay attention to safety, I will kill you. The alarm came again in the morning, and again at 11 o'clock the next night. I was really numb. Because I booked a room on the first floor with direct access to the swimming pool and I have a good psychological quality, but don‚Äôt play with me by always reporting false alarms! Let‚Äôs talk about the toiletries again. For a room that costs more than 4,000 yuan per night, the toiletries are worse than those in a business hotel that costs 500 yuan. The toothbrush is really unbeatable, and the bathroom products are also in large bottles. I have stayed in many hotels in Sanya. The Ritz is a luxury hotel famous for its service. Are you proud of your good business? The service is lackluster, the message connection is confusing, the system is faulty, the facilities and equipment are insufficiently maintained, and the toiletries are cheap. I have been blocked from now on.

msg:I stayed in two hotels in Sanya this time, one is Crown Yanlord and the other is Ritz-Carlton. The styles of the two hotels are obviously different. The former is for families with children, while the latter has more international friends. The hotel has a check-in time of 3 o'clock, but there was a delay on the day. The children were restless and did not get enough rest. The hotel quickly arranged for a specialist, Iris, to contact us, coordinate the relevant children's equipment, and also gave us a little lion. The ecology and sea view of the hotel are very beautiful. I also fell in love with Diptyque shampoo. The children liked the sand digging area under the big tree on the beach very much. They said the sand was not hot. I will come again next time.

msg:A palace in the rainforest. The corridor on the 3rd floor is very distinctive. It is said that the hotel designer was influenced by the corridor of the Summer Palace. The room is large and quiet, the lighting is very warm, and it has a sense of seclusion. I was not used to this quietness when I first checked in, but I enjoyed it after a while. You can see the sea from the window. Strolling along the hotel in the morning and evening, the scenery is everywhere, beautiful and intoxicating. There is also a band performance in the seaside restaurant at night, the singing is melodious and gentle; the sea is a hundred meters away, the sound of waves echoes, and there is an a**osphere of harmony between man and nature. The swimming pool in front of the building is very distinctive, winding and tortuous, and it feels like walking in the garden. I stayed for two days, and the aftertaste is still not exhausted. I will experience it in detail next time I stay.

The service is really amazing. From check-in to check-out, every staff member I met was very polite and dedicated. The staff in the special executive lounge was great. They learned that we had a flight at night, so they reserved a rest room after check-out and let us continue to enjoy dinner in the lounge.
Although the facilities are a bit old, they are well maintained and cleaned. I think the food in the executive lounge is the best in Sanya, and it is perfect for a drunkard like me.
Next time I come to Sanya, I will definitely come to Ritz-Carlton again and stay a few more days.

The staff put shell necklaces on us as soon as we got off the car. We took our luggage off the car. It was very private garden-like, with a view at every step. Combined with the local tropical style, it was more upscale! The most important thing is the hotel's butler. The service is super good. It can be said that he is responsive and gave us a lot of surprises. When we checked in and left, we wanted to take Butler Lin home! 
Facilities: 4 large swimming pools, beaches, etc. 
Hygiene: Very clean, often cleaned, and replaced items 
Environment: Beautiful tropical style 
Service: Very thoughtful and enthusiastic 
And the hotel's breakfast beef soup is great! I ate six bowls in three days. Everyone must experience the Ritz-Carlton Hotel! !

msg:The five-day, four-night trip to Sanya ended successfully. When I first chose the hotel, I did a lot of research. I stayed in Mangrove, MGM and Pullman several times before. This time, because I brought the elderly and a three-year-old socially anxious baby, I deliberately avoided some noisy parent-child hotels and chose the old luxury Li Zi üå∞. Facts have proved that Li Zi's service and environment did not disappoint me. In terms of environment, we booked the Lijingxuan Family Suite. Compared with the old facilities of other hotels in Yalong Bay, the decoration and layout of the room are all high-end. There are no babies in groups, and the holiday a**osphere is stronger. There are not many varieties of breakfast, but the baby eats happily every day. The service is even better. Because the plane was delayed, the housekeeper Xiaolin waited until late to greet us in the lobby, enthusiastically presented a welcome necklace, and took us to the room all the way. Welcome fruits, baby fences and dehumidifiers that were reserved in advance were also prepared in the room. Because it was too late, I asked the housekeeper to help add a bed the next day, but Xiaolin quickly arranged an extra bed to make our stay more comfortable. In addition, there were cordial greetings and positive responses every day for the next few days. Before leaving the hotel, although it was a holiday, my colleague Zoya still arranged for the little lion to be given to the child. In short, Xiaolin's enthusiastic service directly raised the hotel experience to a higher level. Thank you again!

After arriving at the hotel that day, the housekeeper Judi added WeChat and has been serving us patiently and enthusiastically.

I asked some questions the next day when I was on vacation and they answered me patiently. The service at the Ritz was really nothing to say. Sister Gao from the Chinese restaurant made my daughter happy. The service was very kind and she gave me a small balloon. The little dolphin brother (uncle) on the beach is also very good. He caught crabs for my daughter. In short, I deeply experienced the top service of Ritz this time. These comments are all from the heart. Thank you for giving my daughter a happy birthday weekend. .

msg:The Ritz-Carlton Club fullfilled my family vacation! I was so lucky to choose it! 

I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I checked in. The executive trea**ent of Ritz-Carlton surprised me! I booked a sea view room at Huahai Pavilion. As soon as I got off the car, the front desk sent a welcome gift, and the concierge took my luggage and delivered it to the room. Because it was not time to check in, the executive lounge specially prepared afternoon tea and drinks for us to rest first. The staff of the executive lounge led the way and introduced the services and facilities of the hotel to us. The butler Jay provided meticulous service. He basically responded to all requests on WeChat and reminded the dinner time of the executive lounge in case the guests forgot dinner. When I went to the next stop, I forgot to clean the cloakroom and left my clothes in the hotel. The butler also arranged to mail them to my home. The service was perfect.
The sea view room is very good, the balcony faces Yalong Bay, and the breeze is blowing.
The breakfast, lunch and lunch are different every day, and the taste is good. Unlimited drinks are available during the afternoon tea period to cultivate cocktail bartending experts.
The afternoon tea desserts and evening chocolate desserts provided by the hotel are very palatable.
After comparing Rosewood, Edition, St. Regis, and Park Hyatt, I finally chose Ritz.

I was a little worried about the oldness, but it was unnecessary. Old brands can also come up with new tricks. The former top brand of Yalong Bay is still the best. The law of the jungle does not necessarily rely on new, trendy, and internet celebrity marketing.

The beef noodles that everyone recommends are also delicious. The quality of the beef is very good, fragrant but not smelly, but I love bread more. The bread in the hotel is very good. I have a special bread brain. like.
A better experience came from the housekeeper Iris. She is a kind-hearted, considerate and considerate angel housekeeper. She helped me a lot. From the beginning, she helped me reserve the wheelchair for my mother to use, and helped me make reservations for travel photography and all kinds of life details. It was super nice, which made our trip to the hotel perfect. The other service staff were super good and answered all questions. They were friendly and proactive. The guy at the storage desk at the door asked them to store the wheelchair every time he came in and out. He was not impatient at all. .
The hotel's Bojue travel photography is also good. From the service attitude to the shooting technology and photo retouching, it is a bit higher than the previous hotel, although the price is a little expensive. But I felt it was worth the money and couldn‚Äôt help but choose a few more.
I was really in a good mood when I left the hotel, and I look forward to staying at the Ritz again in the future. Good service will make people want to come back.

We asked the front desk clerk if there was a suite suitable for three people. We wanted to live together. The clerk recommended a two-bedroom beach villa for 8002. I asked the front desk about the price, and the front desk replied that it was 5600 per night. I didn't tell the Ctrip about the hotel before check-in. I thought it would cost more than 5000 to open two large beds, so I checked in. When I got to the room, I asked the housekeeper on WeChat whether it was more than 5000 for one room or one building. The housekeeper clearly told me that it was one building. When I checked out, I was deducted more than 8600 per night, which made me confused. I was in a hurry to catch the plane, and I suffered a dumb loss. I felt that I was routinely tricked! My friend's company holds an annual meeting in this hotel every year. I told him about this. It was originally recommended by him. He decided to change the hotel this year. Remind everyone to ask clearly when checking in! Moreover, the sanitation of the room is also poor, the refrigerator in the tea room stinks, the floor tiles are warped, and the doors are shaky. It is a bit like the decoration of my rural hometown. Apart from being by the sea, I personally think the room is worth 388 per night!

Niki Lily's service is warm and thoughtful, just like Doraemon. If there is any need, she will respond in time. Every morning, she will take the initiative to ask if you need to add supplies and water, making the whole stay experience very comfortable. 2. The lifeguard uncle who guides the "Little Islander Experience" at the entrance of the beach is so enthusiastic and cute. He takes the children to play coconut bowling and learn Hainanese. The children still remember it after returning home. 3. The hotel's service is very thoughtful. There are hot towels and ice water provided at the swimming pool and beach. The parent-child details are also well done. The children's bathrobes are also subdivided by age, which is very thoughtful. 4. The lifeguards in the children's pool are very responsible. When a child slid down the children's slide, he lost his balance and choked on water. The lifeguard jumped into the water very quickly to help the child up and comfort him. He was faster than the parents. As a passerby, I was very moved. If you want to have fun with your kids in Sanya, you can't go wrong with the Ritz-Carlton, Sanya!

One day, our baby was not feeling well and kept making trouble. He refused to eat dinner when he went out. It was almost eight o'clock when he came back. I contacted Alice to leave a bowl of noodles for the baby. The lounge did not provide noodles that night. Alice contacted the restaurant downstairs to make a bowl of noodles for the baby and sent it to the room. She was worried that we did not eat and left a lot of dishes for us. The service at the Ritz-Carlton is really amazing. Even my baby said that he didn't want to leave the Ritz-Carlton room and wanted to stay there forever. The Yalong Bay Ritz is really a lifetime recommendation. The environment and service are really amazing. I will recommend it to my friends and will stay here again in the future.

msg:My friend and I decided to come to Sanya to bring our kids to play in the water and dig sand. After some research, we finally chose Ritz-Carlton among several parent-child hotels. As soon as we arrived at the hotel, we were warmly presented with a welcome necklace. The Ritz lion shape made of coconut shells was very popular with the kids. Check-in was also very smooth. The room we were given was very close to the beach. However, it was relatively far from breakfast and the Chinese restaurant. Sophia, the room service, was very nice. She would promptly inquire whether we needed to purchase consumables for the room. She also quickly helped to make reservations for some activities that needed to be booked. She also tried her best to help realize some of the requests we put forward. Great praise! There are also a lot of children's activities in the hotel. The most popular one should be feeding small animals. It is open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The time is short, only half an hour, but it is enough because it is really hot. The children enjoy it very much, and the adults just want to go back to the room to enjoy the air conditioning. I feel that Ritz really loves children. The staff I met during this trip were very tolerant and praised the children. The swimming pool, the children's playground, and the restaurant gave the children various small surprises. The children had a lot of fun. The food in Runyuan Restaurant is delicious, unlike the Chinese restaurant in some hotels that tastes unpalatable. The breakfast variety is also very rich, and the soup noodles are dazzling three bowls at a time! Of course, the service of the old hotel is very good and considerate, but the facilities in the room are relatively old, but overall they are still very good. If I come to Sanya next time, I should continue to choose Ritz.

The room was well cleaned, and the cleaning lady was also very nice and smiling. She delivered things very quickly and was very thoughtful. If we asked for a few more bottles of water, she would put a box for us directly!
There was a lifeguard named Jack on the beach who provided great service. When a child next to him cried, he went to comfort him patiently and caught a small crab for the child himself. Such staff members are too good to be true.
The restaurant only had breakfast and cocktail sets, and there was really not much to eat except beef noodles. The speed of collecting plates was also very slow, which could only be said to be average. There was also no children's playground in the restaurant to play in, so it was recommended to cancel it.

msg:I don't know where so many good reviews come from. If you don't experience it, you won't know. It turns out that the 3,000 yuan a night deluxe full sea view room is like this:

I stayed on the 5th floor on the first day, and I was not given the deluxe full sea view room I booked, so that's fine.
1) There was a bad smell as soon as I entered the room. I asked to change rooms but was not given a change and was suffocated all night.
2) The power ***** at the head of the bed had poor contact and could not be charged. When I took it out, the whole shell fell out and various wires were exposed.
3) There was hair on the white wash basin from the previous guest. The next day, I changed to the full sea view room I originally booked and there was still hair.
4) The door lock was obviously broken by prying and almost stabbed my hand. The safe was broken.
5) The front desk did not give children's products even though I checked in with my child. I called the service phone for a long time but no one answered. It took a long time to deliver the children's toothbrush.
6) When I went downstairs for breakfast, I asked the waiter to give you directions, but it was limited to directions. Even if she was standing at the elevator entrance and the elevator door was open, she would not help you press the elevator, and she didn't even say a happy meal.

I moved to the 7th floor the next day.
1) As soon as I entered the room, there was still hair from the previous guest in the wash basin. 2) I saw mice running around the balcony at night.
3) The toilet was slow to fill and the water volume was small. I had to wait for several times to flush it clean.
4) The room was noisy at night, not sure if it was the air conditioner or something else.
5) The park scenery was old and desolate, and the swimming pool was small and small.
6) After the experience, the above summary refreshed my understanding of the luxury hotel brand Ritz-Carlton. Welcome everyone to join!

msg:As an old five-star hotel, Ritz has always been one of our must-see hotels. This year, we were a little disappointed. The service has declined greatly. First of all, when checking in, we used flower pots to make a long corridor for guests to line up. We arrived at the hotel at more than two o'clock, but it took more than 50 minutes to check in. My legs were numb from standing. I was traveling with the elderly and children. I didn't feel tired when I took the first-class flight, but I was exhausted when I arrived at Ritz. The key is that there were not so many guests, but it took a long time. There were no seats, so I had to stand there as a punishment. I was drunk. Let's talk about all the service staff with a kind of fatigue and negativity, which is very different from the previous active and proactive. There must be a problem with management. I hope the hotel executives can find the reason. This will become a vicious cycle. The highlight of the service is the service guys in the heated swimming pool. They are enthusiastic and proactive with youthful vitality. The service is better than in previous years, which is very surprising.

Special praise should be given to the housekeeper Effie, the cleaning lady and the lifeguard. The internal environment of the hotel is very good, with a gym, spa, indoor and outdoor children's playground, and animal farm. The swimming pool has water slides, children's play area, and constant temperature swimming pool. The infinity pool is beautiful for taking pictures. The overall environment is very good, and there are different activities every day. , both adults and children can play and relax. You can see the sunrise and sunset on the beach, and you can also see the beautiful morning glow and fire clouds when there are many clouds. Generally speaking, it is very suitable for a family or three or four friends to stay together. I have made an appoin**ent with my friend to stay here again when I come to Sanya next year, and I also asked for the housekeeper Effie.

Strollers can be pushed to most areas of the hotel, including the indoor amusement park and the animal farm. There are several sand pits in the hotel where you can dig sand. You can borrow sand digging tools for free. The staff at the beach and poolside will actively provide mineral water. and bath towels. Watch a movie on the beach in the evening and get free popcorn üòÇ

The housekeeper Huang Yu added WeChat communication needs in advance and prepared extra small toilets, small slippers, sterilized milk pots, etc. according to the children's ages. They asked about the itinerary every day. The night before leaving, they even sent a little lion doll to the room, which was very considerate.

msg:I hesitated for a long time before coming here. After all, the hotels in Yalong Bay are very old, but in the end I decided to stay at the Ritz for two nights. Fortunately, we met the housekeeper Olivia who upgraded us to a suite for free. The room is large enough and has a good view, so it's fun to play hide-and-seek with children in the room.
I ate hot and sour beef noodles for breakfast for two days. It is so popular for a reason. The beef has no fishy smell at all.
Every staff member we met at the hotel was friendly, and there were many children's programs. However, we were sick and couldn't play it this time, which was a pity.
Compared with the stronger design style and modern elements of the new hotel, the old money style still feels more stable and majestic.

msg:Facilities: It is quite complete, with automatic curtains, TV and refrigerator, not to mention, especially baby bathrobes, slippers and toiletries. It is very convenient to take care of children, and there is a baby playpen.

Hygiene: The room is very clean, there are no ants or the like, and there are no dead spots in hygiene. When the guest room is tidied up, they will help to put the scattered items neatly. The child played with sand and brought it to the bed the first day, and there was no time to change it when he went to bed at night. The sheets and quilts were changed for us the next day.

Environment: The hotel is very big, with a large lawn. It is very nice to take pictures. Many people took pictures below. We took the children and did not bother to take pictures. We will definitely take more pictures next time. The room is large and has a walk-in wardrobe. The sea view of Huahai Pavilion is very good. The field of vision is relatively large and open. The hotel has a private beach. There are free trial bath towels on the beach and free mineral water. If you want, there is a beach chair next to it. You can also order food and have it delivered to your seat. There are parent-child activities arranged every day, but we didn‚Äôt make it. It‚Äôs a bit of a pity. I‚Äôll definitely try it out next time I come back.

Service: Very good, especially the lounge steward Kate, who asked our needs in advance and met all our needs. Considering that we had children with us, it was convenient for us to eat, and specially arranged for us to be on the lounge floor, so we didn‚Äôt have to run. Running up and down. The child was a little unwell the next day, so we asked Kate to help us arrange to cook porridge for the child alone. Later, she cooked noodles for the child alone without us having to say hello, which was very considerate. When we left, she even prepared a special gift for the child, which surprised us. And surprise, the children also like it very much, thank you very much! There was another girl whose name I didn‚Äôt remember, and the service was very good. She led us into the room when we checked in, and she helped us push our luggage when we left. She was special every time she saw us. Enthusiastic and very friendly to children. When we went to eat and there were no seats, he helped us find seats and was very considerate and considerate! The room we booked came with executive benefits and we checked in at the executive lounge. The check-in time was at noon. We ate while waiting for the check-in. It was very comfortable. All the meals for the day were taken care of in the executive lounge, which can be said to save a lot of moneyüòÅ I also ate the spicy and sour beef noodles that everyone recommended. It was very delicious. I had to eat two bowls at a time. Breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner, and supper. 5 meals a day. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt stop eating. üòÇ Free flow of wine, minibar in our room Although it‚Äôs free, I didn‚Äôt drink much. I only went to the bar to drink freshly squeezed juice.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my two days at the Ritz. The executive benefits are great value and the off-season package price is very suitable. If the budget is okay, I really recommend trying it. If we come next time, we will consider staying againüòä

If you have the opportunity, it is worth coming!
Some suggestions: During the peak tourist period, the queue time is a bit long, but the Ritz staff are efficient and will not make guests wait too long. There are also staff who play games with the children, so that the wait will not become too boring. You may consider adding a few more windows in the future.

When checking in at the Ritz-Carlton, the hotel lady gave us a welcome necklace as soon as we got off the bus. We arrived at around 1 p.m., and the room was not cleaned yet. We waited at the front desk for a while, but fortunately we didn‚Äôt wait too long. The kind-hearted housekeeper Iris helped us upgrade to a poolside room. We have traveled a lot and stayed in countless five-star hotels. The service at the Ritz is really good. The room I booked was a hotel package, which included two breakfasts. The guy from the reservation depar**ent confirmed my needs in advance. , I gave my 8-year-old sister a breakfast. There were more than ten bottles of mineral water in the room, and the supply was unlimited. There was no need to ask for it. In fact, a bottle of mineral water doesn't cost much at all, but many hotels can't do this. Other staff in the hotel are also polite, warm and friendly. As soon as you arrive at the beach and poolside, you will be given bath towels and bottled water. There are also sand digging tools on the beach for children to use. My package included free travel photography. The photographer took us for almost an hour to take photos. The photos were good. However, due to time constraints, I did not pay for multiple selections of photos. The staff did not feel unhappy or make a bad face because of this. That's a good point. Miss Iris sends messages from time to time to ask if I need anything, which makes me feel very warm. She also gave the children puzzles and bracelets when checking out. I really enjoyed my stay at the Ritz during this trip. If I have to make some comments, it would be that the breakfast is average. Maybe we have stayed in too many five-star hotels and eaten too many delicious foods. Now we don‚Äôt feel that the breakfast at the Ritz is outstanding. , since in Sanya, they don‚Äôt even provide mangoes among the fruits, and there are no steaks, smoked salmon, cakes and breads that are outstanding and make me want to eat them when I see them. All in all, I hope the breakfast quality can be higher and match the excellent service. In the package, children can feed small animals, beach tents, ropeways, etc., but I didn‚Äôt go to play, so I‚Äôll come back next time!

msg:There is no doubt about the quality of Ritz. First of all, give Huang Yu Butler a manual thumbs up üëç. He called in advance to understand the check-in requirements, prepared the room in advance, upgraded a non-sea view room to the same sea view room, and specially arranged adjacent rooms. The whole process was complete Answer all questions, warmly recommend local food, and the service is greatüòé! I originally thought that it would be too cold to go into the water in Sanya, so I didn‚Äôt bring any beach shoes, but the room was ready. Before we left, we knew we had another trip, and the beach shoes were also included. There is no need to comment on the hotel's facilities. The room type is standard and the welcome fruits are in place. In the morning, when you open the curtains and you can see the sun rising over the sea, it is really pleasant. There is an open-air bar by the beach with resident singers and a great a**osphere. The hotel also comes with Bojue Travel Photography. The weather is good, the camera is good, and the technology is good, and the photos taken are beautiful. Overall highly recommended! The Ritz is just different. Attach a photo you took as a promotional video. The only drawback is that the gym is too far away. Walking to the gym is basically a warm-up, and you have to walk outside, which is inconvenient on rainy days. Also, the pineapple for breakfast was too raw. It is a local fruit and could be replaced with something more ripe.

The overall architectural style and garden creation of the hotel all reflect the grand elegance, and it will be a blockbuster when you take a photo. There is no doubt that the hotels in Yalong Bay have some signs of age and time, but the most important thing is that they are well maintained and the rooms are spacious and transparent; the heated swimming pool The temperature is suitable, the beach is flat, the sand is fine and the sea is blue, and the unique geographical location makes it as beautiful as a picture; the hotel has a rich variety of food, and the bowl of hot and sour beef soup for breakfast has become a reason to see you again next time; soft management points for the hotel Like, the service is attentive and thoughtful. Every staff member is full of energy and smiling, making people feel at home. Especially the housekeeper Xiaolin this time, from before we checked in to after we checked out, he was meticulous and thoughtful throughout, making my family and I feel more comfortable. Next time we come to Yalong Bay, Ritz will probably be our first choice. I hope we have the chance to meet again.

The hotel's architectural design style is grand, with dark red eaves and earthy yellow exterior walls. It has a very rich breakfast. It's nice to take a walk around the hotel every day.
The toiletries used in the hotel are Tiptik's Greek fig scent. It smells good. I like it.

msg:We drove from Lingshui, and I did a lot of homework before coming to Sanya. Because I have children, I want to choose a family hotel that avoids the crowds of children. After looking around, I still think the Ritz is more in line with my intention. It's private, not a complete family hotel but has facilities for children to play. The Ritz is famous for its excellent service, and the multi-experience experience this time is well-deserved.
Parking is very convenient, the luggage staff will help deliver it to the room, and will help pull it to the car when leaving.
After we arrived, the butler Xiaojia took us to the room and introduced us to the hotel. Sometimes we want to ask questions in such a large hotel. It is very convenient to have one-to-one service from the butler, and it is very considerate and thoughtful for us!
During the chat, I found out that classmate Xiaojia is still an intern. The boss really should add chicken legs!
We stayed for two nights and were anxious to catch the high-speed train on the day we checked out, so Xiaojia helped us communicate and make an appoin**ent for lunch at the Growth Center so that the children could eat Ritz meals on the high-speed train. Thank you very much!
The staff at the hotel are very child-friendly, and the door-to-door gifts are unique. The breakfast is very rich, and the waffles are a must-eat! Not too sweet, paired with whipped cream, it‚Äôs the best waffle I‚Äôve ever tasted!

msg:Although you can tell at a glance that it is an older hotel, it does not affect its beauty. I was a little hesitant before coming here, saying that the facilities were too old and the price/performance ratio was average. But service, just like a person's personality, is the inherent quality of a hotel and needs to be experienced to know it.
The Ritz's architecture is grand and unique, and its garden landscape design is also quite outstanding. Everything in your field of vision is painted, and being in it is a beautiful enjoyment.
There are many activities in the hotel, such as paddle board tents, baby crab hunting, etc., which are parent-child friendly.
The service staff, whether at the front desk, guest rooms, swimming pool, or restaurant, are all very friendly and enthusiastic. They also arranged for the caring and lovely guardian angel Iris to always pay attention to our schedule and needs.
We upgraded from Ritz Pavilion to Lijing Pavilion for free. The garden view on the VILLA side is beautiful even if we can't see the sea.
The heated infinity swimming pool by the sea has an unparalleled view and will make you forget to leave.
The sand on the beach is not fine enough, which is considered a fly in the oin**ent.
Hope to come again.

There's nothing to say about the room. I can't fault a hotel room at this price. The balcony is very cool. I can drink some wine and eat fruit in the evening and enjoy the sea breeze.
The breakfast is rich in variety, and dishes are removed in a timely manner. The guardian angel (housekeeper) Zoey is attentive and helps remind many travel series. On the day of check-out, a small gift was specially prepared.
There are many online taxis waiting to take orders in front of the hotel, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about not being able to get a taxi. It is also very close to Baihua Valley and very convenient for eating.

msg:We went to the Huahai Pavilion Executive Lounge to solve the problem of eating for the day and also felt that there were fewer people. After arriving at the hotel, we were given a necklace as a gift and went to the executive lounge on the 6th floor to check in. However, when we arrived, we were informed that breakfast in the executive lounge had been moved to the first floor, which made us not very happy. In fact, the room in the Huahai Pavilion was very far away, and there were so many people there. Although the staff said they could help us take breakfast to the executive building or the room, they felt it was a bit awkward so they were unwilling.
The hotel environment is quite good, the facilities may not be new but they are still usable. I booked two Huahai Pavilion rooms, 3423 and 3426. There is a large heated swimming pool downstairs, which is very convenient, and it is not far from the sea.
The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. We were looking for a children's playground with our two children. We didn't know the way, so a staff member who passed by took us there personally. However, there is really nothing interesting in the children's park. It seems that children over four years old are not interested. They are all small toys. Then there is a constant-temperature children's swimming pool at the entrance of the children's park, which is very shallow. Later, we took our two kids to the heated swimming pool at the beach and they had a lot of fun. Large scarves are provided by the pool, which is very convenient.
The hotel was hosting a wedding, and there was probably a rehearsal late at night. The music was very loud until about ten o'clock, and my two children under the age of three could not sleep. I felt affected.
The beach on the beach is a bit sloped, and the sand is suitable for children to dig in. There are not many people, but there are people on the beach who always want to take pictures for you. They cost 10 yuan each. The photos are not good, so don‚Äôt be fooled. Someone also asked me if I would go catch small crabs at night. He suddenly came over and stood in front of my daughter. My daughter was so frightened that she cried and asked to go back to the room.
Back to the executive lounge, there were a lot of people, and the chocolate that night was so sweet that I panicked. The buffet had relatively few items, but it was still enough to fill me up. But there were too many people, so I wasn‚Äôt happy to renew my reservation, so I stayed for two nights and went to the Mandarin Oriental. However, the hotel sent a seven-seater business car to pick us up. Normally, we would have to call a car to go to other hotels. I asked the housekeeper, and the housekeeper still found a car to take us to another hotel for free. Thank you very much.

The medium-rare lamb chop at Sofia Italian Restaurant is the best texture and taste I have ever tasted, and the mushroom soup is also fragrant enough!

The coaches in the hotel gym are also very professional and always monitor the personal safety of every training client!
Every time after the guest room is cleaned, there will be some subtle changes in the room that make it feel warm. To be honest, I am still reluctant to leave this day!
The hotel also has many entertainment projects. The only drawback is that I am relatively strong and can‚Äôt even wear a bathrobe, but luckily it doesn‚Äôt matter whether I wear it or not! üòÇ

This time I specially ordered afternoon tea at the Ritz because a photographer came to take pictures. The supervisor at the afternoon tea place also specially provided drinks, which was a very considerate service.

Maggie, the lady who received and provided services throughout the entire stay, was really kind and kind-hearted. She contacted me the day before I checked in and made an appoin**ent for my check-in time and some special needs. When we checked in that day, the car had just parked at the entrance of the lobby, and Miss Maggie was already waiting to greet us. After checking in, he took me to the room and gave me a very comprehensive and detailed introduction. During my stay, I sent her a message whenever I had any questions. The lady was serious and enthusiastic, and she would help and answer every minute. I like this young lady so much. I look forward to meeting her next time I check in. ‚ù§Ô∏è

msg:I brought my children here to play and stayed in the hotel all day and had a great time.
The day before I checked in, the hotel housekeeper Fiona contacted me and asked about my itinerary and room requirements. She was really considerate.
The next day when we arrived at the hotel, from the moment we got off the bus, there was a concierge who helped open the door and pick up our luggage. They were very welcoming. When I walked to the front desk, the lady gave me a welcome necklace from Ritz. It was a very Sanya-style coconut shell necklace. Coco at the front desk was very professional during check-in and quickly helped us arrange the room. Thank you. The arranged room is very spacious and clean, and the balcony is convenient for washing and drying clothes.
Fiona, the housekeeper, sent us from the front desk to our room and introduced us to the hotel's facilities and restaurant opening hours. She also helped me arrange bed surrounds, toiletries, and small toilets for me at night. She also contacted me at any time during our stay to care. I really want to thank Fiona for my great stay. When I checked out, I received a small Ritz gift from Fiona. It was really a surprise.
The customer service staff are also great. They are extremely attentive. They clean up every time. They help me coil the messy data cables into a circle every time. Every corner of the room is cleaned. All the things that need to be changed are replaced with new ones, and the conches are delivered every day when turning down the bed. I really love it. (PS, the child‚Äôs bedside can be replaced with a new one, hahaha, the one used this time is a bit awkward)
The swimming pool and beach are also very clean, and the staff will proactively come forward to ask my needs and provide help.
There are many kinds of breakfast, and the children's playground is also rich in activities.
I stayed in several hotels during this trip to Sanya, and the Ritz is my favorite. Thank you to the housekeeper Fiona, the front desk Coco, and the room staff who helped me clean...Thank you to everyone who helped me. See you next year.

msg:The highlight is the warm service; there are big lawns everywhere, which is very luxurious, I like it very much; the big lawn and other places are very grand for taking pictures (but you need to find someone who can take pictures); the breakfast is very good; it is recommended to book a sea view room with a balcony. It will be very comfortable to watch the sea view, eat, etc. on the balcony. The entire hotel is surrounded by blue sky, white clouds, green space, beach, glass sea, and coconut trees. The view is wide and everyone is very comfortable. I don‚Äôt know why, but fireworks were set off at night (I don‚Äôt know if they were set off by the Ritz or the hotel next door). I was very happy and shocked to watch them from the balcony.
Location: The hotel is in a very good location. The hotel occupies a large area. If you want to stay in a villa, you have to walk to the hotel and call a battery car. The corresponding beach area is also very large. You can swim in the sea, there is a shark prevention net, and there are many ghosts swimming in the sea.
Service: It feels pretty good and has maintained its due level. Xiao Lin in the lobby was my housekeeper, and he followed me very well. He also helped me book a taxi to go to duty-free, late check-out, etc.
Environment: When I looked at it, it felt average at first, but I didn‚Äôt expect that the photos I took were really impressive. It is recommended to take pictures at 9 o'clock in the morning when the sun is good. There are several check-in spots, including the big lawn in the middle, the big lawn by the sea, and the seaside. The swimming pool is also good, but you need to be able to take pictures. By the way, the hotel allows you to make reservations to play paddle board, so I took a photo of the episode like an internet celebrity.
Facilities: The hotel is well maintained, really grand, and has complete facilities, but I didn‚Äôt have enough time to experience them all. There is a small zoo, but not big, just some chickens, ducks, geese + peacocks.

Points to complain about: First, there are too few swimming pools and the design of the swimming pools is average; second, if there is a wedding at night, it will be very noisy, but it seems that the time will be controlled until 9 p.m.; third, the bathtub does not face the balcony , you can't just take a bath and look at the sea view (the hotel next to it is fine); fourth, you have to charge for the drinks and other things in the refrigerator in the room, which is too stingy. Fifth, the check-in time should be accelerated, and there is often a queue. Sixth, the decoration style. After all, the hotel is a bit old and old (but that doesn't mean the facilities are dilapidated).

This time there is no longer a separate executive breakfast, you need to go to the breakfast room, which is a bit messy and quiet due to the crowd. Hope executive breakfast can be reinstated.
The drawers in the wardrobe cannot slide open and stick. There are some similar details that need to be carefully inspected and repaired.

msg:Before coming to Sanya this time, I read Ctrip reviews and finally chose the Ritz Hotel in Yalong Bay. Fiona from the hotel and guest relations depar**ent contacted me one day in advance. After roughly understanding my needs, my check-in went very smoothly and the room layout was very warm. Fiona responded promptly to all my requests during my stay and tried to resolve them, which further enhanced my appreciation for the hotel's service. Walking around the hotel, I found that the swimming pool is directly connected to the guest rooms, but whether there are guests swimming or not, there will be lifeguards sitting at designated positions, which is very reassuring. There is an excavator on the beach that has been digging out rocks. At first, I thought it was very inconvenient to go around it if I wanted to swim in the sea or walk on the beach. Later, I heard from the relevant personnel that the hotel had to avoid the rocks under the beach from knocking guests. For this reason, patient explanations and sincere expressions will make people feel happy even if they are lying on a beach chair and enjoying the sea breeze and waves. I participated in the hotel‚Äôs singing bowl experience, fishing, and crab catching, and it was a great experience. The guest room is indeed a bit old, but the overall feeling is still tidy. The bed and bedding are very comfortable. Their shampoo set is very friendly to me, a couch potato. Although there were some minor flaws in the room, Fiona actively responded and dealt with them after they were reported to Fiona. She hopes that the hotel will provide guests with a better and better experience.

Before arriving at the hotel, I was really worried about the negative comments in some reviews about the outdated facilities and the smell of the rooms. After arriving, I found that the facilities were not as old as expected, and the room felt like a normal hotel smell, which disappeared when I opened the window. In addition to the legendary delicious hot and sour beef noodles, the most impressive thing is the hotel service. Every waiter will smile and say hello.

There is also the Ritz Children's Center, which is great. The breakfast chef will ask what we need to prepare for the children. We ask the chef to steam eggs or boil vegetables to add to the porridge every day. For lunch, just leave the hotel and turn right 800 meters away. The small food court can solve the problem, or you can eat the Chinese food in the hotel. I personally don't like the Chinese restaurant in the hotel.

I think it is a bit old-money style. It is very beautiful. It is worth mentioning the breakfast and beef river. The breakfast is really the best in the hotel. I show off two bowls every day. The steak bar by the swimming pool is also great. There are resident singers in the evening. You can listen to the songs and drink wine while blowing the sea breeze. This is the meaning of vacation. The butler Xiaolin is very enthusiastic , the service is very good, thumbs up. In short, I will come again in the future

Although it is an old hotel, it is well maintained and has a Chinese style with a unique flavor! The service quality is still very high. Our housekeeper Nancy greets us every day and helps to book restaurants. The hotel's children's activities are also very rich. It is a very comfortable stay! The happiest thing is that Ctrip Black Diamond upgrades from Lihai to Lichi for free for two nights. The balcony is right outside the swimming pool, which is very convenient! We stayed in the hotel for five whole days without leaving the hotel door. We devoted ourselves to vacationing in the Ritz Hotel. It was very comfortable!

msg:The last stop of our trip to Sanya, the villa pool room at the Ritz-Carlton, Yalong Bay, is really great! No matter which city you are in, you can always trust Ritz-Carlton!

The service is simply top-notch. The butler Ivan is attentive to every detail. He always responds instantly via WeChat. You can contact him for anything. You can even ask him what kind of flowers and plants fell into the swimming pool~

The skin care products and cosmetics scattered on the dressing table will be placed neatly by the room service staff with small towels, a savior for lazy people! After discovering that we had used the room swimming pool, we specially put a few extra large bath towels when cleaning the room the next day. This sense of service is simply adorable!

There are drinks in the refrigerator, which can be refilled at any time after use. There are bottled water in every corner of the room. Even the sink has taken into account the need to rinse your mouth with clean water after brushing your teeth. There are 9 bottles next to the coffee capsule machine, and even the auxiliary bathroom There is bottled water, hahaha, it feels like the room attendant is really worried!

The flowers in the room are hydrangeas. This hydrangea is not cut off as a whole and inserted into the vase. Instead, the flowers are cut off one by one and inserted into the nutritious mud, so the shape is a perfect spherical shape! Perfect sense of detail!

The small kitchen has an induction cooker, but no tableware is provided. The microwave, refrigerator, and disinfection cabinet are all from Siemens, and the hair dryer is from Braun. Is it time to upgrade the hair dryer to a Dyson?-)
The cold water from the faucet is temperature-controlled, and the water is always warm, which is very considerate, but why doesn't every faucet have a foaming filter? If the water flow is too large, there will be splashing.
Also, the socket on the wall on the right side of the sink is not very stable. There will be poor contact when using the hair dryer. I hope it can be improved.

The towels in the whole room are 98% new, and the toiletries are in large bottles. This really makes me very satisfied, because I hate using small bottles. I just put a large bottle with a pump in the room for easy use. Effortlessly.

The mattress is very soft and very supportive, and it doesn't affect my rest at all even if my family wakes up late at night.

The swimming pool is not big, and the water is not deep, but it is enough for me to ride My Little Pony in the pool. Occasionally, there will be falling flowers and leaves floating on the pool, which is very charming! Since it is an in-room swimming pool, you don‚Äôt have to flee awkwardly back to your room from the public swimming pool when it rains. Instead, you can freely soak in the rain in the swimming pool and wait for it to stop. There is a faucet beside the pool, so you can simply shower and then go to the bathroom to take a shower. , focusing on a leisurely stroll.

The courtyard is not big, but it is small and exquisite. There are fallen plumeria flowers. I picked up a few flowers to decorate the swimming pool beautifully.

Delicious seasonal fruits are delivered every day, and the breakfast is even better. There is a dedicated breakfast room in the villa area, which is different from the breakfast room in the main building. Due to the limitation of the area, there are not so many varieties, but the number of meals is small and refined. If you want Everything can be cooked to order, including eggs Benedict, hot spring eggs, bagels, paired with ham, salami, smoked salmon, etc. The ingredients are fresh and the meal quality is very high!

Dinner was at Runyuan Chinese Restaurant. The food was served a little slow, but the taste was very good. The spicy beef noodles had a large amount of beef. Although the pepper and hemp hairtail was not East China Sea hairtail, it was well seasoned and tasted fresh, fragrant and numb. When you come to Hainan Island, kidney beans must be on the list. As a special vegetable of Hainan, they are stir-fried with XO sauce. The heat is just right. There is still steam when it is served. The texture is crunchy, moist but not astringent. As a Hainanese famous dish, coconut chicken is a must-try. You can smell the fragrance of coconut as soon as it is served. First, try a piece of original chicken breast to verify whether it is free-range chicken. Sure enough, the meat is firm and you can chew it a few more times. fresh! tasty! Eat another piece of old coconut meat. The milky aroma of coconut meat combined with the freshness of Wenchang chicken is a perfect combination!

The two nights at the Ritz came to an end very quickly, but the stamina was very strong. Every minute of the memories made me feel full of happiness!

Goodbye Sanya, goodbye Ritz-Carlton, we will meet again!

Facilities: Many people have said that the facilities are a bit old, but I really don't feel that they are really well maintained. The level of hygiene and cleanliness is relatively good. Whether inside the guest rooms or in public areas. Cleaning is done in a timely manner every day. The room must have been cleaned when you return after breakfast. The cleaning staff will carefully place all personal belongings neatly. They will also clean carefully when turning down the bed, and someone will come to replenish and replace bath towels and supplies. Every day, no matter morning or evening, as long as I come back to the room, it will be clean and tidy. Restaurant: Breakfast is closed until 11 o'clock. Most of the time, if you have breakfast, you don‚Äôt need lunch. Food refills can be requested from the service staff. There are timely supplies.
Service: Do crafts with Sister Yuzi in the children's playground and complete the collection of hand rings. Children also like it very much and plan to collect hand rings to get the little lion. When leaving, Nancy and Yao Mengnan helped us apply for a late check-out until 4 o'clock.
Qianshuang bath towels are provided at all poolside and beach entrances, and they will also proactively ask if you need bottles of water. Every time we come to the beach or swimming pool, the service staff greets you warmly and wishes you a good time, and hands over towels and water. The staff is very enthusiastic and patient in accompanying children during water activities. It makes me willing to choose to come to Ritz next time.

msg:It was my first time to go to Sanya for vacation. After a few days of struggle, I finally chose Ritz-Carlton!
I looked at Xiaohongshu for a long time at first. I felt a little worried after seeing some bad reviews, but after arriving at the hotel, all kinds of worries began to gradually disappear~
First of all, there is no butler service and guardian angel as said on the Internet. I don‚Äôt know why, but I have it anyway. I received a call from Li Zi the day before the trip, asking about my estimated arrival time, and then arranged for the guardian angel to add WeChat. Here I would like to praise my guardian angel, Miss Maggie! Very patient, super good attitude, any needs can be met in every possible way! This is why Li Zi‚Äôs price is there, hahaha (more on that later)
After arriving at the hotel, I received a string of shell necklaces at the door. The attitude was very good throughout the check-in process. Because of the Ctrip membership rights, I was upgraded from the Lihai Pavilion Sea View Room to the Litian Pavilion Sea View Room for free. It is said that the floor is higher and has a better sea view. Although we had to wait until 4:30 to enter the hotel after checking in, Maggie was very patient and comforted us. We had a group-buy afternoon tea in the lobby bar. I was a little surprised that Lizi also offered group purchases at a civilian price. The waiter was Nico, and his attitude was also very good.
Every day, someone would come in to clean the room and change towels after we went out, and they had a good sense of propriety. They would not touch your personal belongings, but they would tidy up the hotel's things.
Fruits were delivered every day. On the last day, I said I wanted to drink coconut milk, which was not delivered originally. Maggie also helped me get two coconut milk. It's really versatile!
The only disadvantage: the beach is really not good after filling with sand. There are many shells and stones. In fact, you can't go out too deep. There are big stones blocking the way, and it's hard to swim out.
I suggest you take a taxi to Seaside World, which is 2 kilometers away. The beach there is super beautiful! It can be called the world's first bay!
I think the advantage of Chestnut is that it makes you feel like you have entered a private and quiet environment away from the world, so you can enjoy the feeling of vacation. The only time I feel that there are more people in the whole hotel is during the buffet breakfast. At other times, the hotel feels that there are not many people. The place is large, the swimming pool is also large, and everywhere gives people a sense of quiet and private comfort (for example, the last two pictures, the infinity pool at 11 o'clock in the morning, is definitely not like other Internet celebrity hotels where a bunch of people are posing for photos. There are only two or three people in the whole swimming pool. There are almost no people on the beach)
Finally, my biggest feeling is that the people who live in Chestnut are really rich people who come for vacation naturally üòÇ Everyone is very educated. There are no Internet celebrities or tourists who take crazy photos (I don‚Äôt mean discrimination here, I‚Äôm just telling the truth. Maybe I am the tourist who wants to **)
The price is there, and there will definitely be a lot of people who nitpick and blacken it, but I ask myself that I have high requirements for hotels. I am still very satisfied with this stay! Those who want to stay can go ahead with confidence!

msg:It was my first time to stay at the Ritz-Carlton, and it was also the last stop of my trip to Sanya.

Although the airline adjusted the flight ahead of time, and the duty-free shop product changes were troublesome, fortunately everything went smoothly.

Environment: Typical Southeast Asian style, the wooden-structured roof gives people an instant feeling of going through the rainy season. Of course, we actually experienced a day of typhoon weather.

Facilities: Mainly a family hotel, with few adult activities. There are quite a few swimming pools, and the swimming pool next to the Xili Pool Pavilion is the largest, with a water depth of 1.35m, which is also very nice. The half-hour paddle boarding experience is quite interesting.

Food: The buffet restaurant is really beyond expectations. In the off-season, the buffet restaurant only serves more than 10 tables. It was because of this buffet that we stayed one extra night. The lobster meat is fresh and has a sweet aftertaste; the steak is juicy right after it is served; the pork belly in the barbecue, don't ask, just make it.


Service: Guardian Angel Fiona provided full tracking service and packed meals for us at 4 o'clock when we were too late to catch the plane for breakfast.

The Ritz experience is amazing.

The housekeeper was also very considerate and gave me a small gift when I left. I loved it. The package booked by Ctrip is very cost-effective and has many activities, although I didn‚Äôt play any. I was also sent a follow-up photo shoot, and I selected 10 photos. They were all very good and very beautiful. The hotel booked a king bed room with sea view and the view was very good. I watched the sunrise on the second morning of my stay. The hotel's swimming pool is also very clean and very hygienic. It is also very close to the beach and has its own private beach. I also took a lot of beautiful photos on the beach. I liked it very much. If I come to Sanya again in the future, I will continue to stay at the Ritz-Carlton.

msg:The poolside room I booked was upgraded to a one-bedroom villa because the order stated that it could be upgraded for free and it might be the off-season.
Some of the hardware in the room is indeed a bit old. For example, the toilet is not easy to flush, but it does not affect the use. Moreover, the Ritz brand is very strong. I still think the villa is very good.
And the service is really great. Although the benefits of upgrading to a villa are no longer available, it still feels very good despite the flaws. Our cultural and tourism manager Ivan is very considerate, always responsive and quick, and always wants to be in front of our guests. It rained on the last night and the weather turned cooler, so ginger and jujube tea was specially delivered.
Because I stayed at Capella today, the service at Capella is really rubbish in comparison. I will write about it in my Capella review later, so I won‚Äôt go into too much detail here.
In short, the Ritz-Carlton really makes you feel like you don't want to leave. Established hotels are not built. I want to make good money so that I can continue to stay at Liyuan Residence hahahaüòÑ

Every employee in the hotel is very enthusiastic. At the swimming pool, beach, and restaurant, every employee takes the initiative to say hello and ask for needs. There are enough bath towels and mineral water pipes.
There are many parent-child activities for children, including crafts, climbing, zip lines, and paddle boards, all of which are great. There is also a Mid-Autumn Garden Party, full of prizes.
I'll definitely come back next time.

      During a short vacation, comfort is the most important thing, and the facts prove that this is indeed true. The room is quiet and the bedding is comfortable. Although it looks a bit old, every part of the room is functional and comfortable. The view is unbeatable. I really like the large and deep swimming pool here. It has been well maintained over the years.
      The service is even more impeccable. I met the housekeeper Xiao Lin, who helped me introduce the surroundings of the hotel in detail. Then, I no longer need to know the hotel service phone number. I can just send him a message with any questions and they can be solved. I can upgrade the room and book a reservation. The restaurant is in a good location, and check-out was delayed when I left... As long as I asked him, he did better than I thought. This level of completion, it should be said that in recent years, I have really come across one of the best housekeepers in SanyaüòÄThe room attendants are also well-trained , the cleaning time during the day and the turn-down time at night are very suitable, the cleaning is also clean, and the things are replenished in a timely manner. The waiters in the restaurant packed things, took seats, and replenished food. In short, everything was perfect these daysüòç
     The above is purely personal experience. You can tell by reading my original review. In my opinion, seeking truth from facts is the key to reviews. I don‚Äôt like the current reviews and coupons. If it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs good. If it‚Äôs not good, don‚Äôt comment. This time Here, I sincerely like it üëç

Because we had booked an executive room, our colleagues from the executive lounge came to pick us up in person. We went to the executive lounge to check in without queuing, and while we were drinking drinks, we checked in our luggage. Send the concierge directly to the room and we will have lunch directly in the executive lounge

Environment: It's really great. Although the hotel has been open for more than ten years, the overall maintenance is very good. There are no flaws in every corner. The lawn, beach, and swimming pool are all very clean and refreshing.

Service: Every staff member who comes to you will stop, smile, and say hello. If you look at the staff more, they will ask if you need help. We go to the beach and bring water and beach blankets to you. You can do it anywhere. After receiving mineral water from the hotel, my husband got sunburned. The handsome guy at the pool even gave my husband aloe vera to help him apply it on the sunburned area.

Executive Lounge: Important points need to be praised! ! !
I really want to commend Li Kexin and Li Shaozai, deputy managers of the Executive Lounge!
During our 5-day stay, we really felt that they help customers solve problems from the customer's perspective. The service is really considerate and enthusiastic!
On the day of check-in, Assistant Manager Li Kexin coordinated the room and bed shape for us. Since we were tired from an early flight and the room had not been cleaned yet, he specially asked us to go to other rooms to rest first and arranged for us to go there after our room was ready. It was really considerate. Very good!
My mother likes the afternoon tea in the lounge. One day, she happened to go back to the hotel and left a message for Mr. Li to save one for us. It was exactly 5 o'clock when we arrived at the lounge, and he specially left one for us, so we could enjoy it when we got back. Seeing their smiles every day when I go to the lounge makes me feel so happy and heartwarming!

I have stayed at the Ritz in Chengdu and Shanghai. I chose the Ritz in Sanya because of my previous stay experience. I felt that the service level of the stores in each city is very high, but the lounge in Sanya has more colleagues. Friendly feeling! By the way, the dishes in the lounge are also very delicious. During the 5-day trip, I didn‚Äôt eat a single meal outside. I ate all of them in the hotel. The specialty is the spicy and sour beef Hainanese noodles. After eating so many meals, Never tire of it, it‚Äôs a rare thing to have desserts that don‚Äôt overwhelm you! ! Every dish is delicious! On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, we even prepared all-you-can-eat Bolong. The price/performance ratio is really great! !

I really love this hotel, not only for the environment, but also for the enthusiasm and thoughtfulness of the service staff.

msg:The Ritz-Carlton service in Yalong Bay can really be said to be the ceiling of the Sanya area! I had previously booked 2 nights at Haitang Bay, a 5-star internet celebrity recommended by a friend, but only booked 1 night at Yalong Bay. As a result, when comparing the results now, the Ritz-Carlton, Yalong Bay is the winner in both gardens and sea water! No matter how you shoot, the film will come out!
There are many types of buffet barbecue for dinner. It is not only barbecue, but also delicious and the a**osphere is great! If you take your kids there, you will definitely have a great time!
The most important thing is that the housekeeper Fiona is kind-hearted and super serious and responsible. She contacted me before the trip started and made many recommendations. She also helped me solve many problems in a timely manner. If I come to Sanya next time, I will definitely choose this place as my first choice! I will also recommend it to my friends!

Because I came to celebrate my birthday, I gave him a small cake, a little lion, and beautiful shellsüêö. The hotel's toiletries are also super high-end and have a unique fragrance. I really like it. We booked a room with direct access to the swimming pool, but I think if you are not a swimmer, a regular sea view room is enough. The hotel has an infinity swimming pool with a view of the sea, and a private beach, which is great for relaxing in the sun. Anyway, I love living there! Thank you to our little housekeeper Wang Ruixue! ! Fried chicken is great! I will still choose here next time I come to Sanya, and I want to stay a few more days next time. If you have any questions, please communicate with the hotel staff in time and they will solve it for you.

I booked the Rechi Pavilion for two days. The room was large and tidy, with no odor and the smart home was very convenient. The terrace is very spacious, with each household having its own independent swimming pool and a direct access to the public swimming pool, which is very well hidden. The bedding is also very good. My girlfriend knows how to sleep on it, but she slept very comfortably both nights!
The sea view executive lounge attached to Rechi Pavilion offers five free meals a day! The food is fresh and delicious, and the service attitude of the waiters is also very attentive! The breakfast buffet has a rich and delicious menu and is available until 11:00 noon.
The decoration of the entire hotel is very luxurious and elegant, and the scenery is very exquisite. It has the kind of feeling that just taking a photo will make you feel like you are in a movie~
You will receive souvenirs upon check-in and check-out~

msg:Ritz is definitely the most satisfying hotel in Sanya these days, bar none.
First of all, the service attitude is excellent. The butler Xiaofu contacted us in advance and added WeChat to ask about the check-in requirements. He also made preparations and arrangements in advance. Any questions he had in daily life were answered immediately. He also recommended delicious places for late night snacks. It‚Äôs not expensive and deserves an absolute thumbs up.
There are fresh fruits in the room every day. The seaside restaurant for breakfast is also very good. You can order and buffet. Once I asked if there was any pudding and I made one directly. The employees I met on the road greeted me with smiles. The day cleaning lady saw that there was too much water in the room and brought a box over. During breakfast, the restaurant staff saw that the baby had allergies on his face and asked about it. He immediately called the hotel doctor to dispense medicine.
The environment of the villa area is private. Although there were two weddings in those days, I didn't feel any trouble. The sanitary environment is very clean. The swimming pool in the room is very clean. It should have been cleaned before check-in. The beds and pillows are comfortable, and the air conditioner is very powerful. The hotel's Runyuan Chinese restaurant is also delicious.
If there is any shortcoming, it may be that the facilities are a bit older than those of newly opened hotels, but it can be seen that they are well maintained. I hope they can be renovated next time I come. Overall, it is definitely recommended.

msg:After finishing this trip to Sanya, I came back to write a review in order to have an objective evaluation.
This time I chose the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay and a parent-child ceiling hotel in Haitang Bay. I have to say that after personal experience, RC‚Äôs service is excellent! From the moment you check in, there are endless surprises every day. Coconuts, biscuits, champagne, small gifts for children, and skilled room attendants, staying at the Ritz every day is simply a pleasure.
The room is large, spacious and comfortable, with no odor, and the bedding is very comfortable. It can be seen that the hotel is old, but it is well protected and maintained, which shows that the hotel is very considerate.
The waiter cleans very clean every day. It can be seen from the details that he is meticulous and serious. In the time it takes to have breakfast, the room is cleaned, daily necessities are placed neatly, the clothes on the bed are neatly stacked, and all kinds of threads are smoothed. Okay, the shoes are also arranged and put away. The towel can be folded into a swan or an elephant. I really want to stay a few more days to see what new tricks it can come up with!
The breakfast is very rich and varied. After eating it for three days in a row, you won't feel tired. The main reason is that it tastes very good. Compared with the breakfast in a certain hotel later, it can be said that it is Marriott's food, which is full of color, flavor and taste. The kitchen team that can set up Egg Benedict as a buffet is definitely the best! And that bowl of beef noodles, the combination of hot and sour taste is really amazing, otherwise the queue at the noodle stall would not be free every morning.
The environment is not bad, there is rich greenery, the swimming pool is divided into several, each with its own characteristics, the water is very clean, there are plenty of lounge chairs, there are parasols on the shore, and the scenery is very good.
The complimentary travel photography is also very efficient, the photo editing effect is good, and the service is also very good.
What is worth mentioning is the service of this hotel. There is nothing wrong with it. Lawrence, our guest relations service specialist, is also very good. He has strong service awareness, high efficiency and professional manners. From contacting the day before check-in to check-out, he helps solve many problems every day. There is also Nichole at the restaurant. On the first day, she made a cup of coffee for my husband and brought it to his seat. The next day, she made the same cup of coffee for my husband and placed it on his seat. Nichole would even ask me, "Mr., is the coffee today different from yesterday's?" It‚Äôs too much, there‚Äôs too much milk, do I need to add more coffee for my husband?‚Äù I was shocked, and I asked her, how do you remember the difference in the coffee of the same person during breakfast time for so many people? ! No matter how she answered me, I admire this girl!
In the following days, my husband and I often discussed the services of the two hotels, and RC was superior. We have even started planning to only book hotels in RC for our next stay in Sanya. The environment is good and the dining is not crowded. Even if we take care of our children, we don't want to dine in a small restaurant with so many families with children. Every waiter we met in the hotel made us feel that they have a strong sense of service and are willing to serve guests from the bottom of their hearts. The waiters who provide directions for breakfast will also enthusiastically guide the direction of the restaurant, say hello with a smile, and greet the children cordially. This is the a**osphere created by a hotel's culture, and this is how a hotel can be recognized for a long time!
I like this hotel very much and hope the business of Ritz will get better and better!

Before we arrived at the hotel, she was waiting for us at the lobby door and took us to the executive lounge as soon as possible. After checking in, we arranged to have afternoon tea first. During the entire stay, we received various caring and greeting reminders on WeChat, which made us feel very warm. We had five meals a day with a variety of options during our stay, which could fully meet our dining needs, as well as activities such as flower arrangement. , the service in the lounge is completely in line with the standards of Ritz~ Let‚Äôs talk about the room, the view in the room this time is really beautiful, which made us linger~ By the way, this time I also received my favorite little lion, before leaving Lina He also prepared small gifts for my family, and personally drove us to the hotel and took us to the next hotel ~ Thank you Miss Lina ~ Our whole family was full of praise for this Ritz experience, and I believe we will do it again goodbye

msg:This time I stayed in two hotels in Sanya, namely the Park Hyatt in Sun Bay and the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay. I stayed at the Ritz for a company group tour last year and had a very good impression, so I chose the Ritz again for this trip with my parents. Lina from the executive lounge called the day before check-in to confirm the itinerary and ask if there were any needs. I booked an executive suite at Huahaixuan. I mentioned to Lina that I wanted to celebrate the old lady's 70th birthday and hoped to arrange a high floor and birthday decorations. Unexpectedly, Lina gave us a surprise when we checked in the next day. She upgraded us directly to a two-bedroom executive sea view suite in Huatianxuan. It is said that there are only two rooms of this type in the entire hotel, and ours is on the floor of the executive lounge. Next, it is very convenient to dine in the lounge. Lina also arranged to decorate the room for her birthday and gave her a little lion. The privileges in the executive lounge are very good. You can eat five meals a day from morning to night, and you can also drink refreshing tea in the afternoon. It is worth mentioning that the breakfast at the Ritz is probably the best among the hotels in Sanya. It has many varieties and tastes good, especially the hot and sour beef noodles. There is a long queue every morning. It is better than the breakfast at the Park Hyatt where I stayed before. So much better. The hotel staff we came into contact with during our stay, whether in the executive lounge, gym or poolside, were very polite and took the initiative to say hello. When we strolled to the poolside (not planning to go swimming), the staff even took the initiative to give us With bottled drinking water, you can feel their sincere sense of service. JAY also provided various assistance during our stay. Since our return flight was in the evening, the hotel generously extended our flight to 4 pm and arranged a special car to send us to the airport. When we checked out, a supervisor lady whose name I didn't remember gave us a souvenir. Of course, the Ritz also has its own shortcomings. After all, the hotel is old, the facilities are a bit outdated, some cabinet doors in the room cannot be closed tightly, and the hardware is slightly inferior to newer hotels such as the Park Hyatt. But in general, the faults outweigh the faults. As the number one hotel in Yalong Bay, the Ritz-Carlton Sanya is a good hotel and worth recommending. I would also like to sincerely thank LINA, JAY and other staff for their meticulous service during their stay.

First, the environment is very good and the sea view is beautiful. The room is large, the twin bed is wide enough for two people to sleep well.
Second, the service is very good, and the exclusive butler Xiaolin is very considerate.
Third, the hotel's catering is very good. The steak, pasta, and French fries in the seaside western restaurant are all delicious. The grass BBQ is very distinctive and the a**osphere is very good.

msg:It was my first time to come to Sanya after the epidemic. On Friday night, I suddenly wanted to see the sea.
Yes, I booked a ticket, a hotel, and an airport pick-up late at night. It was a short trip that I just wanted to go on. I didn't go to Haitang Bay because I wanted to see the sea. I chose between several five-star hotels. I haven't stayed at the Carlton Hotel before. I booked it after seeing the good reviews. It's really cool to go to Sanya in September. It's cool in the morning and evening, and it's not too hot at noon as long as you're not under the sun.

 Environment: If you want to see the sea, you should live in Yalong Bay. You can see the sea in the sea view room you choose (Picture 2, 5). After breakfast (Picture 3), you will lie on a chair on the exclusive beach at noon, looking at the sea (Picture 8). Drinking ice-cold coconut juice, listening to music, just wishing that time could stand still.
Facilities: swimming pool, cinema, 4 restaurants
Hygiene: Don‚Äôt worry about the hygiene of a five-star hotel, it‚Äôs very clean.
  Food: Stayed for 2 nights and went to 2 restaurants respectively.
       Breakfast: There are many kinds of breakfast, and the beef noodles are the most delicious. I ate 2 bowls (Picture 2)
       Buffet barbecue dinner: only available from Thursday to Saturday. There is a resident singer, and the female singer sings better. The quality of the dishes is very good and there are many varieties, including lobster, foie gras, abalone, steak, lamb chops, meat skewers, etc., and unlimited wine. (Figure 7)
     Seaside Steakhouse: You can directly see the sea, you can order a la carte if you have a set meal, the cocktails are delicious, the dishes are delicious, and there are also resident singers, which is better than the indoor one. (Figure 8)
     
   Service: I want to focus on the service. I have been to Sanya many times and the five-star hotel I have stayed in is the one with the best service. Overall, I feel that the service provided by female staff is better. In particular, I would like to praise the service staff of the two restaurants.
     1. I ate a buffet barbecue dinner on the first day, and my legs were red from playing water sports. I needed iodophor. I told the service staff that I was very enthusiastic and went to the infirmary to find us iodophor. My name is *Qingjiang. Sorry for forgetting my last name. What's up?
     2. The next day I had dinner at a seaside steakhouse. I wanted to order a cocktail, but I didn‚Äôt know how it tasted. The service staff said that I could taste it first, and change it if I didn‚Äôt like it. I thought the Wellington steak was not grilled to my taste. I baked new ones, and the chef and store manager personally explained it. They also sent salads and desserts. I was so moved. It was too dark and I couldn‚Äôt see the badge clearly. The two waitresses, the store manager, and the chef were all very nice. Thank you againüòä
      3. When lying down on the beach at the seaside, the service staff brought water, ice towels, and helped lift the lounge chair to avoid the sun.
       4. When I checked in, I found that the balcony fence was made of cement and blocked the view. The housekeeper was very helpful and contacted the front desk.
    
       Reminder: 1. In Sanya T1 Terminal, when picking up the airport, be sure not to let the driver wait in the parking lot. It will be so congested that the car will not be able to get out at all.
        2. For water sports at the beach, you can ask the hotel concierge staff for recommendations. You can get discounts and don‚Äôt worry about being ripped off.
        Regrets: 1. Because I booked a hotel late at night, I didn‚Äôt see clearly and booked a twin room, so Ctrip gave me a room upgrade. The hotel upgraded the floor, but the king bed room was said to be no longer available, so I had to accept it. Later, I saw on Ctrip that there were still king bed rooms. However, it should be noted that some of the balcony fences of its sea-view rooms are made of cement. You need to stand up to see the sea, and the tables and chairs are useless. It is emphasized that the balcony fence should have railings.
     2. Except for the first two times I came to Sanya to eat out, I have always eaten in hotels since then, so I have never encountered any situations such as carrying passengers. I guess many people like us like to eat in hotels. However, the overall price of its food and beverages is high. When eating dinner on the first day, there were very few people. I thought it was because there were few people staying in the off-season. When I had breakfast the next day, there were not many people at all. Thinking about it, the price of the buffet table is too high, 698 yuan per person. I took a look at Dianping. The prices of other hotels around are between 298 and 398. Of course, the quality of the food is definitely better, but the price is indeed a bit high. If you stay for a few days, you will spend a lot of money on meals. money. It is recommended that the store offer additional promotions and reduce the price appropriately for guests who dine at the hotel continuously.
      3. When booking the hotel, I saw that there were many activities in the hotel, and some projects were given as gifts, but they were of average practicality and I did not participate in any of them. For example, if paddle boarding activities are arranged in the afternoon when the sun is very sunny, it is prohibitive. If it is done in the early morning or evening, the effect will be better. Of course, if you are bringing children, you can participate more.
       I have written a lot and said a lot. It is a very good hotel and everyone can stay at ease.

Retiro Court is very suitable for families with children. You can change into swimsuits at any time and go into the water. The view is wide and the water quality is clean
The breakfast is very rich. The hot and sour beef noodles have been eaten for four days. I love it. I tried the Chinese restaurant and the seaside restaurant. The taste is both good. The children's meals served in the room are also very good and the price is acceptable.
My angel butler Iris patiently and meticulously helped solve problems and proactively asked if she needed help booking children‚Äôs activities. She was so considerate.
Looking forward to next trip~

The most satisfactory service is Carlton ! Le Meridien and Carlton are both Marriott hotels, but Carlton is even better in terms of service! All housekeepers will contact you in advance to arrange and guide you during your stay. During your stay, the housekeepers will answer all your questions and ‚Äúreply at any time.‚Äù However, relatively speaking, Carlton‚Äôs housekeepers have better overall qualities and abilities! The day before Carlton‚Äôs check-in, the housekeeper Xiaojia contacted me by phone and added WeChat. Knowing that I scratched my foot at Le M√©ridien and had difficulty moving, I specially arranged for a wheelchair to be received in the lobby, and the hotel nurse came to the room to help me change the dressing! I didn‚Äôt notice at first that I placed an order for a twin room, because it‚Äôs inconvenient to sleep in a twin room with two children and a small child over 2 years old, so I contacted Xiaojia to help us change to a double room. The balcony is facing the hotel pool The view is better. During our stay, the hotel staff were very welcoming, and the "seal" captain on the beach was particularly friendly and enthusiastic towards children.
Facilities: Relatively old, but it is not a new hotel after all, the overall comfort is OK!
Sanitation: Qualified
Environment: The beach is beautiful, and the hotel as a whole is not bad! Less than one kilometer to the right of the hotel is an American night market! There are various seafood and other delicacies! The "Red Sand" on the second floor is recommended, and it is cost-effective.
Location: It is almost a 40-minute drive from the airport and CDF duty-free shop. There is a shuttle bus to and from CDF. This time we also arranged a Mercedes-Benz airport drop-off. I was very satisfied with my stay!
Thank you Xiaojia for the arrangement!

I lived in a sea view room, and the sanitary furnishings in the hotel were just right. Very satisfied with the environment and service. I was equipped with a butler (Nancy Yao Mengnan) who would inquire about our itinerary, needs, and appoin**ent items in advance every day. Very considerate and friendly, really feel at home. Every part of the hotel is a classic place to take pictures, and the water in the swimming pool is also very clean. Especially the beach is indeed a private beach. Will stay again next time. I see that many of them bring children to give a lot of activities. It is true that the brand‚Äôs service is guaranteed

Facilities: The hotels in the Yalong Bay area are relatively old
But I think the hardware is pretty good
Children especially like the swimming pool in the hotel
There are also several restaurants to meet different needs

Hygiene: very clean and tidy, overall cleaning during the day
There is also a turndown service in the evening, and different shapes of conch are given away.
Used toiletries and towels are replenished immediately

Environment: The hotel is really full of scenery
Close to the beach, convenient to play in the sea
In addition to swimming, children go to the beach to dig sand every day

Service: I am very grateful to the butler Kobayashi here
Actively respond to any needs from the beginning of check-in
Since the room is far away from the lobby, I specially asked someone to help deliver the food to the room
There is no need to worry about luggage, the concierge will deliver it effortlessly
On the last day of leaving the store, the child forgot to take the sand digging tool
Xiaolin immediately arranged for the delivery by the master, thank you very much

In addition to the peak season of hotel tourism, there is still a queue for a meal at 10 o'clock in the morning
Others are really 100%!
The hotel's children's activities are also very rich and interesting
Especially suitable for families with children

It is very important to choose a good hotel before you come to the hotel for a flat tour!
The Ritz is indeed considered an old hotel, but it is neither broken nor old, and it is still very delicate everywhere!
The housekeeper contacted me one day in advance. There was a welcome necklace when I entered the door. When I arrived at the front desk, the housekeeper Nancy Yao Mengnan was already waiting at the door. There were welcome fruits, birthday decorations and small cakes. The housekeeper was very kind and caring. If you have any needs or questions, please contact me. She can do it, and she will take the initiative to ask us what we need!
The sanitation is also very clean and timely. The room attendant Li Haibin feels that he will come to clean at least twice a day. Every time he comes back from outside, the room will be clean and tidy! When they meet in the corridor, they will take the initiative to ask us if we need anything!
Ritz really made me very satisfied!

I have to say that the service of Ritz is really good, from check-in to check-out. Whether it's the guest room restaurant or the swimming pool, all the staff are great, especially Iris, the guardian angel. Both the communication before check-in and the service after check-in are super nice. The lady is really nice, and Iris is blown away.
In terms of hardware, although it has been open for a while, the room facilities are not outdated, the sanitation is also very good, the beach is also great, and the hotel can book a lot of activities every day, so staying in the hotel will not be boring
The breakfast is quite satisfactory, but I recommend going to the Chinese restaurant. There are many fewer people and the food is similar. But there is a saying that Yalong Bay is really a food desert, and the products of the hotel restaurant are not bad. Whether it is a Chinese restaurant or a seaside restaurant, the chef will come. Ask the guests for their opinions, and the sense of ritual of Qixi Festival is also very good. If you really come to Sanya, you can eat at the hotel. The shops outside are too bad, and a certain review has no reference value in Sanya.
In short, I will only stay at the Ritz when I come to Yalong Bay. The service is perfect, so don't worry.

msg:I feel that domestic Ritz services are better than those of the same brand abroad...especially after the comparison with the same five-star hotel in Sanya Bay...the hotel will be equipped with a butler Ella from the moment you check in, and you can ask the butler if you have anything. And Ella will take the initiative to ask about today's arrangements and have warm reminders~

What is rare is that even if I check out and leave the hotel, Ella, the butler, will still actively and efficiently solve any dissatisfaction and problems, which makes me see the professionalism of the brand.

Before coming to Sanya, I read the reviews and people always praised the rich and delicious breakfast and the excellent service. I really chose the right one~
It is very suitable for a leisurely vacation in the hotel ~ the swimming pool and the hotel's private beach, the hot towels that have just been sterilized are delivered by a special person, and the large coconut grove lawn is very good, which is much better than the Internet celebrity attraction "Coconut Tree Promenade", because there is no such thing here mosquito.
Although the green coverage rate of the hotel is quite high, I haven't been bitten once after staying for two days. The disinfection work is super in place, and I can rest assured to walk on the lawn path at night ~ playing light and melodious light music is very Chill~~
As for some people commenting that the facilities are old, I personally think that this is the style of old money...the kind with a deep foundation. At least there is no abnormal noise like the air conditioner in the same five-star hotel in Sanya Bay, and the maintenance of equipment like the Ritz is still in place. The decoration is more in line with my mother's Chinese aesthetics. After all, the star hotels on the seaside of Yalong Bay are old hotels that have been open for a long time...
So don‚Äôt choose online celebrity shops, only look for the Ritz brand hahahaha

Key Ps: 1. The scenery by the pool is the most impressive when the lights are on. There is also a large green plant landscape in front of the swimming pool, which is also a place for supermodel Liu Wen to take pictures~~ Go beyond the film on a sunny day

2. Go early for breakfast. After all, it ends at 11:00. We once had too many people after 9:00, and the queue was so noisy that we lost the dining experience.

3. Don‚Äôt worry about the styling suggestions given by the photographer when you‚Äôre taking photos‚Ä¶ because he doesn‚Äôt respect your personal wishes and takes a lot of photos for you only because of the P-picture effect (snake essence face ten-level skin care), and Bojue doesn‚Äôt give you original photos. The picture is just a quick retouching photo made for Ai, a piece of 80, don't make a big mistake, the 15-second video is purely just a task, just run around the lawn and the beach, it's done, it's not aesthetically pleasing, please don't add too much Much money is expected. I hope you don't encounter a photographer with a bad attitude like me, so you have a weak impression of Liz~

4. It takes only ten minutes to reach Baihuagu Square. The local specialty Taiqiong Seafood Hot Pot is super delicious. You don‚Äôt have to worry about anything.

5. Do not go to the food stalls where seafood is slaughtered. The taste is bad and expensive. Go to seafood market/wanghao supermarket, buy and process

It's pretty good, and the butler Iris is very nice and the service is very attentive.

Red wine and steak üò¢ And there is no spoon for caviar... We didn't find the matching shell spoon until we were all finished eating...

After I arrived at the store, I was warmly received at the door. During the stay in the hotel If there is any need, the housekeeper Xiaojia will make arrangements as soon as possible. Because the elderly in the family have diabetic insulin ice packs and need to be frozen, Xiaojia also specially sent a refrigerator to the roomüëçSuper considerate‚ù§Ô∏èDuring the stay, the meals are all eaten at the hotel. Because I like to sleep until I wake up naturally, I didn‚Äôt go to the cafeteria for breakfast. I ate in several restaurants in the hotel during my stay. There is also BBQ for dinner. The environment of the seaside western restaurant is very good. I need a seaside view and the housekeeper can help me in advance The reservation was made and the service was really good. Little Treasure wanted a toy, but the western restaurant didn‚Äôt have any, so he went to the amusement depar**ent to help us get toys for Little Treasure to play with. The waiter at the Runyuan Chinese Restaurant was also very enthusiastic, and let the children have a good time. While eating, we interacted with balloons for the children to play with. This time staying in Yalong Bay was the most comfortable and caring time. Knowing that I had an afternoon flight, I was kind enough to take me to check out later... It was a pleasant stay, and I will choose Ritz again when I go to the end of the year few days ü•∞

msg:Very very great experience! ! ! The first thing I want to praise is Nikita Li Kexin. From the moment I checked in, I knew my choice was right! The hotel is just like my impression back then. The a**osphere is comfortable and pure vacation style. It is suitable for the main purpose of my husband and I bringing our children this time. I booked an executive sea view room. The hotel prepared a room with a very good sea view for me. At that time, when I placed an order on Ctrip, I mistakenly ordered a double bed room. Since my baby is 12 years old and likes to sleep alone, I originally wanted to try changing to a twin bed. I didn‚Äôt expect Nikita It was a great surprise to give us an extra bed for free. Although the hotel is a bit old, it is well maintained. The cloakroom, double basins and spacious area are all my favorites. I booked an executive room and enjoyed the executive trea**ent. I can eat 5 times a day and there are drinks all day. Nikita also gave my baby a free dinner in the executive lounge. My wife is so kind! One more thing to say, when I checked in, I just casually said to bring two more bottles of water. The hotel sent a whole box of water and put it in my room. When checking out, Kexin also gave me a small souvenir, which made me feel the service of Ritz again. It is really good! Next time I come back, I will definitely choose Ritz without hesitation. Thank you, the staff have worked hard

msg:I came here before the typhoon. I was very lucky. I chose one of the best rooms of this type of room. It is on the top floor, facing the sea, and the view is superb. The Ritz-Carlton in Wanlong Bay is a hotel I have always wanted to come to. This time I finally got my wish, and it did not disappoint me. My family liked it very much and had a great time. The service of the staff is excellent, especially Caroline, who was in contact with me. This time, I really experienced that the housekeeper contacted and added WeChat in advance to ask about the hotel's requirements. All the requirements that can be met have been fulfilled. Thank you very much. Miss Sister, I wish her all the best in her work!
Although the hotel is not new, it is very clean and has a good texture. It is a typical vacation style. It is a good feeling to walk in the park. Students who are worried about the old rooms can completely dispel their worries. There is no peculiar smell at all. Some hotels are new but have peculiar smell. I can't accept this. Downstairs in the room are several heated swimming pools. The swimming pools surround the room. It is very pleasant to swim here at night with the lights. The beach pool for children is a surprise. It feels like being in the sea, haha. The infinity pool is also very close to the sea, without shelter, it is so comfortable to watch the sea here at 45 pm. The sand on the seaside beach is fairly fine, the water is clean, but the slope is a bit steep, there are many beach lounge chairs in the hotel, and it is not burdensome for children to dig sand under the umbrella.
Needless to say, the breakfast is a first-line standard, and I am very satisfied. It's a pity that I didn't eat the barbecue buffet this time, but the seaside western restaurant was very pleasantly surprised. The meal for two at 1388 was exquisite, and the taste was very good. Sitting outside with the sea breeze blowing, looking at the sea view, listening to the beautiful singer singing, Really worth it!
Next time I have no reason not to come to Ritz-Carlton!

In addition to many swimming pools, there are few facilities suitable for children to play. Unlike Tianyu, the water park is great. Those who want to walk their children should go to Tianyu. If the environment is good, choose Ritz-Carlton. The hotel pool can only be rented for 68 yuan for 30 yuan. Minute water gun to play, flamingo bubble.

Only Lizi and St. Regis are considered to be near the sea, because I flew a long distance to see the sea, and I can see the sea while lying down, so I made a comparison. I still chose chestnuts. Let me talk about the shortcomings first, the hotel is always a bit old, after all, it has been around for a long time, but the location of the old hotel is generally better, and it has been renovated in recent years. In addition, there is a serious shortage of staff. We waited in line for half an hour to check in. It was nearly four o'clock and the guest room hadn't been cleaned yet... The welcome fruit on the first day was delivered at 9:30 in the evening. I went to bed, and the daily room cleaning only comes in the afternoon. The restaurant in the hotel is relatively expensive, which is a price that we would be surprised to see in the past in new first-tier cities üòÇ In addition, the service of Chestnut is still online, and basic needs will be met, including ordering meals that are not on the wine list. The bartender will also make a special drink for me. When I checked out, I asked for four pairs of room slippers (because they were so comfortable and I wanted to wear them on the return flight) and they were delivered immediately. In addition, it was too hot in those days and we were too lazy to go out. After ordering countless takeaways and refreshments, the housekeeper delivered them to our room without complaint, and said countless thanks to the service staff every day. The whole family is very satisfied, the sea view is invincible, and they spent an unforgettable vacation. I hope that Chestnut will maintain its standard and do better.

4. There are fewer people on the private beach, and the sea water and beach are relatively clean, but the beach has a steep slope and is not flat.
5. The food in the Chinese restaurant is delicious, especially eel and eggplant pot.

The overall feeling is okay.

Drinks in the room are not included, and there is no housekeeper to contact in advance to inquire about the needs before check-in. I feel that it is not as good as St. Regis.

msg:During the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, I suddenly wanted to go to the beach, so I booked the Sanya Ritz-Carlton for two nights. Mainly because of the unique location of his home in Yalong Bay and the thoughtful and meticulous service praised by friends. This time we booked a business sea view room. After arriving at the store, we took pains to take us to choose 4 room types, and upgraded to a room type with a swimming pool on the second night.

I tasted several of the hotel's most famous restaurants for three days and two nights, and the experience exceeded expectations. Especially the special Hainan noodles in the buffet. The dishes and environment of the Italian restaurant are also of high quality. A little regret is that there are still a few restaurants that did not have the opportunity to taste this time, so I will save it for the next time.

Special thanks to Lin Dongmei and Lin Chunmiao, the two supervisors of the administrative room. Their professional, warm and meticulous service left a deep impression on our short stay. What was especially overjoyed was that after they learned that the flight from Sanya to Guangzhou was delayed due to the weather, they specially sent us an afternoon tea.

msg:The overall experience of the Ritz-Carlton, which has been struggling for a long time to choose, is still very good. The hotel environment is more elegant and tidy. There is no water park but there are some activities that children can participate in, such as paddle board, bubble party, crab catching and so on. Except for paddle board, other activities are relatively naive for older children like us, and they are more suitable for small babies. I also hope that the hotel can add more activities for teenagers. The hotel's beach is quieter and less crowded because it is closer to the side. There are too many stones on the beach, and it may hurt your feet to go into the sea without shoes. The waves are relatively large these days, and there are not many people swimming. The quality of sea water and beaches is much better than that of Sanya Bay.
Accommodation: The room is spacious. The full sea view room we booked has a good view, and the bed is very comfortable. There is a bathtub, shower room, washbasin and toilet separately, which is very good. The downside is that because the climate in Sanya is hot and humid, clothes and swimsuits cannot be dried even after washing. The hotel does not provide free drying services, which is a bit inconvenient.
Diet: The hotel has three or four restaurants, including Chinese food, Italian restaurant, Western food, and seaside barbecue. Our room included a buffet breakfast, which was very good in the morning, with plenty of variety and good taste. Fruits are not very abundant. We ate Chinese food and Italian food in the hotel. The food tastes good, but it is expensive. Including the buffet breakfast, if it is not included, the ** price will be more than 200 per person. Overall meal prices are high.
Service: Our housekeeper is called Sherry, I like it üëç, the service is very considerate, the reply is timely, and the problem is solved quickly. I sprained my foot by the pool while swimming. After talking to Sherry, I asked a colleague to give me Yunnan Baiyao aerosol. I returned to visit and greeted me the next day, which was very heartwarming.
In short, the hotel is worth recommending for the first trip to Sanyaüåπ

msg:The service of The Ritz-Carlton, Sanya is definitely the ceiling of a five-star hotel in China, especially the executive floor. Before check-in, the housekeeper called to ask if there were any special requirements. I asked for more drinking water in the room, but I was shocked when I got to the room and prepared a box of waterüòÇ. All services in the executive lounge are very good, and every meal is thoughtful. The day before my birthday, the hotel specially decorated the room with a cake and a greeting card signed by the staff. On my birthday, the service staff suddenly gave me a bowl of longevity noodles and sunscreen during the meal. It was so heartwarming! I have never made these requests with the hotel, which shows that the management of this hotel is very good! The grilled fish at the Italian restaurant is delicious!

Four days and three nights, it's not too good, the hardware, service, catering, scenery can keep up, of course the price can keep up, but the money is worth it.

Met a lot of lovely and friendly people during the holiday:
The housekeeper Oliver, who looks like a Korean star, brought us meticulous care and unexpected surprises; the enthusiastic and professional Leon&Walds brought us wonderful singing and joy; the attentive and thoughtful Chef Tang He brought us the steak that he fried himself, as well as salad and ice cream. (So ‚Äã‚Äãthe most recommended restaurant is the seaside restaurant, which not only has delicious food, but the most important thing is a proper holiday style)
Finally, thanks again to our housekeeper, Xiao Ou, who made this holiday more colorful and added a friend to my life.
See you again by fate, see you in the rivers and lakes!

msg:The second parent-child Sanya chose the Ritz Hotel Yalong Bay Hotel for 5 days and 4 nights and tried two room types. Unfortunately, there was no room upgrade. Litian and Lichi may not be able to upgrade due to the long waiting time for check-in. The lady at the front desk gave an application After entering the rest room, I can feel that she wants to do her best to help gold card members apply for rights and interests. The housekeeper Fiona delivered the little lion and children's toiletries, and then smoothly checked into Litian Pavilion. Except that it is a little far away from the central hall, the view is nothing to say. The room is spacious and the bedding is comfortable. Chi Pavilion did not waste time. I thought the first floor of Retiro Pavilion would be somewhat humid, but I didn‚Äôt bring children. The must-choose room type hotel breakfast Sofia to experience breakfast because there are too many people in the venue. The queue is long and long. The restaurant on the ba*****t floor is spacious and bright. The experience is better. The waiter will bring you coffee, broth, and beef noodles. A bowl of freshly squeezed juice is a daily buffet. You have to eat as if you have never seen the world. Hahaha, I experienced the lunch service at the seaside restaurant. What I want to mention is that I experienced the service details in the Children‚Äôs Paradise. Because of the rain, we couldn‚Äôt participate in the bubble party. I communicated with a slightly fatter waitress. She said that if there was one the next day, she would call me in advance and leave the room verbally. No. I thought she would forget it and didn‚Äôt care, but she was very nice when she called as scheduled~ The child wanted to feed the small animals, but it was canceled because of the rain. The waitress, the lady who wears glasses, said that when it‚Äôs not raining, you come and I‚Äôll take her to pick vegetables and feed them. Wow, that‚Äôs it. It's a good feeling to try my best to fulfill this casual wish, but we didn't bother her. The beach is not as good as before. It's true, but it doesn't affect the sand digger. When the male staff saw the children crying, they came to inquire immediately. When they found out, they asked another colleague to take the tube from Haizi. Let alone the child was excited, and the mother was stunned and forgot to try the cocktail snacks. She didn't turn off the faucet. When we came back from the outside, the bathroom was full of water and cleaned it up by ourselves. The overall feeling of staying was good. It was much better than the other hotel in Jinmao last time. Of course, the price is not of the same level. A small suggestion is to arrange a small bench for children to wash in the room. perfect

There are different parent-child activities every day. The children really don't want to leave after staying for a few days. I will come again next time

In the end, I followed my heart and chose the Ritz. Overall, the experience of staying this time is no longer usable. "Excellent!" To describe it, honestly speaking, we have never encountered any of the black and bad reviews on the Internet. I have prepared for the worst in my heart.

Although the hotel has been open for a long time, the decoration style is not so modern, but the facilities are all online, and the facilities and supplies are very comfortable, without that old feeling. In terms of parenting, it is very suitable for children under the age of five. There are various activities every day, and the physical strength of the baby can be fully released. In terms of service, all the hotel staff passing by will smile and say hello, and clean the room on time every day, especially Our butler, Sherry, asked us what we needed every day, and the fruit was delivered every day. We stayed for five days and four nights, and she also took the initiative to ask about our needs during the two days of her vacation. The baby had a fever on the fourth day of playing with water. Sherry helped us arrange the baby's favorite breakfast to be delivered to the room, and also sent condolences to the little lion. The baby is very happy to have two little lions~ I really appreciate Sherry's care these days, because the baby was sick and the original plan We had to go directly to the airport, and the plane was late. Sherry helped us to apply for a late check-out so that we could take care of the baby in the hotel. Every day, we arranged for the staff to deliver breakfast to the room. The whole hotel is very large, and water is provided everywhere we go. Every restaurant is delicious. As long as you go for breakfast before 8 o'clock, you will not encounter large groups. After all, there are so many people staying in such a big hotel, and there will always be a peak dining period, so just adjust the time by yourself. Breakfast The hot and sour Hainan noodles are really delicious. I eat two bowls for breakfast every day. It's very comfortable~ In short, the experience of staying this time is great, and I look forward to the next encounter with Ritz and Sherry

Marriott‚Äôs catering has always maintained a high standard, and Ritz is no exception. The Chinese restaurant Runyuan and Seaside Steak The products of the western restaurant are quite stable, and every meal is settled at the hotel during the stay. I am very satisfied! In particular, the seaside western restaurant not only tastes good, the staff is also very warm and thoughtful, and the whole dining experience is very pleasant! Finally, I would like to say that the previous reviews said that the sand on the beach is thick. In fact, I think they may be walking along the beach. If you walk close to the edge of the sea, there will be no such problem at all. The sand there is fine. . Thank you Ritz-Carlton for giving me such a wonderful weekend full of surprises! Will definitely come again!

She informed the hotel of the hotel's activities in a timely manner. Before checking out, I asked about the experience of the stay and whether I needed anything else The service, the waiter Li Yanyan and Cen Xiaoying made the hygiene very clean and tidy every day, and replenished mineral water and daily necessities in time. When I entered the door the next night, I found a towel like a bunny on the bed. I was so surprised~ The breakfast was very rich, and the queue was so sour The spicy beef noodle soup is delicious hahaha, the overall stay experience is very good, and the hotel environment is also great!

msg:I saw some people say that the service is not good. I can only say that it is very correct to lower my expectations for the off-season. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a room. The receptionist and service staff were very enthusiastic, and every detail felt respected. I sent little lion dolls, necklaces, bracelets, small fans, grooming sets, crayons, children's passports, etc. There are many parent-child activities, but some are not suitable for our young babies. We played bubble party, flying carpet, paddle board experience, and sand digging. The children had a great time. The butler, Sherry, is very attentive and basically responsive. The breakfast is friendly. By 11 o'clock, it's brunch after a late sleep.
There are also disadvantages: the children's paradise is too small, not suitable for babies over 2 years old. The beach sand is too co****. There is no non-slip mat in the bathroom, the baby fell down, and later found it in the basket next to the bathtub and had to put it by herself. The minibar is not free, and meals in several restaurants are quite expensive. The price does not include taxes and fees, and room service cannot be discounted by members.

There is a large lawn directly opposite the lobby. It is only a few minutes away from the room to the beach of the hotel.

Facilities: As far as the eye can see, the swimming pool is the most important thing in the hotel. There are many swimming pools in the hotel. The largest swimming pool is connected to each room on the first floor, so it will not feel crowded if there are many people.

Service: The staff has a strong sense of service, and they will take the initiative to say hello when walking in public areas. Our check-in butler is Hu Die. He took the initiative to add us on WeChat when we checked in. After checking in, he would introduce us to the location of various facilities in the hotel, and then send us information about the activities that can be booked in the hotel. During our stay, we will also send messages from time to time to ask if we need any assistance. In short, it is a very considerate housekeeper, so that we can get all-round and meticulous care during our stay

I booked an executive room, but the front desk didn't take the initiative to inform the executive restaurant about it. Later, I asked other hotel staff to find out.
The beach of Yalong Bay is not as good as the legend, there are small stones and sand, which will hurt your feet. The hotel's beach care and management are in place, and there are always security guards.
The check in/out speed at the hotel front desk is very fast.

After flying to Sanya, there will be a special Ctrip car to pick up the reserved hotel for free (only Pick up or not), after getting off the bus, someone will help deliver the luggage to the room. After entering the hotel, the staff very enthusiastically hung a string of shell necklaces around my neck. Then check in, the deposit is 2,000 yuan, and the bank card will be returned three minutes after check-out. lris Li is my butler, even after 1 o'clock in the evening, he can reply to my messages in time. The service attitude is very good and considerate. When he took me to the room, he smiled all the way, spoke softly, and introduced the hotel in detail, because the plane was delayed. , and also helped me apply for a delayed check-out service. The most rare thing is that I have already flown back to my own city, and she still cares about whether I have arrived safely. This is a special service outside the hotel. Thank you, lady, I very satisfied. There is also the aunt who cleans the house. She does things neatly and the room is cleaned very well. But I was dissatisfied with a certain waiter at the seaside restaurant. I ordered a takeaway and asked her where the address was, and she actually told me about the Hilton Hotel next door. I specifically checked with her again whether it was the address, and she said yes , I went to the nearby hotel on foot to pick up takeaway at night, hoping that the service could be more careful, this experience is not very good. I will give you a reference for the cost of the seaside restaurant. I ordered a few dishes for about 800 yuan. The resident singer sang very well, and the a**osphere is still good. Then there is the swimming pool room. I live in room 2119. As soon as I stepped out of the balcony, I saw a big paper towel under the water by the pool. I was not interested in swimming on the first day. I thought someone should clean it up the next day. Still not there, in the end I went down to fish it out myself, it was written privately by the pool, the hygienic situation is worrying. A warm reminder to other tourists: this temperature is more suitable for swimming in the afternoon (except for the constant temperature pool). If you want to swim in other pools except the constant temperature pool in the afternoon, it is best to go to the constant temperature pool to adapt to the water temperature and swim for a while before going to other pools. Otherwise, the water will be a bit cold, and you will catch a cold easily when blown by the wind, or you can just flush yourself with cold water.

Thanks to the housekeeper Spring, who took the initiative to communicate the check-in information one day in advance, set up a tent for the children and gave them a baby üöó, and took the initiative to upgrade the room type ‚ù§Ô∏è (after a few days of experience, the new technology villa is indeed more convenient and comfortable~) Patiently explained the room package Including service, and remembering all the details of our requirements, takeaway can be delivered to the room at any time
Thanks to the service team in the villa area, all requests were responded to in the first time, and various desserts were delivered in different styles every day, and the weather on the next day was handwritten to inform me that the weather on the next day was very heart-warming~ In addition, the front desk staff were also very enthusiastic, and it was very convenient to get on and off the bus
For breakfast, you can go to the seaside restaurant, which is half buffet and half a la carte. It is open to guests in the villa area. There are fewer people and it is very comfortable. You can also go to the main building, there are more people, but a bowl of hot and sour noodles every day is really satisfying üòÑ The set menu and BBQ at the seaside restaurant for dinner are very good, and the overall dining in the hotel is quite satisfying~ Spend the morning at the seaside and take a dip in the small pool in the room In the afternoon and at night, looking at the stars in the sky (I found Orion, Taurus, etc.) is indeed an unforgettable journey~

They fold animal bath towels for the children in different patterns every day, carefully remember the baby's preferences, and put the fruit that my son likes to eat in the fruit supplement. There is also our butler Andy, a beautiful butler who is enthusiastic and friendly, and will help solve problems as soon as possible and follow up. She is not on standby for 24 hours during the vacation. Really hard work! I also gave my baby a pair of Ritz mascots~~~ and the two duty managers I met were very nice! Breakfast villa guests can go to the seaside restaurant. Although there are not many types, they can order a la carte. There is also unlimited supply of coconut and sparkling wine. There are very few people and the environment is very good. The Sophia restaurant on the third floor is really super recommended! I ate it for two days in a row, it was so delicious! Very authentic!

msg:This time, my mother and I decided to stay at the Ritz-Carlton temporarily. As soon as we walked into the lobby and saw the bright and bright scenery in the distance, we felt that it was so beautiful that we couldn‚Äôt bear to leave~ The weather was so hot that people were so hot and stupid. Fortunately, there was a very helpful person when we checked in. Ms. Maggie provided considerate service throughout the whole process, and also helped us make appoin**ents and arrange many projects.

The room is arranged on a high floor ~ the view is great! The field of vision is wide and the scenery in the fundus is layered. As soon as I entered the room, I really liked the scenery outside the window. The temperature in the room was suitable and there was no peculiar smell. It was cleaned cleanly. The two single beds were spacious and comfortable, and the pillows were of the right height. The bathroom and walk-in changing room have plenty of space to use, and watching the sunrise on the balcony in the morning is beautiful.

Catch up with the weather and the seaside scenery is great, the sea is blue, but the sand burns your feet when you step on it. A staff member wearing sunglasses and wearing a brown T saw that we were struggling to walk, so he took the initiative to help find slippers, and he has been doing his job very hard to clean the beach lounge chairs, leaving us a very good experience impression. The staff by the pool are also very responsible. They have been walking around doing safety work. The staff who called seals by the pool the next day were also very attentive when they were playing paddle boards. They helped us bring towels and water, and the paddle boards were also available for us. be safe.

Had dinner & breakfast at the hotel. This time I sat outdoors at the seaside restaurant. It was very comfortable. I chose the new set menu. The dishes are very good, and the foie gras mousse and steak are especially good! The breakfast has a lot of variety, the beef brisket soup base is excellent, the jam with fruit is also well received, and the small burger tastes like childhood~

In Riz, I have a good memory of a vacation and leisure with my mother. We took a lot of photos together, enjoyed delicious food, slept well, and enjoyed the beautiful scenery~ Finally, I got a cute little lion mascot when I left the store. The perfect end to this trip ‚ù§Ô∏è

msg:The first time I went to Sanya, the Ritz-Carlton was the first hotel I stayed in. It left me with a very good impression and experience. The location of the reserved room is super good. The service of the hotel staff is also very good, with a good attitude, and the butler service is also good. Great, Ms. Fiona is super nice. If you have any questions, she responds very quickly. Because of the schedule, we need to delay the check-out. She also helped us handle it. The hotel check-in and check-out are very fast, and the deposit refund is even faster. The money was refunded before people even walked out of the hotel. All in all, it was a very satisfying trip, and I will bring my family with me in the future.

msg:Stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 3 nights. One day before check-in, the customer service called to confirm the room needs and arrival time, and I felt very good at that time. However, at 3 o'clock the next day, it was an hour later than expected. Not only was there no ready room waiting for us, but it was said that we would have to wait for an hour to get a room. After negotiation, a room was available 5 minutes later... It was stuffy After 20 minutes of check in under the weather, I was really impatient.
All the improvements, and 5 points of service praise, started from the reception of us by Hu Die Della, the housekeeper. The lovely girl cared about whether we adapted to the weather in Sanya every day and whether we were unwell. After learning that we had caught a cold on the first day, she sent hot ginger. Tea, made an appoin**ent for the next two days of activities for the baby. Colleagues are invited to deliver baby biscuits every day. In addition to the welcome fruit on the first day, coconuts are also arranged on the third day (but the coconuts don't seem too sweet). The night before leaving, I gave the baby a Ritz-Carlton lion cub. According to our needs, he will help us clean the room several times a day, making it very comfortable every time we go back to the room!
Ritz's meals are really delicious, especially the hot and sour beef noodles, and the French fries for sunset snacks are also delicious. The disadvantage is that the dinner is really too expensive, and the mimi bar is also very expensive, sorry I can't afford it... P.S. Their drinking mineral water is unlimited!
Finally, the hydrophilic part, the beach of Yalong Bay is incomparable to the previous ones. It is rough to the feet, but fortunately it is relatively quiet, suitable for babies to dig sand. The baby likes the heated swimming pool and children's pool very much, but the current weather is still a bit cold.
Overall, it's not bad, but the room is so far away, I feel like I have to walk for a long time every day, I should stay here again!

It's just right to come on vacation in the middle and late March, and there will be more people after the small long vacation in April.
The ecology in the hotel is very good, there are many flowers, birds and plants, which is very island style.
From the lobby all the way to the exclusive beach is an unforgettable view.
You need to get up a little early for breakfast, go in before 8:30, there are not many people, rich meals and considerate service.
Be sure to try the hotel's hot and sour beef noodles! It's so delicious that I make two bowls every dayü§£ü§£

msg:I had a pleasant and relaxing holiday in Sanya last week. I am very happy to choose to stay at Jinmao Sanya Yalong Bay Ritz-Carlton Hotel through Ctrip this time. The hotel‚Äôs meticulous and considerate service has been reflected before the trip. The day before the trip Lawrence, the supervisor of the lobby, called to greet and confirm the number of guests and the approximate time of arrival at the hotel, which is a very professional five-star service.
When we arrived the next day, the hotel service staff greeted us with polite smiles. The service staff at the front desk were very professional and checked in smoothly. Then Cui Xue Fiona from the customer depar**ent took us into the guest room. Fiona patiently introduced the facilities in the room and the information about the activities in the hotel. During the stay, Fiona also provided me with reservations for activities and solving the problem of late check-out. Very considerate five-star service, this kind of personal butler service is really great.
On the night of check-in, the lobby supervisor Lawrence arranged for us a big surprise gift, which was really unforgettable.
During my stay, I chose the singing bowl experience in the hotel's SPA. Masha, the SPA director, took me to the experience room. Under the professional percussion of the singing bowl teacher, my whole body quickly relaxed. This experience is great. Next, I had a 90-minute Relaxing massage. My therapist Jinna is very professional. First, she asked me carefully what scented massage oils I like. When she knew that I prefer woody scents, she immediately chose two for me to choose from. At the beginning and during the massage, I will confirm with me whether the technique should be aggravated or alleviated. Her technique is really good. 90 minutes passed quickly. After the massage, I went to the front desk. Masha, the SPA director, was already waiting at the front desk, and enthusiastically asked me about my satisfaction with the trea**ent. Then I started to enjoy delicate desserts and tea.
In the past few days, whether in the hotel restaurant or at the beach or swimming pool, all the service staff are polite and attentive to serve the guests, especially the beach attendant Xiao Wang and the pool attendant Xiao Yu, who promptly delivered welcome juice and water, etc. If I have the opportunity to go to Sanya again, I will still choose The Ritz-Carlton Yalong Bay Resort!

msg:The Ritz experience in Sanya this time is very good. The whole architectural environment is a Southeast Asian style hotel with a large area. As soon as you enter the door, there is a shell necklace from the front desk brother. When we left, the plane was late and we applied for a late check-out. The exclusive butler Hu Die was a little girl who introduced us to the layout and activities of the hotel very enthusiastically and took us all the way to our room. We booked the view from the window of Lihai Pavilion. I think it's still good, but because the floor is still not too high, I can only see a small piece of sea view. Next time I come, I will choose Litian Pavilion with a slightly higher price, but a little regret during the trip is also a rare memory. Everyone in the hotel It is very warm and impressive. The turndown service is turned down every evening. The cleaners will arrange the room as before going to bed. There is a small conch in the room and a small card with tomorrow‚Äôs weather. There is also a message on it, which is very innovative because we are traveling as a honeymoon. We didn‚Äôt participate in too many activities in the Ritz of the family hotel, but we were very happy every day to swim in the sea and the lagoon pool. The hotel was very thoughtful and prepared towels and sunscreen on the beach and by the pool. There are many varieties of breakfast in the fresh bar of the hotel. I ate two bowls of hot and sour beef noodles on the day of check-out. I eat here at night. There are a lot of delicious food. I only have to mention that there is a 5% discount in the duty-free shop of Ritz. I bought a necklace at Boucheron, which was cheaper by a thousand yuan in minutes. I can‚Äôt help but sigh Ritz yyds! Every day, the housekeeper They will ask both of us what needs we have. We are very considerate in Sanya this week. Because of the Ritz, we have experienced the relaxation and service that we did not experience before. We are planning to bring our parents to come to the Ritz again at the end of this year. Although it is a relatively expensive hotel in Yalong Bay, it will come I feel that it is worth the money. I have a few days of vacation every year to enjoy the blue sky, the sea and the perfect service of Ritz. Maybe this is the meaning of the hard work of each of our migrant workers.

I have to say that the service is at the ceiling level of the industry
Special praise to our butler Hu Die, the super beautiful lady
(The son likes her so much, but he is too shy to speak when he sees her)
When I entered the store, I introduced the location and facilities of the hotel in detail. I heard that my throat was uncomfortable, and I gave pear juice to the children, which was a super cute little lion.

The scenery of Ritz is very good, and you can go directly to Hilton
One day, I took my children to the Hilton for afternoon tea in the Bucket Kingdom and took the little train

Ritz's beach is also great, with plenty of beach towels and mineral water

Every service staff has a very good attitude, and any waiter on the road is very kind

The Chinese restaurant experienced the 1688 seafood set meal, which is better than the quality of eating at the nearby food street

From Thursday to Sunday, there is also a seaside barbecue 698 per person with a band
You can experience it next time with your teammates

msg:First of all, I would like to thank the butler star Chen. Without her thoughtful service, my review of Ritz would be completely different, so an excellent butler is the best wealth of Ritz! Thank you for her maintenance and care for your vacation dream.

Facilities: The hotel has 400+ rooms and has been built for more than 10 years. Although it has been newly renovated, there are still traces of time, which cannot be avoided, but the good thing about Ritz is that these facilities have been well maintained, so that you can only pay attention to the decoration style. Inherent impression, rather than as a defect. For example, the TV in the bathing area is an LCD TV hidden in the mirror. The sliding doors are very slippery. The only thing that can be improved is the Philips hair dryer, which is not to say that it is not good, but it is indeed an old household style.


Hygiene: The sanitation of the room and the interior of the hotel is well maintained. The daily cleaning is basically in the middle of the afternoon. The waiter will greet you with a friendly smile, tidy up your mobile phone charger, re-pave the bedding and supplies, etc. Wait, be very careful.

Environment: The entrance of Ritz is very big, it is halfway up the mountain, through the Chinese-style building is the lawn and the beach, you will get a map when you check in, carefully observe that the housing is spread out on both sides of the hall, a total of four buildings, and on the left is In the villa area, the first floor is a restaurant, a spa, and a children's playground. In addition to the noisy room full of people on the day of check-in, the entire hotel is very quiet, and people are basically concentrated in the heated swimming pool, beach, and children's center. If you like quietness, you can choose Ritz. Other hotels in Biarong Bay will be much quieter and more slow-lived. In fact, if you look from the beach, you will find that there are relatively few people on the beach at the Ritz. The further you go to the Hilton, etc., the seaside of their hotel is overcrowded with vacationers.


Service: First of all, I myself stayed with the elderly and children, from Park Hyatt to Ritz, this is the background of my review. The room was full on the day I checked in at the Ritz, so the welcome ceremony couldn't keep up. The check-in hall was noisy and there was no reception. There were only 2 people checking in, and the queue was long, which made me 100% inexperienced with the Ritz service. , will be very disappointed and easy to run to extremes. There are sporadic tourist garbage on the public beach. There are many more people selling goods and taking pictures than Park Hyatt. It is also an indisputable fact that there are cigarette butts and peels on the sand. The room I booked was a basic room type, which made my mother feel disappointed from the artistic beauty of Park Hyatt to the decoration style in 2000. The sound of music from the seaside restaurant at night will affect people who go to bed early. Waiting for these will spoil Liz's feelings. But... I have to say that Ritz is Ritz. What is service? It‚Äôs the connection between people. Let me talk about the conclusion first. The five-star praise in terms of service is only the lower limit. Ritz‚Äôs service is saturated, especially the housekeeper sister. The power to bring all of the above back to the front. After I fed back the problems I encountered to star, she made improvements in a way that turned the tide. I can‚Äôt say more about the specific service content. From housing to catering, from various fruits to various activities, she uses her housekeeper‚Äôs rights to protect The holiday dream of the staying guests, during my three consecutive stays, my mother made many "wow" evaluations, and the children made comments about how fun and delicious. It made me decisively apply for a Marriott membership when I finally checked out.

Tell me what you like about Ritz
‚ë† I have experience with both children and adult activities with my children. It is very realistic and fun

‚ë°The ingredient list of ice cream is very clean

‚ë¢The view of the sea view room is so beautiful, I really want to stay for a few more days

‚ë£The breakfast is really delicious, with a wide variety of noodles, clean and hygienic service, the most recommended is macaroni butterfly noodles and hot and sour beef noodles. I ate it for three days in a row. The pineapple juice is the best, and the papaya with coconut milk is very sweet. If you choose Yalong Bay breakfast no1, you will give it to Ritz.

‚ë§ I especially like the little conch that reminds me of the temperature every day

‚ë• From napkins to coconuts, engraved with the hotel's little lion crown logo

‚ë¶I tried the lobby bar, ice cream, and Runyuan in other restaurants in the hotel, all tasted very good

The overall impression of Ritz is concentrated in the text and pictures. Thanks again to star Chen. I stayed in Yate after Ritz. I miss the beauty and tranquility of Ritz. This has nothing to do with whether the room facilities are modern or not. Big, Ritz is especially suitable for the elderly and children aged 7-18, because of the combination of tranquility and beauty, coupled with saturated service and rich breakfast, after all, the satisfaction of the elderly and children is the best reason to choose Ritz. This will give a middle-aged man who travels with his family the greatest comfort.

Thanks again, Ms. Star Chen! I wish you happiness and a happy life!

msg:This time in Yalong Bay, I stayed at the MGM Hilton and the Ritz-Carlton. The Ritz-Carlton is the most comfortable one with the best service. Even my mother, who is more economical, said she wanted to stay for a few more days. On the first day There is a small gift as soon as you enter the hotel. When we checked in, we saw that the child we brought fell asleep and immediately upgraded the customer service for us. The room is large and comfortable, and the children‚Äôs supplies are also complete. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is also delicious, and the swimming pool is also good. Very good, especially this constant temperature pool is the largest and best among several. The children's pool is also at constant temperature, and there are many children's activities. The green fur ball grass on the seaside is very good for taking pictures, especially Ms. Fiona Cui Xue is very good. Contact us in advance, enthusiastically help us book hotel activities, explain everything more clearly and arrange it very well. Even when we went to Lingshui later, he asked us if we arrived safely, which made us feel very warm in our hearts. would stay here again

msg:"When you come back from Sanya, you don't look at the sea, except Yalong is not a bay"‚Äî‚Äî
The Ritz-Carlton, as an old-fashioned luxury hotel for tourism and vacation in Sanya, is located in an extremely superior location on the bank of Yalong Bay. The first-line sea view of Yalong Bay is within walking distance, and there is an exclusive beach area under the blue sea and blue sky. The architectural design of the hotel is inspired by the Summer Palace, a royal garden, like a palace on the sea, with carved beams and painted buildings, and a magnificent a**osphere. Although it has been in business for more than 10 years and the latest renovation has been 5 years, the overall maintenance is still good, and it can still sit among the top three in Yalong Bay, where there are many hotels.

Foodies pay the most attention to the hotel‚Äôs food and beverages. There are many restaurants that are excellent. The three restaurants I tried this time are full of experience: the breakfast buffet at the all-day restaurant Xianfang has a wide variety of choices, and there is a favorite croissantü•êü•ê Excellent crisping! The small pocket pizza üçïüçï ham and seafood from Sophia's Italian restaurant are equally delicious! The classic Chinese restaurant Runyuan‚Äôs Coconut Milk Mango Little Black Coconut üßâüßâ wife is amazingüòçüòçüëçI can‚Äôt put it down üòòüòò On the day of check-out, the check-out is specially delayed just to lock this most lovely and beautiful creative dessert again before leaving. üòãüòãüòã There is also a magnificent and open viewing angle in the lobby bar, which left a deep and beautiful memory~

The overall satisfaction of this check-in experience is full. I would like to thank Ms. Fiona from the customer service depar**ent of the hotel for her thoughtful and considerate service. If you have any questions, please contact me at any time. She will help arrange the arrangements as soon as possible. The whole stay feels warm and silky. üòäüòä

Hygiene: Virgos can't fault it at all, they clean twice a day.
Environment: The environment fully satisfies you who want to vacation with peace of mind ~ the quietness and privacy are great.
Service: The service is definitely at the ceiling level. Our butler Kery gave full marks and felt less. As a perfectionist, I can't find anything wrong with it. 1. Take the initiative to contact and inquire about the needs before arriving at the store. Most hotels can do it, but the only ones that can really implement it perfectly are Ritz and Kery (currently I have lived in three hotels of the same level), and I have not considered some of the added things arrived. 2. I am also amazed by Kery's professionalism and speed of implementation. Because of sleep disorders, I often make some requests in the middle of the night, and Kery can always help me solve them in the first time. 3. Intimate service at a suitable distance. During the stay at the hotel, my mother had a cold and cough, and Kery directly delivered rock sugar pears. The wind in Sanya is relatively strong this season. I just said that I caught a cold, and I added a pot of ginger tea that night. I like this kind of care that does not have too much verbal rendering but acts silently. I also take good care of my son. I learned about his living habits and preferences before coming here, and brought him a happy first experience traveling. If it wasn't for Ritz being so hot that there were no vacancies, we would also like to stay for a few more days because of Kery's service.
Already an old customer of the Ritz brand, Ritz has never let me down.

I waited for two hours to check in in the afternoon, but the housekeeper Fiona is very considerate. She specially made ginger soup for my mother to relieve the cold, and also helped to mediate the noise of the square music. It was much better the next day. The Ritz Chinese-style architecture in Sanya is unique and has a heavy feeling. After a long time, it will feel very grand, and you will fall in love with it slowly. Ritz is especially suitable for parent-child families. There are many fun projects, and the seaside is also beautiful and suitable for diving. Compared with other hotels, the Ritz impressed me the most is its food. The breakfast is very rich, and the dishes in the Chinese restaurant are very good. It is the best food in so many hotels. I suggest everyone to try it! After staying for a few days, we raised some opinions on the details of the service. In the end, the housekeeper Fiona offered to give us an exquisite tea box as a gift. It is very exquisite and sincere. I finally understand why Ritz has a good reputation in Sanya, and it is worth staying again! recommend!

The cleaning lady will randomly leave conch, flowers, stewed soup and so on. From the moment you arrive at the hotel gate, there are people serving you throughout the whole process. Everyone you see, from waiters, cleaning ladies, concierges, and security guards at the seaside, will greet you proactively, with full marks for service awareness. Stand in a certain corner of the hotel and feel confused, as long as there are waiters around you, they will come to help you immediately. The hotel is also very close to the seaside. The peak season was almost over when we came. The seaside is very clean, and it is great to lie on the beach chairs. The housekeeper, Fiona, will reply in time no matter how late it is every day, and help to make appoin**ents for trips and so on. Next time I come, I will stay here as long as I have money, hahaha.

It is full of ritual, and the butler Spring is also patient and thoughtful. When turning down the bed, they not only clean up again, but also fill up the minibar. The waiters are very warm and thoughtful. They accidentally scratched their hands and asked for a bandage at the front desk. After a while, they took the initiative to bring anti-inflammatory *****. After breakfast, the noodle chef returned. Will obligate to help me deliver to the table, kill the chef of the executive restaurant of Atlantis and let me cook the dishes by myself. In short, as the most luxurious hotel in Sanya, except for the slightly aging facilities, everyone sees something alive, and the service is very good! Will choose to stay next time.

msg:I have been to Sanya many times and have never stayed at the Ritz. This time I moved from Tufu Bay to Yalong Bay with my two children. My husband said he was looking for a heated swimming pool, so he chose the Ritz. In fact, I am not interested in this kind of Southeast Asian-style hotel that has been built for a long time, but before leaving, my friend said that I should choose the Ritz if I want to feel the service. As it turned out, the hotel did not disappoint from the moment the welcome necklace was put on every guest staying at the hotel. The housekeeper, Andy Xiaoying, contacted us immediately, informed the villa of the courtesy, and quickly resolved our needs such as upgrades, continued stays, children's supplies, and airport drop-offs. There was also a small episode during the stay - my beloved straw hat was lost, and my husband searched around but couldn't find it. Andy asked me about my day's schedule and sacrificed his rest time to check the monitor to help me find the hat. It was really touching. , On the last day of check-out, I gave two small gifts to the children as a souvenir. In fact, it‚Äôs not just Andy, he helps the baby catch crabs on the beach, puts medicine on the baby‚Äôs scratched feet by the pool, sells popsicles, drives the shuttle bus to pick up passengers, cleans up, and so on. The patience and meticulousness of the guests and the tolerance of the children give each guest a truly at home experience. This is the first soft service we have experienced in Sanya and even in many five-star hotels in China at the same price. Good hardware is easy to build, but popular services cannot be formed overnight.
ps: The quality of the semi-buffet breakfast at the seaside restaurant that the villa can enjoy for free is really good!

msg:Room: I stayed on the 6th floor of Litian Pavilion. The room has a good view, and the sea of Ritz faces southeast. The sun is very good on sunny days, and the area is relatively large. The functional layout of the entrance, bathroom, and bedroom is relatively reasonable. The interior facilities and furniture are a bit old, and they don't look too new and fashionable.
Swimming pool: There is a children's heated swimming pool and an outdoor infinity heated swimming pool, but they are basically played by children and are more friendly to children. There is also a central large swimming pool. When the weather is good, some people are swimming, and you can also experience paddle boarding.
Catering: The seaside BBQ on the first night, because the wind was too strong, so the experience of eating was mediocre, it was too cold, 798 per person, if the weather is good, the price is actually worth it, there are a lot of things and it is very good. The Chinese restaurant is the most comfortable and cost-effective meal I have eaten in Sanya for four days. Four adults and one baby cost more than 1,000 yuan. The dishes are all delicious. The Italian restaurant is pretty good. There are four big ones and one small one, and it costs more than 2,700 yuan. It is normal for Western food to be more expensive than Chinese food. Pizza is the most cost-effective staple food, and it is baked in an oven. The breakfast is very rich and the quality is guaranteed. My mother ate it for three days without repeating it, and she still hasn't eaten all of it.
Children: There is a children's heated swimming pool and a children's paradise. There are many toys in it. Every restaurant has children's meals. The room can provide bedsides. As soon as you enter the hotel, children are given painting gifts. In short, they are relatively friendly to children.
Services: Restaurants, swimming pools, children's paradise, lobby, concierge depar**ent, there are many service personnel in various places, so the service can keep up, and there is a butler service, which is very convenient. Our butler is della, basically all of us She helped us with all ideas and reservations, and we are very satisfied with it!

msg:I struggled for a long time on whether I should write this review or not. Until last night, I told myself that the hotel is too busy after the Chinese New Year, and it is not easy. I am afraid that it will have a bad influence on you! However, when I returned to the hotel from outside at ten o'clock in the evening and opened the door, I was surprised. I hope this review will help you improve your hotel services and bring a better experience to future guests.
From the beginning, a family of four plans to come to Sanya to welcome the New Year, three days at Atlantis, three days at Ritz-Carlton, maybe because I lived in Atlantis first, I felt the lack of services at Ritz-Carlton Bar! The reason for this comparison is that two hotels were booked at almost the same price, both of which are around 6,000 yuan per night. The following points are compared from the following points, so that we can see the problem better: 1. When you arrive at the entrance of the Atlantis Hotel, there are six or seven doormen who will help you open the door and carry your luggage.
When we arrived at the entrance of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, it was about 7:30 in the evening. There were two female doormen there. We were too weak to help us open the door and get our luggage. We took it ourselves.
2. Go to the front desk to check in, the service butler confirms the check-in, and directly informs the cleaning staff to prepare the children's slippers and bathrobes and deliver them to the room. The speed is very fast.
In the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the housekeeper did not provide related items and services for children, which also led to subsequent service problems.
 3. The butler of Atlantis took us to the room and told us that all the drinks and food in the refrigerator are free, unlimited, and will be filled up the next day, as well as free afternoon tea, light meals and happy hour for dinner, free tickets to the water world, The aquarium is free, even after twelve o'clock in the evening, any questions will be answered in seconds, and the service is in place, including how to arrange to go to the water world, what things need to be brought, and meticulous.
The Ritz-Carlton butler took us into the room and told us about the charges for food such as French fries and Evian water in the refrigerator (this is also the question I am most confused about. We live in a room of 6,000 yuan per night, and a box of French fries costs 3 yuan. I really don‚Äôt understand the charges! Is it the guests who are short of the few dollars or your hotel is short of the few dollars? I feel very upset.) The follow-up housekeeper also briefly introduced the corresponding hotel-related services and the location of the restaurant. Ritz Carl The location of Dayton Hotel is still very good, with relatively large floor space and relatively quiet. I think this is the biggest advantage of your hotel. From the perspective of added value, there is no way to compare with Atlantis. The house price, your added value is too low, and there are almost no valuable additional services!
 4. This also made me very dissatisfied. I went to the beach the next morning and found that there were no children's sandals in the room, so I asked the housekeeper to bring the children's sandals. After waiting for about 17-18 minutes, I still didn't send them. Come on, the kids couldn‚Äôt wait any longer, we finally went to the beach in cloth dragging (there were urgings during the process, I thought this might be an accident at the time, please give me your understanding!), and went to the swimming pool at 2:30 in the afternoon to swim and found There are no children wearing bathrobes, and I asked the housekeeper to bring children‚Äôs bathrobes. After 2-3 reminders, it took 21 minutes to deliver them. I really don‚Äôt understand: your waiter‚Äôs time is more important than the customer‚Äôs time. There is another mention on the surface, what is shown is your arrogance or the lack of service management! Another thing that happened on this day was that the cleaning staff came to clean up and did not change the sheets!
5. Checked in on the third day, had breakfast in the morning and went to the city to play, left the room at about 09:30 in the morning, and returned to the room at 10:00 in the evening, and found that the scene was the same as when we left in the morning, the sanitation was not cleaned, the bed was not made, There is no drinking mineral water in the room, as evidenced by the attached picture! At this time, I was a little bit over the top. Considering that I really didn‚Äôt want to get angry during the Chinese New Year, I endured it and asked them to bring mineral water. The room was not cleaned, let alone the sheets. It was too late, wash and sleep Bar!
6. With regard to safety, the beach in Atlantis is guarded when you enter and leave the beach. You can only enter and exit after verifying your identity. The door of your hotel to the beach is not guarded. You can enter and exit at will. Even outsiders can enter the hotel.
7. About breakfast, go to have breakfast from 9:30 to 10:00. This is the peak period, and guests have to wait in line. It can‚Äôt accommodate so many guests, and they have to wait for more than ten minutes. In your eyes, the time for guests is Not precious! You are not customer centric! There are also points worthy of praise here (the service of the waiters in the breakfast room is still very good, responsive, quick response, service attitude is very good, and the hot and sour beef noodles are very good!)

Maybe the housekeeper felt that the service was not good in the past two days, so he sent two lion dolls to the children. We stayed at your hotel to have fun and celebrate the Spring Festival. It can be said that we stayed at your hotel for three days and felt very uncomfortable. It affects my mood very much, and I have been controlling my emotions. Until we left the store and returned, we did not receive a "goodbye" from your housekeeper. At the same time, I am also very surprised why your rating on Ctrip is so high! ? I feel like I was cheated by this rating!

It's still the classic saying: "No comparison, no harm", with almost the same house price, I spent every day happily in Atlantis, but at Ritz-Carlton I feel like I live in a five-star hardware service Samsung's Great hotel, this is the real feeling!
The above content is a real fact, without any fabrication or slander, all written based on fact comparison, I am responsible for the above written content! This evaluation is a bit long, I hope this evaluation can inspire you, improve your service quality in the future, and provide customers with satisfactory services!

Two nights at the Ritz-Carlton, Sanya, check-in on the 30th of the year (the episode about choosing a room is omitted) I was in the room on the morning of the first day of the new year (sent a message on the balcony), and the waiter came to do the cleaning, and took it away without my permission.

When I strongly asked to check the monitoring, my things were delivered in two minutes, saying that they were taken away as garbage! ! ! ! I just want to ask me how my things become garbage for a room fee of five thousand yuan a night! ! ! ! ! The most annoying thing was when the housekeeping manager dealt with the problem and explained to me that it was a very small mistake! Deal with the problem by avoiding the serious and taking the light way! Everyone still needs to think twice before considering whether to live in such a hotel!

msg:I think I can speak as an old customer of Ritz.
As a senior guest who has stayed at Ritz-Carlton Sanya every year for 5-6 consecutive years, I can only say that I am more and more disappointed with the service of Ritz. Let's start with the reception at the front desk. I came with my family. There was no welcoming ceremony, no welcome necklace, and the receptionist who checked in was expressionless and had no enthusiasm. The room was not cleaned until 5 pm, which made us wait for a long time, and there was no apology. There were many people in the hotel, and the people in the seaside restaurant bar were also ashen and had no service. I ordered a lot of things, but they said that they couldn't make them due to insufficient raw materials. Whatever I ordered, there was nothing. The hotel has no reception and no butler service. The original butler was called *******. It seems that he has become a very ** manager now. ** to the old customers who deleted it. I want to report the problem but there is no way to complain. I would like to ask if your hotel climbed up the Internet little by little by stepping on the trust of old customers? I will never stay in this hotel when I come to Sanya in the future. The Westin Wanning next door has better service than you. If Ritz does not improve and continues like this, you will not be able to retain your high-quality customers.

Twice, I wanted to drink some sugar and salt water because my stomach was uncomfortable after Yangkang, and he helped to go to the kitchen to get it.

msg:It is the second time to live in Ritz within a month, and it is undoubtedly true love. The view from the swimming pool room 2103 is invincible, but it is close to the elevator. It is a bit noisy at 90 o'clock in the evening. There are many families with children, so there is no sound at night.
Ritz's philosophy is to solve the problem before it is raised by the guests, and there are no problems during the two stays for a total of eight days. I have lived in Park Hyatt Shangri-La Edition Capella in Sanya in the past few years. Although the hardware of Ritz is not the latest and most fashionable, the service is still the best, and the staying experience is the most comfortable. Every service staff greeted me with a smile from the heart. Fiona added me on WeChat and contacted me as soon as I had any questions. Various details such as fried bacon have a plate of tender and hard ones for customers with different preferences to choose. Drinking water was provided in boxes, in stark contrast to the stingy jw I stayed in later.
Will come to live in the future! !

msg:Bad service and sanitation: During the Spring Festival, the service couldn‚Äôt keep up at all. I checked in at 3 o‚Äôclock, and the room was cleaned up and given to me at 5 o‚Äôclock. When I lifted the quilt at night, there were blood stains. I thought it was a broken child. I checked it again and there was no wound. It turned out to be the original stain on the bed sheet. It was disgusting! The room service phone rang 10 times but no one answered, and the staff didn't say hello to the guests.
The environment is still very beautiful, big lawn, sunny beach.
The breakfast is very rich, from 7 to 11 o'clock, you don't have to eat at noon after breakfast.
Children's activities are very perfunctory. On the night of one, three, and five nights, there is a crab catcher. The beach is dark. Two staff members take the children to walk the beach quickly, urging everyone to finish the walk and get off work. I heard that a child caught a gray and white "crab" that was smaller than the cap of the little finger. . .
Other children's activities are also more perfunctory.
Summary: 5-star price, 3-star service. Not recommended!

You can try the photos sent by the hotel. I recommend Huang Zhiyou, a photographer who is very good at taking pictures.

First of all, I am very satisfied with the service. Special thanks to Ms. Kate in the executive lounge and intern Zhou Leilei and Zhou Fengyun. They are almost responsive to every request. The staff will greet them cordially when they meet on the road. Secondly, the sea view of the executive room is invincible. The executive lounge has five meals a day and goes out with the support wall every day, which avoids the crowds in the big restaurant and improves the comfort. In the end, the children had fun. The hotel has parent-child activities every day, and there is a warm constant temperature swimming pool. The children play so much that they don't want to leave every day. The disadvantage is that it would be perfect if the facilities in the room could be refurbished, at least the hair dryer could be replaced with a more fashionable one. In addition, I heard that there is a free lion cub when you check in. I didn't get it this time. I hope I can have it next time.

When I checked in, the front desk was cold, and there was no introduction. All the activities and facilities were explored by myself. In the Chinese restaurant For dinner, the food was wrongly served and the food was served slowly. The child dropped the cup on the ground. The two waiters glanced at it and just ignored it. This is the service level of a five-star hotel with three dishes worth more than 1,000 yuan. I have endured all these, and the most unbearable thing is that 95 yuan was deducted after check-out without any pending consumption. I came back to check the bill and found that the hotel did not give any notice! I still don't know why the payment was deducted. I called yesterday and told me that I didn't have permission to inquire and it was nothing. It just refreshed my understanding of hotel services! Never again!

msg:Most of the hotels in Sanya have the following three common problems: first, affected by factors such as climate, frequency of use and maintenance level, the hotel will age quickly after opening; second, the consistency of service level is not high, Even the top luxury hotels may be stuck at a specific time and in a specific aspect; third, there are a lot of tourists in peak seasons, and there are many children. For example, on New Year's Day in 2023, almost all hotels in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay are full.

In the context of the above, I would like to call the Ritz-Carlton, Yalong Bay "the goalkeeper of the top luxury hotel in Sanya". Currently in Sanya, only Capella, Edison and Park Hyatt can surpass the Ritz-Carlton in terms of overall quality and living experience.

The following is the specific living experience:

First, hardware maintenance is in place. Most of the rooms have been refurbished in recent years and don't look old. However, the aging of the public area and room doors and door locks is more obvious.
Second, the service level is still solid, and there are basically no pitfalls, but don't expect too much.
Third, the catering is quite satisfactory.
Fourth, there are a lot of tourists in peak season. Because even in the peak season, the house price of this Ritz-Carlton will be about 1000~2000 yuan lower than that of Capella, Edition and Park Hyatt, and the cost performance is outstanding, so many people will choose to come here for vacation.

Therefore, the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay is a choice that can hardly make mistakes and is cost-effective.

When I booked a hotel this year, I originally wanted to stay in a hotel that I had never stayed in before, and it was for the children to play. There are more tricks. But the children never forget the Ritz-Carlton they lived in last year, and strongly demand to live again. I quite like it myself. It is just right in every aspect, very comfortable. The room I booked includes the executive lounge, and the food is small but fine. I didn't worry about eating at all. The children's activities are also excellent, such as coconut picking, zipline, crab digging, various pool activities...every item is carefully arranged, and the children will go there again and again. No fancy activities, just fun. It may have a lot to do with the status of the employees. Almost every employee I met was very happy, enthusiastic about work and not too strenuous. Kate and several other staff in the executive lounge are also kind and friendly without being too enthusiastic. All in all, I stayed for a few days, and the children had a great time playing without going into the water due to physical reasons, and I didn't worry about eating, living, and playing at all. Everyone had a relaxed and happy life. The children protested when we checked out and changed hotels. Let's look forward to the next happy holiday. After the pandemic, the journey of recovery is so beautiful and worth cherishing.

msg:The overall feeling of staying at the Ritz this time may be due to the fact that there are too many employees in Jiayang at the beginning of the peak season in Sanya. The hotel is obviously understaffed, and the overall service speed is slow. No matter the room or the catering. The restaurant has meals), but the service attitude of the staff is still as good as ever. A few more comments 1. The location of the hotel is not clearly marked, including the wooden sign of the hotel elevator in the map official applet 2. The information on the restaurant on the official public account is not clear, for example The specific location, business hours, food introduction, etc. are all up to you to ask. 3. The equipment in the room is not rich. The welcome fruit is simple and there are four fruits on a plate. There is no exquisiteness at all. There are no equipment for children. I understand that it may be that the hotel has been frugal for three years due to the epidemic. Cost saving. 4. The seaside western restaurant (emphasis added) began to ask the staff at the outfield service desk if they could have a meal and told me that all the seats were reserved and there were no vacancies, but there was an empty table next to her and there was no reservation sign. Sit down. Tell me I have an appoin**ent. I said why can't I eat? Said indoors. We entered the room and the service staff greeted us. I asked if it was possible to sit outside. The enthusiastic answer was no problem, and it was brought to the empty table I just asked. My mood is not beautiful! Most of the staff, especially the tall manager in the front office, maintained the service standard of the Ritz. But maybe due to objective reasons, the experience of staying at the Ritz this time was not very good. Compared with the room rate of 2800/night, there is a big gap.

It is also a good place to bring your baby. This time Yalong Bay booked two hotels, so that mgm felt the gap was far from the comparison!
The housekeeper, Iris Li, sent us into the room and introduced all the hotel's supporting facilities and children's activities. Every day, we arranged the activities that we could participate in. Even when we arrived at the second hotel, we were still concerned about whether we were going well or not; the first day The package includes a dinner. There will be no difference in service because it is a gift package. Take the initiative to care about your needs and don‚Äôt ask for anything. Ivan from the villa saw us sweating profusely and drove a shuttle bus to pick us up , very caring!
The quality of the hotel is reflected in these details. From the previous call to book some activities, the service staff were very patient. The service staff encountered in the hotel later, such as the staff at the beach pool, will not wait for you to ask for it, and will take the initiative to deliver mineral water and bath towels‚Ä¶
In short, next time I have a chance, I will come for a vacation!

In addition, there were dead spiders on the red wine bottle, thick dust accumulated on the door frame of the balcony, and the washbasin was not draining smoothly. The sanitation of a 5-star hotel with a price of more than 2,000 is disappointing. Although the attitude and sincerity of the manager on duty to solve the problem is commendable, I still hope that the hotel will focus on the beforehand rather than the aftermath.

The next day I renewed the room, saying that the room we stayed in on the first day was booked out. If we need to continue to stay, We needed to change the room. We went to the front desk at 12 o'clock to change the room, and we communicated which floor the room was needed. After the communication, the front desk said that the room we continued had not been cleaned and we had to wait. Well, we I also agreed. You can tell us that we have to check out at 12:30 in the next second. We said, where should we put our things? Where should we go when there is no room? She also said to check out at the latest, and we left angrily. When we were going to swim after 3 o'clock, the front desk called and said that the room was ready, and asked us to go to the front desk to get the room card, and we ran in a hurry I packed up my luggage and went to the front desk, but I was not willing to give us a room on the second floor. I needed the room that I had communicated with at noon, but the front desk said that if I want a room on the third floor, I have to wait. The sanitation has not been done yet, so please excuse me You call me, what room card do you want me to get? The most annoyed thing is to tell us at the end that the room on the 3rd floor reserved for us has been given to other guests. Why, what is this called?

The swimming pool is a bit far from the room. The little brother said (sorry I didn‚Äôt ask the name) and gave me a drink. I don‚Äôt know if the hotel in Sanya has permission to the front desk.

3. The brother who loves the seaside entrance is so enthusiastic
4. Finally, I still have to complain about the hotel hardware. The RF room card will fail, and the touch is not very sensitive. The hotel basin is too shallow, easy to splash, and it will be very inconvenient to clean. The toilet is not smart, after all, it is not a new hotel. , these are harmless, what is more important is cultural and soft things, let's improve the hardware next time.

msg:After staying at Mandarin Oriental for a few days, I came to the famous Ritz-Carlton to experience it. As expected, the service of the remaining hotels of the **Marriott Group was disappointing as always. Compared with Mandarin Oriental, it was like heaven and earth. The service and catering of Yalong Bay Marriott Resort Hotel, where I stayed many years ago, already left me with a very bad impression. This time, I was even more disgusted. The villa room we stayed in had a so-called 24-hour butler. I didn‚Äôt even know that there was a separate breakfast restaurant for guests in our villa area after I checked out. Can you believe it? ? We, three adults and one child, went to squeeze into the breakfast restaurant that looked like a vegetable market early in the morning‚Ä¶ During the process of taking the shuttle bus from the villa area to the breakfast restaurant, if any service staff had told me that we could go to the seaside breakfast restaurant, this would not have happened. The shuttle bus driver, the waiter who asked for the room number at the restaurant entrance, any one person would have been enough to remind me. This shows how the so-called Ritz-Carlton is, with a golden exterior and rotten inside. The service is seriously disconnected, everyone is minding their own business, and there is no communication with the guests at all. It's ridiculous. What's even more ridiculous is that I told the housekeeper in the big breakfast restaurant that your breakfast products are too bad, which made me so angry. The housekeeper didn't even tell me that we had a separate breakfast restaurant for staying in the villa, and told her to let the restaurant manager contact me. The most ironic thing is that I had already checked out and was at the airport, and I received a call from the restaurant manager. I complained to her that the breakfast was not delicious. The restaurant manager said to me, why didn't you go to the seaside restaurant for breakfast? Only then did I know that we still have this right. It's ridiculous to the extreme. Thank you, Ritz-Carlton, for refreshing my cognition time and time again.

The doorman has no awareness of helping you with your luggage, and the welcome ceremony at the door is also in vain. The doorman lost my hat while delivering the luggage and no explanation was given. After checking in, the room facilities are old and musty, and the linen and bedding in the room are damp (of course, this is a common problem in Yalong Bay hotels. The best one is Westin, which will dry out). In the end, there was no butler service during the entire stay, and the welcome fruit was like a defective product picked up in the morning market. The overall feeling is too bad, and the price is still expensive. It is two grades worse than the JW Marriott in Haitang Bay where I stayed yesterday. I really didn't expect the service level of the same group to be so different!
Service: very poor, lost things when carrying luggage, receiving fruit is very poor and low-grade
Hygiene: Linen is very damp
Facilities: old

‚Äã[Áà±ÂøÉ]‚ÄãPizza: I was tired of eating the meals in the executive lounge for a few days, and wanted to go to the Italian restaurant to eat pizza, but unfortunately it was not open. During dinner, I suddenly received a call from the housekeeper Nikita: Miss Zhu, I asked the kitchen I baked a pizza for you, but it's a pity that it's not a hand-patted crust. You can eat it as soon as possible. When will you come to eat?
I was instantly amazed. It is very rare to have such an attentive waiter who would specially bake a bar that does not serve pizza to satisfy my cravings. When Nikita brought me the pizza made by Master Hong in the lounge , Fragrant and soft, full of cheese, a veritable love pizza, here I really want to thank Nikita for taking care of me throughout this trip, and then one day my mother and I didn't want to go downstairs for afternoon tea, she also I specially delivered the cake set to the room, and added the special Hainanese snack "Qingbuliang" made by their lounge that day, which made me sweet in my heart
The staff of this hotel really provide meticulous service. If you travel to Sanya in the future, you must only stay at the Ritz


‚ÄãIn fact, this hotel has details, not just one or two waiters who are very attentive, but every waiter is very polite and enthusiastic no matter where they go. One can imagine the difficulties of the tourism industry under the epidemic, but at this moment Thoughtful and meticulous service is the embodiment of the soft power of the hotel. Thank you to everyone who made me feel good times

The room is also on the 7th floor with a good view. Open the door and you will see the sea. The view is very good. It feels great to drink some wine on the balcony (although I don‚Äôt know how to drink, I can only drink juice insteadüçπ) while enjoying the view. But there are some small shortcomings. The bed size is 1.8m wide, which is a bit crowded for a family of three. I hope it can be further upgraded to 2.0-2.2m wide (many parent-child hotels have it). The hotel has a lot of parent-child activities. Youbo participated in tree climbing, coconut picking, treasure hunting on the beach, and clawing crabs. I was very happy with everything and didn't want to go home. Thanks to the seal coach for his careful guidance, he is very nice and patient with children. I would also like to thank Kate, the lounge supervisor, and the intern Ding Yudi Jialing, who are also very conscientious. They bring us delicious and fun food every day, and every night, they specially prepare hot milk for Ubo before going to bedü•õ. It‚Äôs really fun to come to Sanya recently, it‚Äôs more comfortable with fewer people, and the price is only in the off-season during the peak season. I hope the epidemic will end soon and everything will be fine ^_^

It may be because of the masks. Ritz's breakfast is not as good as before, and the variety is decreasing, and the restaurant service is slack. During the whole meal process, no one came to collect the dishes, and the service staff just walked around.
In the morning, Mandarin Oriental and Fairmont Kaiwei will let customers do it first. Only Ritz does not have this awareness. Ritz, you are Ritz, I am a little disappointed.

According to the signs, you need to walk up the steps to get to the elevator floor. I carried my luggage up the stairs. The lobby is too far from the room. Only on foot. There is no elevator. The rooms are average. There are few types of breakfast. It's really too ordinary, the service staff in the lobby are not as enthusiastic as the cleaning lady. Atlantis where the last family lived.

Facilities: Because it is an old-fashioned hotel, the facilities are inevitably a bit outdated, but acceptable
Hygiene: The auntie in the guest room cleans every day and will send a small shell, but it is a pity to miss the small shell for a dayüêöüòî
Environment: The environment is first-class, especially in the off-season, it is more enjoyable, the beach is also open, and you can go to the sea~
Service: Excellent from breakfast to room. You will be given a shell necklace after you check in, and you will be asked for your opinion many times during your stay. Breakfast not only has a buffet but also hot food a la carte, and the supervisor star is also very caring~ üíó I will stay for an unlimited number of times for Ritz's catering!

The only bad thing is that because it is peak season, it takes too long to check in for the room card, and it is a pity that the beach is not under construction.
By the way, if you don't have a good sense of direction, it may be a little difficult for friends to stay here. Several garden-style buildings in the hotel are a bit winding.
Thanks again to the housekeeper, Miss Molly, for her warm and thoughtful service. Respond to messages promptly, no matter how late. Help coordinate. thanks

The hardware is always prepared in the heart, but I didn't expect it to be so old after the renovation. Don't live in Building 3, it doesn't match the picture at all. I feel that Building 3 should be closed.
Fortunately, STAR, the customer service manager, changed me to Building 2, which made me feel a little more comfortable.
The hotel beach maintenance went to play next door, but who told me that the sand in Yalong Bay is good... The whole thing is not good. Let's wait until they are all ready to go!
Parts of the Ritz are refurbished, and I still look forward to the fully repaired Ritz.
Is it hygienic? It‚Äôs only twice a day at most, and the garbage was not taken out on the third day. It is estimated that the auntie did not come to hang up the sign.
The hot and sour powder for breakfast is really good, I eat two bowls every day. The most disappointing thing in the fruit is habit, I actually got it on the first day.
However, the Ritz swimming pool is good and there are many, so it is relatively scattered and comfortable to swim. There are also free popcorn wine drinks and movies in the evening.

msg:The Ritz-Carlton's service never disappoints. It makes up for the lack of a slightly old hotel room. There are many options for outdoor swimming pools. Although the occupancy rate is high, the poolside facilities such as pool and loungers are not at all crowded. There are many activities here. We learned to paddleboard. The dishes of the Chinese restaurant Runyuan are very good and the service is first-class. Special thanks to Nancy for helping us check in, and Louise for outdoor services.

The waiter said that he was trapped in the elevator and couldn't come. Knock on the door and deliver to my room.

Frankly speaking, I have needs. I rarely take pictures with my adolescent son. Take good photos and the quality of the photos is high. One point, the service is better, and the price is acceptable even if it is more expensive. The whole first-class operation is so that you can choose more photos for 80 yuan each, and the 15-second video that you agreed to give away for free will account for half of your own advertising videos. After a few days, I wanted to come again, but I was very disappointed. Although I spent 2,000 yuan to buy the photos, to be honest, the experience is really not good. I suggest that the hotel can check the partners and not just focus on making money. Only when the quality is in place can it last for a long time

By the way, he introduced various facilities of the hotel along the way, including breakfast and the location of various restaurants. The atoll room we booked is spacious and bright, with a lot of space. Each room also has an outdoor small swimming pool, which is connected to a large swimming pool, which is very convenient for children who like to swim. Eddie also recommended a Chinese restaurant to us. We ordered a seafood set meal at 1388, which was delicious and cost-effective. The breakfast in the morning is also very rich, there are many things to eat, it is very complete, and it ends at 11 o'clock. Especially suitable for those who like to sleep in. The hotel sent Bojue for free follow-up photography. Photographer Bi Mingjiu helped us take a lot of parent-child photos. Originally, it was free 5 intensive editing and 15-second short videos. However, Miss Tangyuan who chose the film was also very professional. Photo albums and photo frames, looking at the beautiful family photos, gladly accepted. The happy vacation is very short, and I will go home soon. The housekeeper Eddie is very attentive and thoughtful. He made an appoin**ent in advance to help us deliver our large luggage to the door of the hotel, and helped us check out in time, as well as the hotel's little lion plush toy. gave to my daughter. A very happy vacation. Will continue to stay next time.

msg:Facilities: The Ritz in Sanya is really too old, the facilities are outdated, the water in the pool smells bad, the lights in the closet are broken, and the doors of the closets swell and require a lot of effort to open.

Service: 1. After booking the hotel, I called the hotel and said that I wanted to reserve two memory pillows. After entering the room, I called the hotel to say that they could be delivered, but was told that there were no more. After repeated requests, I finally sent back two before going to bed. 2. When I checked in (the 28th day of the ***** New Year), I told the cultural tourism officer that I wanted to make a reservation for the New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner, and the reply was ‚Äúalready booked‚Äù in a timely manner. The next afternoon, my husband asked me where should we have the New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner? There are three restaurants that have New Year‚Äôs Eve dinner beach restaurant, Chinese restaurant and buffet restaurant. I said I don‚Äôt know. The cultural tourism officer didn‚Äôt say that there are three restaurants, but he said that the reservation was made. I asked the cultural tourism officer for the menu, and then she asked I (original words) "Which restaurant do you want to book? I helped you book the New Year's Eve dinner at the beach restaurant." I'm so speechless, you didn't introduce me, and didn't ask me which one I want to book? You book it for me. 3. After staying for four nights, I had to call myself to remind me to clean the room every day. I didn‚Äôt take the initiative to clean it for me one day. The customer service said that the occupancy rate was high and I was too busy, so I had to clean the check-out room first.
In short, the experience of staying this time is extremely bad, the facilities are old, and the service can't keep up. Completely subverted the brand value of Ritz.

msg:To conclude, the Jinmao Ritz-Carlton is the most cost-effective hotel for my one-month trip to Hainan in Sanya.

üöó The hotel is located on the west side of Yalong Bay. Since I came back from other hotels in Yalong Bay, I used walking. Of course, I underestimated the weather in Sanya. I was sweating in just ten minutes, but when I entered the hotel lobby, the concierge I didn't turn a blind eye like other hotels, but ran over to help me with my luggage, and I received a shell necklace first when I entered the door, which was very ceremonial.

This time I received üíÅNicole Yunni. When I checked in in the lobby, I asked if I wanted a drink, and seeing that I was sweating, I took the initiative to take a tissue. Because it was a titanium card, the hotel gave a swimming pool cover, and also provided a room to rest before the room was cleaned up.

The style of the room is new Chinese style, maybe this is not as popular as the Internet celebrity Autograph Collection, but the luxury of soft clothing is not comparable to that of Autograph Collection, which is why Jinmao Ritz-Carl At present (2022.5-6), the price of the hotel is 300 higher than that of Autograph Collection. On the contrary, it is more cost-effective, because compared with other hotels, the Jinmao Ritz-Carlton is basically crushed in all directions.

When I went swimming in the swimming pool, Yunni gave me a welcome gift from the hotel. After asking my location, she sent it directly to the swimming pool. The "not lazy" service seemed easy, but in fact, it was rare in the hotels I stayed in. On the contrary, such services can be seen everywhere at the Jinmao Ritz-Carlton in Sanya, including asking me whether I need nucleic acid to go to the high-speed rail station in the evening. This is the off-duty time, and she can not take the initiative to ask me for help. It is very intimate, and the Ritz also wants to be warmer than other hotels.

There are still many cases of service. For example, I just glanced at the Indian brother (probably) for breakfast, and he understood that I had a need and ran over. It was my 12th day at Autograph Collection that I gave my room number exactly.

Ritz's service is the most praiseworthy, not only very diligent but also very smart.

Regarding the facilities, the swimming pool is the cleanest in the hotel I stayed in. The width of the swimming pool is about 50m, which can basically be seen at a glance. The water temperature is also a very intimate 32 degrees. I know that 32 degrees is not the best water temperature for swimming competitions, but for For a resort hotel, it is competitive that no one goes to the swimming pool. Being able to go to the swimming pool in seconds is the first demand for swimming at the beach. I hope that all resort hotels across the country will be unified.

The villa area by the sea makes me feel the feeling of being in Los Angeles, maybe in the same Yalong Bay coastline, but I am very responsible to say that in different hotels you feel different scenery.

On the downside, I want to say that the breakfast every day is not led, so I also missed the ice latte, which is available every day at Autograph Collection, and the semi-buffet breakfast is also not asked. Do I need a single order (asked when I was about to receive the meal), I almost missed the single order when I went there for the first time, and the quality of the breakfast was almost meaningless. How many gaps are there between other hotels, the fruit is a fruit plate, but the content is also ordinary, which is a disadvantage compared with the Waldorf Astoria Shanghai on the Bund, which has a similar brand positioning and price, and is below the expected value.

Of course, the breakfast + evening package recently sold by Jinmao Ritz-Carlton is the most cost-effective option. After all, there is nothing delicious in Yalong Bay. You even have to choose McDonald's and Haidilao outside. Faced with this dilemma, this package is actually a great solution.

Sanya at sunset is already beautiful and delicious. At this time, a matching dinner is needed to implement this memory on the tip of the tongue and lips, and the seaside restaurant can completely make you forget the regional positioning of Sanya's food desert.

Lin Yutang once said that the feast of life is in front of us, and the only question now is what our appetite is.

Butler service is available, but it is not more meticulous and considerate than other hotels, for example: telling the wedding anniversary to help book a place, just transferring the information to the restaurant to let the restaurant colleagues call back, and no more arrangements are made. After the room was used at 9:00 p.m., the tableware and dishes were left outside the room for more than 15 hours and no one came to collect them. I had to go out the next afternoon to see them and put them in front of the door to take pictures and tell the housekeeper to arrange for someone to collect them. I also encountered the restaurant staff at the empty table next to the breakfast teaching the new staff how to clean the table. What made us feel the service most was Wang Guicun, the room cleaning aunt, who was polite, thoughtful, and meticulous. There are games and praises, the room space is well designed, the bedding is very comfortable, which helps to improve the quality of sleep, and the performance of the band by the pool is much higher than that of the hotels next door. So much so that my daughter, who has come to Sanya for the past three years, told me that I don‚Äôt need to stay in this hotel next time, I can choose a better one~ü§£

Lisa introduced us to the hotel's facilities and sent us to the room, which was very warm and thoughtful! Because the hotel beach is being repaired, a sightseeing car is sent to the beach of the Hilton Hotel next door, and there are hotel staff serving by the beach, and the hotel swimming pool is also very satisfied! Will choose this hotel next time!

It is very convenient to go out and the children like it very much; the beach is also very good, the sun, the beach, the sea, the coconut... The hotel staff are very friendly, Nicole The service is also very good. She will ask us what we need in advance. She also considered many things we didn't expect, very carefully~
Especially praise the hotel's breakfast. Last year, I sighed that it was too rich. I will come again this year, and I still feel the same emotion. It is really rich.

msg:To sum it up...a hotel with excavator views on the beach and no prompts when booking...a hotel with a nigh**arish stay...a hotel with no service...a hotel that made me call Marriott 400 during my stay to complain The hotel... Share my personal experience with you... I hope everyone will stop stepping on the pit...
1. No one contacted the store to confirm the reservation information and check-in needs before arriving at the store
2. Take the initiative to call the hotel at 10:00 on the day of check-in to inform the two-year-old that the baby needs to take a nap, and make sure to arrive at 1:30 in the afternoon to arrange the room to take a nap before going there
3. Arriving at the hotel lobby was a mess... No one opened the door... No one picked up the luggage... Everything was done by my Didi limousine driver
4. When you check in, you will be guided to the check-in room and no one will manage it after you check in.
5. Take the two-year-old baby alone and wait for about 10 minutes before starting to check in. The check-in ends in about 15 minutes, and there is no one to take care of it... The efficiency of the check-in staff is extremely low... The most basic smile is not available.
6. Arrive at the hotel on time for check-in at 1:30 p.m. as agreed, inform that there is no room available, and you need to wait for about half an hour to get the room card. It is recommended to take the baby to the non-air-conditioned hall to rest first... Get angry with the front desk directly, and provide the communication record with the hotel in the morning of the day , get the room card in an instant... Really hehe...
7. The check-in room faces the street... The sound of sports cars blowing up the street, the roar of trucks and construction vehicles can be heard... If you are staying with a two-year-old baby, you will arrange such a room and give the hotel a thumbs up.
8. Before moving in, I repeatedly emphasized that I brought a two-year-old baby to stay alone, and I needed a bed surround and children's supplies. After entering the house, there was nothing, and I urged countless times. After 40 minutes of check-in, the bed surround was delivered when the baby just fell asleep.
9. Begin to urge bed surrounds, children's supplies, plush toys souvenirs, children's manuals, bed surrounds, children's supplies at around 8 pm, plush toys at noon the next day, please remember... these Should be the standard of the hotel
10. There are handprints on the mirror, and there is no disposable bathtub cover. The first time the bathtub is filled with water, there will be bubbles floating‚Ä¶
11. Electric curtains, bathroom TVs and bathroom scales cannot be used
12. There is a problem with the temperature control logic of the air conditioner. There are no options such as cooling and heating. When the temperature difference between the room temperature and the set temperature is too large, it will blow to the death. The temperature is set to 25 degrees, then the air conditioner will still blow cold air with all its strength...
13. The hotel beach is under construction, there is no prompt or notice before booking, and no one tells how to take the shuttle bus to other hotel beaches before checking out after staying for two nights
14. There was always unknown noise in the room on the night of check-in, and various feedbacks came to around ten o'clock in the evening. The plan given by the duty manager in 1996 was that there would be a quieter room to check out at two o'clock in the afternoon the next day, and it could be changed after cleaning. house
15. Forced to be helpless, add about 6,000 per night to upgrade to a seaside excavator view + noise single-family villa
16. After the upgrade, I did not receive any service from a full-time villa housekeeper. I was told that I can contact the housekeeper by pressing the No. 3 button on the phone... I feel that it really doesn't have much effect other than being a battery car driver. I'll give you two extension numbers...
17. The breakfast that was blown up by the reviews is really not that good... The peak queue may take more than 20 minutes... After entering, I found that there are about 1/4 empty seats... Various managements are chaotic and inefficient... On the first day, you have to have a cup of American food until you eat It didn't come at the end... Most of the juices are not freshly squeezed (mango, apple, pineapple, etc. are not)... I thought it would be a semi-buffet breakfast... It turns out that the ideal is too plump... I have to wait for an egg roll 15 minutes or so... The burger is made with thinly sliced beef, so dry that you want to scold... It's really no better than any hotel breakfast in the same segment...
18. I made a reservation for dinner at a Chinese restaurant for the second night. After repeated confirmation, I still did not find any reservation information. I need to communicate again...
19. Indoor kiddie parks and water parks are smaller than most hotels‚Ä¶
20. The check-in information will not be returned to you one hour after check-out...Cause you to stare blankly when you check in at the next hotel...
21. Chinese restaurant taste and service are online
22. The spa is formal and value for money
23. The apples in the fruit plate sent are stale and have nail prints on them... At the same time, a serrated western knife is also provided for you to peel...

The room is large, beautiful and comfortable, and the corridor can also see the hotel view. The whole hotel is so beautiful like a forest, and there are few mosquitoes. The lawn looks like it's in an American movie estate and reminds me of Forrest Gump and Gone with the Wind. Plus the sun and coconut trees are the same as in the movie. The swimming pool is big and clean, and it's very close to the room, so don't worry about catching a cold. The French restaurant + band at night is really a perfect match! ! While eating, I felt the a**osphere of the band. When I went there, I also met the band singing a happy birthday song to a guest, and the night scene was so beautiful and romantic. The waiters are very patient and nice, and each individual fruit platter is carefully packaged in a carton, cut beautifully and has a bag.
At the end of the check-out, there was a very beautiful bracelet gift and a small fan. It seems that there will be a cute little lion doll in the villa area. It is really not unpleasant at all. ! The Ritz is the best hotel in Sanya! ! ! ! I am Alice! ! ! !

We wanted to borrow a swimming ring for the baby in the infinity pool, but we asked us to rent it at the children's center half a kilometer away. In terms of Yanlord, it is simply a world apart. The cleaning staff of the hotel is quite polite, but the male waiters are very indifferent. The service is just superficial, and it is perfunctory in the best chech in/out link. The hotel's own hardware is definitely not as good as the upstarts in Shanghai Tang Bay, but it should do better in terms of service to retain customers. The construction of their own beach, and the ferry work are done in a mess. Breakfast is all staple food, and the variety is not rich enough. The only thing worth trying is the freshly cooked beef noodles.

msg:Every year when I come to Sanya, I take turns staying at Yalong Bay Hotel by the sea. This time I am the most disappointed. The beach is under maintenance. It is estimated that by the end of the year, you will need to take a shuttle bus to the beach in front of Hilton. When you reach the shuttle bus boarding point, you will be sunburned. You have to wait, and the experience is poor. The pavilion by the pool is also being repaired, and it smells of paint. The old five-star hotel should have the best service, but after staying for three days, I was angry with the bathrobe every day. I needed the child's bathrobe on the first day. I waited in the room for more than an hour before it was delivered. The next day I cleaned and took away the children's bathrobes and didn't change a new one. I called, and it was a long wait. On the third day, I even took away two adult bathrobes. It was delivered soon, and the children were waiting for a long time...silentüòì Then there are very few parent-child facilities, the children's playground is super small, there are no facilities, it is suitable for children under 3 years old who play with toys, and there are no children's facilities in the swimming pool. The children refused to play the slide once, saying that the stairs were too dirty, and no one went to the slide on the road because there was no water and the temperature was high. There are some parent-child activities. The coconut picking activity is very sunny, and there is no queue. After waiting for a long time, it has been exposed to the sun, and the children are crying. Anyway, I will never come again. It is not suitable for parents and children. 5-year-old children can play too little except swimming.

It happened to be a typhoon and rainstorm on the day of check-in. The whole lobby was wet. The open lobby is really not good. If it rains heavily, you will get wet when walking in the hotel.
Ritz's service is good. After checking in, there is a butler plus WeChat, and you can book any activity with the butler. The disadvantage is that the indoor children's playground is too small. In the event of heavy rain, the outdoor swimming pool is not open, and the indoor children can play in a very small space. Rainy days are not suitable for parent-child activities

msg:After more than half a year, I returned to the familiar Sanya Ritz again. Of course, the first choice for parents and children is the full-day administrative meal package.

The stay coincided with the small peak of the epidemic in Hainan, and Ritz was not alone, and most of the employees fell ill. In this special period, I can only praise again and again that "it is worthy of being the top brand", and I have really done my best!

Avril and Nikita in the executive lounge went out of their way to give us the best service possible. On the first day of check-in, Nikita told the truth that because too many employees fell ill, the room cleaning may not be timely, and provided compensation meal coupons, Nice call! During the follow-up stay, in fact, the room attendants basically responded in a timely manner. When only one-third of the staff arrived and the occupancy rate was over 90%, the Ritz staff really worked hard. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks grateful!

Last weekend was the online exam day for children. The exam started at 8:00 in the morning, and the exam papers needed to be printed on the spot. I was worried because the executive lounge was closed in the morning, but Avril and Nikita kindly helped me print out the test papers and send them to the room at 8:00 every morning. Therefore, the exam went smoothly, and I would like to thank you two for your support throughout the process!

At the same time, I would like to express my gratitude to Ms. Liu Xiaoyan of the room service. She is on duty every day, and the command is crisp and neat, and the cleaning is fast and serious. Praise!

During the special period, I still enjoyed the outstanding thoughtful and caring service of Sanya Ritz. I wrote this review on the last day of 2022 to pay tribute to all the staff in the hotel industry who have been very, very difficult in the past three years!

The reason why the Ritz had no choice before was because I was worried that the Ritz opened earlier than the Olympic year in 08. It opened for 18 years. My concerns were dispelled before I even started to check in, because the St. Regis, which is also owned by Marriott, knew that I was going to switch to Ritz and took the initiative to help me contact Ritz (I also want to praise the housekeeper of St. Regis here.) The service is indeed a luxury brand owned by Marriott) Ritz also helped me to arrange a car for me to pick me up at St. Regis for free. From the moment I got off the car, I was shocked by this sea palace to luxury hotels in Sanya. Basically, I live in all But there has never been a lobby that can give me such a shock. The concierge at the door helped me with the luggage and gave me the luggage card. After a while, he directly helped me send the luggage to the room for check-in. The left-hand side of the lobby is also very private. Check-in I am also very happy. I would like to praise Miss Aimee at the front desk, including the butler service provided during the stay, which is really caring! ! The room should be in good condition that day. I made a room upgrade for free. After check-in, the housekeeper brought me all the way to the room because it was the first time I stayed at the Sanya Ritz-Carlton. On the way to the room, I also introduced this hotel to the room. Welcome The fruit and luggage were quickly delivered to the Ritz. The welcome fruit is really polite. Other luxury hotels in Sanya are all a fruit plate or a more delicate fruit plate. On this basis, the Ritz also sent two coconut rooms. There is nothing to say. The bedding and bath amenities are good, the brand of Ritz is right, but I really want to praise the service of Ritz! ! It&#39;s really Sanya Ceiling. I stayed at Capella Sun Bay Park Hyatt and the Marriott Westin St. Regis. In the end, it was Ritz. I really felt that the services of the first few were killed by Ritz. The heritage of Capella and Park Hyatt, whose house price is twice that of the Ritz, really cannot be measured by house price! ! There are more details in the service, including the check-in experience or to feel the reviews by yourself. Finally, I would like to thank Miss Amiee at the front desk for her butler-style service throughout the whole process for bringing a very pleasant check-in experience~ I look forward to seeing you next time Sanya Ritz. After coming to Sanya, the first choice, stop Capella, stop Park Hyatt, I&#39;m not familiar with hahahaha

Full of concern, especially warm when going out. The executive package provided by the executive room is also very good. Be sure to go to the seaside restaurant to feel the summer a**osphere. I also tried the hotel&#39;s spa, which is huge but hard to find.

Although she is here for an internship, she is very responsible~ always help me deal with my needs ^u^! I am most satisfied with the swimming pool of the Ritz, the sea view room has a great view, and the whole garden is also very beautiful. The gym is too far from the main building, and I was a little scared without lights along the way. This can be improved. Finally, on the day of check-out, I suddenly had abdominal pain. The manager on duty, Vier, took care of me very carefully, not only caring about my situation in the hospital, but also arranged for me Late check out, thank her so much!

msg:I am very satisfied with the activities of the families at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. My daughter has been thinking about the beach children's game activities every night from childhood to night, and finally got the hotel's lion through her own efforts. I am very happy. Participated in it, and I was sweating profusely. The little brothers and sisters who arranged the game on the spot were very friendly, and they also explained the rules of the game very carefully, nice! On the last day, the whole family went to participate in the coconut picking activity. Although I have come to Sanya almost seven or eight times, I also said that it was the first time I ate freshly picked coconuts and the whole family was very happy! The two old people also participated in the video follow-up shooting of the hotel, and they shot a blockbuster with a visual sense, which is very good! Manager Liu and Manager Chen arranged a very good sea view room and daily fruit, and it was quiet and clean! The lady and the housekeeper at the front desk are very beautiful! Drinking a little wine in the middle of the night is also fast! The muffins for breakfast were delicious, and the waiter also helped me pack an iced latte, which was very good! The only downside is that the beach barbecue for the Dragon Boat Festival dinner was set at the outermost location by the sea. As a result, we did take the place next to the food at the scene. We also confirmed with Manager Liu that it was at the table closest to the beach. If you like to eat or not, there is only the appearance of the seats here, very speechless! Forget it, half surprise and half regret! Hope to have a better experience next time~

msg:Generally speaking, it is very good. This time I stayed in the Litian Pavilion room type. The view angle of the sea view on the top floor is positive.
1. Service (5 points)
Because it is indeed a holiday, there are many people, so there is no point deduction. The response speed of the Room service is fast, and the arrangement of the night bed and the replacement of spare towels are also very timely, mainly because the attitude is very good and polite.
2. Room type (4.5 points)
Because it belongs to the hotel in this row of Yalong Bay, although the maintenance is good, it is still a little old. If you mind, you may choose those Internet celebrity hotels. The double bed is standard 1.2, and the bedding is very comfortable. It is a Marriott The comfort is close to the ceiling.
3. Hotel Activities (4.5 points)
It happens to be an event with rizt kids, both adults and children can participate. The gifts in exchange include rizt lion dolls. The participation rate is very high and it is very close to the people. It is suitable for parent-child groups. , It's easy to get tired with a baby, and it's another matter with an aunt.
4. Swimming pool (4.5 points)
There is only one public swimming pool (seemingly), which is shared with the poolside room. Compared with the swimming pools in the Yalong Bay hotels, the area is not very large (but at least it is larger than you, you say, Meimei), and there are not many people swimming. At the same time, there are paddle boards and equipment for rent. The pool temperature is slightly cooler and very comfortable. In comparison, the swimming pool here is a paradise. The swimming pools of several nearby hotels are dumplings.

Generally speaking, if you want to go to the sea to watch the sea bubble hotel in a daze, it should be very good to live in Yalong Bay and choose rizt, and give it a 4.6 points.

Another satisfying stay, will only stay in this hotel in the future.

msg:#Home away from home The Ritz-Carlton flagship store#
        I have been to Hainan for more than ten times, from Rosewood to Sheraton, and have experienced many hotels. I missed chestnuts for various reasons and finally checked in this trip around Hainan. My friend who was the manager of this hotel strongly recommended it to me. But I am actually very excited about hotels in Hainan. Park Hyatt and rc have subverted my views. Nanncy and Lisa let me experience the service that is comparable to Macau. Although there will be many hardware discounts in hotels due to the epidemic, the cultural heritage is still there.
      Staying at Chestnuts at the third stop in Sanya, compared to Park Hyatt's private chestnuts, is more life-like. In addition to eating at the hotel, you can also go to nearby shopping malls for a starting price. Before checking in, I communicated with Nanncy about the upgrade and layout of the room, and arranged a pool suite that I like. Although it faces the public swimming pool, there is no one in the corner for privacy. There is a necklace when I check in. Miss Lisa is busy at the front desk, and she also prepares a little lion for me (this doll collector is very satisfied). Every service staff I met along the way greeted me warmly. The pool staff saw me coming from a distance and took a towel and came to me. Compared with other places, Sanya has a large passenger flow and can maintain such a service level. Worthy of recognition.
When she learned that I was a little regretful that I didn't eat the cake, nanncy brought coconut and cake with her early morning greetings. It was the afternoon tea after work to draw a perfect end to the chestnut experience. Before she left, Ms. Prepared a small surprise for me, a cute little fan and a couple of newcomers, Mrs. Lion, who are so caring! ! ! The overall communication a**osphere shows that the training of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel is indeed worthy of being an established hotel.

msg:Taking advantage of the fact that it is not too hot in Sanya in March, come to Yalong Bay to enjoy the baptism of the sun and the beach. This time, I chose to stay at the Ritz-Carlton. After moving in, all I can say is that this little lion is so stable, the four days here can be described as almost perfect and enjoyable.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment
The design of The Ritz-Carlton, Yalong Bay is inspired by the Summer Palace's maritime palace, and the pavilion buildings are scattered and magnificent. The swimming pool is very new, and it is also the most satisfying place to stay this time, and the pool water is clear and clean. I haven't seen a leaf in the swimming pool for four days. The large open area and lawn allow guests to sit or even lie down to enjoy the sunshine in Sanya at any time.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Service
In one word, it is: considerate and measured. After checking in, there will be a private service butler who will add the resident's WeChat account. During this period, basically all needs are responsive. One day I went to the public beach and got scratched. When I came back to contact the butler, I immediately sent Band-Aids and hydrogen peroxide. All employees will take the initiative to say hello when they call the guests, and they are enthusiastic from the heart, and the experience is excellent. There are many other small details. For example, as soon as the sun loungers are seated by the pool, the service staff will immediately bring towels, and there is also an unlimited free trial of sunscreen by the pool. In short, basically all needs are thought of for the guests in advance.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Dining
The hotel's food and beverage types are quite rich. There are different restaurants for Western food and Chinese food. I personally like the sea, so I had lunch and dinner in the hotel's seaside restaurant. The most important thing is convenience, you can leave the hotel all day and relax in the hotel completely.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Summary
The service level of this little lion in Ritz-Carlton has always been online. If you have a sufficient budget, you can come here. It is the highest quality resort hotel on the coast of Yalong Bay, no one. Many things are not clear in words, and can only be experienced by yourself. In short, I will recommend my friends to come here. If I come to Yalong Bay in Sanya next time, I will definitely go straight to stay here, and I will not consider other hotels at all.

As a result, the epidemic in Shanghai was serious before the trip, and there were all kinds of anxiety before boarding. This is my first time staying in a hotel on Yalong Bay. The housekeeper, Xiaoliang Shirley, has added WeChat since before the trip. All kinds of small details before and after have been enthusiastically corresponded, and the service is also very, very thoughtful. Really moved and grateful. There is nothing wrong with the hotel environment, restaurants and various parent-child activities. The little lion as a gift is very cute. Baby loves it.

I feel that the hotel environment and facilities are very a**ospheric. The service is also very good. Spacious and although there are many hotels in Sanya now, there are many new hotels, but I still like the a**osphere of the Ritz. The hotel also has a constant temperature swimming pool and the lawn is still well maintained. At present, the only thing in the hotel lacks a garden, but each hotel has its own advantages and disadvantages, especially the hotel rooms. It's okay to renovate, after all, each has its own characteristics The black tea and strawberry are very delicious. We are revisiting the old place and the trip has ended successfully.

During the period, the first case of the epidemic in Sanya was encountered, which required 2 nucleic acid tests within 48 hours. The catering 5 times a day in the executive lounge is very impressive, especially the lunch and dinner are basically not repeated. Kate and Avril in the lounge have always been very helpful, especially when the epidemic required an extra night, they actively helped coordinate.
The hotel's new lobby has been put into use this time, and the view overlooking the sea is very beautiful. It is recommended to try afternoon tea.

However, in the case of the municipal renovation of the beach, you cannot go directly from the hotel on the second day of your stay. You need to bypass the Hilton next door, which is a bit troublesome and reduces the number of times you go to the beach.
But the hotel itself is beautiful and okay. This time I stayed at the Lichi Pavilion, and the swimming pool was opened when I opened the window, which is very convenient for swimming.
Although the hotel facilities are a little old, the service is really good, especially the staff are very enthusiastic and do not feel deliberate. Special thanks to star Chen from the guest depar**ent, who helped us a lot during our stay.

The Marriott hotel I stayed in before was almost adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton, so I was nearly three hours earlier than the agreed check-in time. After waiting for nearly three hours, I was finally able to check in, but the problem came. The sound is not small, and I have to ask for a room change. Fortunately, the hotel upgraded the room for me for free to solve the previous noise problem. The rooms are large, well laid out and comfortable.
The hotel has rich breakfast, seaside western food and barbecue buffet taste and dining environment are very satisfactory. The service of the hotel is very good, and I often get extra or unexpected services inadvertently. Therefore, as the time of stay increases, my satisfaction with the hotel is getting better and better, so that I forget the unhappiness that I just came to the hotel. The overall evaluation is satisfactory.

msg:The service is rubbish, so rubbish. I left the store the day before yesterday and found the charging cable of the watch pulled in the hotel at night. Yesterday morning, I called the hotel and said I would go check it out for me. There was no news for two hours, so I called and asked and said I would check it for me. After another hour, I asked again and said yes, SF Express will pay on delivery, I said yes. I called again in the afternoon to ask, and said that the younger brother of SF Express will go at 6 o'clock in the afternoon. I didn't find any news about SF Express just now, so I called again and said that the younger brother of SF Express didn't go. The problem is that SF Express didn't go and no one informed me. This time, it said that it would be expedited. Anyway, they don't have to pay for the freight. They say sorry every time, but I think they are very embarrassed. This service attitude and quality are low ah low. In addition, if the star is rated, the price is indeed in line with the luxury type, and it is actually difficult to match under the reputation.

After checking in and complaining, I was told that it is the state of expansion. Secondly, the decoration of the hotel is indescribable. The western restaurant closest to the beach has frosted film on all four sides of the glass. Sitting in the restaurant to eat, not to mention the sea view, is completely isolated from the outside... In the Chinese restaurant, there are large red lanterns hanging in a patchwork, and the old The mahogany-colored tables and chairs echo each other, which makes people lose their color as soon as they walk into this restaurant from the bright outdoors. What a surprise! Finally, about the taste, the odor in the hotel room is also indescribable, the combination of fishy and musty smells. In short, very bad stay experience, will never step in again, thank you!

msg:Overall: The worst pool villa room type of the same price I have ever stayed in, and the service is very general.
Room: The area is okay, but the facilities are outdated, the bathtub is leaking and the toilet is blocked. Even the plug does not even have a USB interface, and there is no adapter for the socket.
Privacy: very poor, the swimming pool is next to the road, the bushes are too short to block the video, you must be prepared to be watched when swimming, and you cannot open the curtains in the room.
Service: no foreign Ritz level. Having a housekeeper is just multiple contacts. You don‚Äôt have to go to the front desk every time. When the room is full, there is no service ability. The unicorn phone at the pool asked to inflate until it was gone, and the laundry arrangements were messed up. Mention that it takes two hours to get back, not to mention other personalized services.
Restaurant: The only thing I like is the breakfast at the seaside restaurant. There are many choices in the semi-buffet. The bacon is fried very well, the service is also very good, and there are few exclusive people in the villa.
There are only 33 villas, and the service capacity is also the same. The room types below the villa are really not worth trying. There are too many choices at the same price. It is the same Ritz, like two hotel brands at home and abroad.

It is also very comfortable to enjoy the green scenery on the balcony.

üîîService: Generally speaking, the staff are very friendly. On New Year's Day, it may be due to the large number of tourists. The front desk response is a bit slow, and the service of the beach restaurant is also a bit slow. Staff can be increased around the festival, but overall the service is very good; Hotel Knowing that we are on our honeymoon and preparing the wedding arrangement, I am very happy!

The guardian angel this time is Victoria Xiaoyao, who explained the room, hotel explanation, and interior decoration very clearly. In addition, he also helped us book nucleic acid tests, which was very enthusiastic and patient.
The room is very comfortable, the bedding is clean and tidy, the cleaning aunt cleans twice a day, and the request can be met at any time. The little conch that comes with every day is very cute. The words on the service card are also very beautiful, and they look beautiful, and they do not lose the luxury of a top luxury brand.

Ritz's breakfast is great, she liked it back then, and this time it continues to maintain a high level, the taste and color are all ok. It's just that there are relatively few hot dishes for breakfast, and it can continue to be improved. The lunch at the seaside restaurant is very good, the western food is exquisite and excellent, and the chef's level of sauce is worth tasting.

The constant temperature swimming pool is maintained at 29 degrees. After the sun is over at noon, the temperature is higher in the afternoon, which is suitable for diving. The infinity pool is very beautiful, and you can easily find a beautiful angle. The water quality of several other swimming pools is ok, but it is not constant temperature. It is a little cold in the morning and evening in this season.

Finally, a small suggestion:
It is recommended to increase the charging piles in the parking lot to facilitate the charging of electric vehicles.

Summary: The Ritz-Carlton, a choice you won't be disappointed with.

I go to breakfast every day, and they let me buy half-price children's breakfast for 98 yuan. It doesn't matter. When I checked out this morning, I reminded the front desk that there were 3 children's breakfasts in the room. The front desk said that a total of 196 yuan was deducted, and I reminded that it was 3 breakfasts. Are you mistaken? The front desk said no. I thought the hotel gave a child's breakfast for one day because I stayed for 3 consecutive days, and I felt that the hotel was very humane. How did I know the funny thing happened at 10 pm. When I took the plane home and went to sleep, at 10 pm, the hotel called and woke me up, saying that I had paid less than 98 yuan for breakfast and asked me to add their WeChat payment. Don't look at the time, a 5-star hotel, for the breakfast fee of 98 yuan, and in the case of my reminder twice, they called the customer at 10 o'clock in the evening because of their work error and asked the customer to pay. Makes me feel really funny, can't I wait until the next morning?

The first floor is wet, and the floor can feel the water coming out. Children like to run around with bare feet, and it is easy to slip and fall. The biggest problem is that the swimming pool with balcony access is 1.2 meters deep, and there is no fence, and it will fall if you are not careful. It's much better to change to a room with a jacuzzi, at least you don't have to worry about drowning. The staff of Children's Paradise are very loving and are very good at dealing with children, especially Kris, Orange, Seal and the teachers of the summer camp, which is the biggest plus point for this stay. By the way, the washbasin is super small, and you can't put two baby things in it. The hair dryer is not a Dyson, but an ancient Philips model. When you take it out, you will immediately have the illusion of going back 20 years in time. The Yalong Bay beach is being repaired, and the hotel cannot go directly to the beach, so you have to take the shuttle bus to the Hilton. Although, because of the highlights of the children's paradise, maybe I will bring children here in the futureüòÇüòÇ

msg:The hotel environment and facilities meet expectations. If I can choose here again, it must be because of the service here. The housekeeper Anna saw that I was bringing two babies by myself. Knowing that the children were going to play marine sports, she was worried that we would not be able to rest well, so she added an extra bed to the room. The child cut his leg while playing marine sports, the hotel asked the manager on duty to bring a medicine box to deal with it and leave the medicine for us. I am very fortunate to have chosen this hotel in Yalong Bay.

msg:I went to Lika's brand and was disappointed! Routine customers from the moment they check in!
Let‚Äôs talk about check-in first. I checked in at 12:30, and I was told that the room was upgraded, but I needed to wait for an hour and a half for cleaning. I received a call from the hotel an hour and a half later, and I needed to wait another 40 minutes. :00. If the hotel must require 15:00 to check in, it should be honestly informed, why is it necessary to "upgrade" and wait to fool the guests? !
Secondly, the so-called upgraded sea view room balcony wall to the chest, sitting down is thinking about the wall. There are also many problems with room facilities, I will not say more, and finally solve the problem through Ctrip communication
Third, check out. After being politely informed that you can take the express check-out channel after registration, the result was that it took nearly two hours from the hotel to leave until boarding the plane, and the deposit was not refunded for nearly two hours. Kindly inform the operation within 15 minutes. In the end, the deposit was refunded through Ctrip's complaint channel. Once again by the hotel routine
In the final analysis, the hotel relies on service + word-of-mouth. In the case of such outdated facilities, Lika's service is dishonest and the guests are treated like monkeys. The trip to Sanya Lika ruined Lika's image.
But we must praise the housekeeper, Xiao Sun, for his hard work and resen**ent, and he responds to every request!

msg:The Ritz Hotel in Sanya gave us the most satisfying enjoyment. Even after we left, we changed our mobile phone screensavers to this place, because we left so many good memories here.

The hotel is full of vacation style, and everyone relaxes as soon as they come in. Large green lawns (later found that the maintenance is really careful, people are paving them every day), coconut groves, heated swimming pools are very warm, and there are various fun projects. Very suitable for bringing children.

We stayed here for three days and spent three days in the hotel. Had afternoon tea in the lobby, dinner at the Italian restaurant and beach sand restaurant, and ordered in room pizza once. The food tastes very good and the environment is also elegant, I enjoy eating at Ritz.

Special compliments to the Ritz Kids Children‚Äôs Club. The teachers here are very caring and take care of every child. The daily games are also fun. They also participated in the hotel zipline and coconut picking projects. The children have a great time here. .

There is also a small episode. When we checked in, we left the drone in the lobby. We only remembered it three days before we checked out. It was already 11 o'clock in the evening. Miss Irene at the front desk was very patient to help us communicate and coordinate. I got the machine that night. Thank you so much!

After all, for some years, Ritz‚Äôs hotel hardware has been a bit aging, but why can you still live so comfortable? Apart from the hotel‚Äôs meticulous maintenance and high service standards, it is a strong human touch, which can finally be remembered by us. Those who live are these warm little stories. üíó

The quality of food is also high. Seaside restaurants and Sophia restaurants require reservations in advance, otherwise you won't be able to eat. Everything was perfect, thank you for a perfect Chris**as. The only drawback is the guardian angel given to me. I stayed for 3 nights and she had 2 days off. I don't know how to arrange it. Basically, we are offline during our stay. And the speed of replying to messages is very slow, which is much different from that of Hilton. They not only reply to messages in blocks, but also have many suggestions, which are very pertinent. You can obviously feel such exclusive service. But the exclusive angel given to me by Ritz has no other function except making me anxious. I hope it can be improved, but the service is obviously the icing on the cake, but it has the opposite effect.

msg:I really want to praise the service quality of this hotel: the waiter Kate listened to me "only drink freshly squeezed juice" during afternoon tea on the executive floor on the sixth floor in the first afternoon, and asked me what kind of juice I would drink. I said "orange juice". Two glasses of orange juice were squeezed for us; the waiter brought us two glasses of orange juice for breakfast on the executive floor the next day. I said that I didn‚Äôt want orange juice. Today, I went to the public restaurant on the first floor for breakfast. During the meal, a waiter brought us two glasses of orange juice. When asked, it was freshly squeezed. It was said by the waiter on the sixth floor. Today, we came to the first floor for breakfast without telling the waiter on the sixth floor in advance; the hotel has more than 400 rooms, the public restaurant has a lot of guests for breakfast, and our seats are relatively remote...think I‚Äôm just one of so many guests. A bit, the hotel can care about the preferences of each guest so carefully, it takes more care to do it well~~"Freshly squeezed orange juice" is just a small example of the many experiences in the past few days~~ the feeling of the past few days Yes: Not only a vacation, but also a study! I was moved to have a deeper experience of the connotation of the term "keep improving".
        In addition, all the staff in the executive lounge are also very enthusiastic and attentive, not only can remember our name, but also try their best to provide some of our special requirements, similar to when we want to eat beef noodles (too delicious) The kitchen downstairs made a hot bowl and served the executive lounge and other intimate services, and also presented small gifts. I was really touched! The food in the lounge is very good. It is the best in the executive lounge I have been to. Basically, three meals a day are settled in the lounge!
We have posted likes in our circle of friends and recommended to friends! Thanks to all the staff on the executive floor for bringing high-quality experience to our holiday!

msg:I have never written a review, and now I can understand why some people write reviews in such a leisurely and long-winded manner, that is really outrageous! After doing my homework for a long time, I chose the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Yalong Bay (it is estimated that the hotel funds are used for marketing) in time for the two rooms 4870 before the peak season of the summer vacation. It was originally booked for three nights. hurry up and run! First of all, it was almost two o'clock when we arrived at the hotel, and we were told that the room was not coming out. We took a leisurely stroll in the hotel's Chinese restaurant and found the front desk at three o'clock after eating. After walking around for a long time, I came to the room. There was a smell of refurbishment of paint. The room facilities were outdated and low-level. The door locks and bathroom doors were like a tooling room. Forget it, the elderly and children are already very tired and sleepy, and can barely stay. The other room was urged countless times to say that it was doing hygiene, and later, under the coordination of Ctrip staff, a room was temporarily vacated next door. The hotel has no service at all. If you want something, the phone will be broken before you come! I went to have breakfast at ten in the morning. There were cigarette butts all over the corridor, and the garbage bags at the door of the customer service were smelly. The restaurant seems to have everything for breakfast, but there are few things to eat. What kind of powder is the juice made from, and the ingredients are the best The bad fool, hurry up and check out and leave. The hotel claimed that the manager called to apologize and sent us to the next hotel. As a result, I asked the front desk to play a ball and asked the concierge. The concierge said that there is no such service, forget it. Take a taxi by yourself and let's go! Worst hotel I've stayed in on this trip! The experience is very poor, whoever lives will be fooled!

The housekeeper Samuel will contact you on the day of check-in and ask if you need to book a restaurant or hotel event, and answer the questions carefully and in detail.
If the only thing that is a bit unsatisfactory is that the children's playground is too small, and it would be better if there were indoor children's playgrounds and swimming pools with a constant temperature.

msg:Four years ago, my wife brought her daughter, who was less than one year old, to the seaside restaurant of the Ritz-Carlton, Yalong Bay to enjoy a gluttonous meal. She was immediately planted by Ritz‚Äôs picturesque environment and impeccable service!
       Four years later, I went to Sanya to participate in a two-day conference. After work, after a detailed comparison of the Haitang Bay and Yalong Bay hotel groups, I finally booked two Ritz mangrove-view double rooms with a family. Come for a nice weekend. From the moment I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised! Next, let's focus on the unanimous feelings of the whole family!
      First of all, the biggest surprise came from the room type upgrade: the front desk staff used the most comfortable way of communication (knowing that we are staying at Ritz for the first time, in order to give us the best experience in Ritz, help us upgrade the room type) We upgraded from the most basic mangrove-view double room to the Lichige pool double room for free (this is the most satisfactory place for our stay).
       Secondly, during our stay, every staff member we met made us feel at home: warm and generous, patient and meticulous, considerate! Here, I would like to especially thank the two young ladies: Anna (Zhang Hao), the housekeeper, who took us to the room personally, and introduced the hotel layout and related facilities in detail on the way. After adding WeChat, I asked for help several times and gave timely and satisfactory answers. And deal with! The other is the sister of Orange in the children's playground. She brought her 5-year-old daughter a great playing experience. She also wrote cards and gave gifts very carefully. The daughter is very happy!
       Finally, there is one more detail that must be liked: After communication, we helped us delay the check-out of one of the rooms until two o‚Äôclock. This is very important. For a family holiday, the check-out time at 12 o‚Äôclock is really too tight!
       As for some other service details, I won't praise them one by one. In short, the service is impeccable! If you have to make some comments and suggestions, there are three points: 1. The opening time is a bit long, and the individual hardware facilities are slightly old (such as the door and shower facilities); 2. Compared with other luxury hotels, the breakfast types are slightly less A little bit, not too exquisite; 3. The signs are not clear enough (on the night of check-in, I went to the gym for a run and went around. It took ten minutes to find the gym). Didn‚Äôt have fun running, Yalong Bay swept 22 kilometers in the morning üòú
       PS: Some of the photos were taken when the family was dining at a beach restaurant four years ago!

When the car arrived at the door, three service staff approached. One of the young ladies trot up to prepare to open the door. She immediately felt the enthusiasm of the service staff and attention to the residents. After checking in, Little Angel Cathy's service is very professional, even if she is wearing a mask, I can feel her smile very warm. Take us to the room and patiently introduce the facilities, supporting facilities and various services along the way. We proactively greeted and asked about needs every day through WeChat, helped with restaurant reservations, nucleic acid testing, etc.; we made an appoin**ent to drop off, pinched time to go downstairs, went into the corridor in front of the lobby and saw her approaching, said that we were ready to remind us of the time, and then helped take it Luggage, we prepared farewell gifts, lion cubs and biscuits, took a group photo for us, and took a few more pictures very carefully. The overall quality of the hotel staff is good. During the stay in the hotel, I will greet the guests proactively; when I see you looking for it, I will come forward and ask if I need service; during BBQ, I feel a bit cold at night and just put on my coat, some service staff will come forward and ask if I need to add a blanket; The small cards hand-painted by Vivian in the garden are very careful, which makes people feel good; Liu Jiaqi from the breakfast restaurant actively asked about service needs and introduced the restaurant‚Äôs special dishes enthusiastically. The hot and sour noodles are really delicious! The etiquette of the drop-off driver is decent, the car is tidy, and the smell is fresh and soothing. The service of Sanya Ritz is worth coming again!

But I have to say that the hotel's service after the emergency occurred. On the third day of check-in, we left the room to go to the Chinese restaurant for lunch. During the period, the waiter went to the room to get the dry-cleaned clothes. When we finished the meal and returned to the room, the door of the room could not be opened. We called the staff on the same floor and they could not open it, so we notified the engineering staff. We were holding a one-year-old baby, and the child fell asleep. The engineering staff said that there was a problem with the chip and it could not be opened for a while. For more than half an hour, no staff member told us how to solve it temporarily. I took the initiative to ask to help us open a new room temporarily for the baby to rest and the adults to rest. I am still pregnant. After the lunch break, it was nearly 2 hours, and no staff member contacted us to ask if we needed anything for emergency, because all the baby's milk, diapers, etc., and our adult things were all locked in the room. Later, we went downstairs to check twice, but they said it couldn't be opened. When the child woke up, he was crying because he was hungry. We asked the kitchen to make some soft noodles to see if the child could eat. At this point, the service gap was too big, and there was no consideration for the needs and mood of the customers. The door lock was an accident, but it was still surprising that such a large hotel handled the emergency in this way.

msg:I have lived in Ritz in major cities so far. I think this is the one that does not meet the Ritz standard. I can feel the strong ancient palace style. The staff are more enthusiastic, but after two days of staying, it gives me the overall It feels that the facilities are old. I booked the pool room. Various problems. The curtain switch is broken. The night light switch is broken. The USB charging port is broken. Seeing a lot of white flocs, the experience of staying in is not up to the standard of this brand. The service staff is quite enthusiastic, but apart from the restaurant, it‚Äôs hard to say warmth. It is estimated that the shower head of the room can be directly facing the door. The paint in the park‚Äôs landscape pools are all fallen leaves. The beach seems to be outsourced. Some people come to take pictures without the guest‚Äôs permission, and then sell them to confirm with the front desk twice during the stay. When I checked out, the bellman watched you carry your luggage and stood there, or the little lead girl next to you was really shocking. This shouldn‚Äôt be the quality that Ritz-Carlton should have, I‚Äôm just Checking in is really an experience, I hope it has been improved. I did move my compassion. I thought I was moved by the sincere apology. I wanted to change the bad review, but even more disgusting things happened in the follow-up. I don‚Äôt want to write a detailed sentence, huh, express my feelings.
Yalong Bay is indeed an older bay. The sand is finer than Haitang Bay. The waves are calmer. I have been in Haitang Bay before. This time I wanted to come to experience the beaches of Xialong Bay. I didn‚Äôt expect my favorite hotel to be so unsatisfactory.

The hotel service staff are very helpful and friendly. The baby wrestled and scratched Pi Lima. Two staff members came to help. Thank you very much.

msg:I booked a pool villa for three nights. The housekeeper Joanna called from the day before I checked into the hotel and asked what I need to prepare in the room in advance, what time of the flight, and whether I need to pick up the airport. The room I booked includes one pick-up Or drop off the airport, I took the child alone and chose to pick up the airport in order to save trouble. Because I used to call Sanya to find someone to book a car on the platform, it was too troublesome. This time the hotel arranged a BMW car to pick up and the driver even went to the exit to help pull my luggage and take me to the car! After arriving at the hotel and getting off the bus, Joanna was waiting at the door. After taking a photo at the front desk, she took her to the room to check in, and gave a clear introduction to the facilities, equipment, activities, etc.! Every morning, I will also ask me what arrangements I have for the day, and give suggestions, and help to book meals and seats. In short, if one person takes the baby to the Ritz-Carlton, there is no need to worry about it, the housekeeper is all about it! Asked if there was any sand dredging tool, Joanna directly gave a new set, but unfortunately, in the end, she didn't take it away to reduce the burden...Three days of itinerary, what you want to eat, what you want to play, tell the housekeeper, she will give advice and not bother! Awesome! The staff in the restaurant are also great. They will take the initiative to take care of me when I go to pick up the meal and leave the children alone, chat with her, and walk away silently when I see me coming. Although the details are small, it can be reflected. The Ritz-Carlton has put a lot of effort into employee service!
Room service will deliver fresh fruits every day. It is almost different every day. My child and I had a small amount of food. There were too many fruits to be eaten. At the end, a large plate was piled up before leaving!
The room attendant also used children's toys as a theme to stack two rabbits, and the children were too happy to take them apart.
The staff who led the parent-child activities were kind and enthusiastic. They were loved by the children. One day they took coconut picking. Only my child and I participated. The staff picked 3 for both of us, spoo
Finally, let me talk about some shortcomings: 1. The comb in the room is too low, is it almost serious like a comb in a small hotel?
2. It has been November. Although it is still very hot during the day, the swimming pool in the room is not at a constant temperature. You can't get water in the morning and at night. In the afternoon, you have to test your endurance. The public swimming pool is only slightly warmer than the water at the restaurant. Point, other nights will not work, the water is too hot in the afternoon, it is recommended to use the constant temperature swimming pool according to the body temperature, especially if you think about children;
3. The beach is still very delicate, but a bit narrow
I lived on a 3-day vacation, and I was taken care of meticulously. Thanks to the staff of Ritz-Carlton for their help and care!
Have a chance to come again next year!

He gave me very carefully from the first day I checked in. I explained and added WeChat, so that I can find her whenever I have something, and I will ask what help I need every day. Next, let‚Äôs talk about the advantages and disadvantages of Ritz:
Advantages: The service is the best hotel I have stayed in Hainan. The location is very good. The hotels near the beach in Yalong Bay are very good. The restaurant is very good. The hotel is also relatively large. The rooms are also very large. The heated swimming pool can be used in winter, and there are service staff.
Disadvantages: the decoration is a little old
Summary: Yalong Bay is really the YYDS of China's commercial beaches, and Ritz‚Äôs service should be the best in Yalong Bay. Next time I will choose Ritz-Carlton.

The Mandarin Oriental where I lived before spikes, whether it is location, view, room, breakfast, and service.
Lawrence, the duty manager of Sanya Ritz, is a very warm and sunny little brother, and he is highly praised! It can be said to be the best manager on duty in all the hotels I have ever stayed in~Because I liked Sanya Ritz very much before staying, I also booked this trip for my parents. I am embarrassed to take care of my parents by Lawrence. Anyway. I'm absolutely relieved
The a**osphere of Ritz‚Äôs whole scene is also very good. Once you enter, you can feel the relaxed and comfortable vacation. Even waiting for the transfer, you can hear the humming of "please come to the end of the world". Before I checked into the car, I hung up a beautiful shell necklace.

This time I went, after the check-in, the guardian angel Aaron took care of him all the way, helped the children prepare toiletries, and gave him a gift for the little lion. All the needs in the hotel can be asked at any time. It is very convenient to answer any questions. The children‚Äôs playground here is very rich in arrangements, overwhelming, and the staff are very enthusiastic. Felt cloth art, coconut picking, crab catching, animal feeding, pottery... the kids have a lot of fun. The breakfast buffet is also praised. The freshly squeezed watermelon juice and banana smoothie are delicious, the bread pudding is a must, and I can really have two bowls of hot and sour beef noodles. In short, full praise, I will live here in Sanya in the future.

msg:What can I say, all five stars, the reputation of this kind of hotel is chain communication, we were recommended by friends and colleagues, and not long after we moved in, my wife said that we would recommend it to my sister...
In fact, the hotel is quite old, except for the many columns wrapped in solid wood panels in the lobby and corridors, because they are coated with almost absolutely uniform and glossy lacquer, the visual space of the whole layer looks very high-grade and texture, which is impressive. Profound, it also gives a lot of points to the hotel hardware, but the main body of the hotel was built in 2008, and there are still signs of aging in the details, such as water stains on the wall, peeling wood paint, rusty balcony wall lights, etc. After the experience, I am even more sure that the main difference between Ritz and most other five-star hotels lies in service. For example, the carrie of our customer depar**ent, the service is very friendly üëçüëçüëç, which is also the price and reputation The main reason for the gap, I guess their corporate culture is probably also gentle and kind, because the spontaneity, sincerity and peace of the staff responsive to the guests is definitely not created by chicken blood and P excellent training skills. The performance of employees under heavy pressure, even if the standards are in place, it is easy to expose various emotions. Either they are utilitarian or unwilling. Don‚Äôt bother me. You can feel it to some extent, just like You think that this person's facial features, eyes, ears, nose and mouth are all beautiful, but when put together, they are very ordinary, or even unsightly; and Ritz-Carlton is the one with good facial features and beautiful combination.

msg:After 10 AMANs, it has become more and more difficult for me to be pleased by luxury hotels. I did not expect that I would be impressed by Sanya Ritz, a hotel that has been in business for more than ten years. Compared to Capella and Addison, Ritz‚Äôs decoration is certainly not the most fashionable, but he is like an old gentleman, not only outdated, but also new. Bright hardware and floor furniture with few scratches indicate proper maintenance; bath towels and bathrobes are all soft and comfortable, with no signs of hardening. Before I checked in, the hotel contacted me on the phone for various needs from pick-up to layout; Master Lu who picked up the airport was very patient and introduced many local Sanya tips; after check-in, the butler Bailey was enthusiastic and professional and arranged the most according to my ideas. It is a suitable schedule for body and mind relaxation, especially for the rare C-position for afternoon tea and the sailing boat at dusk ‚õµÔ∏è. The breakfast room has no errors even when there are many people. The meal and coffee refills are very timely; the lobby bar and spa can help me think about it a bit more and arrange to call a car to take me back to the villa without me. Such high-standard service cannot be achieved by the enthusiasm of one or two people, but by the dedication of the entire operation team accumulated over the years. This kind of caring and decent service is very rare in China, and it can compete with amanjiwo overseas. I hope to be able to praise all the lovely staff who have taken care of me during my stay in time. I must believe that the highest level of service is delivered by professional and enthusiastic people. This is also the most touching part of the hotel. thank you all.

The only downside is that there are few activities for children. Many handicrafts in the park are charged. When we lived in Yanlord, there were activities for children every hour, and they were all free!

msg:On this trip to Ritz-Carlton, everything was perfect except for the room. Ctrip's package is too powerful. BOSS live broadcast is great üëç.
The impact of the epidemic this year is more serious than last year. There were many people in June last year, and it was still so prosperous when it came in October and December. However, this year's continuous epidemic has made Sanya seem to return to the passenger flow of 10 years ago.
Ritz is the preferred choice for global travel and will never be disappointed. Since the opening of this Sanya store, it must be punched in every year. Even if there is Park Hyatt, Capella, and magnificent, you still have to stay here for one night. Because before the epidemic, I have felt that it has been overloaded, there are too many people, and it feels like a tour group. It is not high-end at all, there are too many rich people, haha.

Although there was a typhoon this time, the child hasn't been out for a year, so why should I come here? Fortunately, the believer prayed that the typhoon would make a big turn.
Ritz's service is still so meticulous and moist. From the swimming pool, the restaurant, to the children's activities, I feel that care. The smiles and greetings of the staff are so heartfelt.
KIDS SET, which has been given since CHECK IN, has been it for 8 years. It is very kind and does not need to be changed. It must be a classic. It is from Singapore to New York to Bali to Shanghai to Hong Kong to Macau. There are stickers and paintings, so that children can check in without delay. But it may be an epidemic. There is no kids zone in Sanya, only this children's painting is left.
The food standard of the restaurant is still very high, whether it is the Italian restaurant, the Sand restaurant by the sea, and the Runyuan restaurant have maintained their consistent standards. And the price is higher than that of the urban area. After all, environment and service are also included in the price. The drinks and services in the lobby bar are still pleasant.
The only thing that makes people complain about is the room. First, it has to be far away. The children are tired every time and don't think about the children. Second, facing a wooden bridge, soaking in a private swimming pool feels like viewing. Animals; third, because facing the bridge, all the actions in the room are open, so the curtains must be closed and the sunshine in Sanya must be turned off. Is this still a vacation? ; Fourth, there is a passage next to it. Pedestrians can walk through the bushes to reach the courtyard. The mobile phone is placed on the table for fear of losing it at any time, and it is also afraid of someone coming in through doors and windows at night. In short, the room is very poor. This room may be provided by Ctrip, or it may be bullying me. I asked the hotel to change rooms, but unfortunately I waited a long time. This house should be sealed up or sold at a reduced price. Ctrip's package this time is the same as the price that Ritz sells on its own official account.
The guest relations housekeeper Anna beauty service is very attentive, delivered to the guest room, introduced the hotel and room facilities, and responded in time if there were any questions, and could help to book a car and restaurant, and notify in time if there are activities. This is the trea**ent only when living in a villa before. Thank you Anna. This is a pleasant surprise.

msg:üçÉEnvironment: A great value trip! Needless to say, the environment is natural, from the infinity pool to the super clean private beach, plus the off-season is basically a charter trea**ent. You can unscrupulously play in the water and sunbathe, take a nap and read a book on the beach by the pool. Tropical plants and coconut trees can be seen everywhere, there will be light music in the corridor, accompanied by the sound of the waves, it feels exciting to do yoga. Although there are not many exciting marine activities when playing in the sea, the beach and the sea are super clean, so you can swim with confidence, and children don‚Äôt have to worry.
üîîService: Enjoy super caring service as soon as you enter the lobby, welcome to get on and off the bus, and the doorman hangs up welcome gifts for us. There is also a personal butler, Eily Du Wanli, who provides various services 24 hours a day, and can help book shuttle buses to duty-free shops and exclusive hotel coupons. There are free sunscreens and tanning oils at the pool and beach, and free toys for different uses. The staff will come to take care of and deliver free fruits and water at any time, so don't be too considerate.
üçΩDining: The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is rich and delicious. Fresh coconuts and various tropical fruits are enough. The restaurant environment is also very good, and you can have a brunch in the less crowded season.
I experienced the set meal at the seaside restaurant at noon. I was worried about too much to eat (the breakfast buffet was too rich), but the portion was just a little bit more for two people, which might be more suitable for a family of three. However, the taste and ingredients are very good. The appetizers of green papaya and green mango, bread and fried cod are super delicious! !
In the evening, I went to the lobby bar for a drink. Although there is no live singing in the seaside restaurant, it is quiet and pleasant, suitable for a daze.
üöó Transportation: It takes about 40 minutes to take a taxi from Phoenix Airport. But to go to other places from the hotel can only take a taxi or consult the front desk specifically, because the hotel is on the mountain and the surrounding area is full of hotels, so there is nothing to go shopping nearby. It's about 7 kilometers away from the nearest Liupan Village, and it's quite convenient to take a taxi. There is a free shuttle bus to the duty-free shop, but you need to make a reservation one day in advance.
üè†Room: The sea view room is very good, you can see the sea from a distance, and there is a swimming pool in the hotel with your head down. There happened to be a coconut tree in front of our window, and we looked forward to the sunshine when we opened the curtains in the morning every day. The rooms are spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable, and not at all damp. The balcony can also sit and bask in the sun. The balcony on the 4th floor is shielded for privacy, and people on the other floors can be seen basking in the sun from the outside. The bathtub is also very clean. After playing in the water during the day and taking a bath at night, it is so enjoyable.
Overall: a perfect and unforgettable experience. During the short 5-day trip in Sanya, 4 days were spent in the hotel. Even so, I still feel more than enough. It is very suitable for a slow vacation where you just want to sunbathe in a daze to relieve stress, or a honeymoon trip for couples. It's so cool to be able to go to the sea during the off-peak period before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Looking forward to staying again next timeüèù

Breakfast is the most satisfying meal in Sanya. The variety is complete and the quality is good. The service is very good. The concierge service is of good quality. The only dissatisfaction is that the butler business is not very skilled and the response is not timely enough. There are also sun loungers by the pool, and there should be just as well on the beach.

msg:Every year, you will choose Ritz for your basic trip to Sanya. This year I have stayed at Park Hyatt, Mid-Levels Intercontinental and Ritz.
üíÅThe service of Ritz has always been the benchmark for domestic hotels in my heart. This time his performance can only be said to have no success...Compared with other hotels, Ritz is still the first, but compared with the past Ritz, the overall feeling is still Regressed!
üè†The room was specially designed for Retiro, but when I checked in, it said I was upgraded to Retiro? I don‚Äôt know how the order was confirmed. The room has been decorated as a whole, and the interior is more transparent and tidy, but at night the lights on the balcony are turned off uniformly. This design is really incredible!
In addition, the quality of this slippers must be given a bad review! Mr. 39 size, very compact to wear! Moreover, there is no elasticity visible in the material picture, and it feels that the chemical fiber composition is very high! I hope the hotel will investigate the procurement problem carefully!
However, Ritz will try to solve the above problems for the guests... After giving feedback to the duty manager Yumeng, he also tried his best to solve them as soon as possible!
But I still hope that the hotel management can solve the problem fundamentally!
üçΩRestaurant: The buffet dinner set by Ctrip, I only found out when I arrived at the hotel. It was determined that it was a communication problem between Ctrip and the hotel. I hope that the products that are not available will be removed as soon as possible, so as not to cause unnecessary trouble to the guests! Then, lunch and breakfast were enjoyed at the beach restaurant. There is a little brother named Xiao Zeng who should be an intern. I can see that although he is not very proficient, he works hard and is very attentive! I went to a seaside restaurant for lunch the next day. There may be fewer guests, and I feel that the overall service gap is very large. A waitress who should be a foreman is not in a particularly good mood and did not take the initiative to greet the guests (because Ritz‚Äôs overall service level is here, After everyone will greet politely, once there is such a stinky face, it will be particularly abrupt).
‚õµÔ∏èThere are sailing boats in the package. Make an appoin**ent in advance. The experience is very good. The little brother who operates the sailing boat is very enthusiastic. For travel photography, Ritz also sent it to in-store travel photography before. I remember it seemed to be two foreign photographers. The experience was great, but this time the travel package did not include a deposit! The deposit will be notified at the last appoin**ent time! In a word, if there is a requirement to indicate in advance, the behavior of the merchants after the request will cause a poor experience. The little brother who took pictures was pretty good. The final developed photos are also good! Going home to organize things, I found the little shell from the night bedüêö.

I have also stayed in many luxury brand hotels in Sanya before, but Ritz gives me the feeling that apart from the hardware and the unique landscape, the service is indeed the same as that of Ritz. The foundation for standing in Sanya in 2016, the housekeeper Yunnie contacted me to confirm the room needs before the trip. The various introductions and guidance on the day of check-in were very considerate. Every morning, he would send blessing messages to start a beautiful day. Basically everything in the sky is to find Yunnie directly, it is not too convenient~ and these days just in time for the beginning of the school season and the end of the epidemic, I was lucky to feel the inaccessible Sanya, which is described in three words: " Cool"! I hope I will have the opportunity to experience this kind of Sanya and this kind of Ritz in the future!

msg:The Ritz-Carlton is always a Ritz-Carlton and the service is absolutely nothing to talk about!
üöó Transportation: It is not expensive to take a taxi from the airport. It takes about 20 minutes to get there. However, there are many car rentals in Sanya. If you want to go out to play, it is recommended to rent a car and drive by yourself. There will be a free pick-up or drop-off in the administrative building where you live, you can choose by yourself.
üßπ Hygiene: For an old top hotel like The Ritz-Carlton, there is really nothing to be picky about hygiene, the rooms are clean and tidy, and all public restrooms and every toilet have disinfectant alcohol, which is really too week in the current environment arrive!
üçÉEnvironment: Classic and elegant decoration style, some people may find it less foreign, but the combination of the entire architectural style and the seaside of Yalong Bay is just right. The rooms on the first floor are surrounded by swimming pools, and there is an infinity swimming pool near the sea. The point is that they are all constant temperature! Even in Haitang Bay, where there are many luxury hotels, there are not many swimming pools with constant temperature systems that adults can swim in (except for children's swimming pools). Several restaurants in the hotel are also very good, and the ingredients can be cooked (provided that Ignore the price üòÇ)
üîîService: The Ritz-Carlton is already famous for its meticulous and thoughtful service, so there is no need to elaborate. But this time I really have to praise it again, because this time I went to Sanya to encounter a confirmed case, and the entire Sanya hospital was full of nucleic acid tests, but the Ritz-Carlton Hotel directly invited certified professional laboratory personnel to the hotel for the purpose of The guests provide free inspections (as long as they make an appoin**ent before 3:00 p.m. on the same day or provide information directly on the spot), it saves hotel guests the time to go to the hospital and is relatively safer. When I checked out, I was a little excited (because I was going home üòÇ) and left the room card in the room. After talking to the front desk, I said it didn't matter. Someone will pick it up. I can check out with peace of mind.
The hotel's SPA can also be regarded as one of the top ones in China. There are two major brands of facial care, Valmont and Swiss Perfection, and it is said that it is the second SPA shop in China (but most people don't know, also Basically I can't find it, maybe because a certain review doesn't have it or it's too expensive üòÇ) The body SPA is so good that I don't have friends. The latest agarwood body oil and the very popular singing bowl relax, the body and skin are really tender and much more tender. And I did sleep more deeply at night (of course only for my feelings, after all, this kind of experience depends on personal feelings üòÑ)
The last thing is, recently, those who want to go directly to the sea from the hotel may have to walk a little to the hotel next door. Now the government is maintaining the beach, and the Ritz-Carlton is the first to start maintenance, so it will take at least a few months. It will be open, but it is also convenient to go to the hotel next door. There are inter-connected passages inside the hotel to pass through, so there is no need to go around the main entrance üòÑ

msg:The expectations for staying at The Ritz-Carlton this time are very high. After all, it is a luxury brand of Marriott, but after the actual experience, there are still many unsatisfactory places:
1. Although I had confirmed the time to arrive at the hotel by calling me before departure, I also clearly stated that the time to arrive at the hotel was between 1-2 pm, and I also said that because the reservation was for two rooms, There are the elderly and children, I hope the two rooms are together, which is convenient for taking care of. At the same time, I also told that I hope to prepare the children's equipment in advance. The hotel service staff on the phone has a very good attitude. They said that they have recorded them one by one, and told that the time to arrive is also cleanable by those who have a room, and will not wait. But in fact, after I arrived at the hotel around 1:30, the 2 rooms were not cleaned.
2. Because we didn't have lunch, we went out of the hotel to eat. Before returning, we also specifically asked the service housekeeper if the room was cleaned, but we never received the housekeeper's message. After we arrived at the hotel at 3:30, we only came out of a room. At this time, the front desk said that the other room would be ready soon, and someone would be arranged to send us the room directly. We waited in the room for nearly an hour, but no one sent the room card, called the front desk, and the phone said that it will be cleaned soon! Are the words "soon" and "immediately" your idioms! Are you fooling your guests like that? At this time, we couldn't bear it anymore. It was nearly 4 hours since we arrived at the hotel, and it was almost 5 pm. We still didn't get the key card for the other room. It was really a waste of all afternoon waiting. One thing to say, I have come to Sanya so many times, and I have stayed in hotels in Yalong Bay and Haitang Bay. It is really the first time I have encountered such a long wait for a room card, and it is a luxury brand that claims to be characterized by good service. , really disappointed.
3. The housekeeper service basically can't solve the problem. Whether it is asking if the room is out, or the check-out time, etc., it will take a long time to reply. If it is a matter of urgency, I suggest you don't ask. Of course, the attitude of the service is still OK
4. When I came to the hotel, I found out that the beach is actually doing engineering! ! ! ! ! We found this when we were going to the beach with our children. The entire beach was blocked, and no one notified us when we checked in, and there was no notice or apology when we entered the room! ! ! ! ! So what's the point of our coming to this hotel? Isn't the hotel has its own beach area just to be able to play in the sand with two steps? ! I can't understand why this hotel doesn't remind you in advance, doesn't remind you when you check in, and doesn't have any compensation! ! ! ! ! ! ! Isn't this a lie! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5. The indoor children's paradise of the hotel is ridiculously small, and the things to play in it are very low. It is really unimaginable that a luxury hotel with a price of at least 2k a day for a room is so unbearable for children outside. The water facilities are also rudimentary. It is really the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Don't tell me, this is not a hotel featuring parent-child hotels, but your basic equipment must meet the standard~ It's really bad! ! ! ! ! ! !
6. I had high expectations for the breakfast at his house, but it actually looks like the breakfast at the Hilton next door, but the Hilton is only more than 1k a day! ! ! ! ! ! The juices are all canned, not freshly squeezed, this is what the breakfast waiter said...
7. The carton design of the spare parts is anti-human, and it is invincible and difficult to disassemble. Really the lowest spare design I have ever seen.
I wrote so many bad things. Of course, it is a luxury brand after all, and there are also good things. For example, the little guys who get on and off at the door are very good. They are in place every time. Service, this is the best service I have experienced in any hotel.
To sum up, in terms of service, the best place for me to live in Sanya is probably Fairmont Haitang Bay; in terms of cost performance, I still strongly recommend Yalong Bay Hilton. Ritz...I'm really disappointed, and I won't choose this brand again in the future.

Disadvantages: 1. The beach is under construction. You cannot go directly to the seaside and the beach from the hotel. You need to detour from other hotels. No notification was received before check-in.
2. I came to live from Park Hyatt Hotel and felt that the room facilities are quite different. The toilet is not automatic, and the disposable items are not easy to use. For example, toothbrushes and combs are made of transparent plastic. It is also difficult to drain the bathtub.

The hotel was originally cancelled, but I thought about it maybe this time is less crowded and it is more suitable for parent-child travel. I also believe that the Ritz-Carlton will do a good job in epidemic prevention and control, so I booked it again. The facts proved that my choice was not wrong. The Ritz team Sam, Hang, Nancy, Lily, Anna, everyone was very careful, although one night because of the unqualified residents next door, the power amplifier at one in the morning affected the mood of rest and vacation. However, the Ritz team responded promptly. In the last two nights, they also upgraded the two-bedroom villa with sea view with a small swimming pool for free. There was a shuttle bus when they went out, and they gave away the passion fruit, dragon fruit, and lion photo frame that the child loved. Although I often stay in National Five Hotels, I can say that this kind of VIP service is difficult to enjoy in other hotels. When checking out, Anna also prepared a small gift for the child, which the child would hold when he went home to sleep. This trip can be said to be a perfect choice. Thanks again to the Ritz team!

The hotel arranged for the guests, the little angel Yunnie patiently introduced us to the hotel‚Äôs facility layout, and reminded us of the breakfast time and the comfort of staying from time to time. Intimate. The restaurant is really too expensive, you can adjust it a bit. There are also travel shots sent. Actually, the photos are not given to the electronic version.

msg:It is the first time to take a three-year-old baby and parents to Sanya for a long-distance trip in a nearly three-hour flight. The choice of the Ritz-Carlton is very correct! I chose a villa with a sea view. The independent swimming pool outside the house allows the baby to swim without thinking, and clamoring to swim in the water all day long. The view of the room is also superb, and the sea view can be unobstructed in the house! The better point of the hotel lies in its service. The villa housekeeper is responsive. Our housekeeper JOANNA not only arranged for us various in-hotel activities. On the day of check-out, since our return flight was in the evening, she also thoughtfully prepared a lounge and delivery service for us. Machine service and gave us many local specialties. Since we bring the baby and the elderly at the same time, we do not go out to eat every meal. The butler will also carefully deliver our ordered takeaway from the concierge at the front desk to our room. This service has brought us great convenience. In addition, I have to say that the breakfast here is really rich and delicious. The baby is not heavy every day. It is fine to change several flavors. The little guy has a big appetite. I also highly recommend the hot and sour beef noodles and cream scrambled eggs. ! During our stay, we also watched a sea view wedding in the hotel, and the lovely baby gave her the highest evaluation: I don‚Äôt want to go home, I want to continue to live here and be a bride here!

I would like to thank the aunt Yuan Cuiye who stayed in the room for 3 nights. I remember that she left this name on the small card for me. People are very hardworking. Every time I see them, they will greet them warmly. There are service visits every time. Every time they are sweaty and sweaty. The price of afternoon tea in the hotel lobby is reasonable.

msg:Because the epidemic has not been out for a long time, I look forward to this trip to Sanya. Liz deserves to be famous for its service. The reserved executive room. The room was a bit remote at first and the floor was low. I revealed that I wanted a higher-level room. The butler immediately arranged to have a look at both rooms. Until I was satisfied, the attitude was very good. The view of the hotel is very good. Although there is no decent beach, it does not affect the mood of the holiday, because he has a lot of swimming pools, and there are beaches and swimming pools. The service is very good, with unlimited ice mineral water and bath towels. In fact, what moved me the most during this trip was the cancellation of the typhoon flight. The manager of the executive lounge, Han Ya, was patient and smiled so that I don‚Äôt have to worry about it, because it was postponed for a day and I continued to stay in the original room. Let us continue breakfast for a family of three, so that I don‚Äôt have to worry about it. I will continue to reserve my room according to my flight. This makes me very anxious because of the non-stop flight cancellation. I feel like my family and have empathy. Thumbs up for the managers, butlers, and waiters of the entire executive floor. Chestnut's service is well-deserved! And the BBQ on the beach is great, and the butler Kate also reserved a good spot for me!

Finally, check out until 14:30, so that we don‚Äôt have to wait at the airport if the flight is delayed. Travel shooting is also good, with 50+ films per hour, high quality, high efficiency, and good price/performance ratio. Next time I come to Sanya, I will consider staying at Ritz. There is a small suggestion that the butler service can be contacted the day before the guest check-in instead of after the check-in (refer to Atlantis), so that you can know the guest's specific check-in time and room requirements in time, so as to advance in advance Arrange the rooms to avoid waiting for the room.

msg:A few months ago, the group bought a package with airport transfer and a dinner and hotel accommodation, the Litian Pavilion room type. The dinner delivered can be Runyuan or the seaside restaurant, we chose the seaside restaurant.
The pick-up is booked in advance, and the hotel concierge will reconfirm it one day in advance. The pick-up master will send a text message on the same day, holding a small sign with my name, you can see it at a glance~ The business car is very comfortable. After all, Sanya is really too hot during the day Spicy is much better than taking a taxi. When you get off the bus to the hotel, the master will give you a luggage tag, and the luggage will be sent to the room by the staff directly according to the check-in information. Check in is also very fast, and there are also drinks and tropical necklaces instantly. Have a sense of vacation. The size of the hotel is not small, taking away the style of combining Southeast Asia and Chinese. Although the Sanya Ritz has been opened for quite some time, some details are worn out, but the overall a**osphere style and design, including garden design and swimming pool layout, are still Very good. Our room is on the 4th floor. The view of the sea is slightly blocked by coconut trees, but the view is also good. Fruits are welcome in the room, and there are enough bottled water pipes. Hahaha, the cloakroom is also quite spacious. The little skirt that I brought me Hang up all~ Change clothes and go out for adventure~ The sun is really dry during the day, so it is best to go to the beach or the pool at four or five. There is an infinity pool facing the sea, so you must have a wave hahaha. There are not many people on the beach. Although it is connected to the beach next to it and there is no hard partition, almost no foreign visitors will come.
After having fun on the beach, you can have dinner. Xianfang is recommended. The seaside barbecue buffet is really worth having. Remember to make an appoin**ent in advance. For a detailed review here, please see the Xianfang page.
The breakfast is also very good and there are too many varieties. I haven't seen so many varieties in China so far. I must eat the hot and sour beef noodles. The Vietnamese beef noodles are more sour and the spiciness has been improved. The clear soup base is delicious~ I ate for a few days after staying for a few days~ You can try various other varieties, as well as coconut water and fresh coconut meat~ The bread and cakes taste great too. I don‚Äôt eat these very much, but I tried it. I can‚Äôt stop after a gluten-free cake, and the Liz Bakery is online.
The most worth mentioning is Liz‚Äôs service~ it‚Äôs great everywhere. The lady who cleans the room helped me arrange my toiletries neatly~ I will add used items and linen every day when I open the night room~ There is also sunscreen provided in the swimming pool~ too necessary! ! ! The cafeteria is super fast, and I often ask if I need to add drinks~ In short, all the staff will greet you~ all day~ enthusiastic~ I asked for a latex pillow because the cervical spine is not good~ the pillow will arrive soon~ The return flight will also be well confirmed~ The chef of the seaside restaurant will come to ask you for your dining opinions~ Anyway, you can feel that they value and like their guests~ So enjoy Liz's vacation time~

Because the room has not been cleaned, we need to wait. Xiaohou arranged for us to go to the lobby bar to rest. Please have afternoon tea, although the lobby is a bit stuffy, but the service is so considerate to cool down a lot.

Fortunately, the housekeeper Xiaohou is very dedicated and works overtime at night to help us solve the problem and promise to help us change the room as soon as possible the next day Sure enough, I was upgraded to a sea-view room the next day, with beautiful sea views, sea breeze, and air-conditioning. What kind of fairy summer is this?
        Two pieces of clothes can be delivered for free every day, which is very convenient.
        Room service, on call, smiling service.
       The breakfast is ordered, the quality is in place, and the presentation is exquisite. The best thing is that the ingredients are healthy, which reflects the light food concept in modern diet, such as oa**eal, gluten-free bread, hot spring eggs, and even overnight oats. I would like to praise the little brothers and sisters in the restaurant. The chaos is orderly and the service is in place. The most comfortable service for me is not arrogant or impetuous, not hurried or slow, smiling in response, not overly indifferent, and not overly enthusiastic.
       Although the price of the villa is slightly higher, I feel that it is value for money, even super value for money. I think a good experience is not only a high-end accommodation environment, but also a good and sincere service. I feel this in Ritz . Be patient, meticulous, solve problems in a timely manner, and respond politely to guests' requests. This is the embodiment of quality, worthy of the name of a luxury hotel.

msg:The hotel has a good location, 40 minutes drive from the airport, 5 minutes drive from Baihuagu commercial center, 15 minutes walk from Dongrong Seafood Plaza.
The hotel can park on both sides of the entrance door. The underground parking lot is relatively small, with 20 or 30 parking spaces. There is also a small parking lot near the lobby but it can only park about ten cars.
The hotel staff are more polite. When welcoming guests in the lobby, they will send a chain made of shells. After the check-in, they will also send guests to the room. However, it is quite far away and it takes seven or eight minutes to walk.
The Ritz sea view room booked is on the 4th floor, so the balcony view is not good, and it seems that the sea is far away. The facilities are ok, but the drinks in the refrigerator are not free, which is rather surprising. There is a lot of mineral water. Although the toilet is separated from wet and dry, it seems cramped. Comes with new sandals, which are not bad. You don‚Äôt need to wear your own slippers. The bath towels are shed, and the body is covered with cotton when wiped, very speechless. There are relatively few TV programs, nothing good to watch, and can‚Äôt be cast. There is a problem with the room‚Äôs lock. Every time I swipe the card, I can‚Äôt open it after turning the handle halfway. It may be aging.
There are more swimming pools in the hotel, there are children only, more suitable for children. But most swimming pools have children and swimming rings. There is also a beach volleyball court across the pool, with beach chairs next to it, and down the stairs to the beach, the scenery is not bad.
The lobby is on the 3rd floor, and the breakfast is on the 1st floor. It is open from 7 am to 11 pm. After 9 pm, there is a high probability that you will need to queue up. The seats are still relatively small and the venue is not big enough. The variety is not rich, it's quite satisfactory. The breakfast at Westin Wanning is a little bit more variety. Fortunately, the taste is okay. However, there are a lot of children, and adults basically don't look at it. It feels messy.
The hotel has a self-service barbecue in the evening, near the beach, and there is also a band, but the 4 days we stayed have been booked.
Generally speaking, the cost performance is not high during the summer vacation, the experience is average, there are many children, and it is busy and noisy.

Disadvantages: 1. I told the front desk that it was a wedding anniversary, but I didn‚Äôt upgrade it, which is a bit regrettable.
2. The room booked at Lihai Pavilion was only given to the 4th floor. There was no sea view at all, because the tree was too high and the view was completely blocked.
3. The fruit in the room has not been added (I don't know if there is this service) because I read other people's previous comments and say that I add fruit every day. Of course, this is not very important.

Advantages: 1. The booked package has a free airport shuttle service. The pick-up is BMW and the drop-off is Mercedes-Benz. The cars are super clean and the driver is very good.
2. The breakfast is very rich, basically everything you want.
3. The most important one‚Äº Ô∏èThe hotel will have a one-to-one service with a butler. Our little butler is sister Kamilla Luo Minxin. She is super gentle and sweet. If you add WeChat, you will ask her if you have anything. She will take care of it. We are the class at night. Going home, thinking about late check-out, sister Kamilla Luo Minxin also helped solve it. Thank you so much.
I will go to Sanya again in the summer vacation next year, and then go to Ritz, next time I will book the Lichi Pavilion, because it is very convenient for swimmers to go into the water.

At first he said that there were only paper bags and only some easy-to-handle ones, so I randomly chose two plates of bread boxes, small buns and the like, and a plate of cut fruits, thinking about taking it away by myself, but Mr. Wang I have repeatedly persuaded not to take the fruit like this. The weather is hot and it will be broken. I will cut a plate again and send it to your room. I repeatedly said that there is no need to use it, just that, otherwise it was wasted. I took it away and said that there would be a staff member who would send it to the room in a while, and also asked me if there was anything else I wanted to eat. I said that there was a rib that was particularly delicious, and Mr. Wang immediately understood. I waited in the room for two minutes, and then a staff member came up and sealed all the pieces I just took with plastic wrap, a large neatly arranged fruit, and a large bowl of the ribs I was talking about. After the service is here, I really feel the care for the guests. Next time I have a chance, I will stay at Ritz.
The hygiene is very good. I clean it twice a day and have a good night gift. I also met a cleaning lady who also had the same obsessive-compulsive disorder. She neatly arranged the stones and shells I picked up from the beach. It would be very healed when I saw it. The room has always been super cool, and we screamed every time we walked in. The children‚Äôs room supplies are also very complete, the scenery is super good, and the swimming pool is also very large

msg:I brought the children to Ritz this time. I was very satisfied with the stay. The baby liked the summer camp activities. The room on the executive floor was booked. The service was very good and the food was very good. The bar was too crowded. The air conditioner is also very hot and it is not suitable for sitting outdoors in summer, but there are too many people to be crowded outside. Compared with the time when I came five years ago, the lounge is not as emotional as it was then. Like restaurants, you have to queue for meals. I need to go to the lounge on a staggered peak.. Fortunately, the pleasant service reminds me that I booked an executive room, and everything was responded to at the first time. He arranged for me to take the child to the SPA and also booked a summer camp for me. , I don‚Äôt have to trouble myself, very caring! I am very satisfied. I hope that the lounge can be restored to its former tranquility and leisure. I will continue to live with my children. I like quietness! By the way, I also thank the technicians of the SPA center. After the child left, she sent the shell she liked specially, which was very touched! Everything is superb, super satisfying, but there are too many people in the lounge! Come on!

The park is very large and the management is very user-friendly. It is very convenient to pick up and drop off the airport and the battery car to and from the lobby. The most intimate thing is the butler service. Ocean is a handsome cook, and it is very reliable. He has helped us think about many things that we can't think of. thank. Will come next time.

msg:For the second time staying at Ritz in Yalong Bay, the first time staying was the second year after opening. I don‚Äôt feel that the facilities are outdated. After all, everyone likes different styles. If you like a cooler and newer hotel, please move to Haitang Bay. The Ritz is a typical Southeast Asian style, and all the facilities are more humane. This time, I stayed with my daughter for four nights. For a three-year-old child, the children‚Äôs center, children‚Äôs pool, and large swimming pool are enough to play, but the breakfast peak requires a lot of people to line up and it‚Äôs messy. If you don‚Äôt mind the heat, just go straight. There is no need to line up when sitting outside. In short, choosing Ritz always feels at ease, especially quiet, suitable for a leisurely family vacation ‚õ±Ô∏è

The hotel is a bit old, the better the room type, the better the room facilities are relatively new. The layout of the hotel is relatively easy to find. Downstairs is the swimming pool and children‚Äôs playground. The airport shuttle, seaside restaurant and travel shots are very user-friendly, because after staying at the Ritz-Carlton, I have to go to another house. The seamless docking took us to another, and the seaside restaurant had a rich set menu. Special thanks to April, our housekeeper, for helping us with extra beds and adding children‚Äôs fences. Every day, we will take the initiative to greet if we need it. This is better than several new hotels in Haitang Bay. The sea water in Yalong Bay is the best, and the Ritz-Carlton in Yalong Bay is also the most pleasing. I will choose to live here in the future.

In theory, there are only 2 parent-child families in Sanya that can reach this level. 1. Jinmao Ritz-Carlton 2. xxxxxx (guess yourself, the number of words is enough). Cecilia responded promptly, almost responsive, basically responding all the time. Fruits in the room and meals are available 24 hours a day. The row rooms are also more private, but if the guest rooms are not full, they will try to adjust the privacy as much as possible. Give a thumbs up. Come again in the Spring Festival.

The Ritz-Carlton‚Äôs breakfast has a wide variety of delicious flavors, and the Italian restaurant tastes great. The baby finally lost his first baby tooth while eating. The staff was very enthusiastic. They took ice towels and masks to her, especially I especially praised Miss April Zhou Nan who is a hotel guest. The baby‚Äôs swimming ring was left at the front desk when I checked in. She patiently helped me find it and sent it back to the room. She also patiently helped us with certain children‚Äôs activities. , Booked the lunch at the Italian restaurant in advance, and also arranged the drop-off for us, making our journey perfect! There are too many charged items in the children's playground of the hotel. The bathtub in the room leaked, which caused me to leak out of a jar of water without soaking for a while. It was a little flawed.

You can feel the courtyard style of Chinese architecture when you get off the car. We also upgraded to the seventh floor for free. That is, the most beautiful floor, the higher the price, the better the landscape. The breakfast is very rich and can be eaten until 11 o'clock. Usually we go after 9:30 and eat all-you-can-eat at noon. Serena who serves us is very thoughtful and responsive! Every morning and evening, we will ask how we need to wait. The hotel service is well done and the soundproofing effect is good. The environment is impeccable. The smell of the fragrance in the room should be my favorite place~~ Today I told my husband to wait until I have a baby and come back to the children‚Äôs playground. It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt experience it Hahaha Yalong Bay must live the first place is understandable! Thank you Ritz Carlton for bringing such perfect memories to my honeymoon.
