msg:This was by far one of the most gorgeous resorts I’ve ever stayed in. Every single design detail is well-thought of, with customer satisfaction in mind. The view is gorgeous, the walking/jogging trails are flawless, we were speechless. Everything very new and very clean. Staff is polite and always smiling. Truly 5 star. The only downside is that it is 1-2 hr away from attractions & train stations.

At new years eve we came back home at 1am and there was nobody at reception desk anymore and we had to walk 1,5 Kilometer to our room. 

Breakfast room was really cold and we had to wear a winter jacked.

It has complete equipment and reasonable divisions. It also provides towels and bottled water for guests to use. The external environment is very good and large. It is a good place for us to vacation. The service is also very thoughtful. The park is very large, so there are special electric cars to pick up and drop off guests in the area. In short, it is better to live in it. I will stay here again next time. As a resort hotel, if possible, it is better to have one or two table tennis rooms that do not occupy a large area. There is a quiet environment for sports, rest, walking, etc., which can attract everyone to come and stay for a long time.

The artificial lake covers an area of ​​several thousand acres. It is located in the suburbs of Guilin, with few people. There are mountains and water, and the view is wide. The wind is very comfortable. Opposite the lake is Sunac Songpin, a paradise created by Chinese garden landscape. Staying for 2 days is a leisurely life. It is recommended to bring a family with children to relax, and you can also exercise easily. The gym has many equipment and is open 24 hours.

msg:We are a family of four who traveled during the May Day holiday. We chose a lake view room. Two 1.2-meter beds are enough for four people to sleep. The room is very large, the scenery is really beautiful, very close to the lake, it is really cool at night, the floor-to-ceiling windows have screens, there are so many mosquitoes, we dare not open the windows. We came to play during the May Day holiday, it was a bit cool, and it felt a bit cold standing on the balcony at night, so we had to wear long sleeves.
Simply put, we checked in at the end of April, not during the May Day holiday, so the room rate was relatively not expensive, 700-800 per night, and 1,500 yuan per night on the May Day holiday. We drove here by ourselves on our own, and the location of this hotel is really remote. It is recommended to drive or rent a car. Guilin North Station-Hotel, 47 kilometers away, 54 minutes by car, you can imagine how far it is. Since the hotel is built in a place with mountains and water, the geographical location feels like it is next to the mountain. The hotel is very large, and the hotel entrance is quite far from the building where you stay. You must take the hotel car to get there, or drive in by yourself. It is all the scenery of the hotel. It feels beautiful and comfortable to drive around the hotel all the way. We checked in at night and drove in. There was only one registration attendant at the front desk and a little brother who helped with the luggage. No one else. The whole hotel was empty. We checked in on the 29th. There were almost no people staying in the hotel. We didn't see other guests in the hotel. It was very quiet.
The hotel is divided into two areas, ordinary floor hotel rooms and villa area (Guilin Yanshan Songpin Hotel). Both hotels are in this place. It is recommended not to stay in the villa area because there is no lake view, but the garden is not beautiful and the price is very expensive.

Hotel advantages: The hotel environment is five-star, the scenery is really beautiful (take some pictures), if you want to truly experience the mountains and waters of Guilin, you will not regret staying in this hotel. When my baby left, he was very reluctant. The reflection of the mountain in the water is like a picture! The hotel provides a small number of bicycles for three people and two people, so that you can ride bicycles and take pictures in the hotel. (It seems that a three-person bicycle is 98 yuan/hour), check-in also sends the next-door underwater viewing/mobile game park (choose one), and sends three professional photos (with clothing selection). The hotel has Chinese and Western food, both of which are very expensive (tofu is 108 yuan per plate, you can roughly estimate it), and there are also meals delivered to the room (not expensive, 70 yuan per person), the taste is good. It is recommended to choose a hotel with breakfast, not that the breakfast is delicious (because there are no food stores near the hotel). The hotel has complete washing supplies, toothpaste, towels and shower gel. There is a clothes drying rack on the balcony (very considerate), but no hangers. The hotel has to pay for laundry.

Disadvantages of the hotel: If it is not a holiday, there should be few people staying in the hotel, it is empty. There is a swimming pool indoors, but it is not open. It will be open during the May Day holiday (starting from May 1st). There is a small children's playground (that is, the wave pool). It is free to stay and play during normal times, but it will be charged during the May Day holiday (27 yuan per time). During the May Day holiday, you can set off fireworks, which are all hotel activities, and you can also set off water lanterns on the lake. These are activities that are only available during the short holidays. If you go there on weekdays, you really just sleep and look at the scenery. There are no leisure facilities for you. There is only a gym for you to use, and nothing else. Next to the Sunac Amusement Park and Underwater Park, don't have too much fantasy, it's just a very small park, there's nothing fun. If you bring your kids, you must go to the park at 10 am when it opens, and there are basically no entertainment activities in the afternoon. There are almost no food shops near the hotel, don't think about ordering takeout, takeout is very unpalatable and not clean. If you want to eat, you can drive directly to Yangshuo for about 40 minutes to eat. It's best to check in advance for eating in Yangshuo, or check Dazong reviews before choosing. It is recommended to bring some snacks and instant noodles.

In short, if you want to leisurely enjoy the scenery, this hotel is very good, just pure rest and sleep, and then you have to bear with the food and entertainment. If you are traveling to visit attractions, it is recommended to stay in the attractions or the East and West Lanes, so that it is convenient to eat and walk, and it is also close to the attractions. This hotel is really far from the attractions. It's better for you to drive, and it's difficult to take a taxi.
The above is my personal experience, I hope it can help tourists who want to stay.

msg:I didn't want to go out of the province and squeeze in with people on March 3rd, so I chose to take my family out for a trip in the province. I stayed in a homestay in Yangshuo on the first day, and it felt so-so. On the second day, I changed to Sunac Hotel for my children to play. When I arrived at the hotel at 11 o'clock in the morning, many people were already queuing for the shuttle bus, but the staff at the door arranged it in an orderly manner. The beautiful Huang Ying at the front desk saw that I was with my children and upgraded me to a suite for free. It was amazing after entering the room! The hotel facilities are very new, and the bathrooms are all ToTo. The window faces the Songpin Hotel group and a lake opposite. There are tourists playing kayaks on the lake. There are two or three people on the trail downstairs. Bicycles are playing in the hotel scenic area. We played in the hotel scenic area for a whole day, and it feels a little more playable than the park. The dinner buffet and breakfast buffet have been well received by my family. The dishes are of high quality, the dishes are replenished very quickly, and the attitude of the staff is also very good (compared to the city. Much better). Next time there is a small holiday or weekend, I will choose this hotel again. I love it so much!

2. I was lucky to upgrade to a family suite. The room was large and clean. The most important thing was that the scenery of the hotel was very good, which was very suitable for the elderly and children to stay.
3. The room fee can be used for free 2 hours of cycling, cycling around the park. It's a pity that the indoor entertainment room for children was upgraded this time.
4. The breakfast time is very humane, with many breakfast varieties, but the taste is average.

They clearly didn't have that much reception capacity, and the waiter at the door only charged. After entering, we found that there were no seats. We asked the restaurant manager, and he replied that there were no seats for the time being. No solution was given. (Why didn't we change restaurants: because it was raining heavily at that time, and the surroundings were very remote) Then we finally waited for others to vacate their seats, and it was all up to luck to get the dishes. There was nothing to get. In the end, our family of three spent more than 600 yuan and ate in vain, relying on some hard pizza to fill our stomachs.

Although it is not a five-star brand, the bedding and towels are of high quality, and the paintings on the wall are also very unique, which makes people's eyes shine. The service is at home.

First of all, the hotel area has beautiful views all the way, it is quiet and peaceful, the room is large, the windows inside are bright and clean, the facilities are well maintained, and the facilities are complete.

Second is the service, which is really meticulous and considerate. When you arrive, a handsome guy enthusiastically helps you open the door and pick up your luggage. The beautiful girl at the front desk patiently guides you during the check-in process. The service in the restaurant is good and the quality of the product is high.

msg:The three of us settled in the hotel for the Sunac brand. This is our experience and feelings for three days and two nights.
Location and facilities: It is about an hour's drive from the city. To go to urban attractions or eat authentic dishes, you need to go back to the city. The hotel is located in Yanshan District and is worth walking around to appreciate, but it only takes an hour to walk through the entire hotel area.
Lobby reception service: The doorman is very polite and takes the initiative to say hello and help with luggage. The reception staff in the lobby are also very welcoming.
Restaurant service: There is still a lot of room for improvement in service awareness. First of all, the children of our three families are all over 1.2 meters tall, so breakfast requires extra money. Other five-star hotels we stayed in before will take the initiative to waive this fee, but here we will not take the initiative to waive it, and we will keep an eye on every guest for fear of missing something. One of them caused the hotel to suffer huge losses, and when signing for confirmation, the restaurant staff had a stiff attitude; secondly, the uncle who cooked the noodles had a black face and bad temper during the whole process of serving the meal. He did not release the cooked noodles for the guests or Hand it over, but almost throw it out to serve the meal. I have to lament here that these service concepts are still very different from those of old chain five-star hotels.
Room facilities and services: Our requests for services, such as an extra pair of slippers and extra bottles of water, were responded to very quickly. However, the heating effect in one of our rooms was not good. We proposed to change rooms or repairs, but they were rejected. In the end, we were sent two sets of oil heaters.
Supporting entertainment: When staying in the hotel, each room will receive two adult tickets for Happy Tribe or Sea World. Children need to purchase additional UU tickets. However, children's tickets cannot be purchased separately on the mini program. Only adult + child tickets are bundled, and tickets can only be purchased on-site. There were very few people in the off-season. There were only four or five people queuing at the ticket office, but it took a full 40 minutes. The reason is that there is only one ticket window open, and the conductor keeps promoting annual passes. Because one person operates it, the information of previous customers who bought annual passes is also slow to enter into the system, which wastes a lot of time. When it was our turn, we made it clear that we would only buy three children's tickets, and the conductor went out of his way to sell annual passes. Combined with the restaurant service staff's persistence in charging children's breakfast, we all feel that Sunac Sbergh Group puts monetary interests first.
To sum up, these personal experiences have greatly affected the stay experience. This feeling is profound, and from now on I will be skeptical of hotels in all places under the Sunac brand.

There is a charge for the children's playground in the hotel, but because we arrived at the hotel in a hurry, the children's playground only had half an hour of operating time left, so we applied to the front desk for a free half-hour of play time for two children. The front desk readily agreed, which made me feel warm. The parking lot is indeed far away as mentioned in the reviews, but there are staff stationed and guided along the way. In the evening, I had a buffet for 198 yuan per person, and the quality was not bad. It's a pity that the weather is not good and the scenery is not very good.

msg:The hotel is great! Although the location is relatively remote, some distance from Guilin and Yangshuo, the hotel environment is very good and all facilities are complete and high-end. I booked a parent-child room, but my child thought the room was a bit small. After communicating with Yao Yao at the front desk, I immediately found a way to upgrade the room type to a deluxe suite. The room is really incomparable. The living room is twice the size of an ordinary room, and the balcony is huge. It is 10 meters long, and the mountains and lakes are all in front of you. Yao Yao is very enthusiastic. He took the initiative to communicate on WeChat before checking in. During the few days he stayed, he recommended local specialties and helped solve various problems. The weather was not beautiful during the past few days. It rained every day and the temperature was only 4 or 5. In order to prevent us from getting cold, we made ginger tea in advance. When we got back to the room in the evening, ginger tea was also brought to us. It was really heart-warming and stomach-warming.
Another person who was very touched was the waiter Qin Mei, who left us messages every day during our stay and became pen pals with the children.
Although traveling to Guilin this season is the off-season of cold winter, I really feel like home in Shibaige. After playing outside for a day, I feel wet and cold. When I return to the warm room, drink warm ginger tea and enjoy the outdoor scenery. Beautiful scenery, extraordinary enjoyment.

This hotel is especially suitable for friends who are two or three hours away from Guilin for a weekend stay. They leave after get off work on Friday and can arrive before 10:00 pm. On Saturdays with children, you can spend a whole day at the nearby Sunac Water World (sometimes closed), Sunac Paradise, and Sunac Sea World. On Sunday, you can sleep in, take your children for a walk in the hotel, and paddle around. Take a boat and fly a kite. The Songpin side is wider and the grass is very nice. I don’t know if you can set up a tent (you can check with the hotel). If possible, you can bring your baby to set up a tent. Your child will like it very much. The balcony of the hotel's lake view room faces the lake, with a wide view. The room is relatively large and the quality of the toiletries is also very good. Some rooms have tea sets, but if not, you should ask the front desk for them, and you can make tea on the balcony. I didn't take any pictures of the room, but it looks good overall.

Everywhere you take a photo while walking is a blockbuster. However, I think the wave pool should be open to the public, and it is unreasonable to give 58. Fortunately, our baby played for 4 days, and the wave pool is not a loss. There is a battery car in the hotel that goes to the amu*****t park every hour, which is very convenient. When traveling, you have to choose a non-holiday time, so there are no crowds. It takes tens of thousands of steps to walk in a circle. The air is really good.

However, because I visited the off-season in early November, the park was very deserted. Many shops were not open. I only went to Sea World. Watching the mermaid show is a bit boring. The operator should think about how to add more activities and performances in the park and plan shopping streets. Otherwise, the park will be boring and will not attract tourists to visit again~

Sometimes it's cloudy; sometimes it's empty, but the weather and scenery are all exquisite. The service here is also great, room service and restaurant service are all responsive, very enthusiastic and meticulous! Especially the lady who came to clean my guest room on the seventh floor.

I was really touched! And the little sister Jiang Yuan at the front desk also took good care of me and took the initiative to extend my check-out until the afternoon so that I could rest in my room with peace of mind. No, I really appreciate the careful care they gave me. If I have time to go to Guilin, I will still choose Shibaige. In addition to the beautiful scenery, they are also kind and lovely! oh! What’s more, the hotel’s facilities and equipment are pretty good, the hygiene is meticulous and clean, and the service is great! The service in the restaurant is very good, but I hope the products are richer and have more Guilin-specific products.

4 The hotel facilities are well received, it is indeed a five-star standard! The corridor has 24-hour central air-conditioning, which is lower than the room temperature.

Don't queue up for the Ferris wheel! Don't wait in line to see the big shark! Go-karts don't have to line up either. I am very satisfied with traveling with my baby during the summer vacation!
6 For meals, the food is okay, and the breakfast is not picky. There is a swimming pool with good water.
7 There are charging piles in the parking lot! Weilai's fast charge, but the car with the most parking lot is still ideal. Hahaha

8 The disadvantage is that the outside venue is rented to Xigua Video for activities, and there is construction, which has a little impact.

This is a very suitable place to bring children to play. Our travel is not about where we go, but whether we are happy.

I made a note to add an extra bed, and when we arrived at the hotel at 10 pm, the extra bed was already prepared for us in advance, and the lake view room was upgraded. The view from the balcony of the room is very good, and you can also see the Ferris wheel. The swimming pool is open for a long time, swimming laps can be rented, and the children's playground can take care of children. Parents simply free their hands. It would be better if there is more variety in the buffet breakfast and dinner. The shuttle bus from the hotel to the park only runs once an hour. It is recommended to pick up and drop off for a fee, and it is more convenient to be there on call.

Fortunately, I met the beauty Liu Xin from the hotel reservation depar**ent (I have never seen her before, but she must be very beautiful if she is kind-hearted), and even a big-headed shrimp like me can patiently listen to my situation, worry about the needs of customers, and help me enthusiastically and attentively Solve the problem and let my crying face slowly relax. At the same time, I would also like to thank the beauty Zhou Yue at the front desk for answering my questions tirelessly and assisting with room adjus**ents. Thanks again to the two beauties. The hotel should reward them and encourage other employees to serve with a smile. They are anxious about the needs of the guests, and from the perspective of the guests, make every guest feel at home and "go home" every year. 😁😁

I would like to make a comment, the hotel toilet has anti-odor, the sound insulation of connecting rooms is poor, and the room service cannot be called in time (maybe there is a sudden increase in the number of occupants during the summer vacation, and the staffing is not in place, I hope it can be improved)

msg:When there are many people, the service can't keep up. The buffet is not bad. It's a normal hotel. It's not convenient to connect the hotel to the park. Although the journey is short, it's not good to take the battery car in summer because it's crowded, and the directions to the park are not clear. Business The shops on the street are basically closed, and the sun is shining. The rent of the battery car at the park is expensive, and parking is inconvenient, and the location is not accurate. This is a bad review! The park is not very big, but it is enough to play. Even the rides in the sea world still require additional money. This feeling is a bit unfriendly. What is the difference between including tickets and not including the inside of the park? The Happy Tribe is pretty good. When there are few people on the Ferris wheel and you don’t need to queue, you can continue to sit. There is air conditioning and the scenery is good. This is great! There is also a karting field that is quite big, but we can only miss it with a 3-year-old baby alone! It feels good to think about the water world from the Ferris wheel!

There are dolphin, sea lion, mermaid performances, and aquariums of various tropical fish. It is quite interesting and can increase knowledge.
Disadvantages: 1. The hotel is crowded with people around 9 o'clock for breakfast, and the waiters are overwhelmed. The service quality is very average; 2. The hotel is too big, and it takes a long way to go to the elevator to go to the lobby on the first floor. I feel that the settings can be more optimized

mud + hair 🕸
I changed the room, bad flavor and spicy throat
Another one, still hair in the tub
Changed the room and didn't give me a key card
🪰Breakfast: Cang! fly!

The manager lost a dinner, it was very simple, and he couldn’t finish serving several dishes in 2 hours, and he fried them first and threw them there, and then reheated them for me: fat pork scrambled eggs, I told the manager that these are the only dishes
Food, I happen to be allergic to it, so he didn't bother me. The hotel is in a remote suburb, and I can't even buy food when I go out to buy food.

Others commented that the parking space is far away, it is really far away!
Not only is the parking space far away, but the room also takes a long time to arrive.
After 1 o'clock in the middle of the night, someone opened my door🥹

The service of this hotel really needs to be taken seriously. It needs a professional team to intervene and strengthen management. Even the manager has no sense of service at all.

msg:Actually I rarely write reviews! Because lazy! But had to comment today! The hardware of the hotel is very good, new hotel! The environment is also very good! But it feels almost warm! Shouldn't the 5-star rating in my mind be more about service? In fact, we are also people who know the rules! 2 points make me feel very irritated! We stayed during the Spring Festival, and those who provide us with services will give us some consumption to express our gratitude! not much! 20-100 are available! I express this not to say that I am too much! I just mean that I'm not a stingy person! I think that what should be used must be used, and what is unreasonable should be reasonable! In fact, choosing this restaurant was also a coincidence. I came here in a traffic jam in Hainan. I still had a few understandings about Sunac, so I chose to celebrate the Spring Festival here. Before I came, I ordered a group dinner. The communication in the early stage was very pleasant. It must be a crossover The annual concert is a bit demanding! As a result, on the first day of check-in, because we lived in a family room and booked another 4 days, I called the front desk, can you bring me a few more bottles of water? I drink a lot of water! The answer is up to 4 bottles of other money! What kind of water did I think it was, but it turned out that ordinary pure Frappuccinos cost no more than 2 yuan! The house price is 1600, so it’s not enough to drink some water a day! The second is today's New Year's Day, when I went to have breakfast, a waiter stopped at the door and charged half price! The feeling of Chinese New Year is a debt collection! Of course I was also the one who was blocked! I was confused at the time, I said that I lived for 4 days, today this is the situation! Feeling overwhelmed and embarrassed, I felt as if I was going to rely on his tens of dollars! At that time, I just wanted to go to the theory, but I didn't expect that we booked 4 rooms, 7 big, 3 small, and a 5-year-old, and we didn't need to charge them at all! But the scene of being stopped to argue made me extremely embarrassed! To be honest, I have stayed in many hotels, and many have such regulations, but this is really the first time I have been stopped! embarrassing 😅! I can only say that it is a hotel with almost a temperature! The software really needs to be improved! Today's consumers don't care about consumption, what they need is satisfaction after consumption! It's not that I'm reluctant to spend money, it's that I think it's worth it!

Relying on sending tickets to the Sea World to attract people, but no one in the Sea World would you believe? Do you believe in just a few sea animals? Do you believe in relying on ponies and squirrels to fill the rides? The most exaggerated, when the door opens at 11 and closes at 4, there will be a dolphin show at 2, do you believe it? The free tickets can only be used for two days. I arrived at 3:00 in the afternoon, and it was too late. I could only enter at 11:00 the next day. I was in a daze in the hotel all day, and I couldn't bear it. Go ahead, guarantee you won't regret it.

msg:Stayed in the hotel for two days. It feels like a very cost-effective hotel in Guilin! The hardware of the hotel is good, all kinds of facilities are in place, and the scenery is beautiful. Next to it is Sunac Tourism Resort, which is convenient for children to play. In terms of software, the service of the Chinese restaurant is relatively good, and I have eaten three times. Among them, because of the reason of bringing children, I have to eat in the room. I only need a bowl of noodles, and the restaurant supervisor will deliver the meal to the room. It should be pointed out that the service skills of the staff at the front desk are a bit lacking. I asked some questions, but the front desk was at a loss. They felt that they had insufficient energy to serve customers, and hoped to strengthen training. Another thing to say is that the hotel's handsome doorman has a good sense of service, especially the one on duty at noon on the 16th, and the service is in place. Praise is needed. In short, I still recommend everyone to stay and experience it.

Many facilities in the hotel are not open, and there is no swimming pool. The children's playground is not open for free. You can only go to the Sea World next to it. It is a relatively small comprehensive park. It is enough to visit for a morning. The entire Sunac scenic spot is very depressed and only open Several shops.
Generally speaking, the price in the off-season is directly proportional to its experience.

In the evening, Heifei's guests flew drones in our accommodation area again, and we saw this person on the balcony, called the front desk to deal with it, the hotel lobby manager said that he was going to communicate, and after he went over, he told the guests that some guests compared Sensitive, let the other party stop, the other party quibble that they did not fly in our area, the manager simply compromised and said to fly in another place! First of all, I don't accept the lobby manager's responsibility for clearing the hotel's supervision in order not to offend the black trapeze, but also push this matter to the guests, saying that the guests are sensitive! Secondly, the hotel didn't apologize like I did the first time! Shelter the black flying guests!
! The doorman in front of the hotel needs to improve the service level! ! !
The elder brothers in black clothes at the front door of the hotel have a very bad attitude towards the reception of the guests. They are very rigid when they see the guests holding the sleeping child. They asked me to take out my mobile phone to scan the code. ! Scanning the code is a very conscious behavior of guests nowadays, for themselves and for everyone, there is no need to treat guests with such an attitude. ! ! ! ! Hotel breakfast does not change
Others' hotel breakfasts change every day, but this one doesn't change every day! Don't think about staying for more than three days
! ! ! Some aunts who clean the rooms are not serious
I'm talking about the part because there were two days of very serious cleaning, thank you so much! It was the same person for the other two days, so not serious! If the missing things are not made up, the toilet on the ground will be cleaned and dealt with.
! ! ! ! The rooms are soundproofed! too poor!
I slept for 4 nights and 3 nights with insomnia, bang dong dong upstairs on time at 10:30 in the middle of the night, and chatted loudly downstairs until 1:30. Since we brought our own baby, we could not guarantee that he would not cry, so we understood each other and tolerated it without mentioning it. This thing, but, if you want to go on vacation, the sound insulation here is too poor, not only the sound insulation is poor, but also drone shots! How terrible. 🤣
The above is a reference for everyone, as well as dissatisfaction with the hotel. Finally, I would like to say that some of the hotel's staff carefully and carefully supported us to take the baby to make milk powder with water, and other trivial needs. Most of them work seriously and have a good service attitude. The beauty of the hotel is also not to be overlooked. I hope that the hotel will pay attention to the cultivation of emotional intelligence and management level of service personnel.

Popular science, the hotel is one of the low-slow and small no-fly areas. Are your guests registered to fly? I don't think so! It was a pleasant holiday, we didn't call the police, otherwise we would have to ask the police to confiscate his drone, and let this ignorant guest apologize to us!

Above, the first problem is the most serious, and the others are minor problems to be mentioned or not to be mentioned as a reference for other guests

For the breakfast on the third day of the stay, the restaurant has undertaken the company meeting team, which is basically far beyond its ability to receive breakfast, but its breakfast service is still as much as possible. The experience of the customer, made up for the dissatisfaction of the diners with enthusiasm, and greatly praised
The room cleaning aunt is very friendly, and the front desk service is reasonable
The hotel facilities are very new, Jin Ke'er's bedding is very good, and I will change the same product when I go home to experience a better sleep
The hotel has a first-class view, the upgraded lake view room at the front desk makes people feel happy, and the late check-out also makes the time coincide with the nucleic acid test time
Tucao points: the hair dryer in the room is a bit bad, no wind, loud noise, poor effect, the hot and cold faucet in the bathroom, the hot water controls the maximum temperature, but the hot water temperature is low, which will make some guests uncomfortable
Despite the flaws, Shi Gebo is still a comprehensive cost-effective hotel 👍👍👍

Many thanks to the front office manager Jackie for taking care of him, he made the guests feel at home. I can feel that this is a very dynamic hotel, and every employee is trying very hard to do their job well, and I can feel their sincerity to the guests. Adela at the front desk was very friendly. When she checked in, after learning that we were bringing a baby, she specially upgraded us to a baby-themed room when the hotel room occupancy rate was extremely low (this is the premise). There is a thermostatic pot in the room, which is convenient for children to prepare milk powder. Very thoughtful design. The restaurant manager, Yang Zhequ, took special care of us when he saw that we were bringing our baby. I stayed up late that day and couldn't get up early for breakfast. He also thoughtfully arranged for the delivery man Han Yachong to bring me white porridge, a very friendly young man. Auntie cleaning is very serious and is very satisfied with the hygiene she does. She is doing the guest room with the service level of the luxury brand Four Seasons Hotel. I am very satisfied with Huang Yanping, the floor supervisor of the housekeeping depar**ent! ! The chairs on the balcony can face the mountains and rivers, which is very beautiful. This place is especially suitable for someone like me who likes to get away from the hustle and bustle. Beautiful views and perfect service make guests feel peaceful and relaxed!

msg:1. When I checked in that day, the front desk clearly told me to call room service later to change to a room on a higher floor. Because the high floors are currently being cleaned up. As a result, I went back to the room after dinner and called. The female staff who answered the phone said in a cold tone that I would ask, and within a second of speaking, she said that there was no room. Well, after driving for a day, I am also tired, so it doesn’t matter if I don’t change it, but the attitude of you asking about the result and saying no without asking is very speechless. 2. One or two hours after the first thing above, I called the room service to ask if there was any nucleic acid test nearby. The one who answered the phone was the last female employee, and her tone was still as cold and perfunctory as before. Said triumphantly that you should go to the Paradise, I asked where is the Paradise? How did you get there? As a result, she said impatiently that Paradise is Paradise! Haha, Paradise is Paradise! My XX is here for the first time, who knows where the paradise is? At least tell me how to navigate! Asking a passerby on the street may have a better attitude than the waiter in your star hotel. 3. The child went back to pick up books during breakfast in the morning, but forgot to take the room card when he came out. He called the hallway and asked if he could arrange for the waiter to come and open the door. He said it would be arranged immediately, but he just waited at the door of the room for nearly half an hour. The waiter didn't come until the hour. 4. When I got to the parking lot after checking out, I remembered that I didn’t scan the parking ticket (but I didn’t confirm whether it was necessary), so I called the hotel to ask the hotel guests if they need to scan the parking ticket before leaving the venue. The staff who answered the phone said that they didn’t know. Help me ask and then answer me. It took about a few tens of seconds to say that I need to go to the concierge in the lobby to register my license plate number before I can go out. So I turned back on foot (I need to climb a small slope from the place where I parked to the lobby, and it takes about six or seven minutes to walk. The hotel said that they can arrange a sightseeing car to pick me up, but I waited for a few minutes and thought about their work efficiency in the morning , I’d better run over by myself and forget it). Panting and running to the concierge in the lobby, I was told that I don't need to register the license plate number, just go out. Haha, surprise or not, surprise or surprise! Oh, the surrounding environment is still ok.

It was the summer weekend, there was an amu*****t park nearby, the occupancy rate was relatively high, the room was not cleaned in time (the manpower could be increased), our check-in time was delayed by 3 hours, there was no restaurant nearby and we needed to drive out to find it. The price of the buffet dinner purchased separately On the high side, the overall cooking skills still need to be strengthened, and the welcome fruit that has been reflected several times has not been delivered~ It’s a pity!
Hope the hotel to strengthen management and services! First-class environment with first-class service!

On the way, he also cared about whether we were tired from the journey, and prepared drinking water for us.
When checking in, Chen Yani at the front desk warmly introduced us to the hotel and some of the facilities and equipment we will use, and also recommended the signature dishes of the western restaurant to us. The whole process was very pleasant.
The environment is beautiful and the whole process is very pleasant. In fact, the most surprising thing about this store is the service. The hotel prepared welcome fruits when we checked in, and no matter where we meet the hotel staff, they will be very enthusiastic Say hello to us and truly feel at home.

Arrived at the hotel at ten o'clock in the morning. Although it was not time for check-in, Meiyu at the front desk immediately gave us a room to check in. Special thanks!

The hotel is very close to the three major parks of Sunac (Happy Tribe, Water World, Sea World), and provides pick-up service. Li Tang, the concierge, has a very good service attitude. He took us to the park for almost three days of our stay. We also introduced hotel facilities on the way.

If you want to go to the three major parks of Sunac, this hotel is quite suitable, but these parks of Sunac are really bad and not worth visiting. The empty park has already explained everything. There are no marine creatures in the sea world, and the most unbearable thing is that a lot of plants in the park are fake, and the fish swim in a pile of plastic plants, which makes people feel infinitely pitiful. The Happy Tribe is also similar. Several mobile games are spinning, and many of them are temporarily closed. The scorching sun in July makes people feel like they want to escape.

Finally, the hotel's diet is also worth considering. There are no restaurants around, and the hotel's Chinese and Western food are very general. I feel that the hotel wants to cater to different people's tastes, trying to make dishes from the south, east, and northwest, but none of them are delicious.

After staying for four days, there are two breakfasts in the children's room, and the children eat for 40 yuan per child. Which family's logic is this.

It is vaguely between the mountains and rivers, enjoying the beautiful scenery, tranquility and comfort, and a butler-style luxury living experience. The combination of Chinese and Western in the morning and evening, rich in variety and good taste 👍 and children's favorite Haagen-Dazs ice cream 😄 Special praise for the handsome young man Liu Shiyang, the hotel housekeeper 👍 The service is thoughtful and meticulous, and the room type is upgraded for free 👍

No matter where you go in the hotel, there are service staff who warmly greet and say "hello".

I live in a villa and can see the lake view. The room is very big and the spare parts are also good. I am very satisfied. cold.
The breakfast is good. There are not many varieties, but it is delicious. The taste of Guilin rice noodles is a bit bland. It may be due to the lack of ingredients. The crispy skin is the best rice noodles I have eaten recently. It is very fragrant. But the guava and pineapple are a bit sour, and they didn't finish it after trying hard, but the milk jujube is especially delicious and super sweet.
The gym facilities are very good, spacious and relatively complete, and the swimming pool is also very good. The swimming pools of Wanda Vista in the hotels I have stayed in are all good. The water quality is good and it does not irritate the nose. It is recommended to go to the swimming pool.
The attitude of the service staff here is very good. The little brother who is in charge of scanning the code when he enters the door and waits for the battery car specially let him wait in his heating pavilion. The service attitude of Gillian at the front desk is also very good, very patient, and the little brother of the battery car is very timely. Yes, the service of the gym boy is also very good, and the overall experience is great.

msg:The service is very good. Originally booked a mountain view room, I said that adding 49 to upgrade the family parent-child room, but unfortunately the children like to have a bathtub, and finally stayed in the lake view room. The staff would take the initiative to say hello, help with luggage, and when they saw me wearing slippers to eat breakfast, they would remind me to be careful; I had a buffet dinner at the hotel on New Year’s Eve, and they would also introduce any fish (I didn’t hear clearly, haha). Was it delicious? Bones are very suitable for children, let's try it. In short, the service is very satisfactory:)
The environment is also very good, the view of the entire hotel is great, we spent more than an hour strolling around on the first day of our stay, and we were in a good mood. Because it is a separate resort area, sleeping at night is also very quiet.
To talk about the unsatisfactory place, it may be that the hotel is too big. We live on the 5th floor. Every time we go in and out, we have to walk far and tired. Although there are many elevators, the walk is still a bit awkward. Take a walk in the garden on the first floor or have breakfast on the first floor. I can see that many doors on the first floor can’t be opened. I can’t get in or out. I have to go around a large circle to find the exit/entrance. It may be because of the epidemic that it is easy to manage. The door won't open haha.
In terms of food and beverage, I think the taste is average. The buffet dinner has many varieties, but they are not very suitable. The beef is too old, the roast pigeon is too dry and the fried rice is too hard. What reminds me is the first time I drank Asahi. The dark beer is not bad (it was recommended by a certain waiter). The highlight of the breakfast is that there are many varieties of porridge, which look good for health, and the quality of fruit varieties is also good. Other cakes are too sweet, bread, too dry, and coffee too sour. . And the breakfast was the same after staying for two days. .
Overall it is good, I will try Song Pin again if I have the opportunity, and I will also introduce friends to it:)

msg:I originally booked Shiboge, but when I arrived, I found out that it was closed, so I arranged a guest room in Songpin Linhu.
The design of the hotel is great, combining the natural landscape of Guilin with the hotel very well. Especially at sunrise in the morning, the distant mountains, near lakes, and small villages on the opposite side of the lake exude the breath of nature and life. The layout design of the guest room area makes people have a beautiful experience of moving and easy scenery.

Originally the hotel was Wanda Wenhua, now it has been replaced by Songpin, but in addition to the big logo of the hotel, other things including carpets, slippers, laundry bags, desktop stationery, etc. are almost tangible and use Wanda. Mandarin.
The service attitude in operation is quite good, that is, the cost saving is great, and the lotion is only 25ml. In addition, there are only private rooms for Chinese food, and there are no separate seats. The all-day dining is still under construction facing the lake platform, resulting in a very ordinary dining experience. It feels that Songpin really does not have the genes of a luxury hotel, and it is not worthy of such a good design.

In the past, only resorts in Southeast Asia could see such a large scale of landscape, and now you can have such a beautiful scenery in Guilin. The natural Gester landform is used as the background. A huge lake is planned in the middle of the hotel group, and there are healthy trails around it, allowing you to run or take a walk. Needless to say five-star hotel facilities and services. There are not many other entertainment items, I guess I want you to play in the tourist resort next to it. Those who like to run or walk must take advantage of the early morning to walk around the trails, it is really beautiful and very comfortable. The plank road in the middle of the lake is particularly beautiful. Don't miss it when you stay here! Because it is the last night of the National Day holiday, I feel that there are not too many tourists. I hope that the Chinese people will support us so that the good hotels in China can be carried forward.

Especially the little sister Liu Xin susi at the front desk, who looks cute and speaks humorously. The details are well done. As soon as we stepped into the hotel lobby, we came up to ask if we had come by, and asked if we had eaten, and helped us register the license plate number. We also brought two children, gave them two small balloons very enthusiastically, and introduced the children’s entertainment room and swimming pool gymnasium. The concierge service is also very good, will take the initiative to help guests with luggage, scan the itinerary code, I feel that the hotel's epidemic prevention work is very complete. It has long been heard that the hotel lobby is in the style of the Dong and Yao people, with ethnic characteristics. Seeing it today, it really shined. The service staff are all wearing characteristic national costumes, and the landscape painting of Elephant Trunk Hill at the front desk is particularly beautiful. From the observation deck in the lobby, you can see the lake view outside and the Mandarin Villa on the opposite side. There is a beautiful view of "the landscape is long and the sky is one color, and the sunset and the lonely bird fly together." We stayed in a deluxe twin room with lake view, and sister Liu Xin susi also gave our children children's toiletries and slippers. The hygiene of the room is very clean, tidy, bright, with a very large area, and it feels very comfortable. Looking out from the balcony, you can see the Ferris wheel in the paradise, and the scenery is amazing. The hotel is very convenient to go to the park. There is a free shuttle bus. We went to the Happy Tribe and the children were very happy. For dinner, we ate a Chinese restaurant meal. The price is affordable and the taste is good. A Po Yong Tofu has Guilin characteristics. When we checked out, we had the breakfast in the Western restaurant. The breakfast was very rich, with fruits, steak and bread. 10 : It ends at 30, and the time is reasonable. Our family sleeps until they wake up naturally to eat breakfast. Next time we come, we want to live in the villa next door, and hope that the villa next door can also have such good service and food.

Tucao point: I really have to make a good complaint. I have stayed in a lot of five-star hotels during the trip. This is what makes me most speechless. The points for complaining are as follows:
1 Meals are generally very poor! The buffet price is 298, and the hotel discount is reduced by 100. But even so, compared to the low prices in Guilin and the buffet standards of other hotels, the meals are cold, and the desserts are deadly. The point is that the tongue will change color after eating this pigment! What kind of premium is this! ! It is said that it is a seafood barbecue buffet, seafood only has frozen shrimp, it is really speechless... barbecue is also the kind of frozen small skewers, unable to complain. By the way, breakfast is the same. There is nothing to eat. The quality of meal packs and cakes makes people wonder if this is really the standard of four to five stars?
2 The hotel facilities are very so so, the surrounding area is relatively desolate, and there is nothing. Suddenly I have a stomachache at night. I called the service call at 11:30. I called it three times before someone answered. I can understand if I don’t have stomach medicine, but I want to order a yogurt. No, other five-star hotels will at least provide a warm ginger tea, this one hangs up after saying nothing... Except for a swimming pool, there are two restaurants in the hotel, there is nothing, really have to be prepared...
3 The service is not good, the price of the restaurant is really outrageous, and the focus is also very bad. The wagyu burgers and sandwiches ordered to the room turned out to be fried eggs and sausages on bread... Did you put the rest of the breakfast in? This is only 108 copies, why don't you grab it?
In short, because it is new, the facilities and environment are OK, but let's forget about the others...

The hotel stands around the lake and is surrounded by rolling mountains, and you can take a picture when you look up. The attitude of the hotel staff is very good, especially Liu Xin at the front desk, the service is like spring breeze. The children’s room is fully equipped, including Lego, a small tent and a toilet seat for children, to ensure that the baby has something to do when the baby is in the room, which is very suitable for parent-child travel. The balcony faces the lake, the scenery is superb, Guilin’s wonderful mountains and beautiful waters are in front of your eyes, and you can enjoy the light show of Guilin Eye at night, and then make a pot of tea or pour half a glass of wine. Life is nothing but that. The dishes in the hotel should be praised greatly, the breakfast buffet is very rich, and the dinner buffet is also good. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant are very delicious, of course, my favorite is still tea. The hotel is not close to the playground, but there is a shuttle bus that is very convenient. It takes only a few minutes by car. The kayak at the hotel pier is recommended, and children can easily get started. I was afraid of the sun, so I got on the boat in the evening and slowly swim along the waterway in the lake. The quiet area around was the warm light from the hotel, illuminating the way back.

Compared with overseas brands, it can only be regarded as a homestay level, so I don't believe that a purely local brand can have a particularly good experience. This Wanda Jiahua renewed its confidence in local brands, and it is good in all aspects.


I was looking for the Shanshui Resort Hotel. The photos were taken in the hotel and in the amu*****t park next door. At first glance, it looks like an ink painting. Of course, in order to achieve such an illusory feeling, a self-driving car must be available. The traffic is very convenient and can only go to the city, without seeing the exotic scenery.


In fact, most of the experience depends on the excellent hardware facilities. In the case of excellent facilities, other content can be extra points. The air-conditioning system is very good and the temperature control is great, so sleeping is very comfortable. The room was very big, and when I was upgraded to a large room with a lake view, I woke up and looked at the illusory ink paintings.

The breakfast was in line with expectations, and it was served with a lot of Chinese vegetables. Cauliflower, eggplant and tofu are very appetizing, and it is already in place without big fish and meat. The waiter in the breakfast room is very enthusiastic and often asks for the needs. The restaurant is also facing the scenery, anyway, it is the illusory feeling of watching the scenery all the time.

There are relatively few parent-child facilities, which is a bit different from hotels that are especially suitable for parents and children. The small bamboo rafts parked on the side can't stay in the store and sit for a while. In addition, the indoor swimming pool is relatively small and the water temperature is relatively low. Maybe the hotel even hopes that the children will take them to play in the water world nearby.

There is such a flaw, giving full marks to the hotel really feels that this kind of local brand hotel is worthy of encouragement, and I will consider staying again, or consider Wanda Realm hotels in other regions.

The landscape of the hotel is very good, the landscape is well done, and it is a bit exquisite as a Japanese-style courtyard. I booked a mountain view room. Because I was with a child, the lobby manager upgraded me to a lake view room. Great! Kevin also gave us two rides. Be sure to ride or walk to roam the hotel. Behind it is a big lake and wetland, as well as a wetland plank road, which can be walked and cycled in. It is very beautiful. Cycling the big ring is about 10 kilometers on the outer road, and about 5 kilometers on the inner lake in the hotel, you can have fun. Sunac Amu*****t Park is less than one kilometer away from the hotel, and the hotel has a shuttle bus, which is very convenient. The dining is complete, the swimming pool is indoor, and children like to play. A good experience!

There is a swimming pool and a children’s entertainment area, which can be hosted by children, but the content is richer. Some. It is commendable that the hotel’s service has exceeded five stars.

[Lakeside Mercure] The environment is good. I live in a lakeside river view room. The landscape is unique and the lakeside is lined with trees. The clear water is superimposed on the northern Guangxi-style villas. The distant mountains are surrounded by disturbances. If you are in a fairyland, it is especially worth mentioning that you can enjoy the tranquility and serenity on the balcony in the night, but you can also overlook the famous scenic spot of Sunac Resort. We are happy to bloom.
🔔Service: This is a warm journey, and the humanistic care is very thorough. It is a super five-star experience. From welcoming guests to seamless reception, check-in is as quick as going home. The reception girls are professional and courteous, which makes us feel happy to check in, especially a girl named Liu Xin treats others with great care , Professional answers and guidance will make people familiar with the hotel’s facilities and location at a glance. Thanks in particular!

The manager Huang at the front desk quickly upgraded the lake view suite for us. The attitude was good and professional. I was also very satisfied to enter the room. So I immediately booked ➕ for one night. Stayed for 3 nights, the overall experience was as follows; It was opened at the end of June. The supporting facilities are not very perfect. The food is very general. As a five-star hotel, breakfast has no bacon and no ham. It is Chinese food and rice noodles (the rice noodles are very difficult to eat). The hotel's order is also general. There is no underground parking lot. Parking is very inconvenient. The weather in Guilin is hot. And a long walk after the parking. The designers don't know what's in their heads, the hair dryer in the room is not a normal cockroach, there are 3 parks in the town, they are all mini-paradises, definitely not a good look at Atlantis or the big playground, if you can combine the 3 parks into one, The water park bath room should be described as fetid, not exaggerated, all is urine, I directly smoked, then the water slide, so a small one is actually everyone is guarded, 1.2 above can play, I really see for the first time, The water slide in Sanya is more than 1.1. This is not only limited to height 1.2, but the one measuring height is also drawing a line on the wooden frame. My home only has the height 1.18, but the limit height 1.2 of them is actually a big difference 😂. So all their little slides are empty. No one. I just want to know that 1.2 and more children are 6.7 years old. Do you think they will still play with this mini slide? There is no delicious food in the whole town. Flies fly all over the factory. Overall, the hotel environment and room are very comfortable, but the supporting facilities are very ordinary, need to be improved, the staff service is very good, but not professional, I hope to improve.

The hotel facilities are very complete. In the guest rooms, you can lie down and enjoy the beautiful lake view, the magnificent distant mountains, and watch the sunrise and sunset in the evening. The hotel’s food is also very good. Of course, we also go shopping in the outlets of the nearby Sunac Business District. A very good experience. Special thanks to Miss Yang Xue for warmly introducing hotel facilities and caring about our experience throughout the process. Later, there was a warm return call from the hotel manager to communicate like friends.

msg:Sunac Ka Wah’s low price is 499 Mountain View with double breakfast. I don’t see many reviews on ctrip. Some customers say that the hotel has upgraded themselves to Lake View double breakfast. That 499 is very worthwhile.

I was looking forward to the store, my price was 799 Lake View, 2 large and 2 small breakfast, and what ride + afternoon tea set for two. unimportant.

When checking in, the young lady at the front desk refused to change the 2 small breakfasts to an adult breakfast, or I upgraded from a children’s breakfast to an adult’s breakfast, but she also refused. I saw her ask the colleague next door or the leader for instructions, and the leader refused with a blank face. The staff also did not take the initiative to mention or give information about afternoon tea and cycling, and did not mention a word. After I got to the room, I was unwilling to do so, so I took the initiative to call and ask for it. Wouldn't you give me afternoon tea? Why should I go for afternoon tea? Later, a staff member talked about this matter.

The first time I lived in Sunac, I felt that it was hard-working.

Had lunch at the hotel, the restaurant my father ordered just didn’t have the final lunch consumption of more than 300

Since lunch and afternoon tea are a bit intensive, I can’t eat dinner anymore. If both lunch and dinner were consumed in the hotel, it would have already exceeded the room rate of 799. I don’t know why the hotel is so tough that it can’t be negotiated to upgrade from a children’s breakfast to an adult breakfast. I feel uncomfortable seeing the face of the colleague next door.

During the buffet breakfast, I saw a waiter in the restaurant was packing a latte, so I said to take a latte, but the waiter refused, saying that the buffet is not allowed to be packed, I said, what are you doing? He said that this is a takeaway ordered by the customer, but I didn’t understand it. It’s not important.

You all should understand that IHG InterContinental’s lowest-end brand Holiday Express, breakfast, after the meal, you tell the waiter to pack a latte, the waiter will pack it for you with a smile, pack it and hand it to you. Can't take away coffee, this is my first experience.

The waiter explained all this because the Royal Palace Hotel is a conference hotel, so Barabara.
Very far-fetched
So why does a conference hotel, under the premise that it mainly undertakes B-end customers, the hotel sales depar**ent has to send so many promotional links to major OTA platforms? How tired is it to undertake C-end tourists? There are so many things. Since you want to get C-end customers, you must serve C-end customers well.


Very dissatisfied with the service experience

The parking lot is a few hundred meters away from the hotel lobby, but there is no information on how to return to the hotel lobby after parking. Halfway back to the lobby, there is a shuttle bus passing by. When I got on the bus and asked, I was told that the check-in at the front desk would inform me, and there was also a text notice at the front desk. I went back to the lobby and went to the front desk to inquire, but the front desk couldn't get a notice, haha. It really opened my eyes to the need to pay a parking fee to stay in a five-star hotel. I found out later that you need to register your license plate at the front desk to enter and leave for free. However, I didn’t inform you when I checked in, haha. The variety of breakfast is also huh. This is Guilin Sunac Wanda Realm Hotel. The front desk staff are not familiar with the business, and all kinds of troublesome and trivial matters need to be solved by themselves.

msg:The room was booked two months in advance, and the price was still reduced on National Day. 1. When checking in, it was stated that the request needs to be arranged on the same floor. The front desk first said that they could not be on the same floor, and then said that they did not say, OK, you think I am deaf? Ended up on the same floor after repeated conversations but the rooms were far apart.
2. The concierge depar**ent is practically useless, there is no service, and environmental protection fireworks are not allowed. The reason is that someone needs to be cleaned! No sense of service at all. Although it is newly opened, the ability to undertake important matters such as wedding celebrations and banquets is really poor.
3. I called the hotel the night before to confirm that breakfast can be delivered to the bridal suite, and told that it was a special situation for the bride. The waiter promised that it was possible, but the male waiter said that he did not answer the call and could not deliver it to the room the next morning. , and finally sent it upstairs after repeated requests, very speechless! (ps. The young lady who worked so hard to deliver breakfast upstairs and the waiter who helped change the bed sheets are the most considerate services.) There will be no second stay. I hope the hotel management can improve the management and service capabilities of the hotel Improve as soon as possible, and hope that other guests will not step on the pit.

msg:The environment in the store is very good, but the service is really not flattering. The only time I stay in a hotel is to walk at least one kilometer from the lobby to the room I live in, so I advise everyone not to live in a lake view room! What a long trip. You have to take a one-day trip to the hotel for every meal, so let’s talk about it, the doorman and security guard of the hotel! It's really weird, telling me to get out of the car and using fraud, saying that the car was hit by someone else's car. Made the day feel frizzy. If I do not fall or do not want to cooperate with the fall, the hotel can smash the car by any means. But there was no reluctance at all, and he ran from the guest room 1 kilometer away to the parking lot. In is the service of the hotel. The doorman is watching someone help with the luggage, and he dragged his luggage and backpack to check in one kilometer away. Think about what it feels like. The service is really not as good as the B&B. Anyway, I advise everyone not to drive a luxury car and not to stay! Don't stay if you don't wear a famous brand! They're all open-eyed guys. Extremely disgusting!

msg:酒店位置在桂林和陽朔的中間，適合自駕。附近是融創的遊樂園，適合帶小孩子來玩，酒店有定期的擺渡車送到遊樂園。酒店內環境漂亮，陽台看出去就是湖景，對面是融創的宋品酒店，湖裡能划船。親子房內有帳篷和玩具，小孩子喜歡。早餐豐富，國慶期間人多，但補充及時。酒店服務人員態度好，會主動問好，提供幫助。
缺點：
第一次遇到親子酒店內的小童樂園居然收費，而且是普通的海洋球和滑梯這種簡單設施，雖然衹收58元，但感覺膈應，不知道是哪位定的這規矩，建議可以去醫院看一下大腦。沒有提供一次性的襪子，要買。
酒店沒有地下停車場，停車的地方離大堂有點距離，走小路的話，標誌不明顯。整個酒店的路標都有問題，除了大堂以外，其他進出的地方全靠自己摸索，入住期間看到很多人都在找進出的入口。
親子房佈局不合理，房間不大，帳篷佔地太大了，帳篷裏衹鋪了地毯，不像其他酒店會做一個小孩子的窩。沒有大人能用的桌子和坐的沙發，房間內很多東西都衹能放在電視牆上的地方，如果不是特別需要，不建議定這個房型。

msg:第一：**上看到桂林施柏閣酒店的推廣，一直説來呢，沒有定下來時間；今天臨時來桂林，房間是臨時預訂的，價格比較貴，特別建議計劃來的朋友們，一定要提前規劃，不然多花大幾百元的費用
第二：酒店位置離市區偏遠，桂林北站到酒店135元
第三：酒店裡邊的飯和物價較貴，建議去之前提前去超市買店水果和零食
第四：酒店洗澡的時候，花灑水壓較小，次日給前台反饋了，前台立馬通知水電工師傅到房間看看是什麼原因
第五：酒店一樓有小童遊樂場，遊樂場不大，但是價格較貴，好需要買專用襪子才能入內

總之，千里迢迢來到桂林體驗融創施柏閣酒店下來，綜合評分70分；個人認為，需改善的地方還很多

訂了兩晚兩間，一間雙床一間小童房。
外圍環境是非常好的，硬件設施也不錯，但是服務人員還是比較冷漠的，碰到沒有問好也沒有笑臉，還是需要改善，多加培訓。
點餐確實有點小貴，菜品均價120一道菜。訂房含了一晚餐食，在辦入住的時候説第二天晚上有自助，結果第二晚説好的自助餐臨時取消，換成了套餐，也沒有任何解釋，本來是蠻生氣的，在前台問詢的時候發生了一點小插曲。後來前台的小姐姐後面給道了歉還贈送了寶寶小禮物，態度還是蠻好的，好評給這個短髮小姐姐。
早餐服務生的態度也要改進，客人沒吃完，就給收走了，一句話也沒有，吃了兩天，天天黑着臉，像誰欠了錢似的。
還有蚊子實在太多，小童俱樂部，好多蚊子，居然沒有消殺，因為大人沒進去不知道，後來發現小孩子全身都是包，都腫了，問詢怎麼回事，小孩才説在裏面被咬了，還給那個阿姨説了蚊子多，結果俱樂部的阿姨説的：沒關係，咬幾下就好了。鑒於這事，希望酒店方好好做下培訓，還有小童俱樂部的消殺。也是自己擦了葯想到算了，如果咬到太嚴重，酒店還真脱不了幹係！

這裡自助餐的服務員很難溝通明白，沒有服務可言，收盤也很慢，補餐也是。自助餐還可以聽到說「夾完了，沒了」的，有客人吐嘲2百多塊的自助餐得到這種說法不就是坑人？而且才晚上6點！
這裡的室內泳池也不是恆溫，所以晚上游泳會冷，兒童遊樂室是外包的，所以都要收費
至於水世界，海世界，就真的不想多說了…因為真的很失望
所以再也不會選擇融創

環境：在融創度假區域內，周邊環境優美，房間就能看到美景。

衞生：可能是無意中開了房間免打擾的鍵，連住房間但沒有打掃。

設施：附近有融創樂園，去了海世界，雖然是國慶期間，但遊客不多，連樂園的巡遊表演都沒人看，衹有演員，心疼～

1）位置：酒店依山伴水，房間看出去的風景美極了！像住在畫中
2）酒店前台、餐廳、客房部、門衞小哥都非常熱情，看到客人都會熱情的打招呼。這兒特別要表揚一下前台小謝，入住前我打電話來酒店詢問一下有關事項，小夥子立馬加好我微信，我的所有問題都超級耐心的幫我一一解答，入住酒店的核算要求、詳細的核酸地方定位等等。我們到的那天小謝休息，小夥子還特意來酒店迎接我們，並幫我們向領導申請花了少許費用升到了景觀超棒的房間，幫我們預約好下午茶及晚餐時間。真的是太感動了！小謝對待工作真的是一絲不苟、非常的敬業。我入住過許多國內各個大品牌的酒店，按觸過許多酒店的前台及管家，小謝給我的感覺是最棒的！
3）衞生：我們房間很乾凈，但我老公去了早餐廳旁邊的洗手間説有些味道，酒店得知後馬上進行了整改，為酒店的工作人員點贊！
4）設施：風景很美，更喜歡施柏閣這邊望出去的風景。今天早上去宋品逛了一圈感覺一般。酒店週末晚上的自助餐質量蠻好的，品種很多，早餐也比較好。送的下午茶、晚餐質量都很好
乘淡季來體驗會更好

不過後來我們都覺得不爽的是，當時酒店的工作人員，包括大堂經理和開車小哥，不賠錢是我們自己説的，但是整個過程連對不起都沒説過，還是有點過份的。因為我們是熄火停在門口被撞過來的

現已歸來總結如下:其一:酒店的中餐廳服務是個敗筆。週末帶着孩子開車到酒店以後，十二點多，本想着吃點東西去休息一下然後出去玩，結果點了三個菜，楞是上了一個多小時都沒上上來，大中午的坐在那又悶又困，催了好幾次服務員都沒用，綜合評價:除了貴，沒有體會到一點跟這個餐廳價格對等的服務。不建議去中餐廳吃飯，因為他們根本沒有做好接納顧客多的準備，説他們效率低下，來來回回就一句話，因為我們有包廂客人要接待，我就想問，包廂的客人是客人，我們合著是後媽養的唄？於是乎第一天週末因為等飯吃耽誤了下午的行程。
其二:我訂的房型有入住水果配送的。去前台開房間的時候，前台當時很忙，説晚點安排人給我們送，我説好的，就很放心的走了，結果晚上一直等到十點半，打個電話到前台，前台給了我一句，不好意思，我們忙起來給忘了🙄
我説什麼好呢？都快半夜十一點了，你給我送了我還要吃嗎？
好吧，我住你們這，合著花了1600多的房費，體驗了個寂寞！儘管後來有前台帥哥給我打電話，説要彌補之前的失誤，可是這就跟一個刺扎心裏一樣，拔出來了還是會有點痛的吧？
退房的時候，前台美女問了我入住體驗，我當即把這兩個問題説了出來，前台經理小唐説給兩瓶水安撫一下我，結果水沒了，我們急着去海世界，於是乎小唐説安排的遊湖彌補也沒空去了，不過小唐態度還是很棒的😂
總之，這次入住體驗，相當不高興，不開心，作為大桂林的人，為桂林作為一線旅遊地區這樣的服務感到悲哀和遺憾。

msg:這次來住也是衝著融創放煙花的活動，跟男朋友來的，因為施伯格的699套餐沒有了，所以我們升級到了宋品，住的，和環境，包括服務員的態度都很不錯，考慮到車會很多，所以我們沒有開車來，進出都需要靠酒店的接舶車接送，高峯期車大概等個十幾分鍾，快的時候一兩分鐘就能接到人。可怕在安排吃飯上，我覺得他們沒有做好接納很多顧客的準備，導致很多人預約好的自助餐沒辦法吃，一個別墅酒店，讓客人坐在餐廳邊上，沒有桌子的吃東西，我也是頭一次遇到。但是我感覺他們很努力想做好服務，有打電話幾次確認我們有沒有領到餐券和海世界的門票，如如果不是高峯起來，應該體驗不錯。
我喜歡他們的游泳池，教練人很好，和藹可親的，而且游泳池很乾凈。總結下來，我是覺得還可以的，畢竟能給我拍出好看照片的酒店我都愛，但是我男朋友就會覺得很累，跑來跑去的都要叫車，而且晚上他肚子餓了，點外賣，因為別墅區太大了，騎手送錯三次。

🚗 交通：開車從桂林市區，大概45分鐘左右。
🧹衞生：衞生作為連鎖酒店，從來不是擔心的問題。
🔔服務：可能入住當天是他們開業一週年慶，🈵️房狀況，所以服務稍微感覺有點人手不足。但前台小姐姐和小哥哥還是腦子很清楚的

由於酒店位置比較偏，吃飯有些不方便。希望酒店能方便顧客飲食問題。

環境真的不愧為山水酒店，空氣相當清新，鳥語花香，房間設施佈局合理，乾淨敞亮，五一期間人流量不會過分擁擠，全家人都認為是值得二刷的酒店！
對比之下自助餐就有點差強人意……稍微貴价一些的海鮮都沒有，品種不夠豐富，品質也相當一般，服務員態度還行但是處理問題的速度還有待提高～但是忽略掉小瑕疵此趟出行還是很舒心的

這個酒店位置偏遠，到市中心將近30公里，另外設施配套很一般，將近1000元一晚的房費性價比很差

①餐廳的出品可以提高一下
②樂園接送車可以頻繁一點
樂園的設施還出現了故障，被困在了上面等了十多分鐘的人來“救援”。在入園時也花了二十多分鐘，就一直刷臉不成功。

前台的小夥子服務很熱心很貼心，追問他名字得知叫劉詩陽，在給我辦理入住的時候將酒店周邊的訊息全都介紹了一遍，怕我長者家記性不好，還專門給我寫下來，真是個服務周到的好孩子啊！雖然戴着口罩，但是我知道他肯定是一個善良帥氣的小夥子哈哈😊
酒店有自助早餐挺豐盛的，三樓中餐味道也很不錯，我喜歡坐在外面，一邊欣賞美景一邊品嚐美食，吃完了就在湖邊散步，還可以看日出和日落，真是驚喜啊！下次還會再來這個酒店度假啦！

阿嬌還贈送了一份小朋友的早餐，早餐非常豐富，味道不錯，小朋友吃得好飽，早餐的糕點很好吃，桂林米粉很正宗。
辦理退房的時候，還是阿嬌親自歡送的我，行李生也很熱心的幫忙搬行李，他們的服務做得真的很到位。説真的，酒店價格不貴，性價比很高，下次有機會還會回來，也非常樂意推薦其他朋友過來入住體驗一下。總而言之，阿嬌這個小姐姐真的絕絕子，她的管家式服務十分到位，讓人十分舒適，酒店內的風景環境也絕絕子，十分推薦入住！

憤怒篇：酒店未履行約定的入住時間，中途沒有主動提出任何解決方案，超時至下午六點後才能入住。將心比心，試問你們可以接受長途跋涉半天的路程之後，再等待大半天才能入住休息嗎？我分別在攜程和**預訂了一間親子房和一間湖景套房，酒店約定的入住時間為15：00，我們13：40左右到酒店，當時衹有兩位前台辦理入住，後面都站了好些客人排隊站着等候（我遇到的成熟好酒店此時已經有經理出來疏導或增設前台辦理位了，但這裏你就站着等吧），我站着排了半個小時終於到了，前台A在那摸電腦半天然後我發現他連我的姓名和預訂的房型都能跟搞錯混淆。暴露問題一：入住高峯期安排新手和沒有能力的人在前台簡直是致命的管理問題。前台小哥A説房間需要打掃要等待，當時沒到15點，看起來的確人很多也沒到入住時間我沒説什麼，然後説給我們安排下午茶在咖啡廳耐心等待，A他領着我們來到咖啡廳，精彩一幕來了，兩服務員在客人面前爭執一下，總之意思就是咖啡廳服務員説那位前台小哥沒有權限給我們安排什麼下午茶，暴露問題二：兩部門管理脱節。最後衹給我們提供了聽裝飲料和幾塊餅乾，是不是他對下午茶這個概念有什麼誤解？這就是嘉華酒店的所謂下午茶？好吧！就是連需要人工製作的那種飲料都不捨得提供給你的那種感覺。當時我身體不舒服頭很暈又很痛，我就在沙發那躺着等，結果過來一服務員説“這裡是公共場所您不能躺在這裏”，我沒力氣跟她爭論，我想説我大老遠跑來這裏不是來蹭你們咖啡廳也不是來睡你們沙發的，如果你們能快點給我房間我也不想在這躺着，再加上我真的頭疼。暴露問題三：員工培訓和話術管理，當時我頓時感到受到了侮辱級的待遇。當時等待了一個小時，三點半我去問前台，被告知還是沒那麼快繼續等，我看前台小哥A一臉委屈的樣子看起來真的沒有房間可以安排我就算了。四點我老公去問，A已經離崗然後對後來的員工沒有任何交接工作，如果我們不來催促可能就被遺忘在咖啡廳了。暴露問題四：員工換崗沒有交接好工作無延續。換了另一個管理層女B接待才發現根本沒有給我們辦理手續，這時我的怒火已經被點燃，然後女B還算果斷給馬上協調安排了其中一間親子房出來（這還是後面客人的房間不得已調出來給我們的）並贈送了我侄女小孩的早餐一份作為補償。
續篇：本以為事情到這裏就結束了，然後還沒完，但至少有個躺的地方了，於是我們四個大人加兩小孩在一間房裡待着繼續等待我們另一間房間。從四點到六點，期間我老公主動打過三次以上以上電話“快捷服務”催促，對方都表示會讓前台進行回覆，可是我們從來沒有接到來自前台的主動回覆情況，不明原因，不知道這個湖景套房有多大一個下午也打掃不出來。暴露問題五：各部門沒有銜接，已經出現的問題客人沒人負責管理集中主動解決。最後一次我親自打電話催促，此時我已經沒有任何耐性了，她們告訴我房間已經好了會有人帶我們去？好了於是我們親自又跑到前台想着自己領房卡，我在旁邊帶小孩，我老公去前台領房卡，還是一樣等待了很久，我過去詢問情況，這時我聽到接待我們的前台C小姐一臉憤憤不平的態度和樣子説“這不是我們前台的問題，這是客房部在系統裏沒有放房間出來，沒辦法辦理房卡，你可以隨便投訴”，我老公從頭到尾都很和氣在跟她們溝通，但此時我已經安耐不住我的怒火吼了起來，這是一個前台服務人員該説的話嗎？暴露問題六：員工招聘和培訓，員工話術管理。這位C小姐的脾氣性格和能力我認為根本不適合也不能勝任前台甚至服務行業。首先她衹站在個人立場，認為自己操作上無錯不應該被責怪，也不知道我們客人這一天下來經歷了什麼，不但不認為自己代表的是整個酒店形象而且更加不可能站在客人角度思考，格局太小。其次，當時有管理層在現場，當她解決不了問題時不懂得如何先請求上級解決問題而不是跟客人抱怨還是説隨便你投訴這種話出來。在我的怒吼之下，最後管理層D女上來馬上把房卡給了我們，讓人領我們到房間，到了房間我也很詫異無語，這個套房也就比普通房多了個圓桌和衣帽間，對比我之前住過的酒店套房，面積並不大，居然一直到下午六點才能入住？
其他服務欠缺的地方：早餐看似種類夠了但不好吃，用餐人數多沒位置就不説了，早餐廳的位置標識不清晰，暴露問題七：所有服務員根本沒有主動服務意識，甚至叫擺個餐具都要喊兩遍才擺（服務員人數並不少）。更誇張的是，當時兩邊櫃子都已經沒有杯子了，我看到兩三個客人都在找杯子，一服務員就站在一米的櫃前無事可做，就在眼前也沒看到杯子沒了也不知道客人需要杯子，直到我跟她説杯子沒了才反映過來。之前作為補償管理員女B贈送的多一位早餐，不知道也許是衹送了一天沒説清楚，後來我父母才跟我説第二天早上去也被攔下。第二晚晚上十點左右小孩吐奶了臟了床單我電話要求更換，也是説高峯期要等這一等就等到十一點半以後才來換。連父母這種沒什麼要求的人，這麼多事情下來都一致認為這個酒店服務真的是差。
補償篇：直到事件的末尾，管理層D女士表露積極的和解補償態度，後面還有前廳經理表態道歉。我均沒有接受，首先我認為我的寶貴的旅行時間計劃和精神損失不可逆，其次是我認為從我們進入這個酒店到下午六點這個漫長的時間段，一次次激起我的憤怒，這中途你們都在哪做了什麼？哪怕是主動告知我們房間狀態或是有其他解決辦法也好，都沒有，每一次都是我們主動去催，我不奢望您們服務多麼周到，衹祈求基本合理的訴求而已，那麼事後再多的補償談有何意義？這一分就致敬您們高管積極補償的態度還有最後客房人員送的禮品。抱歉差評我是肯定要給的，原本計劃各個平台投訴的就算了。

msg:酒店的硬件設施，綠化環境都是非常好的，衹是人員服務意識及管理方面特別差！我們是下午兩點到的，前台告知我們必須大堂等待一小時到三點才能辦理入住，理由是房間沒有打掃好，所有三點前到店的顧客都是這樣告知的，造成的結果就是大堂熱鬧成了菜市場，小孩又多，各種哭喊打鬧聲很嘈雜，我們無法忍受所以自行上樓找到樓層保潔確認整個樓層房間早就打掃完畢了，下來告知前台又反覆跟樓上確認後才交給我們房卡。真理解不了房間明明打掃好空着就是要把顧客都擋在大堂等那麼久有什麼好處。

msg:早餐種類有點少了，水果三四種，餐廳整個放吃的地方不大，桂林米粉的味道太一般了。大床房有浴缸，雙床房沒有，房間裏飲料的價格還算合理。我們早上十點過去辦理手續存行李，然後去遊樂園玩，到了下午四點回到酒店告訴我們還有一間房沒有打理完，太離譜了，就算再怎麼樣入住時間14:00的話也不至於到16:00還沒打掃完吧？從上午十點到下午四點六個小時的時間不能打掃出兩間房，這是這個價位的酒店犯的錯誤嗎？不過房間還是挺乾淨的感覺，可能就是打掃那麼久的原因吧。問服務生有沒有去遊樂園的接駁車，被告知我們沒有，第二天早上在門口打車過去的時候保安告訴我們有接駁車，剛還接了一班走，再去問服務生又被告知一小時有一次接駁車，太無力吐槽了，望加強培訓。

缺點：1、酒店小童遊樂室是外包的 幾乎都是要收費的項目 進去也必須買他們的襪子 遊玩室的項目也適合最起碼3歲以上的小朋友 最為樂園旁邊的高端酒店沒有特設免費的小型遊樂場有點可惜
2、原本定了兩間房一天 後來想説酒店不錯多住一天 看到有連住兩天送門票和餐的套餐 就想用套餐 但是一番溝通都不能把連住兩天的拆分兩間房一天 有點遺憾

msg:中秋假期跟女友到融創玩，也是為了省心就選擇了這倆酒店，環境、風景各方面都挺好的，因為我們粗心大意訂錯房間，前台小哥還給我們免費升級，感謝！！住得很開心！
唯一的缺點就是假期可能人多的緣故，酒店搭配的自助早餐太拉胯了，作為一個廣西人，實在是忍受不了酒店的桂林米粉不放鹵水！遠道而來的外地人吃了怎麼辦？真丟桂林米粉的臉！其他菜品也是比較隨意，不像是萬達的水平。不過後麪跟前台小哥建議，小哥也積極反饋，總之也是希望自己家鄉的旅遊業能越做越好，加油！

msg:不推薦理由：
1、離景區特別遠，打車來回要200多。旁邊的歡樂世界也很無聊，小學生秋遊去的地方。
2、服務不規範，我提前聯繫了酒店，要把陽台上的藤椅換成沙發椅，前台的一個妹子説，衹有套房的陽台才有沙發椅，可以幫我申請。後來一個稱是經理的人給我打電話説，全酒店房型都沒有。懶得換是不是也應該統一話術。
3、五星級該有的配套物品沒有，比如音響，茶葉。茶葉都沒有，放一套茶具。我打電話問前台有沒有茶葉，告知是收費的。我問有什麼品種的茶葉，告知是正山小種。剛好我衹喝這個，收費就收費唄。結果送過來的茶葉是一罐拼的，裏面有4包不同的品種，衹有1包是正山小種。無語還要88。
4、酒店的中餐廳裏好多蒼蠅。
