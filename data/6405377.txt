The bartender, Cathy, displayed remarkable skill and creativity with her cocktail mixology, making each drink not just a beverage but a memorable experience. The manager, Sophie, ensured everything ran smoothly, reflecting her excellent management skills and attention to detail. Additionally, the waitresses Vicky and Ruby were the epitome of professionalism and warmth, making our stay even more enjoyable with their attentive and friendly service. The ambiance of the bar was elevated by their combined efforts, making it a must-visit spot. Kudos to the team for their outstanding service which significantly enhanced our evening!

The beach, a huge golf course, and the air is particularly good! ! !
Having stayed in so many well-known luxury hotels at home and abroad, the Ritz in Haikou is the ceiling. Needless to say about the hardware, the entire slope leads to an independent fountain and a super luxurious but comfortable lobby! The equipment is very new, from the dining china to the beds and ceilings! The ceilings are decorated in every detail. I love to dream. I sleep so well in the Ritz. It’s so magical!
Every staff member there is very qualified, most of them can speak English, and they are all handsome!
When I got off the bus when I first arrived, my phone was out of battery. The concierge guy immediately found the fastest solution to help me pay in advance😆😆😆Everyone is so qualified and cultured!
Special thanks to Bella Yun from the executive floor!!! When I was still in Hunan, she added me on WeChat to remind me about the weather in Hainan! He knew the time of my flight and was especially concerned about whether it would arrive! I was really taken care of a lot when I was traveling alone! ! ! He also made me many pots of tea and let me eat more! Want to cry!
I don’t know the name of the young lady at the front desk, but she’s so nice! Really, the ceiling of a domestic hotel! ! !
Every dish and every dessert is exactly the same as what you eat abroad! You can feel the quality even in the kimchi!
I like this hotel so much, it’s girl-friendly and kid-friendly! More suitable for business people! So quiet and very British!

msg:On New Year's Eve, the family stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, Haikou with great expectations, and made reservations for the New Year's Eve dinner in advance. Let me briefly tell you what happened. The day before you checked into the hotel, I called to ask if there was a housekeeper service. A colleague from the hotel front desk responded by adding WeChat to provide services. Until I checked into the hotel, there was no service staff communicating via WeChat. After arriving at the front desk, I continued to ask if there is butler service. The front desk staff replied that there is an additional charge. Based on my personal experience of staying in hotels, I have never heard of any high-end hotels charging extra for hotel butler service. Even if there is an additional charge, the front desk did not explain the charge standard. Because we have an elderly person with limited mobility in our family, we need to communicate various issues with the housekeeper. After checking in, room 603 had a musty smell. We were mentally prepared for the climate in Haikou. But as a high-end hotel, we were still a little disappointed. Something strange happened in Room 811 of Suihe. After checking in, I first found skewers left by the previous guest. During the Chinese New Year, hygiene was a bit neglected, so I just tolerated it. After dinner in the evening, I went back to the room and went to bed to watch TV. I found half of the sticky toy under the quilt, and then I found the other half of the toy behind the pillow. I immediately complained to the manager on duty. Because it was New Year's Eve, I didn't want to make things too difficult for the hotel. The hotel quickly sent someone to change the bedding. We look forward to the hotel giving us a satisfactory reply in the future. As a high-end hotel, there are serious problems with internal control. The result was that the reply given to me was to send me two afternoon teas as compensation. Would this kind of feedback, this kind of service, make me travel so far and suffer all over again? ridiculous. If hotel managers were the consumers, would they be able to accept this kind of feedback? This shows the arrogance of Haikou Ritz management. Finally, does the duty manager take every guest seriously? We will leave our contact information when we check in. Have you made serious preparations? They said they didn't have my contact information? Bad review! Bad review! Bad review!

Room facilities:
Traditional British style, elegant and noble, the bed is very comfortable, the closet and bathroom are large, there is an LCD TV in the bathroom, you can watch it while taking a bath, the carpet can be seen because of its age, although it is cleaned very clean, it is still It seems not very tidy, the hardware is not well maintained, the door latch is broken, but everything else is fine. The balcony sliding door opens and the view is great. The endless green is very eye-catching and can be ventilated. It is a plus point for a hotel. There is also a clothes drying rack on the balcony, which is very convenient.
breakfast:
The variety is not rich, but it is relatively exquisite. It is very good in Haikou. The breakfast is slightly adjusted every day. I like the Hainan pickled noodles and fried noodles in the noodle stall. The oa**eal yogurt in the freezer tastes very good. The waiter will take the initiative to ask about coffee or After the tea is ready, it is delivered to the seat. The service level is always very high, worthy of the Ritz.
parking:
There is a parking space in front of the hotel, which is free for hotel guests, but the parking spaces are limited, and it is also very convenient to have an underground parking lot.
Service: The restaurant service staff are enthusiastic and will take the initiative to say hello. When checking in, the service staff's attitude was okay, but they did not proactively remind them of some rights when booking a room. Checking out was very pleasant. When I came back, I found that I might have forgotten the book about Su Dongpo I just bought at the hotel. , and no one has contacted me. I hope someone will find it and use it, or put it in the room for guests to read. Don't throw it away. In short, I have stayed in the hotel a lot, so I don't have too high expectations. It's good to be normal. There are some flaws. It can be ignored, and it can come again.

msg:The first stop in Haikou. The layout of the room was very good. However, there was a musty smell during this season. After coordinating with the hotel, I was quickly transferred to the executive floor, which was much better. The hotel as a whole still attaches great importance to service with a smile👍The bed is very comfortable, and it is no problem to sleep on one large bed and one small bed in the twin room. The children also experienced golf putting. The staff at the children's club were very loving and played with the children for a long time. You will have a better stay experience in summer.

The hotel staff were very polite, including the breakfast room and the staff who delivered meals to the room. They are all very welcoming and nice. The important thing is that it is very quiet at night, which is very friendly to people like me who are picky about sleep. But there is one thing: when I checked in, I asked the lady at the front desk what rights and interests I had, and she said there were none. When I made the reservation, I saw that there was a golf experience. Although I didn’t come here for this, but! It’s a fly in the oin**ent!

1. Highly recommend the Chris**as 1888 dinner. I want to know the details, but I still only tell you what is included in the lottery (not interested)
2. After asking the third staff member of the golf course, I found out that I had to go to the children's playground next to the swimming pool to get the equipment. I called him and asked him to wait in the lobby? Totally confused
Is there a coach for the training class? (Actually, there is) The staff said no, as if they were really unfamiliar with the business.
The course is 90 minutes. The actual class is half an hour. Two people take it, and each person takes 15 minutes. (Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it.
3. Restaurant: Very cold! The table next to me also said that this Ritz is not cozy at all. It seems that we are not the only ones who feel this way.
4. The swimming pool is closed? But why? Is it because it's cold? We don't know. After all, I didn't tell you the reason. I just took a photo and left.
5. The staff are very indifferent and most of them don’t say hello.

1. Check in early and upgrade the room type
2. The cleaning girl feels really hard

The executive lounge is our favorite. Every time we receive very warm reception and service from Amber and other service teams. Lunch and dinner are provided here, as well as afternoon tea, which is always very stable. It is not boring to spend a whole day in the hotel. I strongly recommend that you try the executive lounge service when you come to this hotel. It is very convenient.

msg:The hotel I stayed in this time was the worst among similar hotels, and I was overall disappointed. 1. The hardware facilities are acceptable, but the overall service is not online. It lacks initiative except for the concierge. It is basically "passive" and cooperative. Starting from arriving at check-in at noon, without queuing, the front desk efficiency is extremely low. For the guests The requirements are basically question-and-answer type, without any proactive information or prompts.
2. Before we entered the room, we first asked for cleaning, and then said that there was something wrong with the bed board, so we moved to another floor. When we returned from an outing, we found that the smell of smoke in one room was extremely serious (we were given a non-smoking room), which is no exaggeration. The smelly kind. I don’t know how to check before handing over the room. I waited until 22:30 in the evening to check in. Although one room was upgraded, there was still a smell in one room, which was bearable.
3. The bedding is too soft, the details of the room are poor, the floor mats are seriously curled, and there is a risk of tripping, the dehumidifier is continuously filled with water and is not replaced, and the toiletries are no different from those of a fast hotel.
4. The restaurant has good hardware facilities, but the breakfast is not rich, the orange juice is concentrated, the service staff have no smile at all, nor take the initiative to say hello, and basically turn a blind eye to the guests.
5. For Ctrip bookings, Marriott members cannot earn points even if they pay in-store. Since bookings can be made through multiple channels, points should be accumulated.

As a top luxury hotel, the Ritz-Carlton is indeed a ceiling, every detail is very tasteful. The combination of wood and leather complements each other, and the smell of the hotel is also woody, unlike some hotels that blindly pursue cheap perfume.

The toiletries are Greek figs from Diptik. After washing, there is a very high-end fragrance on the body. I planted this body wash and prepared to go back and buy it for use at home.

It is said that the executive lounge can eat five meals a day. The afternoon tea is very good, the environment is very quiet and private, but I have a small comment. At the same time, a person came to the executive lounge for afternoon tea and the executive afternoon tea for three of us had the same dishes and quantity. We asked the waiter if it was possible Added a dessert, but was told it was not possible, which made us a little bit dissatisfied, but overall it was very good. The most amazing thing is the dishes in the dinner lounge. Although there are not many dishes, you can see that everything is carefully selected and prepared by the chef. There are various cocktails and wines for dinner.

The golf putting experience is only suitable for beginners. If you like golf, you can go to the nearby golf international course to play. ￼

The bed in the room is really more comfortable than many other hotels. The room facilities show the taste of details everywhere, and the duty-free shop is just downstairs of the hotel, which is very convenient!

The manager Ella has a very good attitude and good service! This Ritz is the first choice next time!

The Flair sky bar has a complete bar list and delicious food. After 9 o'clock, there are foreign singers singing. The overall service is attentive, and the most distinctive thing is the cocktail.

The bartender Jelly carefully introduces the characteristics of each wine, adding value to the experience!

msg:The room was a bit different from expectations, but the manager quickly resolved it. The meals in the executive lounge are not as small as other Ritz hotels (the executive occupancy rate of the Ritz in Haikou is not high), but they are barely ok. The plane was late on the first day. It’s very considerate Reserved the afternoon tea. The staff are very polite. What I like is Ritz’s consistently high service standards. I’m always satisfied. PS I’m a little disappointed that there is no little lion

msg:The two points that impressed me the most in Haikou: 1 is the sky of Haikou. When I wake up in the morning, I can see the soft clouds. I feel very happy and comfortable. I really want to pinch them! Of course, this is inseparable from Linda's thoughtful service. Before checking into the hotel, she called to ask me what I need, and she was very considerate. 2 is the service and environment of Ritz-Carlton. In terms of service, Linda’s thoughtful care is unquestionable, with a sweet voice, thoughtful, and timely service; the waiters at the entrance of the lobby are very careful in handling luggage and opening and closing the car doors; the service staff in the restaurant are all handsome and beautiful Proactive and careful; the aunt who cleans the room is also very friendly and provides everything I need in a timely manner; when checking out, Ella zhang will patiently explain to me and complete the check-out smoothly. The first time I stayed at the Ritz, I felt really great, and I liked it very much. In terms of the environment, I like the design of the entire hotel. I am used to vacationing in Sanya and Wanning, but I am not used to returning to urban life suddenly. I stayed on the ninth floor of the hotel, and it was very pleasant to blow a breeze on the balcony at night, the air was very good, and I was not so irritable. Every night, I called the turndown service. I really want to move the Ritz mattress back home, it's so comfortable! Next time I come to Haikou, I will stay at the Ritz-Carlton. I love both the people and the environment! ! !

msg:The overall decoration of the hotel is American-style, and the room decoration also fits the golf style. Generally speaking, it has a sense of age, and it can be regarded as a relatively traditional golf hotel. (Bonus points for mattresses in guest rooms.)
Check-in and other procedures are consistent with other domestic Marriott hotels. Services such as turndown and cleaning were very timely. I am very grateful to Mr. Allen for his instant WeChat response. Even if he contacted him in the early morning to help book a restaurant, he got timely feedback.
This time, because it was a temporary decision to staycation around the island, I came all the way from Sanya. Compared with the hotel I stayed in before, it is a pity that I did not provide any free minibar or welcome fruit service. (It is also the inland hotels of the same group that charge for minibars, but Grand Hyatt on the island provides free minibar services.)
The breakfast and the complimentary dinner are personally considered to be up to standard. Especially the dinner at Renaissance is off-season and there are fewer people, so it is quite comfortable to eat.
Other advantages are that it is more convenient to go to the airport, and the surrounding area can be regarded as an integrated resort area, and it is also relatively close to attractions such as Mission Hills and movie bases.
Recommended for friends who don't like to go out and like to stay in hotels.

msg:The hotel has a very bad smell, like the aftertaste of a clogged sewer. We entered from the ba*****t garage and the bad smell persisted through the passageway to the lobby directly on the 3rd floor. But after entering the hotel, it will be covered by a strong fragrance.

There are also a lot of small flying insects in the bathroom of the room (the kind that are often found in passing garbage dumps). The floor is relatively high and it should be flying in from the bathroom sewer. I have never stayed in a hotel with so many small flying insects.

The service is average, and the most impressive thing is the breakfast on the last day. I asked the waiter to help me pour a glass of full-fat iced milk, and I insisted on taking it myself. I ate breakfast at the hotel for three days in a row. Full-fat iced milk needs to be provided extra and cannot be taken by myself.

In short, the overall experience is very poor. The decoration and breakfast are all five-star standards. It is the most luxuriously decorated hotel in Haikou. But the smell and bugs are just unbearable.

msg:The room has a view of the golf course and the hotel is quite close to the airport. There was a queue for breakfast due to the crowds, and the swimming pool is not big. The golf experience is that there is a small lawn at the entrance to provide a putt. The point of dissatisfaction is that there is no welcome fruit, Marriott points and other services due to Ctrip booking. I stayed at the Marriott the night before, the service was very good, there were fruits, and the Marriott account also earned points. I originally booked the Ritz-Carlton thinking that the service would be good, but anyway, the housekeeping depar**ent said that it was booked by Ctrip, so there was no fruit and other services, only silver card members have it. I feel that the service is not as good as that of Marriott, and it is not very good to treat guests with different reservation channels differently

The view of the room is invincible, and you can have a bird's-eye view of the entire Mission Hills North District. The golf element design in the room is also visible everywhere, I like it very much! In particular, I would like to praise the sister who cleaned the room. When she learned that we were going to play golf, she prepared a lot of mineral water for us every day, and the room was cleaned very carefully. Ms. Angel at the front desk was gentle and considerate when we left the store, and she helped us issue the invoice in time.

msg:It met all my expectations of Liz. The hotel has shuttle buses to Mission Hills Lake, Movie Commune and Duty Free City. Behind it is the Duty Free City, which is very convenient for shopping and eating.
The service is very good, the high-speed rail ticket at 4:00 so it also helped us to extend the check-out by 1 hour and 3:00.
Especially compared to the previous toothpaste hotel in Haikou, which had no service at all, it made us feel at home.

There is a golf driving range, a small football field, an open-air swimming pool, and a large bathtub in the room for bathing It's very comfortable. There are many varieties of breakfast, and the bread is delicious. The whole service from check-in to check-out is very touching. The child said that he will stay here for two nights next time haha. Ps: No during the Spring Festival How the price increase is really trustworthy "Ritz-Carlton"

The service from Felix Liu, the front desk cum housekeeper, was excellent. The reception was meticulous and thoughtful, and they also informed of various travel needs in detail, and actively helped to coordinate the check-in time of the next hotel to be checked in~ Provided a lot of help and care during the process~


The hotel's environment, sanitation, afternoon tea and Chinese restaurant experience are all great~

Next time I come to Haikou, I will choose again~

The taste and experience of the food are basically satisfactory, and Linda is also very careful and responsible. A few days ago, I thought the Marriott was in a good location. I also stayed at the Hilton in Wenchang. It’s really hard to say. I just want to say that when I come to Haikou, I can only look for the Ritz-Carlton. The other five-star hotels are really not good at all. The management is poor. It's not a little bit.

Not long after I made the reservation, someone contacted me and helped me arrange all the things I needed for my stay. I felt better. half. After arriving at the hotel, I had no idea. I can only say that the Ritz is still the same Ritz. The decoration service is clean and hygienic. The combination of solid wood and leather makes people feel at ease instantly, and the mood is completely good! Special thanks to Simonay in the lobby, I feel that it is no different from St. Regis's 1-to-1 butler service. With this price and this experience, next time you have the opportunity to come to Haikou, you don’t need to look for a hotel anymore.

I booked a package with a double bed. Because my colleague was unwell and changed the itinerary temporarily, I asked to change to a double bed room after arriving at the store. It is true that everyone is running a fever and feeling unwell, and cleaning the room is too busy and needs to wait. Understandably, I just happened to visit the duty-free shop next door.
When I called to inform me that the room was ready, the luggage had already been sent to the room, and the welcome staff sent me to the elevator all the way, with a very good attitude.
The rooms are clean and comfortable, the scenery is good, the sound insulation effect is good, the breakfast is rich in variety, the attitude of the waiters is very good, overall very satisfied.
The only thing I want to mention is that the front desk did not mention the golf putting experience and other content in the package when I checked in. Of course, I don’t need it myself, so it doesn’t matter, but other guests may care. The front desk checks in after the guests I still have to mention it.

Get up at 7:30 for a morning run/exercise in the gym. After breakfast, go to the green to play putting with your children. At 10:00, go to the Kids Club to participate in activities. Lunch has a snack buffet at Tian Lung Heen. Swimming or taking a bath in the room with freshly-cut fruit that just arrived is very comfortable every day

I like Tian Lung Xuan so much. Dim sum buffet for lunch. Eat and cook. You can taste a lot of dishes.
The dishes for dinner are also excellent, the crispy three-layer meat is absolutely amazing

Bread baskets (including fruit bread and drinks) are delivered every day, afternoon tea is delivered to the room every day, and their Cantonese restaurant is surprisingly delicious.
Next time I come to Haikou, I should still stay at your home!

Service: Each hotel staff is very kind and enthusiastic, but the sense of distance is very appropriate and very polite. Miss Ruby at the front desk is very impressed. The communication is not very smooth, and she will take the initiative to ask and be very gentle and send us two hotel room cards with their names before leaving.

We like to have porridge for dinner, but the restaurant on the 19th floor does not have it. The waiter asked the Chinese restaurant downstairs to make porridge specially for it. I don't have a good appetite, and I'm afraid of the cold. The waiter in the restaurant warms the chilled fruit in the microwave. Ms. Lin Zihuan at the front desk knew that we came to Haikou for the first time, and found a tourist map of Haikou and introduced the surrounding attractions in detail. We went out for a walk and caught up with the cloudy day. Miss Lin Zihuan prepared umbrellas for us. It was really warm everywhere! Come to Haikou, only live in Ritz-Carlton!

Although the Ritz is far from the city (it takes 30-40 minutes to take a taxi one way) and there is no sea view at all, but as a loyal Ritz fan, I still want to stay here. There is nothing to say about the decoration and sanitation of the facilities. I arrived a little early and had a room and arranged check-in in advance, but the service initiative needs to be improved. First of all, there was no one to help carry the luggage. The first time I went to the room, I was only directed to the elevator. This was really not as good as the Ritz in Beijing and Guangzhou. Furthermore, I really want to complain about the breakfast...it's too simple, not as good as the Haikou Hilton, let alone Le Méridien in Shimei Bay. There are so many delicious things to eat at Tianlong Xuan in the Mingming Hotel, and the lunch buffet at Tianlong Xuan is super cost-effective! Recommended to check in! ! By the way, I would like to mention Xiuling and Xiaoying Rita from Tianlongxuan. Their service is super considerate! I had a good experience at FLAIR on Chris**as Eve, and the Chris**as-themed cocktails were quite cute. I bought a little lion to take home, and haha ​​found a Hainanese wife for a young man from Beijing. I basically walked around the city during the day, so I didn’t have time to visit the duty-free shop next to the hotel. Next time I come to Haikou, I will most likely not choose the Ritz. It will be much more convenient to stay in the city.

As the flagship luxury hotel of Marriott, the facilities, services, software and hardware should be among the top hotels in Haikou. After all, there is only one top luxury hotel in Haikou.
Service: The service of the hotel is the best among all the Ritz-Carltons I have been to. Just after getting off the car, someone helped with the luggage. The check-in efficiency at the front desk is very efficient, and the service is also very warm, especially Ms. Xiaolin, who took the initiative to bring us Delivered to the room, and also introduced us to the facilities of the room, and the meticulous service to us. Give her a thumbs up for this! My first good impression of The Ritz-Carlton, Haikou started from Ms. Xiao Lin, because her service was too warm, friendly and professional, which can be said to be the beginning of my good impression of this Ritz-Carlton.
Room: The size of the room is not very large, the bedding is very comfortable, the linen is made of Frette, the experience is very comfortable, the drinks in the minibar are not very rich, there is a bottle of Wangzai milk in the minibar for a fee, it feels a bit price-dropping, free The drink is equipped with 6 capsules of coffee and two twg tea bags. The bathroom can be used in a reasonable space. It is equipped with a luxury hotel standard double basin sink, but it is not equipped with a smart toilet, and the spare parts are Ritz-Carlton standard. Espree
Catering: I tried the Italian restaurant and the bar restaurant on the top floor in the hotel. The taste is not bad. The breakfast variety is quite satisfactory. It was very touching and thankful for being ready for me when the time came.
Recreational facilities: The equipment in the gym is made of Italian Technogym, which is very easy to use. The swimming pool and gym seem to be shared with the Renaissance next door.
Although this Ritz-Carlton is not very outstanding in terms of hardware and design, but his service makes me think this is my favorite Ritz-Carlton, thanks to Ms. Xiaolin from Haikou Ritz-Carlton, and thanks to every Haikou Li Every employee of Scarleton has left me with a good memory in Haikou!

The first is humanistic care. Haikou Ritz is the last stop of our self-driving car on the east line. The child is a little uncomfortable driving by himself for a week. Miss Nancy Nancy at the front desk answered the phone and arranged the room according to our idea, while cooking the child. Hot rock sugar Sydney juice (Picture 2).
Then the child's condition worsened, and we felt the concern of Nancy and Clare from the executive lounge, as well as many unknown handsome guys at the front desk and the executive lounge. Even at 2:00 in the morning, Nancy called to help us inquire about the hospital. After checking out, the children took a nap in the lounge, and Clare helped us pack cookies before leaving. Every hotel employee we come into contact with has a very high degree of commi**ent to the work and a sincere smile from the heart.
Hardware, adhering to the consistent style of Ritz, Haikou Ritz is particularly new, with a good view, overlooking a large green and golf course. The surrounding transportation is convenient, very close to the airport.
Dining, five meals a day in the Ritz executive room, breakfast in the large restaurant where all guests dine, others in the lounge. All good.
If you go to Haikou again, you will definitely choose Haikou Ritz, and if you go to other cities for vacation, Ritz will also be your first choice.

In order to experience two different hotels, the Renaissance and the Ritz each stayed one day. The hotel accommodation is very convenient, and it is within walking distance from the Teddy Bear Museum. Both hotels are good, but prefer the Ritz. First of all, the service is thoughtful. The waiter went directly to Renaissance to carry our luggage to the Ritz and gave small gifts to the children. Secondly, the decoration is luxurious and high-grade, and the mattress continues the high quality of Ritz, which is very comfortable. There are many activities for children to experience, golf, hockey, etc. The only downside is that the swimming pool is outdoor, and it will be a bit cold when there is no sun. The breakfast is rich and delicious. Finally, I would like to commend Mr. Li Owen, the duty manager, for giving us a very thoughtful guide to our journey. This time I came to Mission Hills and felt that there were not many people and it was very comfortable. I will come again in the future.

When I checked in, I said that I couldn’t stay online for the second night. The other party told me that there would be no refund. Because the salesperson did not agree to the refund and did not give me a refund, so Ctrip could not handle it. I called Hainan 12315 to complain about the slaughter of foreign tourists, and 12315 also told the hotel that I would not refund. If I am really dissatisfied, I will sue the hotel. I can only let my friends check in. The biggest problem is that the room that the hotel gave is a connecting room. There is a door that leads to the next door. The room endangered her life safety and complained to the front desk. The front desk actually refuted my friend saying that I stayed the night before and there was no accident, which proved to be safe. Finally, my friend said that I couldn't bet on the probability, and I had to report it to the police. In the end, the hotel felt that I didn't I took care of it and returned the room to us. I want to say that the hotel is really rubbish. Even if the price is expensive, the service is poor. The typical slaughter is counted as one, especially for foreign tourists. The kettle is also very dirty.

msg:Had to give a bad review, because I really feel so angry 😡
Let me talk about check-in first, because there is a lot of luggage and it is placed in the Renaissance Concierge. The younger brother of the Renaissance Concierge said to help me call and ask a Ritz colleague to help me send it to me. Wait and wait... Can't wait, ask Renaissance Brother, brother said that the Ritz concierge said that it was too busy and no one came over. As a last resort, the little brother Wanli helped send the luggage to Ritz. Check-in went smoothly. Only after moving in, the problem came again. After turning off all the lights at night, I found that the wardrobe lights were not off. As long as I had a little light, I couldn’t sleep well. So I got up and called the switchboard at 11:28. As a result, I made two calls and no one answered (because of the first No one answered the phone, the second time I called, I did the whole video upload limit of 30 seconds, if you need to verify, I can provide) faint, the third time someone answered the phone, told me that it needs repair, did not tell me how long the project I just waited for nearly 20 minutes. Finally, when I was about to give up the repair, the engineering depar**ent came and said that it might take some time to change the light. My appeal is that it doesn’t light up. It’s easy for me to open the closet. The operation is really not bright, I think I can sleep peacefully at last. As a result, lying on the bed, I found a super active alarm clock on the bedside table ⏰ every second I walked can affect my heartstrings 😭 helplessly, remove the battery. When I washed my hair and used a hair dryer the next morning, it was so dirty that I suspected that I had stayed at the Express Hotel, but the air volume was still big enough.
This bad review does not necessarily cause the hotel to pay attention to it, but I sincerely hope that your service is worthy of this signature!

The Leeds bed would not have the room facing the golf course. Taishun is more convenient to go to the airport. It can be used as a place to stay on the first and last day. The room has bartenders, capsule coffee machines, and tea sets, which I have seen are particularly complete. There are a lot of things for breakfast. Eggs Benedict are well made, and the yolks are just solidified.

msg:A very poor experience. When I stayed in the Spring Festival, I didn't give a temperature reminder in advance, so that I came to the summer and it was cold and windy and rainy, and the whole was stunned. Communicate with the hotel to extend the check-in or check-out to no avail. It was obvious that there were children staying, but no children's supplies were prepared, so they brought children's supplies after repeated urging. Staying for 6 days, the room hygiene is very different every day. The toothbrush cup has no cleaning traces in the morning and evening. The obvious toothpaste traces are still toothpaste traces. I am really speechless. The daily toiletries are not updated, and there is no welcome fruit. The room has nothing but water Everything has to be charged, this is the first time I have encountered a five-star hotel so stingy. The breakfast was a mess. The breakfast that ended at 10:30 went to 9:30, and many dishes were gone, and no waiter added them in time. There were very few dishes, and it was not a star and a half worse than the hotels in Sanya. The children's playground and the golf course outside can be described as a miniature. The golf course in the Mission Hills Hotel in front is 10 times larger than the price here and only half the price here. The room construction is also very old, and the parts of the toilet have fallen off by themselves... I feel that this hotel can't match the Marriott's five-star standard at all, and it can't compare with the Marriott chain in a small county. Really live a fake five-star. Very, very poor hotel, will never come again. It is recommended that everyone at the same price is not as good as the Westin in the city, or the nearby Mission Hills. Facilities are too rubbish

Location: Mission Hills, a few kilometers away from Feng Xiaogang Studios.
Supporting facilities: There is a Mission Hills Duty Free Shop downstairs. If you can't buy anything, you can still eat and eat.
Facilities and equipment: Ritz-Carlton normal level. Decoration is still possible.
Breakfast: The Ritz-Carlton is normal and can only be said to be gorgeous. In fact, I prefer an ordinary five-star breakfast.
Children: There is a separate children's playground, this. The swimming pool is for adults, and children can play casually.
Comprehensive: That is to experience a high-end hotel, the overall is more compelling, the details are good, suitable for taking pictures and punching cards. Really say comfort, and breakfast taste, normal five-star level. I have eaten the Ritz-Carlton lunch buffet in Nanjing before, which is a place to check in and take pictures. In the swimming pool and afternoon tea, I saw some people taking pictures, and some people took the photographer to take pictures~

Traveling by car in Hainan, it is very convenient to rent a car in Haikou. After leaving the airport, rent a car on the 9th floor of the parking building and drive to Dad Tea. After lunch, I bought milk tea from a roadside shop and drove directly with my wife for 3 hours and 260 kilometers. Westin Bay Greentown, the environment is very beautiful, the photos and videos are posted in another Westin review, they are all from the Marriott depar**ent, and they are all very satisfied.
In Lingshui, I drove to Wanning, Yanzidong, Riyue Bay, and Didadao. I drove more than 1,000 kilometers in 4 days. The weather is too hot to drive by yourself. It is really the best choice.
Driving back to Haikou from Lingshui, 240 kilometers, 3 hours, there was a typhoon and heavy rain on the road, it was still very dangerous, the old driver was not afraid, the weather in Haikou was very beautiful.
The location of Ritz is in Mission Hills Tourism Resort. It is quite convenient to drive. There are no people in the underground parking lot. I am afraid that it will stop underground if it rains. This is convenient. It feels that there are few people in the off-season, and it is good. The gift golf is not played. , The cocktails presented are so delicious. On the 20th floor of the hotel, the hotel upgraded the ordinary room type to a high-floor view golf deluxe room. It was very good, the breakfast was not many, and the quality was good. After eating for 3 days, I basically ate it all Yeah, it’s still delicious. Next time I go to Haikou, I should choose Ritz.
Ritz is Ritz, and it must be Ritz, that is, Ritz.

I used to lock the door at night. I didn’t see the wake-up breakfast when I woke up at 8 o’clock. The operator said impatiently, you locked the door, so I didn’t send it. I said why I didn’t call and said to call Yes, we only call once, if no one answers, we won't call. This tone of voice is no one. Co-authoring is because I affected your work.

我定的時候看好的五歲及以下小童自助餐免費，前台告訴我不確定早餐的問題，讓我辦會員才能送一個早餐。我？？？
我又找的訂單查得，確實是免費的。如果不帶早餐我肯定會在訂酒店的時候提前給孩子買一份。
房間是聯通房，為了又折騰換的房間。
衹訂了一晚，為了第二天坐飛機，但也不想孩子住太差。真的不會再住了。這次去海南，住了三亞灣的海居鉑爾曼、海棠灣仁恆和天房洲際，真的都比這家好。
以上是我個人觀點。但早餐孩子説不好吃，老公也覺着不好吃，還覺着我踩雷了，都要走了為啥定這麼差的。這個價格都能住三天鉑爾曼了，真不便宜好嗎。

設施：住了一天，體驗了餐廳、泳池，泡了房間裏的浴缸，浴缸有服務員專門來做消毒。還很喜歡泳池，晚上有燈光有月光，負責泳池的林肯也很友善，聽説我們第一次來海南，臨走時和我們分享了好多環島小眾景點。
整體來説入住很愉快，謝謝工作人員們，有機會還會來住。

msg:服務滿分，唯一失望的是原先告知升級行政禮遇的晚餐套餐因為當天是週五變成了意大利餐廳的自助晚餐。作為一個曾在意大利讀書的人，這個餐廳的自助晚餐和中午的粵菜餐廳真的不能比，很不專業，也不好吃。

衞生大致可以，小細節還有待提升，但房間黴味明顯，即使18樓，備品類的紙盒明顯的黴味。

牙刷梳子這類的東西實在是太差，不該是麗思卡爾頓的水準，快捷酒店現在也不用這種牙刷了吧。塑料梳子拆開就斷掉3根齒。

不過整體服務水平在線，m

酒店早餐我挺喜歡的，中午天龍軒味道超讚，晚上得flair味道也是很棒的。

PS：整體很喜歡，就是離市區遠，打車要半個小時才能到市區。如果想來打高爾夫的話，可以忽略這個小缺點！

msg:有幾點需要吐槽一下，希望酒店改進提升。
1.洗手間的鏡子擦的不乾淨，自然也不夠明亮，這一點的確不應該出現。
2，沖水馬桶聲音實在太大了，真的就像拖拉機一樣的聲音，不如一些高端商場裏的馬桶。
3.房間電視衹能調台，沒有辦法觀看網絡電視。
4，必須要改進的是早晨的自助餐實在是太難吃，如同嚼蠟一班，所有品類都是，完全沒有該有的味道和香氣。水果更是難吃的要命，不知道酒店從什麼途經採購，也不知道對於採購食材有沒有一個嚴格的標準，難吃的程度實在無法接受。
5.所謂的特色項目高爾夫果嶺推桿根本就是欺騙，根本不是果嶺推桿，就是大堂旁邊一個小草坪而已，十分敷衍。
6.酒店前台辦理入住全程一臉冰霜，完全不符合高端酒店的服務標準。
衞生：差
設施：馬桶像沖水聲音拖拉機
服務：差
欺騙：店內高爾夫球果嶺草坪推桿體驗1次
總結：除了價格和裝修符合豪華型酒店以外，服務，衞生以及餐食和入住項目無一符合。

msg:麗思卡爾頓的行政樓層一直很不錯，海口這間也不例外，裝修雖不算很有特色，一如既往的經典歐式裝修，房間衞生情況也算到位，符合麗思卡爾頓的一貫標準。
行政樓層的格調很高雅，是一個可以多待的地方，服務員相當熱情，這個讓人很驚喜，很暖心！
餐食酒品不過不失，不算特別！不過畢竟房價不像三亞那邊高，這個也可以接受。
唯一不太好的地方是，行政酒廊的運作時間是十二點到晚上九點，太短，太不便了，尤其晚上，九點太早，不但不提供服務，也不能在那裡坐，這個在其他行政酒廊沒有的情況，希望能調整。

早餐還行，不過不明白海南那麼多好水果，為什麼酒店反而沒有利用這個優勢，椰子木瓜芒果這些當地很便宜很多也很受歡迎的東西反而沒有！

總的來説，服務確實很好，其他可以做的更優秀吧！

但是衞生確實很一般，房間因為下飛機過度沒太在意，凌晨到達電梯裏的不明物體第二天退房都還在，應該能説明問題

問題，1.兩次入住，訂的都是高爾夫景觀房，都是給的邊角落的房子，視野很不好，當天晚上申訴，不過很快就解決了，不愧這個品牌。2，早餐看起來也還好，但是服務員的眼力見確實不夠，收餐盤不及時，兩天的觀察得出這個結論。3..晚上去酒吧消遣，一個女歌手在歌唱，基本上是喊喝，跟酒店的整體調性完全不搭。
總體評價還是不錯，值得再次光顧。
