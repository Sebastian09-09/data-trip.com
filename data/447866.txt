msg:The hotel environment is very good, with good greenery around, large rooms, and the overall style of the hotel is neo-Chinese. The facilities are not particularly new, but acceptable. It has all the necessary equipment for home use. Before leaving, I also gave my child a voucher for gifts in the lobby. The swimming pool is nice, with few people and clean. One thing I am not satisfied with is that there are too many mosquitoes at night. I got 4 bites and killed 5 of them. The next morning, I saw that it might be because the windows were old and the gaps were too large. I notified the housekeeping staff, and they took care of it and added mosquito repellent, but I was still bitten 2 times the next night.

msg:I booked the No.1 Yueju, and thought it was new and good in every aspect. I didn't expect it to be a low-end minimalist version... The floor suction of the room door and the toilet door fell off. There was no wardrobe or clothes rack in the room, and there was no condition to hang clothes! There were no refrigerators, bathrobes, and facial tissues that are common in star-rated hotels! ! ! The room price does not include swimming and fitness, which cost 38 yuan per person! I wanted to add a quilt, but there was only a blanket without a quilt cover! It was really surprising! 
In terms of service, they called me two days before check-in to ask what time I would arrive. I heard that it meant that they were afraid that I would cancel the order, so I told them, don't worry, they will definitely not cancel it, and then they didn't contact me later, and didn't provide any other information services. Then I asked them if they had a microwave, and they said they didn't let me ask the catering center, but later I found one used by employees in the building of their Yueju Hotel. 
I asked for an extra quilt, but it didn't arrive for more than an hour, and I only got it after asking about it, and it was just a blanket. . . My child said I can only give it two stars!

msg:1. I want to praise the environment of the hotel, which is really quite good. Flowers, gardens, and buildings, every time I see them, I have a different feeling. The children like the environment here, especially the ducks in the lake🦆
2. Let's focus on the room. The facilities are relatively old, and the hot water is very timely. This time I stayed in No. 1 Yueju. It is a three-story building, a bit far from the hotel front desk for check-in. Without luggage delivery service, it is not very convenient to walk. It is recommended to improve the service quality;
3. The room is poorly soundproofed. The children in the room opposite the wall next door shouted and shouted, and I heard them clearly. It was the Bubble Music Festival, and the people staying around came back late, and the mood was also very high, which was really annoying. I hope the hotel can increase soundproofing facilities and make some improvements;
4. The restaurant has fewer types of breakfast. If the room does not include meal coupons, it is 50 yuan for adults, but there are fewer choices. I also hope that the hotel can pay attention to it. But it is worth praising that the breakfast lasts for a long time and ends at 10 o'clock. The food is always new. I also want to praise the waiters. They are really hard during the May Day holiday.

After a few older sisters came in, they told us that there were no extra pillows, so let us make do with pillows. Asking them for two more bath towels and slippers, I am impatient, and ask me, what else do you want, tell me once, don't let her run again. I was a little surprised by the bad room service.
The other is that there are mosquitoes at night, but I still don’t use the mosquito coils, and I wake up after being bitten at night.

msg:Tianjin Binhai No.1 Hotel has a large area as a whole, with a royal garden building and a good environment in the entire park. With such good hardware conditions, the service has been flawed! The lobby is well decorated, but slightly deserted. The decoration of the room is quite satisfactory, and some hardware facilities are lacking. Like electric curtains and electric curtains, there is no even the most basic USB charging port! This is really outdated! Room hygiene is okay as a whole, some details are lacking! The air conditioner is noisy and the soundproofing is not very good! The whole is very different from the huge garden building and the meticulous garden layout! There are not many people eating in the Chinese restaurant, and there are welcoming guests to lead the way, which is not bad. The overall taste of the dishes is not bad, and the waiter's attitude is also very good! It's just that the variety of vegetables is lacking! The biggest problem is the elder sister of the cleaning service. The cleaning attitude is average and the missing items are not filled. Once again, remind me that the attitude is arrogant! After communicating with the hotel online, I didn't want to upgrade things when I came out to play, but in exchange, cleaning knocked on the door again! At first I didn't apologize, but later I felt that I was wrong, and it had affected my mood when I went out to play, so I apologized! That night, Manager Wang on duty contacted me to meet to find out the situation! His sincere attitude is worthy of praise. The next morning the room manager knocked on the door to apologize a day later! The attitude is still very sincere! It just makes me feel that it takes a long time to understand, communicate, and apologize when a problem occurs... These are really not solutions to the problem! Everyone staying in the hotel, what you want is the warm feeling of home! When a problem occurs, you should understand, communicate, and solve it as soon as possible, rather than some fruit drinks to deal with it! It will only make things worse, and damage the image of the hotel, as well as the original business philosophy of the hotel! The environment is given 5 stars, and you can see the intentions of the original construction! The service was given 4 stars, to the manager Wang on duty that day and the room manager who came later! Very satisfied with the handling of things, not satisfied with the timeliness and plan! Some perfunctory experience! It is not easy to understand that everyone's work is not easy, and I hope to use it as a warning! Everyone is in the service industry. First of all, we must lead by example. At the same time, we must manage our own affairs and communicate with employees in a timely manner, so that each employee can maintain a positive working attitude, love their own work, and improve their enthusiasm! When a problem occurs, you must listen, communicate, and deal with it attentively at the first time. Don't take credit for the experience and act!
I hope that the hotel can do better, with enhanced staff training, management, and room hardware facilities... Don't forget the original intention!
Have the opportunity to experience again! Hope to learn both internally and externally

但是，晚上11點多入駐，在酒店主樓旁邊的充電樁充電，第二天早上被奪命call叫醒，是外面的出租車司機要充早上的平價電，嘴巴還很不乾淨。
問題這裏不是在酒店外面的充電樁，也問過酒店前台能不能停那，充完電後放那，回覆説可以，感覺這種低素質的人也能隨便出入，還把酒店的場地當自己的的，拉低了對酒店的好感。

司機要挪車客氣點就算了，我下去挪車了還在那**賴賴。
這些個出租車司機住你們酒店了嗎，就這麼橫？？就這麼對住店的客人？就在前台旁邊！

希望加強管理吧，否則這次沒打起來，下次打起來了出了啥事，酒店也要付連帶責任。

夜裡21點45到店，大堂亂糟糟，圖片是站我前面的，排我後面的比這還多，“你是在哪個平台訂的？”“哦，**的，我們現在看不到**訂單，你等一下哈”然後就看見服務員拿着手機噼裏啪啦打字，那麼多人排隊等着，是不是能有工作人員讓**訂單單獨排一條隊，特殊辦理一下呀？讓所有人都等着確認好**的訂單，到10點半好不容易等到我了，聽到前台電話一直響不停，缺這個的，要換房的，還有一個説一樓房間潮，被子都快滴水了，要換房，不好意思，2-3樓都住滿了，換不了房了。最後也是給了我一個1樓的房間。
1樓就1樓吧，這麼晚了，湊合一晚得了。
進了房間，摸了摸床單被罩，確實潮乎乎的，像剛洗完沒曬乾的那種感覺，不管了，就想早點睡覺，讓老大先洗澡，洗完説關不了水龍頭，因為熱水鈕太燙了，我嘗試去關，果然燙手，算了，我洗吧，別關了，洗到一半，砰的一聲，花灑頭崩掉了，正好砸我腦袋上，打仗似的趕緊沖沖，衞生間已經水漫金山了，出來給前台打電話，佔線，好不容易打通了，沒有一絲歉意，“那我讓工程部人員去看看吧”，過了15分鐘，沒人來，我生氣了，又給前台打電話，讓負責同志來，過了一會，來了一位女同志，看了看衞生間，問了問有沒有受傷，當時已經夜裡11點了，我衹想讓小孩儘快洗澡儘快睡覺，最後女同志説給換房，十分鐘後，拿了房卡，換到了3樓。
到了3樓，進了房間，霍，那個熱，要是再換房不知道又到幾點了，趕緊洗洗睡吧，老大老二因為熱的翻來覆去到凌晨3點，最後困得實在不行了，一夜沒蓋被子。
用我老公的話説，這家是不是快乾不下去了？誰知道呢？！

總體還是值得來休閑度假的！

msg:先説好的。
停車很方便，有特來電的樁（很奇怪高德app上查不到）。酒店是個大院子，自帶園林，時間關係沒來得及轉轉，晚上來的時候已經完全黑了看不見，早上走的時候遠遠看着有亭子有假山有水，應該不錯。
大床是真的大，2.4m寬度吧，真大。
看介紹有游泳池和温泉，游泳池好像還是50米的，這是真奢侈，可惜沒來得及體驗。
服務態度還是挺好的。
其他方面對得起五星標準。
再説不好的。
不知道是不是我運氣不好，居然有段時間沒有熱水，雖然後麪恢復了，但是直接導致孩子晚睡了一個多小時，這個體驗很不好。而且恢復之後水温其實一直也不高，得開全熱水才能洗澡。前台小姐姐特意上門道歉，態度是好的，可是她也解決不了問題，光道歉也沒用啊。

總體來説，就這個不到半價的價格而言，性價比超高，可以無腦選，非常值得推薦。下次帶個泳衣來試試游泳池。

服務：服務也不錯，園區裏安排了很多表演，唱歌、相聲等；
設施：有不少小童遊玩的設施、還有咖啡機很好賣得也便宜，多人自行車也挺好的；
衞生：一般般，房間裏衞生條件不是很好，浴缸不太敢用，牆紙很多處起皮的；
餐食：這個比較次，早餐裏的吃的幾乎全部是買的成品，麪包、牛角包、華夫餅一看就是達利園盼盼之類的，包子什麼的也是速凍食品，其他就不説了，吃的是真次。
整體來説算是比較滿意，主要是環境優美，景色宜人，停車方便，還有就是五一期間價格也沒有漲太多，比較良心。
