So later When We check out i asked to the receptionist     how come my baby can not use the pool. So she called to.the person In charge of the pool and he confirmed that a foreigner came with a baby But They told him "baby can not swim.alone ".  which at the end i believe there was a BIG COMMUNICATION PROBLEM.

I called the duty manager and he said the air conditioner was not turned on. It was actually natural wind. If the guest felt hot, they could provide electric fans or open the windows to sleep. I was shocked. Is this a knockoff Marriott Hotel? After all, it is a four-star hotel, but it is not even as good as a two-star hotel. I asked if I could apply to turn on the air conditioner and I would pay for the electricity. The reply was that it was not possible. It was not important for the guest to feel hot. What was important was that their management would only turn on the main switch of the air conditioner when they felt it was hot. I was completely speechless... I didn't sleep well that night... I blacklisted this hotel and will never come again

The hotel is really showing its age and needs to be updated in all aspects. The bath water is very small, and the hair dryer is also very old-fashioned. The bolt was still not tight and needed to be held on by hand. Can you imagine that after taking a shower, I was drying my hair with one hand and holding the socket with the other. I asked them to replace it the next day, but it was not much better. To be honest, even the all-season room accessories next to it were not. All better than Marriott.
Also, I didn’t get extra breakfast this year because I didn’t book it on Marriott’s official website, okay?
What's commendable is that the waiters I met in the restaurant during breakfast were all very nice. Everyone would take the initiative to say hello. Also, thank you for the humidifier sent to the room!

When I go to make invoices or ask questions, there is only one guest in front of me, and there are three people at the front desk. The front desk was watching from the side. When I asked for service, the front desk watching next to me asked me to wait for the guest in front of me to finish the process and then wait for the front desk to do it for me.

The staff I met were polite and conscientious, and they tried their best to help solve the needs and difficulties. For example, the handsome guy JARED at the front desk, the security guard and foreman at the door, Xiao Wang in the guest room and the breakfast staff. Here, I would like to especially thank Xiao Zheng in the executive lounge and the brother in the concierge depar**ent. Let me talk about the brother in the concierge depar**ent. He accompanied us on the two inspections, and patiently introduced the functions of the room every time. guide. Let’s talk about Xiao Zheng. On the afternoon of the check-in day, I went to the executive lounge for afternoon tea. I wanted to eat apples. When Xiao Zheng saw it, he peeled the apples for me and handed them to me.

It's very unpleasant when there is no response when adjusting the temperature at night. When the maintenance guy came, he kept pressing the button until the temperature dropped. There is no menu booklet in the room, it has to be delivered after calling. Return the menu book at the end of the meal. A few hours later, I knocked on the door at night and brought the menu again, saying that he was not responsible for taking it away. When booking the hotel, Ctrip specifically checked for check-out at 2:00, and called me at 12:20 to ask me to leave. I asked her to help me check if there was a note in the background. I was at 2 o'clock. The girl had a very, very bad attitude and said no. She replied to me instantly and said no. Have you seen it? The front desk has a bad attitude and the hair dryer is very difficult to use. , the button cannot be pressed, and the socket is easy to fall off.

However, after I extended my room for a long time, there were mistakes in the guest room and the front desk that should not have occurred. First, the front desk called the room at around 3 o'clock while I was sleeping to ask if I had extended my room. Then twice, a waiter directly swiped the door card. I opened the door and came in twice. I extended the room just so that the baby could sleep more in the room. I had to go to the front desk to go through the formalities manually in the morning. I was speechless that such a problem could occur. I hope it can be improved so that it doesn’t affect Marriott’s reputation.

When the car arrives at the hotel door, the security guards will watch you carry your luggage there and don’t even move. Immediately blocked the door to check the code, I really wanted to scold people, the hotel service staff saw the guests as if they had seen a virus, they ran fast, the front desk opened the room in a pretentious name, saying that they were afraid of infecting the guests, I stayed for three days and they didn't come into the room to clean, I stayed in the hotel for three days, and no one greeted you with a big hello. I feel that the service of more than 100 Home Inns is not as good. The hotel asks the guests to put the garbage at the door every day, and puts the toiletries in a bag at the door to call you It's really funny to take it in by yourself. I'm afraid that the guests will be afraid of being like this. Marriott really knows how to play. The experience is really bad. I probably won't live again in this life.

If the person is cold, you can turn off the air conditioner in the room. If the heat cannot be cooled, please tell me that the switchboard is closed! 3⃣️ It is said that the ventilation system is turned on, but there is no sign of ventilation in the closed air conditioner outlet of the room. 4⃣️Coordinator brought a cooler, but the noise was too loud and the effect was not good. At this time, it was around 10:30. I called the front desk again and asked the front desk to turn on the air conditioner. The reply said that the switchboard will be delayed for 2 hours. OK, then you Turn it on, the air conditioner didn't respond all night, and the room air conditioner was still unavailable until six or seven in the morning! ! ! 5⃣️I have never encountered such a hotel before! fool! cheat! Malicious delay! ! ! The hotel facilities stated that there is air conditioning, but it is not available! ! Finally, the plan to find the engineering depar**ent to turn on the air-conditioning switchboard was given. At 10:30 in the evening, he said that he would wait for two hours. The key is that this is a malicious delay! is not turned on! No! ! !
Finally, let's ask a five-star hotel that even the air-conditioning facilities in the rooms are useless. The hotel management uses delaying customer demand to achieve deception and deception. Who else wants to live? ! (Picture and text are irrelevant)

It is particularly uncomfortable to go to the toilet. Isn’t it incredible that a five-star hotel room does not have a bathtub? The drain in the shower room smells great, just like a cheap express hotel. Fortunately, the smell can't come out with the bathroom door closed, so I can bear it. I went out for a meeting at 8 o'clock in the morning, and returned to the room at 12 o'clock at noon. The room had not been cleaned, and I had to remind the waiter to clean it as soon as possible. If you are not for meetings in this hotel, you must not stay in such a hotel. More than 800 nights is really not worth it.

msg:At five o'clock in the morning, we had a happy dinner and returned to the hotel to wash and sleep. It didn't take long for the manager on duty to knock on the door and ask us to change the room. The reason was that there would be another team staying in this room that afternoon and asked us to change the room immediately. In my heart: What? now? ? ? It's five o'clock in the morning? ? ? When I raised a question, I said that even if this room is booked out next, and the row room is reserved for other people, it should not be at this time. It is more than five o'clock in the morning. When I was resting, I asked us to change the room. Even if we need to communicate, it should be that we have to renew the room at noon to discuss this matter. As a result, the leader of the hotel that night, a man named ADAM, threatened us directly when he didn’t agree with him. His attitude was very brutal and bad. We must change rooms immediately. I couldn’t believe that this was actually a five-star hotel staff. Professional service literacy. So everyone wrangled on the matter until 7 or 8 in the morning, during which Mr. ADAM pushed a staff member to negotiate with us, and then ran away on his own. This way of handling I also found it very novel. I later gave in and said let us have a good rest today, because I haven’t slept all night, and I’m very tired and need to sleep. I will move tomorrow. There are so many rooms on the first floor. It’s not impossible to turn around, but the hotel just disagrees and says it’s because of us. I was not in the room at night and couldn't contact us, so we "notified" us as soon as we came back, meaning that if we were in the hotel that night, we would be evicted that night. How ridiculous, the room was assigned by you from the beginning. I checked in normally and let us move for no reason. The attitude was still very bad and I couldn't accept it anyway. It seems that you are not spending money to stay in a hotel, you are spending money to be scolded. I didn't feel the warmth of any kindness in this place. In the end, we compromised and slept for two hours and got up to move the room. The hotel did not have any explanation or compensation measures. The indifference of the staff was eye-opening. I will complain about rights protection to 12315 in the future. Although my strength is weak, I can't let a hotel like a hotel bully its customers. This is the first time I have encountered such a thing after staying in so many luxury hotels. I was stunned. Can't understand the hotel's approach. completely lose hope. (There is recording and monitoring of the communication process, so that the hotel boss will not recognize it)
Finally, I would say that this hotel has not been open for a short time, the facilities are outdated, the hardware is aging, and the service can't keep up, it will be even worse. I was asked to move my room at five o'clock in the morning. Are you crazy or am I crazy?

msg:The hardware conditions of the hotel are very good, but the service is really not flattering. Today, I heard that there was a star in the hotel lobby who was curious to ask the room service staff. Subsequently, the hotel used the fire alarm as an excuse to let us move out of the room. I want to say that there are friends living on the same floor. I hope that the room can be arranged on the same floor. The hotel has no excuse for all rooms on the same floor. All room types are not available. I am asked to move to another floor. I am also asked to let my friend and I move out of the floor. After communication, Reply to the same floor after a few minutes, during the time there was a problem going in and out of the room, the room service staff seemed to be watching the prisoners, every time the door opened it was definitely a sight to see all the staff, which was very uncomfortable
It's disappointing to be able to meet such a 5 star hotel in Shanghai Marriott, and even more disappointing to be treated like this as a Marriott member.

I was so angry that I couldn't help but open the wheat. I didn’t have breakfast at the hotel on the first night. I don’t know the situation of the breakfast. The next day I ordered it today. It’s absolutely amazing. It’s the first time I saw the breakfast with the original price of more than 200. It’s ice. My stomach hurts 20 minutes before driving. I squatted in the toilet and got diarrhea as soon as I got into the car.

msg:7月就去實體看了，當時Nicole接待的我們，給我們看了一下酒店的套房、標間，本來是沒有想定這個酒店的，因為結婚當迎親婚房，感覺酒店還是不夠新，一直在糾結。但是對比了其他酒店人員的服務態度，就覺得Nicole很讓我安心，所以我們提前就在攜程上做了預訂。實際上，入住和迎親那2天也確實因為Nicole的給力，各種協調讓我們一切都很順利，讓我少操心，很滿意。
以後可能衹有紀念日才會去住了，畢竟好貴的。

msg:服務態度非常一般，前台人員沒有問候語，沒有打招呼。

一位女性前台戴着口罩向我反覆橫眉冷對，我不懂為什麼。

可能是因為我穿着拖鞋check-in?如果是這樣，希望前台端正服務態度。

浴室設施差，地漏活動不穩；水温過高和過低衹需要輕鬆碰一下旋鈕；手持花灑水管連接處漏水。

msg:I am Sorry but i have to write a complain. Du to sudden emergency I had to leave the hotel straight after the check in. I barely spent few minutes and used only the bathroom to wash my hands, I didn’t even touch the towel, but Reception refused to return me the room charge. I think it was totally exaggerated. I asked at least a part of it, but they turn me down. I know there are rules but they could have been more flexible considering the time I spent in the room (I didn’t even touch the bed and other amenities)
