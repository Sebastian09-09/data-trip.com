msg:The stay at Langham was excellent! We dropped many of our packages at the hotel, and they were collected properly. The location is very convenient, as it is between two malls, so you have a lot of food and recreational options. 

The hotel's Swimming pool is superb! It is standard 25m long, has constant temperature control, and has sauna and steam facilities. The gym is also well-equipped. 

Regarding the room, I hope that the hair dryer will be upgraded to a better brand or series.

msg:This is the 2nd time I am writing this review. Seems Trip.com or this hotel have managed to scrub my first 1-Star review. 

The location, staff, and basic facilities of the hotel are fine. The issue is the air conditioning. Our room was HOT at night. 27~28c (82f) and there was no way to adjust the temperature from the air conditioner controls. The front desk was unable to help us, saying that room temperatures are centrally controlled. So there was nothing they could do. 

We spent two nights sweating like crazy. Our 3-year old boy suffering and unable to sleep. If we wanted to cook in a sauna, we would have gone to the spa. 

I normally do not write negative reviews. But this is the second time we've had a bad stay at a Langham hotel. First in Shanghai and now this terrible experience in Xiamen. 

Never staying here again.

msg:I had experienced the Langham Lounge by chance before, and I was amazed. There are really few Marriott and Hilton hotels in Xiamen on the island, and most of them have been stayed there. This time, I made up my mind to book the Langham Executive Room.

The toilet in the first room had some problems. After discovering it, I asked the front desk to change it. It is worth praising that the wifi login information verification was synchronously changed to the new room number, and there was no bug of delayed processing. I just came back from a trip abroad, and I think it is rare that there is no bug. Give a thumbs up here.

The dishes in the executive lounge are actually cost-effective, and some suggestions on product selection have been made on the spot. There is nothing to say about the drinks, full of sincerity💯.

Special praise for the service of the executive lounge, special attention to user experience, and asking for dish suggestions. This is something I have never encountered in other hotels in Xiamen. Thanks to Silvia+Eva+Nicole on duty for their kind and thoughtful service.

I will definitely stay again

Manager Jamie was very enthusiastic It is a great pleasure to help provide room reservations. Next time we will recommend relatives and friends to stay at Langham Place Hotel when they travel to Xiamen.

msg:When I was in Shenzhen, I really liked the style and service of Langting. The main color of pink really makes people feel good. The service in Shenzhen is really impeccable. This is the first time I choose Langting outside the province. The hotel decoration is not as British as Shenzhen, but it is also a modern decoration style of a luxury first-line hotel, and the service is still full marks. I came to Xiamen with my girlfriend and encountered some problems when booking a room, but the front desk lady helped us solve it very quickly. I would like to praise Miss Kitty here. She is beautiful and thoughtful. My first impression of Xiamen from her is enthusiasm. Knowing that this is our first time in Xiamen, she also gave us a notebook and bookmarks as a souvenir, which really made me feel very good. When I went out to play today, I would call to ask if I needed to clean the room. I respect the privacy of guests. I always feel that Langting is not the most luxurious, but it has always been the most popular in my heart, because of the details, really too much details.

Later, the concierge staff was still concerned about me but didn’t get on the bus and said they could come around to pick me up. I didn’t see anyone but still made me feel taken care of. Attached screenshot , please praise the relevant personnel, thank you!
2. The guest rooms are spacious, with proper circulation planning and space utilization. The TV channels have a wide selection of programs, and the toiletries provided in the bathroom are very good. Only the central air conditioning in the room seemed to be unable to be adjusted, and the lighting in the corridor on the floor was slightly dim.
3. Located next to Wanda Plaza and China World Trade Center, it is very convenient for shopping and dining. There are many choices. The traffic is good, there is a bus stop downstairs. It takes about 20 minutes to walk from the subway entrance, but it is very convenient to take a taxi now, and you can also ask the concierge for assistance, so it is not a big problem.

msg:This time, I traveled to Xiamen with my parents and children and stayed at Langham Hotel. Overall, I was very satisfied.
Before checking in, the butler Pearl took the initiative to call and ask what other requirements there were for checking in and what time the hotel was. She and her colleague Mila helped coordinate adjacent rooms because they needed to be next to my parents so that they could take care of each other.
The receptionist at the door took the initiative to open the door of the car and take the luggage. They were all quite enthusiastic. The room is quite large, and the bathroom and toilet area is also quite large. There is a large floor-to-ceiling window and a sofa. If you are not too tall and want to sleep alone, you can sleep on this sofa. The double beds can be spliced. What I like most is the bed guard. For a child who is not honest when sleeping, I can finally sleep more peacefully.
There is a thoughtful welcome handwritten by the butler Pearl. The drinks and chips in the small refrigerator are free to eat, and they are replenished once a day for free.
Because each room has two breakfasts, my eldest child, who is 14 years old and over 1.4 meters tall, asked the butler and said that the morning buffet breakfast can be discounted at 80 yuan. This price is acceptable. In the end, because there are many snack bars next to the hotel, one adult did not go to the buffet, so the money was saved.
The cleaning lady was also considerate. She wrote a paragraph by hand, saying that she saw medicine on our table and gave us several more bottles of water.
Let me talk about some minor flaws that I think are common. In fact, this should be a common problem, including the Westin Wanning where I stayed before, as well as five-star hotels in Nanjing, hotels in Sanya, etc., that is, the cleaning problem. After all, it is manually cleaned, and there must be omissions. The reason why I brought it up is that I still hope that the cleaning work can be done better during non-peak periods. Just like smiley faces, caring cards, food, etc., these soft services are liked by customers, but I think if a hotel has good cleaning work, I will like it more even if there are no soft services.
The day before, the child ate potato chips in the room and got them on the carpet. The next day, the aunt did not clean it up. There were potato chips that were not cleaned up in the space between the sofa and the bed. Later, I picked them up and threw them away. There was dust inside the two small towel racks in the bathroom. It must have been there for a long time. I wiped off the light layer, but the dark layer could not be wiped off. On the first day of my stay, I wiped the toilet with a wet wipe. I found a circle of black stains around the circular joint where the toilet lid was lifted up. I wiped it off with a tissue. Overall, Langham is still very good, with some minor flaws. I hope it can be improved. I prefer this hotel when I come to Xiamen in the future.

Due to the adjus**ent of the booking schedule, I am very grateful to mila, ava, and pearl for their coordination. Thanks to pearl for upgrading the room and arranging the good night beauty dessert. Thanks to service ambassador mandy. I feel like I am the best actress receiving the award from TVB hahahaha. It happened that I met Miss Pearl before departure. She gave me cookies to eat on the next morning when I caught the flight, as well as beautiful little gifts. The hardware and software services of the hotel gave me a very good experience. Love you.

They were close to the Wanda business district and far away from the attractions. Xiamen Island is not big, so everything was fine! I would like to make a suggestion. Nowadays, more and more people are traveling with children during the winter vacation. Can the hotel add meals for three people? It is only for two people, and the children alone have to pay! This is a bit inconsiderate.

The location is good, the surrounding area is very new, the road is large and green, with Wanda on the left and Yintai on the right, but it is not noisy. During the May Day period, it does not feel crowded, and the children also like it very much. The service is above 100 points. I am a person who cares about the layout and environment of the room. The pictures on Ctrip are not very clear. I just wanted to have a brief understanding on the phone. After the staff added WeChat, they probably transferred to the room and took a video. For me, this is the first time in my many years of staying in a hotel. I would like to praise una and pearl who I met this time, as well as the unknown staff I met in the lobby, restaurant, and administrative corridor. Their service attitude is better than that of international chain five-star hotels. I hope to meet you again next time I go to Xiamen. .

Although it has been updated, the feeling has not changed👍~ Would you believe it if I was attracted by this Langham Place Hotel and booked the hotel before grabbing the high-speed rail ticket? Downstairs is Wanda Plaza, which is convenient for eating and drinking. In less than 20 minutes' drive, you can reach the Xiamen Science and Technology Museum, which is popular with children, and check out real dinosaur fossils. Shixia is so convenient! Also, what makes the hotel shine is this Paddington🐻. It’s so cute that I took one home✌. And they have 🐻themed rooms, but it’s a pity that I was in a hurry and didn’t book them this time. I will continue to choose here next time I have a chance to come. There are so many reasons to like it❤️
In addition, special thanks to hotel service ambassador Fairy🌷
The brown sugar ginger glutinous rice balls were served to us. We were exhausted physically and mentally after returning from Gulangyu Island where a typhoon was about to come that day. The takeaway hadn't arrived yet, so we took a bite of the glutinous rice balls and it was so soft and glutinous that it filled our hearts. It was so happy🧡.
Gulangyu Island was closed in the early morning. We were really lucky~Thank you for the unrepeatable memories this trip brought me🌈.

Hygiene: 99 points can be scored, and the deducted point can also be made up by the hotel's active coordination. The water pipe connection of the hand-held shower head in the shower room is loose (I understand the reason). top spray nozzles. Due to the need to continue the stay the next day, the front desk staff actively coordinated and helped to change the executive floor, and actively arranged to deal with this kind of bad problem that may be left by the previous guests.
Environment: The sound insulation is not as good as expected. Sometimes you can hear the sound of people walking around in the house upstairs, and the sound of closing the door of the adjacent room on the same floor is relatively loud. This is a flaw and it is difficult to deal with. The rest of the overall environment is very good. There is a Wanda downstairs, which is very convenient. When ordering takeaway, the hotel will arrange staff or robots to deliver it to the room, which is very convenient for guests.
In addition, for some unknown reason, the housekeeping staff will not take the initiative to greet guests when they meet them in the corridor. It is the same as if they have not seen them. This situation exists on the 18th and 23rd floors, and the experience is not very good.
I hope that the hotel can strengthen the sound insulation in the next renovation, and it is best to be able to replace the shower with an integrated one connected to the water pipe to reduce such unhygienic situations.

The services of Dora at the front desk, service ambassadors Ruby and Somi are all in place.
During this outing, my foot turned, and I asked the service staff in the lobby if they could provide ice? The staff not only provided me with a large bag of ice cubes, but also kindly greeted me and reminded me "seek medical attention if you feel unwell". The most memorable thing for me is that when I checked out, the guy at the front desk (forgot his name) didn't forget to ask how my injury was.
This experience made me unforgettable and made me feel Langham Place's high-level service quality!

msg:I never write negative reviews, so today I’m going to talk about the place for breakfast. I stayed for four nights in total and had three disputes. The first time the egg rolls were broken, how can a five-star hotel make such things? I was shocked that the quality of the rice noodles was in the hands of customers. The second time I ordered rice noodles, I said hello three times and asked for a bowl of rice noodles but they ignored me. The third time I came for breakfast, our items and breakfast were already on the table, but they were still left. I put the food on the table, so I asked the waiter named ***. She directly answered me, "Put it here and don't move it." Then she shook her head with disdain and turned away. After that, she stayed next to me for the rest of the time. The staff is gesticulating. Is this the service quality of a five-star hotel? As for the room, I booked a parent-child room. How can I imagine that there are no children's toiletries in the room? The used toilet paper and toiletries in the room every day, if not replaced with new ones, are still the old ones. Although I booked four nights, changing them every day is what you should do, so I am really speechless!

In the era when the domestic high-end hotel industry generally declined in service standards due to rapid expansion, Langham Xiamen has always maintained a first-class service standard. From getting off the car at the entrance of the hotel to entering the room, and then to using the hotel facilities and services, I have been taken care of, but I have maintained an appropriate and comfortable social distance, and I don’t feel too deliberate. False, quick service response. The hardware facilities, catering, sanitation, gym and swimming pool are all very satisfactory. Special praise and thanks go to: Rosie, Ruby, Ava, Mila, Mariah, and other service staff in the cafeteria, executive lounge, housekeeping, front desk, luggage storage, and gym on the first floor.

msg:On my first night in Xiamen, I stayed at the British-style Langham Place in Xiamen. Before I even arrived at the hotel, I called the hotel in advance to ask when I would arrive and if I had any needs for the room layout. I was very impressed even before I checked in.

It was already 17:30 when I arrived at the hotel. It was a rainy day and the traffic jam made me a little motion sick. The guy who checked me in was kind enough to upgrade me to a suite for free and gave me a motion sickness sticker. The beautiful housekeeper Ella also helped me carry my bag and luggage all the way to the room. , the service is really 100 points.

Langham and Langham are both British-style hotels. Beautiful pink elements can be seen everywhere in the hotel lobby, such as pink roses, pink taxis, and pink bears. No girl can resist the temptation of pink. The hall is full of artistic elements, and the art installations everywhere make you feel like you are in a museum. Although it was only the end of November when I checked in, the Chris**as a**osphere in the hotel was already very strong. The huge Chris**as tree was beautifully decorated. I couldn't help but look at it every time I passed by the lobby.

As a business hotel, Langham Place does not have the same charming sea view as Xiamen Sea View Hotel, but you can take a taxi to Guanyin Mountain for 2.5 kilometers. There are not only cafes with great sea views, but also the best place to watch the sunrise in Xiamen, whether for business or tourism. In fact, the location is quite convenient. Next to it is Wanda, where you can eat, drink and have fun.

Although the room is not very luxurious, it is very clean, there are fresh green plants on the coffee table, and the decoration is very warm. The main European suite is very large, more than 80 square meters, with a color TV in the living room and bedroom, making it easy to watch the World Cup in different places at night. The bathtub is quite large and the "Sichuan" toiletries are very useful. The bed is a king-size bed and comes with 8 different types of pillows to choose from, which is good news for people who have trouble sleeping. It's very quiet to sleep at night, and the sound insulation is also very good. When you come back after dinner, the housekeeper Ella will serve you good night sweet soup. The meticulous service is really touching.

Apart from afternoon tea, the most unmissable thing when staying at Langham Place is the Michelin-starred restaurant Mingge. I have eaten at Mingge in Shanghai several times and the taste is outstanding. Business at Xiamen Mingge is also very good at night. The lobby is almost full. The ones are also very delicate and delicious. The bar on the first floor of the hotel has a World Cup co-branded wine package. You can drink and eat while watching the game on the huge screen, which is super cool and has a great a**osphere.

Since I arrived very late on the first day, I didn’t want to be too tired, so I didn’t go to the swimming pool and gym to check in. The breakfast snacks on the second day were delicious, overall

msg:Traveling to Xiamen, because of work and travel, I have been to Xiamen many times and stayed in many hotels. This time I chose Langham's executive room specially, wanting to experience Langham's service. We had an early flight, and we arrived at the hotel at about 9:30. We didn't expect to check in time, so we put down our luggage first, but our colleagues at the front desk, Rosie and Ella, quickly helped us check in and introduced the services at the administrative level carefully. Also give the children langham homemade biscuits, delicious 😍
We stayed in the hotel for two nights, the club is on the 25th floor, the same floor as our room. The happy hour is from 17:30 to 20:00 in the afternoon. On the first night, we had a buffet dinner. There was not much content, but it had a complete range of items, including wine and coffee, and we could satisfy our daily dinner. We had dinner out the next day and returned to the club for dessert and wine in the evening. During the 2 days, I saw the club colleagues Jamie and Ava busy in and out, taking care of the guests, and I could feel their intentions, hoping to improve the quality and brand image of the hotel with warm service.
When I was leaving, my colleagues at the front desk asked me how I felt about my stay. I said frankly: Langham's hardware may not be the latest, but the service is really heartwarming.
We also called room service a few times during our stay and they were very responsive. I go to the gym and swimming pool every day. The hygiene and service are worthy of praise.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first. After I had an unpleasant experience in this hotel, the room upgrade service promised by the hotel did indeed come true. And there was no excuse at all. The room facilities are okay, and the welcome fruit is also fresh.
Disadvantages: This is almost the worst experience I have stayed in a five-star hotel in the past few years. The room is very hot due to the western light. My wife and I still have difficulty falling asleep until four o'clock in the middle of the night. The linen on the pillow appeared Visible grime, as if dragged from linen closet (attached pics)
We went to the check-out front desk after four o'clock in the middle of the night and didn't apologize. I directly said that we had to change hotels to rest and she didn't say anything. I never thought that staying in a luxury hotel would cause me to worry about sleep . The lover's birthday is today, and this problem occurs, and the two of them are also very unhappy.
As a customer of Langham Place several times, I feel very disappointed.

Evian Mineral water, French sparkling mineral water, etc., 9 capsule coffees are provided, and the sanitary products are Langham's proprietary Sichuan brand. Unfortunately, the space for 2 people is too large, too wasteful and lonely! I can still enjoy the trea**ent of the executive lounge and have a buffet dinner on the 25th floor! Enjoy the delay to 4 o'clock trea**ent! All the staff are courteous, and the service is in place. It really has the taste of an old British aristocratic hotel!

msg:On a business trip to Xiamen, I stayed at Langham Place Hotel. The big teddy bear at the entrance is very eye-catching, but this is not the reason why I want to write a review. The main reason is that in addition to the clean equipment that a star-rated hotel should have, the service staff here are really warm Heart.
On the first day of check-in, because it was an early morning flight, I went back to the hotel after a busy day and fell asleep, and only ordered takeaways in the evening. I also went out early the next day and returned to the hotel in the evening. I received a call from the hotel staff, saying that I had dinner late the day before. Would you like to go to the executive lounge to experience it today? Kind service, the recommended radish and beef brisket soup is really rich but not greasy, I feel warm for starting a business alone, thank you Krystal and other service staff.
Before going to bed, I also served a bowl of red bean soup that is not too sweet. The service is warm, and I will come again next time. I hope the hotel can continue to maintain such service quality and enthusiasm.

Hygiene: In addition to the basic cleanliness, the housekeeping after the extended stay also helps to organize the sundries very neatly and carefully.
Service: Impeccable, the staff are ready to serve you before you speak

Small tip: The management of the breakfast room is very loose. From the production of breakfast meals to the service staff. Especially in the restaurant, there is a young manager in a black suit, which is relatively rude. At the time, she was making coffee for another customer and had been occupying the coffee machine at the door. I stood behind her and waited for about 5 minutes, she didn't even say "sorry" or other words, as if she didn't see it. This kind of unprofessional behavior should logically not appear on managers.

Booking through Ctrip includes two breakfasts, not only can you check in early (it is recommended to contact the hotel first to see if the room is ready), but also come with afternoon tea. In addition to afternoon tea, the lobby bar also has a wide variety of exquisite desserts and freshly squeezed juices. There is heat.

Hotel partner Ruby prepared a warm surprise for us. Langham Place bears, rose arrangement and welcome fruit plate are simple but not simple. More handwritten welcome card and hand-painted bear pattern, really full of sincerity. The room is on the 20th floor, very quiet. During the consultation service center and need more bath towels and toiletries, the room service staff on the floor can respond as soon as possible, and the turndown service also includes drinks and sweet soup, which can clear up the fatigue of the day, and the TV programs are free On-demand movies, there are many new blockbusters.

During the stay, I also experienced the E storage service of a golden key. The hotel concierge Wu Shan helped to store the luggage and items. After sending a QR code to the mobile phone, you can pick it up by yourself, eliminating the cumbersome registration of luggage tags. The hotel concierge colleagues are very special. Seriously, double-check and check the information and quantity.

The breakfast is very rich, and the chefs are working in full swing, whether desserts or freshly fried side dishes are continuously served, and there are also porridge and soup noodles to choose from. The gym on the fifth floor also has a full range of swimming lanes and rain saunas.

When we checked out, we saw Ruby himself, and when we saw the guests in front of us waiting in line, we took the initiative to put down our work to receive us, confirm consumption and bills, and did not forget to greet and consult the check-in experience. Ruby himself is super caring and warm, and is trustworthy. 's partner.

Super happy, next time I will experience Chuan SPA (it is said that the reservation is full), and the local tour can also be happy. Thank you Langham Partners.

The hotel is not new, but the location is good. After I arrived in the afternoon, I didn't eat, drink, and play at the hotel. Finally, I went to the spa for a facial trea**ent after swimming. The next time I come to Xiamen, it should be Langham Place. Thank you for the arrangement!

msg:🚗 Transportation: If you drive by car, it is more convenient to have a hotel free parking lot.
The hotel will remind you to register when you check out
🧹Hygienic: I don’t see anything too special, it feels pretty good, the old and new hotel is quite obvious, the feeling of 5-6 years is not new enough
🍃Environment: I personally like the high-rise smoke-free and sunny side. I am very satisfied with the room. If my friends like the scenic side, they think it’s so normal, which varies from person to person.
🔔Service: Not bad, there is a free swimming pool for swimming and fitness, and there is an artificial hot spring pool and dry and wet steam in the changing room. When consulting, I promoted massage by the way, and then it was a bit expensive to give up
I can choose a pillow that is comfortable for my own sleep. I am also very satisfied. It can be closer to the feeling of resting at home and ensure the quality of sleep.
The front desk phone will speak English first. There are a lot of foreigners in this hotel, who prefer to receive foreign guests and business feelings. It feels not suitable for me to travel like this. Those who just want to experience the experience as much as possible are as good as possible, because it is not delivered to help. The robot still didn’t enable the robot, and then I went down and took the bathrobe indecently. It was a bit embarrassing. The storage area was also a bit far away from the elevator. Of course, it may be my own problem. I can barely afford it, but my consumption thoughts may be a little bit. Can’t keep up, maybe the takeaway is not worthy of appearing in a five-star hotel

The network is very stuck. Only the workbench and bathroom in a room are smooth. The network in the breakfast restaurant is also not smooth, which causes the video call to be stuck and affects work. 2. Western-style bread and Chinese-style dim sum are all quick-frozen large-packaged and heated foods. The quality and selection are not satisfactory. It is more to enjoy a convenient and comfortable dining environment. 3. The price of the spa displayed in the room is misleading, and the price of the guests is higher than the group purchase price of Dianping.
In addition, the environment, service, and location are all good, the aunt who cleans the room is great, the above is for reference

酒店位置很好，去高鐵北站和機場都很方便。旁邊就是萬達廣場，吃飯很方便，當然如果有條件一定要試試酒店的餐廳明閣。
接觸到的工作人員都很有禮貌。尤其是賓客關係部的Pearl, 提前聯繫詢問喜好的房型並安排好，還幫忙升級了高樓層的房間，送了歡迎水果和minibar, 入住後也詢問是否需要夜間甜湯和延遲退房。
入住和退房都很迅速。房間寬敞舒適，設施齊全。早餐相比其他五星級酒店可能選擇稍微少一點，但出品的品質都很好。
來廈門幾十次，各種大大小小的酒店住過幾十家，這次真的是最好的一次體驗。下次再來廈門，我一定會再次選擇朗豪。

酒店房間不算大，但是房間裏該有的都有，隔音也不錯，這幾天都睡得很好。
這四天基本都在酒店裡吃早餐下午茶，享用歡樂時光，比景區小吃街的好吃多了。廈門的特色數得過來，不是薑母鴨就是蟲子做的各種食物，一般人也確實享用不來。出了酒店，餐廳的服務員基本上都是垮着臉，毫無服務態度可言，宛如我不是消費者，是他們**。我第一次去旅遊，待酒店不想出去了… 建議深圳人別去廈門，廈門的沙灘不如鹽田和惠州，食物不如潮汕地區，服務也不如深圳。

最後感謝club的工作人員 yuna yana fairy Ava 是你們給廈門加分了

週日的早上，酒店餐廳人太多了，水果也非常少，就幾個可憐的壞李子，最重要的是竟然沒有西瓜。這個季節沒有西瓜就很不正常，西瓜重度愛好者心痛，耿耿於懷。週一早上也沒有吃到西瓜。以至於週二的早上看到西瓜後，喜出望外，怒吃一大盆，拉肚子了。小事兒…

電視節目較新。體驗不錯。
房間燈光窗簾都是電動控制，很方便。
入住送甜湯也不錯。勺子可以用房間本來就提供的。
如有要求，響應很迅速。
外賣也能通過機器人送上房間。

第二天因為要趕晚上的飛機，還主動給延遲退房到下午四點。最讓我讚賞的是，工作人員真心讓客人體會到服務用心之餘沒有任何的套路，沒有一遍遍打電話要我給好評，我卻想給你們一個大大的贊👍👍。

酒店位置不錯就在萬達旁邊 整體環境也算高檔，但是重點來了！給了一個邊套房間這個沒事可能太多人了，進去設備陳舊然後燈也是壞的。叫了阿姨來了阿姨也不和你多解釋，就説總電源控制不了整個房間就是這樣的。可能阿姨也很無奈，退房到前台説了情況，衹是説感謝您的意見完全沒有處理。
大家自己看看吧，作為一個這樣檔次呢酒店。有點名不副實了。

整體我很喜歡這裏。一線服務成員與團隊國際五星水平的棒、投入與專業；餐飲也是一級的地道與美味，大推薦自助餐；喜歡游泳的我非常喜歡加温、夠大的泳池，三温暖和整體設計環境；房間與床也非常舒適像窩一樣。唯獨大問題是中央空調温度控制對一些客人還是偏熱難受，但團隊都在五星的盡力解決與滿足和調整。位置裏中心，舊區有距離，並非最理想，但廈門其實很小打車容易。整體算是廈門性價比與服務和國際水平（最重要❗️）最佳選擇之一。我會強烈推薦和再來。很nice！

msg:1.2022年2月初新年期間，有人嫌酒店的中央空調熱，酒店調低了温度，我又怕冷，酒店給我送來了加熱器，所謂眾口難調調眾口，朗豪服務細緻。
2.夏天廈門泳池酒店選擇多，但是冬天朗豪泳池是我心中的最佳。在五樓，陽光棚頂陽光可以照射到清澈的池水上，水温較高温暖。男洗浴換衣間有個港式熱池，建議大家泡一下，蒸出寒氣，不怕冬天。
3.朗豪為五緣灣，邊上就是萬達。其實廈門本島類比十公里半徑的圓，打車50元可以跑對角，所以還是酒店舒服權重更大。
4.四季的廈門，四季的景。朗豪客户關係部的mila以及所有員工都彬彬有禮，符合廈門性緩而善良的特質。我本來不想多贊朗豪，怕變火漲價，可是，我們不能辜負辛勤工作的老實人！

環境很好，入住時意外看到了工作人員打掃房間，可以説十分細心。屋內設施齊全。服務人員無論是一層餐廳還是行政酒廊，甚至包括保潔人員都很熱情。頂樓酒廊傍晚的落日很美。
酒店邊上就是萬達，還有核酸檢測點，疫情期間很方便。
特別感謝大堂的服務人員Tina，主動添加客人微信，服務熱情周到。
感謝酒廊的服務人員Jasmine，Ava，Anne，工作認真負責，細緻入微。
本次入住各方面體驗都很不錯。

下車有人幫忙及時拿行李，也會在下雨天幫忙拿雨傘，因為帶父母來體檢，做了腸胃鏡檢查，問了前台最晚幾點退房，前台小哥哥得知情況，貼心的告知，可以最晚時間的給我退房，很感謝。
很謝謝Mika的熱心引導和幫助～
