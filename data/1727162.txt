msg:Steal half a day of leisure! After checking in, I felt the feeling of being isolated from the real society and living a comfortable life. From the scenery to the decoration, it can be seen that the hotel owner should be a person who understands life, has feelings and taste.

Environment: quiet and comfortable, with green leaves.

Hygiene: clean and tidy (the details reflect the care).

Service: From security to gardeners, from check-in to restaurant service, it makes people feel at home. Every employee I met was polite and enthusiastic, with a smile.
Here I would like to especially thank the housekeeper Aunt Xue Meihua, who is professional, enthusiastic, careful and thoughtful, and thinks about what the guests think. It deserves another star in addition to the five-star praise!

What is rare is that no staff member will "ask" for good reviews from customers,
Everything follows the real thoughts of the guests. üëç

This place is very suitable for the whole family to come here for vacation and recuperation, and I will definitely come again later.

The service is also very considerate. Butler Fang will remind me of the breakfast time the next day on WeChat before getting off work. She sent me a message in the morning and took the initiative to apply for a late check-out service for me. Every aunt here is very enthusiastic and easy to communicate with, and feels like a neighbor.
In addition, there is a physical examination here. Next time, you can consider bringing the elderly at home to experience it.

msg:I was tired of the traffic jams during holidays, so I chose Huayi Resort in Shanghai to lie down during the May Day holiday.
Location: Located in Dianshan Lake, not far from the Grand View Garden. The location is remote, and you have to drive to eat at the farmhouse and the nearby supermarket.
Room type: I stayed in the Bamboo Wind King Room. When booking, I called to book a room with tatami. The extra bed cost 500 yuan/night (the tatami can sleep two people, and two breakfasts are provided). The first floor is the activity area, TV, dining table, and bar. The second floor is the rest area, with only one bathroom and it is in the bedroom, which is a very inconvenient design. In addition, the sound insulation is also very poor. In the townhouse, the sound of the next room can be heard clearly. But the room is big enough, and you can bring your pet. It is still very pleasant to sit on the terrace and listen to the sound of the wind blowing through the bamboo forest.
Environment: If you like the "quiet and secluded" style like me, you should like this hotel too. The park area is large enough, with vegetable gardens, orchards, ponds, bamboo forests... The most beautiful time is in the evening, when a ray of setting sun reflects the red river, and the occasional bird calls are heard in the ears, and the breeze blows on the body, and the whole person is empty...
Facilities: Everything is available, swimming pool, gym, table tennis, billiards, small zoo, fishing, picking, cycling... There is also a bonfire party in the evening. I like to eat roasted marshmallows. The auntie who plays music is very electronic music style, haha
Food: The Chinese restaurant focuses on health care. It is said that no chicken essence is added. The taste is okay and the quantity is not small, but the price is really high. It should be that the cost of planting ingredients and the labor cost of gardeners are included. Anyway, experience it yourself, and everyone has their own opinions
Service: The aunties here are all social cows, and they are mainly friendly and enthusiastic. During the stay, there was a high-voltage power failure in the town, and the hotel also lost power for an afternoon. The next day, the housekeeper aunt knocked on the door and said that the hotel was very sorry for the bad experience caused by the power outage, and then promised to give a one-day accommodation in the same room type as compensation. Although it is annoying to encounter power outages, the hotel's remedial measures are still acceptable. Thanks to our housekeeper (Aunt Fang Youqin) for her thoughtful service
To sum up: If you like quiet and secluded places, drive a private car, and value comfort rather than cost-effectiveness, you can come and visit.

The only two shortcomings: the dinner service is very slow during the Qingming Festival
The shower in the bathroom has only a ceiling, which is difficult when you don't want to wash your hair

The red door slowly opened, and you entered a paradise with orchards, small animals, lakes and hillsides. Every staff member I met at the resort was polite and enthusiastic, especially Manager Sun, who was meticulous and thoughtful, as friendly as an old friend. The layout of the room is also unique. There are many objects from old Shanghai in it, which are rarely seen nowadays. The children find it very fresh and like it very much. Although the breakfast at the resort does not have too many varieties, it is more exquisite. The wontons handmade by the aunt and the freshly cooked noodles are very appetizing. After dinner, you can just ride a bike for exercise. The air is fresh and the environment is beautiful. It is a good choice for a vacation in the outer suburbs of Shanghai. I will stay here next time!

Because we stayed in two room types in total, we even helped arrange a rest room for two children to take a nap between rooms!
The farm food in the hotel is very delicious. After eating four or five meals, no one was disappointed.
We also bought chickens and free-range eggs raised in the hotel
Before leaving, the aunts also gave me homemade chili sauce and rice.
Super satisfied! A very happy vacation

The service staff of the whole hotel are very warm and hospitable.
Then talk about some shortcomings. The hotel calls guests teachers, which I feel very strange. This is almost unheard of in hotels of the same price. Basically, they are called ladies and gentlemen. I feel very terrified when I first arrive and am called teachers. The service staff of the hotel, including the front desk, are all plain-faced. I don‚Äôt know if it is because it is a health resort hotel in the suburbs, or if the hotel does not have such a requirement. During the communication, the voices are relatively loud. I don‚Äôt know if they have been trained. I hope it can be improved. The whole hotel hopes to create a sense of original ecology, but it is mixed with some petty bourgeoisie sentiments, which makes people feel a bit out of place. According to the price level of the hotel, it should still be elegant, which is different from the large number of B&Bs around it. I feel that the breakfast of the hotel is average. The coffee machine can‚Äôt make coffee in time. Can it be improved? This should be standard.

The hotel covers a large area, with beautiful lakes, pavilions and greenery, just like a park. "Huayi" is the homophonic pronunciation of "Chinese Medicine". It is the sanatorium of Huashan Hospital. There is also a physical examination center in the park. There is a battery car to pick up and drop off the park, which is very convenient. This time we booked the Zhufeng Lakeside Villa, which is located in the Zhufeng Building. It is a "Hui"-shaped building. The front door of the small courtyard faces the lake view, and the back door leads to four small courtyards, which are the middle part of the "Hui" shape. It is a bamboo forest. The bamboo forest rustles when the wind blows, which is very artistic. The room type is two-bedroom, with a two-story duplex structure. The living room is downstairs, and the two bedrooms are on the second floor. The decoration focuses on simple country style and Zen meditation style. The only drawback is that the two-bedroom apar**ent only has one bathroom, which is inconvenient for people with a large population. The entire resort is full of aunties, who are friendly and enthusiastic. They will affectionately call guests "teachers". They added the aunties' WeChat messages when they checked in. If they have any needs during the period, they will be informed via WeChat. The hotel's Chinese restaurant has very fresh ingredients, but it's a bit expensive. Aunt Chi's service is very enthusiastic. She will ask guests for their opinions during the meal and chat about home cooking. The elderly in the family especially like it here. The hotel is also equipped with swimming pools, billiards, and table tennis rooms, which are available for guests to try for free. There were very few people during our stay, and the swimming pool and table tennis rooms that we went to at 8 o'clock can be reserved. There is a bonfire party at 8:30 every night during the holidays. Children and adults sit around the bonfire, roasting marshmallows and eating biscuits. It is very happy.

1. The park covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãnearly 200 acres, with landscapes, orchards, and vegetable gardens. The greening is well maintained.
2. The service staff I met were all very enthusiastic, with the kind of enthusiasm that comes from within. It's quite special to call guests teacher.
3. There is a restaurant in the hotel. The dishes are not many but very fresh. Most of the vegetables are self-grown seasonal vegetables. When there are not many guests, you need to order breakfast one day in advance. There is room service, which is delivered in an insulated box. Breakfast is delivered for free, but some service fees will be charged when ordering food. Very convenient for guests in need.
4. This time I stayed at the Zhufeng Building, which is surrounded by a building and has a great sense of design. The room we stayed in had a public space on the first floor and a bedroom on the second floor. There is indeed only one bathroom, and the bathroom is not convenient on the second floor. The soundproofing of the room is not very good.
5. Pets are allowed, but only in limited room types.
6. The hotel also has physical examination, bicycle rental, billiards, swimming pool and other facilities and services... Due to time constraints, I have not experienced them all yet.
Overall feeling: This is a low-key hotel, perfect for guests who like a quiet vacation. If possible, avoid the peak passenger flow and stay there for 2-3 days to experience the slow pace of life and nourish your body and soul.

Huayi focuses on original ecological health vacations. Every staff member is friendly and friendly, but the service ability is not enough to support the price of 4,000 a night. On the one hand, the B&B business model cannot compare with the service of a five-star hotel, but it is difficult to say that the details are handled with care. ,

The front desk staff lost the deposit receipt and called to ask for payment the day after he took over. There was no payment record on the system to verify.
The vegetable rice was burnt, bitter, and soft. I was told that this is what vegetable rice is like.
Wooden door latch wood thorns will prick your hands.
Fabric curtains are more difficult to pull, and some light will leak through.
The hot water from the faucet on the first floor is on the right, and the hot water on the second floor is on the left. The hot water comes out quickly and can easily cause burns.
There are no towels or paper towels to wipe your hands next to the only sink on the first floor.
There is only a small ladder in the bathroom to hang clothes, which is not enough.
The security guard knocked on the door one by one and asked if the white car belonged to your family.
During the peak dining period, there were only 5 tables and 4 service staff who were already saying they were too busy...
These details reflect the lack of management and training. It is very sad to see the development of Chinese B&Bs that want to build a brand but lack the ability.

Fortunately, the environment is very good. There are orchards, vegetable gardens and large ponds. Fishing is 200 yuan a day. There are also hammocks, swings, and bonfires. Free bicycles are provided for 3 hours of riding. You can also ride out of the park. It is less than 1 km away from the south gate and turn left. The Dianshan Lakeside rest area is great for watching the sunrise.

msg:It used to be the Huashan Hospital Nursing Home, but now it is probably transferred to private contractors, so "Hua Yi" means "Chinese Medicine". It covers a very large area. The medical center, accommodation, reception, restaurant and recreation each have a building. The layout of the sanatorium has obviously been preserved. After the designer's design, the design style now focuses on rural retro and cool style, which is refreshing compared to the hotel groups I'm used to.

The location is close to Cenbu Village and Grand View Garden, making it suitable for a two-day stay in Qingpu.

Points that impressed me deeply: 1. The swimming pool is very large and the water quality is also very good. Maybe there are fewer people staying in the hotel a week before National Day. Swimming at 8 o'clock is equivalent to a private pool. I enjoy it very much. I have a suggestion: even if there are few guests, change clothes. I still hope that the steam room can be turned on.
2. Breakfast is at the lakeside restaurant with lake view. There are not many choices for breakfast. The salad vegetables are very fresh. You must eat the handmade meat buns. The leather is tough and the meat filling is sufficient.
3. The staff are very enthusiastic and call guests "teacher", which is probably a legacy of sanatoriums. I was a little uncomfortable with it at first, but the service is very enthusiastic and considerate of the guests. A family member accidentally got a thorn in his hand and found it specially. The needles were sterilized and helped to pick the pricks. I really want to thank the aunts at the front desk for giving me a different service experience from ordinary hotels!

msg:A hidden hotel in the countryside of Kanazawa. The entrance is very low-key. You almost think you have found the wrong door. But when you drive inside, you will be amazed by the lush greenery in the garden. It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 200 acres, with large green plants and various flowers. Meanwhile, the rooms are hidden in the lush greenery. The detached house ensures the privacy of the guests and avoids disturbing each other.
Focusing on the purpose of health preservation, the ingredients used in the restaurant are home-grown vegetables, green and natural, picked on the same day, very fresh.
I had dinner at the restaurant of the hotel. The taste was good. The only downside was that the tables and chairs did not match, and it was a bit tiring to sit and eat.
The breakfast is determined at the time of check-in, and it will be delivered to the room by the staff. It is very convenient for the guests in hot summer. It is completely full and tastes good.
The hotel also raises animals such as peacocks, sika deer, and swans. You can also experience feeding sika deer. I heard that two small deer were born last month. Unfortunately, it was too hot to watch.
The gym, billiards room, table tennis room, and swimming pool are all equipped, which is very suitable for team building and family gatherings. The water quality of the swimming pool is very clean, and the staff cleans it in a timely manner.
The service staff in the hotel are very good. It can be seen that there is management. Every employee is very serious and friendly. Xiao Fang who served us was very enthusiastic. He planned to show us other rooms, but unfortunately it was too hot to go out. I can only watch it next time. In addition, the sour plum soup made by the hotel is unforgettable.
It's an unexpectedly discovered treasure leisure place!

Entering from the red gate of the resort, the surrounding area is surrounded by lawns, fruit trees, flowers... The staff has greeted us at the front desk in advance, checked in, delivered to the room, and carefully introduced the usage of the items and facilities. The lakeside villa is really amazing, it is a combination of pastoral style and Southeast Asian style, living by the lake, a cup of coffee, accompanied by a slow song played by the Marshall speaker, a comfortable slow life! The dinner and breakfast are also great, the vegetables and fruits are grown by ourselves, and there is a gift when you check out, it is a perfect weekend trip!

Hygiene: According to the hotel's requirements, parked in the designated parking space and dropped a car of gum. After being exposed to the sun, it was dyed and stained on the white car coat. The whole car had puddles of yellow blots. After washing the car and found that it couldn't be washed off at all, I said that there was no way to claim that it was a natural disaster. The hotel couldn't be responsible for it. I didn't want to bother with them. I immediately left and changed the car clothes. I told us that because I am an old customer, I understand that the compensation is 300 yuan. Thank you. The hotel saves up and asks someone to cut down the tree. The second time I stayed at the hotel for two nights, the room fee was nearly 6,000 yuan. I encountered a problem. This kind of solution attitude is too funny haha

Facilities: The air conditioner on the first floor can't adjust the temperature. It's terribly cold. Some people go in and out of the lobby downstairs in the early morning. waste time! over!

msg:I have stayed in many good hotels during my travels all over the world, but it has been a long time since I was moved by a hotel. This connection between nature and art, especially the designer's style, directly touches my heart. In a kind of "inaction" design, it reveals a deeper beauty everywhere, which can let go of many worldly burdens and restore oneself.
The resort's service made us and our children feel at home. This kind of service comes from the heart of every employee, and never thought of it for a five-star praise. Especially the sincerity of Aunt Xue who served us and several colleagues at the front desk moved me.
The only regret this time is that I did not meet the designer and the manager himself. I am also very curious that I have never met, but through the works, it seems that there has been an exchange of souls in the works. Finally, the six-year-old daughter improvised a "Fu" and left it to the resort. The meaning is full, she said something very interesting, I hope the designer will like it tooüíï

msg:The environment of the whole resort is very good, with a lot of greenery and strong privacy. The villa is equipped with a butler. If you have any needs, tell the butler, and the response speed is very fast.
The design of the villa is not only simple, but also incorporates Chinese classical style. You can see the swaying bamboo forest from every window, and you cannot live without bamboo. There is no TV and mirror in the bedroom, which is very suitable for enjoying the scenery outside the window quietly. However, a transparent frosted circular glass was installed facing the stairs. After the lights are turned off at night, the stairs light shines into the room through the frosted glass, which feels like moving the moon into the bedroom.
The sink in the bathroom is a stone countertop basin. At first, I felt that the sinking speed was a bit slow, but when the front light of the mirror was turned on, I could see the water patterns reflected on the ceiling slowly passing away, and I felt that the pace of life also slowed down.
However, each room type has some small shortcomings. For example, there is no bathroom on the ground floor of the Linhu Villa, and there is only one big bed in the Zhufeng Villa, which may be Zen in it.
Meals are not expensive per capita, but the ingredients and taste are a bit unsatisfactory.
To sum up, the environment is good, quiet and suitable for relaxing. The service attitude is very good, which makes up for many deficiencies. If it can be more perfect in diet, it can become the ceiling of the resort.

Accommodation: A family of 7 booked the Zhufeng multi-bed villa and the Chanmingyuan double bed room. They are both very good. A large family must book a villa. The guest restaurant area on the first floor can play cards and listen to music. It is very lively!
Food: The hotel is very polite. They send orange cakes, sugar kumquats, gold coin chocolates, hawthorn slices, potato chips, nuts, cola, and red bean soup and black rice porridge to the room at 15-16 p.m.! You can eat peanuts and white rabbit toffee. The spicy tripe noodles for breakfast are very good, must eat!
Service: The hotel waiters are mainly aunts. The service is really good. What you need can be delivered in time. They greet you warmly and are very kind. They also send canvas bags and rice when you check out!
Get ready to play again in the fall!

The whole hotel environment is good, the accommodation is very private, and the service is unexpectedly good.

msg:Super six-star experience, five stars are given by the environment, and the extra star is for Aunt Xue! ! !

I didn't expect that Shanghai could have such a pastoral escape from the world! I was looking forward to it before I went, but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be Wow!

A large red iron gate by the Dianshan Lake is locked tightly, and the security check is very strict. You can only enter after confirming the reservation. In the past, it was probably a sanatorium for veteran cadres, but now it has been transformed by a French designer into a frigid health resort. Most of the service staff here are local aunts in Qingpu. After arriving at the front desk, Aunt Xue was already waiting at the front desk. She responded with a warm smile and introduced us enthusiastically and took us to check in. Whatever you ask for! I was really moved. This kind of kindness and thoughtfulness from the heart cannot be experienced in any five-star hotel. It feels like going to a relative's house.

This time I booked a villa room type, a total of 18 buildings, it is strongly recommended to order a villa room. The natural wooden elements are fully utilized, French country style + new Chinese style are mixed and matched, minimalism + warm printing, full of details. The living room on the first floor is very spacious, with a bar counter and long tables, which reminds me of Naked Park in Suzhou. Upstairs there are 2 bedrooms with terrace and small balcony respectively. The villa is hidden in the bamboo forest, and you are awakened by the sunshine of the leaves and the chirping of birds in the morning! The whole house is underfloor heating, even in severe winter, it is enough to wear short sleeves indoors. After we arrived at the room, the aunts warmly sent a thermos of red bean soup, and the thermos was filled with boiling water, so we could make tea directly. The large grapefruit grown by ourselves in the resort had also been cut open, moist and sweet. , full of details!

In the resort, you can pick, ride, feed the deer, and go camping at Dianshan Lake across the road to watch the sunrise. In the morning, I snuggled up to the sparkling lake and had a simple farm breakfast. In Shanghai in early winter, the sun was just right and the breeze was not too dry. I watched the willows brushing across the lake, the red leaves, redwoods and ginkgoes swaying gracefully. I really hope that time will stop here!

This time I brought the elderly with me, the whole family must order a villa room type, it is very worthwhile! The old people are also full of praise, chatting with Aunt Xue very happily.

Looking forward to enjoying such a rare time again next time when the spring is warm and the flowers are blooming.

(A small suggestion. Now Shanghai has completely canceled the nucleic acid site code, and the security at the gate here still requires everyone to scan it. It was a bit unpleasant at first, but later I learned that there is actually a medical examination institution here. Think about it in another way, check Strictness is also responsible for all guests, it is recommended that the security guards can adjust the language appropriately)

msg:The resort is very distinctive. The hotel is garden-style. The rooms are distributed in different areas. There are greenery, meadows, hillsides, vegetable fields, and small animals such as peacocks and sika deer. I booked a quadruple villa and a standard room, in different locations. In terms of cost performance, private villas are much higher than standard rooms. Standard rooms are relatively small, but very delicate. The four-person villa is very spacious, especially the activity area on the first floor is very comfortable. The hotel itself can be strolled around. There are two vegetable gardens, which provide vegetables for the hotel restaurant. The food in the hotel restaurant is not bad. It is really enjoyable to sit outside and dine in this season. In addition, it is also considered for the children, you can feed the small animals, and then there is a place to paint, watch a movie, and have a campfire to roast marshmallows at night. If you want to get out of the hotel, then the opposite is Dianshan Lake, and the scenery should be very good when the weather is good. If we talk about the shortcomings, it is that the four-person villa has only one bathroom, which is too few. In addition, the glass of the shower room in the hotel is not bottomed out, so that it will splash outside when taking a shower, so the situation is worse for four people to take turns to take a shower. Yes, but this is a congenital lack of design, and it is difficult to change. In other aspects, I am quite satisfied overall.

msg:In the general environment of not leaving Shanghai unless necessary, it is really good to have such a vacation experience.
Self-driving and following the navigation are very easy to find, just don't take the Shanghai-Changzhou Expressway, you will pass through Kunshan, the reason is to ask for the Shen code.
From the moment you check in, you can feel the enthusiasm of Qingpu aunts. They will introduce you to the park, including booking restaurants in advance.
There are also free book borrowing, children's painting places, and bicycle rental in the check-in hall.
The traffic in the park is picked up by a battery car, and it is not bad to walk along the way to see the scenery. The air is really fresh that cannot be experienced in the urban area.
‚ñ†Accommodation
We booked a two-story villa for a family of five, which was just right.
In the spacious activity area downstairs, an escalator leads to two rooms. The decoration is simple and warm, hygienic and clean, the facilities are new, there is floor heating, and the air conditioner is Daikin.
The first feeling is "this farmhouse is not inferior to the hotel, it is really tall!"
‚ñ†Dining
There are three restaurants, and the dining environment is good. There are not many types of dishes, but they are quite fresh. It would be nice if the price was more affordable.
‚ÄªThere are not many takeaways around
‚ñ†Feeding of small animals
There are sika deer, peacocks, chickens, ducks and swans in the park.
Aunt Qingpu fed the box with grass, and the children had a great time playing.
‚ñ†Picking of vegetables and fruits
various kinds. All are said to be organically grown without pesticides.
Experienced the joy of picking oranges and pulling radishes.

The interior of the hotel is very large, and the children even fed small animals such as peacocks, guinea fowls, and deer.
The breakfast is average. Although the children gave us a free order, if you want to add another one, 108 yuan is not worth it. The small wontons are not fresh, the noodles are not delicious, and there are few varieties. It is recommended that if one more person is still eating bread in the room.
The butler Zhu Auntie is the most thankful, the whole service is warm and thoughtful. He not only introduced us to the room facilities, but also drove us to various places in a battery car.

The elegant a**osphere of the French style combines the simple elements of the country style
Every piece of furniture can reflect the taste

Going for a walk or biking and getting oxygen must be great
It was a high temperature of 40 degrees when I went, not suitable for long-term outdoor activities

The icy sour plum soup and home-grown pears were brought to the front, instantly cooling off the heat
In the afternoon, snacks will be delivered to the room
Knowing that we are here to celebrate the birthday of the child's father, we also specially prepared birthday noodles for dinner.
After dinner, I went back to the room and the housekeeper had already made the bed, plugged in the electric mosquito coil, and put a little surprise on the table.

msg:Meimeimei, I really want to go, a hotel with rare pastoral scenery but well-maintained facilities and good hygiene.

The hotel staff are polite and warm, especially Aunt Qiuxia in the restaurant? (Forgot the name, there is the word Autumn) Very enthusiastic, and other aunts who do not know the name are also very enthusiastic about introducing various measures. The lady at the front desk was also very polite. Before leaving, she even gave her own millet and two bottles of water, which was very considerate. It's a pity that when booking a room, I repeatedly confirmed whether the villa has two bathrooms, but the operator made a mistake. Multi-room villas only have one bathroom, which is not so convenient, especially for the family.

In addition, there are special events for hotel festivals, such as a bonfire party during the Mid-Autumn Festival and fireworks during the Chinese New Year. Unfortunately, these news are not public until the scene. I hope that in the future, the official account mini-program can be done better, so that guests can see the activities and book hotels in a targeted manner.

The hotel gym has complete facilities, table tennis (the racket is shabby, but there is an automatic ball machine), billiards (slok), but the swimming pool is not constant temperature, the water is very cold, and the cleanliness is average.

In terms of diet, the taste of the restaurant‚Äôs farmhouse dishes is average, and the price per capita is not too expensive, but it is not in the delicious category. I recommend the cold cucumber seedlings, which is very refreshing. There are few choices for breakfast and the taste is ordinary, but the noodles cooked at home are delicious, especially the tripe noodles, the soup is very good.

I will go again if I have a chance, because it is really a step-by-step view. As soon as the car enters the hotel, the mood begins to become calm. Even if the leader who lives in the inner ring wants me to work overtime, I will not become irritable.

There are many interesting places in the courtyard. The Rainbow Bridge on the hillside turned out to be a hammock, as well as the swing by the lake, the red seesaw on the hillside, the small red pavilion on the hillside, and the roadside clusters of wildflowers and fruitful grapefruit. tree and pomegranate tree. The small zoo area is also very clean and does not have a strong smell. The most important thing is to see that the small animals are cared for, instead of being dirty like the zoo areas in other places, and the animals are also dirty and injured.

I like the endless blue water and blue sky, the green farmland and the gentle willows on the roadside, there is a feeling of escaping from the world, and the bamboo garden in the Bamboo Wind Villa area is also full of design, as if you are in a modern art garden in a museum.

The interior of the room is also full of details and beautiful.

If you see this comment, I recommend everyone here to check it out. There are also ancient towns, Qingpu River and Dianshan Lake nearby, which are well worth a two-day and one-night family short trip.

msg:I took my parents and children to go on vacation on weekends. I happened to find Huayi Health Resort on the Internet. I booked a bamboo style villa. It is very convenient to drive there. It is just a little bit past Daguanyuan on Jinshang Road. First of all, let me say that the environment of the whole resort is very good, and it can be seen that it is carefully maintained. The staff was friendly and the check-in was very fast. The housekeeper took us to the room and took the initiative to help us with our luggage. In the afternoon, they also brought sweet soup. The grapes from their own orchard in the room were delicious. The children wanted to feed the deer, and the staff at the front desk drove us to the battery sightseeing car and took a tour in the resort. Because of the influence of the typhoon Shi Yu Shi Qing, every time it started to feed, it rained heavily. It was the third time that I finally fed the children and I was very happy „Éæ ^_^‚ô™. Bamboo wind villa has two floors up and down, three large and one small living room is very spacious. Thank you to all the staff for making us have a great weekend and will choose to take a vacation next time. üòä

msg:I found this resort by accident~ It is also a recuperation institution. It is recommended because there are few people and there are not many parent-child activities. There are indoor swimming pools and small animals, and the types and varieties are good. Other small pet parks are completely different. There are sika deer, guinea fowls, black swans, mallards, a lot of them, and they are very well raised. If you like quiet vacation mode, you can choose here. The receptionist Fang and all the resort staff are very simple and enthusiastic. There are a variety of organic vegetables, fruits and fish from Dianshan Lake grown in the resort. The autumn harvest season is a better choice. I personally feel that the double bedroom is very cost-effective and the hygiene is very good~ However, because this building lives with people who are recuperating, so many people chatting in the public area at night will affect the rest. Dinner is served in the restaurant, and there are two dining areas separated from those who are recuperating. The resort is dining by the lake. There are few people, but the food is served slowly, and the taste of the dishes is okay. There are also many choices for breakfast. The conditions allow to recommend everyone to book the villa room type, and the experience will definitely be better.

Living in a lake view villa, two floors, small courtyard balcony tea room, big enough to play hide and seek in the room, 40 degrees, the room air conditioner is powerful, the key bedroom air conditioner is not facing the bedside, very good . Billiards, table tennis, swimming and fitness are complete. I called a day in advance to confirm various matters. Every service staff greeted you with a smile and greeted you a few meters away. In the afternoon, mung bean soup and red bean soup were delivered to the room. Finally, give some tips. If you have a handicapped person, consider whether the villa is suitable. The bedroom is on the second floor, and the stairs are quite long. The breakfast variety is slightly less than that of a star-rated hotel, but the two toppings of spicy sauce and mustard shredded pork are very delicious! If you don't know how to swim and want to take a dip in the pool, please bring your own swimming ring. This time I went to say that the swimming ring was broken and I couldn't go into the water. In fact, the whole resort is very big, and the scenery and greenery are good, but it is too hot to walk around. I will come back next time when I have a chance.

From the hotel gate to the front desk, you will pass through a long winding road, with green trees and lawns on both sides. Along the way, you will also pass through the deer park, the peacock park, and the picking garden. The bamboo-style multi-room, two floors up and down, the living room below, and the two rooms above. The decoration combines literary and artistic a**osphere with the simplicity of Jiangnan. I like the small yard when I enter the door, and the view from the living room is very beautiful. There is only one bathroom in the more than 200 square meters of Tucao, and it is upstairs, which is really inconvenient. Another place to complain is the dining. I don‚Äôt bother to go out to eat at the resort for dinner. It is called a health meal. They are all freshly picked and cooked, without MSG. A local dish, the braised fish head is suspiciously spicy. A pot of white chopped chicken, the size of a palm, costs 98 yuan. There is nothing to eat for breakfast, not even porridge. The waiter explained that it is more Western-style. This breakfast level is completely inconsistent with the price of 3200. Also remind friends with pets: a cleaning fee of 500 needs to be charged. This fee is not indicated on Ctrip, and the price is a bit outrageous. But overall the waiters were very warm and friendly.

msg:I couldn't go out to Shanghai during the New Year, so I booked a treasure resort recommended by a friend early. I was embarrassed when I arrived at the store yesterday, and found that I remembered the day wrong üòÖ Fortunately, the little brother at the front desk adjusted it in time and let us live in. At this time, the favorability has soared. The room is very comfortable, there is a plum tree outside the big balcony. Add a touch of bright color to the otherwise monotonous winter. The resort has table tennis, billiards, and a screening room. There is a New Year's lion dance performance for dinner, and many vegetables are grown by themselves. Two housekeepers, Xue Meihua and Zhu Jianju, brought Tremella soup in the afternoon, and two bags of rice before leaving. So intimate ‚ù§ The ancient town of Jinze not far from the hotel is also worth a visit. The ancient temples and bridges of the Southern Song Dynasty do not have much business. It is very pleasant to walk around. Parents are satisfied. Will bring them to play when the spring flowers bloom.

msg:To give 5‚≠êÔ∏è! Can feel the intention of the hotel hardware, not the most luxurious. But sincere enough. Special thanks to Miss Chi from the restaurant, she is cheerful, lively and enthusiastic. Although the food is average, she has a feeling of being a guest at a friend's house.
In addition to the five-star praise, I also want to make personal suggestions:
1* Nostalgic is nice, but should be in moderation. For example, the spittoon in the bathroom, the two iron door panels in the dining room... I feel uncomfortable.
2* Meals can be simple, but not shabby.
3* There is no smart toilet cover in the bathroom, and the bathroom is cold. These problems directly affect the living experience.
In short, the same hotel is getting better and better, I hope to go again next time.

2. It is hoped that the reservation arrangement of the restaurant and the connection of the kitchen can be managed more efficiently to give guests a better dining experience.

Although there were some minor incidents in the room and dinner, they were resolved professionally and properly. Special thanks to Ms. Mao who is in charge of the operation!

Traffic is usually self-driving, and there are plenty of parking spaces, because only hotel guests can get in. You can also drive to Zhujiajiao and Qingpu Outlets in half an hour.
The service is particularly praiseworthy. Everyone is very kind. On the day we arrived, the car broke down 5 kilometers nearby. My sister with short hair at the hotel front desk helped contact my colleague and drove over to pick us up. We checked in with the children first, especially praise~ When I was leaving, I urged my aunt to give some self-produced rice. We are welcome to come again next time.
In fact, there are some disadvantages. The bathroom is a bit cold in this weather. It may be because the decoration was early and you need to step into the bathtub to take a shower. The sink is in the room, which may be a little inconvenient for the elderly. However, it can be seen that in the early years, it was decorated with great care, and the current style does not look outdated at all. It is still recommended for families with children~

The aunts Zhu served very well, and they gave us the new rice grown by our resort before leaving. On the way to feed the animals, I encountered two hotel staff patrolling in a small car and took us there. They also left us with a phone number saying that after watching the animals, they could contact them to pick us up. This was especially heartwarming. The restaurant tastes good, but the price is a bit more expensive. Overall satisfied, I have already recommended it to my friends.
The fly in the oin**ent: 1 The variety of breakfast can be richer. Some grapes have rotted and attracted a lot of bugs. People can't help but think back to the same when handling other foods. 2We booked two rooms, but only one room was delivered with red bean soup. I don't know why. Hope to improve it

The family is very satisfied and will definitely come again next time. The resort is very large, with grass, flowers and trees, farmland, water systems, and animals. It is suitable for a day in the resort. There are lemonade, capsule coffee, and minibar in the room. The multi-bed villa is more suitable for 3 people. Although there are two bedrooms, the bed in one of them is only four and a half feet. Two adults are more cramped. The bamboo forest villa has two floors. The first floor is the living room and kitchen area, and there is an enclosed small yard, but there is no bathroom; the second floor is the bedroom lounge area, with two bedrooms and one bathroom. The large bedroom can be overlooked by the railing, and the small bedroom has a terrace. . The difference between the bamboo forest villa and the lake facing villa is the courtyard on the first floor. The courtyard of the bamboo forest villa is closed and does not face the lake, and the courtyard of the forest lake villa is open facing the lake, and the others are basically the same.

The environment is good, the people are better. From the front desk to the lobby to the security guards are very enthusiastic, answer all questions, and meet the needs of guests as much as possible. In particular, Xue Meihua and Zhu Jianju, two service staff, helped us take care of the 80-year-olds and were very touched. Before leaving, I even gave us a small gift. Although the facilities of the villa can't be compared with the luxurious five-star, the service of all the staff is better than the five-star.

Activities are also very rich, you can borrow bicycles in the lobby for free, you can also go to the fitness center to swim, play table tennis, billiards, and exercise (no charge). There are also some hand-made activities, free of charge, you can register at the front desk. All the service staff were smiling, and they met the boss and her dog at the front desk when they checked out. Before leaving, we will give away eco-friendly bags and a small bag of self-grown rice.
If it is not enough, you will have to wait for the check-in/check-out peak. I found hair on the rice when dining in the restaurant (replaced a bowl soon). In addition, if the breakfast is richer, it would be better if you can consult the taste when ordering (if the taste is light, you will feel that the salt and MSG ordered are still a bit heavier).

During the stay, three generations of people felt the facilities and scenery of the villa, especially the enjoyment brought by the service. The multi-bed family suite at Chanmingyuan meets my requirements. There are two separate bedrooms, with the doors closed without interfering with each other, and it is convenient for me to take care of my parents at any time; the open wash area and shower area can be used by four adults. It doesn't feel crowded either. The villa is large, clean, and has a good environment. Walking, jogging, biking, and finding a quiet place to stay in a daze are not a problem. The meals in the villa highlight the theme of health preservation, and the snacks and snacks presented according to the season are all healthy foods that I like. The layout of the building has a strong sense of design and a solid literary and artistic style. Young literary and artistic youths can make a lot of good films here.

üßπHygienic: Not bad

üçÉEnvironment: There are sika deer, peacocks and various chickens, but they are very smelly. There are swans, and there are many original swings on the lawn near the swans. The inside of the villa is not very big, and you can finish it in a short time while riding a bicycle.

üîîService: The waiters here are obviously not from the kind of standardized service training process. Although they are slower, they have a rare kind of simple enthusiasm, which matches well with the name of Yangshengshanzhuang.

Let me talk about the shortcomings first: I live in a double bed room with the cicadas. And the head of the bed is facing the air vent of the air conditioner, so I feel uncomfortable when I go to bed, and I can only turn my head back to sleep. There is no air conditioning in the billiard room, gymnasium, and swimming pool. In the summer of thirty-four to five degrees, even at night, playing billiards is sweaty. When swimming, the skin exposed to the surface of the water is very hot. The locker room from the swim did not have an air conditioner either. There was only an air conditioner fan that looked like an air conditioner but it was already blowing hot air. . . It's too hot to blow your hair.
Let's talk about the advantages: Generally speaking, there are all the necessary equipment, except that the air conditioner is not turned on. . The dishes I ordered were delicious. There was an eggplant braised in oil, and the dishes were very fresh and delicious. It should be from the garden. Before I left, I gave a small bag of rice, which smelled very good. The jujube delivered in the room is very sweet, the snacks delivered by Sheng are very nostalgic, the mung bean lily porridge is very fragrant, and the mung bean is very good.
There are bicycles that you can ride at will. It is still fun to ride in the villa when the sun is not big.
Finally, let‚Äôs talk about breakfast. There are not many varieties but you can eat full. There is a sesame-filled sole cake? Unexpectedly delicious

If you ride out, it will take 30 minutes according to the staff. There are several bicycles in the hotel, so you can ride it by luck! It was a bit disappointing to see many people coming for physical examinations during the day. 2. Check-in: I entered the room at 8:30 in the evening. The light was too dim. When the light was turned on, I couldn't see the clothes in the suitcase. This really made me speechless. Communicating with the front desk, the front desk staff was very good, but said there was no way, and later brought me a floor lamp. It was originally set for 2 days, but immediately retreated for one day. I have to say that the service is still very good. At breakfast the next day, the designer came to communicate and said that he could upgrade to a courtyard house for free, but the lighting inside was still very dim. I felt that it was not suitable for family parenting, and I felt discouraged to wash! 3. Service: The service staff is still very good. When I check in, I send home-produced figs. Only, when I send home-produced pears, it‚Äôs a pity that the pears are rotten.
I was thinking about cycling around the mountain lake after I moved in. It could be too hot and the distance would be too far. Overall, I felt a little remote!

msg:To be honest, the experience at this price is very average. I stayed in the Cicada Courtyard Executive Suite for 2,000 a night, and breakfast was not included.

The overall leisure, rooms, services and meals are not worthy of the price. I personally think that the price is more suitable at 700-1000. The overall feeling is mediocre and I will not come here again.

First of all: The building where this room is located is said to be designed by a designer, with a French country style, but the texture is not reflected. The boards and bedside tables are made of ordinary materials, but they just seem to have a sense of design. Room cleanliness, shower temperature, and bed comfort are average.

Secondly, there are indeed sika deer, peacocks, ducks and other animals in the hotel, but the number is very small, and there is not enough space for interaction. It is still very far from the imagined vacation and relaxation feeling. There is no air conditioning in the table tennis room, gym, and billiards room.

For service, I may hire more local aunties, and their attitude is very good, but the content and quality of service still have a lot of room for improvement. I have stayed in many hotels and B&Bs. Friendly attitude is one thing, and the quality of service must also be the same. Come on. I couldn‚Äôt remember the name of the dish when ordering, and tried to swipe my card directly into the door for cleaning at 8:30 in the morning...

The sound insulation is very poor. The door is a wooden door panel with gaps, and the corridor is in the shape of a zigzag. If the auntie or other tenants talk outside, it will be very noisy.

The above is my personal experience. I don‚Äôt know why there are so many super positive reviews. The overall feeling is that the price does not match the experience. Please consider it carefully.

msg:In fact, I really don‚Äôt want to write such a detailed review. I‚Äôm afraid that the room will not be fixed because of his fire in the future... However, such an excellent health hotel should not only have a score of less than 4.5 at present. Apart from its slightly remote location, his house There are almost no shortcomings. I personally think that the 4.7-4.9 score is relatively reasonable. The appointed bamboo wind villa, the room is like video, the price is excellent! The room as a whole has the temperament of wabi-sabi, and at the same time it is full of details! ! I have to mention this point, because it really catches the eye! In my philosophy, Meitu was born in and integrated into ordinary daily life. And in the public hall of this store, I saw leaves floating in a row of tea cups, the most common kind of leaves, but they were full of fun. Those who can get to the hotel's temperament will already know this place-it can be Angelica sinensis. It's the same in the room. The new mint and dog's tail in the bottle are really a welcome guest beyond a five-star hotel. Of course, the details of the hotel are not limited to the above-mentioned "shape", but are also implemented. Welcome fruit, free snacks and soft drinks from the minibar. In addition to the capsule coffee machine and the kettle, the room has been placed in two full containers when you check in. One pot is boiled water and the other is lemonade. And, the water tank of the capsule coffee machine is filled with water. The last time I encountered this, it was in the super five-star Sukhothai in the urban area. Peninsula Chestnut did not deal with this point. Of course, if you don't trust the store or like to add water when you use it, you can ignore this. Due to the superior ecological environment of the hotel, electric mosquito coils prepared by the store can be seen in many corners and drawers in the room, which can be used at any time. Moreover, because the room has a terrace and a small courtyard, the store also prepared a mosquito coil tray, which is inserted in the mosquito coil box. In terms of service, I am embarrassed by the enthusiasm, any need, just a phone call. Breakfast can be delivered to the room, and there is also a buffet. If you choose to deliver meals in the room, please refer to Figure 3 for the exquisiteness (not all shots, enough for one person in terms of portion size). The hotel has its own vegetable garden and orchard, and almost all of the fruits and vegetables in the restaurant come from self-produced. When checking out, the store also prepared a large box of freshly picked vegetables as a souvenir. However, I rarely cook at home on weekdays. I was afraid of taking away the waste. In the end, I only took away cucumber and loofah. But the hotel‚Äôs service and enthusiasm are on the public screen.
The only disadvantage is that the shower water is a bit small, and the shower will be a bit slow. Without it.
Finally, the hotel is very large and quiet. There is no so-called children's playground suitable for small friends, so it is extremely suitable for cultivation. I like it very much. Would go again.

msg:A very good experience!
The villa is very large and has a lot of greenery. Apart from a lot of mosquitoes this season, the environment is great! It is suitable for travelling with the elderly and children.
This time I booked the villa, which is very spacious and the environment is clean and tidy. I also presented rice dumplings, bayberry, and mung bean soup as snacks for the stay.
The staff I met were very warm and caring, and very patient with the elderly and children, and they also presented self-grown vegetables when they checked out.
For those who are inconvenient to get out of Shanghai, it is a good choice for travel and stay!

msg:This is the second time I came to China to stay at the hospital. In addition to bringing a dog in, I will choose this place again for other staying experiences.
1. Large space and thoughtful details. Villa courtyard design, functional distinction between upstairs and downstairs; indoor living facilities are all available, you have everything you want. There are also intimate room delivery, available on call.
2. Gymnasium, swimming pool, animal feeding, own vegetable plot, outdoor children's playground, hotel parent-child activities, hand-made activities... you will not get tired of staying in the hotel for a few days.
3. The restaurant is purely natural cuisine, especially the administrative restaurant. The food is fresh and delicious, self-grown or produced by surrounding farmers to ensure quality. Especially worth mentioning is the restaurant's homemade sauces: eggplant sauce, chili sauce, olive dishes, delicious! Before leaving, Xiao Wang, the waitress in the restaurant, and another waitress who forgot to ask for his name, also specially sent the bayberry and homemade sauces of this season for me to take back. I praised it üëçüèª.
4. Warm and considerate service. The service staff are kind and enthusiastic, proactive and thoughtful, lemonade, the hotel's own fruits... No matter when you go to the lobby, what to do, as long as you are seated, there will always be a service staff kindly greet you and offer tea and fruits on your own initiative. When I checked out, I also gave a gift box of vegetables grown by the hotel. The quality of the dishes is very good.
In short, it is a resort hotel that is worth staying again and again. Especially during the epidemic period, it is not suitable to travel far. The surrounding Grand View Garden, Oriental Oasis, and the ancient town of Jinxi a little further away can all be taken around. It is the best choice for locals and families to travel. It is highly recommended!

msg:The hotel is located on the edge of Dianshan Lake. The surrounding greenery is very good. It covers a very large area. There are also many types of hotel rooms, which are suitable for party activities, parent-child activities or vacations to relax. The hotel is a butler-service hotel. After driving into the hotel‚Äôs door and driving straight in, it feels like you have entered a natural plant garden, including grassland, woods, sika deer garden, orchard and vegetable garden, and a large area of farmland under the boss‚Äôs further afield. It will take a few minutes to get to the front desk of the hotel, which is relatively private. You can see the surrounding lush scenery in the room or while eating, which is very relaxing. The floors of the hotel are not high, only three floors at most. I heard that the proprietress studied decoration and design overseas, so the decoration in the hotel is very artistic. It can be seen that it is made by everyone, combining modern and retro elements. The hotel is a butler-style service, so the service staff are very enthusiastic. At the request of my curiosity, I took me around the surrounding scenery on a rainy day. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of the Dragon Boat Festival. The housekeeper will also deliver different soups and fruits every day. There is nothing to say. The butler manager is even more considerate, and will greet whether the food and living are delicious and comfortable every day. Many details are arranged very well, and I have to like it. I admire how the store owner has such a powerful team, hahahaha! Finally, let‚Äôs talk about the restaurants. There are two restaurants, but I prefer the restaurant with a view of the lake. Breakfast is both Chinese and Western. Both lunch and dinner are a la carte. The cost is similar to the market price, but the sea bass is worth recommending. The taste Good, the most cost-effective, it is a dish I must order for two days in a row for lunch and dinner; green vegetables are basically grown in the hotel, so I feel more at ease when I eat. This time the quadrangle courtyard where a family of four lived, the room was very clean and comfortable. Next time, I will try the bamboo courtyard. It has a small courtyard alone. The indoor area is larger and more comfortable. The facilities in the hotel have billiards and I played twice; I taught my children a game of table tennis; the swimming pool is constant temperature, so I really want to play, but I can only play next time without a swimsuit. It is said that there will be barbecues and bonfires when we arrive at the hotel. I hope I can meet them next time.

I have stayed for the second time, the first choice for staying, and very clean, there is no smell of humidity in the southern rainy season. The vegetables in the vegetable garden are naturally pollution-free and really delicious. There is no peculiar smell in the breeding grounds of small animals.

The decoration style also made us like it very much. With the readily available bayberry, vegetables, and various small animals, it feels more like a park. The recommended sole is very delicious, thank you.

msg:Advantages: The natural environment is very good. In spring and autumn, you can go for outdoor walks, fishing and cycling.
The facilities are basically complete, indoor heated swimming pool, billiards and table tennis room, gym has some aerobic equipment, no barbell.
Suitable for family trips.
shortcoming:
Lunch is 4 large and 1 small, and you need to order a 600 yuan set meal to barely get enough, and there are no decent dishes.
The rooms may not be classified as smoking and non-smoking rooms, but because I did not ask clearly when we checked in, the pillow and quilt we got was all smoke and mold smell.
I am afraid that the room cleaning does not include the floor, and there is a lot of dust against the wall
There is no partition door or shower curtain in the shower room. After washing, the bathroom is full of water, so you should pay attention to non-slip.
Serve
It's really hard to explain in a word. When checking in, remind me to check out at 11:50. Although I don't understand, I am willing to cooperate. I called two rooms we booked more than 11 o'clock before check out and urged us to check out. Since we are not welcome, why should we accept our reservation?
