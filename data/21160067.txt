msg:The location of this hotel is excellent if you are wanting to do an early morning sunrise at Jingshanlin Great wall. This hotel is just right at the foot of the great wall entrance!

From the time when we check in to check out, to the staff at the restaurant, they all provided excellent service, with a good smile, friendliness and willingly to help if you have any questions. They are very accommodating for our needs as well since we have a few of us that's vegetarian. 

The breakfast provided in the morning is excellent and very very fueling. Healthy too. If you want more of something that you like, they will bring it out again. We ate at the restaurant at night too, and the food was good. 

The room has all the amenities you need. Too bad the spa was not open when we're there (due to maintenance). 

Overall, excellent place to stay, right at the foot of the great wall. Jingshanlin Great wall is beautiful and one of the beautiful section of the great wall. Definitely worth a visit.

msg:A fantastic hotel right at the Jinshanling park gate. This is the best Great Wall location I have been to out of 4. Much better than Bandaling and Simatai. Parts are unrestored and parts have been and you can choose to walk for kilometres with Simatai in the distance. Winter is a great time to visit. The staff in the hotel treated us like VIPs as there were few guests. The hotel restaurant is excellent and the prices are very reasonable. Hotel is quite new and the rooms are lovely and comfortable. On the wall you are often the only one in the section.

It was very clean and the people were very nice, but there were very few possibilities to eat for dinner and the breakfast options limited (especially for take out or early sunrise)

msg:A nice hotel situated right next to the Jinshanling Great Wall entrance. Unbeatable in terms of location and presumably much better comfort compared to the surrounding bed & breakfast farmhouse stays. Reasonable comfort and hotel restaurant was surprisingly up to par. Would suggest to bring a pair of beach slippers to walk around the room as floor was quite dusty. The courtyard two or three bedroom suites are great for families.

msg:The hotel staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The room was spacious and comfortable, but had marks on the walls and mirrors and some mold on the wall of the shower.

Location is excellent for hiking Jinshanling Great Wall, but there is very little else in the area except for a couple of restaurants and small shops. We stayed on a Monday & Tuesday night and there were very few guests staying at the hotel. If you are planning to only hike Jinshanling, a 1 night stay would make more sense.

On our last night, we were woken up by a woman repeatedly screaming, stamping and banging doors on the floor above us. I called the hotel and went to the reception area to find a staff member to help, but no one was there. The hotel staff were very apologetic and sincere when I told them this the next morning and were patient when communicating with me through translation apps.

msg:The hotel is within walking distance to the Jingshanlin Great Wall. The compound of the upmarket hotel is big and the design is modern but the room is smaller than I would have expected. 

The quality of the food is not as good as compared to other same class of hotel, but given that it is at the outskirts of the city, may be I should not expect so much.

Due to the location, it is rather hard to get a car online. End up we have to pay extra to get to the next city which is about an hour away.

msg:I was travelling with my parents in their mid-sixties. The accommodation was very comfortable for them and myself. I stayed in the very beautiful loft, they stayed in the ground floor room. 
One of the reasons we’re close this hotel was for its convenient location. It truly was. There were great restaurants just down the street and it was very convenient to get to the major tourist destinations. 
The service was a slight let down. The team were very kind and friendly, but did not speak any English. The breakfast menu was not being served the mornings we stayed. I ordered a coffee from the menu but received a hot chocolate 10 mins later. When I asked why, they said they had out of milk. They were kind enough to offer a refund, but again this was a complicated experience. That being said, the team working there were very kind and it was clear they were trying hard. 
I would stay here again, but was sad that we couldn’t experience the amazing menu that they offer on the website.

It is worthy of being a big hotel, much better than a homestay. There is a food street next to the hotel, and there is a farmyard nearby where you can eat farm food. The children had a lot of fun playing in the yard. Except for the price on holidays, there is nothing wrong with it.

I asked the front desk clerk for two bottles of water and was told that the standard water supply was 4 bottles, and I had to pay for more!

I didn’t take any pictures in the room, just like the pictures in the hotel. I took a lot of pictures in the yard. It’s just that the season is not very good, it should be better when there are flowers and trees!
What amazed us was that this breakfast table really gave us the energy to climb the Great Wall~
The last picture is a starry sky taken with a mobile phone in the courtyard at around one o'clock at night. I will definitely bring a camera with me next time.
The ticket gate is 100 meters away from the hotel. It’s not too convenient. I’ll stay here again next time I come to Jinshanling Great Wall.

msg:I am very satisfied with the hotel. It is comfortable, clean and very close to the entrance of the Jinshanling Great Wall. It is the best choice for this trip. The only thing I hope is that the hotel can order all the dishes to be heated on the alcohol stove for breakfast in the future. The weather is cold and the lids of the dishes are open, which is especially easy to get cold.

msg:The location is very good, right at the entrance to the scenery, but there are very few parking spaces in front of the hotel. You need to park somewhere below, which is a 10-minute walk. We booked two rooms in a small courtyard. The courtyard is not big and there is not much to stay in. The big bed in the room is two single beds pushed together. The comfort is okay, but there are stains on my pillowcase. The toothbrushes don't feel as good as those at a hotel, but we usually use our own, so it doesn't matter. The kettle lid couldn't be closed, and we were too lazy to replace it. There was a trash can in the house next to the toilet, and another at the sink. There was no trash can next to the table to eat, which was inconvenient. There are bugs everywhere in the mountains, and they will fly in as soon as you open the door. There is nothing you can do about it. It rained during dinner. I asked the front desk to borrow an umbrella and was told that it would be brought to me. Since the accommodation and the front desk were not in the same place, the deposit was 100. However, after waiting for half an hour for the rain to stop, no one came. The food in the restaurant is not cheap, the environment and taste are okay, and the portions are quite large. The Great Wall is pretty good. If you get up early and climb it, there won’t be many people. I originally booked for two days, but I felt that the hotel's environment and conditions were average and met the rating, so I canceled for one night.

msg:The room was great! The courtyard is beautiful and cozy!

The hotel is integrated with the Jinshanling Great Wall Scenic Area. There are guards at the top of the mountain and no one is allowed to drive up. Even hotel guests will not be allowed to drive on the grounds that there is no parking space and must give way to the hotel's shuttle bus! He had a bad attitude. He stood in front of my car with his arms akimbo, shouting and yelling! I said it was inconvenient for me to carry old people and children, so I went up to unload my luggage. If there was no parking space, I drove down! They refused to let me get on. Finally, a shuttle bus staff member from the hotel said that I could go up and take a look. I drove up and found a parking space without any further trouble! This guard makes me laugh! Extremely bad!

When I had dinner at the hotel, I had to wait for more than half an hour for the food to be served. I still ordered fried peanuts and fried eggs. The restaurant looked like a temporary place, and the service staff all looked like novices!

When I arrived at the hotel to check in, there were 6 computers, but only one could check in, resulting in a queue! The sense of experience drops instantly! Fortunately, the courtyard room is still very good, I really enjoy it!

msg:The overall environment design of the hotel is very good, the courtyard is clear, quiet and elegant, and the rooms are clean and tidy. The most convenient advantage is that it is very close to the gate of the scenic spot, making it easy to quickly climb to the top and take photos. The service attitude of the staff was good. They also gave a photo album when leaving the store, which was helpful for understanding the cultural landscape of the Jinshanling Great Wall. The shortcomings are: 1. The reception process is a bit too rigid and not humane enough. For example: customers should be allowed to drive outside the hotel lobby to unload their luggage and then go to the parking lot to park; 2. The front desk is best located on the first floor, rather than letting guests who are tired from the journey climb to the second floor to check in; 3. The breakfast is too Simple and does not match the overall positioning and price level of the hotel.

I thought I'd forget it and told me that we won't take anything from guests. We've also lost Apple computers that are more expensive than yours before. Maybe... I bought my 50ml shower gel for more than 200, no matter how expensive or cheap it is. I bought it with my money. I left it at the hotel by mistake. I don't mean to blame it. I just asked if it can be recovered. Maybe now I can only say that your housekeeping depar**ent is quite sloppy. Either "accept it for me". If not, then I will give it to the next room resident. But the hotel's responsibility is greater than the customer, right? Also, this hotel is usually empty. Today, the front desk is so busy that I am annoyed. Answer the phone. Which hostel aunt do you think it is?

There is a coffee bar on the first floor of the hotel. The paintings on the walls and the combination of sofas and seats are very beautiful.
The second floor is a cafeteria and a tea restaurant with large floor-to-ceiling windows, where you can see the scenery of the Great Wall.
The rooms are beautifully designed, simple and stylish. The bedding is made of pure cotton and is very comfortable to cover. The cleanliness can be rated five stars.
The bathroom has dry and wet separation, 24-hour hot water, and good toiletries.
The room is well ventilated and it's very quiet to sleep at night.
There are air conditioners and electric fans, free WIFI, and bedside sockets with USB sockets. The details are well done.
Breakfast is also very rich.
The waiters always say hello when they meet. The service is very good and makes people feel friendly and warm.

The service staff should be from nearby people. The folk customs are very simple. It is warm and hospitable, without the luxury of a big city, but with the simplicity of the countryside. It is so quiet at night that you can hear your own heartbeat. I am used to the fast-paced lifestyle. It is really enjoyable. I am very picky about hygiene, but the hotel's hygiene is really good, and there are no hygiene dead spots. The restaurant mainly serves local Chinese food, which tastes good. A very pleasant trip [hehe]

msg:If you are driving at Jinshanling Great Wall, I definitely recommend this hotel. You can drive to the parking lot in the hotel courtyard. There is only one corridor from the guest room. It is so convenient. There is a ticket gate 100 meters away from the guest room. It is very fast to enter and exit the park. You can also go out and take a walk in the square at the entrance of the scenic spot to enjoy the cool air at any time in the evening. The hotel guest room is a two-story building. We stayed on the first floor. When we opened the door, there was a wooden verandah. Across the railing, there was a small garden. The children ran around to see flowers and butterflies. It was right at the door of the room, which was very comfortable and convenient. The room is not trendy at all, but the TV is a bit stuck. Fortunately, the TV in the friend's room next door is normal, and the children gather there to play haha😄😄😄
I was so tired from climbing the Great Wall that I forgot to take photos of the hotel. They are exactly the same as the ones online, no pitfalls. Like 👍👍👍
There are not many types of breakfast, but it is very delicious. The important thing is that it is not salty, which is very rare in the north👍👍👍

The 45-square-meter courtyard king-bed room booked was probably not even 30 square meters. The hotel bed is 2 meters by 2.2 meters, which takes up almost half of the room. The door connected to the yard is not well sealed, and rain will leak into the room when it rains. There are many mosquitoes at night. The breakfast time ended very early, and there was no breakfast at 9 o'clock in the morning. I went to the restaurant at 8:50 in the morning, and the noodle stalls were already cleaned up. Unidentified small flying insects are flying around on it, such as the small bugs I circled in pink. I wanted to apply for an extended check-out, but the hotel said they couldn't do it due to crowds, but as far as I could tell based on the parking situation in the hospital, there wasn't as many people as they said. It's fine if the hotel doesn't have a swimming pool, not even a gym, and the guest service feels like a mess. The only advantage is that it is very close to the Jinshanling Great Wall scenic spot.

When we arrived at the hotel, it was already past meal time, but after the hotel front desk learned of our needs, they immediately arranged to cook noodles for us. The next day, we wanted to climb the Great Wall from the East Gate to see the text brick wall. After the hotel concierge knew our needs, he immediately arranged a free pick-up for us and took the initiative to leave his contact information so that we could contact him down the mountain and return to the hotel. Made us feel at home. In addition, the hotel's breakfast is very rich, and the lunch and dinner are delicious. It's a very good hotel experience.

The outside of the hotel is generally okay. I booked an exclusive courtyard twin room with an independent courtyard. It happens to be close to a mountain at the back, so you can't see far, but it's not bad. However, the room and internal facilities are a bit boring. The room is cramped, the pillows and bedding on the bed are a bit old, and the furnishings are average. I always feel that it's not that good. It's comfortable and the breakfast is average. It's far from what a five-star hotel should be. However, I still have to give thumbs up to the hotel staff. They are very enthusiastic and patient. They are always available for any questions. However, the room is not as expected as expected. Sophisticated and comfortable. The hotel should be renovated and the corresponding hardware and supporting facilities should be better, otherwise such a good location would be wasted.

The accommodation conditions, indoor soft furnishings, towels, paper products, utensils and bedding are very average. Although I deliberately chose a small courtyard, it seemed to be of no use. There are not many activities and entertainment facilities in the hotel. When I came back from climbing the Great Wall at around 7 o'clock in the evening, I could only watch TV, and the screen was quite small anyway. There is not enough parking space. If the psychological expectation was that it would be OK to climb the Great Wall in two days for convenience, but my mentality was wrong and I was a little disappointed when I decided to stay in a resort hotel.

Hygiene: It is very rare for a bungalow to be able to wear disposable slippers without dust and hair! The cleanliness of restaurants and public toilets has reached the standards of luxury hotels in first-tier cities.

Environment: You can reach the ticket office of the scenic spot within a two-minute walk. You can drive to the hotel parking lot with your check-in order, which saves a lot of energy for climbing the Great Wall. The courtyard area is designed to be very quiet and the air is fresh.

Service: The service is attentive and enthusiastic, and you can feel that every service staff is trying their best. It may be the first time we encounter a peak passenger flow, and the entire team still needs some experience and adjus**ent. For example, there is only one check-in counter in the entire hotel.

The only dissatisfaction with this stay is that there are too few breakfast varieties. It is standard for a farmhouse, but it does not have the characteristics of a farmhouse.

Picture 1: The corpse of the stinky lady on the window sill of the room where she checked in (has the room been cleaned carefully?) Two more were found in the room at night. I don’t understand why there are so many stinky ladies when the doors and windows are closed.
Picture 2: The stain on the bedside table was really dirty, so I wiped it with an alcohol paper towel.
I wanted to wash up in the evening and found that I didn't have a toothbrush. I called the front desk and they said they had one in the room. After confirming that it is not available, I will ask the service staff to bring it over.
When I got up and took a shower in the morning, there were centipedes on the toilet wall. . .
In short, if this hotel continues to be managed like this, it will become obsolete sooner or later. The hardware is poorly maintained and the software is even worse.

Because we arrived at night, there were no lights on the entire road, and the directions were not particularly clear. I had to call several times to find the lobby. After checking in, I felt that the washing area was too small. There were no chairs in the room, and there was only a small table on which nothing could be placed. There is no cloakroom. It's not what an ordinary double bed room should look like at all. The funniest thing is that the night light cannot be turned on alone at night. When the main switch is turned off, the night light must also be turned off. If the main switch is not turned off, other lights cannot be turned off. If you want an extra bottle of water, you have to pay 5 yuan. Breakfast was OK. It is not recommended to choose to stay.

The hotel has a quiet and clean environment. Children are given free breakfast coupons. There are no stairs on the second floor, but there are service staff to help carry luggage upstairs.

msg:The hotel is close to the entrance of the Great Wall, and the concierge is very considerate in arranging luggage storage. It is best for the housekeeping staff to dress uniformly. Two people cleaning a courtyard are enough, but three or four people cleaning at the same time will be inefficient and appear messy. The hygiene of the room still needs to be more careful. The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant would be better if the dishes were richer.

But every time I go there, the vicious security guard who manages the parking lot at the hotel entrance leaves a very bad impression on people. This person should have been a top figure in the village in the past. He drank and scolded people, which made people feel bad when they first arrived at the hotel. He must be a relative of the hotel management. He is arrogant and treats guests very badly. He is also full of swear words and threatening words. I hope everyone will avoid this hotel as much as possible. You can choose the B&B next to it, which is friendly, cheap and clean! I am so drunk and hope this hotel will fire this evil security guard as soon as possible!

Here comes the key point. There are too many disadvantages: 1. The No. 2 courtyard, the equipment and facilities in the room are too old, and the walls are There were mold spots, there was rust inside the hot water kettle, and there was a sudden power outage at night. 2. There were too many bugs. I lit mosquito coils and flies flew everywhere. 3. The service was very average. It rained on the day we went, so we didn’t bring an umbrella. I asked the waiter to bring two bottles over, and they also took a deposit of 100 yuan for each bottle. The mineral water comes standard with 4 bottles per room (it is ordinary Nongfu Spring). If you exceed the quantity, you will have to pay 5 yuan for a bottle of water. The food and beverage are very poor. Both breakfast and other meals are very poor. It is not as good as an ordinary farmhouse. It is not recommended to come. The price is not as good as the surrounding farmhouses. The best standard room in the farmhouse is only more than 200. The No. 2 courtyard I booked is more than 2,000. , I really don’t feel the value of more than 2,000, I don’t recommend it, it’s too bad! ! ! !

In the scenic spot, private cars can also enter the hotel in the scenic spot to park (free of charge). If you don’t stay at the hotel , You need to take a shuttle bus (10 yuan per person) from the foot of the mountain to enter the scenic spot. The hotel is less than 100 meters away from the ticket gate. The white statue in the distance in Figure 1 is the statue of Qi Jiguang who entered the ticket gate. It is very convenient to climb the Great Wall. The accommodation conditions are also good, it is courtyard style. The service is also very thoughtful, the food and beverage dishes are large in quantity, and the prices are moderate. Worth coming back.

You can go there once in the morning and in the evening. The ropeway opens at 6:30 in the peak season and ends at 4:30 in the afternoon. It is hot. If you go up at 4:30 in the afternoon, the weather is cool. It's getting cooler and not so hot, so taking pictures of the Great Wall in the sunset is even more spectacular. It’s the right time to come to Jinshanling Great Wall. It’s authentic and less crowded. It’s much better than Badaling and Mutianyu!

The room is small and compact, with the bathroom, shower room, and sink each occupying a corner, and the wet and dry areas are separated. The bed is large, medium hard, and very comfortable to sleep on.
There are two slight regrets: First, the variety and quality of breakfast are not in line with the overall feeling of the hotel, which is quite disappointing. Second, the mineral water in the room cannot be replenished as you drink it. In addition to the one given as a gift when you check in, you need to purchase it if you want to replenish it. I have stayed in many hotels during my travels at home and abroad, and this is the first time I have encountered it.

Transportation: The parking lot is about 500 meters away from the hotel, you can ask a courtesy car to pick you up

msg:I booked this hotel because it is the only star hotel nearby, but it is not up to five-star standards at all, so it is only three stars? The external environment and hotel building are actually plus points, but the current management and services are completely inadequate. After arriving on the first night, the shuttle bus driver (receptionist in the lobby, wearing uniform) checked the various registrations for Health Treasure and asked us to put our luggage at his door and go to the second floor (the front desk is on the second floor) to check in. I said it was convenient for us to carry the box ourselves, but he insisted that he take us to the backyard room later, so he put it downstairs. It turned out that when we went downstairs, no one cared about the box at the door. Rest in your own seat far away. When we were walking upstairs, a young girl in casual clothes stopped us and asked us if we wanted to check in. When we checked in, we needed to check the itinerary and register. The first guy stopped her again and said that the registration was complete. It felt very unprofessional and rude.
As for check-in, we booked 3 nights with breakfast on Ctrip and paid in advance. The front desk gave us a breakfast coupon for the first day. I asked what about the rest? She said you still have something behind you? 2 nights? I was very speechless and said it was three nights, and she gave me a coupon for the next two days.
Let’s talk about breakfast, 7-9. As a result, at 8:30 in the morning on the first day, we met a tourist on a tour bus. They swarmed into the breakfast area upstairs. There were not many seats, and now it was even more messy and dirty. There were also people who complained about smoking but no one took care of it, so we decided to come back later. After arriving at 9:30, there were not enough tableware and not much food. The five-star hotel breakfast did not even have boiled eggs, milk, or various types of sausages. It was just cold dishes, soy milk, and steamed buns. It was comparable to nearby farmyards. . So we didn't come back for breakfast for the next two days.
Talking about the rooms, first of all, there are no elevators in various buildings, so you need to climb up and down. Although the corridor is outside, there are people smoking directly in the corridor. The disposable slippers given on the first day were completely different from those on the next two days, which was very unprofessional. The bath water is very small and not hot both day and night. It is okay for washing at night but not hot at all during the day. The gray water in the toilet is yellow after flushing. On the premise that we were very careful to open the windows and pull the screens when entering and leaving every day, we found so many bedbugs (stinky sisters) in the house every day, which was very speechless. There were unknown stains on the sheets. We really didn't have the energy to argue or complain, so we put many layers of paper towels on the stains.
I am a very picky person when traveling. I can only choose this hotel because I have to do business nearby. However, staying for three nights often really affects my mood. I hope the hotel will improve its service in the future and not waste such good things left by the original group hotel. The architecture does not disappoint the surrounding beauty.

    因為這個酒店，這個旅程都很治癒。在院子裏吃飯、喝茶、聊天、看星星…城市生活的焦躁一掃而空。
   此外，金山嶺長城太美了，不來不知道，真覺得比八達嶺強很多，絕對的原生態。最最重要的是，這麼美的地方，人居然很少。在各地景區人山人海的情形下，這點太難得了。再美的地方，人一多，立刻沒了遊玩的心情。
   多説一句，很不理解酒店評分為啥不高。有些遊客未免太過吹毛求疵。疫情之下，又是大山裡麪，奉勸大家不要太苛求。拿悦榕莊的服務或三亞五星酒店的設施和服務標準去衡量，未免太苛刻了。

酒店環境是沒的説，這次是臨時決定去的，沒有訂到帶小院的房型，略微有點遺憾。房間內部就還可以，沒有到很好的水平，不過還可以就可以了。早餐自助種類很少，味道尚可。麪檔就非常樸素了，不過麪檔的姑娘也很樸實可愛。
酒店去長城入口非常近，長城的景色太好了，個人覺得比八達嶺、慕田峪、司馬台的景色都好，哪怕這次天氣不好，下雨、陰天，但景色都超級好，怪不得人民大會堂宴會廳都用金山嶺長城做背景，那是相當壯麗威嚴。而且門票設定挺合理，一張門票可入園兩次，一次下午，一次上午，正好領略不同風光不走回頭路。索道很長很慢，價格也比其他長城景區合理。
很喜歡金山嶺長城，就是有些遠，要是有更方便的公共交通直通就更好了。

房間：定的兩房庭院，有一個獨享院子，院子裏喝喝茶聊聊天還是很愜意的。硬件設施還可以，對水温和水壓尤其滿意。電視台頻道較少。整個酒店有Wi-Fi信號覆蓋，沒有死角。
公共區域：餐廳面積太小，很難容納節日高峯期間的住客。酒店院內停車場空間有限，大部分車都要停在外面停車場。
服務：服務一般。這個評價不針對任何工作人員，工作人員都比較熱情。我們入住第二天，酒店接待了一個大幾十人的看房團來酒店用早餐（衹用早餐，並不入住），本來就不大的用餐空間擠滿了人，取餐處排了幾十人的長隊，食物很難取到，更不用説是否有座位。環境之嘈雜混亂，讓人難以置信這是五星級酒店的管理水平。豪華酒店不應該接這樣的生意，這對酒店住客的體驗極其不好。另外，入住時辦理人員缺乏對於景區、酒店園區、用餐地點的主動介紹。退房錢詢問是否可以延遲1-2小時退房，告知客滿不能延退。實際上我們旁邊幾個院子在入住的三天一直都是空房。
餐食：早餐招待所水平。

msg:酒店在長城景區內，環境、設施、衞生都不錯，酒店餐廳的菜不便宜但不難吃，餐廳造型設計不俗，就是觀景玻璃該擦擦了，很減分。酒店客服人員應該未經正規培訓過，沒那麼專業但非常熱情淳樸有求必應，整體還算不錯了。

msg:酒店位置非常不錯，就在金山嶺長城景區門口。早上或者晚上去爬長城，可以享受無遊人的長城。美中不足：1，早餐水平相當於農家樂，有待改善；2，院子裏蟲子螞蟻比較多；3，熱水需要放很久，洗澡不那麼方便。
另外，還有一件特別不愉快的事，不過與酒店無關。酒店旁邊的“海軍農家樂”，我們去點了菜，説好做好菜了電話聯繫，結果等很久沒有電話，我們一行人就去了飯店，哪知他們根本沒有做我們的菜。與飯店負責人理論，説應該至少告知我們情況，結果他態度極差，説沒有時間等你們，愛吃不吃，我們就這樣。很不誠信的商家，建議大家不要去他們家吃飯。

酒店餐飲較貴，含早餐。周邊沒有太多餐廳可選，要吃東西提前備泡麪啥的續命。有小便利店和手抓餅、煎餅果子賣，可以解饞，營業時間10:00-15:00左右。
酒店的服務有待提成，不足以支撐五星標準。
