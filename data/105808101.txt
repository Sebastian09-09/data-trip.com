msg:As expected, it is an apar**ent under Ascott. I have stayed in Ascott when traveling in other cities before. This Somerset CBD in Wuxi is my first time staying here. I am here on a business trip, and the service of this apar**ent is just like the enjoyment of a five-star hotel. From the moment I checked in, the staff enthusiastically provided me with help. Whether it was about the use of apar**ent facilities or the surrounding traffic conditions, they patiently answered one by one. During my stay, they also regularly asked me if I needed help. This meticulous care made me feel very warm.
The facilities of the apar**ent are also very complete and modern. The room is beautifully decorated and fully equipped. From the comfortable bed to the spacious living room, to the fully equipped kitchen, I am very satisfied.
The location is simply great! There are shopping malls such as Coast City, Bafanghui, and Joy City around, which are super convenient for shopping and ordering takeout. Not far from the door is Metro Line 4, which is also very convenient for travel.
Finally, the safety of this apar**ent also makes me feel very relieved. There is a security system in the apar**ent, and security personnel patrol 24 hours a day, which makes me feel safe and comfortable here.

Highly recommended to everyone! Next time you come to Wuxi, continue to book.
PS: The sky lobby has beautiful scenery, facing Taihu Lake, which is refreshing.

I didn't expect the environment to be so good that it was beyond my expectation!!! The ladies at the front desk were very gentle. They would ask if you had a car, give out parking tickets, and small gifts, etc. If you had any questions, they would answer them in time. If you were missing something, they would ask the little robot or aunt to deliver it. It was great!!! The floor was well lit and the scenery was great. There were shopping malls and scenic spots around. There were some entertainment facilities at the front desk, billiard rooms, and children's leisure areas. It was really unexpected. I was so satisfied with this trip!!! (I didn't take a picture of the room. When I remembered it, it was already messed up. I didn't feel like taking a picture, but it was really clean! The facilities were also complete. Thai pants spicy Zundu!!!)

msg:I stayed at Somerset in Nanjing and Hefei, and the experience was very good, so I chose it for this May Day trip.
Before departure, the hotel contacted and sent a map of the parking garage, which was very clear and considerate. The hotel also upgraded the suite very considerately. It is comfortable and clean, and the refrigerator is also very large. The fruit and drinks bought can be stored in hot weather. The kitchen utensils are also available, including microwave ovens and dishwashers. From some angles of the hotel, you can see Taihu Lake from a distance. The service is also very good. The hotel staff also took the initiative to introduce the nearby places to play. The staff said that there is a subway nearby, which can go directly to Huinan Ancient Town, which is very convenient. We drove by ourselves and did not go to the ancient town, so we did not take the subway. It is also very convenient to eat. There is a Coast City about 1 kilometer away, with many choices. The children like it very much and said that they will stay here next time. The only thing I think is a flaw is that the breakfast options are less than other hotels. It would be better if the breakfast could be richer! Overall, the experience is still very good

Parking spaces are tight on holidays, and cars are often parked in the aisles, which is very crowded.

Service: A brand under Ascott, the friendly reception starts a wonderful journey~💗Snacks and handwritten letters are given upon check-in. The quality is reflected in the details, which makes me feel the real intention.

Public area: 43F is equipped with a billiard room facing Taihu Lake, a gym, and free purified water and towels. The environment is high-end, quiet and private, and it can relax your body and mind after a busy business trip.

Environment: Located in the core area of ​​Wuxi Economic Development Zone, adjacent to Shangxian River Wetland Park, it is just a step away from the scenic spot.

As a frequent flyer of Ascott, this service is close to substandard.

What needs to be complained about the most is the property reception staff on the first floor:

1. Cars are not allowed to park on the ground. They have to park underground first, but there are many empty parking spaces on the ground at that time. There are serious cognitive problems with the level of the property management team, and the solution is how to manage and facilitate themselves.

2. Our group had a lot of luggage and they did not proactively provide a trolley. They only provided it after asking, and they did not help put the luggage on the trolley.

front desk:

1. When checking in, I was not told that special greetings were needed to clean the room, which made it inconvenient for me to come back at noon and the room was not cleaned.

breakfast:

1. The overall feeling is that it is contracted to a self-employed level team.

Facilities/Rooms:

1. Of the four elevators, the buttons of three are not synchronized, resulting in a waste of resources.

2. When checking in, there are supplies and traces of use left by the previous tenant.

In addition, for the pickle spoon in the morning, a waiter put the two people together and put the entire small spoon directly into the merged pickle bowl.

msg:各種問題
1. 酒店門面不顯眼，指示不清晰，
2. 走去隔壁大廈，給酒店打電話可以打30分鐘無人接聽
3. 好不容易有人接聽了，告知了位置，大堂在好高的樓層不説，入住讓簽一堆東西，果斷拒絕，我相信大多數人沒時間去讀他們的條款，建議過來住的人看看內容再決定要不要簽字。
4. 前台言語搞笑，各種東西標有價格，説什麼新房間等等，一進去我以為多新呢，水龍頭一開一池子黃色的鐵銹水！真乾淨…
5. 前台我要了個刮鬍刀，鬍子是拉下來的，不是刮下來的，直接多處出血點…你這個價格用這種物件你們覺得合適麼？
6. 早餐，雞蛋衹能拿他煎好的，要單面的跟要他命一樣，各種言語攻擊，好吧，我就站那裡等你，20分不搭不理，30分鐘催問説等他別的忙完。我們用早餐時候已經沒幾個客人了，最後這位大爺喊來了阿姨清洗鐵板，你們看看那個抹布，什麼顏色？！直接擦接觸食物的鐵板？！！！您再看看這位大爺，純手工操作，給你們大大的贊👍
7. 酒店房間有音響，關閉總控，關閉電視的情況下它居然還在出聲！孩子最後看的動畫片，關閉電視，關閉總控後，房頂亮着圓形的估計是煙感吧，一閃一閃的。音響居然穿出各種槍戰效果，低音炮更是效果一流，最開始以為是別的房間，出去看了一圈發現是自己房間的音響，低音，關閉電視，總控狀態居然在響！！
8. 酒店後期有回訪，要用禮品換好評。抱歉，你覺得能花這個價錢住你酒店我差你這所謂的禮品嗎？真逗！
