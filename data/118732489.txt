msg:The newly opened Sofitel Hotel in April 2024 is full of French romance, and every shot is a blockbuster. I made an appoin**ent with my girlfriends to have afternoon tea in the hotel lobby. The afternoon tea for two people, which costs 688, is half price for the newly opened hotel. The dessert level of the afternoon tea is better than that of other hotels, and the freshly ground coffee is also very good. ÔøºIn the evening, I returned to the hotel room to drink red wine. The hotel also brought us six red wine glasses. The service is considerate and customer-oriented. King, the staff at the lobby front desk, also has an excellent service attitude, making guests feel at home. Will come again. A hotel worth recommending. Ôøº

I learned that it was my birthday and I asked the kitchen to make a small cake. It was really solid and delicious. The afternoon tea included in the room is exquisite and delicious. The most noteworthy thing is the breakfast, the variety and quality are top-notch.
Here is a small suggestion: Since the guest rooms are fully enclosed, some guests will consider it if we can prepare some air purifiers, even if they are charged for use.

msg:On a business trip, I booked a twin room for one night with my colleagues. It was good that the hotel housekeeper contacted me in advance.

Hygiene: The environment of the public area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is very good. There is nothing to say about the environment of the new hotel. There are problems with the guest rooms. They smell like decoration. There is dust on the bathroom floor and the glass is dirty and has not been wiped clean. The rest is okay.

Service: It was good to contact the hotel housekeeper in advance to ask about your needs. The only problem was that when I was about to check out, I called to ask for a shopping bag. It took almost half an hour to deliver a shopping bag and it didn‚Äôt come, so I had to call to continue urging.


Environment: The environment is pretty good and I can‚Äôt fault it. The location is okay. The disadvantage is that there is construction at the construction site next door. It‚Äôs very noisy in the morning. I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all and was woken up.

Facilities: Needless to say, the new hotel has great facilities!

The hotel breakfast bread is delicious! Good value for money

The decoration of the room is too big, and the upper floors cannot open windows and there is no air purifier. The service attitude at the front desk and restaurant is poor and not user-friendly. It makes people feel a bit confused. When giving comments, they used the excuse that it was just opened. But in fact, it has only been open for two months, and it is a chain brand hotel, which feels a bit like a bad sign. ‚Ä¶There are many varieties of breakfast but the taste is very average. The orange juice is not even freshly squeezed. The original croissant and waffles are not bad... Generally speaking, I am sorry for the price. The price/performance ratio is extremely low... I will not come again.

Finally, I would like to like the location and design of the bathroom. It was a bit unexpected but I like it!

In particular, the housekeeper Cindy provided considerate service. After checking out, she reviewed her stay and added WeChat. She will come back in July. I hope the hotel will help make arrangements!

If you arrive at the hotel earlier, you can ask the front desk if there are any room types near the Pearl Tower. You can also look at the top of the tower, hahaha

msg:When I booked, I didn't know that this was a brand new Sofitel. It had just been open for trial operation for a month. The official opening ceremony was held the next morning after I checked in. Since it was originally a four-star old hotel, although it had undergone major renovations, the room type was still a little problematic. I stayed in two rooms, both of which were not large, and the bed was facing the door and the bathroom entrance. People who pay attention to Feng Shui probably don't like it. But this is the only problem, everything else is great. As soon as you enter the lobby, you will see a full sense of design. It is the kind of European retro colonial style, very beautiful, and super suitable for taking pictures. The design of the room is also great, the furniture is carefully selected, and even the decorative paintings are abstract and cubist, which is quite fashionable. The most important thing is that the small details in the room are extremely attentive, such as the charging port that can be plugged in type c is part of the sofa armrest, the lights and TV are all turned on by induction, there is a hanging iron and a hair dryer, the bath is Lanvin, and the tea bags are also good. If the price is right, I will consider staying again in the future.

msg:Seeing as it was a newly opened hotel in 2024, I booked an executive room with high expectations, but the overall feeling was a bit disappointing.
Advantages: New decoration, fashionable colors and styles, warm and thoughtful staff in both the restaurant and room service, good quality fruit welcome in the room, teapot and Pu'er tea, ample supply of free bottled water, and basically complete toiletries. Eye masks and earplugs were given (I realized this was a necessity at night...)
Check out was fast. The breakfast buffet has a complete range of Chinese and Western dishes, and the food quality is very good!
Disadvantages:
Check-in is slow! The reservation showed that check-in was available at 2 p.m. After arriving, I waited for 1.5 hours and still couldn't check in. I strongly requested to adjust a room down and reluctantly checked in.
The administrative courtesy is too simple and not comparable to that of a business hotel. Afternoon tea only provides one drink + small biscuits. Those who don‚Äôt eat biscuits can only have a drink, which makes Happy Hour too lazy to go downstairs.
The room was small. It was the first time I stayed in an executive room that couldn't accommodate a bathtub. There was only an aisle between the bed and the TV. The sound insulation is poor, not only the sound of the construction site can be heard outside the window, but also the sound of voices coming in and out of the corridor and the next room in the middle of the night is very clear.
There is no coffee machine, only two bags of hanging coffee, no refrigerator, free first round of drinks, and no moisturizer!

Although the price is not high, the overall feeling is a bit regretful. If the price is increased by one or two hundred, it would be better if the executive room facilities are improved!

Everything felt chaotic and unorganized, and follow-up on all matters was extremely slow. When I checked in, the front desk said that a welcome fruit bowl was given, but it was not delivered until I had something to do and left the room 2 hours later. After entering the room, we found that the air conditioner in the room could not be turned on. After reporting for repair, the engineer repaired it for a long time but could not solve it. In the end, we called the waiter ourselves and asked to change rooms. We waited for a long time and urged the waiter twice before the waiter gave us the door card. I was also a little disappointed with the cleanliness of the room. After entering the room, there was hair from the previous guest in the bathroom. The summary of this booking is that as a newly opened hotel by Sofitel, the software and hardware did not meet my expectations, so I was a bit disappointed. . .

At first, I wanted to experience this new hotel once with one lunch and one dinner, but later I found that the menu was the same whether I chose lunch or dinner (the menu was written on the Ctrip page). So that package is actually enough to experience one night.
I specifically praise the butler of our trip: King from the front office, because he made our trip very comfortable. Of course, the other staff in the hotel are also very nice. It is very busy during the holidays and you can see that the employees are like fighting a war during the peak period, but every reasonable demand of mine is patiently responded to and met one by one. Because I didn‚Äôt have time to drink afternoon tea, I asked the lobby to deliver it to the room and we came back to drink evening teaüòÖThe quality of the breakfast is above average among five-star hotels, and the fresh orange juice is the best, haha. The main lunch/dinner in the package is red wine stewed steak, which is tender and tasty. I forgot to take a photo. . .

As a senior hotel expert, I highly recommend this hotel as the most cost-effective super five-star hotel in Shanghai.

The speed is amazing hahahaha. In order to give guests a good experience, Miss Lydia does her best to help choose rooms. (Because the hotel is still in the trial operation period, although the air quality test is up to standard, if you have a sensitive sense of smell, some rooms on the upper floors may still have the smell of new rooms.) Miss Lydia came quickly and helped to change to a room with a good aromatherapy smell. She also helped to call for an air purifier. Balababala, I can't praise it enough hhh. The breakfast in the hotel is very good! It is exquisite among hotels of the same level. Regardless of the coffee beans, the coffee machine is from Lama! The coffee products are also the best among hotels of the same level! The waffles are so crispy and fragrant, and the strawberry jam is also delicious. I become a carb freak in seconds. You can also come and stay for breakfast hhh

Second, the hardware is very good and the decoration is also very tasteful! In terms of service, starting from parking at the door, security, doorman, front desk, and after-sales service! All good, very good! Special praise to Cindy for her attentive customer service relationship.
Third, the bad thing is that there should be an air purifier in each room and the decoration materials should be put away in time!

There is also a tea set specially designed for drinking tea in the room. I like it very much. You can see the picture for details.
I like the bathrobe very much. I was in a hurry this time. I really wanted to buy one to take away, but I didn't have time to ask the price.
The service was also very good. Everyone I met was great, especially when I was having breakfast. I was in a hurry and helped me pack a little before I finished eating. They also took the initiative to carry a bag for me and added seasonings for the noodles. (I haven‚Äôt written a review for a long time, but this service made me write one)
Some suggestions or things I will pay attention to next time I come:
1. The toothpaste in the disposable toothbrush set is packaged in paper, which is a bit uncomfortable to use. I will bring it myself next time;
2. There is no moisturizer, I will bring my own body lotion next time;
3. There is only a small table for takeout. It feels like it can only accommodate two customers' takeout. It is recommended that it be adjusted slightly.

Still a little confused:
No floor towel!
I don‚Äôt understand this, it doesn‚Äôt really affect me, but it still feels a bit strange‚Ä¶

To sum up, I will stay here again next time I come! Will also recommend to friends

msg:I just checked out of the W Hotel. Due to a change in my schedule, I temporarily stayed at the Sofitel Hotel, which is newly opened this year. It is very nice and has a stylish design. Ms. Lydia Wang at the counter checked in and asked about our needs, and took the initiative to help us arrange a quiet room ( I don't sleep well), and the air purifier is placed in the guest room, which is very proactive. Ms. Lydia Wang is very nice and also asks customers for their needs and opinions. The service is very good. There are a lot of suitcases, and the staff will help deliver them to the room and the car. It's very reassuring. I must like it!

I immediately sent a message to my friends on the first day of my stay to share that although there are not many staff, the waiters are well organized. The buffet breakfast on the second day was also very delicious. I wish the hotel a prosperous business and come again during the Spring Festival

msg:Before the holiday, I saw that this hotel opened and there was a live broadcast package, so I booked it. I glanced at the online promotion and it said that this hotel has a good Bund view and will be Sofitel's new flagship in Shanghai. When I booked it, the opening price was still relatively high. The calendar room was about 1500-1800, and the photos looked good.

Let me talk about the shortcomings first:

1. Public area.
The hotel is a renovation of an old hotel. Perhaps due to the original layout, some hardware areas are naturally insufficient. For example, the executive lounge area is so small that it is basically non-existent (the lounge service is temporarily placed in the lobby bar), the fitness area is small and the view outside the window is very poor, and there is no swimming pool.
We booked a twin room, and the room did not have a swimming pool.

2. Room.
There is a relatively bad design in the room. There is a row of wall lamps behind the bed, and this row of lights cannot be turned off. In this way, when watching TV, there is always a row of light hitting the TV screen, which affects the viewing. In addition, there is a single sink in the room. The mini bar is also charged.

3. Meals.
The package we bought includes an executive lounge, afternoon tea and happy hour. The taste of afternoon tea is actually OK (to be honest, the English afternoon tea in most hotels is very unpalatable, but this one tastes good), the problem is that the food during happy hour is similar to afternoon tea - even less than afternoon tea. There are no hot dishes, only some simple snacks and two or three simple drinks (maybe alcohol, I didn't pay attention). This is a pretty bad happy hour, it can be said to be the worst I have ever seen.

4. Service.
I waited for a long time when checking in, and it was completed at about 3:30. This is understandable, after all, there are many people on holidays. But the cooperation and proficiency of several front desk staff need to be improved. The attitude is serious, but the professional ability is not enough. Three or four people asked the same question repeatedly. The next day, I asked if I needed to make a reservation for dining in the western restaurant. The service staff who added WeChat said that they were not at work and asked me to ask the switchboard. I called the front desk and replied that she would ask the restaurant and reply to me after asking. Then I waited for an hour and a half and no one replied.

5. New decoration.
The smell in the room is okay, and I didn't feel anything after staying for one night. But when I first arrived at the floor, the smell in the corridor was still very bad. Later, the staff may have been using fragrance to alleviate the smell, and it got better. In addition, some hardware details of the hotel (such as the elevator) give people a feeling of being new but with traces of the old, such as some screws are exposed. There is still room for improvement in hardware maintenance.

There are also some advantages:
1. The variety and taste of breakfast are still quite good.
Especially in the bread area, I usually eat more Chinese food when I stay in a hotel, but the bread of this one is really delicious. I ate two or three raspberry breads and croissants, and they were surprisingly delicious.
2. The professionalism and attitude of the restaurant service staff are also very good. The lunch in the set meal is also good.

Why write so much, because this time I chose Puli in the previous one, and I like it very much. I came from Puli to experience this new store, and my expectations may be higher. In addition, this time I chose Sofitel between St. Regis/New Crystal Palace/Sofitel, and the price was similar when I booked (it seems to have dropped in the past two days), so I am quite upset.

I wish you continuous improvement~

The breakfast is provided in the Western restaurant. There are various dishes to choose from (especially the bread is super delicious!) Spread strawberry jam on the toast üçû‚úß(‚âñ ‚ó° ‚âñ‚úø) to refresh yourself (it is delicious). It is a pity that I did not experience the executive lounge courtesy due to time constraints (next time for sure)
At the same time, the front desk service is very nice. The front desk employee King is warm and thoughtful (a handsome guy ‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢), and a boy named Zhou Jianfeng (should be this name) carefully introduced Shanghai specialties to me. I have bought them and brought them back to my friends.
If I travel to Shanghai again, I will choose Sofitel North Bund again. The staff has good quality service and hotel facilities are in place.
You can also see the Little Dome in North Bund, take pictures and make films, 2 kilometers away from the Bund, and fly over by bicycle‚úß(‚âñ ‚ó° ‚âñ‚úø)

The welcome fruits and tea bags on the first day were very exquisite. I am also very grateful to Lydia for sending me a box of Sofitel chocolates. My son was very surprised. He still can‚Äôt bear to eat them now and said he wanted to keep them as souvenirs.
At the same time, I would also like to thank Hope at the front desk. In other places, it is quite troublesome to issue a special ticket every time I leave the store, but this time it was very smooth.
I had a great experience these two days and will be my first choice hotel in Shanghai in the future.
(My son saw me writing a review and asked me to add that he thought the ladies at the front desk were very beautiful and very nice to him. He said it was the same feeling he had when he went to the front desk to get chocolates, haha)

msg:This hotel will definitely be my next choice!
The location is the first choice for holidays. It takes only 10 minutes to cross the river from North Bund to the center. If I stay in those hotels on the Bund, the control is so bad that I can only go out in half an hour. üòè
The high-rise city view is transparent and comfortable. I am tired of the river view and prefer the hustle and bustle of people.
The perfect combination of French romance and Shanghai retro style. It is not as tacky as some hotels with magnificent gold and jade. The flower sculptures with a different view at every step seem to live in an oil painting.
Cleanliness and hygiene are my first criteria for choosing a hotel. Sofitel can be said to be very new. There are several popular hotels on the Bund that cost thousands of yuan. They look bright and beautiful. You will find that not only the facilities are old, but also the various stains on the carpet and the bathroom make you feel like you are living in an ordinary small hotel.
Finally, I want to praise the service. To be honest, I have stayed in several five-star hotels by the river before. The staff looked at people with their noses. It was a relief to be able to squeeze out a smile, so I have always had a bad impression of star-rated hotels in Shanghai. This time I stayed at Sofitel, from the heartfelt warm service of Mr. Jin at the door concierge to the thoughtful arrangements of the two staff members who checked me in, all of these made me like the hotel even more. Sofitel is a good hotel that truly understands what service is.
