It does have a swimming pool and a gym which was a bonus and I enjoyed it alot.

Clean wise, I think they should better scrubbing the edges of the bathroom floors and walls

msg:I stayed here previously and was extremely satisfied. However, this time the room I got had such a heavy cigarette smoke odor that it was giving me a headache and I couldn’t sleep all night. This is unfortunately typical in China - even though the room is designated as non-smoking, people still puff away and the smoke gets absorbed into the curtains and wallpaper. I only stayed here one night, but if I were to stay longer, I would demand a room change.

Breakfast buffet is nice.
Swimming pool is OK, but open late and close early, also  not easy to swim in the pool (too much people and children play..) The sauna is closed (because pandemic restrictions).
Location is convenient, near metro, near park with Auto Museum.
Bad point for an no-smoking hotel: lot of people smoke inside the rooms, restaurant,... hotel staff didn't care about it.

There was a slight hiccup, when the in-room safe was closed without me having the PIN. I called the front desk and 3 minutes later someone showed up with 3 shaving kits.... ;-)
Alright, I explained that it is the SAFE that I cannot open. I left and it was done after I came back from dinner.
Next day I went to work and when coming back, my PIN didn't work on the safe... I used the one they gave me, when it was reset and voila.... the safe opened. This means someone came into the room, and reset the safe again, with all my valuable inside... I was not impressed. Nothing was missing, but still...
The breakfast was mediocre at best and on the second last day I was told that there was no butter... I mean, c'mon no butter in a 5 star hotel? That seems rather dubious.

Great gym and indoor pool. We wanted to swim but the pool was filled with children having swim lessons. When we asked what time the lessons stopped for hotel guests to swim, we were told the lessons go until pool closing hours. Quite a disappointment and not to be found at a five star hotel. A/C settings needed a service person to set since after an hour the room was still at 28 C*. Buffet breakfast was nice. Starbuck's coffee available on the first floor.

The overall experience is perfect. I will come to stay here many times in the future. The style of the next door is also very good. The environment of the commercial street is also very good. The hotel's swimming pool is very quiet and there are few people. It is a constant temperature swimming pool, so don't worry. There is a temperature difference between the upper and lower water. The gym facilities are also complete. Overall, I am very satisfied with this stay!

The room environment and hotel facilities are better than those of five-star hotels. The breakfast is also very rich. Xiao Shen at the front desk checked in very quickly and saved time. It was very comfortable to stay here on a business trip. The hotel feels quite new. There are 37 floors in total. It is quite comfortable to have breakfast or buffet dinner on the 37th floor.

We booked an Ultraman themed room. It was a very creative idea. It added value without changing the room type. The Ultraman elements throughout the house were carefully decorated and free of charge. small toys. The child was reluctant to leave the tent at night, so he had to let him sleep on the bed and set up the tent. A slight disadvantage is that the bathroom smells like sewerage, and it would be better to have a bathtub in the parent-child room. Everything else was great.

msg:This year, I got a room through a flash sale in the live broadcast room, and I took my kids who like to stay in hotels to experience it before it expired. Located in the Anting area of ​​Jiading, this business-type hotel is a high-rise building with a triangular appearance and a total of 37 floors.
The reserved superior room was upgraded to a high floor for free (unfortunately, it was not upgraded to a parent-child room), and a free breakfast for the children was given when checking in at the front desk. Arranged to the 26th floor, you can see the lake view of the park opposite from the window, the view is not bad. The room size is okay, with a 2-meter bed, a long sofa next to the window, and a large TV. However, the desk does not have a lamp or business accessories (such as a website, ballpoint pen, letter paper, etc.). Children are provided with disposable toothbrushes and disposable slippers, but there are no children's bathrobes. If there is not enough mineral water, call the switchboard and they will give you two more bottles. The bathroom is separated from wet and dry areas, and the position of the shower head is a bit awkward, not very friendly to children, so they can only be held in hand the whole time. The shower room door is prone to leaking, so be careful when entering because it is slippery. The whole room was too hot, the air conditioner couldn't be turned on, the bed was a bit soft, and it wasn't very comfortable to sleep on. If you order takeout, you have to go downstairs and pick it up from the dining cabinet.
The breakfast buffet is on the 37th floor, but there is no view. You can start eating at 6:30 and finish at 9:00 on weekdays and 10:00 on weekends and holidays. The variety of breakfast is not particularly large, but it is filling. There are both Chinese and Western styles. There are more varieties of Chinese hot dishes than expected, and the taste is pretty good. There are noodles, rice noodles, rice cakes, etc. in the open stall, and the waiters will take the initiative to come Collect the plates and say excuse me.
You can park for free at the hotel. There are very few parking spaces on the ground. The underground garage is okay. Follow the signs and park near the hotel elevator hall for easy entry and exit. Every time you go out, you need to go to the front desk to get a parking ticket. When you go out, remember to take the ticket verification exit.
There is a park nearby where you can go for a stroll.

Although the construction has some history, the daily maintenance and software and hardware are well maintained. In terms of details, everything is covered with carpets. Maintained every day and kept clean, it may have something to do with the fact that the customer base is basically of a relatively high level and loves cleanliness.

The 37th floor, the highest point in the hotel, has a beautiful view for breakfast. You can jump high and look far away. The scenery is delicious and you can see all the buildings and small buildings at a glance.

The breakfast is rich and colorful, with a full range of Chinese and Western styles, and a dazzling array of fruits. The varieties change according to different requirements. It is an excellent place for business negotiations and leisure play.

There is also a tea station at the front desk, which is used daily. It is very considerate and adds to the goodwill. There are several supermarkets around, which is very convenient for buying fruit yogurt. There are parking spaces and underground garages at the door, which are very convenient. Guests can go to the front desk for free and get a parking ticket. , will come again next time

The hotel is very close to the company, so I stay here every time I go to Automobile City. It feels like home after a long time.

msg:Staying for three days during the National Day holiday was completely beyond my expectations. First of all, there are not as many tourists visiting Jiading as other places. Secondly, the hotel is worthy of being a five-star hotel. It has a swimming pool, fitness room, etc. The buffet breakfast is very rich, with both Chinese and Western options. On the 37th floor, ordering food at the hotel at noon is also good, and the service is very considerate. The room is clean, and it is cleaned every day and mineral water, tea bags, etc. are added. We chose a business room with an area of ​​15 square meters, which was relatively cost-effective. I lived on the 27th floor and could watch the sunrise in the morning and the sunset in the evening. Across the road downstairs is the Automobile Museum Park, which is very big and is good for boating, cycling, walking, and camping. It is just a short walk from the Automobile Museum. A very satisfying experience, I will stay again in the future👍☺

msg:I had an unpleasant experience at Ruili Hotel in Shanghai Automobile City around 8:40 this morning. I had breakfast in the cafeteria on the 37th floor. After finishing the dishes, I wanted to sit down and eat. When I was dragging the backrest chair, the chair was very heavy. To use my strength, I put my hands on the edge of the chair to drag the chair. There are nails on the edges of the hotel chairs. You wouldn't know there are nails unless you look carefully. Then a cut was made on the first knuckle of the right index finger. Next, the restaurant manager helped me treat the wound with a band-aid. After breakfast, I complained to the hotel lobby manager. She asked me to go to the hospital for a check-up, but I said it was not necessary. But my injury was caused by unsafe hotel facilities, so the hotel should bear responsibility and compensate accordingly. My request is to waive the room charge for one day (I stayed for two days). But the lobby manager was very cold and her tone made me think that I was making a fuss. She didn't agree to my request and said she would upgrade my room type if I checked in again in the future. Then I had to call 12315 to complain. Now we are waiting for the decision of the Consumer Protection Commission. I had a very good impression of this hotel, but now... I would like to say one last thing: I cannot praise the lobby manager's ability to handle problems...

The rash was itchy and I kept scratching it, and there were bugs in the room. I communicated with customer service, but there was no response. There was also a sales call about skin care products.

msg:Baby is a loyal fan of Big Mouth Monkey,
Taking advantage of this visit to the Automobile Museum, I chose to live here‼ ️

The hotel should be the most "busy" place in this area
· It's a pity that apart from the good environment, there is basically nothing around...
· It is 500 meters away from the nearest station of "Shanghai Automobile City" on Line 11, not too far or near, and it takes about ten minutes to walk
· It’s only a few minutes’ drive to the museum or Anting subway station (for dinner). If you’re too lazy to walk, just call a car. It’s very convenient.

🛏️Our room is on the 22nd floor, #2211
【Big Mouth Monkey Theme Room】
· The waiter said that all parent-child rooms are on this floor, unlike the 5-35 floors as stated on the reservation page, so there is no way to upgrade
· Room includes breakfast, baby is free, stay for one night

☺ The room is quite spacious, there are slides, swings and tents, and the baby has a wide range of activities
☺ Outside the room is the lake view of the park, a large area of ​​green, and a good mood (except for the abandoned building on the left hand side of the window that affects the view)
☺ The bed is wide enough to sleep a family of three, and the mattress is soft and very comfortable
☺ The floor is very clean, you can walk on the carpet with bare feet for a day without getting dirty, and the doll on the bed is also relatively clean (but the dog in the tent is not very good, it loses color and hair)
☺ The bathroom is separated from wet and dry, with all the necessary toiletries and even a sewing kit
☺ The TV can be watched but the channels are pitiful. Fortunately, the Wi-Fi is strong, and the download speed is quite fast

☹ The sound insulation effect of the room is too poor. I can hear every word on the phone next door clearly. There are also various large trucks and construction vehicles downstairs. Didi Didi, Didi Didi just after dawn
☹ The air conditioner is a strange thing, the heat and cold are uncontrollable... In the evening, it was turned on to 18 degrees, and the power was never cut off. As a result, we slept until one o'clock at night, and our mother and I woke up sweating profusely ( Still without a quilt at all!!) Then I struggled to sleep for two or three hours, and was woken up by freezing at five o’clock

🥣 Breakfast is served on the top floor of the 37th floor~
· Dinner starts at 6:30, and we are already looking for a seat when we go up a little after 7:00
· There are many things to eat, both Chinese and Western, and my favorite osmanthus cake
· The service attitude is very good, take the initiative to take a seat and provide a baby chair, and ask before closing

️ Summary:
️ ① The housing price is cheap, basically half of the price in the urban area
️ ② You can consider staying if you come to the nearby area to do business or visit the car museum. There is no need to come here when you have nothing to do🤦‍♂️
️ ③ Convenient transportation, free choice of subway, bus and taxi
️ ④ Go to Jiating Hui at Anting Subway Station for dinner‼ ️It is the nearest large shopping mall nearby, basically has everything to eat, and can also shop
️ ⑤ Friends who have sleep requirements be cautious‼ ️If there is any sound next door, I will suffer a little...
️ ⑥ Check in carefully in summer‼ ️ The temperature in the room is not controlled, it may be stuffy...

Due to the hotel's innovative business philosophy and catering to the needs of low-to-medium consumers, the hotel has maintained a high occupancy rate after the epidemic. In particular, the hotel buffet dinner has a wide variety and is very rich. The shortcoming is that ordinary food is the main theme, and there is a lack of high-end food such as lobster and oysters. The front desk manager gives you the privilege of upgrading to a high-rise lake-view room.

It is really good to experience the breakfast. The dishes are very rich and can satisfy the tastes of different people. It is worth recommending !

The front desk staff, Ms. Lu, answered my children's questions patiently and enthusiastically. The hotel room is pretty good, with complete facilities, the room facilities are very new, and the bed is very comfortable, which is quite different from some express business hotels. The breakfast room is designed on the 37th floor. It has a variety of varieties, and you can drink freshly ground coffee. You can also enjoy the scenery outside the window while having breakfast. However, it is a pity that the fog is a bit heavy in the morning, so I did not see the scenery outside the window. I will experience it next time. Overall, the value for money is excellent, and it is a very satisfying experience.

You need to get a ticket You can only go out, and the price/performance ratio is also very good. It's quite comfortable to live in. I'll stay here next time.

Sitting on the sofa, the face brick above the head will fall off. If it is not blocked by the background wall, the head will definitely be smashed (Figure 1). In addition, the ambient light ***** is so casually hung on the background wall (Figure 2), the water stains formed by water leakage on the bedroom ceiling have become "patterns" (Figure 3), and the spotlights are also drooping on the ceiling. It is extremely unsafe, and it is reminiscent of whether there is a modified camera (picture 4), and there are almost bare wire ends in the corner (picture 5). I reported to the hotel that day that although my attitude was sincere on the surface, the follow-up was simply perfunctory. The most annoying thing is that they promised to refund part of the room fee the next day, but there was no action after three days, and they really treated the customers as fools! ! !

msg:Checking in on the weekend, I stepped on a big thunder, and there is almost nothing in the room except for the tents and swings that children like. It's the worst five-star hotel I've ever stayed in, bar none!
1. As soon as you enter the door, there is a strong smell of smoke. If you want to change the room, the front desk tells you that the room is full and cannot be replaced, so you can only rely on the air purifier. As a parent-child room, shouldn't it be smoke-free?
2. The glass door of the shower room cannot be closed tightly, and the water splashes from the gap during the shower and flows to the ground, which is easy to slip.
3. The water temperature of the swimming pool is too low, which is completely unsuitable for children to swim in winter. Too few seats by the pool.
4. During breakfast, the waiter was unable to clean up the tableware and placemats in time, so they could only eat on the placemats with rice grains that were used by the previous customer.
5. With the child dragging the suitcase, no waiter took the initiative to help.
6. There is nothing in the mini bus, just a decoration.
Anyway won't go again.

Thank you very much for Xiangzi's warm service. He reminded us very well. The professional service left a deep impression on us. A free breakfast is also given, which is very rich and delicious. In short, the service is really warm and caring, and we look forward to his company next time. The room is arranged on a high floor with a very good view and cleanliness. If we have family members come here to play in the future, we will recommend them to stay at Ruili Hotel. It is really worth recommending!

msg:The breakfast was very satisfying, the food was refreshing, and the variety was good
The hotel is located in a very good location. It is next to the Automobile Expo Park in Anting Town, Jiading District. It is a few minutes’ walk away without driving. You can go and see it on the same day. Although there is nothing to eat nearby, it is very close to the subway station. There are also food near the station, which is very convenient. There is a handsome guy at the entrance of the hotel who will check the health code and itinerary code. The precautionary measures are in place and safe. The service at the front desk is very good and the attitude is good. Molly also took the initiative to add WeChat. It feels pretty good. All in all, the experience of staying is good. I will come to this hotel next time I have a chance to come to Jiading on a business trip.

The traffic here is more convenient, and the underground parking lot is very convenient. When you check in, the front desk is welcoming and the service is relatively good. Proficient, because I didn’t pay attention to it when I booked the room. I ordered one without breakfast, and the girl at the front desk gave it one. The breakfast is on the 37th floor. The variety is rich and the taste is good! The room is clean and tidy, but the room is a bit small, only 15 Square meters, the hotel’s infrastructure is complete, it is more convenient to take the elevator, and overall it is very good!

Check-in especially said that the higher floors are required, and I also helped to arrange it. Originally ordered one without breakfast, Xiao Lao gave it one, it was heartwarming and the service was very polite. The hotel breakfast is on the thirty-seventh floor, and I feel pretty good, but it’s a pity to enjoy the view while having breakfast. There are very few foods here in the hotel, but fortunately, you can order take-out. The hotel has a special take-out cabinet for non-contact delivery, which is quite good. It is also very close to the Auto City subway station. It takes about five minutes to reach the subway station. It is very convenient to travel. Next time, I will choose Ruili Hotel.

msg:The single room was redeemed with points, and the extra money upgraded the room to a double bed. The garden view provided is blocked, so you have to jump over the sofa to see the park. The hotel is generally clean, there are many elevators, parking is very convenient, and it is also very close to the park. It's just that the layout and facilities of the room are slightly worse than those of normal five-star brands. The crib is worth complaining about, whether it's the safety of the bed or the color of the bedding. The breakfast is quite satisfactory. However, overall the price/performance ratio is consistent with the overall price. When you arrived at the store, Chris**as decorations were already being put up, so you could feel the festive a**osphere in advance.
🔔Service: The receptionist at the front desk is Xiaoliang. The service is five-star. If there are problems, feedback and communication are relatively timely.

msg:One of the few high-cost hotels in the city that takes into account the environment, facilities, and entertainment. The early booking price is still very advantageous, and it also helped us upgrade to a suite. I feel that the price/performance ratio is up to the ceiling. Five-star standard hotel, not much else to say, the area is not large, but the height of the building, the rooms are beyond imagination, so the Golden Week can be imagined, fortunately the management is OK, breakfast and entertainment in order. The car expo park and car museum downstairs are good places, and it is highly recommended to check in! The overall service is pretty decent, maybe during the Golden Week relationship, a little bit can't keep up, the initiative seems to be a bit weak, and no one listens to the shortcut keys. The western restaurant is on the top floor and the next floor, occupying two floors with a good view. According to the five-star standard, the breakfast variety is not rich enough, and the taste is only average. The room is generally good, the floor-to-ceiling windows are not to the end, and the view is always somewhat limited. In addition, the glass exterior wall is too dirty and can be cleaned in a concentrated manner. The recreational facilities are complete, and the swimming pool is a bit small. Underground parking is ok, the lobby feels good, and there is also Star Daddy. There are a lot of elevators and they are fast. During the period of the epidemic restriction leaving Shanghai, this hotel is generally very, very recommended.

msg:Because of the epidemic, I couldn't leave Shanghai, so I took my children around, stayed in a hotel, and pretended to be traveling. I chose several hotels, and finally I chose this one. I was very satisfied with the comprehensive environmental hardware and services. First of all, I booked a parent-child room. The child liked it very much. The layout of the room was very happy for the child. Check-in was also very fast, Xiao Liao, the front desk clerk who checked in, was kind and kind. In the evening, my parents came to the hotel together. Ms. Liao quickly booked a luxurious bed room on the same floor for me. The family was very satisfied. The attitude of the waiters on the floor is also very good, and they will greet them actively when they see them. In the evening, I took my child to the 37th floor for a buffet dinner. Because the child had a little cough, I explained the situation to the waiter and went in first to see if the dishes were suitable for the child. The waiters at the restaurant also readily agreed. The attitude is very amiable, which is in line with the parent-child hotel. Take the kids to play in the afternoon. When you leave the hotel and cross the road, the entrance to the Auto Expo Park is very convenient. Moreover, the building of the hotel is relatively prominent around, and the view of the main building on the 37th floor is quite good. We live in the parent-child room on the 22nd floor, and the view from the window is the view in Figure 8. To make a small suggestion, the toilet set in Figure 6 is for children's toilets. It is recommended to make a hook on the wall, so that the small toilet can be placed next to it when adults use it. All in all, the hotel was very satisfied this time. The children liked to say that they would come next time. I also recommended it to several friends who plan to bring their children to play.

msg:Had a great weekend!
The child finished class on Saturday and went straight to the hotel. Check in at about five o'clock and check in is very convenient. And the front desk clerk was very nice and upgraded the room free of charge. The view is wider, and the 31st floor can overlook the entire park and it feels great. Put your luggage at 5.15 and go up to the 37th floor to enjoy the buffet dinner. It was 10 minutes earlier than the banquet (wrong time). The waiter is still preparing. But this has no effect. Wandering around the food, there are many varieties, barbecue sashimi, stir-fry, small hot pot, beverages, cold drinks, and relatively rich fruits. The tuna and octopus sashimi are great and fresh. All kinds of fungus hot pot are also amazing to me. Their snacks are also superb. The children one by one can't stop at all... Overall, I feel that the price ratio of bringing a buffet dinner is very high. The breakfast is also good and the ingredients are fresher.
The room facilities are well-regulated. The furniture is somewhat accomplished but it looks cleaner. It’s quite comfortable to fall asleep at night (maybe too tired and then drink some beer at night to help sleep...haha)
It’s very close to the Automobile Museum, so in the morning, I get up and eat breakfast and go to the museum to go around. The children play in the open forest.
It's perfect, I will experience this hotel next time I come to Anting

Start with breakfast in the morning and start a good mood for the day. The room is neat, clean and warm, and the floor-to-ceiling windows are a plus. I booked a luxurious bed with a friend, and it was very comfortable. There is a certain degree of privacy upstairs and downstairs. You need a room card to get to the floor. The aunts in the room have a very good service attitude. The takeaways you order are picked up directly at the courier cabinet at the door, which is really zero contact. I am very satisfied with my stay, and next time I come nearby, I will choose Ruili Hotel in Auto City. I hope that next time I can get a better price, Xiao Liao at the front desk has added WeChat thoughtful service. I look forward to experiencing the suite when the whole family travels next time.

If you take the subway, it is not far from the subway station, less than ten minutes, that is, the environment on the road is average. There are no large shopping malls near the hotel. The park next to it has a nice environment, it's very big, but there are few lights at night and it's a bit dark. The swimming pool in the hotel is good, big enough, and the water temperature is just right, not cold at all, but the number of attached changing showers is seriously insufficient. In addition, the pool space is very noisy when there are too many people. It is recommended to add noise-proofing design for the next renovation. The breakfast is good.

msg:The hotel guests are so messy. At the beginning, we checked into the room on the right of the 25th floor. The husband and wife kept arguing and howling. We called the front desk three times to help solve the problem. Changed the room and moved to the bathroom and sofa on the 35th floor. I found that there were cricket-like bugs and quilts on the pillows. Also during the National Day, this kind of hotel with no star rating is estimated to be useless if you complained and will not stay again next time

msg:First of all, let me talk about the biggest advantage of the hotel that is the price-performance ratio. During the National Day, the room rate was 658. Two movie tickets were given. It was on the second floor of the hotel. It was very convenient. For me and my parents, I gave two cars to the museum. Tickets, and 5 kg of Kyoho grapes. The hotel is opposite the car expo park, suitable for an outing.
The room is not big, 35 square meters, and it feels a bit crowded. To be honest, I personally feel that this long row of sofas is very tasteless and looks small.
Breakfast is on the 38th and 37th floors. Although there is a lot of people on the National Day, it is not too crowded. The overall dining environment is good. However, the cost of children's meals at 68 is also considered expensive among the international five-stars. However, although there are many types of breakfast, they are not refined enough, and there is still a gap with the general five-star. The coffee in Figure 7 is all instant coffee, and there are fewer types of pastries.
Then I will talk about some details. For a five-star hotel, the hand sanitizer in the bathroom is exactly like Figure 8, which is really a deduction item. In addition, as a parent-child hotel, I know that the package I ordered is two large and one small. Figure 9 is a bit out of date

msg:The surrounding environment of the hotel is very good, the park diagonally opposite is lined with trees, the river is wide, and it is very close to the automobile museum. It is also convenient to exchange tickets at the cinema next door, but the check-in experience needs to be improved. The breakfast buffet on the 36th and 37th floors is open, and the sound of pushing chairs upstairs is heard around 7 o'clock. The sound insulation is not good, which affects sleep. Guests who want to stay on holidays and weekends should try to avoid the 35th floor. In addition, there are many elevators in the hotel. The elevator downstairs is very slow, and guests complained about waiting in the elevator for a long time, especially when checking out, it needs to be improved!

msg:You can't go to Shanghai during the National Day holiday, you can only choose places to play around. This hotel was originally chosen because it does not increase the fare at all during holidays, and it also includes breakfast, which is particularly suitable. After I came, I found it was really good. First of all, the scenery is very nice. Looking down from the sky, it happens to be the car park. The green trees + green lake are so beautiful! Secondly, I try my best for breakfast. Because the eleven people have a lot of traffic and have to line up for breakfast, I think this is completely understandable. It is better than putting people in and finding seats like a headless fly. Now it is an empty table to enter the table, which at least guarantees the comfort of the people eating inside. And even if the cut-off time is 10 o'clock, the dishes are all enough (seeing a certain yilin and a certain xi Laideng commented that there is no food). It is also nice to stroll around the car park and car museum nearby. The little yellow duck cruise in the park is 100/hour, the classic double car is 50/hour, and the museum ticket is 60/person. The prices are all okay. Finally, the Hunan restaurant near the hotel, called Sanqiumo, is highly recommended, it is delicious! All in all, this eleventh trip to Jiading is very pleasant~

The disadvantage is that although there is a holiday when I go there, there is no buffet dinner in the hotel on weekends. In fact, this should be adjusted according to the holidays. The other is that if the billiards room and table tennis room are charged, they are clearly marked. I went to the locked door and asked about the situation. The charging method was not mentioned. The experience in this area is somewhat lacking. Breakfast because of the holidays, although there are many people, supplements are still very active! The park next to it is very comfortable to stroll around, and there is also a bar, which is just a short walk away.

Hotel room as a 5 star is very standard, but the new one is very clean, the pool is great, the water is not cold, and the foam board can be borrowed.
Breakfast is in 37L, there are more Chinese and less Western, but I don't like Western, so it doesn't matter.
The car museum is 10 minutes drive and there is a car exposition park a few hundred meters

Let’s talk about the restaurant first. They don’t seem to know that the area is only half open for diners. We were already seated at 7:30, and we had to go to the right side without air-conditioning and sit down because it was too hot and we put our scarf on the chair. , I left at around 8:40 and waited for the elevator for almost 10 minutes before going downstairs. When I came to the room, I remembered that I didn’t take the scarf and wanted to go upstairs. Who knows that I waited for another 10 minutes in the elevator hall on the 19th floor and the elevator didn’t come. The restaurant asked me to ask for help, but I didn’t have it for more than 20 minutes, and the scarf was gone.
Besides the indoor swimming pool, there are 2 lanes for swimming lessons for the children from outside, so it seems a bit crowded. I don't know why there is no conditioner in the bathroom, and there is no body lotion on the dressing table. However, the lifeguards and the cleaning aunt are still fulfilling their duties.
Then talk about the room, the sanitary condition is relatively satisfactory, after all, it has only been open for 2 years. But it is inconvenient that there is no coat hook in the bathroom, and the bathroom socket is broken. There are many TV channels, and the induction lights on the porch and clothes hanging area are well received. The bedding is comfortable.
Except for the girls at the front desk with a smile on their faces, the staff members seen in other areas of the hotel have no habit of greeting them actively. It’s a bit too much, I hope it can be improved. After all, the baby said that he was very happy for two days and will come next time!

入住酒店這麼多次，我也很少評價，雖然酒店客服人員又是抱歉又是送小禮物的，但是，因為沒睡好導致行程縮短一天，票改簽又沒趕到，重新買票，真是一晚沒睡好 接連不順暢。

訂的598元的標間，房間小的無法形容，所謂35平米實際12平米都不到，每張床小的和嬰兒床一樣，大概1.1米寬，睡覺容易掉床下。所謂的景觀房不就是個窗外有塊再普通不過的一塊荒地嘛，難道非要對着一堵牆或一個一個建築垃圾場才不算景觀。
總之，性價比極其差的一次訂房和餐飲。
順便説一句，所有服務員都繃著個僵硬的臉，像工資被拖欠的樣子。太不可思議的一次訂房與餐飲

先説優點：
酒店位置很方便；早飯很豐富；電梯多且都是高速的；房間安靜。

接下里説一下缺點：
（1）入住之後我身體不舒服，訂了一些葯品，希望能送到酒店房間，結果送葯的和酒店溝通後無果，衹能自己堅持到下樓去拿，出差這麼多次第一次遇到。
（2）房間網絡極差極差。和酒店溝通後送來網線，結果一樣，最後衹能用自己的手機熱點完成了幾個小時的辦公。
（3）是否可以考慮換一個牙刷供應商，刷完牙之後滿嘴都是牙刷頭的毛。。。

第二天上午，步行前往附近的汽車博覽公園野餐，下午在公園泛舟遊湖（我們坐的電船100元/小時，另付按金20元）、繞園騎行（50元/小時，另付按金100元），有興趣的還可以去汽車博物館逛逛（就在汽車博覽公園內，60元/人，1.3米以下小童免票）。

msg:10.1-10.3號入住，總體來説，國慶期間不錯的一次出行體驗，附上詳細親子攻略行程。交通方便11號線下來500米就到了。
1，攜程上預訂的，799兩晚園景房包含2天的雙早，這個價格秒殺所有親子網站，而且行程自由度也高。圓景房是2米大床，圖一就是34樓拍出的景色，可以看到附近的汽車博覽公園，房間沒有浴缸，有個沙發。
2，10.1號上午11點多就到了，順利入住，得知1號到4號室內游泳池特別開放到晚上10點，很貼心了。入住以後白天打車去了汽車博物館以及上面的小童樂園，晚上去室內泳池玩水，酒店有提供手動的打氣筒
3，10.2號自助早餐在酒店最高的37樓，早餐的麪條還可以，西瓜也很甜，別的一般般。由於當天32度，比較熱，所以早餐以後打車去户外的農場，餵了小動物，下午2點不到就果斷回酒店，給娃補覺。下午4點多出門去汽車博覽公園划船。這裏要特別提一下，之前做攻略的時候，還以為酒店走去公園要1公里以上，其實酒店靠近公園的東門很近，大概300米左右，而且東門進去就是划船，汽車博覽公園晚上也營業，下午4點多太陽沒那麼曬了，進去正好劃電動船，100元1小時，雖然價格不便宜，但是湖比市區的公園大很多，一邊欣賞夕陽西下一邊觀賞湖邊美景，很愜意。遊湖結束以後，附近吃個東北菜，回酒店又可以游泳了
4，10.3號自助早餐➕游泳，退房。這裏的游泳池是1.3米深，有3個泳道。
最後説一下服務問題吧 
有些員工服務意識不足 我的房間空調有點小問題 第一天第二天都找人來修了 和前台反饋的時候 也不夠積極 還好遇到winnne大概是經理吧 妥善幫我解決了 感謝[雙手合十]
還有2號3號的客流量明顯比1號大多了，從室內泳池和早餐就能感受到，尤其3號的早餐，錯峯過來，還是要排隊20分鐘以上，不可思議

早餐豐富度很一般，尤其是麪包蛋糕類不是很好吃。
酒店唯一孩子可以玩的泳池，房間卡片上寫着21點關閉，帶着孩子20:20多到達，已經不讓進了，説20:40就關門了。難道游泳半個小時是不能遊的嗎？且解釋態度極其不好！這個上面我感覺他不配5星酒店的服務！

先是給安排在31層，視野不錯，但一進屋就熱氣。維修工對此見怪不怪了，房間室温仍30°C，發現走廊36℃。同時看到周遭房間的住客都在叫維修工[流汗]換房磕磕絆絆到9層，房間面積縮了，景觀不如高層，但室温舒適了呀。所謂的高級房vs豪華房區別主要就樓層高低。
早餐為了景色，設在頂樓，所以也悶熱。
整個空調系統問題很大，建議夏天住30F以下，要麼冬天去[白眼]
游泳池有外面的培訓班，高峯期客流比較大，人聲鼎沸。
每次🚗出去，還要前台一張領停車券，原始操作手法[吐]

以前單身出去旅行的時候，從來沒有關注過酒店的服務，前台辦理入住，離開退房，行李自己帶着全沒問題，即使服務生提出幫助一般也會拒絕。
現在帶崽出來更重視服務了。晚上9點半左右到酒店，4歲的崽已經睡着，包套在手上，抱着崽，拎着小帽子，前台衹有1人在給他人辦理入住。期間帽子掉地上，等了幾分鐘也沒有其他服務人員幫助，衹能抱着寶寶艱難蹲下自己撿。過了幾分鐘另一名服務員也出來辦理入住，艱難辦理後自行找房間。
入住後，發現訂的親子房沒有寶寶牙刷和拖鞋。雖然當時不急用，第二天撥打前台電話也及時送來，但是親子房的物料為什麼不能配齊呢？畢竟帶孩子的家庭才會預訂親子房呀。
這次親子出行體驗不佳，酒店更適合商務人士吧。

msg:安排了33層的房間，視野開闊，乾淨整潔，早餐在36,37層，國慶期間人比較多，服務員會幫忙找用餐座位，還是很貼心的。疫情期間，不出上海，在這裏住一晚，看場電影，逛逛公園和汽車博物館，也是不錯的選擇。

msg:隔音不太好，隔壁説話聲音大一點還是按門鈴的聲音聽的很清楚，竟然還有小朋友國慶還帶着樂器晚上十點了還在吹拉彈唱，服了。等待電梯的提示音也挺煩人，可以更安靜一點，不用反覆提示吧。位置挺好的，去對面汽車公園和博物館很近。

前台臉色超級難看，跟服務扯不上關係。更何況微笑服務。
環境很好，4樓有棋牌室，頂樓餐廳環境不錯。
旁邊有核酸點。

msg:酒店還是可以的，一入大堂就感覺特別很好，朋友推薦這家酒店。外表看上去高大上，酒店大堂也很氣派。前台服務很好，説要升級房間也很快的幫忙解決了 客房乾淨，衞生，保潔阿姨們都十分禮貌，三樓有泳池和健身房，去的時候人不是很多，對於我這種喜歡運動的人來説，真是太棒了!四樓聽説還有棋牌室和SPA，可惜沒能上去看看。早餐在頂樓， 種也挺豐富的，餐廳服務員收餐也很及時。停車也很方便。總之來説，這是一次十分滿意的入住體驗， 還會選擇這家酒店。

msg:訂了兩晚酒店，床頭旁的一排開關，第一個是總開，這樣設計不是很合理，長者搞不清楚的，很容易誤關。
70歲老母親在老父親衞生間洗澡的時候，把總開給關了，衞生間瞬間黑暗，想想有些後怕，退房時和酒店前台反映過此情況，雖然是商務型酒店，但也希望考慮到各類住客人羣。
