msg:The hotel is located halfway up the mountain, surrounded by a large lake, with buildings scattered around the lake and cherry blossoms blooming by the lake. It is very quiet and feels like a paradise. The room is very modern and clean, equipped with smart voice equipment, and the balcony is large, with a view of the large lake in the center of the hotel. Very good stay experience.

msg:I saw online that this hotel opened in 2023. I chose this hotel when I went to Tianmu Lake for a weekend trip. The hotel is very close to Tianmu Lake, with a nice green environment around it. The hotel is very quiet, with convenient parking. The room is large and newly decorated. The facilities are basically complete, but there is no refrigerator, and the water pressure is not very high when taking a shower. Breakfast is now buffet style, with limited food choices. There is only American coffee, and you need to go to the front desk of the restaurant bar to ask the waiter to help you get a cup. There are only four tables in the restaurant. When I came to have breakfast, it was already full. After getting the meal, I could only stand awkwardly. But in the end, the waiter asked us to eat in the private room. Overall, except for the breakfast, which was not so satisfactory, everything else was good. Although I wanted to give it only three stars, I still chose to give it four stars. If the store can improve the quality and quantity of breakfast in the future, I will consider this store next time I come here.

msg:A super great hotel. I went there during the Chinese New Year. I spent a lot of time choosing and booking this restaurant. After I went there, I found it very quiet. The hotel front desk asked me to communicate with them on WeChat if I had anything. I could also order dishes in advance, and the dishes were included in the room rate. There were also fireworks in the hotel at night. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, I will choose this place again next time I have the chance. Although the hotel's breakfast has few varieties, it has noodles and wontons, and the taste is also good. The whole hotel gives people a very comfortable feeling. In the end, the child's ID card was dropped at the hotel, and they helped to express it to the home, and also sent some small gifts. Thank you very much. I will definitely go there again if I have the chance in summer.

msg:This hotel has a nice environment and new facilities. I booked a two-bedroom villa with lake view. The room is big enough, but there is only one bathroom, which is a little inconvenient. Another big problem is that the sound insulation of the house is very poor, especially at night, the sound of the guests talking, coughing and sneezing upstairs is too clear, and light sleepers can't afford it. I especially praise their service, which is very good and responsive. The breakfast is not very good and needs to be improved. I stayed for 3 nights. Only wonton noodles were available for breakfast on the first day. For some reason, they were gone from the second day. There were only bread and steamed buns. There were also few fruit varieties. But the lunch and dinner in the restaurant tasted good, which is worth a try. The hotel will add hot spring facilities later, but only for the rooms on the first floor. The privacy is slightly worse. It would be much better if it was changed to a single-family house.

msg:The family room we booked was good.

However, the hotel does not have a hot spring, and all entertainment activities have to be done near the hotel. To eat breakfast, you have to walk from the room to the restaurant (key is that it is outdoors), and it is freezing in winter.

The hotel has a shuttle bus, but you always have to wait for a long time.

The most complained thing is the restaurant. It feels like there is no air conditioning, and the breakfast is not even at the three-star level. For dinner, you have to wait for 20 minutes for white rice, and then they said it was not steamed, but reheated. The restaurant is also slow to serve dinner. The dishes are limited and the price is expensive.

In short, the service of the staff is at most at the level of a three-star express hotel.

The hotel has no underground parking spaces, and outdoor parking spaces are also limited.

There are farm villages near the hotel.

There are not many hotel rooms, which is more private than other places. The whole hotel environment is very good, the room area is large, and the breakfast is also semi-self-service. The hot food is cooked to order. We chose a meal package. The meal is not a set meal. You can order any dish on the menu. The Tianmu Lake fish head soup on the table is really good. The taste and appearance of the dishes are very high. The taste is very good. The service of the front desk lady is also very enthusiastic. When checking in, she gave us warm black tea.

The hotel facilities are very complete, clean and tidy and very new, and it is well maintained at a glance. The room is super large, the decoration style is very pleasing to the eye, and the large French windows can see the small lake and swimming pool in the hotel. You can lie flat in the hotel for half a day. The garden is beautiful and the dog is very happy to play. The restaurant tastes good, and the breakfast is a bit simple. It is recommended to add freshly ground coffee.

1. There is no hanger in the bathroom to put towels and clothes;
2. There is no full-length mirror in the room;
3. There is no charging station in the parking lot (it is said that it will be installed later);
The overall stay is still very good

It was very dangerous to drive a long way on a dark mountain road at night. I arrived at the hotel at 8:30 and was told that there was nothing to eat, including instant noodles! I was hungry until the morning, and there was only breakfast at the level of a fast hotel. There was not even a noodle stall that made wonton noodles! There was only a paddling pool that could not be used in this season, and no indoor swimming pool! You dare to call this a resort? !

msg:客觀評價下不足: 洗澡水忽冷忽熱；泳池遠看很好看，但是游泳池水裡死蟲太多，水裡還有苔蘚漂浮，仔細看水非常不乾淨，非常多的漂浮物，讓人心理很毛躁；目前房間裏是沒有小冰箱的，大熱天不方便；房間裏衹有礦泉水，其他茶包啊咖啡啊都沒有，這個也很少見的，電話前台問是否有咖啡，説是前台可以給我沖一杯，但是強調必須我自己去前台拿，結果衹有清咖，説了一堆聽不懂的原因，也是無語了，想自費一杯咖啡也是沒有的，後來還是開車去外面買的咖啡。工作人員非常少，而且有一些都搞不太清楚情況，比如問前台泳池多深，她説2米，我反覆確認是2米？？她説是的，要不我再問下，然後就沒有然後了。其實是最深處1.2米，但是1.2米處都是蟲啊，哎。
整個度假村工作人員比較缺乏，小頭頭倒是很積極帶着外面請來的宣傳的人到處拍視頻，對請來宣傳的人態度很好……和客人對話情商就比較低吧。
整體來説環境是好的，但是度假村裡配套很缺乏，工作人員很少，培訓也不到位，再加上上述的一些問題總是讓人心裏不太舒服吧。想着客觀請假下，我挺後悔選擇這家住了兩天吧。我自己的鍋，被高分和價格矇住了雙眼吧，以後自己又多了一份選擇住宿的經驗吧。
