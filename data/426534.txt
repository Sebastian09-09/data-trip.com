msg:Amazing stay, incredible service, so comfortable! We've been traveling around China for nearly a month for business and out of all the places we stayed, this is the best! We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment where we had plenty of room to spread out and relax. After traveling so long, the first thing we did was take advantage of the washing machine. The helpful instruction manual was so easy to follow and housekeeping was kind enough to deliver a laundry rack for us to dry some of our larger pieces. It was so nice to have the option to cook our own meals after eating out for so long. Anything you needed, it was just a phone call away. 

Tina, Seven, Lena, and Queena at the front desk helped us check in quickly and always answered our questions with a smile on their faces. Kenneth was so great in helping us with our luggage and suggesting delicious restaurants in the area. Summer the housekeeping supervisor was so generous with her hospitality — we had some guests visit and ran out of water and tea bags, which she so kindly and quickly replenished for us. The housekeeping team is honestly the best we've encountered. They are so thorough and thoughtful. We loved staying here so much, we even extended our stay to 3 more days. We'll definitely come back when we return to Chengdu!

Want to thank the Parkvue team for making our stay so pleasant and comfortable. You are all a credit to your profession!

I had to go to the reception and got them enabled again twice. There is a flashing car on monoxide alarm on the ceiling. It’s very annoying as it flashes very bright every 5 seconds. The reception is like entrance to the mall. It doesn’t feel welcoming. Just offer water for instance. I’m sure these could be improved.

The hotel is sparkling clean and exceptionally well maintained. I do not know how old the hotel is, but at the time of our visit, it appeared brand new.
All staff that we encountered, either in person or on calls, were wonderfully pleasant, polite and helpful.
Breakfast was more than adequate and the order from your table for made to order breakfast items was excellent.
Sparkling clean swimming pool, sauna and steam room with two plunge pools (one warm & one cold) was a fabulous find.
I highly recommend InterContinental Residences Chengdu City Center.

Staff was very polite, the room was clean (very comfortable bed), location is perfect, and it made our after-midnight arrival as pleasant as possible. 

Only disappointing point was that due to the ongoing virus situation, the pool was closed (at no fault to the hotel). Looking forward to going back when the pool is open!

msg:The staff were great. We made a number of requests including a couple of extra sewing kits for repairing an item of clothing that was torn, and they did everything that they could to accommodate us. A nice gym and swimming pool, table tennis room as well as a full sized snooker table in another leisure room, means that that if you're looking for something to do then there are definitely options. It was also nice having access to the outside terrace roof as well. My partner's favourite place though was without doubt the relaxation room which contained 6 massage chairs, just the thing to relax after a long day. If there was one small quibble it would be regarding the TV channels on offer which were slightly limited, but with other things to see and do it's only really noticeable in the morning when you might want to see a selection of news channels or likewise at night time. On a personal level, we did also experience a bit of a problem when we checked out. Upon arrival you have to pay a deposit of 1000yuan, which is fine. Upon checking out we were presented with our room service bill and I was asked if we wanted to have this taken out of our deposit, which we agreed was the easiest option. The room service came to a little over 900 yuan, and when they processed this I assumed the change from the deductions taken from the deposit would be returned to our alipay. When this didn't happen, we again assumed that it might just take time to show up on our account. But after checking out of our next hotel in Chongqing where we did the same thing, the change due was deposited straightaway into our account and that's when we realised that we had not been reimbursed by the intercontinental. We emailed them regarding this asking for our change and we've heard nothing back from them. So I would advise people to make sure they get their invoice at the end off their stay and to also ensure you get any change that you're due straightaway.

My apartment was just okay, the walls were chipping, washer and dryer not in good shape, ruined some of my clothes. The food in the hotel was the biggest disappointment. Everything is inflated in price and poor quality. Dan Dan noodles were exceptional but you can get them all over Chengdu. Breakfast was picked over and cold at 8:30....no western options really mostly Chinese which is fine but it was cold, an hour in. ?? All service cuts off at 11pm, which is frustrating. All in all I’d stay at a different branch or another brand all together.

msg:The location, sanitation, environment and service are all very good, but the facilities are just so-so. Although the suite has many facilities that other hotels don't offer, for someone like me who has to measure weight every day, the scale is the most critical part. However, the scale in this room was broken. I called for repairs and it was still broken after the second repair. It was not easy to use until it was repaired a second time. As for the elevator, I always didn't know which elevator would open first after pressing the button. I had to stay focused all the time and see which of the six elevators would open, otherwise you would easily miss the elevator. In addition, you need to swipe your room card to enter the elevator. In a hotel of this level, the room card will not automatically display the automatic processing by floor. When carrying large bags and small bags, sometimes you have to swipe the card first, and then manually press the floor, which is very inconvenient.

The attendant at the gate is not very enthusiastic. When I arrived on the first day, I parked my car at the door and honked to wave before he came over. It may be because it is an apar**ent-type hotel. The underground parking lot is relatively large and clean. When you go out, you can park for free by telling the hotel the license plate. When checking in, a male attendant named Shi was at the front desk of the hotel. Because there were five adults staying, an extra breakfast was given, which I was very grateful for. The room has three bedrooms, one living room and three bathrooms (one bathroom has a bathtub in the suite, two are outside, and one bathroom outside the suite cannot be showered). There is an open kitchen with a dining table, a refrigerator, a washing machine and a dryer. One bedroom has a terrace. The room is arranged on the 37th floor, which is relatively quiet. The room has windows that can be opened, and electric curtains in the bedroom. There are many people during the peak breakfast period, not too many varieties, and the taste is okay. For takeout, you can inform the deliveryman in advance to let the delivery robot deliver it directly to the room. There are many places to eat around. There are several good barbecues across the street, and there are also several hot pot restaurants, which taste okay. There is also a famous palace pastry in Chengdu nearby.

The best thing is the service at the front desk of the hotel, very helpful, thank you!
The hotel has a very good location and is very convenient for eating and traveling.
What I am not satisfied with is the hygiene. The picture attached shows the garbage in the gaps between the faucets, not to mention the carpets. The carpets in the hotel are really, really dirty and old.
Breakfast was average.
When the hotel was first renovated, it should have been equipped with high-end facilities, smeg Cisco duravit hansgrohe... After a long time, the details were a bit disappointing.
The Yanlord Land shopping mall has a good setting, but the hotel is a bit worse.

However, when I checked in, I booked two rooms and was only given one high floor, which is still the 18th floor. Compared to the previous InterContinental, which was always the 39th floor, there are still some changes. I called at night to ask for pillows. It took 5 times for someone to pick me up. I tried to open the balcony door and asked twice but no one answered me... In addition, I found that the layout of the rooms on the 10th-18th floor is different from that on the 39th floor... In general, the hotel's hardware facilities are very good... I must visit it every time I go to Chengdu Stay… service is slightly down…

There’s also a special sale that’s super cheap. The newly opened Cosmo store opposite is also a less crowded store.
In addition, there are many bicycles downstairs, and you can ride to Taikoo Li in 10 minutes.

msg:Every time I come to Chengdu, I usually live in the InterContinental's executive apar**ent, but this stay makes me absolutely disappointed in the health service of InterContinental! This time, I booked a two-bedroom suite for three nights. On the first night of my stay, the floor drain in the master bathroom was very smelly. I added fragrance after feedback from the front desk, but the smell is still there. I think the guest room should be clean during the Universiade. I didn’t ask to change the room when the room was full. I just treated it with disinfectant. But on the third day, when I came back after swimming outside, the child said it smelled very bad as soon as he took a bath in the bathroom. I thought it might be because of the smell. I didn't care about the problem. After the child took a bath, I went in to take a bath and found that the smell was not only anti-odor but also the smell of latex paint. Because I am allergic to latex paint and paint, my skin turned red and developed a rash. , When I came out of the bathroom, I found that there were white marks on the floor that could not be wiped off. I checked and found that the floor was not dust, but it looked like latex paint after drying, and the area was quite large. So I communicated with the front desk on the phone and asked their manager to see how to deal with it. As a result, a cleaning lady came up with a rag and said that she wanted to plaster. I stopped the auntie's behavior, and then a manager on duty appeared , I asked her why the smell of latex paint and latex paint appeared. She said that there was no maintenance done today, and she wanted to go to the monitoring, and then said to do sanitation. Then the manager left and there was a long wait. After 8:30 p.m., I got text feedback saying that there was no maintenance, but I couldn't explain the source of the latex paint, and then kept saying it was dust 😂 Not even a face-to-face apology or concern! This is the service of InterContinental Group! Because we have children, we changed rooms at 9:30 pm, and the surveillance video we asked for kept saying it was too big for us to see! The manager on duty just said that he went to check the monitoring and never showed up again. It has always been just WeChat communication. After one night, I complained to the headquarters of InterContinental China, and what I finally got was repeatedly asking me how I wanted to deal with it. It felt like I wanted them to compensate for the rhythm of the bleeding. Until the check-out at 10:30 am There was no follow-up, so I asked again to see the general manager of the hotel, and at 11 o'clock I finally got a response from the general manager who agreed to talk to me! I found that Chinese is broad and profound. Discussion and communication are two meanings. We really need to learn Chinese well! At 11:30, we finally waited in the lobby to arrive at the general manager. It depends on the person's face that we are the injured party! The general manager is a Malaysian, and he may not understand Chinese well enough. Of course, he greeted me politely. I also asked him to sit down and communicate. The previous manager on duty sat next to him without saying a word. When I asked again When it was dust or latex paint, the general manager admitted that it was not dust, and apologized to me in person, and also asked us to forgive the inexperience of the manager on duty. I can understand, but I also know that this is a routine for complaint handling. The general manager also asked me if I had any other requirements. In fact, I really have no other requirements. I am just dissatisfied with their handling attitude and have been refusing to admit it Negligence in doing things and finding all kinds of excuses to evade responsibility, and then they will send you some fruit and red wine and send you to another room. This is the attitude of Chinese people towards Chinese people💔 But this general manager is at least on the surface It was in place, sincerely apologized, and arranged a car to take my child and me to the airport, and called me to invite us to have a working meal in the restaurant because of the heavy rain during lunch. In fact, the complaint is not because I really don’t like the InterContinental brand, but in the process I feel why our young duty manager has such a tough and irresponsible attitude towards Chinese people! I don’t know when we will be able to treat Chinese people with the same respect as we treat foreigners!

msg:Are you sure this is Intercontinental? A five-star hotel with service as its purpose?

I came to the Intercontinental, but it was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.

The hardware is OK: The location in the city center is excellent, close to the shopping center. The hotel facilities are worse than Ruihua. It may be a few years ago. After all, the apar**ent rooms are larger and maintenance is somewhat difficult, which is understandable.

The fatal wound is the service: I have never had a quarrel in a five-star hotel. First, the quality of the service staff in star-rated hotels is relatively high. But Chengdu Yanlord InterContinental has refreshed my perception. I just checked in today. I put down my luggage and took my child downstairs for dinner. The child broke his leg and went to buy medicine. After I went downstairs, I found it was drizzling. In the past few days, there was a thunderstorm in Chengdu. The rain came in a hurry. I wanted to go to the front desk to borrow an umbrella. The front desk said that there was an umbrella in the room, but it was inconvenient for me to go back after my leg fell, so I asked if there was an umbrella on the first floor. Usually, the concierge at the entrance of a five-star hotel must have an umbrella. The front desk saw that there was nothing to do, so he said coldly that there was one at the gate and they could be borrowed. But it may be gone now. I went to the gate immediately and saw that there were still 7-8 umbrellas. I reported my room number and asked the waiter at the door to borrow an umbrella. He first told me to go to the room to get it, and then said that it is not raining now and cannot be borrowed. I had no choice but to take the child outside, but it was indeed light rain that was hard to see with the naked eye. I was worried that it would be heavy, and I would borrow an umbrella when I went back, and the waiter at the door quarreled with me. 1. The child insisted on going back to the upstairs room to get an umbrella, but there were many umbrellas at the door. 2. What is the rule that you cannot borrow an umbrella if it is not raining? 3. A man is still in the service industry, he has no sense of service, and he quarreled with a guest over an umbrella at the hotel entrance. He said you can complain to me, okay, I remember his name is Yang Hua. I called and complained to the manager on duty, and the other party's attitude was okay, saying that I would write it down and report it to the leader, and then there was no further information. Nothing at all. In the Intercontinental Hotel, I was troubled by the concierge at the gate for a long time in order to borrow an umbrella, so there is no further article.

I only stayed for one night and spent 2300. I have no sense of service at all. The waiters have a bad attitude and have no sympathy at all. The quality is too poor and the hotel has no management. I will never come again.

You can order eggs Benedict or eggs for breakfast every day. Volume, other self-service or a la carte meals are very good, the service staff are also very clean, and the attitude is also very good. I stayed for a total of five nights, and I feel great every day. I recommend it to everyone who comes to Chengdu. live~~~

Style apar**ent, the hotel staff is very cold and will not help if you can't help. Especially the two front desk ladies at the door, who had a black face when checking in. Apart from asking me to pay a deposit, they didn't say a word and they couldn't smile. They looked like they were owed wages.
I originally wanted to live in an apar**ent for the convenience of raising children, but I was very disappointed. The management of InterContinental was really bad, and it was completely incomparable to the Marriott I stayed in before. An apar**ent worth nearly 3,000 yuan is not worth recommending at all. It is in a mess, with no service, and the breakfast is terrible, like a hodgepodge of leftovers that have been heated up from the night before.

msg:I haven't been back to Chengdu for seven or eight years. I used to live in Yanlord almost every time I went back to Chengdu. The location is good and the facilities are acceptable, but this time the overall feeling is not good. The cleanliness of the room is very poor, and there are many dead spots. The countertops, floors, tables and wardrobes are covered with a thick layer of soil. I don’t know how long it has been cleaned. There is a picture below. You can only clean it yourself when you check in. The overall service is not good either. From the waiters at the downstairs door to the reception staff in the lobby, the overall service attitude is very indifferent, which does not reflect the enthusiasm and professionalism that should be served at all. When checking in, the guest is told that the express takeaway can be replaced by the concierge depar**ent Delivery, but the delivery guys did not allow them to enter the gate at all, so the ordered goods could only be collected by the customers themselves. In a world where robots deliver takeaway deliveries in serviced apar**ents across the country, this kind of service can only be disappointing.

The one living in the front is not bad. On the last day, the product ordered can be postponed. I checked out at four o'clock. The children and the elderly were tired from walking, so I didn't rush to check out. At 14:30, the waiter knocked on the door with an unhappy face and asked me when cleaning could be done. I answered after a while. , as soon as she left, the power in the room ran out. The elderly and children went to the bathroom in the dark, took their luggage out to check out, and were kicked out. When they checked out, they asked the front desk about the power outage. The front desk didn't know, and it was probably the waiter who did it. , it really damages Intercontinental’s reputation!

msg:I had expectations before I checked in. I communicated on the phone about changing the time and the size of the extra bed. The service attitude was good. After checking in with a trusting attitude, I didn't expect it to be so bad. I poured my own mineral water into the kettle and boiled it twice. I didn't realize how dirty the inside of the kettle was. I didn't realize that the water was full of black slag until I poured the water to make milk for the children. The root cause of the inspection is that there are a lot of black residues and hairs in the kettle, so that I boiled the water twice and poured it out, it was still dirty. I was very angry and called the front desk to deal with the problem. No one came for about 20 minutes. It was already 11:00 in the evening, and the children had no water to drink milk. Until I called and complained that I couldn’t deal with it, a staff member brought me a hot water bottle and a few bottles of water four minutes later and left. The matter was over for the hotel without even an apology. Sanitation is the most serious problem. I chose the parent-child room, which is really disappointing. The room environment is very stuffy. We couldn't sleep well one night. The children were so young that they were sick the next day. There is no evidence that this problem is attributed to the hotel. I can only say that it is a toss. Please be careful when choosing this hotel with your baby!

We also took a walk to Wanda for a buffet, and then took a short walk to People's Park. Opposite is the Sichuan Opera Theater. The shopping mall diagonally opposite is also worth visiting, as it has a great sense of design. The staff are mostly warm and friendly. The details of the room may be a little lack of attention. For example, in the two-bedroom apar**ent, there is only one box of napkins. There is nothing but chopsticks in the first drawer for knives and forks in the kitchen. I told the front desk on the phone that scissors and spoons are needed. The waiter was very helpful. It was delivered quickly. The breakfast is a little lacking and tastes bad, but the convenience of takeout can make up for it. The Land is next door downstairs and has several delicious restaurants, which is a good choice for dining when you don't want to travel far.

In the end, I took the initiative to ask and asked if it was possible to upgrade. Room type, she said yes. When I checked in, the smell in the room was nauseating. It wasn't the smell of smoking, it was the smell of people relieving themselves in the guest room. It was very disgusting. I applied for a room change, but the shower head in the second room was broken and water splashed everywhere. I applied for a room change again, and then I realized, you didn't upgrade me to a room at all? I booked this room type myself. I asked, and the front desk said it was a mistake and upgraded me to a room. I went to the hotel for breakfast the next day. It didn’t matter that there was not much food. My daughter drank the freshly squeezed orange juice. Half a cup of it said it had a weird taste. I took a sip and it was obviously broken. I asked the waiter inside and she admitted that it was broken. It tasted completely different from the second cup I poured later. Then she said, "No more." Pour me two glasses as an apology? This is funny, this is the breakfast buffet, do I need this kind of apology from you? We didn't have breakfast here the next day. In the end, even the washing machine in the room was broken. . I washed the clothes in the middle of the night. After washing, the door of the washing machine could not be opened at all. It was too late. I wanted to wake up and contact you to come to the room to see what was going on. When I woke up the next day, the door of the washing machine was fine again... My clothes Just leave it in there for one night... I'm really speechless! I changed rooms three times, not to mention the trouble, everything was not working, the refrigerator was empty, there was nothing, not even the welcome fruit, I was drunk, I didn’t know who was staying in this hotel, especially with children and adults. Don't stay if you are a stranger. I have never stayed in such an annoying and disgusting hotel. Please block this place.

The extra bed in the living room at the back will be responded quickly. It's a pleasure to live together. The breakfast is very rich, and the children and the elderly all eat very well. It exceeds the breakfast level of many five-star hotels.
The location is very good, and it is very convenient for takeout for midnight snacks.

msg:During this trip, we played all the way and stayed in many five-star hotels. Yanlord InterContinental ranked last. But the most expensive. Since I have children, I want to book a bigger room. We are members of Priority Club again, so we found this Yanlord, where we can wash clothes and cook, and plan to use it as a place to stay for the last two days. The price is as high as more than 1900 (suite), set for two nights. I can honestly say that the service attitude of the hotel staff is good, but the quality is broken. Since the room had not come out when we arrived, let us go to the restaurant to rest and have a coffee break. The result was just a few pieces of fruit and a few popcorns, and I was about to cry with laughter. What's even more terrifying is in the back. I took the room at two o'clock and walked into the room (1601). I thought the bathroom was blocked, but it was not. I could smell it in every room. It was very uncomfortable. Later, my aunt came to the two bathrooms to put aromatherapy, and closed the bathroom door, but the smell was still unbearable, and the children couldn't stand it. I checked carefully and found that the smell was wafting out of various air conditioners, which made me feel extremely disgusting. Such an expensive house price, the room is like this, and then look at the kitchen, there are no tableware, how to cook? I asked my aunt, and my aunt said that it is normal to have a little smell. Now it's hot, and the tableware is not suitable for the lower floors. It is only available on the upper floors. After adding some children's products, the aunt moved over and threw it away. I couldn't stand it anymore and asked the front desk to change the room. The concierge sent someone with a very good attitude. They showed me room 1108. In fact, it still smelled, but it seemed that the taste of cooking was not the smell of feces. The smell of vegetables has not disappeared, we agreed to move into room 1108. In fact, the smell of this dish has not dissipated at night, it is really very, very speechless. Later in the evening, I went shopping and came back late, so I made do with it for one night, and wanted to leave the next day. The kids are calling out the Intercontinental. I'm going back to my hotel yesterday. I really don't want to stay longer. Intercontinental's brand, the ventilation system can be like this, which is also an eye-opener for me. The most unhappy day of this trip to Chengdu. Will not come again.

I went to the front desk the night before Confirmed the continuation of the stay and did not inform that the card needs to be swiped again 2) The room was not cleaned until 6 pm, and I was still waiting for cleaning in the lobby downstairs. 3) The staff at the front desk are very unprofessional.

The hotel overall is very good, the only downside is that it is a little old and the furnishings are old. The rest are very good, breakfast, swimming pool, etc., with a baby is great.

The air conditioner is not very good at night, and the startup sound is very loud. Ordering food in the hotel restaurant at noon, the action is a little slow, and the wait is quite long. The price is not very reasonable, a small plate of fried celery with shrimp, ¥98. The swimming pool of the hotel is very good, recommended.

🍃Environment: Four people stayed in a two-bedroom suite for four nights. The room is fully equipped with kitchen and laundry facilities, just like at home. Other public facilities are also very complete, the swimming pool is very beautiful, the public locker room can also have hot springs and saunas, which is very good, and finally a massage chair massage is perfect.
🔔Service: The room service staff is very friendly, and the requirements are basically met, and the response speed is very fast even in the middle of the night
🧹Hygienic: Such a large suite, basically no sanitary corners, very good
🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient to go anywhere in the city center
All in all, it is very worth staying, and the price/performance ratio is very high among the hotels of the same level in the city center.

There are many types of buffet breakfast, omelette, pancake waffles can be made to order, the presentation is exquisite, and more exquisite than the other Intercontinental in the same city.
The difference between an executive apar**ent and a hotel is that it feels more at home. There is a kitchen with small pots for friends to heat up some snacks, it is perfect for a stay

msg:I am a very picky person, so when I check into a hotel, I will consider it more strictly. The following is my feedback.

🚗 Transportation: Free parking lot, many parking spaces

🧹Hygiene: Although it is a hotel built in 2012, it is well maintained and clean.

🍃Environment: The location is located in the city center. It is convenient to take a taxi everywhere. It is not recommended to drive to places like Taikoo Li. There are few parking spaces there on weekends and the parking fee is expensive.

🔔Service: The focus this time. The hardware facilities still maintain the consistent standards of this intercontinental, and the software needs to keep up. I am also an old customer of InterContinental. I am very satisfied with the service during my stay here. Here are some examples:

1. Swimming: On the night of check-in, I took my child to the swimming pool. Unexpectedly, the child fell out of the swimming ring and was drowning. The lifeguard Mr. Pu quickly jumped into the water and rescued the child. Many thanks! I have always thought that the lifeguards at the swimming pool are either playing with mobile phones or sitting on chairs shaking their legs. This time I completely broke my superficial thoughts and realized that the lifeguards at Intercontinental are very dedicated and you can rest assured when taking children to swim. You can still have a complete sense of security when encountering unforeseen dangers.

2. Check-in: Very considerate and fast, and the staff helped me arrange the room properly in advance. Checking into a hotel with children is originally very troublesome, but this check-in helped me reduce a lot of steps. Once again, I am very grateful to Edison for her early arrangements and cooperation, so that I can take care of my children with peace of mind.

3. Injury trea**ent: I took my child swimming again during the day and she slipped and was injured. I contacted Edison, who quickly helped me contact other staff, arrived at the scene quickly to treat the wound, and always offered concern and condolences. It was originally a small injury, but the InterContinental staff did a good job in sharing information. You can always feel taken care of and cared about, and your heart is full of warmth. There are many good hotels, and you can feel the deep human touch. There are indeed very few hotels, thank you again.

4. Breakfast: Not to mention the abundant food, the staff in the restaurant are very enthusiastic, and there is a plate design for special orders of food, even if the order is only a small omelette. After having such a breakfast, the food and service were excellent, and it started a happy and positive day. Very thoughtful too.

msg:The location of the hotel is excellent, Yanlord Land Plaza is downstairs (with some dining options). The two-bedroom suites are large in size and equipped with washing machines, dryers, stoves, ovens and rice cookers, which are more practical and convenient. Opposite the hotel is the Sichuan Theater, which performs the quintessence of Furong (it is said that it is second only to the Sichuan Opera performance of the Shufeng Yayuan). But the sound insulation of the hotel is poor, and the noise on the road outside is continuous. The breakfast was of poor quality, not many varieties, and the same (we stayed for five days, and the kids didn’t want to eat it on the third day). Moreover, the use of room temperature milk instead of fresh milk is contrary to the quality of a five-star hotel. The cleaning aunt is also very unprofessional. After cleaning, she doesn't feel bright and she comes to clean up very late.

這次來成都旅遊入住好幾天，從前台到清潔人員都親切有禮，同行長輩們很滿意，於是又續住了幾晚，入住期間有一些要求都很好被解決了，要特別感謝顧客經理Queena小姐姐親切又耐心的回答。國際級六星酒店的專業素質與服務，妥妥的。

出遊感受：這裏市中心打車到太古裏、文殊院、杜甫草堂等旅遊點很方便，不過寬窄巷子附近很堵。 附近散步可以到人民公園，還有cosmos商場

早餐：早餐好吃。規模中等，自助菜色每天有變化，不用擔心口味吃膩。不過，沙拉吧要是有橄欖油就更好了。

設施：按摩室 健身房都很不錯

服务好，職員細心，年三十深夜找小商店購物，他们細心指引後，为防我们走錯方向，暗裡通知门口職員再提示我们；
晚上很宁靜，玩累了也有很好的睡眠質素。早歺不算很丰盛，但也有中西食品的選择。
地点很好，楼下商場隨时可以喝咖啡，步行約15分钟可达春𤋮路，距离人民公园也是約15分钟的路程

msg:1.酒店位置很好，距離地鐵站和周邊的商圈都非常的近。
2.可能是業主方推出的套餐，入住的時候沒有詢問IHG會員事宜。因此此次入住期間個人喜好方面酒店沒有在意。
3.健身房24小時開放非常好，設備的維護和品質也不錯，可惜沒有“冰鎮”飲用水。
4.住酒店在仁恆廣場裏的餐廳還會有折扣。
5.開業10年左右的公寓酒店，仁恆作為業主方可以看得設備的投入是下成本的，烤箱等用了smeg的設備，而且維護的也不錯。
6.客房是公寓類型，但整體表現符合洲際的SOP，但個人認為員工做事可以更用心一些。
我要求7點30左右開夜床，第一天晚上客房員工可能不瞭解喜好，因此地巾，拖鞋和床品放在床的右側。第二天客房員工知道我喜歡床的左側，有調整地巾和拖鞋的位置，但水杯和水依舊放在右側的牀頭櫃。Bespoke這一塊可以更人性化一些。

酒店的服務更是超讚，入住時的Diaphenia和退房時的陳奕涵都給了我非常及時周到、體貼入微的服務，讓人真真的感受到賓至如歸，特別有家的感覺。謝謝你們，下次再見！
