We are satisfied with the compensation. And would recommend this hotel to others.
The hotel is just like 10steps away from an MTR exit (D). And we could walk via the MTR tunnel to the Mall. 

It's also like 5mins walk away from the park nearby, where we played outdoor Kart and indoor ski, both were great. We didn't try the other amusement rides in the park though.

msg:The Hotel staff was amiable and accommodating.  Although very little English was spoken, the staff tried to speak Cantonese to my wife. We were upgraded to a suite which was clean and very big.  Our package included a daily buffet breakfast and VIP lounge access for a light meal in the evening.  We were given choices out of 4 sets.  The set meal in the lounge was average but it was very cosy and quiet with all kinds of drinks available.

The best part of the hotel was the bathtub with a view!  

The buffet breakfast was OK.  Tea and coffee were very average.  You get better quality from your room.  There are a variety of international cable TV channels.  To my disappointment, the very latest international movie collections come with a daily flat rate.   The size of the TV is a bit small compared to the size of the suite.  The sound bar was fantastic though.

We were very happy that we did not smell cigarette smoke in the hotel except near the smoking venue.  

The hotel is very easy to get to by the underground train.  You can have weatherproof access to the gigantic mall across the road via the train station.  Hard Rock Hotel is positioned to take advantage of the local facilities for a family holiday.  It is very popular with families from HK.

Rita, Lily and Karry from the executive lounge were fantastic, very attentive and super friendly to our kids and extremely thoughtful, they noticed  I had the last piece of the sourdough bread and heard I said it was so yummy and arranged extra for us! My family felt all your colleagues are served from the heart! We enjoyed our trip very much and we sure will be back soon!

Most of the time, just the Cafe and Rock Shop, but we have stayed at a couple Hard Rock hotels.  This hotel is fantastic.  The people, the cleanliness, the pool, the room...all 5-star.  It is across from the mall and next to the Mission Hills country club and driving range.  The only downside is it is away from most of the attractions at Shenzhen, so a Didi or Metro will be needed to get anywhere.  We came by Ferry, so it was a long Metro ride to get to the Mission Hills station (it was also holiday in China). But, we will be back!

Service impressed me a lot, esp when I couldn’t get my courier delivered to hotel before I leave, the in charge Mr Simon Kang has taken initiatives to talk to the delivery guy for me, noting that my putonghua is not as fluent. Mr Kang has also tried to solve the issue for me by providing his contact number so I could contact him directly to follow up the receipt of my parcel after I left Shenzhen. Mr Kang managed the front desk very well and was very caring to customers in need. The service is the main reason why I have booked this hotel for my next visit!

I extended my previous stay at the Hard Rock Hotel. I honestly really liked the room that I lived in. It was spacious and very big.  The staff were friendly and efficient during check-in, my stay and after I checked out. 

Breakfast had a lot of options, but were mostly Chinese-style. Very delicious, in my opinion. 

Based on my previous review, I'll stay at the Hard Rock Hotel again. ni

This hotel was booked for my friend’s 31st birthday. A representative, Ms. Moon, gave us her we chat so my friends and I could communicate with her. Upon arrival, we were checked in my Ms. Bella. She spoke English well and this made it easy to communicate with her. The gentleman at the front door during our stay was also very helpful. A get Customer Service Team.

Amenities 
The room was very spacious. The. bathroom is good size. It has a huge mirror, a shower plus a massive bath tub. The room was clean. It was quite welcoming. The only minor thing is that there was only one bath robe but upon request we received more. There was a also a huge standing mirror at the entrance of the room. Wine glasses were also in the room. 

There is also a pool, that is clean and at the time empty when we went there .

Concierge 
The Concierge not only collected but delivered the package I had shipped to the hotel to my room. That was appreciated. So is you need to ship something you can access that service as well. 

Food 
The buffet style breakfast was awesome as well. There was a wide variety of Western food. There was so many options to choose from. The employees in the buffet restaurant was also very helpful. 

Dinner at Hard Rock Restaurant 
We had dinner at Hard Rock Restaurant downstairs the hotel. The food was really good and the prices were also affordable. There was a live show and the singer sang some a few songs for my friend’s birthday. The restaurant staff was extremely warm and helpful.

It was a great weekend and we all said we want to go back to Hard Rock Hotel soon.

The hotel room was really beautiful and spacious and the tub was huge and a BIG plus for me and why I chose this hotel. I was completely satisfied with my room. The downside is because I stayed on a Monday and Tuesday nothing was open, this includes the Hard Rock Cafe, pool area/rooftop bar and the other restaurant which is located inside (I don’t recall the name at the moment). The good thing is there’s a mall directly across the street with other options to choose from. In addition, a train station is steps away from the hotel. Overall, the hotel was really nice and I would like to go back but only if the places within the hotel are opened.

The Hard Rock experience is excellent - no complaints about the hotel itself. Bed, bath, view, shower all great. 

My only recommendation to travellers is be wary that on Chinese holidays there will be A LOT of kids. This is something we should’ve foreseen but it is what it is. If you go on a non holiday weekend, it would be different. If you’re looking for kid friendly activities, this is the spot.

msg:Hard Rock Hotel Shenzhen was born for rock and roll. Guitar and rock elements are everywhere in the hotel. There is a huge guitar on the outer wall of the hotel, which represents HARD ROCK with a long history. The ceiling of the lobby on the first floor of the hotel is a shining golden dragon flying, which is particularly special. The special thing is that it is artistically combined with pieces of metal on a drum set, which will definitely amaze everyone who sees it. In the lobby on the first floor, you can also see many items used by European and American stars, including costumes of the famous Elvis Presley.
              When you go up to the second floor of the hotel, you can see an entire wall made of real electric guitars. It is estimated that only HARD ROCK has such a large amount of effort to realize such a shocking art decoration.
               The hotel staff checked me in enthusiastically, quickly and accurately. Thank you to these young friends, it's great! I want more MARK, he enthusiastically provided me with effective service. 
                The hotel's buffet restaurant is on the 5th floor, and it's also where I have breakfast.
               The hotel room was great! There is a big bathtub, the deluxe room also has a sofa, and the TV in the room can be adjusted to any angle. It really feels like ROCK. Other hotels really don't have such a function.
                The gym is on the 6th floor of the hotel, and there is a children's playground on the same floor. I went to swim in the swimming pool on the 26th floor. There were so many cute children playing in the water with their families. It was so fun!
                It is very convenient to go from the hotel to the MALL opposite. You can get there through the subway tunnel in front of the hotel. It is also very close to the ski resort in the sports commune. You can just walk to Exit A of the subway station. There is a tunnel right in front of the hotel. Shenzhen's latest and most popular greenway, "Niuhu Water Greenway", is right in front of the hotel. I didn't expect it to be so convenient. MARK told me this information. Otherwise, I would have spent most of the day on this. groping.
               In short, you should come to Shenzhen HARD ROCK, it will definitely make your trip worthwhile.

msg:Shenzhen Hard Rock HARD ROCK is indeed the right place to come. Not only is the transportation here convenient, but Shenzhen Metro Line 4 is right at the door of the hotel. The hotel is right outside the D exit of the "Mission Hills" subway station. It is extremely convenient and fast. The Hard Rock Hotel is very distinctive and full of hard rock style. I personally like it very much. I guess there are no hotels of the same style and level in **************. I am lucky enough to experience it in person today.
You can immediately come to the first floor lobby of the hotel from the subway exit. I was stunned here. I saw a huge golden dragon flying vividly on the ceiling. A closer look was even more surprising. It turned out to be made of countless cymbals on the drum set. It was really amazing. When I went up to the fifth floor lobby where I checked in, I saw a whole wall made of countless real electric guitars. It was particularly shocking, and it also made me fall deeply in love with such a special HARD ROCK. It has a rock style! The staff at the front desk were enthusiastic, kind, and skillfully handled the check-in procedures for me. Thumbs up! I would also like to thank MARK for taking the initiative to introduce me to the hotel's facilities and surrounding tourist routes, and providing guests with thoughtful and meticulous services.
Going up to the room was another thing that made me extremely happy. I saw that the room was very spacious, the bed was very large, and the huge floor-to-ceiling glass outside was a pleasant golf course and a group of villas dotted in between. Sitting on the sofa by the window, you can comfortably enjoy this wonderful moment. There is also a huge bathtub in the room that must be mentioned. I have never seen a hotel with such a large round bathtub. It is completely no problem to soak 3 or 4 people.
The hotel has a rooftop swimming pool on the 26th floor, which is suitable for family play. There is also a children's playground and gym on the 6th floor. There is a Southeast Asian restaurant on the 2nd floor and a CAFÉ restaurant on the 1st floor. There is a resident Philippine band. I like the HARD ROCK burger inside.
The hotel's breakfast is in the restaurant on the 5th floor, with a rich variety of varieties.
There is also a "Niuhu Water" greenway, which is currently the most beautiful greenway in Shenzhen, at the entrance of the hotel.
Opposite the hotel is the "Mission Hills New Town" where you don't have to worry about eating, drinking and having fun. You can also walk a few steps to the Ice and Snow World, the Guanlan Oceanarium, and the Sports Commune. There are horse riding, trampolines, craft workshops nearby, and the Guanlan business card "Guanlan Printmaking Village" and the China Printmaking Museum. It's really impossible to play in so many places in two days.
Fortunately, I came to the right place and found the right hotel. I still have to thank MARK.

The trees along the way are shady and the lake is soft. It truly fits the concept of a greenway. It is right out of the main entrance of the hotel. The entrance is extremely convenient! The Hard Rock Hotel has such a unique location advantage, and its unique rock style is one of the reasons why I came here. When I arrived at the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, I was surprised by a huge golden dragon on the top of the HARD ROCK ceiling. According to reports, it was made of cymbals from a drum set. I really admire the hotel's careful construction. When I arrived at the check-in lobby on the fifth floor of the hotel, my heart was warmed again. I saw that on the background wall of the counter, there were many electric guitars hung with unclear trees. They were genuine. The "FENDER" electric guitar can be taken down and used on the spot. It is estimated that in the whole of China, HARD ROCK is the only one that has fulfilled this theme very appropriately. It is very praiseworthy! I would also like to thank Mr. MARK. When I met him during check-in, he proactively introduced me to the hotel and nearby attractions, and optimized my itinerary and time.
       The hotel room is really unique, spacious and bright, with large floor-to-ceiling windows, a large round bathtub, a large bathroom, a large bed, and even the quilt on the bed has a dark pattern of a guitar. I really like this style.
         You can use the rooftop swimming pool on the 26th floor of the hotel for free. I saw there is a KTV ROOM beside the swimming pool. It would be great to have a party here! There is a gym and a children's playground on the 6th floor.
          There is a buffet restaurant on the fifth floor of the hotel, which is very delicious, and the breakfast is even richer!
           In the evening, we also went to the CAFÉ on the first floor of the hotel, where there was a performance by the resident band.
           The hotel is very close to the Ice and Snow World. It only takes 300 meters to walk. Directly opposite the hotel is the Mission Hills MALL, which has all kinds of food, drinks and entertainment. Children love it. The nearby Guanlan Prin**aking Village and Guanlan Ancient Market are also rich in culture and history.
            This trip to Shenzhen Hard Rock is indeed well worth it! Thanks also to the enthusiastic staff here and MARK.

In addition, the toilet door in the room is broken and can't be closed. I asked the aunt to check it out, and she said she would find someone to fix it, but it was not fixed when I checked out. It's broken, and it's really embarrassing to take a shower.
The restaurant on the first floor has a large portion. I ordered a meal for two and couldn't finish it.
The buffet in the morning was 100 yuan per person. The taste and quality of the food were okay, but there were not many varieties, and it didn't feel worth it. The restaurant staff was very good. After eating, paper cups were provided, and coffee could be taken away.
When checking out, the male manager in the lobby was very enthusiastic. Let me send a baby doll, and the clown 🤡 was also great. There was interaction when making balloons, and the emotional value was full. The attitude of the front desk ladies Cathy and Doris was also very good and gentle.
The only thing that was not satisfactory was the children's club. It was too small, there was not even a slide, and there were very few books. The courses only included making cookies and handicrafts, and they had to be paid separately. Maybe I had too high expectations when I read Xiaohongshu.

At the same time, they upgraded the room for free and took the initiative to bear the cost of the tire repair, which reflects the hotel's high-quality service quality.

Now I finally have the opportunity, and this time I came to the Hard Rock Hotel Shenzhen to stay. From a distance, I saw a huge guitar hanging on the outer wall outside the hotel, which was particularly eye-catching. It was imprinted in my mind - Hard Rock is guitar, and guitar represents the concept of Hard Rock. I was deeply shocked when I just entered the lobby on the first floor of the hotel. I saw a golden dragon made of countless drum cymbals, flying high on the ceiling, opening its mouth as if to absorb and welcome every guest who entered the hotel, and it seemed to say to me respectfully: WELCOME! Then I went up to the lobby on the 5th floor to check in, and I was surprised again. I saw that it was full of guitars. On the background wall of the front desk, there were so many real guitars that I couldn’t count them hanging on the entire wall. It was so spectacular! The lady at the front desk handled the check-in procedures for me very skillfully and professionally, and reminded me of the precautions during my stay. I thank them and Mr. MARK here for providing me with a lot of travel advice and strategies. I am really happy. When you go out, you should know more about the local information to save time and energy.
I took the room card and entered the room. Wow! The room design is very rock and roll, which is my favorite design. There is also a super large round bathtub that I have to praise. It is facing the really huge window glass. You can take a comfortable bath while looking at the golf course outside the window. Another praise!
The 6th floor of the hotel is the gym, the 26th floor is the swimming pool and the rooftop bar, the 1st floor has a bar, and the bar has a resident band. Breakfast and buffet dinner are on the 5th floor. The dishes and taste are really good! I heard that there is also a Southeast Asian restaurant. I will try it next time.
The location of the hotel is very convenient. It is at the "Mission Hills" station on Line 4. The Mission Hills MALL is opposite the hotel. It is super close! This is also great. There is also an ice and snow world and an ecological park nearby. There is a golf driving range at the door. What's more, there is a "Niuhu Water Greenway" right at the door of the hotel. It is very beautiful and super awesome! There is also a tourist spot "Guanlan Prin**aking Village" nearby, which is very quaint.
This trip to Shenzhen Hard Rock is really worth it!

The hotel is only a 5-minute walk to Ocean Park, which is great!

msg:After a long wait, I finally checked into the Hard Rock Hotel Shenzhen! I love music myself, and the Hard Rock Hotel Shenzhen is simply a paradise for music lovers. There are many celebrity collections inside, such as Elvis, Lady Gaga, Cher... It's like a music museum. The music played in the hotel is also very nice, very rock. I stayed in a deluxe king-size bed room. The room has a large space, a good view, and an extra-large round bathtub. There is a shopping mall opposite the hotel, where you can go shopping, eat, and have afternoon tea during the day, and you can also have barbecue snacks at night. The location is very good and it is very suitable for short trips. There is also an ecological commune nearby, where you can go shopping and play the amusement facilities after dinner. In addition, there is a new marathon track at the entrance of the hotel. You can run outdoors in the morning to sweat and breathe fresh air. It's very good. I will definitely come back next time if I have the chance! Thanks to MARK for his advice and recommendation.

As a result, the rooms we have reserved are no longer available
But the front desk manager was very enthusiastic and solved our problems quickly
Upgraded us to the presidential suite and provided breakfast
When we checked out, the manager Mark Pan gave two more small gifts to the children.
 The hotel's facilities, hygienic environment and location are very good. The breakfast buffet is very hygienic and delicious.
The most important thing is that the front desk staff are very polite, enthusiastic and patient.
A very good experience￼I will definitely come again next time

msg:Shenzhen Hard Rock Hotel has such a theme style, which really shocked me deeply this time. When I came to the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, there was a flying golden dragon made of cymbals on the drum set on the ceiling. It was very vivid and dynamic, which well integrated the theme of the hotel with music, so that the guests who just came to the hotel first had a full Hard Rock baptism, which was impressive. Going up to the check-in lobby on the fifth floor of the hotel, what caught my eye was the whole wall of FENDAR guitars behind the front desk. It is estimated that there are only such guitars in the world, which shows how profound the heritage of Hard Rock is. GRO-Mark here enthusiastically gave me a lot of guides for the surrounding areas, so that I could have a lot of fun without spending too much time. Thank you Mark for your enthusiastic and professional service! The front desk staff also demonstrated a high degree of professionalism and provided thoughtful service for my pleasant and quick check-in. Entering the room was another big surprise for me. I stayed in a deluxe king-size bed room. The bed was so big, the bathroom was so big, and what made me even happier was that the bathtub in the room was really huge, and three or four people could take a bath together! Great! There is also a rooftop swimming pool on the 26th floor, a huge gym and children's playground on the 6th floor, a CAFE on the first floor, and a resident band. There is a restaurant on the 2nd floor where you can eat Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese food, and a buffet restaurant on the 5th floor. Breakfast is also served in the buffet restaurant, with a rich variety of varieties, which is my favorite flavor. There is also a ROCK SHOP on the 1st floor, which is good news for HARD ROCK fans around the world. Opposite the hotel is the huge Mission Hills MALL, and next to the hotel is the Sports Commune, which has an ice and snow world. There is also an oceanarium at the entrance of the commune. As soon as you come out of the hotel, you will see the golf driving range. As soon as you come out of the hotel, you will see the most beautiful greenway in Shenzhen. People from all over Shenzhen come to check in. I heard that there is a Guanlan Prin**aking Village nearby, and I must go and see it next time. In short, this trip to the Hard Rock Hotel Shenzhen was really good.

As soon as I entered the hotel lobby, I could immediately feel the strong rock style, which was very COOL. I immediately fell in love with this place. I thought that I would be lost when I came here for the first time. Fortunately, I met MARK, who enthusiastically introduced and recommended interesting travel guides around me. Thank you so much! There is also the lobby here, and the background wall is full of guitars, which really surprised me! Entering the room, I saw the big bathtub inside, which made me like it even more. I also went to the gym on the 6th floor, which was very convenient. There is a swimming pool on the 26th floor, which feels great! It is wonderful to see the Mission Hills Golf Course from a high place. The hotel has a variety of breakfasts, buffet dinners and BBQ, which are all my favorites. I also went to the nearby Ice and Snow World, Guanlan Oceanarium, there is a 4.9-kilometer-long greenway, Guanlan Prin**aking Village, Landscape and Rural Cultural Village, and there is a large MALL opposite the hotel, which is all-encompassing. I completely fell in love with this place.

MARK at the front desk gave me a lot of good suggestions, so that I didn't waste too much time when I was playing around. There were also many very enthusiastic staff members of the hotel who provided me with valuable help. I sincerely thank them. This rock-style hotel really fascinated me. The room is so big, the bathtub inside is so big, the breakfast on the 5th floor is very rich and delicious, I went to the gym on the 6th floor, the equipment inside is from the Italian brand "Technogym", which is great! There is also a dedicated children's playground. There is also a bar on the first floor with a resident band. The hotel is located at Exit D of the "Mission Hills" subway station, which is very convenient. There are large MALL "Mission Hills New Town" around it, ecological sports commune, ski resort, golf driving range, Shenzhen's most beautiful lakeside greenway, Guanlan Prin**aking Village, Guanlan Ancient Ruins, which made my stay in Shenzhen Hard Rock really worthwhile.

The room hygiene is OK, the view is beautiful, the floor is very high, all electrical facilities in the room can only be activated by inserting the room card and turning on the door switch, the bed is clean and comfortable. The natural scenery outside the window is dominant, and there is no light pollution. As soon as you sleep, the sky starts to light up and you wake up naturally.

If you have children, the hotel provides children's teeth and slippers. If you don't have them in the room, you can ask the hotel to get them.

When checking out, the waiter gave the children a small handbag, which made them very happy.

Overall, satisfied 😊

msg:I was very satisfied with the experience of spending 3 days and 2 nights at the Hard Rock Hotel Mission Hills Shenzhen from the third to the fifth day of the ***** New Year. I will definitely stay there again next time. Although it is only a basic room, the room is very spacious, clean and bright. The location is very convenient, just above the Mission Hills subway station. I can see the Mission Hills New Town mh mall across from my room. In addition to many restaurants to choose from, there are also hair salons, supermarkets, cinemas, video games, doll clippings, indoor high trucks, and large slides and wave pools suitable for children to discharge their energy.

I would also like to give special praise to the hotel for its considerate service. Since we couldn't check in until after 3 o'clock, the staff arranged for us to go to the lounge restaurant on the 21st floor where we could eat and drink for free. There are many choices of salty, sweet and drink options, so rich and delicious. Drinks include different juices, red and white wine, coffee (self-service coffee machine), tea, and cookies.

It only takes about 8 minutes to walk from the hotel to Mission Hills Sports Commune, which has various motorized games (per meter), indoor Karoo Ski Resort, outdoor high-speed trucks, children's playground, light food restaurants, etc.

When you arrive at the front desk, the female staff "Beller" is smiling and very nice to receive you for check-in. You can get to the room quickly. The room is very spacious and very comfortable. The bar room only provides basic supplies and not much (it's environmentally friendly🤔). The facilities in the room are convenient and do not require conversion plugs, which is the best. The restaurant staff are also attentive. There are quite a lot of choices in terms of breakfast food. The hotel's rooftop swimming pool is relatively small and there are also children. The amusement facilities only have small motorized equipment and the space is small. If you go on weekend vacation, you will choose to stay again😃

msg:There is a large shopping mall opposite the hotel, with many restaurants and shops, and a large supermarket, but there seems to be no convenience store nearby.
As for transportation, we did not take the subway during the entire trip, but the hotel is at the exit of Guanlan Station. It is very convenient to walk a few steps. We took a taxi from Area C of Yifantiandi to the hotel for 29 yuan.

There is only one room on each floor of this room type. We booked two rooms. We lived on the 19th and 20th floors respectively, with an empty view.

The room is beautiful, clean and unique. In terms of hardware, there is an entrance hall where you can put your shoes and bags as soon as you enter, and then there is a large wardrobe. There is a hot water kettle and capsule coffee machine above the desk, and there is a small refrigerator, cups, tea bags, etc. below.
There are SONY speakers and LG TVs. I didn't watch TV, but the speakers were good when playing songs.
Bathroom: The bathtub is very large and deep, enough for two people. However, the water flow is a bit slow and I had to wait for a long time to take a bath. The washbasin and mirror are all giant-level. There is also a makeup mirror and an ordinary negative ion hairdryer, which is very powerful, but The wire is a coil type, which is a bit cumbersome and cannot be stretched very long.
Shower room: There is an overhead shower, but I felt that the water power was not enough, so I still used the shower head. The bath products should be the hotel's own, not famous brands, so I just used them myself.
A toilet is just an ordinary toilet, a beautiful hotel, it would be great if there was a smart toilet
In the entire bathroom, it would be better if there was a clothes rack to dry towels, and only the toilet has a trash can, so the equipment could be more considerate.

The hotel staff are also very responsible. CheckIn is on the 5th floor, especially Mark who recommended nearby attractions for us. Cathy was also very patient in explaining the lounge benefits and other facilities and services to us.
The environment of the lounge is also very musical, with a pool table, game consoles, etc., but the food is inferior. The four of us were not very satisfied with the food. We hope it will be improved next time we come.

msg:In summary, the service is generally very good. As soon as we entered and exited the hotel, the waiter helped us check in and received my email message to upgrade my room for free. This is really important to mention. It was very personalized because I knew it was a holiday, but because I I came back to this hotel for a special reason, so they upgraded me for free, so I want to thank them first. However, I have forgotten the name of the waiter who helped me upgrade my room. First of all, I'm sorry. The only thing that is not ideal this time is that after the free upgrade to the room, I found some feces on the wall in the bathroom. As long as it feels very dirty, a five-star hotel cannot accept such a situation because the human body recognizes that music is a contamination of bacteria. If the source is not handled properly, there is a chance that the scapula will be infected. I went there with the children. If the children did not know that this was feces, the consequences would be disastrous. Because an international non-upgraded hotel cannot allow this to happen, because they must have inspectors to check the temperature of each room, but I cannot see this, so the hotel must step up training. I immediately informed the lobby manager, whose name is Mark. After hearing my opinion, he quickly handled the incident and apologized. His attitude was very good, and he immediately sent some fruit and red wine to express our gratitude on behalf of the agreement. I did not ask him to do so. We can commend them for taking the initiative to give it to us. Also, free late check-out is available, so the lobby manager quickly solves the problem and comforts the guests, so the lobby manager does a really good job. So this trip has both good things and shortcomings. I hope the hotel will pay attention to it￼

There is still a wall full of them. There are probably more than 200 of them. Electric guitar, so shocking! The hotel room is also cool, the quilt has a dark guitar pattern, and there is even a cocktail shaker in the room, which is not found in other hotels. I have to say about the bathtub in the hotel room. The bathtub in the room I stayed in was really big. The large round bathtub should be the biggest in the hotel I have ever stayed in! The breakfast here tastes really good, I love it! There is also a CAFE on the first floor of the hotel, which offers pure American flavor and a live band. There is a subway station in front of the hotel, which is so convenient. After the subway station, you will reach the huge Mission Hills New Town. SHOPPING is so convenient. Walking to Exit A of the subway station is the Sports Commune. There is a huge ice and snow world inside, which is super fun! Thank you MARK for giving a lot of suggestions and super enthusiastic service, thank you! Will definitely come again next time! Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Thumbs up!

The swimming pool on the top floor is relatively small, and there were many people there when I arrived, so I didn't particularly want to get in the water. The fitness room equipment is okay, but if you want to pay attention to it, it lacks hand and abdominal equipment. The equipment for chest and shoulder training is very good, and the muscles feel very good when using it.

All in all, the experience of this trip was generally good. This hotel is a good choice as a base for sightseeing in Mission Hills.

The whole person relaxed and felt comfortable away from the hustle and bustle! The room was clean and tidy. When checking out, Mark, the lobby manager, also greeted us warmly and shared the hotel's star exhibits. I learned a lot of stories about stars. It was great!

After opening the door, we found the hotel's thoughtful room layout, which was very surprising because it was my birthday. We arrived the day after and didn't expect the hotel to be prepared. The room is designed in a modern style. It is very simple and clean. It is very comfortable to stay. There is a place in the entrance for two people to sit and change shoes at the same time. I personally think it is a very considerate design. Another highlight is the toilet and bathroom. In addition to the large bathtub🛀, the design is also very modern. The toilet is at the end. I personally think it is a good arrangement. The color is mainly black, which I like very much. When I returned to the hotel room after walking around, I found another surprise. The hotel manager Mark had specially prepared a birthday cake and fruits for me. Super surprised and happy 🥳, I would like to express my special thanks to the manager Mark for his considerate arrangements and other discounts. Without a doubt I will stay again. ￼

Thank you to the front desk for arranging a high floor. I am very satisfied with the room. It is a pity that the weather was not good during my stay, it was foggy and rainy.
Children's slippers and toothbrushes can be provided in the room on request, but there is no shower gel for children, and the shower gel and cologne they provide is too strong in fragrance to be used on children. The only hope is that this can be added. The front desk staff is not familiar with room supplies.
The staff at the concierge desk on the ground floor are very kind. Thank you for providing us with directions and taking the initiative to interact with the children. Thank you very much ~
The hotel has a place where children can play, which is very good. It rained heavily during check-in, so I spent some time there~

When we checked in, the staff told me that because I stayed for two consecutive days, I could not arrange a late check-out. If I stayed for one day, it would be OK. This answer seemed a bit strange to me. In addition, the housekeeping staff may have been too busy the next day, so they only put down a pair of slippers and a used towel on the floor and left. We returned to the room at dusk and called the front desk to immediately arrange for a waiter to come over and continue cleaning up the room. However, these two things did not affect our itinerary, but we have never encountered them in other hotels. Free access to the executive lounge was another surprise for us. In addition to all-you-can-drink drinks, there is a small buffet after 4 p.m. with many varieties and is worth a try.

msg:The location of Shenzhen Mission Hills Hard Rock Hotel is very convenient. It is adjacent to Exit D of Mission Hills Subway Station of Shenzhen Metro Line 4. Across the road is the Mission Hills MH New City large shopping mall. The rooms are large, clean and tidy, and there is a large bathtub. Fully equipped with free WiFi. The view from my room is Mission Hills MH New City Mall. There are many restaurants in the mall, as well as a large supermarket, a cinema, a large indoor slide and wave pool, an indoor high truck, and an indoor children's playground suitable for children to discharge their energy. This time we specially chose to stay for three days and two nights from the third day to the fifth day of the ***** New Year. Due to the large number of guests, we were unable to check-in until 5 pm, so the staff of the hotel arranged for us to go to the restaurant on the 21st floor for free. You can eat and drink as you like. The food is rich, the choices are many and delicious, and there are also different juice drinks. After eating, it was around 7pm, and then we went to check-in on the 5th floor. Overall, I was satisfied with this trip. The hotel staff were kind and I look forward to visiting again next time.

When you get off the subway, you can go through the shopping mall opposite without having to cross the street. I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm this time, but the room was not ready because there were too many people checking in. Finally, the front desk clerk upgraded the room on the left to mine. The room was big and clean, the bed was comfortable, and the air-conditioning temperature and air volume could be adjusted. , the staff are polite, the breakfast food has a wide variety and tastes good, but the seats are relatively crowded. Overall, I was very satisfied with this trip and my family was happy.

msg:I arrived at check-in at 3 o'clock that day. The staff said that during the New Year holiday, the room had not been cleaned yet, so I had to wait for a phone call, and finally waited until about 6:30. Because my classmate planned to go shopping nearby, the problem didn’t have much impact. When we finally picked up the room, the staff helped us arrange a late check-out.
After taking the room, I found that the cleanliness of the room was not satisfactory. The glass countertop at the water bar in the room was dusty, and there was water in the bathroom sink. I wiped it all with disinfectant paper towels before I felt at ease. Fortunately, the sheets and quilts were very clean.
In addition, there are strange things about the room facilities:
1) There is a coffee machine but there are no coffee capsules in the room, not even tea bags. I had to call the front desk to get it to me.
2) The bathroom sliding door cannot be fully closed. This time I went with my family and it didn’t matter, but if I went with my friends it would be awkward.
3) The bedside electric switch only has a panel and is not connected to the power supply.
This time I checked in during the New Year period and expected it to be worse than usual, so I paid more to book a suite. Unfortunately, the quality of the room was a bit disappointing. I would like to add that the service attitude of the staff is very good.

msg:After the reservation was successful, I called specifically to communicate that I would bring a cat over to confirm the room type and whether the basic cat supplies were available? When the result arrived, I was told that the cat fee was +380 yuan. The reason was that I had booked the wrong room type. I was very depressed. I called earlier just to avoid this kind of problem from happening. As a result, when we arrived, we had to change the room reservation and check-in. There was no guest, and the girl wearing glasses at the front desk had to do it for almost 50 minutes, unable to answer any questions. Is this really worthy of this star hotel? It was almost twelve o'clock before we got to the room. I saw that the so-called pet care facility is just a plate. A pad for notebooks. With a basin without a changing pad or cat litter. I really doubt what the person I called for consultation was for? There are pictures of everything online. . Shouldn't I tell you if these are not included? So what’s the point of rebooking a pet room? The cats are angry

It is mainly for the convenience of going to Karu Ice and Snow World. The exclusive access for gold VIP members mentioned in the Ctrip order is basically It didn't exist. I asked the waiter that there was no such channel, so I queued up with everyone to check in at 14:45. Fortunately, there were 4 counters handling it at the same time. It took about 15 minutes to queue. While waiting, someone kept playing guitar and singing. It felt okay. There was a discount for buying breakfast when checking in at the front desk. We asked for a late check-out, and the front desk readily agreed.
I was assigned to a room on the 15th floor. When I entered, I found that it was a deluxe king bed room. I was given the wrong room! The room size is okay, the bathtub is round and quite big! After calling the customer service, I originally planned to wait for him to send back the correct room card while eating and drinking at the Rock and Roll Lounge on the 21st floor. However, this ordinary room card cannot be used to go to the 21st floor by pressing the elevator, so I had to go back to the room and wait for the waiter to come and give me the card. .
15:15 We finally arrived at the recording studio king suite. The room was very big, twice as big as the one we were given by mistake. It also had a large living room, a guest toilet and a small bar with a small sink; other people who saw it commented that there were knots in the room. He has a vinyl record player, but there is none; because there is only one double-sided trash can (recyclable and other) in the whole room, and there is no one near the wash basin, it is a bit inconvenient to use; the water drain in the shower room is a bit blocked, and less than half of the water is washed Soak your feet!
At 15:30, I went to the Rock and Roll Lounge on the 21st floor. There were only coffee, soft drinks and other drinks, as well as a small amount of cookies, 3 or 4 snacks, red plums, and 3 or 4 snacks. At 15:45, happy hour was provided in advance from 16:00 to 19:30. Hot food, including fried rice, duck legs, soup, snacks, etc.
In the evening, we had Chinese food at the Chuyunxuan Southeast Asian restaurant on the second floor. The appetizer suggested by the waiter, the yam paste, was delicious. Other dishes such as rice with lobster soup and fish maw stew were also delicious. Before the dishes were served, we were given Indonesian shrimp. Cake, and later a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.
Breakfast is served at Sessions on the fifth floor. There are delicious Chinese and Western hot and cold soup noodles. It’s worth coming back.

When we checked in, we were told that the double bed room we booked was not available, and they were told that a room on another floor would be given to us as a "free upgrade".
I was full of joy and thought about what the room would be like after the "free upgrade". Who knew that after arriving in the room, the first thing that would deduct points for me was the dust on the railings by the window (originally I just wanted to see the view outside the room, so I opened the door) The curtains were only discovered), and they were still black.
As for the breakfast buffet, there are many types of food and they taste good.
The waitresses at the reception desk are very professional, and they are always patient enough to explain to me, who has limited language skills. When I checked out at the end, I was given a doll ^^
The hotel is conveniently located at Exit D of Mission Hills Station. Opposite the hotel is the WH shopping mall, which is very convenient for shopping, dining, and watching movies.

It is recommended to bring disinfectant alcohol and spray it. The breakfast is convenient and mainly has more Western food, but less Chinese snacks. We recommend pancakes and waffles, and yoghurt. The holiday restaurant is full for breakfast, so it is recommended to arrive before 9 o'clock to enjoy it. However, by Monday morning, the crowds were much less crowded, and there were more types of food to choose from. You can order the omelets to order, and the pancake waffles help you add toppings to each dish. There are more snacks than on weekends.

The check-in time was relatively late, and due to the National Day holiday, the originally booked room was no longer available. My family was very happy to be upgraded to a suite.
The manager tried his best to arrange the necessary supplies and sent birthday cakes to the children. Thank you very much.
The hotel has rich breakfast, complete with Chinese and Western styles

msg:The location is very convenient, it takes 5-10 minutes to walk to the Ecological Animal Commune. There is a subway just downstairs, and you can reach Mission Hills New City through the exit opposite the subway. Parent-child activities are concentrated and convenient. The hotel service is very good, the staff have nice smiles and are very proactive and attentive. Mark, the hotel manager, knew that we had children and was even more considerate. He used a robot to deliver plush dolls to the room as surprises for the children. He also helped to book buffet dinners and promote discounts. The service quality and attitude were both excellent and impressive. 👍 🏻👍🏻

The only drawback is that the quality of the buffet dinner is very average. There are not many or few choices, but the taste is very bland. It is recommended to go to Xincheng to find a restaurant for dinner, which has many choices and delicious food.

The scent of the hotel is good, and the overall hygiene of the room is okay. There are just a few hairs in the bathroom and underground corners. The towels have drapes and don't feel very fresh.

Overall, I would choose to stay again because the location is close to the subway and the staff's service is good. If the hygiene and food quality can be improved, I believe the overall experience will be better.

They upgraded me to a panoramic room for free and provided me with three meals a day. Unfortunately, I was in a coma the whole time and the only time I got up was to take a bath. I got a lot of mooncakes as gifts, and they were all too exquisite to carry. Overall, they were worth the price.

After checking in, the hotel was full the previous day and the room was not cleaned. The lobby staff arranged for us to go to the lounge on the 21st floor on the left to wait for the room to be cleaned up. The lounge has free food and drinks, and the food is constantly supplied and there is an endless supply. . Although I booked the Left Rock Premium Twin Room and included afternoon tea in the lounge, I saw that all guests who failed to check in can enjoy it. This arrangement is very good👍
I can check in the room. I found that the sliding door of the bathroom near the bed cannot be closed. After communicating with the staff, I upgraded to a yellow duck-themed parent-child room on the left. The children are very happy😍
This time, I would like to thank the two staff members for their assistance and arrangements. They are Ace and Steven, who made the children's stay happy.

The decoration materials of the hotel 🏨 are very good. Compared with other 5-star hotels in ************** 🏨, it is really at an international level.
The machines in the gym are all new and well-equipped, and there is also a magic mirror🪞 (link🔗 to enter the applet, and you can conduct simple fitness and dancing teaching classes. This is the first time I have seen it, it is very interesting😁)
There is only an outdoor swimming pool in the swimming pool, which is relatively small
The room type booked includes executive benefits, which includes 3 periods of food and beverages, and you can go in all 3 periods, but only 1730-2000 has food, and the other two periods only have cookies, coffee, and tea.
I contacted the hotel in advance, it turns out that there is a cake for birthday, the taste is very good 👍🏻😌

The plug can use three pins in Hong Kong, and there are five or six sockets in a room. Check-in, the fly in the oin**ent is that it is too detailed. Another point that needs to be improved is the speed of boarding the room. The reservation will be late, so go to check in at 4:00pm. It is estimated that the room will be checked in at about 5:00, and there are no other problems. ⋯⋯Finally, I would like to say a few more words, they have an afternoon tea D wild delicious food 👍🏻👍🏻

The rooms are basically satisfactory. There are water stains on the washbasin and the ground is a bit dirty. The hotel should emphasize that it will be better.
There is a big shopping mall opposite the hotel, with a lot of good food and sufficient air-conditioning.
When I walked in, there was a nice staff member (the older uncle on the left) who gave me two lollipops. His enthusiasm made my two-day and one-night stay perfect😊

Cathy Wang at the front desk and other staff are very polite and worthy of praise.
There are free marshmallows in the lobby, children are the happiest.

The bathroom door is translucent, and you can see the vat and toilet. Friends/parents should pay attention to it. Although the bathroom is large, the bathtub appears to be very small (the round bathtub that my friend lives in is the big one).

There is no chance to eat the afternoon tea provided, because there is nothing to eat between 5:30-8:00, and we will go up after check-in at 3:00, and there is really only afternoon "tea".

There is no diversion or time limit for breakfast, there are still many people around 10:00, there is no place in the restaurant, and it becomes inconvenient to go to the other side of the reception to eat.

The biggest downfall is the swimming pool! very small! And people must wear swimming caps, and it costs $58/cap, which is very expensive! Because I didn’t bring a phone with the children, the staff said that I must pay first, and check-out is not enough, so I have to go up and down again just to put on a swimming cap!

The location is convenient, near the subway station, across the road is MHmall, the two-day activities/meals are over there.

The room is generally OK, it is very spacious, well-equipped, the bed towels are clean, and the shower water is not enough, so it takes a long time to shower and shampoo.
The breakfast buffet in the morning is okay, but there is no time to enter the venue to enjoy breakfast, which makes it inappropriate to wait in line to enter the venue.

My favorite is the big bathtub with a view, but unfortunately it was raining on the day I checked in, so I couldn't watch the sunset in the bathtub hahahahaha

The hotel will call in advance to understand the needs of the guests before check-in, which is great! Thank you Jessica Dong at the front desk, the service attitude is very good!

Although it is far away from the urban area, there is a subway station at the door, so the traffic is quite convenient!

msg:This time I went to Hard Rock because of my husband’s birthday, so I specially booked two premium rock double bed rooms and one premium twin bed room. The other room was for my 12-year-old son and grandma. I didn’t expect the space of the two rooms to be larger than the one on the website. The reference pictures provided are quite different. The space to enter the room is smaller than expected. The design of the room is very difficult to use, because the washroom next to the bed is made of glass with white *****es. No matter you are taking a shower or soaking in the bath, you will clearly see the user The activity situation, if the two couples have problems, it is okay, but it is very inconvenient because there is no privacy when the grandma and son stay in the other room and use the bathroom. And it may be that the entrance of the hotel is very dark due to the special decoration of the hotel, and I couldn't find the light switch when I was looking for it. At first, my husband thought it was a sensor light, so he unlatched the door to turn on the light!
This time, because of my husband's birthday, I left a message to the hotel in advance, and they gave me a cake, but when I found other comments, it turned out that the hotel would have a simple layout, but my room didn't have one. I was really happy.
When I checked out the next day, I also reported the hotel problem to the hotel Steven

But there were no shower caps and other common items in the room. A bit slow, but overall inconvenient. The hotel is full of collected works of art, and the design style is quite unique.

It can be seen that the hotel still attaches great importance to the overall experience of guests. If you stay again, you will choose Hard Rock.

Staying in the executive suite this time, you can go to the Lounge on the 21st floor to enjoy afternoon tea and drinks. Other than that, the other supporting facilities are very average. First of all, there are not many choices for breakfast, and the food quality is also average. As for the room, the bed is comfortable, and the curtains are adequate for shading. However, the equipment in the room is not perfect. Fortunately, there is a USB plug. The rest of the bathtub and shower facilities are old and not well maintained. On the whole, it is not up to the level of a five-star hotel, at most it is a four-star hotel

msg:I went for the two words of characteristics. Children's facilities are not friendly, there are a few dilapidated toys for free to play, and the rest are game consoles or special experience courses that require additional payment (fees for special experience courses are understandable, such a big hotel is still like a fourth- and fifth-tier city. It is incomprehensible that the game consoles placed at the door of the pharmacy Shiduo charge the same). The most important thing is that the sanitation is relatively poor. There is a sewer in the shower room, and the bedside socket is full of dust. The bedside socket is still loose, and there are hidden dangers in electricity consumption. Also, after staying for one night, the feet are covered with red spots, which is obviously due to the unhygienic bedding with mites or other organisms. This experience at this price, yes, there are warning signs all over the room, I feel like I have entered a model room... There will be no next time. (Good points: pool, tub, gym are great!)

Before check-in, there will be special hotel staff to ask you about your preferences, some requirements in the room, the situation of the occupants, etc. This is also convenient for them to help us prepare the needs of the room in advance.

In addition, the children's area is not very big

msg:I'm honestly disappointed. As a global chain, maybe I went with too much hope. As a result, the experience is that the price does not match the check-in experience.
1. The black disposable slippers in the room shed hair. I just wore them, and the white sheets were covered with black hair when I went to bed.
2. The water in the washbasin does not go down. I remove makeup and wash my face in the washbasin, and the water overflows.
3. The water in the bathroom couldn't go down either. After washing for a while, the water was already soaking my feet. I was so scared that I hurried through the water and didn't dare to wash my head.
4. The wire of the hair dryer is too short. If you want to blow your hair in the mirror, you can only blow on the left side, not the right side.
5. There is no air-conditioning. The air-conditioning is turned on with heating. I communicated with the front desk when I checked out in the morning. It turned out that the air-conditioning was turned off after winter, and there was only heating. I was so hot that I rolled all night without falling asleep. I was sweating on the back of my head when I lay on the pillow. The quilt was so thick that it was too cold to cover the stomach and back, and it was hot and sweaty when covered.
Summary: Living for more than 700 yuan is aggrieved. I don't know if this is the only room I live in. I don't bother to change rooms after only staying for one night. I hope the hotel will pay attention to it.

And the cleanliness in the guest room is not perfect, there are a few stains in the bathroom...
However, the theme of the hotel is quite unique, and many places have rock characteristics. Compared with other business hotels, it is quite fresh.

After arriving at the hotel at 2:20 pm, I went to the first floor and found that the check-in was on the fifth floor. The front desk told me to Wait, tell me to upgrade my room type on the basis of the original, just need to wait, okay, I took two children to the outdoor swimming pool on the 26th floor, the swimming pool is not big, but it is enough to play, there are bubbles at 5 o'clock Show, the kids had a great time!

msg:I often visit hard rock cafe abroad, and it is my first time trying hard rock hotel in China. During the National Day holiday, I planned to bring pets to the hotel to play. At first, I called to ask about the conditions of the cat's reservation. The first female receptionist insisted that the cat must have a rabies vaccine to stay. The second time, my friend called and asked another male receptionist, Leo Ji, and said that the triple cat vaccine would do. The room we booked is a dedicated pet housing, and the price is a bit more expensive than other room types. We also informed in advance that the pet is a cat. Later, we checked in smoothly but did not read any vaccines. The service attitude of Leo at the front desk is very good. But it is a pity that on the day we checked in, the cat supplies were not ready, and the service staff in the back also missed items in the supplementary pet supplies. There was no cat litter and no toiletries. I don't know if I didn't make arrangements because I was too busy during the National Day. That's fine. The thing that makes me the most dissatisfied is that the cleaning of the hotel room is not in place. There are some broken shells, food scraps, children's toys, gun bullets, hair, and the carpet under the bed is not vacuumed. , anyway, I couldn't wipe all the corners and corners by me, and I used up most of the pack of wet wipes that I brought. The corners are also in a state similar to furniture peeling and moldy. It is really not suitable for pets to live in, and it is easy to cause accidental ingestion. My cat vomited on the night of the check-in without knowing what it was eating by mistake. Then there is a glass door in the bedroom and bathroom area that can't be closed, so I can't stop my cat from running into the bathroom, and the large inspection hole under the washbasin has not been properly handled, and the cat will climb inside, which is very dirty. . Let's talk about the overall room design. Anyway, I haven't been able to find the ventilation switch in the bathroom. The overall control is a bit confusing. The water volume in the shower is very weak, and there is no handle on the sliding door, which makes it easy to pinch hands. The hotel's buffet breakfast is really average. The meal time is very short, 06:30-10:30, and there is a queue to wait. If there are many people on the National Day, the time should be extended. Anyway, I have stayed in cheap homestays to hotels several times more expensive than this hotel. I am only commenting on the service that corresponds to the brand and price. I am very disappointed with Hard Rock. But the grandfather on the first floor has a very good attitude towards the family and has been very friendly. He reported it to the front desk. The front desk said that he would clean it for me. I smiled and said that I have finished cleaning and my cat has vomited. Now give me free check-in and I won't. .

msg:During the epidemic, I couldn’t go out to Shenzhen for several years. During the holidays, I basically stayed in various hotels in various districts of Shenzhen, and took my children and the whole family to eat, drink, and stroll on vacation. This time I chose the Hard Rock Hotel in Guanlan, and I didn't expect the service and joy to exceed expectations. As soon as they entered the hotel, the children were lined up for the balloon delivery team from Uncle Clown. I have to say that after meeting so many uncle clowns, this one is the best at making balloons on the spot! My son got a sword and an amazingly cool Bull Demon Balloon Hat, and couldn't be happier.
After checking in, I saw the hotel's National Day parent-child activity arrangement. I rushed upstairs and changed clothes to participate in the bubble pool activity on the top floor. The children were not happy. Immediately went downstairs and participated in an explanation of the reserved music collection. Following the hotel professionals, we talked from the first floor to the fifth floor, and learned about the origin, development and the origin of various collections of the Hard Rock Hotel in the United States. ! The room for National Day also gave a coupon of 100 yuan. After 8 p.m., our family went to the cafe on the first floor and ordered authentic American burgers, cakes and drinks, and enjoyed the live performance of the foreign band team. The a**osphere was full of American billiards. Tables, football tables, video game consoles, spectators of all nationalities, various collections on the walls, we felt like we were in America at one point. So far, we have a panoramic view of the musical heritage of the Hard Rock Hotel.
At night, I have time to see the huge bathtub in the room and the invincible scenery outside the window. I especially like the room layout of the Hard Rock Hotel, and I am extremely satisfied with personal privacy needs. Part of their bathroom is equivalent to the bedroom, which fully meets the space for yoga exercise. Give, then a shower and a huge soaking tub of your choice.
The next day I got up and had a breakfast buffet. There were a lot of people. It's National Day. The quality is good. The most humane thing is that my child has no appetite when he wakes up in the morning. He just goes to the swimming pool on the top floor to play. The hotel also asked us to give the child some food to go back. I am afraid that the child will be hungry after playing with water! Like👍🏻
Finally, when we checked out, we went to the lobby on the 5th floor, and the staff said that we could leave as soon as the staff took our room card. We are very satisfied. This is the greatest trust to the guests. Although we have always been civilized and self-disciplined people, it is really amazing that the hotel can do this!

There are also picks on the first floor 🐉 Background guitars at the front desk on the fifth floor 🎸 Collections in the showcases...
You can also rent a guitar when you stay in the room~ a great experience! The room's subwoofer bluetooth speaker ~ I just want to bring it home! Anyway, unspeakable love! I just want to live forever hahaha
Every staff member I met was very nice! The little brother Tom at the front desk greeted me warmly from the time I got out of the elevator🙋🏻‍♀️ and then quickly helped me check in! He also helped to choose a high-quality guitar 🎸 Of course, the room he arranged is also very beautiful! I couldn't be happier to live here 😁 Tom's brother is awesome! The arrangement from booking to check-in was perfect! 😘Brother Xie Wei helped us deliver the guitar and patiently taught us how to use it, great! When I checked out, the little brother of vocal issued an invoice. It can be seen that the newcomer is not very skilled, but the attitude is very good! It is worthy of recognition~ Of course, the enthusiastic Brother Pan should also praise it at the end! Mark Pan greets us warmly every time he sees him, and really treats us as family and friends! Also gave a small gift 🎁 Thank you very much for the warm-hearted brother Pan! If there is a chance, I will definitely go back to live again!

The bathtub in the room is very big, but the ceiling light at the entrance is broken... I can't turn it off in the middle of the night, and it keeps flashing... The master came to the door with a good attitude and turned off the power first, so that the guests could sleep first.
The golf experience package booked, the location of the driving range is not very tight, but don't expect the club, the old 7 club with peeling paint can be played.
The breakfast is average and the time is friendly, until 10:30.

The very caring front desk prepared the dog kennel, hair protection, vegetarian basin, urine pads, etc. in the room in advance. Manager Mark is also responsible and thoughtful as always, and responds to messages almost 24 hours a day. The first time I stayed at Hard Rock three years ago was when I booked a room with Mark. At that time, when his foot was injured, he took the initiative to help deliver food to the door of the house. In the past three years, he has often notified HardR of various activities, professional and caring. Thumbs up for pet friendly and Mark

The music restaurant downstairs is still the same as the Diwang store 20 years ago. The foreign singers sang hard, but the audience was small and relatively deserted, and it closed at 11 o'clock, which was earlier. The breakfast is relatively ordinary, the buffet is not experienced, and the meals are served at the chopsticks next to it and Yi Xiaoli on the opposite side. On the contrary, the restaurants that are not available in these two urban areas are the most impressive on this trip.

msg:My husband likes guitar and chose the Hard Rock Hotel for his birthday. The check-in is very convenient, but the restaurant ordering is a bit annoying. After placing the order, it prompts you to make an appoin**ent. I went to the restaurant and said the name of the set menu, but the operator of the restaurant didn't know, so I had to say the cake and red wine... Uh, my husband was right next to me, so there were no surprises. But the hotel is still very good, the details are very good, from the parking lot to the elevator to the front desk to the room, there are many elements of rock and guitar 🎸, the staff are also very nice, the electric guitar rented is also very good, the hotel is opposite to Guanlan Huxincheng mall has everything to eat, drink and play. Overall, I am very satisfied. The beauty at the front desk, Angela Chang, has very good service. She receives check-in and check-out. She is also very patient and praised ❤

It is very convenient to travel. There are rock elements everywhere in the hotel, and the front desk can also rent guitars for free🎸. Maybe because of the epidemic, the variety of food and beverages is not very rich, but the taste is still good. During the stay, I encountered a small episode, Bella helped to solve it in time, and I was very satisfied with it. I will come later. In Guanlan, the Hard Rock Hotel must be the first choice. Highly recommend to all golf lovers!

The executive panoramic king-size bed room has a bathtub yyds, the living room is very large, and a yoga mat is provided for free. After exercising, take a bath and enjoy the sunset outside the window. It is very pleasant. What's even more surprising is that the first ray of sunshine in the next morning, the whole room is golden.

There are many types of buffet breakfast, freshly squeezed juices and cheese slices are very good ~ attentive and enthusiastic service, it is a parent-child friendly hotel, next time I will bring children to stay.

When there was a problem in the middle, Ctrip and the hotel communicated in a timely manner to provide solutions. In the end, they were very satisfied and praised Ctrip customer service Coco and Hard Rock Hotel Xiaoluo by name.

The last suggestion is that the petals and decorations on the bed are very attentive. It would be better if the flower petals were used. If not, it would be better not to put the petals 🧸

First of all, the meticulous greetings and cares from staff Bella and Vivian, and secondly, the meals produced by the hotel made me feel good. The location of the hotel is also very convenient. There is a shopping mall in the distance of a road, and the subway entrance is downstairs. This is a very young hotel, the decoration style is mainly rock and roll style, with a lot of musical elements. This time I stayed in an upgraded panorama suite. The room has a wide field of vision, you can see the golf course and the Ferris wheel, and there is also an open floor-to-ceiling glass beside the bathtub. You can take a bath and enjoy the beautiful scenery at night. Made a good and deep impression!

msg:1. Environment: The geographical location is convenient and the transportation is convenient for shopping and playing. Going out of the gate is the subway station; across the road is MH mall; walking along the direction of the hotel is the golf driving range, ecological park, etc.
2. Catering: There are many people staying during the holiday, so breakfast needs to be eaten earlier, otherwise you will have to wait. The breakfast variety is quite rich, and the waiter in the restaurant is very proactive, no matter where he sits, he can take the initiative to collect the plate. If you see a customer in need, you can take the initiative to help immediately.
On the other floor, there is a special restaurant, which mainly serves burgers and pasta, which children like to eat. There is a band singing at 7pm, and the a**osphere is not bad.
3. Facilities: There is a swimming pool on the top floor, but there are too many people during the vacation and the swimming pool is not too big. We just went up to see that there was no swimming. Instead, I go to the neighborhood a lot every day.
The remarks for this reservation require a quiet room. The hotel reserved it in advance and it was thoughtful. There is also a big bathtub in the room. Although the children could not go swimming in the pool, they were very happy to play in the big bathtub.
The only thing is that the hotel elevator is a bit slow, and it takes a long time to wait for the elevator.
4. Service: The staff have a good service attitude and keep smiling. I hope the hotel will continue to maintain good service. There is a children’s club on the 6th floor of the hotel. You can book cookies at 2pm.

Thank you very much to beautiful lily, because she brought the children in her family to celebrate her birthday, lily especially helped arrange the high-floor rooms and delivered cakes, mineral water, and snacks! And free mini bar! Also did a late check-out check out, it is full of rights. It is a pity that the group does not have a frequent visitor plan, otherwise it will definitely support it.

If you bring a child to the hotel, mh mall is opposite! There are eating, drinking, and fun, and it belongs to the emerging trend shopping mall. There are brands such as evisu, h&m, etc., and there are restaurants such as Galeries Lafayette and Diandude, which are very good.

The cafe bar on the first floor of the hotel is very lively, with band performances at night.

The breakfast is very good and parking is free, but the parking lot directions are not clear, there are too many speed bumps, and my Ferrari is almost dragging its feet.

From the entrance lobby to the front desk, parent-child club, open-air swimming pool, and buffet breakfast restaurant, the staff are very friendly and well-trained. It is a satisfying parent-child trip! Special care for families with children, the requests made are all satisfied one by one and arranged properly, thank you Ctrip, thank you Hard Rock Hotel! We have not been out of the house for a long time because of the epidemic. We have been entangled in whether our two-year-old baby can sleep well and eat well. Do I have any other requirements? He can coordinate. The response speed of Ctrip and Hard Rock to customers is worthy of praise👍! Going again next time!

Instead, the responsibility is put on the issuer of the customer's card issuer and the bank. The follow-up is simply childish. However, the Ctrip platform came forward to solve the problem.
2. When I dine in the hotel restaurant, I was the only one who dine at one table, it was deserted and the taste was average. There is an additional 15% service charge.
3. Far from the city
The overall experience result is not suitable for business travel.

      快要到酒店，遠遠就能看酒店外牆上掛着一把巨大無比的大吉他，絕對是附近區域的一個地標，吸睛能量一流。
      酒店一樓大堂更是把搖滾做到了讓客人驚訝到了極致，你會看到大堂的天花頂上掛着一條超大的金龍，再仔細一看，原來是用架子鼓上的鑔片藝術化做成的，極有視覺沖擊力。上到5樓辦入住的大堂，哇！哇！哇！你又能看到幾百把的真吉他用來做成一面背景牆，不得不佩服HARD ROCK真的是下了血本來做這家酒店。這裏要謝謝MARK,非常熱情地為我介紹了酒店的設施設備和功能，還推薦了周邊的遊玩攻略，非常感謝！
      酒店的房間空間真的是大，感覺比其他的酒店都要大很多，房間裏還有一個超大的浴缸，我住的還是普通的標準房，都有這樣的配置，好贊！26樓有泳池，6樓有健身房，器材還是泰諾健的，超好！
       酒店裡有很多歐美明星用過的收藏品，這又是其他酒店所沒有的優勢，我在這裏看到了貓王的，LADDY GA GA的等許許多多的明星用過的服裝和樂器。
       酒店的早餐很棒！晚上的自助餐品種豐富，真心點贊！
       酒店對面就是一個大型的MALL，超多花樣，走300米到地鐵站A出口，就可以滑雪，打高爾夫球，酒店門口就有一條非常美的綠道，繞着水庫一週。
        來到深圳硬石真的是對了！謝謝MARK的推薦。

慕名硬石酒店已久， 身邊入住過的朋友都是好評， 今次入住， 還為我升級了樓層，還有酒店房間的溫馨佈置， 員工上下均非常有禮， 自助餐性價比也很高，座位舒適，食物豐富，尤其是糕點甜品，房間佈置得宜， 設計溫馨得來也夠 rock！房内乾淨舒適， 還有圓形浴缸，借了兩隻紅酒杯及開瓶器， 我和太太就在浴缸一邊浸浴一邊享受紅酒， 房間景觀開揚，面對哥爾夫球場， 是遠離煩囂，逃避現實的好地方😂
非常感謝硬石酒店的五星級服務，下次會聯同一班好朋友一齊入住， 繼續hard rock！😁

            在深圳來説，這家酒店真的好有性價比，有度假休閑的五星級酒店的味道，前台員工服務熱情禮貌，Mark經理也很友善。節假日大堂有免費的雪糕可以吃真的好好，小朋友入住還會有小朋友的洗漱用品，真的好人性化，另外酒店可以免費租借吉他和唱片機，適合打卡拍照放鬆心情，而且房間的浴缸還超級的大，是我見過的星級酒店裡能在普通豪華房享用到的最最最大的浴缸了，3，4個小朋友一在裏面游泳都可以！
             酒店的自助早餐也很有特色，晚上的自助晚餐很豐富，品類琳琅滿目，還有烤全羊。
              一樓有CAFÉ，看到了有現場表演的外籍樂隊，氛圍好到了極點。我還去了26樓的天台泳池，還有6樓的健身房，小朋友可以到6樓的小童樂園做烘焙課。
              酒店到冰雪世界非常的近，走幾步路就到了，酒店對面就的觀瀾湖MALL，吃喝玩樂都不用愁。酒店門口還有一條超長的4.9KM的“牛湖水綠道”，景觀非常的美。
               還要感謝MARK先生熱情周到的推薦附近的遊玩訊息。
             這家深圳硬石酒店真的好好，推薦推薦！

msg:此次硬石酒店之行，給我留下了非常美好的回憶！一間氛圍獨特，能帶給人輕鬆愉快感的搖滾風格酒店，應該是目前國內獨一無二的。酒店的大堂首先就讓人非常的驚喜，用了幾百把真實的電吉他🎸 掛起來做背景牆，在每個你能遇到的角落都有很多明星用過的收藏品，酒店房間非常的寬敞明亮，開放式的設計，讓洗手間和整個房間融合在一起，過渡得很自然，印象最深的是房間的圓型大浴缸，超大！26樓是天台泳池，非常的適合家庭親子。5樓的自助餐廳用早餐，中西式結合，大酒店出品的質量真心是好。晚上的自助晚餐更是海鮮、燒烤樣樣齊全！1樓還有cafe，有駐唱樂隊，氛圍讓人迷醉。酒店對面就是大型的購物中心，地鐵站就在酒店門口，交通非常便利。原來還有一條深圳最美的綠道就在酒店的門口，繞着水庫的一週，看到好多人來打卡！走幾步就到了運動公社，裏面有冰雪世界，真是太方便家客人了。總結此次入住深圳硬石酒店，非常的舒適，工作人員熱情有禮，感謝Mark的專業服務，始終面帶微笑地接待我們，快捷有效地為我們解決問題。深圳Hard Rock硬石之行，真的是不枉此行！

msg:復活節假期的高峰期去入住硬石酒店，預期人流比平日多，等候check -in 時間會比較長，但係當我們踏入Hard Rock Hotel 大堂一刻，已經有接待員禮貌地指示我們上5/F 辦理入住手續。
上到5/F已經即時見到大堂接待經理Mark熱情招待我們，給小朋友送上糖果，又急不及待介紹酒店附近綠道等設施……

房間特別獲得升級至豪華套房，空間感大增，小朋友倍感興奮！
整體而言，入住感覺十分舒適滿意，位置方便，步行至姑娘胡公社或娛雪埸設施亦10分方便，對面新城MH Hall 更加便利。
已經推薦給朋友和下次再來都必定再次入住！

msg:被網上的評價吸引了，世紀體驗感不怎麼樣。酒店位於工業園附近，靠郊區，地鐵也不是很發達，除了周邊，去哪裡都很遠。運動公社綠道也就那樣，機動遊戲都比較老舊。對面的商超也就是普通的商超。酒店內部的小童俱樂部玩具很少，也比較破舊，還要自己買幣玩。樓頂是假草皮，一個小泳池，比起其他度假酒店這個酒店空間很小，孩子在裏面很無聊，不知道為什麼評論説的是親子友好酒店。整體裝修也有點舊了，房間衞生很一般不能細看，雙床房門口就對着床，晚上空調很吵，燈的開關鍵也很不方便。自助餐味道一般，有些食材看着就很不新鮮，廉價的食材多，1399一晚性價比太低了，頂多值五六百。這麼不明白網上那些好評哪裡來了，住這裏逛個商場走個綠道？？？這個我在家也能做，不推薦帶娃來。

2這個旅途中我最喜歡的就是硬石酒店了，非常的友善樂於助人，MARK總能及時瞭解並及時跟進我的需求。房間也是非常的乾淨舒適，對於我這種認床、難以入睡得人就不得不 有多舒服了!給我帶來了非常愉悦的入住體驗!!!

酒店房間很大，如洗手間的玻璃不透光會更好。
另酒店房的地氈清潔度尚待改善。

其次，酒店的設施非常出色。我的客房寬敞明亮，裝飾豪華而現代化。床鋪非常舒適，能享受到一個良好的睡眠。而且，令我驚喜的是，酒店提供免費租借結他的服務！作為一個音樂愛好者，我非常享受在房間裡彈奏結他的時光。這讓我的住宿體驗更加獨特和愉快。酒店的地理位置也非常方便。

總之，深圳硬石酒店提供了一個難以忘懷的五星體驗。我強烈推薦這家酒店給所有來深圳的旅客。感謝酒店團隊的熱情款待，我期待再次光臨！

酒店上下員工服務都好令人難忘，遇見的都很有禮貌，如果帶著小朋友黎住，係十分適合。

房間賣點就是大，我們被安排入住尾房，浴缺是意想不到的大，是我住過的酒店有最大浴缸的一間，真是一家四口一起浸浴都足夠。我們的兩位小朋友可以一邊泡泡浴一邊游水。
早餐雖然多人，但食物選擇多及好味。
酒店對面就是大商場，有得玩有得食，行路去運動公社玩滑雪都好近。
值得再次入住。

衞生：衞生環境也不錯
環境：環境很好，很乾凈，但是房間裏的推拉門下面有的地方起翹了孩子光腳很危險會割傷，可以要求酒店換房間的。
服務：特別貼心的提供床圍欄簡直大愛。睡得特別安心又舒服。
周邊有商場和小型海洋館

房間設施應有盡有，首先面積超大，有一個偏廳，洗手間都有兩個。 主廁面積又係超大。床墊舒適，不過枕頭對我相對太軟。始終各人喜好唔同。 房間隔音好。 夠寧靜。
而自助早餐款式超多，面包種類都十款以上。完全值得嘗試。

到離開那天因為到附近商場拍照趕不及check out，到打電話回酒店他們很貼心的就馬上幫我們免費延遲退房！萬分感激！讓我們的行程更好安排🥺

不過親子房間的洗手間門是透明的，上廁所洗澡看得一清二楚，很不自在，因為孩子也大了😅只能盡量迴避！
酒店游泳池好小，因為沒有帶泳帽我們不能下水玩，要買泳帽，58人民幣一個，但泳池太小，沒有興致買泳帽去游泳。。

msg:酒店無論交通,玩樂都通非常方便,一出地鐵就到酒店,經過地鐵就到商場！另外酒店經理非常好,我們三家人預訂房型未能安排同一層,而他們見有小朋友,所以立刻想辦法幫我們upgrade更好的房間,當中值得一贊是Mark Pan,臨走前還送了公仔給小朋友紀念！另一位要贊的是礼宾主管 Simon康,他介紹我們按摩店,但距離酒店有些距離,所以無論去及回程都幫我們叫車,確保客人安全,所以下次來我也會住這間酒店😊

msg:第二次入住硬石酒店了，之前和家人入住過一次，那是星期日，在櫃枱等候入住期間，有免費的飲品和棉花糖送給客人，我們覺得很驚喜，原來只在星期六日入住才有，而平日都會有免費酸梅湯和水任飲。工作人員很友善，自助早餐很豐富，房間很大，地方很清潔，洗手間亦很大，惟獨洗手間的門有點透明，退房時，櫃枱服務員細心問我入住感受如何，我如實講了一切都好，就是洗手間門透明有點尷尬，服務員立即說可為我們加浴簾的，入住期間有甚麼問題都可以即時提出，酒店會盡量配合。
今次和朋友再次入住，立即提出要加浴簾，那就好多了，我和朋友帶同兩個小孩前往，不想分兩房住，就要求加床。房間實在大，加床後一點不會感到窄迫，還有很大空間給孩子玩耍。浴缸實在大，小朋友本來想去酒店頂樓游水，但在浴缸玩了很久，都不去泳池游水了。
硬石酒店在觀瀾湖地鐵D出口，步行一兩分鐘就到。A出口就是生態運動公社和海洋世界，B出口是騎馬，跳彈床，海底撈，按摩等等，C出口是觀瀾新城商場，吃喝玩樂様様齊。本來我想入住觀瀾湖度假酒店，但那裏出入都要搭酒店免費車好麻煩，硬石酒店地點實在方便，所以兩次入住都不作他選了。
順便一提，觀瀾新城商場早上十時才開門，建議大家訂房時預訂自助早餐，否則早上不易找東西吃，而酒店的自助早餐實在很豐富，值得一試。

首先，我要讚揚酒店的服務團隊。從我進入酒店大堂的那一刻起，員工們就以微笑和熱情的態度迎接我，並迅速處理了我的入住手續。他們對我的需求非常細心周到，總是願意提供幫助和解答問題。無論是在前臺還是客房服務，他們始終以專業和友好的態度為我提供服務，讓我感到賓至如歸。

酒店的職員都很熱情友善，前台的Cece小姐替我們辦理入住時還主動留下聯絡方式，有什麼需要和問題都會及時給予回應。
酒店的設施也很讚，泳池、健身室、兒童遊樂場都有，而且空間也挺大。
然後自助早餐的選擇也很多，飲品也由咖啡牛奶到果汁都有。
最後退房的時候前台Cathy小姐也很迅速替我們完成了手續。
總體而言真的是一家很有水準的酒店。

貴酒店唯一的問題是餐飲及現場樂隊，當晚食自助晚餐食物質素較差，凍食的海鮮不夠新鮮，熟食食物不夠熱，現場樂隊攪不到氣氛，而且唱歌太細聲，結他手沒有彈奏也有結他音樂聲響。

房間很大，櫃子很多。我進房間了以後，把櫃子挨個打開檢查了一下。繼而，發現床頭有一個門。起先以為是個放行李的儲藏間，抱着試一試的心裏，我擰了一下把手，沒想到一擰就開了！！！裏面還有一扇門，我開始有點不好的預感，這不會是對面房間的門吧？… 又一擰，竟然開了，黑洞洞的房間……天哪 我的心臟都要跳出來😱😱😱 立馬給前台打電話… 前台解釋説是打掃衞生的阿姨忘了鎖門…給換了個房間。然而新換的房間更大，櫃子更多，而且房間的燈開起來特別複雜。我和娃好不容易把櫃子檢查了一遍，又檢查了一下有沒有攝像頭之類。但是房間的燈怎麼也打不開啦😭😭😭 我倆一路瑟瑟發抖地跑到前台，要求換到一個小房間。新換到的房間仍然是和隔壁連着的。床頭的門還是可以打開……之前因為害怕，忘了拍照就跑了。這次，我讓前台自己試了試，確實是可以打開的……前台也很無措，似乎以前沒有發生過這種情況… 這時候已經凌晨2點了，娃明天還要考試… 不得已，我衹能讓前台找人來把門鎖了，再自己用小牀頭櫃擋着。然後讓娃先睡，我自己一晚沒閤眼，一直撐到天亮…

最後酒店提議轉了豬豬俠套房，套房內的小朋友設施更多，房間更設有bar枱。真是一個難忘的體驗，謝謝酒店的安排。

前提:酒店有機器人，可以送外賣到房間
事件:公務出差 早上時間本來就緊張，點了外賣 要機器人送上來。客服中心説機器人返場維修了，在我的拜託下，客服説讓人幫忙送上來，後面突然給我打電話問我外賣是食物嗎？我回答是食物，客服人員竟然説，我們這裏食物是不送上門的，下次請説清楚好嗎！！！
欺騙一: 對話結束後我下樓取外賣 酒店的機器人就在樓下，並沒有壞
欺騙二:我後面又點了好幾次食物的外賣都是機器人送上來的，根本就沒有不能送食物這個説法。
教育顧客:讓我説清楚，我怎麼知道酒店方的規章制度！！！
承諾，我這裏所有的話，均為真實原話，酒店可以提取電話錄音，以及酒店的視頻錄像。下圖是我當時拍的機器人和後面點的外賣

1、其他的瑕疵、問題都可以寬容，但是硬石酒店服務人員對中國人和外國人區別對待，一副**的嘴臉，這是底線，不可容忍。
2、事情如下：硬石酒店頂樓游泳池，我們自帶了游泳圈，請服務員幫助打氣，服務員非常不耐煩的扔過來一個手動打氣筒，讓我們自己打。我們問服務員，有沒有電動的，服務員回答沒有。…重點來了，這時候來了幾個外國人，也拿着游泳圈要求打氣，服務員不但拿出了“剛才對我們號稱沒有的電動充氣筒”，還屁顛屁顛的主動幫外國“友人”打氣，對待我們和外國人完全是兩副嘴臉。
3、真是難以想象，時至今日，還有中國人膝蓋如此彎曲，**********如此入木三分！…我真的很不明白，*外國人能讓你們得到什麼？能給你一百塊？

這次入住剛巧國慶 人很多 4時多才check in也還沒有房間，接待 一位年長的女職員分配了一個關愛房間 說是跟我訂的一樣只是浴室多了扶手 說如果不要不知要等多久 看了房間不喜歡可以下去換 結果當然要換 完全不是我訂的房間 拿著行李走來走去 找了另一位較年青的女職員 這位禮貌跟笑容 比之前那位好很多 說不好意思 要我們等 幫我們upgrade房間。可以到lounge等，多得她 原本的職員確實令我很生氣，但這位職員的笑容和做法 我接受了。因此入住過程很挺滿意，到了晚上 胃很痛 終於找到外面藥房卻關門  回接待處嘗試問了職員會不會有胃藥 職員反問我怎麼我會有胃藥 這個態度令我感到不舒服

酒店服務好，地點優越，地鐵口出來就是，特別適合一站式遊玩。不用打車玩2-3日沒問題。酒店周圍就是商場、運動公社、海洋世界，高爾夫球場，2日1夜都不夠玩，衝著酒店的服務還會再去。
從來沒有寫過評價，第一次寫了這麼多字，相信這樣的服務背後是公司的精細化管理和為客户解決問題的決心，非常推薦這間酒店。

酒店公共區域以及房內的冷氣都不夠，尤其是我住的房很熱，怎麼調他的溫度都不會降下來，估計壞了？走出門口，在走廊反而更涼爽。

天台泳池很小，其實就是簡單游泳，沒什麼值得期待的。

我入住當天，可能是暑假最後一個週末，所以很多人入住，工作人手不足，1500可以check in，但一開始只有2人在櫃檯，後來增加到4人，登記速度才快了一點。但我也等了半個鐘才能拿到房卡。旁邊也有很多其他員工，協助維護秩序，帶小朋友去吃小糖果，雪糕這樣。

不過，拿卡之後其實沒有房，很多人的房間並沒有及時清潔好。在行政酒廊等到4點多，看人潮陸續拿到房卡，陸續散去。我也去追問，我的房間清潔好沒有，但上去一看，發現才剛開始清潔而已。一整層樓，只有2人負責清潔工作。又等1小時，5點一刻左右才拿到房間。希望清潔員工能夠加多一對，一層樓最起碼有4人工作吧。

服務態度還是不錯的，就是人不夠 效率不高。

房內乾淨整潔，各種應有的用品設施都配備好。但估計小冰箱也是壞了，打開的時候根本沒有在運作。

早餐是自助餐，正常發揮，沒有特別驚喜。

總體還是不錯的。如果去觀瀾湖，會考慮再次入住。

廁所浴室沒有門鎖是一個問題；晚上回來太晚，打算洗澡，居然沒有熱水；打開抽屜找吹風機，其中一個抽屜居然有一些衣服之類的東西卷成一團的塞在裡面，而吹風機在另一個抽屜也是沒有收好，硬塞在裡面，感覺是客人太多，保潔人員只擦了個表面。

房間有一股霉味，天花板、冷氣口好幾個地方也長霉了，建議酒店要處理一下。前台服務人員態度很好，也是這酒店亮點之一。

早餐超級豐富，好味，每日有些不同，每次都捧著肚子走。
位置方便，經過地鐵站，便可到達MH mall，是一所親子商場，孩子們不捨得走。
但房間內雪櫃不是一般雪櫃，只是一個會發冷的鐵板，不要妄想把雪糕凍飲放入雪櫃，會全部溶化。
Check out時有職員迫旅客讚好，迫要俾5星好評，及要提及職員名字點讚，雖然事後會有毛公仔送給小孩，但此舉卻令人感到評語造假。

3.到圓形大￼浴缸，個放水制壞嘅成個甩出嚟，儲唔到水。個￼缸邊爆咗吱咗美￼逢膠都未乾，￼黐到我女成身都係。全部花灑都係好似無定向咁四射，設備唔保養只會走下坡
4.房燈唔人性化，廁所仲光過廳，
5.房內雪櫃仔，唔係好凍都唔緊要，唔好將啲嘢變熱。
最後，地點除咗就腳之外，覺得唔值呢個價錢，其他平一半既酒店都無咁差。

我和父母一起旅行，為他們訂了這個房間，適逢母親生日，告訴前台，前￼台送了一個蛋糕。
透過Trip.com訂的時候列明可延遲退房到下午兩點，見有人評論說不可以，於是提前問前台，前台說￼週末人流比較多，不可以延遲到兩點，經商討才可幫我延到下午一點。
￼值得留意的是，我訂trip.com的時候付了房間錢，原來這個是訂金，去到酒店的時候酒店告訴我這個訂金他們酒店沒有收，要我即時付房𠍿加按金$500 ，trip.com那個訂金要在我入住後四至七天才可退給我。我訂的另一個房間就是直接付酒店的，所以不需到前台再交房價加訂金。
