msg:This hotel is a gem in Shaxi Town and should not be missed. We are happy to have had the opportunity to stay for 1 night, and only wished we had more days in Shaxi. The hotel is in a beautifully restored ancestral home, with rooms that are modern and beautifully appointed with a lot of thoughtful amenities provided. Breakfast and afternoon tea were delicious. The hotel staff from the ladies at the front desk to housekeeping were really friendly and helpful. They gave us recommendations on what to see and where to eat in Shaxi. We appreciated the extra touches such as having warm milk brought to our rooms as a nightcap. Special thanks to Yan Yan who took care of us on our last day and was also our teacher in the Jia Ma wood printing experience. We had a great time during the experience and left Shaxi with a special souvenir.

msg:We really enjoyed our first stay in Shaxi on my anniversary visit to Yunnan Province.  Thanks to the fantastic service provided by Miss Yang and her incredible staff, we really enjoyed our two day stay.  Originally we were only planning to stay one night but after a long trip to the nearby grottos, asked to extend one night which Miss Yang was kind enough to accommodate.  This guest house/hotel is brand new and has many modern amenities including a hot water pot, refrigerator, free snacks and drinks and more.  Everything was brand new and well taken care of and the staff was extremely helpful navigating us from parking to the hotel.  The location is also very central to much of what Shaxi has to offer.  The breakfast noodles were a real treat!  We will stay here again next year.

Next to it was the hotel cafe. By the way, I ordered two cups of coffee, and the hotel coffee coupons were equivalent to 50% off. After visiting the ancient city in the afternoon, the hotel provided an afternoon tea. After a short rest, we went out for dinner and came back. The hotel provided Tremella soup + milk, as well as various toiletries for children. The things provided were considerate and thoughtful: sunscreen, bandages, sunglasses, power banks, eye masks, hanging ear coffee, snacks, fruits... Breakfast was a buffet breakfast with cross-bridge rice noodles, which was very exquisite. The hotel is a typical quadrangle with a beautiful environment. You can see the pictures for details. The hotel also has its own dedicated parking lot (cheap hotels make parking lots better) and it is convenient to drive by car. I will come again next time. Thank you again for giving our family a pleasant trip.

msg:Cotegón was the most surprising part of this May Day trip. I originally chose a boutique homestay to ensure that I could feel close to the locals and have a more comfortable environment. The overall experience was beyond my expectations. It is not like many popular homestays that are good-looking but not practical. The details greatly enhance the user experience. For example, there is a Dyson humidifier in the room (very useful for dry Yunnan), a TV (it is very convenient to watch things with Huawei membership, and the angle is very suitable for lying on the bed), a luggage pick-up service (it is great not to drag the luggage on the cobblestone road!), a built-in LED makeup mirror in the room (girls who have put on makeup in the hotel know how important this is), a very comfortable mattress + pillow, and floor heating throughout the house (I didn’t expect it to be a little cold in May, and the constant temperature is so comfortable!) I won’t say much about the spare parts and borrowed items that everyone mentioned. In short, it is detail-oriented and practical everywhere. Compared with the hotel we stayed in in the second half of the trip, which was more beautiful than comfortable, it was great! All the waiters were enthusiastic and considerate, and I liked it very much!

msg:A trip that can be taken on a whim, a perfect hotel stay, worthy of my careful evaluation. Because of Shaxi Ancient Town, because of Liu Yifei, because of going to a place with wind, I have longed for a long time, and I only need an opportunity to set off.
I hurriedly chose to stay in the Cogondi Cultural Inn, which was newly opened in October 23, in Shaxi Ancient Town, and is convenient for travel. The two-story courtyard, Chinese courtyard, antique, thoughtful and distinctive design, quiet and comfortable. We stayed in the Wulai on the first floor, where we can bask in the sun, read books, watch fish swim in the yard... Daze... The hotel is very new, and the supporting facilities inside are very high-tech. The room has floor heating, the humidifier and hair dryer are Dyson, Evian mineral water, snacks, fruit, cola and coconut juice at the bar... There are fruits, afternoon tea, and bedtime desserts at night. The breakfast is very rich, the hotel coffee is super delicious, the latte art is so beautiful that I can't bear to drink it, and the tea room on the second floor is also very good. The hotel provides experience coupons for drinking tea and coffee. It was my sister's birthday when I traveled, and the hotel prepared beautiful cakes and greeting cards, which was so thoughtful! I experienced the Jiama culture. The hotel's sister service was great and responsive! This trip was originally a fluster, but after arriving, it was warm and calm. It felt like home, and it's worth writing such a long and sincere review. I'm a lazy person and don't like reviews! Because I met a lot of lovely people, lovely Pingping, lovely cameraman Chongqing Big Brother, lovely Grandma Arui, lovely puffs and cotton, coal balls... Shaxi is worth my return.

The equipment in the room is very new and complete, and a little yellow duck washing and care set is prepared for the baby, which is very considerate. The location is also very convenient. It is in the ancient town and is close to various places.
What I remember most is their butler service. Due to my acute gastroenteritis, the hotel arranged for someone to take me to the nearby health center for emergency injections and drips at 1 a.m., and accompanied me throughout the whole process. I am very grateful to meet such a warm you in a foreign land. I will come here again in the future, strongly recommended.

The room facilities are complete, high quality, clean and hygienic, and the details are very well done. They even provide Mentholatum lip balm and travel supplies😀
I originally booked only one night and planned to stay in a B&B, but I didn’t want to leave after staying there, so I stayed for another three nights. The store also upgraded the room type and gave me a discount to continue staying when the room supply was tight during the New Year. It was full of sincerity.
The daily breakfast and free afternoon tea are very exquisite, beautiful, and delicious. There are also free drinks, tea, snacks, and fruits in the room. There is hot milk or Tremella soup in the evening. It feels like eating all day😂
On the night of New Year’s Eve, all guests staying in the hotel were arranged to have a New Year’s Eve dinner, which is very considerate. Before leaving the store, they also taught how to make armor as a gift.
The waiters are super polite and responsive. The pick-up service is also very considerate. This is the best B&B I have stayed in so far. I will definitely stay here next time I go to Shaxi!
The day before I left, I suddenly saw a heart-shaped cloud floating above the store, so I quickly took a picture of it. It was fate, I guess! 😊

However, I was very satisfied with the experience of staying here. Both the bedding and toiletries were very good. They also carefully turned on the floor heating at night. The sanitary ware used was from Hansgrohe. In short, this is a boutique hotel that pays great attention to details. Next time, I will make a special trip to stay for a few more days to appreciate the hotel and visit Shaxi Ancient Town.

Facilities: First of all, let’s talk about the hotel facilities and environment. Just like in the picture, all the hardware facilities in the hotel are the best at present. Dyson hair dryers, Dyson humidifiers, and floor heating in the room. For people like me who are afraid of cold, It's amazing. It's warm even when you walk barefoot in the room. Toiletries are complete, Bulgari brand. We also thoughtfully prepared lipstick, eyeliner, disposable face towels, etc. What warms my heart the most is that a beautiful little bag containing sunscreen spray, masks, paper towels, wet wipes, sunglasses and folding parasols is also prepared for guests to use. The details are simply the best of any hotel I've ever stayed at.

Service: Let’s talk about service. They helped us with our luggage and sent it to the car for us. We also had free afternoon tea and the cakes were delicious. Coffee and tea are provided free of charge during your stay. After a few o'clock, there will be carefully prepared Jiama souvenirs, which the children love so much.

Environment: Finally, the location of the hotel is also very good. It is located in the ancient town of Shaxi. There are beautiful and quiet streets of the ancient town right outside. It is very comfortable to browse the small shops next to it. It takes a minute or two to walk to the ancient stage. There is Yujin Bridge in front of us. The lady at the front desk will recommend delicious restaurants to us. After we went there, it was really delicious!
In short, this store and the beautiful and quiet Shaxi Ancient Town are places that I still want to visit.

酒店雖然在試營業期間，但是設施、環境、位置、服務都很好，特別誇一下附近接送行李的小哥哥，眼裡有活，手裡不停，看見他的時候就一直在忙，很負責任。
一樓的咖啡館很贊，小姐姐的手沖yyds，推薦黃玉和大肚腩，好喝炸了。
伴手禮也很贊。
總之，因為沙溪，我愛這裏；因為這裏，我更愛沙溪。

設施：因為開業不久，所以一切都很新，一切都是很好的品牌，每一個細節都用盡心思，寶格麗洗護用品、戴森的電器、華為智慧電視、依雲水、冰箱裏麪配備了可樂、椰子水、巴黎水…硬裝軟裝都是很好的品質，以及民族特色的銅雕裝飾，這一切都為這一次的入住體驗做好優秀的保障。


衞生：很乾凈整潔，我們完全沒有遇到這方面的煩惱，安心得像自己家一樣。


環境：中間的庭院景觀是讓我們選擇這裏的原因之一，寧靜的院子隱約有些水的聲音，池子的錦鯉，一切都很美好。

服務：小哥哥小姐姐都是很友善的，服務也非常之專業，聽説他們有去市裡麪的五星級酒店培訓，希望他們以後越做越好。

衞生：新開不久 一切都很新 衞生做的很好

環境：傳統沙溪本地的院落 在古城主街

服務：前台小姑娘服務很好 百乎百應。由於沙溪夜晚很安靜 想出去買點東西都不容易。但是由於小朋友半夜發燒 前台跑出去給買了退熱貼。早上給高燒的小朋友送了兩杯鮮榨橙汁。

民宿附近巷子裏有個燒烤攤味道不錯 在沒有什麼選擇的古鎮是個不錯的選擇。

我們是到了沙溪臨時換的酒店，可能因為年紀大了，到了民宿之後覺得設施、衞生等都不太符合要求，正好看到了新開業的這家，在國慶假期價格也可以接受，就決定換過來…
幫忙拿行李，房間很乾凈，硬件高配，備品是菲拉格慕，衞浴設施是漢斯格雅，吹風機是戴森，也很貼心，準備了出門需要的竹編袋，裏面有可借用的防曬噴霧、防曬傘等，防曬傘很輕hhh，自己帶的傘被嫌棄了…
住了兩天吃的很滿足，從入住開始有糕點和水果，每天有水果和睡前甜湯，早飯除了自助還有米線，分別吃了小鍋米線和過橋米線，味道都很好，還有下午茶～
位置也很好，鬧中取靜，出來沒走幾步就是古戲台，去哪裡都很方便，窗的隔音做得很好，從入睡到醒來都非常安靜…
我們還體驗了甲馬，可以帶走兩份作為伴手禮～
