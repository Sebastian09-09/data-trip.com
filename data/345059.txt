It would take half an hour for those who know the way to walk there. It is a five-star hotel, and the price/performance ratio is still good in Shanghai.

So the most touching thing was that we didn't check out until 3 o'clock when we checked out. Brother Yang Yiping at the front desk said that since we were out for fun, he would give us late c/o for free. Thank you very much.

We would also like to thank guest manager Kathy Ma Yuanyuan for helping us find our luggage at two in the morning. It was very late, but she took the trouble. To be honest, the hotel's hardware has not reached a high level, after all, the price is here, but the service is the last word! !

The hotel should be proud to have excellent employees like you~~~I will stay here again next time I come to Shanghai! A very suitable hotel for Chinese babies (/ω＼)

The design of the guest rooms is equally exquisite, with every detail showing a high level of quality. The bed is comfortable and soft, allowing you to have a good night's sleep; the bathroom is clean and tidy, equipped with high-end toiletries; the facilities in the room are all available, giving people a feeling of being at home.
I was also impressed with the hotel's breakfast. The environment of the restaurant is comfortable and pleasant, and the variety of breakfast is rich and diverse. Whether it is Chinese, Western or local specialties, it can meet the needs of various tastes. The quality of the ingredients is also very high, fresh and delicious, which will greatly increase your appetite.
Finally, I would like to make a special mention of the hotel's service. From the moment I checked in, the hotel staff provided me with excellent care. They were warm, friendly, professional and efficient, and I couldn't be more satisfied whether they were checking me in, providing travel advice or solving problems. They truly put their guests first and made my stay a pleasant and comfortable one.
In short, the Sheraton Shanghai Binjiang Hotel is an excellent hotel, and it is an excellent choice whether you are traveling for business or leisure. I highly recommend everyone to come here and experience it. I believe you will fall in love with this hotel as much as I do.

The rooms also create a warm and elegant space a**osphere, which improves work convenience. , also ensures the social performance of the space, which caters to the life needs of business travelers and leisure guests.

msg:I didn't want to give a negative review, but I really couldn't help it. Because I'm so disappointed in it.
1. According to reviewers, the superior river view room has a panoramic view, and the bridge can also be seen. My superior river view room could only see half of the river, but I could see quite a lot when looking at the building.
2. The room number I wrote when I ordered takeout was placed in the takeout counter outside the hotel. I had to go out to get takeout at 12 o'clock in the winter (an experience I had never experienced when staying in a hotel).
3. There are too many people at breakfast, and the place is small, just like a vegetable market. . . . There are not many kinds of breakfast
When traveling in recent years, because many Sheraton hotels are non-cancellable, for fear of canceling the trip, I always choose other five-star hotels. I was scared to stay here once. . .

msg:Service: I booked a room from the 31st to the 1st. I went to the front desk to check in at around 1 a.m. on the 1st. At that time, someone was checking in in front of me. While we were waiting nearby, the front desk did not ask any questions or say hello. After a while, the manager on duty came over at the counter next to us. The woman at the front desk said that we could check in nearby. We walked to the side and were about to give our IDs. When the manager saw us walking over, she didn't say anything and turned around to leave. During this time, she looked at us in confusion. We stood there for half an hour before checking in. Good stay.
When the room manager called me, he didn't apologize but gave various explanations. It was like I was slandering him. I told him that the room was dirty but he didn't clean it. He said he was too busy, haha. How did he become the manager? I heard that the manager's surname was Zheng. I have complained to the senior management of their hotel and also called 12315 to complain. I have to say that the service in this store is really bad. The view room at 1800 was really funny. It was not as good as the all-season service. I didn’t see anything in the view room at 1800, just a bunch of houses. I will also report and complain about false propaganda. The service is extremely poor.

If the weather was not favorable, I could barely see the night view of the Huangpu River￼. The hotel is a bit far from the subway station and there are relatively few commercial plazas. You can choose to take a walk on the riverside trail in the evening to enjoy the scenery. The hotel facilities are relatively new and the services are in place. The room had not been cleaned when we arrived, so the lady at the front desk arranged for us to have afternoon tea in the lounge. Parking is more convenient. ￼

msg:The last time I came to Shanghai, I stayed at the Sheraton Shanghai Pudong Riverside Hotel. It was really a great experience! I can’t wait to share with you this place where you can have a bird’s eye view of the modern night view of Lujiazui;
	
The hotel is located in Pudong New District, Shanghai, facing the beautiful Huangpu River and overlooking the bustling Lujiazui and Yangpu Bridge. From the hotel, you can also stroll along the Binjiang Avenue along the Huangpu River;
	
As soon as you enter the lobby, you can feel the warm and elegant a**osphere created by the hotel. The entire lobby has been given the positioning of an "open shared space", which is suitable for business socializing and solitude. The hotel lobby is decorated with large-scale floor-to-ceiling phantom oil paintings, wrought iron lattice windows, and unique chandeliers, interpreting Shanghai's unique fusion of Chinese and Western style.
	
I stayed in a spacious and comfortable river view room with large floor-to-ceiling windows that gave me an unobstructed view of the beautiful scenery. The hotel's bedding was very soft and comfortable, giving me a good night's sleep. During the day, you can also sit on the sofa by the window and experience the different scenery;
	
It is worth mentioning that the hotel's breakfast is very rich, offering a variety of delicious dishes, including Chinese and Western cuisine. I especially like their executive lounge, where you can drink a cup of coffee, eat some desserts, read a book, and enjoy a moment of tranquility;
	
The hotel has a gym and swimming pool, allowing guests to stay healthy while on vacation. I also found that the hotel has many banquet halls, which can hold various events, large and small. In addition, the Shangrong Mansion on the second floor is also amazing. It specializes in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Huaiyang cuisine. It is very unique and is an ideal place for business banquets and private parties.
	
If you happen to come to Shanghai, you can choose to stay in this hotel and experience the charm of the magical city together!

msg:Ctrip almost never gives reviews, but this time I am serious about telling you the real experience of staying in this hotel. From the previous Wyndham to the current Sheraton, in the words of the person in other reviews, this hotel has nothing but the name Sheraton, it has nothing to do with Sheraton. I have stayed there at least fifty or sixty times because the company is just across the street and I often need to hold meetings. This hotel is more convenient for meetings at 8 o'clock in the morning. I don't know why, but I only stay in this hotel. After switching to the Sheraton, a five-star hotel cannot even match the hygiene of a three-star hotel. Just look at the carpets. Not to mention bare feet, I feel dirty even if I put shoes on them. The bathtub in the bathroom is also yellowed, and the faucets in the bathtub are dirty. The switch can't be switched, and the bathroom door is broken and can't be closed. What's even weirder is that there are no sockets in the bathroom. To dry your hair, you have to go to the corner of the bedside table to find a socket, and there is no response when plugging in several sockets. Furthermore, , maybe the hotel has too many negative reviews recently, and everything is old, so I heard the sound of nails banging at 8 or 9 o'clock the next morning. It must be that the hotel is repairing or replacing other things, oh, the bed The background of the header has been changed. It’s a cheap and ugly one. It’s not even as good as Hanting. Let’s talk about parking. You have to walk around in the underground garage and then take a freight elevator to get to the lobby on the first floor. What’s even more annoying is that there are One time, in the middle of the night, the security door couldn't be opened from the outside and I couldn't get in. There were so many things I wanted to complain about. What pissed me off the most was that the last time I checked into the hotel, it was around nine o'clock in the evening. My takeout arrived because the takeout cabinet couldn't be put in. The takeaway guy When he called me, I told him to leave it in the lobby and I would go get it as soon as I was ready. Since I had washed my hair and the shampoo had not been rinsed out yet, I planned to go get it after washing and blow-drying, but the delivery boy told me that the security guard They refused to let him in. Because it took a long time, he said that the security guard directly asked him to put the takeout on the ground at the entrance of the lobby. This really pissed me off. My guy who dried his hair went to the lobby on the first floor to report to their manager, and he came directly. I said this is the takeaway guy's problem and you can complain to him. I was shocked. Not to mention the service awareness throughout the whole process, I didn't even have a service attitude. I had a condescending face. Who the hell owes you? I didn’t want to recall the lobby manager during the whole process. It was really speechless. Oh, in the end, he just said to me, if you feel uncomfortable, you can complain, okay, can’t I help you? ***, who? It's a shame that I have such a good memory. I feel sad for the Sheraton that the hotel has a lobby manager like you. I also hope that during the hotel's training, they don't recruit all **** in. We customers are here to stay. Yeah, I’m not here to be offended!

The hotel swimming pool is next to the swimming pool on the sixth floor and is the gym. The water depth of the swimming pool is 1.4 meters and the water quality is clean. The gym is not crowded and there are not many people in the swimming pool. It can be said that it is a private venue.
There is also a rest area on the first floor of the hotel with ice cream, coffee and tea, where you can rest and read a book.

msg:For a weekend staycation, come to the newly upgraded Sheraton Shanghai Pudong Riverside Hotel. The hotel is adjacent to the Yangpu Bridge. If you stay in a river view room, you can enjoy a first-line view of the Huangpu River without leaving the room, with a wide field of vision. In the evening, it is very pleasant to walk along the Pudong riverside, ride a bicycle or take a walk. Especially when the bridge is lit up at 7pm, the lanterns are on, and the scenery is beautiful and beautiful.

The height of the lobby is more than ten meters by visual inspection. It looks very grand and modernly decorated. Adhering to the open shared space concept of the Marriott Group's Sheraton brand, it is suitable for business socializing and solitude. The reception staff at the front desk were professional and enthusiastic. They also successfully identified the membership when checking in. They were also upgraded to a corner room with a larger area and better view. It was great!

The hotel rooms are large in size and are very suitable for families. The large floor-to-ceiling windows make the room particularly bright and transparent. The room has elegant colors and a simple style, which is in line with the aesthetics of today's young people. The bedding is comfortable and provides a good night's sleep. I would also like to express my special thanks to the cleaning lady on this floor. Her service is very enthusiastic and responsive to all requests.

We particularly recommend the Shangrongfu Restaurant on the second floor of the hotel, which specializes in Huaiyang cuisine. The dishes are exquisite and the service is excellent. Huaiyang cuisine focuses on freshness, and the addition of fresh ingredients creates a wonderful chemical reaction. "Ejiao, Foie Gras and Pork Knuckle" is full of creativity. "Tianmu Lake Dried-roasted River Eel with Bamboo Shoots", the plump river eel is so satisfying. "Chrysanthemum Brain White Jade Lion Head", a typical Huaiyang dish, has a feeling of melting in your mouth.

There were quite a lot of foreign guests in the hotel. On the second day during breakfast time, we actually saw an Aeroflot crew coming to have breakfast. It was so unexpected. The 24-hour recreation center is equipped with a swimming pool and gym and has a very good environment. It’s great to take the kids to the swimming pool to play in the water!

The location of the hotel is very advantageous. It is right next to Pudong Avenue. Public transportation is convenient in the surrounding area. It is just one block away from Metro Line 14 and is 500 meters away on foot.

I stayed in a river view room. The large floor-to-ceiling windows gave me an unobstructed view of the beautiful scenery. During the day, you can sit on the sofa by the window and experience the different scenery. It is worth mentioning that the hotel's breakfast is very rich, offering a variety of delicious dishes, including Chinese and Western cuisine. It is a very good choice for business trips and travel.

msg:I chose to go to Shanghai with my friends during the summer vacation, because the places I wanted to go include the Bund Lujiazui area and Disneyland, so I chose a hotel that is convenient to go everywhere. I heard that this hotel should be refurbished soon, and it is still the Sheraton brand, so I chose here. Facts have proved that the choice is particularly good and travel is quite convenient. The entrance is Pudong Avenue, and there is subway line 14 within walking distance. It is very convenient to take a taxi to go anywhere, which saves a lot of trouble.

The color of the hotel room is French brown, which is the simple style I like. It is spacious, bright, clean and refreshing. We arrived at the store after 4 pm, and the lady at the front desk checked in very enthusiastically. The concierge brother also thoughtfully helped us send our luggage to the room. The service was excellent.

I read the reviews before coming here, and they all recommend the river view room. If you book the exclusive river view room, it will be a corner room. We have upgraded it. The room area is about 70 square meters. There are large floor-to-ceiling windows on both sides, facing the Huangpu River view, which is very far away. Look, you can still see the Oriental Pearl! The night view of the Yangpu Bridge next to the river is simply invincible.

The next day, I rushed out to play and went to have breakfast early. There were not many people at that time, it was very quiet, and there were a lot of breakfast options. The freshly squeezed juice requested by the service staff is delivered directly to the location. During the meal, the service staff also asked about their feelings, and it felt good to be watched.

While waiting for the bus in the lobby, I bought Dubury's ice cream. The lobby and coffee bar are open, and the layout is very good. The overall experience is good, and I can continue to live here next time I come to Shanghai.

msg:One of the worst experiences I've had so far, and I hope it will serve as a warning to others.

① There are five people staying, one of the problems in the room is that the shower is broken, and the problem in the other room is that the refrigerator and air conditioner are broken. After informing the front desk, I was ignored for several days, and no one asked me until I checked out.
Explain that if the front desk says to deal with the situation reported to the front desk later, it will not be dealt with directly.

② The five rooms hope to continue to live in the original room. Inform the front desk one day in advance, and the front desk made a record. When I went to the front desk the next day, no one knew about it. I needed to explain it again. The front desk spent a long time on the machine until I asked, and they said it was a system error, and there was no way to go through the procedures for staying. But it is no problem to continue staying, you can re-swipe the room card.
However, as soon as I went upstairs, someone from the front desk called to urge you to check out today. I went downstairs again to the front desk to inquire about the situation. Another front desk staff member said that he didn't know about the extension of the stay, so he called to urge check-out.
In the meantime, the front desk staff made no apology, just made a bad face while defending themselves, and even made people feel that I interrupted their work.
Explain that not only did the front desk not communicate with each other when shifts were handed over, even the staff who were at the front desk at the same time did not have any communication. And they have no reflection on the inconvenience caused to customers.

③ When you check in, you are asked if you need a toothbrush, etc., and tell you if you need it. Then I didn't prepare it in the room, so I went to the front desk to ask, and the official answer was directly: If there is no special explanation, toothbrushes are not provided.
Explain that they are not listening carefully to the request from the hotel, and they don't care about the needs of customers.

④ On the day of check-in, the shower gel and other toiletries in the room were placed directly on the table instead of hanging in the original place. The inside of the photo is how it was hung afterward. Obviously, the bathroom has not been cleaned seriously at all, and it has been kept in its original state after being used by the previous guest.
Explain that when the housekeeping depar**ent is cleaning, they will not check carefully, but just do it hastily. It raises concerns about whether there are various DNA samples from previous guests left elsewhere.

⑤ All 5 rooms reported that the water in the toilet was very small. Finally, the toilet in the toilet in my room was clogged. After I informed the front desk and learned from the previous experience, I specifically asked, should I go now? Then, someone came and cleared the blockage, but didn't do any cleaning, leaving me with a disgusting toilet, I had to open the door to keep ventilating, otherwise the pungent smell. See the photos below for details.
Explain that the hotel does not consider the feelings of the guests at all, but just executes the order mechanically.

⑥ Back to the hotel at 3:00 p.m., without cleaning. Asked at the front desk and was told that it hadn't been cleaned yet because there were too many rooms. However, 5 rooms, on different floors, were not cleaned.
It shows that the cleaning efficiency of the housekeeping depar**ent is too low, or there are not enough staff, causing quite a lot of guests to return to the hotel after a tiring day and see a dirty and messy room.

⑦ On the day of check-out, the hotel lobby suddenly began to replace the carpet, and all the rest areas were blocked. This is without any advance notice.
Explain that the hotel does not care about the inconvenience of the guests, and does not think this is something that should remind the guests and apologize.

⑧ The socket next to the washstand cannot use a hair dryer. After taking a shower, you have to go to the outlet next to the bed to use the hair dryer. Is the internal wiring damaged?
Explain that the facilities of the hotel have not been carefully managed all year round, and various problems have emerged one after another.

In the end, I only stayed 3 days and had so many problems. Explain that this is not an accidental phenomenon, but a serious problem with the management level of the entire hotel. With a room rate of nearly 1,000 RMB a night, is this kind of service provided?
Even if it is a hotel that costs 200 yuan a day, there will not be so many problems at the same time, it is a bit appalling.
When I checked in on the first day, there were other guests next to me who were angry at the front desk. Presumably, they have experienced similar things to me.

msg:The location and service of the hotel are very good, and the surrounding environment is also very good, but it may be because some parts of the hotel are currently being renovated, so there is still a little lack of hygiene, including the supporting facilities and equipment in the room, which do not meet the standards of a luxury hotel. I hope that next time Check in will have a better feeling. Overall, I am satisfied and worth recommending.

msg:Waited for half an hour to check in
The front desk looks like a combination of old and new
The newcomer is probably not very proficient in business and the processing speed is slow, but the service attitude is not faulty.
The old man next to him who seemed to be more skilled in business always had a smile on his face and a professional attitude towards the guests, but he turned around and treated the newcomers with an impatient attitude, which really gave people a bad impression.

The overall feeling of staying here is "Is this the Sheraton?"
It can only be said that domestic hotel brands have been catching up too fast in recent years, whether it is the professional level of service or the creation of this superb style, not to mention how the aging facilities like Sheraton can compete with other people's new equipment.

For customers who don't care about the price, you may never go wrong by staying at the Sheraton with your eyes closed. But for price-sensitive people like me, we would rather save a few hundred yuan and stay at Atour.

It wasn't until I took the initiative to call to ask after checking out that the front desk told me that my ID card was at the front desk. , never thought of sending it to my room. Secondly, the shower door in the room leaked, and the entire bathroom was flooded with water. After checking in in the early morning, I was woken up by the guest room aunt twice at 10 or 12 o'clock in the morning, and opened my door directly without my consent! During the entire stay, the room only provided 2 bottles of mineral water and nothing else. Is this package still from Sheraton? It just shocked me!

The dust in the room is very large. There is a thick layer of dust on the lamp and the head of the bed. It is no exaggeration to say that the dust is at least one centimeter thick. The carpet is very dirty. The dust flies all over the room. I stayed for one night and kept sneezing, and my throat and nose absorbed it. The ash is very uncomfortable. Although it is marked on the Ctrip website that this hotel is a five-diamond hotel, the sanitation is not as good as that of a three-diamond hotel. People in the room are like a vacuum cleaner. They leave after staying for one night, and dare not stay again...

Waiting to read the comments, I was shocked for a while, thinking it wouldn't be so bad, but there is no way to return it. To sum up, the hotel facilities are old, but not as scary as some of the reviews, but the air conditioner on the 30th floor is not there. Can you imagine that the lobby is too cold to be warm when it reaches the 30th floor? Called the desk and waited 45 minutes or so to see it, and was told it might be good to wait an hour, which is unbelievable for the Sheraton brand. I think no matter whether it is renovation or takeover, it should pass the test before facing customers, right? In short, the experience this time is very bad, only the night view outside can be seen

msg:This is an extremely horrible Sheraton, please avoid it. This was the "Xingrong Wyndham" many years ago. Later, the owner operated it with his own brand "Lijing International". I don't know what he was thinking, but he listed it as Sheraton again. According to regulations, reservations on Marriott's official website can only be accepted in September, but at the end of May, they began to solicit customers in the name of Sheraton. Marriott's senior club has no rights, but it doesn't matter if there are no rights. The hotel hygiene is worrying, and the service staff are not familiar with the business. The concierge and the front desk are all newly recruited young people, and they are all confused when asking questions. The lobby has been renovated, but the lobby bar and the like are not in operation yet. The room facilities are very old, the whole staircase corridor is seriously musty, and the hygiene is worrying, so you need to avoid it. It's not as good as the Home Inn next door.

But there are cobwebs in the bathroom and bathroom, the shower head can't adjust the angle and can only spray on my face, the carpet is full of prints, and the room is full of musty smell. Hey, it seems that the former five-star hardware is still okay, but I probably want to upgrade it. I hope the renovated Sheraton can be upgraded to a higher level!

msg:It’s my second stay and I can’t help but leave a comment. The room is very big. The key point is that the night view can see the three major artifacts of Lujiazui. The breakfast experience is a bit different this time. The Hong Kong-style dim sum tastes the same as Tao Taoju. The bed is also very comfortable to sleep on. The key is that the price/performance ratio is still very high. Jiangjing is invincible

You can see the river view and Yangpu Bridge. The bridge is very beautiful at night with lights. Breakfast It is more in line with my appetite, clean, hygienic and fresh. The waiter also kindly asked me about my dining experience, and it feels quite warm. The business trip time is too short, wait for the next time you live here and take a good look around.

The room has obviously not been used for a long time, and the water is dirty when the faucet is turned on. It is still yellow and dirty after a long time. Finally, brush your teeth with bottled water and wipe your face with a slightly damp towel. The water quality was better the next morning, but the hot water seemed to be gone, and the hot water was still very warm when turned on to the maximum.

msg:It has no advantages except being big. It’s too bad.
1. The equipment is old and the door handles and faucets are very old-fashioned and rigid.
2. There is no hand sanitizer in the room.
3. When taking a shower, the shower head can only be placed vertically, not at an angle, which is too awkward. The faucet was so old-fashioned that when I was halfway through the shower, water was dripping from my head, and I discovered that there was a shower piece in the middle of the hollowed-out ceiling. I turned it off, and it kept dripping. The cutout ceiling is a little scary. Don't know what will fall.
4. The most disgusting thing is that after sleeping until 5 o'clock, I was woken up by the smell. You heard it right, I was woken up by the smell. There was a strong smell of the bathroom. I was grateful to go to the toilet, but there was no water in the toilet. Seeing that the bottom was a little yellow, I didn't think of taking a photo, so I quickly flushed it. I am 100% sure that I flushed the bathroom before going to bed, but there is no water at the bottom of the toilet and the smell is emitted? ? ?

msg:At that time, I was interested in charging piles, and I happened to be an Xiaopeng car, but I wrote in the description that there were two requirements, one was quiet, and the other was far away from the elevator entrance, so that the sound of the elevator sliding could be clearly heard in the room. I didn’t remind me when I stayed in the store, what’s the use of remarking the content, what’s the effect, and the takeaway can’t be delivered, there is no delivery robot, so I have to go down to get it, or I can send it to the takeout cabinet and pick it up by myself, and I have to go down Take, I didn’t experience any service in the whole service, so I gave one point for the service, and my other colleagues encountered a very miraculous thing. We checked out early because there was an urgent matter and we needed to leave early. Let the aunt I will come to clean later, but I still knock on the door. Our two colleagues are joint rooms. Is it not shown on your form? I also value that this place is relatively close to the venue, so I will come here. Who knows that I will encounter this problem. , there is another problem, the things are hidden too well, and there is no logo, and the things can't be found at all. I found a water heater and rummaged through the cabinets. I opened them all before I found the kettle. The most terrible thing is that there is no socket on the bedside table. Maybe remind You, go to bed early, don't play with your mobile phone, paper is only available in the bathroom, not in the room, there is no sign for the water gate in the shower room, there is a problem with the hot and cold switch, it takes a long time to know where the hot water is, the sprinkler can only be held, Otherwise, if you wash for a long time, the outside will become a vast ocean, and the equipment can be rated at most 1 point. In fact, 1 point for the real evaluation is superfluous. I don’t know how to describe the hygiene and environment. The hotel lobby is very quiet and a**ospheric, and the convenience store is out of service. , The lobby bar is closed, the cash machine is closed, the automatic door from the parking lot to the hotel is not bad, you don’t need to pull it with your hands, I really can’t say how good it is, the musty smell in the room still exists, it’s a matter of time, can it I understand, but I really can't understand the other issues. I read the comments and replies, and it seems that the international is going to change to the Sheraton Riverside, which may affect many operations. This is the only way I understand it.

It was stuffy and hot, and the windows couldn't be opened. When I checked in, I asked the front desk if I could upgrade the room type. After asking three times, I was like a deaf person without any answer! When I entered the room, I found it was too stuffy and hot. I called and asked if I could change the direction. I was told that I couldn't, and a fan could be provided! See you soon! It took hundreds of hotels to feel like going back to the 1980s, with a hot shaking head fan! Never live a second time!
