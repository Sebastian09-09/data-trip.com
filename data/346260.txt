Order the room service and one of the egg Benedict went missing. I‚Äôm puzzled thinking is it only one with egg Benedict and the other one is without and called the service desk to check. They were quick to action and deliver another one to me but to my surprise I found the egg Benedict inside the dining cart and I ask the staff that deliver to me if he‚Äôs aware of it and he admit. This is quite bad cos if u drop the food, u should be honest about it and inform me and not trying to get it thru like that

Check-in was extremely slow - with a queue developing, despite it being past midnight - they also required a large deposit (double the room rate!) which we felt was excessive. Breakfast was so-so, quite a lot of choice but generally not particularly good quality - was bored of the selection by the third morning. Lots of parking which was very convenient. To be aware, there are no USB ports in the room and cannot borrow a charging block, so be sure to bring/buy your own. In-room dining menu had a wide selection and good quality. Rooms were clean and well-kept. We were brought a small gift for Christmas, which was very kind. Overall, the location and views make up for any minor ******* - would highly recommend for a city break in Xiamen.

The staff at the front desk polite and very helpful with everything from explaining about the area to help booking tickets to Gulangyu. Be aware that the main sightseeing spots on Gulangyu are free of charge for elderly (above 65).

All other staff we met were very kind and smiling. It seemed like they remembered us from the first contact. 

Our room was on 22 floor with a stunning wiew. Kept clean to perfection every day and always supplied with plenty of water, coffee etc. 

It is a big hotel so be aware that there is a rush hour on the breakfast buffet from around 8:30. Buffet includes both western and Asian food. The staff is efficient and the restaurant is clean and food is fresh made.

The hotel has indoor swimming pool and fittness center. We just had a brief look at the facilities. It looked nice and well kept like all other places in the hotel.

We absolutely can recommend this hotel.

Great well-maintained room, they gave me a free upgrade and snack when I first arrived. :) View of the opposite island and sea is awesome - the main reason for feeling so happy when we are in the room. Wifi is also great - which is not to be taken for granted. Also every decor and fitting and furniture is so well maintained, cannot tell that this is an old hotel. Love our stay. Take a didi to go to a nearby ferry terminal to Gulangyu. Can buy tickets at the counter for low season. Only thing is that in the morning, you have to budget more time getting down. It is so popular a timing but only 3 lifts serving the floors so it took us more than 20min. Other 2 are only for floors 1-3. And this is in low season. But overall, really wonderful upkeep and high standard ambience. Chinese restaurant quality is high and prices reasonable. Thank you for your great service.

I went down to ask why was it so. The staff named Olivia told me that the room was treated and windows was opened so the room should be ok. But I told her to check it by herself. She then told me that if I still can't accept this room then they have no other option but to ask me to move to other hotel.

Off course I disagreed and confront the matter with the Manager named Alex and he finally got a non-smoking room for me, which he said this room is reserved for the next guest who will checked in later. This really sounds ridiculous!

I approached the hotel management on Dec. 2nd night to talk about the matter with Mr. AmberÈíüÂâëÈ∏ø. He said he is awared of this matter and said the staff Olivia needs more internal training. 

Untill the day I checked out on Dec. 3rd, there isn't any message of apologies from the hotel management. 

Will never pay RMB 1400/night to receive this kind of lousy swiss hospitality.

msg:Located on Xiamen harbour front, the Swiss Grand Hotel offers a front row seat of Gulangyu Island and panoramic views across the bay. This is the real selling point. 

It's not the newest of hotels, more Grandad than Grandeur, but has lots of charm and grace. The rooms are good, a little tired in places and as others have stated, the placing of products in the room that are 'chargeable extras' is a bit old school. 

The breakfast buffet was superb. A lot of choice and variety and the serving times allowed for early starts or if you fancied a layin. We stayed for 5 nights and still enjoyed every visit. 

Staying with young Children, there is a kids soft play area, though this is a chargeable extra. A lot of hotels are offering this facility, but why they charge hotel guests to use is not great. The play area in general was OK and offers a variety of activities, but the scalextric track did not work (and costs extra to use), some of the ball pool vacuum pipes didn't work, and why oh why did someone think hard wood pellets is a great material to put in a soft play. It kills your feet walking on it, and the small hard pieces are a serious risk to very young kids. 

Location wise, this hotel wins over many better, newer hotels. 

A few tips/heads up:

The ferry for tourists is not adjacent to the hotel as you may be led to believe. Its a 15 min taxi ride up stream to the 'international cruise terminal'. Buying tickets of you don't have a Chinese ID card is a pain and the overall hassel of it all makes you question is it worth it. Buy or borrow a good pair of binoculars and sit in your room. 

Xiamen Railway Station is not as near as you think. Give yourself at least an hour if catching a train. We missed ours due to heavy traffic. 

Taxis are plenty, though its convenient if you can book the Uber style cars. With our amount of luggage and my foreign face many local taxis didn't want to take us. With 3 young kids I can kind of understand.

The red Sightseeing bus is not particularly great for seeing sights. Far better to walk about or use the metro. A lot of the main urban attractions are within walking distance.

Overall, a nice stay with a superb location. I would recommend and would consider staying again. Xiamen is a wonderful city.

There‚Äôs a hospital just at the back of the car park, which is so convenient for covid testing. Breakfast was excellent with a wide array of choices. Lovely lobby area  to relax and enjoy delectable cakes and cappuccino. The gym was very well equipped and indoor pool was large. The one complaint is the slightly musky smell as we walked into the room, probably from the carpet, concierge sprayed air freshener to freshen it up! All the staff were attentive.

It was very crowded at check in and we had people not waiting in the queue and getting attention at the front desk instead of being told to wait in the line as everybody. We then realized the respective receptionist was ignoring us because he didn‚Äôt speak English and we were foreigners. So he was taking people out of the lnstead of us. Another colleague helped after some time. We booked a family room which was huge and we realized we didn‚Äôt needed really this big, while we got a poor view in the back instead if the sea and gulangyu  island great view. We tried to change but it was hopeless as they asked for double the price to upgrade us. A smaller room with right view would have worthed it more. Do your homework better than what we did before booking! Clean large hotel and staff in general nice! Great location just across Gulangyu Island and close to center.

The deluxe sea view king room I booked was on the 18th floor, and you can see Zheng Chenggong and Sunlight Rock (a little far) from the room. Just across the road is the pier for the night cruise on Lujiang River. The Eight Markets and Zhongshan Road are very close, so it is very convenient for going out or ordering takeout. The location is very good. The hotel staff are very enthusiastic. Miss Susanna at the front desk is beautiful and sweet. She helped my family upgrade to a suite. The room is very big and the bed is also very big and comfortable. I will stay here again next time.

msg:It was my first time to stay in this hotel. The attitude of the service staff was quite good. It was my first time to stay and they upgraded me to a sea view suite. I was surprised when I entered the room. The room was very big and comfortable. The room supervisor, Ms. Lian, was even more heartwarming. I got a folded dolphin and a greeting card as a gift ü•∞ I originally only stayed for one night, but I went out to do errands in the morning and came back late to check out. The hotel sent me a message, but I didn‚Äôt see the details because I was busy, so I just replied and said I would be back at 2:00 to check in. . It turns out that the message contained the following:

"[Xiamen Swiss Grand Hotel] OK, this is the guest service center of the Swiss Grand Hotel Xiamen. Check-out after 12 o'clock will be charged 30% of the room rate, check-out after 14 o'clock will be charged 50% of the room rate, and check-out after 18 o'clock will be charged Full day room rate is charged, and you are required to come back as soon as possible to check out. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at 0592-6366666„Äã
I was too busy to read the details at the time. It was already past 2:00 noon when I returned to the hotel. The hotel insisted on charging 30% of the room rate, ¬•231, and refused to waive it no matter what.
The first thing I want to say here is that although I am also responsible, I also know that hotels usually have to check out before 12:00 or 1:00 (I think I can intercede when I go out to do errands). The second hotel is also responsible. When I checked in, the waiter did not remind me of the check-out time. If I exceed the check-out time, what will be the charge? In the end, I stayed one extra night üòÇ (I originally wanted to stay in a more convenient hotel)
The overall experience is both heartwarming and unpleasant.
I hope the person responsible for check-in will remind guests about the check-out rules.

msg:This is a hotel that you never want to stay in again once you stay here, and it is also a hotel that you will never be happy about whenever you think of it.

Facilities: The Executive Seaview King Room + Executive Seaview Twin Room were booked. Except for the windows facing Gulangyu Island, there was really nothing good about them. When I placed the order on March 29, it said that there would be a free mini bar and daily welcome fruit, but when I checked in, there was nothing. There were only two bottles of free water in the mini bar. I asked the front desk customer service whether the package gifts when booking were cancelled, and then a plate of fruit (2 small apples + 1 orange) was sent over. I felt cold when taking pictures. This is the welcome fruit for the executive room of a five-star hotel.
Hygiene: The toiletries set in the room is a cheap push-type large bottle fixed on the wall. There are still traces left on the bottle mouth. The hygiene level is no different from the push-type large bottles in Beijing public toilets. The umbrella head is also broken. It is a very poor quality and light umbrella. Except for four bottles of free water, all items are labeled with high prices. I really want to thank them for not blaming us for this broken umbrella and asking us to compensate according to the price.
Service:
No one asked when we checked in, and the customer service called a porter to help with the luggage. The man responded and disappeared.
When we checked in, we were given another list, which listed the room service content, but it was completely unworthy of the name. Personal butler? From checking in on Tuesday afternoon to checking out on Saturday noon, no one showed up or took the initiative to communicate with us. When we encountered problems, there was no other way to consult and reflect except calling the front desk customer service phone.
The room cleaning was just a matter of doing things. One day when I came back at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, both rooms were not cleaned. After being urged by phone, the cleaning came and cleaned for 5 minutes in a very perfunctory manner.
Food:
The breakfast was very simple to begin with, and there was very little choice. Especially after a business group of more than 200 people checked in on Friday, the breakfast was even more perfunctory. Even the buffet for more than 200 people on Friday night was told that there were only the simplest meals and soft drinks, and the rest were cut.

Shanghai Heping, Hangzhou Youhao, Nanjing Jinling, as well as Shangri-La in Qingdao, Dalian, Qinhuangdao and other cities, are just the five-star hotels I have stayed in in recent years. The impression and service were all very good, and some hotels were even perfect. But this time, I blindly chose the Swissotel Xiamen, and had the worst, worst, worst stay experience.

The hotel's location is actually very good. You can walk to Zhongshan Street, and Gulangyu Island is just opposite, and you can see it perfectly from the window.
The hotel also prepared surprises for children who had birthdays. The children were very happy when they saw them in the room, especially the paintings on the message cards, which were so thoughtful.
Every time I go to the executive lounge, Miss Liu Wei's service attitude is always excellent.
I will stay here again when I visit Xiamen next time.

msg:I told the hotel that I wanted to stay on a higher floor, so I was arranged to stay on the 16th floor. I was satisfied. I sat on the sofa, drank tea and watched the sea üåä, which was very comfortable.
You can see Gulangyu Island, Sunlight Rock, and the statue of Zheng Chenggong. The scenery is beautiful.
The room service attitude is very good, the customer service is superb, the robot answered the phone, and I asked for 2 bottles of water. The water was delivered super fast.

msg:During the May Day trip to Xiamen, the first stop was Ruiyi, because of the geographical location, and because the sea view is opposite Gulangyu, which is very beautiful! The room is quite old, but the bath supplies are still quite tasteful at the time. And the staff are very enthusiastic when they stay here! Very responsible. The location is very good, very close to Metro Line 1. It may also be because the location is relatively central, but it is not easy to get a taxi... I stood at the door for a long time, and no taxi driver was willing to take us to the pier... This experience is very bad. But I have to praise the receptionist at the door for asking every taxi driver who stopped for us one by one, which is really responsible! One thing I need to complain about is that the bathing water temperature of the hotel is too unstable! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because the passenger flow during the May Day is too large, or the facilities are outdated. The water temperature during the shower is extremely unstable, and it is hot and cold when it is always on... Adults don‚Äôt care, but children can easily catch a cold... I reported this problem when I checked out, and the hotel staff really wanted to solve and make up for the problem, which is still worthy of praise.

She called to let me know that I had left my curling iron behind. She also specially mailed it to my next address in Quanzhou by SF Express. Very good and considerate service!
Suggestion: The air conditioner in the hotel is too cold. It doesn't need to be so cold. I stayed in two hotels in Xiamen this time, the first one was Wyndham Yuzhou, and the second one was here.
Geographical location: The location is great and convenient to go anywhere!
Sleep: If you are a light sleeper, don't choose a sea view room, because it is a bit noisy outside and there are many cars.
Room: It is recommended to provide a dehumidifier, which is too humid and has a damp smell.
Hair dryer: Domestic hair dryers are very cheap at one or two hundred now, and it is recommended to replace the hair dryer. I stayed in room 932. Please ask the relevant leaders of the hotel to try the hair dryer. It is too difficult to use.

msg:Good things to say in advance: The location is OK, not far from Zhongshan Road, the high-rise rooms are facing the military port and Gulangyu below, the whole Gulangyu is in full view, and it is very close to the return pier of Gulangyu. It is not far from the Zhenhai Road subway station when you turn left. The WIFI is fast, the room service is also fast, the cleaning is diligent, and the sanitary conditions are no problem. The room is very large.
Okay, let's objectively say some unsatisfactory things: it was obviously renovated a few years ago, it's as old as 20 years old, the toilet cover creaks, the rubber *****s in the shower room are about to fall off, there is no socket on the bedside table, and the hair dryer has very low wind power!
I went out to eat because I really didn't finish a box of food, so I packed it back to the hotel and asked the kitchen to help heat it up before eating. They actually nagging and asked me to sign a waiver document before I could do that! ! Just refuse me? I understand that you are afraid that I will get sick and cause trouble to the hotel, so how different is this from the guests ordering takeout and eating in the hotel? Although they helped me heat up the food, this practice makes people very uncomfortable, and I have never encountered such a thing.
Also, I requested a late check-out, but they reluctantly said I could only check-out half an hour later. Thank you so much, I can only say that they are all five-star hotels, so there is a difference if it is cheaper than others. I thought it was the same company as the Swiss hotel in Shanghai, but after careful inspection, it turned out to be a purely domestic Swiss Grand. This trademark is really misleading. I blame myself, because I valued the swimming pool + a little cheaper price, so I chose this one instead of the one next door.

msg:Here are some bad things.
1. My child had a fever and wanted to give him a bath. I found that the air conditioner could only cool down but not heat. Later, the aunt brought a heater, but it was useless and was not placed in the bathroom. It was still cold. . .
2. The cleaning aunt rang the doorbell twice in the afternoon, but I didn't hear it. I booked a suite. I was changing the diaper of my child in the room and didn't have time to open the door. She opened the door and came in, which scared me. . . . (What the hell, no sense of security and privacy)
3. I went to breakfast in the morning with my one-year-old and one-month-old child in a stroller. As soon as I entered, the waitress said that the room was full and asked me to sit at the entrance (far away from the food). I was out of breath holding the child to get porridge. If it was not possible, I told her to move me to the inside. After sitting down, because I was watching the child, I didn't take a wonton. Just then, a male waiter came and asked me what I needed to drink. I said, "Please help me get it. The wonton is ready." He didn't say that or that he didn't take it. I thought he went to get it for me. . . However, five minutes passed and I saw him walk over to the table next to me and look at me without saying anything. I was speechless for the first time. I ran to get it again and it took no more than ten seconds. I didn‚Äôt understand what the waiter was serving, so I only got a bowl of millet porridge, a piece of corn, a piece of sweet potato, and a custard bun for a breakfast of more than 200 yuan per person. They were all for the children, a bowl of wontons, and five or six for myself. The second time, the male waiter came to ask if the plates were to be collected. I still smiled and asked for help, asking if I could trouble you to get some fruit for the children. It was indeed inconvenient for me to watch him. He didn‚Äôt say to take it or not, and left. . . . ? ? At least say something, right? That‚Äôs it? A five-star hotel? This service? Why did I spend this money to stay here? Oh~ ...

msg:Service: This is the worst brand hotel I have ever stayed in in my life. It is unprecedented and I hope there will be no one like it in the future. 3 things, told in detail.

1. Lobby bar-Yiqu Lounge employees-*** personally attacked and insulted customers.
I arrived at Xiamen Airport from Zhuhai on the morning of April 7. Since there is only one direct flight from Zhuhai to Xiamen a day, I arrived at the hotel earlier than the check-in time. After storing my luggage, I had not eaten any food that day, so I asked the hotel staff if there was a suitable restaurant or bar where I could rest and have a meal. The * manager of the lobby bar introduced the catering facilities in operation in the hotel at that time. I chose the Yiqu Lounge Lobby Bar behind her to take a rest. *The manager took my order and then left. While I was waiting to check-in for my meal, I communicated with my colleagues on the phone about work. So far, everything was normal.
About an hour later, the lounge employee *** came to me with a credit card POS machine and asked me to check out and pay. Since I didn't ask the waiter to pay the bill, I was very surprised, so I asked Ms. *, "Will your lobby bar be closed for lunch break?" Indeed, some hotel dining facilities have lunch break settings. It's not surprising that this is the case. But Ms. ***‚Äôs answer surprised and shocked me. She said, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll evade the bill, so please settle the bill first.‚Äù That‚Äôs very reasonable. I laughed out loud at her, and asked, "Excuse me, Miss *, did I avoid being singled out here, or do I look like someone who escaped being singled out?" So far, Ms. *** didn't feel there was anything wrong with her at all. OK, let‚Äôs go back to ‚ÄúThis has indeed happened in our hotel.‚Äù I spend nearly 100 days in hotels every year when I travel for business. As of the end of April, I stayed at Marriott alone for more than 40 nights. Looking at hotels around the world , such "service-minded" staff really opened my eyes. So I asked Ms. *** to ask her manager to come and settle the bill with me to avoid being suspected of skipping the bill. I told Manager * the whole story, and after she confirmed it with Ms. ***, she kept apologizing. I told her that this matter is not about the person, and as an adult you are responsible for what you say when you wear the hotel uniform and represent the hotel. What's more, when I went to the bathroom, I left my mobile phone, wallet, and backpack in the lobby bar. Because there are surveillance cameras everywhere, I believe in your safety. I also stored my luggage in your hotel. Am I not worried about theft? Or is this your spiritual image of Xiamen as a tourist city or your "special care" for overseas Chinese? Therefore, I hereby upload the receipt and the *manager‚Äôs apology card to prove the authenticity of the matter.

2. The hotel executive lounge does not meet the service standards.
The executive lounge does not care about dress code or environmental experience. We often see guests wearing slippers entering and exiting the lounge. Even though the slippers clearly indicate that they are only for use in the room and gym, the executive lounge staff still ignore them. Even if some guests make loud noises without being discouraged, it will affect the experience of other users. There is only one person working during breakfast time. On the contrary, during happy hours in the afternoon, there are 2 or 3 employees present. When I checked out and asked the front desk whether staff scheduling and personnel allocation should be coordinated, the gentleman at the front desk said perfunctorily, "We can't find anyone, and there's nothing we can do about it." So the guests deserved it. Bar?

3. The flower house is a joke. You can see the leopard only when you see it.
On April 9, I ordered three bouquets of flowers to go to Aoyuan to pay homage to Chen Gong Jiageng. But you must have seen the actual pictures of the flowers. I think even the flowers bought at the roadside flower shop should be packaged with at least ribbons and paper, let alone a hotel that claims to be 5-star? It has been repeatedly stated that this flower is for Mr. Tan Kah Kee. Is it appropriate for a glorious nation to receive such trea**ent? Justice is in the heart of the people.

I just want to say that this is the last time I will stay at Swissotel. Please make your own decision whether you want to stay or not.

This hotel is simply the ceiling of Xiamen's check-in attractions... There is also the Xinnanxuan Restaurant on the third floor. The dishes are exquisite and the ingredients are sufficient. I also give it a thumbs up... The most worth mentioning is that when I checked out and got on the taxi, a welcoming lady (around 12:10 on April 7) was very considerate and warm. She opened the door for us and even rushed to carry the luggage on the car. We were very touched, so we gave her a full score of 5 points. Please commend and reward her.

The hotel's dinner buffet is also very good, with a wide variety of food choices. Guests staying in the hotel can also enjoy special prices, which is very satisfying.

It is also very convenient to call a taxi or bus in front of the hotel. Every time I choose a sea view room, I just want to "open the curtains and see the scenery", which makes me feel super good. The waiters and doormen are very enthusiastic. This is still the first choice hotel in Xiamen.

It is very close to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, and is very convenient for dining and entertainment. The room is large, clean and tidy, the bed is soft and moderate, and the bathroom is spacious and bright. I like the lighting design of the room very much. The room is very bright when all lights are turned on. When resting at night, the corridor lights and night lights are used for lighting, which is soft and not dazzling. The breakfast is rich in variety, the room service is in place, and after check-out, there is a dedicated customer service Xiaojiang who calls to review the check-in experience, which is fully in line with the positioning of a five-star hotel. A very good stay experience.

msg:I'm very busy when I get back, I've been traveling all the time, so I don't have time to comment, so I put it off. Overall, it's average. Opposite is Gulangyu Island, and the view is really good. However, any hotel built in this location will have this view, which is a good starting point. Environment 5 points. Hygiene and other aspects are relatively average, and various small details are not good, such as potato chip crumbs from previous guests on the foot of the bed, serious accumulation of dust in the corners, etc. It should not meet the corresponding star rating of this hotel. Then the front desk also emphasized that it was a non-smoking hotel and asked me not to smoke. Well, I am a non-smoker, but the hotel bed cloth has traces of being burned before. Are you kidding me about being non-smoking? So in terms of hygiene, it can only be rated 3 stars. Regarding facilities, I asked for children's slippers before checking in. I agreed but didn't have them. I went to the room and called again before they were delivered. Then there was the toilet that was clogged around 11pm, so I used it normally, and then it got clogged. Fortunately, the response was okay, and the engineering depar**ent came to clear it within half an hour, so the facility is given 4 stars. The greeting at the door is quite good. Active greetings, opening the door, helping with luggage, etc. are all very good. The key point is the front desk in the lobby, which is very poor. It is simply a crime. A female service manager with the surname * was called. The process was as follows: The doorman led the check-in process at the self-service machine. There were two adults and one child. The doorman said that both adults had to do face recognition. The two adults had their ID cards face recognition. The child didn't have an ID card and couldn't do it, so I said I would stay in room XX. If there was any problem, the police could come directly to my room. I was just traveling normally, so it was nothing, so the doorman didn't say anything. Then the doorman left, and we tidied up a little and were about to get on the elevator. The female service manager named * came out to stop us and said that the children must do facial recognition, otherwise the three of us would not be allowed to check in. I was confused, what does prohibition mean? Are you a police officer? Do you have rights? So we argued with her, but the person couldn't explain the reason. She only said that the Ministry of Public Security required it, and her attitude was cold and overbearing. Since we really didn't have ID cards, the woman then asked us to go to a machine to apply for temporary ID cards. During the filing process, the *female manager was very unskilled in business. The first time she clicked in to buy a boat ticket and issue a temporary ID card. The second time the process was incorrect and failed. The third time the photo was taken incorrectly and failed. It took several attempts to succeed. , a lot of time was wasted during this period. After the final drive, we checked in. The Ministry of Public Security requires real-name registration in the hotel. We fully understand and support it, otherwise we would not agree to various filings and registrations. The key point is that the female service manager named * has a bad attitude and very poor professional skills. This is completely unacceptable. During the communication process, there were many prohibitions on occupancy. I asked you to wait for a very coercive and overbearing use. Is the next step to take action? As a service staff, this is the first business card Xiamen receives tourists? Is there a service manual? How can we communicate with customers if they don‚Äôt understand something? To give a similar example, before our plane took off, a passenger failed to take off his headphones as required by the announcement. The stewardess communicated with a smile over the broadband, but at first the passenger still didn't take them off. The stewardess stood by with a smile for 2 minutes, and the passenger took them off on his own. The stewardess smiled and expressed her gratitude to the passengers. It is a trivial matter in the first place, but the handling methods and service abilities of the female service manager named * and the stewardess are completely different. I strongly complain to the female service manager named *. With her ability and attitude, she can still Be a manager? Did he get in through some unfair means? Does your hotel have a service manual/employee handbook? Check whether this female named * is qualified? *************.

We went there on the same day. It was delicious and had many local specialties. We also went to a Chinese restaurant for lunch the next day.

The hotel has been open for a certain period of time and seems a bit old. Fortunately, the reception attitude of the waiters is very good, especially the lady in the executive lounge. You can also have breakfast in the executive lounge, but the variety is less. There are many desserts, pastries and sugar water available, this one is pretty good. During the day, you can see the scenery of Gulangyu Island. There is a balcony outside and you can see the road leading to the Twin Towers. The scenery is quite beautiful at night. However, there is no independent tea supply in the lobby on the first floor. It is recommended to add one to facilitate travelers to quench their thirst.

In addition, it is recommended that the hair dryer in the room be replaced with a high-power negative ion hair dryer. The wind power of the one equipped in the hotel is too small.
Overall, I'm very satisfied with this hotel. Don't choose a hotel near the convention and exhibition center. It's a bit remote.

The room is large in size, fully equipped and well maintained. The facilities are very easy to use and the bed is very comfortable. The most outstanding advantage of the hotel is its geographical location. It is close to Zhongshan Road, opposite Gulangyu Island, and the starting station of Metro Line 1. It has convenient transportation and is very close to major attractions. Maybe because of the hotel's popularity, there is a long queue every time you check in, and you definitely won't be able to check in before 3 p.m. It was the same thing again this time, no one informed me that I could check in until 4:30. I took the initiative to go to the front desk and asked, and they said it was ready - you should have told me! I've been wandering around the street waiting since 2 o'clock. . . Therefore, it can be seen that the hotel's service is just like this, don't expect anything. The hotel's breakfast is good and rich in variety. There are many people dining in the morning, so go early. The hotel is generally good, thanks to its location.

The breakfast is also great, especially the sister who cleans the room named Zhang Qiuli. She has the best service attitude in a hotel I have ever stayed in. I give her a big thumbs up for being the most conscientious and responsible person. The girl who carried my luggage on the day I checked out also had a great service attitude. I called Lin Xin. I will book this hotel next time I go to Xiamen.

After exiting the hotel, turn right and walk for a few minutes to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. There are several restaurants in Peace Pier worth recommending, and there are also several good restaurants near the Hotel Indigo next to the hotel. I stayed on the executive floor, which is high and quiet. You can overlook Gulangyu Island and see warships. The executive breakfast room has much fewer items than the buffet restaurant on the second floor, but the basic items are still acceptable. High praise for afternoon tea. The room was quite comfortable and the hot water shower was also available. I just happened to stay during the Spring Festival holiday and the room price was ridiculously expensive. Other than that, it is highly recommended.

1. The hair dryer has been replaced last year and is very nice. However, the hair dryer cannot be used in the bathroom. If you blow your hair, the hair will fall out in the bedroom. This is not a good feeling. You can only use the charger of the razor in the bathroom.
2 There are no free drinks in the refrigerator. The administrative customer service can go to 26f to get free drinks, but they only have carbonated drinks such as Coke and Sprite, and no juice.
3 On February 8th, the guy at the Chaos booth at the breakfast buffet on the 2nd floor had a bad attitude. He was like ***. He has already complained, but he only wanted to give feedback to his supervisor.

Some of the facilities in the room are old if you look carefully. At the same time, the hotel does not provide free laundry service. This is not as good as my last trip, the Mercure Hotel in Guangzhou. A five-star hotel should not have this configuration. Finally, breakfast from outside is not allowed.

msg:Before going to Xiamen, we spent a long time choosing the hotel and finally chose Swiss International Hotel. Facts have proved that we made the right choice. First of all, the room is really big. When all the lights in the room are turned on, it is very bright. I like this very much. The overall feeling is very warm. In particular, the pair of swans and a baby elephant (folded with towels) given to us by room manager Geng Hongyan were very cute. Later, they also gave us a plate of fruit. It was a special surprise when we came back from the tour. We all liked it. By the way, the dishes in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel are quite affordable, and the Hong Kong-style dim sum is also delicious. Friends who like it can try it! Next time I come to Xiamen, I will choose their restaurant!

Let‚Äôs talk about the location. I took the high-speed rail to Xiamen North Station and took Line 1. I took Exit 1 under Zhenhai Road and walked to the hotel in 5 minutes. Ocean view rooms are still available, if you don‚Äôt want to go to the beach to watch the sunrise. You can watch the sunset from the large floor-to-ceiling windows in the room, and it‚Äôs also nice to take photos.
Two streets behind the hotel is the Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, a 10-minute walk to Bashi, and a 15-minute walk to the First Pier to Gulangyu Island.

It is very convenient to book rides online. There is a time-honored Fujian restaurant called Xinnanxuan on the third floor of the hotel, which specializes in Southern Fujian and Cantonese cuisine. The small yellow croaker in soy sauce is particularly delicious and much better than the Internet celebrity restaurant in World Trade Plaza. The steamed chicken feet tastes no worse than that of a Cantonese restaurant. The hotel service is first-class, I must give it a thumbs up üëç.

msg:The five-star praise goes to the staff of the executive lounge, especially Susan Wu Yijing and Lin Xin. The service is very attentive and so good that I was prevented from changing hotels. As well as the guest room staff and room supervisor Zou Taihua in charge of 24F, they also have a very good work attitude.

What follows are the existing problems.

Rooms:
‚ë†The guest room is not maintained in time after the guest checks out, especially the shower room;
‚ë° The sanitary blind spots in the guest room are not handled well, such as the black back panel in the shower room;
‚ë¢There are problems with the decoration of the wash basin, and there are problems with the installation height and angle of the faucet;
‚ë£The bathroom has no socket;
‚ë§The bathtub does not have a shower head;
‚ë•The sound of the air conditioner is so loud that you will definitely not be able to sleep without wearing earplugs;

Serve:
‚ë†There is a swarthy male receptionist with mushroom hair at the front desk on the first floor. He doesn‚Äôt even raise his eyelids when asked by guests and is very arrogant;
‚ë°After checking in, no one took the luggage to the room;


FOOD:
‚ë†The employee in charge of omelettes on the second floor did not wear a hat at the operation station and had a bad attitude towards customers. When the guests were dining, he left the operation room and went to the yogurt area to make himself a cup of yellow peach yogurt and went back to drink it;
‚ë° The breakfast dining environment on the second floor is very noisy. When some guests play their mobile phones loudly, the waiter should stop them in time;
‚ë¢The employees in the breakfast room on the second floor gathered and chatted at the door, like three little sparrows;
‚ë£The food in the executive lounge is small in variety and not refined, and the dishes are basically not changed every day. Quality control and efficiency need to be improved;

other:
‚ë†The elevator does not have good ventilation;
‚ë° Exterior wall decoration time is too early;
‚ë¢ As a guest who stayed in an executive room for 9 days and 8 nights, when I asked to stay one to two hours longer when checking out, I was decisively rejected and told that an additional room fee would be charged. This made people instantly feel that this hotel is very inhumane and indifferent. , in fact, most five-star hotels are fine with this situation if they have enough rooms, which is very disappointing;
‚ë£The ventilation in the 5F gym is poor and the smell of disinfectant is pungent;

Generally speaking, the location of this hotel is excellent, very close to Zhongshan Road, Gulangyu Island and other attractions. However, the decoration and most services are indeed not up to five-star standards, and I hope they can be improved.

The room is spacious and comfortable with a good view. The bathroom sink has enough space to store cosmetics and skin care products.
The transportation is convenient, close to the subway and bus, and it is more convenient to visit Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street. It's also quite close to take a taxi to Xiagu Pier and take a boat.

All the staff I met were very service-minded. Although there were a lot of guests, the service was proactive and considerate, unlike some previous city hotels that chased guests to write good reviews. The room price is very affordable, highly recommended!

On the third day, I also tried breakfast on the second floor. There were more types of food but the service was a little behind.

I booked premium room 2322 and looked at Gulangyu Island. The sea view was good during the day, but after 9pm it was basically black.

There are movies and TV in the room. The tea bags for coffee and tea are not to my taste. I don‚Äôt know what other people think.

The pillow is too soft and I can't sleep on it. Get something to raise your head.
The air conditioning in the room is good, which is perfect in March and April. In the summer, you won‚Äôt know if the air conditioner is ok after being exposed to the sun all day, because your skin will be hot after being exposed to the sun.

The red cup in the room was leaking. I looked puzzled. I poured a cup of chrysanthemum tea and half of it was gone. The cup was full of water. I had to clean it myself. . .

The water drained out of the bathtub very quickly, but the water was filled in very slowly. Even after half an hour, the water was not filled enough. The water temperature was also poor, only slightly warm.

There is only one socket next to the bed, not two. It is inconvenient to charge or play with mobile phones at night.

The sofa, work table and luggage storage area are great. The room also has clothes ironing equipment and a good hair dryer.

msg:I booked a superior room and called before I went to say that I could get an extra bed (at my own expense).
After arriving at the hotel and checking in, we upgraded to an executive city view room (the city view is hard to describe, so I don‚Äôt recommend choosing this room type). I think it‚Äôs no different from the superior room.
I waited until 3:40 and still couldn‚Äôt finish cleaning. I had to wait for more than an hour.
I could only put my luggage away and go out for fun. It was past 22:00 when I returned to the hotel. I asked the hotel to add an extra bed and said that I was not sure if it could be added. I asked the waiter to come in and check the key points. When the waiter came, she was confused and asked her what kind of bed it was. I couldn‚Äôt tell if I could move in, and I wasn‚Äôt sure. I communicated with the front desk before adding a bed after 23:00.
All in all, the location and the room are okay. The room is quite big, but the service and communication need to be further standardized.

The lobby and corridors are spacious and upscale. The downside is that there is a slight smell in the room, probably from the carpet. The hotel is very close to the business district, within a 10-minute walk is the Chinatown shopping mall and commercial street.

The decoration is not the latest. Some things are in disrepair. For example, the sliding door of the bathroom cannot be locked, which is a bit embarrassing. The temperature of the refrigerator is too low, and the fruit is frozen. The breakfast is rich and worth eating. It is cheaper to check in and add breakfast than online, just more than 100. The service is more polite, and problems will be solved in time. It is worth living in Xiamen. Although it is not full of points, it will not be a pitfall.

I had to carry my luggage by myself, because my child‚Äôs ID card was in the car. I wanted to check in first and help me bring my luggage up, but the girl at the front desk asked me to go to the side to fill in a certificate. She didn‚Äôt even see that I was carrying a huge mountaineering backpack. Bag, this bag can be 40 kilograms. The hotel room didn't even have a window that could be opened. Anyway, it is an extremely ordinary hotel with no value for money. I will never stay there again. I went to Andaz the next day, and there was a huge difference between Andaz and Rigobi.

Special praise is given to Geng Hongyan, the eldest sister in charge of the guest room on the floor, for her meticulous, caring and creative work. The children are looking forward to what kind of small animals will be waiting for her when they return to the room every day.
Opposite is Gulangyu Island, you can overlook the whole island from the house.
The only small suggestion: There are a little few bedside sockets, and only one person can charge.

I was quite disappointed when I returned to the old place today. According to the standards of Gaoxing, the reputation has been declining and it is not worth choosing. Especially the attitude of the service. For two consecutive days, the children (paying) were unhappy when dining. It makes people feel that the managers of this hotel lack basic service awareness. The attitude of the employees is blunt and rude. It is strange to have visited so many hotels.

In addition to the good location, the first feeling after check-in is: the service staff is really enthusiastic, and the two people who are more impressed are:
One is Vinne Wu Lin in the lobby. She helped us with our luggage as soon as we entered the hotel, and even delivered our luggage to the room after check-in. The little girl is always smiling and very friendly‚ù§Ô∏è.
The other one is Geng Hongyan from the guest room depar**ent. The next day, she thoughtfully helped us add a few more bottles of mineral water and gave us a cute "little elephant". My daughter likes it very much, thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
In addition to the service, the room facilities and environment are also great.

It was in the same class as the security guard I praised in the merits. Fortunately, another security guard came to help in time.

Advantages: All the staff in the hotel have a very good service attitude except for a few. They have a strong sense of service. The food in the Chinese restaurant on the 3rd floor is good, and the bath water is very large. , from the welcome depar**ent and the Chinese restaurant on the third floor and Xiao Cai Joan, I hope all the problems have been solved next time!

I originally wanted to book a Gulangyu sea view room, but after reading the reviews, several guests complained that the outer window glass was dirty and affected the view, so I gave up and booked a regular city view room. When I actually checked in, the exterior window glass was really dirty. If I booked a sea view room, the glass would look very bad. Fortunately, I didn't book it.
Takeaways need to be picked up at the designated location in the hotel parking lot. Fortunately, it‚Äôs not hard to find, so that‚Äôs okay.
The hotel is close to Xiamen Maternal and Child Health Hospital. It is a 3-5 minute walk to the bus station and Metro Line 1. It is very convenient to travel to various scenic spots on the island.
The room is spacious and the bedding is relatively comfortable. The cleaning staff Ren Jinhua and the front desk Xiao Zhao are very enthusiastic in their service.

msg:The hotel is very close to Zhongshan Street, which is convenient for travel. The front desk staff of the hotel are enthusiastic. However, the overall check-in efficiency at the front desk is a bit slow and needs to be improved. The room facilities are quite complete, and the scenery in front of the window is very good. You can have a panoramic view of the whole Gulangyu Island. The hotel's buffet is not rich enough, and there are too few varieties. On the first day, I saw some passengers complaining that they wanted to refund the buffet fee. On the second day, I heard a passenger say that the buffet fee of 128 yuan per day is too much for two days. I ate a bowl of soy milk, a fried dough stick, and a bowl of porridge. Indeed, my personal experience is the same. There is no choice. But it is commendable that the supervisor in the buffet is still the manager. When I asked if I could provide some raisins, because I like to add raisins to the yogurt, he immediately agreed to help me find them and delivered them to me in a short time. In the hand, it is really warm and caring. There is another point that really needs to be improved, that is, I saw comments on the Internet that there were mites on the bed and I was bitten. As a result, I was bitten a few times after sleeping all night. The hotel still needs to do a good job of removing mites. In addition, the toilet cover of the hotel really needs to be replaced. After all, it is a five-star hotel, and the toilet cover that does not match the toilet body really falls short of the five-star standard.

msg:The best thing about the hotel is the room service, especially Ms. Cai Guilan, who is capable and enthusiastic, responsive to the needs of customers, and always smiling. She is the service staff who smiles the most and responds the fastest in the hotel.

The hotel is clean with the work of housekeeping. The second advantage of the hotel is that the room is large. The location is also good, but the nearby hotels are all good.

Next talk about the bad. This is the worst front desk, breakfast, and customer service I have traveled to so many countries, more than four stars. I booked for many days, obviously I have always asked for a high floor, but the front desk didn't care about the customer's needs at all, and didn't even have a smiling face. It looked like sending someone away, saying that it was already the highest floor. As a result, even half of the floors are not available, so it is said that the requirements are met. I saw some comments saying that there are rice dumplings during the Dragon Boat Festival, but I didn‚Äôt receive them anyway. The attitude of the front desk is that I am busy and don‚Äôt have time to deal with you.

I have been to many four-star and above hotels, and this is the only one that does not provide disposable toiletries and uses large bottles. There are stingy details everywhere, such as no needle and thread provided. On the first day, I called the front desk to ask for water. The artificial voice emphasized that I can only give two bottles of water, and I was charged more than 20 yuan for each bottle, which shocked me. This is the first time I met a hotel, so openly said don't ask me to deliver too much water, although the girl who came to deliver the water has a very good attitude. On the morning of the first day, the air-conditioning in the lobby was insufficient.

There are many choices for breakfast, but none of the tastes are available. If you open a restaurant outside with such dishes, no one is willing to spend money to eat. A little delicious food is often not replenished in time. On the last day, I found that the best breakfast was the small croissant (note, I said the small croissant), but after staying for so many days, there was only one morning, and there were less than 10 each time, 5 There was none within minutes, but less than 10 new loaves arrived half an hour later.

Thanks to the hotel, I saw a spider about the size of my palm.

All in all, this is a misnomer of a 5-star hotel, except for room cleaning and newly renovated rooms, there is no home-from-home service, very little attention to detail, a true 5-star attitude of getting things done rather than striving for perfection.

If you just want a big room and don't have many other requirements, you can live here. If you have lived in four or five-star hotels, you will definitely find many shortcomings of the hotel.

But as a so-called five-star hotel, basic hotel hygiene cannot be guaranteed. On the third day of my stay, I returned to the room at nine o'clock in the evening after playing. The whole bathroom was filled with a fishy smell. After the front desk arranged for the waiter to come over, he just sprayed detergent blindly and asked why. He didn't explain the simple solution and said it was no problem. He left and tried to enter the bathroom. There was still a fishy smell. It took me a long time to call the front desk before a lady who claimed to be a supervisor came and asked the reason. She didn't explain the reason and just cleaned it. After more than ten minutes, the smell still couldn't be eliminated. She asked for a room change and said there was no room. I couldn't bear to tell her. Can't live with children. I called very reluctantly and finally said that there was a room that could be changed for me and then left without any formal apology. The whole process took more than an hour from 9 o'clock. The hotel staff was unapologetic and looked impatient when asking to change rooms.
ps. After changing rooms, I discovered that only my room had an air purifier, and that the purifier would alarm after running for a while. Now I think about whether the fishy smell is an old problem. .

msg:Swiss Grand Hotel, No. 12, Lujiang Road, Siming District
Take Metro Line 1 from the high-speed railway station to the terminal station Zhenhai Road, Jimei School Village
You can also feel the charm of the sea subway at Gaoqi Station
It takes about 5 minutes to walk from the subway exit to the hotel
You can check in by yourself (will be faster) or manually (recommended)
The deluxe twin room booked is now 682 yuan per night without breakfast on non-weekends. There are many places to eat near the hotel, and you don‚Äôt need hotel breakfast, which is cheaper
More than 100 per room
Deluxe twin rooms can be chosen from the 5th to 12th floors. When we checked in that day, the handsome guy at the front desk upgraded us to a non-smoking suite on the 11th floor for free. The room is really super big, with two beds, a 2-meter 11-meter small bed, a living room, and two bathrooms. The only drawback is that the suite does not have a sea view, while the twin room can see the sea view.
The room has good sound insulation and is very quiet. The basic facilities are all available, and the hygiene is acceptable.
The hotel is in a great location. Turn right and you will find Zhongshan Road, where you can go shopping at the night market and eat snacks. Opposite is the pier, where you can enjoy the night view or go to Gulangyu Island. The landmark Twin Towers are on the left. It only costs about 20 yuan to take a taxi to get there. The surrounding restaurants and bars are also very good.

Because I was afraid of the dark, I asked the front desk for a particularly clean room, and Wu Qianyi, the little brother at the front desk, was not fooling at all. I really gave a sunny and warm room. I stayed here for two nights and slept soundly. Thank you very much. The meals are delicious and the services are also very satisfactory.

The view is very good, the scenery is invincible, and the sun is invincible. Although the room is not completely satisfactory, But it is much better than expected, the room is darker, with a strong musty smell, like the long-term airtight smell of an old house, but the invincible sea view still sweeps away all the haze,
Facilities: really old, smelly
Hygiene: Fair, the location of the toilet and door in the bathroom is a bit funny
Environment: old hotel facilities
Service: Check-in is too slow, you have to wait for too long, and the check-in is not informed in time. The funniest thing is that after checking out for more than three hours, the person received a call from the hotel at the airport, saying that one of our rooms had consumed two bottles of Evian water. How much Evian water is worth the house price on May Day, and if there is an explanation before leaving the cabinet, it is understandable that I am too busy. I will call after more than three hours, not to mention who drank the water, which is a bit good. oh.

2. The suite is very large, with two beds and two bathrooms, without interfering with each other. Overlooking Gulangyu Island, I feel very good every day when I open the curtains and look at the sea.
3. The decoration and breakfast are okay, especially the breakfast. During the peak period of May Day, it is not easy to go to breakfast at 9 o'clock without queuing.
4. I would like to thank Becci Xiaojiang from the guest service center. When I checked out, I left a T-shirt on the bed. I didn‚Äôt find it until I arrived at the second hotel. After calling the hotel to help SF Express, I received it the next day, which reflects the service level of the hotel. .

The location is convenient, and the parent-child room cannot see the sea. Opposite is Gulangyu Sanqiutian Wharf. It's a pity that foreign tourists have to go to the farther Xiagu Wharf to take a boat. The only downside is that the elevator is relatively slow and takes a long time to wait.

1. Front desk. Very good hotel, very bad front desk. The lady during the day is okay, but the man who works the evening shift is very arrogant and impatient. It's not as good as the express hotel of Mercure all season.
2. Everything is charged. The pattern of the village head hotel at the five-star price. The price of drinking water in the room is charged, the razor is 20, and the tea is charged. I just want you to be caught by accident. Toiletries are not disposable, and there is a skin care product on the sink that needs to be ordered on the wall.
3. Facilities. When I opened the door and saw the floor when I entered the door, I felt very dirty. The decoration of the room is very old, and the trash can is not bagged. Do you clean or replace the trash can? The lighting cannot be turned off with one key, you need to turn it off one by one.
4. Service. The takeaway was not delivered, so I had to go downstairs to get it myself. It was still in the parking lot at the corner, and a large pile of takeaway was placed on a small outdoor table. I ran twice but couldn‚Äôt find it. I went to ask the front desk, and I was still disappointed Point to me patiently. A problem that can be solved by a robot is hard to bear.
5. Others. It seems to be an Internet celebrity hotel, there are quite a lot of people, you need to queue up to check in, and you can only check in at 3 pm.

Let me talk about the advantages:
1. The scenery is really good. You can see Gulangyu Island through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Compared with the small windows of Lujiang Hotel, the scenery here is really great. It depends on what you want. If you want service and food, choose Lujiang, and if you want scenery, choose here.
2. Convenient. Walk a few hundred meters to Zhongshan Road, take a taxi at the door, and the bus is very convenient.

Thank you, Aunt Ren. A little problem with the hotel is that the soundproofing facilities in the room need to be strengthened. Some guests turn on the TV very loudly in the room, and they can hear it in the next room. If it is midnight, it will affect the rest of other guests. Some guests were already singing in the room before 6 o'clock in the morning, and the sound was loud, which affected other guests' normal rest. After reporting the situation to the front desk of the hotel, they immediately came to communicate with the resident. Although it was finally resolved perfectly, but The hotel needs to strengthen management in this regard. Everyone is here for vacation, so of course they hope to have a good rest.

msg:I plan to take my family to Xiamen for a trip during the Spring Festival. After several comparisons, I chose Ruiyi Hotel Xiamen. I started to read reviews on the Internet saying that the hotel facilities are old and the sound insulation is poor. Opposite the curtain is Gulangyu Island. On the first day, due to the large number of people staying, our three rooms were not arranged on the same floor. The next day the front desk took the initiative to help us change floors. The hotel's breakfast variety is quite rich, and the taste is quite satisfactory. It may be due to the busy Spring Festival. There are queues for breakfast, and many dishes are not prepared enough. There is a parent-child paradise on the second floor of the hotel. If it is not a parent-child room, it will charge 50. Xinnanxuan on the third floor of the hotel tastes good, but the price is a little expensive, and the consumption of 6 people is about 3000. About 10 minutes' walk downstairs of the hotel is Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, which is very convenient to travel. Overall, the trip to Xiamen was very smooth and happyüòÄ

msg:Before the epidemic, this hotel received many foreign friends. I came to Xiamen again after 10+ years and chose this hotel specifically to experience it.
If the so-called sea view room is arranged on a low floor, the look and feel will be much worse.
The room was clearly marked as non-smoking, and there was a large no-smoking sign in the elevator room on the floor. However, as soon as I checked in, I smelled the pungent smell of smoke. An ashtray and matches were even provided in the room. . . . . Speechless
After many unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the switchboard, I struggled until very late and finally agreed to change the room to an apar**ent-style room with a refrigerator and microwave. However, there was still a strong smell of smoke. . . I guess there was something wrong with the hotel management, or maybe they couldn't afford to offend the domestic conference guests and allowed them to do all kinds of things in the room?
Special thanks to the cleaning lady that night who kept helping me and even made an exception to open the window in the room for ventilation. Although there was a lot of noise on the road outside the window, I endured it for the fresh air!

The water in the sink is not flowing smoothly at all and the foam is blocked and cannot drain out.
There are 5 elevators in the hotel, but it still takes a long time to go up and down the stairs.
When checking out, there are mixed queues for check in and out, which is very inefficient. Several long lines make the lobby noisy.

The only thing I praise is that there are really many international channels. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen such clear Phoenix TV.

And there is a toilet and sink at the entrance, which is convenient for more people to use. There are two sliding doors, which are spacious when opened, soundproof when closed, and have a sense of design. The powder room is also very special. Two bottles of water will be provided, but there will be a charge for two additional bottles of Evian water, as well as tea. The hotel has its own parking lot, and there is no charge for driving. Breakfast is also good, there are two places, one big and one small. The accommodation experience on the first day was not good, there were few waiters, and the room was not tidied up. Overall worth recommending.

Who told us to travel on holidays, but the service is too bad. The room is equipped with a large bathtub and if you want to take a bath, you will be charged 50 yuan for a bathtub cover. Grab money.

I was a little disappointed to stay again. The sea view suite does not have floor-to-ceiling windows. If you want to be amazed at a glance, you should book a sea view king bed or twin beds.
The glass too affects vision and photography, because it is too dirty, you can deal with it.
The breakfast is quite satisfactory, it's okay.

msg:Because it is the Spring Festival, the occupancy rate is too high, and the experience is hard to describe. First of all, the hotel stipulates that check-in is at 15:00. Many people waited to check-in in the lobby that day, and the reply was basically that the room had not been cleaned. When I went out at 9:30 the next morning, I was afraid that the guest room would not be cleaned, so I specially pressed the "clean immediately" light at the door, but when I came back at 17:00 in the afternoon, it was still not cleaned. I reported it to the administrative front desk, and finally came to clean it. If I didn't report it, would I not come to clean it?
In addition, the transportation and location of the hotel are invincible, facing Gulangyu Island and close to the pier. It's just that the hotel facilities are too old, and I didn't even dare to turn on the air conditioner after staying for two days. Because the indoor temperature was too high, seeing the room temperature reaching 28 degrees, I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night, so I called the room service, and sent a fan, saying that the floor below was too cold, and she had nothing to do, so I could only is speechless.
The service attitude of the hotel is really good. If there is any problem, it will be rectified. It is understandable that there are various problems during the Spring Festival occupancy peak.

1 The reserved executive room, the so-called afternoon tea and happy hour were inexplicably arranged in the lobby. The epidemic cannot be used as an excuse now. Ask the front desk staff, the answer is "Our executive lounge has not been open for a long time, it has been closed". Speechless...
2 The toiletries are no longer individually packaged in small bottles, but are replaced by large bottles for shared use. The five-star hotel has just found the feeling of "full season" and "home away from home"...
3 Disposable razors are not provided, if necessary, 20 yuan/set. Did you learn from "All Seasons" and "Home Inns" again?

msg:What kind of management team did this hotel hire? They are so stingy. As long as you see 45 yuan of charged water on your bedside, waiting for you to drink in a hotel at night, everyone should be careful
1. In a five-star hotel, there are no razors. I can understand environmental protection and avoid waste, but you should be able to provide them if the guests need them. The hotel‚Äôs disposable razors cost less than a few cents and a dollar. Please inform me I want to charge, lost money
2. I forgot to wear a mask when I went downstairs. I asked the lobby if I could get a mask. I was told that there would be a charge. Any hotel would provide guests with a free mask. They would charge for everything. I was crazy about money.
3. There is also a notice posted on the toiletries, and you will be charged for taking more. This is the first time I have seen this. Is it because a customer ordered 100 toothbrushes or 100 combs at once to prevent customers like this?
4. There are no towels anywhere in the pool, except for one in the cabinet. Other hotels are all bathrooms, and there are enough towels on the deck chairs. I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll catch a cold. This hotel is afraid that you won‚Äôt be exposed to the wind when you get up. If the managers have a bit of brains, shouldn‚Äôt they take care of the guests‚Äô bodies during the severe epidemic, instead of blindly are cutting costs.
One or two thousand rooms are full during the Chinese New Year, and these expenses should not be reduced.

msg:It's better than I imagined, after all, there are so many black reviews on Ctrip, but when I actually saw the room, I still think it's much better than I imagined. There are no new hotels in the entire Siming District, the scheduled time is a bit late, and the Indigo next door is also full. In the end, I settled here out of apprehension, but I was much more relieved when I saw the room for the first time.

Hygiene: Hygiene is still good, it looks clean and tidy, and the carpet has no traces of history as imagined.

Environment: The hotel is quite a**ospheric overall. I am still very satisfied with the lobby, Haagen-Dazs is also sold at normal prices, and the coffee in the lobby is also good. I was worried about being old when I read the bad reviews before, but it is actually much better. Impressive.


Service: The service is a bit confusing. When I checked in that day, it said that the room was still being cleaned. I chose the privilege of Ctrip Platinum Members, redeeming points and checking in 4 hours in advance, but I still had to wait an hour and a half when I arrived at the hotel. During the period, the Ctrip specialist said that he had to communicate with the concierge at the front desk, but he still stood there indifferently, and no one cared about it. It's really dead. I was in a hurry, the flight arrived at noon, I didn't eat any food, and no one cared about the result of the wait. I sat in the lobby abruptly until 2 o'clock and didn't check in. Finally, Ctrip called for the third time, and a manager came to check in. I don't understand the operation of the hotel, so I dumped two drink coupons bluntly to calm things down. Almost everyone in the lobby has two, just to appease. The service is really badass.

Location: The location is really convenient, you can walk to Zhongshan Road. There are also check-in attractions around. It is also close to Gulangyu Pier. It faces Gulangyu Island across the sea.

The disadvantage is that the service can't keep up. The biggest disadvantage is that the sound insulation is really poor. Every night I was woken up by the snoring of the uncle next door. Every night at 3 o'clock in the morning, the snoring sound of the big brother next door came on time. Really convinced, this penetrating power. If the schedule is in a hurry, I think you can choose, and I personally think it is more convenient.

There is a "humidifier" next to the "air purifier", I have never seen such an outrageous thing, I said that the room is dry and the nosebleed is humidified! Also send "dehumidifier"!

I would like to ask the most basic health and safety hotels can't guarantee it. Can I feel at ease when I stay in this way? As a tenant, you can understand that the hotel has a lot of people on holidays, but is this an excuse to solve the problem and harm the health of the tenants? ?

After staying for four days, the room service also thoughtfully wrote a small note and sent two more bottles of water. The location here is very good, very close to Zhongshan Road, I walk to eat and buy fruit every day. The nucleic acid point is also very convenient, just at the back door of the hotel.
The only downside is that the smell of perfume in the hotel lobby is too strong, but fortunately there are masksüò∑

The price of the room with the same view is 80% of the hotel next door, and it also enjoys more supporting facilities than the next door. The room is spacious, clean and bright, and the bedding is exquisite and high-grade. Looking across from the room's full-screen sea view window, Gulangyu Island is like a large-scale art bonsai.
The hotel has a steam room and a sauna, and I didn't have enough time to enjoy it. Still, I managed to find time to go for a swim in the sun-drenched indoor pool.
I didn't book breakfast at the hotel, mainly because I like to sleep in late and I can't catch up with breakfast time. However, the room can enjoy the service of ordering meals delivered by robots, which is very technological.
Ms. Clark Zhou at the front desk of Ruiyi Hotel was warm, friendly and thoughtful, which gave me a lot of points for my trip to Xiamen.
Like the climate of Xiamen, like this hotel. Must recommend to friends.

1. Among the service facilities listed by Ctrip when ordering, it is clearly written that there are "robot services and laundry, dry cleaning and other services", but when the service is finally needed, the robot meal delivery service can only deliver their own meals, laundry The service needs to be paid at your own expense, and you didn‚Äôt inform you that these services could not be enjoyed normally when you checked in. He kept saying that his hotel‚Äôs regulations and that some services on Ctrip did not mean that they were free.
2. Ctrip marked the hotel's requirement to check in at 15:00 and check out at 12:00 the next day, which does not meet the market standard of purchasing 24 hours a day.
3. Because of this kind of deception, I didn't stay for a day. I couldn't stand the deposit and left the hotel. The manager of the hotel, Lu, said these words, "Have you booked another hotel? As far as I know, many hotels can't deliver takeout, you It's better to book a place that can deliver food!" "Which hotel did you book?" "You can tell me where the hotel is, and if I know someone, I can help you ask"! I don't live in their hotel, and I am so kind to inquire about the privacy of the guests!
I have personally experienced the above events, and will continue to report to relevant depar**ents and accept the final result!

It is indeed a luxury hotel, very clean and comfortable to live in. It is very close to Zhongshan Road. It is very convenient to go shopping and eat. It takes only ten minutes to walk there. There is a site for nucleic acid next to it, but there are so many people! If you come next time, you will still choose here!

There is a smell in the room, and the air does not circulate that smell! The air conditioner is relatively loud at night, affecting sleep, so I didn't want to change rooms if I didn't want to toss!
Breakfast choices are less
The hotel is in a good location and a good view! You can take a photo with the entire Gulangyu Island by the window!

msg:First of all, the location is very good. Gulangyu Island is just opposite. It is very convenient to go to the major check-in places. During the epidemic, take-out cannot enter the lobby and can only be delivered to the take-out table at the entrance of the parking lot, but it is actually very close. Get off the elevator and turn right to go out. You can get it, the nucleic acid test point is also very close, and the Maternal and Child Health Hospital is at most 3 minutes away from the parking lot.
The attitude of the staff is very good. It is said on the Internet that you can only check in at 3 o'clock. We arrived at 12 o'clock, although the room was not cleaned, but they immediately helped us with the formalities. After leaving the luggage for lunch, we received a text message that the room was notified. Cleaned and ready to move in. Yaxuan, who received us, also called us to ask about our stay experience and introduce the hotel's facilities.
The only suggestion is that the bathroom can be used as a ventilation port, otherwise the clothes will not dry at all, and they will still be wet for two days.

msg:The biggest advantage of the hotel is the convenient location and the relatively large room size. However, some details still do not match the five-star rating. For example, the socket in the bathroom cannot carry the hair dryer, so it can only be used at the socket of the electric kettle. The most annoying thing is the scheduling logic of the elevator. During the peak period, the middle floor cannot go up at all. If you don't ride in the opposite direction, you won't be able to go down for half an hour. What's even more exasperating is that the fire door in the stairwell is closed, and it is impossible to go directly down the stairs. It is a great hazard for fire protection.
In addition, there is no delay in checking out until 2 o'clock, and it is required to return before 12 o'clock, which is too inhumane.

There was a long queue at the beginning of check-in, and there was always a long wait for the four elevators. It was very inconvenient to live on a high floor. The floor-to-ceiling windows in the house are all handprints, and the photos are not good-looking. It feels like the furnishing and cleanliness of the house and the holiday packages.

Facilities: The only thing that is flawed is the facilities. The facilities are relatively old, but this is also a common problem of old hotels. The air conditioner in the room feels that it can‚Äôt heat up. It happened to be a few days when it was relatively cold, so the room was not particularly warmü§ß

The reservation depar**ent said that the manager would contact me. I rushed home that day. I went to the hospital the next day, and the hospital told me that I had papular urticaria. Most of them were bitten by mites and mosquitoes! The girl in the reservation depar**ent can still contact me. Ask if my manager has contacted you. I said I asked on the same day but no! Not long after, the manager contacted me. It was all kinds of nonsense, and asked me to open a hospital certificate. What caused the prescription of allergens. This small problem is so complicated? Why didn't you ask me to issue a prescription before asking me to go to the hospital? Said that the mosquitoes on the beach in Xiamen are different from other places. Brother, I started to spend a few days in Xiamen. I felt a little itchy on my neck when I checked in at the last night. I found this on the way home the next day! After that phone call, it was like disappearing! Then I will write a review!

This time I booked a penthouse suite with a small garden on the rooftop platform, but the price was a bit expensive during the Spring Festival. The room key card I was given upon check-in could not open the door. Later, the manager on duty asked someone to fix it. The air conditioning temperature was too low. Fortunately, the hotel added an electric heater. The next day the sockets and bathroom lights in the house tripped again, and another call was made to find someone to fix it. Maybe it was because it was packed during the Spring Festival, but I felt that the service could not keep up, which was far from the professional service management of Swiss Hotel Management Group!

msg:Traveling in a hurry, hotels are all booked on the high-speed rail, thinking about booking one night to see how to transfer to another place. After staying for one night, I was very satisfied and stayed for two more nights. The location of the hotel is very good and the price is high. When you open the curtains, you can see Gulangyu across the sea. I do not want to leave the room when I watch the clouds during the day and the stars at night. Baby does not forget to do homework on vacation, but also thanks to this comfortable writing desk.
There are two points of dissatisfaction here:
1. The hotel's WIFI login is super complicated. Anyway, we didn't log in for 3 days. The password said it was the guest's last name. It is estimated that the hotel registration was wrong. I really don't think passwords need to be so complicated.
2. I don't know what "guarantee money" Ctrip got, which caused a lot of trouble and trouble between me and the hotel. Every time I renew Ctrip, I have to pay a fee to the counter and then pay the room fee. When I checked out, I thought the hotel would just refund the security deposit, but the amount was not correct. I was in a hurry to catch a flight, so I asked the hotel to print the bill to me. . When I came back, I spent half a day adjusting the records of Ctrip and the credit card, and then flipped through the text message again, only to realize the logic of Ctrip and the hotel üòÇ This matter also did not consider the problem from the customer's standpoint, which added a lot of trouble. A refund from Ctrip did not arrive until 8 hours after check out. This one is not right, so there is a misunderstanding üòÖ
Here I would like to commend Ellen (Xin Xin) at the front desk of Ruiyi Hotel. She explained to me patiently, sent the hotel records, explained that what Ctrip paid was just a guarantee and would be returned the same way, and finally resolved my doubts.

The front desk said that the room had been locked and asked us to pack our suitcases tomorrow, and then the room service would help us move our luggage to the new room. As a result, you have been tidying up for a long time, and the room is still the same room when you come back the next day. Seeing that there are as many people in the hall as a vegetable market, just think about it. A five-star hotel has never experienced such, without any service, the front desk is the big brother,

msg:I have stayed here many times on a business trip, and this time the experience was quite bad. First of all, when I checked in, I said that there was a government reception, and I had to check out at 12 o'clock tomorrow. Well, it was barely acceptable. But I had to go out at 9:00 the next morning. I was told that today the hotel is reserved, and I can't come in again after I leave the door, because the government has set up a security check machine, and only those who have a sign to attend the meeting can enter the hotel. I am still a hotel guest at this time. I can understand your request to check out at 12:00, but you only allow me to enter and exit the hotel once? I came on a business trip, not to sleep in the hotel. Do I have to check out when I go out in the morning? Then can I book an hourly room? ? ? I understand that you want to make money from the government, but it is too ugly to eat.

When I checked out, I found that the room price was temporarily adjusted. At the same time, the front desk even wrote a wrong number for the tax number of the invoice. Fortunately, I checked it, and the front desk did not admit the mistake, saying that Bayer's invoices are all this tax number. How is this possible?

Although I encountered some small problems, and encountered some small problems in the process of handling, fortunately I changed the way of dealing with it, at least the problem was solved satisfactorily. I personally feel that the way of dealing with the hotel management is not appropriate and should be handled flexibly. After all, the questions raised by customers are real.
In this process, Ctrip's processing is still very timely, so I always prefer Ctrip when traveling, and I can handle it with a more notary for customers when encountering problems.

msg:The third time I come to Xiamen, this hotel is a big surprise, and it has achieved the best ratio of five-star + room price + room area + location + landscape. The hotel is very close to Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street, a five-minute walk to a Starbucks. It only takes three minutes to walk from the Women's and Children's Hospital, and it is very convenient to do nucleic acid testing.

The sea view from the floor-to-ceiling windows is very beautiful. The room facilities are comfortable and user-friendly. The shampoo, conditioner and shower gel in the shower are fixed on the wall in order from the inside to the outside, which is convenient at hand. The hair dryer is not in the bathroom, but there is a special vanity table, the height and slope are very suitable. The luggage rack can be opened to two sides, just to put down the open box for easy access to items. Also, the tea bags in the room are delicious, especially Qingxin Oolong and Jasmine Maofeng. The tea I brought with me didn't move. I checked the Internet and found that the tea bags of this brand are 80 yuan for 12 bags, and the free drink in the room is 6 bags. In short, when the hardware of a five-star hotel is similar, these details are the most testable and the most authentic.

The fly in the oin**ent is that the toilet is not smart, it would be better if a smart cover could be added.

There is still one night after returning to the city from Gulangyu, and I plan to continue to stay at this hotel. It is highly recommended~

The location of the hotel is great, with the sea view room facing Gulangyu Island. On the second day of living here, I took some humanistic photos of people in Xiamen during the day when I was sweeping the street. I returned to the hotel tiredly. I was surprised to find that during the daytime cleaning, I prepared two sets of slippers according to my habit. Bathroom shoes. I put two extra bottles of mineral water next to the teapot (because I always don't drink water, I always drink mineral water or use it to make tea), and I put an extra set of toiletries in the place I usually use. The heartwarming thing is that the waitress left the content in the picture, sincere words, and no sense of routine. And when we haven‚Äôt even seen it in person or communicated through it, we were able to clean up the day before, and found that taking into account the habits of the residents, providing guests with unexpected services, the feeling in my heart is like returning home. .

Every bit after entering the house, I can feel her sincerity and the sense of serving others from the bottom of my heart. I have experienced a lot of cold and routine "service" in China, but this kind of authenticity and sincerity has been experienced in me. It is rare in the hotel.

As soon as I got off the car at the hotel entrance, the concierge took me to the front desk to check in after taking me to the front desk very politely. What I saw were people coming and going in the hotel and busy people. Later I heard that there are more than 500 rooms. Rooms. It is worth mentioning that the service of this hotel is really good! The service ambassador Chang gave a detailed introduction to the hotel‚Äôs regional divisions, such as the characteristic Thai restaurant, the century-old South Fujian restaurant, the banquet hall, etc. He also took me to visit the fitness center and the very beautiful executive lounge. His service made people feel Sincere and not perfunctory, very meticulous. This time I came to Xiamen in a hurry. If I come again next time, I must live in an executive room. Will I have a better experience of their administrative courtesy? Am looking forward to!

1. Check in at 14:00 in other hotels, check in at 15:00 in this hotel, 3 manual services have been busy, I checked in at the self-service machine, and the lobby assistant said that the room card can be obtained after the mobile phone SMS notification. But there was no news until 15:20, and I went to the service desk to exchange for another room that had been cleaned up. At that time, there were 5 other people who checked with me at the service desk for the same reason, and they were worse than other hotels since check-in.
2. There are paid goods on the bed, bar and bathtub in the house. Can't they be put on the bar? Do you want to put it everywhere like this for fear that the customer will not see it? No wonder it takes so much time to clean up the room.
3. Why is the laundry bag placed under the TV?

The hotel room was good and the space was very large, the bed was big enough, and there was a dressing table for the girl. It‚Äôs too friendly for us, but the hotel needs money for everything, such as a mini bar, small toys, bubble bath, mineral water, and there are consumer goods everywhere in the hotel, which seems a bit petty. There are many takeaways around the hotel, but you need to go to the takeaway counter on the first floor to get the takeaway.

The hotel just called to tell you not to open the curtains. I didn‚Äôt say anything, I‚Äôm so sorry that the Gulangyu Seaview Room I booked at a high price became a windowless room. It is recommended not to visit Xiamen in summer, not to mention the hot weather, construction is everywhere on Gulangyu, Lujiang water is muddy and smelly, Zhongshan Road Pedestrian Street is also under construction, Zhongshan Road sells souvenirs, and has no special features. If you have to come to Xiamen, it is recommended to go out and make a taxi appoin**ent on the online platform. Never take a taxi. The black-hearted taxi driver will fool you. If you want to go to the pier and take a boat, he will send you to the black travel agency, saying that it is a tourist gathering and dispersing. center.

The room booked this time can see Gulangyu Island, and you can enjoy the different scenery during the day and night without going out. The room is relatively spacious. I brought a family this time. The bed in the double room is quite big, so there is no pressure to sleep with children. One of the rooms in this trip has also been upgraded and replaced with a suite, which is especially suitable for a family trip. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is quite plentiful. There are not many people in the gym and swimming pool. It feels good. You can run and exercise on Gulangyu Island. The only doubt is that the children's playground in the hotel actually needs to be charged.

And the security guards in the parking lot have not been trained to chaotically command, and the entrances and exits are not clearly distinguished. And the security manager called for a long time and didn't come out, so I waited for a long time and charged me with arbitrary charges. What's even worse is that I didn't even have a word of sorry, and it was simply unlucky to stay in that hotel.
