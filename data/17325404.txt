msg:We booked their super ocean view room, great view and nice beach scenery. I loved the whole room decorations, it looked fantastic however it felt as though I was still on the deluxe room with how the service was. Felt like we only paid just for the view. For starters, the room wasn’t cleaned when we left, we had to call and ask them to come clean it and the cleaner did a very sloppy job. She didn’t wipe the place well and left it wet. The bed wasn’t even made. I was disappointed to say the least, I’ve booked at other great hotels with 5 stars and the services were amazing so what we received really was saddening. Would I book there again? No

Disadvantages: The window is a construction site, and you can see the sea. Although the sound insulation is good, it affects the view. Moreover, the air conditioner is on the balcony. As long as the air conditioner is turned on, the balcony will be filled with hot air, and it is impossible to stay on the balcony. In addition, the hotel's plastic slippers are boat-shaped and do not drain water. When taking a bath or going to the sea, you will scoop up a shoe full of water or sand

The restaurant on the fourth floor of the hotel has delicious dishes, a warm environment, a rich variety of Chinese and Western food, and great value for money. Not only does it have Hainan's local signature dishes such as coconut chicken, but also Hong Kong-style morning tea and a Western kitchen buffet breakfast with hundreds of dishes to choose from (I stayed in a room with breakfast, so the buffet breakfast with hundreds of dishes is free [happy]).

The housekeeper is also very professional and answered our questions patiently. He will ask where there is any need for improvement or service every day. For the set meal we ordered, drinks and snacks were replenished in a timely manner, and the daily fruits were particularly fresh. Knowing that the birthday check-in is also decorated and 🍰, it is full of ceremony. And we were very satisfied with the service we needed in a timely manner_ _. The cleaning staff were also very hardworking and respectful, giving our family a great experience. The effect of travel photography is also great! ! ! Will be the first choice next time

msg:The hotel upgraded the room for free. The apar**ent-style room is very spacious, equipped with a kitchen, and is also considerately equipped with enough hangers and trouser racks, as well as a large balcony and a washing machine. Standing on the balcony, you can see the Coconut Dream Corridor and the sea view. The breakfast is also very rich and cost-effective. The only drawback is that the noise is a bit loud due to municipal construction, but it is okay after closing the balcony door. There is a slight construction sound, which does not affect the sleep of children who are tired of playing. It is worth mentioning that the Coconut Dream Corridor and Haiyue Square, which are across the road from the hotel, are very lively every night, with all kinds of music and dance, disco, square dance, duo, singing various popular songs, red songs, and multi-person bands, etc., one after another, which is much louder than the noise of municipal construction, haha, but such noise ends around 9-10 o'clock. The hotel is also very close to the supermarket, about 300 meters on foot. Overall, I am quite satisfied.

The construction site downstairs is working during the day, but have you heard of the construction that starts after 10 o'clock in the evening and continues until dawn? The morning is seamlessly connected with the square dance and various aunt choirs on the beach. The doors and windows have no sound insulation effect at all. The sound of washing machines in other rooms and the whistling of cars passing by... The facilities are simple, the shower head is dripping, and the service staff are very impatient.

msg:Worst stay ever.
1. When checking in, we were told that different room types could not be arranged on the first floor, so we were given room cards and coupons without any instructions on how to use them. 2. When entering the room, the waiter said that the previous guest had spilled the conch powder, so we kept the door open for a long time and then went out to the beach. 3. When I went to bed, I found a used double eyelid patch. It was very disgusting. I called the hotel and said I didn’t know who it belonged to. The manager came and changed the room. Since it was late at night and I was traveling with an old man, I would have to stay there tonight. We couldn't live in it, so they moved us to a room on the same floor as the previous room. The old man was very upset. 4. The mattress squeaked as soon as I sat on the bed, and I didn't dare to move it for fear of waking up the old man. The pillows were also torn. 5. It is very inconsistent with the name of a five-star hotel. There is no bathtub and the hygiene is very poor. You can look at the carpets in the parent-child room. Do you dare to let children stay there? 6. We went out the next morning and pressed the Do Not Disturb button. When we came back, we found that the door was open and the cleaning lady was inside. I asked: Didn’t I write Do Not Disturb? The cleaning staff said: "You took away the room card and it can't be displayed. I thought it was cleaned after check-out! Then I don't take the room card with me when I go out? Just give me one room card for each room. It's so speechless." .
Overall feeling: I feel like the hotel is unmanaged and chaotic. With more than 800 rooms per room, I wouldn't be so angry if there is any aspect that is good. The only good thing about the hotel is that it is close to the seaside and has a night market. I really don’t want to give points.

The blind box sea view room I booked was directly upgraded to the supreme sea view room. The room is super large. It is the largest room I have stayed in so far on a business trip. The room has complete facilities (it is modern). There is not enough sense of technology and it is a little bit old). There is also Starbucks coffee inside the hotel. The buffet breakfast is also full of varieties and tastes very good. The location is also good, directly by the seaside, with a long coastline right outside the door, and not far from scenic spots such as Phoenix Island, Luhuitou, and the East China Sea.

1. The in-room service wired phone lines are not accessible. When calling the front desk, main desk, or housekeeping center, they all say "the number you dialed is empty", resulting in insufficient service. I reported it to the front desk and it was fixed quickly, and they even gave me fruit to apologize.
2. The power sockets are not easy to use. You have to constantly adjust the position to plug in to get power.
3. The wet quilt smelled very strong, and the waiter said it was like this in Hainan.
4. The table lamp does not light up, and one side of the bedside lamp does not light up.

But there are many things in the room with clearly marked prices, such as disposable bath towels and mineral water, which I personally feel is not very good. Not worth the money, either leave the room alone or give it away for free.

msg:I really feel that this hotel is very average, even a relatively poor experience. When the receptionist handles the needs of our guests, the process is rigid and impersonal, even a little strong, and then when we have breakfast in the morning , I have informed the waiter that the milk is gone, and asked the waiter to continue to provide it. After getting the answer from the waiter, it was a long wait without any results.

Let’s talk about the room we stayed in. Although the overall feeling of the room is not bad, there is an external air conditioner on the wall of the balcony. We live in a sea view room but cannot enjoy the view from the balcony. The entire balcony is covered by the hot air from the external air conditioner. , the heat was so hot that it was unbearable to stand let alone sit. Downstairs is a large construction site, and sometimes construction noise can be heard at night, and the construction site starts very early in the morning and the construction noise is serious.

The hotel facilities also happened to be faulty. The swimming pool was repaired on the day we checked in, and it was still under repair until we checked out five days later. The plan to swim in the hotel also came to naught, and the hotel's ice machine was also coincidentally in place There was a breakdown after we checked in and wanted the hotel to provide some ice and was told the ice machine was broken and couldn't provide it!

To sum up, as a hotel, the hardware facilities and software services can’t keep up, so how was it rated as an Internet celebrity?

Hygiene: The overall hygiene is quite good. The room is clean and tidy, spacious and bright, and the bedding is also clean and comfortable.
Environment: The location of the hotel is superior, across the road is the seaside, the seaside in Sanya Bay is really lively at night, because there is Haiyue Square next to it, many people sing and dance here at night! It's quite comfortable to go for a walk around the beach at night and enjoy the sea breeze. This time the hotel has changed a lot, as shown in the picture below, and a new supermarket and Starbucks have opened! It's getting more and more beautiful! The surrounding environment is being upgraded and remodeled, and it will definitely get better and better in the near future! 👍👍👍
Service: Patience and thoughtful service must be given full marks. You may have arrived earlier and the room has not been cleaned yet. The receptionist at the front desk is very enthusiastic. Everyone will take the initiative to say hello and greetings, especially the manager Ziwei arranged for us to adjust the room in time. How long will it take to move in smoothly! The luggage man will also warmly help us with the luggage and send us to the room and introduce the hotel facilities and equipment. This trip is very good and very happy. I will choose Locke Platinum every time I come here, and of course I will recommend it to my friends! This hotel is relatively new compared to the surrounding area, and the price/performance ratio is also very high! The time for this trip is a bit rushed and I haven't had time to experience more and better services in the hotel. Next time I have the opportunity to stay for a few more days. Friends who plan to travel to Sanya during the summer, just go! Value for money, highly recommended! We will continue to support you in the future! I will choose this place again next time. I wish the Rock Platinum Hotel a prosperous business and better and better!

After listening to the driver's recommendation, I booked Locke Platinum. The result was a pleasant surprise. The location of the hotel is very good. The downstairs is the Coconut Dream Corridor Binhai Avenue. It is very convenient to go for a walk in the morning and evening. The business district downstairs is also very mature. Shopping and eating are very convenient.
        And compared to many traditional five-star resort hotels in Sanya, although there is no outdoor garden swimming pool and other facilities here, the room decoration is still very new and the cleaning is also very clean. The most important thing is that some of the old star-rated resort hotels in Sanya have flaws that are built by the hotel. The floors are not very high, and the rooms on the lower floors will be relatively humid, and there will inevitably be some musty smells, which are completely absent in this hotel.
        Finally, I want to focus on some hotel services, which are very good! The staff are very enthusiastic, and Xiaoya at the front desk gave the room a free upgrade when she checked in! Like it!

Environment: The environment is good. After all, the higher the price, the better the environment. My room type has a good view of the sea. This depends on your actual choice.
Service: The little brother (He Zeneng) at the door is nice and enthusiastic, helping with luggage and so on.

This time I was really disappointed. The parent-child room I stayed in with my children had a musty smell. It was a very, very serious musty smell. The waiters were also very perfunctory in cleaning. The waiters in the restaurant were also clueless because they had children. I asked the waiter to help me get a glass of cold water. I was told that there was no cold water. I asked the waiter to get a bag of sugar and asked me to get it myself! I really can't figure out why the service quality has declined so quickly!

msg:Because Chinese New Year is in Sanya every year. I stayed in this hotel for 3 days this year. The 13th floor was arranged on the first day. It was already early in the morning when I went there. There were not many rooms left. Because the air conditioner was too noisy and there was no washing machine, the children changed their clothes frequently. I told the hotel two days later that they specially reserved a high-rise room for me to look at, and then changed it directly. If you live outside for a long time, you must have a washing machine, otherwise it will be really troublesome. Some hotel staff came to pay New Year's greetings with a fruit plate and Want Want snacks. This made me feel very satisfied. I took the guests into consideration. The hotel is right next to the beach, just across the road. The children play at the beach every day. super happy. This is the Coconut Dream Corridor, so the environment is really good, it is more convenient than living in Haitang Bay before, and there is a large supermarket within a few minutes of walking. And the transportation is very convenient to go out, and there are a lot of food. Although it is Chinese New Year, most restaurants are open. There is a little brother at the front desk who is very nice. Every time he goes back and forth, he will ask where to go, and he will also give you directions and tell you how to get there. There is an infinity swimming pool in his house. Since we went too late, it closed at 10 pm, so we must go next time. The room type is very large. The 2 rooms I live in are indeed the size they said. Children can have fun in it. Each room has a 90° view of the sea. It is also very convenient to dry. The balcony is very large. I will stay here again next year. Really good, perfect hotel

The bad thing is that there is construction on the land downstairs, and there is noise at night and in the morning. If you are a light sleeper, I don't recommend it. It feels like the downstairs The construction project will continue for a long time.

The breakfast in the hotel is also good, with a lot of Chinese and Western varieties. When checking in, considering the needs of shooting, the girl surnamed Chen Xiaowei at the front desk and the young man Xiao Zeng helped upgrade the room with a more suitable perspective. I would like to express my gratitude! In addition, Xiao Fu at the front desk is also very enthusiastic to help with the check-out procedures. He is efficient and professional, and he should also be praised. Ms. Lin, the health inspection supervisor of the hotel's guest room depar**ent, is very serious, responsible and meticulous in her work, which is worthy of praise. All in all, I was very happy during my stay and had a good impression. I will come again next time.

Later, I ordered the takeaway and called the hotel to ask for a plate. The hotel had to go to the restaurant on the 4th floor to get the plate. With a knife and fork, the red wine glass can be brought by the hotel. The service is ok. It is good to send me a plate. It is better to choose a small number for the sea view room, and the sea view will be larger. I stayed in a 2310-bed room for one day. The front desk said that the sea view is better and can be changed to a double bed. Overall, it is not bad and clean. It is very cost-effective to book a suite on the hotel public account. Going downstairs and crossing the road is the beach. The hotel has a sea play package. Buy it, the receptionist at the door said that there are more than 300 packages of pick-up and drop-off, choose it yourself, it is not bad, the service will be better if you upgrade it

🚗 Transportation: The location of Sanya Bay is very convenient. The hotel is just across the road from the beach. It is very pleasant to take your love to the beach after dinner. There is a large supermarket nearby, and there is a commercial street for one day. In the morning, you have everything you want to eat, and in the evening you can drink a beer
🧹Hygienic: The whole is very clean. Now during the epidemic, there are disinfecting alcohol and paper towels in the elevator room, which are disinfected every day. All staff wear masks without exception.
🍃Environment: The overall hotel building looks like "tall" from the outside, but the front desk in the lobby looks much inferior. Of course my opinion is purely personal...
🔔Service: "Xiao Wei", the receptionist at the front desk, is warm and attentive, and brings fresh and delicious fruit plates from time to time. The most romantic thing is this beautiful bouquet of roses.
The most commendable is "Wang Hong", the waiter who cleaned the room for us. He was serious and responsible for his work and was very attentive. You especially liked the swan shape you made with bath towels for our husband and wife. Your smile and your indifferent answer at work also left a deep impression on our husband and wife. Praise for your ultimate service!

The two young ladies at the front desk, the little bell and Xiao Wei, have a very warm service, and the welcome and security staff at the door and the little brother at the front desk the day before are super nice...Go out to the beach to meet the fun of children playing in the sand at any time. The hotel also sent a lot Playing with sand tools...it’s really a must to stay with children...if there is an electric car rental in the hotel, it will be perfect again next time you come to Sanya...

msg:Very very poor experience.
Let me talk about hygiene first. I was scheduled for two nights. I woke up on the first night. Allergies began to appear on the entire back of the child and adults. The whole body was covered with a dense and terrible rash. It is hard to imagine how unhygienic the bedding is. The hotel requested to check out that night, but the hotel said that after the check-out time, only half of the refund was required, and there was no way to continue the check-in. As a result, the child's allergies became worse the next day, and allergies began to appear on his hands, legs, and even his face. Dr. Wang from the Depar**ent of Dermatology, Sanya People’s Hospital said it was caused by contact, and at the same time said it was a current reaction, that is, an allergy caused by immediate contact. As a result, there was no vacation a**osphere in the last two days in Sanya. Because of the hot weather, the children and adults are suffering together, and when they go to the hospital, the hotel is not accompanied by staff, and there are no vehicles connected to them. Not to mention the medical expenses. All of them are solved by us. Really The experience is extremely poor.
Secondly, the facilities and equipment. The pillows are high and hard, about 20 to 30 centimeters. If the child can’t sleep, it’s okay for the child to sleep. Both adults feel stiff.
The door of the closet is broken, the washbasin is leaking serious, the water is leaking from the top, and the bottom is leaking, the floor leaks wet at first, and it can slip.
Breakfast has to be added to the room rate for an additional 160 a day. The food is very poor, and the quality is only 16 yuan.
I have never stayed in such a bad hotel. Poor sanitation is the most unbearable. Express hotels will not have such sanitary quality. Anyway, they will defend their rights to the end.

I contacted the front office manager Amy in advance and arranged a designated room for us according to our requirements. At the same time, I was pleasantly surprised that I made room decoration and fruits for us. It felt like going home. It was very warm. I recommend Rock Platinum, and I will come to stay when I have the opportunity.

The actual feeling is really good. Great! Since we are two girls, considering the safety issue, we communicated with the hotel about the location of the room, and the front desk was also very patient to help us. Let us look at the room before checking in, which is really humane. We are residents who live continuously, and the daily cleaning is very good and very clean. This hotel is very close to the supermarket and Tuanjie Road (food). It is also very convenient to go to the scenic spots. You can take a bus to Haiyue Square at the door. It's really a very good experience! It is worth recommending to everyone!

There is no partition between the bathroom and the room and there is no privacy. Although it is a sea view, it is a construction site on the opposite side, which can only be said to be a half sea view. In general, the hardware is dragging down the software, giving it 4 stars

Because there is a construction site next to the hotel, if you have a small partner who minds, don't choose it. Maybe because of the urban area, every inch of land is worth a lot of money, the hotel swimming pool is relatively small, facing the sea, the scenery is still good.

However, the hotel's sanitation is average, and the construction is going downstairs, and the noise has a certain impact. After a while, the construction will be completed and there will be no problems.
There is an uncomfortable place. The swimming ring in the hotel pool is actually rented. To be honest, I don't understand it. It's a six-700-one night hotel.
By the way, breakfast in the hotel is still possible, like yogurt.

msg:第一點，房間衞生收拾不乾淨，第一天入住陽台上都是水，保潔説是刷陽台；
第二點，一年跑全國各地無數次，第一次碰到酒店礦泉水每天衹給兩小瓶的，九月份來的時候住大東海水都是隨便喝的；
第三點，第一天入住去免税店回來之後發現沒熱水，問前台説市政施工挖壞了，半小時後能來，半小時之後問還是告訴我半小時後能來，完全就是應付的態度。
第四點，隔音不好，樓道里説話都能聽見。
唯一一點，早餐不錯。

首先很潮濕，衞生間的三分離，其中洗面台在床邊兩米處，無隔斷無遮擋。地上潮濕得很，全是水。注意不是洗面台使用時潑出的。馬桶間的地上也是水。
其次游泳池居然要泳帽，還美其名曰是批發的十元，真是謝謝了。所有平台都木有此項提醒。一個屁大點的泳池就是加上燈光和網紅，成了打卡地，我也是謝謝你。
另外最近就更不要住這家，陽台是能看到海景，但更糟糕的是旁邊正在挖大坑，修新樓，又臟又吵。

msg:標準的城市酒店，有泳池，外邊看起來很新，附近在建樓施工，風景很差，不宜開窗。
房間裏部分看起來還是比較舊。衣櫃極其簡陋，電視櫃沒有，直接就是個方桌代替。有開放式廚房，但是沒通電，有滑門可以隔開卧式，這點很不錯。
衞生間水特別小，簡直離譜，洗澡特別痛苦，而且馬桶和淋浴之間的玻璃，幾乎透明，有點尷尬，但是馬桶特別不錯，很大很舒服。
早餐很不錯，現磨豆漿和咖啡特別好評，種類還算豐富，體驗特別好。因為早餐不錯，就特別嘗試了週末的自助晚餐，東西不算特別多，但是都很精緻好吃，有生蠔但是工作人員不積極，經常拿不到生蠔，同樣還有生魚片，味道也很好吃，但是工作人員經常離開操作間，導致沒法領取食物，這點特別令人噁心，自助就要有自助的空間，玩不起不要搞自助，要不然令人很反感。
服務人員基本上特別熱情，服務特別好，相比以前來三亞，簡直是天壤之別，讓人終於能感受到令人愉悦的服務質量，唯一不好的就衹有早餐和晚餐門口櫃枱的服務員，服務態度太差了

衞生一般 我住的陽台上 有一個黑色塑料袋 屋裡還有一個糖紙還是什麼的 透明的  房間挺寬敞的
但是有一衹蟲子 衹在那睡了四五個小時吧 被咬了好幾個小紅點 癢癢的
陽台寫了 及時關門 以免蚊蟲飛入 但是 我入住時候 陽台門是開的  
最後想説的是 酒店下單了 就不允許取消 下單後才告知 下午3點以後才能入住 因為房間打掃不完 
我想早點入住 打電話前台説不行。我説那就退了吧  經理還不同意 最後攜程協商了 説儘量讓我早入住。我應該是12點來鍾去的 就住進去了 
我覺得不能退這個條款特別不合理 
但房間 位置 景色都還行

Пиво и их водка безлимит. Через дорогу пляж. Однако купаться там не рекомендую. Вода грязная и вонючая. Сразу даже разочаровались. Но на следующий день поехали на дадунхай пляж. Автобус 8 напротив отеля. 2 юаня с человека и 15-20 мин езды. Пляж и вода супер не хуже таиланда. Однако гоняют охранники если заплываешь за буйки. Но лайфхакер: плывете вглубь до конца и тогда можно вдоль пляжа в сторону мариота плыть. Они не ругаютс так как знают что их уже не слышно. Минус отеля- стройка, которая работает и шумит круглосуточно. Бронируйте повыше этажи.

第一天服務的小哥和禮賓部的小哥人很nice，酒店離海確實很近，兩顆星也就衹能給這倆理由了。
攜程也請審核一下自己簽約的酒店。

🍃環境：訂房的時候特別要求住高層，前台給辦了 21層，海景很美，視野開闊。
🔔服務：所有服務人員都很熱情，前台小姐姐很温柔，行李員小哥哥很熱情，出門會幫忙叫車，客房服務員李國強好像是這個名字，還給擺了床上的大象，撒了花瓣，謝謝！
性價比很高的一家酒店，下次還會入住，嘗試別的房型！

msg:入住第一天，感覺不錯，就繼續繼住，入住第一天灑店下午還送了水果，然第二就遲遲未送，打了幾次電話問前台，一會説馬上送，一會又説等餐廳準備好水果再送，然而到了晚上八點半還沒送，我就再次打電話，前台服務人員又説等到九點多，我就納悶了不就一份水果嗎？這樣一件小事情都沒做好，我生氣的是我不一定要求你們送這份水果，而是前台工作人員這樣辦事服務態度真是有些差勁。後來我生氣了説要打電話投訴，這時大堂副理小敏才把水果送上來，還請示值班經理送了我們倆份早點，還有大堂阿權的服務也很到位，在此特別感謝小敏和阿權。是他們熱情細心的服務讓我們感到很温馨，果斷的又繼住兩晚！
