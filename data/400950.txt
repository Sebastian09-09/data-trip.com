msg:This Hotel is very nice and located in the Center, close to the Railway station and many POI. The staff is friendly and tries to support the guests. The English language skills could be improved.
Unfortunately the Hotel and the rooms definitely need an extensive renovation. In our room several electric plug-sockets had been damaged, which is a severe danger. Also the control-units for the AC showed marks of overheating and damages.   
The interior of the rooms and bathroom showed marks of abrasion and cheap repairs. 
With this actions this Hotel could be one of the best in Dalian.

Odd.
The staff were kind and offered apologies, they also offered complimentary room service (though it was that hot I wouldn't want to stay in there) and an upgrade, but no rooms had working cold AC. Though I appreciated their kind and apologetic attitude. Especially Roger Wang, the chief concierge. He was extremely professional and offered to help with any further problems.

msg:I can safely say Intercontinental is one of the best hotels in Dalian after having stayed in many Dalian hotels. For starters we got a room upgrade and early check in and late check out. The hotel also gave us complimentary coffee and fruit soon after checking in. The room was clean, comfortable, modern and had a gorgeous city view. The amenities were satisfactory and their Breakfast buffet had a wide range of Western and Chinese cuisine  to choose from. Special thanks to Jason from the fitness centre and Winnie and Kevin from the front desk for their excellent service they especially made sure our stay was enjoyable. The only downside is that I think the Chinese restaurant staff could use some training the service there was the least professional but in my opinion it didn't takeaway from the overall experience.

Finally, after the enthusiastic introduction of Iris from the reservation depar**ent, I decisively booked the InterContinental Executive Building. The hygiene of the room and the meals were very good. The only shortcoming was that there was no air conditioning. It was very hot and stuffy. I hope the hotel can flexibly arrange air conditioning facilities in this season. In addition, Miss Cherry Xing in the executive lounge is a very cute girl from Northeast China. My baby likes her very much. She is enthusiastic and cheerful. She gave the baby a polar bear 🐻❄️. She can arrange for our whole family to sit together every time. She can take care of my parents' feelings and likes it very much ☺️. It's very good. I hope I will have the opportunity to see the sea in Dalian next time and stay at InterContinental again

The children had so much fun that they said they didn't want to leave and wanted to stay for two more nights. In short, I was very satisfied. If I had to say there was a shortcoming, it was that the air-conditioning outlet of the apar**ent I lived in happened to be facing one of the beds, and the cold wind was a bit unbearable. It would be more humane if a wind shield could be installed on the outlet. There is also a self-service Dalian travel guide at the front desk, which is very practical for foreign tourists. I remember that there seemed to be three lists but only two were taken. Other guests are welcome to add

msg:InterContinental Hotel is OK, hygiene, service, breakfast are all OK, and the snacks in the executive lounge are also delicious! It's just that the road in front of the door is one-way, and you have to go around every time, which always feels weird! In addition, there is a Dalian snack street on Kunming Street next to it, and there is a Xinjuyuan seafood restaurant inside. Two small crabs are nearly 2 kilograms, which is ridiculous. Not to mention the deception, I guess the seafood they took out has been replaced, not fresh! I felt uncomfortable in my stomach the next day after eating it, and I wanted to vomit and had a stomachache. I lay down for a day!

msg:A few days of travel in Dalian
I have been staying at the InterContinental Hotel next to Zhongshan Square
The location is very convenient, it is close to everything, and taxis are almost available at any time
When checking in, Ms. Grace enthusiastically helped me upgrade to a more comfortable room based on my IHG level. The window view is simply beautiful.
Make a cup of coffee and watch the window view from sunrise to dusk
Mr. Sun Yong from the concierge depar**ent is a very good helper
Where to go and what delicious shops nearby are popular with locals can be recommended
Every day, the buffet breakfast and buffet dinner are eaten at the Lilac Cafe
The quality of the dishes is 5-star standard, with a wide variety. We stayed for 4 days and may have tasted only 1/3G of the buffet. It was mainly because we had eaten what we liked and were basically full
The last time we had breakfast, the floor manager Wang Peixuan left us a very good impression
Three days is really short. Next time I come to Dalian, I will definitely come back to stay for a few days

The concierge has a young lady and two tall and handsome men who helped to carry the luggage to the room and helped to take the suitcase down when leaving the hotel.
It is convenient for me to bring my baby.

Hygiene: Although the five-star hotel is a bit old, it is well maintained.
The bathroom is great!
The sea view on the high floor is also good👍

Environment: The location is very good. Downstairs is the Friendship Square, and next to it is the Zhongshan Square with many pigeons. There is a morning market and a food street nearby, which are all within walking distance. It is very convenient for me to bring my baby. It is not far to go anywhere.

It is an ideal place for my trip to Dalian. Among them, the hotel's deluxe king room surprised me again and again, and the experience was extraordinary.

The hotel's location is really amazing. Located in the prime location of the city center, it is extremely convenient to go to the business district, scenic area or transportation hub. The hotel is within walking distance of many popular attractions, and the surrounding shopping malls and restaurants also add a lot of color to my trip. Such a geographical location allows me to easily explore every corner of Dalian while enjoying the comfortable environment of the hotel.

Of course, the deluxe king room is one of the highlights of this trip. The room is spacious and bright, full of luxury and comfort, and the bathroom is very large! Soft beds and high-quality bedding. In addition, the facilities in the room are all available, from HD TVs to smart speakers, showing the meticulousness and thoughtfulness of InterContinental Hotels.

During this trip, I would also like to thank Serena at the front desk, Austin at the concierge, and Xiaolan at the housekeeping depar**ent. Serena was warm and thoughtful, providing me with detailed check-in instructions and travel suggestions; Austin was professional and meticulous, helping me solve multiple problems during my trip; Xiaolan provided good service and handled late check-out for us. Their services made me feel the quality and level of InterContinental Hotels, and left me with a deep impression of InterContinental Hotel Dalian.

It was my first time staying at Dalian COSCO InterContinental Hotel. Although there were twists and turns, the various services of the hotel staff made me feel the heritage of an old five-star hotel.
The careful explanation of Cindy and Rena at the front desk for check-in and extension; the greetings from Austin at the concierge every time we met; the hot mushroom soup from Leng Zhonglin of the food and beverage depar**ent when he returned to the store in the evening, and the busyness of Yang Yuqin, the sister on the floor, thank you all for your efforts.
Thanks to Happy, the manager of the food and beverage depar**ent, and the MOD on duty. When Happy provided the check-in courtesy, he learned that there was a hardware problem in the room and reported it to the hotel as soon as possible. The MOD on duty personally coordinated and communicated with me and solved it perfectly.
The service of InterContinental Hotel allowed me to change my itinerary, cancel the plan to check in at a hotel near Xinghai, and continue to choose to extend my stay. I give you a thumbs up!

Breakfast is another highlight every day. The hotel provides a wide variety of breakfasts, from fresh fruits to local specialties. The staff are also very friendly and helpful, especially Liu Qiang from the concierge depar**ent, who enthusiastically gave us a hand-drawn map. I will come again next time if I have the chance.

Secondly, a place to put mobile phones can be installed next to the toilet, otherwise it would be a bit inconvenient. The overall service is good. When we checked out, Austin, the concierge, also gave us two bottles of water very considerately, which happened to be used by us on the high-speed rail. Thank him.

I returned to the parking lot again. B3 was full, but there were many cones occupying parking spaces. The front desk asked me to park in B4, but there was no elevator, so I had to find the stairs to climb up. When checking out, the concierge said that he could help move the luggage to B4, but he was obviously not happy, and he took a detour on the way. Alas! Is the training of a good hotel not in place?

msg:The package is very cost-effective, 999 for two rooms including breakfast, and two days of executive lounge access, where you can have afternoon tea and light meals in the evening. I stayed with my son for two days during the Spring Festival and didn't worry about food.
During the Spring Festival, the rooms were basically full. The handsome guy ALLEN at the front desk was warm and kind and helped us upgrade to a junior suite.
The room facilities are a bit old, but they are well maintained. It is estimated that no one lives there. The musty smell is relatively strong. The air conditioner is too hot. No matter how you adjust it, it always reaches 30 degrees. It is so hot that we all sweat!
In terms of food, compared to a five-star hotel, breakfast does not have many varieties, only about half of other five-star hotels, and the restaurant is not big. You have to queue for fifteen to twenty minutes every day to get a seat for breakfast! I met a family from Guangzhou and everyone felt that the breakfast at this Intercontinental restaurant was average! But the service of the service staff is still very good and very enthusiastic!
Overall, the staying experience was very good. The hotel also has a large swimming pool. Because it was winter, we were afraid that the water would get cold, so we didn't go swimming! If you have a chance in the future, come and experience it again!

The room is clean and comfortable, with two large beds measuring 1.45 meters. It was almost 11pm when we checked in that day. The waiter quickly added an extra bed and placed children's toiletries. It is especially friendly for families traveling with children. Special praise for Brynn at the front desk, who is enthusiastic, generous and efficient! The hotel also sent welcome fruits and chicken soup. I will choose here next time.

You can see the sea in the distance. On the 46th floor, you can have breakfast and afternoon tea with executive courtesy. Cherry is very enthusiastic to help the children with cakes and juice. There is also an executive lounge and dinner which is simple but good. Enough, we only had lunch by ourselves during the entire trip and the rest was included in the administrative price. Cherry also gave small gifts to the children, and Mayra at the front desk was also very gentle and would help contact her if she had any questions. It was a great stay, highly recommended! ! !

The executive room is on the 40th floor, and you can enjoy executive benefits. There are afternoon tea, light dinners, etc. on the 46th floor. The breakfast buffet is on the sixth floor, with a rich variety. There are also free cocktails in the evening.

Located in the center of the city, the scenery outside the window is particularly good, and you can also see the sea.

The bathroom is new and spacious, with a bathtub and good facilities. In comparison, although the carpet in the house is old, it didn't feel smelly when I lived in it.

The hotel is too old, has a smell, the facilities are average, and the front desk service awareness is also very average. They don't think about solving problems for guests. The view of the executive floor depends on the room. I heard that some customers I complained that not every room has a good view. There is a children's play area, which is basically sufficient. In addition, the minibar in the room on the executive floor does not contain any soft drinks, and the refrigerator is empty! The executive lounge has a nice view, but check-in and check-out are not allowed. Another interesting point is that generally guests cannot use the executive benefits after check-out, but on the day of their check-out, no matter whether they have checked out or not, they cannot You can use the executive lounge, so if you want to have afternoon tea and check out of the room, there is basically no chance, because your rights will be gone on the same day! I don’t know if this is a characteristic of InterContinental or theirs? ?

How to put it this way, the location of the hotel is good, but the front desk is really unable to complain, and the processing speed is too slow. Then because I checked into the room at 1:30, I was told that the room was not cleaned well, so I just came to get the room card later. When I arrived at the hotel in the evening, I was told that I had to queue up again to get the room card. It was really...
But the service of the housekeeping depar**ent is good. They are very active in showing rooms, sending luggage, and helping with luggage.
I booked a smart bed room, and the bedside and bed can be adjusted, but the hotel is old and the room always feels smelly.

The advantage of the hotel is its excellent location. It is very close to the Line 2 subway and a 10-minute walk from Dalian Station. There are many places to eat around. It is not far from Zhongyuan Street Night Market and Qingniwa Commercial Street. The hotel is very suitable for bringing children. There is a children's club in the restaurant on the 6th floor and an indoor swimming pool on the 7th floor. We were also given a children's buffet breakfast and some supplies suitable for children. Finally, I would like to thank all the staff who served us during the National Day holiday. Although there were too many diners at breakfast and we had to wait at the door, we could feel that the staff were thinking of ways to serve everyone. grateful.

I just hope that the hotel can put more effort into maintenance and not live up to the InterContinental name.
But it will still be my first choice because I stay here for a few days every time I come back and I am used to it.

msg:The second time I checked in, the room facilities were still amazing. The front desk service is particularly good. Special thanks to Allen, the duty manager, for his meticulous and thoughtful service. The smell of byredo is still the same. This one from Intercontinental smells really good! There are elderly people in the family who are traveling and arranged a room with buckwheat pillows and hard beds. Although the hotel is a bit old, it is overall very good! The supplies used in the room are still of high quality. The thickness of the slippers, the nail file and other details are definitely beyond the brand level. It’s really amazing that the bathrooms in the gym and public areas use byredo supplies. The addition of swimming pool drying equipment this time shows that the hotel has listened carefully to the voices of guests. The night view from the room is really amazing.
Next, let’s talk about some suggestions: 1. The arrival area at the main entrance is isolated and has only one row of lanes. This causes the main entrance to be extremely congested during peak hours. Cars can’t get in. When I arrived, there happened to be an illegal parking lot at the intersection, so cars can’t get in. 2. I have to move all the large and small parcels in by myself. 2 There is a stinky smell in the elevator (maybe it's the fragrance) 3 The swimming pool is wet, the sauna wall is cracked, the tiles are cracked and need to be repaired 4 The steps near the takeout cabinet need to be pasted with warnings and I tripped over. Overall, it's a very good hotel. The price is beautiful and very cost-effective!

Location: Full marks. Travel is extremely convenient because it is next to Zhongshan Plaza, the most mature business district.

Service: The guest room was cleaned very carefully and I was also very impressed by the service of the concierge. Because I had a group check-in that day, the smoking floor was given to the group, but the front desk was very busy, so the concierge (a senior chef) took the initiative to help me coordinate

Facilities, catering: The price is reasonable. It feels more like letting tourists experience the service rather than necessarily making money. The bread in the hotel lobby is very good. I bought two before leaving.

Disadvantages: ①: 6 elevators are not too many, but they are extremely slow...
           ②: There are too few people at the front desk, and there will be no adjus**ents to add new ones due to instant passenger flow.

To be frank, I can only say that Dalian is tarnishing the name of Intercontinental. First of all, check-in takes too long. I have stayed at many hotels around the world, including on business trips, but this was the first time that check-in took more than 30 minutes. There were three lines, and after waiting for about 15 minutes, it was finally my turn to check-in. I checked, but there is no such display anywhere. In addition, the equipment is still broken and left unattended. It was pointed out in other evaluations, and the comments on the hotel side are all about improvements, but I don't think they will fix it. Basic problem with room management if you don't notice the damage as pictured. Even if you use the shower room normally, there is almost no drop from the washroom, so if you are not careful, it will be flooded. At the buffet restaurant, there were many leftover dishes left over from the previous guests on the chairs, and they were left unattended. Is it really Intercontinental? Only good thing is the location.

1. The room is aging and the head of the bed is peeling, and the wall of the bathroom is yellow
2. There are white hairs on the wooden furniture and metal handles
3. There is hair in the bathroom bathtub
When I entered the room after 10 o'clock, I found that the table top was covered with white fluff, and the metal handles were dusty and stained. I felt that no one had cleaned it for a long time. It is unacceptable that there is hair in the bathtub in the bathroom. I have very short hair. As an international chain five-star hotel, these problems should be explained.

The drinking water in the guest room is placed in the bathroom. The refrigerator in the room is empty and there are no other drinks. Only the bathroom. Two bottles of water...sad. This is obviously a manifestation of the incompetence of the hotel management. If it is raining, you have to go out and ask the front desk to borrow an umbrella to return the deposit (I understand the deposit, but do you consider the inconvenience of returning the deposit for guests who come in and out many times?) Guests staying in the hotel use umbrellas Why can't I borrow it normally? Anyway, I have to check out at that time. If I haven't returned the umbrella, I can deal with it together after checking out... It's really a headache!

msg:I have almost no bad reviews for staying in hotels on business trips, but this Intercontinental Hotel in Dalian surprised me! Although it is not the worst hotel in my life, it is the worst in the five-star hotels I have stayed in so far!
Let me talk about the advantages first: 1. Sun Yong, the concierge of the hotel, was the first hotel service staff we contacted before we arrived in the hotel. , The person is very simple and honest. I was lucky enough to meet again when I left the next day. He took the initiative to help us get it into the car. When he learned that we had a lot of things and we were going to the airport, he also sent two gift bags for us to pack our things. We are very grateful 🙏
2. If you have any needs in the room, you can call the front desk, and basically they can be delivered to the room in time!
3. The hotel rooms are very large, and the view is not bad. It is said that you can see the sea...
Let’s talk about the disadvantages: 1. From check-in to check-out the next day in your hotel, I didn’t see any staff smiling actively, even if it was a professional smile (except Sun Yong, the concierge depar**ent)
2. When you check in, the service is quite satisfactory, but you don't feel the intimacy that a five-star hotel should have. Ask a question and answer a sentence, make no mistakes and don't make any mistakes, because it is the last thing we say when we bring children, please give us a set of slippers and toiletries for the children. The front desk didn't take the initiative to ask about providing or upgrading the room, etc... (this can't even catch up with the whole season)
3. I went out at 3:30 p.m., because I needed room service, so I put a sign on the doorknob asking for cleaning, but when I returned to the room at 7 p.m., the room was not cleaned! I would like to ask if there is a guest who wants to clean the room, and then the duty manager called to apologize and explain...
4. The attitude of the aunt who delivered things to the room at night was very dull, and she left as soon as she delivered.
5. Judging from the grade and details of the hotel’s decoration, it should have been very brilliant back then, but after more than 10 years, it has not been renovated, and the furniture and supplies are very old. People who like a sense of time should like it very much!
6. Is the air conditioner in the room not very good? It’s extremely hot. It’s adjusted to 14 degrees, the lowest, and it’s still 27 or 28 degrees. The stewed vegetables bought by the big merchants are sticky the next day because they didn’t put them in the refrigerator in time...
7. Just after 8 o'clock the next morning, I got up to wash up (my lover and child hadn't woken up yet), when I heard the doorbell, I thought who could it be? Unexpectedly, it was the auntie who came to apologize because the room was not cleaned, saying that I did not see your listing, so I am really sorry! But if it wasn’t her who delivered things at night, people said they didn’t see the sign on the doorknob and looked at the aunt who was about the same age as my mother and apologized to me like this, what else can I say...
8. The bathtub faucet is not tightened.
9. The door of the closet is not closed tightly... I won't mention it one by one.
PS: At the invitation of college classmates, I brought my family to take a vacation together. I stayed at your hotel on the last day. Although I only stayed for one night, fortunately I only stayed for one night!

msg:When I came to Dalian, I was a bit tangled in accommodation, whether to continue to live in the usual Intercontinental or change to another hotel to try the new present-New World, Kempinski or experience the Japanese-style Nikko. In the end, I chose InterContinental, because the location is good, it is convenient to go around, the breakfast is rich, the room is large, and I am also a member of IHG. At breakfast, I could clearly feel that everyone traveled more after the epidemic, and the number of people dining increased a lot. Fortunately, the service level is still online, and the cleaning and restocking of dishes can be done in a timely manner. When I checked in this time, the front desk was still very enthusiastic to help me to associate with my IHG member (although I don't quite understand what this association means), and enjoyed a welcome drink. The speed of check-out and checkout has indeed improved, and the speed is much faster. If there are deficiencies, I think there are two points: details and temperature. Maybe I am a bit demanding, and the details may be overlooked by some service staff in their daily work. For example: when they went downstairs to leave the restaurant after breakfast, a staff member seemed to have something to do, just like in daily life , directly stuck and ran down the stairs; when the front desk answered the guests' questions, there was nothing wrong with replying according to the standardized answers, but it was a bit hard, and I felt that the necessary warmth between people was missing.

However, various details have damaged the reputation of the InterContinental Hotel: for example, there were three hairs on the bathroom floor on February 22 on the day of check-in. The glass glue added to the shower room (room 3109) is like a dog chewing on it. . . After taking a shower, the floor was covered with water, and there was a large gap under the door. . . Can't stop the water at all. Set to stay for three consecutive days.
Breakfast pastries and salads are of good quality. Chinese stir fry is too bad,
The potato shreds mixed with breakfast on the 23rd was completely tasteless, and the fungus mixed with it was a bit watery. The salami was absolutely spoiled, tasted like clams. . .
The fried garlic moss for breakfast on the 25th was tasteless and dark brown. . . The heat preservation of the induction cooker burned the garlic moss. . .
The pumpkin cake 🎃 is super hard, definitely not water-milled glutinous rice flour. . The steamed buns were also super dry, as was the corn. . .
I don't understand, five-star hotel chefs can't even cook basic meals, and they can't tell if the quality is good or bad. . .
Too disappointed

I am around 6pm on the 24th. I went to the front desk to check in. I wanted to drink a bottle of drink at about nine o’clock after check-in, but there was no one in the room, so I called the front desk and asked if I could send two bottles of Coke to the room. I asked after getting confirmation from the front desk The price, a can of sugar-free Coke is 18 yuan, so I ordered 2 cans, because it was not cold, I put a can in the refrigerator, and when I woke up the next morning and remembered that I forgot to drink it, I called the front desk. The room attendant came to take away the undrinked can, but when I left the store, I found out that I had deducted two cans of money. After looking for Ctrip, I found that InterContinental is really good**, in order not to refund the 18 One yuan abruptly adjusted the price of a can of Coke from 18 to 36 a can. I also recognize your hard work. Come on ^0^~ The floor of the five-star hotel in Dalian.

The front desk service is friendly (the name starts with Z because it was written on the room card and I forgot it for a while). The room is spacious and comfortable. In the evening The time room also has night room service (the curtains will be drawn when you return to the room at night) very satisfied with the check-in experience

msg:Just had time to comment. I come here again and again, and the service attitude of the hotel is as good as ever! Thanks to the beauty Eliana at the front desk for helping to upgrade the room. She was always greeted with a smile and made me feel very comfortable, and she even gave me a drink! In addition, I misremembered the breakfast time. When I arrived at the breakfast room at 10:02 on non-weekends, the staff kept asking me what I wanted to eat, and reminded everyone to collect the food later. I didn’t remember the name of the beautiful sister. Thank you The whole restaurant is very personal.

msg:For business needs, I can only choose Intercontinental this time. Originally, I only booked an ordinary room, but the strange smell in the room drove me and my family back. I went downstairs to the front desk to change the room, and I said, "Have you seen this room yourself? Can such a strong smell really live in people? I want to pay more to change the room, but first confirm that the hygiene of the room is OK." As a result, the front desk had short hair. The person answered me and said: We have upgraded your room for free, and the room you originally booked is on the floor below the 25th floor.
There are really a hundred black question marks in my heart... The size of the room is related to the floor and price, but shouldn't basic hygiene be guaranteed for all room types? I can't tell you about hygiene, but you tell me that the room type is below the 25th floor?
Alright, let's stop here. During the epidemic, I stayed at InterContinental several times, and the quality of hygiene, service and breakfast has declined significantly. This time I stayed here, objectively speaking, the quality of breakfast is still not good, and the service of some staff is not good, but fortunately, it can be seen that there is improvement. For example, the suite on the 46th floor was later changed. The sanitation and comfort are better, very good The price/performance ratio is comparable to that of Conrad; the person who greets guests on the stairs every day at breakfast seems to be the manager of the restaurant, and has always been very enthusiastic. He even remembers our preferences and is very kind; finally, the uncle at the concierge on the day of check-out seems to be called Sun Yong I saw that his hair was a little gray, but he behaved politely and enthusiastically. He helped us move a few big luggages up and down, which really added points to the hotel.

The attitude of the front desk staff is average, the restaurant staff are quite friendly, the room facilities are a bit old, and I feel that it is a little far from the standard of a five-star hotel. If I go to Dalian recently, I probably won't stay in this hotel, but if I have a chance, I might consider going to the restaurant again.

But the hotel still has to be strict with itself, especially the reception standard. The hotel received dozens of group guests, all of which were piled at the front desk, making the small front desk suddenly become like a vegetable market. The hotel did not adapt to changes, and no service staff had the courage to come forward to solve the chaos. It took only one hour to check in at the end of the line, and even the platinum card channel was useless. It greatly reduced the brand image of the entire Intercontinental.

The most important thing is that the staff of the hotel are very, very, very warm and hospitable. Guest Relations Manager Jenny Zhang, she was at the front desk in charge of receiving Check-in guests. When she saw that we and my good friend had two children and they arrived at night, she immediately helped us to upgrade to a parent-child room, and the children of my good friend's house Very happy, another room was upgraded to the executive floor immediately because there was no parent-child room, which made our stay experience very good. Jenny was very warm and patient, made us feel more cordial, and gave it to the children I got two welcome gifts 🎁 and welcome fruit 👍👍👍 I must like it for the first time; when I left the store and went to the Jinshiwan Hotel, I also took the initiative to arrange a room for the contact. Second thumbs up; when our wallet was lost in the hotel lobby, we assisted the concierge director to arrange for the wallet to be delivered to the hotel in Jin****an. This kind of urgent service is touching, and the ability to handle emergencies must be handled for the third time. Like 👍👍👍 The second person we would like to thank is Liu Qiang, the head of the concierge department, he is very, very attentive and enthusiastic, and very, very responsible, when he found that there was a child in the hotel lobby playing with my lost wallet , I carefully asked the child if the wallet was owned by the child or the parent of the child. After getting a negative answer, I immediately checked that the wallet contained the ID cards of me and my children, as well as 500 yuan in cash and a bank card. Check if there is a guest in the hotel, and then call me immediately. At that time, we were still on the way to the next hotel, and I didn't realize that I lost anything The certificate will be unimaginable. We must thank him here and give him a hand-made thumbs up👍👍👍 Because of the two hospitable and hospitable employees of InterContinental Hotel, we decided to stay in this Dalian InterContinental Hotel after returning from Jin****an, and it felt very cordial!

msg:Very bad stay experience. The hotel is located in the financial center of the old city, very close to Zhongshan Square. It can only be said that the subway is convenient. If you need to take the subway. The first thing I need to say is that the doorman at the door is very enthusiastic. Hotel prices are also very prosperous in Dalian's tourist season, much higher than those in Chengdu, Tianjin and other cities. The price is nothing. When checking in at the front desk, there are two guests who are asking to change rooms because the air conditioner and room smell are unacceptable, but the front desk has no way to deal with it. Because the room is full, ask the waiter to check it again... So I I was also talking to the front desk about the problem of not having air conditioning in our room. At least... The choice that the front desk gave me is actually no choice. There is only one room of the same type, and there are only 11 floors without high floors. If you want high floors, you must Increase the price... Although we are not satisfied with this answer, we have no choice, and do not comment on the attitude. After entering the room and putting things away, there is no view outside the window, because it is located between high-rise buildings and that is the only way it can be. The air conditioner is ok, but the musty smell is blah blah blah. When I was putting my luggage, I suddenly found a big cigarette butt as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, and there was a layer of dust on the partition beside the table. We could not accept this kind of hygiene, which surprised me, knowing that the front desk did not have the ability to solve the problem and Service, so I went directly to the front office manager to complain. The service of the old hotel is still there, and we changed to a room on a slightly higher floor. As shown in Figure 4, it's ok. After one night, I found a big bug when I went to bed. As shown in Figure 5, it crawled out along the quilt, which scared me... Complain again, give us a solution The plan is just to send an afternoon tea or a piece of cake, it is almost 12 o'clock at this time... Of course, I don't want anything, I just want to avoid another worm. One more thing, there is no service at all for breakfast. The waiter can clean the table in time and put enough plates on it. It is very good. The mask of the staff is completely useless when operating cooked noodles or something. The whole restaurant is like a free market. This is the hardware ➕ software of a five-star hotel. I have lived in Intercontinental in many cities. Don't use the hotel for a long time as an excuse, the facilities are not a problem. If you want to receive so many guests, please keep up with the service. Such an intercontinental choice

msg:Seeing that the hotel reviews are not very good, it was not selected as my favorite hotel. We stayed on the second day. Maybe the whole season was too different on the first day. It was a great surprise when we stayed on the second day.

Transportation: The location is in Zhongshan Square. All shopping malls are very close to each other. There is also a snack street at night. We didn't go shopping, we saw it by car
Hygiene: The requirements are not very high, I didn't pay attention, but the room is really big, the children are very happy, there is space to play
Environment: A big hotel, a bit old, with a**osphere written in all aspects. There are many varieties of breakfast, but in fact, they are almost the same. I am tired of eating for two days.
Service: There are only 2 windows at the front desk during the day. It is best to register in advance and get the room card later. Anyway, you have to line up, issue invoices, register, and the room card is all in the same window. The service has everything, if you say attitude, it may be too busy to be more affectionate. It's fine when it's empty. There is a chef in the restaurant to maintain order, which is still very good, helping us to find a seat.
The only two problems, one: We only booked one night, and the next day, the premium was 300 for the same type of apar**ent (maybe because there are meetings, and there are too many people staying in the basic room) The result is still luxurious, with a premium of 80 . So if you consider staying on the first day, make a continuous reservation.
Second: the front desk has not responded yet, and the deposit has been deducted by 15. I don't know why (I heard from my parents that I used a razor, because we are not in the same room) but it seems that it is in the toilet box, and I didn't pay attention to where the price is marked. If this amount is really not large, we have used it, and there is no problem. But what is the fee that has not been given a reply?

When inquiring about the epidemic policy by telephone, the statement was clear and complete, which was a complete victory over New World Hotel. When checking in, they offered drinks on their own initiative, and delivered fruit twice on the day of check-in. They also tried their best to meet other needs. They listened to service feedback in a timely manner and felt good.
The hotel is located in the city center, and the surrounding facilities are complete. Take dining as an example, the nearby Zhenghuangqi and Riyueming are highly recommended after trying them. The underground parking lot is also standard. I would like to commend the uncle in the parking lot for actively coordinating other parking spaces after the hotel parking spaces are full, with a warm attitude.
The room size is very large, and the basic room type is 50 square meters. Although the facilities are a few years old, the facilities are well maintained. The bathtub is also standard. The bedding is a bit soft, it would be better if it can be improved. Next time I come to Dalian, I will continue to choose Intercontinental!

They are purely personal comments, and I am responsible for the authenticity of all the following content.
I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. If I can sum it up in one sentence, it is: first-class location, second-class service, third-class facilities.
Live full of anger! ! !
Various incidents for 3 days in a row made me feel that this hotel is simply [Dalian Intercontinental Maintenance Hotel], why do you say that, see below.

[Keep changing rooms, keep maintaining] I got off the plane at 10:00 in the morning and arrived at the hotel first, let the front desk go through the formalities in advance, and waited until the afternoon to get the room card before checking in. When you go through the formalities, you will be assigned to room 3308.
When I returned to the hotel at 2:00 pm, I told the room 3308 that I had done the formalities before because there was a problem with the facilities, and the engineer was repairing it and could not move in. Room 3318 on the same floor can be exchanged.
After staying in room 3318, from the air-conditioning panel that had turned yellow and was almost scorched, I found that no matter how much the air-conditioning was turned on, even if it was turned on at 14 degrees, the room temperature was always hovering at 27 degrees. But because the journey was quite tiring, I just slept in the afternoon until I was woken up by the heat in the evening. I couldn't stand it anymore. I told the front desk and the answer was to ask an engineer to repair it. It happened that I went to dinner, so I didn't care about it. After returning from dinner, the front desk informed room 3318
The air conditioner is broken, and the engineer is repairing it. They can change you another room. Go to a suite, room 3412. There should be no problem with the cooling of the room there. At this point, the first day of maintenance journey is over.

[Perfunctory welcome fruit] The so-called IHG members welcome fruit and drinks. Let's not talk about drinks and Coke, just fruit. I'll give you a paper bag and go to the "swing cake house" on the other side of the first floor to pick it up and open it. fruit
The cabinets have been picked for a long time, but none of them can be picked up, either with black spots or a little soft and rotten feeling. This is how members are welcomed. If the hotel really doesn't know how to buy fruit, go out and turn left for 200 meters.
In a fruit shop, there is a pile of fruit at the door, and any one is fresher than the one in the hotel.

[Messy breakfast room] The breakfast room is on the 6th floor, which coincides with Saturday morning, and many people come to have breakfast. After I arrived at the breakfast room at 8:30, I found that there were no plates under the row of cabinets when I entered the door.
First, look around for the plate, find the plate and find the place, find the place, and find that there is no cutlery in the first place, and no tissue in the second place. Forget it, who gets more people? Until the third time for breakfast, the morning of July 11
, Because it is a working day, there are fewer people, but I found that the brand of hot milk in the breakfast room has magically disappeared. This means that if you're a new hotel guest for breakfast, you don't know this
What liquid is in the yellow jar, eating breakfast is like opening a blind box?

[Security at the door of watching people serve dishes] At the entrance of the hotel, wearing a white shirt is responsible for the security of the door, which is really a loss of face for the hotel. On July 11th, when I went out in the morning, I called for a special Didi car, a luxury car with active security.
Open the door for me. When I came back at noon, I called a Didi Express. The car was relatively broken. The car drove to the front entrance of the hotel, and the security guard stood there, indifferent. Security was like a log until I walked into the hotel.
Later, when I finally checked out, I consulted the front desk, and the front desk told me that the security depar**ent was wearing a white shirt outside the door. Although I'm not sure whether the security has changed shifts during this time period, whether it is the same person in the morning, but
As a hotel staff first contact with guests, it really should not be the case.

[The so-called complete facilities can only be random] When I booked a hotel in early July, I specifically called the hotel to ask about the hotel's facilities and whether the gym and swimming pool were open. I replied that it is currently open because of the epidemic, and it is difficult to say in the future.
After arriving at the hotel, on the evening of July 9, I went to the swimming pool on the 7th floor of the hotel and told me that the swimming pool was broken and was being repaired. It turns out that all my unfortunate things happened here. The room was broken and repaired, and the swimming pool was broken and repaired.
Hotel facilities are one thing, whether they can be used or not is another.

[Mysterious room phone] It is written on the room phone and the guest handbook in the room that pressing the "Quick Service" button can provide room service, but when I have something to look for room service, I call the opposite side and tell me I,
You have to press "0", this time even if I help you transfer, remember to press 0 next time. I wondered, where did it say on the phone that you can press 0 for room service? Making a phone call also depends on guessing.

[The room carpet that is about to be buried] Even if it is finally upgraded to the suite of room 3412, the carpet of the hotel is indescribable. After careful observation, there is old dirt that cannot be removed. Some places are deep and some places are shallow. Randomly distributed on the carpet.
It's hard for you to imagine that this is a carpet in a five-star hotel, or a suite.

[The only two points worthy of praise or affirmation] (1) At around 2:10 pm on July 11, in the hotel lobby, there was an older staff member in gray clothes who was about to leave the hotel door after I checked out. When the time came, he took the initiative to carry luggage for my wife, and was polite and decent. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to read the name on the badge. This was the only staff member in the hotel that I felt fit for a 5 star hotel. (2) The location of the hotel is almost in the center of Dalian City. It is the Friendship Square when you go out, and the Tianjin Street Pedestrian Street is opposite. The prosperity and convenience are still worthy of recognition.

To sum up, it is: first-class location, second-class service, third-class facilities.
It is recommended to modify the hotel's rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. After the hotel is renovated, the facilities are carefully maintained, and the management process and personnel quality are improved, the star rating will be tried again.

Facilities: The hotel facilities are a bit old, the TV picture is not very clear, the small refrigerator is not cold, and the duck we bought broke after a day

Overall not very recommended

And, although the wash and care is byredo, it is a large bottle that is recycled, and the pressing port is not clean. Apart from the service attitude of the waiters, this hotel is really not like an Intercontinental.

At the front desk, I received warm reception and meticulous care from winnie. Every day, I added a lot of water and gave us welcome fruits. The service level of each depar**ent of the hotel is very high.
The Intercontinental bed is also considered by a few friends around me to be the most comfortable among these five-star hotels in Dalian. As a person who has difficulty falling asleep, I basically put it on my pillow, whirring ←_←

Intercontinental basement The various car paints on the walls tell the tears of history

I took the note (probably left it outside the hotel) Thanks to the waiter Gao Hui!
The check-in was also very pleasant. Song Dandan at the front desk checked in quickly. I didn't like the room at the beginning, and was very considerate to change the room because I liked the high floor. The front desk also took the initiative to call the next day to help change the room.
The swimming pool is also good, less people and clear water
The only regret is that I didn't get tiramisu (reservation required)
All in all a great hotel experience!

msg:After thinking about it for a long time, I don't know how to evaluate it. I am a person who is not very compulsive in team accommodation requirements. The location is OK, the concierge has a very good phone attitude, and there are fewer staff in the lobby. The overall facility is indeed too old. The advantage is that the room is very large and the bed is quite comfortable. Others are not very good. The air-conditioning problem mentioned in other comments does exist. The air-conditioning is basically useless at noon. The cooling depends on the refrigerator added by the hotel. In the evening in mid-August, the room temperature is sufficient. Furama, New World and Shangri-La in the same street have also lived there, and overall, Furama West Building is the most cost-effective. Shangri-La room is too small and the price is too high. I have a soft spot for Dalian. Intercontinental in other cities is very good in all aspects. I hope Dalian Intercontinental can update its hardware facilities as soon as possible.

The front desk said that there was a coach in the pool, so I looked for him. I took the child to look around, and when I couldn't find it, I went back to the front desk and continued to ask. One of the female staff members actually said it was impossible with a very contemptuous expression, and then took us to find a pump, and passed the swimming pool and pointed out to me, "This is not Coach?" I saw that the woman in a black swimsuit didn't even have a hotel logo on her body, and she was still taking her child to swim in the water. Who knows if this is the coach or the child's mother? I found the inflator and it was still broken, but in the end it was the lifebuoy that I blew. The child can finally play, I saw two lifeguard high chairs, and there was no one on it. Later, there was a cowardly child who said that this swimming pool is for training and others can't use it... He also used words to attack my child. I asked his parents. The child is stocking at all, and the parents are not at all. Children around 10 years old do not need to swim in your hotel. Are parents accompanied? Then I asked the coach if it was in the training area, and she said no, it was all about anything.
  Hygienic, the bathtub drain is a large square cover, which can be removed, and it is full of stains.

The service was very good, helped me upgrade the room type, and also gave me a fruit plate. Sister Warm Heart... That's great! The scenery is beautiful, with unobstructed views~you can see the sea~the mood is different! There are signs of age in the room, but the sanitation is still quiet! The staff who cleaned the room were very noisy in the corridor. At around 10 in the morning, they would hear them talking all the time, which would affect the rest of the guests a bit! I hope you can pay attention! Due to the special period, the hotel has many disinfection and cleaning measures. There are disinfection paper towels and hand sanitizer in the elevator, and there is a disinfection purifier in the lobby. Stay at ease.

msg:To be honest, it is very not recommended. You can read the reviews and start to see the latest ones. See what activities the hotel responds to Ctrip guests in October. Actually, there is nothing at the store. The reason is that there was it before, and it will be gone when you come. Welcome fruit, the tone is sir. If you really want to eat it, I can try to apply for it for you, but normally there is no. In addition, I used Ctrip to book an IHg hotel before. At least two bottles of welcome drink at the front desk, because there are A gold card member, not this one. Tell the room that the free mineral water is a welcome drink. In addition, a staff member at the front desk, whose specific name is not clear, can take the initiative to call the customer, and she continues to call after the guest hangs up. I continued to call, and finally reported the situation to Ctrip. Ctrip said that the hotel manager contacted me immediately. Actually, he waited from 9:30 to 11 in the evening. The hotel manager finally got busy and contacted me and said that he thought Diao Ren was a veteran employee. If there is a problem, and he listened to the recording, he didn’t feel bad. Ctrip wanted to record. He couldn’t provide it. He only suggested calling the police or going through the litigation procedure. It doesn’t matter. I went to the manager to ask for the name of the female employee, prepare to complain, and tell directly. That’s my person. If you want to make a complaint, you can complain to him. You are advised to call the police for everything else. According to the police’s requirements, hahahaha. The guest relations manager of the service industry still advises to report to the police whenever things happen. What is the InterContinental Hotel? How good is the InterContinental Court? I suggest you stay away if you are not a party member. After all, it is very similar to a hotel of political law and a prison-style management system. , Just say that.

There is a subway station downstairs from the hotel, and there are many bus lines around, making travel convenient. The hotel is a local veteran five-star hotel. Although the facilities are no longer as fresh as new after the time has passed, the service is not discounted at all! Knowing that we are foreign tourists, we presented afternoon tea on the 46th floor of the hotel on the day of check-in. And according to the weather forecast of the day, I specially helped us to make an appoin**ent for the time when the weather is clear at 3:30, so that we can overlook the beautiful city of Dalian at the first time. The next day coincided with my birthday, and the hotel sent a cake very warmly. To be honest, I was very moved: because they would not know, this was the first time I came back to Dalian after leaving Dalian for nearly 40 years; they didn’t. You will know that this guest holding a foreign ID card was actually born in Dalian! Dalian is my second hometown! During my stay, I had breakfast in the hotel’s coffee shop. The manager Zhang Dan of the restaurant gave me a very dedicated impression: She always greeted every guest warmly, and always came forward to ask about their dining experience after the meal. Experience, listen and collect feedback from guests. It is recommended that the hotel’s breakfast not only takes into account the category and taste, but also combines the local food culture to provide some breakfast varieties with local characteristics, such as pasta, which can have hand-rolled noodles, handmade pancakes, buns, steamed buns, and dumplings. and many more. All in all, this trip back home after nearly 40 years is very successful! very meaningful! Thanks to all the staff of COSCO SHIPPING Intercontinental Hotel for their thoughtful service. It is your warm and caring service that made me deeply feel the warmth of my hometown! Thanks again 🙏

Because the elderly were too troublesome, they gave up. Finally, they had to change one room to the 27th floor. Both rooms have air purifiers, but how long have they not changed the filter? The video is proof, it's too dirty! The service is the same. When the waiter delivered the purifier, I remembered asking for a pair of slippers for the child. The waiter grumbled and said why not say it together, and she had to run twice. Alas, except for breakfast and swimming pool which are not bad, others are really not complimented and not recommended!

msg:For those traveling to Dalian, I chose InterContinental compared to several hotels in the city center. Overall service is good. The welcome was very good, and the luggage was carried into the guest room. The room is quite big, and the facilities are a bit backward, such as no special USB port, etc., there are Bose speakers. It’s okay to live, the bathing water is OK, the sleeping is quiet and soundproof, this is very important, and the guest rooms are also very careful. After dining in the restaurant for several days, the service to my sister is very warm. Easy to travel. Thank you Zhou Yu'e, Chen Shuyan and other service staff.

msg:This is a very orderly hotel, because you need to queue up everywhere, you need to queue up for check-in, you need to queue up to get your room card, you need to queue up for check-out, and you need to queue up at the front desk to even pull an extra bed. Why? Because the phone has been unanswered, and even emergency calls have not been answered, and this kind of queue takes more than 15 minutes. Now there are many people during the summer vacation, which is understandable, but the efficiency of their check-in is really bad, and the steps are locked.
       Let's talk about the room. After entering the room, I saw the decoration from 20 years ago. The old carpets and sofas were stained with stains. The dim lighting made you feel depressed every minute. No matter how many degrees you adjust the indoor air conditioner, it is always constant temperature. It is kept at 27.5 degrees during the day and 26.5 degrees at night. It is almost an electric fan. However, this air conditioner also has a time to cool you down, that is, when you open the bathroom door after taking a shower, there is an air outlet above your head blowing wildly at you, which makes me very helpless!
       In general, the software and hardware are not good, and I was fooled by the name of Intercontinental and the photos on Ctrip.

酒店在中山廣場周邊，打卡非常方便，邊上還有地鐵，出行便利。周邊有美食街，吃的很多。下次來大連會繼續考慮訂這裏。

酒店在綜合服務方面，性價比非常高，雖然4月天氣還涼，停止供熱，酒店在提供温度保障方面提供了電暖器，還積極調整中央空調。多次關注我們的感受。地理位置方便，房間寬敞衞生，有品質。推薦大家來大連，就來中遠海運。

酒店設施完備，衞生狀態良好，服務更是讓我這個一直出差的飛人贊歎。
更加值得一提的是，晚上21點時，Happy女士還安排小哥送上來暖胃菌菇湯。
時間很短暫，區區一晚，卻讓我對洲際留下來極為深刻的記憶。對了還有前台Ella小姐姐，非常贊。
下次大連繼續中遠海運洲際走起！

1.房間晚上中間空間温度過高. 但是第二天聯繫前台給房間配了製冷機. 可以緩解室內的温度.，BUT那個機器比較老舊噪音比較大，另外製冷機的電源是改造過的，有安全隱患. 
2.給禮賓部孫勇服務點贊，及時幫忙送行李，解決問題. 
3.酒店游泳池人較少，環境好，服務好.適合帶孩子來玩.
4. 行政樓層的happy hour挺差. 菜品品質差. 人稍微多點連餐具都沒有. 有的菜品還是冷的.未及時加熱保温.
5. 早餐…..挺無語….一言難盡… 菜品的出品問題跟入住高峯和成本問題有關. 暫不評論. 對早餐服務問題意見較大！帶小寶寶用餐，沒人主動提供寶寶圍嘴也就算了. 當主動要求時，餐廳的員工和主管也不能提供. 此處點名投訴餐飲服務經理王強，在跟其要求提供寶寶圍嘴後，指鹿為馬，拿大人一次性圍兜糊弄. 在我提出異議後，其聲稱再去找，然後.然後這貨居然….跑了….消失了….派員工來回話説沒有…當我要求其出面解決問題後.員工也找不到他！ 沒解決問題你跑什麼啊？！ 你們的SOP呢？你們的brand standard在哪？ 後續幾日早餐當主動詢問寶寶圍嘴時，員工和主管仍不能解決問題.每次都需要找到ADD mgr才能解決. 這樣的管理是不是需要改進和提高？！
To management：當前的市場確實有變化. 硬件和成本上的調整，客户是可以接受的.  但請務必保證管理人員的培訓和考核.避免其他客人出現類似的情況.對酒店其他服務無大意義.這個差評給王強.方便你們KPI.

1.攜程網上付了三千多的保證金。説的到店付房費就可以，結果到店還得交一千五的按金。我們住兩個房間，連訂兩晚，一個房間晚近1500元，兩個房間兩晚近6000。網上線下交近五千按金。前台還説我在網上付的保證金和他們酒店沒有關係。我就奇怪了，你們酒店和平台合作的，怎麼就沒有關係了？（後來酒店入住後平台的保證金退回來了）
2.早餐問題，孩子的早餐還得我們自己去餐廳諮詢。
住康萊德酒店都不用自己去溝通，前台直接給辦好了，直管報人數吃飯就可以。
3.入住的時候沒人接行李箱，自己拎箱，自己找電梯。
4.房間雖然夠寬，但是不是19年開業的房，經過後期瞭解已經是十幾年前裝修的房。有些陳舊。屋裡太悶，空調調低也老往上跳。
建議同等家外選其他家，此家避之。
以下為優點：餐廳吃飯會合理安排，不會人滿了還讓進。還提供打包服務。

酒店設施是真的有些老，畢竟也這麼多年了；酒店的裝修沒有給人很老很落後的感覺，可能是酒店風格的原因亦有可能是我年紀大了😂。

住洲際一定不要定最便宜的房型，因為在陰面（面對辦公樓），房間風景、温度都很差。

酒店雖然不算新了，但維持着洲際一貫的服務品質與高培訓員工素養。我是比較麻煩的客户，小問題較多，勞動節入住五六天，總能被工作人員温暖到，包括但不限於:

- 感謝宋智偉先生，為我找到忘記了的快遞，並温馨體貼地溝通，給我寄回廣州，給你添麻煩了。

- 感謝劉偉女士、劉文香女士，這幾天把房間收拾很乾凈，聊天也很熱情，我讓賓至如歸。

洲際無論廣州、北京、上海、深圳，乃至大連，都是很好的酒店選擇，點贊！

大連洲際各方面都比較滿意。入住時前台就升級到開放式套房。客房服務有求必應。6樓西餐廳做的肉醬意麪非常好。早餐品種非常豐富。3樓中餐廳菜色口味也適合我們南方人的味蕾，住了4天在外面衹吃了二次，原因是大連的菜太鹹！泳池設施和服務就是洲際的標準！
特別要感謝Grace and Dana, 給我們延退到下午4點，因為我們的回程航班延誤4小時，這樣不至於帶着5歲寶寶在機場遊蕩！

2、衞生間窗簾是左右兩段合葉式的，中間賊大的空隙且顧得了上半部分顧不上下半部分，實在沒辦法關了燈洗澡的。
3、酒店房間的燈太暗了，是我目前所住酒店最暗的，哪怕開了枱燈，你想看看書眼睛都要看瞎的那種暗。
4、電話機邊上也沒有提示需要服務應該打什麼號碼，衹有電話機上面有禮賓部按鍵，打電話過去告知窗簾有問題，接聽的直接告知應該打什麼號碼我忘記了，説他們禮賓部衹負責入住問題，語氣不好，好像我就應該知道打哪個電話，而不應該打給他們，很無語
5、一共有6部電梯，但不管你是上還是下，永遠擠到不行，基本每層都要停，往往還擠不進去，時間最長那次從按鍵下開始到1樓花了10幾分鐘，我想要麼電梯設定有問題，要麼6部電梯沒全開，實在想不出為什麼坐個電梯要那麼久
酒店設施陳舊就不説了，之前訂房就有預期，但一向認為洲際的服務還是不錯的，但這次入住體驗感極差

1. 酒店位於中山廣場附近，地理位置很好。出門打車或者乘坐公共交通也很方便。
2. 房間很大，床也很舒服。
3. 工作人員的服務態度都很好，尤其出現問題他們也很重視，快速回應解決。

再説不足：
1. 入住辦理速度比較慢
2. 客房打掃不夠細緻，這個問題我反映後改善很多
3. 早餐真的很一般

總體還是滿意的，希望服務品質再提升一點。

   浴室又大又棒，視野比房間一點不差，牆上地下都是白色大理石，很有氣質，房間也大，雙床都很大，可兩大帶兩小睡，位置黃金，交通非常便利。

酒店的早餐確實做的非常用心，真的可以用太豐盛了來形容，還有可外帶走的咖啡。
泳池是帶玻璃頂，採光很好，寬敞又明亮，過來游泳確實很舒服。
值得推薦的老牌五星級酒店，期待下次入住！

設施太老了，房間味道很大，不能開窗通風，前台冷漠，沒服務沒態度，客服服務員半夜咣咣敲門，大喊大叫質問客人，訂了兩晚，住一晚就逃了，太差勁了。

先吐槽一點：房間燈光太暗了 看個書都累眼睛 懶得找酒店 但真的好暗啊 

用紙巾擦拭一些用品時 一點灰都沒有！！！包括衣櫃裏最裡麪的衣架！請給工作人員加雞腿！！

去看了國家地理相片展，中山區各主要商店溜達溜達就到！

感謝中餐廳的張丹經理呀！餐廳每一位工作人員都非常熱情周到！還有大堂的每一位！禮賓部的各位！非常感謝！

msg:入住的套房，從入住前調開始就要點名表揚一下Elben,在入住前一天就開始問我有什麼偏好，設施訊息也提供的很準確！這次入住的37樓房間，卧室視野很開闊！有非常大的景觀窗，空氣循環很好，條件非常不錯。健身房、游泳池都很好！相比於其他五星級，尤其是洲際的兩家弟弟牌子-星海皇冠假日和體育場皇冠假日，老大哥家的服務真的沒話説。還會入住，這是我在大連唯一IHG選項了。強烈推薦！

這次是晚上辦理的入住，前台的服務還算一般八，問我有沒有洲際的會員，我説沒有，竟然在沒經過我同意的情況下幫我不知道開通了什麼東西，手機收到了一堆的驗證碼……
酒店的保安也是，由於疫情原因，點的外賣統一放在保安室，下去取外賣的時候保安全程看着我拿，竟然連一個簡單的問好都沒得……
房間裏空調衹能制暖，制不了冷……
