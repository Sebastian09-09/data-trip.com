msg:The cabins are fun and comfortable to stay in. The key is that all the facilities are quite advanced. Hahahaha. When I left, I was already discussing with my husband that we would come back to stay and play again next time. The main reason is that this 72 Ideal Village is really suitable for vacation and relaxation. 1. It is ridiculously close to Shanghai. 2. There are rice fields, river embankments, and orchards. 3. There are cute electric cars for rent. You can rent them yourself. There is a small train for sightseeing. In short, it is very suitable for relaxation. Of course, the most important thing is: pet-friendly! ! ! ! ! You can bring the little ones to play together. This is the most important point and the main reason why I will go again!

msg:Because I was going to bring my baby, I chose a hotel with a bathtub and a special bathing pool. After arriving, objectively speaking, those without a car don't need to consider this place too much, because it is a rural road. The room is very large, but the bathtub upstairs is not very usable. The water is slow and dirty. There are 4 taps for hot water downstairs, 2 of which are good and 2 are not. I asked the staff to come and it took 10 minutes for the water to come. There were other people's hair in 2 of the 6 towels. I found it in 2 days. I was drunk. The service was very good, but the chef was not there. There was hot pot (299) for lunch and dinner, and wontons and noodles were 30 each. I learned about wontons and noodles after repeated inquiries. The environment is relatively primitive and simple, the air is very fresh and the wind is strong. The lady took me to do handicrafts, so I didn't have to take care of the baby for 30 minutes. I was very happy! I went to the riverside to see the seagulls and took a small train. You can walk to a Sanlian Bookstore. The coffee is delicious. Overall, it is more cost-effective to come when it is hot. Bring your child's shower gel and shampoo, which are not available in the store.

msg:The triangular house is nice and unique, but when we went there, there was a strong wind and we couldn't have a good time in the park. What a pity. I have to complain about the hotel's catering depar**ent. We went there for 3 days and 2 nights, and we ate at the hotel every night. The price of the dishes was expensive and the quantity was not large. The key is that this restaurant is not for parent-child families. The menu sent by the housekeeper is all seafood and river food. There are very few home-cooked dishes. A serving of ham shreds costs 98 yuan, which only contains a few hams and a few shrimps (see the pictures below). Breakfast is even worse. We checked in on Sunday and had a buffet breakfast on Monday morning. Although there were not many varieties, we could eat enough. On Tuesday morning, there was no buffet breakfast and it was changed to a nine-square grid. There was no porridge, no fruit, and no vegetables. It is understandable that there were not so many people eating and it could not be wasted. We are not unreasonable people, but our set meal was 3 breakfasts, but only 2 nine-square grids were served. In addition, a few small buns were added to the plate, saying that they were afraid that we could not eat it. We, 2 adults and a 14-year-old friend, were not full. The breakfast was really bad for more than 1,000 yuan a night, not as good as the surrounding B&Bs. I have stayed in many B&Bs and hotels, most of which received good reviews and I am willing to visit again. This Tree Frog disappointed me and I will basically not stay there again. I didn't give a low score because of the triangle house and the surrounding scenery. The service is average and the restaurant's food is ugly.

msg:I checked in at the end of September and overall it was not OK. The key point is that I just saw on the platform that the latest package is cheaper than the opening pre-sale, which is even more worrying.
Let me tell you a few reasons why I can't give it a good review.
1. We booked a triangular tree house. There is no TV and the bathroom is not private. It is a trivial matter. However, the ladder to the attic is very shaky and dangerous. In the end, I went upstairs to sleep. After all, if the children have to go downstairs to use the toilet at night, very dangerous.
2. A friend ordered a seed house, but the smell was so strong that it was impossible to stay in it. Then after communicating with the front desk, they said that the lotus leaf house was full, and they could only arrange the Xidi room at the back. Although they were given a room with a hot spring, there was indeed a price difference. The price difference meant that the room was changed to a room with a hot spring bath. The room price was cheap, but the front desk didn't mention refunding the difference at all. We went to negotiate later, but they asked us how much we thought we should refund?
3. The breakfast is really very basic, not even hot noodles and wontons. It should be the worst among the hotels and B&Bs I have stayed in.
4. The most unpleasant thing is that before 7 o'clock in the morning on weekends, excavator construction started at the door. Not only was there a lot of noise, but the entire tree house was shaking. After I reported it to the front desk, they actually told me to call the police. Their communication was useless. I? ? ? ? ?
5. Another bad thing about the overall itinerary is that it rained throughout the weekend. Except for the bookstore in the village, which felt like it was ready for business, other places were not good. This hotel was pre-sold in the first half of the year. I thought it would be OK after half a year, but I was very disappointed. The most important thing is that the price is not cheap, 1300+ per night.

There are too many things for breakfast and afternoon tea. The two of us couldn’t finish it. In the end, we packed it and went home to continue eating at night😂

msg:I stumbled across the last triangular house by accident, so I decided to go there before the Dragon Boat Festival. It is easy to find the place by following the navigation. It is located in a natural village that is developing a rural resort. The parking lot is on the side of the hotel. After parking the car, pulling the suitcase, listening to Xiao Zaizai shouting excitedly, walking along the wooden plank road in the field to the coffee shop where the front desk is located, I immediately relaxed. I don’t know if it’s due to limited manpower. I arrived after 2:00 pm and waited 40 minutes for the room to be cleaned up. Fortunately, the afternoon tea delivered to the room eased my mood. The hot pot set meal booked in the evening is still very worthwhile. The food is very fresh. There are endless snacks for two people and one person. It feels more suitable for the normal meal size of 3-4 adults. During the stay at the hotel, it happened to catch up with the first rainstorm after the plum season, and I slept soundly listening to the sound of the rain hitting the roof all night. I feel that the triangular house can live in three or one small (children and parents share the same bed). There are also villa-style guest rooms at the back. I heard that it may open around July. It is estimated that it is suitable for a large family or a few friends to travel together. Walking along the river, going down to the river beach to feel the river at close range, looking for small crabs, and seeing small butterflies in the fields, it is very relaxing. It will be better when there are more peripheral developments and more activities suitable for children. I hope to have the opportunity to stay in the lotus leaf house again next time.

msg:首先，服務是非常好的，之前就電話溝通加了微信，我們還沒進店就出來迎接，送我們去房間，告訴我們用餐的地方，提供歡迎水果和迷你吧，然後我們去做手工的教室做手工，老師還多送給小朋友一個風鈴。房間裏還提供泡澡袋和香薰眼罩。臨走時候的伴手禮小朋友也非常喜歡。其次，房間剛投入使用不久，所以裝修的味道還很濃，白天我們開門通風感覺還可以，但是晚上睡覺關門以後味道就很重，比較擔心會對小朋友不好。最後，整個村的環境還在打造中，我們去的那天江海號小火車沒有開，天太冷了也不太容易趕海，周圍的瀏河古鎮關門很早比較冷清，加上冬天天黑的比較早，房間裏也沒有電視，小朋友沒有什麼地方可以去玩。建議應該設定一個小童活動中心。

最後説優點木屋設計感沒得説、隔音好、用的小家電也是有品味，發發呆純在房間待着也不錯。
最後昨天晚上21:00-23:00期間有位機車小哥不停的聽他的500CC在轟鳴炸村路一圈又一圈的繞着，不知為何非常吵但也瘋一樣的抓不住他。
還是希望有所改進越來越好，畢竟這樣有設計與質感的民宿也好度假產品也好多多益善吧，安逸不代表隨意願你美好的獨樹一幟。

msg:酒店很有設計感，小火車遊覽是驚喜，總體不錯。
但有不少地方值得改進：
1、前台和咖啡吧的人員經常混在一起，但真正做咖啡的就一個人，其他人都是閑聊，顯得很不專業，看到有客人要問事情不知道問誰
2、酒店含早，但品種簡單，基本都是半成品加熱，烤腸麪粉含量很高，總體品質一般
3、酒店的晚餐需要提前一天預訂。我們是週五上午預訂的週六住宿，結果到週六中午酒店才聯繫我們，提供地圖定位，一開口就説我們下單太晚，所以昨天沒聯繫。於是晚餐的事情也當然不可能了。
4、週日上午我們還在房間休息，保潔不敲門的情況下，直接拿鑰匙開門，幸好被我制止了，否則馬桶上的老公就被看光光了。
5、酒店要了車牌號做進村的通行證，第一次名字手機號都是錯的。村口有保安，但根本不看通行證，全靠嘴説，而且反應木訥，估計很容易被鑽空子
6、導航給的路有問題，直接指到一條衹能單車通過的小路，保安重新指了路，才開上了新鋪的柏油馬路，建議在那個小路口立個指示牌，避免車輛誤入。
希望能夠好好經營，讓更多的小夥伴體驗鄉間野趣，也對得起你的價錢。

房間用品很好，衞生很好，送的水果和下午茶到房間服務都很好。小朋友非常喜歡樹屋，喜歡爬裏面的樓梯。
但是樹屋的閣樓很熱，户外環境一般，酒店公共區域小，配套活動少。可能是還在開發吧，不值這個價格。
小朋友大點的話，附近倒是可以挖小螃蟹等等，當地人都會過來，車停的開都開不出去。還有一家遊輪艙特色的餐館挺好吃的，物美價廉。
建議價格合適可以來，也可以住其他地方開車過來玩玩就行。畢竟好玩的都不在民宿裏。
