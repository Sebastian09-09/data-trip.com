When I left, I was already discussing with my husband that we would come back to stay and play again next time. The main reason is that this 72 Ideal Village is really suitable for vacation and relaxation. 1. It is ridiculously close to Shanghai. 2. There are rice fields, river embankments, and orchards. 3. There are cute electric cars for rent. You can rent them yourself. There is a small train for sightseeing. In short, it is very suitable for relaxation. Of course, the most important thing is: pet-friendly! ! ! ! ! You can bring the little ones to play together. This is the most important point and the main reason why I will go again!

The hotel also gave two tickets for the train, but it's a pity that there were too many people on this holiday, so I didn't take it. I must take the train next time. It's very close to the river, and the spring river breeze is also gentle. It's very pleasant to walk around and take a look.

msg:Because I was going to bring my baby, I chose a hotel with a bathtub and a special bathing pool. After arriving, objectively speaking, those without a car don't need to consider this place too much, because it is a rural road. The room is very large, but the bathtub upstairs is not very usable. The water is slow and dirty. There are 4 taps for hot water downstairs, 2 of which are good and 2 are not. I asked the staff to come and it took 10 minutes for the water to come. There were other people's hair in 2 of the 6 towels. I found it in 2 days. I was drunk. The service was very good, but the chef was not there. There was hot pot (299) for lunch and dinner, and wontons and noodles were 30 each. I learned about wontons and noodles after repeated inquiries. The environment is relatively primitive and simple, the air is very fresh and the wind is strong. The lady took me to do handicrafts, so I didn't have to take care of the baby for 30 minutes. I was very happy! I went to the riverside to see the seagulls and took a small train. You can walk to a Sanlian Bookstore. The coffee is delicious. Overall, it is more cost-effective to come when it is hot. Bring your child's shower gel and shampoo, which are not available in the store.

msg:The triangular house is nice and unique, but when we went there, there was a strong wind and we couldn't have a good time in the park. What a pity. I have to complain about the hotel's catering depar**ent. We went there for 3 days and 2 nights, and we ate at the hotel every night. The price of the dishes was expensive and the quantity was not large. The key is that this restaurant is not for parent-child families. The menu sent by the housekeeper is all seafood and river food. There are very few home-cooked dishes. A serving of ham shreds costs 98 yuan, which only contains a few hams and a few shrimps (see the pictures below). Breakfast is even worse. We checked in on Sunday and had a buffet breakfast on Monday morning. Although there were not many varieties, we could eat enough. On Tuesday morning, there was no buffet breakfast and it was changed to a nine-square grid. There was no porridge, no fruit, and no vegetables. It is understandable that there were not so many people eating and it could not be wasted. We are not unreasonable people, but our set meal was 3 breakfasts, but only 2 nine-square grids were served. In addition, a few small buns were added to the plate, saying that they were afraid that we could not eat it. We, 2 adults and a 14-year-old friend, were not full. The breakfast was really bad for more than 1,000 yuan a night, not as good as the surrounding B&Bs. I have stayed in many B&Bs and hotels, most of which received good reviews and I am willing to visit again. This Tree Frog disappointed me and I will basically not stay there again. I didn't give a low score because of the triangle house and the surrounding scenery. The service is average and the restaurant's food is ugly.

msg:I checked in at the end of September and overall it was not OK. The key point is that I just saw on the platform that the latest package is cheaper than the opening pre-sale, which is even more worrying.
Let me tell you a few reasons why I can't give it a good review.
1. We booked a triangular tree house. There is no TV and the bathroom is not private. It is a trivial matter. However, the ladder to the attic is very shaky and dangerous. In the end, I went upstairs to sleep. After all, if the children have to go downstairs to use the toilet at night, very dangerous.
2. A friend ordered a seed house, but the smell was so strong that it was impossible to stay in it. Then after communicating with the front desk, they said that the lotus leaf house was full, and they could only arrange the Xidi room at the back. Although they were given a room with a hot spring, there was indeed a price difference. The price difference meant that the room was changed to a room with a hot spring bath. The room price was cheap, but the front desk didn't mention refunding the difference at all. We went to negotiate later, but they asked us how much we thought we should refund?
3. The breakfast is really very basic, not even hot noodles and wontons. It should be the worst among the hotels and B&Bs I have stayed in.
4. The most unpleasant thing is that before 7 o'clock in the morning on weekends, excavator construction started at the door. Not only was there a lot of noise, but the entire tree house was shaking. After I reported it to the front desk, they actually told me to call the police. Their communication was useless. I? ? ? ? ?
5. Another bad thing about the overall itinerary is that it rained throughout the weekend. Except for the bookstore in the village, which felt like it was ready for business, other places were not good. This hotel was pre-sold in the first half of the year. I thought it would be OK after half a year, but I was very disappointed. The most important thing is that the price is not cheap, 1300+ per night.

The service is also very good. We didn't bring facial cleanser, but the young lady gave us her own sample. Thank you very much

msg:I stumbled across the last triangular house by accident, so I decided to go there before the Dragon Boat Festival. It is easy to find the place by following the navigation. It is located in a natural village that is developing a rural resort. The parking lot is on the side of the hotel. After parking the car, pulling the suitcase, listening to Xiao Zaizai shouting excitedly, walking along the wooden plank road in the field to the coffee shop where the front desk is located, I immediately relaxed. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs due to limited manpower. I arrived after 2:00 pm and waited 40 minutes for the room to be cleaned up. Fortunately, the afternoon tea delivered to the room eased my mood. The hot pot set meal booked in the evening is still very worthwhile. The food is very fresh. There are endless snacks for two people and one person. It feels more suitable for the normal meal size of 3-4 adults. During the stay at the hotel, it happened to catch up with the first rainstorm after the plum season, and I slept soundly listening to the sound of the rain hitting the roof all night. I feel that the triangular house can live in three or one small (children and parents share the same bed). There are also villa-style guest rooms at the back. I heard that it may open around July. It is estimated that it is suitable for a large family or a few friends to travel together. Walking along the river, going down to the river beach to feel the river at close range, looking for small crabs, and seeing small butterflies in the fields, it is very relaxing. It will be better when there are more peripheral developments and more activities suitable for children. I hope to have the opportunity to stay in the lotus leaf house again next time.
