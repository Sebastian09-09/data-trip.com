The time we spent in the room was great but the hotel fee doesn’t include anything and the extras are very expensive. Although the building is right on Tianfu Square and metro line 1, there wasn’t a lot to do near the hotel. We did enjoy riding bikes back to the hotel and the comfortable nights sleep. Overall I think it was too expensive for the limited time we spent there.

msg:My recent stay at this Chengdu hotel was nothing short of exceptional, and I have several reasons to rave about it:

To begin with, the hotel's location is undeniably prime, nestled right in the heart of Chengdu. This central position made it incredibly convenient for exploring the city's vibrant offerings. Remarkably, it's also one of the best hotels I've had the pleasure of staying in under $200 USD, offering exceptional value for the discerning traveler.

While the check-in lobby proved slightly confusing to navigate, the hotel staff went above and beyond to assist and guide me to the correct destination. Once there, the check-in process was an absolute breeze, and to my delight, they even presented me with a lovely souvenir to take back home as a memento of my stay.

The hotel itself exuded a modern and tastefully decorated ambiance, which immediately caught my eye. The room numbers, designed with charming creativity, added a touch of whimsy to the experience.

The bathroom featured state-of-the-art amenities, including heated seats, making it an oasis of comfort and luxury. The bed was irresistibly fluffy, and the efficient AC kept the room refreshingly cool during the summer.

I particularly appreciated the hotel's thoughtfully curated color scheme, which added to the overall aesthetic appeal. The room's layout was well-planned, maximizing both functionality and comfort.

In summary, staying at this Chengdu hotel was an absolute delight, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. With its prime location, exceptional value, modern decor, and well-appointed amenities, it offers an unforgettable experience that you won't regret.

I took my daughter to Chengdu for a vacation and found a hotel in the city center. The Chengdu Museum is opposite the hotel. It is not far from Kuanzhai Alley and Chunxi Road. There are buses and bicycles at the door that can go directly to it. It is quite convenient. The facilities are still very new. The hotel is clean and hygienic. The service is very good. The doorman will take the initiative to help with the suitcase. The hotel gave a small mahjong gift. The hotel lobby is on the 31st floor. We live on the 26th floor. The privacy of customers is very well protected. Every time you have to take the 31st floor first to get to the floor you live in from the hotel's own elevator. And the elevator card cannot be swiped to other floors. It can only be swiped to the floor you live in. Auntie will come to help with cleaning every day and help clean up the garbage. I stayed for four days. Overall, I am very satisfied. I will stay again next time I come to play.

There are many restrictions on the use of two drink coupons, which I returned to your hotel. I asked the restaurant and hotel switchboard number, but I was shocked that they didn't know. In addition, there are many mosquitoes in the hotel. I suggest not to stay if you bring children."

1. Excellent location! Located near Tianfu Square, opposite the Chengdu Museum, and only a 10-15 minute walk to Chunxi Road and Taikoo Li;
2. The front desk service is proactive and friendly! They take the initiative to introduce hotel facilities and give special gifts. Mahjong is a small gift that is very popular. In addition, the store's unique panda is also very good!
3. Gathering of delicious food nearby! Chunxi Road and East Street are the gathering places for Chengdu's major Internet celebrity hotpots. I recommend Xiaolong Fan Dajiang. The overall design is antique, full of ritual, and the taste is good.
4. The price/performance ratio is pretty good, especially recommended in the off-season.

The room heater was very hot and the temperature could not be adjusted. It was set at around 25 degrees. The front desk said that the entire building had not been cooled yet, so it could not be adjusted. The air in the room was very dry
The sewer in the room toilet would smell bad every morning when I woke up, and then the toilet smell would fill the whole room. Even in the morning, I could smell the sewer smell in the lobby, but after noon, after the waiter cleaned the room, the smell would ease
The hotel reception is on the 31st floor and all rooms are below the 31st floor, which means that every time I go back to the room, I need to take the elevator to the 31st floor first and then take another elevator downstairs

The hotel called in advance, specifically asked about our room needs, and arranged a suitable room for us. The transportation around is very convenient for eating and shopping.

msg:With two kids, it’s great to live here. Across the road from the hotel is the Chengdu Museum and the Sichuan Science and Technology Museum. The room is large and the bed is wide. It’s not crowded at all. The breakfast is rich. I will stay here next time I bring my parents here. The staff are considerate and enthusiastic. Overall, I am satisfied with everything. The two kids were jumping around the room and didn't want to go out.
The only problem is that it has been too hot in the room these two days. It is the Spring Festival now, so why is it still so hot even if the air conditioner is turned off. The child went into the room and *****ped down to his autumn clothes and long trousers and was still sweating. It was so hot at night that he slept with the door open and the windows open. . . . The staff was very nice and offered to bring some ice cubes to cool down, but it was a drop in the bucket. It is recommended that this problem should be solved so that it does not affect the check-in experience.

msg:The check-in experience is very good. There are many Hilton hotels. Except for the average appearance of this hotel, everything else is definitely in line with the price. It is a very good five-star hotel. I like the design of the hotel very much, and the attitude at the front desk is very good. When I first came here When I checked in, I was given a free floor upgrade (although I didn’t seem to use it, but the service attitude made me feel good). The gifts were very unique and interesting.
The room is really good, and the view is amazing, but the prerequisite is the Tianfu Room... Originally, I didn't go there just for the view, but the park view is really too abstract, and it looks like the parking lot downstairs of the company. , I was sweating profusely, and put it in Picture 4, so I went down and upgraded to the Tianfu Panorama, which cost 700. Unfortunately, it seems that there is no high-altitude Tianfu, otherwise I can save some money. This is the only dissatisfaction this time. I feel that it should be renamed the guest room. It really doesn’t count. View room
Also, this tea set looks weird when opened. I’m not sure if that’s how it looks and then it’s useless, so I won’t comment on it.


Facilities: Very good, but there are some small flaws in the bathroom decoration, but it doesn't matter
Hygiene: very good
Environment: Very good. I definitely give it a good review overall because the panoramic view of Tianfu is really beautiful.
Service: The attitude of the waiters at the front desk and the cafe is very good. The afternoon tea is also delicious and very professional.
2 cocktails/night at designated Gaokangfang Lounge: delicious
You can take away 2 cups of fragrant coffee: it tastes good after the afternoon tea.

msg:Let’s talk about the advantages first: good location, in the city center. Downstairs, you can walk 200 meters to Tianfu Square, Science and Technology Museum, Art Museum, Chengdu Museum, and People's Park. You can also walk to the Kuanzhai Alley and the subway station at the door. The concierge guy was very enthusiastic in helping me with my luggage, I’m very grateful! There are robots that deliver food.

Let’s talk about the shortcomings: 1. The hotel’s main entrance is at the back and it’s hard to find. The lobby is on the 31st floor. You have to go to the 31st floor first and then change to the elevator to go to the room floor. When leaving the hotel, you have to go to the 31st floor first and then change to the elevator to go downstairs, which is very inconvenient. 2. The hotel breakfast has relatively few varieties and the taste is very average, not at the average level in Chengdu. 3. Due to a mishandling by the hotel, the room deposit was fully refunded, but they actually called my work. I was speechless. They knew my phone number and email address, so what was the procedure for calling my work? 4. During the processing, a self-proclaimed hotel staff asked me to transfer money via WeChat, which is an operation for a five-star hotel fan.

The biggest feeling is that it is full of design and small details!

From the entrance to the lobby, and even inside the room, every detail shows the word "carefulness"! Some are purely art and decoration, while others are very practical. For example, JBL speakers, yoga mats, and a small mailbox for check-out📮

Located in Tianfu Square, it is convenient to travel. The room is quite large and very comfortable to live in. And it’s not expensive, can you afford it?

It’s just that the panda holding the room number at the door is a bit uncute, like the old lady in "Tales from the Heavenly Book"... I pulled off its hat and covered its head, and it suddenly became much cuter🤪

I highly recommend everyone to give it a try! A comfortable stay with all kinds of little surprises! !

Although the scenery is good, most of the view is blocked by the building opposite (maybe it is because I live not high enough). The other is towards the park. In fact, the park is not close, but because there is no obstruction, the view is surprisingly good. The hotel has floor-to-ceiling windows, so the viewing angles outside are very good.

It is only a few minutes away from the museums, science and technology museums, art galleries, and art galleries around Tianfu Square. Breakfast is served in the restaurant on the 31st floor. The variety is very rich, the scenery is beautiful, and the hotel management is in place. Susu, Xiaoli, Xiaozhu at the front desk and the young concierge at the door are all very enthusiastic.

Although the floor is high, the shower water pressure is very strong. The overall layout of the room is clean and tidy. It is worthy of being opened in recent years.
There are also points that need to be complained about.
There is an office building next door, and the hotel rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows. Some rooms face the office building directly (the hotel upgraded me to a different room the next day, so I avoided this problem). You cannot open the curtains or screens, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing. There are also some rooms where the bathroom window screen cannot completely cover the glass window (this small area does not have a privacy sticker). I think this needs to be resolved quickly.

msg:Let me talk about the advantages first:
1. From the doorman to the lobby to the maintenance, all the hotel staff are very enthusiastic. Especially the guy wearing glasses in the lobby on the 31st floor helped me solve the problems I encountered in living several times, and also gave me good recommendations when I was looking for local food. Because of this, I still give this hotel a five-star rating overall.
2. The location of the hotel is excellent, close to Tianfu Square, and the night view of the square can be clearly photographed from the room I stayed in last. It is only a Xiyu Street away from the Chengdu Museum, and it is only a few hundred meters or a kilometer to the Sichuan Art Museum and Sichuan Science and Technology Museum. The subway is under Tianfu Square, and there is only one stop to Chunxi Road. There are many gourmet spots within one kilometer of Tianfu Square’s underground space, Tianfuhong Building and the surrounding area, such as Chicken Feather Vegetables and Bashu Dajiang (recommended by the guy wearing glasses in the hotel). They are generally not as famous as the Chunxi Road gourmet restaurant, but they are mainly for customers. It's the locals, while Chunxi Road is mostly for tourists.
3. The food provided by the restaurant on the 31st floor of the hotel is worthy of praise. There are not many varieties of buffet breakfast but the taste is good. The dinner in the restaurant is exquisite and delicious, especially the large portion. It is no problem for four people to eat a Western-style set meal for three people. The price is much higher than that of social restaurants, but you get what you pay for.
4. The hotel is known as a "designer hotel". No matter the design of the lobby on the 31st floor or the design of the rooms, there is indeed a lot of thought, and my child likes it very much.
Let's talk about the problem again:
The Chinese name of the hotel has the word "Hilton", while the English name "canopy" shows that it is a sub-brand of Hilton. This store in Chengdu is the first in Asia, but whether it is the main brand or a sub-brand, it should be a hotel There is no doubt that it is a high-end hotel, but when I checked in, I encountered some small problems that a high-end hotel should not have.
I had two rooms, one for myself and one for my wife and children. First, there was a problem with the air conditioner in my room, which made the corridor outside the house cooler than the room. The maintenance engineer came to fix it and brought in a floor fan, but it took about four or five hours from checking in in the afternoon to returning to the room after dinner in the evening, and the temperature still didn't drop, so I had to pack my luggage and change rooms.
In the room of the wife and children, I found that there were no slippers at first, and then I found that the TV could only be turned on manually but could not be turned on with the remote control. Before going to bed, I found that the door between the bedroom and the bathroom could not be closed. Since the door of the bathroom is facing the side of the bed, the wife and children feel that they are facing a door that cannot be closed in the dark, and they always feel a little nervous. Turning on the bathroom light will affect sleep, so they have to ask the hotel maintenance master to repair the door. The door was repaired at the time, but it would not close again the next day.
If I encountered one or two small problems, it might be a coincidence, but I encountered so many small problems, which made me a little dissatisfied with this hotel experience. Although these small problems were raised by me with the main station, the hotel quickly sent people to solve them, and the service of the relevant personnel was also very enthusiastic. However, flaws do not conceal virtues, "flaws" exist after all.
Finally, I want to emphasize that although there are many minor problems, my family is very satisfied with the service quality of all the hotel staff. I will still choose this hotel when I come to Chengdu next time.

msg:Advantages: Good location, next to Tianfu Square, opposite Chengdu Museum, and across the road from Metro Exit C.
Disadvantages: 1/Can't find the door. I came out of Exit C of the subway and stood downstairs of the hotel. I didn't know that the hotel was in front of me because the hotel sign didn't face the main road on the subway side. I read in the comments that someone took a taxi, but the driver couldn't find the hotel door. 2/I feel like I don’t deserve to stay in this hotel. I casually told the front desk that the hotel entrance was difficult to find. She was surprised to hear that I came by subway. Could it be that I could only stay in the hotel by taking the Maybach? I just came down from the Golden Summit of Mount Emei. The hotels on the top of the mountain are more expensive than here, so I stayed there too. 3/ The front desk saw that I booked the room through Ctrip and kept trying to promote an upgraded room type for ➕250. How stupid the hotel management is. If they want to make more money and don’t want to be ****** by the platform, they just set up a WeChat official account to sell directly. This is what Changlong does. They ignore the platform and give breakfast to individual guests. Only by giving away profits can customers be loyal. The platform only values ​​profits. 4/The most annoying thing was that I went to have breakfast on the day before I left. After sitting down for 15 minutes, when I went to get my food, a waiter took away my table. Oh my god, the food I just picked up was thrown away before I even touched it. This is such a waste. I felt once again that I didn't deserve to stay in this hotel. They even refused to let me eat the breakfast I paid for! 5/As soon as I entered the room, the empty bowl decoration at the door made me happy, because I brought a bamboo stick for hunting monkeys from Mount Emei... This hotel was really thoughtful and filled the bowl for me. Upgrading to the elder of the Beggar Clan scared me so much that I quickly found a corner to throw away the bamboo stick when I went out. I stayed at the DoubleTree by Hilton Chengdu last week. DoubleTree's big white lights were on on the top of the building and at the gate. The hotel could be found as far away as 500 meters and as close as 5 meters away. Doubletree's breakfast room has a double-sided occupied/available sign on the table, which can avoid the misunderstanding of closing the table before finishing the meal. I sat in the lobby of DoubleTree for a while, and a waiter immediately brought me lemonade. It is said that Canopy is a bit higher than DoubleTree. It seems that I am not worthy of Canopy. When I was writing this review, I couldn't help but miss the monkey stick I threw away. It cost 10 bucks. I originally wanted to take it home as a family heirloom, but Jiayueli was making fun of me secretly, so I had to throw it away secretly.

The transportation is convenient, 30 minutes by taxi to Shuangliu Airport, just beside Tianfu Square, it is very convenient to go anywhere in the city center;
The configuration of the room is very good, the bedding is comfortable;
For breakfast, there are Internet celebrity biscuits across the road, which are lined up every day. It’s a surprise; the 100 yuan drink coupon is just right for dinner, which is very good
The next business trip will stay in the hotel.

The hotel rooms, lobby and breakfast area are all on high floors, directly overlooking Tianfu Square with a first-class view. Then I was pleasantly surprised that we kept receiving gifts. The hotel gave us welcome fruit baskets, a 🐼 doll for the children, and a mahjong tile as a souvenir 🤞The only downside is that the breakfast variety is limited, but this is the center of Chengdu, everywhere It's all snacks, so it doesn't matter that much.

A hotel of this level should have the obligation to remind customers when checking in or provide disposable earplugs. The return call shirks responsibility and only blames the problem on external factors without trying to solve the problem. Is this the service standard of a five-star hotel?

Although the room was successfully changed later. However, the room I changed to was small, the window area was also very small, the room was very dark, and the overall experience was not good. Because I took the child and didn't want to make a fuss, I barely stayed. Breakfast seriously does not match the level of the hotel, but fortunately, there are not many people dining every day. Restaurant waiters respond slowly and have poor service awareness. The cleaning of the room is not satisfactory, and it always deliberately changes the user's usage habits, which is very speechless. The overall advantage is that the location is very good, it is convenient to go everywhere, there is Lawson downstairs, the subway is just across the street, and you can take a walk in Tianfu Square at night

Environment: The location is excellent. Tianfu Square is within walking distance. Opposite is the Grand Theater, like Jinli, Wenshu Monastery, Du Fu Thatched Cottage, Chunxi Road, and Kuanzhai Alley. These must-see attractions are all within a reasonable distance. If you go home and do some errands, you will still stay here

Facilities: The hotel is very new and well maintained. There are many modern design elements. It is lively, interesting and comfortable to live in. It is clean, hygienic and spacious
The front desk is polite and cute. There was an episode. I ordered a takeaway to get rid of the hotel robot song. I hesitated. I didn’t pay attention to the time until six minutes passed. I thought it took a long time to call the front desk and ask, "The little robot has short legs and is on the way.." It’s so cute.
Thank you Xiaoli for your thoughtful and thoughtful stay at home

The simple and modern design style, combined with the strong Sichuan-Chongqing culture, makes the overall hotel style unique among many competing products, whether it is geographical location, transportation, Scenery and shopping are the best choices.
Indoor orange collocation makes people feel happy!
The gym is not big, but! Not many people!
With transparent dry and wet separation, I feel that the room fee is well worth it!
Tips: When you stay in the hotel, you will get a mini mahjong. If you make up 12 sets, you can exchange it for a whole set. Be careful not to lose it.
Finally, I would like to thank the staff: Li Hongying for the return visit after the night, and kindly informed the members' rights and interests, and the brand's intimacy is full.
In the end, when you come to Chengdu for business trip, honeymoon, and travel, Hilton has many, but there is only one territory

I reported this to the front desk when I checked out, and then I left my tablet in the room. I found it myself. I feel like the aunt who did the cleaning didn’t tell the front desk staff.

Hygiene: clean and tidy, the corner is also very clean,
Environment: The whole hotel feels very new, with a good a**osphere. This time I am on a business trip alone, and the hotel is also very private and safe. Girls don’t have to worry about staying alone
Service: Xiaobai, a hotel staff member, knew that I was on a business trip alone, so he helped deliver the luggage throughout the journey. It was very good, and the breakfast was delicious.
If you have the opportunity to come to Chengdu again, you will definitely choose this place

I tossed and turned until three o'clock in the middle of the night before I managed to fall asleep. I don't know if it was because the quilt hadn't been aired for a long time or if it wasn't cleaned properly. The next day I found that my arms There are rows of small red dots on my legs and thighs, not sure if they are bugs or allergies. The room was relatively spacious, which was the only advantage, but the sofa was broken and the wooden frame creaked.
The most terrible thing is the service. I don’t know if the night service staff have been trained. They don’t take the initiative to say hello. You have to wait in line for more than ten minutes to check in. If you need it, it takes more than half an hour to respond to the front desk. Even if you ask for ice water, it is room temperature. Water, I didn't need anything, and the staff made me understand. I'm sorry, I can't understand people who can't do their jobs well. The hotel management is loose and details are missing. If you don't review yourself, you still let the guests understand? ?
The most annoying Hilton and the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The nearby Wanda Marriott Ritz-Carlton Temple House is much better than it!
Especially if you are traveling with the elderly and children, it is not recommended to stay at this place, as it will cause trouble to yourself.

msg:Originally, I didn't want to live in the city center because I was afraid of traffic jams, but I hadn't lived in a canopy before and said I would give it a try. It was a pleasant surprise! I had a good impression from the moment I entered the door. As soon as I entered the arrival lobby, the concierge took the initiative to pick up the luggage and sent it to the elevator. He also reminded us that the temperature suddenly dropped today and we should keep warm.
The check-in and check-out speed at the front desk is very fast. The next day's flight is at night, and the lady at the front desk offered to help delay the check-out time, so that you can go directly to the airport when you check out. I tried the rocking chair in the lobby lounge area, which is quite comfortable.
I chose a park-view room, which is spacious and has floor-to-ceiling glass windows overlooking the entire People's Park, but the weather has been greyish for the past two days. The main color of the decoration is orange, which is my favorite, youthful and energetic, and the music on the TV screen is summer eyes from airplanes. The sound effect of the room is one of the best in the domestic hotels I have stayed in. The high-power jbl is very enjoyable for watching movies and listening to music.
The corridor is also orange, and the room number is so cute being held in the hands of Kung Fu Panda. The power switch is very user-friendly, and there is an automatic induction key to turn on the light, which is very convenient at night. The smart toilet is equipped with a touch screen and has complete functions.
The day I stayed happened to be the Lantern Festival, and the hotel also sent sweet Lantern Festival, which was very heartwarming. Next time I come to Chengdu, I will definitely go back and live here.

Every time I go on a business trip, I am afraid that the itinerary will change, so I always book a room with one order a day. This is the first trip after the epidemic is released. I have forgotten my previous habits, so I will book for three days at once. When the itinerary changes At that time, I wanted to leave the hotel one day in the middle and check in one day later. When I asked if I could change the check-in date by paying the difference, the hotel rejected my request, and Ctrip failed to communicate. Of course, this is caused by the guests themselves and has nothing to do with the hotel. However, if you try to provide convenience to the guests without damaging the interests of the hotel, the guests will also thank the hotel. This is the third time to stay at Hilton. Overall, the design of this hotel is very distinctive. Those who haven't stayed here can experience it. The hotel has convenient transportation, near the subway entrance.

Highly recommended, worth staying in, and will come again next time.

The overall space and visual feeling are very good. The front desk confirmed my room preferences with me before checking in. When I checked in, I was pleasantly surprised to find essential oils, and the rooms were furnished in advance. Recently, there has been a power cut and high temperature in Chengdu, but the ice cola served by the concierge at the front desk instantly cooled down the hot heart. The check-in procedure at the front desk is also simple and efficient, and the room card must be prepared in advance.
The layout of the room is reasonable, and I like the bedding and toiletries, which is why I stay here every time I come to Chengdu. Chengdu hotel word-of-mouth must-stay list, still a bit expected, recommended!

The cleaning aunt is very enthusiastic and like a friend. I have been very happy these days and asked me to come again next time. In the end, I also sent breakfast and the manager (the handsome guy who was fat and tall) to the airport. He used a private car to take our family to the second floor of the airport and helped us with our luggage. I was tired all the way. full of shouts! It's really caring~ and the female manager also gave a lot of toys to the children during the stay! In short! If there is a chance, I will come again. I hope that Chengdu will overcome the difficulties as soon as possible! ~~

Even after staying there for two consecutive days, no one came to fix the leaks. 2. The most popular thing is that the air conditioner in the room can only be adjusted to 16/17 degrees and cannot be set any higher than outside. The corridors and lobby are cold! It was very cold in Chengdu during those two days! After the reaction, the engineering staff came to take a look and said, the panel in your room is broken and you can't adjust it yourself. If it's too cold, I will go backstage to adjust the temperature for you... Then, it continued to be 16 degrees. It was so cold at night.

msg:Worst stay experience ever! Allergic reaction started 10 minutes after entering the room. The long eyelids quickly spread to the whole body, and the throat edema gradually became difficult to breathe. I could not stay for a minute. I said hello to the front desk and checked out and quickly went to the third people nearby. The dermatology depar**ent of the hospital visited the doctor. The doctor diagnosed acute allergy and needed to take medicine immediately. It was not ruled out that it was an acute reaction caused by excessive formaldehyde or mites. Fortunately, after taking the hormone pills, the condition gradually stabilized. Back to the hotel, the reaction was very uncomfortable, so my husband went to the front desk to negotiate the situation. It was only 10 minutes after entering the room. My husband took a shower and wanted to discuss whether the front desk could check out for us free of charge. The front desk staff said at that time If you only use the bathroom, you can handle it for us. Later, when we called when we were in the hospital, we changed the statement, saying that after the bathroom was used, we could not go back, and the bed was used (we didn’t even lift the quilt on the bed at all). It’s completely different from what I said before. What’s chilling is that no hotel staff asked me about my condition during the whole process, and I’m not a vexatious person, but I did appear because I walked into the hotel room. This series of later events, originally planned to play in Chengdu that night, left in the afternoon the next day, and finally got us to drive away from Chengdu overnight after seeing the disease. During the whole process, we stayed in the hotel like a big injustice. In 20 minutes, I spent more than 800 hotel room fees, the follow-up medical expenses, the reaction to the body caused by taking hormone pills, etc. I didn’t play or eat anything, and I was in no mood. Now I think about the hotel’s approach without any humanity. It can be said that it is a five-star hotel anyway, so where is your service?

The decoration of the room and the decoration of the hotel lobby tell each other the history of Chengdu, and it seems that the ancient city wall bricks can still be seen vaguely. In the afterglow of the setting sun, the orange and golden sunset in the lobby complement each other, and this beauty is an unforgettable experience during your stay. The facilities in the room are also very good. There are technological products and humanized designs. The bedding is very comfortable. The staff of the hotel are very friendly, among them, CHARON at the front desk made me feel respect and enthusiasm when talking with me, and also patiently asked me how I felt during my stay when I checked out; the service of managers Doris and ingrid was also very professional and actively provided The help I need. In short, this hotel is very cost-effective in terms of service and other hardware facilities, and I will continue to choose to stay here in the future!

First of all, in the Ctrip review, people's comments + photos attached to the park viewing room can also see Tianfu Square. Then their front desk was the day before my stay. When I asked me what I needed, I said I could see Tianfu Square if it was a little higher, and then the other end of the phone said that the room type you booked couldn’t see Tianfu Square, then I said that it would be a little higher, and I wouldn’t be able to see it because this room can be 23 Floor - 30 floors choose to wait for me to check in on the same day. Their other front desk saw my needs and said that the room type I booked could not choose a very high floor and then said that now they have a high-altitude view of Tianfu, but they have to pay the difference, then I paid the difference. The room given to me is exactly the same as what I saw on Ctrip, so where is the experience of the difference I paid more? If you want to say that the park viewing room can't be on the 30th floor, what's the point of saying that you can choose 23-30? It's that the next time you come to travel, you should not choose to stay in this hotel.

The ground is always wet. I call the cleaning service every night. The staff are very in place and very patient with the children.
What I didn't expect is that every day we go out and come back, our clothes are neatly folded, everything is neatly tidied up, and what needs to be replenished will be replenished. Really great!
In the end, the room was very clean, and the toilets were all electric. Knowing that the bathtub covers we brought were used up, they offered them to us. Our family lived very comfortably.

msg:The environmental facilities are okay, but the service is really uncomplimentable. From the moment I checked in, I felt that the experience was extremely poor. The whole front desk was alone and was still dealing with other guests' problems. After I arrived, I didn't say hello, at least I'm sorry to let me wait for a while. , as a result, I greeted the previous guest as if I hadn't come and answered a phone call, making me stand there and wait for seven or eight minutes before it was my turn. Calculate. I placed an order from Ctrip, but the hotel didn't tell me to deduct the room fee when they charged me the deposit, and only half of the check-out deposit was refunded, so I called and asked, saying that Ctrip would return it within three working days. Give me the initial order, but I just asked Ctrip's customer service, and I didn't receive a notice from the hotel that Ctrip would return the money to me. Isn't this a problem with the hotel's communication? If I hadn't suddenly thought of asking Ctrip, someone would have told me when the money would be returned to me.
  This is not what annoys me the most. I go to its western restaurant for lunch the next day, and I will not comment on the taste It's all a small problem. Of course, there was also a waiter who said to change it, but I really can't eat this steak for the second time. The problem is that my boyfriend and I both felt very uncomfortable in the stomach half an hour after the meal, and then I also called the hotel in time to tell the matter, and I didn't say how to make you pay for the meal, at least You have to have an attitude to deal with things. At first, I said to take a sample of the meal we ate that day to check if there was any problem. You said that there was no problem with your meal after the test. Later, when I asked you for a test report, you said no, but just checked the source of the food and whether it was disinfected. Not paying compensation is secondary. You don't even have the most basic attitude. You keep playing football, which really makes me feel a little outrageous. When I chose to wish you a hotel, it was for service, and this happened, or Does that mean you don't take food safety seriously at all? Or that your Hilton is so good that you don't need service as a sign?

msg:A very, very bad stay, even in retrospect it is downright infuriating. Successfully refreshed my disappoin**ent with Hilton Hotels.

First of all, I checked out on the morning of February 12, because the check-out time may be relatively early, so yesterday afternoon I went to the lobby on the 31st floor and asked the staff in the lobby if there would be any difficulties or inconvenience . At that time, the staff replied that there was no problem, saying that Canopy by Hilton had a 24-hour check-out.
At that time, because I got a positive reply, I booked a flight ticket at 7 o'clock in the morning on the 12th. But on the morning of the 12th, the strangest thing happened. There was a sudden power outage in the entire building, which was said to be for electrical maintenance, but there was no power supply even for the elevators. This caused the elderly at home with their children to be at a loss in the elevator that suddenly ran out of power. Even when I tried to contact them, I found that even the mobile phone signal industry had disappeared. After dozens of minutes of trying, I managed to get in touch with my family and children. During this process, I also tried to communicate with the staff in the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, hoping that the maintenance personnel of the power company could be faster, so as not to frighten the elderly and children too much. But those maintenance personnel said that they did not carry the corresponding access control card, so they had to wait for other personnel to arrive before they could perform maintenance, and the hotel duty personnel on the first floor knew nothing about the Hilton Hotel. In the end, the Hilton staff actually let the elderly and children in my family walk down the stairs on the 31st floor with three large pieces of luggage. The weight-bearing caused the elderly to vomit, faint, and have difficulty in behavior after arriving at the airport.
What annoys me the most and what I find unacceptable is the chaotic service management of Canopy by Hilton Hotel. It feels like a small hotel on the side of the road. After letting the elderly and children walk down from the 31st floor, the staff We didn't say sorry, didn't express any apology, very indifferent.
Secondly, it is normal for hotels or office buildings to carry out regular power maintenance, but a safe and qualified building will automatically switch to the backup power supply when the power is slightly repaired to ensure the normal operation of elevators and public passages. And Hilton obviously doesn't have this backup power supply. I don’t know that a hotel that doesn’t even restore the backup power supply is not a hotel that can ensure the safety of the guests. Should it continue to advertise itself as a five-star luxury hotel? Very bad check-in experience, everyone should avoid lightning

Check out early because of the epidemic, and it will be refunded in full, which is still very humane. Next time I have a chance, I will live here.

The hotel is very new, the room is big, the single bed is big, and it is very comfortable to fall asleep. I just don't like the design of the 31st floor in the lobby. I have to take the elevator twice to get in, which is a bit troublesome.

The breakfast in the hotel is not bad, not many varieties, but the taste is quite good, there is a special place for children to take food, the children like it very much.

I hope that the hotel will be more relaxed about children's breakfast, and the attractions say that babies less than 1 meter 3 can be free of charge.

The style of the hotel gives people a young and fashionable feeling.
The hardware is perfect except for the absence of a swimming pool.
The room is large with a wide view. Equipped with smart toilet, shower and bathtub are available, the bed is very comfortable, and a good night’s sleep.

The breakfast is very rich: coffee, black tea, milk, bread, specialty snacks, porridge, noodles, fruits, vegetables, salads, meats, etc. The most important thing is that the taste is quite good, and there is no problem if you are full.

In particular, I want to say that this hotel has excellent service! It gave me a perfect check-in experience! When I first arrived at the hotel, the uncle on the first floor helped with the luggage and guided them all the way to the elevator entrance; the cleaning aunts who met on the aisle every day would greet me actively; I had breakfast in the restaurant, Miss Joey saw me with a camera, and felt I liked it Photographing, I will take the initiative to tell me when to take the sunrise and sunset from the hotel and what angle, the burning clouds will be particularly beautiful, and I also took the initiative to share the photos taken by her, very kind; there is also the front desk lady Debbie who will be magical, let me do this No regrets during this stay, and gave me a 100% satisfactory experience!
I am really grateful to every staff member I met for their cordial and friendly service, which made me glad that I chose the right hotel!

Canopy, my home in Chengdu!

msg:The location of the hotel is good, Tianfu Square is just downstairs, the service is really disturbing. I booked a room with two breakfasts for two nights. One night, my husband couldn’t sleep well and couldn’t get up in the morning. I went to breakfast at 10 o’clock and wanted to pack a bag. The manager of the restaurant said with distrust that we were open until 10:30, so he couldn’t get up. come? Well, you follow me back to my room at 10:30 to have a look? After talking for a long time, we can only pack bread and fruit. We have been exercising for many years and never eat high-sugar carbohydrates. I asked if I could change eggs, and said that the hotel has regulations. Well, I understand that you must abide by your regulations and take responsibility for food safety. Take a statement of a few hundred words long, let me sign it and put it on deposit, and list the contents of the package. Eggs, are your eggs poisonous? You have to sign, and you are responsible. Asked me how many eggs, I said four, the manager looked at me with distrust and asked: Can I finish the four eggs? Well, I patiently explained that he has high cholesterol, works out, and only eats protein. It's not that I can't explain it, it's just that her questioning demeanor made me feel that I paid the hotel room rate including double breakfast fee, and now I'm cheating a few eggs. When it was over, I was left hanging at the door of the restaurant, and I asked if I couldn't go in to eat, and I said go in. After eating, I went to get the packed breakfast, four hard-boiled eggs, and nothing. I have no interest in talking to any of them anymore. In addition, there are very few types of breakfast. We stayed in three provinces for half a month, and there were no less than five five-star hotels. None of them had such a bad breakfast. There were also people who didn’t get up for breakfast. I also knew the food packing regulations of five-star hotels, but most of them were friendly and kind. Solved, no one has ever been hungry, let alone such a disturbing experience. It can only be said that an Internet celebrity is an Internet celebrity, and the form is greater than the content. This is only one time, and I will not live again.

位置優越，周圍就是天府廣場，美術館，科技館，博物館，吃的更是超多
餐飲業都很不錯，特別給我推薦了每天中午的單人套餐，做的很好吃，經濟實惠
員工服務態度特別好，前台每次見面都會熱情的打招呼，checkin和out也都問了很多關心的問題
這次是出差，如果下次再到成都遊玩或者差旅我也一定會選擇，也會推薦給更多的朋友來嘗試

建議：
1-把穿尾的凳子最好是做成全包裹的，半夜起夜把腿給磕了，很難受
2-會有售後電話非常理解，希望能有好評。我説了腿磕的這事兒沒啥安慰，還是在要好評。畢竟也是他們工作，相互理解吧

最後，忘了拿走給的小麻將的禮物有點遺憾~下次有機會再去，把小紀念品帶走~

我半夜十二點到的，然後明確告知他們這犯了我住宿大忌的情況下，依舊半夜不依不饒帶我看房確認，還讓我自己補差價升級，實在離譜

我不是要佔你升級的便宜，衹是大半夜的，在你們有錯的情況下，居然要我加錢升級實屬離譜

作為希爾頓榮譽會員，你們其他城市房型有空甚至會主動升級，怎麼半夜到你們這裏就不依不饒帶我看房，還讓我加錢升級呢？

最後投訴了才退升級費。

這家我住了好幾次了，實在心寒，本來來成都必住的一家酒店。

需要表揚前台服務小麗，貼心關懷
還有一樓的前台小妹妹，看見購物袋多了主動要送上樓，這點在以前的任何一個知名酒店沒有遇到過，必須重點表揚。後來覺得太麻煩她沒讓她送，讓機器人送上樓

此次是家庭出遊，帶小孩去成都遊玩，去之前對天府廣場附近的五星級酒店做了一個比較，最終選擇了希爾頓酒店。入住的第一天，發生了一點小小的不愉快，但是前台客服小麗的禮貌、耐心和誠懇讓我釋懷，也展現出了希爾頓應有的服務水平，必須給予五星好評。
後續幾天在成都的遊玩，這個傳説中安逸的城市，也確實給我留下了非常好的印象，尤其是大多數成都司機那種不急於爭搶的態度，讓我這個來自珠三角的遊客感歎。以後有機會還要再來成都，再住希爾頓酒店。

總體來説還是挺滿意的，下次換個季節還願意再來體驗一下。

入住時説要景觀好一點的方向，（明明有前台説天府廣場方向很好看），辦理入住的人員卻説另外一邊跟開陽沒有建築物阻擋，入住卻衹是看到一堆矮小的居民樓天頂！！天府廣場方向很多景觀可觀！！
