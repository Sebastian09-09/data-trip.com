msg:We stayed at the Shangri-la after a week of being in Tibet. It was a nice change from the more Chinese style hotels we had stayed in and was ideal for the night before our flight out. The rooms are great and we booked one with a bath. The shower was very powerful and hot. The breakfast buffet was, by Chinese standards, decent for western options and the evening buffer was good for approx 200rmb/person if you're in need of more western options.

The big plus for me was the gym. Decent by most hotel standards and had a good mix of resistance machines, cardio and free weights (mainly dumbbells of up to 20kg plus a pair of 27.5kg). The only thing missing from the gym really is a squat rack but otherwise very good. Would stay again.

msg:It’s one of the nicest hotel compare to other hotels in Tibet. Staff weren’t the friendliest people but they are okay. Sometimes there’s door man sometimes no. Corridor is carpeted so it’s hard to push the luggages but you can always ask the hotel staff to help you. Location is a bit far from where all the buzz is… but easy to take a didi to the main area. Overall you basically paid more for standard shangrila standard. Comfortable bed.

msg:I stayed in Lhasa for a total of four nights, and the last two nights were at Shangri-La Hotel. When I arrived at the hotel, I smelled the familiar fragrance of Shangri-La, and I felt safe and assured. Unlike other new Internet celebrity hotels, Shangri-La has achieved the feeling that a five-star hotel should provide to guests with its long-standing reputation worldwide. Lhasa Shangri-La is cost-effective, and the environmental design incorporates local ******* elements while maintaining the consistent style of Shangri-La. The service is a little different from Shangri-La in the mainland, but it is not easy in the local area. The service staff has given various responses very kindly and strives to provide better service.
Happy Hour and Luxury Club courtesy are also very powerful. Basically, three meals can be solved here. The hotel also provides oxygen cylinders and oxygen inhalation machines, which we all use. If you feel stuffy, you can ask the waiter to open the window.

msg:A very wise choice. I have been wanting to come to Lhasa for several years, but I have not been able to do so for various reasons. I chose it for a long time before coming this time. Because of the special altitude of Lhasa, I have always been afraid of altitude sickness. So I have to choose a hotel that is close to the scenic area, has an oxygen generator room, good sound insulation, and a medical room. Finally, I chose Shangri-La Hotel. It was really right. Before I checked in, Xiao Deng, the front desk of Shangri-La, called to ask me about my room requirements, told me some precautions for coming to Lhasa, and gave me breakfast for check-in. After checking in, I found that the room was relatively large, clean and odorless. The sound insulation effect was good, and I slept very well during my stay. I was almost embarrassed to ask Xiao Deng for two cans of oxygen every day. But taking oxygen out can indeed reduce altitude sickness. There is also a special oxygen bar on the first floor, which can relieve altitude sickness. There is an oxygen generator in the room, and later I asked for another one. Both of us can relieve altitude sickness, which is very good. The breakfast is also very rich, and the butter tea is delicious. Maybe everyone's experience of staying is different. But this is my real experience, and I hope it can help friends who want to come.

msg:Shangri-La is a high-end five-star hotel in Lhasa! I stayed for 2 nights in total, but I don't know why Ctrip only sent me breakfast for the next day. After Danny at the front desk understood my problem, he took the initiative to send me breakfast and upgraded my room. There is an oxygen concentrator in each room, which is very convenient. As for the noise, I feel that it is actually tolerable (of course, some people who are afraid of noise will still feel it). In fact, it is still very useful for me who came to Lhasa for the first time. After breathing oxygen, the oxygen saturation went up immediately. The lounge on the 3rd floor can overlook the Potala Palace, but it is a bit far away. Maybe it is the peak season recently. There are many people in the breakfast restaurant, so the experience is relatively average. The dishes are just the five-star standard in the mainland, and there is no problem in eating.
Finally, I would like to give a suggestion. Why is the room delivery menu all in English? I know that there are not many hotels in Lhasa that can receive foreign guests, but would it be better to give a menu in both Chinese and English?

I haven't had a strong altitude sickness yet
But it's really uncomfortable and I need to carry oxygen
The happiest thing at the moment is that I chose this hotel
The service is very good
Before I went there, the hotel front desk lady Xiao Deng contacted me by phone to ask if I had any requirements for the hotel and added WeChat~
Before Dida arrived at the hotel, she helped to turn on the room's feeding machine
After arriving at the hotel, I first upgraded the hotel room so that I could see the Potala Palace directly😆
Then she introduced the environment of the entire hotel, especially for hypoxia and physical discomfort. There is a medical room on the first floor where you can hang an IV and breathe oxygen, and there is also a 24-hour oxygen bar room on the first floor to ensure that there will be no problems during one person's trip😄
Overall, if you come to Lhasa alone, you don't have to worry too much, but you must be prepared in the early stage and prepare medicines. Shangri-La is really good in terms of hotels. After all, it is recommended that there is a medical room for feeding when you come to Lhasa for the first time. After all, Lhasa is at a high altitude and everything is based on the body.
Finally, I personally suggest that you don’t read Xiaohongshu before taking the train.
People with poor health will definitely fall ill on the train before reaching Lhasa.
Finally, I strongly praise Xiao Deng! ! ! The service is really great! ! !

It takes 50 minutes to take a taxi to the airport. There is an open-air terrace where you can have afternoon tea in the hotel, and you can overlook the Potala Palace in the distance, which is quite nice. The room layout is very ******* style, with an oxygen concentrator. There is an infirmary on the first floor of the hotel. If you feel uncomfortable, you can go there at any time. You can also rent oxygen tanks. Outside pharmacies and medical equipment stores do not rent oxygen tanks. They sell them directly. You can rent them 24 hours a day here. I am I only found out after I went to see a doctor when I wasn't feeling well. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, including ******* tsampa, butter tea, sweet tea, highland barley cakes, and handmade yogurt. You can try it. The fruits also change every day. Remember to eat more fruits with high sugar content in Tibet. I ate the special Medog stone pot yak beef at the hotel's Chinese restaurant Shang Palace. Two people can order half portion. The soup is very fragrant and the beef is delicious. Finally, let me talk about the hotel service staff. They are very enthusiastic. They will say hello when they see you and answer all your questions. Especially before you check into the hotel, a dedicated housekeeper will contact you and provide service and answers to the guests throughout the entire process. This is really good and makes people feel safe and secure. Our housekeeper is named Danya, which is great. We are in Lhasa. He was able to help us solve all our problems within three days, so thumbs up. I am very satisfied with my choice of Shangri-La when I came to Lhasa this time.

There are many varieties of breakfast. I have stayed in many five-star hotels at home and abroad. It can be said that Shangri-La is a pure five-star hotel.
In short, two words, recommended!

msg:I stayed at Shangri-La in Lhasa for two nights. When I checked in, the front desk gave me a room with a view of the Potala Palace. It was considered an upgrade. I was very happy at the time. I probably wanted to give it a five-star review, but the subsequent check-in experience was really unsatisfactory. . First of all, the room facilities are relatively old, and half of the curtains fell down as soon as they were pulled! Can you imagine? 6.7 hooks holding the curtains fell off one after another. Half of the curtains fell off and the windows could not be fully covered. Second, the oxygen machine in the room was extremely loud. It woke me up countless times throughout the night, and it also woke me up very early in the morning, making me unable to sleep. Third, the hot water is very slow. For hot water in bathtubs and sinks, you have to turn on the faucet and wait for more than ten minutes before warm water starts to come out. Fourth, breakfast is hard to describe. I have had terrible breakfasts, but I have never had such a breakfast where nothing is edible! Everything tastes really bad! In the end, I decided to just eat a bowl of noodles from the noodle stall as long as I was full. Who knew that bowls of noodles at the noodle stall were pre-made and placed there. . . . All muddled. . . The most speechless thing is that the entire breakfast room is very small, it is hard to find a seat, and the waiters don't care about you. If there is no space, you can find it yourself. They don't care about you. We finally found a seat and sat down to eat. A waiter came to clean the table next door. Unexpectedly, he put the large square basin with the cutlery on our table. Despite being completely shocked, I let out a cry of surprise. Phew, she started clearing the table next door on her own! At the same time, I also shouted and chatted with other colleagues! That big, dirty basin sat on our table for at least ten minutes! The dirty, chaotic and bustling scene is hard to imagine in a five-star hotel!

I asked the medical staff to come to the room for trea**ent at around 10 pm, and then I went to the medical room to get an altitude sickness injection for 780 yuan per person. It was amazing. Halfway through the injection, my headache and dizziness were gone, and I didn't vomit. My daughter's high fever also subsided after the injection.

Let me start with the conclusion: For those who need to visit scenic spots, Shangri-La is the first choice; for those who like to stay in the hotel and want to experience ******* culture, you can consider Songtsan; St. Regis will destroy your previous good impression of St. Regis

Location:
Shangri-La is close to the Tibet Museum, Norbulingka, and Potala Palace, which can be reached on foot. 5 stars
St. Regis is close to Barkhor Street, which can be reached on foot. 5 stars
Songtsan is far away. Except for watching the performance of Princess Wencheng, it is far away from everything. 3 stars

Service:
All service staff of Songtsan are ******* friends, which is unique, but the service details and processes are not very smooth. It is still a little weaker than international chains, but it wins in sincerity. 4 stars+

The service of St. Regis is acceptable, 5 stars

Shangri-La is very good. Generally, the service level in Tibet is worse than that in the mainland, but Shangri-La is not, especially the manager Nan Nan, who is very professional, meticulous and gentle. He almost responds to every request. Thank you very much 5 stars +

A small detail, my friend and I were on the same flight, and the subsequent flight was cancelled, so we needed to refund the first day's room fee. My friend stayed at St. Regis, and he had to get a delay certificate at the airport, but Shangri-La just sent a screenshot of the text message and immediately helped with the formalities. In terms of small details, Xiangxiang is obviously more humane

Hotel hardware and environment:

Songzan is the most distinctive, with pure *******-style small buildings like resort hotels, which are very beautiful and distinctive; I booked the Potala Palace Deluxe Suite, and the room has a small balcony, which is very impressive, but the so-called Potala Palace view is actually very small because it is far away, and a new house has been built in front of the hotel, which may be other hotels, and the view is blocked, not as good as the official picture. 5 stars

St. Regis is the most helpless to complain about. The Japanese designer obviously has a little misunderstanding of ******* architecture. The whole architectural style is very gloomy. Refer to the opening ceremony in Tokyo, and the room is also spooky. In addition, the hotel's daily maintenance is not very good. The wood in the elevator is peeling, the room curtains are very cheap, and the blinds are tied with black insulating tape when the rope is broken.

I can only say that the official photos of St. Regis are more 4 stars

Shangri-La is a modified ******* building, which is a combination of the conventional Shangri-La style and the ******* style, but I think it is just right, retaining the national characteristics while retaining modern comfort. It is worth mentioning that the hotel is very well maintained, that is, you can't feel that this is a hotel in Tibet (refer to St. Regis, no comparison, no harm) 5 stars

Landscape:
Shangri-La Libu Palace Recently, I stayed in the landscape king bed and landscape executive. The window is the Bu Palace. The feeling of sitting by the window and reading a book is not too happy 5 stars +

Most of the rooms and suites of St. Regis have no view. I originally booked the executive room, and I felt that the room had no view (street) and it was more gloomy when I entered. I wanted to pay more to change to a suite, but the staff persuaded me that the suite was darker, and there was no view unless it was a top suite. 3 stars

Songtsan View Suite can see the Potala Palace but it is far away and blocked 4 stars +

Food:
If there is any aspect of Shangri-La that can be better, it should be the food!

I stayed for 7 days this time, and the breakfast did not change. The products were so-so, and the fried dough sticks and fried cakes were dry and hard, and they did not feel very fresh. Of course, I can understand that there are fewer tourists in the off-season recently, but it was not very good when I came during the peak season last year. Hahaha

The Chinese restaurant is average

4 stars

Songtsan’s breakfast is the most impressive. There are not many varieties, but they change every day, and the products are very good. The restaurant service is very good and warm

The ******* restaurant has nothing to say about the products. Lunch and dinner are basically solved here.

5 stars

I stayed at the St. Regis in August last year. The breakfast is better than Shangri-La, and I don’t have a special impression

5 stars

It is located very close to Norbulingka. It can be regarded as a quiet place in the midst of chaos. I like the staff here very much, especially Uncle Suolang, Miss Dazhen and a boy at the front desk (forgot his name). Since it was the off-season, we upgraded the room type. The room was very spacious and beautiful for taking pictures. The view outside the window was the garden, which made it feel very peaceful. Shang Palace's restaurant is also delicious. The only drawback is that the breakfast buffet needs to be improved. It's really not that delicious.

Located in the center of Lhasa, the building is very majestic and full of ******* characteristics. Walking into the lobby, you will see a spacious and bright space and unique ******* decoration. The hotel facilities are very complete, the most important ones are a medical room and an oxygen bar.
The surrounding attractions are very rich. The Potala Palace, Barkhor Street and Jokhang Temple are all nearby. You can easily visit these famous attractions, and it is very convenient to take a taxi and walk.
hotel room:
I stayed in an oxygen supply room. The room was spacious and bright, and I could enjoy the beautiful view of the Bu Palace in the morning and evening. Someone cleans the room every day and provides drinks and fruits. The bedding in the bedroom is comfortable and soft; the bathroom is spacious, bright, clean and tidy, and there is a small pool in the shower room. There is also oxygen supply equipment, which provides sufficient oxygen so that you can sleep comfortably even in plateau areas.
hotel service:
I am very grateful to Nan Nan, the hotel's guest relations manager, for her help and service, which made my daughter and I feel at home. Before traveling, Nannan called me to inquire about my needs and offered to upgrade the room so that we could see the beautiful view of Bu Palace. Even though it was very late on the night of arrival, there was still fruit and full room service. I felt unwell in the middle of the night, so they sent us a second oxygen machine and provided us with oxygen bottles we need every day when we go out. Thank you very much! ! ! Before leaving, I gave them exquisite gifts and hada. I will choose Shangri-La next time.

The hotel is very close to Norbulingka and the museum, but a little far from the Potala Palace. After checking in, the front desk service was enthusiastic and the welcome gift was rich. I personally think that the room decoration is more distinctive than St. Regis and InterContinental. I had a buffet in the hotel, and the quality was not bad for Lhasa. There was a problem with the room line before going to bed, and the lights could not be turned off. The repairs took a long time to fix it. Although the duty manager quickly changed the suite opposite, it also affected my rest. In short, it is still a recommended Lhasa hotel.

msg:As a brand with a long history and unique culture, Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts takes its name from a mysterious and desirable place described in James Hilton's novel "Far Far Away". In this place, people live in harmony and peace, pursuing spiritual satisfaction and transcending material pursuits. Staying at Shangri-La Hotel, I seemed to have integrated into this paradise and felt the unique culture of Shangri-La Hotel.
During this trip, I deeply felt that Shangri-La is actively committed to providing guests with distinctive services and exceeding customer expectations. This cultural concept runs through every aspect of the entire hotel. The hotel has been open for a long time, and both the decoration and maintenance of the hotel and the service of the staff have shown attentiveness and professionalism.
During my family's travels, Shangri-La Hotel touched us time and time again with their unique services. Whether at mealtime or at the reception, every employee demonstrates a passion for their work and genuine care for their guests. They made us feel at home with their cordial greetings, attentive service and patient answers. Special mention goes to the staff member named Baima, who not only provided us with first-class service, but also shared her love and understanding of Lhasa culture with us. Through communication with her, I gained a deeper understanding of ******* folk customs and beliefs, which gave me a deeper understanding of Shangri-La's culture.
Staying at Shangri-La Hotel is a very pleasant and rewarding experience. Their warm, friendly and professional service left a very deep impression on our Spring Festival trip to Lhasa, and we look forward to continuing to spend quality time with Shangri-La on our next trip.

On the morning of New Year's Eve, the lobby manager also recommended a Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, which needed to be booked in advance. Both sons wanted to have a buffet, so they Decided to have a buffet for the party’s New Year’s Eve dinner. In the evening, I went to the buffet restaurant, which had a rich menu. I reported my room number and was told that the complimentary dinner was at Shambhala. I needed a group purchase at **, 368 per person. I went to the Shambhala Hall and saw that it was all delivered by the buffet restaurant. There were no more than 8 stir-fried rice dishes in total. After refilling several times, there was still not enough to eat. It was too late to change the Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner to a Chinese restaurant, so the family just had some New Year’s Eve dinner for New Year’s Eve! Shangri-La Hotel leaders, just want to say, if you don’t sincerely give it or can’t afford it, don’t give it away. Who doesn’t want to have a decent New Year’s Eve dinner on New Year’s Eve when staying in a suite costing 1,900 a night? Look at the dinner promised in the picture. Does it have these contents? What was originally a sumptuous and lively New Year’s Eve dinner was deceived by your so-called “gift”!

The room has an oxygen concentrator from Yuyue. The machine is a bit noisy when running, but it is recommended that people going from the mainland keep it on. The hotel provides enough mineral water.

msg:It can be said to be the most disappointing Shangri-La, bar none.
The facilities are old and the windows cannot be opened in the room, so it is very dry. There is no pre-installed oxygen machine, only an oxygen concentrator is provided. The sound is like an airplane engine at night. Friends who have trouble sleeping must not book it, especially since it is difficult to fall asleep on the plateau. . The basin faucets in my friend's room and mine need to be turned on for a few minutes before hot water comes out. The breakfast seems rich, but tastes very average.
As for the service, it's not like a five-star hotel at all, let alone Shangri-La's usual standards. The front desk said that I booked it through Ctrip and wouldn't let me get membership points. Shouldn't membership points be determined based on the stay? I checked my luggage in the morning and there was no one at the concierge. What should I do if I asked the front desk? The front desk asked me to put it anywhere in the lobby, which was really speechless.
There was no one to guide me in the breakfast room, and no one answered me when I asked. The waiter cleaning the table next door would put the kitchen garbage box on the table where I was eating. When I was getting the yogurt, someone suddenly reached out from behind and snatched my straw. When I turned around, I saw that it was the waiter. .
Shangri-La Hotel is my first choice when traveling around the world and on business trips. This is my second time staying at Shangri-La Lhasa. This time is definitely the worst experience of all Shangri-La stays. There are more and more good hotels in Lhasa, but it doesn’t matter if Shangri-La doesn’t improve it. Even the service is getting worse and worse. It’s really puzzling.

I booked a Bu Palace view room in Jiaxuan Pavilion. It was a little far from the elevator (actually the furthest room) but I could see the Bu Palace and it was very quiet.
The housekeeper's quality was unstable. One day, the floor towels were taken away and no one was laid, so I was asked to take a shower and water was all over the floor. Other services were really considerate.
Originally, when I went to Lhasa, I only chose to stay in Songtsan, but now I have another option.

The service is slightly inferior to other Shangri-Las. The welcome fruit for Ctrip orders was not delivered, and the staff did not take the initiative to say hello when encountering them (the staff of Shangri-La in Shanghai/Hangzhou/Guilin who stayed before would greet guests politely).
However, it is worth mentioning that the altitude of Lhasa is 3650 meters, and the hotel has set up a special alms room. If I had a splitting headache in the middle of the night, the hotel also arranged for a doctor to come to the room. It was worth it!

When we first arrived in Lhasa, we felt uncomfortable and would feel better if we slept. The hotel is equipped with a medical room and an oxygen bar. If we felt uncomfortable, we could find a doctor to reassure us. Originally, there was a moon-viewing activity in the hotel bar that day, but it was a pity that we arrived at the same time. It was too late to catch up, but the next night we went to Shambhala Bar to order by ourselves. The bartender, Dolma Quzhen, was very nice, and we could see the Potala Palace from the outdoor seats~ Finally we left On that day, we left our tablet and some items in the room, and Miss Ram at the front desk service center found them for us and mailed them~ In addition to these staff members, every staff member at the Shangri-La Hotel They were all very enthusiastic, including the guys who helped unload the luggage from the car and deliver it to the room and the front desk.

msg:Room facilities, views, breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner, front desk introduction, room cleaning, concierge and meal delivery are all very satisfactory. It is worthy of the Shangri-La brand and there is nothing to fault. Bringing children to the plateau with good quality accommodation can effectively alleviate the symptoms of high altitude sickness and improve the impression of Lhasa.
Diagonally opposite the hotel is the Tibet Museum, and Norbulingka is also within walking distance. The former is definitely worth a visit, and the latter opens at 8:30. The homepage says it only opens at 9:30, so go there at 9:30, and the scenic tour guide They have all been taken away by tourists who went there at 8:30. If there is a tour guide to introduce it, Norbulingka is definitely worth a visit.

Oxygen supply machine, humidifier, welcome fruit, free mini bar in the room, more experience will not be repeated here.

msg:This time I came to Lhasa to visit Shangri-La Hotel 🏨, I stayed in the hotel for a total of 7 days, and I really felt like home😊From the check-in at the front desk, Yu Jianhai and Wu Han who received us were very warm, and Mr. Yu also helped us upgrade I spent one night in a suite, and basically arranged a cloth palace view room throughout the whole process. The room view is very good, and you can see the cloth palace properly. At night, the cloth palace is lit up and the scenery is even more beautiful. All, and also send 2 cans of oxygen tanks to carry with you, which is convenient to carry when you go out and play.
Horizon Club breakfast and happy hour are quite good, very quiet and good service. The breakfast at Cloud Cafe is also very rich.
The most comfortable place is the oxygen bar on the first floor of the hotel, it’s really comfortable to lie down there😌
The hotel swimming pool is also very big, unfortunately because of the high anti-reverse, I dare not go into the water, what a pity😎
The Shang Palace restaurant in the hotel is also very good. I tasted ******* hot pot🍲
The location of the hotel is superior, opposite the Tibet Museum, and there is Norbulingka nearby.
It is a wise choice to book Shangri-La in Lhasa this time. Thanks for the warm service of the hotel🤝

We drove by ourselves, and the waiter gave us warm service after seeing us. The room is also very comfortable, and the whole house provides oxygen and moisture. Let us adapt to the plateau when we first arrived. Even though it was only a short stay, we can feel the service and quality of the brand hotel. We will definitely recommend friends to cook Shangri-La once.

It’s within walking distance. You can see the Potala Palace from the window of the hotel. The waiters are very friendly. Very enthusiastic, especially thanks to Ms. Wang Xiaoning, the child happened to be celebrating his birthday, so I called to ask if I could order a cake. As a result, I not only gave the child a beautiful cake, but also decorated the room and gave gifts. The child had a very happy time Birthday, thanks to the hotel's hard work. Every waiter I met during the stay gave people a simple and warm feeling. Even the ******* waiter in the room saw that I had misused the oxygen supply machine, and immediately taught me in unproficient Chinese. I am very happy to choose Shangri-La as our hotel for our first trip to Tibet

The hotel maintains consistent quality, is clean and tidy, and has a profound cultural background. I like it very much.
The little brother at the front desk was enthusiastic and made us feel at home after a tiring day. Because we took the children to play Tibet together, and a family of three stayed here, we were upgraded to an executive room for free, which was very comfortable and warm.
The breakfast in the hotel is very rich, so Chinese food is also eaten in the hotel. It feels very good, and I will choose here next time.
I like Shangri-La's high-end service quality and distinctive regional ******* style, and feel different cultures.
The hotel is very close to the Tibet Museum, Barkhor Street, Jokhang Temple, and Potala Palace, so it is convenient to travel. I played comfortably and rested very well. It was a very good stay and travel experience.

24-hour oxygen generator high-quality oxygen supply service: his family uses an oxygen generator to supply oxygen directly at the head of the bed, and his family is a desktop Daikin oxygen machine that is genuine 👍, which can diffuse oxygen supply and nasal suction, so you can sleep with peace of mind . woz compares with another oxygen supply that has been tripping. My sleep quality is very poor due to lack of oxygen in the middle of the night, which has a great impact on the quality of travel.
It is commendable that my power bank was left in the hotel room. Ram from the service center contacted me immediately and ordered a courier to deliver it to my home. Thank you very much! I don’t know if it’s good or bad without comparison. Oxygen supply is the key to me. My blood oxygen level was always around 80 in Lhasa, and it was 94 after taking oxygen. After I checked in, I took oxygen immediately, and it returned to 99 within ten minutes. I feel much more comfortable. The Shangri-La Hotel gives me a sense of security. I will stay at your place next time.

msg:I planned an unforgettable trip to Tibet. Before I came, I read a lot of hotels on the Internet, compared the reviews of each hotel, and finally chose Shangri-La. In fact, I was still quite entangled. I was afraid that the high-level reaction would be serious, and I was afraid that the hotel would not be clean and many other problems. , but we were very satisfied when we actually arrived at the hotel, even a special surprise. When we were at the airport, Ann, the little girl at the front desk, called to ask us when we would arrive, and did you have any requirements for the room. She helped us arrange it in advance and we arrived. The hotel also gave us Hada. I heard that it means blessing, and sent us to the room, turned on the oxygen generator and humidifier, and a ******* guy who helped us carry the luggage was also very enthusiastic. He helped us take the luggage to the room, which is great. No, let's leave the shopkeeper and live in a hotel.
This time staying in the hotel is really special thanks to Ann, she pays attention to us at any time, cares about our high-resistance situation, and helps us get breakfast to the room the next day, after all, it is still uncomfortable on the plateau, she is very patient to help us coordinate everything The kinds of things we encountered made us live with peace of mind.
I also like the style of the hotel room very much. It is not very bright and has a quiet feeling. The style of the entire hotel is similar, very quiet, and there are almost no noisy sounds. The rooms are equipped with humidifiers and oxygen generators, and free fruit is also provided. Every waiter is very enthusiastic and will say hello when they see each other. There is a place in the hotel that I like very much. You can see the Potala Palace for free. It is on the front desk floor. There is a bar next to it. The viewing platform is still very good. You can take pictures of the Potala Palace during the day and night without consuming alcohol. You can go there, it's still very good, I recommend everyone to go, it's worth it.

The most important thing is that the service here is very good, very warm, thoughtful and professional, because I usually I don’t write reviews when I stay in the hotel because something happened here that touched me. A staff member of the hotel, Wu Qina, gave me a khata when I came to the hotel, wishing me to come to Tibet, and welcome me. When we arrived at Shangri-La, we were given hot tea and small gifts. When I was staying, I was very uncomfortable because of the high anti-aircraft reaction. I couldn’t sleep at night. I told Nana the next day, and she brought me two bottles of oxygen cylinders directly. He told me to go to the hospital if I felt unwell, and helped me to take a taxi to the Potala Palace. The room also delivered a lot of water and fruit. When I returned to the hotel, they took me to the oxygen bar and called the doctor to measure my blood oxygen. Thoughtful, resting in the oxygen bar will be much better, this is great, thanks to the help of these staff.

It is also adjacent to the Summer Palace Attractions such as Norbulingka and Tibet Museum, the location is super good and the transportation is convenient.

When I helped clean up the next day, I saw more water and fruits. I asked Nana and found out that I helped arrange more. That’s great. I just mentioned that I just arrived in Lhasa I felt very dry, and Nana remembered it. It was really too warm. I felt it from my heart. Shangri-La is great, and Nana's service is even better. Living here is like home, comfortable and enjoyable. I am very satisfied with my trip to Tibet , If you have a chance, come and check in again!

I think I am absolutely qualified to write this review. I still don’t believe the reviews. This time, I really experienced that there are no bad reviews for no reason. When I arrived at the front desk at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, there was a waitress who was slow to serve the whole process. I don't know why there is only one service person checking in. Can't you see so many people queuing up? Where is the service? If I gave a bad review just because of this, then I would be cautious. It is far more than that. The hotel room walked around and left and dragged luggage for 10 minutes. The elevator close to the room was not open. What's the matter? I finally got into the room. My deluxe double room is so small. If I hadn’t booked the room myself, I really wonder if this is Shangri-La? The Shangri-La I used to live in was not like this... Slippers were so hard to wear that they collapsed, even if the toes were exposed, I couldn’t tell the left and right feet. The room was small, and the curtains were opened, and there was a big crane outside. I don’t know what to do. The scenery is amazing... The splints I brought to the bathroom can't be used to clip my hair. The power is insufficient. I really can't complain about the same price. It's better to live in a certain place. At least you think it's worth the money. Who really lives in this Shangri-La? Who regrets it (of course, if you live for the first time and haven’t compared other hotels, I didn’t say it...) If I can see someone say this to me when I live, I really can’t come to live. I don’t feel the service at all. Summary: I think Shangri-La in Lhasa is completely sorry, the second ranking at this price is not worthy of it at all

msg:I am very happy to visit Shangri-La Hotel Lhasa again after a year.
Everything about the hotel reminded me of a wonderful week I spent here last April, made me feel so homely and at home. This trip, I stayed with my wife. Before check-in, Lynn, a colleague at the front desk, knew that we were about to return to Lhasa, and carefully arranged for me to upgrade a room with a beautiful view and prepared intimate welcome fruits, and gave us a sincere welcome greeting and a considerate check-in experience at the front desk. Lynn expressed the joy of meeting again after a year, and welcomed me again, which gave me the joy of reuniting with old friends.
To my surprise, another colleague, Nano, learned of our arrival, and he and his colleagues greeted us in front of the door with khata, and prepared a welcome dessert in the room with our names written on it, which gave me the feeling to go home a feeling of.
During the two days in the hotel, we also experienced the Shambhala bar that we did not experience last year. This bar experience made us linger and forget to return. The new bartender Alvin specially made me a cocktail with the theme of Lhasa Sunshine City, named "Light of Lhasa", which made my trip to Lhasa complete. full stop.
Next time I come to Lhasa, I will definitely choose Lhasa Shangri-Li again without hesitation.

msg:Shangri-La Hotel, Lhasa, must be recommended. The service is better than that of Shangri-La in other cities. Many staff members are *******s. **Dunzhu helped me with my luggage and called me sister in ******* Mandarin. I like it so much. The young man Jiacuo was very enthusiastic to show us the way. It made me feel the enthusiasm of ******* compatriots when I first arrived in Lhasa. Nannan, the front desk, was also very good and polite. There was also a front desk lady whose name I forgot, who also made me feel warm when I first arrived in Lhasa. The warmth and enthusiasm of the hotel seemed to offset the altitude sickness, and I had almost no reaction. There was an oxygen concentrator in the room, and the humidifier was great. The hot water in the shower was also very comfortable. I took a shower on the first day, and there was no legendary altitude sickness. The only thing was that the TV signal was a little bit bad, but now I almost don’t watch TV, and I use my mobile phone to check travel guides. Also, the breakfast was very good, with both Chinese and ******* styles. I like butter tea. When I left, I wanted to take two breads because I was going to drive myself. The waiter enthusiastically gave me a takeaway box. If it was in other hotels, I guess they would not let me take it out. The hotel also has information on car rentals and group tours, which can be booked at the hotel if needed. In short, you must stay at Shangri-La when you come to Lhasa.

msg:After two nights at St. Regis moved to Shangri-La to continue the experience. The location of the hotel is good, one step away from Norbulingka, and it is also very close to the Bu Palace. When I checked in, there was a team in front of me. After waiting for a few minutes, the front desk realized that I was an individual visitor waiting there. Auntie sent a lot of water and fruit, and the service attitude is still very good. Although the room facilities are good, it is very, very stuffy, and the windows cannot be opened casually, which makes people feel very uncomfortable. My peers have high complaints. I can only give a bad review of the oxygen generator in the room. I have never seen a situation where the oxygen saturation becomes lower and lower. I have turned down the flow rate to ensure sufficient oxygen concentration. But it didn't work, because it was too late, and I didn't want to bother the hotel to change the oxygen generator. In the end, I spent 280 to inhale oxygen for a night, which was much worse than St. Regis. I hope that the housekeeping or engineering depar**ent can check the oxygen generator to ensure the normal operation of the equipment. The hotel bar can see the left side of the cloth palace, and the terrace lights are adjusted to be dark, so the scenery effect is very good. Western-style breakfast is also OK, but I hope to put salt and pepper on the table, otherwise I have to ask the chef to get it, which is a bit inconvenient. Overall
The lack of hardware is completely made up for by the service. In Tibet, you can still give high marks.

msg:I have been to Tibet so many times, and this is the worst hotel experience in Lhasa. To be honest, it is not as good as some B&Bs.
First, we went to the front desk to check in, and they asked us to upgrade our room. It cost more than 400 for a room. They said they would have free afternoon tea and coffee, but they didn’t make it clear that it was only for the coffee on the second floor. As a result, there was an additional charge for going to the third floor, which was very frustrating. caused misunderstanding. Very poor experience. The cakes on the second floor are all half-finished products that are inedible.
The fruits delivered to the room were apples and pears, and the apples were still bad after one bite.
Two rooms were upgraded at the same cost, one with a bathtub and one without. In one room, there were no fruits, not even pears, but only apples.
The roaring sound of the oxygen concentrator and the humidifier also greatly affect sleep.
I was hungry on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival and really didn't want to eat anything from the hotel, so I ordered a takeaway. The front desk staff seemed to have difficulty communicating, and they refused when asked to help deliver it. Impersonal.
Next time I go to Lhasa, I will only stay at St. Regis Songtsan or a B&B.
Bad review! !

I hoped to provide two oxygen tanks, but was rejected and asked to pay for them. After staying for two nights, a normal hotel will provide two oxygen tanks a day. As a five-star hotel, this is the first time I have encountered such a stingy and unstructured hotel. It does not deserve five stars! Do you understand the service? The reason why oxygen tanks are needed is not because of lack of oxygen! Does it mean that if you check out in the morning, you are no longer a hotel guest? No humanistic care at all!

msg:I always think that the design of Lila is my favorite. Compared with the cold hotel feeling, it will feel more like home. Here are two things worth mentioning: 15th extended stay request to change from twin bed to queen bed room near the elevator. Lila not only didn't need me to carry my luggage, but also helped to upgrade the room type. In addition, when I checked in on the 14th, the little brother at the front desk personally helped put the luggage in the room. Another thing, I can't help but admire the speed and ability of the manager on duty to solve problems, and also have a deeper trust in the Lila brand. What happened was as follows: On the night of the 14th, I went to the Lila infirmary to check for coughing, and found that they were not actually the Lila brand, but outsourced services, which were different from hospitals that could solve illnesses. The infirmary has the problem of induced consumption of oxygen and does not solve any symptoms (there is an oxygen generator in the room, and there is also a free oxygen bar on the first floor). Fever 😂 There is also a problem of poor attitude towards other guests. Because I felt that the infirmary was cheating, I called the service center to give advice when I returned to the room. Unexpectedly, the manager on duty not only took the initiative to call back to propose a solution, but also gave me breakfast at the hotel as a gift. This kind of professional problem solving makes people really comfortable. I hope you can maintain such a high level of professional service during the peak season, come on.

msg:After spending a week in Nyingchi, we came to Lhasa by car for eight hours and chose to stay at Lhasa Shangri-La. We didn’t have high expectations for this Shangri-La, because considering 1. It’s in a ******* area, 2. The price of staying here is pretty good. , 3. I'm picky like the princess and the pea. As a result, the check-in experience exceeded my expectations and I was very satisfied.

First of all, I would like to thank the staff of Shangri-La Hotel, Nan Nan and Xiao Ning
careful arrangement. A few days before the check-in, I contacted them by phone and communicated the details of the check-in. They had already prepared the details of the room layout for us in advance. I've been asked about my preferences all the time.

Because we knew the time of our arrival, the room had already been turned on for heating and moisturizing. Once we entered the room, it was very comfortable, and there were oxygen supply equipment and fruit drinks ready. super satisfied. Staying for one night washes away the fatigue of driving for a day.

The breakfast buffet was an eye-opener for me, because for so many days in Nyingchi, supplies have been in short supply. Although staying in a hotel in the Song* series is great, I have never seen a buffet breakfast like Shangri-La, with so much food. There are even hot and sour noodles, sausage buns, meat floss buns, and salted egg yolks that are popular in the mainland.

When booking a room, I actually considered whether to go out to eat an authentic ******* breakfast, but in the end, I was lazy and chose to eat the buffet at the hotel. I would say that this decision is very wise.

The temperature of the hotel is very comfortable, the oxygen supply and heating are well done, there are many kinds of food choices, and it is clean and hygienic.

Overall satisfied, especially thanks to Nan Nan and Xiao Ning for their arrangements.

msg:Just checked out to give a fresh review
I came to Tibet for 5-6 days and stayed in 2 top hotels in Lhasa, St. Regis and Shangri-La. To be honest, the off-season hotels are made like this, and they are persuaded to leave.
First of all, I booked a super deluxe double bed room. As the name suggests, it is better than a deluxe double bed room. Of course, the price is different. At the beginning, the front desk said that we were very tired, so they gave room 347 on the same floor as the lobby. The room was quite big, with a view of the residential area, the kind next to the Ming Residence. The heating in the room is not hot for 1-2 hours, and the more you sleep, the colder it becomes. This place is most afraid of catching cold. The hot water in the bathroom will be hot for at least 5 minutes. How dare you take a shower at night? After reporting to the front desk, I was changed to room 605. This room is super mini, sure it is warmer, but the hot water in the bathroom still takes about 1 minute to heat up, and the hair dryer is cold. Ctrip sent fruit in the room, free late check-out, and the hotel sent two apples and two oranges. If the plate is not given, you can take it by hand. If I change the room, I will give you a few fruits if you leave them in the original room.
Breakfast: Actually, I don’t know how other people are here. Anyway, I have a serious high reaction, and I can’t eat anything every day. Every morning, I’m done with a cup of sweet tea and a bowl of porridge. When entering the restaurant, the service staff will check the room number, check it and let you in. I had breakfast this morning, but a waitress insisted on staring at me and asked me if I should pay in cash or pay the bill, and said that my room does not include breakfast . Really oolong.
Leaving and checking out today, the key point is that it is the off-season now, so the hotel delayed until 2 pm, and I reluctantly asked me to leave before 2 pm. After going out for a stroll and coming back to pack in a hurry, I got serious reactions. At the most oolong time, the hotel called me after 12 o'clock to ask me whether to check out or continue my stay. Then why did I call in advance, the hotel front desk did not make a note to communicate?
To be honest, I came here to choose this kind of five-star hotel to prevent high-level rebellion, so that I can rely on trust when I have sudden physical discomfort.
May I ask how you have the nerve to charge such a small room fee for such a service in Lhasa Shangri-La!

I had breakfast in the restaurant in the morning (complimentary breakfast), and the manager of the restaurant came here and asked me sincerely, do you have any comments or suggestions for the hotel? It gives me the feeling that I care about the feelings of the guests.
Because the air in Lhasa is dry, four fruits (two oranges and two apples) and four bottles of water were delivered on the first day; the eldest sister who cleaned the house on the second day found that I had finished eating and drinking all the fruits and water, and gave me 6 Fruits, 6 bottles of water; on the third day, I found that I had finished eating and drinking, so I added 8 fruits and 8 bottles of water. This time I couldn't finish eating and drinking. Full of sincerity and love, very touching!
There is an oxygen generator and humidifier in the room, which alleviates the discomfort of arriving in the plateau to a certain extent.
The location is good, very close to the Potala Palace, Norbulingka, Barkhor Street, Jokhang Temple, Tibet Museum, and Tibet Library. It is convenient to travel.
I like it very much and highly recommend it. I wish the hotel better and better.

🌸 Take a look at the place where you have to pay for your breath. How long has Tibet been a poem and a distant place that you have collected?
🌸I heard that people will come to Lhasa twice in their lifetime, once they lose their hearts here, and once they find them back.
🌸Advantages: The viewing room (including the meals of the Horizon Club on the 2nd floor and the afternoon tea buffet, the two young ladies here have a very good service attitude and sweet smiles) The windows are clean and you can see the most beautiful cloth palace; welcome fruits are very good Sweet; the little brothers and sisters at the front desk are warm and thoughtful, and offered to help me calculate how to pay for the room more cost-effectively; the staff of the breakfast cafeteria took the initiative to inform the hotel and Lhasa where the photos are good; the buffet breakfast ends at 10:30 and is rich; the parking lot is working Staff assists in parking🅿️; Concierge takes the initiative to help with parking and carrying large luggage; 4 bottles of mineral water, free use of minibar on the first night; toiletries "L'Occitane"; hot water within 5 seconds;
🍄 Disadvantages: The scale is too old and has not returned to 0; the bedside socket is a little far away, and there is no socket to use on the side of the humidifier and the oxygen generator? Only one side of the bedside master switch is inconvenient; there is no Type-c charging port on the wall; the hair dryer is Panasonic but old;
💕I like a place not because it has no shortcomings, but because it can accommodate the shortcomings. If the advantages are what you like, you can start decisively. Tonight is the viewing room, the eyes are in heaven, and the body is lying flat✌️Shuangwaiwai.

msg:This time I went to Lhasa and chose Shangri-La Hotel to stay for 3 nights. As a large group chain, Shangri-La at home and abroad has always been considered and selected, but this stay experience was less than expected. Evaluate its pros and cons objectively. Let’s talk about the advantages first: 1. The breakfast is rich in variety, the restaurant is large, and there is no need to wait for meals. But the taste is average, and the breakfast is not well done, especially the stalls where noodles and rice noodles are cooked. 2. The dishes in the Chinese restaurant (Chuanxiang Garden) are more authentic. 3. The service attitude is good. I originally wanted to change the hotel. A front desk manager had a very good attitude. After communication, he insisted on staying for 3 nights. 4. The hotel is fully equipped, with a medical room and an oxygen bar (although we do not have a high reaction), there are still many guests who have encountered high reaction problems, which can be relieved in the hotel accordingly. 5. Toiletries smell very good, and always maintain the characteristics of Shangri-La. Let's talk about the disadvantages: 1. The room is too small, we need an extra bed (the front desk said that the largest room has been given) 2. The room equipment is relatively old (maybe the occupancy rate is high and the loss is large), the slippers are too thin, and the towels are too Thin, only the hotel level. The bedding is not very comfortable, the sofa is too hard, and there are no pillows. They say that they are not suitable for pillows, but after the proposal, the customer service staff still brought 3 of them for us. 3. The surrounding environment of the hotel is not good. The curtains are opened in the neighborhood next door. It is also difficult to park in and out. The hotel is surrounded by a car city. The only bit of geographical advantage is that the museum and Norbulingka are just across the road (we love going to the museum). Although some of them are flaws, such as site selection, they cannot be changed. But some small details can still be improved at a relatively low cost. For example, disposable slippers and bath towels can be purchased with better quality. The sofa can be equipped with two pillows.

The eldest sister of their hotel room said that because of environmental protection issues, the trash cans are not allowed to be covered with garbage bags. I am a little surprised. , We are a little bit uncomfortable when we come to travel, and we will definitely order takeaways. Where do we put the garbage? As for eco-friendly claims you have other options. The second is that there is no paper towels in the room except the toilet. Secondly, I checked in at the front desk at about 14:00 in the afternoon, and I made a request to change to a double room, but the front desk told me that there are only two beds, a luxury hotel with nearly 300 rooms. , you told me that there is currently no big bed that can be replaced, so why can I book it online and not change the room for me? I can't change the room type without a big bed, so can I change it the next day? Our couple stayed in Lhasa for a few days in a twin room, which is not what a luxury hotel should do! During the peak period of breakfast, we rely on rushing. At 8:30, there is no tsampa for breakfast, and no one will deal with it.

Oxygen generators are provided free of charge, heating, air-conditioning and humidifiers are all equipped. It is a hotel with the best accommodation environment in Lhasa.

parking:
Maybe it was because of the hotel's meeting in the past two days, which led to the scarcity of parking spaces, it was super hard to find, and the experience was reduced!

Room View:
Originally, when I looked at the photos, I thought that I would open the curtains to see the Potala Palace, but the reality was a thousand miles away, but at any rate, my vision was not limited, I was barely able to, but I was somewhat disappointed.

Serve:
Maybe it's because of the high occupancy rate of the meeting, which led to the poor attitude of the guy at the front desk? Or is it because I booked on Ctrip, and the price is 100+ cheaper than the direct encounter at the hotel, so I was neglected? After placing the order, Ctrip said that I would be reminded to check in after about 10 minutes, but I sat in the lobby for more than half an hour and did not come to call me. As a result, I could check in a long time ago. I was in a hurry to rest. Waiting for so long in the lobby with luggage in vain! And my welcome fruit was delivered only after I took the initiative to remind the housekeeping depar**ent. The service is really average! The housekeeping phone was called three times and no one answered! There is no way to earn points when booking on Ctrip, hehehe…

During breakfast, I was choosing a meal, and the staff would come over and whisper to me, beauty, your shoelaces are open~
Because I go out during the day, I will call me in advance to ask for my opinion when I enter the room for cleaning.
When I went back to my room at night and asked to clean my house, a little ******* girl named Deji came to help me clean up my room. Seeing that I was eating takeout, he took the initiative to send me some paper. Seeing that the humidifier and oxygen generator in my room are out of water, quickly help me add water. When asked what else I needed, I told her I needed to drink more water because I was worried about altitude sickness. She moved to mention mineral water, which is super real and cute. In addition, she said that to relieve altitude sickness, you can eat more fruits. I politely responded thank you. After a while, she delivered the fresh fruit plate of the day, and I was very moved.
Looking forward to more people, learn more here. Looking forward to more people who like it here. Looking forward to more people, to pass on the friendship.

He has been helping to keep the luggage until the check-in procedure is completed. It has been an hour during this period, and I am very grateful to him for this. The room is big, ******* style, there are abundant welcome fruits and red wine, which is really good. As a member of Shangri-La Hotel, I also give five-star praise to Shangri-La Hotel in Lhasa. The only flaw is that the room is not ready when checking in. I hope to pay attention to correction.

Shangri-La has maintained the same level of service as always, and every staff member is very polite. The characteristic of the hotel in Lhasa is that it has an oxygen bar. If a friend who has just entered Tibet is very suitable for staying here.

The hotel room can directly see the Potala Palace, and the bar has an open balcony to view the Potala Palace, which is a unique location. The only two points that need to be improved are: there is a humidifier in the room, which is very good, but unfortunately the management is not good enough. The new guest arrived and did not arrange cleaning. After I found it, I spent half an hour carefully washing it and using it. The food in the hotel buffet is not very fresh, although the variety of food is very rich, it is recommended that the variety can be reduced but it must be fresh. After all, at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters, guests will not have the same expectations for a complete variety of food as they do on the inland plains, but fresh ingredients can definitely maintain the decency of a five-star hotel.

msg:I arrived in Lhasa in the 30th year of the year, and I was tired all the way. I had to toss and do nucleic acid first. It was already past 8 pm when I arrived at the hotel. .
Fortunately, there is no confusion in booking the hotel, and I chose Shangri-La for the first word of mouth on the entire network. Starting from entering the gate of the single-family house, the services of welcome guests, doormen, front desk, restaurant waiters, and room attendants are not only the traditional high standardization of five-star foreign-funded hotels (now many foreign-funded hotels have very good services), but also The unique enthusiasm and human touch of the ******* compatriots make people let go of their exhaustion and the frustration of not being able to eat the New Year's Eve dinner on time. The restaurants outside rarely open and most of them close at 8 o'clock. The restaurant in the hotel still insists on opening very late. The dishes include Cantonese, Sichuan and ******* dishes, which are large and delicious.
The room chose a standard room with an aerator. The room is large and fully furnished. Welcome fruit, New Year gold coins, chocolates and red envelopes. The quality of the product is very stable, and the decoration is very ******* style. I am most satisfied with the service team headed by the duty managers Wang Danyang and Nan Nan. I would like to thank the hotel doctor for the caring on-site treatment (high reaction), and thanks to the room attendant who took the trouble to open the window. Ventilation and sending a lot of water to relieve my high reaction, thank the restaurant waiter for taking care of my family, so that we can watch the fireworks show reserved in Lhasa and the night view of the Potala Palace on the terrace on the fifth floor in the 30th year... I will never forget it, thank you, Zha Sidler!
I am very fortunate to have chosen this Lhasa store through the recommendation of the former director of Shangri-La and friends who often come to Lhasa, which has laid the most reliable and warm foundation for the beautiful snowy travel.

Although I have been playing for several days before going from Nyingchi to Lhasa, there is no high reaction or discomfort, but the front desk is caring, warm, and actively informs many details to make the guests feel very warm! The concierge brother is also responsible and has a good attitude! In the evening, I asked the little brother from the engineering department to open the window, and the speed was also very fast! The next day I set off for ************* at 7:00. When I met the cleaning aunt downstairs, I would take the initiative to say hello!
Although the room is not as big as St. Regis, the facilities and equipment are all good, and the facilities of St. Regis are shabby!
The supplies are from L'Occitane (not Shangri-La's classic green bottle collection)
Disadvantages: After the room temperature is opened for ventilation, the window is closed, and then the air conditioner is adjusted to the lowest level, it is still hot at night! Will wake up hot! Hope the hotel can adjust!

msg:Very satisfied stay! The Shangri-La Hotel in Lhasa has several advantages: 1. The hotel is well located, it is a 10-minute walk from Norbulingka and Tibet Museum to the west. To the east, it is about 30 minutes' walk from the Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, and Barkhor Street. There is also a shared electric car to ride at the entrance of the hotel. It can be said that the scenic spot is very convenient. The Potala Palace can be seen from the hotel. 2. The hotel facilities are good, the temperature in the room is controllable, there is a diving oxygen machine and a small oxygen bottle, and welcome fruits are also delivered. You can see the snow-capped mountains in the distance through the window. There is a constant temperature swimming pool and a warm bath on the first floor. And 24 hours free oxygen room. 3. The attitude of the staff is very good. After check-in, they even called to ask if they were satisfied and if there was anything that needed help. It was really hard. 4. Checking in coincided with Chris**as Eve. The store was filled with a festive a**osphere. There was also a talent show for children in the hotel lobby on that day. We ordered a salad, a cake, and welcome fruits in the room. The ceremony was full. 4. In the end, we are worried that we cannot travel into Tibet due to health, weather, epidemic prevention policies and other reasons. If you book Shangri-La Hotel on Ctrip, you can cancel it on the same day. This is much better than the St. Regis Hotel (non-cancellable)!

msg:1. In October, the lowest temperature in Lhasa was 5 degrees, but the hotel’s air conditioner only provided cold air; the spa room was cold without any heating facilities; the room was cold, after requesting to provide a warm film, telephone complaints, the entire hotel management staff are used to it, nothing I apologize for worrying about the guest’s body; 2. The dishes and durian pastry are inconsistent with the picture. The feedback said that the chef did not change the picture. The key beef soup was hairy. The feedback said that it may be yak hair. The front of the mirror plug is 120 and 230v voltage to wipe the head, but provides 220v hair dryer, you need to go to a cold room with no cold wind and look for a 220v plug to blow your hair with your wet hair. 4. The ******* waiters here are sincere and have a good heart. Seeing that we were unhappy, they gave us water to comfort us. Unfortunately, the manager did not have a sense of service and was already dying. In this icy hotel, in addition to the high reaction, the manager’s feelings are weak. Everyone stays when choosing. We also live in other boutique hotels in Lhasa. Although the price is several hundred, at least the rooms have warm air. The operators value customers.
Sincere evaluation, this Shangri-La hotel in Lhasa is not worth staying.

msg:The sanitation of the guest rooms is very clean and thoughtful. The hardware of the room is good, and the humidifiers of oxygen inhalation machine are good enough.

The taste of the Chinese restaurant is quite ordinary. I really don't understand why the five-star hotel in Lhasa is served with Sichuan and Hunan cuisine. I also ask the senior management of the hotel to think about this. Moreover, the taste and service are quite poor. As a result, we stayed for four nights and five days before and after the hotel. Our family felt very distressed about where to eat for dinner. Later, we went to the Little Sheep on the street and the Chinese restaurant in Songtsam Linka Hotel before we barely found the feeling of looking for food on holiday. (It is recommended that hotel management staff collectively go to Songzan Hotel to have a meal and write their impressions)

The worst thing is parking. I found this big problem in the evaluation of Ctrip. I thought that there were fewer tourists and fewer vehicles during the epidemic. I also thought that the Shangri-La brand would definitely find a way to improve during the Golden Week. As a result, the parking problem really didn’t let me. Disappoin**ent is a disaster. After watching Princess Wencheng in the middle of the night, it was about 11 o'clock when she came back. It took 40 minutes to find a parking space and finally stopped a long way, and walked back with the children. The security guard on duty late at night was not helpful except for driving us away from the position where he thought he could not stop with a gentle expression. I really can't imagine how painful they would be if they were changed to a family with a baby, or if guests who had more serious high reactions came back at night. I sincerely suggest that the hotel should take due responsibility for this huge hardware shortage and provide services similar to valet parking. Otherwise, most of the self-driving guests will be criticized like me.

We stayed in Shangri-La for two nights, Songzan for two nights, and St. Regis for five nights. These three hotels should be the best in Lhasa. The St. Regis is the most comfortable and the rooms are super big. Songtsam Hotel has the strongest ******* style, but its location is a bit far away from the city. It is suitable for just arriving in Lhasa because the oxygen supply time in the bedroom is very long. Shangri-La is good except for the smaller rooms. It is recommended if the price is lower than the other two.

The room size is quite satisfactory. There is an oxygen generator in the room. It is not a diffuse oxygen supply room. Although we do not have a high reaction and do not need to use it, do these equipment also appear to be outdated in the hotel? The breakfast is still very good, quality and variety are guaranteed!

You can inhale oxygen when needed, but my husband and I have never had any altitude sickness. , The oxygen generator in the room and the two small bottles of oxygen donated are not used. There is an aerobic bar on the other floor. You can lie down and take a rest when you need it. When checking in, the ******* guy Jigme Luozhu was very warm and thoughtful, helping us carry our luggage and introduce the facilities in the room. Because I ordered a Horizon Pavilion, breakfast and dinner can be eaten at the Executive Corridor Restaurant on the 2nd floor. In Lhasa, because the gastrointestinal digestion is not very good on the plateau, I didn’t eat much at noon, and I just wanted to eat something simple at night, so the hotel gave it to the hotel. The evening meal on the 2nd floor is very good. It's just right to have some porridge, some side dishes and fruit. I especially want to praise the bed and pillows in the room. They are moderately soft and hard. After staying for four nights, they basically just stick to the bed, which relieves the fatigue of the journey. It is much more comfortable than the Evergrande Hotel in Linzhi!

msg:Because I decided to come to Lhasa temporarily and the Dragon Boat Festival room was still tight, everyone recommended St. Regis. I originally planned to set one day for the transition from Shangri-La to St. Regis. In fact, I stayed at St. Regis for one day and then returned to Shangri-La, and because Shangri-La gave me The experience was so good. I changed the itinerary and stayed in Lhasa for one day. The two check-in were different guys. I had to give 10,000 likes. The guy at the front desk handed out his ID card as soon as I returned to Shangri-La. Say hey, you stayed in the day before yesterday and gave me the same room as before. Although I don't like to slap, it is the first time I have experienced such a good service in the hotel, and all aspects have made me have a particularly good experience.
Location: There is Norbulingka next to Shangri-La, and it is less than 2km to the cloth palace. The St. Regis walks closer to Barkhor Street and Jokhang Temple. The cloth palace is a little bit round and the location is generally the same.
Landscape: Shangri-La can see the side of the cloth palace. For Regis, it's okay to see the panorama, but the Regis observation deck will remind you of the low consumption after a while.
Service: Shangri-La's victory, smile service throughout, take the initiative to pour tea after check-in, will take the initiative to help pick up luggage, chat, the service staff at the St. Regis door will only stare at you, not even a word of hello.
Facilities: St. Regis’s hardware is very good, the room is large, and there is no oxygen generator in the ordinary room. The Shangri-La room is a bit smaller and has an oxygen generator. In addition, Shangri-La has two bottles of free oxygen, and St. Regis is charged oxygen. But I personally feel that I prefer Shangri-La, because St. Regis’s bed is too soft to sleep well all night.
Breakfast: Shangri-La’s breakfast was eaten at the Horizon Club. There were relatively few people and the service was very good. Had a meal in the lobby once, there were many kinds of Cantonese hot porridge. The St. Regis breakfast has many varieties and styles, but the taste is slightly inferior. I think Shangri-La is too delicious for the noodles and desserts, especially the opera cakes.
Hygiene: On the first night of staying at St. Regis, I still think the two have their own merits, but the next day we met the service staff who cleaned the room. They didn’t even wear uniforms, and they showed me a particularly speechless sanitation incident. I threw my pajamas on the floor and changed to a new room. I saw the dirty bathtub. I thought that the hair on the carpet was stained with my slippers when I checked in on the first day. We were still a little uncomfortable, so I decided to check out and return to Shangri-La. The cleanliness of the room is the first criterion for accommodation, and others are second.
The St. Regis does have a distinctive lobby decoration, but after all, I don’t sleep in the lobby. Shangri-La’s services and facilities have made me feel uncomfortable with the city of Lhasa. I am willing to revise the itinerary and take another day’s rest.

The environment is elegant, and the rooms are integrated with ******* style. The happy hour meal in the evening executive lounge is very surprising. Special thanks to Jennie Zhang, the Director of Guest Relations, for all the help (especially when providing additional oxygen cylinders and oxygen machines for fellow partners). At the same time, I would like to thank the concierge, Solang Tsering, for his meticulous care when he arrived at the store.

The beauties at the front desk were enthusiastic, and the check-in was quick, especially the bellboy guy Baima Duoji was warm and friendly. He helped us carry the luggage, took the initiative to introduce how to use the room equipment, knew that we needed tea, and gave us more drinking water. The same Shangri-La, Lhasa restaurant breakfast, buffet dinner are great!

When we checked in, the handsome guy Nan Nan at the front desk of the hotel gave us a free upgrade to the executive viewing suite for one day. Outside the window is the majestic Potala Palace. After checking in, the handsome southern guy also enthusiastically told us that there is free afternoon tea and snacks on the second floor of the hotel. The other service staff are also very helpful and polite. The hotel’s breakfast is very rich and delicious. Thank you all. With the hard work and enthusiasm of the staff, I will choose Shangri-La Hotel next time!

Talking about the shortcomings, I ordered breakfast and dinner. The restaurant has to check with the front desk for a long, long time... It seems too unprofessional.

I called the staff to adjust the air conditioner for two consecutive nights. I didn't fall asleep all night and drank some water. I just sat until dawn and waited to check out! I haven't adjusted the air conditioner myself, it's all handled by the hotel staff, and it's still very uncomfortable! The sliding door of the toilet also automatically hooked and locked the next morning! The door hooks hanging on the wall were pulled off by myself! ! Due to the accommodation, the follow-up itinerary could not be continued. The first time I came to Lhasa, I stayed for a total of two days! The price of 5600 for two nights did not sleep well for two nights. This room type has been upgraded!

msg:作為攜程近 20 年的酒店控老用户，其實我真的非常懶惰，很少在評論區發表特別多字的酒店住宿評論。但是這次我決定第一次認真發表一篇評論。因為我知道，如果你能刷到這個評論，説明你和曾經的我一樣正在尋找一個在拉薩落腳的舒適、具備一定服務標準、給你帶來安心的酒店。也肯定和曾經的我一樣對比過瑞吉酒店，或者正在遲疑如何選擇。

那麼一定一定這次聽我的，請選擇香格里拉。因為高原旅行，酒店真的還挺重要的，這也是我會絮絮叨叨寫那麼多的原因。。（兩個都住了，偏中立的觀察和評論）

首先，距離路程並不是你在這兩個酒店之間做選擇需要考慮的因素。拉薩不大，打車其實都在 10 到 20 塊左右，即便瑞吉離八廓街更近，但是你在那種強日曬的時候其實大部分時間都是打車，所以，路程距離幾乎不影響。香格里拉周邊也有西藏博物館和羅布林卡，兩邊打車去看文成公主時間距離也差不多。如果真的很愛瑞吉正對布達拉宮的景色（普通房型不可能有） 那麼你完全可以去它六樓的吐蕃吧吃個 298 的下午茶，還挺好吃，陽台位置有三組，提前打電話預訂陽台位置就好。

接下來，衹以我們選擇酒店的上述目的為標準，
我感受到的就是，你能在香格里拉看到一個優秀的團隊管理者帶領的有條不紊，訓練有素、強 sop ，關注細節且目標明確的團隊。而你在瑞吉看到的，就是一個無能管理者帶領的毫無系統章法、支離破碎、搖搖欲墜、各自為戰、苦苦掙扎、無可奈何（也許還有一個令人崩潰的操作系統——不然不明白為啥每個客人 check in 前台都要盯着電腦搗鼓老半天）的一羣人。

説實話，瑞吉的大堂設計是很殊勝的，各種佛教擺件，釋迦牟尼像、壇城唐卡…但是也就僅限於此（功勞給到設計師）。一堆極具風情的裝飾，卻配上特別讓人彆扭的服務團隊，真的感覺瑞吉你是不是拿錯了人家松讚的東西啊？

香格里拉就是一如既往的穩定。開闊大堂配上一些民族元素加上讓人舒心的淺黃色調。禮賓拿行李送至中庭、銜接服務小姐姐接過行李送至前台引導排隊或直接辦理入住，並時刻觀察入住隊伍流量。前台姐姐 1.5倍速高效並且非常標準化的入住辦理話術，其中也包括詢問客人高反情況並給出相應響應。最後給房卡，歡迎入住詞，引導客人自行上樓，並且非常主動的要求客人不要碰行李，由禮賓送達（禮賓在忙，小姐姐告知禮賓正在接待團隊，一會兒送）。完美接待流程。其實客人並不會從這中間獲得啥超越期待的服務，但是穩定確定的標準真的很安心。因為並不是我一個人得到此服務，觀察下來就是一直如此穩定。

如果你去瑞吉，尤其是在旺季的時候，那麼你將獲得由非標團隊給您帶來的個性化隨機盲盒服務。拿我和入住期間的觀察來看，雖然瑞吉配備了幾乎和香格里拉差不多的前廳接待人數（禮賓，管家，前台，實習），但是瑞吉的前廳總是擠滿了沒有被認真規劃和安排的等待辦理入住的客人。

且瑞吉的前台辦理入住的時間非常不穩定，有的甚至長達 25  分鐘，而等待客人就這麼被涼在旁邊自己在幾個前台間遊走尋找下一個可能的辦理點。有個運氣不好的小哥在我們辦理前就開始等待了（我們等了 30 分鐘），我們辦理完後，因為他聽前台話坐的比較遠的沙發休息等待，一直因為自己沒有找準時機，導致我們去入住了，他還在無奈的在三個前臺中間尷尬的站着。瑞吉的禮賓或者管家也是隨機出現，大部分情況下，前台辦理完入住會讓在主樓的客人自己拎着行李穿過長長的走廊（可能你有高反，但是她不在意也不會問）走到房間，或者站起來在前台大喊一聲“誰是他的管家帶一下？！”如果沒人，客人房間又比較遠，就會被前台實習生臨時引導。注意，她是高貴的前台實習生，她做了不該她做的工作，所以別指望她給你拎行李或者可以認真幫你解答關於房間的疑問。她會回答你：我不知道我是前台實習生。或者，給你一個錯誤答案。我們和我觀察到的很多組客人，幾乎都是這個待遇。當我們和其他客人剛下飛機被高反折磨後，又被這個通往客房長長的千米走道震驚，拖着沉重的行李喘着氣説：有點高反，走太遠了，太累了。她衹會頭也不回的在前面對你説一句：那你走慢點。

如果你在瑞吉辦理入住的時候運氣好禮賓在前台可以幫忙拎行李，那麼恭喜你戰勝了 99%的用户了。wod 天，前台衹需要像香格里拉一樣加一個行李 stand by 進房流程不就行了。是她們不知道嗎？我猜不是，大概率這個團隊已經沒辦法做到部門間高效協作了。這該是個多麼無能的管理者。這也就不奇怪我們會在瑞吉房間的洗手枱旁發現死蒼蠅，水龍頭上可怕的大概幾個月沒有清理的大面積表面水垢……恩…確信是一個各自為政的團隊，否則客房部門應該也不會這麼有恃無恐吧——反正我們瑞吉房間主打一個黑黑的風格，擦不擦你也看不出來，昆蟲屍體也會跟櫃子的黑色融為一體。

而香格里拉的客房衞生就是一如既往的標準、穩定、符合預期，客房用品也是一如既往的材質和品牌。哦，對了，説到這裏，這家瑞吉提供的牙刷是那種現在好一點的民宿也不會使用的可以達到鋼針刺牙效果的劣質一次性產品……恩…實在不知道咱是降成本了還是採購管理出問題了啊？

還有各種細節的對比，篇幅有限不説了，但是還是挺明顯能窺斑見豹，一個你見到的所有員工（哪怕是在車道上引導車輛的禮賓）臉上都洋溢着堅定、有序、自信我能 handle 的團隊，和一個前台臉上充滿煩躁，禮賓眼神遊移（會上下看客人或心不在焉或交頭接耳聊天）管家不停在做無用功（例如打電話道歉，賠償，要好評，推薦旅遊項目，非標 1V1 不提高酒店整體用户體驗感的服務），你就知道，這種體驗上的極致對比事件，並不會衹發生在我一個人身上。

拉薩的酒店選擇，由於高反的加持，我相信大部分用户都會跟我一樣，選擇穩定安心符合預期的服務。極具個性化的差評和要來的好評都衹能當做參考，希望我的體驗和觀察會給你的選擇帶來幫助。

另外提醒一下預訂瑞吉基礎普通房型的朋友，你們的房間在 6 號樓（需要禮賓電瓶車送，不過房間是Ok 的）但是前台會謊稱你被升級到主樓了，然後給你一個主樓一樓陰暗無光的房間。你猜為啥？因為前台沒禮賓開電瓶車的時候，這樣你就可以自己拖着行李箱走上 10 分鐘鍛鍊高原心肺了！

希望拉薩香格里拉繼續加油保持（別讓看了我的評論選擇你們的用户覺得我在瞎扯淡）或者更棒（例如咬咬牙批點錢給每個房間加個智能馬桶蓋，智能電視咱可以先不換，但是智能馬桶已經快成酒店預訂搜尋關鍵詞了）

至於某酒店的工作人員，咱實在不行也可以換個酒店幹阿！

另，兩個酒店的客人類型，香格里拉更統一，偏穩重內斂的旅者。瑞吉就更隨機多樣化一些，各式各樣的旅客都挺多（甚至還能在大堂看到穿着裹胸緊身清涼 bling 吊帶裙，長得一模一樣的小姐姐們在宗教掛畫前擺拍，讓我一秒鐘錯覺自己是不是來到了亞龍灣酒店啊…而旁邊就坐着幾位等待辦理入住的僧侶裝扮客人，也是很 mix 很後現代拉）

msg:禮賓部、前台、酒吧、早餐都不錯，符合香家一如既往的品質。
唯一感受十分差的是餐飲部服務經理：李勝方Leo Li。
香宮大廳用午餐時，李經理似乎沒把在場客人當回事，在那邊大聲訓斥一個服務員。言語中盡顯傲慢無禮，個人素質極差。回頭看了一眼眼神示意下，李經理看到我的眼神也沒當回事，繼續那裡罵人。直到我問他：10%的服務費是讓我們來聽你罵人的嗎，經理？

另，李經理業務能力也很差。結賬時竟然連手裡POS機都搞不來，到處去問別的服務員，付款我還要等你在那裡學習如何使用POS機？

香家餐飲設定10%服務費，想必對自己的品質和服務很有信心。但餐飲經理是這樣一位個人素質，業務能力都極差的人，相當拉胯。

建議餐飲總監讓李經理回爐重造，還是説餐廳培訓壓根就沒做好？若明知道該經理不行還要用他，那是不是餐飲部整體都不行？

msg:我在拉薩七天，住了四個酒店，對這個酒店我真的不知道咋評論，我是報着很大的期待的，可能是旺季的原因，他們的給我的感受不是很好，整體感覺就是：他的價格屬於你可以接受範圍的上限，但是其他的所有都屬於你可以接受範圍的下限，好像什麼都有，又都差那麼點意思。

設施：因為我到的晚，走得早，沒有感受太多的配套設施，這三分一分給製氧、一分給衞生間、一分給minibar

衞生：衞生整體還不錯，房間櫃子的角落有灰塵，不過無傷大雅

環境：旁邊是博物館和羅布林卡，還算方便，酒店內標識不是很清楚，我找醫務室找了二十多分鐘，問了好幾個員工才找到

服務：和其他的香記沒法比，比拉薩其他酒店（拉薩飯店、平措康桑等）好一些，但是價格也比人家貴很多，早餐的時候有兩個領導模樣的人轉來轉去好像在指導工作（一男一女），然後飲料台上西瓜汁的出水口被堵住，反應了好幾遍都沒人管，除了幫忙挪車的保安大哥和門僮外（這兩分是加給他們的），所有人員的服務都配不上這個酒店的品牌。

人的期待是會隨着價格的提升而提升的，如果衹是藉著旺季為藉口漲價，但是服務卻沒有提升，這根本不符合一個國際五星酒店該有的格局，總之這次的入住體驗和其他香記一比，我甚至懷疑我住的是個假香記，建議準備入住的筒子，要麼淡季住便宜的，要麼降低你的期待，否則你會有很大的落差！

msg:春節期間來拉薩。比較了幾家同級別的酒店，從舒適、供氧、餐飲以及服務等方面綜合考慮，選擇了香格里拉，確實讓整個假期非常愜意、開心！

        工作原因，出行臨時推遲了3天，攜程+香格里拉退全款，確定出行後重新預訂。入住時前台美麗的王曉檸女士聽説我參加抗疫工作，將普通大床房升級為景觀大床房，讓人如沐春風，非常暖心，感謝！無論晨暮，隨時都能看到雄偉壯觀、氣勢恢弘又神聖美麗的布達拉宮，再加上每日在各寺各地的遊覽，覺得這是一次無與倫比的心靈之旅。

         餐飲是我選擇香格里拉的重要原因，早餐和晚餐都在酒店裡用，種類繁多就不提了，最重要的是乾淨衞生同時美味可口，而且中餐廳香宮的川菜做的是非常地道，必須點贊！（而且感覺餐廳裏都有供氧）

        房間寬敞舒適整潔，服務及時，是香格里拉的一貫品質。有製氧機，對飛機進藏還是非常必要的。加濕器、送水果、送迷你吧飲品等等就更不必提了。

         總之，以後再來，或者親朋好友來拉薩，我還是會推薦的。

可改進的地方在於，和瑞吉相比，從門口到大堂的路上停車有點混亂。我這次不是自駕來的，不影響，但是自駕的朋友可能麻煩些。

加濕器，每天都有水果供應，基本做到了有求必應。房間的客服電話，衹要一按0不到1秒就可以接通。房間是24小時可以供氧的，而且酒店還有一個氧吧，蘭蘭帶我們過去的，在那邊有沙發和毛毯，氧氣十足，可以很好的緩解高反。前台郭盛小夥子也非常的熱情。餐廳也是十分好評，出品非常的新鮮。如果再次入住，我還會選擇香格里拉，這裏真的非常好的體驗。

2 網上有一些民宿，打着布達拉宮景觀房的招牌 價格堪比五星。 其實人家香格里拉也有布達拉宮景觀房。
3 還是要説服務！ 前台王曉檸和danny真是太貼心了，有求必應，特別是我們這樣有高反的，但是這個也不能怨人家酒店啊，他們為客人最大限度的提供着方便和幫助，房間裏給我送來兩個免費的製氧機，我們一人一個。半夜醫務室也為了我們忙活着，很慶幸定的是品牌酒店，你在外面隨便定個酒店能有這樣的保障嗎？這個給香格里拉加分不少， 
別的城市的香格里拉，我們衹看到了硬件的優質， 不過在拉薩這樣的地方， 太需要幫助了！ 你會有很多情況需要酒店提供幫助。 光是拉行李從酒店大門到房間，你也會因為高反完成不了這個事，人家酒店都給你把這些能做的都做了！  真心推薦 ， 在拉薩 酒店的服務比其他方面更重要！

優點：整體比較安靜，離市區近，去哪兒都比較方便；門口禮賓小哥服務及時到位；洗澡水大且熱。
整體而言，不推薦，建議加點錢住瑞吉，或者遠一點的性價比高的洲際，都可以碾壓這個。

前台小哥哥小姐姐服務熱情周到，主動幫我計算怎麼付房費更划算；服務很好，達到五星級標準酒店的位置非常好，
香格里拉的品質是有最低保障的，不用多説，關鍵在這裏特別推薦房間裏的一台製氧機和加濕器太有用了
前台王曉寧入住的時候貼心的告訴我們如何緩解高反，真的有一種賓至如歸的感覺！！還有南楠經理十分負責任，值得表揚下次來拉薩還是會選擇香格里拉。
還有大廳用餐的服務員都很熱情
小白阿姨看我喜歡喝甜茶，主動幫我續杯
好評！！！

開車到酒店門口，門口兩個工作人員就邊看着我們邊聊天，也不來拿行李，喊了才不情不願地過來，住了幾家松贊，每次都是車還沒停穩就是幾個人一起迎過來。到房間以後送歡迎果盤，兩個蘋果一個橙子，蘋果和橙子上還坑坑窪窪……
房間的製氧機臭烘烘的，沒缺氧先臭暈了……床上有個很大的縫，手機掉下去薅了半天才弄上來

淡季建議住松贊和瑞吉，都免費送早餐和升級房間，這裏啥也沒有。唯一的優點就是比瑞吉和松贊便宜一點，但是不懂為啥是豪華榜第二，沒看懂，還不如觀景民宿的服務。跟其他城市的香格里拉比，差了十萬八千里

ps：希望酒店在早餐自助餐時，能考慮單人是否可以放置一塊什麼證明之類的？因為去拿食物的時候，餐桌很容易被不斷清潔。。。
