msg:During my recent stay at a hotel booked through Trip.com, I encountered several issues that left me dissatisfied. Firstly, despite specifically booking a non-smoking room, the hotel had a noticeable smell of smoke throughout, indicating a failure to properly enforce non-smoking policies. Moreover, the hotel itself appeared to be quite old and in need of maintenance.

On a positive note, the room service staff were helpful and responsive to my requests. However, I was disappointed to find out that the hotel's facilities were undergoing maintenance during my stay. This made it inconvenient for guests, especially families with babies, as there were multiple flights of stairs and a lack of baby-friendly amenities.

Another disappointment was the lack of attention to detail in the restaurant. I observed that the tablecloths were not changed after guests finished their meals, which raised concerns about hygiene.

Overall, my experience at this hotel fell short of my expectations. I hope that hotel takes this feedback into consideration to ensure a more enjoyable and hassle-free experience for future travelers.

They upgraded our room, thank you very much! They brought baby slippers and bath accessories for my daughter! The only big negative about the rooms when you are traveling with a child is the open toilets (blinds instead of regular doors). Large swimming pool, two restaurants. They gave us a dozen fresh oysters. Wonderful view from the room!

msg:I had a disappointing experience at this hotel. Despite their assurance of non-smoking rooms, the room I was assigned had a noticeable smoke odor and to add to that, there was an ashtray placed on the table. 

The restaurant also left much to be desired. The staff neglected to change the tablecloth after guests finished their meals, opting instead to only clear the dishes. It was quite disheartening and did not meet my expectations.

msg:We stay seven nights in this hotel. There are many positive and negative experience during our stay.ü§î

First, hotel is not in seaside don't thing it's near to the beach. You need drive for short time to reach xiadong hai or dadongha beaches and they don't provide shuttle.üò≤ Hotel view is marina and Sanya city center. They have nice bathtub on balcony. Outdoor pool is little hard to reach but ok. You need to go first floor from second floor loby and take stairs 3 floors up to  pool. Biggest problem is, they close the pool so early, 5 pm. And how come they don't supply towels or other stuff on pool site. Normally other  metropark hotels provide. They don't even play music or sell some drinks around pool. 

Second, breakfast variety is good as expected from Metropark hotel chain but it so crowded and there's no enough staff to maintance the open buffet, most times hard to find place to sit and you need to go other saloon where is little away and has just 20 percent of the real buffet and the saloon smells bad air.. Many times, hard to find milk, cups even forks. But there are olives  üíõ. You can also try their package dinner for two people it was delicious.

Thirdly, when we booked seven days the hotel price was reasonable later it get more than double, they did not add two more days with same price we book-in. That was little rude. Front desk was saying, why don't you rent another hotel. So yeah they simply don't want you to stay.üëé

And, some days we need to ask to tidy up or room otherwise they will not do it. Many times we call housekeeping to provide use clean towels and tidy up the room.üëé

Now let's talk about the most critical side. Hotel is near the clubhouse and night there are some luxury cars horn all the night. You can't sleep while balcony doors are open since 2 am. Those cars horn all night to show up themselves. So if you want little peace don't rent this hotel.,üëé

Overall, I can't say the hotel experience is notüö´üö´üö´üö´üö´ worth it's price. I would rent another hotel near seaside but without breakfast and I could enjoy many shops around beach and have breakfast, lunch, dinner etc.

msg:Chinese hotel with nominal cost for the executive room. Check in was easy. Breakfast was Chinese, but so many options that you can find something to eat. The room was very large with full master bath and a half bath in the entry. There's a bath tub in the bedroom and a massage chair, which requires payment. 28¬• for 20 minutes. There's a long balcony with a view of the bay, lots of yachts, jet skiers, and junk boats. However, it (the balcony) only has a small table and two hard chairs. The hotel is nestled in the local community and if it had not been drizzling I may have explored it. Swimming pool was located outside the building a short walking distance from the hotel, once I found it, I was not interested in climbing the steps to view it.   The hotel is older and could use some upgrades to the rooms. The bathroom had a funny smell to me and was poorly lit. The aircon worked well for cooling the room at night. It's a short didi ride to the main road where Dolphin and Pizza Republica (highly recommend giving them a try, but no alcohol) are located. This place is definitely not five stars by western standards. I don't have any major complaints, but I would not stay there again just because it didn't suit my taste.

The sea view room is opposite to Hongzhou Wharf. The high floor has a good view. The room is clean and tidy. The housekeeper cleans the room in time. The swimming pool is also very large and the lobby is also very impressive. There was a heavy rain in the afternoon. The housekeeper helped us move all the clothes that were hung outside to the room. The child accidentally spilled water on the bed. After contacting Amy, the housekeeper helped us change it. Thanks to the housekeeper Amy and the housekeeper again.

msg:This is really the only hotel I've stayed in where the hardware facilities don't match the service. I was wake surfing nearby and finished the room I booked temporarily. I wanted to check in immediately, but it was too early and the room was not ready yet, so I went to the swimming pool to stay for a while. To be honest, the environment is really disappointing. There are small flies in the locker room and the environment of the entire swimming pool is very uncomfortable because the facilities are old. I was thinking of staying for a day and planning to change hotels the next day. The facilities in the room are old-fashioned five-star wooden products. They are really too old. But the service afterwards made me change all my ideas. The guy at the swimming pool took the initiative to help me contact the front desk to expedite check-in. Later, another guy ran over and shouted to me that Ms. Cheng could check in. It was very thoughtful. The joy of the front desk warmed me even more. They helped me expedite the room and thoughtfully asked the housekeeping to turn on the air conditioner for me. I wanted conditioner, so I asked the aunt to bring it to me immediately and also brought me two more bottles of water. It seems very ordinary, but all the actions are very thoughtful. The facilities are old, but the service really exceeds many international five-star hotels

The facilities in the room are conservative and old, which is worthy of the current price.
The most favorite thing is this terrace. Although it is not very useful, it makes people feel happy.
The service is 95 points, and there is still room for improvement. The situation of ignoring people and having a bad attitude at the front desk as mentioned on the Internet did not happen.

I originally booked a low floor, but the housekeeper helped me upgrade to a high floor for free. It was really nice. The service attitude of the hotel staff was also first-rate. What impressed me most was that on the first day of our stay, we went out to play and came back to find that the waiter who helped us clean the room took the initiative to get us a lot of hangers when we saw that we didn‚Äôt have enough hangers for our washed clothes. It was really touching. On the second day, when we came back from the play, there were four more bottles of mineral water in the room, and a handwritten note reminded us to pay attention to drinking water in hot weather. These small details are really touching. I will recommend it to friends who come to Sanya in the future.

1. She said that there was only one set for one order, and gave me a set of menu, which was 108 yuan;
2. Later, I showed her the order, and she still said a lot. In the end, she couldn't make sense, so she reluctantly took out the menu of 108 yuan.
3. When I arrived at the restaurant, the dishes came, and I found that the "oysters" on the order were 6/portion, 2 portions of 12, and now there are only 6. I asked the restaurant waiter, and he said that "my menu is a single set meal" ~~ I was bored ~~ Then I could only let Ctrip customer service to negotiate, and then it was solved.
Through this incident, I must find Ctrip. Ctrip customer service is very serious. I have heard the bad comments about traveling to Sanya, and I have experienced it myself.
Please also ask "Meijing International Hotel" to investigate at the front desk.

You must participate in the free yacht project offered by the hotel, but you must purchase the self-funded project that costs 130 yuan per person to go up to the second and third floors, because the yacht experience on the upper floor is great, the field of vision is wide, and the sea view is better, especially when sailing Soon we will be able to take close-up photos of the Phoenix Island landscape. You can participate in other optional activities on the yacht according to your own preferences. There are no mandatory activities, so we did not participate in anything. The hotel has a free small fish spa in the swimming pool, where we also experienced After a while, it was quite comfortable. In short, the two days of staying in your hotel not only brought us surprises, but also added a lot to the success of our entire Sanya trip.

msg:Special thanks to Brother Huanxi in the front office, who is kind, thoughtful and gentle. He watched me bring my children and elderly people and upgraded my room for free.
From Yalong Bay to Dadonghai, this hotel surprised me. As a long-established star hotel in Sanya, it has coconut shell doors, large cantilevered beams, high columns, and circular corridors, full of southern style. This feeling is irreplaceable in many new hotels.
The hotel rooms are very spacious, especially the bathrooms, which are very friendly to guests with children.
The location is excellent, close to the Sanya Yacht Center. You can watch the yachts leaving the port at 9:00, and the night view is also beautiful. It is 12 kilometers away from Sanya Station, which is quite convenient.

When I called the front desk to check in, Xiaoshuang was very patient. A new room card was also delivered. It will be much easier for us to move things.
Facing the harbor, you can see yachts of various sizes coming in and out during the day and evening. The night view of the city center is also very beautiful after dark.
The breakfast is also very richüòã. The breakfast area was very large but there were more people in the first two days. If you get up late, you will have to wait a little longer to share a table. In the next two days, more areas were opened, and the space was very sufficient.

msg:I was upgraded to a Deluxe Panoramic Suite. Therefore, I was satisfied with everything, despite the disadvantages. In total I extended my stay to 9 days.
Rooms with such panoramic views are corner rooms with long loggias (N22 on each floor). There are 4 windows in total in this room, 3 overlooking the loggia overlooking Phoenix Island, one window above the bath overlooking the marina.
One of the most significant disadvantages of the hotel is the lack of soundproofing from the street:
- until 7 am, military chants can be heard under the windows, but not every morning.
- from 8 a.m. the hum of construction, which is on the other side,
- as well as the horns of passing boats, some of which make everything shake.
- road noise under the hotel.

msg:The hotel has a Southeast Asian style, with a black and red color scheme. The lobby is not bright, and the room is even darker. The hotel has been around for a long time, so I won't mention the sanitation issues. The night view in the sea view room is pretty good. If you just look at the sea view, it's still okay, but forget about the living experience.
Breakfast was not served at 9:30, and the most important thing was that the hygiene was so bad that there were actually hairs in the dishes (see picture 3)! The table was not wiped clean, and the food was not as good as the breakfast restaurants outside. The bread was hard, and except for the porridge and pickles, they were not delicious. It doesn't match the food label at all.
The small fish spa is even worse. There are fallen leaves in the swimming pool. The road leading to the swimming pool is dark and has no lights. It scares the children so much that they have to go back halfway. I really don‚Äôt recommend it.
There was also a TV. I only stayed for one night and the TV had to be repaired twice.
And a refrigerator! I must complain about this, there is no electricity! The jackfruit I put in it stinks!
In short, it is not cost-effective and is not recommended!

We arrived in the middle of the night, and the security guard at the door asked us to park at the door and rest first, and then notified me to move the car the next morning. The hotel facilities are a bit old. The door of the shower room does not close tightly and the hot water in the shower head will suddenly become warm, but it does not affect the use. There is a clothes drying rack on the balcony, which is very convenient and thoughtful. The room is very spacious, and the bathroom and balcony are also large. There is a writing desk for children to do homework. It is recommended to change the desk lamp to be brighter. The cleaning was very timely. The cleaning staff were very nice, enthusiastic and attentive. When they saw mangoes in the room, they left a fruit knife, which was very heart-warming. They also told us that there is a delicious coconut chicken nearby, which is indeed close and delicious. . There is a fruit and seafood market just three to five hundred meters away from the hotel. The fruits are cheap and fresh, but it‚Äôs hard to comment if you don‚Äôt eat seafood there. When you go out, turn right and walk a hundred or two meters. There is a fishing village with coconut chicken, barbecue, etc. It was my first time to come to Sanya and I felt very satisfied staying here. I sat on the balcony to enjoy the breeze and watch the drone show at night. The night view was amazing. Looking forward to coming again next time!

The sea view room has a very wide view, and you can take a relaxing bath while overlooking the entire city center of Sanya. The hotel manager's service attitude was very good. There was a discrepancy between the booking time and the system, so I was given an extra day for free. It also comes with free yacht sailing and travel photography services. In addition, the check-in price is relatively low among hotels of the same level. It is the most cost-effective hotel nearby, which is very good.

The only drawback is that the balcony glass door cannot completely isolate the wind, and there is always a whistling wind sound, which affects rest. The scenery outside is good, and you can see a fleet of yachts going out to sea in the morning, which is very lively.

If I come to Sanya again, I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends and family.
It was very interesting to watch the cruise ships and yachts coming in and out. It comforted me that the vast sea in the world is difficult to make water, except that Wushan is not made of clouds and the smoke of the past.
The swimming pool is also very good, very clean and happy.

msg:It can only be said to be very average. One is for overseas travel and the other is for travel photography. It‚Äôs really a scam. Don‚Äôt choose it if you go there just for this. Going out to sea and diving is a pit, and there are various secondary expenses. If you rent a three-story yacht, you will be charged 120 to go to the second and third floors. It's funny, but later I found out that it would be better to go to sea on Wuzhizhou Island. Therefore the service was given 1 point. There is nothing bad about the hotel's service itself, but you bundled such a rubbish package and called it a gift, which lowered the hotel's rating. It's not a loss.

There are yachts that go out to sea, but you have to pay extra to go to the second and third floors of the yacht. More than a hundred yuan per person.

Haha, I don‚Äôt blame the photographer. I don‚Äôt have time to go to the duty-free shop, Xiaodonghai is so beautiful.
Environment: Old brand, high-end, swimming pool and fish spa, sea view room, great night view, sea breeze on the balcony is so comfortable. It costs 12 yuan to take a taxi from Xiaodonghai. Xiaodonghai is more beautiful than Dadonghai and is worth visiting. If I had known it was so beautiful, I would have stayed one more night.

msg:Hygiene: Hygienic and clean. It smells musty, probably because it's close to the beach.
Environment: The environment is good, like a star hotel. However, the hotel is a bit old and the decoration style is a bit old, so the price is cheap for a reason. The overall price/performance ratio is good.
The guy at the front desk has a very good service attitude and helped us upgrade the room type. Like itüëç
I originally planned to extend my stay, but the luxury yacht sailing included in the hotel package was very unpleasant and was all a ruse. After traveling to Hainan for a week, going out on a yacht was the most frustrating experience. The package provided by the hotel can only sit on the first floor. I didn't plan to upgrade, but the promotional staff on the yacht clearly said that the route will pass through the Coconut Dream Corridor, and you will see several scenic spots such as the South China Sea Guanyin. There will be professionals on the third floor of the yacht. Let me explain each scenic spot to everyone. If you don't upgrade, you can only stay on the first floor, and you can't go up to the second or third floors. But you can't see the sea from the first floor. Isn't the purpose of taking a yacht just to see the sea? So I got an upgrade, which cost 600 yuan for four people. The yacht stopped less than three kilometers away, and started selling marine activities, diving, etc. Diving is free, but the mask costs 160. While waiting for the dive, it started selling photos for 300 and videos for 500. Anyway, you have to take pictures when you dive. The posture of the video, and the diving experience is extremely poor, the visibility is very low, because the water near the city is not very clean. In fact, only fishing is free, but fish food is 10 yuan, which is very speechless. . . .
Everyone must avoid lightning in this overseas project. There is no free bargain. This is the only time I step into a trap during a week of traveling to Hainan. It will help me remember it!
So it may be that the experience of this project is very poor, and I don‚Äôt want to extend my stay in the hotel. Please give me a good review for the service of the guy at the front desk and the upgraded room type!

There is also a gym on the fourth floor of the hotel. The swimming pool and fish spa are outdoor. The environment is good and the overall facilities and equipment are satisfactory.

The Boao State Guesthouse is of course also very good, but the room is not big enough. Metropark is also very cost-effective and not far from the scenic spot. It is highly recommended. The room we stayed in had a mountain view of Luhuitou, with the sound of birds chirping, and standing on the large balcony. The air was very fresh, but unfortunately I forgot to take photos.

I said that I saw on the Internet that our room type had been booked today; but then there was no water supply and sanitary napkins and rolls were not replenished, so we had to take the paper out and use it as sanitary napkins;

Why don't you bring some friends to sleep with? They didn't clean the room at 3:30 in the afternoon. After cleaning, they even changed the room key card. Why don't you let me stay? The front desk was even more stupid; I asked him where my room card was and what problems he could help me solve. Please solve your brain problems. Both the service and the sanitary environment are beyond bad.

What is particularly unsatisfactory is the breakfast. Because we are traveling with children, both children have a fever. After two days of eating at the buffet, they are a little tired of it. In addition, the main food for fever is porridge. I asked the front desk in advance if it can be done. I went in with my kids and takeout, and was told that it was okay, but was asked again the next day that it was not okay. We happened to be traveling in a group, and the plan was disrupted!

Before check-in, I asked about our arrival time in advance, and also helped us make an appoin**ent for the yacht to go out to sea in advance. Although we canceled the yacht trip due to other reasons, we must always leave a comma so that we can go out next time. There is also a front desk with accompanying travel service in the hotel lobby. The service is also good. We rented a battery car that can ride more than 100 kilometers and sent it directly to the hotel. Today we rode to the Wuzhizhou Island Visitor Center and visited Wuzhizhou Island. And Houhai Village, when I came back to return the bike, the first battery was not completely exhausted, which is great. We were also very lucky in Wuzhizhou. We saw a group of big sharks in the sea. The security guard told us that they were tiger sharks. What's funny is that the security guard told the people in the water to get up quickly, there were sharks, but instead attracted a large group of people to come to see the sharks.
After talking about the advantages and interesting things, let's talk about the disadvantages. The room facilities are relatively old and not as good as expected, especially the mattress. I feel that these facilities should be updated or redecorated, and there is still a gap between the five-star (five-diamond) level assessed by Ctrip.

msg:Let's talk about the facilities first. They are very old. The tables, beds, and cabinets are all shabby. If you order takeout from the hotel, you have to go downstairs to get it. There is no food delivery robot. The air conditioner is very noisy. The door is not safe. The lock is worn out. The wall is discolored. There are many things of unknown colors. The more you talk about it, the more disgusting it is.
Secondly, hygiene, what is hygiene? There is no hygiene here at all. The bathroom is very dirty, the toilet is yellow, and the pillows, bed covers, and quilt covers are all yellow. It is really disgusting and speechless. There are spots everywhere. The room is very damp and full of moldy smells. It is really the worst place I have lived in.
And the environment, the geographical location is close to the yacht pier. It is really funny to say that it is a sea view room. The sea view outside is like you are looking at a small puddle. Imagine it yourself. The location is average. There are almost no restaurants nearby. I recommend the coconut chicken nearby. I think it is good and cheap. There is nothing left. If you want to go out to eat, you must take a taxi. You can only get it after crossing the bridge.

The most disgusting thing is the soundproofing. I really don't want to curse. What a lousy place and lousy environment. It's so noisy. People are making phone calls, watching TV, moving tables, and being naughty. You can hear the loud voices of others. Even if they are very quiet, you can hear them. The soundproofing is almost negligible. The most annoying thing is the little brats. I doubt it. Are some children born without anyone to take care of them? Parkour in the middle of the night, yelling? Is it the parents or the children who are hopeless!

Sorry everyone, I'm so angry that I can't live here for two days. I changed hotels directly. Please quit. Everyone, take a good look. What I said is all true. Please open your eyes.

The last point is for the cleaning lady. She helped me fold my clothes after I went out. If it weren't for Ctrip's lowest score, I would give it a 0. Please quit! ! ! ! !
I won't post pictures for fear of disgusting you. Alas

The balcony is even more dilapidated, and unknown wires upstairs are exposed. The scenery downstairs includes some yachts stopping in the distance.

msg:When I arrived at the lobby, I was attracted by the music and lights. The tavern in the lobby is in trial operation. The beer, seafood, and barbecue snacks are not bad. The price is beautiful, very beautiful. The children each took two German-style hot sausages, which were very fragrant. The front desk will upgrade the Minions themed room for an additional fee, with a tent, and the little guy has a Coke breakfast. The lady at the front desk is rather shy, but she enthusiastically added children's breakfast, which surprised me a little. There are even cotton candy from my childhood. It may be for children. Like it! Children and children are clamoring to play swimming. The swimming pool is large and open-air. On the mountainside, there are small rowing boats and hand-cranked boats. The guys are very happy. The hotel is a little old, but the supporting facilities are still complete. , Overall it's pretty good, the room is big. It is also very bright, and the sanitation is also very good. It is worth recommending. I will come again next time I come to Sanya for vacation.

The facilities of two or three hundred are really worth it! !! Ms. Huang at the front desk is also very nice. She upgraded the room for me. The view is superb. You can watch the sea view of Hongzhou Yacht Wharf and Phoenix Island. The first market is also very convenient to take a taxi for about 12 yuan. Go swimming at Dadonghai Beach at 4.5 pm. After eating at Big Pineapple, you can walk back to the hotel if you want to digest your food.

msg:I have stayed in five hotels from south to north, and I have stayed in the worst hotel in Sanya N times regardless of hardware and software. I don‚Äôt know how the five diamonds are judged? !
Arriving at the front desk on the first day of check-in, the waiter had a cold face and no basic greeting language. When I entered the room, I found that the tea kettle was half full of water, and there was a long hair on the table that was dirty. I told the waiter to come and wipe it off , and then explained that she forgot to boil the water. (Can the waiter boil water in the guest room?).
The front desk booked to go to the big bar of the Haitang Bay Duty Free Shop and was told that there were only two hours, which was inconsistent with the time written on the official website. After consulting the front desk staff, they said it was impossible.
The room was musty and dark and damp. The annoying thing is that there is no hot water in the shower, and the water suddenly turned into boiling water after ten minutes of washing. I was shocked, but fortunately, I didn't burn it. I told the front desk to wait for half an hour before the maintenance master came up to check and said that the equipment was broken! Then let it go!
The swimming pool next to the road seems to be shared by two families. Anyone can go in and swim without a guard. Many people nearby swim in the swimming pool with messy clothes.
The location is relatively remote, and it takes about ten minutes to walk to the nearby fish village to eat, and the distance between two or three bus stops is relatively far!
The overall evaluation is really bad, and the price/performance ratio is not worth it!

msg:First of all, this is my second revisit to Hainan. The first time I traveled in Hainan, I was in a rush. I chose a B&B, and the experience of staying in it is hard to describe. If you want to live comfortably, you should stay in a hotel. If you think about cooking by yourself, you can consider a B&B.
Next is the key point, the important reason for choosing Metropark Luling Hotel Sanya, please listen to me carefully.
1. The hotel is located in Luling, Luhuitou's Lover's Island. It is the best choice for looking for high cost performance, perfect night view, and sea view. Compared with most hotels, it is not directly accessible to the beach. Because of this, there are fewer mosquitoes. , quietly enjoy the private space of couples.
2. The breakfast is rich and the dishes are fresh. Because it is the off-season, there are not many diners, but cleanliness is the first evaluation. I have photos and will put them in the comments.
3. There are too many hotels with good sea views, but I have seen the houses in Yalong Bay, Sanya Bay, and Haitang Bay that are within the budget. I have seen all the house types and scenery. This hotel deserves it.
4. I live in a one-bedroom suite with a bright full sea view. I hope the pictures do not mislead other consumers.
5. The coconut chicken set meal and dross vinegar are really good. If you really can‚Äôt hold on to it for three days, it is recommended to update the set content.
6. The restaurant's service attitude and sales service attitude are good, and can handle problems efficiently, like it.

If you drive a bad car, you will be ignored. The only bright spot is that the breakfast is good, and the meal time is also very humane.

msg:599 for two nights, free afternoon tea, old five-star hotel, very good. For park tickets, you can just go to those Ctrip hotel orders. According to the reviews, they are all charged items, so I didn‚Äôt go to the more routine parks.
Going out to sea for snorkeling is also a routine. My product says it is a speedboat, but it is actually a big boat. I set off early in the morning and return in the afternoon. I spend a day on the boat. After reading some reviews, it is basically a full routine. I can‚Äôt get off the boat for a day after being routine, so I know why some people want to go back when I go back halfway through the travel instructions, and I don‚Äôt go, there are too many routines.
The front desk of the hotel I was following did not mention it at all, nor did I ask.
For the small fish, you can get fish therapy right after staying in the hotel, so there is nothing special about it, just some fish in a small pond.
Anyway, except for the afternoon tea, the other complimentary items are all routines, which have nothing to do with the hotel, so don‚Äôt worry too much about it.
The price of 300 yuan per night is very cost-effective, much better than the Express Hotel. There are large rooms, you can see the sea view of the harbor, rich breakfast, and considerate room service. 300 yuan per night in the off-season is still super worth it.
Behind the hotel is Luhuitou Park, if you are lucky, you will see wild monkeys. In short, the price is high, there is nothing to be hypocritical, and I will go again if I have the opportunity in the future. The hotel has a small swimming pool, which is good for taking children to play.

msg:This is the second time I have stayed in the sea view room and the mountain view room. The location of the hotel is very good. This time I stayed in the mountain view room. The hotel manager Xie was very kind and thoughtful. He contacted me in advance and helped me upgrade the room, the mountain view Outside the balcony of the room is the Luhuitou Scenic Area, the scenery is very beautiful. The hotel has complete facilities. There are book bar, coffee bar, leisure area and swimming pool in the hotel, especially the buffet breakfast. The dishes are rich and delicious. These are what customers can experience. The hygienic environment in the hotel is well maintained. Parking is also more convenient. The hotel's service is really considerate. Manager Xie consulted about the child's situation in advance and prepared a fruit plate for us. When the hotel service staff cleaned the room, they specially prepared bathrobes for the child and placed fruit knives for our fruit plate. The details make us feel very heartwarming. This is a safe haven with warmth. I wish you all the best and every staff member goes well.

msg:Location and transportation: Relatively speaking, it feels a bit remote. There is a fishing village nearby. You can go here for food. It is still a long walk from the east beach. It takes about ten minutes by taxi

Environmental services: After all, it is still an old five-star hotel, and the quality is still there. The lobby looks relatively high-end and a**ospheric. After you arrive, there will be a waiter who will open the door for you to take your luggage. The service is still good. There is also a book bar in the lobby. Going in, there is an open-air table and chair area, it is still good to read a book here

Room facilities: We booked a mountain view room. After checking in, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were given a sea view room. There was a big balcony opposite a pier. The night view here was beautiful, and there was a drying rack on the balcony for drying Clothes and facilities in the room are a bit old, but overall it‚Äôs okay, but the sanitation still needs to be improved, and because it‚Äôs next to the road, it‚Äôs a bit noisy, by the way, remember to light mosquito coils after check-in, the first night Just because there is no point, the child has been bitten a lot

Breakfast: Breakfast is from 7:00 to 11:00, which is quite friendly for people who sleep late. We have breakfast and lunch directly together haha, and the breakfast is quite rich

Swimming pool: It‚Äôs on another building, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to find. The swimming pool is relatively large, and there‚Äôs a small fish spa area, which kids like very much.

Children's play area and gym: on the fourth floor, the play area is not big, and there are not many things to play. I feel that the air inside is not good, as if it has not been cleaned for a long time, so I came out soon, and the gym is the same, no People are all ashes

To be honest, the facilities and equipment of the hotel are not bad. When standing on the balcony of the room facing the luxury yacht marina, I immediately feel that this vacation is very special. However, when you face the tired and mechanical smiling faces of the waiters, you will understand how hard their work is when a hotel is full every day, and you will also understand that their service cannot be proactive and enthusiastic! When we checked in, we had to wait for three hours to get the room, not to mention the embarrassment of not being able to find a seat at breakfast. So we have to think deeply about a question, that is, although low-price sales can increase the quantity, can the quality be maintained at the same time?

I am very grateful to the staff Xie Jinlan and Xing Fuchun for their warm and thoughtful service and arrangements. Because I arrived at the store very early in the morning, and the guests in the room I wanted hadn't checked out yet, Xie Jinlan, considering that we are all elderly, arranged for us to rest in other rooms first, so as not to sit in the lobby and wait. This way of respecting and caring for the elderly makes us feel very caring, warm and at home. From the service attitude of the hotel staff, it reflects that the overall management of the hotel is very standardized and the service level is first-class. I am very satisfied and grateful here.

In addition, the reception at the front desk is very average, with poor attitude and ability to handle affairs, and the room card fails after a while, etc. Then let‚Äôs talk about the room. Let‚Äôs talk about the disadvantages first. It‚Äôs been being renovated all the time, and I was woken up very early. The hotel‚Äôs downstairs is a yacht port. All the facilities are quite old, but they are still clean. I like the size of the room very much. It is not small, and it is considered large in a hotel of the same price of 400 yuan. The floor tiles are clean and the balcony is wide. Generally speaking, I think 4.5 points is not too much, not too little. The location is in Dadonghai, opposite to the Seafood Market (No. 1 Market) for eating and shopping. The breakfast is average, but you can eat enough. The noodles are delicious, and the bread is also okay. Overall, it's not bad. [It is recommended to choose a high-rise, the scenery is beautiful, the water temperature in the bathroom is very good, and the luxury sea view room] Actually, if the price is right, it is good to stay for a few more nights. We stayed for four nights.

Originally, I just stayed overnight for a late flight, so I didn't expect much. There are not many varieties of breakfast, so it‚Äôs okay to eat casually, in line with its price of around thirty or forty. And the advantage is that it can go until 11 o'clock, although there are not many dishes in the back.
The outdoor pool was not open in December and the water was drained.
The advantage is that it is close to the city, it is convenient to eat, and the hotel looks the most beautiful from a bridge.

msg:I'm so screwed, folks, this hotel is so run down.

1. After checking out, the front desk did not check out in the public security system, which caused me to be unable to check in at other hotels. I called the hotel to ask the public security system to check out, but no one answered the phone.
2. The deposit was not decompressed in time after check-out, and it was not refunded in the same way within 24 hours.
3. The ID card was left in the room, and the hotel didn‚Äôt notify me. I didn‚Äôt remember that the ID card was left in the room until after playing in the afternoon, and then called the hotel. I called a few times, but no one answered at all. I had to drive to the hotel to get it, but I arrived at the hotel Finally, there were only three people at the front desk, two were busy checking in, and the other was busy answering the phone. The front desk also told me that no one in the guest room answered the phone, and he didn't know if he picked up the ID card, and then waited in the lobby After 40 minutes, I finally got my ID card.

I'm rather depressed. Is it enough for a hotel with 566 rooms and 3 people at the front desk? ? Is there no switchboard to answer the phone?

4. The location of the hotel is average, and the surrounding area cannot meet the needs of eating, drinking and shopping.
5. The aisles and corridors are dimly lit, giving people a gloomy feeling.
6. The decoration of the room is outdated and old, the area is relatively spacious, and the hygiene is okay, but the bathtub drain pipe on the balcony is broken and out of joint, and there is water on the balcony.
7. I couldn't find a hair dryer when I washed my hair.
8. There are too many, I don‚Äôt want to talk about it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶


Not recommended to live, too hiccup...

Air conditioning facilities are good, health is good. Hotel floor attendants work conscientiously and responsibly. thank you all.
The staff at the entrance of the hotel lobby are also very good. Everyone who comes in is reminded to wear a mask and measure their temperature. Thanks for your hard work.

A small suggestion: Although the hotel facilities are slightly old, the hygiene is good. All the details are well done. It's just that the bathroom in the back room of the suite I lived in would be more convenient if there was a small table against the wall to put some things on.

msg:The decoration style of the hotel has a strong sense of design, and the check-in experience is very warm, which meets expectations. The children had a great time playing in the swimming pool and the small fish pond. The service attitude of the pool staff is also very good, and the smiles are particularly good. Parking is also very convenient, the bus station is just outside the door, and the traffic is very convenient.

msg:In this hotel, our room, the balcony door is broken, and the door of the suite room can't be closed without a door handle. Personally feel that the facilities can only be considered Samsung. What is more unforgettable in the hotel is that the breakfast service time is very long, 7-11:30 and the variety is very rich. After staying for 8 days, I am very satisfied with the breakfast every day. In terms of service, I would like to talk about two places for bad reviews. 1. When we checked in, a customer was messing around with the front desk because of nucleic acid. We were left hanging on the side and waiting for a long time. This is not a 5 star experience at all. 2. I was originally satisfied with the breakfast service. There is a problem with the key card system of this hotel. During the last two days of my stay, when I used the room card for breakfast, the room number 1531 was actually displayed, which was completely inconsistent with my room 1212. The key is the breakfast. I checked the front desk, a tall and thin female service staff asked me in a questioning tone, and asked me to go to the front desk myself to ask. This is obviously a problem with the hotel system. I ate breakfast here for five days. Now, this card is used every day, and I only stay as a family of three, and there is no way I can get it wrong if there are no companions on other floors. The most outrageous thing is that when I left, I actually saw the front desk shaking my head and rolling eyes at me. I really hope I saw it wrong. In the morning of 7.21 and 7.22, I have seen this waitress at the breakfast front desk for the past two days. You can check it in the hotel. This time, I stayed for 8 days, which is a more in-depth experience. You get what you pay for every penny. If there are problems with the facilities, it can be tolerated, but there are problems with the service attitude. This is really unbearable. For those on a budget, I highly do not recommend this hotel and will not stay again next time! Give one more star to the cleaning aunt, who is very responsible and greets you every time.

msg:The first time I took my child out, the front desk staff was very attentive. When I saw that I was bringing my children, I recommended the hotel's hottest Minion family room, and added a little room fee, but my daughter liked it. There is a small children's playground in the lobby. There is another one on the 4th floor, and my daughter had a great time. The breakfast is still very rich, and there is also a children's area, which is good. The view from the balcony is full of lush scenery, which is refreshing. Personally think it is a very cost-effective hotel.

The decoration has a Southeast Asian style, and the doors and some furniture have coconut shell decoration, which is very beautiful. The location is excellent, very close to the Luhuitou scenic spot. Plus Starbucks coffee coupons. Hey, you can save it and use it. Yesterday's coupon expired today.
The disadvantage is that there is a big restaurant next door, which feels like that kind of entertainment place. Parking is a little difficult to find a seat after every evening.

msg:On my first trip to Shanghai after June, I booked the Grand Metropark Hotel Sanya Luling Bay on Ctrip. I booked a room for a day to experience it because it should have a low score on Ctrip. But after checking in, I felt good. First, the main desk upgraded the deluxe room. The hotel room is large and relatively clean, the air conditioner is very cold, the water is very large, the balcony can see the yacht marina, and the breakfast is very rich, but you can have breakfast at 11:30 in the evening without any problem. Also provided Starbucks coffee. It is also very convenient to take a taxi when going out. The fare to Dadonghai, the first market, etc. is about 10 yuan. The price is very high, worthy of the price, so I continued for another six days. Will choose this hotel next time.

I booked a room at random. The "Swallow" from the Administration Depar**ent saw that I was lonely and pitiful, and gave me a breakfast. I would like to express my gratitude here.
The hotel is very close to Luhuitou. It just started from 7.1. Luhuitou is free to climb by the way. After the climb, return to the hotel and take a comfortable bath.

When I came here, it was the second day of the typhoon. There were broken down cars on the road, and the hotel guys were very busy.
The rooms in the urban area are relatively old. This room is beyond expectations. The little yellow people element baby likes it. The balcony can see the sea view. It is very comfortable to sit and enjoy the sea breeze~
The breakfast is quite rich. By 11:30 at noon, you don't have to think about getting up early to catch breakfast, and even saving lunch after eating üòÇ
The attitude of the waiter is very good, the speed is also very timely, and the items are delivered quickly when you call~

msg:I rarely leave reviews before, but as a self-media person (non-tourist) I want to develop the habit of leaving reviews.
This time I mainly came here for half vacation and half work. I stayed here for 10 days and nine nights. I worked in the house for most of the time. Ctrip chose to upgrade the room, which should mean going from a low floor to a higher floor. The view is very good. The harbor view is unobstructed, whether it is night view or daytime~ A friend posted on WeChat Moments and said it looks a bit like Hong Kong~ Personally, I think this kind of sea view is more interesting than the bare sea~
in conclusion:
The overall environment is OK. The hotel looks like an old five-star hotel in Sanya. Although it is not new, it is very clean. I am not picky about the environment. I am not like many people who complain about the slightest damage. I live on the 1627 side. In the room, the time-lapse photography of the dock and boats was great, but I forgot to take the time-lapse photography of the night scene. I will make up for it next time~ September should still be the off-season~
The location of the hotel is also good. It is very convenient to take a taxi to Dadonghai, Xiaodonghai and Sanya Bay. If you are looking for fun and food, there is a small street next to it, which is full of food and supermarkets. The first coconut chicken is very good. I come here every year. I will come here to eat twice in Sanya~ There is a coastal path along the hotel towards Lover's Bay, which is very suitable for taking pictures and recording videos, and you can see Phoenix Island~
Let‚Äôs talk about some shortcomings~
1. The swimming pool is not in the hotel, but on a hill outside. Although I found a side-door elevator leading directly to the swimming pool on the last day of my stay, it was still very inconvenient, and the scenery was not very good. It was definitely not as good as the seaside of Yalong Bay, or where I had stayed before. Center Crown, so I didn‚Äôt swim even once, so I had a fish massage. It was free and not bad~ By the way, there should be a chicken pen on the back side of the lounge chair across the wall, and the smell of chicken poop was very strong...
2. Disposable slippers are too cheap, not much better than an express hotel~
3. When I booked it with Ctrip, it was supposed to give me free Starbucks coffee once I booked it. But I renewed it several times in a row, and it was given again in the last two days of renewal. I didn‚Äôt get any in the past few days, and I felt uncomfortable~
4. The breakfast is a bit above average, just an ordinary five-star standard, not amazing, not as good as Hilton or Sheraton. Breakfast is until 10:30, but I think it can still be eaten after 11 o'clock, which is good. Breakfast for two Just add 30 more, it‚Äôs a good deal, equivalent to brunch, even though I‚Äôm alone~
It‚Äôs more than 1,800 points for 9 nights, which is more than 200 points per night. It‚Äôs very cost-effective. I can come again next time ~ same room type ~ By the way, in fact, there are Sanya consumption coupons recently, which are also very cheap, but I did some calculations, and this hotel In fact, the hotel booked on Ctrip is very good. There are more items on **, but it is a little more expensive. The one in Yalong Bay on ** is better and much cheaper~
PS: If you think the picture looks good, you can pick it up by yourself~ By the way, I think the hotel prices will increase a bit in July. After all, summer is here and the high school and college entrance examinations are over. If you want to come in the off-season, you can wait until September~

Let's talk about the hotel experience: the location, at the foot of the Luhuitou Scenic Spot, Giti is convenient and easy to find; it has been in business for many years, but the maintenance of facilities and equipment shows that the hotel is very attentive; service: whether it is the young lady or the eldest sister Enthusiasm, good service, especially everyone in the room, locals, shy but caring. The breakfast is a highlight, you can eat it until noon, especially after 11:00, there are still many dishes. The rooms are large, and the view from the balcony amazes me. I didn't expect it to be so beautiful. My friends said that next time I come to Sanya, I will stay here and experience the legend of Luhuitou Scenic Spot.

There is actually a Starbucks. It is a hotel with a Starbucks, which provides a very good office scene. After waiting for about 30 minutes, I was notified to check in and insisted on being delivered to the room. Moreover, the computer charging cable for Internet access has been arranged in the room, which is very warm and meticulous. For food, the hotel package is very favorable and the taste is moderate. You can eat here at the hotel without having to eat takeaway. Booked the Luhuitou view room, the balcony looked green and quiet, and it was very comfortable to take a break from computer work. Guests who want to be quiet can choose this room type, which is generally good. There is also a swimming pool. It is very large and beautiful on the mountain. After work, I went for a swim, which is very good!

üßπHygiene: How should I put it, housing prices are very cheap in the off-season. After the impact of high-density work during the annual vacation, it is normal for the staff to slack off in the off-season, and the problems are not big problems - if you don't nitpick.
üçÉEnvironment: The surrounding area is surrounded by high-end hotels. Generally speaking, it is very quiet. I decided to watch the sea from the balcony, and the scenery is not bad.
üîîService: The concierge guys are all very good, a little dull. The front desk service attitude of the front office is relatively poor. The things you consult or explain to him can be completed, but the words and handling methods are very indifferent. Even if I communicate with them cordially, the feedback I get is no different. It is estimated that They are all interns.
ü•õBreakfast in the lobby: The types of breakfast are quite rich, including pasta, rice, bread, coffee, milk, and beverages, which are basically similar to other five-star hotel dishes.
Sleep: The bed is very soft. It should be suitable for people in their 20s and 50s to sleep well. Sleeping on a soft bed over 60 may cause back pain.
Mini Bar (Small Refrigerator): Call the front desk for free drinks, two bottles of fruit milk and two bottles of Sprite.
About room type upgrade rights: If there is no room type on the day of check-in, it will not be upgraded. Please pay attention to the reservation.
Overall feeling: The software can't reach a five-star hotel, the hardware is okay, and it is recommended to stay.

msg:Generally speaking, I still like this hotel, but when I checked in, I was not very satisfied with some facilities. The lights in front of the door were flickering, and it was very noisy after 10 o'clock in the morning. It was the machine that the staff used to wash the floor , The sound was very loud and really noisy. I called the front desk, and the front desk said that the opposite side was under maintenance. We opened the door to see that it was cleaning with a machine. It was really noisy. In general, many facilities in the hotel are old. But what I like very much is that the room is very large and decorated in Chinese style. I have stayed in this hotel twice, except this time there is a small episode. I was very satisfied with the previous stay

msg:Location: Near Dadonghai business district, near Luhuitou Scenic Spot, near urban duty-free shopping center, convenient transportation, the balcony of the hotel's high-rise rooms overlooks Phoenix Island and Hongzhou International Yacht VIP Wharf. The time-lapse video is simply not too beautiful, and there is no need to use any aerial drone perspective at all.

Rooms: To be honest, the furnishings of the hotel lobby and guest rooms are indeed a little old, but it shows its former glory. The decoration style of Southeast Asian island buildings is full of exotic flavors. After staying fortunately to upgrade the room type this time, the room is really big, with a bathtub, double sinks and other facilities. And the current price is reasonable. If your travel budget is limited, it is better to save accommodation costs and experience some island travel projects, such as yachts, which are quite fragrant.

Service: The staff of the hotel's front desk, cleaning, doorman, restaurant, and engineering depar**ent are all very polite, and will take the initiative to greet you and press the elevator for you when you are carrying your luggage. Now that the hotel and Starbucks have cooperation, you don't need to go out to find, you can enjoy a cup of pure Starbucks coffee in the hotel lobby bar. The varieties are: American, mocha, latte, cappuccino, etc. I can choose.

Breakfast: The complete range is comparable to those of the international chain brand five-star resort hotels by the sea in Sanya. I hope the taste can be improved. In addition, the Bauhinia Hall is slightly humid and hot. If the environment is cooler, then the dining experience will be perfect. .

msg:First, the front desk of the hotel didn't know whether it was the lobby manager or what job it was, and the face was sullen and the tone of voice made people uncomfortable. This is a personal feeling that can be ignored. It's just that I personally think that the facade of the hotel is soft-spoken and humble. It may be that I am not quite used to this kind of direct giving.
Second, the power went out three times at night, and it was directly dark. I was also drunk. The hotel didn't know about it at all. I contacted Ctrip customer service, and the customer service helped me follow up. The hotel sent an electrician to the room to check the wiring, and then at 11 pm It was embarrassing that the electrician was standing in our room with a ladder at 3:30. The hotel did not do any follow-up plans. The electrician said that if there is any problem in the future, he will contact them again. Someone is on duty, but he said nothing else.
Third, when I booked the hotel, I saw that 5 abalone and 5 oysters were delivered. When I got to the room, I found out when I saw the order details. I asked the customer service of Ctrip. It is understandable that the hotel is limited to dine-in and can not take out, and then asked to check out before 12:00. The cleaning aunt came to knock on the door at 11:30 and said that the front desk asked him to come up to clean up, and asked if we were leaving. I hurried downstairs to the front desk to get a coupon and went to the third floor to eat oysters and abalone. After sitting for more than half an hour, the abalone was very fresh, but the oysters were not good. I will not evaluate the quality. Checked in at the hotel, and my wife and I directly pulled the stomach and lost weight. I'm really speechless. If it's not fresh, don't give it away, okay? Isn't it worth it? ? Everyone who wants to check in is for your own reference.

As soon as you enter the house, the smell is very unpleasant, like the smell of an old orphan who hasn't bathed for several years, and it's so disgusting that you can't resist the smell even if you spray perfume! Opening the balcony door doesn't work. The quilt is very thin! Things are too old, no mirror headlights, no vanity mirrors! The lighting in the living room is very dim, I don't know if it is broken! The toilet paper is installed so low, is it for a one-year-old child? It's just too much work! At 7:30 in the morning, there were service staff shouting slogans downstairs for a long time. There are children upstairs who have been shouting since the morning, watching TV, talking, and the sound insulation is so speechless. This hotel gives me money and I don't even want to live in it.

The service staff are afraid that the guests will take advantage of it, which makes people very uncomfortable. Another influence is that I don‚Äôt want to re-invest in hardware facilities, and I have been living on my own. The room I lived in was a deluxe sea view room. The toilet smelled bad and there were not enough sockets. Scanning the code to pay is always a malfunction. There are no disposable slippers in the room, and the plastic slippers exude a stench. The breakfast variety is acceptable, but everything is the same as the hotel facilities. You get what you get for every penny. There is a reason why the price is so low. The above evaluation is based on 5-star status. If you compare it with an express hotel, there are still many merits.

msg:1. When we arrived at the store, we checked in. There was a tour group with the last person left in front. I queued up there for a long time and arrived at my front desk and asked me to check in next door. The attitude is extremely impatient. Why don't you tell me when you can't handle other people's queuing here? Let's talk about it when it's queued? Asking a question is also a very perfunctory attitude. You can check in at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and must check out at 12 o'clock? The cleaning lady said that it can be delayed appropriately according to the situation. When calling the front desk, she said she was very tough and said no? I didn't even go to the helicopter base.
2. After checking in, I went to the room, and a musty smell came to my face as soon as the door was opened. The corners are dusty, the shower in the bathroom is broken and leaking, the bedside and sofa are yellow, and it is disgusting. Isn't it the most basic condition that a hotel still has? It is said that the sea view room is not the same as the pictures on the Internet. It is not a front sea view room at all, but on the side! And there was a huge machine downstairs, which was so loud all the time. At night, I can hear the cry of the child next door, and I can even hear the sound of people flushing the toilet!
Generally speaking, this is a very poor experience, and the front desk is almost finished. It's exactly the same as I owe him 8 million! The room facilities look old and dirty! After staying in the hotel so many times, the first bad review will be given to your hotel, you are welcome!

The main part of the hotel is a building, the swimming pool is halfway up the mountain, and the lobby is magnificent and magnificent. Looking at the mountains from the back, facing the sea, facing Sanya's marina. The rooms are large and hot enough. They basically have balconies and bathtubs on the balconies. The cleaning staff are very enthusiastic and have a good attitude. There are also robots to help deliver food. There is also a paid massage chair in the room. The disadvantage is that wifi and the mobile phone's own network are not very good, which should be the cause of the nearby unit. You need to spend money to buy movies on TV. A little more people checking in at the front desk can't handle it. I waited for two hours for check-in. While waiting, a buddy who renewed called and ran to the front desk to toss for more than two hours. He didn‚Äôt get it right and howled loudly in the corridor.

[Transportation] The location of the hotel is easy to find, it is on the side of the road, the car goes directly to the door, and it is not far to eat around
[Hygiene] What I didn't expect was this hygiene. The cleaning was very clean, especially when I came back in the evening and saw that the room had been reorganized. I was very pleasantly surprised. I also made a turn down and I was very satisfied.

During November, two rooms and one living room have sea views, the actual bay view, and you can see a little bit of the sea from the side, but you can‚Äôt see Phoenix Island.

Overall evaluation: Don't go for those who are more concerned about quality, after all, the price of five-star will not be too high-quality


üöó Traffic: general, I drive by car, the parking lot is small, there is no risk of parking spaces when I come back at night

üßπHygienic: The staff is ok, but the corners are not too clean, but basically every hotel can‚Äôt be very clean.


üçÉEnvironment: Generally speaking, the hotel is actually not too old, but it feels like white paint on the whitewashed furniture during the decoration, which is completely irresponsible for the decoration, and all aspects of the bed are indeed an old store. Look at some switches, but only one is effective. For example, in the bedroom, there is actually only one light and several switches.

Scenery: The scenery is average, and there is a construction site downstairs that hurts the scenery

Breakfast; too general, does not match the five-star hotel, not even hot milk, some kind of preparation is too rubbish, if this is acceptable for Home Inn breakfast, in fact, it can not catch up with some Home Inn selected level, for a five-star hotel Too bad, it's okay to bring double breakfast for more than 300 beds.

üîîService: A pile of luggage, no one helps to get the car off, no one to help send them upstairs, don't count on these services. The sanitation staff is still very careful. It can be said that there are no other services

Service: The service is very welcoming, but I feel that there are many people living in the hotel, and I need to wait a moment to ask questions. I chatted with the young lady at the front desk in the evening, and then I realized that the hotel has many treasures. In fact, the restaurant on the 3rd floor has coconut chicken and seafood. The set meal is too cost-effective and cheaper than what we eat out.
