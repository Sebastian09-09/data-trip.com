The customer service was first class, Nikki was particularly brilliant, looking after all our needs and responding quickly to any questions we had. The options of activities in immense - especially for children. There are so many pools that we were spoilt for choice. The room was brilliant, clean and very big. The bed was the most comfortable bed we’ve slept in. Everything was great and we will be back!

Hotel staffs were very helpful, particularly Emily. She contacted me before leaving for Sanya. She also informed us about all the activities available at the hotel and also can be asked about things around Sanya. Other hotel staffs were very nice even those who cannot speak english.
Overall, it was a great experience.

msg:Sofitel has outstanding facilities. 
I selected the hotel specifically because of the activities that are build around younger children 4-9 yrs. 
There is a daily schedule for kids including cooking, go kart introduction sessions, foam party at the kids pool. For the fancy things you will have to pay e.g. Kayaking at the pool. 
We had a room with direct pool access which was the most used feature of the holiday by the young ones. 

The are several pools including an infinity pool closer direction beach. 
No swimming area at the beach. So don’t expect a dip into the sea. 

We stayed either at our room with direct pool access or at the main pool next to the children’s play and pool area. Three slides at the kids area including one with tubes only for children) 

Breakfast is excellent! I blame it for gaining weight. Plus you can get food till 11am. Big plus 

The restaurants at the hotel are very good. One Thai and one Chinese. But not really an every day option for me. Basic dishes start at ard 100 RMB and a Beef Curry ist at 170 RMB. No IPA or Craft beer on the beer list. 

Location is “only” 4 out of 5. 
There’s nothing within walking distance of the hotel.  No restaurant, no bar or anything. So if you wanna go anywhere plan 30-60 min commuting by Didi / Taxi.
Overall a fantastic stay and a big  thank you to Nikki. 
She did a great job as experience manager at Sofitel and is a huge help if you are struggling with Chinese topics.

msg:We stayed during May holidays in Sofitel. The environment was very nice. Our room was comfortable. Breakfast had a quite big choice of dishes. It's a good place to spend time with a family, especially if you have kids. They have many activities for the kids. 
We met some surprises, though. There was no shampoo and shower gel near to the bath tub (only in the shower) and no tooth paste at all. It seems like someone just cleaned the room before we checked in and forgot to put it. The lady, named Joly, was very helpful, she fixed it super fast. Also, Joly organized a cake and a small surprise for me as it was my birthday. She was very attentive.
I think details are very important. And this hotel is fine, but still needs to grow to keep up with the standart. We saw the cookies with a mould on them at the ice cream stall, we informed about it, but noone took them out. Also, the Thai restaurant food was very bad, all the dishes we ordered were like from an avarage not Thai place. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant. Besides that, the impression was good.

They are very attentive with guest needs, and even brought up a birthday cake and a complimentary gift for my partner as we missed his birthday over the Shanghai lockdown. The rooms are very clean, the food is very good, the amenities are really good, the beach is easily accessible although it was a little dirty on the last day of our trip. My only suggestion is that management needs to get the groundskeepers to stop spraying insecticide all over the property during the day when guests are using the swimming pools. It’s not a pleasant smell to have when you are trying to rest. Thank you Nikki for all the help over the week break.

Having Nikki from guest services connect on WeChat prior to and during the trip with helpful information and on the spot service and support was wonderful and an unique personalized innovation. In a way felt like a personal assistant during the vacation stay.

Areas that could be improved are matters dealing with local requirements of COVID testing and/or logistics. Spent half a day trying to figure this point out. For both local Chinese and foreigners this point is a major hassle. Otherwise was a great vacation.

msg:My family and I had a great 7 night stay at the Sofitel, we wish we had booked longer. Definitely the best breakfast buffet we have had in China, with a huge selection of both Chinese and Western foods. There is an excellent Thai restaurant that we visted a few times as well as a nightly dinner buffet. We also used the room service and I especilly rate the wagu beef burger highly. 
The property is very green, with tropical trees and gardens throughout the resort. All of the facilities are maintained well and the kids pool area was getting some maintenance done while we were there. There are about 3 or 4 incredible swimming pools that we spent most of our time in. The gym is also equipped well for hotel standards. 
This is an excellent choice if you have kids. There is an indoor playground, go karts, arcade games, kids club activities, bubble pool parties and so much more. There is always something to do for the kids.
If you need a covid test for your next flight, it is only a quick and easy 5 minute didi/taxi to the 301 hospital to get it done. There is a seperate booth for foreigners/passports and it was a very quick and easy process. We did our 48 and 24 hour covid test there.
When we checked in we were helped by Nikki and she gave us her wechat. She was very helpful and anything we needed, we could just wechat her which was very convenient. Thanks Nikki. 
We highly rate this resort and will definitely return in the future.

msg:Excellent property and location. Property occupies a large sprawling area, with multiple pools offering varied experiences. We had a pleasant stay, but it did seem like they were short handed due to the rise in covid cases during our visit. No one spoke in English, so conversations over the phone were always challenging. 

Our biggest complaint was with regards to F & B. On our first night, we decided to have a drink at the lobby bar - and the personnel there looked like they had no idea what they were doing. They were also not very welcoming, lights were turned off and appeared like they wanted us to just leave them alone! We had a similar experience at the Eau bar near the pool. In addition to the poor (or lack of) service, the drinks quality were also poor. Options were limited to “regular” brands (Jack Daniel’s, Gordon’s, etc.) but prices at 5 star prices. Goes without saying that the personnel had no idea how to make the cocktails.

We had a dinner at the Thai restaurant, and sadly, the prices do not commensurate with the quality of food that was served. Our steamed fish was the most sour dish we’ve ever tasted in our lives. We then ordered a “sweet mango sticky rice”, which was tragically as sour as the fish!! The fact that there was no one understanding our complaint (due to poor language comprehension) further compounded our misery.

Lastly (and this is really a minor issue), there was a “strange” choice of music throughout our stay in the hotel. The Thai restaurant had some House / Slow Techno music in a loop, and the pool area had some music playing out of a broken speaker which was really annoying, as it would have been nicer to just have silence and the sound to the beach. 

Overall an excellent stay, with some minor issues that may be caused by the exceptional circumstances surrounding Covid in China.

Special mention to Emily from Guest relations, who was extremely helpful over WeChat on some of our requests.

The entire check in experience was great, from doorman to front desk staff we felt it was much much better than your neighbor hotels which I don’t want to point out here. Nikki has been a great housekeeper helping us arranging rooms prior to checkin time because I had a 40 days old newborn baby with me, thanks to her we didn’t have to wait till 3PM. Then we had a little disappoint with the towel, I’d rather not to put any photos here because I appreciate the way your staff has handled this matter. Special thanks to you and Rick, if Rick hasn’t followed up with this issue the next day we would moved to another hotel already. We extended our stay because we felt we got really amazing services here at Sofitel. Thank you again for your attention and hosting, we would love to come back, loved this pool side room.

In terms of customer service let me say that we dealt with Nikki , I can only say that she is an asset for the company , her customer service skills are outstanding , polite, respectful,considerate in manner , she and her team looked after us since we steped into the hotel , they added us on Wechat straight away and every day checking with us if we need anything and if there anything that we need to make our stay comfortable , So from here I say , Thanks Nikki for your outstanding customer service we are so happy and because of you and your team we will come back to your hotel again. Hotel has many pools , you almost feel like you have your own private pool to have all day , Kitchen staff always on the look out , always coming to you to take empty plates , filling up your water or drink , and the Chef is a delightful person as I have met personaly , good food , big variety , also if you dont want to eat at the hotel restaurent , there is a noodle bar i recommend and a Thai place i did not try to be honest but you can try and leave feedback.

There are quite a few English speaking staff members if your Chinese is not up to par; Joly and Jason were particularly amazing for us and helped out tremendously with coordinating covid tests for travel. The pools were lovely, but it is unfortunate that you can’t swim in the ocean, however the entire bay is like that. The beach access for a nice walk was still appreciated. We also tried every restaurant, including room service, and all of them were delicious. Absolutely recommend and we will stay again.

I came here with my children and they loved it. The greenery around it is beautiful, rooms are spacious and serene, decoration is lovely and the beach is really neat by (5 minute walk). The sand is very soft and nice. 
There are many activities for children like foam party,t-shirt painting, go karting…
There are 2 pools which close at 9pm (one close to the beach which is a bit hidden so we found it later on). The pool has 1 slide for children (it does closes quite early). 
Breakfast is AMAZING. So much selection and food is so fresh and well priced. We ate in one of the restaurants called Cuisine (has western and Asian food). We are A La Carte when staying at a different hotel nearby as the prices are much better and food is delicious. 
Really recommend this hotel, specially for families with children.

The breakfast buffet offered a grand selection, in 3 days I did not manage to try out everything. Some guests might benefit from reminders not to pick everything and waste/leave most of it. The hotel is committed to reducing plastic waste, why not food waste, too ;) (granted it's the guests that waste). Somewhat disturbing was the techno music that was blasting during breakfast, rather peculiar choice. 
Other than that: clean, quiet, perfect. 
The gym is a nice space with windows and comes with a yoga room right next door, but the gym equipment is rather average, a few machines, free weights, thats it.
Be aware: swimming at the beach is not allowed, but if you walk away from the marked area a bit, you can go in the water. Water is so nice and the beach natural and not crowded.

msg:Overall satisfied, by a very high standard service, in a week of stay the staff was always kind and helpful. Only observation might be that, being an international hotel, English speaking among staff shall be enlarged, especially when it comes to room service calls. Breakfast was great, especially the bakeries (a good signature of Sofitel, noticed in Shanghai as well). The pools are very nice, but kids area definitely needs to be maintained, there are rusted steps and passageways, edge protecting foams collapsed that are dangerous and give a very bad look to the water park. Kids indoor area is divided in two, the karts and games, which needs maintenance as well and the playground, which is very good and with no noticed dangerous corners. Garden is very well maintained. Room was very clean and spacious enough.

The grounds and pools are clean, well maintained and beautiful.  The staff are extremely well trained ,very helpful and knowledgeable. Food and beverage is excellent.  Food is top quality.  The Thai restaurant is particularly noteworthy.  I  suggest you stay in the club rooms as the benefits of afternoon tea and evening drinks with excellent food are worth the cost.

Downside: being a relaxation trip for us, the entertainment helicopter was a bummer, flying over our head continuously when trying to relax by the pool. Quite annoying and also dangerous from our perspective.

msg:Our 4th time in Sanya and we decided to try Haitang Bay again because on the reviews and pictures of this Sofitel. Even though swimming in the sea is not allowed by the authorities in Haitang Bay, I really enjoyed this resort and the leisure it offers, specially the swimming pool area.

We got a premium sea view room (I strongly recommend sea-view room) which was beautifully decorated and very spacious. The small balcony was a nice plus. The bed was very comfortable and AC working as it should.

Since the day before my arrival I was contacted by Michelle who I added on wechat, I really like this kind of service as it provides easy and quick assistance if necessary. She was also very attentive and took care of us all the way. Check-out was super fast, all we did was dropping the room key and later received the billing by mail.

The breakfast was nothing less than I would expect from this level of hotel in terms of offer, but I really enjoyed the quality of the food and layout of the room. 

What I enjoyed most in the hotel was the swimming pool areas. The actually have 2 different pools, a big one close to the rooms and another one close to the beach. Both of them offer different kind of areas to enjoy, for example the bigger one offers a bar area, a separate kids area, and quite a few smaller more private areas  where you can have a chair or sofas. You can also find hammocks laying around the hotel grounds.

An important comment to make is that during peak season the hotel offers helicopter tours, so there will be a lot of take-off and landing during the day. It did't bother us much though.

1. Security and  no responsible mindset:
During our absence 5hours daytime Someone might came our balcony and used our belongings and finally broken it but quite funny thing is that they didn't find any of criminal scene during reviewing CCTV video and they don't have anything to do for my loss and this serious security issue.
2. Documents lost: When I check out they need to show me original documents which is written documents such as copy of passport and forms which is fill in personal information. But they told me they lost can not found it.
3. Release Passat: After check out, I moved to another hotel after 1hour, but I couldn't check in since they didn't released my whole family passport.

It is really sucks I paid so expensive cost them but the resort provided such a terrible security and service level.

I don't recommend you.stay.such horrible place.

The hotel facilities are great, with many amusement facilities for children, but because the schedule was a bit rushed, many of them were not played; the children had a lot of fun in the hotel swimming pool, and they would soak in the swimming pool as soon as they returned to the hotel; the hotel has direct access to the beach, with free sand digging tools, and opposite is Wuzhizhou Island. I went to the island to play for less than an hour and decisively chose to return to the hotel.
The breakfast is very rich. Since I have irregular meals during the trip, I rely on this breakfast.
The housekeeper Angela is very considerate, and she will answer any questions and meet any needs quickly.

The children played and ate, and it was very comfortable. Anna in guest relations provided very good service. I contacted him before working hours, and he responded quickly, and handled it during working hours. I didn't have time to eat the meals included in the package during the two days of stay, but he took the initiative to handle the late check-out on the day of check-out. I was very happy~ I also want to say that the shrimp balls or some other balls in the breakfast noodles are particularly delicious~

One regret is that the afternoon tea in the package cannot be used on the day of check-out because the rules of use are not clear. The guest room has a slight musty smell.

My son likes Sofitel more. There are several outdoor swimming pools of different sizes. My son prefers the 0.9m one (123cm tall), which meets the needs of children of different heights. The breakfast is also delicious, with rich fruits and wax apples. The main thing is that my housekeeper Xiaoyu is so good 🥹, he is always responsive, and I have to give a big thumbs up 👍~ I came to Sanya for five days, and the best meal was the Thai restaurant in the hotel~ Very authentic~! My son didn't want to leave when he left~ I will choose Sofitel Lee and Man again next time~ By the way, the travel photography is simply YYDs, and the package price is not expensive~

msg:I returned to Sofitel Hotel again. This time, I was in a very good mood. The only thing was that **** who was braiding dreadlocks on the first floor was a little annoying. I walked past his stall and asked how much it cost to braid hair. I kept looking at her and waiting for her reply. She probably saw that I didn't bring my child and thought I was just asking casually. She didn't even reply. She was very rude. Her image and temperament were completely inconsistent with the hotel's usual style. I felt that the goods she sold were very low, and **** was even lower. She didn't even have the most basic respect for the guests. No staff in the hotel would treat customers like her. I asked the same question loudly for the second time. She didn't even raise her eyelids and kept staring at her mobile phone: Then she replied very impatiently that the price was different, and then there was nothing. I really don't understand, why is Sofitel Hotel's business so bad? Find such a person to cooperate? The bad influence brought to the hotel cannot be underestimated. I will definitely go to Sofitel Hotel as long as I go to Sanya. This time, **** is really annoying!

msg:The hotel is very modern, with rich children's activities. The children have fun all day long. They are so happy that they don't want to leave. They simply extend the hotel for two more nights. There is a large basket of sand digging tools to choose from when playing at the beach. The swimming pool is convenient, the water park is also suitable for children, and the hand-cranked boat is also cute.
Service: Good 💯
Facilities: Good 💯
Environment: Good 💯
Thank you Nikki for your warm service, attentiveness, and look forward to coming back next time.

msg:This time, I chose the Leeman Sofitel Resort Hotel, which is more cost-effective. The hotel is very big, with many swimming pools, lawns, and its own beach. The environment is comfortable and pleasant! 
The 68 Food City is not far away, and it is very convenient to take a taxi. They are all local Hainan food. 
There is a free bus to the duty-free city, just go to the front desk to make an appoin**ent. It is not far to take a taxi to Wuzhizhou Island. 
The breakfast is very rich, tastes good, and there are many varieties. The end time is 11 o'clock, which is very enjoyable for vacation. 
There are many swimming pools, and each swimming pool is very photogenic. The coconut forest wooden boardwalk leading to the beach in the hotel is very beautiful. It is recommended to check in. 
In terms of service, Angela from the guest relations depar**ent has a caring reply throughout the whole process. If you have any questions, feel free to ask~ 
Come to Sofitel for vacation next time~

msg:The first time I went to Haitang Bay, I didn't know where to go. I asked my friend to recommend Sanya Leeman Sofitel. After listening to my friend's advice, I decided on the hotel and was not disappointed. The hotel check-in experience was particularly good. First of all, the front desk was very comfortable and there were seats for check-in. Compared with Yalong Bay, it was much more humane. When checking in, the housekeeper Xiaoyu also introduced the hotel's floor plan and some activities in detail. Besides, there are many places to play in the hotel, whether it is couples or parents and children, and the hotel's meal prices are also very affordable. The buffet dinner in the evening is free of charge if you bring a baby under 120cm. I think the fried chicken in the buffet dinner is delicious, and the curry chicken in it is better than that in the Thai restaurant. Xiaoyu, the housekeeper, is concerned about whether there is any help every day, which is very considerate. Xiaoyu also gave a surprise gift before checking out. It was a very happy trip.

msg:The room design is reasonable and the bedding is comfortable. The hotel's swimming pools are really great, so many and fun. I played in all the pools in a day and a half, and I still wanted more. The facilities are also complete, with hot towels, free swimming rings and hand-cranked boats. The bubble show is a bit perfunctory, with a small time period and scope, but it's better than nothing. The parent-child activities only involved go-karts and handmade desserts at the Le Bingfang at my own expense, which the children liked very much. Whether it is a full-time restaurant or an executive lounge, desserts are a must, without any ambiguity. Although the breakfast in the executive lounge is not very varied, it is exquisite, and there are Benedict poached eggs and other dishes that can be ordered separately. The combination of afternoon tea and cocktail party is a good dinner, which is much better than takeout. The travel photography process is standardized, but the exquisite hotel landscaping is still easy to produce. Finally, I would like to praise Anna, the guest relations, for communicating the check-in requirements in advance and paying attention to customer experience during the vacation. Good reviews.

msg:I have stayed at Sofitel several times and had a good impression, so I will continue to choose it this time. The hotel has a French a**osphere, the room is well maintained, and it is almost the same as the original new and old. I still like the design of the room. The big bathroom, dry and wet separation, the carpet and decoration in the room are very marine elements, and the mood is pleasant. The garden-style hotel, the perfectly maintained lawn, the great swimming pool, and the proximity to the beach are all very attractive points. And this time it feels that it has been improved. There is a shuttle bus to the beach, the beach is equipped with beach chairs for rest, and the swimming pool has added many children's water castles for children. There are also super rich recreational activities, which are very popular with children. The only few suggestions that need to be mentioned: 1⃣️ Arrived at the hotel a little later in the morning, the front desk staff was indifferent, the concierge staff kept their heads down to do their own things, and did not take the initiative to help with the luggage. The whole process was self-service, which was different from the usual level of five-star hotels. 2⃣️ I have stayed in several times. Other hotels can basically upgrade for free. Sofitel is very stylish, absolutely not. The rest is generally very good. The butler Venus is also good and can provide timely help, which is icing on the cake.

msg:The five-star praise is for Xiao Liu from Sofitel Murca. He called me in advance to reserve the room with the best view. He also asked about the needs and sent reminder messages. He was nice and thoughtful. The hotel has some advantages and disadvantages. The spacious lobby, spacious room types and balconies, the hotel has a wide area facing the coastline, and I like the large swimming pool, the large garden and the beach. The biggest flaw is the "Platinum Travel Photography" in the store, which really ruins the mood. The routine is deep, the attitude of selecting photos is poor, the aesthetics of photoshop is poor, and the original photos are not shown. The routine is to buy thousands of packages. The total shooting takes half an hour, and the finished product is rough. You want to get thousands of yuan. The appearance is not good. The Chinese restaurant and the Thai restaurant taste good. The price is not affordable, but it is better than the food stalls outside. The breakfast restaurant is a little noisy and messy. A performance was arranged on the evening of May 1st to create an a**osphere. There were similar performances in other hotels I stayed in before. I still like the overall hardware, but the details need to be improved.

The hotel is much smaller and the bathroom only has a single basin. The gold building we were moved to is far from the lobby. We stayed with friends from Mangrove for two days and then moved to Sofitel. The children felt that the difference was too big and wanted to check out. The room was not cleaned proactively. After several urgings, they only came to add two towels at 4 pm. I don't plan to stay in Sofitel Sanya next time. The service is very different from other Sofitels in the country.

The suite is very large and comfortable, but the toiletries are all in large bottles, and they are also OEM domestic products, which makes it less fun to get bargains. The hotel swimming pool is very large, and people who like swimming will not be disappointed. The breakfast is also good, the croissants and Hainan noodles are delicious. There are many people during the May Day holiday, but it is also relatively orderly. As for the executive lounge, there are not many things. It is okay to have some snacks in the afternoon to fill the hunger, but there is no special desire to go there.

I wanted to give it one star when I checked in, but the front desk who checked us in was really malicious. They said they upgraded us to a sea view room, room 619 in the gold building, but it turned out to be a corner room with poor ventilation and a disgusting musty smell. They knew I was with my child, but they still arranged for us to stay in a moldy room. It is easy to get sick if you breathe moldy air. Later, Nikki helped to change the room without odor. The hotel pool is first-class, but the details are indeed a bit worse than those of hotels of the same price.

msg:The luxury sea view room costs more than RMB 3,000 for 3 days, not to mention the balcony view. The unfinished building stands in the middle, hundreds of meters away from the sea, which makes the building taller. See pictures yourself
Arrive at the lobby at 13:30. When I checked in, I was told that cleaning would be done later. I thought I would just wait and order food first and eat after checking in. Even though the coffee table is full of scraps from other people's food, I'm not allowed to feed it to my children because I'm not thick-skinned enough? ?
When the meal order arrived at 14:00, the child said he was hungry and wanted to open some food to feed the child, but was told that eating was not allowed in the lobby seating area.
At 14:30, the child kept complaining that he was hungry, so he contacted the staff. The reply was: Sorry, dining is not allowed in the lobby. I asked if there is no place in the lobby where the children can eat first? Still replied: Sorry, dining is not allowed in the lobby. This is service. Is it the city management or the waiter?
Let’s talk about other things. There are 9 free items in the package. In fact, they are all public facilities of the hotel. I grabbed two of the hand-operated boats when I saw them empty. We stayed for three days and didn’t get any.
I took a taxi directly to go out to eat, and finally called me at 14:58 to check in. Sure enough, I checked in at 3 o'clock, which is even one minute early.
In the comments, I didn't see any of the enthusiastic housekeepers, check-in greeting cards, check-in fruits, and towels rolled into flowers. I had made a note a long time ago that the family had children. When I checked in, there was nothing. I asked if there were no children's supplies. In turn, I asked "What do you want?" Damn it, toothbrush and toothpaste, bathrobe, slippers, this is a waste. Do I have to ask for them one by one?
It's not even 200 yuan cheaper and the service is far inferior to Hilton and Tianyu. You basically have no service and you have to fight for it yourself.
In addition, the breakfast is quite average, and there is a queue at the door. Thanks, blocked.

It has a large green lawn and its own beach. If you travel with children, I recommend staying here. It feels more cost-effective than Tianyu and MGM, and you can get everything you want without going out. The room is large and quiet. Standing on the balcony, you can see the Wuzhizhou Island. The hotel's beach is very clear and the service is good. You can order takeout or dine in the hotel. The service is super good.

Special thanks to Jack for his coordination and a free room upgrade for us in the next two days. , the hotel activities are still colorful and have changed from before.

msg:There are many hotel activities during the Spring Festival this year, including fire dancing, acrobatics, dancing, performances, etc. The sea view family room I booked is on the 7th floor right next to the lobby. You can see the sea, the swimming pool and the show from the balcony. Although my friend's luxury sea view room was assigned to look at the sea from the side, the sea view is also very vast. The entire park has been disinfected, and even though the floors are not high, no mosquitoes were felt. There were too many people in the scenic area during the Spring Festival, and my friend had gastroenteritis, so I just lay down in the hotel. It is also very comfortable to watch the scenery and performances on the balcony deck chair every day. During our stay, Emily from the guest relations depar**ent gave us considerate care and help. The cleaning lady also provided some help when the children were uncomfortable. We also greeted the staff cordially when we met on the way. This year’s experience has been improved by several levels compared to last year. There is also the Bojue Travel Photography, which I have always underestimated. Many hotels used to give it to me, but I thought it was unreliable and did not take any pictures. This time we lay down in the hotel and gave it a try anyway. We didn’t even bother to put on makeup or change clothes. We just went downstairs to take a walk. After dozens of minutes of shooting, I can choose the film after two hours of waiting. Such a high-efficiency assembly line does not compromise the shooting effect. My babies are all very cute. You can rest assured to give it a try.

There are children's entertainment projects and a water park, and there are thoughtful performances by the hotel in the evening. We booked a sea view room. The two rooms were a bit far apart at first. After making the request, I was very grateful to the hotel housekeeper Emily, who helped us arrange two adjacent rooms the next day. The service is very attentive. Compared with my previous trip to Yalong Bay, the hotel in Haitang Bay is more luxurious and comfortable. The beach is inside the hotel. There is a shuttle bus and it is a ten-minute walk. It is recommended for families with families, especially the elderly and children.

When I walked out of the basement, I met a staff member who looked dark and had nothing to do. When I walked out, The security booth is back to the original route. I asked if there was a microwave, but I didn't warm up a bun for my child. When I made the reservation, I couldn't get through the call to pick up the airport. If my friend hadn't booked here, I wouldn't have wanted to come here. The one next door was better than them. Okay, I contacted the customer service staff at the backend and no one responded. What’s the name of the breakfast? Don’t order it, including dinner. For hundreds of rooms, there is only one person on duty at the front desk at night. The Internet speed is no different. You have to log in to your mobile phone number to receive text messages. If the computer is down, you cannot connect at all. You must register to log in to the computer. If you do not register, there will be no network. I was told to adjust it. . Finally, use hotspots. Originally, my wife said she wanted to exchange it for another one, but her friends ordered it for several days and then they didn’t exchange it. There is really no service at all. And if it’s a family trip, you still can’t go into the sea at Yalong Bay. The picture shows the delivery boy hiding and not even allowed to come to the reception area.

The only thing is that the toothpaste in the toothbrush set is a bit short. It is not environmentally friendly to have to open a new set every time. Haha, but the toothbrush is quite good. It's useful, because the hotel provides a fence with a baby, but it only has two sides, so sleeping is still scary.

Facilities: At first I saw the water facilities recommended online and they were very fun, but it was a pity that I didn’t know until I arrived that adults were not allowed to play. . . Fortunately, we later made up for it by going to Water World. There are quite a lot of activities for Little Prince in the hotel, but the go-karts are for ages 3 and above. The evening performances are also very exciting. Children in the children's heated swimming pool love it.

Service: First of all, our sea view room was arranged at the far end of the corner of 883. The advantage is that it is quiet and has wind to dry clothes. The disadvantage is that it is far away and you can enjoy the scenery.
I almost didn't want to, so I went to the front desk at night to consult and adjust to a front view of the sea. I changed it the next day. The service was still good. If you want a front view, I recommend room types 86 and Anna. The housekeeper is also very attentive and attentive. I will return it next time. find her

Environment: The environment is quite good, with a large green area. Just walk a little further to the beach. The beach is a bit dirty compared to Atlantis, and the sand is not particularly fine.

There is a dedicated staff who will bring it to you. It is ice cold and delicious! Moreover, the activities are much richer than before. The children make reservations for all activities every day and attend them regularly. Every brother and sister in charge of the activities is great, leading the children, being patient and careful.
      😀And for this check-in, the housekeeper Emily will add WeChat in advance to ask how many children there are, and how many sets of children's toiletries are needed. If you come to her for anything, she will solve it quickly. Thank you again for Emily's help during the past few days of your stay. She arranged the room cleaning in advance.
      😃I have to say that the Sofitel's swimming pool is very large. The children had a great time swimming and there were many children's play facilities. However, one of the hand-cranked boats was broken and there was no queue. However, the little prince’s books were all stamped and he received a souvenir from the little prince, which made him very happy.
      😃Praise Sofitel again for its rich breakfast and dinner! I eat a lot these days and I’m going to gain weight! In the children's buffet area, it can be seen that a lot of care has been taken. Meals are prepared separately for children, so that picky eaters can also be liberated! Fresh bread and desserts are served every day to satisfy greedy mommies☺️☺️
The only unhappy thing is Dong Jingjing in the lobby bar. She didn’t smile the whole time, frowned, and the service was impatient. She answered the phone during the service. I waited for her to answer the phone before signing the order... It’s not that I don’t pay, and it’s not that I don’t have an attitude towards you. Too bad, I never want to spend money there again.

msg:I took my kids to Sanya before the Spring Festival holiday, and this time I stayed at Sofitel Sanya Leeman Hotel. This hotel was recommended by a friend and said it was very suitable for families with children. After staying for 3 days and 2 nights, it was indeed the case.

Let’s talk about the facilities first: there are many swimming pools suitable for children to splash and play, 3 are close to the hotel lobby, and 2 are close to the beach. The afternoon tea desserts in the lobby bar are very delicious😊Enjoy afternoon tea and watch performances in the lobby bar. The hotel's breakfast is very rich, including your favorite pancakes, various fruits, etc.

Let's talk about the room: I stayed in a garden-view king-size bed room, which is very spacious and has a desk for reading and writing, which is convenient for my children to do homework and for me to study. The bathroom is also large, with a bathtub that can be used for bathing. Children like it😊 There is also a large sink, so two people can wash up at the same time, which is very convenient.

Service: The shuttle battery car is very convenient from the lobby to the beach, and the driver is very enthusiastic. Before I even checked into the hotel, Angel, who was in charge of guest relations, contacted me and shared with me the hotel’s parent-child activities in advance. Not only that, she also told me breakfast and places to eat and entertain near the hotel in advance. It was really thoughtful👍, because her introduction made me happy I saved a lot of things. After we checked out and left the hotel, they even took the initiative to visit us to get our opinions. Such thoughtfulness was touching and impressive, and there were many positive reviews!

Very bad experience
I spent 6,500 and stayed for three nights. It was a nigh**are.
Stayed in the family room of Jinlou
The golden building has a full sense of age and the sound insulation effect is equal to 0
The sounds of people moving upstairs and people talking at the door are all in your ears. You can't even take a nap during the day. My wife is so terrible. I will never come again in this life.
The sea view is also very far away. The balcony is very small. Anyway, it's useless.

Guest Experience Officer Murca Xiao Liu contacted us in advance and sent us the event itinerary, and was enthusiastic and attentive. It is commendable that the hotel's children's pool is heated, has a rainbow slide and a loudspeaker, so you are not afraid of the cold in winter. The hotel catering is also quite good. Stay here again if you have the chance.

msg:It was a very satisfying trip. I booked two rooms. The housekeeper contacted me the day before check-in to ask if I needed one. I asked not to stay in the first and last rooms. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30 and was told that there were no rooms and I had to wait. They would be cleaned at 2.40. One room was the room at the end. Because there was only one room, the two children didn't sleep all day long. They continued to wait until 4 o'clock before the other room was cleaned. By the time they packed their luggage, it was already past 5 o'clock. . I would like to ask about the request to check out at 12 o'clock. Why is it not cleaned until 4 o'clock? I am very annoyed when there are so many people and I have to wait all the time. But the housekeeper is still very considerate.

Ruby, the manager of the restaurant, apologized immediately by sending fruit and desserts. On the second day, he replenished half a lobster. The service was very considerate. . The room environment is also very good. I like the round table, which is suitable for children to study and work on the computer. Emily got in touch before checking in and asked about various needs. The service was considerate and in place. I will choose to stay here next time in Sanya.

msg:I read a lot of negative reviews before coming here, and I was really worried. I was afraid that my vacation mood would be ruined, but I already made a reservation and couldn't cancel it, so I came here with the mentality of taking a gamble. First of all, let’s talk about the luggage. Someone will help you pick it up as soon as you get off the car. After checking in, it will be delivered to the room. The first impression is good. The processing speed at the front desk was not that slow. Because the 8-day stay was long, the front desk took the initiative to reserve a room type with a relatively positive sea view in the Jade Building (half of the so-called luxury sea view rooms have a 30-degree sea view, room types 35-40 in the Jade Building Only in this way can you look directly at the sea), and also proactively reminded you that if you run out of drinks in the mini bar, you can contact us for a second gift (although we didn't use it). I feel that these details have been taken into consideration, and there is nothing to complain about. The room hygiene is also very good, the sewers are smooth, and the sheets are changed every two days (more diligently than many hotels change every three days). Children's bathrobes and slippers must be actively requested. Don't refuse to give them. We didn't know that there were children's slippers. We didn't wait until the children came to see them. I regret not wearing children's slippers when other children wear them. This is not grand enough. The wifi is really not good, so I can only use my own most of the time. The quality of breakfast is okay, especially the bread. There are many varieties and good taste, but there is really nothing to eat except bread. There are a lot of swimming pools, but there is only one small round pool that is heated, and the children are squeezed into it and cannot swim. The other large pools are all at room temperature and are useless. The beach is indeed not as close as the hotel in Yalong Bay, but it is not very far away. It takes about five or six minutes to walk. The shuttle bus occasionally passes by, and it only takes 2 minutes to get there. The service provided by the housekeeper Anna is pretty good. She will come to greet you once every two days and she can handle your needs in a timely manner. This kind of one-on-one service is not available in many hotels. Overall, my stay this time was pretty good (Pictures 1, 3, and 4 are all views from the balcony). Bojue Travel Photography did a pretty good job, but the final selection of films will definitely exceed your mental budget, so be prepared for this haha

We booked a luxurious sea view room. The hotel has an indoor playground and N outdoor heated swimming pools, a small train, travel photography, and lighting. Ceremonies, bubble parties, acrobatic magic and fire dance performances, the hotel’s activities are one after another, and it’s impossible to schedule them all😀. New Year's Eve happens to be my birthday, and the hotel thoughtfully sent me a cake and a greeting card. I watched the Spring Festival Gala and my son stayed with me to watch the New Year. I hope that all my wishes in the new year will come true and everyone will be better and better.

msg:Eight years ago, when I just entered the workplace, I enjoyed a fantastic four-day annual meeting at the Sofitel Hotel. Time has passed and now I am married with a one and a half year old child and we have chosen this hotel as our first choice for vacations. In the past eight years, the hotel's facilities have still been maintained quite well, especially the hotel's current focus on parent-child aspects, such as the indoor amusement park, children's pool and wide lawn, which greatly attracted my little baby and made her have a lot of fun here. , it is also a good place to take photos. The only small regret is that the wind and waves at the beach are occasionally strong, which limits our time on the beach. The one-to-one butler service provided by the hotel, as well as the significant improvements in the surrounding environment compared to eight years ago, including the convenience of ordering takeaways and the food court 2 kilometers away, all made our experience richer. Considering the comprehensive consideration from service to price, this hotel should be the most cost-effective family holiday choice in Haitang Bay.

msg:Poolside rooms are very convenient for taking the elderly on vacation. The weather in Sanya in mid-January is about 21-27 degrees. Young people can go into the water at noon without feeling very cold, and they will not shiver or get goosebumps when they get out of the water. The wind would pick up in the afternoon, but it was not cold during swimming. My right shoulder felt a little sore from the wind after two hours of swimming. It would be better if the weather was hot. This season, I seem to be the only one swimming in the entire pool of ten or so rooms. The a**osphere of the French-style hotel is good, with pleasant music playing in every corner of the hotel, lively performances in the evening, and singers singing English songs in the lobby bar in the afternoon. Desserts are very good. The 28 yuan cake in the lobby bar is the same as the buffet in the evening. The group purchase of eight cocktails is very cost-effective, priced at 38 yuan per cup. The Thai food in the hotel tastes good. The mandarin duck hot pot Thai coconut chicken soup (milky white tonka soup, not clear chicken soup) and the tom yum goong soup are quite good. Seafood and mushrooms are cooked, and the tom yum goong soup is not very spicy. Guest Experience Officer Dora Xiaoyu took the initiative to contact us before check-in. After adding WeChat, the service was warm and courteous. Nice stay experience.

If you don't have high food requirements, breakfast + afternoon tea + happy hour can basically meet your food needs for the day. The landscape of the park is quite impressive, and it is a bit far from the beach (within a ten-minute walk), but it doesn't feel too far to take photos along the road. Angela Xiaohui from the Guest Relations Depar**ent is proactive in her service and responds to all requests. Like it manually 👍 The room is relatively spacious. It is a pity that it does not have a Dyson hair dryer or a smart toilet. I have tried Chinese food, Thai food, and the buffet. The food is relatively average and the service is good.

She is attentive and thoughtful. She made us feel at home. We will definitely come back often in the future!

msg:This time I stayed on the 8th floor of the Pearl Tower. It was very convenient to reach the lobby, restaurants and the beach! There is no smart toilet or smart TV, which is a bit unfamiliar. The balcony of the room can directly see the sea with almost no obstruction. Every morning when I open the curtains, I feel very happy.
Before check-in, the housekeeper will contact me via WeChat. The person who contacted me was Angela. I first asked about any special needs for the room. If you have any questions during your stay, you can contact the housekeeper. The staff in the hotel, including the cleaning staff, will greet you warmly. Breakfast time is from 7 to 11 o'clock, and you usually have to queue up around 10 o'clock.
The waves on the beach are relatively large, so it is only suitable for treading on the water and taking photos. The scenery is still very good. It mainly depends on the weather. It was cloudy and cold on the first day of our stay, but the weather was sunny and sunny in the next two days, which was very beautiful!
I tried the free Earl Travel Photography, which provided free simple makeup, and you can also wear their special clothes for free. I only wore my own clothes to take photos, and took more than 100 photos. To be honest, the photos were average, so I chose the free 5 photos. open.

msg:The room was average. I booked it for 2 nights on a non-weekend and was not upgraded;
The toiletries are hard to describe, they are all made of wood, the comb is easy to break, and the toothpaste is packaged in a paper bag. It cannot be sealed and stored after being torn open. It can be used open until the next day... The key is that the stock is not replenished the next day. I called and asked for 2 sets for adults. 1 set for children, but a bunch of them were delivered (see picture), what does that mean...bath towels and towels were not replenished the next day...
The surrounding environment is quite high-end.
The children's stamp collecting activity is a bit too rigid. If you have 8 stamps, you will be given a mini ice cream (the waiter will count to 8 carefully before giving it to you). If you collect all the stamps, you will be given a surprise gift. Charges are included. Two of them are in It can only be completed in the water. It was too cold, so I gave up in the end, thinking that the hotel would give me a consolation prize in the end. It would be anything, but it didn’t happen. The children were very disappointed.
The breakfast and dinner buffets are nothing special and taste average.
This hotel just sucks. "Frugality" is a virtue, but every small detail can reflect the service level of a hotel.

The sea is far away and the bath products are not easy to use. The bed is 1.2 and toiletries are not provided. Ask for them in advance if needed. I asked about 380 RMB for an extra bed. The room cannot be upgraded for free, and the service is like a machine. I stayed for two days, but I couldn't even ask for fruit for two days. The welcome fruit didn't come until the next day. I didn't feel warm and comfortable during my stay. The area around the big lawn is okay, the children's paddling pool is relatively small, and the facilities and equipment are a bit outdated.

Before I checked in, I added the butler Murca Xiao Liu's WeChat account. I sent her hotel information before I checked in. On the day of check-in, I added tips and activity information. I would proactively ask if there is anything I need from the guest room every day. The amazing thing is that I am going to take a train.

The other service staff in the hotel were also very nice and considerate, and I didn’t feel any discomfort during the whole process.
There is a constant temperature swimming pool in the children's swimming pool. Although the weather is not very good, you can still take your baby into the water. My baby is only more than nine months old and he swam with me for more than half an hour.
The beach is 5-10 minutes walk, very close. This distance is good.
Average food…

msg:I don't know if the previous good reviews were correct, but our stay experience was very poor. 1. The floor in the children's amu*****t park is old and dirty, and the walls are moldy. Children will definitely inhale the mold when playing there; 2. There is no air conditioning in the lobby (the hotel says this is how it was designed), and there is no air conditioning in the public areas on the floors. There is a stuffy smell; 3. The air conditioner in the room needs to be adjusted to 16 degrees before it can barely drop to 23 degrees. The air conditioner said that the air conditioner is a central air conditioner, and the cold air has to take a long way to enter the room. The question is if it is a shared pipe, is it one Children in the room are infected with the virus, and children in other rooms will be at risk; 4. My daughter and son were bitten by bugs, and the hotel manager on duty not only did not offer to change rooms for the safety of the children, but also did not even offer to change the bedding for the children, saying that the hotel did not Star rating, but I searched for five-star/diamond hotels on Ctrip and chose this hotel. Manager Fu said that I have to ask how Ctrip rated it.
I contacted Ctrip to complain. Ctrip was very proactive and the customer service staff helped communicate with the hotel. Finally, the hotel contacted us 16 hours after my daughter was bitten. Our request was not for compensation, but for the hotel to have the most basic hygiene and service standards. , I don’t want other children to be bitten or inhaled mold, or get heat colds because of poor air conditioning, or to infect all children because of influenza A from other children.
This Sofitel experience was very poor, both in terms of service and hygiene, and the hotel will not accept compensation in the future. Parents who want to stay here, please be careful.
Attached is a photo of my daughter who was bitten by an insect (she has been seen by the deputy chief physician of the People's Hospital, and there is an inspection report. Don't blame the hotel. Please make rectifications and improve the hygiene standards and store manager service levels)

The hotel is equipped with a butler. Our butler Dora Xiaoyu is enthusiastic and attentive. She prepared baby supplies for us on the day we checked in. She asked us if we needed supplies as soon as possible every morning. If we had any questions, she was quick to help us. Thank you very much. I hope we can meet each other next time. The hotel has three swimming pools, an infinity pool near the beach (not open yet), a main swimming pool and a children's swimming pool (constant temperature). It only takes five minutes to walk to the beach. There is a takeout counter. It only takes three minutes to walk from the lobby of the hotel. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay.

We are a family of three. The baby is three and a half years old. The room faces the sea, with a view of the swimming pool and lake below. It is very beautiful. The twin beds are put together, and a bed fence is thoughtfully added. There is a heated swimming pool for adults, a little prince check-in activity, and baby play. Don't want to leave. The private beach is even more beautiful. Although you can't swim in the sea, you can ride the waves and dig in the sand on the seaside, which is very pleasant.
In addition, the experience officer Murca Xiao Liu introduced the hotel very thoughtfully. If you have any questions, you can contact him. He is very handsome. The beautiful lady can come to him and add chicken legs to him! The attentive service is almost 24 hours a day. They often ask us what else we need and recommend all kinds of delicious and fun things. It’s great!

Environment: The hotel is beautiful and has a holiday a**osphere. There are many large and small swimming pools, and the children's pool next to the main pool is always the busiest (there will be a bubble party at 17:15 every day if it doesn't rain, and the children will be crazy about it). There are slides, swings, and a small horn. The small speaker is definitely a plus, it’s enough for a six-year-old to play with, and it’s great to wait for the facilities to open after breakfast (the swimming pool is open from 10:00-22:00)! The main swimming pool has many water sports (kayaking 100 yuan/30 minutes, water gun 88 yuan/30 minutes). I rented the water gun four times in total. It really hurts my heart, so I might as well buy one and bring it with me. Crossing the big lawn in front of the beach pool and the sea, it's really beautiful. The hotel is very attentive to the maintenance and trimming of the gardens. The lawns, greening and flowers are all just right and beautiful. There are only a few people in the beach pool, mostly adults, so it is very quiet and relaxing. Linhai Plank Road is very photogenic on a sunny day. It is recommended that adults and children bring a few sets of swimsuits, as they will not be enough to change after playing all day. Find a beach chair early enough to stay there all day without getting bored. The light meals at the pool bar taste good, but it takes a long time to eat.


Facilities: Although it is an 18-year-old hotel, the facilities are still well maintained. The lobby is very grand, the room equipment is also okay, and it doesn't look old. After all, the hotels in Yalong Bay are all old now, and the ones for families in Haitang Bay are either old or expensive. None of the shower facilities near the pool were damaged or inoperable, and the details were pretty good. And it’s very convenient to have one just a few steps away!


Service: Before check-in, the customer service will send you the children's play arrangements and hotel introduction in advance via WeChat. The staff I met at the hotel were really not as enthusiastic as Thai ones, but they were responsive to requests. If you need anything, send customer service a WeChat message and it will be delivered very quickly. I enrolled my child in one-day camp care, and the two young ladies were very kind and gentle. The Thai restaurant tastes good, but is a bit expensive. In addition, other children's entertainment items are also slightly expensive, but they are acceptable if children like them. There is a shuttle bus every 15 minutes from the beach pool to the lobby. If you don't want to walk, you can wait.


Hygiene: Overall it is very clean and the room cleaning is also good, but there are some small water stains on the toilet floor. The greenery beside the swing chairs in the main swimming pool has a sanitary blind spot. Those who are not mysophobic can ignore it.

The hotel is really beautiful, and the coconut trees beside the lawn are very picturesque. It’s a no-brainer for those with kids. The swimming pool is really nice and big. I didn’t get tired of it after four full days.

If I have to mention a few shortcomings, it’s that the hotel’s wifi is too poor! It’s not useful at all, I’m using 5G throughout. Then breakfast is average. In addition, it is very convenient to order takeout now. The merchant directly delivers it by tram, so there are no customers for two nights in a row! Recommend their seafood porridge and shrimp! It is recommended to order takeout as soon as you arrive, put the drinks in the refrigerator and take them to the pool, it is not too fun!

Finally, I wish everyone who reads this review a perfect holiday~

Lying on the balcony and watching the scenery is amazing. The swimming pool in the room is a bit small. The weather was bad and I didn't go into the water. It would be better if the heating temperature could be higher. The breakfast variety is quite rich but there are a lot of people. It is recommended to use the executive lounge to divide the guests of different room types. The menu in the lounge could be improved, but the variety is too limited. The children's playground must be praised, it is very suitable for children to discharge. The housekeeper Xiao Yin provided good service and even gave the children a little fox as a gift when checking out. The child's new clothes were found after they were dropped in the room. However, it is recommended that hotels proactively contact guests if they find lost items. Will consider staying here next time.

The service staff didn't know whether they had poor service awareness or were new here. They couldn't explain clearly when asking for directions, which also surprised me.
Children’s activities: The little prince’s passport is quite nice, and the activities are quite crotch-lifting. It feels like I'm just making up the numbers. The content is not interesting at all, and the flow and quality of the activities are even worse. It’s a little better to experience go-karts. Many have extra charges.
Breakfast: According to family members, it is not good. The variety and taste are not very satisfactory. I didn't get up to eat, so I can't comment.
Swimming pool: There is no heated swimming pool, and the hotel swimming pool has not been heated during this season, so it is quite cold.
Hotel hygiene: not ideal.

msg:From the room to the hotel environment, I was quite satisfied. There is a shuttle bus to the beach, and it's not too far to walk. Children also like the children's water park. They have played with the big speakers dozens of times and the staff are also very patient. Let me talk about two dissatisfaction points. One day when we were rushing to take pictures for breakfast, the child had a croissant that he didn't finish. Grandma wrapped it up for him and said he would eat it later. A cleaning service staff passed by our table and asked He told us that this cannot be taken out. Grandma even showed it to him and said that the child had already eaten it. The service staff still said that food from the restaurant cannot be taken out. If we don’t eat more and take more, who wants to take an extra piece of bread from you? Still half-eaten? Isn’t your hotel the most environmentally friendly? Shouldn't we cherish food? We put it down immediately. When I left the restaurant and entered the elevator, I saw a young man with two bananas in his left hand and a big mango in his right hand. It's like I can't stand the bread that the children haven't finished eating. The second point is that the hotel's takeout counter is set up very far away. After staying in so many hotels in Sanya, your home is the farthest anyway. In such a hot weather, you go out to get something and you are sweating. Is this for the sake of the guests? The hotel didn’t have a bathtub cover, so we needed takeout. The baby was so hot that we had prickly heat and we needed to buy medicine. We also wanted to buy something refreshing and refreshing. Why do you have to torment your guests like this?

msg:Half of this 1-point evaluation is given to the hotel and half to Ctrip. I arrived at the hotel at nine o'clock in the evening. After checking in, I found that the indoor temperature could not be lowered. I contacted the hotel service, but nothing was resolved. I complained to Ctrip and got a room change. Recently, I found that whenever I book a room on Ctrip, the service I receive is terrible. Including Chengdu Renhe Spring, Xuzhou Kaiyuan Mingdu, Xuzhou Hyatt, Hainan Sofitel... These hotels are all five bricks or above, with a score of 4.8, but they all encountered problems such as damaged guest room equipment and poor room types. The problems that have occurred one after another give me reason to believe that rooms booked through the Ctrip platform are usually inferior. Ctrip usually offers cash compensation as a solution. Ctrip may define me as an anti-counterfeiting specialist. I used this request to cancel all subsequent hotels or trips I booked on Ctrip. The customer service repeatedly explained that this was an accidental phenomenon and promised that I would be prepared in advance for subsequent hotel bookings to prevent similar situations from happening again. Unfortunately, when I checked into the Corning Hotel today, I still encountered poor service: 1. There were no disposable slippers in the room. 2. After we arrived in the room, we were told that there was a barbecue package that needed to be picked up at the front desk, and they refused to deliver it to the room. .

When I yelled in the living room, my husband in the room actually responded... My parents lived happily. There is a swimming pool for the baby to play in the water when he doesn't want to go downstairs. The adults took night swimming twice and it was still convenient. On the top 12th floor, the view is very good, but it is windy. Pearl Tower is very convenient.
I went to the executive lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktails in a few days. It was not a rich meal, but it was enough. However, there are a little too many desserts. If there are elders in the family who have three heights, or friends who are losing weight but don’t want to eat grass, the executive lounge may be a bit tasteless and they can only eat salad.
Special praise for the butler service. Sofitel said that they are not butler service, they call it the guest relations depar**ent. However, the essence is similar to that of a housekeeper. With the addition of Angela, any requests will be notified in advance. Things in the room will be put away when waiting for check-in. It is a much better experience than calling for things one by one. Some consultations will also be provided for reference. However, my husband complained a little about their service hotline at night. It was around 10 o'clock and he was worried that the housekeeper was asleep, so he called the front desk service number directly. He called several times and no one answered.

msg:The hotel style is very French and elegant, and the chandeliers in the lobby are very memorable. Because I brought my mother to stay, I didn’t experience the parent-child activities. But on the way to the swimming pool, I saw a lot of children participating in the projects. If you have children, it should be a good choice for outdoor swimming pools. It is a constant temperature, which is very good. Warm towels will be replenished in time next to the swimming pool. Although it is a bit far from the sea, the hotel has a short parking lot along the road and you can see the scenery of the entire hotel. I feel that Sofitel is more suitable for people who want to take a vacation but do not want to be disturbed. The housekeeper Angela will promptly inform you of daily activity times and will proactively ask if you check out early, which is very considerate.

msg:During this National Day trip, I stayed at Howard Johnson, Yalong Bay Hilton and Sofitel. The most satisfying one was the Sofitel! 1. The venue and time arranged for parent-child activities are very reasonable. Naughty Castle closes at 22:00, Hilton closes at 20:00, and Guoguang Howard Johnson is even more outrageous, charging 68/person. 2. The service attitude is good. The whole a**osphere at Hilton is indifferent, but Sofitel is obviously much more welcoming. 3. The swimming pool is open very late. Most of the Hilton's swimming pools close at 20:00, and only one swimming pool is open. 4. Breakfast time is reasonable. Breakfast ends at 11:00 for Sofitel and 10:30 for Hilton and Johnson. 5. Both Howard Johnson and Sofitel have housekeepers who contacted me one day in advance and asked if I need to delay check-out. Thanks to Niky, the housekeeper, for giving me the children’s activity schedule on WeChat. In general, Hilton and Sofitel are about the same price, but Sofitel is not half as good.

I must give it a thumbs up. My wife had a birthday on the day she checked in. Not only did the decorations have a birthday theme, There was also a big cake on site. They patiently helped us solve a lot of trivial matters during the process. Thank you very much. They also extended our check-out time on the day of the trip. Although the hotel has been renovated for some time, it is not outdated at all. It is full of French style. The whole family likes it very much. We look forward to our next visit~ This trip ended perfectly under Emily's proper arrangements.

Thank you Nikki for your thoughtful greetings. After adding WeChat, I will send greetings and introduce hotel information every day, which is good.

The hotel has a lot of activities for children, including various check-in activities, and they had a lot of fun [smiley face]

msg:I stayed at the Sofitel in advance with my children. I was so disappointed this time. After the epidemic, the service became worse and worse. The front desk had a rigid attitude. I don’t know what the marketing was thinking. If you stay for one day, you will get a minibar, and if you stay for three days, you will get a free one on the first day. The health aunt knocked on the door at around nine o'clock, or it was because there was no cleaning at four or five o'clock in the afternoon. The take-out counter is more than 100 meters away from the lobby, why not put it on the road? The mineral water in the swimming pool is gone, bath towels are out of stock from time to time, and the live broadcast personnel are constantly broadcasting live broadcasts to the swimming pool and public areas. Have the privacy of the guests been taken into consideration? There was a scary sound in the sewers in the middle of the night, and the hotel was blocked.

The swimming pool was very long, and there were staff dedicated to disinfecting and cleaning. The service in the suite is very good. Nikki, the dedicated receptionist, is enthusiastic, conscientious and can solve any problems. During the National Day, there are many people, so you can solve check-in and other problems in the lounge, which is a good feeling. Although the breakfast in the executive lounge is not as rich as the all-day dining restaurant, it also has an a la carte menu. It is really clean and comfortable when there are so many people and people have to queue up for meals during the National Day. The snacks for afternoon tea are delicious, and the scones are a great choice for me and my family. Never forget it! The greening of the hotel is very good, there are many beautiful flowers, the swimming pool is huge, and the sand on the beach is very fine and comfortable to step on! This trip was a last-minute decision, but the overall experience was very good, a perfect vacation!

msg:There are too many good hotels in Sanya, and everyone is doing well. To be honest, the advantages of this one do not have obvious competitive advantages (five photos were given as a gift), so let’s focus on the shortcomings:
1. The hotel check-in was a little confusing, the passenger flow was not large, and the waiting time was not very short. The housekeeper suggested that we go for a walk, put the luggage where it was, and said that someone would help take the luggage to the room. After observing for a long time, the luggage was still there. No one was there to take care of it, and I couldn't bear to worry about it, so I had to come back and watch over it. When the housekeeper saw it, he asked the concierge to take away the luggage and put it away.
2. The elevators were not well maintained. There were three elevators on one side of the lobby, and two of them broke down in one night. The waiting time for the elevators was too long, and the guests were very dissatisfied. In the end, two families got into a quarrel because of their dissatisfaction.
3. The kitchen management and room service menu management are chaotic. I wanted to order room service breakfast for the next day the night before, but the menu description was confusing, which led to questions. I called the front desk and the front desk couldn’t explain clearly. I called the restaurant and the restaurant said they only wanted to order breakfast. The person in charge of the buffet is not responsible for the room service (I have stayed in so many hotels, this is the first time I heard that the restaurant is not responsible for the room service...). In the end, I couldn't call the housekeeper, and the housekeeper couldn't explain clearly. Finally, I suggested placing an order with a QR code. The problem is You cannot make a reservation using the QR code, you can only order now and eat now. I felt it was unprofessional and unreliable, so I finally chose to order takeout the next day (the takeout counter is huge).
4. The issue of professionalism of housekeepers. The reason why housekeepers are called housekeepers is that they can solve problems for guests staying in the hotel, respond to guests’ messages in a timely manner and be responsive as much as possible. The housekeeper at this hotel does not respond to guest messages in a timely manner. And it cannot be said that it can completely solve the customer's problem, or even answer the customer's questions. Compared with some other hotel housekeepers in Sanya, they basically respond to messages and phone calls in seconds. They will communicate with you in advance about the room cleaning time, and will often proactively ask you if you have any questions or needs. The butler in this hotel is more like a waiter and is still far from the standard of "butler".

We used the custody to go to the duty-free shop, which was a ten-minute drive and was quite convenient. The housekeeper Dora paid attention to the whole process and was always caring. She was so considerate. The lady at the amu*****t park was also very nice and economical. Even after changing hotels, the children still missed it! I also feel very happy that I chose a hotel that my children like to stay in! By the way, the children also have their own baby meals for breakfast, which is really considerate!

Dora contacted us in advance, arranged a room and upgraded her room. She would proactively ask what items were missing every day.
There is a shuttle bus not far from the duty-free shop.
The lobby can directly lead to the seaside, and shuttle buses can also be used to pick up and drop off. It allows guests to enjoy the beautiful view of the sea on the private beach, which is very comfortable!
There is also an infinity pool on the beach, which is great for taking photos. If you encounter a waiter in passing, you will take the initiative to say hello.

The scenery there is super beautiful. Unfortunately, the weather is too hot, so I stayed for ten minutes It's too hot to stay, it's really a pity!
Overall, the hotel is very satisfied this time, the room is clean, the toiletries are from Lanvin, children's products, building blocks, books are needed, and the phone will be delivered to the front desk in a while! Every staff member I came into contact with was very enthusiastic, the service was in place, and the smiles were constant!
Special thanks to Angela, no matter what questions I have, I can reply in time and give suggestions. She is super patient. The child doesn’t want to leave. She also helped us delay the check-out time. After check-out, I also care about whether we have settled down at night. , very heartwarming! Bringing children to Sanya at the end of the summer vacation, good food, good fun, good service, really makes people feel comfortable!

The best thing about Sofitel is to distinguish the children's playthings by age groups. This is really good, and older children will not feel it. It's childish, and even children can't play with it. The hotel environment is really first-rate, and even taking a walk feels very romantic. The housekeeper Angela is very warm and thoughtful, and is ready to respond to all questions. I will choose to stay a few more days next time I go there.

My two-year-old daughter has a lot of fun playing in the children's playground and goes there almost every afternoon. My eldest nephew and son also have a lot of fun. The hotel's meals are rich and of good quality. The only drawback is that the air conditioning in the room is too weak. Not sure if it's a mechanical failure. The flaws do not conceal the advantages. Generally speaking, I will come to Sofitel next time I come to Haitang Bay.

msg:The Sofitel Hotel is located in Haitang Bay. It takes only ten minutes to get off the expressway. The transportation is convenient. It is located in the middle of this area and has a very geographical advantage. The beach is very delicate, and there are free sand-digging toys for children, which are very thoughtful and can be returned by themselves when they are used up.

Room view:
This time I stayed in a superior garden view room. The room faces the swimming pool room. It looks like a garden. The view is great. The room is full of French style. There is a welcome drink when you check in. Sofitel Sour is a special hotel welcome drink that children especially like , Seeing that the child likes to drink so much, the service staff took the initiative to ask if there is a kettle. If so, they can help to make a kettle.

Hotel breakfast:
The breakfast is rich in variety and has a high choice. Open until 11 o'clock, the most important thing is that it is so generous that it is not based on height, but children under 12 are free (if I remember correctly) which is very comfortable for vacation. Most hotels charge half price for those below 1.2 meters and between 1.2 meters and 1.4 meters. Those over 1.4 meters are subject to admission. Most hotels close at 10 o'clock, and some hotels close at 9:30. This time is for vacation arrangements breakfast.

Hotel garden:
The hotel has a total of three large swimming pools. The large lawn and the trails full of coconut trees are very beautiful. The pool towels are in sufficient supply. It is the best check-in point~ A small suggestion, the hotel can add more sun-shading facilities on the swimming pool, it is really sunny during the day.


hotel service:
Nikki from the guest relations depar**ent asked about check-in needs and other information, and the service was very good and basically everything was responsive. Really appreciate Nikki

This time I had a good holiday memory at Sofitel with my family, and I look forward to coming back next year, [happy] [happy]

msg:Super super satisfied. It exceeded expectations. I saw a lot of hotels at the time and thought this one was very cost-effective, so I booked it

When I checked in, the front desk confirmed the room type with me, but I found that I had made a mistake and booked a twin bed room. The front desk immediately changed it to a double bed room for me! The housekeeper, Xiaoxue, helped us take all our luggage to the room immediately after we checked in. Because we have a baby, we need a crib, bed rail, bottle warmer, and baby tub. After talking to Xiaoxue, the housekeeping depar**ent delivered it quickly, which is very convenient!

There are many constant temperature swimming pools in the hotel that will not be crowded. There is also a children's water park and a small big speaker that adults can play with. There is also a children's playground dessert shop where you can make desserts and pottery racing cars. There are many options to stay for a few days. Will not be boring! ￼

The breakfast is also very rich. There are many choices in the morning. The bread and cakes are very good! If it is a little later, there will be more people, and there will be a timetable at the door to remind you to avoid peak hours for dining

The hotel has its own beach. I think it’s a long walk. You can take a battery car at the entrance of the lobby. You don’t have to wait. You can go down quickly and take a ride. It’s not too far to walk. It only takes about 5-6 minutes

What I like the most is their bed. It is really too comfortable. After staying for a few days, I am most reluctant to leave this bed and the swimming pool. The bed is a little soft, but I can’t sleep because my back hurts and it’s huge! Thinner girls can sleep 4 people and boys can sleep 3 people! Because the bed is big and the quilt is bigger, two people don’t need to worry about grabbing the quilt at night. It’s really super comfortable to turn over at will. For this bed, I will stay in this hotel again

msg:After booking a two-night package, the stay was really comfortable, and I stayed for another night~￼I highly recommend the executive room, because it includes afternoon tea and later in the hotel. There are a lot of children’s entertainment in the hotel. It’s very fun to play in the hotel. Bringing children It is very comfortable to eat, drink, play and play every day￼The hotel environment is also good, and the room service is also very good. The welcome is also ready to help us with our suitcases and open the door. Emily, the butler, is very careful. Before checking in, I contacted us to inquire about my needs. My husband's birthday was also delivered by the hotel Cakes and children's products during the children's stay were provided. Yu Qingqing, who cleaned the room, returned the little surprises on the bed prepared for the baby. The children liked it very much. The hotel can order food 24 hours a day, and it can be delivered to the room when you are hungry. The staff in the administrative corridor are very gentle and hospitable to the children and praise Yang Xiaomei for her good service~ The whole journey feels very happy and relaxed~ My husband and I feel that we have spent these few days in the hotel Good day! ! !

Praise the butler Xiaofan Angel, who called me two days before check-in and added contact information, made birthday arrangements for me and waited for me at the front desk on the day of check-in. During the period, I took the initiative to ask if I needed help, and gave me small snacks and fruit plate~
By the way, I would like to recommend the Accor Rewards Card. I booked the hotel on Ctrip, but it does not affect the use of executive lounge coupons, dining coupons, laundry coupons, meeting room coupons, etc. You can really eat and live in the hotel, the all-day dining restaurant has buffet breakfast and dinner, the executive lounge has fruit plate snacks, and the afternoon tea at Fairmont next door is also quite good in the service environment! If you live in Haitang Bay, I highly recommend Accor's hotels. The two stays were very good, and I will stay again next time!

msg:It is a garden-style seaside resort hotel with very good greenery. Whether it is tropical flowers and plants or coconut groves, it is very eye-catching. It can be seen that the hotel is well maintained and meticulous. This is a great highlight of this hotel.

There are several swimming pools. We often go to the coconut grove swimming pool, which is shaded by trees and will not be too sunny. Go to the swimming pool by the sea in the evening, there are few people, you can lie down by the pool and watch the sea view. There are plenty of other recreational and fitness facilities, perfect for families with children. In the morning, I went for a walk outdoors. The birds and insects sang, the scenery was beautiful, the oxygen content was high, and the pace was faster than usual.

I was not very satisfied with the garden view room given at the beginning. The floor-to-ceiling windows on the balcony were not full-size, and there was no view. After a lot of trouble, I finally changed to a side-sea view room with full-size floor-to-ceiling windows. I immediately felt comfortable. . If you care about the lighting in the room like us, you can communicate your requirements clearly with the front desk when you check in. I feel that the attitude of the service staff is very friendly, but the efficiency can be better. If the person on duty has not finished handling the matter, it is best to explain clearly to the colleague who takes over. Changing rooms really tossed us for half a day, and we have to talk to different people The personnel communicated and contacted repeatedly, but fortunately the result was satisfactory.

Although Haitang Bay cannot swim in the sea, the sea water is also jelly-colored, the coastline is very long, and the sand is very fine. As long as I don't swim during the day, I like to lie on the beach, read a book and listen to music. It's very comfortable. I feel that it would be better to equip the beach chairs with a few more umbrellas.

The meals in the lobby bar should be accompanied by pictures. Judging from the shrimp cakes we ordered, they are completely different from the shrimp cakes we expected, and the price/performance ratio is really low. But the Thai restaurant is very good, the taste is very good, it feels very authentic, the family is very satisfied, thanks to Ada and Fiora, very friendly and attentive service.

Overall, it was a very good staying experience, and I would recommend it to my friends, and I would like to come again next time.

The most surprising thing about this trip is its executive lounge. The food is very rich, and all kinds of small drinks are also very attentive.

If you go to eat, you will know that the price includes breakfast and dinner. The price is very high, and the sea view is also beautiful. The hotel can take a shuttle bus to the beach. It is very convenient to be there on call, but the corridors and elevator halls of the hotel are really too hot. Every time I go, it is quite torturous. The hotel's children's program is highly recommended. This time the itinerary is too full to complete. Next time I come back, I will definitely stay a day in the hotel to play with the children's program.

🍃Hotel environment: An excellent resort hotel often needs to do a good job in details, especially in some inconspicuous places. So is Sofitel. Every morning, when the sky is bright, intensive pruning begins, and what passengers get up to see is always the well-groomed exterior.
🔔Service: The service must be praised separately. Let me talk about the hardware first. The room facilities and equipment are novel, the environment is tidy, the cleaning is timely, and the service speed is fast. I like it.

Focus on our butler Nikki, answering all questions, warm-hearted and flexible to improve customer experience;

Catering: The breakfast is rich and varied, and the breakfast bread can give full marks. In addition, I recommend Sofitel's desserts. If you like sweets, you must try them.

My husband is French-Chinese, so I really like the French style of the French group. Although there are a lot of people this time, most of them are families and children, which will be a bit noisy. Fortunately, we like to go to the pool in the sun at noon, so no one is still very quiet😆. The breakfast is still as good as ever, basically satisfying for those who like to eat western food. It's just that the takeaway is a little far away. It's about 100 meters up and down the downhill road at the exit of the car. It's a bit tiring to walk because it's not a flat road after all. What is a little different this time is that there is Nikki, the hotel's guest relationship. During the 8 days in the hotel, this beautiful Nikki served us and solved problems. Added warmth and peace of mind to your vacation life👍

To be improved:
1. The drinks in the executive lounge are single, especially the tea is very perfunctory.
2. The special welcome drink Sofitel Sour is far worse than Sanya Sour. It lacks the optional combination of mint and lime, and the soul is gone.
3. Toiletries, especially toothbrushes are too difficult to use, and the balcony drying rack should be replaced.

Overall, it's still great, with good scenery, good service, and high cost performance.

We lived in a relatively basic room, but we could still see a bit of the sea. At night, there was a The fireworks are all colorful in the sky, very beautiful. It may be that there are fewer people after May Day, so I think the comfort is good. There is a free children's playground, and there are some charged items. The cake I made with the children is quite interesting.

msg:This is a hotel that must be checked twice or even thirdly. Parent-child facilities are complete, and there are many activities. The activities are not repeated after staying for five consecutive days. The two swimming pools are relatively large, one is close to the accommodation area, there are more children and more interesting, the other is closer to the beach, there are few people and quiet but it is also very large. There is also a large karting field inside, which is cool! In terms of food and drink, the all-day dining restaurant, Chinese restaurant, Thai restaurant, and a noodle restaurant are all pretty good. I stayed in a suite and can go to the executive lounge. Unfortunately, it is not on the top floor. The view is average, but you can also have breakfast here. Although there are few dishes , but less people clean is not bad. The lobby bar should be good too, but it's hot now, so I can't sit still. In October, I guess I will be able to drink there until midnight. . .

The room is very comfortable, the bed and pillows are good, because the Marriott just stayed in another place the week before, and it is much more comfortable than the Sofitel.
I have to mention Emily the housekeeper. She can handle a lot of things by calling or looking for her. She is very professional and dedicated, making this trip a real five-star service experience.
The breakfast is very rich, and the seafood buffet dinner is especially recommended. It is fresh and delicious, and it is very cost-effective.
The cleaning service of the room aunt is also very good!
There are many parent-child activities, so you don't have to worry about playing.

Moreover, the hotel has cooperated with Earl Travel Photography. The photographer can really capture the feeling that our mobile phone can't take with the SLR, and also help to retouch the picture, which is great! The hotel helped us to upgrade the room type. You can directly see the sea. The bathroom in the room is very large. It is very suitable for girlfriends to go out and make up in the bathroom together. The breakfast is also quite rich, and the waffles are delicious! The service of the butler Nikki is also good, and he will send me the hotel check-in strategy in advance! Generally speaking, the price in the off-season and the scenery of the hotel are worth it👍

The space is huge, the pool is beautiful, and the children are very happy. The hotel has two lawns, which are beautiful to take pictures. I also like the swimming pool design. There are children's slides and several garden-style swimming pools. There is also a children's pool next to the 1.2-meter swimming pool. The design is very good. Walking to the end of the lawn is the beach and the sea. Although it is a public beach, there are 24-hour patrols by the hotel's security, so we can feel at ease playing on the beach at night. Finally, I would like to praise the hotel for its thoughtfulness. There are many, many free swimming rings and Sand-digging toys made me think that all hotels are like this. After arriving at Atlantis, I bought a swimming ring for 128, and the child’s swimming ring was sold out and I couldn’t buy it... I will return it next time I come to Sanya will choose here

In addition, I would like to thank the handsome guy Rick at the front desk again. We traveled as a family and arranged a very suitable room for us. He also introduced the hotel and some surrounding information in detail. The service is very warm.

The a**osphere of the hotel is very good, giving people a very comfortable feeling and very quiet. I thought no one was staying there, but who knew there were so many people at breakfast the next day. There is no time to play in the children's facilities. I hope to have fun when I come next year.

msg:The five-star hotels on the coastline of Haitang Bay are very satisfied with the environment, facilities and services, and the hotel will have a dedicated service butler to contact the guests in advance to inquire about their needs. During the stay, they will also remind them of the hotel's activities, and they will also ask the guests for their feedback after leaving the store. I find it very detailed and thoughtful. The hotel's breakfast is also very good, with a variety of varieties, especially the baked goods, which are very delicious. Next time I come to Haitang Bay, I will choose Lee & Man Sofitel

msg:First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the housekeeper Xiaoyu, and I am very satisfied with her service. The auntie is also very good at cleaning the room.
Other than that, the hotel is pretty grand, but I'm really not satisfied with it.
First of all, when I communicate with them at the front desk, I feel that I am disturbing them. Even if it doesn't work, I should be more patient. I know that work is not easy, but my attitude was very good when I communicated things twice, but I really feel that I am disturbing them. The not-so-good ones don’t refer to the results.
What I am most dissatisfied with is the so-called parent-child hotel. There are very few things to do. The water park only has slides and swings. The naughty castle is very old and the hygiene is worrying.
Then the price of the room, the suite we booked, is not low, and there are only two breakfasts. I don’t know what to say about the breakfast. It looks dazzling, but there is nothing to eat.

The children's playground and children's water play area are also very sincere.
The park of the hotel is also very beautiful. Walking all the way to the beach at night really feels like a vacation.
In particular, I would like to praise the housekeeper Emily, who contacted us to confirm the needs the day before check-in, and responded to any questions in a timely manner after check-in. We forgot to bring mosquito repellent water and asked the colleagues in the concierge to borrow it quickly.
In short, it is a very cost-effective hotel that is worth staying in.

msg:I have to record that this is the first time I have given a review after staying in so many hotels. In addition to feeling troublesome to write reviews, I think there is nothing worthy of likes and comments. But this time I must praise our Sofitel from the bottom of my heart, especially if you travel with children, you must stay in Sofitel once, and if conditions permit, you must stay in a luxury sea view suite. It will really surprise you. In fact, I go to Sanya several times a year, and the last stop must be Haitang Bay, because it is the closest to the duty-free shop. Therefore, the hotels in Haitang Bay are basically checked in. After all the experience, Lee & Man Sofitel is definitely the hotel with the highest cost performance, the best service and first-class quality. For a temporary trip on May Day, the parent-child room booked to upgrade the hotel to a luxury sea view suite is really beautiful and profitable. Here, I must thank our director Xiao Jin, who is not only beautiful but also very gentle. Originally, the May Day trip was a bit crowded and unpleasant, but all the unpleasantness disappeared in an instant after changing to the Sofitel Hotel. I actually found the feeling of going home, very reassuring, warm and comfortable. Thank you very much for the high-quality experience brought by Sofitel. It is decided that Sofitel will not stay in Haitang Bay in the future. A happy and warm stay experience is trustworthy. Look for Xiao Jin when you stay at Lee & Man Sofitel.

We have priority to check in when we arrive early. , The view of the room is good but tasteful. Later, Xiao Jin hurriedly arranged the downstairs room for a visit.

msg:The second stop in Sanya, Lee & Man Sofitel is really great, it can be said to be the best hotel ever stayed in!

First of all, the facilities of the hotel are very complete. The hotel is very large, with swimming pool, gym and so on. The swings by the pool and the deck chairs by the beach are really comfortable and perfect for relaxing. The only regret is that the swimming pool ends at 8 o'clock. It would be better if it could be delayed by an hour or two~
The room is also very large and comfortable, with a bathtub, and the warm yellow lighting makes people feel very belonging. The bed is really soft, which can improve the quality of sleep. The sanitation is also very clean, and there will be a review after cleaning to ensure the cleanliness of the room.

Secondly, the hotel environment is also very good. The room is a 180-degree sea view room, standing on the balcony has a wide view, comfortable and relaxing. It is also close to the surrounding attractions. It is only 3 kilometers to Atlantis Water World and only 10 minutes to the duty-free shop. The transportation is very convenient.

Finally, we must focus on the service of the hotel! Here I would like to praise my housekeeper, Miss Jin, who has been in touch with us since the day before we checked in and even upgraded our room type. He was also very enthusiastic when we checked in. During our stay, he also visited us at any time, patiently answered our questions, and added a lot to our trip!
The hotel's breakfast is rich in variety and delicious; there is also room order service, the beef brisket noodles are so delicious, and the pizza is also very good! !

All in all, as a hotel located in Haitang Bay, Leeman Sofitel is one of the best in every aspect! The most important thing is that the price is also reasonable, which can be said to be the king of cost performance in Haitang Bay! ! Very recommendable! !

There are many parent-child activities. The children go to Little Chef every afternoon and do two baking sessions. The children's playground and children's pool are very fun, and children basically soak in them.
The environment of the hotel is beautiful, the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant. Although you can't go to the sea, digging sand on the beach is also quite good.
The service staff you meet on the road will take the initiative to say hello, and will solve the needs in time, and they are very enthusiastic.
Thanks to the butler Xiaojin for booking Chinese restaurants and Thai restaurants for us in advance. The taste of each restaurant is also very good.
I would like to mention the bedding in particular. If you stay in a hotel, you may not be used to sleeping on pillows, but this one is very comfortable, and the bed and quilt are big enough for three people to cover.
The only downside may be that there is not enough air conditioning in some places because of the large open space.

I have never been to other hotels in Haitang Bay, but as far as his family is concerned, there is no pitfall, and I must recommend it!

msg:From Yalong Bay to Haitang Bay, I am very satisfied with Sofitel, and the service is in place. My housekeeper is Nikki, who provided me with very good service from the beginning to the end. The most commendable thing about the hotel is the strong sense of art, the strong sense of garden landscape design, and the harmonious and unified color matching of the rooms. Parent-child programs are very rich, and it is difficult to find a hotel richer than Sofitel. The water children's playground is very enjoyable for an adult like me. The hotel's toiletries all smell of Lavin's amber orange, which smells very good. When 4-year-old children wash their hands with soap, they all comment that it smells really good. When packing the luggage on the last day, the child turned on the TV for the first time, and unexpectedly found that there was a stereo in the bathroom. In addition, the hotel's bathrobes are comfortable to wear and have a sense of design.
Swim in the outdoor heated swimming pool/children's water park: the swimming pool is very good, and the temperature is very suitable for children.
Service: The housekeeper Nikki is very responsible, and I will contact her next time.

The environment of the hotel is good, there is a row of coconut trees walking towards the beach, it is super comfortable, and the photos are also very good.
Praise the water park and swimming pool! The "big horn" is super fun, and the children went up and down and played it at least 10 times. There is a small hot spring pool next to the water park. The water is warm and the water depth is suitable. Children will not be cold if they soak in the water!
I would like to recommend the hotel's buffet dinner ~ seafood, barbecue, Western food, Chinese food, all in one, and the taste is also good!
In addition, her family's French desserts are also delicious! ! ! The materials are exquisite, the appearance is exquisite, and the taste is superb! ! !

The room is too small and the layout is unreasonable. On the way to the children's paradise, we were pushing the stroller on the slope, and the guy who drove the shuttle bus was in such a hurry to get there? They almost squeezed the children into the water and almost crushed us. A negative review is necessary! No sense of service at all. The hardware is average, but the software is terrible.

msg:2023.3.20-2023.3.22, 2 adults and 1 child (6 years old)
From Shanghai to Sanya, I chose Sofitel as the first stop. I was very pleasantly surprised and satisfied. Originally I was going to book Yate, but because the rooms were full, I booked Sofitel without any knowledge, but I didn't expect it to be perfect.
Xiao Jin, the hotel housekeeper, added WeChat in advance, and sent out the check-in points, the location of various facilities, and the schedule of Little Prince's activities, which was very clear. Thank you Xiaojin for taking care of me. Xiaojin will take the initiative to ask if there are enough supplies in the room, etc., which is great. Check-in at the front desk was quick. We lived on the 7th floor of the Emerald Building. The view is very good, the room layout is reasonable, and the sea view looks very good. It is very convenient to eat and participate in various entertainment activities. In fact, I feel that other floors are also very convenient. I brought my own bubble bath ball and bathtub cover, and the bathtub is very comfortable. The whole hotel is not big, it is good because it is not big, haha.
Every staff member is very enthusiastic. The little brother who came to the hotel to help carry the luggage, the aunt who cleaned the room, helped to deliver clothes hangers and children’s bathrobes, children’s pedals, etc., everyone in the restaurant, even drove the battery car and small train, etc. , I feel super good.
Meals: The buffet breakfast is very good, and the buffet dinner is also available. The bread for breakfast is freshly baked, and the omelette is delicious. I also ordered takeaway once during the period, and I had to pick it up from the dining cabinet, which was outside the lobby.
Activities of the Little Prince: I took the little train, made French toast (the children made the whole process by themselves, and they thought it was delicious to eat by themselves), drew a hand-painted kite and could take the kite home, and the bubble party was great.
Swimming pool: There are several. Children like to swim. There are several deck chairs that are very convenient. There are also places to wipe your body with towels. Among them, the slides in the children's pool are beautiful and clean, and the big speakers have been played more than a dozen times (an adult and a child are sitting on a rubber boat and sliding down is super fun, and the children's version of the big speakers is worth trying).
Passports with 5 chapters can be exchanged for an ice cream ball. The children have a sense of accomplishment and think this ice cream ball is very delicious.
Beach: The hotel walks to the beach for about 6-8 minutes. There are hammocks and rocking chairs along the way, which children like. Haitang Bay has big waves, so be careful. Step on the waves on the side. I brought my own sand-digging toys (iron ones are recommended for easy digging), and I dug some mini shells, which was very interesting. The sun came out and the photo was beautiful. There is a place to wash your feet near the beach. I went to the beach both mornings, and I couldn't think of leaving.
I ate Coconut Chicken near the hotel. There are also various restaurants in the 68 Food Street, which are very close, and the online car-hailing costs about 10 yuan.
I am very satisfied with the stay. The children said that they would like to come again next time, and always said that Sofitel is like home.

I learned that my birthday on the day of check-in arranged a room upgrade and birthday cake in advance. And this birthday cake is definitely made of solid materials, not for posing. The whole check-in process is very relaxing, and the hotel is more suitable for family vacations. Although Atlantis is good, the business is too good and too noisy. It is quiet and relaxing here, and the children's pool is also very special. The baby was still soaking in it on the day he left the store and refused to leave. Joly thoughtfully helped to delay the check-out until one o'clock. Thank you very much. The kind of butler service that is not excessive or formal, is really responsive to requests It's very high-end.

msg:Sofitel Sanya is a resort hotel with a strong French romantic style. The lobby is magnificent and very popular. The entire hotel has a large area, with a super large lawn, which is a good place to take pictures and roll. The hotel has several outdoor swimming pools for playing and swimming. The children's pool has various recreational facilities, especially suitable for children to play in the water. In addition to deck chairs by the pool, there are also various sofas and hammocks for resting. Sitting or lying in a daze is very relaxing. Checking into the room directly faces the sea of Haitang Bay, and the famous Wuzhizhou Island is just opposite. It is very beautiful to lie on the bed in the morning and watch the sunrise. The hotel offers a lot of fruit, and the French snacks are especially delicious. The beach to which the hotel belongs has big waves and cannot play in the water, but the view is wide and there are not many people. It is worth going for a walk and taking pictures.
Good service is one of the strengths of Sofitel Hotel. I especially appreciate the service staff in the guest depar**ent in the lobby. They are kind and courteous, and they are very good at getting on and off the car door and helping with luggage. I would also like to thank Angela from the guest relations depar**ent for providing butler service, which saved us a lot of trouble. The hotel is not far from the duty-free shop, there is a shuttle bus, but remember to make an appoin**ent the day before!

The service is okay. The housekeeper, Nikki, took the initiative to contact us before he arrived and asked if he had children with him, and if he had any needs. During the stay, he also enthusiastically helped us to solve our doubts, asked us if we had anything to add, reminded us of the children's game time, etc. , which is awesome. The overall facilities are quite good, and the sanitation is not bad. Although it is on the beach, it takes more than ten minutes to walk to the beach, but they have sightseeing buses to take you to the beach, which is not bad. I don't have much requirements for the food. After all, our taste is too spicy, and the breakfast and dinner here are light. The parent-child project can be further strengthened. On the whole, the experience of staying in is still ok…

Facilities: Although it is an old hotel, the facilities are still being updated. After 2 years, the children’s pool has a lot of new equipment, and there are special staff to watch the children play safely, caring👍
Hygiene: Although I didn't stay here for a long time this time, I would always go out again💡. What's amazing is that the auntie helped clean up after breakfast! Replaced with new towels and added new supplies!
Environment: Although the geographical location is not as lively as Sanya Bay and Yalong Bay, a quiet vacation is exactly what I want, so I still choose Haitang Bay and the Leeman Sofitel where I stayed, because there is a private beach within walking distance, which is tiring Just rest on the recliner!
Service: Thank you, Ms. Nikki, the experience officer who accompanied me throughout the whole process. The sweet you brought me a warm feeling, let the children experience a DIY cake, enjoy a afternoon tea, meal time, meals, car time, etc. Let me know in advance, and answer any questions as soon as possible. Thank you very much. It also made me think about bringing the elderly to stay again. I look forward to seeing you next time!

A very satisfactory stay experience. Taking the elderly on vacation ⛱️, the gentle and beautiful housekeeper, Ms. Nikki, had communicated by phone in advance the day before arrival and wrote down all our needs in detail. Before arriving at noon the next day, nikki sent a message to inform that the room was cleaned and ready in advance and could be checked in at any time. Let us save the trouble of waiting for a room after a long journey. As soon as you arrive at the lobby, drink a prepared special drink, the sweet and sour ice is cold, and the fragrance is refreshing. With Sofitel's unique fragrance, people's holiday favor will be upgraded instantly. Since we originally booked a double bedroom in the sky, we temporarily decided to upgrade to a suite with a swimming pool. Ms. Nikki showed me the room type in person, and the whole process was warm and pleasant. After we checked in, we thoughtfully provided the hotel's entertainment and catering information, and also gave us a lot of entertainment packages, which doubled our goodwill. In the afternoon, I went to the executive lounge. Although there are not many varieties, the service and taste are better. I chose the hotel's buffet for dinner, which is also a very good choice. Overall, the two-day itinerary was very pleasant, and the family unanimously decided to stay here again next time they come to Haitang Bay!

I booked this trip to Sanya at the end of December. I chose a hotel for a long time, and I chose Sofitel because she met all my requirements.
I have a baby, so I hope to book a room that opens the door to the swimming pool. The poolside suite is especially good! Almost chartered swimming!
Considering that the weather is not so hot, I hope the hotel has a constant temperature swimming pool. Although the constant temperature pool is a bit small, it is already very good.
Or because the little baby needs a child-friendly hotel, the hotel has many facilities for children, the dolls play very happily, and want to play without eating or sleeping every day😓
It is also very close to the beach. Unfortunately, the baby is too young to dig sand. The hotel has all kinds of sand digging tools, so you don't need to bring them yourself.
The check-in experience was also very good. Emily contacted me one day in advance and asked if there were any special needs at the time of arrival. During the check-in period, she kept asking about our situation. She answered all questions and was very thoughtful and enthusiastic❤️Thank you very much Emily 😃

Temporary change Check-in plan. After booking that night, Nikki, Sofitel's check-in experience officer, called and added WeChat, and sent a lot of information about the hotel's event experience and catering check-in information, which is very useful for first-time guests. On the day of check-in, I was informed in advance that the room had been arranged, and I was carefully informed of the small details of check-in. When I learned that I needed to upgrade to a sea view suite with an additional fee, I arranged to change the room in time, and finally stayed in the 931 sea view suite with a superb view. It has a large living room with double balconies, double bathrooms, and walk-in cloakroom. The space layout is very reasonable, and the room is quite airy. As soon as the door is opened, there is a whistling sea breeze. This is my second vacation in Hainan with my mother. It happened to be Valentine's Day when I checked in. The room attendant carefully decorated the bedroom with towels and rose petals, giving us a sweet surprise. I planned to go to Wuzhizhou Island on the second day. When I bought the ticket, I knew that the 68-year-old man could not go to the island, so I asked my mother to rest in the hotel alone. Due to the large number of tourists entering the island that day, boarding the boat and taking the battery car around the island required queuing, which delayed a lot of time and could not catch up with two o'clock check-out. After contacting Nikki, I got very enthusiastic and powerful help. First, I arranged for the bellman to help the elderly to pull all the luggage to the concierge depar**ent, and then helped check out and arranged for the elderly to have afternoon tea in the lounge. Finally, when we learned that we were about to return to the hotel, they The old man was sent to the hotel lobby to wait, and a small gift was given. The old man was very happy.

In contrast, Sofitel has a more comfortable stay experience and a more dynamic hotel. There are more options for dining and entertainment. For meals, you can choose Thai restaurants, Hainan Pearl Chinese restaurants, all-day restaurant buffets and noodle restaurants. The hotel has swimming pools suitable for children's entertainment, as well as quiet seaside swimming pools, with coconut groves and large grasslands and clean beaches. . In the dead of night, lying on the rocking chair on the balcony, blowing the sea breeze and looking at the starry sky, it feels great.

There is also a French welcome drink Sofitel Red in the lobby, which is cold and delicious. There are many children in the hotel, and children can check in for ice cream 🍨 and surprise gifts 🎁
The location of the hotel is in the middle of Haitang Bay. It is very convenient to go to the duty-free shop, 68 Food City, Linwang Night Market, and Haichang Dream Night City. Overall, it is good. Five-star praise supports Xiaojin. Ha

msg:For four days from the 18th to the 21st, I was communicating with Ctrip because this hotel could not cancel the order. I also tried calling the hotel, and the person who answered the phone unsurprisingly referred me to the reservation depar**ent. We communicated many times during this period, and emphasized many times that we already had colds and fevers, and the whole family had symptoms. Under such circumstances, the reason why the hotel refused to cancel the order was because of the change in epidemic policy. This force majeure was clearly played by you. of. During this period, Ctrip customer service also provided me with a plan, asking me to submit a photo of my antigen positive and ID card together, but I didn’t get the answer until the 20th. I submitted it, but the hotel still refused to accept it. The reason was still that the epidemic policy had changed, and after I explained that if you didn't cancel the order, I had planned to stay. In this case, the hotel still refused to agree to the cancellation, so I tolerated it. , Ctrip suggested that I change the date, and I said that I should change it forward. I would stay for one day and then go home. Then on the afternoon of the 21st, Ctrip called me and told me that the price difference for this order would require me to place a new order. Date, the old date will give me the cancellation. If you have too much, you will not retreat; if you have less, you will make up for it. As a result, it is impossible to change the date even if it is rescheduled.
I traveled as scheduled and went to pick up the room at almost 6 o'clock. The front desk informed me that there was still one room that had not been cleaned yet. I was really filled with questions. If I come at 3 o'clock and you say that I have to wait an hour if there is no room, forget it. I don't check in until almost six o'clock. Just tell me that there is still a room and it will take another hour. The front desk also planned to leave my phone number. As soon as I heard this, I knew that he was going to call and ask me to go to the front desk to get the room card. I hurriedly asked the front desk to send it directly to the room before he could say the next sentence. You would do anything with me. The arrangements are finished. Besides, when I checked in, I was standing and the hotel receptionist was sitting, so you were tired. My senses dropped to 0 before check-in. From check-in to now, this hotel must be blacklisted. It is impossible to stay there again.
After checking in, I couldn’t say enough about the room.

msg:A very infuriating hotel!
The child just checked into the hotel and went into the children's pool for the first time. Because the children's pool has a gentle slope, there are foam and water on the gentle slope, which is very slippery. He slipped in the air as soon as he got into the water, and his buttocks fell heavily on the ground. After examination at the 301 Hospital, it was found that his coccyx was fractured!
1. The slope of the children's gentle slope is very gentle. If you don't observe carefully, you can't see that it is a water slope. The danger is not easy to be discovered. There is no danger warning sign next to it!
2. The design of the swimming pool is very **. You can't design a slope with water. You have to design it as a step. This is basic common sense! The design of such a slope in the swimming pool is a ** design for arson!
3. The hotel has only expressed verbal condolences since the accident. I accompanied the child to the hospital many times for medical treatment, but no one accompanied me. The attitude of not caring about it is not my business!
4. After the accident, the hotel used the compensation plan of the third-party insurance company to send the parties away. Only 600 yuan of medical examination and registration fees and 120 yuan per day for 10 days of rehabilitation fees were compensated. The hotel itself has no compensation liability.
5. Within the scope of the hotel's own business premises, the hotel did not achieve reasonable design, reasonable prevention, and reasonable reminder measures, and must bear the main responsibility! Sofitel Hotel's irresponsible shirking of responsibility after the incident is recommended for reference by tourists. Do you dare to bring your children to play in a hotel without a sense of responsibility? Fortunately, it was a child who fell. If an elderly person accompanying a child falls and breaks a bone here, the guests will regret it too late with this attitude of the hotel! 
6. Hygiene issues: The toilet lid of the hotel was not cleaned, and there were yellow urine marks left by the previous guests on it! 
7. The hotel is very pitfall, everyone must not come!

We chose a Thai restaurant for the New Year's Eve dinner. I didn't expect the taste to be very good. The location is six to seven kilometers away from the duty-free city. If you want to go, you can take a taxi for ten minutes. If you don’t want to go, you can stay in the hotel away from the noise and it’s not boring. In short, the three days and two nights from New Year’s Eve to the second day of junior high school are very happy. Dad and My son said he would come again.

Executive afternoon tea/happy hour: The suite product includes afternoon tea and happy hour, which is very cost-effective! Perhaps due to the off-season, the executive lounge was not open for the first half of the trip. Afternoon tea and happy hour were completed in the lobby bar, and the experience was quite good. Sitting outside in the afternoon, the children were very happy.

msg:Environment: The garden is large, beautiful, and green

Facilities: There are many swimming pools, two constant temperature pools, one in the children's pool, but unfortunately the slide pool is not constant temperature, the pool next to the slide pool has a constant temperature of 90cm, 28 degrees. Another constant temperature pool is near the sea, so I didn't go swimming.
The facilities in the room are average, the room is not as big as InterContinental and Yanheng, the mattress and bedding are not as good as other hotels, the bathroom in the room has rust, the hair dryer is still old-fashioned, Yanlord InterContinental is Dyson, and does not provide disposable toilet covers , bathtub set.

Service: The butler Emily is very nice, the service is good, and Emily is satisfied with the service. The service consciousness of other waiters is not as good as that of Yanlord. They are all 5-star hotels, and the service feels a bit inferior.
Catering: The breakfast category is average, there is nothing to eat, the type of bread is okay, but it is still not as good as Yanheng, and there is no mineral water. The buffet dinner is okay, 388 per person. There is no charge for the three children in my family. I charged the money for the three adults. The food is not bad. ￼
Overall, it is not as good as Yanlord, but the price I set was 500 yuan cheaper than Yanlord per day. The garden is very beautiful and large. I am not satisfied with the room, but the scenery outside the balcony is very good, and there are a lot of entertainment for children, so the price Based on the advantages, the cost performance is also good, recommended.

The hotel's constant temperature swimming pool is the warmest. When you come to Sanya at this time, you still have to pay attention to heat preservation. The hotel has a lot of children's facilities, both indoors and outdoors! Due to the weather, the outdoor ones are not played much, but the indoor ones are also very large and relatively new.
It’s just that the hotel is too big, you need to walk to many places, and you have to hold your baby. The hotel has baby strollers that you can rent. It is recommended that babies around 2 years old can consider it

Facts have proved that my choice was correct. Check-in was very smooth. The housekeeper, Xiao Miao, took the initiative to add WeChat and answered my various questions in a timely manner. He also asked for my suggestions and gave my son two karting coupons. I said I was afraid that it would not be fun for children to play once. It was more thoughtful than I thought.

To be honest, although it looks a bit old-fashioned and not so popular on the Internet, it is definitely at the forefront of Haitang Bay in terms of parent-child and leisure. And the service is absolutely online, especially thanks to Emily, who allowed us to check in on time and check out later when the room situation was so tight, which was really helpful when we were dragging our families.
In addition, the Chinese restaurant is of a good standard. Inviting friends to dinner is also very satisfying.

Our butler Xiaoxin is a beautiful and gentle girl. I was not very satisfied with the room I got at the beginning. After communicating with Xiaoxin, she helped us solve it very quickly. During the period, the person in charge of the room also came to inquire about the situation. It gave me the feeling that the hotel attaches great importance to the problems reported by the guests, and the service is very thoughtful. The children needed to print out the learning materials for online classes, so they asked Xiaoxin for help and immediately helped them out. The check-in experience was very good, and I will bring my parents back next time.

It is very convenient to go to the beach. It only takes seven or eight minutes to walk. All the thoughts on the seaside are always gentle, mixed with a bit of quiet sunset, and a bit of melancholy at sunset, watching the clouds roll and relax, and watching the tide rise and fall.

It is a little inconvenient to travel among the five-star hotels in Haitang Bay, and you often have to go back when driving.
It's a pity that the travel photography didn't take place, saying that there is no schedule.
Since Haitang Bay is not easy to enter the water, the dining experience of the Seaview Hotel is very important. The breakfast is good, and the desserts in the hotel package are also good value for money.

The hotel has good green environment and a large area. It takes 6-7 minutes to walk to the beach. Currently, only the swimming pool near the beach is open! It's cold now, it's better to go at noon

Next to the lobby, there is a French welcome drink Sofitel red, grapes 🍇 and pineapple 🍍 and lavender syrup. The taste is okay and cold, and you can enjoy it during the day!

The curtains can be left undrawn for 24 hours because no other room can see inside. This kind of very private guardianship will give people a strong sense of security! I compared the decorative pillars in the room, and I think it is an anti-peeping design. This way I can see the outside view while lying in bed which is a pleasant surprise! Because it is a French hotel, I ate bread for two days for breakfast, which was really delicious, and I could only taste a little sweetness after a sip of sugar-free coffee. The taste is delicate and rich. The hotel's green public area is particularly large, and the entire public area is subtly divided into several small public areas. If you want to sell nerds outdoors, there will always be a place for you. Very recommended! Another comment is that the helicopter landing and landing in the resort hotel is a bit noisy, but the housekeeper Xiaojin's meticulous care and greetings made my vacation trip more complete.

During the stay, the hotel also has a good place to do accounting. The restaurant only opens the Chinese restaurant, which tastes good. A beach swimming pool that is open to the swimming pool, there are not many people and it is very comfortable. The hotel garden has beautiful scenery.

The hotel rooms have black and white paintings, a characteristic of France in the 1920s.
The hotel's special French desserts are also good.
The French style is very strong in the hotel, and it is also a rare style.
There is also a food court around the hotel, which is also very convenient. It takes 10 minutes to go to the duty-free shop, and it is also close to the airport. Thanks again Nikki
Let me spend a vacation in Sofitel comfortably. Among the hotels in Haitang Bay, I feel that the price/performance ratio is the best. I will recognize Sofitel next time I come to Sanya.

This is the second time I stayed, and more than 1,700 people who stayed in the previous peak season gave good reviews. . . This time I was really speechless. . . .
1. It is said that the hotel has only opened one building for occupancy for renovation, and the house in this building is really old and interesting. . It's hard to say! ! !
2. Originally, Ctrip booked this hotel’s package. There are fewer people and many hotels will upgrade the room type. Others can’t do it. I was stupid when I entered the room. The room felt crooked, so I asked the front desk to upgrade the room type at my own expense; It's too bad! The front desk is unyielding and unrelenting and says that there will be charges! ! !
3. It’s been two weeks since the hotel contacted me and said that they forgot to deduct the room rate when refunding the deposit (it should be more than 100, but I can’t remember). ! !
This hotel has been blocked by me since then, it's too rubbish! I have never seen such a hotel with no quality and no quality! There are too many hotels with the same price around 1000, please don’t stay here, find some new ones, don’t come here! ! ! Garbage uppercase low

I have lived in Sofitel Sydney for several months. In fact, every time I come to Sanya, I cannot do without Sofitel! The bed is very comfortable, the pillows are very comfortable, and the facilities near the pool are amazing! The service is also particularly attentive, whether it is a Chinese restaurant or a morning buffet, I am deeply impressed every time.

The only fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel's fruit category is not particularly good. Other hotels have passion fruit, papaya, etc. The only tropical fruit is pineapple. Once at breakfast, I asked the waiter (Mr. Wang) in the fruit area if he had papaya. Although there was none, Wang The gentleman took the initiative to ask if he would mind eating mangoes, which is so sweet! This kind of service is wise service, and I will teach the employees of my company a lesson when I go back. Thank you Sofitel for the exquisite facilities and high-end service! I will definitely be back!

Swimming pool: The children's swimming pool and the adult swimming pool that I like very much are separated by a long distance, and each has a large design to ensure that the adult swimming pool will not be too noisy, and the swing loungers by the swimming pool can comfortably sleep all day;

Room: It is not a retro decoration style, it is lighter and brighter;

Durian buns eat two per meal. Whether the equipment is imported is different from the one next door or Yalong Bay. A must try is the welcome Sofitel sour, a little sour and sweet.

fun. The hotel offers a variety of activities to enrich the fun, but what really helps is the strong hardware. The children's playground is large and well-organized, with a lot of fun. Indoor karting is not only fun for children, but adults are also very happy. They will also teach children to draw kites. The quality is very good, and they can fly kites on the beach for an afternoon.

Nice to see. The hotel set is very suitable, not complicated, and very attractive. Anyway, it looks good no matter how you take it. There are two large swimming pools, one is suitable for children to play in person, and the other is specially for brushing circles. All the way to the beach, it's beautiful. It is also related to the fact that there are not many people just after the epidemic. The sea view room is also very eye-catching when lying flat and looking out.

The housekeeper Emily helped lock the upper-floor room in advance, and provided nucleic acid test information every day, which was the most important thing at the moment. Special thanks to Fiona, the beautiful room manager, who helped retrieve the drone that fell into the top floor. I come to Haitang Bay three times a year, and I have to come back to experience Sofitel before the border opens, which is a very good experience.

Joly, the guest relations director, was our butler and answered all questions. The service was efficient and positive. The response is that I am overall satisfied. I like the French-style hotel lobby. There are French bouquets 💐 very beautiful! Five-star praise

msg:We decided to come to the Sofitel for one night to play with the kids. After checking in, the room was arranged. Joly, the guest relations director, Jinmei, was our little housekeeper. She answered all questions and the service was considerate. It was good.
The hotel lobby is spacious and the room is in French style👍🏻When the weather is good in the morning, you can even watch the sunrise on the beach!
There are two large swimming pools and a helipad. The garden is also beautiful for taking pictures. The children's paradise and children's swimming pool are all for children. They are suitable for families. They can be used by couples and friends when traveling.
In the lobby, you will also see the young lady giving balloons to the children🎈The lobby also has a welcome drink Sofitel Red, made of grape🍇 and pineapple juice, which is suitable for the weather in Sanya [laughing]
The hotel also has a bakery. The Little Prince activities for children are free and no reservation is required, which is not bad! Five-star praise supports support!

msg:Unexpectedly, the popularity of the summer vacation has just started, and eating breakfast is like visiting a vegetable market. However, the organization and service of the hotel are still in place. It's good in every way, it has everything it should have, and it does everything well. If you have to be picky, it feels like it's missing some iconic features. In addition, the attention to children is not enough. For example, there is no small stool in the washstand, and children cannot reach by themselves to wash their faces and brush their teeth, which is still less detailed than professional parent-child hotels.

First of all, the hardware is much newer, and the decoration is also more a**ospheric. The Shangri-La elevator has to pass through the guest rooms on the third floor, which is really unbearable. The breakfast is very rich, and the parent-child cooking is also very good. There are not too many key people, which is very appetizing. Butler Nikki's service is very thoughtful, here is a good review

I was a little disappointed😞. Overall, it is cost-effective. I will choose it next time!

msg:Love the Sofitel so much! ! ! Let’s talk about the housekeeper Xiaozuo first, her WeChat name is “R”, a very beautiful and nice girl. She originally booked an executive sea view room for 8 days and 7 nights. Due to the hotel decoration the next day, please help the housekeeper to coordinate and upgrade to an executive suite for free. ! More space for kids to play! During the stay, there were two days of rest for Xiao Zuo, but she was very dedicated and professional. Next, I would like to praise the duty manager FRANCIS. My daughter lost her Huawei phone watch while playing. According to the location of the mobile phone, it was near the lobby. I couldn’t find it after searching for it all night. I asked the duty manager to adjust the monitoring early the next morning. The track and the approximate time, I helped me check the monitoring twice, and finally found the watch in the corner of the lobby bar. Although the watch is not very expensive, the manager on duty at night who helped me in the work group to help me find the watch the night before. , and the staff in the executive lounge who helped me find it, I was very moved.
Besides the environment, the scenery at the entrance of the lobby is very beautiful during the day and evening, the scenery of the swimming pool, grass and beach is very large in minutes, the sunken seat of the Thai restaurant is very distinctive, and the terrace of the lobby bar is also very beautiful.
What I have to say when staying in a hotel is the food. I have stayed in many star-rated hotels all over the country. To say that the Sofitel has a complete variety and a long breakfast opening time, it is among the best. After staying for a week, there are many different categories every day, which can be eaten from the morning. At the rhythm of noon, there are actually claypot rice that other hotels have never seen for breakfast... The buffet of seafood and desserts in the evening is too much to eat, and the children can't walk until they eat it, haha! The afternoon tea and evening wine tasting sessions in the executive lounge make people feel that living in an executive room here, you don't have to pay for your own meals at all. The most important thing to mention is the welcome drink in the lobby bar, Sofitel's homemade flower and fruit tea "Sofitel "Sour", it's super delicious, every day when I'm playing and passing by, my child will have a drink, and when I'm going to change hotels, I'll have a drink, haha! This time, I will stay in 4 hotels in Sanya. Currently, only Sofitel makes me feel that I will stay at his house when I come to Sanya~

Before check-in, the customer service added WeChat in advance, and the reserved garden view room was upgraded to a sea view room, but the air conditioner in the upgraded room made abnormal noise and was close to the elevator entrance, which was quite noisy. I changed to a room with a strong smell that night, so I couldn't check in at all. Had to live in the original room. There are few varieties of breakfast, and there are long queues without any service! There is even more bugs. Children’s feet were scratched on the bottom of the pool when they were swimming in the children’s pool. They reported to the hotel that they checked and found no abnormalities.

Because I arrived early, they helped me to arrange a room for check-in in advance at 12 o'clock. During the stay, she also meticulously inquired about the check-in situation.

The executive lounge in the morning has a complete range of food and beverages, all of which are delicious and beautiful. The attitude of the hotel staff is also very enthusiastic.

msg:For this honeymoon trip, I chose two bays and two hotels in Sanya, both belonging to the Accor Group, each with its own merits. The Leeman Sofitel located in Haitang Bay has seen many good reviews before, and the price-performance ratio in Haitang Bay Hotel is also relatively high, so I booked it for three days and two nights. First of all, I would like to thank Xiaolu, the personal housekeeper this time, who contacted me in advance before I checked in, and tried my best to meet special needs. My husband was unwell and arranged for a late check-out. The hotel also arranged honeymoon arrangements, welcome fruits, and types of breakfast. Abundance is also my appetite because there are too many people. The Thai restaurant tastes good. The all-day restaurant seafood buffet dinner has a lot of varieties, but there is not too much seafood, and the overall dining environment is good. The overall French style of the hotel is very beautiful, the garden is also well maintained, and the whole coconut grove is very beautiful. We live in a luxury sea view king-size room in the Emerald Building, with a 2-meter queen-size bed. The bedding is comfortable, the room area is large, and the moving lines are easy to use. I like the large mirror and double wash basin in the bathroom. It is very convenient to use. Arranged a bubble bath🧼, very relaxing. The view from the balcony is also good.
Disadvantages: The air-conditioning in the room is a bit cold, and it is a long way from the beach. It is faster to take the hotel shuttle bus, and it is a bit tiring to walk. The beach in Haitang Bay is indeed clearer than Sanya Bay, and the waves are cool. The private lounge chair area is too Less, the self-contained swimming pool is also a bit far, not as good as Pullman Sanya Bay Haiju. The lobby is a little too hot, the restaurant service can't keep up, and the restaurant staff are not enthusiastic enough.
Overall, it is a good choice if you simply want to stay in a hotel. There are also many choices for eating around, and many restaurants can come and pick them up. The duty free shop is also very close. It is very convenient to take a taxi. The kart experience is also worth it. There are many family activities in the hotel.

The stay experience is very good, the rooms are clean and comfortable, there are many swimming pools, there is a large lawn, it is very convenient to go out to the beach. The hotel's Xiaohui is very enthusiastic. He added WeChat in advance and provided all the needs in every possible way. Because we are a big family, there are six rooms in total. There was a slight delay when we checked in because we needed to wait for one room. Xiaohui also applied to us for catering. The coupon can be used in the restaurant of the hotel, thank you very much. Overall, the hotel is highly recommended and gave us an unforgettable trip to Haitang Bay in Sanya. We will come again next time.

Before I checked in, the housekeeper Xiaohui added me on WeChat, asked about my special needs, and prepared children's slippers, bathrobes and toiletries. I explained various precautions, meal times, etc. It feels very intimate. The hotel is very suitable for children. The small train, go-kart and helicopter are readily available. The children's playground is also quite large. The landscaping is very good. , Maybe because the hotel is relatively large and the room is basically full, it does not feel noisy and crowded, and it is very clean.

Hotel facilities, services, quality, and details fully meet the quality of Sofitel, especially the French chef of the restaurant has been on-site to guide and supervise the food preparation. The French general manager often inspects the work of various positions. It reflects that Sofitel Hotel attaches great importance to the image of the hotel and the feelings it gives to guests. It can be seen that they are constantly improving and improving. five-star hotel.

msg:The hotel has butler service, which is very good. Thanks to the butler Nikki for his warm service, helping to make restaurant reservations, taking the initiative to delay check-out, and answering any questions! If it wasn't for a housekeeper, the service would be at most 2 stars, and the hygiene would be at most 3 stars. The housekeeper responded quickly, but the implementation was not satisfactory. It would take at least an hour to deliver a match or a bath towel, and the daylily was cold. I was not active in cleaning, so I didn't come to clean until the evening. How far the chef at the buffet dinner can drive you with a single word, I just asked how long it would take for the grilled squid, and said impatiently waiting, which is unimaginable. The sanitation is not very good. The room card was not obtained until 5 o'clock after check-in. The housekeeper was very good. He took the initiative to give the order coupons and entered the room. There are bugs all over the ground. The water in the pool is warm, which is good, but the water is dirty beyond description. The children's pool is even dirtier and the facilities are bad. I tried the hotel buffet dinner, afternoon tea and Thai restaurant. The first two are not good, especially the afternoon tea, which is super unpalatable. The Thai restaurant tastes very good and is worth recommending. The hotel rooms are well maintained, the facilities in the room are not old, the garden is lush, the design is very good, there are many parent-child projects, but I didn't participate in it, so I took the baby to drive a go-kart, the interior is very beautiful, and the go-kart service staff has a very good attitude . Overall, the facilities are good, the service is seriously understaffed.

After getting off the bus, you can take a small train to circle the hotel. Children like it very much. During the check-in period, the housekeeper Xiaolu added WeChat in advance to provide various services to the hotel, and informed the hotel of the specific time of the children's play program and the specific location of the nucleic acid test nearby, including meeting the check-out time requirements when leaving the hotel. At the same time, as a parent-child hotel, taking the Little Prince passport to participate in various parent-child activities, the colorful projects attract children to participate every day. In addition, the hotel's outdoor swimming pool has neat bath towels and drinking water at each entry point, sun loungers for sunshade, water hammocks, sand digging tools on the beach connected to the sea, etc., regardless of hardware or software. Very human. I haven’t traveled for 2 years because of the epidemic. The surprise brought by staying at Sofitel is impressive. Unfortunately, I didn’t get the 7-day twin room package, which is definitely the best choice for staying in Haitang Bay! In addition, the decoration of the hotel is very new, the room is a**ospheric, equipped with various plugs for charging, there is a coffee machine, there are many satellite TV channels, and the housekeeper Xiaolu also arranged a large fresh welcome fruit! Let us experience the hotel's care for the guests. If you are a parent, you can stay in the hotel for a whole day, and you should have it! The Sofitel trip was impressive and filled with happy memories throughout the summer! If I come to Sanya next time, I will definitely continue to choose Sofitel. By the way, the breakfast is rich in variety, freshly baked bread cakes and claypot rice, which is really satisfying!

msg:I came to Sanya to travel alone for ten days, and I accidentally saw someone commenting on Sofitel, so I chose Sofitel. I am very satisfied with the result. I stayed in the JW Marriott Yanlord Crowne Plaza for four days in Haitang Bay. There is no harm if there is no comparison. I have to say that Sofitel's staff is very professional, warm and caring. It is very warm and makes me experience the real thing for the first time. The service of the five-star hotel, the service attitude of the Yanlord Crowne Plaza next door is rubbish, the view beach garden swimming pool room decoration style breakfast is not as good as Sofitel's, and the price is expensive. Compared with other homes I have lived in, Sofitel is the best in terms of price and other services. The hotel's housekeeper, Xiaolu, contacted me in time the day before placing the order. She is a very caring housekeeper. If you have any questions, please contact Xiaolu and reply to messages very quickly. Sofitel has complete entertainment and entertainment facilities, which are very suitable for taking a baby vacation. There are many swimming pools and they are very large. The gardens and beaches are very well designed. The night scene at night is also very beautiful. When you go to the beach, you can see the opposite Wuzhizhou Island. There was a small episode on the first day of my stay, but the hotel staff contacted me in a timely manner to communicate with me, solved the problem for me, and was very satisfied with it. On the second day, there was a return visit from the hotel management CC, who arranged a special car for me to go to other hotels. The first time I stayed at Sofitel, I had a very good experience, and the first-class service really couldn’t compare to Crowne Plaza Yanlord. Ps: Yanlord Crowne Plaza is really rubbish, the decoration style is poor and broken, and the service attitude is poor. The first time I stepped on the thunder was Yanlord Crowne Plaza.
Special praise to the housekeeper Xiaolu, the caring little housekeeper made me feel like a family, and CC, if I come to Haitang Bay next time, the first choice is Sofitel Leeman

It’s rare for social animals to take time off for vacation~ I stayed in a villa with other friends a few days ago. I wanted to relax a bit on the last day. After reading a lot of reviews, I finally chose this one. It’s really worth it! The scenery is beautiful, the beach is beautiful, the swimming pool is big, and it is open very late~ The Thai restaurant is really delicious! There is also a caring butler, Xiao Zuo, who is always at our service~
During the stay, Xiao Zuo's service followed up throughout the whole process, which was very considerate. The room was arranged for the birthday, and Xiao Zuo came to arrange the cake in the evening! Very refined! You can tell her anything you need, thank you little left butler!
The hotel as a whole likes the style here, the rooms are elegant, simple and comfortable 😌 Unlike some hotels that have a trendy smell, it is not new, but it is well maintained~
I will stay for a few more days next time~

msg:Let me start with the conclusion. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in Sanya. I will never stay there a second time. I have already blacklisted it in my heart. It definitely does not deserve five stars. Here’s why:
        The service starts from the moment you get off the bus. The person who greets you is not a service staff, but a security staff, so don’t ask for any kind of smiling service. The check-in in the lobby is called slow and hot. Everyone is satisfied. I'm sweating profusely. Some of the staff are more enthusiastic, but some of them I can't praise. The staff at the reception desk opposite were amazing. They were chatting and laughing among their colleagues. They were confused when receiving guests. They were bitter and resentful when they answered the phone. The three expressions switched instantly. It made me feel as if I had arrived in Sichuan and watched a Sichuan Opera. .
        The room is the smallest of all the hotels I have stayed in. Hot water for bathing is very slow and the connection between the shower head and the pipe is leaking. Both sinks could not produce hot water, and when the taps were turned on, water seeped from the joints with the countertops. The plug of the hair dryer was loose and the plug fell off frequently while blowing. A cockroach was found in the room. It was quite big. It opened the eyes of children who had never seen such cute little animals. Thank you very much! The room service phone is particularly difficult to get through. Even if I get through, I often feel like listening to you is better than just talking. And if something happens, the service staff will either stand at the door and call the room, or knock on the door without stopping... I just want to know, is the doorbell in your hotel a decoration? The soundproofing of the room door is also very poor. Mina-san, who was yelling in the corridor, really got up earlier than a chicken, went to bed later than a dog, and had a very loud voice. She was really selfish and not beneficial to others.
        The breakfast is mediocre in variety, average in taste, and the level of confusion is absolutely to the ceiling. I don’t know whether it’s because there are few staff or there’s something wrong with the working methods. It seems like everyone is quite busy and just doesn’t work. Moreover, there are often queues for breakfast, and people can come and go at will at the door. I met two elderly people who generously said, "You guys wait in line first, I will go inside and see if I can get a seat... Don't talk to me about respecting the elderly at this time." If you love children, you are not qualified. If others care about you and you can still quibble indifferently, that is called relying on your elders and selling your elders.
        The swimming pool, unfortunately, is the first and dirtiest one. The water is relatively turbid, and there are a lot of floating objects. No one cleans it up. You can always smell a strange smell when swimming, which you can't smell in other hotels. The only thing worthy of praise is the heated outdoor swimming pool. You can go swimming at night without worrying about getting tanned.
        In addition, this hotel has the lowest quality of guests I have ever encountered. For example, some people smoke in the elevator, still pack their luggage in the elevator when the floor arrives, and let their children block the door to disturb others. I feel that I am very awesome if I live on the Accor Group member floor. , not everyone can afford to live there, and you still think you are superior to others when they order takeout and eat at the hotel buffet yourself... How poor are you? Have you ever eaten or seen it? Can you feel superior by eating at a buffet? I also thank you for opening my eyes! There are also people who don’t line up to eat or get food, and people who get scrambled eggs in a hurry. Do you think you can’t see the queue, or are you just used to it? And the staff clearly saw it but turned a blind eye. There were also people standing in the corridor chatting while blocking the road (good dogs weren’t blocking the way), and those yelling...it was really all kinds of people gathered together.
        I almost forgot, the hotel's public areas are extremely hot, whether it's the lobby, corridors, restaurants, or go-kart play area, you'll feel sticky every minute.
        Just like this Sofitel is actually a luxury hotel under the Accor Group. I really don’t even have the energy to laugh.
        I have written so much without realizing it. The above are just my personal feelings and experiences and do not represent anyone else. They are for reference only.

It is arranged on 3 different floors. The funny thing is that there is one room that is not in the same building. I walked over to my mother for a meal. I can't wait to take a taxi to get to another room. When I checked in at 12:30 in the afternoon, I said Okay, I went out to play first and came back. My room was assigned to another building. There is no proper way to deal with the problem of this room from 8:00 pm to 3:00 pm the next day. ~ We originally booked 4 rooms for 2 nights, but we just checked out the hotel halfway through... There is no idea of staying here at all. The rooms on the lower floors are extremely wet~ Some rooms have balconies that are half as big, and they are sold according to the more expensive selection of luxury sea views~ The room type is wrong. When I questioned, they came when they opened their mouths, the 3rd floor was the 1st floor. The 5th floor is the 2nd floor to the 6th floor and above to see the sea. The garden view room was sold to me as a selection of sea views. The service staff also insisted that this is the room type. Thankfully I asked the housekeeper of the other room in advance. Dealing with things is messy and tossing and turning ~ Let us waste two days to deal with things in the hotel ~ The most basic problem is to send towels and bathrobes, and the processing is very slow... Really a suffocating trip ~ This is the first time I did it on Ctrip Reviews...hopefully the last. I have stayed in so many hotels. Never has a 5🌟 level hotel dealt with such rubbish. The attitude of the housekeeper who helped me deal with it was fine. However, the leader who handled the problem had some problems. Ctrip called the duty manager more than 20 times and no one answered. Usually no one picks up the phone calls to the hotel. If you don't believe me, try it yourself.

In addition, there are many activities for children

Hotel environment: The lobby of Sofitel is very spacious, and the landscaping is very good. From the lawn to the beach swimming pool, you can walk to the seaside.

Hygiene: The hygiene of the guest rooms is OK. The room was cleaned carefully. The French style of the hotel looks warm. The room does not come with toiletries. You can get them at the front desk. It is also full of environmentalism.

Facilities: The hotel currently only has a beach swimming pool, and kayaks and hand boats are free, which is great!

Service: Thumbs up from Xiao Jin. The room aunt is also very nice. Overall, my stay here has been very comfortable for the past few days. Thumbs up👍🏻

The service is very considerate, and the service staff in the hotel will take the initiative to say hello. There were not many people in the first few days when I went, and the service staff were better than the customers. There are many, and the room price is also very reasonable. Although the hotel facilities are a bit old, they are cleaned and maintained very well. I think the living experience is still very good. I stayed in a luxury sea view room. I want a room with a better sea view. The housekeeper specially made it The high floor given, I chose Sofitel from Ctrip for a long time before deciding, my choice is quite correct, I don’t have children, so I don’t have the entertainment facilities of the hotel, I guess it’s not bad, it’s also very close to the beach, the hotel The swimming pool is good, I went to Sanya just to relax, so I am very satisfied

It is very convenient to take a taxi to the duty-free shop! The hotel service is very attentive and warm, especially Xiaolu at the front desk, no matter if we have any questions in the hotel or after leaving the hotel, he will reply patiently, especially warmhearted! The hotel breakfast is also very rich, it should be a French chef, the baguette is very authentic! The pool said nothing! There are also various children&#39;s playgrounds and go-karts! Although the gym is relatively small, it is open 24 hours a day and there are not many people! All in all highly recommended!

The hotel is very big. A large Chris**as tree has been placed in the lobby🎄🎄🎄. This lobby is relatively large in Haitang Bay [silly laugh]
The room is in French style, with a warm design and a French feel. There are also French black and white paintings on the wall.
The room is clean and the aunt cleans it very clean!
Let’s talk about breakfast. We rested late and woke up late. There are no options for breakfast. The hotel should give better choices to guests who come late!
The hotel pool is only open at the beach pool, and kayaks and hand boats are now free! The weather in Sanya is cool in the morning and evening. It is recommended to go swimming around noon or evening to feel more comfortable ~

Finally, I would like to praise the service of the little housekeeper Xiaojin joly. Like and support [strong][strong][strong][strong]!

The afternoon tea and happy hour styles in the executive lounge are not bad, especially the attitude of a waiter in the lounge named Xiaomei is not generally good. It is really considerate to keep asking if you want to add something to suit your taste. , and the hotel's catering food delivered to the room is very delicious, especially the pizza 🍕 The hotel is also very big and the swimming pool is very beautiful.

Although the merchant changed my room, when I moved to the first room, there were insects on the bed, and then I changed it. In the back room, the crack of the door leaked light, indicating that the door was not sealed, and insects could crawl in. 3. The overall outdoor landscape is not bad, but the water in the swimming pool is quite dirty, the children's slide facilities are old, and the slides can't slide at all. 4. The breakfast is quite rich in variety.
The overall experience is not good. Not up to the standard of a five-star hotel

Originally, I only booked an executive sea view room for one night and a luxurious sea view room for one night. The sister in the lounge helped me for two nights. Upgrade to the executive sea view and send the lounge trea**ent, the cocktail hour of the executive lounge every night, there are four kinds of dry white, four kinds of dry red and one kind of bubble, and also make cocktails on the spot, see there are children, keep talking with children Just kidding, it really feels like family, like coming home! Especially feel the four friends in the lounge!
The hotel felt good when I stayed in the hotel last year, so I will bring my children to play this year. The swimming pool is clean, especially the seaside swimming pool is open until ten o'clock at night. Swimming in this swimming pool at night is very relaxing! The children's playground is huge, and the children don't want to walk after playing, and there are various amusement facilities such as the go-kart track!
Last year, I experienced the hotel's Thai restaurant. The products are excellent and the dishes are rich and delicious. It can be said to be one of the best Thai restaurants in Sanya! So this year, I was thinking about going to eat, but due to the epidemic, the Thai restaurant was not open, but the friends in the lounge actually helped coordinate the menus that could be made with the ingredients in the back kitchen, and brought the menus that could be made directly to me. Let me choose the menu and go directly to the Chinese restaurant the next day. The Tom Yum Goong soup is fresh and hot and sour, the charcoal grilled pork neck is delicious, the pineapple fried rice is moderately soft and hard, and there are a lot of shrimp and pineapple. I know what to say to say thank you, thank you again for the friends in the lounge for making me have deep memories!
Forgot to mention, the breakfast is beautiful, there are claypot rice, ice cream and egg tarts delicious!

This time it was arranged by Xiaojin, and all questions were answered. It is more convenient to contact us via WeChat.
Recently, I feel that there are more people, and it is slowly recovering. However, many hotel restaurants have not yet recovered, and the buffet is not available yet. Only the Chinese restaurant has been open.
The hotel room, the elegant music in the lobby, the black and white paintings next to it, the hotel's garden and check-in area all highlight the style of a French hotel. It is different from other hotels. It is worth recommending to stay [pleasant]

It’s really good! Because of the health code, Xiaojin also coordinated and communicated smoothly!
First of all, we were arranged on the 10th floor, which is a very nice room in this room type! The design of the room is quite French, and you can see Wuzhizhou Island in the sea view. The weather is good these two days and it is very comfortable to see the sea, but the hotel here is a little far from the sea, and the view is also ok!
And because of the masks, the restaurants are not fully open, only Chinese restaurants are open, Hainan Cantonese cuisine is more suitable for the public, but you can also go to the nearby food court to eat!
The hotel has children's playground, helicopter, beach swimming pool, etc. The green environment is okay! The lobby is also quite large and the total floor area is quite large!
After check-out, Xiao Jin also informed about the golf bag. The overall check-in experience is not bad, five-star praise!

The hotel is located in the middle of Haitang Bay, it is very convenient to go nearby, and it is also very close to duty-free shops and food courts!

The hotel's restaurants are currently only open in Chinese restaurants, mainly Cantonese and Hainanese dishes, and the price/performance ratio is acceptable.

The swimming pool is close to the beach, and the photos are beautiful. Overall, it is cost-effective. It is different from other hotels, and it highlights the French style. In the end, I praise Xiao Jin and the guest room sister. [Strong][Strong][Strong]

To enter the hotel, you need to scan the code first, you can park next to the lobby, and the check-in is also very fast. I went to Xiaohui directly. Xiaohui talked about the activities suitable for taking children in the past two days, and gave two passports stamps.

The room is arranged on the ninth floor. We stayed for two days with a garden view and one day with a sea view. The views are good, the beach is a bit far, and we need to go through the long garden. The room is very clean, and the products are completely free of damp smell. The maintenance is very good. The child likes the prepared crib very much. It is indeed very comfortable. It is blue and looks fresh and clean.

In the next few days, I spent all the activities in the hotel, which was very good. Later, I exchanged my passport for ice cream, and the children felt very fulfilled. Activities suitable for children include: children's playground, bakery baking, sand dredging on the beach (with tools), small trains, bumper cars, go-karts, bubble wars......

The breakfast is very good. Basically, I don't think there is any difference with the Yalong Bay Ritz. It can be seen that the quality control is strict, and the chef Kevin took great care and sent small snacks to the children. We went to Atlantis to eat the buffet. After comparing, we found that the details are really far from Sofitel, and the buffet is so rough………………

I ate two meals at the Chinese restaurant, which was very good. Adam and jane had attentive service, and the price/performance ratio of the dishes was also very high.


Will continue to stay next time, btw, the hotel lawn is great! !

First of all, on the day of check-in, there was a lot of luggage, and there was no one at the door of the hotel, and no one picked up and helped with luggage.
Then I checked in and asked a few questions about the hotel. The front desk staff ignored them and said they didn't know.
After I checked in, there were big black flying insects in the room. I waited for a long time and called the staff twice to come. Then I changed the room
The room was not cleaned thoroughly, I actually saw other people's private hair in the room not cleaned!
The swimming pool is also dirty, the bodies of flying insects and fallen leaves are not cleaned up in time
I took the hotel shuttle bus, and when I wanted to leave, I told the staff that I wanted to take the bus, but no one came to drive after waiting for more than ten minutes. Later, I asked again, and a young man came slowly and said to take the car keys... …
If it wasn't for my mother's leg injury and it was inconvenient to walk, I would have checked out that day!

At first I thought no one was staying and put cold water for a while. In fact, every time It takes half a day to open the hand sanitizer every time, which is completely beyond your experience. There is no dressing mirror in the room, and the bathroom smells bad. The room is not big, the balcony is small, and there are many irregular room types and balconies. It is not like the design of a resort hotel. It is not bright and bright, which affects the mood. There are quite a lot of breakfast varieties, but the quality of Chinese food is not high, the fried dough sticks are too chewy, and the dried fruit next to the oa**eal smells stale. The feeling of service to the guests is not to send money but to owe money. There is no smiling face at the front desk. No one greets all the staff when they meet, and the whole a**osphere is cold. The garden design is very general and monotonous. The swimming pool is being renovated and the construction is noisy during the day. The package sold is said to be a French buffet, but it is actually an ambush, and there is no such thing. I am more satisfied with the Thai restaurant, the taste and service are still like a five-star hotel. The overall feeling is that the hotel management doesn't care much about the customer's experience.

We booked room 1999 and 2588. Because of the epidemic and the small number of people, the lady helped us to upgrade, arranged the rooms together, and also helped us to delay the check out ❤️
Or because of the epidemic, the hotel has very few occupancy, which gives us a feeling of a private room. Unfortunately, the buffet dinner is not open, and the breakfast is also placed in the executive lounge. Although the variety of dishes is small, we will arrange the kitchen to cook according to our preferences~
There are welcome fruits, and there are free snacks delivered to the room in the afternoon~

From the hotel to the airport, 4 large and 1 small business car is 150 to 200
It's about 30-40 to the duty-free shop

Next to the city that never sleeps, nucleic acid is being done, and it will be closed at 6 pm. 301 The nucleic acid has been canceled due to the epidemic, and only the Women's and Children's Hospital has a 24-hour mixed inspection free of charge.

Because I also saw the video and took pictures at the door when I booked it from others, I thought it was not bad, so I booked for two nights. Face, even when talking, my friend and I are very young with children, and there is no good face at all. It's not a little bit different from Yanlord Sunshine, it's really really bad. You can stay for one night and try it. Then when I entered the room that was opened for me, the sofa was super dirty, and the floor had water stains. I didn't want to change it with children and luggage, but it was too dirty. Pulled luggage and went downstairs to change rooms. Originally, it was going to be refunded, but finally we said that we had ordered it on Ctrip, and we wanted to return at Ctrip... We are really afraid of trouble and change a room with our children pulling our luggage. Then change us to a certain building that is a little far away. It doesn't matter if it's near or far. As soon as I entered the room, I was bitten by a large bag of mosquitoes, and I was in a bad mood. did not say. The next night was nothing short of...my child was so young that I really didn't sleep all night. Mosquitoes bit me with a minimum of 8 packs. After staying in so many hotels in Sanya, I really haven't been bitten before, and it's still like this. I really wanted to scold the streets all night. There is no way my child is too young to be afraid of mosquito bites. I didn't sleep all night. Watching mosquitoes with my friend was really painful that night. I never want to stay in this hotel again. I will not live for free. Writing this comment today, the tingling on my legs and body is still not good. It's really the a**osphere. In addition to being angry or angry. Angry at myself why live here. Blind and will never live again

msg:This is the first time to stay here. I have stayed in many hotels in Haitang Bay before. Sofitel just found out that it is not bad. The service is very considerate. When I arrived at the hotel guest depar**ent, Mr. Xiao kindly introduced all the hotel facilities to us. The surrounding environment is very good. intimate. The room is very big, the bed is set, and the children sleep on the upper bunk. The hotel's environmental facilities are in place and very comfortable. There are bubble activities in the water children's park every afternoon, and the children are very happy. There is also a children's heated swimming pool, although the weather is a bit cold now, it is not afraid. There are also children's playgrounds and go-karts, which are all fun and feel good in all aspects. I still recommend them.

The service of the staff is really good, especially the children, who are beautiful and caring! The arrangement for us was very good. When we first arrived, we asked questions if we didn’t understand. Thank you.

The food, accommodation, hotel facilities, hygiene and services were all special and comfortable to use. Described very appropriately. There are many activities for children to play in the hotel that can be provided for children to check in. The hotel is also very close to the beach.

msg:This time I stayed at Sofitel, and the feeling was very ups and downs; because I checked in once in 2017, the hotel should have just opened at that time, the overall feeling to me is very brand new, the last two pictures are photos from 2017, that feeling is really It is incomparable now; of course, the stay this time also has the meaning of nostalgia; when I switched from Crown to Sofitel, I felt very business here. At that time, I also booked a garden-view room with a high price-performance ratio. I thought that the garden-view room was arranged on the 3rd floor for the first night. It was not very good to be honest on the third floor. Later, after reading it carefully, I expressed my request to the housekeeper Xiaolu, hoping to be transferred to a higher floor, because the garden-view room has 2- 3; 5-11 floors; so Xiaolu specially communicated to the leaders that night, and it only took 15 minutes to solve the demands; such a high efficiency, very praise; of course, in addition, Xiaolu for us The care is also more delicate. I am very fortunate that I can meet a good housekeeper every time in a different hotel. Maybe the communication and getting along between people is a very important thing. In the service industry, everyone understands and tolerates each other. , To communicate more and think about problems from a different perspective is perhaps the best way; Sofitel is still very classic, and I hope that it can be as good as possible in the future; especially in the maintenance of facilities and equipment, I think it should be strengthened. Xiaolu is a The careful butler also hopes to grow faster, come on.

msg:For the first time, I gave a 5-star review against my will, for the job of a hotel steward. There is no question of whether this matter is right or wrong. Michelle has been in touch since the day before check-in, and understands the needs. She learned that the room will be set up early after the anniversary and given a room with a wide view. She has done a good job and has been helping to communicate and communicate solve various problems. It is also the location of this room that allows me to clearly feel the various exciting activities of the seaside wedding activities and learn how to support such activities haha. Because the sound of the activity went from 6pm to 9pm. When I went to the beach in the morning, I realized that the beach is not a public property of the hotel. There are also a bunch of ATVs at the intersection to invite guests to pay to play. The oil smell is so strong, and someone will ask you if you want to see the room. The sand on the beach is very poor. , this is the worst beach in Hainan. It is said that the occupancy rate is very high, and the housekeeper predicted the peak time. The result is like a vegetable market. It was the first time I saw such a scene since the epidemic. After eating two bites, I left immediately. Cold meats and pastries are generally not very tasty. The skin of the ready-made wontons is thicker than a quilt. Claypot rice is funny, just reheat the cooked rice and add eggs. The production of afternoon tea in the executive lounge cannot be complimented, and the desserts are slightly better. There were too many people at happyhour, and the waiter was a bit busy with bartending. The manager specially compensated me for my diligent study of the content of the wedding event hosting, and chose to dine at a restaurant in the hotel at noon. This Thai food is not bad. It's just that the quantity is more refined. The sea in this hotel is only suitable for viewing from a distance, and you must not walk past it.

The hotel service is very thoughtful. The housekeeper Angela Xiaohui was there the day before the check-in. She added WeChat to provide some help in advance. You can ask any questions during the entire stay~ Very caring
The Daisy in the lounge is very good, the service is very good~
And the room attendant on the 11th floor is very friendly!
By the way, the hotel is very beautiful, the facilities are perfect, it is clean and hygienic, and it has a private beach. The breakfast is rich in variety, and there is actually claypot rice. The chef is very enthusiastic and will remind you that fresh bread is about to be baked. Who doesn't want to eat fresh bread? ~ ~ Recommended recommended!

After I booked the room, the exclusive housekeeper Xiao Zuo personally contacted me with any needs and arrangements. When I arrived at the hotel for registration, Xiao Zuo also came over to make arrangements. Since it was the child's birthday on the day of check-in, Xiao Zuo also thoughtfully prepared a birthday cake for the child. The cake was ready as soon as he entered the room. The child was very happy. , The hotel management is attentive, and the children's activities are rich and colorful. Every detail shows the manager's intention. In the end, the child did not play enough and renewed the reservation for a day. As a result, the wrong room type was booked. It was so convenient and sweet to change rooms, I will definitely recommend it to my friends, and I will come back to Sofitel next time, perfect trip!

The selection of drinks in the pool bar is monotonous and does not create the overall a**osphere of the resort. The children's pool slide is unreasonably designed, so smooth that the child will stop halfway through the slide.

msg:A former colleague held a wedding here and thought it was good, so I stayed here and tried it when I came to Sanya this year.

The public space is actually quite easy to browse, and there are many swimming pools, so it will not be boring. The arranged room is on the 10th floor, in the middle of the hotel, so it is convenient to have breakfast and go to the garage. The depth of the room is a bit big, and the room is limited. But sitting on the balcony is quite comfortable. When checking in, a housekeeper was assigned, and the Gloria boy was quite helpful, which was highly praised.

The hotel's breakfast is generally average, the area is large, but there is no fresh orange juice, and you have to make your own coffee. I haven't tried other food and beverages. I've eaten Thai food before, so I think it's normal.

The price is generally good value for money, will come again later.

msg:🚗 Transportation: Haitang Bay hotels are relatively concentrated, about 10 minutes' drive from duty-free shops and Atlantis.

Check in: bad review! I informed in advance that I expected to arrive at the store at 2-3 o'clock, but I arrived at the store at 3:30, and I was in line at 4:00. After finishing, I told the room that the room was not cleaned up, and I needed to wait another hour. I finally entered the room at 5:30, although It is during the Spring Festival, after all, it has been open for so many years, and the inefficiency of check-in in the face of high occupancy rate is fully revealed. Sorry for the 2000+ room charge.

🧹Sanitation: The hotel's hygiene is very good, the lobby is transparent and bright, the room hygiene is also good, the room service is in place in time, and children's toiletries, children's slippers and bathrobes are prepared.

Room type: The deluxe sea view double bed is selected, and the high floor is given. The view is really good, the scenery is beautiful, and the night view is also very beautiful.

🍃Environment: The hotel environment is very beautiful, with large greenery, lawns and coconut trees, which are also well maintained. There are many swimming pools of various sizes and shapes. This one must be praised. This season, the sun can be used for swimming, which is very comfortable. The environment of the buffet restaurant and Thai restaurant is also good and worth experiencing.

Breakfast: There are so many people that it takes at least 40 minutes to queue for breakfast every day. What a waste of time! In fact, it didn't take so long. When I went in, I saw that many empty tables were not cleared out in time.

Children's entertainment: The hotel's parent-child activity is a little prince activity, and there are fewer types. When entering the store, each child gives a passport for this activity. Each time they participate in an activity, a stamp is stamped. Collect 5 stamps (free) to get an ice cream, but To collect all the chapters, you need to spend 198 to do a 15-minute kayak and water propulsion project, and then you can get a surprise gift, but the surprise gift is a towel with the logo of the little prince. Surprise? Are you surprised?

Areas that need to be improved urgently: 1. The iron main frame of the children's entertainment slide is peeled off, and the anti-rust is serious. It does not use stainless steel or other waterproof materials, which looks very dirty. The rust is serious, and the firmness is unknown whether there is a safety hazard. 2. The black iron steps are very hot under the sun, and it is easy to burn the soles of children's feet, such as falling and tetanus.

The five-year-old child has never seen a cockroach at home and came to this popular science. I waited for half an hour to check in. There were two people in front. The first one took more than 20 minutes, and the second one took nearly ten minutes. It was only when I found out that the staff asked me to scan the code on the spot to apply for an Accor membership. However, the system was not very good at that time. easy to use. At the time of check-in, the staff did not inform that the room card of the Pearl Building could not be used for the Emerald Building (the most basic obligation at the front desk). In the evening, the room card was thought to be broken. The restaurant of the hotel will distinguish between customers who buy meal coupons and those who order food. The meal coupons are served slowly, but the meal coupons are not without money! The afternoon tea juice in the lobby bar is not freshly squeezed, and the coffee is not as good as the breakfast restaurant. The dim sum is full of refrigerator flavor. Accor's Sanya Sofitel is an eye-opener. The broken coin-operated machines in the children's playground are powerless to vomit. One star must be given, otherwise negative points.

6. The hotel has a housekeeper and WeChat, which is very considerate and communicates with you as soon as you have various needs.
7. There is a nucleic acid test inside the hotel! Reservation is required one day in advance. great
8. It takes 30 minutes to go to Houhai and 20 minutes to Duty Free City, which is very convenient.
Yalong Bay Marriott where I live today, although the new style is good, but the height of the floor, the small park, and the all-season style are still weak.

msg:I generally don't comment, let's look at the pictures and speak with facts. To be honest, after staying in so many luxury hotels, Sofitel Haitang Bay really disappointed me. First of all, the housekeeper contacted me one day in advance, inquired about my needs, and told me that I needed to think about a higher floor. It was after one o'clock when I arrived at the hotel. It's almost New Year's Eve. I can understand that I will check in at three o'clock. After all, there are many guests staying at the hotel, but it turned out that it was almost seven o'clock in the evening that I could check in. We waited for nearly six hours. This is me. This is the first time I've met so many hotels. Secondly, I informed the high floor in advance, not to mention the check-in at 7 o'clock in the evening, and the result was the 5th floor. The hotel lobby is on the 3rd floor. Is the 5th floor a high floor? Checking in so late, it turned out that the needs of the housekeeper were also arranged at will. In this case, what is the point of asking the guests in advance? Secondly, you can look at the so-called luxury sea view room I photographed through the balcony, who can see the sea view? Where is the sea view? Also called luxury? Again, I booked afternoon tea in the lobby bar. When I went there, the bartender was very arrogant. I kept talking to her. She didn't look at me directly, and asked me to wait. I sat outside and looked for a clean table, but there were almost none. There were no clean tables everywhere. The floor was littered with rubbish. The table was full of water marks and unfinished food. The sofa pillows were all messed up. The most outrageous thing is that there is a leftover apple on one of the tables. There are many ants around. It can be seen that this apple has been placed here for a long time. Because the manager on duty on the first day found that I was staying late, he specially told me to express his regret by giving me a fruit plate and a Latin ticket. As a result, the fruit platter was not delivered at 2 o'clock in the afternoon the next day. I reminded the housekeeper to arrange it, and I saw it was delivered when I came back later. Overall, the housekeeper feels like an intern, but the service is quite satisfactory, and I understand her. The arrangement of the manager on duty is also good, expressing understanding and recognition. In addition, Begonia Fei Sofitel gave me a really bad feeling. There are so many luxury hotels in Haitang Bay, and I have also stayed in many hotels near you. As a luxury French hotel, it really does not match. Please ask the hotel to deal with its own problems. At present, I really can’t compare with the hotels I have stayed in near you. compared to!

The service I am most satisfied with is Sofitel Lee & Man. It is located in the middle of the major hotels in Haitang Bay. The hotel is very rich in food and entertainment. It is the first choice for parent-child hotels. We stayed in Sanya for three days on the 26th and were very satisfied. So when we left, we came back and stayed here for two days. I would like to emphasize here, One of the reasons why we have such a good experience is the butler service. Xiaohui was the contact person received by Sofitel during our stay in Sanya. He solved all my needs in the hotel and felt like family. The reason for choosing to live in Sofitel Leeman, I strongly recommend that you can consider staying here if you bring your children to play in Sanya.

msg:Taking parents and daughters on vacation, Sofitel is very good👍 Staying in the executive sea view room, the housekeeper Xiaohui, executive lounge managers Cindy, Zora and Wu Wenfei are like family, they are warm and friendly every time they meet, which adds a lot to our journey, Many thanks to them! The best thing about the hotel's breakfast is the freshly baked bread in a retro oven. People who lose weight eat several of each meal. I like the pastry chef Liu Gaofeng. The travel photos given by the hotel are also very good. The photographer Yang Yong is funny and humorous! See you next year ✌️

msg:After coming to Sanya for a long time, I struggled with the hotel choices. Each one has its pros and cons. In the end, I chose the Sofitel Lee and Man based on the reviews and the must-stay list. I booked it for one day and decided to try it out if it didn’t work. The result was unexpected. Well, the price of 1,450 for Chris**as is not low, but the price of another hotel is 2,000 to 3,000, which shows that this place is cost-effective. From the beginning of check-in, housekeeper Xiaohui was with us throughout the process, helping us check in and explaining parent-child activities, and even explained the family activities to us when we were sent to the room. I asked some things to pay attention to, and finally gave my child a set of beach toys. My child was very happy. The room facilities are also well maintained and not as shabby as the reviews said (I live in the Pearl Tower). After putting things away, I took my children to participate in parent-child activities as if they were rushing to a party. , making cookies, driving go-karts, going to the children's playground, drawing T-shirts, and riding a train. It was really rich. I came back in the evening and took a bath. It was a very happy day. I made a decisive decision at night and the housekeeper Xiaohui reminded me early the next morning. Where to eat breakfast? By the way, I was upgraded to a parent-child ocean view room when I renewed my subscription. As soon as I entered the room, my children were so happy that they flew up and stayed in the room for a long time. There are building block tables, slides, swings, building blocks, many plush toys, and children's accessories. Every detail of the bathroom is really good. Turn down at night and there are fruits. The breakfast buffet is very rich and very long. From 7:00 to 11:00, you don’t need to eat at noon if you are full. There are also many children in the swimming pool. There are also many boats that can be rented for the event. Swan🦢Walking for a while, I saw many weddings and photos. You can also take a helicopter to fly along the coastline on the central lawn (the two prices are 880-1180 kilometers different. Children are half-price). The greening is very good, but I like the fact that there are not so many bugs because I am afraid of bugs. To sum up, it is a very pleasant stay. Thank you very much for the housekeeper Xiaohui who took great care of us.

Xiao Chen left a particularly good impression on us. I have traveled to nearly 100 cities in China and lived there. There are more than 200 five-star hotels. It is the first time that I have met such a responsible cultural and travel officer. He gave me very good advice on my food, accommodation and travel. It can be said that everything is fine, from before I checked in to after I left the hotel. , has been taking care of me and my family like a friend I haven't seen in a long time. This is also the first time I have written a review with so many words. This one is the cheapest one for me to stay in Sanya, because the hotel also arranged for me before. Cultural travel officer, the service is also very good, but compared with Sofitel Xiao Chen, I can only say that there is no harm without comparison. Sofitel Michelle. Xiao Chen brought us a special trip to Sanya. The good experience also made our impression of Sofitel better. Next time we come to Sanya, we must stay at Sofitel.

The hotel’s breakfast is too delicious, the choices are particularly rich, and the platters are also beautiful 😍

You can feel the French romance and freshness everywhere, even the temperament of the waiters passing by are revealing a light mood, and the conversation and guidance are very comfortable~~ Here, I am especially grateful to Xiaohui 👍🏻 for help and guidance, for helping to upgrade the room and surroundings Introduction of the scenic area and intimate communication, thank you again ❤️ The shower gel and shampoo in the room are all from Langfan, high-quality fragrance 🌿 👠💄

There is no noisy and crowded people in other hotels here, but more of a leisurely personal world. The swimming pool is clean and beautiful, suitable for taking pictures and enjoying it, and it is also very convenient to reach the seaside. It is warm in the hotel. You can lie down for a whole day with a bath towel, and you can also horoscopes in the middle of the night✨, so beautiful~

msg:I have stayed in Haitang Bay many times, this is the first time I have stayed at Sofitel Leeman, and it is inevitable to compare it with the previous hotels.
As a hotel that combines French sophistication and Hainan style, Sofitel can take into account these two aspects, which is very characteristic among the many hotels in Haitang Bay. I wrote notes and shared my feelings...

🚗 Transportation: The geographical location is in the first line. Of course, this is a passing standard for a five-star hotel in Haitang Bay.
🧹Sanitation: The sanitation environment is very good, and the rooms, swimming pools and restaurants are excellent. The problem is the lobby bar, the external environment needs to be improved urgently.
🍃Environment: The overall environment of the hotel is very good, with green plants and swimming pools in place. As a parent-child hotel, there are enough amu*****t items for children.
🔔Service: The service is not mentioned, thanks Xiaojin Joly. He is very attentive to our care and helps us solve problems in time, praise!

As a French-style parent-child hotel, Sofitel Leeman has excellent hardware and software. Two small problems in my personal feelings: ① Helicopter is a feature of the hotel, but for the guests, the noise is too high, and guests who like quiet should be cautious, or put forward personal requirements when choosing a room. ②The taste of afternoon tea can continue to be improved, and the waiter can introduce the name of the dessert and its supporting usage, otherwise, it will be a bit confusing for the guests.

Transportation: There is a shuttle bus from the airport to various hotels in Haitang Bay. The hotel provides a bus to the duty-free shop to reserve one day in advance.
Hygiene: Five-star praise, I like the hardware facilities of Sofitel, fashionable and design, attention to detail, and shiny everywhere.
Environment: The garden is simple and a**ospheric, and the sea view may not be as beautiful as Yalong Bay, but it is also very good.
Food: The breakfast is very rich, and the horn is the signature French hotel brand. The Mala Fragrant Pot I ordered at the Hainan restaurant for dinner is big and tastes great. There are abalone, shrimp, squid, various vegetables and mushrooms in it. Because I waited for a while, I also gave peach gum.
Service: Very good, the housekeeper will take the initiative to ask the needs, and the room staff will also take the initiative to say hello. The waiter in the Chinese restaurant has a very good attitude because the service was a bit slow and I apologized many times and also sent sweet soup with small dishes.

The hotel facilities are very new, the rooms are soft tones, brightly lit, and the lobby is very modern. The entire hotel occupies a large area with multiple swimming pools. It’s a little distance from the room to the beach, but all the way there are various swimming pools, helipads, and a large area of lawn, which is very pleasant.

The package includes dessert making experience. I made eclaire under the guidance of the teacher and it was successful.

Generally speaking, I am very satisfied, with good facilities, few people, good service, and complete parent-child facilities. Haitang Bay has fine sand, but the waves are so big that you must not swim in the sea and you need to pay attention to safety.

What is speechless is that there is no air conditioner in the elevator... outrageous. The mattress is relatively soft, because my husband's waist is not good, so I called the service depar**ent to take care of a hard mattress. The phone said that I would change it immediately, but I didn't come after two hours. At 11 o'clock, the children were too sleepy. , I called and said that the person would not be able to exchange it. The person who answered the phone replied with the word "Oh" and hung up the phone. At that moment, I understood why the attitude service was not good.

1: The check-in time was very late at 3:00 pm, but we arrived at 3:30 and couldn't check in, so we waited abruptly until 4:00.
2: Wearing a bathrobe to the restaurant in the morning stopped me. OK, I can understand that if I don’t wear a bathrobe, it will get dirty. I repeatedly explained that I would take it off after eating, but I just went to the beach after breakfast and wore a swimsuit, which was inconvenient, so Approve the bathrobe, is that okay too? And tell me you can't wear it in public? So what is the point of a resort hotel? And what's up with people wearing bathrobes everywhere in the hotel? Is it double standard on me? Not only that, but also sent staff to come to me again and again, why am I in jail when I stay in your hotel? Constantly being watched over?
3: There are a lot of mosquitoes in the restaurant. During breakfast, my baby and I were bitten by 4 large bags. The sanitary environment is extremely poor. See Fig.
4: The service of the battery car is also very poor. The driver told us to call the front desk to call a car, and reported the car call number to us, but after we called, the other party asked us to go to the concierge to call a car? ? ? ? ? Are you kidding me? And after calling, it is also very slow, it is better to walk by yourself, unlike other hotels on call.
5: The breakfast was the worst of the three hotels I stayed in during New Year's Day.
Above, will never live in Sofitel again. There is nothing that makes you feel happy on vacation! ! ! ! Sofitel, you don't deserve 5 stars! !

msg:I haven't stayed at any other Sofitel, this one is very chaotic, there are many 5-star hotels along Haitang Bay, I don't think I would recommend any other friends to stay, especially during peak seasons such as holidays and Spring Festival.
1. A total of three luxury sea view rooms have been booked. In fact, two of them have to lean out of the railing to see the sea.
Obviously it's a garden view room. There was a dispute at the front desk in the lobby, and the manager on duty insisted that the room was full (then this behavior means that the room type was oversold), and proposed to make up for it with a buffet dinner coupon. To be honest, why would you come to Haitang Bay to live in Haitang Bay if it wasn't for the view of the sea in a sea view room? Where is there no five-star hotel? In the end, the double room was replaced with a standard room on another floor. On the reservation page of Ctrip's website, in addition to showing different floors, all the photos of sea view rooms with different price points are facing the sea, which is still the same today when the review was issued. However, please refer to attached picture 1 for the actual situation.
Second, the cleaning is not thorough
After changing rooms and going out, the front desk called whether the mask left in the previous room should be sent to the new room. However, in the previous room, we did not open any luggage, only the items left by the guests who did not clean the previous night.
3. There are long queues outside the breakfast room, a large number of empty tables in the restaurant are untidy, and there are not enough service staff.
4. Gift travel photography service, but there is no schedule to make an appoin**ent when you arrive at the store. It's better not to send it.
Five, hotel management chaos. The front desk does not know whether to check out or not, but I still have to call the customer to ask
Before leaving, the housekeeper offered to ask whether a late check-out was required, indicating that the delay of the member displayed on Ctrip's reservation until two o'clock had nothing to do with the hotel, and the late check-out was a gift from the hotel. There were three rooms in total, and I had a late check out for two of them. As a result, after leaving the store, the front desk called me 2 times in succession. The first call asked why the check-out time had not come down yet. I said you should check the order again, and you should have noted the late check-out. After a few minutes, the second phone call came again, "Have your friends checked out? I can't find it here." It's the first time I've seen such an operation.
In the end, the housekeeper even asked me on WeChat if I could not comment on this trip on the Ctrip website, and reminded me that the comments I sent were visible to the hotel. I think evaluation should be the right of every customer. I think Sofitel Sanya Leeman is not well prepared to receive such a large number of tourists during the holidays, and the chaotic management and service will damage its image. There are more than a dozen five-star sea-view hotels along the coastline of Haitang Bay, and the hotel should attract attention. Hope you can do better.

msg:The hotel on Haitang Bay has been looking at this Sofitel for a long time, because there are many French elements in the hotel, Tiffany Blue and the beautiful Parisian Tower afternoon tea.
🚗 Transportation: A taxi is more suitable than renting a car, and it is not far from the duty-free shop.

🧹Hygienic: Very clean and fresh feeling.

🍃Environment: The entire hotel has a strong French vacation style. The hotel has a beautiful private beach. The breakfast is also pretty good.

🔔Service: Before check-in, the housekeeper Xiaolu called ☎️I have added WeChat. From check-in to check-out, Xiaolu's service is very considerate. Unfortunately, because of the New Year's Day holiday did not enjoy late check-out. But the welcome fruit in the hotel is still very good and the value is very good.

msg:Because it happened to be New Year's Day, Sanya Hotel was very difficult to book, and I didn’t want to move the hotel every day, so I found this Sofitel and booked a luxury sea-view room. Yes, WeChat serves us throughout the whole process. If we don’t understand or are not satisfied, we will try our best to solve them, but after all, the hotel’s location and hardware can’t be blamed. The location is not particularly good. It is very far away from the duty-free shop, and it is also very far away from the seafood street. Far away, every time I drive back to the hotel, I still need to go in a big circle in front, and then don’t live in the hotel! ! ! It’s really inconvenient to get takeout and get in and out. It’s so far away, and the viewing angle is not very good. Try to choose the Emerald Building and the Pearl Building. This hotel does not matter if you order a presidential suite. If you order a sea view, it is recommended that you order it. The pool room is better. The hotel’s garden is not very distinctive. It’s ordinary. The parking lot is relatively small, but it also has advantages. The small parking lot is easy to enter and exit, and there are three charging places. It is very good and very user-friendly. To provide toiletries, you need to get them at the front desk, saying that the government is environmentally friendly? But these days I have stayed in the three five-star hotels next door, and they are all provided in the room. I am not sure if the hotel does not provide it or the government does not agree to provide it.

As soon as I entered the lobby, I felt elegant and comfortable, and the waiter's comfortable greetings and care, especially thanks to 👍 Xiaohui 👍 for her care and introduction of hotel services and introductions Surrounding activities, communication is careful and comfortable.

If you want this trip to be completely relaxing, Sofitel is highly recommended, it will not be crowded and noisy like other hotels.

In addition, the hotel's swimming pool is very clean and elegant, and it is extremely convenient to go to the beach. Wrapped in the hotel's warm bath towels, you can listen to the sea all day long.
And the hotel staff are very responsible, from carrying luggage, cleaning, warning to the sea, etc., thank them very much, and carefully prepared a special sea fireworks New Year's Eve party, which is very unforgettable.

msg:First of all, it's a really good hotel brand. I don't know why the front desk is still very troublesome and slow to check in and check out. Before check-in, the hotel staff contacted and guided customers to the store. I always felt that it was a good review or this kind of business method, which was a bit unnecessary.
The facilities of the hotel room are also a bit old, the TV is very difficult to use, and the sliding door of the bathroom has not been closed. The reason for choosing this hotel is also because it is in Haitang Bay and the price is right. but! When we were resting at night, someone kept talking at the door at one o'clock in the middle of the night. I really didn't understand. I heard the hotel staff negotiating for a long time, but the noise continued for more than an hour. Can the most basic hotel rest and quiet environment be guaranteed? So I think with so many choices, it's better to choose a slightly more expensive one, but at least you won't regret or add to the journey because of the old facilities and the unquiet environment. We didn't negotiate with the service desk, it was really late, and it was a waste of energy to get up to call, so I won't choose this place again in the future.

However, during the check-in process, I was not satisfied with the hygiene of the hotel room and the hygiene of the children's swimming pool. I originally booked the hotel for the large slide in the children's swimming pool, but the water in the children's swimming pool is really speechless. Nine large bags were bitten by unknown insects. All in all, the hotel hygiene is really unsatisfactory.
However, the products of the two restaurants in the hotel are still very good, especially the Thai restaurant is still highly recommended, and the service is also very good.

msg:The overall experience is better, with very standard luxury hotel services. The housekeeper Xiaolu contacted me one day in advance and asked about my preferences, which was very good. He also gave two karting coupons. The young lady from Yichang, Zora in the lounge is very enthusiastic, as expected to be our Hubei nine-headed bird, she must give me a big praise, and Leo specially prepared a cocktail for me, it is delicious and the alcohol level is good, great, Jessica and Fanny The service is also great. However, one of the dishes delivered to the meal is called Kiev fried chicken. It is a bit embarrassing to not cut with a knife. I chose this Sofitel because I saw that L’Occitane was used for the spare parts. I wanted a set of L’Occitane washes. The process was too arduous. Since I booked a basic room type and couldn’t deliver it, I paid to upgrade to a suite. After the upgrade, I was told that there was only one set per day, so small, enough for two people. This process is for me anyway. It feels a bit bad. There are also many types of breakfast, but it is not convenient to take meals too scattered among the dining tables. Moreover, there is no mandatory requirement to wear a mask when taking meals. During the epidemic, I think it would be better to wear a mask to take meals. To sum up, the overall experience is very good, but the details still need to be strengthened.

🚗 Transportation: The central location of Haitang Bay, a five-minute drive from the duty-free center, and the Haitang Food Plaza and Wanda IMAX Cinema next to it. Of course, the most convenient is the several Internet celebrity restaurants in the Wanda Doubletree Hotel!

🔔Service: Because it was the same day reservation, so after arriving in the lobby, Xiao Xiao from the Guest Relations Depar**ent was in the lobby and became my butler with the flow. Welcome fruits and snacks were arranged. Although there is no sea view room, but The high-quality service and detailed handling make me feel happier than living in a sea-view room.

🍃Environment: The hotel is a typical parent-child hotel. The hotel is full of places for human cubs to play and have fun, especially the kart club and dessert house. Adults can rest assured that they can have a perfect vacation for their little friends and children can learn about the world. At the same time, parents can also get to know their children...

🧹Hygienic: The bathroom products in the room are made of Paris LANVIN, and the shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner are all in large bottles. There is no need to call room service to send the accessories. The only shortcoming is that there is no turn-down service. I especially like TV. Open Sofitel’s exclusive music "Live The French Way"...

French style permeates every trace of air and detail 🏖

msg:One sentence comment: the ultimate details, the ceiling of the industry.

🍃Environment: An excellent resort hotel often needs to be done in details, especially in some inconspicuous places. Sofitel is like that. Although Sanya is very cold in winter and few people swim, the courtyard and swimming pool are meticulously maintained. Every morning, when the weather is bright, we start to focus on trimming. What passengers get up and see is always a well-maintained location. Attentive.


🔔Service: The service must be taken out separately and boasted. Let me talk about the hardware first: The interior design of an excellent hotel is not just the accumulation of big-name hair dryers, but also the details of "not making money". Yes, I'm talking about making a leather case for the refrigerator cabinet. This costly and easily overlooked detail, Sofitel did it stubbornly. like.

In addition, we focus on praising our housekeeper Phoebe Xiaoyu, who perfectly interprets the service level of "relaxation and relaxation". Answer all questions, warm-heartedly and flexibly to enhance the customer experience; neither cold nor licking, directly widening the gap with some Internet celebrity hotels in Haitang Bay.

Finally, praise Sofitel for his dining. The French's obsession with baking makes Sofitel's breakfast bread give full marks. I also recommend the egg rolls: freshly made, with fresh ingredients, and the chef used a more laborious but more fragrant French method. It's another triumph in details, like it!

The butler, Xiao Zhang, who I received before, is no longer working, but he is very responsible. He contacted the new butler, Joly, Xiaojin. He received me as soon as I checked in, arranged all my luggage, and introduced them one by one. Hotel restaurant, swimming pool, go kart! The introduction was quick and clear, anyway, if there is anything you don’t understand, you can contact her directly 🉑haha😃;
Location: In the middle of the hotel in Haitang Bay, it is very convenient to go to Houhai and Wuzhizhou Island or duty-free shops. I feel that Houhai is more suitable. There are snacks, some dregs and vinegar, shrimp cakes are delicious 😋 I recommend it! There is also a big octopus ball [smiley face] Facilities: I heard that the hotel was built in 16 years, the facilities in the room are quite new, the Bialong Bay Hotel is much newer, the hotel lobby is warm in color, the first feeling is very comfortable, and there are drinks Lemonade, it seems to be made of kumquat and mint leaves, very appetizing!
Service: Nothing to say, praise Xiaojin, she is good-looking and very enthusiastic, and arrangements are in place. She should have learned from her as a role model [强][强][强] Next time you come back, you can arrange it directly with her. There is also Miss Zheng Yuandan in the guest room, who took the initiative to ask if there are supplies that need to be filled. She has a deep memory, and the leader should also praise and praise the young lady [转圈][跳跳][转圈][跳跳]
Restaurant: I tried Chinese food and Thai food this time. I like the Thai food. Tom Yum Goong soup is very suitable for my appetite. It’s okay for two people to eat just over 200 per capita. There are more choices of Chinese food taste, and the service is very good. I stay in a hotel. Time to try
Generally speaking, compared with Haitang Bay, it is very cost-effective. It is worth traveling with family and friends and girlfriends. Unfortunately, the weather is a bit cold and I don’t want to go to the swimming pool.

msg:This is the second time staying this year. Compared with staying for one night last year, many things are too late to experience and many problems have been found this year.
The housekeeper added WeChat one day in advance and told him to check in after 3pm. I stayed in the last hotel for a long time that day, or I asked the butler myself, is there a room? Make sure you just ran away.
First of all, the front desk for check-in, I made it clear that it should be in the same location as last year, with a higher floor and a center. Still give it to the corner. As soon as I stepped into the room and saw the building just a few steps to the left, I discussed a change with the housekeeper. The new one is a bit more centered, but two floors lower. The butler also said that there is no other suitable... Before, clearly talking to the butler about the requirements for the room type was nothing. Compared with the previous two, the butler's ability really needs to be improved.
The room size is what attracted me to stay for the second time, and the price/performance ratio is really high. The breakfast included is also sent to the executive lounge. But the executive lounge is really average.
I took the free train twice and played a round in the children's amu*****t park. No other parents and children participated, so I couldn't put my beak.
The hotel’s breakfast is on the first floor. During the stay in Sanya, the temperature dropped. When I went for breakfast in the morning, the aisle was really cold, so I was very impressed.
There are many swimming pools in the hotel and there are not many people, but the temperature in December is too cold, the water is very cold, there is a small constant temperature, because of fear of cold, there is no water. Did not participate in the afternoon bubble show.
Hotel gardening is OK, coconut grove grassland. But there are also exposed loess in some places.
As far as the staff is concerned, there is still a bit of a gap compared to the previous two who stayed in the hotel...

msg:The environment is very good, very quiet, without the hustle and bustle of the city, suitable for vacation, not suitable for playing

The room is very large, and all aspects of hygiene are quite clean


The service is good, there are fruit plates and desserts, the ladies at the front desk are very gentle

The transportation is convenient and the travel is by taxi. Generally it is very fast. There are international duty-free cities nearby, as well as Haichang Everbright City and Linwang Night Market, but there is nothing to do. It is recommended that the holiday is in the hotel. For many projects, you have to pay

The breakfast is very rich, all kinds are available

Summary: Suitable for a quiet holiday

msg:I used to stay in Marriott hotels or individual hotels, and rarely stayed in hotels under AccorHotels. But after living in Sofitel Shenyang Lido and Sofitel Guiyang Hunter, I was really surprised by the choice of Sofitel Sanya Leeman this time.

Service: Thank you again for the meticulous service of the guest relationship Xiaojin, who took the initiative to call in advance to ask about travel needs, as well as the reception in the lobby ci and the guidance of the guest room. The room layout is really warm, although Sanya trip nucleic acid does more, but This kind of service is really warm~

Guest room: The hotel is almost 6-10 minutes away from the sea. This time I stayed in a luxurious sea-view suite, one bedroom and one living room is about 113 square meters. You can rest on small lounge chairs and collapses (and the weather in Sanya is really comfortable!!!) For a small hotel who likes to collect accessories, this suite uses L’Occitane, and I still like the smell of verbena of! (Basic room still uses Langfan) ~The response speed of room service is still relatively fast~

Food: Breakfast and executive lounge are reserved this time. The breakfast really exceeded expectations. Although the people are relatively axis, it is very orderly and will not be messy. There are categories you can think of! Be sure to try the Xialingshui sour powder and the pickled fruits opposite the bread stall (very magical)! ! ! But there is a saying that the types of fruits are not very rich! The lounge will have small snacks in the afternoon, and there will be hot food from five o'clock, but the hotel has its own customized cocktails, which are good (the key is that the service is really good)~

Swimming pool: Why do you want to take this out separately? There are so many swimming pools in their house. If you bring children, you can play in the water (I also flopped twice)

The environment is beautiful, the service is in place, and the hardware facilities are complete. Afternoon tea and happy hour surprised us. Not only the food is delicious, but the daisy service in the executive lounge is very attentive and smiling. Very sincere.

msg:First of all, let’s talk about the hotel’s service. I have seen many comments saying that the service is not good. I personally think that the service is still very good. A few days before check-in, the housekeeper Xiaoyu contacted WeChat to confirm check-in matters in advance, which was very considerate. After arriving at the hotel, I accompanied him from check-in to the room. The attitude was very good. Every hotel employee will greet politely. The most touching thing is that the car was parked in the ba*****t. The security guard wiped the glass, which is very heartwarming!
Besides the hardware, it is good, the hotel is large, the sea view is also pretty good, the air conditioner is basically silent, and the sleeping is very comfortable!
Meals, because of the executive sea view room, there are afternoon tea in the executive lounge in the afternoon and cocktails in the evening. The variety is okay. After these two meals, there is basically no need to go out to eat, and there are quite a lot of breakfast varieties.
Very nice hotel, I will continue to stay in Sanya next time!

msg:👏It’s great. This time at Sanya Sofitel changed my previous wrong observation! As soon as I checked in at the front desk of the lobby, I received a warm welcome from the concierge Michelle Chen. When she spoke fluent French to my husband and children, they all felt very cordial and felt like they were back in France! Michelle took great care of us from the moment we got off the bus and took our luggage to check in. Since we are Accor members, she also helped my two children upgrade to the same executive floor ocean view room as us. This was a very thoughtful move! After registering in the lobby, he introduced the entire hotel's equipment and activities. He accompanied us all the way to the room and carefully inspected both rooms. Thank you for your attentiveness! In addition, Moli, the manager of Hosusekeeing, learned that my husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and specially arranged a big surprise for us🥰When we returned to the room at night, special decorations and gifts were prepared on the bed and table. We were so touched as a couple. It was like a honeymoon and I will never forget this kind of thoughtfulness in my life❤️ I happened to meet the French manager Pierre on the executive floor and took the initiative to greet us. Then he chatted and laughed with my French gentleman, just like old friends. We felt like we were back in France. ! Overall, the renovated room was impeccable and we enjoyed a sumptuous six-star breakfast with many varieties that exceeded our expectations! We were so comfortable that we originally wanted to stay longer.
It's late but since the upcoming itinerary cannot be changed at short notice, we now want to change our plan to go skiing in the north during Chris**as and New Year and change it to Sofitel to enjoy this 6-star service and holiday🥰Thank you again Michelle, Moli, Pierre, we will be there soon Goodbye~

In particular, this staff is very impressive in their enthusiasm and initiative, and runs through the entire process from check-in. From the time before check-in, the housekeeper Xiao Zuo, who called us in advance and helped to arrange early check-in, went to the executive lounge Cindy, Leo, etc., all kind and active, and it felt like a spring breeze. Especially the western chef Eric, knowing that I love their breakfast butterfly cake, specially arranged for Jim to send the kitchen Jim to the executive lounge the next day, which was touching. By the way, Amway's butterfly pastry has a first-class taste and is not so sweet with reduced sugar. Personally, I feel that it surpasses those few Internet celebrity brands in Shanghai. It's a pity that it's too crisp to carry and can only be tasted at the hotel.

The location of the hotel is really close to the 68 square and the duty-free city. There are discounts when you stay in the duty-free city. ^_^ I also experienced riding a small yellow car to play, and the scenery along the way is also intoxicating
What I want to mention most is 1. The hotel breakfast is rich. Everyone who comes to Hainan must try it at the hotel breakfast. It is delicious. . 2. I really really like the hotel bed. It’s really comfortable to sleep on with moderate softness. I saw that the hotel’s bed was designed by a French designer. This is really awesome 👍 A comfortable bed can make a day’s tiredness a lot more comfortable
And the service of Xiaojin at the front desk of the hotel is also very good, the person is very gentle, helped me deal with many problems, thank her so much, really beautiful and good service

msg:Stay 10/7-9 for the last two days of the trip!
Second brush of the hotel!
Staying here for the first time on Labor Day in May is attractive to the high cost performance!
1⃣️The dining is remarkable! Desserts, ice cream, noodle stalls, hot dishes and cold dishes, fruits, cheese nuts, drinks, salads are all 🉑️
Very rich!
❗️The all-day dining restaurant is also the breakfast restaurant and dinner 299, right? The dishes are also quite rich!
right
❗️The Chinese restaurant and the chef's heart tastes very good! The style of the dishes is also very novel. Went twice! Is the service, high or low, the lunch service on the day of check-out is rigid and not friendly enough, is the bar supervisor? The service of tall boys is really uncomfortable🤣
❗️Thai food! I didn't forget the last time I went to eat, but it wasn't unpalatable this time, and it was okay. But if you change the chef, the taste is obviously different!
2⃣️Room! Clean and relatively new facilities!
Although the hair dryer is not a big brand!
The cleaning sister also helped us to make 🦀️, 5⃣️ year-old kids ecstatic!
❗️The toilet smelled a lot of smoke on the day of check-in, but only the toilet. I was so tired thinking that I didn't want to change it. I brought the aromatherapy to me, but the smell did not disappear after I left! Don't understand why! Remember to stay in a non-smoking room (with baby)
3⃣️The swimming pool and a small beach🏖️ are very cute. The swimming ring can be used at will, and some other hotels need to be rented!
4⃣️Service! Not bad! Butler Xiaoyu was also very enthusiastic and said that he would give away a piece of fruit and desserts, but the service depar**ent really couldn't keep up. We slept more than 21:30 and woke me up to send fruit! Hahaha! We didn't eat a bite after we got married! Because it's hard to eat in the room!
In the next two days there will be almost no one, it seems to be a swimming pool! 🤪
Because of the rain, I didn’t play in the pool much!
Fortunately, there are plenty of children's activities, karting bumper cars, clown activities, as long as it is a children's playground, you can play for a long time!
5⃣️It’s still a long time in the month. This time, it’s completely upgraded and renovated, and it feels very good!
❗️In general, it is a very cost-effective hotel that is worth staying at!
I recommend staying again!

Because I ordered a set meal on Ctrip, there was no seafood buffet in the evening, and I was given a voucher of 600 yuan for dinner. Later, I was given an administrative afternoon tea.
The hotel has a main swimming pool and a beach swimming pool. During the stay, the main swimming pool has been under maintenance, so I can't go. The beach swimming pool is very popular, and swimming rings are provided for free, so you have a good time playing in the water. There are also various hammocks and lounge chairs, which are very suitable for lying down.
In addition, the honeymoon room layout is also provided, the hotel baths are all lanvin, and the breakfast buffet is also very good.
Except that the weather is not very good, it rains from time to time, the overall stay experience is good, recommended!

After adding WeChat to facilitate contact, it was very considerate; the check-in at the front desk was very good. Hurry, the luggage will be delivered to the room soon. The sea view suite recommended by the housekeeper Xiaojin, one bedroom, one living room, double balcony, double bathroom and double cloakroom, facing the sea, the sea view is very beautiful and comfortable; the room is cleaned very clean, there is no peculiar smell, and the bed is also More comfortable.

The swimming pool by the sea is especially recommended. The hotel has travel shooting services and helicopter experience. The breakfast room has a large area and is not crowded with many people. There are many types of meals. The tastes are both north, south, and west. There are our favorite noodles in the north, pancakes, rice noodles with Hainan characteristics, as well as freshly squeezed fruit juices and vegetable juices. The hotel’s parent-child activities are also good. Just watch the time and place and go directly to participate. The children’s playground is a newly-changed facility. I especially like their play house; there is also a little prince passport for the children when they check in to complete the project. Delicious ice cream will be given away, and the children are full of sense of accomplishment and have a great time. The snacks in the executive lounge are delicious and the service is very good. Here we have to praise the younger brother in the lounge, because we brought the children, and we were afraid of making others, we found an outdoor location, and the younger brother helped us get things and fetch Meals, drinks, and cutlery are delivered, very patient and attentive.

msg:This trip is a temporary start. The hotel booked that morning, I saw it on Ctrip for a long time. I chose the Sofitel Sanya Leeman Resort and booked a luxurious sea view room. Because I prefer swimming, I went to the hotel. Jay recommended the pool room. I also hand-painted a map of the layout of the room, which is really sweet. The price difference was added at the front desk, and the guy at the front desk also gave me a discount, which is relatively cost-effective. After check-in, guest relations director Xiaojin joly escorted to the room, and introduced the hotel along the way. It feels that the hotel is very large, and many of them can't be introduced at once. However, as an exclusive butler, Xiaojin is responsible for all matters during my stay. Anyone who does not understand during the stay can find her, which is very convenient. My various requests these days, Xiaojin will inform the housekeeping depar**ent or the restaurant to help me as soon as possible. It’s pretty good 👍🏻
First of all, let’s talk about the hotel’s environment. The lobby is large and ventilated, with a French-style tone. The location is in the middle of Haitang Bay. It is very convenient to go nearby. The opposite of the sea is Wuzhizhou Island. The weather is good these days, and the mood is as blue as the color of the sea. It is relaxed, open and comfortable. It only needs to walk straight to the beach. For 5-6 minutes, joly suggested that I go there in the afternoon, because the sand on the beach is very hot during the day and it is easy to burn [Heart]
The hotel is really big, and it feels like you will get lost if you are not careful. There are parent-child activities for children, and the family activity center is one of the choices for bringing children on vacation. There are also spa, karting, helicopter 🚁 experience, but unfortunately I am too lazy. I spend more time in the pool in the room and I have no experience. Next time I bring children to play, I must go to experience it. As for the central lawn, the photos are beautiful. I heard Xiaojin said that you can also make an appoin**ent for travel shooting, which is not bad.
When checking in, the brother at the front desk asked if he wanted to go to the duty-free shop. The hotel was very close in the past, and the discount of the duty-free shop can be applied for on the public account in advance, inform the hotel in advance, and help me handle and book the pick-up and drop-off car. The service feels very good. I had dinner at the hotel’s Thai restaurant on the first night of stay. The curry and crab were amazing. I wanted to drink the whole soup. It was a plate-like taste. It is necessary to praise the buffet breakfast, which is quite rich. The flavors are all great 👍🏻 The key restaurant service is completely proactive and very caring!
Finally, let’s talk about Xiaojin joly’s attitude, service and help. I have really given a lot of help these days and deserves praise. I hope that the hotel will develop more such staff 😜😜
In short, the overall experience of this hotel is very good, and I am willing to share it for your reference. And I ordered it by myself, next time I can rest assured to bring the children back to stay 😏

I encountered a typhoon during my stay, and the wind blew off a large iron flagpole on the swimming pool’s spinning slide. This was too scary. At that time, there were many people playing in the pool, but fortunately, no one was hit. It took 5 or 6 minutes for the staff to deal with it. A lot of black water flows directly into the pool. I don’t know if the pool water will be processed. I just happened to ran into the staff dealing with the flagpole. He and I I said not to play on the slide for the time being, but after this happened, there was no warning sign on the slide, and there were people playing in the past, which felt a little dangerous.

In addition to the decoration and environment, Sofitel's quality service is also first-class. Every day, we will receive good morning greetings and inquiries from the housekeeper Xiao Xiao. I am very grateful to Xiao Xiao for his meticulous care and greatest help during my stay. After 3 days of pleasant holiday.
Finally, I especially recommend the hotel’s travel photography for everyone. Usually, the expectations for the hotel travel photography are not too high. In most cases, the photographer just finishes the filming. But this time I was fortunate enough to meet Yang Yong, a very professional photographer. Because I was not sure of the style of the photo I wanted, I didn't communicate and discuss the shooting plan with the photographer before shooting, so I just let him play freely. An excellent photographer will capture the most beautiful angle of the model based on its uniqueness, appearance and personality, and shoot in the most natural and relaxed state. In photography, Brother Yong adopted different communication methods, through body language, demonstration of gestures, and expression of ideas, so that I quickly realized the creative intention he wanted to express in the photos, formed a good tacit understanding with the photographer, and quickly entered the state. , I was very surprised by the effect of the film, and it can be said to be the biggest gain in this trip.

When there are more people, we may upgrade to a suite for free. Next time you come to Sanya, you should choose this one. It’s nice that there is a private pool in the room where you can see the beach

Mom likes the environment of this hotel, because this hotel is in love with Haitang Bay 😄The service is also good. When I came, the housekeeper Zuo Xin upgraded the room. The important thing is that there is a 5% discount to the duty-free shop~ the only one The downside is that the bus time to the duty-free shop should be more flexible. Generally speaking, I am very satisfied😘

msg:A great hotel, a great experience. It is especially child-friendly. First, give the child a passport of the little prince. There are more than 3 time periods for children to participate in every day, and ice cream can be exchanged for 5 chapters.
The room is large, the sea view room has a good view, the hotel’s greenery is very comfortable, 3 different outdoor swimming pools to meet different needs, and it takes only a few minutes to walk to the beach🌺
The one who needs to appreciate in particular here is the butler Michelle
Contact us one day in advance to give the hotel basic information and play suggestions. When you check in, you will take the initiative to deliver welcome drink, and the room will be delivered with welcome fruit and candy, etc. This time we are staying for 4 nights, and Michelle will take the initiative to contact you every morning. Whatever we need help, as long as we raise the problem, butler Michelle can solve it well, including the Guangzhou epidemic prevention policy that was temporarily promulgated on the 8th, Michelle can guide us to the nearest hospital for nucleic acid testing. The last day is because we are late. On the plane, with the children, Michelle also took the initiative to send us afternoon tea in the executive lounge, so that the children can have a comfortable resting place, which is great!
Again, praise the hotel's environment, butler Michelle and other staff's service 👍

🚗 Transportation: It is very convenient to call a taxi. It is recommended to use the taxi function of Baidu Maps, multi-platform selection, no need to download the app

🧹Hygienic: very clean and fast service

🍃Environment: great greenery, great swimming pool, great children's facilities

msg:This time I planned to go to Sanya to relax during the National Day. I saw Sofitel under Accor on Ctrip. After comparing several hotels of the same level, I chose to stay. I must say, I really didn't let me down!
The overall environment of the hotel: The greening of the entire hotel is very good. There are several swimming pools. There is no need to worry about getting together. The hotel is also equipped with a helicopter lawn, you can rent a helicopter to tour around Haitang Bay, and take a walk after dinner. Can exceed 10,000.
Hotel room environment: Upon check-in, after communicating my needs with the service butler "Joly" and the brother "Gordon" at the front desk, the two arranged for me as much as possible a room with a super-positive sea view (picture 1 is) The room is about 60 square meters. The bathroom and shower are separated from wet and dry. The bathtub has a large space and the bath is very comfortable and relaxing.
Finally, the overall service of the hotel: from entering the lobby to check in, the front desk brother "Gordon" greeted me warmly and quickly and quickly checked in for me. After checking in, the service butler "Joly Xiaojin" took the initiative to take me I went to the room and introduced the hotel related play content and breakfast service time, etc. I really felt their enthusiasm and the service was very professional. Next time I visit Sanya again, I would like to choose "Acor Sofitel".

However, it is very easy to order online and deliver food to the hotel lobby. Overall, this is a very good stay.

The only downside is no I know what happened at night, the shower room is leaking, I hope the hotel will check to see what the reason is. The butler Xiaojin contacted you two days in advance, and he has a very good attitude, and will solve all kinds of problems for you very thoughtfully. It is still worth recommending, that is, the holiday price is too expensive, everything else is good, and the breakfast is quite generous.

msg:🚗 Transportation: I took a taxi directly from the airport to the hotel. It was very fast on the highway. I arrived at the hotel in less than an hour.

🔔Service: When we arrived at the hotel for check-in, because with the two children, Xiao Chen immediately came over to get balloons for the children, chat with them, and then sent us to the room, sent us the activity time, map and other help, the service is special Okay, next time I hope I can meet Xiao Chen's housekeeper again!
🧹 Hygiene: Auntie who is engaged in hygiene will come to tidy up once every morning and evening. Seeing that we have children, we will put a few more bottles of water every day, as well as children's bath shampoo. The towels were also replaced with new ones, and the beds were made.
🍃Environment: Super Love Li Wensuo, big lawn big swimming pool, tropical garden landscape, it is very comfortable to look at. Moreover, the facilities and environmental maintenance are relatively new.
        This time I booked a poolside suite. The room is very large, with high floors, and very comfortable, but this building is a bit far away from the lobby. Every time I go back to the room, I have to walk a lot with my children. The elevator goes up and down to the restaurant on the second floor. A lap, a little troublesome, but the pool room feels great. You can consider the pros and cons: the pool room can jump into the pool when you get up, but it is far from the lobby restaurant. You can see the sea view in the main building, but you must go to the swimming pool and swim with everyone.

         Disadvantages: The only shortcoming is that when you go to the beach and go back to your room, you have to wait for a while when you call the tour bus. There are obviously three cars, but I feel that there is not enough staff. I often call for a bus and wait for a while.
Overall it feels great! Next time I will come to Sofitel Lee & Man to stay!

The hotel is relatively quiet. Unlike the hotels in Yalong Bay, there are too many people. The swimming pool is quite good. There are more pools nearby. The shallow water is suitable for children. The water in the distance is deeper and suitable for adults to play.
The entire Haitang Bay hotels are relatively high-end, and the hotel also has a dedicated butler one-to-one service. If you have any requirements, you can ask the butler. The butler who received us was named Xiao Xiao, an enthusiastic young lady from Taiwan, who also gave us a plate of fruits, praise 👍.
The room has a big bathtub, the schedule is too tight to experience. Book a balcony with a balcony where you can dry your clothes, because in Sanya you have to go into the water often. But one thing I don’t quite understand is that there is no exhaust in the bathroom. . .

msg:Been to Haitang Bay many times, staying in sofitel for the first time. I saw on the Internet that everyone commented on him as niche/quiet/but far from the beach. We did not happen to encounter a typhoon, but I think it can still give 5 points for the experience after check-in. The hotel environment is very elegant, the music is relaxing, I especially like the lights at night, they are all warm yellow, not the colorful and flickering plastic wind... The hotel is not big, so the guests do not have the feeling of rushing out of the large hotels they stayed in before. The waiters are very enthusiastic and want to help customers deal with problems in time. The colleague who hosted us was Michelle, who spoke fluent French and was very considerate to us. I asked about our situation every day. The next evening I said that we had a good time, but when we were playing in the pool, we encountered heavy rain. She arranged for ginger tea to be delivered to the room in time. She was very warm and considerate! Then there is the problem of the hotel being far away from the beach. I personally think it is not a problem. The road to the beach is full of large grassy areas. It is great for walking or taking pictures. There are deck chairs/mineral water/children's sand toys at the entrance of the beach. . Finally, when it comes to parent-child experience, there are activities every day. The children love it and can hardly stop. The hotel’s parent-child paradise is very large, with lots of toys, and children can play in it for a long time. If you want to put forward suggestions for improvement, it is a common problem in Sanya hotels. The professionalism of the service staff (interns) is average, and the inquiries raised by many guests are not particularly clear. I hope that good hotel brands can have requirements for internal training. The last thing I want to meet when I go to a hotel is a manager who doesn't know. In addition, the experience is really great, I will stay at sofitel again!

The butler Xiao Xiao provides considerate services from the baby cot. For late check-out, as long as there is a need, you can reply and handle it as soon as you need it. The hotel’s restaurant is not bad and the breakfast is rich. It is because there are too many people on the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the food is slow. Later, the service staff sent a fruit plate to express their apologies. , Sofitel's service is really good, and the price is moderate, I will check in this hotel again, and recommend it.

People help, many things, especially when checking out, because the children have to take a nap, Xiaolu specially helped to delay the check-out until two o’clock, which is perfect. Sofitel should be more friendly to families with children. The service is also very good. There are many parent-child projects to choose from to have a parent-child amu*****t park, which is very big and children like it very much. In addition, the Thai restaurant is very delicious, recommended! Breakfast is also better than Westin.

Although I stayed at another hotel for six days, my ticket was cancelled due to the typhoon, so I extended my stay at Sofitel for one night. The brand impression has always been very good. I used to live in Sofitel in Krabi, Thailand.
🚗 Transportation: 6-7 kilometers away from the duty-free city, so the beach is perfect. It is very convenient to take a taxi. Take a taxi around 23 yuan from Houhai Village. Shopping, eating and drinking are very convenient. No need to rent another car specially
🧹Hygienic: The beach is extremely clean and belongs to the hotel’s private beach, and the hotel is also very clean and shiny
🍃Environment: It pays great attention to garden design, there are two pool areas, there are many choices for drinking and ordering meals.
🔔Service: What attracts me most is the service! After booking, Joly, the housekeeper, called to ask about the room's special needs. The check-in at the front desk was very professional and fast. Xiaojin also came to welcome us... and welcome drinks. Every staff is very enthusiastic. We forgot to get water at the swimming pool, and the little goth in the swimming pool gave us two bottles of water. The kind of trea**ent that you can only get on holiday in Thailand is finally experienced in Sanya. This careful and detailed service is really a bonus, and the employees are in place. I think the management training is really in place. Just such a day makes us want to return to Sanya to live in Sofitel.

Beach: The beach is a bit far from the lobby. We ran to the beach at noon on the day we arrived. We underestimated the distance. After walking for almost 10 minutes, the sun was sweating and raining. The second time we went, we called the battery car in the hotel. Send it to ~ The beach is spacious than Bialong Bay, but the sea is not as blue as Yalong Bay, but it's not bad, because there are few people, just play~
Swimming pool: There are several, deep and shallow ones. Because it is off-season, there are not many hotel guests, and there are few people in the swimming pool. There will be falling leaves and branches in the pool~
Food: The breakfast is very good, with many varieties and good taste. Although there are not many guests, it is still very hearty every day. Because of the off-season, the hotel only opens the dinner buffet on Friday and Saturday nights. It is also very good. There are few seafood and shellfish, but there are many other varieties, especially the dessert part. It is really amazing, much better than the Hilton Hotel I stayed in front of. Chef ERIC Liu recommended to us very carefully, great 👍🏻~
Service: The service is not so proactive, but if there is a demand, it will still respond relatively quickly; our housekeeper boy also sent us afternoon tea on the day of check-in, very happy.

As soon as I ordered it, the butler Xiao Zuo added me to WeChat and asked me if I had any special requirements. The warm and gentle attitude made me feel particularly warm, and then I knew me. I came on my birthday holiday, and prepared a delicious cake with decorations. Although the hotel is not as good as the new hotel in terms of facilities, the sanitary corners are very clean, which makes me, a picky Virgo, unable to pick it out. What's wrong, the hotel goes directly out to a large beach. The hotel garden is very large and there are many swimming pools. Recently, there are not many tourists and it is very quiet. The only small suggestion may be that the breakfast needs to be improved. Although there are many types, I don’t like many things. I hope that the breakfast can be more refined next time. Thank you again for the hotel’s quiet arrangement and the warm service of Xiao Zuo. I will bring it next time. The baby is coming.

It was a bit late when we checked in on the same day, so the staff on duty might not be enough. The check-in procedure was delayed for a long time, and we became a little impatient. The manager next to Joly saw that we were unhappy. He came to solve the problem and took the initiative to send us back to the room. The next day he also gave us a free upgrade from an ordinary sea-view room to a superior sea-view suite. The room is super large and super happy! After encountering any problems in the hotel two days later, Joly was also very enthusiastic to help us solve them, and gave us a lot of things, which made us feel the VIP trea**ent 😎.

Speaking of hotels, the hotel facilities really have nothing to say. The swimming pool is the most satisfying among so many resort hotels that I have been to. It’s too relaxing to lie in the sun by the pool, and Miss Sherry at the pool bar is also special nice, I made a few delicious cocktails for us🍹. In terms of breakfast, because it is currently in the off-peak period of tourism, the category will be a little lacking, but the quality is still very high. In terms of service, I feel there is room for improvement. It may be due to insufficient manpower or need to strengthen training, but every staff member encountered is very friendly~

Overall, the Sofitel experience was very good, and I will come next time!

🧹Hygienic: with five-star hotel standards

🍃Environment: Hotel hardware, greenery, etc. are good, the key is that there are fewer people recently, more fun, and the swimming pool is very clean

🔔Service: Butler Xiaolu contacted me one day in advance, added WeChat, various tips every day, and took the initiative to upgrade the room. It's also because of the breakfast and the restaurant. . . It was not unpleasant, just slowed down a bit, and I was a little impatient, so I immediately arranged small snacks and fruit bowls in the room. It's already considered meticulous!

🚗 Transportation: It must be convenient to take a taxi. There are many shared bicycles at the door. I like it very much. It's like driving a convertible every day!

  The room attendant also folded the elephant, my mother really likes to play with elephants for a long time hahahahahahahahahaha

In short, everything is satisfactory!

msg:This one was actually booked temporarily in Sanya. Although some time and services of the hotel have been adjusted under the influence of the epidemic, it does not affect the check-in experience at all. Breakfast and service are very amazing parts. In the early hours, the chef and the waiter communicate a lot and will observe the needs of the guests. Bread is a rare level in domestic hotels, croissants and others, crispy, first-class level, each type is super delicious. Dinner was in the all-day dining restaurant, and my husband was full of praise. The chef also specially delivered desserts. The waiter Lucy was gentle and generous with a beautiful smile. The security guards of the swimming pool are very serious, and the cleaning staff will smile whenever they encounter it. The housekeeper of the Guest Relations Depar**ent always responds to any needs in the guest room. Before leaving, the mobile phone fell in the room, and the employees immediately assisted. We like the spaciousness and convenience of the room. The round table in the room is convenient for online office and dining. The sofa is comfortable and the view is directly on the central axis of the hotel. This is a good hotel that truly retains the heart and professionalism of guest service among all the hotels that have stayed in Sanya. In the past two days, we moved to another booked hotel. By comparison, the staff didn’t know after asking three questions, and they felt that Sofitel was very good.

The buffet and the Chinese restaurant were also very good. Maybe because of the epidemic, there were not many people and none. According to the guide, queuing up to get a meal is very user-friendly. I stayed for three more days. I saw Wuzhizhou Island on the beach. I insisted that it was not good. There were only a little bit from the room to the beach. There were a lot of small animals on the beach. For children to play, the hotel can also borrow the swimming ring to play with sand tools

msg:Sofitel's French service gave us many surprises. The three-day and two-night vacation experience was arranged under the care of the housekeeper Xiao Xiao, especially intimate and attentive. The day before check-in, Xiao Xiao took the initiative to call to communicate check-in time and needs. On the day of arrival, he waited in the lobby to assist with check-in work, and the process was relatively smooth. The package previously bought on Ctrip adds 120 yuan per night to a high-rise sea-view room in a golden building facing the sea.
🦀️Pool: Four, you can find your favorite pool area from young to old. The main swimming pool is very large and there are many small areas. If you are afraid of crowds, you can find a small area to play on your own. The small jet ski propellers play every day with children and adults taking a dip in the pool. The infinity pool is 1.5 or so deep, and there is a hanging chair next to the sea. The children can have a lunch break with the sea breeze, and get up and continue high. There is a slide in the children's pool, and the happy bubble is absolutely the favorite of children around 4 pm! There is a pool room on the first floor of the Golden Building, other residents cannot enter, and there is no strong sun. The pool area is definitely the main course of the holiday!
🌅Beach, you can walk to the sea for about 10 minutes. The endless beach, the waves are still very big. Haitang Bay cannot swim in the sea throughout the year. There are undercurrents. Please note that the hotel will place a red flag at the entrance. When the weather is good, you can go around 6 in the morning Watching the sunrise by the sea, it is a pity that I did not see the cloudy for a few days. The sunset looks at the door of my room, the afterglow of the setting sun is set against the undulating mountains, indescribably beautiful! It is recommended to play on the beach after 5 pm, when the tide is low, many small crabs can be found in the water area of the beach! Stepping on the pond to catch crabs and making sandcastles is the favorite of kids!
🥳Food: The breakfast buffet is very rich. Western, Chinese and Hainan characteristics can be found. The chef will make a special croissant every day to introduce to the diners. The French cuisine and desserts and the warm service are really Nice experience. There are also: Chinese restaurant, Thai food, noodle restaurant, dinner in the Chinese restaurant to solve a certain review online package discount is very cost-effective, the important thing is that the dishes are very delicious 😋, the service is in place! It is absolutely convenient to have lunch at a noodle restaurant while swimming.
💃Children’s facilities and activities: Sofitel’s event theme is The Little Prince🤴. When you check in, you will be issued a beautiful Little Prince Passport. The project is stamped and the five activities will be exchanged for an ice cream. All completed have a grand prize Little Prince themed bath Lottery can be drawn for robe and towel. Children’s playground, bubble bath, sand castle, kayaking, painting T-shirts, making biscuits, karts, lighting ceremony, staying for a few days will not be boring, seeing them make a new cake area is very beautiful next time I guess it will open !
♾Highlights: The French butler service is proactive, meticulous and thoughtful. The butler will help solve problems and is very proactive, without any worries; the sanitary condition is good, and many details can be felt that the hotel pays much attention to the sanitation situation, and foreigners early in the morning The manager took a group of people to do the sanitation inspection. There are people in the swimming pool who are fishing for leaves, checking the water quality, and changing the water all day long. There will be a small surprise after the room is cleaned. The children are not happy. When it’s on, it won’t be cleaned. Gardens: French-style gardens can be recognized by everyone. The hotel has various flowers and trees, the fragrance of flowers is scent, and the lawn is soft and flat.
This time I stayed in three hotels and asked the children their favorite Sofitel. It was a great fun but the vacation was always too short!
⚠️There is an epidemic now. Before you go, you must communicate with the hotel about the epidemic prevention policy.

msg:This time I came to Sanya and stayed at the second hotel. The housekeeper Xiaolu contacted me one day before I checked in, posted a video of the hotel, asked about the approximate check-in time, and was responsive to my questions. We arrived early on the day of check-in. She arranged for us to wait in the lounge and introduced the general situation of the hotel, let us know in advance, and escorted us to the room. Seeing that we are bringing one child and one child, she took the initiative to arrange for us The bed, I also gave the baby karting experience voucher, the hotel is very suitable for bringing children, there are books for sending children to check in, the small train, children’s playground and various activities are free, and there are many other activities. The five events are also OK. Change ice cream. During the stay, Xiao Lu would take the initiative to ask if there is anyone who needs help, a very caring little girl. My daughter liked it very much and wrote a little thank you card! In addition, the beach is very beautiful and the baby washes, overall a good experience, I will stay again next time.

Little train, hand-painted T-shirt, go-kart, bubble swimming pool, etc. We stroll on the beach in the evening and catch some sand crabs when it gets dark, which is interesting. The hotel has a battery car that can take you to the beach for free. To enjoy the breakfast buffet, go before 9 o'clock, otherwise there will be a lot of people in line. Our housekeeper, Xiao Xiao, is also an enthusiastic young lady. Any problems can be solved for you. Thank you for your considerate service. The experience of the hotel is very good, but the check-in time is a bit longer, hope to improve.

My lover likes the French style very much. Thank you very much to the manager Ethan and the housekeeper. Tender Shuai Gao's help and careful arrangement! This time the administrative courtesy included the Pearl Restaurant and the buffet dinner. I was always afraid that the hotel would not taste as good outside. It was too hot these days and I didn’t want to go out. I still chose to try it. The result was really good! The complimentary desserts and fruits are very delicious. My lover asked me to take it back to the room if I can’t eat it. I personally think that the seafood is not too much for the buffet dinner. Then the hotel should provide coconuts with so many coconut trees! The service staff are very attentive. The fly in the oin**ent is that the hotel’s recreational facilities are somewhat lacking. You can add some sauna rooms for indoor swimming. I don’t know why there are so many criticisms on this hotel on the Internet, which makes it so unpopular. Maybe personal preference, in short Fett’s room and environment have always been five-star in my heart. After all, it is also the old platinum card of Accor. Thank you very much for choosing this beautiful Sanya and this hotel for this anniversary with your lover. See you next time!

The room was so big that it was a bit tired to walk back and forth. The scenery, facilities, and sanitation were impeccable. The service attitude of Xiao Gao from the concierge depar**ent is super good. Both Nanhai Mingzhu Chinese Restaurant and Thai Restaurant are highly recommended. The dishes are delicious, delicious, and delicious. We have both reviewed them. The only dissatisfaction is the all-day dining restaurant. For breakfast, you can eat something casually. After all, you can go to the executive lounge to eat. The buffet dinner we ate at our own expense was arranged in a dark corner without air conditioning, and the dishes are totally sorry for the price of 288, 100 yuan is too much, I believe I must not step on the thunder. Except for this restaurant, everyone else is very satisfied, I should come back to Sanya next year

They have stayed at Capella, Ritz-Carlton, and Sun Bay Park before. This time they chose the price. The relatively cheap Sofitel Leeman, but I really like it. There are many parent-child projects, good services and responsiveness. Although it is peak season, the hotel facilities are not crowded. We also have a beautiful and cute butler who is responsible. Call us when we arrive at the airport and help us arrange the room. As long as we have something to find him, it can be solved perfectly. The key point is that the little butler has never asked us to give him praise or anything, so I don’t know his name, I just When he contacted us, the WeChat name "Little Shen doesn't eat carrots", because of your most considerate service, we like this hotel even more. I hope the little girl can keep this original intention and let more people like this hotel!
We have booked two suites, a parent-child suite, and a family suite. The room layout is reasonable. The children can also play together, a full set of bath products, L’Occitane, and executive lounge courtesy, beach or swimming pool, towels are always available To make up, even if some of the charged items are reasonably priced, we all fell asleep during the spa...

Traffic location: 90 minutes, slightly aside from Haitang Bay, a distance from the duty-free shop and Huanqiu 68 food street, travel requires taxi and shared electric vehicles.
Facilities and equipment: 90 points, the hotel is slightly new, but the maintenance is still a little lacking. The operation of repairing the gate and painting during the peak season of summer is also drunk, and the smell is pungent, affecting the experience. The wooden products such as the door were damaged to some extent and were not maintained in time. Except for some of the towels on the edge of the room, the edges are slightly fluffy, the others are okay!
Meals: Breakfast is quite satisfactory; buffet dinner, fresh ingredients, diverse varieties, timely replenishment, freshly squeezed juice is a highlight, the first time I used towels in the buffet dinner at Sanya Hotel, like it; Hainan Mingzhu Restaurant’s dinner is the best Like, the biggest highlight is zora's service comparable to Haidilao, fresh ingredients, delicious cooking, super cost-effective, worth experiencing!
Service: This is the most touching part of this trip. Good service can really make people remember and miss. 1. The housekeeper Xiaoman registered at the front desk took the initiative to add WeChat, and brought it to the room, arranged for the delivery of luggage, children’s supplies, and took the initiative to inform the hotel of parent-child activities. During the period, always pay attention to the WeChat recovery. If you leave the store, take the initiative to apply for check-out. The service, a good butler, praise the butler’s meticulous service, and let the boss give you processing capital. 2. Hainan Pearl Restaurant Chef Ye and Zora (it seems to be this name, I remember it correctly, No. 7.11), originally they only asked for help and opened a whole jackfruit. As a result, the harvest was full, a delicious dinner, two big The jackfruit that is peeled in the basin is extremely praised! 3. Whether it is a baggage student, a gardener or a restaurant waiter, they all nod and smile to say hello, which really makes this holiday full of warmth!

The rooms are very beautifully arranged. The cloakroom and the hallway separate the bedroom and the bathroom. The room is relatively large in size with complete facilities and a reasonable layout. In addition to multiple swimming pools, beaches, and children’s playgrounds, the hotel also has a variety of children’s activities. Follow the timetable, full of fun every day~

It's very ordinary. Basically, it costs 388 for a standard of around 100. Is it drunk? . In addition, the hotel room must be booked on the day of the stay. There are many rooms in Sanya in the off-season. Generally, the room on the same day is much cheaper. Is the economy bad! House prices are never stable. The third is that the hotel scenery is really average, but it seems that the big hotels in Sanya are at this level. Besides, the room is very clean, the service of the hotel is very good, especially the cleaning service of the room is the best I have ever seen, and the lobby manager is also good.

The room is also quite big, very suitable for vacation.

The butler Xiao Gao's service was very good. He contacted me the night before and asked patiently if he needed to arrange airport pick-up or anything. The room in the presidential suite is big enough, and the swimming pool is OK, but other hardware is relatively average. The large swimming pool in the hotel is quite dirty. There are many people in the buffet and there is very little food. It is very average. The hotel is quite old in general, and the service is okay. OK!

The bunk bed in the room is facing the air vent, so it is easy to catch a cold. The variety of breakfast is OK, but the taste is average. The Ctrip live broadcast includes breakfast and dinner for children under the age of 12. They tell me over and over again that they need to pay more, and every time I turn on my mobile phone to show them the order. Wasn't this already confirmed at check-in? I participated in the Bubble Party in two days, but the swimming pool has steps, so I can't see the bubbles at all. The child's knee is quite broken, so I can only think of the service staff. I disinfected it with alcohol, and put a band-aid on it. There was no question about what to do next. It's rare to write so many words, it's really not enough for five stars.

msg:每年都去三亞一二次，其中2019、2021、2024入住理文索菲特酒店，多次選擇的理由是:理文的泳池水深1.5米、長寬合適適合游泳，草坪開闊、綠化養護較好。酒店服務總體（主要是客房服務和餐廳服務）還是熱情主動，但前台較敷衍。也許是價格的原因這次早餐品質較前兩次有所退步，“瑕不掩瑜”從度假的角度講我還是會繼續選擇理文索菲特酒店。

先去海灘玩，浪比較大不建議下水，在沙灘上，浪花沖一沖還是可以的，就別下去游泳了。
然後就去泳池，水是温的，在水裡玩很舒服，深的淺的池子很多，邊上還有躺椅，玩累了躺椅上曬曬太陽特別舒服。
小孩兒的娛樂設施挺多的，要是也有點兒大人能玩的滑梯就好了。
附近有吃飯的地方，租了車直接開車過去很方便。
三亞這邊還是適合在酒店裡享受

msg:索菲特絕對是被低估的酒店
賓客服務巨好，每天都問我另一天的需求，要不要打掃房間之類的👍
每晚還有樂隊表演，泳池也有兩個👍
重點是網上説他的早餐不好吃，其實根本沒有種類非常多，尤其是麪包巨好吃，這可能是法國人獨有的情懷與浪漫😻
房卡包括梳子和牙刷都是木質的，真的很環保浪漫😃
有些人説他們服務不好，但是這次接待我的是Dora小雨，出行前三天就已經跟我取得聯繫，給我安排偏好的房間樓層，並且在入住期間每天都問我的入住需求，很棒很貼心👍👍

msg:性價比很高！五一節期間加價也合理，到店較晚，原定房型衹剩角落的了，管家和前台小哥都很努力協調，最後加錢升級海景套，很值得，正對海景！
酒店泳池分區很清楚，孩子們最愛玩的大喇叭玩得不願走。
親子活動貌似和其他酒店一樣，稍顯敷衍，尤其手工烘焙那些，希望可以更用心點哦，晚上的演出還是很不錯的。
早餐説實話很一般哎，選擇不算多，高峯時間排隊很久哎。
最後走到沙灘還算方便的，沙灘也算平緩，適合孩子挖沙玩水。
管家Murca 從預訂後一直跟蹤，回覆很及時，有問題也及時反饋，點贊👍

酒店細節上，如果有提供沙灘包或環保袋就更好了。
總的來説，比上次去的香*裏*性價比高的多！推薦！

msg:首先聲明打五分完全是因為我優秀的管家小雪sherry，非常有禮貌而且照顧的很周到細緻，但是索菲亞硬件和管理都比較一般，下次不會再來了
設施：花灑和沐浴液都比較過時了，而且那個瓶子設計**一樣的高壓噴嘴，要不就亂射，要不就按下午起不來。
衞生：衹能説比較驚悚，全是飛蟲還要小強以及各種各樣的聖甲蟲在陽台和門口，每天早晨一開門門口躺着無數屍體，酒店隊友蚊蟲消殺應該是沒有
環境：整體還不錯，海棠灣就不能下海，期待本來就不高，衹是酒店動線設計的不合理，動線標識也不明確，尤其是住金樓離的非常遠，去拿**外賣實際上可以從宴會廳穿過去，自己摸索了半天找到一條近路，問了四個服務員都是讓我走大堂繞
服務：所有的客房服務員或者在客房的人員從來不打招呼的，跟完全沒有看到客人一樣，這對於度假酒店來説是大大的差評

總之法國人酒店的管理比較佛系，但是它們的法棍的確是非常好吃。

服務人員是真不錯，到哪都很主動打招呼，門衞也很主動幫你拿行李，管家nikki很貼心，對我們的需求都給了非常好的幫忙
1.可能很多的不滿都是旺季定的，我四月底1100帶雙早的全海景，那首先就有點賺到了的情緒在，後面的評價估計也有點這方面的影響
2.房間感覺完全不舊，當然他這種還是偏親子的，有點小磨損很正常。
3.房間的邊邊聊聊都是圓弧狀，細節好評。還有早餐有個專門的小童拿餐區，這都是細節。
4.浴缸很大，兩個小孩洗還有大把位置，感覺還能放下為父我
5.海景説實話還是非常棒的，很四正。
6.去海邊真的很方便，通勤車很快也不用怎麼等，但是假如可以還是喜歡走過去，就五六分鐘，而且中間穿過草坪，景色很好。
7.近海還有個兩大兩小泳池，小孩玩的一身沙基本都在小泳池沖乾淨了[破涕為笑]
8.節目很多，小孩玩的地方也很多，不一一列舉了。遊戲廳裏打恐龍的遊戲機真的很好玩。
9.一直開到11點的，這個更讚了。
10. 很奇怪，都四月了，竟然沒什麼蚊蟲，是索菲特自己的優點還是整個三亞的情況。
有些別人説的缺點，例如拿外賣不方便，我覺得倒還好，是有點距離，但全部送到大堂感覺拉低酒店檔次一樣，而且其實也不算遠。
説點有待提升的吧。
1.房間就在電梯前，説實話隔音這個時候就不夠了
2.電視感覺需要更換一下，比較模糊
3.小孩子的自助晚餐嘛，有時不用太計較，就高個3.4公分的，也吃不多的嘛[呲牙]
但這些説實話都瑕不掩瑜，下次還會想住[呲牙]

酒店and環境：有適合情侶的法式浪漫，更適合帶娃的家庭，每天下午都有小廚師的活動，做好可以帶走吃。小童室內樂園是免費的能玩一上午，卡丁車適合120cm以上的小朋友。下午帶娃手工，傍晚大喇叭泳池刷一刷。晚上有魔術變臉小丑還有火舞表演覆蓋了從小朋友到大朋友的觀賞需求。一天都很充實。
設施：房間淺木色維護的比較好，不陳舊，用品很齊全有咖啡機，茶的品種也多目前住過幾家中唯一一家有果茶的。小朋友的用品齊全，牙刷梳子等等用品都是木質的質感確實比塑料的好，細節照顧到了體驗感就會好。
出行：酒店有免費的大巴來回免税。
早餐：環境很好，品種很多，有小童區域。
自助晚餐：emmm…

總結：下次再來海棠灣的話會再次選擇入住理文索菲特的。

服務：行政禮遇是真的不錯。管家很熱情，行政酒廊也挺適合我們這種帶寶寶沒有太多外面玩的行程。就是寶寶太小很多親子活動還沒辦法參加，以後有機會再體驗。

美中不足的是自助晚餐沒啥大海鮮，但令人意外的是泰餐廳還蠻好吃的，馬沙文咖喱牛肉可棒。

在攜程預訂房間後，酒店立即與我聯繫，詢問我對房間有什麼特殊要求。與我對接的是Venus小益，我説明瞭我的需求後，她為我挑選了的房間位置我很喜歡。有應必回。除此之外，她會主動詢問我的入住情況和需求。
三亞理文索菲特酒店是當地親子酒店的TOP。儘管小孩子很多，但房間隔音很好，我能很好的休息。
酒店的工作人員也很熱情，會主動打招呼。看到賓客有需求時會主動幫助。
總的來説體驗感很好。如果下次再來三亞度假，我還是會選擇索菲特。

帶媽來三亞其實最歡樂，我也算是老海南人了吧。三亞一眾酒店真的風格不同，但一定要來索菲特，感受法式雅高酒店的低調與沉穩。不僅如此，還有Nikki小美女的舒心安排。閑暇時，一定要在迷你吧裏找到一瓶芬達，你一定會想起她。

衞生：每天打掃的很乾凈。這家泳池一直比較乾淨的，主泳池和靠近沙灘的泳池的佈置都很喜歡，傍晚來玩到晚上很爽，泳池備的毛巾不多最好自己帶條浴巾去。
環境：一如既往的美，綠植覆蓋率很高，是我喜歡的風格，怕曬的姐妹來這裏。要提一下在酒店裡逛到沙灘一路上的音樂是最喜歡的，法式度假感。
服務：這次的接待官是nikki，問題回覆和要求都特別快的給解答和安排，三天絲滑體驗，小萌妹一枚，愛了愛了。
每次來都去水療中心做一次椰油spa，環境好、按摩很專業，建議來試試。
晚上有一小時多的表演活動，節目都很好看，火舞表演太酷啦，連看了三天。
泰餐廳和海南中餐廳依然美味，住一兩天的話建議就酒店吃，大堂吧最推薦鮮榨菠蘿汁。住了三晚點過一次外賣、外賣櫃在大堂出去右拐下坡，走起來再回到金樓一身大汗，但不得不説那個椰子喝起來容量大而且甜哈哈哈。

拍照：索菲特是法式風格，隨拍就是出片。酒店可以免費手搖船槳板，大人小孩游泳圈也特別多免費使用。泳池邊浴巾也特別多，拿取很方便，浴巾都是温熱的，用起很舒服。
早餐很豐盛，味道還不錯，種類也比較多，結束時間是 11 點，對於度假來説是非常享受的
賓客關係主任 Angela 會提前一天聯繫，發來入住須知，酒店遊玩攻略等。還會幫助安排房間，提出的要求基本都能滿足～

服務：
最不滿意的點。作為雅高集團下的高端五星，酒店整體服務素質都不高。從入住的前台辦理就沒有笑臉，一副匆匆忙忙處理好就行的樣子。三天都是酒店內用餐，自助餐廳就更不用説了，進去沒有引導，自行找空坐。用餐全程沒有服務員更換骨碟，取餐檔口的服務員態度也很差，愛答不理的。雖然配備了管家幫忙解決了一些問題，但是也不足以彌補這種整體服務素質低下的缺口。尤其是先入住了萬豪和恆仁，對比就更明顯了

設施：
酒店打着環保的名義，衹提供最基礎的牙刷，沒有其他任何洗漱用品，想要也行，自己打電話去要。別人家的酒店恨不得把所有能準備的都端客人臉上，別人家酒店不講環保? 酒店的床也軟到離譜，沒有正常人能接受這種一點支撐都沒有的感覺，更別説是小朋友了

總體來説很不滿意

拍照：索菲特是法式風格，隨拍就是出片。酒店可以免費手搖船槳板，大人小孩游泳圈也特別多免費使用。泳池邊浴巾也特別多，拿取很方便，浴巾都是温熱的，用起很舒服。
酒店能直接走到海邊，海邊風浪有點大，不能下水，但是拍照很出片^_^📷
誇獎一下賓客關係Angela小姐姐，熱情有禮貌，貼心又周到！
總之整體來説酒店還是不錯的，性價比高，推薦哦

至尊海景房也挺好，收拾得乾淨，客房服務及時，符合五星標註。
全日餐廳晚餐不錯，特別是各種法式甜點不下二十款，太上頭了。
泳池也很多，除了樓下幾個，靠近沙灘還有一個。泳圈挖沙工具什麼也都免費，小朋友友好，小童活動多。
此外客户關係小尹挺好，提前加了我微信，詢問我是否需要各種需求，發來各種酒店訊息，有問必答，很細心，還幫你協調了延遲退房。
家人很滿意，已經安利給了周圍很多人。

msg:給第一次選理文索菲特忐忑的朋友一些建議哈。
首先非常推薦，我不是託哦。我們是帶了六歲的孩子，這裏總體挺適合小孩家庭，十歲下應該都可以。情侶和長者都挺好的因為泳池多。我們的管家Nikki非常有親和力，温暖服務非常好，她並沒有要求我提她，但是真的太貼心了。

在這裏度過的兩天裏非常喜歡這裏的氛圍，泳池下午還有dj製造氣氛，孩子在這裏愛上了泳池，天天都要去玩兒。酒店的設施很貼心，可以提供各種孩子的設施，一趟一趟地送很不厭其煩。晚上的自助餐建議參加，因為一邊看錶演非常棒，火舞值得一看。如果有時間，可以在大堂喝一杯哈哈，穿堂風非常舒服真的有感受到度假的氛圍。行政酒廊的飯食建議增加點米飯熱乎的，不然孩子吃着涼冰冰。

服務從管家到前台都不錯，小火車司機也沒有像評論説的態度不好，也還挺好的，就是大堂吧飲料的女孩子可以笑一笑嗎？不然要求好評也有點勉強哈。

總體非常推薦家庭度假，住2-3天挺好的，衹是海棠灣的海總是有點不太親和的感覺，不過下次還會來住哦，孩子很喜歡我和老公感受也不錯，價格也很實惠值得一住，放平自己的期待哈哈。

泳池非常大，還錯落有致地隔開好幾個區域，池水清澈。小童泳池裡還有滑梯，泳池邊上就是躺椅，小童泳池在珍珠樓樓下 旁邊就有小童樂園 還有提供免費的浴巾和泳圈以及挖沙工具。就是需要護欄一點要提早説 畢竟是親子酒店 很容易就不夠用，房間是很大的 比較舒適 沒有那麼不堪 就挺正常的，
辦理入住會給一本小王子護照，可以根據公眾號上的活動來打卡蓋章。集齊八個印章可以換冰淇淋。總共有三棟樓，還有每天傍晚在餐廳草坪上的表演，很精彩 金樓 珍珠 翡翠 這次住的珍珠樓挺方便。賓客部艾米莉 熱情周到 貼心 有求必應 推薦親子入住哦，[呲牙]

酒店裝修大氣，處處美景，酒店套餐親子活動多，家長的活動也很多，自助餐呀，下午茶呀。酒店非常親子，孩子雖然小，也玩的很開心。住了3天都沒玩明白。
非常值得入住。

缺點：1.客房的單人床比較小，也就1.1米吧，彈簧軟，躺上去會塌陷，品質還不如某些品牌快捷酒店（如全季等）。2.小童太多了、公共區域比較吵鬧，哭聲喊叫聲不絕於耳。3.酒店地處海棠灣，距離城區比較遠，非自駕不方便。4.酒店餐廳價格巨貴（也可能是我收入較低）。晚餐自助每人388元。海南明珠中餐廳二人套餐**價485元（二人晚餐的最低價了）。因外出用餐不便利，酒店用餐的價格頗有被敲竹槓的感覺。

1. 入住升房。定的奢華海景大床房，就在快結束辦理時，旁邊位置辦理人員對來的比我晚的顧客説把她的奢華海景大床升房。我就問了句給我辦理的人可以升房嗎？她估計應該也聽到隔壁的對話了，然後看了看説有一間離電梯遠一點的。關於升房為什麼不是統一的標準？是看人決定嗎？2. 小童推車難借。入住當天一點多想借推車，説沒有。預留了電話，第二天中午十一點才給我説有一個了。3. 床單有污漬。如圖。4. Wifi不穩定，常斷開或連不上。5. 吃自助餐一開始選擇了外邊的桌子，但是可能傍晚了有小飛蟲，我就想換桌到裡邊，一位微胖的服務員表情並不高興。
6. 估計因為多次詢問推車而沒有，管家一開始説送個小水果給我，結果，到最後一天我離店也沒有送來。倒真不差這口水果，衹是這樣的行為會不太舒服。
當然也有比希爾頓相比優點。
1. 餐飲。索菲特的甜品做的是真不錯，還有專門給小朋友做的部分，嚐了味道不甜，應該是減糖版，在住過所有酒店裡都算優秀。
2. 浴室蠻大，有兩個洗手池，使用比較方便。

酒店屬於法式風格，坐落在海棠灣風光旖旎的海岸網上。酒店佔地廣闊，綠樹成蔭，繁花似錦，設施齊全。酒店可以直達海邊，可以坐穿梭車，也可以悠閑散步過去，看看沿途風景也很愜意。孩子非常喜歡去海邊玩，沒有那麼多遊客，比較清閑乾淨。
我們定的奢華海景房，前台美女艾米莉還給我們升級了房型。房間很大，乾濕分離，陽台寬闊，直麪大海讓人身心愉悦。房間非常乾淨，工作人員打掃衞生及時。我們還在房間欣賞了海上日出，棒呆了~
酒店親子活動非常多，小廚師，小火車，卡丁車，泡泡大戰，彩繪，點燈儀式，小丑表演，小童樂園，晚上還有特色演出，表演很精彩。小童泳池也很可愛，有各種滑滑梯，還有恆温泳池。
賓客部艾米莉提前聯繫熱情貼心 分享好多訊息 酒店遊玩攻略一應俱全。可以泡在酒店不出門。早餐也挺不錯的，豐盛。
另外交通也很方便，距離免税店5 6公里，打車10分鐘車程。周邊還有蜈支洲島後海，海昌不夜城。

msg:設施：整體設施都不錯，入住後電話回訪入住體驗，我們表達了想換個房間，也很好的主動跟進，第二天下午主動告知我們有空房可以比較選擇。小火車基本10分鐘一班，對小朋友很友好。

服務：sherry小雪在辦理入住的時候就加了微信，發了很多訊息和攻略。

衞生：要説不足，想到一點，室內小童遊樂場好像沒有窗户，感覺不太通風。

環境：明珠餐廳的菜很好吃。
