msg:It happened to be the Grain Rain solar term, so I booked the Weixiyuan Hotel. The hotel is located in the beautiful mountains and forests of Yi County. It is both a natural oxygen bar and a natural picture. It is really a scene at every step. Both the plants and the buildings reveal the breath of natural art. Sitting on the balcony on the second floor of the room, I sipped a cup of tea comfortably, and the "waves turned the shadows of the morning clouds, and the shores overlapped the spring mountains. -- Li Bai's "Ten Songs of Gusu"". Maybe every season has different scenery, so see you next time!

The experience after checking in was beyond my expectations. The hotel is located on the mountain, and there are special cars to pick you up and down the mountain, which is very convenient. The hotel environment is like a paradise, and the facilities such as art galleries, cafes, tea rooms, etc. are also readily available. It has both a return to nature and a petty bourgeoisie a**osphere. The room has floor heating throughout the house, which is warm and comfortable. The hotel staff is also very enthusiastic and will answer any questions patiently and responsibly. There is also a small check-in lottery activity during the Spring Festival. Unfortunately, the itinerary was tight this time and I didn’t experience it. I will come back and stay a few more days next time~

msg:The biggest surprise of this trip to Huangshan. The service is very attentive and friendly. The whole park is surrounded by deep mountains and the park is traversed by a small river. It is very comfortable to enjoy the natural sound of the river in tranquility. The vegetables grown by the restaurant are very fresh, and breakfast and dinner are all prepared here. The private soup in the room is great, the water is hot enough, and it is very enjoyable to take a bath in winter. It is a pity that the outdoor infinity pool cannot be enjoyed in winter, and the hot weather is coming. It is recommended to get more mirrors and bicycles in the gym.
This is a hotel that you must stay in and enjoy after moving in. It is absolutely recommended and worth it.

msg:For the first time, I found it difficult to choose photos. I took too many beautiful photos in the hotel and wanted to post them all.
In short, it is a congenial hotel that gave me a wonderful experience.
First of all, thank you for taking the initiative to call to upgrade my standard room to a suite, which helped me to strengthen my determination to go. Because I wanted to climb Huangshan Mountain, I stayed at the top of the mountain for one night and then stayed at the hotel on the second night. Before going, I was wavering because of the weather and popularity of Huangshan Mountain. The enthusiasm of the hotel prompted me to decide to go.
After Huangshan Mountain, I went to the hotel. The hotel had already arranged a full itinerary in the store: in the afternoon, there was a sunny afternoon tea, and in the evening, there was a high-level Huangmei Opera performance. On the next day, I also soaked my tired and sore legs in the courtyard hot spring pool of the suite.
Lingering in the hotel, the surprise of changing scenery is needless to say. The most impressive thing is the pursuit of quality-from the complimentary afternoon tea to the buffet breakfast, from the comfortable bedding to the details of all corners in the room equipped with anti-collision stickers, all of which show the hotel's intentions, rather than superficial perfunctory.
Needless to say, the staff was enthusiastic, with smiles on every face, and they responded to every request we made without getting tired of it. From the beautiful lady at the front desk to the lady in the cafe, from the room service aunt to the security uncle, with their efforts, we spent a perfect and relaxing holiday.
The souvenirs given when leaving the hotel - Qihong and Maofeng, are both famous products in the Huizhou area. As a person who likes to drink tea on weekdays, I couldn't wait to brew it and taste it when I got home. The quality is good, and it is a model of less but better - which is even more to my heart.

msg:The hotel is located on a small hillside, with a very strong sense of design. It is said that a lot of money was spent on the design. The soft and hard decoration and facilities are of high grade, and they pay great attention to details, which is a plus! If you love taking pictures, it is highly recommended, and it will be very photogenic.
A sincere five-star review! Especially the service, which is definitely a plus! It is the best of all the wild luxury hotels I have stayed in so far.
We arrived late, and the dinner experience was not very good, which had already produced a bad impression. However, the person in charge of the catering handled it with a positive attitude and full of sincerity, which offset the deduction of points for catering. However, it is still recommended that the hotel can continue to improve in this regard.
The hotel is located half an hour's drive from Hongcun, with strong privacy. There is a shuttle bus to take you up the mountain, which is in sharp contrast to the flow of people in Huangshan and Hongcun.
Wandering around the hotel in the morning, it is comfortable and cozy. This trip is relatively hasty. If there is a chance, I will stay for two more days. I hope that the food can keep up.

The design style of the garden, the small bridge and the flowing water are in harmony with the Anhui-style houses. The cafe that provides afternoon tea is also very poetic and comfortable. The hotel has a lot of activities, including lawn music parties and BBQs in the evening. The restaurant has high-quality and stable products, and the breakfast is very rich! I recommend the Valley Private Soup Room, where you can enjoy tea and listen to the rain outdoors. It feels great to take a bath in the evening. My picky husband also praised it and said he would come again next time. I left a piece of clothing when I left, and the hotel immediately contacted and sent it back. The service is perfect.

I went to the small village behind the tea mountain and wandered around. I came back with a handful of mountain chrysanthemums. I couldn’t take them away and couldn’t bear to throw them away. I put them in a mineral water bottle and filled them with water to keep in my room. It felt quite good, hahaha😄

Here, you fall asleep with the sound of the stream at night, and wake you up in the morning with the sound of birdsong. In the morning, you sit on the bench in the front hall, drink tea, admire the scenery, and feed the fish. In the afternoon, you go to the cafe and order a drink. Coffee, flipping through a magazine, and enjoying afternoon tea. There are still bells hanging on the trees in the park. When a gust of wind passes by, it seems that you can hear the whisper of the wind. The staff in the hotel are all very nice, everyone has a smile. Weixi Garden is really a place you don’t want to leave once you’ve arrived.

msg:I purchased a three-day and two-night package in a waterfront deluxe twin room from Ctrip. The hotel front desk upgraded me to a Valley Family Suite. I would like to express my gratitude!
The entrance of the hotel is next to National Highway 530, which is easy to see. There is an open-air parking lot across the bridge. The hotel staff will cover your car with a sunshade, which is thoughtful. After parking the car, the hotel's shuttle electric car took us up the mountain. After checking in, the hotel staff used an electric car to take us to the entrance of the courtyard and helped us move our luggage into the room. The service was attentive.
The hotel is located in a mountain col. It is a modern hotel renovated from an abandoned village. The park has small bridges and flowing water. It is well-proportioned and the environment is quiet. The layout of the suite we stayed in is as follows: the entrance on the first floor is a foyer, with a hot water kettle, coffee machine, and small refrigerator on the left hand side, a twin bedroom on the right hand side, a wet and dry bathroom in front, and a small semi-open-air bath/swimming pool outside the shower room. The second floor is a large bed bedroom, a tatami reception room and a wet and dry bathroom. The second floor is equipped with a large terrace. The decoration of the room is simple and durable, and the materials used are exquisite. All the cabinet doors and drawers have no peculiar smell. The fabric sofa and carpet are very clean. The bedding and towels are white and tidy. I am very satisfied with staying in this brand-new guest room!
It was already two or three o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived at the hotel. When we checked in, we made a reservation to enjoy the hotel's complimentary set meal at seven o'clock in the evening. We arrived on time and our food was served immediately. The jellyfish mixed with shredded chicken is very creative. The salty chicken shredded chicken and jellyfish are complementary to each other and very delicious. Stinky mandarin fish, an authentic Anhui cuisine with a fresh and salty taste. The waiter also gave me a small glass of home-brewed liquor, which was quite delicious. The next day we followed the road book provided by the hotel and took a trip to Huizhou Tianlu. It was a worthwhile trip!
On the third day, it rained due to the typhoon. Stayed at the hotel and tasted the afternoon tea provided by the hotel in the afternoon. It is so comfortable to sit in the cafe with bright and clean windows, sipping coffee, tasting desserts, eating fruit platter, and looking at the mountain scenery.
I dined at the hotel that night and ordered shredded chicken with jellyfish, hand-baked shrimp balls, pork ribs with Huizhou sauce and a seasonal vegetable. The ingredients were fresh, the taste was authentic, and it was good value for money.
The hotel's breakfast is usually a set meal, with Chinese, European and American options for you to choose from. Each of the three packages has its own characteristics, and if not enough, you can add more. It is a buffet style on weekends and the variety is quite rich.
This four-day and three-night trip is over. I stayed at Weixi Garden and enjoyed the tranquil mountain scenery, listened to the gurgling water, and experienced the warm service. I was very satisfied and very happy.

msg:非常驚艷的酒店，選酒店時在悦榕莊和未晞園之間猶豫很久，看了各平台的評價，做了攻略，很慶幸自己最終選擇了未晞園。一次從預訂到入住都無比絲滑，充滿驚喜的入住體驗。一個在大山深處給足歸屬感的避世之所。酒店位於山上，穿過山林環山而上，到達酒店之時豁然開朗。酒店是分散式度假村，房間在山水之間，晨起聞鳥聲，雨時處雲端。服務更是媲美國內外知名奢華度假村，1分鐘辦理入住，check out 沒去前台，服務人員還在我們去山下的路上送上了小禮品。酒店2022年10月開業，硬件自然沒得説。重點是，酒店關注細節，每位工作人員擁有自發的主人翁意識，有判斷力和其職責範圍內的自由決策權，看得出來酒店用人和培訓都非常到位。所有的問題服務人員會通過酒店微信及時回覆。從入住之前的抵達諮詢，行程設計，到入住之後瑣碎事情的有問必答。酒店位於半山，來回酒店和山下停車場的接駁車不辭辛苦的接送我們每天無數次來回。七夕更是送上浪漫小驚喜。未晞園意外的成為了這次黃山黟縣的獨家最美的回憶。

特別要感謝酒店的餘飛紅，高鳳兩位工作人員，我們是兩家人出遊，昨天特別開心，在酒店吃飯喝酒到夜裡兩點多了，他們兩位一直服務到我們結束，非常辛苦。
滿分推薦這家酒店。這個酒店絕對比悦榕莊要好多了。

酒店是去年11月剛開業的，設施都很新，但因為是在山上，所以小蟲較多。
三點不足之處：1、我入住的是山谷行政套房，共兩層，一層居然沒有安裝電話，有事找前台需要爬樓上二層打；2、户外泡澡的地方沒有考慮到客人萬一泡澡出狀況如何呼叫；3、服務跟不上，近7千的房價沒有得到對應的服務。
也許是剛營業不久，管理經驗不足，真心希望能改進。

入住的房間是大床房，還擔心山區會有蟲會睡不好，但沒想道是出來旅行這麼多次，睡的最好的一晚，整夜無夢無驚喜，特別安穩。
房間內有浴缸泡澡，很贊。迷你吧也很棒，免費，小食和水果特別豐盛，茶葉好，有紅茶和綠茶。
沿着酒店內部道路閑逛，路兩邊有咖啡廳、酒吧、茶室、健身館等。
整體比較滿意的，有一些小細節，有在房間裏留言，無傷大雅。很適合放空和散心。
最最滿意的就是酒店秋景，當天下午去了塔川人太多隨便看了下就回來了，傍晚坐在酒店草坪靜靜的吹吹風，很愜意。大隱隱於市。

msg:酒店在靠近西遞的一座小山山背上，相對比較孤立，比較清凈。距離西遞開車約15分鐘，進出酒店的路口沒有設定店招，導致很難能找，晚上完全沒有燈箱指示，路口非常容易錯過。
酒店人員服務態度很好值得點贊，也感謝為我們升級了房型。
酒店定位高於悦榕莊，最低價的房型也要3000多一晚，定價與我們住宿的感受不符。因為比較新，人氣不足，所以房間裏傢俱味道很重，去之前電話諮詢説是建好兩年，因為疫情沒有開業，現在看來應該不實，酒店一些基礎設施尚不完善，引水的水管不知道是不是前期沒有設計，路上始終有明管在，並且路上不時有水，一部分綠化工程也還沒有完成，但是門口的大樹真的很美。
到酒店是中午12點半，竟無法點餐，之前電話問過餐食情況也沒有告知，點餐需要提前預約，到了卻衹有套餐，讓人有點無語。由於第二天爬黃山，衹有離店那天預約了點餐，但是讓我感到奇怪的是，酒店並不以徽菜為主營，竟然連毛豆腐都沒有，讓人有點失望。
由於酒店人相對不多，導致我們始終擔心菜品的新鮮程度，最讓我們產生這種擔心的原因是房間裏提供了一個小餐吧，裏面的商品雖然免費，基本都是自助餐枱商品，但竟然都是臨期商品，距離過期衹有十幾天，前台給出的回覆是未過期並不影響使用，但是啤酒瓶口都銹了，特別影響心情，畢竟5000多一晚的房間提供臨期商品實在説不過去。酒店每天提供了一些曲奇和小甜品，不酥脆，導致連續兩天酒店提供的歡迎水果和零食我們不敢吃。
升級的房型有兩層，一層卻沒設計電話，衹有二層有一個電話，一旦總枱來電話就得爬到二樓，兩天一住徹底打消了我老婆買別墅的念頭，最讓人擔心的還是感應馬桶，太敏感了，夜裡會自己開關馬桶蓋，導致一樓的燈我們不敢關，智能馬桶插頭不敢插。
房間的傢俱、陳設比較考究，小石桌感覺不搭，比較突兀。酒店有一個無邊游泳池，開放時間是早晨七點到晚上七點，在這個8月的温度情況下這個時間段開放沒有任何意義，建議像其他酒店泳池一樣增開到晚上12點。
酒店位置離黃山較遠，有一個多小時車程，離西遞以及齊雲山較近，需要根據行程來定，如果主玩黃山還是建議住在山上，避開上山高峯，中午上山會輕鬆愉快很多。

msg:暑假帶兒子去宏村玩，選了一家新酒店，酒店很隱祕，要坐5分鐘電瓶車到山頂，入口處的古樹很贊，很漂亮。
我們房間定的是套房，設施很新，地板和牆體用的都是實木，洗漱小樣很香很好用，棉簽桶,垃圾桶還印有logo，很用心的設計。房間後院的泡池很贊很舒服，酒店介紹是過濾後的山泉水。
酒店無邊泳池位於一棟樓的樓頂，可以泡在池中看滿天繁星和月亮，有一種眺望山巒，置身於自然的感覺，水深1米2，我們超喜歡！
距離西遞很近，開車去西遞衹要10分鐘，宏村要25分鐘。秋天再來打卡塔川。

衞生：挺好的。

環境：清靜。

服務：很真誠。謝謝臨走時贈送的茶葉。

餐飲方面還有不少值得改進。餐廳的室內温度和氛圍根據季節情況都可以再調整。早餐可以送到房間是個很好的選擇，但是建議在送餐的方式上要仔細研究考慮，這個季節要確保送來的食物足夠熱。

另外酒店內接送客人和行李用商務車感覺有點大材小用，一般的buggy就可以了。從停車場接客人上來的車建議車身要有logo，車內要配備welcome kit，給到客人完整的到達體驗，從初始就強化品牌概念的呈現。

建議多參考些經典度假酒店的待客之道。近有悦榕莊，遠一點有富春山居。

msg:I originally rated it 4 points and briefly talked about the experience. However, the hotel reviews avoided the important points and found reasons to not upgrade the room because of us. I saw in the comment area that other people were allowed to upgrade the room at will, but our family was traveling with 7 people staying in 3 rooms. A room (4 elderly people + a family of 3 people), stayed for 2 nights, and got nothing. I am not worried about the scarcity but the inequality. Well, I will give a comprehensive and fair negative review.
First of all, I am a Hyatt Globalist, Marriott Titanium (originally Platinum, but dropped due to the epidemic), and I have stayed in many hotels in the 2000-3000 range.
Let me talk about the service first: I arrived at the hotel late in the afternoon and took my family to the restaurant for dinner. It was indeed not a meal, but I could order food, such as noodles and fried rice. There is only one girl sitting at the front desk in the restaurant, playing mahjong on her mobile phone. It doesn't matter. There are no customers. You can just have fun by yourself. The key is that when I say I want to order, what is the expression and attitude of the service staff? He had a look of displeasure on his face as he interrupted the game, so his emotions were directly on his face. Is it necessary to be so enthusiastic when playing games during work hours? I'm here to spend money. The girl at the back adjusted her mood, and the service was quite enthusiastic, with a smile on her face, but I still think of the unhappy and angry expression on her face earlier, which always felt fake.
The rest of the service experience was okay. However, during my stay at the hotel, it was obvious that business was not good during those days. There were not many people staying, and the hotel did not hire too many waiters. We met in the coffee area in the afternoon and in the hotel restaurant in the evening. The waiters who arrived were all alone, and this was on two floors separated by several hundred meters. This is not a shortcoming, but it proves that business is average.
Secondly, the hotel facilities, such as the infinity swimming pool, can’t be exaggerated to say they are deceiving, right? Probably not. The swimming pool is very small, much smaller than the picture. And the most important thing is that there are a lot of leaves in the swimming pool. I also saw several bugs. It is obvious that the swimming pool lacks maintenance and no guests are really willing to use it. The deck chairs next to the swimming pool are also poor. Very dirty.
For example, art museum, this. . **Online celebrities only need to take a photo. The actual site is small and not high-end. You can take a quick look at it in 2 minutes without spending time in the exhibition hall.
Forget it, let’s stop talking about it first. I won’t talk about the hygienic dining environment. I am very, very busy. Regarding this hotel, I still have room and night to comment on. I will comment on it later depending on my mood.

msg:整體就餐和服務還可以，正常五星，運動區域尤其是泳池基本就是低於五星水平。我是帶着雙方父母和娃共6大一小，住了三個房間，連住了2晚。去之前包括剛剛在評論區都看到這家經常會給客人升級套房，但是我們沒有，而且我們散步發現各套房基本都是空的。怎麼説呢，不升級也沒問題，本分，但是我們好歹6間夜，給某個長輩升級一下，就會更超越期待。
酒店還不錯，但建議住一晚，還是比較偏，躺平的話～～酒店內可玩度一般，兩晚就沒什麼必要。
