msg:Location was good as it is near yucun village and in turn, the moganshan scenic area. There is however a severe dearth of information on how to get up / around the moganshan scenic area, and even asking the hotel staff didn‚Äôt seem to help. 

Given winter, there was close to nothing to do on the hotel compound. The hotel breakfast was as bad as the other reviews made it out to be (IMO, basically unpalatable). The bathroom / room also seemed to smell of sewage (perhaps due to lack of use over the winter period). 

No complaints about calling a golf cart to take us around the grounds. Was quick and easy. Staff were generally helpful. 

Not the easiest for non-mandarin speakers. Wouldn‚Äôt be a repeat stay for me.

We had an English speaking customer representative, Rachel, which was great because she helped us order a buggy whenever needed and also answered other practical questions. 
The only part which was more complicated was the service at the western restaurant, we waited a very long time for our food and there were a lot of misunderstandings‚Ä¶ but otherwise I fully recommend staying at this hotel!

There were lots of activities for children including horse riding which our daughter loved. The only disappointment was the breakfast. The buffet was poor, with a focus on quantity over quality. The other restaurant food (Chinese and Western) was nice, though it would help if all menus were translated into English. Overall a nice stay!

Although the weather was not good, it rained for a few days during our stay, and activities such as water sports, off-road go-karts, and outdoor adventures could not be carried out. However, I still experienced equestrian, high-altitude net formation, archery and other projects... The children loved it!
The hotel service is very warm and thoughtful, especially the housekeeper Emilyüëç. After check-out, the hotel also gave you a beautiful souvenir.

You need to call in advance or ask the housekeeper to help call a car. The environment is very good, and they also helped us upgrade the room. Because the room is relatively high, you need to take 4 elevators to the room, which is very convenient. There is an infinity pool, but the weather is not very hot. The housekeeper Ciyou is very considerate and sent tips and activities as soon as you check in. If there are new activities, they will also inform you in time, so I saw a drone show on the big lawn yesterday. The hotel also prepared some small gifts for the children. Overall it is still very good!

The overall service is OK, and the waiter on the shuttle bus is more enthusiastic and will take the initiative to introduce the hotel's attractions and facilities. The two-day vacation is generally satisfactory, but it is a pity that when I checked out, I called a taxi. The taxi call was always busy for 10 minutes and I couldn't get through.

They took travel photos and the photographer was also good. Although the breakfast was not at the five-star level, it was still good. But here comes the problem: I don't know why there are always bugs and moths in the room. They almost crawled into the bed at night, which scared me so much that I didn't dare to sleep. I killed at least 10 moths, but there were still some (I didn't dare to open the door or window the whole time). Later, I finally found the reason: the gap at the entrance was too big, and the moths tried their best to get into the room as soon as they saw the light. This kind of inadequate handling of details affects the experience too much. The overall experience actually feels that there are no activities suitable for middle-aged and elderly people. It is a bit inconsistent with the price, and the catering is not open. There is still a certain gap between the level of detail handling and management and international hotel management, and I hope to continue to improve.

Catering: The Banshan restaurant is not open either. Afternoon tea can only be eaten in the lobby on the first floor of the main building. The experience is not good. In fact, it feels better to drink tea under the light rain;
Travel: Go by car. The Moganshan section is a bit difficult to drive. When you enter the hotel, the golf cart will be on call. You can walk to Yucun in 10 minutes and contact the concierge David in advance on WeChat for instructions. You can also call in advance. hail a cab;
Facilities: The mountain mirror room has been upgraded, and the facilities are still good, except that the large bathtub does not have a disposable bathtub cover;

The official publicity activities of the hotel focus on introducing the activities inside, but the management is not together. The reservation phone number given can never be dialed, and you can only walk to the door of the base to make a reservation; 3.

In general, it is suitable for lying down or playing at the exploration base at the door by yourself. If you bring a baby, this management is a disaster!

msg:#Weekend Bamboo Forest Deep Breathing #Good Mountains, Good Waters, Good Scenery #Live in the Scenery Healing Scenery Moganshan Jun'anli Resort Hotel is a wonderful experience worth visiting twice! ! The hotel environment is large and beautiful, and it is a small scenic spot in itself. Even if you don't go to the nearby scenic spots, it is enough to just visit, relax and play in the hotel. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, drink tea and stroll in the bamboo forest, tea garden, small bridge, and stream. It is an excellent holiday experience! The hotel service must be praised. The scooter is available on call. The hotel butler David is considerate, in place, and immediate. During the stay, it rained and was not suitable for the original scenic spot. Divid specially provided us with a route suitable for self-driving sightseeing. In short, Jun'anli is a good start for the May Day holiday (2024.04.29-30) [Chin][StarEyes][Cute]

The housekeeper Ciyou was very responsible and considerate. In short, the service must be said to be very good. The overall environment is also very good. It's the first time I stayed in a hotel in the mountains. The car picked me up and dropped me off. You need to wait a while during peak hours. We mainly went out to play this time, so we didn't experience much in the hotel.

Watching the candlelight in the twilight
The sound of frogs, birds and rain comes and goes
People are so insignificant in nature
And people are so happy in nature...The hotel's supporting services are thoughtful. Here I would like to mention that Emily, as the hotel's life housekeeper, is very considerate and patient in helping us solve problems.

He remembered that we had asked for a few more bottles of water on the first day of our stay, so he put a few more bottles in the room the next day. The battery car that took us to the parking lot parked directly next to our car without much prompting, which was amazing. The pickled spring bamboo shoots in the restaurant breakfast were really the tenderest I've eaten this year. The only thing was that the weather was not ideal and we didn't see the sunrise or sunset.

msg:The pros and cons of this hotel are obvious. The advantage is that it has a huge area. There are many places to play in go-karts, equestrians, and adventure parks. There are also many parent-child activities on the large lawn in the hotel.

The disadvantage is that the number of public areas in the hotel does not match the number of guest rooms. The problem is that a large number of guests have no seats during breakfast and have to sit on the terrace. It happened to be a big drop in temperature on the day we checked in, so it was crowded with people eating, and many people had to go outside to endure the cold.

Because the hotel is large, you need a shuttle bus to go everywhere. This has its pros and cons. It's not bad if you're willing to walk around. However, it's really cold to take the shuttle bus for more than ten minutes during breakfast and at night.

As for the rooms, the room we stayed in was quite refreshing and had a balcony with a mountain view. But the quality of the hardware facilities is at the level of 4 stars or ordinary 5 stars, which cannot be said to be very good.

It is a family vacation choice with obvious advantages and disadvantages.

Check-in at the hotel is quite convenient, and there is a car to send to the room. All the drivers are the kind of people who know nothing and have a cold attitude!
Many restaurants in the resort are closed. There is only one Chinese restaurant and a noodle restaurant. There is no spa, and there is no indoor swimming pool. It is really speechless.
The butler service added WeChat and gave some basic help. It was very ordinary.
The Wi-Fi on the first day was still usable. The Wi-Fi on the second day was completely broken. The signal in the mountain was not good. I wanted to hold an online meeting, but I couldn‚Äôt do it. I asked the butler to solve it, but he just called a waiter to come over. He didn‚Äôt know anything at all.
The breakfast was also very bad. The environment was like a big cafeteria, and the food was only so-so.
The overall feeling is that the management of this hotel is very poor. Don‚Äôt come. You can go to Naked Valley in Moganshan, which has much better service than here.

Facilities: The facilities are well maintained, 90% new, hot water ‚ô®Ô∏è needs to be left for a little longer, the bathroom üõÄ is super large, the dehumidification is quite good, although it is halfway up the mountain, but the quilt does not feel damp and sleeps very comfortably.

Hygiene: Overall, it is acceptable, but the details may need to be improved, and my baby likes to get into corners and will touch a hand of dust.

Environment: The environment is very comfortable and relaxing, a good place to bring children! But pay attention to a mosquito problem, and there is no division between big and small friends. Parents must keep an eye on their young babies. My baby was tripped and knelt on by a fat boy in his 10s. Fortunately, I went to the hospital for an ultrasound and there was no internal bleeding, but the huge bruise on the waist and abdomen was very distressing.

Service: The overall service is very good. When you come here, you will find that all kinds of equipment you bring are redundant, and you can borrow them at the play center! I have to praise the housekeeper Ciyou, who upgraded our room in advance and contacted workers to help me install a baby guardrail. Basically, he responded to every request. When the baby was stepped on, he provided the address of the nearest hospital.

Although there are not many activities for children to play this season, fortunately the weather was good both days and it was fun to run around on the big lawn.
There are activities on the lawn on Saturdays. Children have fun playing drums, boxing, throwing sandbags, and balancing boards. The children's play center can borrow kites, badmintons, frisbees, small planes, etc., and you can sign up for some courses~
There are currently only two restaurants. The breakfast is rich in both buffet and set menu. There are also many farmhouses in the surrounding area~it is convenient to eat or take out~
It‚Äôs a pity that there is no animal park or fruit and vegetable picking this season. The discovery is overall too expensive and the cliff pool is too cold outdoors, otherwise it would be more fun üòÇ

msg:The hotel is very large and very private. Basically, you need a shuttle bus to go to every site. If the weather is good, you can also hike. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk upgraded us to a mountain king room with a great view, which was very nice.
1. Environment. It is lush and green, with a high vegetation coverage. As soon as you enter the hotel, you feel relaxed and forget about your fatigue.
2. Room. The toiletry set provided in the room is from diptyque. It smells amazing and I asked for a set when I checked out. The bedding is so comfortable, especially the pillows, I really want to lie in bed all the time.
3. Hygiene. The hygienic conditions here, both in terms of dining and accommodation, are very good. I usually use alcohol spray when entering a hotel. This hotel has been disinfected, so you can stay at ease.
4. Catering. The hotel has a Chinese restaurant and a noodle shop. We ate at both of them. The Chinese restaurant specializes in Cantonese cuisine, so you can try the Fairy Noodle House! I ate here twice during my stay and it was so delicious.
Next time I plan to take my parents to experience it, it will be an absolutely relaxing trip. It is recommended that you stay for 2 nights so that you will not be too rushed. We stayed one night and didn't go to the afternoon tea or the swimming pool, which was a bit regretful.

The hotel is very large, with various areas scattered among the mountains. It is also very convenient to arrange special car transfers within the hotel. The front desk service is very enthusiastic. Although winter is the off-season, there are many facilities for fun in the hotel. I experienced some travel photography and it turned out to be very beautiful. There were yoga classes and meditation classes at the top of the mountain in the evening, and I had a lot of exchanges with the teachers.
Near the hotel is Yu Village, which is very convenient if you want to eat or buy souvenirs. The distribution center is not far away, and it is also convenient if you want to go to the Mogan Mountain Scenic Area.
Special thanks to the housekeeper Tiancha. The service was very attentive during the past few days of my stay. My parents are very satisfied with the living environment. The travel experience is inseparable from the living experience. My parents are very happy this time whether it is eating, traveling or sightseeing. All in all a great experience.

The price of the group purchase was much cheaper than the original price, and the room type was upgraded for free. I read the reviews before, and they were both good and bad. They said the food was not good, the shuttle bus was too slow, etc. I was always worried! But I feel very good about my stay this time. David's service is very good and all the staff are warm and polite! This time we came to the lobby for breakfast, which was divided into five major areas. The breakfast categories were complete and the taste was pretty good! It‚Äôs understandable that the shuttle bus may be slower occasionally when there are so many people! The hotel is super big, with a large outdoor lawn. Many people come with children, and there are cars to pick them up and back. It is super quiet at night without the noise of the city. The parking lot is very large, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about parking at all. There are not many charging parking spaces. It is recommended to add more parking spaces in the future! Toiletries, free snacks, fruits, tea, coffee, small sugar, etc. are very complete! The decoration design of the room is simple and elegant. The key point is that there is no smell at all. It is very comfortable to stay. I will bring my children back again if I have the opportunity in the future! A small gift was given when checking out!

When I was choosing a hotel, I saw that Jun'anli was good, and the price/performance ratio was the same as last year. The Naked Valley where I live is much higher, but after checking the reviews on Xiaohongshu, there are still some criticisms... After struggling with it, I still made the decision. This time I stayed in a three-bedroom villa. From the time I checked in at the front desk to the final check-out, the experience was perfect. I would also like to express my special thanks to Shao Xiaomei (our housekeeper) for her sunny smile and meticulous care every day, which made us feel... Incomparable warmth... Of course, the service guys from the manager to the pick-up and drop-off staff are also extremely enthusiastic and try their best to meet all our needs... Such a hotel must be so easy to criticize...

1/Because the hotel is very large and requires shuttle buses, I hoped to ‚ûïthe housekeeper‚Äôs WeChat account to facilitate booking a shuttle bus, but they only added me after I called the front desk 4 times.
2/The shuttle bus never came according to the scheduled time. Every time, we were waiting for the bus instead of the bus waiting for us.
3/Breakfast! Breakfast was eaten at a really delicious restaurant. The breakfast at such an expensive hotel is not as good as that of ordinary chain hotels. And when we went there at about 8:30, we were told that the small wontons were the last bowl (please, breakfast ends at 10:00, not at 8:30). It‚Äôs not that I insisted on eating the small wontons, it‚Äôs just that the others were not delicious and not worth it at all. There is too little variety and the quality is very poor.
4/Drinking afternoon tea at Genting Restaurant, the figs were basically underripe and the cake was not tasty.
5/The housekeeper told me that he also felt that the hotel was not worth it, and then asked me not to affect my mood? excuse me? I paid but didn't get good service and asked me not to affect my mood...
Look at the chat history, I'm really speechless

Before check-in, David, the hotel's forest consultant, added me on WeChat and informed me of the hotel's activities and opening hours in advance, as well as the hotel's location. After checking in, he took the initiative to tell me what to pay attention to. After checking out, I gave the children a small gift. The service was very considerate.
Access to the hotel is by battery car, and any staff member can help call one. There are many cars, so even during peak hours such as breakfast and check-out, the waiting time will not be long. The large lawn is a paradise for children. You can go to the children's play center to borrow Frisbees, footballs, etc. These rentals are also free. The hotel's horse riding activities are quite interesting. After using the coupon, the price is 298 yuan for 15 minutes. You must make a reservation in advance, otherwise the queue time on site will be quite long. The hotel's breakfast was a failure. It was eaten in a large venue and was very basic.

It is a large enough area, whether it is to enjoy every step or experience outdoor projects, there is no way to play it all without visiting it five, six, seven or eight times. The housekeeper for this stay is Zoey. Messages are returned instantly and she is online at any time. It‚Äôs great!

After going through the lockdown, lifting the lockdown, extending the coupons, and refunding the coupons, I continued to stock up.

The entire resort is very large, and it is parked in the parking lot at the gate, so you have to rely on üõ∫ to pick you up and drop off every place in the resort. This time I stayed in the 88-square-meter sky garden panoramic suiteüòçüíØ! Simply great value! View is amazing! We went to a Western restaurant for afternoon tea and a noodle shop to eat noodles.

msg:Jun'anli, a place of peace of mind: I was lucky enough to choose a suitable hotel when I visited Moganshan for the first time. The guest room is large, and you can see the mountain peaks and the early morning clouds outside the window. The air is fresh and sweet, and you always want to take a few more breaths. The hotel's children's play center, large lawn, water sports, and discovery park can meet the needs of different guests. The products of the wheat noodle restaurant are also unexpectedly delicious (it seems to be open only at noon). The location of the hotel is only about 1km from the center of Yucun. It is very convenient to drive or walk. It is suitable for going out to have a meal, shopping and hanging out in the evening. This is much more convenient than the aloof Naked Valley and Fort. Special thanks to the hotel‚Äôs butler Tiancha for his attentive and enthusiastic service. He sent the hotel‚Äôs detailed information and clothing precautions before departure (the temperature difference between morning and evening in the mountains is large, much colder than outside). He also provided attentive service during our stay, allowing us to have this wonderful experience. The most enjoyable vacation experience around Shanghai in several years!

The day before departure, the hotel housekeeper inquired whether there were elderly or children traveling, prepared children's supplies, and was contacted by the housekeeper. The service of the housekeeper "Xiao Zhang" was very considerate.
Free golf cart pick-up and drop-off service: All room trips in the hotel are picked up and dropped off by golf carts. Children like it very much. In short, it is more suitable for parent-child travel. It is also a pet-friendly hotel, and cute dogs can be seen everywhere.

Considering that the service of the hotel housekeeper Ciyou and the hotel battery car staff are very good, I decided to give it a good review. However, the hotel's breakfast is really not up to this five-star standard. The breakfast is actually a meal placed on a temporary table in a conference hall. The taste and variety are also very average. Furthermore, it has been raining in the past few days, and many of the hotel's activities are unavailable. Basically, you can only watch the rain in the room.

The view was much better, but it was hard to catch a nap from the moment we checked in.
After checking in, the bedding was not hygienic. When we opened the bed, there were hairs, and the response to changing the sheets was very slow. Fortunately, we brought the bedding and changed it ourselves.
I was going to have an outdoor barbecue, but they said they wouldn't accept reservations. Later, my friend waited in line for a long time and said that the reservations were full and they wouldn't be allowed to line up.
After kayaking in the hotel for 40 minutes per person, we charged the room bill. The service staff even charged the cost of water purchased by others to our room bill...
A hotel that cannot be described in words
In short, the service is not worthy of the price. We booked it well in advance for less than 2,000 a night. Other guests may have higher prices. The only luck is that I traveled with a friend and his family, and my mood was not affected by the hotel.

Although the hotel opened in 15 years, it is well maintained and the facilities are relatively new. Booked on Ctrip, the hotel had a butler to connect with us the day before check-in. WeChat was added to facilitate butler-style service throughout the stay. Our butler, Mr. Dai, was very enthusiastic and responsive, and he was very responsive to various needs. The hotel can order takeout, and as long as it is delivered to the front desk, a car will help deliver it to the room. This service must be praised üëç, it is so user-friendly. Since we checked in on the last day of the holiday, we upgraded the room very considerately, giving customers a good check-in experience.
I really like the Sky Garden Panoramic Suite. You can overlook the entire mountain view at 270 degrees. The entire hotel is like a natural oxygen bar in the forest, with gurgling water, full of stars, open garden and green trees.
Take a nap here for three to five days to cleanse your lungs. You can definitely relax your body and mind and start anew.

From check-in to check-out, the hotel staff's attitude was very good; the room was very clean. Although the hotel was basically full during National Day, the room was very quiet because the rooms were far apart.
The hotel features parent-child activities. During my stay, I basically played in the hotel and experienced hosting (3.5 hours and a half day, covering ecological hiking, wilderness survival, roasted sweet potatoes, and kayaking), 12 kilometers of cycling, go-karts, floral paper, and discovery park There are plenty of activities including high-altitude grids, evening outdoor movies, daytime lawn activities, cliff swimming, etc.
The hotel's breakfast is on the big lawn. It has basically all the Chinese and Western options. Although the occupancy rate is very high during the National Day, there are basically no queues for breakfast. The freshly made wontons and noodles are delicious and recommended.
Except that it's a little expensive to check in on November 1, everything else is very good!

What I like about resort hotels is that the hotel is large enough. If it rains, you can spend the day just walking around in the hotel. After breakfast, you can walk slowly to the reservoir, then walk from the reservoir to your room, take a rest and then swim in the cliff pool. If you want to swim, you can walk to Yucun for dinner, which only takes 20 minutes.
Although the hotel is large, there are many shuttle buses. You can call in the room to request a bus in advance, and you can also stop at any time while standing on the roadside.
The hotel's breakfast is quite rich in variety, and the afternoon tea desserts are average. My husband also used the free paddle board for booking. There are many lifeguards in the boarding area to provide a sense of security. The instructor also carefully explained the precautions before entering the water. In the hotel Other entertainment items are chargeable, including hiking on Chashan Mountain, but it happens to be a rainy day so you can save money.
I almost forgot that they are a pet-friendly hotel. They also gave us a mug from the hotel‚Äôs mascot, Corgi, when checking out. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt choose to drive with my dog. It was so beautiful to imagine the dog running on the lawn.
Except for the fact that the door lock of the balcony sliding door is broken and it is difficult to open the door, there are no other flaws. I hope the restaurant can be improved!

The hotel is in a good location, only about a 10-minute drive from Gengcun Square and the Distribution Center, making it convenient for travel! If you don‚Äôt want to go out to play, just contact the butler Yuki to make a reservation, and he can help you make a reservation! The housekeeper Yuki is so considerate and provides good service!

msg:Room: This is the second time I have come to Jun'anli. I stayed at Haitang Villa before. This time I chose the sky garden. The panoramic 270-degree glass floor-to-ceiling windows are very good. I live on the 5th floor. There is only one room on the whole floor, with a large sky terrace, which is a pity I didn‚Äôt see the sky full of stars this time, I hope to go there again next time.

Service: Full shuttle service. You can call a car no matter which area you go to. It will be on call very quickly. The hotel staff can help call a taxi, and you can also make calls in the room. I asked for water, ice cubes, and disposable bathtub bags in the room, and they were delivered quickly. The bathtub bag is very careful and considerate. I bought it myself and forgot to bring it for the baby to play with water. Because I have mysophobia, I asked the hotel for a mop, but the waiter helped me mop it again, so my baby could crawl around on the floor without worry.

Bathtub: It‚Äôs definitely my favorite big bathtub.

Swimming pool: Cliff-edge swimming pool. If your baby is too young, you should be able to experience it next time.

Special thanks to the housekeeper: Sometimes it is inconvenient for the baby to make a phone call when he is sleeping, and he often troubles the housekeeper, who will reply me very carefully and quickly, thank you very much. On the day of check-out, because the baby needed to take a nap, they helped postpone the room until 2 pm!

When I open my eyes, everything is green. The room is deep in the mountains. Love it!

msg:One day at the end of August, we came to "Moganshan Jun'anli" again. This is the 10th time in the past two or three years. We have experienced spring, summer, autumn and winter, tea, peaches, pears and chestnuts (all have been picked)... This comment should be made with emotion.
        First of all, the environment is really good: surrounded by mountains, full of greenery, streams, reservoirs, tea mountains, orchards, and a huge variety of recreational items (go-karts, handcrafts, kayaks, archery, shrimp fishing, horseback riding, outdoors) Swimming pool, etc., there is also a Discovery Park), the green lawn is loved by everyone, it is a first-class choice for leisure and vacation [strong]
        Secondly, there is nothing to say about the quality of living: I have lived in villas, sky garden rooms, and mountain view rooms, and I feel good [strong], the rooms are large, well lit, the layout is reasonable, the details are in place, the supplies are high-end, and the facilities are complete. I like the big circle shaped bathtub and spacious public areas, each balcony has a different view.
        ...As a result, we have enthusiastically recommended this hotel to many friends over the years, bringing them to stay and play, and then they followed suit...
        However, this time I also had an unpleasant experience, focusing on the service and service connection: First, I was sleepy and tired at noon. I had been waiting for the room to be cleaned for more than an hour and a half, but I was waiting for the room card to be delivered from the front desk to the Mai The noodle shop took more than 20 minutes at this distance, and this efficiency is questionable; the second is to go to the Chinese restaurant for dinner, and as soon as I come up, I tell the front desk of the restaurant to help send the bathrobe to the restaurant (due to the sudden drop in temperature, I will go back to the room and take a car (cold), I had to rush a few times, but it didn‚Äôt arrive until I checked out, and it took nearly an hour and a half! This speed of response and quality of service seriously diminished our enjoyment of going on vacation, and partly offset our good impression of "Gunanli".
        Considering that there may be too many tourists in the peak season, the workload of the service staff is too heavy, and the waiters are not easy, etc., we did not choose to complain... But we hope that "Junanli" can maintain the corresponding service level, and don't disappoint those who like it [ Smile][Hold fists]

The hotel environment is very good, the scenery is very beautiful, the area is large, the whole trip is picked up by shuttle bus, and the cliff swimming pool is also very beautiful. We booked a Mountain Mirror King Room and paid a small price difference to directly upgrade to a Sky Garden King Room. When we arrived, the room was amazing and great value for money.
I went to Yunding Restaurant in the evening. It tasted very good and my son liked it very much. The hotel is very close to Yucun. It took a few minutes to take a taxi and check in to the nearby Goldfish Mom Internet celebrity store.
Overall, I am very satisfied. However, the hotel's entertainment facilities are not very cost-effective and there are not many people playing. I hope they can be improved in the future.

In particular, I would like to like the butler's sweet tea. I took the initiative to communicate one day in advance and sent various project introductions. During the stay in the hotel, I answered all questions and arranged appoin**ents in a timely manner.
The entire hotel is characterized by full functions and rich projects. It can meet various needs such as closeness to nature, relaxation, adventure entertainment, casual dining, etc. without going out of the hotel. It is very relaxing to stay for a few days. The infinity pool on the top of the mountain is hidden among the reeds.
The rooms are all in the mountains, with a quiet environment. You need to call the shuttle bus in the hotel to go up and down the mountain. It is very convenient and does not need to wait for a long time. After nightfall, listening to the chirping of insects in the mountains, smelling the fragrance of the bamboo forest, and seeing the stars when you look up, it is an unforgettable natural experience.

There are six mountains and one reservoir in the hotel, referred to as six mountains and one water. The lawn in the hotel is also very large. It is suitable for having fun with children. The rooms are located in various parts of the mountain, and you need a shuttle bus to pick you up, and the response time is very fast. If there is no shuttle bus, it will take quite a long time.

Hygiene: The overall is very clean. At first, I was worried that it would be damp and musty in the mountains. The rooms are equipped with dehumidifiers.

Facilities: The supporting facilities are relatively complete, and the decoration of the room is simple and a**ospheric that I like.

Environment: Mosquitoes are unavoidable in the mountains and summer. The room is equipped with essential oils, so those with babies must do a good job of insect control.

Service: The housekeeper David, a very young guy who connected us, did not expect to have a good sense of service. Responsive to every request during the stay, the reply was very timely.
For breakfast, I think it's a bit shabby. It is a glass room on the edge of the lawn, and there are often flies and flying insects flying around during meals.

msg:The main focus of the environment is nature, but I don‚Äôt feel that I ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the nature of the hotel. Basically, the design of the hotel is for the purpose of taking pictures, only the check-in points are good-looking, and the other feelings are mediocre. The swimming pool on the mountain is very nice to take pictures, but very Small. Although there were not many swimmers in the past, there were only about 3-4 families, but it felt like there was not much space left.

The room looks clean, but compared to other five-star hotels, the space is still relatively small. At the beginning, it was said that the room was upgraded for free, but to go to a far and high-rise place, you need to climb several stairs. Although some places have hands There are escalators, but one of the escalators is still broken. It is very inconvenient to climb up and down to enter and exit the guest room every time. If there is an elderly person accompanying me, I can't imagine what will happen.

There is nothing special about the parent-child project. There are fewer choices for discovery. Basically all the projects must be paid. Even hiking costs 98 yuan per person. When I saw a horse nearby, I didn‚Äôt want to take pictures with the horse. I originally asked the children to report I went to the nature camp, asked the steward before participating, and told us honestly that no one would participate. We deliberately arranged time to wait, and finally found that only my child participated, so we had to cancel. If the steward honestly told us that no one participated in this project, We can arrange other shows without wasting time.

The buffet breakfast looks cheap, and the environment is very ordinary. Before going home, I went to the Chinese restaurant for lunch. There were only three tables of guests, but we had to wait for at least half an hour, and the tea was not offered to us. The service was not in place. But the taste It is indeed still good.

I was looking forward to staying in this hotel to experience the nature and hotel facilities and services, but overall I feel very dissatisfied with the experience.

Chinese food is indeed a little bit worse, the price is not cheap, and the taste and portion of the dishes are average.
The large lawn in the hotel is good, and the infinity pool in the guest room area is also very good. In addition, the outdoor expansion of discovery is suitable for walking children.

msg:The first time I came to Moganshan, I booked Jun'anli quite well. Before I came, I received a confirmation call from the hotel, and asked to add the housekeeper. The housekeeper, Niko, is a girl with a sweet smile. It makes people feel good at the first sight. The two-day service is timely. , thoughtful and professional. The weather is not beautiful. It has been raining for three days after staying in the hotel. There are battery cars going to and from the hotel. There is basically no waiting, and the response speed is very fast. I stayed in a room on the 2nd floor of Building 2. It took three elevators to get down from the battery car to the room. Due to the rain, the elevator broke down two elevators. We had no psychological expectations for this. We added a lot of luggage from the previous hotel. It was raining, the escalator was broken, and the luggage was heavy. We brought a toddler, and we could imagine the embarrassment and hardship. I was dissatisfied at the time. The rain was an irresistible factor. I can understand that the elevator was broken and could not be repaired in time, but I can help me arrange other rooms when I check in. Fortunately, we met the aunt who cleaned the room when we were in the second elevator, and she helped me with some luggage. There was a small incident that night. When I checked in, there was only one room card. When I left the room, my husband took the electricity card by mistake. I contacted the housekeeper, and the aunt came to open the door soon. My good impression of the hotel comes from the housekeeper and aunt. So if you plan to come to live, firstly, it is not recommended to bring too much and heavy luggage. Second, if you bring it, tell the front desk to discuss whether you can arrange a suitable room. Thirdly, the power card in the room is not a room card. The scenery of the hotel is impeccable. Opening the window, the green mountains and green mountains come into view, and the mood is very comfortable. The room is comfortable, with a shower and a bathtub, and a bath bag is prepared in the bathtub, which is a little surprise. As other reviews said, the breakfast didn't quite match the quality of the hotel, but the hotel service staff still tried their best to give the guests a good feeling. The next day, they gave tremella soup for breakfast. Although it was too sweet, it was appreciated. Breakfast is acceptable if you lower your expectations. Recommend the 588 set meal at Taojian Chinese Restaurant. If you like local dishes, every dish is very suitable for your taste. I especially like the soy sauce river prawns and fried rice. The river prawns are so delicious that we ordered another one. The Chinese restaurant can reserve a place in advance with the housekeeper, but the location is not very good when we go late.

You can have a golf cart waiting at the door of the building when you make a phone call. In terms of service, except for the butler before check-in. After solving some problems, the emergency handling and service attitude of the front desk also made up for it a lot. The cleaning lady, the shuttle bus guy, the swimming pool guy, and the waiters in the restaurant were all very enthusiastic. In terms of rooms, the rooms in the mountain mirror are all on a relatively high slope. Unfortunately, there is a tree at the door of the room that blocks the view, but the air in the mountains is still good. In terms of breakfast, there are many choices, but the conditions and sanitation of the big lawn are a little bit worse, I hope to improve~

msg:More than three thousand a night, I feel very wronged
Butler service: very good, timely response.
Dining: a mess. On the first night, the three of us spent more than 700 yuan on BBQ. There were not many varieties of grilled food, and the delivery was too slow. We ate several skewers of undercooked skewers. The next day's breakfast was really worth complaining about. The fruit and salad dishes were exactly the same as those on the BBQ last night, which made it hard not to think about it. The one pot stew is the same as the northern team meal. The butter does not add ice cubes, and it is exposed to the sun, and it is really disgusting to open. There are no knives and forks on the table, how can people eat bread and butter? I haven't seen such a breakfast product in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai in five years. Not to mention the restaurant service, it's a mess. It can be said that the catering here does not pay attention to the production or the form, which is a failure.
Guest room: Don‚Äôt fix the broken toilet curtains, and don‚Äôt check before the peak season? The bathtub in the room has been used for many years, so I didn't dare to soak it. USB charging is extremely slow. Such an expensive room rate, the mini bar is not free. And the welcome fruits are all the cheapest varieties, which is really down-to-earth!
Hygiene: It's okay, the cleaning lady is very hard.
Entertainment experience: Discovery is about to close down, right? The staff are listless and like errands. The price/performance ratio is very, very low, not to mention the 88 yuan ticket for parents, there is nothing to enter, and there is nowhere to buy water. The hot air balloon project takes no more than 3 minutes to go up and down, and the charge is as fast as 300, which is also jaw-dropping. JE hosting is not bad, the children had a good time.

But it's much better than being a special soldier and going to popular attractions, hiding in the mountains and lying flat for a few days. The butler, Piaomiao GRACE, is very considerate and responsive to any request, and after arranging for an aunt or someone else to deal with it, she will follow up with her to see if it is resolved in a timely manner. She is very responsible. The only thing is that I waited for a long time for the room when I checked in. I waited for almost 3 hours before checking in. I walked around the whole resort while waiting. However, because it is a long holiday, it is understandable that there are not enough manpower. We live in the sky garden room, which is almost the tallest building, with a large garden terrace, the scenery is invincible, and you can basically have a panoramic view of the entire county. The whole family is very satisfied, and it is worth recommending. In addition, it seems that both Youth Travel Notes and Running Man come here to record or program.

It is suitable for family travel, but it may be due to the end of the epidemic in Hong Kong. Not all restaurants are open, and it is said that they will open after May Day. It's not peak season after all. The housekeeper, Xiaojie, is very kind and responds quickly, answering every question. If there is a chance next time, I will choose here again.

It left a very good impression on our family. If there is a need, it will be delivered to the room in time. I have been greeting me on WeChat for various needs, super nice! Next time I come, I will still find him!
naked Castle is the beauty on the top of the mountain, and Junanli is the beauty in the valley. They are different. Junanli is much bigger than naked Castle. You need to take the shuttle bus from the hotel to go everywhere. The best thing is that it is pet-friendly! Let my grandma take her beloved dog out for a trip together. The hotel also has a lot of thoughtful things for pets, 300 yuan for a dog cleaning fee~ There are also many things to play. This time I experienced go-karts and paddle boards~next Come back to experience more activities when you have time

What is more disappointing is the catering part. Currently, only one building is open for catering services in the off-season. Others with good views are closed. Afternoon tea has also been moved to the crowded glass room next to the lawn. There are few types of breakfast and it is arranged in a strange hall. On Sunday, a group of people crowded into the Chinese restaurant on the fourth floor to queue up for breakfast because wedding guests booked this hall. The scene was once very chaotic. However, there is a style street not far from the hotel, and there is a lot of food. You can also order takeaway into the room, and the service staff will be very enthusiastic to help deliver it to the room.

When you call the car at dinner time, you are seated by people in other rooms when you go out. Wait. It lasted about 20 minutes. During this period, there were empty cars going back and forth.

Eat: The hotel has a small noodle restaurant. The food in this noodle restaurant is really delicious. I recommend pork liver noodles and shepherd‚Äôs purse casserole wontons, which will amaze you. The hotel‚Äôs breakfast is really so-so, and there are few varieties for people to eat.
Service: I focused on the service. After I made the reservation, the hotel will call me to arrange a butler for me.

The view of the arranged room is also excellent. , but there were some episodes in which we needed to change rooms, he finally helped us upgrade the room and apologized at the door, and took us around the hotel the next day.

The hardware of the room is not good for the price. The twin room does not even have a bathtub, nor does it have a smart toilet. In winter, the buttocks of the toilet are cold to death.
Many facilities were closed during the New Year's Eve, and the restaurant only opened noodle shops and Chinese restaurants. Breakfast was eaten in a banquet hall. The tablecloths dragged on the floor and the chairs without seat covers seemed to be made temporarily. Stayed for two days, and the breakfast on the second day was richer than the previous day.
Let‚Äôs talk about the swimming pool. It is said that it is open on 567 on the week, but it takes a long time to heat it up. The temperature is only 28 degrees during the day on Friday and it is impossible to swim. Now that you know it's going to be open, why don't you heat it up in advance. And the swimming pool is very small, and only 1.3m.
The hotel has a large lawn, and you can rent penalty ball games, etc., but there is no indoor children's playground. So winter is not particularly friendly.
Most activities require a fee. There are no small animals, no helicopters and hot air balloons in winter.
The hotel's Chinese restaurant and noodle restaurant taste pretty good. Generally speaking, it is not suitable to come in winter. There are too many hotels to choose from at the same price, and there is no advantage.

I stayed in Jun'anli for four days and three nights. The housekeeper Xiao Jiang's service is kind and meticulous, and the other service staff are also warm and friendly. The whole stay experience is very good!
The only thing that needs to be improved is the breakfast part. Maybe there were not many guests when we checked in. The original self-service was changed to an order system. Since the day of check-out was Friday, it was changed back to self-service, but the cut-off time for meals was changed from 10:00 Half changed to ten o'clock, and no one notified, and the waiter quickly removed the food almost as soon as the o'clock arrived, regardless of whether there were guests picking up the food. As a resort hotel, this is not humane enough, and I hope it can be improved !
In addition to breakfast, the products of the normal order in the Chinese restaurant are quite amazing, and it is worth a try.

In terms of dining, perhaps due to the policy of opening up just now, several restaurants are not open, only the Chinese restaurant in the main building is open, but fortunately, the overall level of the restaurant is online, and the price is moderate and reasonable. Recreational facilities may be in the off-season at this stage, only go-karts and outdoor lawns can be played, but in fact, leisure may be more important for family vacations. It may be better to fly a kite and watch the blue sky and white clouds in a daze, away from the hustle and bustle of the city and All kinds of introversion, be yourself here.

Breakfast ended at 10:00. There are few types of dishes and the taste is not good. It is no exaggeration to say that the breakfast in an economical chain hotel for two or three hundred and one nights is better than the quality here. And the restaurant is in a big conference room, it doesn't feel like a restaurant at all. There are no children's entertainment items in the hotel, and the few amu*****t facilities are also charged.

This time I deliberately booked the room early and made a note to travel with the elderly and children. However, when we arrived, we met the group and had to wait for a long time to check in. When we got to the room, we found that we had to walk down two floors. It rained on the first day and snowed on the second day. There was nothing to do. I sincerely recommend that you don‚Äôt choose weekends. I was speechless twice when I encountered that the team building staff were completely overwhelmed. There was a long queue for breakfast, and many people in the queue were complaining. But the staff are warm and friendly, especially the shuttle bus and room service people. It was raining and I wanted to go to the children's center, but it was a mess... Sigh, the Peak Coffee and the small animal park were closed. I feel like my parents didn‚Äôt experience anything this time. I really regret spending this money.

After we checked in, we took a battery car and shuttled through the valley. We arrived at a high point on the mountain and our room arrived. At our request to live in a high-rise building, the hotel helped us arrange a mountaintop room. Thank you very much. It couldn't be higher, and the beautiful scenery is unobstructed. The hotel arranged a drone show at 6pm. It was the first time to watch a drone show up close in the valley. It was really beautiful. After breakfast the next day, we walked to the infinity heated swimming pool on the top of the mountain. The water temperature of the outdoor swimming pool was 28 degrees in winter. Unfortunately, we had just recovered from a cold and had no chance to try it out. The housekeeper Xiaobai is very enthusiastic. From the time we checked in, we called a car, sent towels, etc., to the time we checked out, he responded to our requests and showed enthusiastic concern in every aspect. He sent blessings at night and said good morning in the morning. I really can't live without you. Thank you Jun Anli for accompanying our family to spend a perfect Chris**as.

msg:At the request of the housekeeper Xiaobai, I came here to give the hotel a good review. I have to say that if you choose to come to Moganshan in the off-season in January, there are indeed many activities that you can‚Äôt enjoy, and many restaurants are not open, but the weather is good for a few days. I still enjoy the beauty of the hotel. The hotel occupies a huge area, and I have to rely on golf carts to get around, but if I want to, I can enjoy the scenery along the way even if I don't want to. It's really pleasing to the eye. The room is well-prepared, without a bathtub, and the balcony faces north, but it is clean, warm and well-equipped. In terms of activities, the big lawn is the main venue for this event. You can rent balance cars, football frisbees, etc. for free, which can consume a lot of time, and because of the age limit for paid items, we chose two outdoor ones, elves and horseback riding, but It takes less than half an hour before and after each, and it can be considered as an experience. There is nothing to praise about food and beverages. In the off-season, there is not even a choice for breakfast, but you can drive a short distance to the town to eat local restaurants. There are many choices, delicious and cheap. In addition, the butler service provided by the hotel is very good. We asked the butler Xiaobai to help solve many problems this time

The hotel also has a lot of parent-child activities, and it is also very close to Yucun.
The Chinese restaurant in the hotel is also quite delicious, and the price is actually cheaper than some of the farm dishes we ate outside. It‚Äôs a pity that we ate at the end on the day we left, and regretted that we only ate once...
Breakfast is okay, but unfortunately the layout of the breakfast room is very similar to that of a budget hotel for group tours... The food itself is pretty good, my favorite is their shredded pickled vegetables and bamboo shoots + shredded mustard pork noodles
The hotel is very big, so we had to call the shuttle bus to get back to the room. Fortunately, there were not many people when we checked in, and the shuttle bus came in time.
The room itself was good in size and decoration. Our room also had an extra radiator, which was quite warm. The room my friend lived in didn't have a radiator and said it was a bit cold. The welcome fruits, minibar and toiletries are of good quality
The only small comment I have is that I hope the staff training can be more perfect. The staff's attitude is very good, but it seems that information between different depar**ents is not exchanged with each other. When I asked the staff near the front desk about parent-child activities, they didn't know. They still need us. Go to the activity room and ask...
Overall, I am very satisfied and would recommend it to families who need to walk their children~

msg:1. If you are in the mountains, it is suitable for people with a fast pace and nervous nerves in Shanghai to come and daze. Just in a daze, doing nothing. Or it is suitable for a group or multiple families to travel together. You can borrow a frisbee, football, and badminton (free) to play on the lawn as shown in Figure 4, which will be more exciting. To me it's boring, super boring, very boring. There are no activities at night, and it is not suitable for walking, because the mountains are dark and cold at night. During the day, there is nothing to do around, either to climb Mogan Mountain, and the hotel itself has relatively few entertainment activities. There is 180 twenty minutes of boating
(Figure 9), 180 eight-minute karting, 388 twenty-minute horseback riding. To be honest, the price is expensive, and you can play it for less than half the price outside. The cliff swimming pool on the top of the mountain is open on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The temperature is constant and you can play when the weather is good (remember to bring your swimsuit, if you buy it, it costs 200). In addition, there is a JOJO farm, which is relatively small and has few small animals. It is not open in winter. Generally speaking, many of them are not open in the off-season (because it is too cold to play), but they are not very playable when they are open in the peak season, because the attractions are relatively small and there are few things.
There is also a DISSCOVER adventure park here, which does not belong to the hotel, and it was closed when we went. If it is open, children with a height of more than 120cm can play, such as rock climbing and high-altitude ropes. There is a hot air balloon to play, and a helicopter to experience, it seems to be 688 yuan for 10 minutes. Nothing else, so it's boring.
2. It was off-season when I went there, but the people were okay. The hotel also upgraded the room. The accommodation is not bad. But the sound insulation is not good. When the air conditioner is turned on at night, the sound of the external unit of the air conditioner is very loud, and earplugs are useless. And it's useless to turn off the air conditioner (unless you turn it off both upstairs and downstairs). I can sleep well, so I can bear it. The hotel even sent a gift to apologize, but people who sleep lightly book carefully! ! Maybe everyone thinks it is noisy. When the air conditioner is turned off in the middle of the night, it is much quieter. When it is turned on again in the morning, it is woken up loudly.
3. The breakfast really has to complain, it is very barren. There are very few things to eat (just those in Figure 9). Compared to B&Bs, the breakfast is okay, but compared to hotels, especially in peak season, it costs more than 2,000 a night, which is seriously not worth it. I lived in Kaiyuan Senbo before, and it was only 800 including the water park, but there were many kinds of breakfast. Even the Giraffe Manor, which is about the same price, eats a little more than here (of course, the giraffe eats very little). I think this really needs to be improved.
3. The service is very good. They are very enthusiastic from the beginning of the reservation, and the exclusive butler can answer any questions (ours is Xiaojie). It is relatively quick to find the front desk to solve problems. You need a shuttle bus to travel, and it arrives relatively quickly (you need to wait for a while during peak hours). When you leave, the doll falls down and is sent to us.

Summary: The hotel's overall accommodation and facilities are good, and the service is also good and up to date. The food did not keep up with the standard of the hotel, which belongs to the standard of the hotel. Group play is good, but individuals are relatively boring (if I prefer to play), hotel prices and play facilities are generally expensive, and there are fewer things to play. The quietness is not as good as the giraffe, and there is not as much food and play as Senbo. But there is a big lawn here, which can hold weddings, team building, play, camping and playing cards at night. It depends on personal preference.

The hotel will let the housekeeper connect with the guests on WeChat before check-in. For a parent-child hotel, the main requirement is safety and convenience for bringing a baby. The required bed circumference, bathtub cover, and less stairs are all met. Thank you Xiaojie again. It is recommended that you think about whether you have any special requirements before you travel. It is always troublesome to buy or change houses temporarily.
Before I went to Moganshan, I always lived in B&Bs. In comparison, the advantage of Jun'anli is that there are sufficient natural scenery and recreational items, and it is also close enough to the center of Yu Village. It is very convenient to go out to eat, of course, only for self-driving.

msg:The resort has a beautiful environment and a large area, and the access depends on the shuttle bus, which can basically be on call. The housekeeper and other service staff are kind and ready to answer any questions. Breakfast is a buffet on weekends and a set menu in the middle of the week. The dining environment is average, but it is a bit crowded on weekends. It would be better if the dishes were more abundant.

msg:My little butler, Xiaobai, has kept in touch with me since the day before check-in, caring about the local climate when I arrived at the store, and sent a map of the park, an event schedule, and so on. There is a need to find Xiaobai! ! It was only when I left the store that I found out that Xiaobai had been quarantined... I was still working hard when I was not at work haha. In the middle of the night, I even called a car for me~ On the day of check-in, the program crew closed the big lawn and the coffee shop next to it. It‚Äôs a pity that I didn‚Äôt go in to play. In the evening, when I was riding a golf cart, the little brother passed by the lawn and let us down. Finally, it‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs a pity that it‚Äôs too dark. The boys in the golf cart are very fun. It‚Äôs also very convenient to chat in the car and call a car. You can contact the housekeeper Xiaobai and you can send a car to pick you up~ The housekeeper Xiaobai is online 24 hours a day, hard work! The hotel dog "Spiky" is so cute~ When I checked in, I asked him to walk over and pet me. When I left the store the next day, I left a scarf with my friends in the parking lot waiting for the news from the hotel. The front office manager Li Yingpeng who passed by saw us coming and asked if there was anything I needed to do. I called my colleagues and asked us to go to the front room for a rest. The news also gave us a gift, a pointy cup, and the aunt in the guest room also gave us a puppy ornament. The air on the mountain is good, and it is very comfortable to walk around at night and in the morning~ Recommended. But we must avoid some units to record programs that will affect the mood of the game~ Fortunately, the hotel staff are nice! You can confirm with the hotel in advance~

Whether you look out from the balcony or stroll around, the autumn light is long and very pleasant. The butler service is very considerate and humane, which is particularly commendable. Xiaojie and Hugo communicated very promptly and were always considerate of the guests when dealing with problems. I tried two restaurants, Zhenmeishi and Taojian, and the taste and service were both good, with some local specialties. This is a hotel I would like to visit next time I have the opportunity to go to Moganshan for vacation~

The key road is easy to drive, and it is only 1.5 kilometers to the nearby town. It is very convenient to eat and do nucleic acid. The outdoor Taoyuan of the hotel requires a battery car from the lobby to the room, otherwise it will take 40 minutes to walk. The environment along the way is very beautiful. The sudden drop in temperature was very depressing on a cloudy day. Unexpectedly, it started to snow the next day, and the haze was swept away. The room is big enough, the bath products are the recently popular Diptyque, the coffee is three and a half meals, the small refrigerator is coconut milk water deluxe, etc., and it is replenished every day, which is really a**ospheric. Let's talk about the service, from the reception staff to the cleaning lady, they are warm and serious, especially the butler Xiaojie, even when he is resting, he is responsive, calling for a car, asking questions, etc., must like it üëç When I left, I gave it to the hotel website Red puppy mug. I have to say that the vacation in the entire county was very pleasant, and I will definitely come again if I have the opportunity.

üåøHotel facilities: To tell you the truth, the hotel facilities of this specification are very general, there is no luggage rack, no coffee machine, and the layout of the room is also very general. The so-called kitchen has only 2 pots. The water in the pool takes a long time to warm up. The spare parts are diptyque, not bad. It is suggested that the hotel can improve the room facilities and enhance the guest's stay experience~
üçÅRoom hygiene: basically in place, the cleaning aunt is also very attentive to provide services~
üçÇHotel environment: This is the biggest selling point of the hotel, the environment is really good, especially in autumn, the colors in the mountains are so beautiful, and various entertainment facilities and activities are also very rich.
üåºHotel dining: The Chinese restaurant is very beautiful, the food is delicious, and there is no service charge. The breakfast is quite rich (maybe it has been improved due to too many negative reviews before), but the dining environment is a bit crowded. The wheat noodle restaurant in the hotel is worth trying~ There is also a western restaurant on the top of the mountain. We were not able to experience it because we went out to play. The overlooking environment is great! There are many restaurants around the hotel to choose from.
üåπGuest room assistant: I added the room assistant WeChat when I called the hotel to understand the epidemic prevention regulations before departure. Xiaobai, the room assistant of our group of 2 rooms, was very attentive. He asked the needs several times a day, and tried to meet üëç

When I went to find the hotel, it was good, except that I could see so many people during breakfast, and I didn't feel it when I lived there. I don't know if it's the season or the marathon. The breakfast was eaten in the big round house in Figure 4/5, not the grass fly version that received bad reviews in the comments. The variety is quite rich, and the meal time is also very touching. In line with the resort positioning. But to tell the truth, according to the hotel's usual pricing, it is a bit unscientific to charge such a high fee for various activities. Because the marathon cannot use the large lawn, reasonable compensation should be made to the hotel guests. Overall is still very good, good sound insulation, quiet, good equipment, rich minibar

The room is very large, and the configuration of the suite has a restaurant and a large balcony. The overall style is bamboo art, simple and stylish. The bedding is very comfortable, and you can sleep until dawn. The hotel's light meals are also good, worth trying.
There are also a few shortcomings. The first is the cross-country marathon, which occupies a large lawn, which makes it impossible to experience helicopters and hot air balloons, and the experience is somewhat discounted. Secondly, the entertainment items are concentrated during the day, and there are fewer entertainment items at night, so they can only stay in the room. Finally, the breakfast room is relatively small and slightly crowded.

msg:The overall environment and housing experience are not bad, let's talk about it first
The overall details are OK. The shampoo, shower gel, and body lotion are all diptyque. There are disposable bath bags, eye masks, earphones, and even cooling oil. The room I stayed in also had a kitchen. It was very convenient to cook noodles and wash fruits. There were a lot of snacks and fruits. The housing environment is very quiet. The Haitang room I lived in, because the reservation was early, I specially arranged a landscape room. The house has three floors. It is arranged on the third floor, with three households on the first floor, and the view is very good. Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the green coverage rate is particularly high. The shuttle bus to the breakfast shop and various places can be called within five minutes, and the overall service is very warm.

Then I said that it was not very good: when I made an appoin**ent, Ctrip specially noted that the baby‚Äôs birthday wanted an extra bed and a simple bed arrangement. As a result, I gave the wrong room card at the beginning, and I didn‚Äôt see the extra bed and arrangement. Finally, I replied that it was the wrong room. Card, the result is still very disappointing. As shown in Figure 9, I asked them to add a 1.2-meter bed. Finally, the reply said that it could not be added. At first, I didn't say that the smallest 95cm crib could not be added directly. This made the three-year-old baby How does the baby sleep? In the end, I asked my aunt to remove the bed, let‚Äôs talk about the layout, and directly ignored my needs. I made a note on Ctrip, and I called and confirmed with the front desk, but the information was not delivered in place, which made me very angry. He also said that he would supply me the next day. I arrived very late that day. I brought a dirty sleeping bag and made the bed. I definitely don‚Äôt want to move the next day, so I lost the sense of ritual üòÑ In order to compensate me, the hotel gave me a birthday cake and a kayak experience package for two people. If I didn‚Äôt see that I had to be in a good mood on vacation, or it couldn‚Äôt relieve my burst, I didn‚Äôt care too much üòÄ Then The hotel's breakfast arrived at around 9:30 on the first day, almost all of them were cold, including freshly cooked noodles. There were few types and the taste was average. Then on weekends, because the government was running a marathon, the big lawn was requisitioned. Secondly, yoga, archery, horseback riding, rock climbing, karting, and kayaking were charged for everything, which was beyond my expectations. And there is a lack of children's play center, not even a slide, which is not very friendly to children around three years old. In terms of service, the aunt is very enthusiastic on the whole, but she is a little careless. It may be that the shampoo and shower gel bottles are very similar. Basically, except for the shower gel on the first day, and the double shampoo later, I have never seen the shower gel again. , and then the fruit and snack package clearly stayed for three nights, one per day, and there was no one day.

However, ignoring these small details is still a pleasant vacation as a whole, I hope the hotel can slowly improve.

Oh yes, this room type has a kitchen, no sofa, and only one washbasin, which is not particularly friendly to skin care and makeup people.

As soon as we arrive at the hotel, the sense of grade comes up, and the coverage rate of green plants is high, which makes people feel relaxed and happy. Unfortunately, after two days of rain, the big lawn can only be watched but not played, which is also bad luck.
According to the age of the hotel and the current facilities, it is considered to be well maintained. The room is big enough, the balcony has a great view, and the shuttle bus is very timely, which is much better than it was a few years ago.
The only thing to complain about is the hotel breakfast, which really ruined the reputation of Jun Anli! First of all, the breakfast is not in the original western restaurant with excellent scenery, but in the first floor of the Chinese restaurant building. The best thing is: flies! Countless flies, breakfast with you!
Secondly, the charging standards for children's meals are not uniform. On the same day that people we know together booked, we dine at 9 o'clock, and the baby of 1.34 meters will be charged 90. This is the standard of the hotel, I am happy to accept and abide by the rules, but friends who dine at 9:30, the same age and height, do not charge. As a five-star hotel, I can only say hehe! Please learn from Kaiyuan with others!
The worst service is that the other staff are all in place, which is one thing to say!

Going in the off-season, there are few people, the autumn is refreshing, and it is very comfortable!
Room: I live in a mountain room, opposite the balcony is the open green hill, there are sofa chairs and a small table on the balcony, even if you are in a daze for a day, it is very comfortable! There is a big bed and a sofa in the room. The big bed is super comfortable to sleep in. It is equipped with six pillows and an extra quilt, which is very considerate! The bathroom has a shower cabin and a bathtub, and the space is very large. A lot of details have been done. The bathtub has a small bracket, which is convenient for watching movies while taking a bath. The shower room has a seat and armrests, and there is an SOS button and a phone next to the toilet! There are also heated eye masks and earplugs at the head of the bed for those in need. It is really safe and comfortable to rest here. In addition, fruits and snacks are also provided in the package.
Breakfast: OK, in addition to the basic breakfast configuration, there are pancakes, pig trotters and beef brisket, which are very rich. Sitting outside, the sky is clear, the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant, and it is very relaxing. You can also go to the second floor. There are floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor, and the light is good. Good scenery.
Car: The resort area is quite big, and you need a car to pick up and drop off. Fortunately, there is a housekeeper to help you call a car, which is very convenient. You can also call an empty car on the road, there are quite a lot of cars. At night, the wind in the mountains will be cold, and the car also has a windshield, so it will not be too cold.
Attractions: Hoshino is very suitable for walking and taking pictures, going down the steps, there are alpacas, horses, rabbits and sheep. The noodles in the noodle shop taste good. The camellia-shaped building is a business center with a unique shape. Due to the epidemic management, the cliff swimming pool was not able to go.
Others: The butler service is very good. I would like to thank Xiaoyao butler. The reply is very fast, and the service is very good. I feel that the staff here, whether it is the housekeeper, the front desk, the driver, or the cleaning staff, are very friendly. For example, even if the driver is full or not in the same direction, he will help to tell the dispatch center that there are guests here when we are waiting for the bus. While waiting for the bus, whether the bus has been shunted, and when asking about the scenic spots in the park, I am also very enthusiastic to make recommendations. In addition, this is a pet-friendly hotel. I saw many people bring their dogs on vacation. There are also bags on the roadside for dog owners to pick up feces, which is full of details.
Overall, a full-point experience, highly recommended.

I was told to arrive at the hotel in a few minutes, and replied that I was waiting at the welcome center, but there was actually no one at all~ It's better not to add such a housekeeper service~ Other services such as calling for a child's toothbrush and so on responded very quickly~ All parent-child activities in the hotel All need to be charged, a little bit of that, after all, the price is already so high~

It's a pet friendly hotel and our apples had a lot of fun. The room is very big, and the view out is beautiful. It happens that you can pick up chestnuts in the hotel in autumn. My parents picked up a few from the early exercise, and the old man has a great sense of accomplishment. The hotel's breakfast is on the lawn, not as bad as some reviews say, our family thinks it's not bad. It is recommended to pay more attention to the maintenance of some hardware facilities.

The first floor assigned to us is equivalent to walking down three floors. My knees It's very inconvenient to climb up and down. In addition, travel is by connecting battery cars. Many people talk about the problem of flies, but it is true that the Chinese restaurant, breakfast is delicious and there are in the room. All the consumption in the hotel is very expensive, the karting is 128 once, we played twice, and the shrimp fishing is 200 per hour, and we only caught 3. Discovery Indoor Adventure 299 once, my baby likes to play, so I went there for two consecutive days. I bought a souvenir at the discovery and accidentally lost it in the go-kart. I contacted the butler and couldn't find it. I don't know who took it away. Swimming trunks for adults are 199 in the infinity pool, and swimming trunks for children are 159 and goggles are 149.
The housekeeper Xiaobai was very enthusiastic and added WeChat. On the first afternoon, it felt very cold. When the air conditioner was turned on, it was found that the air was cold. The housekeeper arranged for someone to send a heater to us.
On the third day, I checked out at noon, and met an aunt named Jin Xiu who was responsible for putting fruits in the guest room. She was very enthusiastic and helped us carry the bags to the ground floor. Seeing that the weather was very hot, she also gave us three bottles of water, which increased a lot of goodwill. .

msg:Stayed for two nights, and I was shocked to have breakfast on the first day. There is no restaurant dedicated to breakfast in the five-star hotel. The conference room was changed, and the meals were placed outside. The view is that flies are flying around. The two rows of tables where milk, yogurt and other drinks and hot dishes are placed are full of flies. In the room where you eat breakfast, you can also see flies stinging on the tableware. When I was about to make a bowl of white porridge, two flies stung on the pot, and I lost my appetite immediately. The most exaggerated is the attitude of the waiter. Whether it is reflected to the restaurant cleaning staff or the waiter, they are very calm and indifferent. One of the waiters even said that they do sterilization every week, but I don‚Äôt know why they still have it. Sorry, it's just incredible. Now that the temperature is more than 20 degrees, there are already so many flies. I don‚Äôt know what the hot weather is like in the summer vacation. In the summer vacation, all parents bring their babies to live at high prices. In such a hygienic situation, your hotel is not afraid of diarrhea for children? I didn't take many photos, anyway, the whole experience is the first and last time to stay here. As for other problems such as the difficulty in waiting for the shuttle bus, it is not worth mentioning in the face of hygiene issues. Ctrip or hotel management staff can take a physical examination by themselves.

There are many people traveling with their babies in the summer, so the corresponding reception staff of the hotel should keep up. The reception staff all had expressions that were not related to him. They waited in line for half an hour to check in. Some guests had to quarrel with the front desk. After checking in, they did not explain any hotel facilities and services to us. The facilities in the room are old, the sink drain of the washbasin is broken, and I have to report it for repair twice. Later, we went out and promised that we would come back to repair it. When we came back, it was still broken, and there was no feedback. It was not repaired until the next day, and the ground plug in the room was also broken. Yes, the most outrageous thing about our two-day stay was cleaning the next day. Toiletries, toothbrushes and slippers were not replaced. We still used the toothbrushes from the first day. The toothbrushes were placed on the sink on the first day, at least cleaned. I put my toothbrush in the wash cup at some point in time, but when I came back, it was still on the washstand, and the hotel is relatively large, and the shuttle bus basically waits for more than 20 minutes each time. At the most irritating time, sometimes empty cars pass by, ask if it is a staff car, and then watch the staff chatting and laughing in the car full of employees, and the guests are like fools waiting there foolishly under the high temperature, I really can't complain about having breakfast. The basic breakfast is the same after staying for two days. The dishes have not changed in any way.

On the second day, the escalator was completely broken and you had to walk by yourself. There were 70-year-old men who went there and couldn't walk at all! After discussing with the hotel, we were moved to a two-bedroom apar**ent in Magnolia. After entering the room, the air conditioner was broken and the TV was broken. We still had to take the stairs. I communicated with the person in charge of the hotel front desk and told us that there was a room with the same room type as ours and a lower floor. By this time, I had already wasted an afternoon. It was very unpleasant. The hotel offered a 10% discount on the room the next day. Who cares about such a small amount of money? The key point is that the whole family was originally on vacation. Now I have to change my luggage several times. The first time I changed it, it ended a few floors downstairs. I was asked to find a two-bedroom apar**ent with everything broken. In the end, I was unhappy and checked out the room the next day. I couldn't get a refund. I was told that the payment would take several working days to arrive. I was the biggest here and you couldn't do anything about it. Finally, I offered to let go. She called Ctrip in front of me and asked Ctrip to refund the money. Ctrip got it done in 10 minutes.
I know now that tourism is recovering, you don‚Äôt have to worry about no one coming and it will end up disgusting us. But anyway, I will never go to a hotel like this again to make myself unhappy during the Chinese New Year.

It is not very convenient for the shuttle bus to wait for a long time when the tour group checks in. It would be better if the shuttle bus for the individual passengers and the tour group were separated.

msg:#Probably the most authentic Junanli hotel evaluation...
1. Regarding the environment, the environment is not bad, the guest room is clean and bright (here I praise Master Qu Fanbing, the person is simple and kind, and the cleaning is also meticulous and rigorous)...
This time, I upgraded the twin-bedded room in the mountain residence. The room faces an ordinary hill. The scenery is still good in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai, but the operation of the double bed with a bathtub and the double bed without a bathtub confuses me? ? After staying so much, this is the first time I saw a resort hotel and differentiated it for the bathtub? ? Especially after climbing Mogan Mountain for a day, there is no place to take a bath or a sauna! ! ! ! The package of the resort hotel is really a bit different (maybe it is a mountainous area? Shouldn't the requirements be too high??)
2. Let‚Äôs talk about the so-called WeChat personal customer service housekeeper. I am Comrade Xiao Fang. Let‚Äôs start with the summary. After staying for four days, I didn‚Äôt have any active care and understanding of the guests‚Äô any itinerary plans. In the evening, I don‚Äôt ask the guests about the situation, and I don‚Äôt take the initiative to tell the weather the next day. It is recommended to learn St. Regis' real personal butler service, and it's incredible that you don't come and meet customers throughout the whole process? ? ? In the WeChat chat, the third sentence is to introduce the list of activities of the hotel... After checking out, I came to ask for a good review... Here I will talk about the three questions I raised, and I can still answer "I don't know, I don't know??" No Do you know to ask? There is a Moganshan scenic spot around. About the scenic spot and the surrounding classic hiking and cycling routes, you must be familiar with it, right? ? Here are the questions I raised. The first and second are about Moganshan‚Äôs cycling and hiking routes. The direct answer is not very clear. I asked later, and finally gave a reply to the riding‚Ä¶ I still don‚Äôt know anything on foot‚Ä¶ The first The third is about the location of the scenic spots in Moganshan, and the reply is that I don't know...
As soon as I asked three questions, I asked for a good review after I checked out, and I asked them to write well, not to write bad ones.
3. Regarding catering, I have complained to the breakfast depar**ent. First, the staff didn't know butter knives, so they directly replied "We don't have butter knives" to the guests. I really didn't know whether it was me or she who was confused... Second, the noodle stand had only two colanders for cooking noodles. I At around 8:29 a.m. on June 22, there were as many as five customers waiting in line for noodles, but the noodles of the last few people could not be cooked yet. At this point, I sincerely accept the all-season noodle stall spoon The fact that there are more than you... Not to mention the toppings, there are 3 kinds in total, one quail egg, one bean curd meat, and one meat I forgot... The bread machine is an old-fashioned manual, and it may be on the 1st gear when I go on the 21st, wait. 3 minutes is not good. After the feedback, I deliberately adjusted the 4th gear the next day, and the difference is not very big... Third, when it comes to staff training, there are always people who feel like they are idle, and come over there with a plate I just didn't know what to do when I walked. The guests should take the initiative to ask if they need it, guide them to the seat, and send them to the front, instead of wandering around. After I reported that the hot milk was gone and could not be poured out, I started to eat For at least 5 minutes, there are still customers who are saying why there is no hot milk... The management level still has a sense of management and responsibility. It's okay to apologize and send a fruit plate and dessert, but it still feels like a lack of energy...
4. The last thing to complain about is the gate! Every time you wait until the engine starts and stops! Waiting for someone to die, I think it's okay to ask the engineering depar**ent to make the door switch a little faster...

I write some objective and pertinent opinions. I hope to effectively grasp the service spirit of the staff, and change the housekeeper's mind from recommending activities and asking for praise to really helping customers solve problems and stay comfortable...
Finally, it only represents the words of my family since the 4 days and 3 nights, for reference only...

msg:Good stay. Came here with the children, and the front desk also gave a small gift. There are many activities suitable for children with clearly marked prices in the hotel brochure. It looks good but the price is not cheap. Maybe because of the epidemic or because of the high price, not many people play. I hope the price of the hotel can be more friendly to the people, then I am willing to come again. Otherwise, it is more than 2,000 yuan, and if you stay for one night, you will have to pay a lot of money for activities suitable for children. Really a little overwhelmed.

Compared with the housekeepers of other hotels I have encountered before, I can also take the initiative to send various activities of the hotel. Good night and good morning! Thank you for your attentive service! The equestrian coach patiently taught my 3-year-old son. He also worked hard. Haha, the child had a great time, and the small animals were fed. The hotel is really suitable for parent-child fun! If I have to say that it is flawed, it may be the service of the afternoon tea at Yajing Restaurant. If it can make the guests have a better experience, it will be even better! The suggestions have been fed back to Aimer, and I hope that when you come back next time, as an integral restaurant in the resort hotel, you can do better!

After checking into the hotel, I added the butler Roman's WeChat account, and immediately received all-round attention from the butler Liu Jun. During the three meals a day, I will take the initiative to ask whether I want to use a car or order a meal in advance, and I will introduce the hotel's features and services in detail, especially when the road is blocked by heavy snow on the second day, Roman repeatedly warned the road to be slippery, and reported the snow conditions on the road all day long. , I don't want to take care of the temperature at night and I need to keep warm. The cold winter night with heavy snow added a warmth. In the early morning of the third day, I called Liu Jun early in the morning to wake up and ask him to help. He helped me solve it immediately regardless of fatigue, and I would like to express my thanks to him here too! It is even more trustworthy to have such good employees in Junanli, and I hope to stay here again when the spring flowers bloom.

msg:I stayed in the mountain house for 4 days and 3 nights. The total price of the room is close to 10,000 yuan. It is not recommended to stay here. The reasons are as follows
1. The elevators to the room are all open-air escalators. There are 4 turns. Finally, some of them are actually climbing stairs, climbing stairs, and climbing stairs. Staff help.
2. The hotel room and dining, swimming pool, and karting places are far away. You need to take their battery car. You have to call the front desk to make an appoin**ent, and then go downstairs to the roadside to wait. It is normal to wait for 3-5 minutes, and then It is 39 degrees in summer, roadside exposure, or mosquito bites, sour and refreshing.
3. The food in the hotel can be described as rubbish, whether it is the breakfast in the Chinese restaurant or the buffet in the open-air bbq, let‚Äôs say, the breakfast on the third day, I think I have to eat it, and I feel a little nauseous. ps, for breakfast in the Chinese restaurant, flies often fly over from time to time.
4. The incomparable swimming pool in the giant pit, this is a giant pit, don't go to this store because of this, otherwise you will regret it for a lifetime. This swimming pool is three small pools, open-air, and the water is terribly dirty, but it was photographed by the hotel to give the illusion of a huge infinity pool, so don't expect to swim comfortably, it's too dirty to wash your feet.

At night, the front desk checked in, no one took the initiative to guide, and the front desk was a passive service that answered questions. The arranged room is very far from the lobby, and you have to take a few stairs to check in with children. There are no children's products in the room, and you need to call the front desk to ask for it. Ask the hotel at the front desk what activities are suitable for children, and give an introduction for yourself to see. On the whole, for this price hotel, the service still needs to be improved. At present, I don't feel like I will choose Gunanli again. Ninghai Anlan is much more fragrant than Jun Anli. Either the room or the service.

The hotel is so big that it makes people feel that it is definitely not profitable from selling rooms (it should be that the real estate has already made money back, so I can rest assured), the operating cost is also too large, there are very few guests during the epidemic, but everything It's also very organized. The hardware is really good, the terrace is big enough for camping parties, the bathroom facilities are all luxury lines, not toto and the like, the room design is also very reasonable, low-key and comfortable, everything is good, and you can bring pets.
The only thing is that the battery car drove for a kilometer or two from the lobby to the bottom of the room, and it took several escalators to reach the room... But that's why it has a private and superb view. There is also a major drawback, the breakfast is a bit bad and outrageous, but it is not very important for this industry. Will definitely go back many times.

A hotel with a price of more than 2,500 yuan a night is actually worth no more than 1,500 yuan for a high-end hotel that I have stayed in for many years. It is from the name of the hotel near Moganshan Scenic Area. The room is very small, it is said to be 68 square meters, but it is actually about 50 square meters. The room facilities are super ordinary, really sorry for the price. The overall hotel design is very ordinary. The design of the conference center building for breakfast is nondescript and low-grade, and the breakfast place has no scenery at all. The price of the dinner restaurant is very high, and the portion is very small, it is a black shop. This time, I went to the Yushui Hot Spring Bamboo Valley Hotel in Liyang and the Tuankou Hot Spring Xingquan Valley Resort. Going to your room in this hotel, after taking the electric car, you have to go through a long walk in the elevator, and you have to carry your luggage and go up 2 artificial stairs with many steps. The electric car driver will never carry your luggage to the room for you. All in all, the value for money of this hotel is really bad.

üîîService: The service has to mention the housekeeper, Xiao Sun. I received a service call from Xiao Sun before he came. So many people in the lobby were actually called by her name (Do you need to preview guest photos in advance for your homework?) No matter how late it is The reply to the message was very timely, and the vehicle was arranged very quickly. The shuttle bus master is also very professional. At night, the cars turn off the lights and they are very humble and make people feel safe. They will take the initiative to help the guests with their luggage. They never block each other, and there are still many places that have not been played next time. Again.

The room has a big balcony, a big bathtub, a big lounge chair, and you can also dry clothes! Looking out from the balcony is the blue sky, green mountains and the reservoir, the view is great, and the living feeling is very comfortable.
The hotel service is also very good, more than 260 rooms are equipped with more than 50 golf carts, so the connection is very fast.

The rooms are very ordinary, maybe the hotel's concept is environmental protection and simplicity, but the sanitation is really bad, you can't look at the floor carefully...At night, there will be all kinds of small bugs sleeping with them, which is understandable, after all, in the mountains.
Breakfast is in a super lobby on the first floor of the main building. It is very inconvenient to take things because of its size, and the breakfast is very ordinary.
The environment is really good, on this point, it is worthy of 3000+ house prices
There are so many activities. Because time is limited, I only played mountain biking, discover high-altitude grids, rock climbing, cliff swimming pools, except for swimming pools, everything else is charged, which is understandable
The service should also be praised. The shuttle bus is available on call. Before checking out, the body was soaked due to heavy rain. The request to postpone the check-out time was also readily agreed. Special thanks to Xiao Dong Senhuo's consultant, who will answer all questions and respond to requests, and provide us with a lot of help! Some children said they would like to thank the mountain biking coach for taking good care of him!
In general, spend money to buy happiness, and happiness will do!

It's very quiet here because the temperature is very comfortable on the mountain. Children play a lot of horseback riding, archery, feeding animals, picking, riding the lawn, and having fun every day. More important is the careful care of the butler's sheep. Let us be particularly touched by the first day before bed. I found that my son forgot to bring diaper. I asked the lamb housekeeper. It was already 10:30 pm. The hotel did not sell it. She tried to borrow it from a colleague in a nearby town. When I got it, it was more than 11:00 pm. It was particularly intimate. In addition to diaper, there was a diaper mat. I was so touched. It's expensive but it's important to have you at the time. Thank you, butler, Yang, you must find you next time you come to live, because you live comfortably. The next day, I booked the room for my parents and my brother. The whole family also came to stay for two days. Mom and Dad are very satisfied with this family trip. Looking forward to coming back to Anli County next time.

At the check-in area, there are too few people, no one welcomes guests, the view of the guest rooms is average, and there are too many houses. 360-degree rooms, no mountain view, only house view. The room facilities are very new. Horse riding, archery is good. Yoyo Paradise, watching small animals, a few rabbits and animals are suffering, there is no water to drink, and they are struggling with their lives. The shuttle bus is relatively slow, often waiting for 10 minutes, there are too few customer service staff, but the service is still satisfactory. The saddest thing is that the restaurant, the deduction points are mainly from here: it is unceremonious to say that the quality of breakfast is not as good as the outside express hotels. The waiter, lack of training, can‚Äôt make waffles, made it all morning, and finally succeeded once. The waiter stole the food and grabbed it with his hands. There was basically no food to eat. The only thing that could be eaten was meat buns. As a result, Went at 9:45 today. There was no meat buns. I asked the waiter. The waiter said that we closed the stall at 10 o'clock and we didn't provide it. The rest of the steamed buns are hard at the bottom, and they look like a stone. The amount of noodles is small, and the toppings are only radish. The breakfast provided by such an expensive hotel is worse than the school cafeteria. According to insiders, their catering depar**ent has always been like this, has been complained, and has not changed.

You can relax while watching the scenery because all the rooms are on the mountain. Fortunately, there is a car on call to pick up and drop off. It has been raining for two days, so I can only stay in the hotel to see the scenery and taste the food. The hotel‚Äôs Taoyuan restaurant is a good choice for local cuisine, bamboo shoots, bamboo forest and chicken, etc. The restaurant waiter will also remind you of the amount of food according to the number of guests. It is very customer-conscious and there is an Internet celebrity noodle restaurant that is worth going to and talk about some problems. 1 The hotel breakfast will send you to a restaurant not far away, but the place is not big. Although there are two floors, the place to take the meal is a bit small. They are all crowded and for the convenience of the guests below, the diners are all in a hurry to shuttle between the guests who pick up the meals and clean the tables, and they are all children taking things. Although the waiters are very careful, it is inevitable that there will be hidden dangers. Arrange a special passage for the waiter to pack things and walk away to avoid the guests who pick up the meal. 2 When the room card, no one told where to eat breakfast. I heard other guests say that the conference center BBQ can have breakfast here, but no one told 3 According to the hotel introduction, pets are not allowed, but I found that there is a large border animal on the balcony of the opposite building. I don‚Äôt know how to bring it in. 4 The building of the hotel is all rooms facing the balcony of another building.

Help us take off the luggage, and talk and laugh! I haven't seen the smiling faces of other waiters since entering the lobby! The water in the lobby is poured by self! Generally, a five-star hotel always comes in and someone gets it upside down, so a big group will be passionate about one person! Maybe we stayed at Banyan Tree Anji for a few days, the experience gap is too big! The view of this hotel is very good, and the building is good in all aspects. The service is really bad and there is a serious shortage of manpower! Have dinner and wait for the battery car to go back to the mountain room and wait for half an hour! The hotel is bigger than Hangzhou Kaiyuan Forest Park, and the battery car is less than half of others! It is an excuse to say that during the peak dinner period, even if the Kaiyuan Senbo is at most 3 minutes during the peak period, a car will pass and arrive to pick up guests in 5 minutes! This kind of package affects the mood too much! There is a racecourse where children can try horseback riding. There is a drone show on the lawn at 7:30 in the evening. The sky garden and rooms are also good! But there is a problem with the room air conditioner, one switch is still broken! The most annoying thing is that the hotel said there are guardrails, but the ones I brought over were extremely dirty! Picture 8 is proof! The most deceptive thing is that everyone knows that there are two poles on the top and bottom of the guardrail. It only has the upper pole, and the child can directly roll down from below! What's the use of this? Still dirty and old! Fortunately, I went out and brought a new disassembly guardrail in my trunk! I am embarrassed to use this kind of thing for the guests! This room for more than 3,000 nights really stunned me! Stayed in so many five-star hotels! I have never given such a bad evaluation and low score! In addition, the net celebrity pool is so small and pitiful! I took 2 shots for my family after zooming the wide angle! It is incomparable to Banyan Tree‚Äôs 38-meter infinity pool! There is also a big gap in the cleanliness of the water! My mother swam for a while and went back and her eyes were allergic and very red! No problem after visiting Banyan Tree for a few days! There are very few things for children to entertain! It is not recommended for parents and children at all, only couples can stay in the room to drink tea and watch the scenery! I will never come again anyway!

msg:Tuduo, let me first say that the butler in Junanli is really amazing. The butler Xiaofang is very caring. He added WeChat one day in advance and posted the hotel guide and the schedule of children's activities. When I went to the parking lot, I took the initiative to pick up my luggage, accompanied me throughout the check-in process, and gave the children electric fans and mosquito repellents and other small gifts.
The Chinese restaurant is so-so, the service can't keep up with the dishes, it's okay, the price must be expensive, but that's it for the hotel.
Not to mention the free breakfast, it is a bit worse than a five-star hotel in Sanya!
The driver of the izakaya and lounge shuttle bus said that it hadn't opened it, and gave up.
The equestrian club is in the hotel. It's not bad. The children are very happy to ride, and the coach will guide patiently.
The space in jojo paradise is very small. There are only a few pigs, two alpacas and two horses. The key is that they are kept in captivity, and the children feel stinky and they did not feed them.
It's not the season of picking, so I didn't experience it.
Although the swimming pool is also boundless, don't compare it with Sanya hotels. After all, the focus here is not swimming. It's ok for the kids to play and play.
There is still a big temperature difference between morning and evening, exposure to the sun during the day, and long clothes and trousers at night are more comfortable, too cool.
Let me give you some treasures:
1. Prepare more snacks and beer when you drive, and it's okay if you don't have a place to drink small alcohol at night. The hotel is just one word-expensive!
2. Children can bring water guns.
3. A set of long clothes and trousers for girls who are afraid of cold. It is still cold at the end of June at the moment.

msg:The scenery is picturesque and the sky garden room is very good, which is all the advantages. The check-in experience is hard to say. This is not a hotel that is very suitable for parent-child travel. The net celebrity pool is small, and the grassland project is not suitable for hot days. The indoor children's playground is very small and the equipment is not good. The most funny thing is that the place for breakfast every day is not fixed üòÇ. In addition, golf carts must be adjusted through the platform for traffic in the hotel. It is best to advance ten minutes in the current state of non-peak season, and the peak season will be longer! In short, the common problem of domestic hotel management companies, first-class hardware, third-rate management, and other things are not too much to complain!

msg:The breakfast is average, sorry for the price and the level of the hotel. In the morning, I didn't even have fried eggs. The fried eggs were piled up casually. I couldn't stand it. The bread type and taste are not good.
The environment is good, first class.
The awareness of service needs to be strengthened. The staff of the battery car sent us to the foot of the mountain. Although there is an elevator, I think we still need to take us up. This is where we need to be strengthened.
The private butler service is still affirmative, and everything is responsive.

msg:The environment is really beautiful, a place suitable for playing with children, a lot of parent-child content, a big place, and the rooms are beautiful and clean. But the hotel‚Äôs meals are not particularly good, the variety of meals is too small, and the place is not large and it is difficult to accommodate a large number of people. The service is average, there are too few vehicles, and needs to be improved. Compared with Kaiyuan Group's service initiative, there is still a big gap. Butler service is average, not too active, and it is normal to ignore information and not answer. If it is at this price, naked Heart's service level and configuration may reach a high level of service.

msg:The sky garden room reserved by the natural oxygen bar, 8401, is leaning against the bamboo forest on the mountain. The house has a beautiful and clean view, and the bed is particularly comfortable. It is very convenient to be near the swimming pool. The boating event hasn‚Äôt started yet, and it‚Äôs only swimming in hot weather. The swimming pool is very beautiful and has a good view. That is, the sun is too hot and cloudy in summer and it rains on the lawn to fully experience. The farm animals are really nothing to see. Therefore, due to weather restrictions, hotel activities are actually not a lot of fun. But it‚Äôs nice to take a rest and watch the bamboo take oxygen

msg:On vacation, traveling with my wife, I learned about this hotel on the Internet, and I came from Shanghai on a self-driving trip to Junanli.

The hotel is located in Mogan Mountain, in the woods. After entering the park, it feels like a world surrounded by trees. Give me the comfort of being away from the hustle and bustle of the city, working pressure, and hiding in the deep forest in an instant.

The room is beautiful and tidy. We live in a mountain mirror with a super large floor-to-ceiling glass. Through the glass, we can see the trees in the distance. Sitting on the balcony can experience the fragrance of birds and flowers. Sometimes, you can still see the white smoke floating in the forest because of the temperature difference between morning and evening, or after rain. Particularly in line with the poetry of autumn after the rain in the empty mountains.

There are roughly two kinds of Chinese and Western restaurants in the park, and the services inside are good, and of course the prices are not ordinary. In particular, there is a noodle restaurant by the woods, looking at the green bamboo through the glass. I guess Mr. Wolong's leisure time was nothing more than that. Of course you can order takeaway. The park will be delivered to the door of the room with a golf cart.

The front desk of the hotel also recommends many entertainment programs, horse riding, archery, and lobster fishing. If the weather is good, there are more activities on the lawn to participate in. Some of these entertainment activities are chargeable, please understand clearly before participating.


The hotel has a butler service through WeChat, and you can reserve a golf cart for movement in and out of the park. More convenient. Butler service is also very considerate. The driver's master will also chat with you a few words.

In the morning there is a buffet, like most hotels, egg and sausage buns. I am quite satisfied, and what is more special is that there are foods such as taro.

Parking lot is free

There are about nine buildings in the hotel, and the rooms on each floor have their own characteristics. As shown in the figure.

You don't need to express your voice, and our butler Xiao Li is meticulously caring to book us a restaurant. I have always asked what we need. What we really need is to let us feel like we are at home when we are away. Feel the special warmth. I have the opportunity to come back to the holiday in the future ‚õ±Ô∏è
